1
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,789
What do you think?

2
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,030
Yeah, it's good. How much was it?

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,793
$1.000.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,711
Top of the line.

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,199
So when are you leaving?

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,033
Tomorrow morning.

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,396
I promised the kids
I'd take them hunting in Ireland.

8
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,758
Listen...

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,434
I gotta talk to you about something.

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,195
I've been meaning to tell you
for a while now.

11
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,550
I'm gonna quit. I'm gonna get out.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,070
I'm gonna sell my shares
and start from scratch.

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,193
Besides, I don't really think
you even need me anymore.

14
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,430
I think you'll be all right.

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,669
It's not the best time.

16
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,431
Well, listen,

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,392
I thought it over quite a bit,
and there's nothing else I can do.

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,199
I'm so far in debt with these people,

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,111
it's what I have to do.

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,720
Have you found a buyer?

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,676
Yeah.

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,149
It's a company called Golden Eagle.

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,633
Out of Singapore.

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,075
I borrowed an awful lot
of money from these people,

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,152
and this is the best way
for me to pay back my debt.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,037
You're still gonna be running things.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,678
I already worked out part of the deal-out.

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,751
I know Golden Eagle.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,717
They're not that reputable.

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,795
Well, they did me a lot of favors,

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,515
but it was not like there
was anything ever illegal.

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,431
It was nothing like that.

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,914
No.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,436
No. Nothing illegal.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,834
Answer it.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,038
It's for you.

37
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,236
Hello?

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,115
Yeah. I'll send somebody else to get you.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,433
Sandra's here.

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,033
You're still seeing her?

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,795
Well, not really.

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,440
We talked once.
-Once too many.

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,835
You preferred the wife, didn't you?

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,598
I did.

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,908
I didn't.

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,629
Sandra's out in the waiting area,
so would you go get her for me?

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,591
Sure.
-Okay.

48
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,914
The Golden Eagle contract just arrived.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,831
Listen...

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,629
Andre has all the information,
and he's gonna start asking questions,

51
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,188
so just give him answers, okay?

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,998
There's not gonna be any more
secrets around here.

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,274
Okay.

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,430
Thank you.

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,712
Mr. Rennberg's waiting for you.
Will you follow me, please?

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,710
Thanks for seeing me.

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,109
Thanks for not taking my messages.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,911
Well, I'm here.

59
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,635
Yeah, two months late.

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,469
I thought we broke up.

61
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,239
I guess we kind of did that
a couple of times.

62
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,158
I'd like to do it once and for all.

63
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,876
Whatever makes you happy.

64
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,599
Your cufflinks?

65
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,073
Yeah.

66
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,151
Is it because we're separated
that I'm allowed into your office now?

67
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,119
How old are they?

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,272
11 and 13.

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,519
They're good-looking kids.

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,834
Yeah.

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,229
I did a nice job with them, I think.

72
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,550
But your wife...

73
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,713
It's funny.

74
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,955
Before, it would've been painful
to see these pictures.

75
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,392
I'm divorced.

76
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,318
I don't hardly see those kids anymore.

77
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,193
Your divorce went through?

78
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,111
A month ago.

79
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,350
Congratulations.

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,396
I see. That's why you
started calling again.

81
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,637
You know very well why
we never met in this office before.

82
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,312
Because of the favors I used to do for you.

83
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,635
When I used to play "escort girl"
for your clients.

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,114
Yeah.

85
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,397
I used to come and tell you
everything I heard.

86
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,715
And everything I did...

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,916
Yeah?

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,151
I'm sure you never asked your wife
to do such things.

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,352
Well, you were very good at what you do.

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,319
And you got paid...
quite well as I remember.

91
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,512
Yeah, 'cause it turned you on
to pay me for that.

92
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,872
You know, sometimes I made things up.

93
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,275
I'd rather not know.

94
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,759
I would never do it again.

95
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,117
I'm starting to get that impression.

96
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,674
Do you know why I did it?

97
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,274
No, I don't. I'm mystified.

98
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,598
I did it because I loved you.

99
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,512
Then I suppose that means
you don't anymore. Is that it?

100
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,193
No.

101
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,316
You're lying.

102
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,398
Anyway, not enough
to do that shit anymore.

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,879
I didn't have a clue.

104
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,236
I would've done anything for you.

105
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,352
And you did.

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,836
Because I believed in our relationship.

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,709
You were just taking advantage of me.

108
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,872
Took advantage of you?

109
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,596
I could've picked up a $2.00 hooker
off the street

110
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,877
to do the same fucking thing!

111
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,350
Well, you wouldn't have
gotten such good info.

112
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,276
I didn't give a damn about the info.

113
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,996
You think some sweaty, drunken,
half-hard businessman

114
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,959
is gonna tell you anything important
at 3:00 in the morning?

115
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,954
Sure, I thought, maybe once in a while

116
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,316
there'd be a small piece of information.

117
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,916
Give me an edge on a business deal.

118
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,673
So...

119
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,632
it was all a game for you.

120
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,154
If that's what you want to call it.

121
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,074
Yeah. That's what I want to call it.

122
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,999
You know, you're not a fool.

123
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,719
You weren't tricked into doing anything.

124
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,389
You got off on every bit of that
just as much as I did, and you know it.

125
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,596
I don't know.

126
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,716
Got into what?

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,514
You enjoyed doing what
I wanted you to do.

128
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,993
You liked it. You liked being mine.

129
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,832
Being yours?

130
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,273
Yeah.

131
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,391
You remember that weekend?

132
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,109
We went away and we made up
a little game where'd you be my slave.

133
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,910
Say the word slave again.

134
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,193
Slave.

135
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,832
Again.

136
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,797
Slave.

137
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,632
Again.

138
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,036
I think you liked doing
what I wanted you to do,

139
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,792
and you got off on it.

140
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,350
I was doing a bunch of drugs.

141
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,477
I didn't feel much. I was numb.

142
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,239
That's a bad excuse.

143
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,592
All right. I felt this much.

144
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,273
The truth is you didn't give a shit.

145
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,590
You could barely get it up.

146
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,672
Well,

147
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,669
you'd get hard when you told me
what we are going to do,

148
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,513
but less when we actually did it.

149
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,316
Can't you take that later?

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,991
Okay.

151
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,036
You know how much I miss you?

152
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,509
For the wrong reasons.

153
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,955
You shouldn't insist.

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,878
You just don't want to give in, that's all.

155
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,391
I don't want to end up like we were.

156
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,914
It's so hard to get out of it.

157
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,675
So you got out of it?

158
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,359
I don't think about you anymore.

159
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,630
I think about you less.

160
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,115
Anyway, I've got a new job now,
so there's no time for that.

161
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,152
Okay. You've got a job. Doing what?

162
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,959
Do you remember Lester and Sue Wang?

163
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,793
We had dinner with them
a couple times, right?

164
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,353
Yeah, I work with them.

165
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,908
They bought contemporary furniture
from Kwantung.

166
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,555
Whatever happened to that
science-fiction website you had?

167
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,037
That was so dumb.

168
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,517
It was not dumb. It was good.

169
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,511
What was the name of that
character you invented?

170
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,757
Vortex?
-Yeah, Vortex.

171
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,870
Vortex could put out her hand
and control people, right?

172
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,150
Why don't you do that right now?

173
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,673
Stick out your hand.

174
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,155
Come to my place tomorrow night.

175
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,235
There were two containers on the ship.

176
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,191
This is one.
Where is my other container?

177
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,840
Well, it'll be here tomorrow.

178
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,353
I spoke to the freighter.
He says he's sorry.

179
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,078
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm sorry, too.

180
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,559
There's four crates at the PHV.

181
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,835
Put them on the platform,
deliver them this afternoon, okay?

182
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,951
Fax this to Hong Kong immediately.

183
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,598
Okay.

184
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,074
We have to change shippers.

185
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,993
This is the third screw-up.

186
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,389
Put the ones with red stickers aside.
It's a different order.

187
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,469
No, it's fine.

188
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,358
It's okay. I told them.
They know. Don't worry.

189
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,470
Are you sure you want to leave?

190
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,516
Is it the money?

191
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,312
No, it's not the money. It's just...

192
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,870
I told you it was temporary
and, um...

193
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,030
Did someone offer you another job?

194
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,116
No, I'm probably going to leave Paris.

195
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,675
Look, these are the four items
that are missing,

196
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,398
everything's fine,
and I signed here for you.

197
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,908
The last page right here?

198
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,069
Still needs to be checked.

199
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,430
But Bruno said he'll do it later.

200
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,115
So is Miles going to help you?

201
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,309
Miles?

202
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,073
You're seeing him again, right?

203
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,315
How do you know?

204
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,358
His secretary called
to confirm your appointment.

205
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,310
Why? I saw him once.

206
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,868
I thought you made up your mind.

207
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,434
I did. I made up my mind.

208
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,393
And he was supposed to be all of your life?

209
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,830
He's out of it.

210
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,549
This is the last time.
-Too risky.

211
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,397
Next week I'll be gone.

212
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,629
Where to?

213
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,551
China.

214
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,239
Beijing. I'm buying into a club.

215
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,119
With what money?

216
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,189
Don't worry.

217
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,154
You'd live there?

218
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,115
In a second.

219
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,194
I swear, a second.

220
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,995
Here.

221
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,079
After, I'll send you a signal like this.

222
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,833
I want to go away too.

223
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,313
But I couldn't go alone.

224
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,394
I won't be alone.

225
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,072
Who are you going with?

226
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,079
Where's Sandra?

227
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,037
Where is Sandra?

228
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,792
In the booth down there.

229
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,875
Does she have the package?

230
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,075
No.

231
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,149
Where is the package?

232
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,111
It's in the car under my seat.

233
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,589
My motorcycle is
over there behind the bank.

234
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,150
Take the motorcycle
and get out of here.

235
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,788
Got the cash?

236
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,959
Can I see?

237
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,514
Let go of me!

238
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,038
Let go!

239
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,875
Don't move.

240
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,791
Fuck!

241
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,913
Well, I'm doing what I can.

242
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,914
What?

243
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,551
How long?
How long have you been doing this?

244
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,596
What, like, you pretend
like you didn't know now?

245
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,669
I don't fucking know.

246
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,718
If I knew, I'd fire you.

247
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,316
I thought you loved me.

248
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,991
You know I do.

249
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,477
Just don't fuck with me, all right?

250
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,311
Don't do this to me.

251
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,589
Check tomorrow's paper.

252
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,629
Okay.

253
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,392
Where were you?

254
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,835
Playing poker.

255
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,638
All night?

256
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,072
Yes.

257
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,509
Win or lose?

258
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,750
Lose.

259
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,479
How much?

260
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,516
Enough.

261
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,595
They dropped off the tickets.

262
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,191
Call my wife and make sure
she got the reservations for the boys.

263
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,550
Everything should be okay.

264
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,108
Hang on. I gotta get the door.

265
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,239
Listen,

266
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,034
I'd like you to keep working for me,
if you'll think about it.

267
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,832
You can stay with André if you want.

268
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,630
But I'll miss you,
and you need to come if you'd like.

269
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,029
We'll have fun. Good-bye.

270
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,950
You brought your keys.

271
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,871
I brought them back to you.

272
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,197
You brought them back to me.

273
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,800
The keychain was a gift.

274
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,030
I'm returning it.

275
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,076
Were you on the phone?

276
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,953
Yeah. I just hung up.

277
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,393
You want a whiskey?

278
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,476
No.

279
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,596
Well, I'm gonna have one.

280
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,518
You sure I can't get you something?

281
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,831
No, I won't stay long.

282
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,955
I shouldn't have come here.

283
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,951
I'm regretting it already.

284
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,514
I think you came here
because it's dangerous.

285
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,037
I'm gonna get some ice.

286
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,590
Are you hungry?

287
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,796
No.

288
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,274
I got Lebanese.

289
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,510
For two?

290
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,875
Of course.

291
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,399
Looks pretty good.
You might change your mind.

292
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,476
You said you'd lend me money.

293
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,755
A few months went by,
I don't know what happened.

294
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,398
Maybe you forgot.

295
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,228
A million dollars is pretty hard to forget.

296
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,919
That's an awful lot of money.

297
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,029
Not for you.

298
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,998
Yeah, for me and for anyone.

299
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,990
Why didn't you keep your promise, Miles?

300
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,073
Well, I kind of thought it was a high price
to pay for getting dumped, first of all.

301
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,230
Don't.

302
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,637
If I'd had bought that club
for you in Beijing,

303
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,712
I never would've seen you again.

304
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,028
It was an investment.

305
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,315
One investment.

306
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,639
Where are you gonna run
the investment from? Paris?

307
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,870
Sure. Why not?

308
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,554
You have companies in places
you've never even been to.

309
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,273
By not giving you the money,

310
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,197
I had a chance that you would
come back to me

311
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,875
after you got done being angry.

312
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,033
And it looks like I calculated
the right way, because here you are.

313
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,554
I get paid for calculating.

314
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,717
I hear you don't get paid
as much these days.

315
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,993
Is that what you heard?

316
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,035
Yeah.

317
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,314
I've made a few bad investments,
that's for sure.

318
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,073
And I've moved around some money

319
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,475
to places maybe
where it shouldn't have gone,

320
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,950
but everyone's just trying
to feel their way back.

321
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,158
People say you're finished.

322
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,356
You know, I read, um...

323
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,234
an article about you in an online
business magazine.

324
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,996
It said you got fucked by the Japanese
when you were betting on the yen.

325
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,597
And you got fucked by the Russians

326
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,714
when you bought an obsolete
petro-chemical plant.

327
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,792
It also said you've been sucking
their cocks ever since

328
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,395
to try and control the damage.

329
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,991
You know what they called you?

330
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,789
Perfect cliché of bygone times.

331
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,396
You're reading business magazines now?

332
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,233
Sometimes, when I'm going for a laugh.

333
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,630
Made me laugh.

334
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,638
If I'd have given you that money,

335
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,190
I never would've seen you again.

336
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,748
I don't need your money.

337
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,031
Keep it so you can buy
a petro-chemical plant.

338
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,955
In Russia.

339
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,514
Well, if you don't want the money,
then what do you want?

340
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,672
I don't know.

341
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,070
I just came here to see what it was
that obsessed me so much.

342
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,152
Well, what did you find?

343
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,199
I can't see it. It's gone now.

344
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,792
What do you see?

345
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,157
I see, um,

346
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,550
a run-of-the-mill businessman...

347
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,399
alone...

348
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,111
divorced...

349
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,478
in a lawsuit with his wife...

350
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,717
losing his grip.

351
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,593
Lost in his personal life.

352
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,428
Lost in his business life.

353
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,479
His body going to seed.

354
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,036
The perfect cliché of bygone times.

355
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,833
I was bullshitting you, Miles.

356
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,909
I had butterflies in my stomach
on my way here...

357
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,151
just like when I used to be
in love with you.

358
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,470
You never stopped.

359
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,757
When I'm away from you,
I'm clear headed.

360
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,550
I think about the future.

361
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,435
The club in Beijing,
how that could change my life.

362
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,229
But when I'm around you,
it all goes blurry and I...

363
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,837
I get carried away.

364
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,952
About what?

365
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,070
Just memories.

366
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,277
The life we could have shared
and the hopes I had.

367
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,997
For a while, I thought I was
meant to be by your side.

368
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,600
How ridiculous.

369
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,191
The truth is it's over now.

370
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,713
It's history.

371
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,313
I'm not crying for you,
I'm crying for myself.

372
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,555
I'd like a whiskey.

373
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,200
All right, then I'll get you one.

374
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,557
No, a bigger one.

375
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,030
With ice cubes.

376
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,355
I don't love you anymore, Miles.

377
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,078
I desire you,

378
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,957
but don't love you anymore.

379
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,033
Since when? Tonight?

380
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,599
No.

381
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,672
Tonight I just needed to prove it to myself.

382
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,235
Well, since when, then?

383
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,355
Since...

384
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,830
I went out with those
Japanese clients of yours.

385
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,275
Do you remember that?

386
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,278
Yes, I do.

387
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,752
Well, we ended up at their hotel.

388
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,231
The oldest one, Takeshi,

389
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,995
had slipped some GHB in my beer.

390
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,038
When I woke up, they were gone.

391
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,114
They left a rolled-up 100-dollar bill

392
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,673
on the night table.

393
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,671
After that, I came to see you.

394
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,837
You were with that girl Louise Flannagan.

395
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,948
You had been doing crystal with her
and ordered some Lebanese,

396
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,998
which is why...

397
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,958
I don't touch that shit.

398
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,033
Anyway, you wanted me to tell you
everything that happened in front of her.

399
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,356
She kept wanting me to admit

400
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,874
that I'd been raped in my sleep.

401
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,714
You were raped...

402
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,829
by all of them.

403
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,479
Those fucking animals
took Polaroids of you,

404
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,189
and they showed them around
in their office,

405
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,717
and I can tell you for sure...

406
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,636
It wasn't something I was proud of.

407
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,834
Louise wanted me
to tell everything in detail.

408
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,150
Seemed to turn her on.

409
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,631
Nobody forced you to say anything.

410
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,068
You did.

411
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,958
You wanted me to turn her on

412
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,952
so then you could watch us fuck.

413
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,794
That's why you had her
come over in the first place.

414
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,513
I had taken two Ecstasies.

415
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,032
I was rolling,
and I let her go down on me.

416
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,588
And I watched you jerk off.

417
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,558
And then we slept together.

418
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,676
No, we didn't.

419
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,354
You're getting it mixed up.

420
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,995
You had an early flight to Moscow.

421
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,072
And then...

422
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,869
And then Louise took me home.

423
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,520
I didn't know how to get rid of her.

424
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,478
And then she kept texting me for a month.

425
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,870
Why in the hell
didn't you ever tell me that?

426
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,117
Because I don't give a fuck
about Louise Flannagan.

427
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,558
I didn't even want to tell
you about this till now.

428
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,359
When you came back from Russia,

429
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,915
you had forgotten all about it.

430
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,956
But not me.

431
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,838
We've done a lot worse than that,

432
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,354
and you know it.

433
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,789
I say, we've done a lot worse than that.

434
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,916
I think it's better I go now.

435
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,912
Hey!

436
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,718
Come here.

437
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,994
Hey!
-Miles...

438
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,069
What do you think you're doing?

439
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,310
Please let me leave.
-Where are you going?

440
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,550
Where do you think you're going?

441
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,278
Miles.

442
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,316
Where do you think you're going?
-Miles, let me go, please.

443
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,669
Let me go. I swear to God
it's better this way.

444
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,749
Please let me go.

445
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,871
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

446
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,632
Let me go, Miles.

447
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,233
Let me go!

448
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,275
Hey!

449
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,712
These are mine now.

450
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,717
You gave them back.

451
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,235
You want a beer?

452
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,236
Don't worry. It's not spiked.

453
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,313
And even if it was,
you'd drink it anyway, right?

454
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,432
Maybe.

455
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,431
No. No maybe. Yes.

456
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,799
Say yes.

457
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,989
Yes.

458
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,710
Now you know, at the end of the night,

459
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,433
I'm gonna handcuff you,

460
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,873
and I'm gonna fuck you.

461
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,673
Yes.

462
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,712
Right over there in the cabinet.

463
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,311
You kept the handcuffs.

464
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,469
Yeah.

465
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,032
I hate them. They hurt.

466
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,670
That's not what you used to say.

467
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,318
May I ask you a question, Miles?

468
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,118
Of course.

469
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,592
Am I the only girl that turns you on?

470
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,069
Yes.

471
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,991
I'm the only one you can fuck?

472
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,355
That's right.

473
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,396
But the others.

474
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,512
The others don't do anything for me.

475
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,472
Since when?

476
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,754
For a while.

477
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,277
I gotta get that, okay?

478
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,112
This is New York.

479
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,395
The market's closing.

480
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,959
Yeah, hello.

481
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,629
No, no. No, no. No, no.
I was expecting your call.

482
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,518
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

483
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,149
No, look, as long as it stays that way,
we're not gonna sell.

484
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,231
That's absolutely out of the question.

485
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,075
That's right. No, I have
the information right in front of me.

486
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,030
Look, we have to be careful, okay?
That's all I'm saying.

487
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,752
They're waiting for a sign,
and we gotta be careful.

488
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,312
Vortex.

489
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,671
Hey, couldn't I have a cigarette?

490
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,949
<i>Merci.</i>

491
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,593
Get down!

492
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,155
Don't you fucking move.

493
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,357
Okay? Don't move an inch.

494
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,993
I said don't fucking move!

495
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,915
Is it done?

496
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,313
Did anyone see you?

497
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,992
Were you followed?

498
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,832
No.

499
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,275
The gun. Give me the gun.

500
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,151
Did you wipe your prints?

501
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,832
I don't know.

502
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,593
You don't know?

503
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,076
Sandra, you asked me to help you,
and I will help you,

504
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,596
but if you don't fucking listen to me,
I can't help you.

505
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,029
Do you understand?

506
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,196
I did what I could.

507
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,953
In any case, you were caught
by the cameras.

508
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,558
They saw you come, they saw you go.

509
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,795
They'll identify you.

510
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,356
This time tomorrow, you'll be
a new person in a different country.

511
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,998
No one will know you.

512
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,230
Did you bring a change of clothes?

513
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,197
Yeah.

514
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,669
Change. Your dress is torn.

515
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,550
I booked you a flight to Hong Kong.

516
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,949
You leave for Madrid, Orly.
7:15 in the morning.

517
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,270
Madrid, Hong Kong, 3:30.

518
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,794
Do you understand?
-Yeah.

519
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,438
When you get to Hong Kong,

520
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,957
take a taxi to this address.

521
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,679
Go inside the building,
go to the tenth floor.

522
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,751
Look for Mr. Ho.

523
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,239
Mr. Ho is my friend.

524
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,788
He knows nothing.

525
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,996
He needs to know nothing.

526
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,479
Don't ask him anything.

527
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,839
He'll take care of you.

528
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,797
You need to do what I say.

529
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,717
When you get to Hong Kong,
do not use your credit cards, okay?

530
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,552
They'll find you immediately.

531
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,955
This is 1.000 U.S. dollars
in Hong Kong dollars.

532
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,468
It's not much. Be careful with it.

533
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,278
Give me your credit card.

534
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,995
You use your credit cards,
they trace you.

535
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,390
Give me your phone.

536
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,993
I don't want you using your phone.

537
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,308
It's too dangerous.

538
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,591
My flight takes off from Rossi
four hours before you.

539
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,989
I arrive in Hong Kong before you as well.

540
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,759
Mr. Ho will give you an address
to where I will be.

541
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,835
You'll meet me there.

542
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,474
At your place?
-No.

543
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,391
The person that hired us.

544
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,913
When the cops find Miles and it's official,

545
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,191
we get the other half of the money,
cash, in Hong Kong.

546
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,759
It's faster, it's better.

547
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,071
Then he disappears, and so will we.

548
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,031
Give me the keys to the car.
-What for?

549
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,076
You don't need to know.
Just give the keys.

550
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,079
Lisa's waiting for you outside.

551
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,953
I don't want you to be alone.
She has your suitcase.

552
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,912
Wait, you told her about this?

553
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,958
You did.

554
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,113
Lisa's over there.

555
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,118
Sandra. I know you need me now, okay?

556
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,078
We have to wait 24 hours. 24 hours.

557
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,196
I'll manage.

558
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,713
You sure?

559
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,719
You have to trust me. Trust me.

560
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,676
Wish me well.

561
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,829
Come here.

562
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,556
Lester said to go to the Vegas.

563
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,710
You have to be seen.

564
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,156
He asked me to come to China.

565
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,914
Did you say yes?

566
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,678
What do I have to lose?

567
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,073
I'll wait with you.

568
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,151
Lisa, I'm okay. I want to be alone.

569
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,275
Are you sure?

570
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,148
Lester said
to stick with you till you leave.

571
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,514
You're on his flight?

572
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,278
Yeah, 8:40 from Rossi.

573
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,590
I'll drop you off, then get my stuff.

574
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,155
See you there.

575
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,471
I trust you. You won't blow me off.

576
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,238
I know no one there.

577
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,275
Neither do I.

578
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,558
Could I have some water, please?

579
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,430
Hi.
-Hello, madam.

580
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,272
I need to go to this address.

581
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,514
I'll take you.

582
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,999
Okay?
-Okay.

583
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,910
Excuse me?
Uh, do you know where this is?

584
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,029
This...

585
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,958
Oh, over there.

586
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,319
Yeah.

587
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:10,114
Hello. Are you Mr. Ho?

588
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,436
I'm Sandra. Lester must've
told you about me.

589
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,198
Do you have the paper with my name?

590
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,191
You mean this?

591
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,390
She's here. Text me the address.

592
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:59,230
You remember, Abacus Import, fifth floor.

593
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,309
Abacus Import.

594
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,349
Hi. I'm Sandra.
I'm looking for Lester.

595
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,795
He's waiting for you.
-Thank you.

596
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,398
Can I check my bag?
-Right here.

597
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,676
In here.
-Thanks.

598
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,671
Hey!

599
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,638
Open the fucking door!

600
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,039
Lester?

601
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,234
Open this door!

602
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,469
She's here.

603
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,915
Ah Wing is dealing with her.

604
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,468
I told you to wait for me.

605
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,039
You've bungled up enough.

606
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,759
Who said to get rid of the other girl?

607
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,717
She wasn't part of the plan.

608
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,916
Too risky to let her go.

609
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,389
You do not make decisions.

610
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,914
I've warned you. I do.

611
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,468
Bring her to me.

612
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,797
Now!

613
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,874
Lester?

614
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,030
It's Sue.

615
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,076
Can I talk to Lester, please?

616
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,436
He's not here. He left with his cell.

617
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,515
Where are you?

618
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,830
Same as you, Hong Kong.

619
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,677
Well, I need to talk to Lester.

620
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:23,436
Lester has business to deal with,
but he's going to meet up with you later.

621
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,511
I'll call later then.

622
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,999
You want to come over?

623
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,638
Do you want an address?

624
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:33,800
Do whatever you want.
I don't see that you need options.

625
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,589
Wait. It's better if you
talk to the taxi driver.

626
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,672
I'm sorry. A person's
gonna tell you the address.

627
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,272
Hello?

628
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,759
Yes, I'm here.

629
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,633
148 Connaught Road?

630
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,159
What do I do? Where do I go?

631
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,553
I can see you.

632
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,677
His furniture sales are just
part of the business.

633
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,711
They make them in Canton,
they go through Shenzhen

634
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,671
and distribute worldwide.

635
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,754
The only thing is, I have to keep changing
the address of this or you get traced.

636
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,671
Seems to be going pretty well.

637
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,233
Not well enough.

638
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:50,478
We're hurting in covering costs.
We have big debts.

639
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,032
Where is Lester?

640
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,510
He had more meetings.

641
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,830
Have to join him later.

642
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,953
And I also make things clear.

643
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,429
I know all about the two of you.

644
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,114
You're not the first.

645
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,670
There were others before you.

646
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,397
And you just put up with it?

647
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,919
He needs me.

648
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,595
I wouldn't be so sure of that if I was you.

649
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,752
I know.

650
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:39,880
Andy? Kindly go over them.

651
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,356
You're in love with him.

652
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:52,876
Do you really want me to talk about it?

653
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,951
He does it to humiliate me.

654
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,158
I kind of have a hard time
picturing you as a victim.

655
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,235
You're wrong.

656
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,110
So you just let him
go on his business of that.

657
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,993
It's convenient.

658
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,229
We needed money.

659
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,880
What, to pay the club in Beijing?

660
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,711
Yeah.

661
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,631
To pay for the different men I'm into.

662
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,518
It's a lot of money. I don't have it.

663
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,592
In partnership with you, it was possible.

664
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,992
Wait. It was me and Lester. Not you.

665
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,197
Didn't he tell you?

666
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,192
I'm the one with all
the contacts in Beijing.

667
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,999
My brother-in-law works
for the Olympic Company.

668
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,953
Lester's from Hong Kong.
He doesn't know a thing.

669
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,468
I grew up there.

670
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,954
I just checked the Internet.

671
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,673
Miles is dead, they say in the news.

672
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,153
Did they say anything else?

673
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,629
No.

674
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,438
They just announced it.

675
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,799
Did they talk about the circumstances?

676
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,998
They say he was found dead
in his house, and that's all.

677
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,593
That's enough.

678
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,399
Lester is having a meeting tomorrow
to get the rest of the money,

679
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:20,275
and the other half has already
been wired from an account in China.

680
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,994
Maybe Ah Wing was supposed
to take care of you when you arrive:

681
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,833
give you your share
and help you disappear.

682
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,758
But I'm behind it.

683
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,034
Do you know him?

684
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,111
I've never met him.

685
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,276
He's Lester's contact.

686
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,079
Well, he definitely tried
to make me disappear.

687
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,633
Meaning?

688
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,998
Lisa is dead.

689
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,474
I said Lisa is dead.

690
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,438
They probably killed her
because they thought it was me.

691
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,879
She shouldn't have come.

692
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,953
Well, Lester said that

693
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,951
it was dangerous
to leave her in Paris and...

694
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,712
Lester's full of shit!

695
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,395
I'm out of here.

696
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,953
Where are you going?

697
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,873
You have been identified by now.

698
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,191
There is a warrant out for your arrest.

699
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,192
You have no credit card.

700
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,350
You can't use a passport.

701
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,994
You don't know anyone here.

702
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,999
Lester can't help you.

703
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,071
That's the last time you'll see him.

704
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,679
Did you love Miles?

705
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,513
No.

706
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,076
Yes. I loved him once very much.

707
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,269
But I just turned him on, that's all.

708
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,271
Isn't that the same thing?

709
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:03,070
That's what guys say
because it suits them.

710
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,953
But no, it's not the same thing.
I don't think so.

711
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,035
Now you're free.

712
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:10,072
Free of what?

713
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,913
I'm not free of anything.
I destroyed my life.

714
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,399
You have money.

715
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,799
Oh, fuck the money!

716
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,394
You and Lester can keep it.

717
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,311
You earned it.

718
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,353
Leave me the fuck alone. Please?

719
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,633
I want to go back to Paris

720
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:36,036
and hand myself over to the police.

721
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,239
It's Lester. Look, he's on the way.
I told him you were here.

722
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,675
You told me he was supposed
to be here already.

723
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,239
Where is Lester?

724
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,793
What can I do?

725
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,279
I don't know!
What the fuck can you do?

726
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,069
What are we doing in this stupid place?
I want to get going.

727
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,276
Well, he can call me
on Lisa's cell phone.

728
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,793
I have it.

729
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,830
Thank you.

730
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,273
Want a hit?

731
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,031
I don't want any!

732
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,314
Okay.

733
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,870
Stay. We'll hide you for a few days.

734
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,353
After that, you'll be on your own.

735
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,919
Right now, it's too dangerous.

736
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,673
I need a passport. That's all.

737
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,352
We'll find you one.

738
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,351
You need cash too.

739
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,672
I don't want to stay at your place.

740
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,193
What the fuck
am I gonna do at your place?

741
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,754
Where do you want to go?

742
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,674
A hotel.

743
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,076
A hotel will ask you for your ID.

744
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,029
Wait for Lester.

745
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,514
If you need a hotel room,
he'll find you a hotel room.

746
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,113
What did you put in my drink, bitch?

747
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,513
Nothing.

748
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:19,030
You just got off a plane. You're tired.

749
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,238
What was in my drink?

750
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,430
Nothing, I swear!

751
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,272
I should fucking kill you.

752
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,996
Just sleep for a while.
You'll feel better.

753
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,796
You feel sleepy, right?

754
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,516
You can't even keep your eyes open.

755
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,072
You're sleepy.

756
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,513
Right?

757
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,756
Don't do anything stupid.

758
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,031
Give me...

759
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,719
your gun.

760
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,274
You're going to sleep.

761
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,389
How could you even think for a minute
that I'd let you see Lester again?

762
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,471
You're awake. You want a coffee?

763
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,438
No, thanks. I'm being careful.

764
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,192
I won't insist.

765
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,599
At least sit down.

766
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,229
I should've picked you up earlier.

767
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:23,831
I promised I would,
but things screwed up.

768
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,075
I have a new passport
and some money for you, though.

769
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,473
And a new identity.

770
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,789
From who?

771
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,636
You're American with an Italian background.

772
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,678
Your name is Flavia Trabasani.

773
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,836
Where do I go with this?

774
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,275
To Shanghai.
you have a six month visa.

775
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,999
What exactly do I do in Shanghai?

776
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,436
I have an old friend.
I used to work with him now and then.

777
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,795
I don't anymore.

778
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,876
But if you want, he has a job for you.

779
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,111
It's a tough city,
but anything's possible there.

780
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,430
It's a good place to start a new life.

781
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,755
What's your job?

782
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,513
I, uh, get clothes made.

783
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,435
They're pretty cheap, but young people
in the West love them.

784
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,636
You wouldn't know the brand.

785
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:17,271
We sell them bulk to chains
that distribute under their own labels.

786
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,873
Why are you helping me?

787
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,638
It's a favor for a friend.

788
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,240
What does your friend want?

789
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:27,472
He wants you to disappear,
at least for a little while.

790
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,353
Does that plan suit you?

791
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,671
Suits me fine.

792
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,111
Sue told me you don't
want the money owed to you.

793
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,953
I don't want to touch it.

794
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,519
This will get you to Shanghai.

795
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,994
When you get there,
you'll be taken care of.

796
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,310
It's best if you leave as soon as possible.

797
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,669
Your ticket's open.

798
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,228
You can still make the 12:00 flight.

799
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,592
Good luck, and forget we ever met.

800
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,875
I'm heading back. A shipment came in.

801
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,076
I need the papers.

802
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,355
On the desk.

803
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,279
Did you speak to Kay?

804
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,114
Sandra is on her way to Shanghai.

805
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,872
I honored my side. She's alive.

806
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,317
Lisa died instead.

807
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,835
Did you get the money?

808
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:11,036
I'll have it later.

809
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,873
I'm moving to Beijing.

810
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,112
I'll buy out your shares of the club.

811
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,151
Give me six months.

812
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,595
Will you send for Sandra?

813
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,995
Not right away.

814
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,109
Too dangerous.

815
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,879
For her or for you?

816
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,117
She needs to keep a low profile.

817
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,918
Then she can come.

818
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,996
You used her.

819
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,638
You betrayed her.

820
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,438
She doesn't love you anymore.

821
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,909
She won't come.

822
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,117
And one day she'll seek revenge.

823
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:08,676
If you step out that door...

824
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,309
you'll never see me again.

825
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,798
Okay, follow him.

826
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,990
Don't lose him, okay?
Go, go, go, go.
