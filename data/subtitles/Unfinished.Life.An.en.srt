2
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:43,479
I heard you interfering little bastards
rummage around my yard.

3
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,359
I'll thank you for keeping the owls off of my cats.

4
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,450
You sleep OK?

5
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:23,913
Sorta.

6
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,381
I, uh...

7
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:35,384
God, Jean, I don't know what happened.

8
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:38,637
It's like a red mist or...

9
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:43,433
Something comes over me and I...

10
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:49,355
But I feel like you backed me up in a corner and I...

11
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,609
You do that, and uh...

12
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,403
I hate it when I'm like that.

13
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:11,461
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,342
Can you forgive me?

15
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:29,729
What?!

16
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:36,486
Fuck!

17
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:45,453
You promised...

18
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:48,372
if it happened again...

19
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:50,459
You promised.

20
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:55,587
OK, this is last week and up to yesterday.

21
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:57,049
- All right?
- OK.

22
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:00,383
- I stuck an extra 50 bucks in there.
- Kitty, I can't...

23
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,762
- You can. Listen...
- Here, just take it.

24
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:06,307
I don't wanna see you coming around here
anymore looking like this.

25
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,646
You take care.
Take care of that girl. Get going. OK.

26
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,564
We have a reciprocity agreement with Kansas.

27
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,735
If you can stay in this shelter for a week.

28
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,446
- I could find you a place in Wichita.
- No.

29
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:23,408
Every man in town who beats a woman
knows where this shelter is.

30
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,410
Do you have someone you can stay with?

31
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:28,620
I don't think you really understand
just how worried I am.

32
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,624
I don't know.
Maybe they went shopping.

33
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:34,670
I wish someone in this goddamn place would just...

34
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:37,588
would just give me the truth.

35
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:42,802
Then we could find Jean pretty damn quick.

36
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,726
Tribune, Kansas.
Do you wanna go there?

37
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:54,480
Sure. Maybe. I mean,
we can go anywhere we want.

38
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:57,608
How about Loving, New Mexico?

39
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:02,322
- I like that.
- Me too.

40
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:06,160
Topeka.

41
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,245
Santa Cruz.

42
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,790
Oh, my gosh.
There's a Butt, Montana.

43
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:14,916
It's pronounced "Bute."

44
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,336
- Mom?
- Oh, no. No!

45
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,355
Hey!

46
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:41,526
She's not going anywhere.
There's a rod sticking through the block.

47
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:43,822
I'm heading to Sioux Falls.

48
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,617
Yeah.

49
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,788
Just take what you need.

50
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,634
So one inch is 83 miles.

51
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:10,932
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

52
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,978
Aloha, Oregon.

53
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,774
It's only ten inches away.

54
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:25,947
So that's 830 miles and we've already gone 300 miles...

55
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:28,867
We're going to Wyoming.

56
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:04,735
What's in Wyoming?

57
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,199
It's where your grandfather lives.

58
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,370
I have a grandfather?

59
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,249
Not much of one.

60
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:22,545
When were you going to tell me?

61
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:30,471
Oh, I'm fine.

62
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,475
Smells like rain.

63
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,894
It's not gonna rain today.

64
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,233
You haven't been right about the weather since 1972.

65
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:46,653
I know what rain looks like.

66
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,117
You got something on your mind this morning?

67
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:56,038
The goddamn bear's back.

68
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:02,920
Well, what do you think you're gonna do about it?

69
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:05,213
What I should have done a year ago.

70
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,668
Did anyone notice if he had cubs?
Did you see cubs with him?

71
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,706
OK.

72
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:43,102
- It's under control, Einar.
- You get out of the way and it will be.

73
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:46,856
Come on, let's let the Fish and Game take care of this.

74
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,942
This isn't some pet dog they're after.

75
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:54,990
I think they can tell the difference, all right?

76
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,993
That says what a college education gets you.

77
00:09:58,118 --> 00:09:59,995
Here we go.

78
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,054
Mom.

79
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:20,139
Welcome to Wyoming.

80
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:24,061
Mom, this is us.

81
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,442
So is my grandpa nice?

82
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,697
Why didn't you tell me about him?

83
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:51,004
Einar!

84
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:14,445
I don't want you here.

85
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:19,032
At least we agree on something.

86
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:21,534
I don't wanna be here either.

87
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:26,539
We need a place to stay for about a month or so.

88
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:31,669
Looks like you need every part of your head examined.

89
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:34,255
Is this yours?

90
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,342
She's yours too.

91
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:46,684
You telling me I have a grandchild I don't know about?

92
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:52,399
I'm telling you I was pregnant at Griffin's funeral.

93
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,485
Where you been till now?

94
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:58,238
We've been on the road for two days.

95
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:01,283
We lived in Iowa.

96
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:04,702
Now this suddenly seems like home?

97
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:07,206
What's her name?

98
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,416
My name's Griff.

99
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,753
Griff Gilkyson.

100
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:16,088
That's an unusual name for a girl.

101
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:20,259
Einar, please.

102
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:24,096
Just till I can earn enough to get us out of here.

103
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,042
There's a room in the basement.

104
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,692
I'm sorry.

105
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:36,378
Hey. I'm gonna go into town
and look for a job.

106
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,298
You think you'll be all right here?

107
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,301
All right, well, just... be good.

108
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:45,636
Love you.

109
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,042
I used the bathroom.

110
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,126
I heard you.

111
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,883
- Are you hungry?
- Not yet.

112
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:29,556
Is there a McDonald's in town?

113
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,975
- You got five dollars?
- No, I don't.

114
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:39,232
Well, then I don't think going into town
for a meal would be a very good idea.

115
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,619
How was your night?

116
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,621
All right, I guess.

117
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,915
Left or right?

118
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,294
Let's do the right.

119
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,589
Left could use a rest.

120
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,307
Pain bad all the time now?

121
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,475
Gets my full attention.

122
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,061
Yep.

123
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,697
What happened with my bear?

124
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,865
It's his own damn bear.

125
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:31,159
You telling me he's still alive?

126
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:34,620
He's fine.
He's in that zoo Angie built.

127
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:58,812
Dreaming about the sea last night.

128
00:15:59,312 --> 00:16:02,231
Did you get wet?

129
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:05,277
I walked right in.

130
00:16:07,653 --> 00:16:09,947
Felt like falling in love.

131
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:15,578
Smelled like a woman.

132
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:18,706
Tasted like one too.

133
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:21,210
Your memory's not that good.

134
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:24,462
Hey.

135
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:27,883
Down there.

136
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:31,845
See Jean kept her looks.

137
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:36,557
Said she brought her daughter with her.

138
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,851
She says it's Griffin's.

139
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,980
Granddaughter.

140
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:46,442
That's a nice thing for a man to have.

141
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,657
I might go into town for breakfast.

142
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,493
All right.

143
00:16:57,913 --> 00:17:00,624
Taking the girl with you?

144
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:03,043
Anything else you need?

145
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:07,213
Yeah, look in on the bear.

146
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:12,719
- What?
- Check on the bear.

147
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:16,890
Check on the...?
Why the hell would I do that?

148
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,892
'Cause I asked you to.

149
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:16,115
Are those my dad's things?

150
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:19,161
Yeah, they are.

151
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,329
Where does he live now?

152
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:27,169
He's dead.
Didn't your mother tell you that?

153
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:30,631
Yeah. But she said you were dead too.

154
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,555
Are you confused about why they call
a room with a table in it a dining room?

155
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,516
No, sir.

156
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:50,317
Since it looks like you didn't have
any trouble making that sandwich,

157
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:54,070
I'd like you to make another one at 11:30.
Will you do that?

158
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:57,824
- Yes, sir.
- And take it to that man in the little house.

159
00:18:57,825 --> 00:19:00,118
And a glass of milk.

160
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,203
Yes, sir.

161
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:07,960
Bear? Goddammit.

162
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,420
"Go check on the bear."

163
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,770
Goddammit.

164
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:53,505
Nice wheels, Einar!

165
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,008
Where did you get the rig?

166
00:19:56,133 --> 00:20:01,012
Nancy Sidwell had this shipped up from
that retirement village where Ernie died.

167
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,723
Maybe it was the bike killed Ernie.

168
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:07,894
What killed Ernie was a lifetime of Nancy's cooking.

169
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,940
- Your pickup broke down again?
- Oh, hell, no. Pickup's fine.

170
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:15,192
I'm just out here training for a goddamn marathon.

171
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:21,657
I like the flag. Without an orange flag
like that, you might look ridiculous.

172
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:51,688
- Hello, Ken, Catherine.
- Einar.

173
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:57,653
What have I got? Bills.

174
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,865
- Morning, Einar.
- Morning yourself, Nina.

175
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,661
Do you believe they're still sending junk mail to my boy?

176
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:09,538
Well, maybe the dead are flattered
to get a letter. Ever think about that?

177
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,916
I'll let you know when I'm gone.

178
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,461
Maybe I'll send you a postcard from the other side.

179
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:18,172
Hey, how's Mitch doing?

180
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,174
Mitch - he's dreaming about the sea.

181
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:23,178
Oh, yeah?
I used to live by the ocean.

182
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:25,596
Up in Oregon for about a year.

183
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:29,976
Yeah, too much rain if you ask me.
But I sure like the sound it makes.

184
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:32,479
- Grandma.
- What's up?

185
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:36,316
If you get depressed, pull up a chair
to your kitchen sink and turn on the tap.

186
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,778
If I ever get depressed,
remind me not to come to you for advice.

187
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,489
Hey!

188
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:48,119
I wonder if it's hard being that drunk
this early in the morning.

189
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:50,913
Oh, it's easy if you don't stop drinking all night.

190
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:55,294
- You'd know. How do you want your eggs?
- Scrambled.

191
00:21:56,336 --> 00:22:00,507
Hey, there, boys.
What can I get you this morning?

192
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:06,136
Get down on this table and I can see if
I can stay on you till the buzzer sounds.

193
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:08,723
Ugh! I hope you're
having a lot of fun, Chris,

194
00:22:08,848 --> 00:22:13,353
'cause soon as I get one arm free,
I'm gonna kick your sorry ass.

195
00:22:13,436 --> 00:22:15,855
Oh, now look what you went and did!

196
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:18,776
Good morning, fellas.

197
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:21,236
I'm gonna be your new waiter.
Want some coffee?

198
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:25,115
- Why don't you screw off, you old bastard?
- What?

199
00:22:29,577 --> 00:22:32,705
Son, now I don't wanna work myself short of breath.

200
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,292
You wanna continue this?
It can be over all at once.

201
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:39,421
Because that's how goddamn fast your life can change.

202
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,589
You believe me?

203
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,888
Sorry for the mess.

204
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:13,913
- Hi.
- Hi.

205
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,714
My name's Griff.

206
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,800
My name is Mitch.

207
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:28,636
That for me?

208
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:38,646
Thank you.

209
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:45,528
Yeah, I know.

210
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:49,365
I almost threw up first time I looked at it.

211
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,076
You feeling a little queasy?

212
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:54,287
I'm fine.

213
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,248
OK.

214
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:00,751
I got queasy first time I saw a man eat a snail.

215
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:03,547
- You ever eat a snail?
- No.

216
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:06,799
Me neither.
This looks good.

217
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:16,184
- What happened to you?
- I was mauled by a bear.

218
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,978
I saw a bear in a cage yesterday.

219
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,190
Yeah. That was my bear.

220
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:27,445
About a year ago, he was eating
one of your grandfather's calves

221
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:32,659
and... well, we sort of
interrupted his dinner, you know.

222
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:35,994
He thought we were gonna take it away from him.

223
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:38,790
You know bears -
they don't like to share.

224
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,295
Did the bear bite Einar?

225
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:46,714
No, I was closer.

226
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,346
- I didn't know anyone ate snails.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

227
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:55,681
In those fancy restaurants up in Cheyenne,

228
00:24:55,682 --> 00:25:00,061
they eat 'em all the time like there's nothing to it.

229
00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:05,483
Once I saw this kid eat a moth.

230
00:25:06,317 --> 00:25:09,654
- You could hear the crunch.
- Oh, no, no!

231
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:20,707
Oh, my gosh! Look at that!

232
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,251
Einar.

233
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:26,253
Hey, Angie.

234
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:28,965
I didn't expect to see you in this crowd.

235
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:33,846
I guess at my age it's good
to be seen just about anywhere.

236
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:37,723
Well, Fish and Game said he'd settle down in a few days.

237
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:41,894
Of course, they also said
he'd eat anything, which he doesn't.

238
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:49,402
I don't get it. Nobody would pay five dollars
for the mountain lion I used to keep in here.

239
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:51,570
How's Mitch?

240
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:54,074
He's dreaming about the sea.

241
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:56,910
I always wanted a boat.

242
00:25:56,993 --> 00:25:59,912
My dad used to take us out.
It was so great.

243
00:25:59,913 --> 00:26:02,124
What happened to the lion?

244
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:05,126
He died.

245
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:09,423
Lucky lion.

246
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:19,724
Hello, Griffin.

247
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:39,869
Well, it says here you might have
already won $15 million.

248
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:43,832
Probably ought to send it in for you, though.

249
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:47,877
Probably the same damn odds as losing a kid early.

250
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:49,962
You got that done.

251
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,552
You should know your wife came back.

252
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:07,189
You could have steered her someplace else.

253
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:12,068
Just 'cause you're dead doesn't mean you can't be useful.

254
00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:16,990
See you tomorrow, boy.

255
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:24,789
Kid sure looks a whole lot like you, though.

256
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,251
Top to bottom.

257
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,965
Mom!

258
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:37,009
- Hey!
- I missed you.

259
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:38,971
- Guess what. I got a job.
- Really?

260
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:42,098
I start tomorrow.
So how was your day?

261
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:45,978
Not so great, huh?

262
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:39,030
Man, I'm tired.

263
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:45,411
I think half the people we served
this morning came in just to look at you.

264
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:47,914
Here you go.

265
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:51,125
- What's this?
- Your half of the tips.

266
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:57,173
I thought you said you were used to being on your feet.

267
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:01,676
I'm not used to telling everyone I meet
where I've been the last ten years.

268
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:03,221
Well...

269
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:05,097
Tell 'em you went crazy.

270
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:08,644
Tell 'em you've been locked up.

271
00:29:10,436 --> 00:29:12,730
That's what I've been telling 'em.

272
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,900
Looks like we did real good today.

273
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:17,528
Guess I got you to thank for that.

274
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:20,948
Maybe I'll have some music on Saturday night.

275
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:26,369
Of course, then again,
you'd have to dance with Billy and Wayne.

276
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:29,288
Oh, that'd be a sight.

277
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:46,722
Can I help you?

278
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:51,519
I'm Einar Gilkyson's daughter-in-law.

279
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,856
Yes, I know.
Did you want to come in?

280
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:00,068
Thank you.

281
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,155
- Any calls?
- Nothing.

282
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:09,246
Homemade lunch, you know.

283
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:19,548
You got something there you want me to see?

284
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:29,891
It's a police report.
But I didn't press charges.

285
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:36,230
A shelter worker in Iowa thought I ought to
check in with authorities when I got settled.

286
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:40,192
He was my boyfriend.

287
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:42,403
But, um...

288
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:45,115
The report's not for this time.

289
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:48,117
It was for another time.

290
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:53,664
I'll make a copy.

291
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,304
That's it.

292
00:31:12,643 --> 00:31:14,728
What are their names?

293
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:18,272
- Who?
- Your cats.

294
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:22,236
They don't have any names.

295
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:26,073
How do you tell 'em apart?

296
00:31:26,906 --> 00:31:28,991
I don't tell 'em apart.

297
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:39,211
Goddamn cheap-ass, Mickey Mouse,
foreign goddamn part...

298
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:41,630
Oscar and Charlie.

299
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:43,798
Hi, Charlie.

300
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:46,634
Is that there a water-pump belt?

301
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:50,055
Why don't you use the one out on the tractor?

302
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,141
Why don't I use the one out on the tractor?

303
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:55,477
Hey, are you mumbling over there or something?

304
00:31:55,602 --> 00:31:57,895
The tractor belt's twice this size.

305
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,772
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,858
Oh.

307
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,193
Don't we have some spare belts in the barn?

308
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:09,240
I got a great idea.
Why don't you go back in the house?

309
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:14,246
Well, uh, damn. I was...
just trying to be helpful.

310
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:18,333
If you don't want my help,
I'll just sit over here and shut up.

311
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:21,545
Pulling that out, it don't look like
you know what you're doing.

312
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,007
Just shut up! OK?
Shut up. You don't know what I'm doing.

313
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:27,593
- You don't know about the truck.
- Who you talking to?

314
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:32,181
- Stop being a philosopher...
- Doggone second-generation immigrant,

315
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:35,642
I bet I come over there and hang my bad foot in your ass.

316
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,279
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

317
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,991
- See you tomorrow?
- Yep. See ya.

318
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,826
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

319
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:56,913
- How was it?
- All right.

320
00:32:57,955 --> 00:33:01,501
- See ya, Einar.
- Got some groceries for dinner.

321
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:06,088
OK.

322
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:12,011
- Do you wanna take these inside, sweetie?
- Sure.

323
00:33:12,136 --> 00:33:13,471
- Got it?
- Yep.

324
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:17,558
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey, there.

325
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:25,901
What happened here?
Why did you stop running cows?

326
00:33:27,236 --> 00:33:29,654
When Griffin died, I ran out of help.

327
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,701
Then I got older, Mitch got mauled,

328
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:39,873
and I sold the stock to stay on the place.

329
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:46,003
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

330
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:50,509
Come here, Sarah.

331
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,845
Nope, stay here.

332
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:56,140
- You finished?
- Yeah.

333
00:33:56,973 --> 00:34:00,519
Tell your kid to come down out of that tree.

334
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:05,605
Come on, Charlie.

335
00:34:05,606 --> 00:34:08,235
Come on.
Don't be a fraidy-cat.

336
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:18,954
Oh, Jesus.

337
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:22,914
I'm sorry.

338
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:26,795
You're sorry, huh?
Well, that's just fine, then.

339
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:31,800
- I'll buy you a new one.
- Oh. Just that easy?

340
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:38,264
Maybe I liked that plate. In fact, maybe
that was my favorite goddamn plate!

341
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:40,432
- It's just a plate.
- That's it, huh?

342
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:44,103
Did it ever occur to you
that not everything can be replaced?

343
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:53,989
Come down out of that tree!

344
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:05,793
- You want this on the table?
- No, over here. Thank you.

345
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:11,297
I'm so glad you're back, Jean.

346
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:22,684
What happened to Nellie?

347
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:27,146
Nellie left.

348
00:35:27,146 --> 00:35:30,275
About a year after we buried Griffin.

349
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:34,570
Einar just never got a handle on it.

350
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:38,407
And then, when he hardly
even noticed Nellie anymore, why...

351
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:41,619
She found another man.
Who wouldn't?

352
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:45,289
Think they live in Colorado.

353
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,920
Do you think he blames me for losing his wife too?

354
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:53,005
I imagine he does.

355
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:05,936
I don't want to stay here.

356
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:10,440
What's wrong with him?

357
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,360
Well, it's not you.

358
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:16,572
He just never got over it.

359
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,536
He really loved your dad.
You should know that.

360
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,038
- Did you?
- Of course.

361
00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:30,126
You do have a plan, though, right?

362
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:33,045
I mean, we don't have to stay here forever?

363
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:35,340
Sure, I do.

364
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:39,427
Soon as I earn enough money,
I'm gonna get us right out of here.

365
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,847
You know what?
What do you think about...

366
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:44,932
Butt, Montana?

367
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,400
Come on, let's play.
You don't know how to read anymore?

368
00:36:56,402 --> 00:36:58,070
Where'd the bottle come from?

369
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:01,324
The granary.

370
00:37:01,407 --> 00:37:04,952
It's been there for a while.
Sometimes I just like to look at it.

371
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:07,039
15, two.

372
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:09,541
You gonna open it?

373
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm not sure yet. 25.

374
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,670
31 for two. Go.

375
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:18,507
- Did you check on the bear?
- Eight.

376
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:21,344
Yeah, you asked me to, didn't you?

377
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:24,056
Here's a pair for two.

378
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:27,059
I want you to feed him.

379
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:30,311
- What?
- I want you to feed the bear.

380
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:33,856
I don't trust Angie to feed anything much past herself.

381
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,027
"Feed the bear." "Please feed the bear."
"Bear, do you like bear shoes?"

382
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:42,824
"What kind of food do you like, Bear?
Steak, chicken?"

383
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,909
- Einar.
- What?

384
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:48,121
Is her being here gonna ruin you?

385
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:53,876
- The woman killed my son.
- Oh, come on.

386
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,340
It was a car accident. They call them
accidents because it's nobody's fault.

387
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:02,844
No, they call them accidents
to make the guilty feel better.

388
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:06,389
- Is that so?
- I don't give a damn what they call them.

389
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:08,349
My son's dead.

390
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:11,603
Your granddaughter's not.

391
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:13,688
And neither were you.

392
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:19,193
Have you thought about how she's gonna remember you?

393
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:25,659
You know, come to think of it,
I don't feel like playing cards tonight.

394
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:29,413
Put that bottle someplace
where I don't have to look at it.

395
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:31,557
You know anything about pickup trucks?

396
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:35,311
Aw, shit.

397
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:40,023
Hand me that half-inch
socket wrench, would you?

398
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:42,610
No, no, no.
Shiny one on the top.

399
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:45,114
Yep.

400
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:48,992
Do you wanna see what I'm doing?

401
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:55,331
That's it.

402
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,418
- OK, see these screws here?
- Mm-hm.

403
00:39:59,418 --> 00:40:04,382
This one I'm tightening, this holds
this thing up which holds the pan up.

404
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:08,262
If this thing comes loose when you're
driving, you'll be sitting on the road.

405
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:11,304
And that's not what you want to be doing...

406
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:13,474
How come you and Einar don't get along?

407
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,103
You're practically his daughter.

408
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:18,813
What I am is his dead son's wife.

409
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:25,070
He's always been really good to me.
He's the first friend I met here.

410
00:40:26,947 --> 00:40:29,740
I am not in the mood for their crap.

411
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:32,034
I'll take 'em.

412
00:40:34,036 --> 00:40:38,208
- The special today is the enchilada plate.
- Thank you.

413
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:42,253
They're good enchiladas.
Served by good people.

414
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:45,173
I'm a good person.

415
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:51,012
I'm also a woman who's taken more
than her fair share of shit off men.

416
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:53,222
Don't push me.

417
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:57,559
I mean, I couldn't even take a pinch of crap
from two little cheesedicks like you.

418
00:40:57,561 --> 00:41:01,440
OK, crank it.

419
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,525
Again.

420
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:05,902
Again.

421
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,289
Take your foot off the gas.

422
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:20,626
Take your foot off the gas!

423
00:41:27,423 --> 00:41:29,592
Is that for lunch?

424
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:32,094
It's for a bear.

425
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:35,641
Who the hell knows what a bear eats anyway?

426
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:52,324
Did I ask you to do that?

427
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:55,451
Don't bears like honey?

428
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:57,663
Winnie the Pooh does.

429
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:17,266
- Oh, hey.
- Thought you were sick.

430
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,851
Haven't seen you for a few days.

431
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:25,398
It's only a two-restaurant town, so I try
to spread the county's money around.

432
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:29,777
Meatloaf. Can I have onion rings
instead of mashed potatoes?

433
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:32,697
Onion... Sure, I'll ask.

434
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:38,327
Could you give me a ride home after work?

435
00:42:39,454 --> 00:42:40,914
Sure.

436
00:42:44,793 --> 00:42:47,045
He looks like he's dancing.

437
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,088
Well, maybe just happy to see a girl with a sack of meat.

438
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,635
I'll give you some here.
Why don't you toss this in?

439
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,527
- He likes the honey.
- I think he does.

440
00:43:10,652 --> 00:43:14,905
Is that really the bear
that hurt Mr. Bradley?

441
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:17,201
He's the one.

442
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:36,302
I don't wanna go right home.

443
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:38,806
- Not just yet.
- You don't?

444
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:41,266
Can't we just drive a little?

445
00:43:52,568 --> 00:43:55,697
Here's the thing.
I'm gonna be here about three more weeks.

446
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,492
I'm afraid I'm not gonna get through it.

447
00:44:01,077 --> 00:44:03,163
Three weeks, huh?

448
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:08,501
I don't wanna be in love, Crane.

449
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,362
Don't start without me.

450
00:44:39,782 --> 00:44:42,909
- What's that?
- A flower.

451
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:44,996
That's not a flower - it's a weed.

452
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,001
It's pretty, though.

453
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:54,922
- Don't you think it's pretty?
- Yeah, I think it's lovely.

454
00:44:54,922 --> 00:44:57,384
You want to wait a little longer for your mother?

455
00:44:57,509 --> 00:45:00,012
- Just a little bit.
- OK.

456
00:45:05,726 --> 00:45:08,353
I had a music teacher who was a lesbian.

457
00:45:16,152 --> 00:45:18,489
You guys are gay, right?

458
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:28,581
I'd think after 40 years of working together,
one of us would notice, don't you?

459
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:33,170
Well, Einar, I always thought
you had really lovely hands.

460
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:36,297
You did? You never told me that.

461
00:45:36,422 --> 00:45:40,050
I mean, it's cool.
Everybody needs love.

462
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:42,471
You got that part right, little girl.

463
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:45,891
Jeez, what's next?

464
00:45:46,641 --> 00:45:48,518
Hey!

465
00:45:50,478 --> 00:45:54,358
- Hey, yourself. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

466
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,195
Good. There's somebody
I want you to meet.

467
00:45:59,445 --> 00:46:02,365
Griff, this is Sheriff Curtis.

468
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,659
Nice to meet you, Griff.

469
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:09,248
- Are you hungry?
- There isn't enough.

470
00:46:09,373 --> 00:46:13,751
I gotta swing back
through town anyway. So I'll see ya.

471
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:17,588
- Thanks for the ride home.
- Take care of yourself, Crane.

472
00:46:19,257 --> 00:46:21,342
- I don't like him.
- I don't remember asking.

473
00:46:21,467 --> 00:46:23,554
I don't remember you ever asking me.

474
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:26,472
Hey, I don't need your permission.

475
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:33,146
You confused about how to treat a guest in my house?

476
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,315
It's just some guy my mom brought home.

477
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,277
I expect you to be pleasant to whoever comes to my door.

478
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:45,657
Yes, sir.

479
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:49,204
Unless it's some guy looking to sell his angle on God.

480
00:46:49,288 --> 00:46:52,541
There's no excuse for that bullshit.

481
00:46:55,543 --> 00:47:01,592
Well, all right, then. Let's give a try
at these good-looking sandwiches.

482
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:29,744
There you go.
Hold it right about here.

483
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:30,996
OK.

484
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:36,001
- His foot's not gonna go anywhere.
- Oh, yes, it is. Look at that calf run.

485
00:47:36,126 --> 00:47:38,003
He's off and gone.

486
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,090
Oops. That's a little bit low.

487
00:47:47,054 --> 00:47:49,764
- Yeah!
- I got it!

488
00:47:51,224 --> 00:47:53,851
- Look at that!
- Oh, yeah.

489
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:57,606
Go on, try it again.
There you go.

490
00:48:02,402 --> 00:48:05,947
You got any more improvements you wanna make around here?

491
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,240
I thought I'd straighten some of this mess.

492
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:10,617
Thought Mitch might want to work on something.

493
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,581
- Did you ask him about it?
- Well, of course she did.

494
00:48:15,623 --> 00:48:18,668
Now that we've got interesting company around here, I...

495
00:48:18,751 --> 00:48:20,838
I feel inspired.

496
00:48:23,548 --> 00:48:26,050
Excuse me.
I gotta go to work.

497
00:48:39,523 --> 00:48:41,608
You wanna know what I dreamed last night?

498
00:48:41,692 --> 00:48:43,693
What?

499
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:48,157
I dreamed you weren't such a miserable son of a bitch.

500
00:48:48,907 --> 00:48:52,952
That's not dreaming.
That's wishful thinking.

501
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:57,875
Did you hear anything unusual last night?

502
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:02,045
Yeah. Somebody poking around
down by the river.

503
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,590
I found some footprints.

504
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:08,719
This.

505
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:18,603
I sure do miss smoking.

506
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:21,648
So do I.

507
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:31,324
Hey.

508
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:35,411
Hey! What are you doing here?

509
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:39,039
- We're going to Angie's zoo.
- Really?

510
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,251
What kind of pies you got today, Nina?

511
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:45,088
Hey! I got three kinds of berry
and chocolate pecan.

512
00:49:45,213 --> 00:49:48,215
Guaranteed to make your teeth ache.

513
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:51,885
Chocolate pecan, please.
With ice cream.

514
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:55,224
Two chocolate pecan, one with ice cream.
Kid's got young teeth.

515
00:49:55,431 --> 00:49:57,391
Coming right up.

516
00:50:00,436 --> 00:50:02,396
Be right back.

517
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:04,398
Crane.

518
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:08,653
Einar.

519
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:13,367
She capture your interest?

520
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:17,329
Have you thought about the girl?
They're a set.

521
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:19,706
Can I get you anything else, Crane?

522
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:21,916
No. Just the check.

523
00:50:23,043 --> 00:50:24,836
OK.

524
00:50:29,715 --> 00:50:34,637
How does the law stand on shooting
somebody on your property?

525
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:40,268
Well, if you didn't want to go to prison,
they'd have to be in your house.

526
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:43,688
- That's what I thought.
- You think you got a problem?

527
00:50:43,813 --> 00:50:45,983
I'll let you know.

528
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,530
Hey.

529
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:54,032
You wanna hand me that rasp?

530
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:00,164
No, those are pliers.
The rasp, next to...

531
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:03,833
- This?
- That's it. Yep.

532
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:07,045
Are there really cowgirls?

533
00:51:09,672 --> 00:51:12,175
Haven't you ever ridden a horse before?

534
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:16,847
No. There weren't any horses
around Gary's apartment.

535
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:21,349
He was my mom's boyfriend.

536
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:23,936
We lived with him for two years.

537
00:51:26,023 --> 00:51:28,858
My mom had another boyfriend before Gary.

538
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:32,695
His name was Hank.
He didn't have any horses either.

539
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:36,240
Hank didn't hit my mom like Gary did.

540
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:38,744
He was just mean with his words.

541
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:40,829
Like you.

542
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:51,672
I can see where not learning to ride a horse
would be a disadvantage for a cowgirl.

543
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:53,550
- You wanna try?
- Yeah.

544
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:55,844
Here, grab that blanket.

545
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,572
What's that?

546
00:52:18,157 --> 00:52:20,577
Wanna have a look?

547
00:52:28,293 --> 00:52:30,461
Good afternoon, boy.

548
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:37,969
Your father was sure first-rate.

549
00:52:38,094 --> 00:52:40,179
I miss him.

550
00:52:41,222 --> 00:52:43,391
I wish I missed him.

551
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:50,188
You would if you'd known him.

552
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,858
Stay.

553
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:08,750
Your mom's boyfriend in Iowa, he smoke?

554
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:11,878
Yeah, a lot.

555
00:53:17,717 --> 00:53:20,010
Did he hit you?

556
00:53:20,012 --> 00:53:21,972
Mostly my mom.

557
00:53:23,014 --> 00:53:25,934
Jimmy. Jimmy, no, no.

558
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:35,244
My parents scraped and saved to get us out of El Paso.

559
00:53:35,327 --> 00:53:39,289
To get a quiet place, far away from everything.

560
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:43,793
Then they put an interstate through it.

561
00:53:43,793 --> 00:53:46,713
This would have killed them.

562
00:53:46,797 --> 00:53:49,717
- I remember your parents.
- You do?

563
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:56,179
- Yeah, they were good people.
- What a mess. Did you know Griffin?

564
00:53:56,181 --> 00:53:57,432
Yeah.

565
00:53:57,557 --> 00:54:01,394
He was two years behind me in high school.

566
00:54:02,771 --> 00:54:04,856
Do you know how he died?

567
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,610
Yeah, it was, uh...

568
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,447
Up in Calgary at the stampede.
A car accident.

569
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:19,036
Guess everybody in town knows that.

570
00:54:19,038 --> 00:54:21,748
Well, it was a long time ago.

571
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,088
I was driving, you know.

572
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:36,347
Guess everybody in town knows that too.

573
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:52,905
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

574
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,494
Well, I'm not so sure I'm happy
to see you in here, Einar.

575
00:54:59,577 --> 00:55:02,081
How about a club soda, Eileen?

576
00:55:02,206 --> 00:55:04,375
I can do that for you.

577
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:18,554
- I hear you have a granddaughter.
- Yeah. By God, I do.

578
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:21,056
How old is she?

579
00:55:21,057 --> 00:55:25,853
She's still shiny. She still expects
everything's gonna turn out all right.

580
00:55:25,853 --> 00:55:28,983
- Shit!
- That's a good age.

581
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:31,610
Here, buy yourself a fucking drink.

582
00:55:31,693 --> 00:55:34,195
You're one lucky son of a bitch.

583
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:38,909
You know those guys?

584
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:41,829
The one in the hat is Jed Spear's boy, Josh.

585
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:44,206
And the other guy?

586
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:46,916
Some dude from the Midwest.

587
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:03,182
Einar.

588
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:06,436
- Her ex-boyfriend's in town.
- Yeah, I know he is.

589
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:08,813
He's staying down at the Sage Creek Motel.

590
00:56:08,938 --> 00:56:11,025
Why in the hell didn't you arrest him?

591
00:56:11,108 --> 00:56:14,987
'Cause I can't do anything, except keep
an eye on him. Unless he bothers her.

592
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,364
Does she know he's here?

593
00:56:17,489 --> 00:56:19,574
I haven't told her yet.

594
00:56:19,574 --> 00:56:23,202
Look, if he'd been out at your place,
I could make that enough.

595
00:56:23,202 --> 00:56:26,248
You'd let me know if he'd been out there bothering you?

596
00:56:26,331 --> 00:56:28,833
Oh, he doesn't bother me one little bit.

597
00:56:31,336 --> 00:56:33,547
Jesus.

598
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,887
Here.

599
00:56:53,858 --> 00:56:56,070
Bad news.

600
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:57,820
Bad news.

601
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,822
That's 15-2,

602
00:56:59,822 --> 00:57:01,367
15-4...

603
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:06,914
That's two runs of three and a pair which puts me out.

604
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:12,001
- I haven't had a decent hand all night.
- Well, don't growl. You dealt half of them.

605
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:14,630
I'm not growling.
Give it here.

606
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:23,806
- You want some help getting to bed?
- No, I'll manage that.

607
00:57:38,612 --> 00:57:41,114
I always thought this was one of your best.

608
00:57:42,865 --> 00:57:44,742
Why, thank you.

609
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:52,668
Ever wish you'd lived a different life rather
than living up here and working with me?

610
00:57:52,793 --> 00:57:54,668
No.

611
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:58,298
I was always happy that I found work that suited me.

612
00:57:59,132 --> 00:58:04,137
Since I was a kid, all I ever wanted to be was a cowboy.

613
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:06,639
Shit.

614
00:58:06,764 --> 00:58:09,768
- How about now?
- Now too.

615
00:58:13,646 --> 00:58:17,192
Mind if I leave Griff here with you
for a while till her mother comes home?

616
00:58:17,275 --> 00:58:19,777
There's an errand in town I'd like to run.

617
00:58:19,903 --> 00:58:24,365
Be all right with me if she stayed up here all the time.

618
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,460
Hey.

619
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,380
Be careful with that errand.

620
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:10,170
Yeah?

621
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,889
Take it easy, buddy.
What do you want?

622
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:25,686
I'm helping you pack.

623
00:59:29,648 --> 00:59:32,150
You don't know how much I love her.

624
00:59:32,275 --> 00:59:36,237
Your love was written all over her face
when she got here.

625
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:40,909
There's nothing more useless than running
after a woman that doesn't want you.

626
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:45,289
She wanted me to find her. If she didn't,
she wouldn't have come back here.

627
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:47,791
Pull over. Here.

628
01:00:02,722 --> 01:00:06,559
Keep going.
I see you back here again, I'll kill you.

629
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:10,231
You've seen too many westerns, old man.

630
01:00:10,313 --> 01:00:13,025
That doesn't exactly work in your favor.

631
01:00:23,034 --> 01:00:26,163
- You need a ride?
- A ride would be fine.

632
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,378
- That man threaten you?
- Yeah, he sure as hell did.

633
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:36,923
Jean Gilkyson's a friend of mine.
She doesn't want you here.

634
01:00:37,007 --> 01:00:41,094
- You don't know her like I do.
- No, you're right. I don't.

635
01:00:41,177 --> 01:00:45,474
I'll make this simple for you -
I don't want you here.

636
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,018
Now, get going.

637
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:06,202
Is this something we're gonna have to talk a lot about?

638
01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:07,996
No, Einar.

639
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,208
We never have to talk about this again.

640
01:01:13,918 --> 01:01:14,878
Jean?

641
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:17,797
Jean?

642
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,721
- What?
- Get dressed. I wanna talk to you.

643
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,190
What is it?

644
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,655
Just had a chat with your ex-boyfriend.

645
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,865
Thought you oughta know he was in town.

646
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:46,159
- You mean Gary's here?
- He was.

647
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:51,248
- Gary's in town?
- He left.

648
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,126
Well, we should call Crane.

649
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,420
Crane knows all about it.

650
01:01:59,297 --> 01:02:02,217
- I'm sorry.
- Tell me something. I'm a little confused.

651
01:02:02,217 --> 01:02:05,971
By bachelor number one and bachelor number two.

652
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:10,351
Are you screwing Crane Curtis for protection or sport?

653
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:17,858
Would you like to ask your daughter
how she feels about it?

654
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,568
Don't bring Griff into this.
You don't know anything about her.

655
01:02:20,568 --> 01:02:24,407
- And whose fault is that?
- Oh, it's my fault, Einar. Right?

656
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:28,284
Isn't it my fault?
Isn't everything my fault?

657
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:43,509
Griffin flipped a coin.

658
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,137
What are you talking about?

659
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,684
Griffin flipped a coin and I lost.

660
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,481
So I was the one driving.

661
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:02,777
It was three o'clock in the morning
and we were both tired.

662
01:03:02,902 --> 01:03:07,364
We wanted to make it down to the rodeo in Great Falls.

663
01:03:07,365 --> 01:03:09,577
It was a flipped coin?

664
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:12,996
What was it - a quarter?
Was it a nickel?

665
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:16,333
- I don't remember what it was.
- I wanna know what killed my boy!

666
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:18,626
I killed him, Einar.

667
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,047
Is that what you wanna hear?

668
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:24,173
It wasn't the change in our pockets

669
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,092
or the weak-ass coffee or the rain.

670
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,262
It was me.

671
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:35,728
I fell asleep and I flipped the car six times.

672
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,606
I killed Griffin.

673
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:43,777
You got no argument from me.

674
01:03:45,237 --> 01:03:48,157
You think it's something I forget?

675
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,411
You think I'm not sick with it every day of my life?

676
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,666
But I tried to keep living and you haven't.

677
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,086
Is that why you hate me so much?

678
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,923
You know, you act like I killed you the day Griffin died.

679
01:04:05,048 --> 01:04:06,717
Well, great.

680
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,054
Lie all the way down and we'll bury you.

681
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:15,559
What's the matter? You're afraid
no one will come to the funeral?

682
01:04:16,101 --> 01:04:20,356
- We'll talk about your leaving tomorrow.
- We're done talking.

683
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,175
Just so you know,

684
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:32,719
I have been trying.

685
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:37,932
But forgiving...

686
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:42,103
just isn't easy for me.

687
01:05:46,483 --> 01:05:48,902
Son of a bitch.
What the hell did he call it?

688
01:05:48,902 --> 01:05:53,072
What - does he think he's a preacher
or some goddamn thing?

689
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,159
Know-it-all.

690
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,083
I'm sorry we woke you up so early.

691
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:06,628
That's OK. I'm not
a great sleeper anyway.

692
01:06:10,173 --> 01:06:13,302
Hey, I got a regular mattress out in the storage shed.

693
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:17,139
Maybe you and I can wrestle it in here after work.

694
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,278
Did you drink the whole bottle?

695
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:37,076
She left. She walked out of here
and took the kid.

696
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,829
That her idea or yours?

697
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:43,833
I didn't drink the whole thing.

698
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:47,503
Which side of your ass you want
the needle in this morning?

699
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:48,838
Left.

700
01:06:54,592 --> 01:06:57,722
Well, what'd you dream about last night?

701
01:06:57,804 --> 01:06:59,889
I didn't dream at all.

702
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:06,896
I lay awake all night, wondering if you'd
ever stop blaming the world for whatever.

703
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:11,485
Wondering if you'd be able
to hold on to the family you've got.

704
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:14,697
I managed to hang on to you, didn't I?

705
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:18,784
Have you ever wondered why I'm the only one left?

706
01:07:20,452 --> 01:07:24,206
Well, I have my boy.
I have his memories.

707
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:28,460
Yeah.

708
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,965
Maybe he'll remember how desperately
he wanted to get out of here.

709
01:07:33,048 --> 01:07:36,092
How bad he wanted a life of his own.

710
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,887
If you weren't a cripple,
I'd jerk you out and kick your ass.

711
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:41,097
Oh, talk sense.

712
01:07:41,097 --> 01:07:45,061
I never saw the day you thought
you could kick my ass, Einar.

713
01:07:47,353 --> 01:07:49,523
- Einar!
- What?

714
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,610
I wanna go see the bear.

715
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,612
You've seen the bear.

716
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,532
- I want you to take me to Angie's.
- You're not up to it.

717
01:07:59,657 --> 01:08:02,244
I'm not asking permission, goddammit!
I want a ride!

718
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,913
Well, then call a taxi.

719
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,253
- I'm going back.
- What?

720
01:08:12,253 --> 01:08:15,172
I'm staying with my grandpa
and Mr. Bradley.

721
01:08:15,173 --> 01:08:17,385
- The hell you are, Griff.
- Yes, I am.

722
01:08:17,467 --> 01:08:19,261
No, you're not!

723
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,639
You're not going anywhere.
You're staying right here.

724
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,140
I'm going back, OK?

725
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:30,730
You make decisions like they don't matter
for anybody else but you!

726
01:08:31,564 --> 01:08:36,362
That is not true.
I always think about you first.

727
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,989
Then it should start to show.

728
01:08:45,328 --> 01:08:49,792
Griff! Get back here!
I'm not gonna say it again.

729
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,668
Let her go.

730
01:08:51,793 --> 01:08:55,840
Let her go be with her grandfather for a while.

731
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,594
Do you think I'm a shitty mother?

732
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,724
I think you're doing the best you can.

733
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:16,819
That's her second-grade picture.

734
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:18,779
Of your daughter?

735
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,573
Yeah.

736
01:09:21,489 --> 01:09:27,244
We were having a picnic at the river
and she went for a swim.

737
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,539
She wanted to practice.

738
01:09:29,622 --> 01:09:32,126
She was a great swimmer.

739
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,881
And I, uh...

740
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,885
I looked away for a minute.

741
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,637
And she was... gone.

742
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,350
She was...

743
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,987
I would do anything to have that minute back.

744
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:03,323
But I'm never gonna.

745
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:11,664
- Nina, I'm...
- We're not supposed to outlive our children.

746
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,418
You have to understand that about Einar.

747
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:29,475
- Where's your mother?
- She's staying with Nina.

748
01:10:31,976 --> 01:10:35,021
You walked all the way out here by yourself?

749
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,399
I got hungry.

750
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,865
Want one egg or two?
We got a lot to do today.

751
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:48,243
How about two?

752
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,711
What are we gonna do with that?

753
01:10:56,793 --> 01:11:00,881
You spread it around so we don't have to walk in it.

754
01:11:02,757 --> 01:11:06,095
Here, slide on over here and take the wheel.

755
01:11:06,177 --> 01:11:08,180
- Come on.
- I can't drive.

756
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,100
You're not gonna be driving.
You're gonna be steering.

757
01:11:11,182 --> 01:11:13,185
Come on. You can do it.

758
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:18,606
Turn before you get to that fence.
Don't touch anything else.

759
01:11:41,622 --> 01:11:43,164
Yeah.

760
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:46,210
OK.

761
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:51,422
- Set.
- Yeah.

762
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,926
Six o'clock in the morning, I wake up to gunfire.

763
01:11:53,926 --> 01:11:57,386
And I look out the window
and everything's shot to hell in the yard.

764
01:11:57,387 --> 01:11:59,681
- Jonesy, it's pottery.
- Still, man.

765
01:11:59,765 --> 01:12:03,519
Shouldn't you be catching people
who are shooting the neighborhood up?

766
01:12:03,644 --> 01:12:07,480
Why the hell didn't you tell me Gary was in town?

767
01:12:07,605 --> 01:12:09,774
Excuse me.

768
01:12:11,777 --> 01:12:15,947
- I didn't think you'd want to see him.
- Well, I had a right to know.

769
01:12:15,948 --> 01:12:18,533
I just... I would have thought
you'd had enough of him.

770
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:22,412
Come on, Crane. Why don't you ask me
what you really wanna know?

771
01:12:22,412 --> 01:12:24,872
Why didn't I just walk away the first time he hit me?

772
01:12:24,998 --> 01:12:27,917
Why didn't I just call the police? Right?
It's so simple.

773
01:12:27,917 --> 01:12:32,088
- Crane, are you gonna deal with this?
- Just give me a second here.

774
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:33,340
Jean.

775
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:36,676
I couldn't care less about his personal problems.

776
01:13:05,663 --> 01:13:09,125
There's a buffalo over there.
His name is Ronnie.

777
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:11,627
And then there's two wolves.

778
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:13,881
Tom and Jerry.

779
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,095
Come on. Look.

780
01:13:21,846 --> 01:13:23,806
Food.

781
01:13:25,184 --> 01:13:27,144
Come on.

782
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:31,439
Aren't you hungry?

783
01:13:34,025 --> 01:13:35,903
You had enough?

784
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:39,030
Yeah.

785
01:13:40,698 --> 01:13:42,993
Yeah, I've had all I need.

786
01:14:07,725 --> 01:14:10,185
No, no, no, that's OK.

787
01:14:10,186 --> 01:14:15,234
I gotta run to the feed store for a minute.
You think you can fix Mitch some lunch?

788
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:16,694
Sure.

789
01:14:16,777 --> 01:14:18,779
OK, then.

790
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:30,123
Einar?

791
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,001
Einar!

792
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,297
- Mitch?
- Griff.

793
01:14:38,673 --> 01:14:42,217
- Get Einar for me.
- He went to town.

794
01:14:42,219 --> 01:14:44,095
Oh, no.

795
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,806
Do you know where he keeps my medicine?

796
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:49,309
- In the refrigerator?
- Go get it for me.

797
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:52,770
- Right now?
- Quick as you can.

798
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:54,523
OK.

799
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:10,287
- OK.
- OK. Good girl.

800
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:13,292
Do you... you know how to load it?

801
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:17,671
Yeah, just... That's it.

802
01:15:21,007 --> 01:15:22,676
OK.

803
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:34,771
Pull the pants down,
stick it in me and push the plunger down.

804
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,586
Was that OK?

805
01:16:01,047 --> 01:16:05,010
It was so smooth, I thought my mom had done it.

806
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,931
Thank you.

807
01:16:15,645 --> 01:16:17,648
Hey.

808
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,569
Jean.

809
01:16:23,362 --> 01:16:27,824
As it turns out, you're right.
I'm a complete asshole.

810
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:33,788
I never judged you for being with him, though.

811
01:16:33,913 --> 01:16:36,000
You're wrong about that.

812
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:39,211
You made it stop.
You left him.

813
01:16:45,884 --> 01:16:49,012
You wanna know the ugly little truth?

814
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:56,311
You stay because you don't think you deserve any better.

815
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:00,899
'Cause you think it's the best you can do.

816
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,877
It's Mr. Bradley.

817
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:32,931
How you doing?

818
01:17:33,765 --> 01:17:36,894
We can't just leave him there, Einar.

819
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:41,774
We walked into his business.

820
01:17:42,815 --> 01:17:46,277
Hell, he was just doing what bears do.

821
01:17:46,278 --> 01:17:48,780
We can't punish him for that.

822
01:17:51,992 --> 01:17:55,119
You got to let him go, Einar.

823
01:17:55,246 --> 01:17:57,497
Get him out of that cage.

824
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,962
Don't you lie here and think I can do that.

825
01:18:12,637 --> 01:18:16,516
You know, I can get myself shaved in the morning.

826
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,395
- All the way dressed too.
- OK.

827
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,275
Could probably manage to stick myself
in the butt with one of those syringes.

828
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:30,780
But what I can't do is continue
to lie here every day and watch you mourn

829
01:18:30,863 --> 01:18:34,243
for a life you think you should have had.

830
01:18:39,038 --> 01:18:44,877
There are people everywhere
who think they got dealt a bad hand, Einar.

831
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,742
Hey.

832
01:18:59,576 --> 01:19:01,453
Did I give him too much?

833
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:03,622
No.

834
01:19:03,747 --> 01:19:05,916
You did great today.

835
01:19:28,646 --> 01:19:30,399
Goddamn bear.

836
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:37,613
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

837
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:41,702
I never do anything right.

838
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:49,167
Well, what do you think?

839
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,056
Attagirl.

840
01:20:05,684 --> 01:20:09,729
- Right, let's try third. Let the clutch out.
- Third?

841
01:20:09,854 --> 01:20:12,649
Now, let's go to the left.

842
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,859
Not too hard.

843
01:20:15,694 --> 01:20:19,655
OK, that's good.
You're getting the hang of it.

844
01:20:21,492 --> 01:20:25,496
There you go. I think we're
gonna get this thing done.

845
01:20:25,996 --> 01:20:29,247
Hey, Griff.
How's life on the ranch?

846
01:20:29,248 --> 01:20:31,417
It's good.

847
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:34,546
Jean, you got two customers out here.

848
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:38,925
Hey.

849
01:20:38,926 --> 01:20:42,470
- We're just visiting, OK?
- OK.

850
01:20:48,519 --> 01:20:52,480
I miss you.
What you been doing?

851
01:20:52,605 --> 01:20:54,692
Einar's been teaching me how to drive.

852
01:20:54,774 --> 01:21:00,404
Why don't you go look to see
what Nina's got in the kitchen for special?

853
01:21:00,405 --> 01:21:02,408
- OK?
- OK.

854
01:21:06,244 --> 01:21:09,163
Would you care if I took her camping?

855
01:21:09,288 --> 01:21:12,501
Thanks for bringing her in, Einar.

856
01:21:14,293 --> 01:21:17,631
- Did she say driving?
- It's a ranch.

857
01:21:17,715 --> 01:21:20,551
- She's 11.
- I know, I know. She...

858
01:21:21,592 --> 01:21:24,054
But she's a good girl.

859
01:21:26,265 --> 01:21:29,600
Good kids don't get that way by accident.

860
01:21:36,274 --> 01:21:40,654
- Is that a compliment?
- It's just the way it is.

861
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,787
What else you been teaching her?

862
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,750
I don't know enough

863
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:56,377
to know what to teach a girl.

864
01:21:58,588 --> 01:22:00,673
What I'm saying...

865
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:04,845
is if you wanna come back to the ranch, that's...

866
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:07,264
that's gonna be OK.

867
01:22:15,396 --> 01:22:17,983
Maybe tomorrow then, when you get back.

868
01:22:20,194 --> 01:22:22,904
Tomorrow would be fine.

869
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:26,617
I think camping would be great.

870
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:28,952
She'll love that.

871
01:22:35,501 --> 01:22:39,128
- Do you want all of these?
- Yep, all of 'em. Hold on to those.

872
01:22:39,253 --> 01:22:41,130
What's the medicine for?

873
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:43,966
When we get that bear in the cage,
I'm gonna give him a shot.

874
01:22:43,966 --> 01:22:48,346
That way, he can sleep all the way up to the mountain.

875
01:23:01,694 --> 01:23:03,985
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

876
01:23:03,987 --> 01:23:06,907
- Jesus Christ, Gary.
- How are ya?

877
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:12,829
God, you look great.

878
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:18,042
I thought you left town.

879
01:23:18,877 --> 01:23:22,006
Well, I wanted to see you.

880
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:24,216
You know I miss you.

881
01:23:25,466 --> 01:23:30,139
I don't want you here, Gary.
Can't you understand that?

882
01:23:34,851 --> 01:23:38,814
Must be nice for Griff,
living up here with her grandfather.

883
01:23:38,896 --> 01:23:41,524
Country living and all.

884
01:23:41,608 --> 01:23:44,444
Of course, it's not for you.

885
01:23:44,528 --> 01:23:46,613
Just give it up, Gary.

886
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:49,867
I'm not coming back to you.

887
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:53,494
Can we just at least sit down?
Have a drink or some kind of...

888
01:23:53,619 --> 01:23:56,206
Offer me a coffee or some...

889
01:24:02,546 --> 01:24:06,007
It's pretty country up here.

890
01:24:06,132 --> 01:24:08,426
Might stick around a while.

891
01:24:38,332 --> 01:24:40,541
We're gonna get caught.

892
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,337
These are government guys we're stealing this from.

893
01:24:43,462 --> 01:24:46,673
They went home to dinner a long time ago.

894
01:24:47,632 --> 01:24:50,219
I thought you said we're just borrowing it.

895
01:24:50,344 --> 01:24:54,681
As long as I pay my taxes,
it's the same thing. Let's go.

896
01:25:26,296 --> 01:25:30,259
OK, now scoot on over and get ready to back up.

897
01:25:33,177 --> 01:25:35,805
Come on ahead. Easy.

898
01:25:35,889 --> 01:25:37,890
Come on.

899
01:25:42,895 --> 01:25:44,981
Whoa.

900
01:25:45,064 --> 01:25:46,315
OK.

901
01:26:07,087 --> 01:26:09,047
Here.

902
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:14,177
Hold that still.

903
01:26:14,261 --> 01:26:17,805
- When I tell you, you start cranking.
- OK.

904
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:39,703
- I'm a little bit scared.
- That makes two of us.

905
01:26:40,453 --> 01:26:42,622
Start cranking.

906
01:27:02,768 --> 01:27:05,020
OK, now get in the truck.

907
01:27:19,618 --> 01:27:22,037
OK.

908
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:39,887
Come on.

909
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,917
Einar!

910
01:28:10,002 --> 01:28:12,627
- Get behind me. Get behind me.
- Einar, I'm sorry.

911
01:28:12,628 --> 01:28:14,590
Get in the truck.

912
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:19,927
Walk slowly and don't look right at him.
Get in the truck!

913
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,890
Go on.

914
01:28:28,145 --> 01:28:30,355
Look here.

915
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:55,672
- Einar!
- Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

916
01:28:57,048 --> 01:28:59,342
Are you OK?

917
01:28:59,426 --> 01:29:02,470
I think that he went through an artery.

918
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:08,185
I think you'd better get me to a hospital.

919
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:15,693
- Oh!
- Sorry.

920
01:29:21,532 --> 01:29:23,617
Hello?

921
01:29:25,202 --> 01:29:27,162
What?

922
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:31,958
I was just trying to pull... Oh!

923
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:35,168
Pull the, uh, loft door down.

924
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:37,506
You know, to keep the bats out.

925
01:29:37,588 --> 01:29:40,009
'Cause once those bats get in the rafters,

926
01:29:40,091 --> 01:29:43,845
then you can't hardly get 'em out.

927
01:29:45,014 --> 01:29:46,974
And that's when he fell.

928
01:29:47,807 --> 01:29:50,101
Right. That's when I fell.

929
01:29:50,935 --> 01:29:53,939
It was just dumb.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

930
01:29:54,064 --> 01:29:57,609
- Let's try this again, Einar.
- Hmm? Oh, Jesus, no...

931
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:06,284
I hit the gearshift.

932
01:30:08,453 --> 01:30:11,372
- I didn't mean to.
- It wasn't your fault.

933
01:30:13,042 --> 01:30:15,252
It was an accident.

934
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:24,927
You did everything just right tonight.

935
01:30:25,054 --> 01:30:27,555
As well as your dad could have done.

936
01:31:31,578 --> 01:31:34,997
I guess God kept me alive to bring her into the world.

937
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:38,543
But every day, I wish...

938
01:31:39,377 --> 01:31:44,091
I wish it was me that died
in that car instead of Griffin.

939
01:31:48,345 --> 01:31:50,847
I wish you both had lived.

940
01:32:00,774 --> 01:32:05,445
I was fallen-down drunk
the night that Mitch got mauled.

941
01:32:06,488 --> 01:32:10,993
That's why I couldn't get the bear off him before I did.

942
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:16,081
He never said anything about it.

943
01:32:16,206 --> 01:32:18,292
He never would.

944
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:32,972
You.

945
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:49,864
I'm not just gonna lie down here.

946
01:33:10,301 --> 01:33:13,012
Just keep going.

947
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:44,211
Heard you made a hell of a fall, Einar.

948
01:33:44,293 --> 01:33:47,131
You're lucky you only cracked two ribs.

949
01:33:47,213 --> 01:33:49,841
It was the soft part of the yard.

950
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:52,552
- Am I finished?
- Not yet.

951
01:33:52,554 --> 01:33:56,597
I'm going to keep you here for a little bit,
make sure your spleen's OK.

952
01:33:56,724 --> 01:33:58,600
Ah, I'm fine.

953
01:33:58,684 --> 01:34:02,020
Well, I'll check back on you this afternoon.

954
01:34:02,145 --> 01:34:04,856
So you can double-bill me?

955
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:08,067
Seems fair to me.
You are twice the trouble.

956
01:34:08,068 --> 01:34:10,779
Let's give it a day or two, OK?

957
01:34:10,904 --> 01:34:12,864
Hmm.

958
01:34:12,989 --> 01:34:15,701
Couple of days.
That's bullshit.

959
01:34:44,688 --> 01:34:46,564
Einar?

960
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:48,440
OK?

961
01:34:48,442 --> 01:34:51,778
Yeah, I'm fine. Got clumsy.

962
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:53,738
Mitch.

963
01:34:54,989 --> 01:34:57,618
Mitch, we set the bear free.

964
01:35:00,328 --> 01:35:02,288
I know.

965
01:35:03,247 --> 01:35:05,208
Thank you.

966
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:20,972
You want me to run some breakfast out to Mitch?

967
01:35:20,974 --> 01:35:25,354
No. Usually coffee's enough
for him in the morning.

968
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:29,817
You know,

969
01:35:29,942 --> 01:35:31,902
she could go to school here.

970
01:35:34,195 --> 01:35:36,407
Not a bad school.

971
01:36:11,108 --> 01:36:13,109
Whoa, Jimmy.

972
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,122
Stay there.

973
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:13,878
- What do you want, Gary?
- It's time to come home, baby.

974
01:37:18,384 --> 01:37:20,551
I love you, Jean.

975
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:24,305
You love me?

976
01:37:26,725 --> 01:37:30,353
- That's what your love feels like.
- You bitch!

977
01:37:30,354 --> 01:37:32,355
- Mom!
- Don't you ever hit me!

978
01:37:32,439 --> 01:37:34,524
- Mom!
- Don't you hit me!

979
01:37:34,649 --> 01:37:37,569
- Mom, are you OK? Mom! Mom!
- Come on.

980
01:37:37,653 --> 01:37:40,779
- Mom! Mom!
- Let her go, Gary!

981
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:43,283
- Let go of me.
- Are you coming or staying?

982
01:37:43,408 --> 01:37:45,703
Hey! Take your hands off her!

983
01:37:45,786 --> 01:37:48,287
What the hell?

984
01:37:49,456 --> 01:37:51,833
Get in the car.
Get in there!

985
01:37:53,292 --> 01:37:55,921
Griff, get out of the car.

986
01:37:56,005 --> 01:37:58,297
- Griff! Griff, goddammit!
- Griff!

987
01:37:58,423 --> 01:37:59,966
Mom!

988
01:38:00,509 --> 01:38:02,594
Mom!

989
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:09,976
Come on.

990
01:38:14,148 --> 01:38:15,524
Mom.

991
01:38:16,567 --> 01:38:18,735
- Come on.
- Mom.

992
01:38:23,865 --> 01:38:26,784
- It's enough, Einar.
- Mom.

993
01:38:50,975 --> 01:38:54,520
You leave her alone.
Now, come on here. Come on, get.

994
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:57,315
Get out of here. Get away,
you greedy little bugger.

995
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:01,694
- She didn't do anything to you.
- That's Mitchell. He's a boy.

996
01:39:03,988 --> 01:39:05,657
Yep.

997
01:39:07,451 --> 01:39:09,409
Come on.

998
01:39:09,411 --> 01:39:11,913
Get outta... Goddamn...

999
01:39:13,582 --> 01:39:16,502
Loma.
Loma, Nebraska.

1000
01:39:39,858 --> 01:39:43,819
So what about you, Mitch?
You know anything about this?

1001
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,030
About what?

1002
01:39:47,908 --> 01:39:51,243
So you don't know anything about it?

1003
01:39:51,244 --> 01:39:53,538
I just drove him home from the hospital.

1004
01:39:53,622 --> 01:39:55,832
Mm-hm. Of course. Right.

1005
01:39:55,916 --> 01:39:57,917
Hello, Officer Curtis.

1006
01:39:58,002 --> 01:40:00,503
Good afternoon there, Griff.

1007
01:40:01,255 --> 01:40:03,131
Einar.

1008
01:40:03,215 --> 01:40:05,634
Would you stay for lunch today?

1009
01:40:05,717 --> 01:40:07,720
Yeah, I might.

1010
01:40:07,802 --> 01:40:13,141
I gotta speak to your grandfather
for a second, though, first.

1011
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:20,106
Ah, heck. It can wait.
Here, let me grab that for you.

1012
01:40:20,231 --> 01:40:22,315
So, how was she today?
Looks good, huh?

1013
01:40:22,317 --> 01:40:25,863
- Yeah? Did you do the milking?
- Yeah.

1014
01:40:29,283 --> 01:40:31,702
Think it might rain today.

1015
01:40:34,621 --> 01:40:36,998
No, it's gonna stay warm.

1016
01:40:37,123 --> 01:40:42,628
I didn't say anything about the
temperature. I said it might rain.

1017
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,636
Would you bury me next to Griffin?

1018
01:40:53,806 --> 01:40:56,935
Don't you think you oughta die first?

1019
01:40:59,313 --> 01:41:01,939
It's gonna happen, you know.

1020
01:41:01,939 --> 01:41:07,863
Where the hell else do you think
I'd bury you? It's where my family lies.

1021
01:41:10,157 --> 01:41:14,536
You think the dead really care about our lives?

1022
01:41:14,661 --> 01:41:17,454
Yeah, I think they do.

1023
01:41:17,456 --> 01:41:20,292
I think they forgive us our sins.

1024
01:41:22,168 --> 01:41:24,755
I even think it's easy for them.

1025
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:31,345
Griff said you had a dream about flying.

1026
01:41:31,427 --> 01:41:33,430
Yeah.

1027
01:41:34,472 --> 01:41:36,432
I got so high, Einar,

1028
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:39,895
I could see where the blue turns to black.

1029
01:41:41,145 --> 01:41:44,565
From up there, you could see all there is.

1030
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:49,779
And it looked like there was a reason for everything.

1031
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,148
