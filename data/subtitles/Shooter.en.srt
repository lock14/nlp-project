00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,900
Movement.

2
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Two men.

3
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,300
Approximately

4
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,500
40 goats.

5
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,200
They're not on anybody's side.
We don't have to shoot them.

6
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,500
Egress?

7
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,900
Primary over the top, secondary
down the road, tertiary to the river.

8
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,400
No one can track you through the water
except a fish.

9
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,300
Sarah's headed off to nursing school
next month.

10
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,900
She sewed that herself.

11
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
It's beautiful.

12
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,800
You sure this is
a peacekeeping mission?

13
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,300
Normally there isn't any peace
to start with.

14
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,300
This shit's awful calm.

15
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,000
- Not at these coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,300
Go ahead and plot an alternate.

17
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Yes, sir.

18

of TS-129's current position.

Target.

28
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,000
Sector Bravo, deep.

29
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,300
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.

30
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Range it.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
870 yards and closing.

32
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,100
Wind, three-quarter value, push 2 left.

33
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,300
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,100
On target.

35
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,500
Hold scope.

36
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,000
Fire when ready.

37
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Hit.

Crooked tree.

Shut it down.

They're highly-trained men,

58
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,300
eight kilometres inside a country
we are not supposed to be in.

59
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800

The comm link's dead!

68
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,100
They left us here.
Don't worry, we're getting home!

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,100
Donnie?

70
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,900
Donnie!

71
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000

72
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Come on, Sam!

73
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
What're you doing, huh?
What're you doing?

74
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Come on.

75
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
What? I got nothing.

76
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
What?

77
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.

78
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,400
That's a good boy.

79
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,100
Good boy.

80
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,600
Well, let's see what lies
they're trying to sell us today.

81
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,900
Here, boy.

82
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,300
Good boy.

83
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,200
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.

84
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,900
USMC, retired.

85
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,300
He is the best there is.

86
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,000
His last assignment went wrong.

87
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,400
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out
and left as expendable.

88
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,000
Opposing force sent an attack
helicopter and a hundred-man company.

89
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
His best friend and spotter was killed.

90
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,300
No official report.

91
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,600
Ghost report says he inflicted
70 percent casualties, the rest fled.

92
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
The agency asset
that left them there to die?

93
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Suddenly removed from
the face of the earth two weeks after.

94
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,200
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.

95
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
He retired a week later.

96
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I guess Bob Lee didn't think
he was expendable.

97
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Grows and shoots his own food.

98
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

99
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,100
This is a man
with a history of duty and patriotism.

100
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,800
- Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs.
- Aye.

101
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,400
Some people don't know what to do
when their belief system collapses.

102
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,000
Bob Lee is one of those.

103
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
You sure, boy?

104
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,000
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

105
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,800
You guys turn around and go back
to wherever you came from.

106
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Bob Lee Swagger?

107
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,300
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

108
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
You're a hard man to find.

109
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,300
But not hard enough.

110
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
Come a long way to see you.

111
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,300
We have some business
needs your attention.

112
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,900
You wanna use your low gear
going down the road

113
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
or your brakes'll go.

114
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,100
- Come here. Come here, boy.
- Don't do that.

115
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,500
Come near the porch I didn't invite you,
you'd have to shoot the dog.

116
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
That's a slow draw you got there.

117
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,800
Sure you want to do that?

118
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,700
Shoot a dog in this county
on a man's land,

119
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,100
I'd bury you in the hill,
and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

120
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,400
He understands.

121
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,300
Take your hand off your weapon.

122
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Slowly.

123
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,900
So the gunnery sergeant
doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

124
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,900
I don't carry a gun.

125
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
You know what that is?

126
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
It's a Congressional Medal of Honour.

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
They don't hand those out easy.

128
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,800
Yours?

129
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah.

130
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,300
Your father had one, didn't he?

131
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,000
What did you do?

132
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,800
Something foolhardy.
Kept some other boys alive.

133
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,800
Will you give me five minutes?

134
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,900
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

135
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,800
Come on, boy. Get in there.

136
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,200
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

137
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,500
Whose president?

138
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
Ours.

139
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,700
I didn't say "execute".

140
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,600
Plan.

141
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
So it can be stopped.

142
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,000
There's gonna be an attempt on the life
of the President in the next two weeks.

143
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Code was broken
on an anonymous transmission.

144
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,100
It was internal.

145
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,600
We can't go to the usual agencies.

146
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,500
The government itself
has been penetrated.

147
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,900
The President has three
public engagements during that time.

148
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,600
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C.

149
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,600
Standard Secret Service
protective cordon

150
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,600
is out to 880 yards.

151
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,300
But this intercept claims that the shot
will be taken from beyond a mile.

152
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,400
We need you to scout,
tell us how you would do it,

153
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,300
so we could stop it.

154
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm not entirely convinced
that a shot like this could be made.

155
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,400
But let's not take the chance.

156
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,800
Your longer shots
were never confirmed.

157
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,800
That's because long shots
generally go places

158
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,600
you wouldn't wanna have
to go afterwards to confirm them.

159
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,400
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.

160
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,500
You know what it takes
to make a shot at that range?

161
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,100
Everything comes into play that far.

162
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,300
Humidity, elevation, temperature,
wind, spindrift.

163
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,800
There's a 6- to10-second flight time

164
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
so you have to shoot
at where the target's going to be.

165
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Even the Coriolis effect,
the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

166
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,500
President'll be wearing body armour.
That means a headshot,

167
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,800
at over a mile.

168
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,200
You believe there's a shooter involved
capable of making this shot?

169
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,500
Yes.

170
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, then you got a real problem.
You need to find the shooter.

171
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,500
That's being worked on
from another direction.

172
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,300
We need you to do this.

173
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,400
Don't really like the President much.

174
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
Didn't like the one before
that much, either.

175
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,300
You like the idea of the President?

176
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,100
Living in a free country?

177
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,700
Do we allow America
to be ruled by thugs?

178
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,600
Sure, some years we do.

179
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,600
I believe you stood before a flag

180
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
and solemnly swore

181
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,200
that you'd support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

182
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
against all enemies,

183
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,700
foreign and domestic.

184
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,800
I think your five minutes is up.

185
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,800
Listen to me, son.

186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't want you to turn on the TV
next week

187
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,500
and see the President dead,

188
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,200
and know you could've done
something about it.

189
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Don't do that to yourself.

190
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,700
Is that the new one?

191
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,100
The truck.

192
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,100
You got the big engine in there?

193
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-litre V8.

194
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,500
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother
to give you the gas mileage for it.

195
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,200
You mind if I take a picture?

196
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,600
This is beautiful.

197
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,700
Someone will be at this number
night or day.

198
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,600
You see what he did?
He didn't need a photo of the engine.

199
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,000
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass
about the engine.

200
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,600
He's trained in counterintel.

201
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,000
Backed up far enough
to take a picture of the plates.

202
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
This is our guy.

203
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,200
I thought he turned you down.

204
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,700
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

205
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
1,760's a mile.

206
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,000
It's a far piece, Sam.
Think the President ought to worry?

207
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
Yeah, I think he better worry.

208
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,100
Yeah, he'll be fine.

209
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,100
Just feed him once a day. Read him
a few ballistics tables if he looks Ionely.

210
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,500
Yep. I'm out.

211
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,800
Come here, buddy.

212
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
Okay.

213
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,800
Think you'll be able to tough it out
without me for a couple days?

214
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Yeah.

215
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,000
<i>This is Command Post.</i>
<i>What's your status? Over.</i>

216
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,900
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

217
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,800
<i>Roger that. We copy.</i>
<i>Checkpoint down, over.</i>

218
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,400
Before you stands Independence Hall,
the birthplace of the United States

219
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,500
and one of the most important buildings
in American history.

220
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,800
Built in 1732...

221
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

222
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,400
...both the Declaration of Independence
and the U.S. Constitution

223
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,700
were debated and signed here.

224
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Out of the three cities,

225
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,300
there's only one with
a reasonably high chance of success.

226
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,300
There was no room in Baltimore.

227
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,800
Street isn't wide enough to correct
for the windage,

228
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
buildings are in the way.

229
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,300
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

230
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

231
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
waiting for him in the afterlife,

232
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,300
I'd rule that out.

233
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

234
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,200
<i>From beyond 1,800 yards, though.</i>

235
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,800
<i>It's one of six possible locations,</i>

236
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,800
<i>approximately five storeys</i>
<i>above the President's location.</i>

237
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,000
<i>Flight time of the bullet that distance</i>
<i>is five to six seconds.</i>

238
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
<i>They'll have to wait</i>
<i>till he takes the podium,</i>

239
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,100
<i>several lines into his speech.</i>

240
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,900
<i>That way he'd be completely static,</i>
<i>obviously at his most exposed.</i>

241
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,000
<i>Shot requires a large-calibre weapon.</i>

242
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,700
<i>Expect the bullet to be handmade,</i>
<i>bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.</i>

243
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,200
<i>Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,</i>

244
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,400
touch more slippery.

245
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,000
Least that's what I'd do.

246
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
You can kill him from that far away?

247
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,400
Mile and a half, the bullet's
going to strike with more energy

248
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,700
than a.44 Magnum point blank.

249
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,500
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

250
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,300
<i>The challenge is the wind.</i>

251
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,300
<i>Lightest breeze uncorrected</i>
<i>at that distance</i>

252
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,800
<i>is enough to ruin the shot.</i>

253
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,000
<i>He's gonna need indicators between</i>
<i>the podium and the shooting position.</i>

254
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>Velocity corrections are easy,</i>

255
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,500
<i>but an angle change,</i>
<i>that becomes a trig problem.</i>

256
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,600
<i>He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.</i>

257
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,600
<i>Without something to gauge, your shot's</i>
<i>just too tough to make cold bore.</i>

258
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,800
<i>Impressive recon and report, son.</i>

259
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,900
<i>Move too soon, we lose him.</i>

260
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,400
<i>We want to take him alive.</i>

261
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,000
If we don't know who hired him,
it could just happen again.

262
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,500
We'll have six
three-man teams standing by.

263
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,300
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

264
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,600
A moment?

265
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,100
You've done your country
a great service, son.

266
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
- On the day...
- Look...

267
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,700
Listen.

268
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,700
You're one of the few people
who knows what to look for.

269
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,600
I could use a spotter.

270
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,400
<i>Thank you, Philadelphia.</i>

271
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,600
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

272
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
<i>... before you on this stage...</i>

273
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,100
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

274
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,300
<i>... patriots met in Independence Hall</i>
<i>and created a document,</i>

275
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,200
<i>the Declaration of Independence...</i>

276
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,500
Sir?

277
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
<i>... and a country,</i>
<i>the United States of America,</i>

278
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,700
<i>that changed the world.</i>

279
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,200
<i>Philadelphia is our home. We are...</i>

280
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,100
<i>Stand by, all teams.</i>
<i>This is Listening Post.</i>

281
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,000
<i>Flashlight's current location</i>
<i>is approaching Checkpoint Jason.</i>

282
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,500
<i>All sniper teams</i>
<i>send update on your sitrep.</i>

283
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,100
<i>Stand by.</i>
<i>Yes, I have a clear line of sight.</i>

284
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
<i>Copy that.</i>

285
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,900
<i>Post 18 clear, over.</i>

286
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,600
<i>Post 19, please report.</i>
<i>What's your status?</i>

287
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,100
All clear.
There's really nothing going on here.

288
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,600
<i>The Archbishop of Ethiopia...</i>

289
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,200
<i>The President will be awarding</i>
<i>the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal</i>

290
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,000
<i>to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo,</i>
<i>the Archbishop of Ethiopia.</i>

291
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,600
<i>There's been some controversy</i>
<i>surrounding the Archbishop</i>

292
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,900
<i>as he's been speaking out</i>
<i>regarding the atrocities in his country.</i>

293
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,400
<i>He plans to meet with the President</i>
<i>right after the ceremony</i>

294
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,800
<i>to discuss these matters.</i>

295
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,200
<i>These are great times.</i>

296
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,400
<i>These are historic times.</i>

297
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,800
<i>And these are troubled times, as well.</i>

298
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,000
<i>This medal that your country...</i>

299
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,300
Yellow ribbons.

300
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, people put those up
to remember the troops.

301
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,300
No, they tie those low around trees.

302
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,600
These are windage flags.

303
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,300
Roughly the location
I'd have put them in

304
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,900
for a shot from the steeple.

305
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,200
Yeah. Maybe.

306
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,400
No, definitely.
He knows what he's doing.

307
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,400
You guys got a team in place
to take out the church?

308
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,400
They'll move right before the shot
is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

309
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,100
<i>... raises its head</i>
<i>and confronts freedom,</i>

310
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,500
<i>but slyly, subtly,</i>
<i>chokes it off at the root.</i>

311
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,400
<i>And it is our responsibility</i>

312
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,700
<i>to find these dark weeds.</i>

313
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,500
<i>Flashlight has arrived.</i>
<i>I say again, Flashlight has arrived.</i>

314
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,600
<i>- Lf you just joined us...</i>
- Hi.

315
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,300
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

316
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
Bob Lee Swagger.

317
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,800
It is a real honour to meet you.

318
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
You're unsnapped, officer.

319
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,000
Shit. Oh, fuck.

320
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,400
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

321
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,000
Again, it's an honour.

322
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,900
<i>... of our stewardship of this great...</i>

323
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,600
- That our guy in the collar?
- The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

324
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,000
He's getting a medal. Know it?

325
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

326
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,300
You know I worked there?

327
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,200
You know what they say
about the first thing that you feel

328
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,300
when you shoot a civilian, right?

329
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,600
- Recoil of your rifle?
- Right.

330
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
That's very original.

331
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,500
<i>Thank you, Archbishop,</i>
<i>for those inspiring words.</i>

332
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,100
The President speaks next.

333
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,500
All teams stand by.

334
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,900
<i>Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by.</i>
<i>Situation all clear, over.</i>

335
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,700
<i>Agent James, all clear.</i>

336
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
<i>Now it gives me enormous pleasure...</i>

337
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,900
- Got wind at three, full value.
<i>...to introduce to you</i>

338
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,000
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

339
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Make it four-and-a-half minutes
of angle.

340
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

341
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,400
He's loaded.

342
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,400
Altitude, humidity,
temperature accounted for.

343
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,100
<i>In the city that was the capital of...</i>

344
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,700
We got to take him.

345
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,300
Ten seconds.

351
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
<i>- The President has been shot.</i>
<i>- There's mass confusion...</i>

352
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,800
Has the President been shot?

353
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,700
<i>Right at the church steeple.</i>

354

How could you fucking miss?

356
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
Thirty seconds, clear out.
Chase him down.

Give me the keys.

373
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,100
I didn't shoot the President.
Timmons was a setup.

Help!

375
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,600

376

Right on time, like he was supposed to.

- Before he shot him again.
- Yeah, well, he's been hit twice,

406
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,000
so unless he can stop the bleeding
without going to the hospital or a doctor,

407
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,300
it doesn't really matter.

408

Dead guy in the front seat?

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,700
I want the banks of this river lined

427
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,000
All right.
Let's start the search downriver.

428
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,300
I'm here with Officer Timmons,
who pursued the suspect on foot.

429
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Officer, can you tell us what happened?

430
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,100
<i>The would-be assassin,</i>
<i>tentatively identified</i>

431
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,700
<i>as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant</i>
<i>Bob Lee Swagger,</i>

432

<i>is being pursued by thousands of State</i>
<i>and Federal law enforcement personnel</i>

433
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,800
<i>as we speak.</i>

434
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,500
<i>As the net begins to tighten nationwide,</i>
<i>there is still no trace of Swagger.</i>

435
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,900
<i>Nothing but an abandoned car</i>
<i>has been found</i>

436
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,000
<i>at the bottom of the Delaware River.</i>

437

<i>Seven-year veteran Philadelphia</i>

<i>first to respond to the scene,</i>

<i>is believed to have shot</i>
<i>and injured Swagger.</i>

440
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
<i>Early reports indicate that the assailant</i>

441
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,700
<i>may have been hit</i>
<i>as many as two times.</i>

442
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,500
<i>Meanwhile, the FBI has been</i>
<i>unwilling to comment</i>

443
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,900
<i>on information that an agent of theirs</i>

444
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,100
<i>was assaulted and disarmed</i>
<i>by Swagger as he fled the scene,</i>

445
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
<i>possibly in a stolen FBI vehicle.</i>

446
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,300
<i>At this time, no sign of Swagger</i>
<i>has been found.</i>

447
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,600
You have embarrassed this office.

448
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,900
You will be facing a review from the
Office of Professional Responsibility.

449
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,300
Sir...

450
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,400
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.

451
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,500
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper

452
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,500
disarmed me three weeks
out of the academy.

453
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,700
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.

454
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,800
Why'd he say
he didn't shoot the President?

455
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,300
Because he didn't.

456
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,900
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.

457
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,400
He never said that.

458
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,700
City cop managed to spot,
shoot this guy twice.

459
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,200
You got your ass kicked.

460
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,700
You're misremembering.

461
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,500
That's normal
under extreme stress events.

462
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Have you given
your official statement yet?

463
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,500
Because I would be very cautious
about what went in it.

464
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,700
Well, maybe I should wait for the report
to come out, read it and then remember.

465
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,100
Can you believe this fucking guy?

466
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,700
There you go.

467
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,300

477

Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

some salt, some sugar,

00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,300
couple bottles of water.

480
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,200

00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,200
Well, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

494
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,300
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

495
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
And? Yes?

496
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,100

502

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold that! Hold that!

503
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,100
Well, sugar's been used to treat
battlefield wounds

504
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
for hundreds of years.

505
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,500
It has something to do
with osmotic pressure.

506
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,100
It was popular
during the Napoleonic War.

00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,600
<i>One thing is...</i>

513
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,100
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

514
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,600
I know who you are.

515
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,500
You're Bob Lee. Swagger.
Donnie's old partner.

516
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,200
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

517
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
I know.

518
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,600
You do?

519
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,100
The President's not dead.
Ethiopian Archbishop is.

520
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,800
Why in the hell
would somebody want to shoot him?

521
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,700
Look, you're a nurse, right?

522
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,300
No. No, that was Donnie's dream.
I couldn't stand the blood.

523
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,800
I teach the third grade.

524
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,000
- Please.
- Look, you should go.

525
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
Please.

526
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,600
Please?

527
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,800
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

528
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,500
I swear.

529
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,100
I'm in some bad trouble
and I need some help.

530
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,700
I wouldn't have come all the way here
to lie to you.

531
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,900
You still figuring on shooting me?

532
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,800
Only that shotgun's a little long
to bring up fast.

533
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,000
Look, if you're going to do it,
just get it over with.

534
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,100
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

535
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,000
Pull the truck in the garage.
The neighbours'll be up in a minute.

536
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,800
You'd best call me Sarah.

537
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,100
All right.

538
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,500
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

539
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,300
Hello?

540
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,200
<i>This is 911. We received a hang-up</i>
<i>from this location.</i>

541
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
Yeah, neighbour's dog knocked over
the trash cans

542
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,400
and scared the hell out of me.
Everything's fine. Thanks.

543
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
<i>Okay, then.</i>

544
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,700
Seems you call the police and hang up
without saying anything,

545
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,900
they call you back right away.

546
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,600
I should've come
and seen you in person.

547
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,900
Before. I mean, then.

548
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,500
Yeah, I read the letter.

549
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,800
It was okay.

550
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,100
And once a year I got the flowers.

551
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,200
You don't look real good.

552
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,300
I'm supposed to be dead.
Been a long night.

553
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,400
Why aren't you?

554
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,900
Well, the U.S. Government spent
a lot of time and money

555
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,800
teaching me how not to die

556
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,400
after they got done teaching me
how to kill people.

557
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,100
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

558
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,500
You can do a running cross-stitch,
finish it with an embroidery knot?

559
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,900
Yeah.

560
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,600
You got to try to spread it out.

561
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,100
It's gonna look odd
you buy it all in one place.

562
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,300
How can it be three years ago
when it seems like ten?

563
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,800
Mileage can be rough.

564
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,000
No one ever beats me in.

565
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,600
You never left.

566
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

567
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,800
Like I didn't see what I saw,
or heard what I heard.

568
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,400
I'm not crazy, though.
You think I'm crazy?

569
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,900
Where did all this stuff come from?

570
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,700
At first I thought
it was Washington, Quantico.

571
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,700
I checked and it didn't.
It just magically arrived.

572
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,200
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO,
places that don't even have initials

573
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,100
they cooperate
in times of national emergency.

574
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,900
You need to get some sleep.

575
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,700
You know that the first
ballistics diagram got here

576
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,600
22 minutes after the shooting.

577
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,800
We're good at our jobs.

578
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,400
12 minutes after the shooting,
they were still scrambling choppers.

579
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,700
The scene was locked down.

580
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,200
How did they get a reverse azimuth
10 minutes after that?

581
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,500
I mean, we work
for the federal government.

582
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,900
We're not that good at our jobs.

583
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,400
<i>- You want to see something?</i>
<i>- Probably not.</i>

584
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,800
<i>I downloaded this.</i>

585
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,100
<i>This is a full-scale printout</i>

586
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,100
of a target Swagger shot
two years ago at 1,000 yards.

587
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,500
I punched in the holes myself.
It was at a competition.

588
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:18,300
I read an article. It said Swagger shot
a silver dollar at a grand.

589
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,700
Five shots,

590
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,300
at 1,000 yards,

591
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,700
an inch-and-a-half spread.
An inch and a half!

592
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,600
<i>It was the capital of the United States...</i>

593
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,200
That's the flag behind the President.
It's barely waving.

594
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,800
<i>This is the wind speed and direction</i>

595
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,200
<i>according to the</i>
<i>National Weather Service</i>

596
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,500
<i>at the time of the shot. I did the math.</i>

597
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,200
Now, how does a man who can do that

598
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,300
miss by two-and-a-half feet
at 2,000 yards?

599
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,100
<i>I don't get it.</i>

600
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,000
You've had a long night.
Let it go and get some sleep.

601
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

602
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,600
He said he was walking foot patrol,

603
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,300
saw a rifle barrel
sticking out of a window,

604
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,200
went upstairs to investigate,
and shot Swagger.

605
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,300
No sniper sticks his rifle
out of a window.

606
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,100
They shoot from cover,
back in the room.

607
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,400
It doesn't make any sense.

608
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,400
- I'm gonna talk to Timmons.
- No, you're not.

609
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me
if I do?

610
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,100
Timmons was killed by a mugger
in an alley last night.

611
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
In a conspiracy,
all loose ends are trimmed.

612
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,900
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

613
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,000
Bad things happen to good people.

614
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,200
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

615
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,600
Well, I stopped the bleeding
temporarily.

616
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,700
But it'll cut loose again.

617
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,900
Cut out and scrub away
anything that's dead,

618
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,900
working your way out,
sewing it together

619
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,900
and you got to try to make sure
you don't re-infect it.

620
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,800
You ready for this?

621
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,700
I'm going to do all those Whip-It! 's
and pass out.

622
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,400
Good luck, okay?

623
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,700
<i>I need you to plan</i>
<i>a presidential assassination.</i>

624
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,200
<i>That our guy in the collar?</i>

625
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,600
<i>Whose president?</i>

626
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,100
<i>I didn't say "execute".</i>

627
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,000
<i>He's getting a medal. Know it?</i>

628
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,400
<i>The Archbishop of Ethiopia.</i>

629
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,300
<i>You need to find the shooter.</i>

630
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,700
No.

631
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,500
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice,
no sign?

632
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,100
Find me something.

633
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,300
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

634
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,300
He's not dead.

635
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,500
Tear apart his life.

636
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,000
Again.

637
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,100
Go okay?

638
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,900
I've been hallucinating.

639
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,800
Something I need to tell you.

640
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,900
Ralphie's dead.

641
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,300
Who's Ralphie?

642
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,700
Well, they said you shot your dog

643
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,700
'cause you knew
you weren't coming back.

644
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,400
They said that, huh?

645
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,200
Name was Sam.

646
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,700
He was a good dog.
I raised him from a pup.

647
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,000
You okay?

648
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
No.

649
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,800
What are you gonna do?

650
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,000
I'll get better.

651
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,300
Then I'm going to burn
their playhouse down.

652
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,400
Can I help you?

653
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
Hold still.

654
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,900
I been meaning to ask you.

655
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,300
You have a boyfriend?

656
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,400
Why?

657
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,200
Am I still supposed to be
the grieving widow?

658
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,900
It's been three years.

659
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
No.

660
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,000
Just wonder if I'm gonna have
to shoot somebody

661
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,300
walks through that door
without knocking,

662
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,300
wondering where you've been.

663
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,200
Well, no.

664
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,600
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

665
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,400
Not bad.

666
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,300
A little stiff, but...

667
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,200
Hey.

668
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,900
You know, you would've made
one hell of a nurse.

669
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,100
That was really brave, what you did.

670
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,700
You saved my life.

671
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,300
I'm better. I better get to it.

672
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,700
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

673
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,000
Never.

674
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,300
They're never gonna stop looking.

675
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,500
In the meantime,
they need someone else to find.

676
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,100
I'm going to give them him.

677
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,700
Excuse me?

678
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,900
May be a way to get two birds
with that stone, too.

679
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,400
- Swagger?
- Hey.

680
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,800
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with
when he was a kid.

681
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,000
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

682
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,600
I cleaned and oiled it
before I put it away.

683
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,800
You sure?

684
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,200
Yeah.

685
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,700
Why'd you go?

686
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,200
When they came to see you.

687
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,700
They know which buttons to press.

688
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,700
I'm still enough of a sucker,
you press that patriot button,

689
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,300
I'll sit up in my chair and say,
"Which way you want me to go, boss?"

690
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,000
I mean, I ain't real proud of it,
but I ain't ashamed, either.

691
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,900
You know, I got a plan,

692
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,500
but I think I'm going to need your help.

693
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,600
Okay. I'll do it.

694
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,600
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

695
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,400
I know.

696
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,400
Look.

697
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,800
It was my fault.

698
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,600
What?

699
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,200
You know, with Donnie.
I should never have...

700
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,300
What?

701
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,100
Don't you dare.

702
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,100
Don't you try and take that
away from him.

703
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,900
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enlisted.

704
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,200
He knew exactly what he was doing

705
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,000
when he enrolled
in scout sniper training.

706
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,700
He loved what he did.

707
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,800
No one made him do it.

708
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,300
That ain't yours to carry.

709
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,900
You're right.

710
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,900
I'm sorry I tried.

711
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,100
It's okay.

712
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,300
<i>I need you to meet with this FBI agent.</i>

713
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,100
<i>Use him to flush Johnson</i>
<i>out of his hiding place.</i>

714
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,200
<i>Give him the vehicle ID number.</i>
<i>He'll do what he's trained to do.</i>

715
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,800
<i>You get in and get out.</i>
<i>Don't get caught.</i>

716
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,800
<i>You get caught, I get caught.</i>

717
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,500
You know what that is?

718
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,900
Says he didn't shoot no one,
but I don't know.

719
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,300
Well, he's been staying with me.

720
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,500
Who's been staying with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

721
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:06,100
The plates are probably fake.
Pretty sure the other number's real.

722
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,900
- And what is this?
- A VIN number.

723
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Seems no one goes through
the trouble to change them anymore.

724
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,300
And you're going to sit real still
until I'm long gone.

725
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,300
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

726
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,900
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID, please?

727
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,300
Sir, I'm going to need you
to take off your hat

728
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,600
and show me some ID.

729
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,300
I'm not gonna ask you again.

730
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,600
Take your hat off, asshole!

731
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,400
Get on the ground!
Get your ass on the ground!

732
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,100
Hey, how's it going?

733
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,100
Hey, John.

734
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,800
- Hey, Ed?
- Yeah.

735
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,800
You got that Stevens file
we wanted back?

736
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,400
How badly do you want to know?
Because this will get you fired.

737
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:03,300
Well, I have to go before
the Office of Professional Responsibility

738
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,500
in 45 minutes for a review.

739
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,700
I'm gonna get fired anyway.
I'm done worrying about that.

740
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,900
What do you think?

741
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,000
I think that CNN got the tapes
before we did,

742
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,400
already edited together
to show the angles.

743
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,700
Who delivered them?

744
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,100
An unnamed agency
who will never confirm or deny.

745
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,300
They denied, which is a...

746
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,000
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

747
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,900
Of what?

748
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:35,500
That you are asking questions
way outside your pay grade.

749
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:36,900
Oh, come on, just tell me.

750
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,500
You don't want to be here
for that review.

751
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:42,100
They don't have to stop at firing you.
They can charge you and hold you.

752
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,600
The ASAC's job
comes with Delta clearance.

753
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,100
- Thank you.
- Go.

754
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,200
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

755
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,400
These guys talk about everything.
I didn't give it much thought at the time.

756
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,900
We just traced it to a doughnut shop
with free WiFi.

757
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,800
But this,
this is a Delta-level clearance request

758
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,700
out of the FBI field office in Philadelphia
seven minutes ago.

759
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,400
Funny thing,
Google Maps puts the doughnut shop

760
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,100
only three blocks away
from the field office.

761
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,200
There's only one guy who met
with Swagger before he disappeared.

762
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,600
He lives in Philly.

763
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,300
And he works for the FBI.

764
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,900
Nicholas Memphis.

765
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,700
...really strange company.
Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

766
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,600
Offices in Virginia, Delaware,
registered in Panama.

767
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,500
They own a boat
that's flagged out of Libya.

768
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,700
<i>They're definitely not government,</i>

769
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,400
<i>but they have high ex-military contacts</i>
<i>like you wouldn't believe.</i>

770
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,900
<i>These are contractors.</i>

771
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,400
<i>I can't tell</i>
<i>what this company does, but...</i>

772
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,300
Hey.

773
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,500
Hey, hey, hey!

774
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,500
<i>Memphis?</i>

775
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:01,700
<i>Memphis!</i>

776
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,700
For a man who didn't know much,

777
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:14,000
you sure took a long,
painful time to tell it.

778
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,900
Get him some water.

779
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,100
Good.

780
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,800
Got to pee yet?

781
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,800
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

782
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,100
Look awful suspicious
if you were to go and shoot yourself

783
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,500
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

784
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,600
I'm not going to shoot myself.

785
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,500
Sure you will.

786
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,000
Take him out. Get him ready.

787
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,200
No!

788
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,000
That's my gun.

789
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,200
Yeah.

790
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,000
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

791
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,500
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

792
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,100
Quit your struggling.

793
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,400
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

794
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,700
Russo. Russo!

795
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,500
Davis, get out here!

796
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,400
What is the goddamn hold-up?

797
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,200
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

798
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,400
Kill you?

799
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,200
Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

800
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,100
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

801
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,600
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

802
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,100
Help me toss these boys in the water?

803
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,500
You set me up and you used me as bait!

804
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,400
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

805
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,600
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

806
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,700
but they were
kind of determined to kill you.

807
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,100
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

808
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,100
They can work out some kind of deal.

809
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,900
This is explainable. You can prove
that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

810
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,200
I don't think you understand.

811
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,500
These boys killed my dog.

812
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,400
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

813
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,100
In the end, the law is all...

814
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,800
In the end,
the law'll never catch and hold them.

815
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,300
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

816
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,800
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story.

817
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,200
And I'll be dead.

818
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,300
It's gonna be
some hard, hairy work, Pork.

819
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,500
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

820
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,800
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell
I mean to see it through.

821
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,400
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

822
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,000
You know, I missed a meeting today

823
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,600
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

824
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,600
because I was kidnapped by people
that don't exist.

825
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,800
I'll take his legs.

826
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,400
It's a good call, Pork.

827
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,900
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBI agent

828
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,700
overpowered and killed
the three of them?

829
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,000
No.

830
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:55,500
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

831
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,700
With a.22.

832
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,800
- Swagger's alive.
- Yes.

833
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,400
And that young kid,

834
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,300
FBI Agent

835
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,000
Nick Memphis,

836
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,700
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

837
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,600
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

838
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:20,800
What?

839
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,100
I just went over
Swagger's financials again.

840
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,100
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

841
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,700
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

842
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,000
Donnie Fenn's widow.
Anniversary of his death.

843
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,400
She went back to using
her maiden name,

844
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,700
which is why we missed it the first time.

845
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,700
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

846
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,700
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

847
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,200
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

848
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,100
It's just within driving range.

849
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,700
- What are you waiting for? Take the jet.
- All right.

850
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,200
We've given Swagger a new war,

851
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,200
he's found a new spotter.

852
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,100
This is about to get worse.

853
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,900
I think we're here.

854
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,200
Hey. Swagger.

855
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,100
I think we're here.

856
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,300
Welcome to Tennessee.

857
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,500
Patron state of shooting stuff.

858
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,300
Hey, who is this guy?

859
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,800
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

860
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,000
He knows more about guns
and the people who shoot them

861
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,200
than Smith & Wesson.

862
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,800
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

863
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,100
- You mind your manners.
- All right.

864
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,700
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

865
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,200
Wisdom.

866
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,900
You come to the wrong place.

867
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,200
Maybe.

868
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,900
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

869
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,700
and have it match exactly to another.

870
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,200
Could that be done?

871
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,300
Take a seat.

872
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:24,400
Have a chair, son.

873
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,500
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

874
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,300
could make the grooves match.

875
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,600
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

876
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,300
The bullet that was taken
out of the Archbishop

877
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,000
was completely mangled on impact.

878
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,300
FBI match was metallurgical.

879
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,600
Thank you, Mother.

880
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,000
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that
going in, so they had to be sure.

881
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,600
And I still can't figure out
how they could be.

882
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,200
- Good coffee?
- Yep.

883
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:58,300
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

884
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,400
Red leather spine.

885
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:04,500
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

886
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,500
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

887
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,500
Yeah. Paper patching.

888
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,800
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

889
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,100
Paper-wrapped bullet.

890
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,700
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

891
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,900
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

892
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,000
Leaves no traces when it hits.

893
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:47,700
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

894
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,100
I got another one.

895
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:50,900
I thought you might.

896
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,000
Suppose I was looking for a man
to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

897
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,900
Who's alive that could do that?

898
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,500
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

899
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,800
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

900
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,100
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

901
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,700
Yeah, they said that, all right.

902
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,400
They also said
that artificial sweeteners were safe,

903
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,000
and WMDs were in Iraq,

904
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,800
and Anna Nicole married for love!

905
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,600
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

906
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,800
How come?

907
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,500
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

908
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,500
That's how a conspiracy works.

909
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:31,200
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

910
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:35,200
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

911
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,800
And you know this for a fact?

912
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,600
Still got the shovel.

913
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,700
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

914
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,300
There was a guy in Russia.

915
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,100
They locked his ass up.

916
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,500
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

917
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,300
There was one guy,

918
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,700
but he don't shoot no more.

919
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,800
A brutal son of a bitch.

920
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

921
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,500
wait till his friends come to help,

922
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,100
kill them too.

923
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,300
Turned one target into four.

924
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,700
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

925
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,200
The other side wanted him. Bad.

926
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,500
Finally narrowed his hide down
to an abandoned six-storey building.

927
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,700
They quit the subtle tactics.

928
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,500
They called in an artillery strike.

929
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,500
Levelled a square block.

930
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,700
Brought the building down on his ass.

931
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,300
Some say he crawled out of there.

932
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,100
Some say he died.

933
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,200
Never heard from him no more.

934
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,300
Fuck me.

935
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,600
What?

936
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,100
I met the son of a bitch.

937
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,500
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

938
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,700
No, sir.

939
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,400
You keep that in mind.

940
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,300
The moment you think you got it figured,

941
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,500
you're wrong.

942
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,500
He got a name?

943
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,500
<i>Hey, it's me, Nick.</i>

944
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,400
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

945
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,200
- Yeah.
<i>- Are you okay? Nick, where are you?</i>

946
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,600
It's better I don't tell you.

947
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,800
Look, do you have a pen?

948
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,200
<i>I need you to find someone.</i>
<i>Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.</i>

949
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,400
- Yeah.
<i>- You got it?</i>

950
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,500
I got it.

951
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,500
Man, this is hard to spell.

952
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,800
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

953
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,200
He'll try to track the shooter.

954
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,900
He won't get far that way.

955
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,500
Yes, he will.

956
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,700
- How's that?
- We're going to help him.

957
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,700
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

958
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,700
And what happens to the bait?

959
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,600
Hard to say.

960
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,200
But that's the nature of being the bait.

961
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,600
<i>- Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him?</i>
- He's in Virginia.

962
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
An end we thought was tied up

963
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,200
came untied.

964
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,800
Meaning, Colonel?

965
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,600
Swagger is still alive.

966
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,400
Oh, my.

967
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,600
I need to land a transport plane
without a customs check.

968
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,000
I'm certain I don't want to know,
but what's on the plane?

969
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,600
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

970
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,700
Twenty-four good, hard men.

971
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,900
Weapons and gear.

972
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,600
Only 24?

973
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,400
Do kill him.

974
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,100
No loose ends this time.

975
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,500
Night, Colonel.

976
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,100
Good night, Senator.

977
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Hello?

978
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,600
Someone there?

979
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Now look.

980
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,500
Look what you've done now.

981
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,200
Give me that.

982
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,200
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

983
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,700
Where's your boyfriend?

984
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,500
What if it's a trap?

985
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,300
Oh, it's a trap.

986
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,700
Guaranteed. Every time.

987
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,300
Question is, for whom?

988
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,600
- You got your list, right?
- Yep.

989
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,000
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

990
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,100
Let's go.

991
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,500
Okay, so what are these for again?

992
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,000
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

993
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,700
Right.

994
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,800
Napalm on the first floor.
Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

995
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:30,000
Gotta be very careful with these.
It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

996
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,400
So what exactly
are we getting ready for?

997
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,900
For as much as we can be.

998
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,300
All right, you got
four enemy combatants.

999
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,100
Take them one by one.

1000
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,100
Keep shooting.
Don't let anything distract you.

1001
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,900
Fuck!

1002
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,500
Didn't I say
don't let anything distract you?

1003
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,100
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Let's see it.

1004
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,800
No. No.

1005
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,200
It's just you and me, baby.

1006
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,300
No!

1007
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,900
You got three guards.

1008
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,200
One at your 2:00,

1009
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,700
12:00

1010
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,200
and 10:00.

1011
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:52,900
Danger close. 2:00,

1012
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,200
<i>fifty yards.</i>

1013
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,700
<i>You got one right on you.</i>

1014
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,200
20 yards and closing.

1015
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,200
Go check the perimeter.

1016
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,200
And tell the others to stay alert.

1017
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,900
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

1018
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,600
Swagger, you got one above you
on the roof.

1019
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,600
You killed all three?

1020
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,900
There were four.

1021
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:58,200
I want Johnson's real name.
I want to know who he works for.

1022
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,300
I want to know why it was worth
going through that much effort

1023
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,800
to kill the Archbishop.

1024
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,200
Aren't you the one that shot him?

1025
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,400
And if I don't know any of those things?

1026
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,600
Then you're of no worth to me

1027
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,800
and I might as well shoot you now
and leave.

1028
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,500
Johnson's had a lot of names.

1029
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:20,300
Don't know one's any more real
than the next.

1030
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,200
Knowing would only be dangerous.

1031
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,400
He's ex-army.

1032
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,900
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

1033
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,400
Go on.

1034
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,900
They came for me,
like they came for you.

1035
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,500
Recruitment for a single job.

1036
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,600
They like the wounded.

1037
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,400
Easier to use

1038
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,500
and then throw away
when you are done.

1039
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,800
Timmons, you, me...

1040
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,300
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard
to be staked down like a goat.

1041
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:06,100
This is just one dead man
talking to another.

1042
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,700
And the Archbishop?

1043
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,100
You want to take all suspicions away
when you shoot someone,

1044
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,800
wait till he's standing
next to the President.

1045
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,700
What was he going to say?

1046
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,000
The truth.

1047
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,600
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

1048
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,200
ever really happens
without the approval of the government.

1049
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,400
Over there, and here.

1050
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,300
The problem isn't the doing.

1051
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,900
It's the people in power having to admit

1052
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,500
that they knew.

1053
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,000
The prisoners are tortured
at Abu Ghraib,

1054
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,300
and only the underlings go to jail.

1055
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,700
Their bosses knew.

1056
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,900
We know their bosses knew.

1057
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,200
But you don't say it.

1058
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,100
What exactly happened in Africa?

1059
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,600
Somehow the villagers didn't think

1060
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,800
that an oil pipeline

1061
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,100
was a good enough reason
to move their village

1062
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,600
to a place
where the spirit gods didn't exist.

1063
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,800
Drink?

1064
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:08,900
So they asked them all nicely to move

1065
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,400
and when they didn't,
they just killed them all?

1066
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,700
No.

1067
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,000
They didn't ask.

1068
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,800
They just killed them.

1069
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,900
AII.

1070
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:19,000
So the next village
won't need to be asked.

1071
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,400
They'll just go.

1072
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:36,300
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

1073
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:40,200
men, women, children,

1074
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,900
under the oil pumping station
10 kilometres over the Eritrean border.

1075
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,200
You should know.

1076
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,300
You covered the retreat
of the contractors who did the job.

1077
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,400
Of course, you weren't supposed
to survive that, either.

1078
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,800
Who runs Johnson?

1079
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,300
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1080
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,500
You don't get it.

1081
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
There is no head to cut off.

1082
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,000
It's a conglomerate.

1083
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,300
If one of them betrays the principles

1084
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,100
of the accrual of money and power,

1085
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,000
the others betray him.

1086
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,600
What it is

1087
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:35,100
is human weakness.

1088
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,400
You can't kill that with a gun.

1089
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:48,300
Swagger.

1090
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,500
<i>Swagger.</i>

1091
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,300
<i>You got to get out of there.</i>
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

1092
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:56,200
Had to keep you till they got here.

1093
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:00,900
Lying wasn't going to hold you.

1094
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,300
You would have known.

1095
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,600
By the way, they've got your woman.

1096
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:15,700
<i>Swagger.</i>

1097
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,200
They're 20 yards and closing.
You got to get out of there.

1098
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,000
- Bug out. Go to hide two.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

1099
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,700
Swagger, I'm in position two.

1100
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:58,800
You got to get out of there.

1101
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:00,300
<i>- They're all over the place.</i>
- Hey!

1102
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,300
<i>Calm down.</i>

1103
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,900
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call,
okay? You got it?

1104
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1105
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:15,700
Listen very carefully.

1106
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,300
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

1107
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:18,600
<i>then the gas.</i>

1108
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,200
Three, two, one...

1109
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,400
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

1110
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,500
Swagger!

1111
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,900
You got it.

1112
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,400
<i>Swagger!</i>

1113
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,400
<i>Swagger!</i>

1114
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,400
Swagger!

1115
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,800
You got to bug out
on my go behind that barn.

1116
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Okay.

1117
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,100
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1118
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,300
Go!

1119
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,900
Come on!

1120
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,500
You got to gun it to that tree line.

1121
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,700
What?

1122
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,700
You got five shots left.
Gotta draw that bird out.

1123
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,100
Okay. Okay.

1124
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,100
- On my cover, all right?
- Okay.

1125
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:10,900
All right, go!

1126
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:25,800
Pull up! Pull up!

1127
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,900
Time to go!

1128
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,800
Let me take a look.

1129
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:03,200
Not right now.

1130
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:04,900
Morning, beautiful.

1131
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,300
- See this weird shootout in Virginia?
- Sir...

1132
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:11,600
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants,
blood. No bodies, though, right?

1133
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,400
And they get fingerprints
off the cartridge cases.

1134
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,700
First set positively IDed
as Bob Lee Swagger.

1135
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,900
Second set belongs
to Special Agent Nick Memphis

1136
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,900
of the FBI.

1137
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,800
What? That's gotta be wrong.

1138
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,500
Now, the only reasonable question
to ask after that is,

1139
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,200
what the fuck is going on?

1140
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,500
Great shot!

1141
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,500
- All yours, Dan!
- Good shooting!

1142
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:54,900
I'm beginning to think that you were
the wrong man for the job.

1143
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,000
Think what you want.

1144
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:04,400
It appears we misjudged
the gunnery sergeant.

1145
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,300
There's always a confused soul

1146
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,000
that thinks that one man
can make a difference.

1147
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:15,200
And you have to kill him
to convince him otherwise.

1148
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,700
That's the hassle with democracy.

1149
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,200
Pull!

1150
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,400
...fire under their asses,
you understand me?

1151
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,100
We need those results now.

1152
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,600
Anna, you guys, you take the team...
Anna! ...to the roadhouse.

1153
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,200
Okay, I don't care who it is right now.
I don't give...

1154
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:47,500
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

1155
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,900
Start a trace.

1156
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,400
Got it. I'm on it.

1157
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,700
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here.
How are you?

1158
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:57,100
Things have gotten a little complicated.
I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

1159
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,100
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

1160
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,800
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility
had begun to reach us.

1161
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:04,800
Got him.

1162
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,500
Were you in a gunfight
in Virginia last night?

1163
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,400
Like I said,
things have gotten a little complicated.

1164
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,800
Well, obviously the best thing for you
would be to bring him in, right?

1165
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,900
Oh, no. I can't do that.

1166
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,100
Why?

1167
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,100
It's gotten too deep.
It's not clear who can be trusted.

1168
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:22,300
- But we're the FBI, son.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

1169
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,900
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

1170
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:25,300
Oh, Nick, wait...

1171
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,300
Son of a bitch.

1172
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,500
- Did we get that?
- Got him.

1173
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:29,700
- Let's move.
- They're on an interstate

1174
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,900
- outside Bozeman, Montana.
- Let's move!

1175
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,700
This is Swagger.

1176
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,500
<i>- Colonel Johnson here.</i>
- Figured you'd be listening.

1177
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,100
- It appears you have nowhere to go.
<i>- Colonel?</i>

1178
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:44,800
If it is "Colonel"?

1179
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,100
It is.

1180
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:50,700
- I have something you want.
<i>- Well, it seems so do I.</i>

1181
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:58,300
<i>Over the Eritrean border,</i>
<i>there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.</i>

1182
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:01,300
<i>Men, women, children.</i>

1183
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,400
Tell you what, I'll give it to you
and we'll call it even.

1184
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,900
I just want someone there I can trust.

1185
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,600
I'm amenable.
Who do you have in mind?

1186
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,600
How about that guy from U2
with the glasses?

1187
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,100
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all.
He seems trustworthy.

1188
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,200
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

1189
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:18,600
My colleague's questioning
my choice. Okay,

1190
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:22,200
I see how that could be a tough
problem. You know, last minute and all.

1191
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:25,100
How about six-term senator
Charles Meachum

1192
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:26,600
<i>from Montana?</i>

1193
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,500
<i>Seems like a pretty good</i>
<i>second choice, don't you think?</i>

1194
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,600
I don't think so.

1195
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,500
I'm gonna provide you
with two numbers, then we'll talk.

1196
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,200
Point 732. Point 648.

1197
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,000
And what the hell is that?

1198
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:43,200
Those are the last three digits, down to
a few metres of latitude and longitude,

1199
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,300
of an oil pipeline pumping station
in Eritrea

1200
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,800
<i>with 400 bodies underneath.</i>

1201
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,700
Where are we meeting?

1202
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,500
Somewhere I can see you,

1203
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,300
coming from a goddamn long way off.

1204
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,200
Where's your boy?

1205
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,200
Well, I'm here.

1206
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
He's here.

1207
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,400
Look, look, look.

1208
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,300
There's your boy.
There's your boy, baby.

1209
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,100
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

1210
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,600
Okay.

1211
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,800
I think I broke a rib!

1212
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,700
Don't move!

1213
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,500
Is there anybody else?

1214
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,200
No.

1215
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,700
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

1216
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,900
You got no shot!

1217
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:26,400
No shot, Swagger!
You hear that, Swagger?

1218
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,000
You got no shot!

1219
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:34,300
What are you gonna do? Come on!

1220
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,000
It's over for you, buddy!

1221
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,600
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

1222
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,200
Not bad!

1223
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,600
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

1224
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,100
Christ.

1225
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
How can we help you?

1226
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,300
Guest at the motel last night
gave me $100

1227
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,300
to bring this by here at 3:00 p.m.

1228
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,100
Let's move!

1229
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,100
You all right?

1230
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:13,900
Yeah.

1231
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,200
Search him.

1232
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:26,800
I don't carry a weapon,

1233
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:31,000
ordinarily.

1234
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,700
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

1235
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,000
Pull the pilot.

1236
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:46,700
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

1237
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:48,000
Put your gun down!

1238
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,200
Easy. Easy.

1239
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:00,900
Sarah.

1240
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,400
Give me the gun.

1241
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,900
It's okay. Give me the gun.

1242
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,500
You okay?

1243
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,200
Put them up. Keep them up.

1244
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,900
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

1245
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,500
Yeah, you got what you came for.

1246
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:26,700
I think it's time you owe us
your side of the bargain.

1247
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:27,900
You do, huh?

1248
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:31,100
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

1249
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,700
Why don't we think about all this
that has gone on

1250
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,700
just as a preamble?

1251
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,600
You got any plans after this?

1252
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:43,600
You have a rather unique skill set.
I'd be interested in offering you a job.

1253
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:46,000
Work? For you?

1254
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,800
It's not really as bad as it seems.
It's all gonna be done in any case.

1255
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,500
You might as well be on the side
that gets you well paid for your efforts.

1256
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,700
And what side are you on?

1257
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:58,600
There are no sides.
There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

1258
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,900
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

1259
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:02,400
There's only haves and have-nots.

1260
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,400
What exactly does working for you
entail, Senator?

1261
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:09,000
Raping and murdering innocent women
and children, you sick fuck?

1262
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,000
You sanctioned the mass murder
of an entire village

1263
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:12,100
so a pipeline could go through.

1264
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,800
One village!

1265
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,900
And it brought stability to the region.

1266
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:19,100
Which means that no one
chops off their arms

1267
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,100
because their
grandmother's grandfather

1268
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:22,900
belonged to a different tribe.

1269
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,400
They like us down there, boy.

1270
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,400
This is a country

1271
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,400
where the Secretary of Defense

1272
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,200
can go on TV

1273
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,700
and tell the American public,

1274
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,400
oh, that " This is about freedom!
It's not about oil!"

1275
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,300
And nobody questions him,

1276
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,800
because they don't want to hear
the answer

1277
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,200
because it's a lie!

1278
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,800
There's only so many places
at the table, Gunnie.

1279
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,000
Now are you on the inside,

1280
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:03,600
or are you on the out?

1281
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,000
It's the FBI!

1282
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,500
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

1283
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:20,400
<i>If one of them betrays</i>
<i>the principles of the accrual...</i>

1284
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,300
I don't think so, Senator.

1285
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,400
- What are you doing?
- Saving our lives.

1286
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
- That proved you were innocent!
- Nobody out here is innocent!

1287
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,900
This stuff's plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

1288
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:38,500
You hand it over to the authorities,
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1289
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:41,600
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

1290
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,300
I'm out, old man!

1291
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,200
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

1292
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,600
You happy?

1293
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,700
Where do you think you're going?

1294
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,200
Washington!

1295
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:59,600
You going to shoot
a sitting U.S. Senator in the back?

1296
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,400
Lord knows I want to.

1297
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,800
I didn't think so.

1298
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:06,200
Let him go.

1299
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:08,900
They've got your rifle.

1300
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,900
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

1301
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:14,600
Recovered at the site.

1302
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:24,600
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

1303
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,600
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1304
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,200
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

1305
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:36,600
I won.

1306
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,000
You lost.

1307
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,900
Get used to the idea, son.

1308
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:43,800
I'm not your son.

1309
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:00,800
- Drop your weapons! Put it down now!
- Don't move!

1310
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,400
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBI!
Don't shoot!

1311
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,700
- Down, now!
- On the ground!

1312
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,300
I said get down!

1313
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,300
- Could I free my hands, please?
- It's okay.

1314
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,100
Thank you, sir.

1315
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,200
Thanks for bringing her.

1316
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,300
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1317
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,700
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1318
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,200
This is Attorney General Russert.

1319
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,700
- Director Brandt.
- Sir.

1320
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,100
Senator Meachum couldn't be
with us today.

1321
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:00,400
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1322
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,800
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1323
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,100
Against my better judgement,
I've agreed to it as a favour to the FBI.

1324
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:08,700
What the hell am I doing here?

1325
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

1326
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:12,900
Call the Joint Chief.

1327
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:15,800
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1328
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:18,300
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

1329
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:20,900
from highly-ranked
and powerfully-placed individuals

1330
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,500
telling me to let you go.

1331
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,600
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

1332
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,100
and am, indeed, required by law,

1333
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:30,400
to tell them to fuck off.

1334
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,100
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

1335
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,200
so you sit there and be quiet.

1336
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,800
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1337
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,100
Thank you.

1338
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,000
This is my weapon.

1339
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,400
No question about it, don't deny it.

1340
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,900
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

1341
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:51,100
We agree?

1342
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,300
It's been in the FBI's possession
ever since,

1343
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,800
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1344
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,400
No. Absolutely not.

1345
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,600
- You fire the weapon?
- There was no point.

1346
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,900
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

1347
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:03,900
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

1348
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:06,300
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1349
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,200
Definitely my gun.

1350
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,700
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that Archbishop?

1351
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:13,300
Nope. No, I don't.

1352
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,900
- Have any proof of this fact?
- No.

1353
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,500
- Trust me?
- Yep.

1354
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,800
Really trust me?

1355
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,300
Yeah.

1356
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,400
With your life?

1357
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:24,400
- Yep.
- Good.

1358
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:28,300
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put that weapon down now!

1359
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:31,200
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

1360
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,900
Ain't gonna make a difference
this close.

1361
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,100
Only thing
that's gonna make a difference

1362
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:35,800
is whether I'm crazy or not.

1363
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,000
I could keep doing this all day,

1364
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,300
with every weapon in my house.

1365
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:49,800
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

1366
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1367
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,800
But the gun don't shoot.

1368
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,200
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

1369
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,100
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1370
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:01,300
I did take an oath to defend this country
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1371
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,800
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

1372
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:05,700
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

1373
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:08,300
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

1374
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:10,800
Whatever.

1375
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,000
Who gives a shit?

1376
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:15,900
Nice presentation.

1377
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:17,800
But none of it sticks to me.

1378
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,100
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1379
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:23,500
Done.

1380
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:25,000
I'll be seeing you.

1381
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:28,100
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

1382
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:29,600
Yeah, in this country.

1383
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:32,200
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1384
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:43,000
These images are from a classified file
showing a village of people in Africa

1385
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,900
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

1386
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,100
My God.

1387
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,400
Look around you.

1388
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:51,100
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

1389
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:52,800
That's all hearsay.

1390
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,500
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

1391
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,100
And I'm free to go.

1392
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,500
Colonel, your moral compass is
so fucked up,

1393
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:03,400
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

1394
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:05,700
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1395
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,300
these events occurred
in another country,

1396
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:09,700
outside of our laws.

1397
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,300
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

1398
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,500
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1399
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,600
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

1400
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:20,400
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

1401
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:24,000
- Sir, I urge you to reconsider...
- There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1402
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,200
I win.

1403
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:30,500
You lose.

1404
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:32,400
Again.

1405
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,200
This is ridiculous.

1406
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,900
For the record, I don't like the way
this turned out any more than you do.

1407
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:04,600
But this is the world we live in.

1408
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,500
And justice does not always prevail.

1409
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:08,700
It's not the Wild West,

1410
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,200
where you can clean up the streets
with a gun.

1411
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:15,200
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

1412
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,400
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1413
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:28,400
Unshackle the sergeant.

1414
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,900
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

1415
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,400
In the face.

1416
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,900
You heard that expression,

1417
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:41,300
"You didn't know whether to shit
or go blind"?

1418
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:48,500
You should've seen the look
on the Attorney General's face.

1419
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:53,800
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

1420
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:57,400
"This is about evidence and the truth!"

1421
01:55:57,700 --> 01:56:00,100
And then you just said to him,

1422
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:01,700
"Fuck you!"

1423
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:05,000
"Hold my cigar, Mr A.G."

1424
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:08,600
"Fuck you!

1425
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,700
"The truth is what I say it is!"

1426
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:22,200
You know, you got to be
out of the country in the morning.

1427
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,100
You're going to Ecuador.

1428
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:31,000
Well, we're having some problems
with the locals.

1429
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:34,600
We have our personnel on the ground
ready to neutralise the problem, but...

1430
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:36,700
Well, they've requested you.

1431
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:39,900
It's solvable.

1432
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:43,800
They requested you...

1433
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,200
Swagger.

1434
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:53,200
Turn off the lights!

1435
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:01,700
Get my car.

1436
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:03,000
Get my car.

1437
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:24,100
Do something.

1438
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:25,800
Do something!

1439
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,300
Where is he?

1440
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:49,200
He's under the floor!

1441
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,500
You don't need to kill me.

1442
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:24,500
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

1443
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,100
It was them.

1444
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:31,300
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

1445
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:36,100
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.

1446
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,600
Are you out of your mind?
Are you out of your damn mind?

1447
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,700
I am a United States senator!

1448
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Exactly.

1449
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:47,140
