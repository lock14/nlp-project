Cloe,



Why do we talk in such a way?



This is what you said



Me?
Everything is my fault



Why do you blame me when the
relationship faced with problems?



What are you saying? Wish? Yes



I don't want to wish



And you always hope
your wish comes true



Why can't you accept the fact
that we've broken up?



This way, everything is understood,
we'll know what to do



If I've not mistaken,
you always want to make things clear



Isn't that correct?



Answer me!



Can we go now?



Thank you, Nuccio



Sing



Why haven't we been here before?



Not enough curiosity



Yes



Do you still remember
the beautiful things?



What do you want to remember,
the sun, the moon?



Don't you tell me suddenly
you've become a romantic person



I do all these things because
I don't want to be trapped in the past



This is a must



What I do remember is not the day,
but clouds



The sad feelings emerged
when summer came to the end



I don't want to be sad, that's why
sometimes I smile without reason



So, smile



How are you?



How are you?
- How are you?



Can I take 2 apples for the horse?
- Yes



How are you?
- How are you?



Do you know her?



Who?



The girl who went outjust now



The girl lives below the tower



Thank you



I like this location,
today I was sued



If you want personal space,
it's up to you



You're not allowed to talk in such a way,
who do you think you are?



You're silly
- Is that so?



Yes!



Tell me what do we do the whole day
besides fighting, nothing else



What do you wanna do? Sex?
- Yes, sex



But make me happy,
sex is not an illusion



You think too much



Walk quickly!



I hate this, but I get it everytime



Isn't that funny?



You are always searching for purity



You are a hated person



I can't do anything
I like this



You like it?



Let us be here



What are you finding inside?



Yes



I like old things
- But I am young



I like it even more



Is this an invitation?



Hopes you like it



What?



Generally



I seems to know you for a long time



No



You're the opposite type



Other types



Who?



A saxophone player



I saw 2 butterflies near the beach



They're always following me



I'm sure you've met one of them



No



But I believes one of them is with us



You want us to find it?
- No



No?
- No



This is a message
- Message?



Might be a message related to 2 people



Maybe



I feel cold



Goodbye



Goodbye



Are you here?



If I throw it, what will happen?



I tell your name



My name is Linda



How are you?
- How are you?



Hello?



How are you?
- How are you?



Where are you?
- Beach



The horse has ran away,
I want to bring them back



I am looking at the snow
- Where?



Paris
- I can't hear you, where are you?



I am in Paris



Is it snowing there?



I hope it snows here too



Cleo, if you're saying this



You makes me want to go there



I hope to get close to you



But the way you analyse problems



Hello? I can't hear



I said the way you analyse problems



The way I analyse problems,
how do we change?



Forget it



This is about searching



Foundation to something



Now I can't think of anything



Snow makes me calm,
I'm nervous now



la might be your best friend today



Kiss you
- Me too



Let's go back!



I don't remember exactly
when it happened



It was 2 weeks ago



Yesterday,
that was the day that I lost my...



It was the day after we're told we'll
be pitching this Samson's account



The copy guy comes in
and he's wearing a...



What's the socially acceptable term



Somebody encountered this trap,
kill it



We're shocked,
our molecules are moving



And before we processed this betrayal,
Howard says calmly



He decides to do something
about his hair problem



And he'll appreciate it if we kindly
refrain from making it



A topic of comment or conversation.



This is my team



Good people.
They're great at what they do



It's like Jazz



We can't talk about this tragedy
of Hallet's hair



I mean you should see him,
faces like starving animals



Look at me



Do something!



It is an alarm clock



They want a new concept
for their shitty little alarm



You know the, Samson,
'coz time is important to us



We're polishing the vase
when the house falls down



- Do you've an alarm clock?
- I do. Yes.



- You happy with it?
- It does the job.



Right, but you need a new alarm clock,
Dr Pearl



And it's gotta be a Samson



A new colour, a new texture



You want softer kick



You wanna kick it off a night stand
every morning for a year, you can



Our mechanism is incredibly



You see what I'm saying?
The message is simple



The life is lacking something



Pearl



Yes, it's short for Dr Pearl



You're talking about alarm clocks



All around me, these other firms,
they can hit home-runs



Left
Right



Melt in your mouth, not your hand,
it's great!



Dollar for dollar



Any of 'ur patients famous?
- I can't discuss my patients



All right, no, I saw a sketch
about that one at a night club



Doctor patient,
patience, doctor



I remember that, I want to remember
the names, anything personal



Mr Penrox ain't



Do you remember Jack?



I really can't help you there



Oh my god,
their sales up to the roof



I have the data



Your sister mentioned something
about a recurring dream



The woman in the dream.



The woman in the dream,
why did you say it that way?



Cecelia says it like that



Is Cecelia is your wife?
- Yeah



And you tell her about the dream?



I make the mistake of
mentioning it once



Now it has become a ritual,
it's a ritual



Until yesterday



What happened yesterday?



Yesterday I came down to the kitchen,
I was telling her about the dream



The latest installment.
There was a woman in the dream



When I wake up, I don't remember who
it is, but in the dream, I know her



It's not a sex dream



Exactly



But we're there and I said,
'Boy, who is it? '



Because I was thinking about it, I felt
like the air in the room has change



I look over and there she was,
shoulder shaking, she's crying



Why is she crying?



I don't know



Did you asked her?



She won't say it



She is upset?



Yes



Have you given any
thought of sitting down?



I'm wondering if cavemen
sat around talking about their dreams



And having coded conversations
with their wives



Over cold venison.



Do you often imagine
that you're a caveman?



No



I am happy with 1955



Look at the advances
in medicine, polio, TB



That was a joke



So, how is it with Cecelia
since her crying in the kitchen?



It's great



She's like a nurse on the night
when I've my tonsils out



Civil and unavailable



And how long is it since
you've been having this dream?



That's the thing...



It was the night when Hallet show up
with a new on his head



They show the woman in the dream



I've to show Cecelia
that I know the answer



Or she's gonna be gone



You've to help me, if this woman is
pulling away, I don't know what I'll do



So, I need to know the answer now



Before I leave, I gotta know



Mr Penrose



Human beings is not a car brake, I mean
we'll talk, we'll see what happens



Everybody is different.
You're under a lot of stress.



You're anxious about the job,
the recurring dream, the situation...



With your wife, you're much
more anxious than usual.



Exactly.



There're various ways I can try
to help you reduce 'ur anxiety.



First, I'll have you lie down
on the couch over here.



This couch?
Yes, right here



Just put 'ur head up on one end and
slide your feet down the other end



This works for people, the couch?



I can tell you,
I've great success with this couch



Should I take my shoes off?
- Yes, whatever makes you comfortable



We want your mind completely clear



Should I close my eyes?
- I find that helps



'coz I see things in great details



Sometimes, I imagine myself
as a person with no responsibility



That's very interesting



Part of me knows I enjoy it



Now, I want you to tell me
about 'ur dream



Okay



But first, take a minute, go back
to the beginning of the dream



When you got there,



Just pause for a moment, and
hold the first image in your mind



We at the beginning?
- Yes.



Tell me the first thing
you see in the dream



A woman's face



Can you see the woman
in 'ur mind right now?



Yes.



Where are you? Are you very close
or are you far-away?



We've facing each other in bed.
It's right after



That's very close.



Think for a minute what it feels like



How do you feel?



Then what happens?



She looks at me with kinda funny smile



And goes off to the bathroom



Turns on the tub and lets it run



This is when I realised we've
been in this room before



Describe the room to me?



Feels like a hotel room



Doesn't feel like a place
where anybody live



The only person
belongs to us



So, when I hear the water running,
I think,



I love it, that
she's gonna take a bath and I,



Begin to imagine her getting ready.



Taking off her make-up,
putting her hair up



So excited thinking about it.



When I hear her turn the water off,



I'm gonna go right
in the tub with her.



That's when the phone starts ringing.



- Who do you think might be calling?
- I don't know.



Aren't you afraid of being discovered?
- No.



Not even a slightest feel guilty?



- No.
- Not the tiniest bit?



No, no guilt whatsoever.



Then what happened?



Got better things to do
than answering the phone



She takes her bath



She gets up and dry herself up



She climbs up on the sink
in front of the mirror like a cat



And puts on her make-up



She finishes and,



Back in the bedroom,
I watched her as she,



Get dressed.



In the bathroom for a minute,
close the doors



She comes back out in her living room



She puts her hand on my face



There is a glove on her hand.



She kisses me.



I just lay there for a minute.



Then the phone rings again, I got up



Answer it, but there's
no one at the other end



- Then what happens?
- I wake up.



- Should I stop?
- No, no, stay in the dream.



I feel so sad.
Yes, you wanna be with her.



Yes.



Stay there on the bed.
You're in the dream now.



And I want you to go back.



I want you to go back in the dream
when the woman is in the bathroom.



The bathroom door is close?



Yes.



And you're lying on the bed?
- Yes.



Raise your head slowly, slowly



Where are you?
- I am standing.



And where is the purse?



The purse?



Yes, you said that when she sat down
next to you, she picked up a purse



- You see it?
- Yes.



I want you to go to the purse.



I can't.
- Why?



You're in a very vulnerable
state right now,



It's crucial you do not feel
judged at this moment.



If you turn around,
any expression on my face,



No matter how sympathetic
or supportive



And I cannot allowed that,
I'll not allowed that.



Thank you.



Let's go back to your work
for a while.



You feel as if
you've run out of ideas?



I feel like I've run out
of good ideas.



Something is missing.



Yes.



What is your favourite part
of the dream?



When she standing at the door
while the phone rings



Why?



By standing at the door and
letting the phone rings,



She's keeping outside world
away for a minute.



That's where I screw up, I answer
the phone and the dream ends



Maybe if I didn't answer the phone,
she'll come back



So, the phone is an interruption
from the outside world.



Yes.



Like the alarm clock.



Maybe.



You hear the alarm clock
in the morning, what happens?



I turn it off.
- Yes, but what did you wanna do?



Go back to sleep.



- Why don't you?
- If I don't get up,



I'll fall back to sleep
and I will be late for work.



Yes, yes, but you just want a few
more moments of sleep, just a few.



You've to reset the entire alarm



And the setting mechanism
isn't that precise.



What'll solve the problem then?



You've to turn the alarm off, and then
turn it off again automatically



I actually think I would.



Samson,
the alarm clock of your dreams.



Sounds like one of those good ideas.



Can I get up now?



Absolutely.



Feeling better?



Yes.



I feel like we've accomplished
something today.



No need to thanked me.
The work is an honourable reward.



Breakthrough is exhausting.



I feel really tired all of a sudden.



Are you all right?
- I feel like I can lay down again



You've some time left on your hour.



Thank you.



Are you up?



You must have hit the alarm
about a half a dozen times.



It's become a ritual.



What?



Promise me you'll talk to Hall
about his hair today.



I gotta go.



We can't pitch this,
we can't present this.



We work very hard on this.



And I'll like to think we've
accomplished something.



Don't you feel like we've
accomplished something?



No, I don't.



Neither do I.



We're living in the shadow
of a freaking snooze alarm



Where do you go from there?



What?



How are you now?



Fine



Don't you ever come again,
epidemic illness



No



You don't have to



That person is gone



Look at my face



Can't wear it anymore



No

The first time we met?



Yes



Do you remember my hand?



Yes
