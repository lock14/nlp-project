She's Vietnamese.

93
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,570
She's much too young.
This is not good.

94
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,367
Don't worry.

95
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,998
We keep her up here.

96
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,475
For special clients only.

01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,170
She's very young.

98
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,716
You make $600 a week

99
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,183
Oh, no.

01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,187

103
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,350
from the Vietnamese government.

104
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,929
See... I'm fair.

105
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,312
What's your name?
(Vietnamese)

106
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,925
So, the kid runs to his mommy
and goes,

107
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,595
"Mommy, Mommy, the baby chicken
is eating all my worms."

108
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,002
So, the mommy goes,

109
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:28,805
"It's okay, son.
Let him have some.

110
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:31,641
I'm just finishing up
eating his mother."

111
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,176
Eat...

112
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,439
Eat...

113
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,311
It's good...

114
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:36,121
Ma angry me. Ma kill you!
