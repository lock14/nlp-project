1
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,230
Johan became a multimillionaire
in his old age.

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,730
An old Danish aunt...

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,510
who had been a renowned
opera singer...

4
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,810
left him a fortune.

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,290
Once he became financially
independent, he left the university.

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,860
He bought his grandparents'
summer house.

7
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,530
A run-down chalet in an
isolated area near Orsa.

8
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,210
Johan and I
haven't had any contact

9
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,140
with each other
for many years.

10
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,280
Our daughters are far away,
even from me.

11
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,490
Martha lives in a home,

12
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,220
sinking in the isolation
of her illness.

13
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,200
I visit her now and then,
but she doesn't recognize me.

14
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,400
And Sarah... Sarah married
a successful lawyer...

15
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,000
and then moved to Australia where
they have very good jobs.

16
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,610
They don't have any children.

17
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,180
Me?

18
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,590
I still practice my profession,
but at the pace I choose.

19
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,220
Family quarrels and divorces mostly.

20
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,610
I've been thinking I
should visit Johan.

21
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,410
ONE
Marianne carries out her plan

22
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,400
I've been thinking...
I should visit Johan.

23
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,110
And now I'm here.

24
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,410
He's sitting there,
at the porch.

25
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,990
And I've been standing here,
watching him and...

26
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,200
waiting,
at least ten minutes.

27
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:46,240
Maybe I should have ignored
this irrational impulse.

28
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,870
This trip.

29
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,050
In fact,
I'm not an impulsive person at all.

30
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,350
But here I am...

31
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,420
And so I must decide:

32
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,590
Slowly return to my car...

33
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,000
or get close to him.

34
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:26,340
Of course, I could stay
here a while longer...

35
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,440
and let my confusion abate.

36
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,150
But not very long.
A minute more!

37
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,190
This minute is taking its time.

38
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,630
33 seconds...

39
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,200
47 seconds...

40
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,010
55 seconds...

41
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,600
No!

42
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,410
- Did I wake you?
- It's you, Marianne.

43
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,890
- Hi!
- No, don't get up.

44
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,220
- Typical, you were spying on me.
- That's not true.

45
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,430
We haven't seen each other in 30 years.
32 years!

46
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,000
- We simply lost track of
each other. - That's natural.

47
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,130
People start together,

48
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,870
then they separate
and talk by phone...

49
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,110
- and finally silence.
- So sad!

50
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,050
- ¿Was that a reproach?
- No, we had nothing to say to each other.

51
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,520
Then suddenly you call me
and tell me you want to visit.

52
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:19,050
- You didn't sound very keen.
- Keen? I said no.

53
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,430
I still say no. I don't want this.
No. But you don't care.

54
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,930
- I had to come.
- Why?

55
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,200
- I won't tell you.
- You're laughing.

56
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,880
Johan...

57
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,500
I've driven 340 km....

58
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,140
and managed to find your hideout...

59
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,340
in the middle of the jungle.

60
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,320
Now that I've seen and kissed you
and we've spoken I can leave.

61
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,060
That won't be enough.
Really?

62
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,200
- At least you can stay over
for dinner. - Why?

63
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,100
A week ago,
I told Mrs. Nilsson...

64
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,800
that my ex wife was coming
to visit.

65
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:13,110
I can't tell her suddenly that there'll
be no dinner. She'll go crazy.

66
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,650
- Who's Mrs. Nilsson?
- Agda. Agda Nilsson.

67
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,150
Are you and her a couple?

68
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,960
God forbid!

69
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,430
The two of you live all alone here
in the midst of a dark forest?

70
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,440
Mrs. Nilsson lives in
the village.

71
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:44,410
She cleans and cooks
and then goes home.

72
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,510
- She's religious and mean.
- There's no romance then.

73
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,420
To be honest,
I fear the hag.

74
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,230
I fear that she might want to marry me.
Anyway, stay for dinner.

75
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,030
She's made up the guest room,

76
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,130
so you have to stay
and spend the night.

77
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,340
I suppose I better accept.

78
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,640
It's so hard to get up from
this chair. No, don't help me.

79
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,120
What's wrong, Johan?

80
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,060
I'm trying to put
my arms around you.

81
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,520
Want to hug me?

82
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,540
Damn, Johan!

83
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,440
Old idiot!

84
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,050
- And how old are you?
- I don't know, and you?

85
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,620
- 86.
- No, not you, me!

86
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,020
Around 55.

87
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,330
- I'm 63.
- Really?  That many?

88
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,440
And I've had my uterus
and ovaries removed.

89
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,210
- Does that trouble you?
- Yes, sometimes.

90
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,040
Let's sit on the bench.

91
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,350
It's so beautiful!

92
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,010
When beauty is revealed...
in life, in creation...

93
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,960
Where is the source, the giver?
Beauty forever.

94
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,530
- I didn't know you knew some psalms.
- My grandmother taught me.

95
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,860
And my grandfather rewarded me
with little iron soldiers.

96
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,530
We can enjoy the view,

97
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,310
- hold hands...
- Are we going to hold hands?

98
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,140
- Didn't we used to do it?
- Yes, I believe so.

99
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,550
I haven't done it since...
I've stopped doing it.

100
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,150
You really have
a beautiful view.

101
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,130
Can you see the lake
house from here?

102
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,160
You can see the light reflected,
behind the rocks.

103
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,340
I drove by the lake house
coming here. It looks inhabited.

104
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,540
You could say that.
Henrik is there.

105
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,120
Yes, Henrik. Mi dear son.
The assistant professor.

106
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,120
- Are you on speaking terms?
- Not exactly.

107
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,460
I got a brief letter declaring that
he was planning on moving there.

108
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,530
He and his daughter Karin have
been there since late April.

109
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,630
You don't have much contact then.

110
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,640
Absolutely. A cordial conversation
if we run across each other.

111
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,640
- Fat boy Henrik!
He must be... - 61 !

112
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,150
- My God!
- You can say that again!

113
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,950
-  And his daughter Karin?
- Karin is 19.

114
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Her mother died of
cancer two years ago.

115
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,530
- Anna...
- Tell me.

116
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,570
Anna and Henrik were
married for 20 years.

117
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,650
He couldn't take her death.
He retired before his time.

118
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,950
I heard they were happy
to get rid of him.

119
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,960
He felt mistreated there.

120
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,220
- Like you, at that age.
- Me? No...

121
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,270
Well, yes, I was a bit fed up
with the academic standards silliness.

122
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,840
My honorary doctorate
from the University of Michigan...

123
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,240
finished all that.
- We were talking about Henrik.

124
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,140
He directs an orchestra called
"Uppsala Chamber Soloists".

125
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,020
But he'll quit that also.

126
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,210
He must do something.

127
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,880
I think he's writing a book.

128
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,230
- What about the daughter? Karin?
- Karin also plays the cello.

129
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,060
She'll audition for the
conservatory in the fall.

130
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,330
Henrik is teaching her.

131
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,440
They sit in the house with
their cellos every day.

132
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:46,240
You could say she's beautiful.
Like her mother.

133
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,910
Yes.

134
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,890
So...I know nothing
about our daughters.

135
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,530
- Sarah is in Australia.
- Australia?!

136
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,470
- Yes, Australia. - Well, she
managed to get far away.

137
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,040
I get letters and
phone calls from her.

138
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,450
She's fine. A good
law firm. A good husband.

139
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,520
- Sarah's happy with her life.
- And poor Martha?

140
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:37,220
Martha's sinking further and further.
She didn't recognize me.

141
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,660
She's no longer aware, in
our sense, of the world.

142
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,270
I understand...

143
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,580
- And you?
- I can't complain.

144
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,140
Though sometimes, I see myself
in voluntary isolation...

145
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,550
and I think I'm in hell.

146
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,480
Like I'm dead,
but I don't know about it.

147
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,420
But I'm fine.

148
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,320
I've plagiarized my past now that
I have the page of answers.

149
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,970
Doesn't sound like fun.

150
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,360
That's it, Marianne.
It's not.

151
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,030
And who the hell said
that damnation would be fun?

152
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,670
- What does your "page of answers
say"? - Want to know?

153
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,680
- I asked the question, didn't I?
- It says my life was shit.

154
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,480
A stupid and totally senseless life.

155
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,220
Is our marriage part
of your hell?

156
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,460
- To be honest, yes.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

157
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,800
An old priest once told me:

158
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,430
"A good relationship has two elements:

159
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,270
a good friendship
and an unshakeable eroticism".

160
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,050
Nobody can say that
we weren't good friends.

161
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,560
- Good friends.
- Of course.

162
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,430
- You were unfaithful. - I...
- I was too.

163
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,260
- It's so sad.
- But it was long ago.

164
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,160
- It's still painful.
- Not for me.

165
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,440
No, I suppose not.

166
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,270
- Dearest Marianne.
- That's what you say.

167
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:35,940
Yes, it's what I say.
It's nice to be here with you.

168
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,480
Holding hands,
Watching the beautiful view.

169
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,620
- Without talking about painful things.
- You're holding my hand.

170
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,930
Dinner! Mrs. Nilsson
will be furious if we're late.

171
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,670
Johan, I need to wash up
and get my bag from the car.

172
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,350
This was a mistake!

173
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,560
TWO
Nearly a week has passed

174
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,670
Are you Karin? Do you want
to speak to your grandfather?

175
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,940
Your grandfather and Mrs. Nilsson
went to the dentist.

176
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,250
I'm Marianne. I was your granddad’s
wife. I'm visiting.

177
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,690
- I know.
- Come on, sit down.

178
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,290
If you want, you can help me
clean out these mushrooms.

179
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,630
Here's a knife.

180
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,570
If you want to talk, we'll talk.
If not, we can just be together.

181
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,440
You must know Henrik,
my dad.

182
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,480
Can't say I do. I've just greeted him,
but I don't know him.

183
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,450
- Mom is dead.
- I know.

184
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,550
- She died two years ago.
- Your granddad told me.

185
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,430
- Dad retired and is spending his time
with music now. - The cello, right?

186
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,840
He's writing about
St John's Passion.

187
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,280
- You also play the cello?
- I hope to get into the conservatory.

188
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,550
- Your father is the teacher
and you are the student. -Yes.

189
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,290
What's wrong?

190
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,960
Do you know Hindemith's
cello sonata, opus 25?

191
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,440
I don't know anything about music.

192
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,370
Dad wants me to play it
for the audition.

193
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,840
- It's too hard!
- And doesn't he think so?

194
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,470
How were you in the days
before your period?

195
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,650
A premenstrual monster.

196
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:34,650
I would go to sleep as an angel,
and wake up as a demon.

197
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,260
My mind gets shattered.
And it's very hard for me to get up.

198
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,340
Dad is a morning person.

199
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,270
And I yawned.

200
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,940
We were working on
the fourth movement.

201
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,170
That damned Hindemith wrote:

202
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:02,480
"Lebhafte Viertel ohne jeden
Audsdruck und stets Pianissimo"

203
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,490
- You know?
- It looks difficult anyhow.

204
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:12,330
So I sat there with my
shattered mind and I tried.

205
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,430
I begged him to let me off
the hook, to no avail.

206
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,340
He made me play the same part
at least twenty times!

207
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,640
Finally I said. quietly:
"I don't give a damn about this".

208
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,240
I said that it wasn't a class,
it was animal torture.

209
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,360
Henrik was also angry,
but he laughed and said that I should...

210
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,480
try from the beginning, where it says:

211
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,460
"Lebhaft, sehr markiert...
mit festen Bogenstrichen."

212
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,400
I was so angry that I couldn't.
He said I was doing it on purpose.

213
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,340
I said that he didn't have the
skills to teach: I was unfair.

214
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,070
Dad is the most patient, sensitive and
courteous teacher there is.

215
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,440
He said it had nothing to
do with the teaching,

216
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,350
but rather with willpower
and discipline...

217
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,320
and that I was lazy.
That I was lazy!

218
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,170
Then I got up and left the
cello because I was trembling.

219
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,140
I said that it was enough for the day
and that I was going out for a walk.

220
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,910
He turned pale.
I'd never seen him like that.

221
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,160
And he said:
"You're not leaving".

222
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,260
I put my boots on and
headed for the door.

223
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,300
I didn't hear him approach,
but he grabbed me by the shoulders...

224
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,340
You're not leaving!

225
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,440
You're not leaving!

226
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,550
I sat and cried.

227
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,160
And I said: "Never again,
never again,

228
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,170
...never again".

229
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,910
And kept crying
until I felt empty.

230
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,950
Then I thought of coming over to see
granddad and begging him to help me...

231
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:30,050
leave that lunatic.
It was too much for me.

232
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:37,360
Now the old man can take
care of his crazy son:

233
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,370
send him to the farm,
go to the police...

234
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,470
or kill him.

235
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:57,080
Then I became aware that
from now on, I know nothing.

236
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:06,260
I know nothing about my life,
what I'll do or become.

237
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,970
Then I realized
that mom is dead,

238
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,100
and I can't ask her anything.

239
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:28,070
I was overcome with sorrow for
myself and cried again.

240
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:44,690
You must think I'm a very
nervous person, but I'm not.

241
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:51,670
- Do you think Henrik is suicidal?
- If he'd kill himself?

242
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,180
In an extreme situation like
the one you're describing...

243
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,180
could he hurt himself?

244
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:05,220
You know, to be honest,
I don't know my father very well.

245
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,980
I only know that deep
inside he's... good.

246
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,560
If not, mom never...

247
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,170
Mom loved him, you know?
They loved each other.

248
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,660
And I suppose I was
out of that love.

249
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,980
That's what I think when I'm feeling sorry for
myself and I get tired of my boyfriends.

250
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,580
Why can't I feel love
like mom did?

251
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,650
Were you afraid your dad would
kill himself after her death?

252
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,920
I never gave his
tragedy much thought.

253
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,390
But I tried to take care of mom,
as much as he'd let me.

254
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,110
Mom was never very talkative.

255
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,570
But on one of her last days...

256
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,680
She was always drowsy
from the morphine...

257
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,160
On one of her last days,
I was sitting beside her,

258
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,990
she looked at me and said clearly:

259
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,930
"You know I love you".

260
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,000
"You know I love you, Karin".

261
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,570
My mother never spoke that way.

262
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,920
Dad once said as a joke,
this was a long time ago,

263
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:56,390
"Anna never says I love you, but
her actions are always full of love".

264
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:08,200
- What if grandfather comes back?
- It's OK, I've got another bottle.

265
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,990
- Were you really married to grandpa?
- Is that so strange?

266
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,190
It's hard to imagine it.
What kind of person is he?

267
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,170
Good question.

268
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,300
- Did you love him? - I've asked myself
the same question all my life.

269
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,710
- Was he so difficult?
- We were married for 16 years.

270
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,410
Then we got divorced.
He had met another woman,

271
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,020
an idiot named Paula.

272
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:02,400
I got married again to
a boring glider pilot.

273
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,190
One day, he just flew away.

274
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,470
They never found him.

275
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,970
For some reason, Johan and I
got together several times.

276
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:24,020
Then I found out
he was servicing...

277
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,680
another lady,
a real whore.

278
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,490
I was angry and hurt
and finished with him.

279
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,890
I suddenly realized,

280
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:41,470
that I was the most cheated on
wife and lover in the world.

281
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,900
Johan was remarkably and
compulsively unfaithful.

282
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,910
- You mean that my grand father
-...was a real liar.

283
00:30:53,650 --> 00:31:00,520
And he used to write poems. A volume got
published, but it wasn't successful.

284
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:06,680
- My grandfather used to write verses?
- Yes, even love poems for me.

285
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,330
- Did you keep them?
- No.

286
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,020
But did you love him?

287
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,570
I was terribly naive.

288
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,610
Nowadays, I suppose it's just
not possible to be so, so childish...

289
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,690
and so know-it-all like I was.

290
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:44,590
I think I loved him.
Utterly.

291
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,260
- You never suspected?
- Not for an instant.

292
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,500
- What made you come here
suddenly? - I don't know.

293
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:04,280
You still love him!
Don't you?

294
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,390
If you had to be honest,
Marianne...

295
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:22,570
I hear people say Johan
is this or that,

296
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,470
not very kind things usually.

297
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,270
But I don't know the Johan
they're talking about.

298
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:39,510
I always thought he was a good man.
Very, very good.

299
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,020
It was so easy to hurt him,
he could never defend himself.

300
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,620
I believe that Johan...

301
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,700
is a moving person.

302
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,930
He's moving.

303
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,380
- Are you crying?
- Yes, a little.

304
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,620
Are you crying for granddad?

305
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:25,390
- I'm crying for Johan
and Marianne. - I understand.

306
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,200
This is strange.

307
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,080
Dear...

308
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,190
- What will you do?
- Return to Henrik.

309
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,190
- Is that intelligent?
- It has nothing to do with that.

310
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,290
I'll stay here a few more days.
Let me know what happens.

311
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,710
I will.

312
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,580
THREE
About Anna

313
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,100
It can't happen again.

314
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,000
- Never again.
- Never.

315
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,010
We must have a serious talk.

316
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:51,310
We both know how things are.
There's nothing to sort out.

317
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,610
I'm glad it's so simple!

318
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,190
I was scared to death.

319
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,280
There's no other way to put it:
I was scared to death.

320
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:08,400
- Do you understand? - I'm very
tired. I'm going to sleep.

321
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,580
- Are you asleep?
- No.

322
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,530
Once I had a similar
situation with Anna.

323
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,930
We weren't married yet,
but we lived together.

324
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:57,070
Maybe I was a little drunk.
I said nasty things about...

325
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,410
the damned university,

326
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,390
my colleagues,
our work environment.

327
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,720
And then about my father,
that old bastard.

328
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,970
Anna didn't say a word.
And that upset me even more.

329
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,930
I remember thinking...

330
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,610
"What's on Anna's mind,
while she's sewing that skirt?"

331
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:35,950
"What's she thinking? Maybe
that Henrik is unbearable".

332
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,120
And then she said it.

333
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,630
"When you're like this,

334
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,500
I start thinking that you're
not the man I planned to marry".

335
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,230
Then she went to the living
room and started to pack.

336
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,710
I tried to stop her.
She didn't move...

337
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,080
but a message got through
from her body to mine.

338
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:08,510
It said "I'm leaving...
I'm leaving you".

339
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:18,090
Then I said, with a voice that was
foreign to me: "Nobody leaves me".

340
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,230
"Nobody leaves me"

341
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:35,110
"Nobody turns his back on me
and leaves... ".

342
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:45,110
I sat on the floor and
thought: "It's over".

343
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:09,510
I shut my eyes and thought:
"Anna's leaving and she won't return".

344
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,920
But then I heard her
going around the kitchen.

345
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,320
She was making coffee.

346
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:32,090
But she didn't say a word.
Maybe she wanted to sober me up.

347
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:40,400
She didn't say anything for the rest
of the evening: just kept on sewing.

348
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:47,110
Anna was the silent type
anyway, she never spoke much.

349
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,490
But we didn't need to speak;
we always knew...

350
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,900
I begged her to forgive me.

351
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:04,130
Like a child to his mother:
"I won't do it again".

352
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,600
It's just what I want to say to you,
but it sounds ridiculous.

353
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:18,150
Anyone can say "I'm sorry",
but it's meaningless.

354
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,090
So no further words
were spoken that night.

355
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:34,330
It became a...
distant night.

356
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:44,970
Anna sunk into a deep sleep: I
stayed awake listening to her breathing.

357
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:52,110
I watched her, a street light
shone through the window.

358
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:59,290
I gazed at her for a long time and
wondered if she really knew...

359
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,490
how much I loved her.

360
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:17,100
Between Anna and me it was a question
of belonging, if you know what I mean.

361
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:26,110
An ownership that was...
a miracle. I know it sounds fatuous.

362
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,120
There's no better word.

363
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,290
I fell asleep as dawn approached,
and when the alarm clock rang,

364
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,730
we got up, had breakfast
and chatted as usual.

365
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,500
I went to a class
and Anna went to the library.

366
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,150
This is an explanation:
not an excuse.

367
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,650
I have no excuses.

368
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,100
If you leave me...

369
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:17,400
I’ll be ruined, or some other
word that doesn't exist.

370
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,870
In due time, you'll have your freedom.
You'll go to the conservatory...

371
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,410
With professional teachers
and a different life.

372
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,990
It'll be different for me also.

373
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:48,600
These months with you have
been "a state of grace".

374
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,530
For me, that is,
not for you.

375
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,300
It was kind of you
to return so soon.

376
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:05,110
I don't know what to say.
It's all so complicated.

377
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,040
We don't have to
speak about that.

378
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,960
Sometimes I feel a great
punishment awaits me.

379
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,530
FOUR

380
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:57,100
About a week later,
Henrik visits his father.

381
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,370
"Kierkegaard, S.
Or A Fragment of Life"

382
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,960
- Am I interrupting?
- Oh, so it's you.

383
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,290
It's been a long time.

384
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:37,200
- How are you?
- Well, thank you, and you?

385
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,140
At 60 there's 6 things wrong with you,
at 70, 7 and so on.

386
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,350
It's a good evaluation: Of course,
it depends on your priorities.

387
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:08,600
- I heard about your ex wife's unexpected visit.
- Typical Marianne.

388
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,700
She's always known I
hate improvisation.

389
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,040
- Maybe I can see her.
- She's gathering strawberries.

390
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,710
I don't know if you'll be
here when she returns.

391
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,220
- I don't mean to disturb you.
- Thanks for being considerate.

392
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,400
What do you want?

393
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,880
I need 890,000 kroner.
An advance on my inheritance.

394
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,000
- You need money again.
- I know, I owe you 200,000.

395
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:53,450
- That you haven't even begun to pay back.
- Don't worry, I'll pay it back.

396
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,520
I'm sure I'll never
see that money again.

397
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,360
It's funny to
consider it a "loan".

398
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,290
If humiliating me amuses you,
let's not forget...

399
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm not paying rent
on the lake house.

400
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:19,440
We've been there for five months
and you haven't seen a cent.

401
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,140
But you were able
to buy a new car.

402
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,940
It's a loan.
The owner is away.

403
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,510
When he returns in October,
I'll be without a car.

404
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:37,530
- How's the book going?
- Well, thank you.

405
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,660
That's a thorough answer.

406
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:50,010
I've been here ten minutes,
letting you humiliate me.

407
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,210
If I didn't need the money,
I'd have left long ago.

408
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,750
You can leave now.

409
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,070
It's not for me.
It's for Karin.

410
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:22,500
I see...
Marianne told me you two argued.

411
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,410
Are you trying to make her stay?

412
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,010
Do you think she'll accept a bribe?

413
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,210
I wonder how Anna
was able to stand you.

414
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,510
Don't bring Anna into this.

415
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,650
Don't you dare mention
Anna with that mouth.

416
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,020
I like you more or dislike you
less when you use that tone.

417
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,640
There's a healthy dose of
hate in your banalities.

418
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,520
It's like this:

419
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,250
There's a cello I can buy Karin;
an 1815 Fagnola.

420
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,130
It's an excellent instrument,
almost like a Guarneri.

421
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,330
Karin has a special talent,
she could become a great musician.

422
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,440
I took care of her instruction,

423
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:31,910
but her talent calls for more.
Like her cello.

424
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,240
Her German cello is passable,

425
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,610
but she'll audition
for the conservatory.

426
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,520
Are you sure it's good?

427
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,520
It wouldn't be the first
time they fool you.

428
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,660
It has an authenticity certificate

429
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,260
- and the seller is decent.
- Is that why it's so cheap?

430
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:02,040
He's old and sick and can't
take care of it any more.

431
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:08,410
- He said it's perfect for her.
- How touching.

432
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,130
Dad, where does all this
hostility come from?

433
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:39,970
Speak for yourself. When you were
18 or 19 I tried to approach you.

434
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:46,380
You had been very ill and your
mother wanted us to talk.

435
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:53,750
I told you I knew I had been a bad father,
but I wanted to make it better.

436
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,620
And you screamed.
Yes, screamed:

437
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,730
Bad father?!
You never were a father!

438
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,730
Then you said you could
do without my help.

439
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:15,670
Honest hate must be respected;
I respect it.

440
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:21,620
But I couldn't care less if
you hate me. You hardly exist.

441
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,050
If it wasn't for Karin,
who thank God is like her mother,

442
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:31,960
you wouldn't exist at all for me.

443
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,330
There's no hostility here, I swear.

444
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:46,440
Give me the name and number
of the cello owner and I'll see.

445
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,160
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

446
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:24,540
- What's your answer?
- I'll let you know.

447
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,350
Can I go?

448
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,160
I'm leaving.

449
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,230
- Can I just say one thing?
- Only if you must.

450
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:52,240
That tale of an argument
fifty years ago in no excuse.

451
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,270
Poor Anna.

452
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,050
Will you hit me now?

453
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,520
FIVE

454
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,000
I hope I'm not interrupting.

455
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,970
No, I've just finished.
I practice in the mornings.

456
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,440
The organist is expecting:
I'm replacing her.

457
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:14,640
- I thought you played the cello.
- I have an organ diploma.

458
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:19,090
In my time,
it was smart to have one.

459
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,520
There were a lot of churches
and few orchestras.

460
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,430
What were you playing?

461
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,330
A Bach sonata for a trio.
First movement.

462
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:36,640
- It was beautiful.
- This is a unique organ from 1728.

463
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,040
Nobody knows how it ended up here,
in the middle of nothing.

464
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,140
A few weeks ago, Karin and I
played a concert here.

465
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,550
It was almost full.

466
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,650
- Will you be playing any more concerts?
- I don't have the time.

467
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,530
Karin has to prepare her audition
and I have to finish my book.

468
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,570
Yes, I'm writing a book about
Bach's Passion of St. John.

469
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:11,540
I met Karin.
They say she's talented.

470
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,740
She's considered exceptional,
and not only by her dad.

471
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,440
- Are you her teacher?
- That's the way it's turned out.

472
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:25,090
In the conservatory, she'll
have the best European teachers.

473
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,760
- Won't it be difficult to let her go?
- Yes.

474
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,000
You could say that.

475
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,330
- Do you love her a lot?
- Yes.

476
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,730
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.

477
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:52,010
- Karin is like Anna.
- She doesn't look like her.

478
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,050
What's wrong?

479
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:04,150
Whenever I mention Anna,
I cry. That's the way it is.

480
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,620
I can't help it.

481
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:16,070
She's been dead for two years and
it still hurts just the same.

482
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,340
That's the way it is.

483
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,350
Life itself has become a ritual.

484
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:36,260
I don't know, I can't find
words to describe it.

485
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,560
I've become a handicapped person.

486
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:46,570
Just like that.
Handicapped.

487
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,410
Karin is everything that
lends sense into my life.

488
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,040
And so...

489
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,550
It wouldn't have much
sense without her.

490
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,430
I think a lot about
death these days.

491
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,400
I think:

492
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,080
One day I'll walk through
the forest to the river.

493
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:33,350
A foggy, windless autumn day.

494
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,250
Absolute silence.

495
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:45,160
Then I see someone
by the gate.

496
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:51,370
Coming towards me. She's
wearing a denim skirt...

497
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,970
A blue jacket...

498
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,240
She's barefoot and her hair
is tied up in a long pony tail.

499
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,270
And she's walking towards me.

500
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:13,150
Anna is walking towards me,
through the gate.

501
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,260
And then I realize I'm dead.

502
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,470
Then something strange happens.

503
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:29,540
I think: "Is it this easy?"

504
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:39,050
We spend life thinking about
death and what comes after.

505
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,740
And then it's so easy.

506
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:51,600
I can see a flickering light
in the music. Like Bach.

507
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,370
- I think I understand.
- Come for dinner tonight.

508
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:04,670
- We're good cooks.
- Thanks, I like that.

509
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:09,650
I have to go now,
we've got a class.

510
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,650
Karin gets angry
if I'm late.

511
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:18,250
- See you soon.
- Wait, I don't think I can go.

512
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,790
- I understand. The old man
would get mad... - No.

513
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,290
- Why did you come here?
- I don't know.

514
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,430
You're a lawyer, right?
Can I sue him?

515
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:44,980
- Why would you want to do that?
- He's got a fortune and won't die.

516
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,650
He's probably mummified
by his own evil.

517
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:56,250
I asked him for an advance on my
inheritance, but he humiliated me.

518
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,330
I'd love to sue him.

519
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,090
Not while he's
mentally competent.

520
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:07,040
- He's not ill in that sense.
- No, he's not ill.

521
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:13,680
Are you here to ask for money
for a poor abandoned wife?

522
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:18,150
Don't get angry.
Of course I ask myself.

523
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,550
You haven't had
contact for decades.

524
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,780
I'm not here to ask for money.

525
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,280
Are you fucking?

526
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:33,570
Do you hate him so much to
have to talk this way?

527
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:40,370
Forgive me for desecrating this
place and ruining our chat.

528
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:45,670
I hate him in all possible
dimensions of the word.

529
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:52,020
I hate him so much, I would like to
see him die from a horrible illness.

530
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:58,350
I'd visit him every day,
just to witness his torment.

531
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:06,290
Maybe I'm just a pathetic
soul. Theoretically.

532
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,260
I see surprise and displeasure
in your eyes.

533
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:16,200
As a lawyer,
you should be used to...

534
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:20,680
the stupidity and repulsiveness
in the world.

535
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,580
Goodbye, Marianne. It was nice
of you to listen to me.

536
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:38,560
Sometimes I think I'm insane.
I suffer all the time.

537
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:34,170
SIX
AN OFFER

538
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,780
- Karin!
- Hi, granddad.

539
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:01,100
- Well... this is my study.
- I haven't been here for years.

540
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:07,160
You and Anna would come sometimes,
when you were living at the lake house.

541
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:11,610
- You used to smoke then.
- Yes, you're right.

542
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:15,310
I stopped when I read
Freud's biography.

543
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,040
33 operations for a mouth cancer.

544
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:23,220
- And even then he couldn't stop smoking.
- Bur are you all right?

545
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:27,420
Unless you consider
aging an illness.

546
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:35,390
- That's a beautiful picture of mom.
- I found it by chance.

547
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:41,170
I had it blown up...
and there it is.

548
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:47,410
I think of mom every day.
And dream of her at night.

549
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:53,180
I thought the pain would subside.
But that's not happening.

550
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:59,580
But it doesn't hurt like in the
beginning, now it's here.

551
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:05,450
Like a part of me.
I wouldn't want to be without her.

552
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:10,600
I can say I miss her,
painfully.

553
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,800
We didn't see each other very often,
due to Henrik and I.

554
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,940
Anna tried and tried.

555
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,780
But Henrik and I never
managed... well, you know.

556
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:28,680
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Yes, sit down.

557
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:35,590
Last night, Mrs. Nilsson came
personally to deliver a letter.

558
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,560
Meaning that dad shouldn't...

559
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,960
That was all right.

560
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,070
He's in Uppsala with his orchestra.

561
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:49,370
I have here a letter that came a
few days ago, and it involves you.

562
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:56,170
- Have you heard of Ivan Chablov?
- Director in St. Petersburg.

563
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,280
He toured here recently with
the philharmonic. Fantastic!

564
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:10,190
I've known him since my years in
Leningrad. This letter is from him.

565
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,760
"Johan, my dear friend and brother".

566
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:20,000
"Sorry for writing in my
poor English and German"

567
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,400
"but my excellent secretary

568
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:27,580
has just had twins".

569
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:34,780
"It's very important that I
write you, my dear friend".

570
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,320
"For the following reason:"

571
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,820
"On a free night, I went to a
young musician's concert".

572
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:48,060
"I must say I was
surprised and happy".

573
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:53,770
"A young female cellist was playing...

574
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:58,500
"a Zoltan Kodaly solo piece."

575
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,510
"And I was surprised by that
young performer's talent."

576
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:10,120
-"Her maturity, her skill
and courage". - Well, I'll be!

577
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,080
"The school gave me her name...""

578
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:19,600
"and told me her father
was her teacher."

579
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:24,400
"I got in touch with him,
but he rejected me curtly,"

580
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,260
"maybe arrogantly is a better word."

581
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:32,570
"My dear Johan,
I know you're ..."

582
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:34,270
her grandfather.""

583
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:38,410
"And that's the reason why
I'm writing you."

584
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:44,520
"The young lady's technique is
risky, somewhat lacking:""

585
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:50,060
"which could result in
a future catastrophe".

586
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:57,500
"I'm a guest professor at
Helsinki's Sibelius Academy,""

587
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,670
"One of the best in Europe."

588
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,300
"I have a good rapport
with the president."

589
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,510
"And we could, after
the mandatory exam,""

590
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:16,010
"offer our young cellist
a quality education..

591
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:21,420
that her talent
obviously deserves."

592
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:30,290
Let me know your answer as soon
as possible. My embrace, Ivan.""

593
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,400
So, Karin, what do you say?
Maybe I should add...

594
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:42,000
that I'll take care of all your
expenses as long as you need it.

595
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:49,680
I've spoken to the cello seller:
I've made him a good offer.

596
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,810
More than he was asking for.

597
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,020
So if you want it, it's yours.

598
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:00,120
Assuming, of course, that you
accept Chablov's kind offer.

599
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:08,000
I don't know what to say.
It's overwhelming.

600
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:12,700
I understand this letter puts
you in an awkward situation.

601
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:17,770
- I'll write him and tell him
that you're... - Flattered.

602
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:21,780
But that your decision
affects others.

603
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:28,380
- Others?
- Your father, specifically.

604
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,390
I need to rest.
Goodbye, Karin.

605
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,690
Thanks for the chat.

606
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:42,200
Marianne used to say that I was
a terrible character judge.

607
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:50,680
That I didn't understand emotions.
But even I understand this:

608
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,280
Your mother lived
in this world...

609
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:57,050
to do the most unbearable chore.

610
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,210
Darkness got even darker...

611
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,420
and light faded away
when Anna died.

612
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,530
It's hard for Henrik. To live.
Despite everything.

613
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,500
You're like your mother.

614
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,600
And I'm fond of you, Katja.

615
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:17,500
- Goodbye, Karin.
- Goodbye, grandfather.

616
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:30,000
SEVEN
ANNA'S LETTER

617
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:27,590
- To Henrik from Anna?
- I found it in a book.

618
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:35,040
May 18. Anna...

619
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:38,080
wrote it one week
before dying.

620
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,620
I'd like you to read it.

621
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:49,020
I can't understand Anna's handwriting.
You'll have to read it to me.

622
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:56,190
I'll try.
Here, have some whisky.

623
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,610
Mom had found out a
few days before...

624
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,710
that she didn't have
much time left.

625
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,740
She wrote the letter because
Henrik had a cold...

626
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,580
and wasn't allowed to visit her.

627
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,420
It says:

628
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,290
"The fact that you can't
visit me is, perhaps,

629
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:26,590
a relief for both".

630
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:32,060
"We understand each other well.
You open the door."

631
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,400
"I make an effort.
You make an effort".

632
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:42,310
"But I still see in your
eyes how sick I am".

633
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,590
This is the difficult part.

634
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:58,050
- She writes about dad and me.
- Is that painful?

635
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,100
Yes.

636
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:05,200
When you were with
her at the hospital,

637
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,830
did you speak about
what she had written?

638
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:13,800
- No, never.
- What did she write?

639
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:30,190
"Dear Henrik, I have to tell you
something of which we've never spoken".

640
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:35,630
"I've wanted to talk
to you about Karin".

641
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:41,500
"But it was never necessary
because I was always there".

642
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:46,410
"Then I got sick
and I was there no longer".

643
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:53,710
"Of course I was there,
but you kept me apart".

644
01:14:55,490 --> 01:15:02,450
"You and I love each other.
I was sure about our love".

645
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:07,220
"But no love is strong enough...

646
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:13,600
to stand a devastating
effect like my illness".

647
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:20,540
"I see that you love Karin, but that
you also tie her to you".

648
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,850
"It's good that you were her
teacher, but there's a limit".

649
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:32,610
"When I'm no longer there,
the limit will be unclear".

650
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,820
"I know that Karin loves you".

651
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:43,600
"But you mustn't use her love.
You'll hurt her".

652
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,600
"That could be a permanent wound".

653
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:56,610
"That's why I ask
you to let her go".

654
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:01,420
"You shouldn't take
advantage of her kinship".

655
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:08,280
"Don't take advantage of her because
you're her self-proclaimed teacher.

656
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,220
"Dearest Henrik".

657
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:20,100
"You're so sensitive,
so considerate, so kind".

658
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:26,340
"I know it, without a doubt,
after so many years together".

659
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:32,850
"But you must be careful
not to burden Karin...

660
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:38,620
with the orphaned love that will remain
when I'm no longer there".

661
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:46,390
There's more,
but I don't want to read any more.

662
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:51,030
I can't.
It hurts so much!

663
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:55,410
I can hear my mother's voice!

664
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,240
Karin...

665
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:08,720
Why did you reach out to me?

666
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:14,120
- You're very involved.
- You could say that.

667
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,790
- And you know about granddad’s
plans. - He told me.

668
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:25,540
I don't expect advise,
I need to hear my voice aloud.

669
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:29,710
I believe things will
clear up this way.

670
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,400
Go ahead, speak.

671
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:40,220
- Mom saw.
- Yes, I think so.

672
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:44,320
And everything she warned
about has happened.

673
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:51,620
- I can't accept grandfather's
offer. - Why not?

674
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,620
If I leave Henrik, he'll die!

675
01:17:56,630 --> 01:18:01,400
If I leave him, he'll die...
I'm sure about it, Marianne...

676
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:05,410
He doesn't even have
his orchestra anymore!

677
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,750
He can go on with his music,
but the county is reorganizing...

678
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:19,060
and dad will not be part of
the administration: he'll resign.

679
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:25,360
I can't leave him.
I'm so tired of him sometimes!

680
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,520
I know all the things
I can do in the future.

681
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,410
But mom is dead, and Henrik
can't manage his own life.

682
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:43,840
How do you think I'd feel with the
guilt if something happened to him?

683
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:49,610
My future and Henrik's
are entwined for now.

684
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:58,430
- At least you say "for now".
- Only for consolation.

685
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:05,800
- I want you to know that I don't
feel the same as you. - I know.

686
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:23,740
- Anna's love...
- That letter is love.

687
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,420
Isn't it?

688
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,830
I don't know.

689
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:38,830
EIGHT

690
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,810
- Back already? - There wasn't
much to do in Uppsala.

691
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:53,620
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, little Katja.

692
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,560
What score is that?

693
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:06,490
Bach's suites for cello!
You're mad!

694
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,460
Listen, Anderberg suggested
that you and I...

695
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,730
play a concert in November.

696
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:19,530
- It's very hard for me.
- We'll play together.

697
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:25,450
- What do you mean together?
- Like a dialogue, facing each other.

698
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:29,380
You'll play the parts you can handle
and I'll play the difficult ones.

699
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:35,050
Especially the prelude.
It'll be great!

700
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:39,820
- Which parts can I play?
- The Sarabandes, for example.

701
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:46,600
- It takes a lifetime to tame them.
- We have three months.

702
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:51,030
- And my audition?
- It's almost ready.

703
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,110
And students get permission
to play concerts.

704
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,740
I've spoken to Börtz.

705
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:04,510
It'll be good for the both of us,
now that I don't have the orchestra.

706
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,730
I won't even be the first
violin any longer.

707
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:17,270
- Dad! You must be furious!
- Perhaps.

708
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,530
But now I'll have
more time for you.

709
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:25,040
- I can help you better.
- Yes, of course.

710
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:31,840
That doesn't sound
very encouraging.

711
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,850
Hello, Katja, darling.

712
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:55,230
I have a feeling an
argument is coming.

713
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,850
- What's wrong, Katja?
- I don't know.

714
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:13,150
That is, I think I know,
but I don't know how to...

715
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:47,220
I know you've talked
to your grandfather.

716
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:53,730
- And with the bitch, I mean Marianne.
- Yes.

717
01:22:55,270 --> 01:23:02,170
- I see. You did it beautifully.
- I must decide.

718
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,730
- I thought you had already done that.
- No, you did it.

719
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:12,380
Really? I mean,
is that what you've been thinking?

720
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,510
Dad...
I haven't bothered to think.

721
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:23,120
I thought, "Dad knows
what's best for me".

722
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:35,730
Perhaps you've already made
up your mind, haven't you?

723
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:39,740
Will you accept your
grandfather's offer?

724
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,120
- Have you read this?
- I have.

725
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:58,320
- You read the letter that mom
wrote me? - It speaks about me.

726
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:02,160
But it was for me!
And you read it. Just like that.

727
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:09,230
Do you think that's all right
because it speaks about you?

728
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:13,830
If you're going to get so upset,
it's no use talking about it.

729
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:16,810
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

730
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,420
- I said I'm sorry, damn it!
- Why do you say you're sorry?!

731
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:26,750
Shall we get to work?
Or is there something else?

732
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,330
Dad...

733
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,570
It'll be painful.

734
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:41,570
For you or for me?

735
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,160
It may sound stupid,
but your tone frightens me.

736
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:51,150
I've made up my mind. For the first
time in my life it's my decision.

737
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:55,410
- But are you sad?
- Yes, I'm sad.

738
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,720
If you had told me you
had that letter from mom...

739
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:09,430
If you had let me read it,
maybe we could have...

740
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:16,330
You never told me...
You should have...

741
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:26,140
- Well, that's the way it is.
- How?

742
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:34,350
Next week, I'm going
to Hamburg with Emma.

743
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:39,520
She and I will be going to a school
for young orchestra musicians.

744
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:46,360
Claudio Abbado will come in
October and we'll go to Munich.

745
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:58,080
It's for young people from all over Europe.
You can't be older than 22.

746
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:04,450
Abbado will work with us for six weeks
and we'll play four concerts.

747
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:12,330
Emma recorded a video. She sent it
to the admission committee, as a joke...

748
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,260
We played Brahms.

749
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,360
Emma and I
got a letter...

750
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:23,430
which says the school accepts us.

751
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:25,670
That we're welcome.

752
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,340
And that...

753
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:35,650
That's exactly
what I want to do.

754
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:40,060
And it's exactly what
I've decided to do.

755
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:44,330
And the conservatory?

756
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:58,770
- How long is the Hamburg course?
- Two years.

757
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:04,550
Then there's a paid internship in
an Austrian or German orchestra

758
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,570
Three years.

759
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:13,550
- How will you pay for it?
- I have my inheritance.

760
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:20,660
- You've been thinking a lot.
- I told Emma it was useless.

761
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:24,230
That you had already decided.

762
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:32,240
God...

763
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:37,840
Oh God...

764
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:47,850
But dad, I don't want to...
I don't consider myself a soloist.

765
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:54,330
I want to play in an orchestra,
be part of a team effort.

766
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:59,400
Not sit down in a stage,
alone and exposed.

767
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:05,340
I don't want strangers to say
that I'm not good enough.

768
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:10,780
I want to decide my own future.
I want a simple life

769
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,150
I want to be... home.
To live a normal life.

770
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:20,060
Not a poor substitute for mom...

771
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:24,560
who gets your praise
for something I'm not.

772
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,820
It has to end.

773
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:31,860
And now it's ended.

774
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:41,330
At least,
give it the perfect ending.

775
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,640
What are you talking about?

776
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:57,420
Wouldn't you like to
play the fifth Sarabande?

777
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,230
- Right now?
- Yes, please.

778
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:18,130
NINE
CRUCIAL MOMENT

779
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,280
He's here.

780
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,340
Thank you.

781
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:31,750
- Can I ask who it was?
- From the hospital.

782
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:36,650
Henrik tried to commit suicide.
With pills.

783
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:40,890
Then he cut his arms
and neck with a knife.

784
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,220
He's in intensive care.

785
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:47,770
Call this number and
ask for nurse Ingegerd.

786
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:53,240
- God. - They found him
at the last moment.

787
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:56,270
A certain Mrs. Berg
was walking by the house...

788
01:30:56,410 --> 01:31:01,350
- and saw a naked person
on the floor. - God.

789
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:05,350
The door was unlocked.

790
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:09,080
She tried to wake him up,
but he was unconscious.

791
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:15,660
And bleeding. The ambulance
took 20 minutes. - My God.

792
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:21,530
I should call Karin,
but she's on her way to Hamburg.

793
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:29,510
Henrik systematically fails at everything.
He can't even kill himself.

794
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:35,550
- Say something, for God's sake.
- You want me to answer that?

795
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:41,650
- Whatever. Say something spontaneous
for once. - You can't.

796
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,760
Sometimes you act like
a forgotten character...

797
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,760
in some stupid old movie.

798
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,770
- You're not real.
- You don't say.

799
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:59,270
- Right now... no, let's leave it.
- No, go on.

800
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:03,510
Where did you gather
all this disdain?

801
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:05,770
I didn't remember you like this.

802
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,350
- Disdain?
- Yes!

803
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:12,790
I don't know. Any disdain
I have is for myself.

804
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:16,650
I don't know.
I never thought of it this way.

805
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:23,660
- And the poor boy?
- Boy?

806
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:30,140
Ah, Henrik. Maybe he realized
he was a lot like me.

807
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:36,240
I was never like him. So ridiculous
all the time. Obese and submissive.

808
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:42,480
He surrounded me with a sticky love.
I admit I ignored that love.

809
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:52,120
He was as dedicated as a dog.
I wanted to kick him, metaphorically.

810
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:59,360
- What will happen now?
- How will this affect Karin?

811
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:06,670
- She'll blame herself.
- She should have thought about it.

812
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:13,240
- Do you think she'll return home?
- I don't know.

813
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:18,850
- You'll speak to her, won't you?
- If we find her.

814
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:23,150
I'll hire you as my agent.
How much do you charge?

815
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:25,420
Money is no problem.

816
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:29,050
As long as you put her
guilt in a safe.

817
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:34,660
What if she comes?
She loves that bastard.

818
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:39,140
- That would be disastrous!
- Yes, I believe so.

819
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:50,650
What can I say?

820
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:54,480
I was so close to Anna.

821
01:33:56,490 --> 01:34:00,260
It was terrible when she left.
For me also.

822
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:06,660
Even though I was on the
outskirts of the catastrophe.

823
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:12,340
It's incomprehensible that Henrik...

824
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:14,880
had the privilege
of loving Anna.

825
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:18,440
And that she loved him.

826
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:25,580
- You're smiling ironically.
- No.

827
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:32,290
I'm not smiling.
I'm trying not to cry.

828
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,060
There's no reason for you to cry.

829
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:40,660
There is, but I won't
give any explanations.

830
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:47,840
TEN
THE HOUR BEFORE THE DAWN

831
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,670
Marianne.

832
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:29,110
Marianne!
Sorry to wake you up.

833
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,750
It's all right.
I'll go back to sleep.

834
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:39,750
- What's wrong? Johan?
- I don't know.

835
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:49,560
- I think it's anguish.
- Anguish? What do you mean?

836
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,460
- I see! You're sad!
- I'm not sad...

837
01:36:55,510 --> 01:37:01,170
It's worse. It's an anguish
from hell. It's bigger than me.

838
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:05,180
It's trying to make way through
every orifice in my body;

839
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:13,880
my eyes, my ass. It's like a huge
mental diarrhea!

840
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:21,450
I'm too small for this anxiety.

841
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:23,360
Are you afraid of death, Johan?

842
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:26,470
More than anything,
I'd like to scream.

843
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:31,900
What can you do with a baby
that won't be comforted?

844
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:36,410
- Come, lay by my side.
- There's no room.

845
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:42,120
- We've slept in smaller beds.
- We won't be able to sleep.

846
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:47,020
It doesn't matter. Not in
the last days of our lives.

847
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:52,360
I have to take off my shirt.
It's damp from my diarrhea.

848
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,120
Come on.

849
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:02,700
You take it off too.

850
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:04,470
Yes

851
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:38,510
Come on, Johan.
Come here.

852
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:48,310
There... lie down.

853
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:03,400
- Good night, Marianne.
- Good night.

854
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:24,120
Could you explain why
you turned up here?

855
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:28,650
- I thought you were calling me.
- I never called anyone.

856
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:33,390
- I had it in my head.
- How strange.

857
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:37,360
I understand your not understanding.

858
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:43,700
- How long will you stay?
- I have a case on the 27th.

859
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:46,770
- November?
- October.

860
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:54,380
- Good night, again.
- Good night.

861
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,880
Perhaps you're asking
yourself how it came out.

862
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:06,750
I stayed with Johan
until early October.

863
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:12,030
Our time together
was relaxingly pleasant.

864
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:16,760
We almost never talked about
sensitive subjects.

865
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:20,310
The last night we celebrated.

866
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:23,570
Nothing out of this world,
but good enough.

867
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:28,280
We promised to remain in touch.

868
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:31,790
I think we even fantasized
about a trip to Florence...

869
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,190
the next spring.

870
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:37,120
That trip never
happened, of course.

871
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:42,800
But we used to speak on
the phone on Sundays.

872
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:48,470
Then, one day Mrs. Nilsson
answered the phone.

873
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:53,680
She said that Johan
couldn't take any calls,

874
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:56,400
but that he would write.

875
01:40:56,650 --> 01:41:01,580
I asked if he was all right;
she said yes, as far as she could tell.

876
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:05,520
That he was just tired and
that he would be writing.

877
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,380
I never got a letter, of course.

878
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:13,360
I wrote him, but never got an answer.

879
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:16,560
That's all I know.

880
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:20,160
Things are always all
right with me. In order.

881
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:26,300
Everything in its place. Maybe I'm a
bit lonely, but I don't know.

882
01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:34,610
Sometimes... I think of Anna.

883
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:41,880
I wonder how she
managed her life.

884
01:41:47,730 --> 01:41:50,490
How she spoke...

885
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,870
How she moved...

886
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:00,110
Her look...

887
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:05,780
That almost surreal smile.

888
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:12,680
Anna's feelings.

889
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:18,390
Anna's love.

890
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,570
Well...

891
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:38,300
Something happened to me that
perhaps is related to this.

892
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:45,710
When I came back, I visited
my daughter Martha at the sanatorium.

893
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:18,910
But I thought about
the enigma...

894
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:28,490
that for the first
time in our lives...

895
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:33,830
I realized...
I felt...

896
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:39,430
that I was touching my daughter.

897
01:44:42,210 --> 01:44:43,600
My baby.
