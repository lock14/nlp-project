1
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,643
That's my train.

2
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,874
Wait! Wait!

3
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,192
Shit. Ow.

4
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,959
Wake up, Jack.

5
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,937
Have you seen Francis?

6
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,068
Hello, Peter.

7
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,585
- Good afternoon. Whitman?
- Yeah, that's us.

8
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,671
May I see your tickets, please?

9
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,220
Thanks.

10
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,061
There's no smoking, please.

11
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,364
Welcome aboard.

12
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,065
Sweet lime?

13
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:28,870
- Sure, I'll have one.
- Yes, please.

14
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,955
Sounds good.

15
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,764
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.

16
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,853
I want to start by thanking you both
for being here.

17
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,865
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,420
Thank you.

19
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,690
You're the two most important people
in the world to me.

20
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,485
I've never said that before, but it's true,
and I want you both to know it.

21
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,198
- I love you, Peter.
- Thank you.

22
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,659
- I love you, Jack.
- I love you too.

23
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,956
How did it get to this?
Why haven't we spoken in a year?

24
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,332
Let's make an agreement.

25
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,459
- To do what?
- Okay.

26
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,503
I want us to become brothers again
like we used to be...

27
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,922
and for us to find ourselves
and bond with each other.

28
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,232
Can we agree to that?

29
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,365
- Okay.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,719
I want us to make this trip
a spiritual journey...

31
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,638
where each of us seek the unknown
and we learn about it.

32
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,446
Can we agree to that?

33
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,331
- Sure.
- I guess so.

34
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,186
I want us to be completely open
and say yes to everything...

35
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,313
even if it's shocking and painful.

36
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,815
Can we agree to that?

37
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,902
Now, I had Brendan make us an itinerary.

38
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,071
- Who's Brendan?
- My new assistant.

39
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,074
He's going to place an updated schedule
under our doors every morning...

40
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,619
of all the spiritual places and temples
that we need to see...

41
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,121
and expedite hotels and transportation
and everything.

42
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,873
How's he going to do that?

43
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,084
I had him bring a printer
and a laminating machine.

44
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,628
- Where is he?
- In a way, it actually doesn't matter.

45
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,297
He's in a different compartment
on another part of the train...

46
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,841
but we never see him... ever.

47
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,928
That's more or less it.
Three, please.

48
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,347
- Does that sound okay to you?
- It sounds good, sure.

49
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,557
- Yeah, it sounds good.
- Do you have any questions?

50
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,851
- I do.
- Okay. Go ahead.

51
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,521
What happened to your face?

52
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,065
I only remember certain details...

53
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,150
but from what I've been able
to reconstruct...

54
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:27,113
it was raining, I was going about
50 miles an hour as I went into a corner...

55
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,949
did some wrong steering,
wheels went out from me...

56
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,118
and I suddenly skidded off the road...

57
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,704
slammed into a ditch
and got catapulted 50 feet through the air.

58
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,917
Uh, little particles of glass and debris
were stinging my face as I flew.

59
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,378
And for a second,
there was just total silence.

60
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,089
Just.

61
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,592
Then bam, the bike crashed to the ground,
exploded and caught on fire...

62
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,929
and I smashed on the side of a hill
with my face.

63
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,141
I was driving home.
I live alone right now.

64
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,936
Anyway, two joggers ran up
and started digging out all the dirt...

65
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,523
that was jammed inside my mouth
and my nose and my ears.

66
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,901
My brain had stopped,
my heart had stopped...

67
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,654
so technically I was dead at this point.

68
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:13,617
They did all the procedures exactly right,
as a result of which I'm still alive.

69
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,202
- Boy.
- Wow.

70
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,083
The first thing I thought of when I woke up
was, "I wish Peter and Jack were here."

71
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,815
- Have you heard anything from Mom?
- No.

72
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,193
- Have you?
- No.

73
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,987
Me neither.

74
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,364
Fuck.

75
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,287
- What's that?
- Some kind of Indian muscle relaxer.

76
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,706
I got it at the pharmacy
next to the train station.

77
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,959
- What's that?
- You don't need a prescription here.

78
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,837
A type of Indian flu medicine.
It's got a tranquilizer in it.

79
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:10,299
- What's that?
- Strongest Indian painkiller you can get.

80
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,635
It's for my face.
Uh, be careful with that.

81
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,054
You only want to take one drop.

82
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,477
Shh.

83
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,395
I also lost a tooth.

84
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,817
You want to read a short story
I wrote in France?

85
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,153
- How long is it?
- What?

86
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,990
- How long is it?
- How long is it? Never mind. Forget it.

87
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,744
You can save it till after dinner.

88
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,000
You know, maybe right before whenever
you're about to take out your tooth...

89
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,920
you should say something like, "Please forgive
this," because it's actually, It's kind of...

90
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,257
Can you... Can you back away a little?
You just spit in my eye.

91
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:58,681
When was the last time
you were in America, by the way?

92
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,600
I don't know. The funeral.

93
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,269
In other words, a year?

94
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,691
I have to tell you, I support
this relationship not working out.

95
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,403
May I take your order, please?

96
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,864
Let's see. Do we want meat or fish?
I'm going to have the chicken.

97
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,325
Jack, you want to try the fish?
I bet that's delicious.

98
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,786
And, Peter, the lamb?
A chicken, a fish and a lamb?

99
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,955
How does that sound?

100
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,790
And who wants a soup?
Raise your hand.

101
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,961
- Are those Dad's glasses?
- Yeah.

102
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,383
You still have his prescription in here.

103
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,385
How can you see in these?

104
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,471
- Three soups.
- Soup. Yes.

105
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,975
Could you not order for me, please?

106
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,978
- What?
- Order for yourself.

107
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,947
What part are you on?

108
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,575
Nothing. It reminded me
of something not related to it.

109
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,202
How's Alice?

110
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,164
She's fine.

111
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,500
She actually started this company
where she makes these little clay pots.

112
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,502
They're quite popular.

113
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,465
- We sent you one.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

114
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,176
Oh, thank you.

115
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,849
I want that stewardess.

116
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,438
These... These Germans are bothering me.

117
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,736
Ladies! Please, keep it down.
Lower your voices. Thank you.

118
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:45,120
Did I raise us? Kind of?

119
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,834
Hang on. I'm going to ask this guy
if he can get me a power adapter.

120
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,884
She's pregnant. Alice.

121
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,389
- Really? You're kidding.
- No.

122
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,559
- Uh, how long?
- Seven and a half months.

123
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:12,022
It's... It's... So it's going to be born
in, like, six weeks or something.

124
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,566
I think so, yeah.

125
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,069
I'm trying not to get
too caught up in it right now.

126
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,113
Don't tell Francis.

127
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,074
Brendan got the wrong voltage.

128
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,368
Your soup, sir.

129
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,957
Please forgive this.

130
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,506
Hmm.

131
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,428
Is it supposed to be sad?

132
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,555
I think so.

133
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,517
Well, I'm not too crazy about the part
where I start screaming at the mechanic.

134
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,603
- That never happened.
- The characters are all fictional.

135
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,481
May I take your dessert order, sir?

136
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,526
Let's see. Do we want sweets or fruit?
I'm going to have the pudding.

137
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,779
Jack, you want to try the cake?
And, Peter, what looks good to you?

138
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,282
The cookies?

139
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,285
- He's going to order for himself.
- The cookies.

140
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,956
Excuse me. I'm...

141
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,340
Has he been rooting around
and taking things?

142
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,634
Maybe. I think he's still in mourning.

143
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:27,639
Well, I probably am, too, but there's something
kind of unethical about it, isn't there?

144
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,893
Legally, those glasses belong
to all three of us.

145
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,919
I'm going to take this bed, because
I'm the oldest and my ankle's fractured.

146
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,171
Peter, you don't mind climbing a ladder,
as I recall...

147
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,632
so why don't you set up shop topside?

148
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,301
And, Jack, you're a little
bit of a lone wolf.

149
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,387
Why don't you bunk out next door?
How does that sound?

150
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,271
- Oh, sorry. I was...
- Stand up.

151
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,274
- Brendan, this is Jack.
- Good evening.

152
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,276
- And this is Peter.
- Hello, Brendan.

153
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,820
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's update me.

154
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,448
- How's everything going back there?
- Pretty good.

155
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,743
- What does that mean?
- I never heard back.

156
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,745
So try again.
What are you waiting for?

157
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,666
- Well, I left a message.
- Why are you smiling?

158
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,669
What do you think he looks like
under all that tape and everything?

159
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,420
Brendan, what did I tell you?

160
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,865
Well, I don't know about his face, but I
think his brain might be pretty traumatized.

161
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,261
Damn it!
Come down to this spot over here.

162
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,430
Call her again right now and keep calling
every 10 minutes until you get through.

163
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,558
- Okay.
- This is urgent. We're almost there.

164
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,435
- Okay.
- And once again, so we're explicitly clear...

165
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,564
I don't want you to mention this
or discuss it with anyone.

166
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,567
- In other words, it's a surprise.
- Okay.

167
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,361
- Did you find me a power adapter?
- Not yet.

168
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,656
How long are you going to stay here?

169
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,118
What do you mean?
He said till the end of the month.

170
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,161
Uh huh.

171
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,163
Why do you ask that?

172
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,750
I'm just trying to know
so I can figure out my plans.

173
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,128
- What plans?
- I don't know yet.

174
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:25,716
Anyways, I've got my own ticket,
just in case. Don't tell Francis.

175
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,468
Well, I'm not going to stay here
with just me and him.

176
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,638
Is that one of Alice's pots?

177
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,725
Oh. We should order some more of these.

178
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,311
- I'll tell Brendan.
- Okay.

179
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,688
He has this disease
where his head is shaved...

180
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,775
except he doesn't have to shave it because
he can't grow any hair in the first place.

181
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,361
Don't talk about it around him though.

182
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,072
It might offend him.

183
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,402
Are these Dad's keys?

184
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,989
- Yeah.
- You've got his car keys too.

185
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,743
Where's those nuts at?

186
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,087
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

187
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,256
Good evening, Mr. Whitman.
How can I help you?

188
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,176
Is it possible for us to get some more
of those Savoury Snacks, please?

189
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,512
Of course.
Can I offer you anything else?

190
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,431
- Um, I don't think so.
- I'll be right back.

191
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,434
I forgot something.

192
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,984
Do you want to smoke a cigarette with me
in the bathroom?

193
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,125
You're crazy.

194
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,127
What's your name?

195
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,379
Jack. What's yours?

196
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,922
Rita.

197
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,966
You're beautiful.

198
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,094
Don't come into me.

199
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:31,109
Jack's got his own return ticket.
He says he might leave early.

200
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,446
- What are you talking about?
- Don't tell him I told you.

201
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,782
Brendan's got all the tickets.
There's a whole itinerary.

202
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,825
Where's he going?

203
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,460
Air Italiano? What the fuck is this?

204
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,339
I'm keeping his passport.
In fact, give me yours too.

205
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,383
I want to keep all the passports
so nothing happens to them.

206
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,469
- I'm keeping mine.
- No.

207
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,721
I want to keep them all together.

208
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,896
Why are you standing there?

209
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,648
I'm waiting for you.

210
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,693
Mr. Whitman, the whole point of us coming out
separately is so no one sees us together.

211
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,487
- Jack.
- Jack.

212
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,489
Right. I get it. Okay. Good night then.

213
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,533
Go back to your compartment.

214
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,747
Move over, please.

215
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,340
Where are the Savoury Snacks?

216
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,342
Huh?

217
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,263
Did you just fuck that Indian girl?

218
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,349
What?

219
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,184
Sweet Lime.

220
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,770
Of course not. I went for a walk.

221
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,856
Something just happened.

222
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,876
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Who's he talking to?

223
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,296
No one. He's got the code
to his ex-girlfriend's answering machine...

224
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,298
and he's checking her messages.

225
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,759
What? When... When did he
confide that to you?

226
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,053
Just now.

227
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,139
Why am I not a part of this?

228
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,686
I've never liked that girl.

229
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,688
Me neither.

230
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,940
Anyway, I never trusted her.

231
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,006
I don't feel good about myself.

232
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,178
Okay. Let's make another agreement.

233
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,932
On the spiritual journey, it's crucial
that we don't splinter into factions...

234
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,726
or not include somebody who has advice
and may know better.

235
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,770
- Can we agree to that?
- Okay.

236
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,647
- What'd you find out?
- Nothing.

237
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,649
Good.

238
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,069
She put this in my suitcase.

239
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,241
- Is that her?
- Mmm, that's her.

240
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,119
How did she gain access
to your personal belongings?

241
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,622
She came to see me in France for 24 hours.

242
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,041
- Could she be gaslighting you?
- What's gaslighting?

243
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,711
Okay, hang on a second.
Let's make another agreement.

244
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,465
From now on, if you want to talk to her
or check her messages...

245
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,301
you speak to us first,
day or night, any time.

246
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,387
Can you agree to that?

247
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,140
I think we should destroy that.

248
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,146
Jesus!

249
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:59,234
Okay. All right.
Let's check the itinerary.

250
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,699
Give me a little light.
Okay, here we go.

251
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,160
Train stops first thing tomorrow morning
for an hour and 45 minutes...

252
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:13,039
which is just enough time for a quick visit
to Temple of a Thousand Bulls...

253
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:17,419
probably one of the most spiritual places
in the entire world.

254
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,787
Wow.

255
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,708
Power adapters!

256
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,128
- Can I get a power adapter?
- Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,965
- Do you have a power adapter?
- No, no. No power adapter. Use battery.

258
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,967
- No? I mean, I can't have one?
- Wow.

259
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,554
Hey, do you have these in, uh, say,
a 10 and a half medium? Like, uh...

260
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,391
- These all size. Take off shoes and try.
- Yeah, like that. That's good.

261
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,810
Pepper spray.
What ingredients does this have in it?

262
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,897
- I don't want to kill anybody or anything.
- No, no, not for killing.

263
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,691
- Uh, spray in face.
- Okay. Spray in face.

264
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,401
Spray in face.

265
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,782
Most rare. From desert. Very poisonous.

266
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,535
How much you want for him?

267
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,666
This is incredible!

268
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,388
Ring it.

269
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,318
Take some of these rupees and put them
on this thing in front of the deity here.

270
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,994
Is that my belt?

271
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,957
- Can I borrow it?
- No, not right now.

272
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,543
I was looking for that earlier.

273
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,551
Ask first.

274
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,553
- Next time.
- All right.

275
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,763
Where's my passport?

276
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,432
I got pickpocketed.
My passport got stolen.

277
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,560
Calm down. It's not stolen.

278
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,480
- No. Yes, it is. It's gone.
- No, it's not. I have it.

279
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,566
I'll be right back.

280
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,070
- You stole my passport?
- Peter, where are you going?

281
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,199
I'm going to go pray at a different thing.

282
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,167
- I hear ear you're leaving early.
- What are you talking about?

283
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,336
- I thought we made an agreement.
- That's why you stole my passport?

284
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:09,215
Well, no, but I think we have a chance to make
this kind of a life-changing experience...

285
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,509
and I think we need it.

286
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,179
In other words, I don't want you to leave.

287
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,765
- He's going to have a kid in six weeks.
- Who?

288
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,185
Him. Rubby. He doesn't want you to know.

289
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,562
- "Rubby"?
- Yeah, you know, Rubby.

290
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,647
Yeah.

291
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,401
Why doesn't he want me to know?

292
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,322
Because we don't trust each other.

293
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,160
Wow. Right?

294
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,704
- Great. Thanks.
- Amazing.

295
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,789
Let's get a shoeshine.

296
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,838
Oh. Hit it.

297
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,637
Hey. Hey, come back here!

298
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,388
- What?
- The kid just left...

299
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,641
- Who?
- He just... Get him!

300
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,392
- He left his shoeshine kit.
- He...

301
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:05,230
Well, now he can pay for this whole
building. Those are $3,000 loafers!

302
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,316
- Yeah, but he only got one of them.
- Yeah, but that's...

303
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,112
We're in an emergency here.

304
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,115
I got my face smashed in,
Jack's heart's been ripped to shreds...

305
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,159
and Rubby's having a child!

306
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,079
- Let's get into it!
- You told him?

307
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,081
It's okay. Okay?

308
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,125
That's what we're here for,
to start trusting each other.

309
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,962
I don't get it, by the way.
Why aren't we celebrating?

310
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,090
Because I don't want to talk about it.

311
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,550
Well, why not?

312
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,513
I guess because I always expected
eventually I'll get divorced.

313
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,474
So having children
really wasn't part of my plan.

314
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,060
Okay. But you're never going to
do better than Alice.

315
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,772
- And what's the point in getting married...
- Why'd you expect to get divorced?

316
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,857
I don't know. I love Alice.

317
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,528
Maybe it relates to how we were raised.

318
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,702
I was going to save this
for later in the itinerary...

319
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,704
but I think it's time.

320
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:07,292
There's a ceremony I want us to do where
we each take one of these peacock feathers.

321
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,128
We're going to go off into the wilderness
and meditate for...

322
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,130
Damn it, I gave them to Brendan.

323
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,340
That's all right.
We'll do it after the next stop.

324
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,801
- Those guys are laughing at us.
- Where?

325
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,057
I love it here.
These people are beautiful.

326
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,228
They're playing cricket with a tennis ball.

327
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,822
Hello. How do you do?

328
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,574
Hello.

329
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,162
It's great.

330
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,789
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's so well-written.

331
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,833
You remember everything so clearly.

332
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:53,171
Peter getting all frantic getting the
car started, you with the suitcase.

333
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,882
The characters are all fictional.

334
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,843
Well, anyway, I think it's the best thing
you've ever written.

335
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,428
Thank you.

336
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,199
Here are the peacock feathers,
plus some instructions from the guru.

337
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,451
- What's in that box?
- He bought a snake.

338
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,371
- It's got a skull and crossbones on it.
- Let's update me.

339
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,500
Anything?

340
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,752
- She got the message, yeah.
- And?

341
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,754
- What? That's it.
- That's it?

342
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,173
She got the message.
You're satisfied with that?

343
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,760
- Well, she knows you're coming.
- Does she want to see us?

344
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,222
But she's your mother.

345
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,236
Happy birthday from last year.

346
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,906
I can't accept this.
It's too valuable.

347
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,325
It's got one wrong initial,
but you can paint over it.

348
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,452
It's from me and Jack.

349
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,891
Yes?

350
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,310
- Would you like tea?
- Okay.

351
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,032
Thank you.

352
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,236
I've got to get off this train.

353
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,669
What's her name again?

354
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,713
Rita.

355
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,217
- Snake isn't in the...
- What'd you say?

356
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,601
There's a hole in it. He escaped.

357
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,603
No, he didn't.

358
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,605
How?

359
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,568
- Jesus Christ.
- There he is!

360
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,570
Get him.

361
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,990
Now you... Now you believe me, assholes?

362
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,330
We think a snake might've gotten on board!

363
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,471
Don't go in there, Rita!

364
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,644
You got him!

365
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,993
I'm kicking you off at the next station.

366
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,704
Please don't do that. We're very sorry.
It won't happen again.

367
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,914
I know it won't.

368
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,959
- What's that smell?
- Voltaire #6.

369
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,341
- Do you have a prescription for these?
- Prescription?

370
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,344
I almost died.

371
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,764
Give me a second.

372
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,945
That animal's deadly poisonous,
and you brought him onto my train.

373
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,033
We didn't know. It was an accident.
We're just trying to experience something.

374
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,121
It's very important to us.

375
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,302
You're confined to your compartment
until further notice.

376
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,387
Is our snake getting confiscated?

377
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:29,298
Do you think it's working?
Do we feel something?

378
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:32,134
- I hope so.
- It's got to.

379
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,450
Do you trust me?

380
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,750
Where are we?

381
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,443
Brendan, what's going on?

382
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,737
I don't know.
I guess the train's lost.

383
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,281
- What'd he say?
- He says the train's lost.

384
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,366
How can a train be lost?
It's on rails.

385
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,786
Apparently we took a wrong turn
at some point last night.

386
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,829
- That's crazy.
- How far off course are we?

387
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,915
Nobody knows.
We haven't located us yet.

388
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,958
- What'd you just say?
- What?

389
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,711
- What you just said. Say it again.
- We haven't located us yet.

390
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,756
Ah! Is that symbolic?

391
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,968
"We haven't located us... yet."

392
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:42,223
- Where's those feathers at?
- In the envelope I gave you this morning.

393
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,975
Meet me on top of that thing out there.

394
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,329
The guru told me when the moon turns...

395
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,629
Do you trust me?

396
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,218
I hired a private detective
to track down Mom.

397
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,012
She's living in a convent
in the foothills of the Himalayas.

398
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,056
We'll be there in six days.

399
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,778
How is that possible?

400
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:41,866
I guess she became a nun, apparently.
You know what she's like.

401
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,951
- A nun?
- Apparently.

402
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,037
- Did you talk to her?
- No, I didn't.

403
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,957
- Does she know we're coming?
- I think so.

404
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,751
How do you know she wants to see us?

405
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,837
She probably doesn't.

406
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,424
But maybe she does.

407
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,635
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

408
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,264
Because I'm trying to protect you
from all the painful emotions...

409
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,266
this is probably going to stir up.

410
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,685
Well, aren't you kind of
doing that right now?

411
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,981
Yeah. I'm scared too.

412
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,901
She's obviously suffered
some kind of mental collapse...

413
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,361
and we've got to go get her
and bring her back home.

414
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:25,326
Actually, it's in the itinerary,
but I put it under T.B.D.

415
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,664
Why are you laughing?

416
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:34,001
You didn't tell us because we never
would've come here if we knew about it.

417
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,635
I'm going to hold this
in for a little while.

418
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,785
You going to drink
that whole bottle of cough medicine?

419
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,371
That's a dumb way to get loaded.

420
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,879
- Let's look at the itinerary.
- Fuck the itinerary.

421
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,811
You know, I think I'm going to have to
get that belt back after all...

422
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:28,222
because it cost me $6,000,
and it was made special for me.

423
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,227
- We'll get you a different present.
- I don't think so.

424
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,312
What is that supposed to mean?

425
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,315
It means there's been
too much Indian giving over the years.

426
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:48,367
These guys are driving me crazy. Is there
an empty compartment I can move into?

427
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,579
No, there isn't. We're fully booked.

428
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,374
I really want to kiss you right now.
Can I?

429
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,464
- No.
- No?

430
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,050
But we already... did it. I don't...

431
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,928
- I have a boyfriend.
- You do?

432
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:12,474
Actually, I just broke up with him.
Or I'm about to.

433
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,104
I really need someone
to talk to right now...

434
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,441
and I feel like you might be
very important to me in my life.

435
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,404
All right.

436
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,464
What did I tell you?
Get back in your room.

437
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,011
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?

438
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,929
- I rang the bell.
- I'll be right there.

439
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,236
Is that Dad's razor?

440
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,782
- Yeah.
- Can I say something?

441
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,366
What?

442
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,745
You don't have permission to take his
property that belongs to all of us...

443
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,955
and use it for yourself as if it's yours.

444
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,333
Jack agrees with that. Right, Jack?

445
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,543
Plus, Dad would have hated it.

446
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,797
- Why?
- That's my opinion. I knew him well.

447
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,843
- That's a terrible thing to say.
- Well, I don't mean it to be.

448
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,222
I just don't want you to get the feeling that
you're better friends with him than we are...

449
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,224
or something weird like that.

450
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,268
And also, you can't leave your wife
just because she's pregnant.

451
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,063
Jack agrees with that too. Right, Jack?

452
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,399
- Stop including me.
- I was his favorite.

453
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:48,487
He told me that with blood all over him,
laying in the street, right before he died.

454
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:54,034
How is that supposed to make us feel?

455
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,205
I want my passport back.

456
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,458
- Francis?
- Yeah?

457
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,836
Here's your belt.

458
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,847
Fuck. Stop!

459
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,061
Oh!

460
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,278
- You don't love me!
- Yes, I do!

461
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,739
I love you, too, but I'm going to
mace you in the face! Stop!

462
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,125
- I had to do it!
- Jack, come back! Now, you wait... just...

463
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,294
Help me wash it off.

464
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:50,757
Stop including me!

465
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,404
- I'll find us a hotel.
- The next train's in 24 hours.

466
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,781
This just came in.

467
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,867
Why are your eyes all red?

468
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,578
Why is your head so bald?

469
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,830
Because I have alopecia.

470
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,791
Oh, yeah. That's like albino, right?

471
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,420
Not really.

472
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,672
Jack maced us.

473
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,891
Was I just mean to Brendan?

474
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,852
He's not coming back. He just quit.

475
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,146
He did, didn't he?

476
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,732
- Can we at least get our snake back?
- It's dead.

477
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,777
You killed him?

478
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,240
Your fake tooth's gone.

479
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,783
Fuck.

480
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,827
What did you say?

481
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,913
Shame on you!

482
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,795
Did you get maced too?

483
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,298
No, I'm crying.

484
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,060
What's wrong with you?

485
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,649
Let me think about that.
I'll tell you the next time I see you.

486
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,236
Sure. Tell me then.

487
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,323
Thanks for using me.

488
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,205
You're welcome.

489
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,797
Good-bye, Rita.

490
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,882
So long, Sweet Lime!

491
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,091
"Dear boys"

492
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,845
<i>Bad timing. This morning I received
the details of your travel plans...</i>

493
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,639
<i>in a document sent to me
from a man named Brendan.</i>

494
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,601
<i>Unfortunately, I cannot receive you now.</i>

495
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,396
<i>A neighboring village requires our
urgent assistance due to an emergency...</i>

496
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:55,317
<i>not to mention the recent arrival
of a man-eating tiger in the region.</i>

497
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,695
<i>I suggest you come in the spring
when you'll be safe with me.</i>

498
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,699
<i>You must know how sad I am
to experience this long separation.</i>

499
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,702
<i>I hope you'll eventually understand
and forgive me.</i>

500
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,205
<i>God bless you and keep you
with Mary's benevolent guidance...</i>

501
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,332
<i>and the light of Christ's enduring grace.</i>

502
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,795
<i>All my love,
your mother, Sister Patricia Whitman.</i>

503
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,880
That sounds like bullshit to me.

504
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,715
- Me too.
- Obviously.

505
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,134
She's trying to sell us a vacuum cleaner.

506
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,040
I'm sorry.

507
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,711
- Me too.
- I wasn't trying to aim for your face.

508
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,800
It doesn't matter.
It's already demolished.

509
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,929
Let's just go home.
She doesn't want to see us anyway.

510
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,014
You don't think so?

511
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,059
Not even on some primordial level?

512
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,562
No.

513
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:16,815
She's been disappearing all our lives.

514
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,153
We weren't raised
to be treated like that.

515
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,196
It's just not done.

516
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,992
Maybe this is how it's supposed to happen.

517
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,994
It could all be part of it.

518
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:32,873
Maybe this is where
the spiritual journey ends.

519
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:42,549
You read the instructions, right?

520
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,472
Okay, let's do it.

521
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,853
- I'm going to go over here.
- Yeah. That's good. Get on the rock, yeah.

522
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,313
- Peter, you got... Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

523
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,273
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

524
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,399
- Ah! Oh!
- Zsa-loh!

525
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,450
- Okay, that's it.
- That's it? Okay.

526
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,035
All right.

527
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,006
Which direction did yours go?

528
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,842
- What do you mean?
- Your feathers.

529
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,886
- Mine blew towards the mountains.
- That's not right.

530
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:32,265
- It's not supposed to get blown away.
- You're supposed to blow on it...

531
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,683
and then bury it.

532
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:37,103
I didn't get that. I still have mine.

533
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,023
You guys didn't do it right.
I asked you if you read the instructions.

534
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,025
You did it wrong.

535
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,947
I tried my hardest.

536
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,784
I don't know what else to do.

537
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,540
I don't think Dad would've hated it.

538
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,417
Did he really say you were his favorite?

539
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,630
I don't know.
I could barely understand him.

540
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,840
He wasn't really breathing.

541
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:10,053
I wonder if the three of us
could have been friends in real life.

542
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,556
Not as brothers, but as people.

543
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,309
Well, we probably would've had
a better chance, I guess.

544
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:23,191
Let's make another agreement. We'll all come
back here in the spring when the flowers...

545
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:26,319
We're never coming back here.

546
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,947
Let's just find an airport
and go our separate ways.

547
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:37,038
Wouldn't it sound great if you could hear a
train going by off in the distance right now?

548
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,500
- Not really.
- Probably be annoying.

549
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,228
Look at these assholes.

550
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:08,236
That's going to tip over.

551
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,655
Go!

552
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,413
Get the little one.

553
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:22,125
Francis!

554
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,085
Grab him.

555
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,174
Don't let go of me.

556
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:30,925
Pull. He's all tangled up.

557
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,767
Here you go.

558
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:45,357
- Hold on! Whoa, whoa! Oh...
- Hang on. Hang on. I got you.

559
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,404
I can't get him out.

560
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,199
Whoa!

561
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,242
Peter!

562
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,586
He's all bloody!

563
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,427
- He's dead. He's dead.
- He's dead?

564
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,137
- The rocks killed him.
- You're bleeding like crazy.

565
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:19,683
- Peter, you okay?
- I didn't save mine.

566
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,772
What's his name?

567
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,261
- Papa!
- Hey.

568
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,722
Papa!

569
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,306
Hey!

570
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,893
Thank you.

571
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,114
Can you explain that I almost had him?

572
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,496
I lost him when we went off the rocks.
He was too slippery.

573
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,541
I had him the whole rest of the time.

574
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:16,336
I want them to know that.

575
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,688
What are you doing in this place?

576
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:40,568
Well, originally, I guess we came here
on a spiritual journey...

577
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:43,112
but that didn't really pan out.

578
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,849
We're invited to the funeral.

579
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,689
Okay.

580
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,008
I can't believe you just said that.

581
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,386
- Why not? It's the truth.
- He didn't really mean it.

582
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,389
I think you're all equally grief-stricken.
Let's just leave it at that.

583
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:19,018
- When does Mom get in?
- She's going straight there from the airport.

584
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:26,400
- I want to pick up the car.
- We're already late.

585
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:29,445
- Tell the driver to take a right.
- We don't have time.

586
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,990
- Let's do this later.
- No. I want to get it now.

587
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,992
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

588
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,662
Uh, we're going to need
to make a stop first at this address.

589
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,959
Go ahead.
I'll be right behind you.

590
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,961
I think we should wait for you.

591
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,712
Why?

592
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,715
Francis.

593
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,677
Tell them we'll be there in five minutes.

594
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,445
Hey. Hey.

595
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,282
- Hey.
- Yeah.

596
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,242
We're here to pick up
Mr. Whitman's car.

597
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,369
No, uh, Mr. Whitman's car is not ready.

598
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,998
- What do you mean it's not ready?
- No, we're waiting for a... a part.

599
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,000
- A part?
- Yeah.

600
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,845
- Uh, I left a message with his secretary.
- No, no, no. That's crazy.

601
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:29,255
This car's been here for three months.
He can't wait any longer.

602
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,049
He'll have to wait another week.
Uh, I left a message.

603
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:35,970
Yeah, he didn't get the message.
Mr. Whitman is dead. You understand?

604
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,851
- Jimmy Whitman?
- Yeah.

605
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:45,563
- Oh. What happened to him?
- He got hit by a taxi.

606
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,691
- And it killed him?
- Yeah.

607
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,152
His change was scattered
all over 72nd Street.

608
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,282
Oh, you're his sons.

609
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,202
Right. And we're going to take this car...

610
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,245
to his funeral, which we're late for
right now.

611
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,915
- Where are the keys?
- Peter, we'll come back later and get the car.

612
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,918
It's not ready. Right?
It's not ready!

613
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,649
The battery's dead... too.

614
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,905
There it is. That's the other one.
We found it.

615
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,617
We're still waiting for a part
to come in from Stuttgart.

616
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,702
- Where's a battery charger?
- What are you doing?

617
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,204
- This one's mine.
- No, it's not.

618
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,097
We need to take it home and enter
it in the inventory along with the...

619
00:59:46,122 --> 00:59:47,274
I'm taking this suitcase.

620
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,418
You going somewhere?

621
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,380
I don't know.

622
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:55,633
Where's the goddamn battery charger?
Ah. Aha!

623
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:59,136
- I guess he didn't read my book in time.
- What do you mean? In time for what?

624
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:02,181
- The envelope's never been opened.
- Oh, you mean when he was still alive.

625
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:10,314
Phone call for a Francis Whitman.

626
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,696
- Hello.
<i>- They want to start.</i>

627
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,698
Send the car back for us.
The battery's dead.

628
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,951
<i>They can only wait 10 minutes.
There's another service after us.</i>

629
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,537
Okay. Well, we might not make it then.

630
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,872
I guess just...

631
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,958
tell them to go fuck themselves.

632
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,543
<i>Hold the line.</i>

633
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,129
<i>No, you're going to start when they
get here, not one second before.</i>

634
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:36,882
<i>Is that perfectly clear? Is that
perfectly clear? Try to be quick.</i>

635
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,467
- Okay.
<i>- Wait a second.</i>

636
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,678
- Yes?
<i>- I spoke to your mother.</i>

637
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,472
<i>She's not coming.
She didn't get on the plane.</i>

638
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:46,851
- Why not?
<i>- I don't know. I'm sorry.</i>

639
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:49,854
<i>Will you tell Peter and Jack,
so they don't expect to see her?</i>

640
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:55,026
- Yeah.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

641
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,778
Thanks, Alice.

642
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,489
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

643
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,952
Put it in second!

644
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,954
Put it in second!

645
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,666
Pop it!

646
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,171
Watch it, asshole!

647
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,384
- What do you want?
- Are you kidding me?

648
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,346
- Fuck, no.
- You get back in your car right now.

649
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,056
Get back in that car!

650
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,313
This isn't going to work.
Let's put the cover back on it.

651
01:01:42,338 --> 01:01:43,015
Let's go.

652
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:45,409
Come on. Steer it in.

653
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,755
Let's go.

654
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:22,154
- Who called?
- Alice.

655
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,657
- What'd she say?
- They're waiting.

656
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,201
Mom there?

657
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,203
Not yet.

658
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,367
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Help him up.

659
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,540
You okay?

660
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,934
Let me help you.

661
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,044
Whitman.

662
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,213
The flight boards in 25 minutes.

663
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,715
Let's set aside the next 10 minutes
to use as free time.

664
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,010
Do a little shopping, have a snack,
make a phone call.

665
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:58,472
And then we'll meet in the bathroom
next to that statue over there...

666
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,099
about a quarter after.

667
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:03,018
Get cleaned up, brush your teeth,
have a shave or what have you...

668
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:06,897
and in our last five minutes we'll sit
quietly in that little shrine over there...

669
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,191
say a prayer and think about everything
we've been through.

670
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,610
<i>Flight 45 to Mumbai...</i>

671
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:15,739
<i>with continuing service
to Frankfurt and points west...</i>

672
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:19,201
- Three, please.
<i>- Please stand by for further information.</i>

673
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,829
I love the way this country smells.
I'll never forget it.

674
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:24,873
It's kind of spicy.

675
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,875
Who's he talking to?

676
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:31,046
I think he's trying to rehire Brendan.

677
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:34,049
He said he's going to offer him a 50% raise
plus some medical benefits...

678
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,385
to help with his albino disease
or whatever it's called.

679
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:39,388
How'd it go?

680
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:42,057
He's going to think about it.
He's got to get hired back...

681
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:45,477
because otherwise
I'm probably just a bad person.

682
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,897
And in some ways
I feel like Brendan might be my...

683
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,524
friend maybe.

684
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,526
I'll be right back.

685
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,323
He didn't really kill our snake, did he?

686
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:02,288
I mean, it's got to be against his religion. I...
I bet he just... sent him out into the desert...

687
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,830
which is actually closer
to his natural habitat.

688
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,332
Who's he talking to?

689
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,918
Probably checking
his ex-girlfriend's messages again.

690
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:13,505
I thought we made an agreement.
Why didn't you stop him?

691
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,555
- What'd you find out this time?
- She's going to meet me in Italy.

692
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,516
- Oh, man, that's terrible.
- I know.

693
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,478
I'll be right back.

694
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,610
Let's look at the itinerary.

695
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:37,488
<i>Flight 45 to Mumbai...</i>

696
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,949
<i>with continuing service
to Frankfurt and points west...</i>

697
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,869
<i>has been detained by 15 minutes.</i>

698
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,872
<i>Please stand by for further information.</i>

699
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,921
Is that from Sweet Lime?

700
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:57,299
- Who's he talking to?
- I didn't say that. I didn't want...

701
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,343
Hello?

702
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,889
Alice, I guess.

703
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,316
- It's a boy.
- It got born already?

704
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,027
It's going to be a boy.
She had a... somnogram or something.

705
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,695
- It's a boy?
- That's incredible!

706
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,280
- Wow.
- Yeah.

707
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,453
Why were you yelling?

708
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:29,081
She's angry because I didn't tell her
I was coming here.

709
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,668
- Ever? Until just now?
- Yeah.

710
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:35,212
But I explained everything.

711
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:39,800
It's actually kind of lucky,
because... I got this vest.

712
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:43,095
It could work with either one,
but I think it's better for a man.

713
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,727
Here. He can inherit this.

714
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,772
It's from me and Jack.

715
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,025
Thanks.

716
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,987
Thanks.

717
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,959
Can I use those scissors?

718
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,438
I guess I've still got
some more healing to do.

719
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,193
You're getting there though.

720
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:25,030
Anyway, it's definitely going to add
a lot of character to you.

721
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:47,386
What should we pray for now?

722
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,817
Didn't you get my letter?

723
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,737
I told you to come back in the spring.

724
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,990
- Should we go?
- Of course not.

725
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:35,494
Oh, welcome, my beautiful boys.

726
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,872
Francie. Peter. Little Jack.

727
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,211
What happened to your face?

728
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:47,714
I smashed into a hill on purpose
on my motorcycle.

729
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:53,095
I'm sorry to hear that.

730
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:56,098
There are so many things we don't know
about each other, aren't there?

731
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,811
Who's this?

732
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:05,565
That's Oberoi. He got us here.

733
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,609
Wait a second.
What are you saying to him?

734
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,903
I'm telling him to lock up your horses.
There's a tiger.

735
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:12,197
Really? We thought that was bullshit.

736
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,199
You call that bullshit?

737
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:19,704
He ate one of the sister's brothers.

738
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:22,624
I'm not kidding.

739
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,372
What do we want for breakfast?
Jack, you'll like the porridge.

740
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:05,584
Peter, fresh mango.
And corn flakes for you, Francie.

741
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,878
Now, who wants scrambled eggs?
Raise your hand.

742
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,632
What's on fire in that
hideous little flowerpot?

743
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,384
Alice made that.

744
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,803
Oh, it's darling.
Tell her I said so.

745
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,389
- Okay. You want one?
- Of course I do.

746
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,910
- Mom?
- Uh huh?

747
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,163
There's one last thing.

748
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,469
I want to tell you about my son.

749
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,680
- What son?
- The one I'm going to have next month.

750
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:06,228
- Well, you should be with Alice.
- You should've been at Dad's funeral.

751
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,522
So that's why you came here.

752
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,733
We came here because we miss you.

753
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,526
I miss you too.

754
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:17,030
But why didn't you come to Dad's funeral?

755
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,032
Because I didn't want to.

756
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,745
See, what... Why are we talking this way?

757
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,914
What's wrong with us?
We should be celebrating.

758
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:30,710
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. These people need me.

759
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,462
What about us?

760
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:43,598
You're talking to her.

761
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:46,351
You're talking to someone else.
You're not talking to me.

762
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:51,106
I don't know the answers to these
questions, and I don't see myself this way.

763
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,108
Listen.

764
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:56,778
I'm sorry we lost your father.

765
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,990
We'll never get over it,
but it's okay.

766
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,242
There are greater forces at work.

767
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,286
Yes, the past happened.

768
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:08,123
But it's over, isn't it?

769
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:09,958
Not for us.

770
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,551
I told you not to come here.

771
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,522
Maybe we could express
ourselves more fully...

772
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:35,525
if we say it without words.

773
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,950
Should we try that?

774
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:37,063
All right. Let's make an agreement.

775
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:39,357
We'll get an early start
tomorrow morning...

776
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:43,069
and try to enjoy each other's company
here in this beautiful place.

777
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:47,282
We'll stop feeling sorry for ourselves.
It's not very attractive.

778
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:50,743
We'll make our plans for the future.
Can we agree to that?

779
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:51,151
Sure.

780
01:19:51,176 --> 01:19:52,176
- Yeah.
- Okay.

781
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,210
To be continued.

782
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:22,484
- Good morning.
- She's gone.

783
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:25,737
- What?
- She's gone.

784
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,906
I was still asleep,
but Oberoi saw her go.

785
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,578
- Peter.
- What?

786
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,747
- She's gone.
- Who?

787
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:42,170
She's gone?

788
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:43,713
Where?

789
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:47,175
They couldn't say.
They just said she goes away sometimes.

790
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,761
She left our breakfast in the doorway.

791
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,500
Whoo!

792
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,509
Zip!

793
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,478
Shoo!

794
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:08,107
I'm working on a new short story.

795
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:10,401
I wrote the ending,
but I don't know how it starts.

796
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,403
Read us what you got.

797
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,406
"'Whatever happens in
the end, she said..."

798
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,283
"'I don't want to lose you as my friend."

799
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:22,080
"He looked into her eyes. I promise I will
never be your friend, no matter what, ever."

800
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:25,249
"Her voice cracked. If we fuck, I'm
going to feel like shit tomorrow."

801
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,751
"'That's okay with me, he said."

802
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,587
"He lifted her shirt over her head.
I love you, she said."

803
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:32,006
"'I never hurt you on purpose.
He nodded."

804
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:35,885
"I don't care.
He would not be going to Italy."

805
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,680
- That sound okay?
- Yeah.

806
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:42,016
It's hard for me to judge the ending
without knowing the rest of it.

807
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:43,601
I like how mean you are.

808
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:45,978
Well, the characters are all...

809
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,981
Thanks.

810
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,949
That's our train.

811
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,667
Hurry!

812
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,589
Dad's bags aren't going to make it!

813
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,115
- Good morning. Whitman?
- Mm-hmm.

814
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,117
May I see your ticket, please?

815
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:30,208
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

816
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,793
Thank you.

817
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:34,045
Sweet lime?

818
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:36,964
Why not?

819
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:00,446
Why don't you hang on to mine?

820
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:06,118
It's safer if you keep them.

821
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:24,262
Let's go get a drink and smoke a cigarette.
