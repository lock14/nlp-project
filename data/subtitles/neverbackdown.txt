2
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,233
Inside of a minute left to play.
The Knights need a big stop here.

3
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,569
Motion! Motion!

4
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:15,200
There's the snap and off goes Devore.
Tries to go off-tackle. Big hit by Jake Tyler.

5
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,284
Forty-four is killing us.
Get in there and stop him.

6
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:18,368
You want some of this, bitch?

7
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,870
Good one, Jake!

8
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:20,954
It's all good.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,081
Call it out!

10
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:26,753
That is Tyler's 13th tackle tonight.
He is totally in the zone.

11
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:30,465
Coming through! Coming through! I got it!

12
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,966
Third down and 10.
Look for the quarterback on...

13
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,094
-Blue, 32.
-Hut!

14
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:36,346
There's the snap.

15
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:39,890
Pitch is wide to Moore.

16
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:43,311
And Jake Tyler makes
a big stop at the backfield.

17
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,771
Loss of three yards on the play.

18
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:48,566
Keep it up, baby!
It ain't gonna change the score.

19
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,609
Now Tyler and Moore are at
each other's faces.

20
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:53,278
They have been going at it all night long.

21
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,865
Lowe deep in the pocket.

22
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,242
Outside! Outside!

23
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:02,162
Now slings it out wide to Moore.
Ball's a little high.

24
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,294
Tyler hit Moore on the dead run,
and right down!

25
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,004
This could be it for the Hornets, folks.

26
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,675
You know, it's too bad about your old man.

27
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:20,389
The sauce. That shit will kill you.

28
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:25,061
What'd you say? What'd you say?

29
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:29,691
Tyler and Moore are going at it.

30
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,588
Hey, don't sweat it, Jake.
Good luck down there.

31
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:56,216
-Later, man.
-Dude.

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,219
Way to go out with a bang.

33
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,264
-Yeah.
-How's the hand?

34
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,390
I'll be all right.

35
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:06,227
Hey, come on, everyone's going over
to Harland's.

36
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,231
No, man. I can't.
I still got some packing to do.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,360
I can't believe you're moving
to Disney World.

38
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:15,986
Orlando.

39
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,115
Yeah, well, I'd come visit you,
but I'm not eight years old.

40
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,284
Could have fooled me.

41
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,956
Maybe I'll meet you out in Daytona
for spring break.

42
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,501
Yeah. Sure.

43
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:38,218
-Who's gonna keep you out of trouble?
-Who's gonna get you into it?

44
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,513
Later, bud.

45
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:07,247
-What up?
-Evening feed.

46
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:11,668
It's a contact sport, Mom.

47
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,504
Your coach called.
He told me that you'd been fighting again.

48
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:16,630
You wanna know what the other guy said?

49
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm not doing this when we go to Florida,
all right?

50
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:21,677
Then don't do it,
'cause I'm not gonna play, okay?

51
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,764
I'm late. I need you to help Charlie pack.

52
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,100
You guys start on the garage
first thing in the morning, all right?

53
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:28,268
Damn it, where are my keys?

54
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,935
Everything has to be ready for the movers
the day after...

55
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,980
-Mom, I can do my own packing.
-You see? He can do his own packing.

56
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,817
Damn, where are my keys?
-I think I saw them over here!

57
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:42,490
Thank you. Bye. Just do it, Jake.

58
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,170
Seventy-two. By flying in a V-formation

59
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:02,218
a flock of geese adds 72% more
flying range than if each bird flew alone.

60
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,512
Something about uplift.

61
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,557
1,392.

62
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,353
The number of useless facts in your head.

63
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,605
Miles from here to Orlando.

64
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:19,735
Do you hate me?

65
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,240
-Because of the move?
-No.

66
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,494
Famous Stampard Tennis Academy
in Orlando?

67
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,663
You better make it to Wimbledon.

68
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,165
Make it? I'll win it.

69
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,000
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

70
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,252
-No, I got it.
-No, here.

71
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,901
Guess Mom forgot to bring
that one to Goodwill.

72
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,444
I'll get rid of it.

73
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:51,869
You know, we could just close it,
get behind the wheel.

74
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:54,079
Nothing but open road
between here and Iowa.

75
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,665
-What about Mom?
-She wouldn't miss us.

76
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,836
-She'd miss me.
-Yeah, that's real funny.

77
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:48,300
I got him!
-Here, get him!

78
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,802
I got him!
-Here, get him!

79
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,435
You got him.

80
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:02,023
-Get him.
-Hey! Hey! Stop, man!

81
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:09,071
-Hey, I got this. I got this, man. I got this.
-Shit!

82
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:17,954
-Seriously, dude, I think he's got this.
-Damn right!

83
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:24,127
-Get lost, man!
-Yeah, vacate. You don't want none.

84
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,963
-You all right, bro? Are you ready?
-Yeah!

85
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,673
-Fight!
-Fight!

86
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,384
Get your hands up.

87
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,355
You still with us, Mr. Tyler?
Yeah? Good.

88
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:48,110
The argument can certainly be made
that The Iliad celebrates war, obviously,

89
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:53,533
but not all the symbols in this poem
support that interpretation.

90
00:08:54,241 --> 00:09:00,664
What symbol or symbols might suggest a
less vainglorious attitude toward warfare?

91
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:02,750
Anybody?

92
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:09,090
Anybody? Anybody? Ms. Miller?

93
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:15,178
Uh...

94
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:18,724
I'm sorry. You lost me at "vainglorious."

95
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:24,145
Come on. You have read the poem, I take it.
Seen the movie, perhaps?

96
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,067
That's the Shield of Achilles.

97
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:37,994
The scenes of normal life depicted

98
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:41,371
on Achilles' shield suggest
an alternative to war.

99
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:45,793
Friends or family or what is at stake.

100
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:50,505
Wow! Not bad for your first day, Mr. Tyler.

101
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,595
We might all strive to emulate
this kind of preparation and intelligence.

102
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:08,190
Hey, Shield of Achilles, nicely done.
Thanks for the save.

103
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:12,278
-I owe you one.
-No problem.

104
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,780
-I'm Baja.
-Like Mexico?

105
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,868
Like my parents smoked too much weed.

106
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,705
-I'm Jake.
-So, why the mid-year move?

107
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,833
My brother's a tennis star.
He got a scholarship.

108
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:32,798
Not bad. What about you?
You got any talents?

109
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,427
I mean, other than sucking up
in English class.

110
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:40,431
Probably not the smoothest move
on the first day, right?

111
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,475
Probably not.

112
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:47,395
Hey, can you help me find the 3-wing?

113
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,274
-It doesn't exist. Let me see?
-No, it's right there.

114
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,443
Oh, it's the B-wing.

115
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,868
Your handwriting's harder to read
than The Iliad.

116
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,120
Looks like you didn't have
any problem reading it.

117
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,663
A book that beat up has got to
be flipped through

118
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,081
at least a couple of times.

119
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,418
-Maybe I bought it used.
-Maybe, but I doubt it.

120
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,462
-There you are!
--Hey.

121
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,591
Nice shirt, Kurt Cobain.

122
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:19,761
You are aware it's hotter than Satan's
balls out right now, right? And they're hot.

123
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,346
Guys, give it a rest.

124
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:25,809
-Let's go, B, the lumberjack bores me.
-Not me.

125
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,198
J, guess what they clocked
my serve at today?

126
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,866
I don't know, 1,000?

127
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,912
-There's food right here, honey.
-I'm sick of eating takeout.

128
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,206
-Eighty-five miles per hour.
-That's great, Charlie!

129
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:50,584
-Isn't that great, Jake?
-Yeah.

130
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:54,629
How's the new school? You like it?

131
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,465
It's great.

132
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,677
Okay, brainiac. Give me the speed
ketchup leaves the bottle.

133
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,470
Not right now, Charlie.

134
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,889
How are the teachers?

135
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:07,684
-They're great.
-Classes? Other kids?

136
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:11,938
It's great. Everything's great.

137
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:17,110
Living out of boxes.
We're even eating out of boxes.

138
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:20,029
I'd just say everything's just great.

139
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,907
You wanna run numbers, Charlie?

140
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,119
Four. The number of times that
your brother has had to have stitches.

141
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:28,873
And two. The number of times that he has
been kicked out of school.

142
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,918
Six. The number of times I've had to
pick him up from the police station.

143
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:36,212
Tired of living out of boxes, Jake?
Why don't you try unpacking?

144
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:01,864
Dude! What's up?
You're carb loading. That's pretty smart.

145
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,616
Yo, I'm Max Cooperman.

146
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,370
Crack it.

147
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,500
-Jake Tyler.
-I know.

148
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,628
I also know that there's
a 225-pound football player in Iowa

149
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,629
that's happy as hell you moved.

150
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:20,381
-How'd you know about that?
-Internet, dude.

151
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:23,384
One guy shoots it, the whole world sees it.

152
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,639
Come on.
Tell me you haven't Googled yourself.

153
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,974
Look, when you hit my boy out
with that right hook, man,

154
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,893
we did some homework.

155
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,647
And your clip, it's starting to
make the rounds, bro.

156
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,609
Look, people... People are talking.

157
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:42,196
See, we got it going on here, man.
This is something you must check out.

158
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,990
All right, the other day,
when you saw me fighting,

159
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:47,743
that was completely organized.

160
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:52,206
-A totally sanctioned brawl.
-That looked like an ass-kicking to me, bro.

161
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,750
I'm getting my chi together.

162
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,628
I'm learning the moves
from one of the masters.

163
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,798
Jean Roqua. Dude trained with
the Gracies back in the day.

164
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,009
Dude was a finalist in the Vale Tudo, right?

165
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,097
Look, check this out.

166
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,811
Wait for the right moment.
Position before submission.

167
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:16,938
Huh?

168
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:25,947
Look, I appreciate it and all.
I'm not interested.

169
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:31,287
What? Hey, but, dude. I mean, you're...
You could enter the pantheon of greats.

170
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,455
We're talking significant social profile here.

171
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,707
I mean, you are a natural born brawler.

172
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,460
I'm just not into it, man.

173
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,499
-Want a ride?
-No, I'm cool.

174
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,879
You sure? We can crank up the AC.
You can wear that flannel.

175
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,635
So, what? Is your car in the shop?

176
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:33,474
Yeah, yeah. If by shop you mean
showroom, then, yes. It's a new 335.

177
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,142
Feel free to go pick it up
for me any time you want.

178
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,144
It's the silver one I cannot afford.

179
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:39,855
Oh, my God. You are poor!

180
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,777
So, there's this party
Tonight if you wanna go.

181
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:48,072
-You gonna be there?
-No, no, she's not.

182
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,115
She's inviting you to a party
she's not gonna go to.

183
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:51,951
Does that make sense?

184
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:56,913
Sorry. Here's the address if you wanna go.

185
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,962
See you there?

186
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,381
Yeah. Thanks.

187
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,524
The kid was nine. He beat me, 6-3.

188
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,317
So he's younger than you.
You're just getting settled in.

189
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,068
You just have to give it time.

190
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:57,349
My compaAąero!

191
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,600
-Man!
-What?

192
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,730
Whose house is this?

193
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,900
That is a good question.
Do you want a beer?

194
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,902
-No, I'm cool.
-No?

195
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:17,952
Drink, bitches!

196
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:21,957
That's disgusting!

197
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,561
Number one clip on YouTube.

198
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:46,940
-Max!
-I can feel my hit counter rising.

199
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:49,276
I'm gonna shove that camera up your ass.

200
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,153
-I'm not here.
-Show's over.

201
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,994
...on the dock.
I swear. It was hilarious.

202
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:03,207
-Yo, Ryan, what up, man?
-My man, Max.

203
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,750
You know I just came to party.

204
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,795
-How's it going? Good.
-Right on.

205
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,837
Hey, this is Jake.

206
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,799
-Ryan McCarthy.
-Jake Tyler.

207
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,010
-It's nice to meet you, man.
-Yeah. You, too.

208
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,597
You're from Ohio, right?

209
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,849
Due west. It's Iowa.

210
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:27,689
Iowa... Dan Gable,
greatest Olympic wrestler ever.

211
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,442
Yeah. The '72 games.
He never surrendered a point.

212
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,194
Exactly, man! Water.

213
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,197
Nice catch. Excuse me.

214
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,199
So, what do you make of Orlando?

215
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,952
Not really sure, man.

216
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,080
I hear you.
You know, I've lived here my whole life,

217
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:46,458
still don't know how I feel.

218
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:51,296
Bro, chicks wearing bikinis year round.
What's not to know?

219
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,799
Little man's got a point.
It can't get much better than this.

220
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:15,112
-Unbelievable!
-Yeah, but this ain't it.

221
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,115
-This ain't what?
-All this American Pie bullshit.

222
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:22,661
No. The real action is lakeside.

223
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,999
Force times mass equals acceleration.

224
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,291
Fight night!

225
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,636
Anyone who wants to fight gets a shot.
Girl on girl.

226
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,395
A little black on brown.

227
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,276
And my personal favorite,
battle of the exes.

228
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,362
Yo, crazy bitch.

229
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,573
So, what do you think?

230
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,327
This is insane.

231
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:10,375
-Got anything like this back at home?
-Not even close. Who's in charge?

232
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:13,628
We are.

233
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,067
So? You ready?

234
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,944
Ready for what?

235
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,615
The main event.

236
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:45,868
That would be me and you.

237
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:50,123
Get the hell out of here, man.
I'm not fighting.

238
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,045
I kind of think you are.

239
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:57,130
Hey, this is it, fight fans!

240
00:20:57,213 --> 00:21:01,593
Ryan "The Terror" McCarthy
versus Jake "The Gridiron" Tyler.

241
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:02,678
Yeah!

242
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:10,184
-Hold on, man.
-Hey, look, if you wanna be the best,

243
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,354
you gotta take out the best.

244
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:17,025
I don't wanna be the best.

245
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,488
We all saw that video, right?

246
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,365
Yeah.

247
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,659
That stuff was tight, man.

248
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:29,037
Sincerely, okay? One right hook

249
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,499
and the dude was stone.

250
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,210
Hey, Ry, I don't think Iowa's into it.

251
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:41,590
Well, we gotta give the
people what they want.

252
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,637
You guys ready to see something?
-Yeah!

253
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,347
-You?
-Yeah!

254
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,935
I don't want to fight you, man.
I don't want to fight anyone.

255
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:58,275
You don't wanna fight?
Then what the hell are you doing here?

256
00:21:58,357 --> 00:21:59,358
Huh?

257
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:01,068
Then what are you doing here?

258
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,570
He's getting cold feet.

259
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:08,993
Oh.

260
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,054
This is awkward.

261
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,727
You two have a good night.

262
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,314
Ryan, he's...

263
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,025
Where the hell are you going?

264
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,277
Hold up! Hold up, hold up.

265
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:49,284
I saw the clip, and you can bang, dude.

266
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,619
You know what they say about the Internet.

267
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:52,953
Yes, we do.

268
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:56,165
So none of that stuff is true, then?

269
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,545
Not even that part about your dad

270
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,799
wrapping his drunk ass around that tree?

271
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,428
You know, I can't figure out, though,

272
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,141
is what... What were you doing
in the passenger seat?

273
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:15,977
Why didn't you just drive?

274
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,606
Wow, talk about dropping the ball there.

275
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,574
Get off of me!

276
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:32,576
Guess some of that stuff
on the Web is true.

277
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:38,791
It's okay. You want some gloves, huh?

278
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,086
Yeah. Get the gloves.

279
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:42,461
Yeah!

280
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:45,173
Come on, baby!

281
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,012
Go to war! Play to win.

282
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:56,308
All right, calm down, calm down.
Bring it down, bring it down.

283
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,519
Fight ends with a knockout or a tap out.

284
00:23:58,644 --> 00:23:59,645
You ready?

285
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:01,647
You ready?

286
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:03,400
Get some, baby!

287
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,118
Nice right.

288
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,135
Cheap shot, man.

289
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,261
Aw!

290
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,849
Iowa, that was a cheap one.

291
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,435
But you are good, okay,

292
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,605
and you have a good center of gravity.

293
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,691
But that old-school boxing shit, it just...

294
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,694
I don't know, it doesn't fly around here.
You gotta mix it up...

295
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,074
Stings, right? Bet it does.

296
00:24:56,994 --> 00:25:00,664
Your leg's all jacked up.
Can't put any weight on it, maybe.

297
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:06,046
Now for the bad news.

298
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,090
It's gotta end with you looking like a bitch

299
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:13,094
in front of everybody.

300
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,777
My boy's rocking!

301
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,946
-Get up, get up!
-Get up, farmer!

302
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:39,788
Knockout! It's a knockout!
-Damn!

303
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:57,096
Damn, you're insane. He's getting up.
He's getting up. He's getting up!

304
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:19,368
You sent him to bed.

305
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,669
Dude, stay down. Fight another day, man.

306
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:35,759
Hey, Ryan!

307
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:43,434
You ain't got shit.

308
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,920
Don't worry, man. You're gonna be okay.

309
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:19,346
There's some roaches here.

310
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:35,487
You want breakfast?

311
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,614
Whoa.

312
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,577
-What about the other guy?
-What about him?

313
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:48,875
-He look worse than you?
-Yeah, maybe before the fight.

314
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,711
Hey, try not to say
anything to Mom about this.

315
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,255
Like I need to.

316
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:01,512
-Can you find your way to the bus?
-The big yellow thing?

317
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:04,098
Good man.

318
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,394
Good man.

319
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,357
Oh, my God, that new kid
got his ass handed to him.

320
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:17,862
The flannel kid, Ryan wrecked the dude.
He kicked his ass.

321
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:26,078
What's wrong with her?

322
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,355
-What do you want, Charlie?
-It's Max Cooperman

323
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,902
and Baja Miller.

324
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,864
Too easy.

325
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:51,788
-Way to commit to the move.
-What do you want, Max?

326
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,667
Well, you blew off school, man.

327
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,880
Trying to get an early jump
on the weekend.

328
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:05,010
Look, there wasn't a lot you could do, man.
I mean, Ryan... He's got crazy skills.

329
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:09,057
His dad's a psychopath.
He had him in karate before he could crawl.

330
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,019
But you, dude. You had heart.
It's inspiring even.

331
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:18,691
What's that?

332
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,403
This is just some of the best
mixed martial arts you'll ever see.

333
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,364
I told you I'm not into that UFC stuff.

334
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:27,115
Yeah, I got that impression last night.

335
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:31,913
Look, man, you gotta throw in some
Muay Thai, you know. Have a ground game.

336
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:36,084
Which is why I'm extending
this invitation to you again.

337
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,838
Dudes on that disk all train with the guy
I told you about.

338
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,049
My teacher, Jean Roqua.

339
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,180
All right, and with some technique,
bro, you can do what I can never do.

340
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,848
Achieve greatness.

341
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,435
Achieve an exit, please.

342
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:59,356
Dude, you're gonna tell me last night
didn't leave you twisted?

343
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,693
-Nope.
-Nobody can get their ass beat like that

344
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,363
-and not care.
-I can.

345
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,451
-Well, then hide in here.
-Maybe I will.

346
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,412
I bet under the bed's pretty safe, bro.

347
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:14,913
-You know, I bet it is.
-Whatever, dude.

348
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:45,236
Cool, man! How'd you find the club?

349
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,907
-The address on the DVD. It was real subtle.
-Yeah, hey, check it out. That's Roqua.

350
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:54,328
In trouble? Change your position.
Now, see, you got me.

351
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,788
It's hurting me, hurting me.

352
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:03,421
Right? And squeeze.

353
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,092
Whoa, dude, dude, dude, the shoes!
Take your shoes off.

354
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:16,768
Mr. Roqua, Mr. Roqua,
I'd like you to meet Jake Tyler.

355
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,394
He's interested in taking classes here.

356
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:25,652
People who come here
for the wrong reasons, they never last.

357
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,031
-Walked into a door.
-Must have been a big door.

358
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:37,288
-So when can I start?
-Tomorrow, with Max. Beginner's class.

359
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:41,209
-It's just labels, dude.
-What about this class?

360
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:46,172
This is not for beginners.
This is an advanced class.

361
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:50,384
-You can observe, if you like. Max?
-But he's got mad skills, sir.

362
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,760
Please.

363
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:56,848
I'm a quick learner.

364
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:03,772
Everyone up! Circuit one! Let's go.

365
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,486
-What do I do?
-Learn quickly.

366
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:13,240
One-minute intervals. Begin!

367
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,288
Breathe!

368
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,212
Section two. Time! Switch! Let's go.

369
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,759
Grab the rings, bro!

370
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,682
Push yourself. Pick it up, buddy. Let's go.

371
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,105
Time. Rotation. Let's go!

372
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,943
Come on! Pick it up, people.

373
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,076
Come on!

374
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:02,623
Pick it up! Time! Switch! Let's go.

375
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,295
Breathe!

376
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:13,259
Keep going! Don't give up. Never give up.

377
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,262
Never back down. Come on, pick it up.

378
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,639
Push yourself!

379
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,315
Okay.

380
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:29,358
Time!

381
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,864
Don't compact your muscles now,
we're just getting warmed up.

382
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,246
That was a warm up?

383
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,918
Pair up. Go for the submission.
Three-minute rounds.

384
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,251
Miles.

385
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,380
Are you kidding me?

386
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:55,425
-I got 20 pounds on this guy.
-So take it easy on him.

387
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,860
Tap out.

388
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:21,202
Shoot the legs. Take his back!

389
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:28,291
Good use of your chin to block his knees.

390
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,507
Rear naked choke!

391
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:40,054
-Tap out, dude!
-Tap out, tap out.

392
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,400
He's out. He's out, let him go.

393
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:56,737
You all right?

394
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,532
That wasn't so smart, buddy.

395
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,159
Couple of more seconds,
I would've had him.

396
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:04,244
You don't give up, do you?

397
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,498
Tomorrow at 6:00. Don't be late.

398
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,460
One rule, Jake.

399
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,797
No fighting outside the gym.

400
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:18,009
No matter what, no matter who,
no matter how big the door.

401
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,219
No fighting or you're out.
Can you handle that?

402
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:23,389
Yeah.

403
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:26,016
See you tomorrow.

404
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:28,978
That was amazing.

405
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:30,521
Oh, my God!

406
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,523
-It's no big deal.
-No big deal?

407
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:34,525
Are you kidding me?
The man put you on the rack!

408
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:38,028
He tested you and you passed
with flying colors, man!

409
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:42,532
Ass-kicking, skull-crushing,
mixed martial arts madness!

410
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,242
You're gonna bring it on!

411
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:52,001
-Dude, where you going?
-Bus.

412
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:54,461
Get in the car.

413
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,048
This is your car?

414
00:36:58,757 --> 00:36:59,884
No.

415
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,510
It's my baby.

416
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,896
I got it.

417
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,150
Wow.

418
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,070
Hey.

419
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,907
Hey, Jake.

420
00:37:24,324 --> 00:37:25,742
Come on in.

421
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,668
Hey, could you give us a second?

422
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:39,340
-I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
-Whatever she did, accept.

423
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:42,175
Go away.

424
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,344
Well?

425
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,184
-You set me up.
-I get that. I do, but...

426
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:55,313
You set me up so that your boyfriend could
kick my ass in front of half the school.

427
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,900
I didn't know it would be like that.

428
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,027
I said I was sorry.

429
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,282
It was wrong.

430
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,702
Are you so different?

431
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,664
You wanted that fight.

432
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:14,625
You just didn't want to lose it.

433
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,253
You know, you better watch out,

434
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:19,755
because you're starting
to sound real smart.

435
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,721
My old school.

436
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,476
I was barely there a month.
Third time we moved that year.

437
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:36,813
My dad got transferred here,
and then Ryan happened,

438
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:39,692
and everything just got so easy.

439
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:49,492
Does that mean I'm supposed to feel
sorry for you because you're popular?

440
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,755
Sounds like my cue.

441
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,025
Hey. First class isn't for an hour.

442
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,568
I could use the extra work, remember?

443
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,157
Okay.

444
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,878
This should be enough for two months.

445
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,923
That's a lot of money.
-Yeah.

446
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,759
Sure it's worth it?

447
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,802
Never been more sure.

448
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,148
So do you live here?

449
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,527
I thought you came to work out.

450
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,876
Add a round kick.

451
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:24,420
No, that's cool.
I'm gonna do my own thing till class starts.

452
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:29,135
Three-punch combo, then a round kick.
This is mixed martial arts. Mix it up.

453
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,561
You beat yourself
if you don't control your breathing.

454
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,942
Your first day sparring with Miles,
you panicked, stopped breathing.

455
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,902
Here you are trying so hard to kill the bag,
but you forget to breathe,

456
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,030
so your kick has no power.

457
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:53,199
Breathe with each strike.

458
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,331
Breathe.

459
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,795
-Breathe.
-I am breathing!

460
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,880
If you can't keep control
when you're kicking a bag,

461
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:09,007
what happens against an
opponent who can fight back?

462
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,427
This bag weighs a frigging ton.

463
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,324
Each strike, you breathe.

464
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:40,121
-So is that it?
-Is that what?

465
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:46,045
Your "Grasshopper" speech.
All I get is four words about breathing?

466
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:50,965
Still sure it's worth it?

467
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,313
Not just you, Jake. Everyone has their fight.

468
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:20,931
Nice work.

469
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:56,342
-Jake?
-Hey.

470
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:01,472
-Charlie had a match today.
-Yeah? How'd he do?

471
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,434
Level of competition here,
it's going to take some getting used to.

472
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,936
You should come sometime.

473
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,983
That was Dad's thing.

474
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,320
Did you take $200
out of your bank account, Jake?

475
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,740
Hey, I asked you a question.

476
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,077
Did you take $200
out of your bank account?

477
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,208
-Yeah.
-For what?

478
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,336
It's my money.
What difference does it make?

479
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,130
What did you spend it on?

480
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,550
What's in the bag?

481
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,766
Open the bag, please.

482
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,534
-You've been fighting?
-I knew you wouldn't understand.

483
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,119
You know, this is over.

484
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,702
Done.

485
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,914
Are we clear?

486
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,260
Today we're gonna try something new.
A collective narrative. Woo-hoo!

487
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,014
I'm gonna break you up
into groups of three.

488
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,641
Suzanne, Elise and Corey,
you're one group.

489
00:46:09,724 --> 00:46:11,601
Lydia will be a group for me.

490
00:46:11,684 --> 00:46:14,228
Ms. Miller, Mr. Tyler will be a group.

491
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,063
You three here.

492
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:21,235
So what do you guys want to write about?

493
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:23,197
How about pride?

494
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,034
Betrayal.

495
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,786
Exoneration.

496
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,331
Treachery.

497
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:34,291
Sequaciousness.

498
00:46:34,373 --> 00:46:36,293
That's bullshit. That's not even a word.

499
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:40,547
Yeah, it is. It's go with the flow,
and it's used quite well, I might add.

500
00:46:41,088 --> 00:46:43,382
Why do you have to be such a jerk?

501
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:48,054
-Yeah, this is my fault.
-It wasn't, but you're making it that way.

502
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:52,726
Unrequited?

503
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,945
What's up, Baja?

504
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,739
What's up, babe?

505
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,952
Hmm?

506
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:14,121
-We need to talk.
-So talk.

507
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,793
Are you sure you want to do this here?

508
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:22,088
Pretty sure.

509
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:26,760
Your fight with Jake Tyler was horrible.

510
00:47:26,842 --> 00:47:28,094
Really?

511
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,304
I thought it was a pretty good party.

512
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,431
You said you were just
gonna spar with him.

513
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:33,809
And then we sparred,
and then I kicked his ass.

514
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:35,101
What is the deal?

515
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,728
It's over.

516
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,313
You can't be serious.

517
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,108
I'm sorry.

518
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:45,278
Because I gave
some random kid a beating?

519
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,197
And loved it.

520
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:52,119
The only time you're happy
is when you're hurting people.

521
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,202
Wow.

522
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:59,585
Are you so self-righteous
that you actually believe that?

523
00:48:00,418 --> 00:48:01,420
Hmm?

524
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,588
You know, when you moved here,
you were nothing.

525
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,132
You'd walk the halls like a ghost.

526
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,052
Being with me made you.

527
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:12,639
Thank you for making this so much easier.

528
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,896
-Don't do this to me.
-Ryan. Ryan, you're hurting me!

529
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,440
So do I look happy?

530
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,985
Hey, hey!

531
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:29,322
-What are you going to do about it?
-Jake, no.

532
00:48:31,657 --> 00:48:34,202
You're weak like your old man

533
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:35,911
was.

534
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:38,664
Watch your back, man.

535
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,838
Half-speed, both of you. Switch partners.

536
00:48:51,052 --> 00:48:53,929
Forget half-speed.
You need to put it in neutral.

537
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,849
-What? I eased off.
-Okay, let's see it.

538
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,068
Clear your head. Let it go.
Easy, nice and easy.

539
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,614
-Just giving it as good as I get it.
-Really?

540
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,824
Should I go half-speed, too?

541
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,034
Whatever.

542
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,798
You're so set on hurting people,
you just hurt yourself.

543
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,634
-Easy, buddy.
-So this is my fault, huh?

544
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:34,096
Yes. It is your responsibility
to control the outcome.

545
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,722
-That is such bullshit.
-Bullshit?

546
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,266
Okay, show me your way.

547
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,487
Tap out. Calm down, buddy.

548
00:49:53,364 --> 00:49:55,199
Go home and cool off.

549
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,077
Tomorrow is another day.

550
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,710
-At least I have a home.
-What did you say to me?

551
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:10,090
-I said, "At least I have a home."
-Then go to it. I'll see you tomorrow.

552
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:18,139
-Maybe I should check on him?
-Yeah, you do that.

553
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,351
Hold up, dude! Slow down.
Where are you going?

554
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,978
Let's just go.

555
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:40,036
You okay, dude?

556
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:42,121
My responsibility.

557
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:45,041
Jake?

558
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,306
Dude, relax.

559
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,818
-You got a problem, tough guy?
-Yeah, I do got a problem.

560
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:15,197
Jake, be cool.

561
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,657
Hey, get back in the car, faggot.

562
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:20,911
What are you gonna do about it?

563
00:51:30,211 --> 00:51:31,213
Oh!

564
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,530
Let's go!

565
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,054
That's Jake Tyler.

566
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:30,230
Yo, Harry, check this out.
This is sick. Three dudes.

567
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,940
I heard one of them almost died. Look.

568
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:34,108
Get out of here, man. Whatever.

569
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,820
No, seriously, I heard Tyler hit the kid
so hard his heart stopped.

570
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:40,072
-That's in a Bruce Lee movie, you idiot.
-You're an idiot. Shut up.

571
00:52:40,155 --> 00:52:42,867
-You guys sound like a bunch of bitches.
-He's a bitch.

572
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:43,952
That was a good comeback, dude.

573
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:46,954
You know, it's funny. I just had a
conversation with your brother about that.

574
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,081
Ask him.

575
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,208
How well do you know Jake?

576
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,001
-We're tight.
-Really?

577
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:55,672
Yeah, but it's more of
a professional relationship, though.

578
00:52:56,088 --> 00:52:58,465
-I'm his trainer.
-Cool. Awesome.

579
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,217
Tell me more.

580
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,302
More?
-Yeah.

581
00:53:03,929 --> 00:53:05,097
Happy?

582
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:10,811
-What are you talking about?
-You're a rock star now.

583
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,358
Why would you care?

584
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,992
Good question.

585
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:30,123
Well, looks like hotshot found himself
a new groupie, huh?

586
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,480
How's it going, badass?

587
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:57,775
You think I'm impressed?

588
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,744
Couple of wannabes in a yellow Hummer?

589
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,831
I could wreck you here and now.

590
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:17,420
What fun would that be?
This is a spectator sport.

591
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,007
You think you can make it through
the Beatdown?

592
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:23,717
I have.

593
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,262
Won the whole tournament twice.

594
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,099
That's where we'll get it on.

595
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,059
That's where this ends.

596
00:54:39,608 --> 00:54:41,152
Not impressed.

597
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:43,697
Not even a little.

598
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,199
Enjoy the floor.

599
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,599
-Dude, where you going?
-Home.

600
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,394
Did you forget I drove?

601
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,896
I'm walking.

602
00:55:17,396 --> 00:55:18,731
Barely.

603
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,483
You okay?

604
00:55:23,068 --> 00:55:24,403
What's the Beatdown?

605
00:55:27,072 --> 00:55:28,324
Get in.

606
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,333
Straight up elimination tournament, dude.

607
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,960
The freaking Super Bowl
of the Florida fight clubs.

608
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:43,005
Everybody who brawls,
they go to the Beatdown.

609
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:44,965
It's gladiator heaven.

610
00:55:58,771 --> 00:55:59,898
When?

611
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,940
Uh...

612
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,193
Like, sometime next month, man.

613
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,195
The fighters get the time and place
by text message

614
00:56:05,277 --> 00:56:06,612
at the last minute.

615
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:15,246
Dude, do all you guys live
in houses this big?

616
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:17,414
Bro, this is our guest house.

617
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:29,677
Push over.

618
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,525
What are you doing?

619
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,152
-Training.
-Take off your gloves.

620
00:56:48,028 --> 00:56:51,074
-I just...
-Take off your gloves.

621
00:56:51,824 --> 00:56:54,744
Fight outside the gym and you're done.
Go right now.

622
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:57,831
You don't train here anymore.
Out of my sight.

623
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,217
Out!

624
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:21,271
Want to tell me
who did this to you, Charlie?

625
00:57:21,353 --> 00:57:23,856
-Not a big deal.
-It is a big deal.

626
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,650
It's not like you.

627
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,405
-What about the other guy?
-What about him?

628
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,202
You think this is funny, Jake?
This is all your fault.

629
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,246
-How is that?
-Well, all this business with fighting.

630
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,039
You're the one who's supposed to be
setting the example.

631
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,208
-I thought that was your job.
-Well, I am trying,

632
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:44,543
but all he wants is to be you.

633
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:47,005
You think you're the only one
who gets angry, Jake?

634
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,797
You think you're the only one
who wants to break stuff?

635
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,175
I'd like to break stuff, too!

636
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:57,931
-Want to try that, Charlie?
-You sure?

637
00:57:58,307 --> 00:58:00,143
Yeah, go on, break it.

638
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,731
-You feel better?
-Yeah.

639
00:58:06,773 --> 00:58:09,110
How about you, Mom? Feel better?

640
00:58:09,443 --> 00:58:10,612
Yeah, I do.

641
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,822
But guess what, there's still a mess
that needs to be cleaned up,

642
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:15,324
and that is my job.

643
00:58:15,407 --> 00:58:16,742
I can help.
-No, it's all right.

644
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,411
Get out of here, both of you.

645
00:58:22,289 --> 00:58:24,000
It wasn't a fight.

646
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,170
I got hit with a ball.

647
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:30,172
It was an overhead,
and I took my eye off of it.

648
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,090
I'm sorry I lied, Mom.

649
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,596
I thought it sounded cooler
if I got in a fight.

650
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:45,605
Still think you don't need to
set an example, Jake?

651
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,661
Isn't this a little stalker-ish?

652
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:47,791
Yes, but he's not going to let you
in the gym,

653
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,585
so we gotta go outside.

654
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,588
Outside?

655
00:59:55,257 --> 00:59:58,719
Dude, it's called 365 Combat for a reason.
He never leaves.

656
00:59:58,802 --> 01:00:00,679
Well, he's gotta leave sometime.

657
01:00:00,762 --> 01:00:03,224
Come on, dude. I mean,
we got to get you back in there, man.

658
01:00:03,307 --> 01:00:04,641
We need to be training.

659
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,228
-We?
-I don't go back until you go back.

660
01:00:13,025 --> 01:00:14,027
Cool.

661
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,195
Whoa, he's leaving.

662
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:17,780
Let's go, baby, let's go.

663
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:39,052
I lied, the first class.

664
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:43,347
I had every intention
of fighting outside the gym.

665
01:00:44,556 --> 01:00:45,891
Is this your apology?

666
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:53,148
Okay, I lied because I wanted
to pound on the guy

667
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:54,775
that was pounding on me.

668
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,655
This guy, he's got the perfect life,

669
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,282
the perfect car, the perfect girlfriend.

670
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,409
You know,

671
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,661
I lied because I'm pissed off,

672
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,331
because I'm angry all the time.

673
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:12,918
I just...

674
01:01:14,711 --> 01:01:17,215
I just had to say no, and I blew it.

675
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,675
That's all I needed to do, and I couldn't.

676
01:01:22,052 --> 01:01:23,054
My dad, he was...

677
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,264
He was completely wasted, he was tanked.

678
01:01:27,557 --> 01:01:29,309
He wanted to drive.

679
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:32,855
And I let him.

680
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,235
He went off the road,

681
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,903
hit a tree.

682
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:43,949
I made it.

683
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,534
He didn't.

684
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:51,706
I've just been letting my mom down,
my brother down,

685
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:54,210
getting into fights.

686
01:01:54,626 --> 01:01:56,420
I don't want to be angry anymore.

687
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,548
The only time I'm not is...

688
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,137
It's when I'm in the gym
and I'm training with you.

689
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,394
Be at the gym at 7:00.

690
01:02:14,646 --> 01:02:15,856
Thank you.

691
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:18,358
You won't be thanking me tomorrow.

692
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,355
That was not cool.

693
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,780
Tap out.

694
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,407
That's what I'm talking about.

695
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,251
Yes!

696
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,936
What's with the gym being open every day,
all year?

697
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,356
What's with the gym being open every day,
all year?

698
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,527
And why do you live there?

699
01:05:08,653 --> 01:05:10,447
Where's your family?

700
01:05:12,324 --> 01:05:14,702
Come on, I won the race.
You owe me something.

701
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:17,163
Okay.

702
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,626
My father moved from Senegal to Brazil
when I was very little.

703
01:05:24,836 --> 01:05:28,673
My father was proud to open
a little street corner restaurant,

704
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:32,427
but he was even more proud
of my little brother, Joseph.

705
01:05:32,594 --> 01:05:35,847
Right from the start, he was 10 times
the fighter I could ever dream of being.

706
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:40,936
I mean, we fought professionally,
but Joseph was truly great.

707
01:05:43,313 --> 01:05:45,858
We were at a local bar, Joseph and I,

708
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:48,443
and this guy

709
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,405
started mouthing off to Joseph,

710
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,032
saying ugly things to him.

711
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:57,286
Wanted to prove his manhood, I guess,
by taking on a pro, you know?

712
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:58,954
So I wanted to stop him.

713
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:02,208
I wanted to put this loudmouth in his place
and end this ugly talk.

714
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,210
But, of course, Joseph,

715
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,128
he beat him.

716
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:13,177
This local tough guy was
so badly humiliated

717
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:16,597
he left with his friends.

718
01:06:18,014 --> 01:06:20,434
He then returned 10 minutes later

719
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,230
and shot Joseph in the head.

720
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,485
My father's favorite son.

721
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:37,702
-I couldn't face him after that.
-So you haven't seen your father since.

722
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:43,998
Anyways,

723
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,251
you beat me once.

724
01:06:46,543 --> 01:06:48,586
Think you can do it again?

725
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:50,797
Well,

726
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:53,842
I don't want to hurt an old man.

727
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,637
Come on, old man!

728
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:09,023
You have no way to win here.
Stop fighting back.

729
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,818
Change it up. Go for position.

730
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,318
Trap my arm.

731
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,487
My leg here.

732
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,490
Now bridge and roll me over.

733
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,996
Now you have a chance to get in position.

734
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,253
A small chance.

735
01:07:39,137 --> 01:07:42,849
Okay, okay, okay, okay, you win, you win.
You win.

736
01:07:42,932 --> 01:07:44,143
I get it.

737
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:48,938
But you can't always change position.
I mean, sometimes you just get stuck.

738
01:07:49,063 --> 01:07:51,192
In any fight, you can always
change your position.

739
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,943
You just have to find a way.

740
01:07:55,653 --> 01:07:57,989
-So it's on me?
-Always has been.

741
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:00,326
Always.

742
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:12,295
Deuce.

743
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,594
How's he doing?

744
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,180
He's down 3-2 in the first set.

745
01:08:23,056 --> 01:08:24,516
Hey, Charlie!

746
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:26,685
I thought you wanted to go to Wimbledon!

747
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:27,770
You got this!

748
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:28,854
Quiet, please.

749
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,609
That was subtle.

750
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,444
Yeah.

751
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,447
It's not our strong suit.

752
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:40,740
Deuce.

753
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,994
-I want to make things better, Jake.
-Don't worry.

754
01:08:45,662 --> 01:08:47,539
-Everything's fine.
-No, it's not.

755
01:08:48,373 --> 01:08:51,417
-We're significantly screwed up.
-No, we're

756
01:08:52,418 --> 01:08:54,421
tremendously screwed up.

757
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,006
Yeah!

758
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:01,427
There you go.

759
01:09:01,636 --> 01:09:02,386
I'm just grabbing a seat over there.

760
01:09:02,387 --> 01:09:03,514
I'm just grabbing a seat over there.

761
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,395
Hey.

762
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:12,856
I was thinking about what you said.

763
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,067
And?

764
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,444
I think that was total bullshit, what you did.

765
01:09:18,695 --> 01:09:19,697
Wow.

766
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:22,740
This is going better than I ever expected.

767
01:09:25,368 --> 01:09:26,369
But

768
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,751
I was the one who took the bait, okay?

769
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:35,045
I chose to fight.

770
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:39,507
You tried to apologize,
and I acted like an asshole.

771
01:09:40,592 --> 01:09:42,344
You had nothing to do with that.

772
01:10:10,204 --> 01:10:11,372
Thank you.

773
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:16,420
Apologies are good.

774
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:22,301
Yeah, they are.

775
01:10:25,637 --> 01:10:27,972
Anything else you need to apologize for?

776
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,270
It's a long list.

777
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,997
Hello, can I help you?

778
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,500
My son Jake trains here.

779
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,918
-Jake Tyler.
-Yes, he does.

780
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,755
Your son is a very good fighter.

781
01:10:59,837 --> 01:11:02,006
Something every mother longs to hear.

782
01:11:02,757 --> 01:11:05,301
Jake is much more than just
a very good fighter.

783
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:08,930
Is that what you say about all
the angry young men that pay your bills?

784
01:11:10,682 --> 01:11:12,685
They're a lot less angry
when they walk out of here

785
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,228
than when they walk in.

786
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:16,854
Okay.

787
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:18,940
That's fair.

788
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,985
When I first met Jake, I thought,

789
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:26,657
"Here's another kid who has a hard time
dealing with his own emotions."

790
01:11:27,865 --> 01:11:29,993
But now I see he's just afraid of them.

791
01:11:32,537 --> 01:11:35,832
I know that Jake thinks
I somehow hold him responsible

792
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,792
for the death of his father.

793
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:39,377
Do you?

794
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,349
This is for next month.

795
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:58,730
-Thank you.
-Just do me one favor.

796
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,065
Make sure he keeps all his teeth.

797
01:12:01,149 --> 01:12:03,902
My dental plan doesn't kick in
for another six months.

798
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:09,283
Here, a mouth guard.

799
01:12:09,365 --> 01:12:10,743
My dental plan.

800
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,619
Thank you.

801
01:12:16,748 --> 01:12:18,250
Jake is a good kid.

802
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,127
I know he is.

803
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:37,519
It's on, dude. Beatdown is tomorrow night.

804
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:41,105
I don't think I'm gonna do that, man.

805
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,068
Yeah, man. Right.

806
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:47,613
No, really. I'm serious.

807
01:12:47,945 --> 01:12:50,114
I'm not gonna fight at the Beatdown.

808
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,158
What?

809
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,287
-Why not?
-Because that's what Ryan wants.

810
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:56,872
Not me.

811
01:12:57,789 --> 01:12:58,791
Dude.

812
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,960
I'm sorry, man. Come on.

813
01:13:02,502 --> 01:13:05,005
Let's just grab a seat with the girls.

814
01:13:05,463 --> 01:13:09,384
I mean, Baja's friend has been
checking you out all afternoon.

815
01:13:10,176 --> 01:13:11,177
Babes.

816
01:13:12,512 --> 01:13:14,347
The one thing better than brawling.

817
01:13:21,395 --> 01:13:24,483
So, you play Xbox a lot?

818
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,488
"Useless junk."

819
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,823
You sure you don't need a bigger box?

820
01:13:38,329 --> 01:13:40,248
Tools of his trade.

821
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,546
Those look kind of cute on you.

822
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:46,712
Ooh!

823
01:13:47,046 --> 01:13:48,506
They're still sweaty.

824
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,551
-Sorry.
-No, I like it.

825
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:58,432
Get up.

826
01:13:59,225 --> 01:14:00,769
I said, "Get up."

827
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,729
Okay, I'm up.

828
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,650
Nice contact.

829
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,569
Two older brothers, one bathroom.

830
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:12,738
Show me.

831
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,283
Show you what?

832
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:15,868
What you got.

833
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,453
Show me.

834
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,998
You got good stance.

835
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,208
You love my stance.

836
01:14:26,043 --> 01:14:27,045
I do.

837
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,091
Can you take it to the ground?

838
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:38,181
You see, it's about submission.

839
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,100
You wanna be able to make
your opponent tap out.

840
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,810
Tap out?

841
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:47,356
You wanna make it so painful
that they wanna give up.

842
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:54,573
I don't tap out.

843
01:15:01,412 --> 01:15:02,788
You wanna tap out?

844
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:11,756
Do you want to tap out?

845
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,229
Okay.

846
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:28,774
Hey, Charlie.

847
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:30,692
What are you guys doing?

848
01:15:32,109 --> 01:15:33,110
Wrestling.

849
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:34,404
Yeah.

850
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,198
What's up?

851
01:15:36,614 --> 01:15:38,033
Phone. Mom.

852
01:15:39,283 --> 01:15:41,161
-Okay.
-Mom.

853
01:15:42,828 --> 01:15:44,456
Big wrestling fan.

854
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,216
Okay, okay.
Who needs a margarita?

855
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,301
Hi.

856
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:58,720
Yo, Aaron.

857
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,180
Fresh batch, baby. You want one?

858
01:16:01,472 --> 01:16:03,182
No, thanks, Mr. McCarthy. I'm good.

859
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:05,226
Come on, man. Don't be a punk.
Have a drink with me.

860
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,229
And don't call me Mr. McCarthy.

861
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:08,646
-I'm not that old.
-Dad!

862
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,817
I think we're good.

863
01:16:13,568 --> 01:16:15,945
All right.
If were good, guess we're good, huh?

864
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:22,118
Are you getting smart with me here
in front of your friends?

865
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,787
I asked you a question.

866
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:27,707
Are you getting smart with me here
in front of your friends?

867
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:31,837
You wanna be the best,
you gotta take out the best.

868
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,761
All right, I can take a hint. It's all good.

869
01:16:40,845 --> 01:16:44,056
-I'll see all you guys later, all right?
-So long, Mr. McCarthy.

870
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:50,063
Shit. Can you believe Tyler bailed
on the Beatdown?

871
01:16:52,106 --> 01:16:54,067
What? Why?

872
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,112
He's scared of getting his ass kicked, man.

873
01:16:57,194 --> 01:16:59,280
That's not the word on the street, man.

874
01:16:59,864 --> 01:17:00,865
Oh, yeah?

875
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,452
What is it?

876
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:06,997
What is the word on the street?

877
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:09,332
My bet is that he can kick your ass.

878
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,377
What?

879
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,345
What's up?

880
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:22,762
Just hitting the mats.

881
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,515
You're training with Roqua.
You must be getting pretty good.

882
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,394
Mad Max, master of the ground and pound.

883
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,520
Yeah, dude.

884
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,314
Thanks.

885
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,569
So, I heard your boy doesn't want
to roll at the Beatdown.

886
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:40,738
That's correct. He's out.

887
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:44,408
Would have been sick, right?
You and him made it to the finals.

888
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,036
Guess we'll never know.

889
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:49,413
Take it easy.

890
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:58,381
Hey, you wanna come hang at the house?

891
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:01,592
Show some of the guys
the new moves you're working on?

892
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,387
Sure thing, man.

893
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,934
Hey, no, come on. Ride with me.

894
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,734
Max! Max!

895
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:31,288
Come on, dude. Jump kick some more.
Nice. Lower it.

896
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,457
Let's go.

897
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:36,377
-Check it out.
-Good.

898
01:18:38,087 --> 01:18:40,090
Hey, man, you gotta...

899
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:41,841
You wanna kind of, like,
control the breathing.

900
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,344
Seriously, most fights end
because one fighter gets gassed.

901
01:18:44,552 --> 01:18:46,054
And then when that happens,
dude, forget about it.

902
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:47,930
You know, we can do without
the insight, Sensei. Thanks.

903
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:49,181
Sit down, Max.

904
01:18:49,265 --> 01:18:51,600
Don't laugh at him, you assholes.

905
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:53,895
He's right.

906
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,440
Most guys lose because they get winded.

907
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,942
Right?

908
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:00,318
Right.
-Yeah.

909
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,863
Come on. Me and you.

910
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:06,158
Let's teach these boys a lesson, huh?

911
01:19:06,824 --> 01:19:07,826
Yeah.

912
01:19:07,908 --> 01:19:09,161
Come on.

913
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:15,250
Guard up. Guard up. Guard up.

914
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:21,590
You know, you can tell everything about
a fighter from how they take the first shot.

915
01:19:21,797 --> 01:19:22,841
Oh!

916
01:19:23,257 --> 01:19:24,259
Shit.

917
01:19:28,095 --> 01:19:32,016
When you get tagged,
your mind only registers two thoughts,

918
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,269
back the hell up or get the hell in.

919
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,649
Dude, I don't have any gear on.

920
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,443
That's what it comes down to.

921
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:45,029
You're either backing out
or you're getting in.

922
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,703
Ryan, don't! Stop!

923
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:54,914
Jesus, Ryan!

924
01:19:56,957 --> 01:19:59,836
You know, I don't think
I've seen this one on ESPN.

925
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,296
You just wait.

926
01:20:01,378 --> 01:20:02,631
Indian Poker's gonna be huge.

927
01:20:02,713 --> 01:20:04,466
See, Hold 'Em's all about luck.

928
01:20:04,548 --> 01:20:06,885
This, thinking man's game.

929
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,762
Raise you two blues.

930
01:20:11,096 --> 01:20:15,226
I got a strange feeling I should fold,
but I'm definitely gonna call you.

931
01:20:20,981 --> 01:20:23,234
How do you win every time?

932
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:25,403
It is a thinking man's game.

933
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,074
So, you wanna wrestle?

934
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:34,787
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

935
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:37,414
Hurry up. Go. Hurry up, man. Go.

936
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,006
Jake?

937
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,596
Max! Max!

938
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:57,101
Oh, no! Call 911!

939
01:20:58,395 --> 01:20:59,979
It's gonna be okay, man.

940
01:21:11,448 --> 01:21:16,704
Fractured ribs, six stitches
inside his lip, and a broken nose.

941
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:20,792
That must have been one hell of a fall.

942
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:23,168
You're gonna be fine,

943
01:21:23,252 --> 01:21:25,505
but we'll have to keep you here
overnight for observation.

944
01:21:25,588 --> 01:21:27,756
-Called your parents?
-Yeah.

945
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,634
Are they coming?

946
01:21:31,761 --> 01:21:33,805
-We have to call the police.
-No way.

947
01:21:34,221 --> 01:21:35,265
Why not?

948
01:21:38,726 --> 01:21:40,185
I need to borrow your car.

949
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:44,858
Jake!

950
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,900
Jake, wait!

951
01:21:46,984 --> 01:21:49,112
He's baiting you, just like at the party.

952
01:21:49,194 --> 01:21:51,573
-This is different.
-Really?

953
01:21:51,655 --> 01:21:52,698
'Cause from right here it looks like

954
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:53,908
you're giving him exactly what he wants.

955
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:57,328
Who's next? You? Charlie?

956
01:21:58,454 --> 01:22:01,875
Jake, walking away and giving up
are not the same thing.

957
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,836
Good, 'cause I'm not doing either one.

958
01:22:24,355 --> 01:22:25,564
Hey, Jake!

959
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:27,650
Jake!

960
01:22:28,984 --> 01:22:29,985
Where's Max?

961
01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:35,158
He's in the hospital.

962
01:22:36,533 --> 01:22:37,534
That boy

963
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,872
whose truck Max got into, he hurt Max.

964
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:47,002
-Revenge...
-No.

965
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,588
Revenge has nothing to do with this.

966
01:22:49,672 --> 01:22:52,091
Listen, whatever your reasons,
right or wrong,

967
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:54,094
the consequences will be the same.

968
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:57,721
That's fine by me.

969
01:22:58,597 --> 01:23:00,975
Do this and you can never come back
in my gym again.

970
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:03,560
I let you get away with it once, not twice.

971
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:06,564
Wait. Wait!

972
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,274
What? You think this is what I want?

973
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,484
To never train with you again just to

974
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:13,113
give some asshole
the show that he's looking for?

975
01:23:13,195 --> 01:23:14,988
Then stop. Let it go!

976
01:23:20,869 --> 01:23:23,163
The night my dad died,

977
01:23:23,247 --> 01:23:25,166
I just let him drive.

978
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,085
I didn't even try to stop him.

979
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:30,046
Doing nothing has consequences, too.

980
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,256
You cannot live in the past, my friend.

981
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,382
Really?

982
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:38,095
If you could go back
and stop the guy who shot your brother...

983
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,597
-Don't push me.
-I know you would have fought that guy.

984
01:23:41,306 --> 01:23:43,184
-I know that you would have...
-You know nothing.

985
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,895
Seven years.

986
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,356
Seven years, I have not seen my family,

987
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,817
my friends.

988
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:53,403
And every day, like the day before,

989
01:23:53,485 --> 01:23:57,114
I wake up, wash my face,
look myself in the mirror,

990
01:24:01,118 --> 01:24:02,119
disgusted.

991
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:05,789
Why not go back?

992
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,127
And face my father?

993
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:14,298
The last time he spoke to me

994
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,511
he said both of his sons died that night.

995
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,770
If thats what you believe,

996
01:24:29,271 --> 01:24:30,398
then he was right.

997
01:24:30,981 --> 01:24:32,024
You gave up.

998
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,904
Sometimes fighting the fight

999
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:39,740
means that you have to do the one thing

1000
01:24:39,823 --> 01:24:41,493
that you don't want to do.

1001
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:45,162
You have to fight for his forgiveness.

1002
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:48,332
You cant just hide here forever.

1003
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,460
At least I can't.

1004
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,837
I'm gonna stop this guy.

1005
01:24:55,297 --> 01:24:57,634
Win, lose, it makes no difference.

1006
01:24:59,676 --> 01:25:00,970
It ends tonight.

1007
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,599
This is my fight.

1008
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,351
Everyone's got one.

1009
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,234
Jake.

1010
01:25:16,735 --> 01:25:18,363
No matter what happens,

1011
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,824
control the outcome.

1012
01:25:22,699 --> 01:25:23,952
It's on you.

1013
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,494
Always has been.

1014
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:52,521
Come in.

1015
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:55,024
I was wondering...

1016
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:02,030
I don't want to lie about this.

1017
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:07,744
I'm not gonna ask you to.

1018
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:45,408
Hold up.

1019
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:47,243
No, no, no, he's cool.

1020
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:50,704
You have fun, Jake.

1021
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:23,988
Everybody do what they gotta do.

1022
01:27:25,364 --> 01:27:26,365
Yeah.

1023
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,158
That's right.

1024
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,994
It's 12:00 right about now.
You know what time it is?

1025
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:32,747
Beatdown!

1026
01:27:32,829 --> 01:27:38,252
Lock the doors, nobody gets out alive.
Its time for the Beatdown!

1027
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:40,796
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!

1028
01:27:40,796 --> 01:27:45,259
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!

1029
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:50,097
The first match is about to begin.

1030
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,600
Let's give it up for Camin and Mintz!

1031
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:02,193
This is a no holds barred match.

1032
01:28:02,275 --> 01:28:06,197
No eye gouging,
no crotch shots and no biting.

1033
01:28:06,863 --> 01:28:09,701
Bout ends with a tap out or a knockout.

1034
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:11,911
Fight!

1035
01:28:11,993 --> 01:28:13,203
Come on, Mintz!

1036
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:20,627
Check that right.

1037
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:25,132
Do it, man!

1038
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:27,719
Camin and Mintz! Oh!

1039
01:28:27,801 --> 01:28:29,429
It's gonna go down!

1040
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,975
Whoa! Its over.

1041
01:28:36,226 --> 01:28:37,854
Kick to the face.

1042
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:40,773
Mintz is going on to the next round!

1043
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:43,067
Yeah!

1044
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:45,528
Show your stuff. Show your stuff.

1045
01:28:47,738 --> 01:28:49,407
Jake Tyler, checking in.

1046
01:28:49,907 --> 01:28:51,324
We're still in the first round.

1047
01:28:51,408 --> 01:28:55,912
And we have 32 fighters
going for the title of Beatdown King.

1048
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:59,833
And right about now, we got the new guy,
Jake Tyler, trying to throw up

1049
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:05,088
against current Beatdown King,
Ryan McCarthy!

1050
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,350
Oh, my God!

1051
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:19,604
Wow!

1052
01:29:27,694 --> 01:29:29,404
Ryan is so hot!

1053
01:29:29,488 --> 01:29:31,783
Check mine out, too, yeah.

1054
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:34,577
Strictly for the ladies.

1055
01:29:38,622 --> 01:29:40,582
New guy, he's been doing some push-ups,

1056
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,502
but he's still a dead man walking.

1057
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:51,761
McCarthy and Tyler.

1058
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:58,559
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

1059
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:01,103
Slight mix-up, man.
Its not McCarthy versus Tyler.

1060
01:30:01,186 --> 01:30:02,896
Its McCarthy versus Taylor.

1061
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:05,774
Im sorry, y'all.
Its McCarthy versus Taylor,

1062
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:08,027
and not McCarthy versus Tyler.

1063
01:30:08,109 --> 01:30:10,738
We made a mistake. We misread. Im sorry.

1064
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:13,533
l can't read sometimes.
l can't read. Damn it!

1065
01:30:13,615 --> 01:30:14,992
Don't boo me. I'll beat your ass.

1066
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,743
You dodged a bullet there, huh?

1067
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,787
Stick around. This'll be quick.

1068
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:32,092
Oh, knee to the head!

1069
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:44,521
Beatdown King.

1070
01:30:57,201 --> 01:30:58,202
Leg lock!

1071
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:06,460
Jake Tyler!

1072
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:17,430
Yeah!

1073
01:31:52,422 --> 01:31:53,716
Reversal!

1074
01:32:07,896 --> 01:32:10,524
He tapped out! He tapped out!

1075
01:32:14,444 --> 01:32:17,657
Jake Tyler returns from the dead.

1076
01:32:37,092 --> 01:32:38,301
Yeah!

1077
01:32:52,649 --> 01:32:53,608
Only eight guys left, people!

1078
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:54,318
Only eight guys left, people!

1079
01:32:54,985 --> 01:32:58,530
And we got Jake Tyler versus Dak-Ho.

1080
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,952
Down! Let him bring it!

1081
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:07,163
Jake Tyler is hurt!

1082
01:33:07,247 --> 01:33:08,832
A kick to the ribs.

1083
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:15,381
Many exchanges with these two.

1084
01:33:15,672 --> 01:33:17,007
Watch out!

1085
01:33:17,882 --> 01:33:19,426
Superman!

1086
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:21,095
Punch to the face!

1087
01:33:21,177 --> 01:33:22,387
Dak-Ho!

1088
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:24,681
Come on!

1089
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:29,854
Bust that pretty face!

1090
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:37,944
Tyler slams Dak-Ho.

1091
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,711
Leg lock! He's got the ankle.

1092
01:33:54,252 --> 01:33:57,631
l think it's a wrap for Jake Tyler.
Its over. Its over.

1093
01:34:02,886 --> 01:34:04,555
Reversal!

1094
01:34:06,556 --> 01:34:10,185
Jake Tyler, back from the dead.
How does he do it?

1095
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:13,439
Triangle choke!

1096
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:19,403
He tapped out!

1097
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:22,489
Its over! It is over!

1098
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:27,328
Jake Tyler is going on to the semi-finals.

1099
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:30,288
l can't believe it! Dak-Ho is out of there!

1100
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:32,832
Fight fans have got to love it.

1101
01:34:35,252 --> 01:34:39,547
Give it up for the new guy, Jake Tyler!

1102
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,692
Hey!

1103
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,444
Are you sure you can fight?

1104
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:03,905
Yeah. Just give me a minute.

1105
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:16,377
I said just give me a minute.

1106
01:35:19,212 --> 01:35:21,715
So, I show up,
and that's the welcome I get?

1107
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,301
You look like shit.

1108
01:35:27,512 --> 01:35:29,305
That's an insult to shit.

1109
01:35:30,682 --> 01:35:32,600
What are you doing here?

1110
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:36,980
I guess I couldn't walk away either.

1111
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:39,942
Why not?

1112
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:44,070
I went back and sat with Max after you left,

1113
01:35:44,613 --> 01:35:46,948
wondering when...

1114
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:50,828
If someone from his family
was going to show up.

1115
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:56,457
Then I realized they already had.

1116
01:35:57,751 --> 01:35:58,918
I get it,

1117
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,380
why you're fighting.

1118
01:36:07,802 --> 01:36:10,014
It's like the Shield of Achilles.

1119
01:36:11,055 --> 01:36:13,850
You're fighting so that
you don't have to fight again.

1120
01:36:17,854 --> 01:36:19,355
Shield of Achilles.

1121
01:36:22,275 --> 01:36:23,277
Nicely done.

1122
01:36:28,407 --> 01:36:29,908
You can do this.

1123
01:36:35,372 --> 01:36:37,291
This is the semi-final round!

1124
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:40,586
Looks cute, but it's not enough.

1125
01:36:42,003 --> 01:36:44,006
Body slammed on the floor!

1126
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:49,552
Come on, champ. What are you doing?
Why can't you finish?

1127
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:53,390
He ain't even fighting back.
Why you taking so long, champ?

1128
01:36:53,556 --> 01:36:56,393
This ain't the Ryan McCarthy
we've been seeing all night!

1129
01:36:56,518 --> 01:36:58,103
Give us a show, baby!

1130
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:06,319
He taps out. Villa taps out!

1131
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:09,280
Ryan McCarthy is the winner!

1132
01:37:11,074 --> 01:37:12,451
Give it up again!

1133
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:13,618
Yeah!

1134
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:15,703
Let him hear it, y'all. Let him hear it!

1135
01:37:15,787 --> 01:37:16,956
We love you, Ryan!

1136
01:37:17,038 --> 01:37:18,248
McCarthy is going on

1137
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:19,667
to the Championship Round!
-Wait. Hold up.

1138
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:20,917
Let me see.

1139
01:37:22,836 --> 01:37:25,881
McCarthy! Illegal move. DQ. Eye gouge.

1140
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:27,341
-Eye gouge?
-You're out.

1141
01:37:27,423 --> 01:37:29,009
-Get over there.
-What? Keep it moving.

1142
01:37:29,092 --> 01:37:31,095
-Hold on, y'all!
-You're out!

1143
01:37:33,012 --> 01:37:34,931
Ryan McCarthy eye gouges Villa!

1144
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:37,016
He is disqualified.

1145
01:37:50,572 --> 01:37:54,201
This is Jake Tyler versus Tommy Kline.

1146
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:03,752
Oh, yeah!

1147
01:38:06,671 --> 01:38:07,672
Are you ready?

1148
01:38:08,506 --> 01:38:09,507
Ready?

1149
01:38:12,301 --> 01:38:13,429
Fight, already!

1150
01:38:14,304 --> 01:38:16,265
-What happened to McCarthy?
-DQ.

1151
01:38:17,306 --> 01:38:18,307
Fight!

1152
01:38:23,646 --> 01:38:25,149
Did he just tap out?

1153
01:38:25,524 --> 01:38:26,899
You're not serious!

1154
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:28,777
Come on, let's go.

1155
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:34,490
Jake Tyler taps out!
He didn't even throw a punch yet.

1156
01:38:36,326 --> 01:38:39,203
The winner by default is Tommy Kline.

1157
01:38:39,287 --> 01:38:41,539
So, what the hell is going on tonight, man?

1158
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:44,083
All right, y'all.

1159
01:38:44,167 --> 01:38:48,963
l guess the championship match
is between Villa and Kline.

1160
01:38:49,047 --> 01:38:50,923
Sounds like a bad law firm.

1161
01:38:51,007 --> 01:38:54,094
Im pissed off.
Im going in the back to cool off.

1162
01:38:54,177 --> 01:38:55,636
You sure you're okay?

1163
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:57,221
Yeah.

1164
01:38:59,891 --> 01:39:01,350
What the hell was that?

1165
01:39:06,856 --> 01:39:10,402
This is about me and you.
I don't care about some tournament.

1166
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:15,615
You giving up? Is that what you're doing?

1167
01:39:15,698 --> 01:39:19,161
No. I showed up. I'm here. I'm ready.

1168
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:25,167
There's nobody here to watch now.

1169
01:39:26,042 --> 01:39:27,961
That's all you care about, right?

1170
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:29,505
"Spectator sport"?

1171
01:39:32,673 --> 01:39:34,051
That's all you got.

1172
01:39:34,885 --> 01:39:36,095
Now you got nothing.

1173
01:39:37,386 --> 01:39:39,389
Walk away from it, man.

1174
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:48,398
Ryan, stop!

1175
01:40:02,829 --> 01:40:03,831
It's on.

1176
01:40:04,372 --> 01:40:07,292
The real championship is going on outside.

1177
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,587
Where the hell y'all going?

1178
01:40:11,963 --> 01:40:14,173
Y'all can't leave the Beatdown like that.

1179
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:16,092
Fight? Oh, shit!

1180
01:40:26,811 --> 01:40:28,063
Light them up, man!

1181
01:40:30,064 --> 01:40:31,024
Watch his feet!

1182
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:32,609
Kill him, Ryan!

1183
01:40:37,113 --> 01:40:39,198
Come on, Ryan. You past his door, baby.

1184
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:44,453
Don't let him tie you up!

1185
01:40:45,997 --> 01:40:48,625
Come on, grapple with him.
Get on the ground with him.

1186
01:40:50,793 --> 01:40:52,962
Yeah, baby. Come on, Ryan, get up!

1187
01:40:53,046 --> 01:40:54,463
Come on, Ryan! Get up!

1188
01:40:55,882 --> 01:40:59,344
Come on, Ryan. You did it before.
Overhand right. Overhand right.

1189
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:08,520
Jake, you're weak, man. You're weak, Jake.
You ain't got nothing!

1190
01:41:10,855 --> 01:41:12,481
It's your fight, Ryan!

1191
01:41:15,985 --> 01:41:17,487
You got nothing, Jake!

1192
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,951
This is the Beatdown right here!

1193
01:41:23,618 --> 01:41:24,912
You got moves!

1194
01:41:24,994 --> 01:41:26,622
Nice shield! Nice shield!

1195
01:41:29,123 --> 01:41:31,877
Go for the ribs, Ryan. He's hurt.
Go for the ribs.

1196
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:37,548
Come on, Ryan! Get him!

1197
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,849
Ankle lock him. Ankle lock him.

1198
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:49,310
Come on, Ryan! Get out of it!

1199
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,481
Come on, Ryan!

1200
01:42:02,198 --> 01:42:05,327
Crack those ribs, baby.
Break them. Tenderize them!

1201
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:06,787
Go, Ryan!

1202
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:08,537
Ryan, stop it!

1203
01:42:14,127 --> 01:42:15,253
Jake! Come on!

1204
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,599
Don't freak out, man!

1205
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:46,993
Jake!

1206
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:53,582
What the hell are you doing?

1207
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:54,710
Ryan, you're an asshole!

1208
01:42:54,792 --> 01:42:56,712
Come on, Jake! Tap out, man!

1209
01:42:56,795 --> 01:42:57,796
Jake!

1210
01:42:57,921 --> 01:42:59,672
What are you doing? Ryan!

1211
01:42:59,922 --> 01:43:01,632
Ryan, let go!

1212
01:43:01,716 --> 01:43:04,469
You're gonna kill him, Ryan!
What the hell are you doing?

1213
01:43:05,595 --> 01:43:06,595
Jake!

1214
01:44:15,164 --> 01:44:16,500
Yeah!

1215
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:21,921
Sorry.

1216
01:44:49,115 --> 01:44:52,202
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1217
01:45:02,712 --> 01:45:04,463
You should not be driving a stick.

1218
01:45:04,547 --> 01:45:06,757
That's big talk from a guy
who takes the bus.

1219
01:45:06,841 --> 01:45:07,884
Ooh!

1220
01:45:39,832 --> 01:45:42,002
Hey, Max. You okay?

1221
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:46,590
Improving significantly.

1222
01:45:46,881 --> 01:45:48,048
Yeah!

1223
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,130
