1
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:48,783
Repeat after me, okay?

2
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:09,007
Oh, Paul,
leave me alone.

3
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:29,226
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>

4
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:40,805
Butter.

5
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:50,716
Oh, my goodness.

6
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,151
You have to taste this.

7
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:57,719
Here.

8
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:08,470
I mean... It's...

9
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,802
- I know.
- But I'm...

10
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:13,275
I know. I know. I know.

11
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:21,448
Look at that! Oh, Paul, it's so beautiful!

12
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,825
Slow down.

13
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,390
Sorry.

14
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:44,407
This is it. Look, right... Just stop.

15
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:50,879
I can't believe we get to live here.

16
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,881
Paul!

17
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:21,572
Is this a mistake?
Should we have stayed in Brooklyn?

18
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,581
We're gonna love Queens.
Queens is beautiful.

19
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,992
Moving truck's here.

20
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,537
You okay?

21
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,540
- Everything is falling down.
- Hey.

22
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,914
What are we doing here?

23
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:32,707
Repeat after me.

24
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:37,983
- Nine hundred square feet.
- Nine hundred square feet.

25
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:40,990
Plus, it's close to your office.

26
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:44,153
Plus, it's close to my office,
but we don't have to move.

27
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:49,292
We could renege on the lease,
repack everything and live in the Jeep.

28
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:54,069
You're right. You're right.

29
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,770
- Eric, what is that noise?
- What noise?

30
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:03,842
Is it going to be like this every night?

31
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:07,913
Maybe.

32
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:15,119
Jule?

33
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:19,358
It's Versailles.

34
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,933
I'm so happy you like it, darling.

35
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:45,613
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,</i>

36
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:47,043
LMDC.

37
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:50,921
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,
Julie Powell.

38
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:56,352
<i>- My son died in the second tower.</i>
- I'm sorry.

39
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:01,864
I'm so sorry.

40
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,435
<i>Are you the person to speak to</i>
<i>if I don't like the plan for the memorial</i>

41
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:08,028
<i>- that was in this morning's</i> Times?
- You can speak to me.

42
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:10,438
<i>- Do you have any power?</i>
- No.

43
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,409
<i>I wanna speak to someone with power.</i>
<i>I don't like the plan.</i>

44
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,674
I don't like the plan either.

45
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:20,446
<i>You people are a bunch of</i>
<i>heartless bureaucratic goons.</i>

46
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:22,110
I am not a heartless bureaucratic goon.

47
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:25,383
I am just a person in a cubicle,
and I am doing the best I can, ma'am.

48
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:28,357
<i>This is my sixth phone call</i>
<i>and the only thing anyone ever tells me is</i>

49
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:31,395
<i>I have to fill out a form to get in line</i>
<i>for an insurance payment.</i>

50
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:35,421
And you do. But, I mean, if you don't wanna
fill out a form I will fill one out for you,

51
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,559
but you're still going to have to come in
and sign it.

52
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,468
<i>- To your cubicle?</i>
- Yes.

53
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:44,299
I feel terrible about what you're going
through, Mr. Diamond, but...

54
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,401
<i>You have no idea what I'm going</i>
<i>through, Ms. Powell. You have no idea.</i>

55
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:50,479
- Please don't yell at me.
<i>- This whole thing is completely inefficient.</i>

56
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,014
- Please stop yelling at me.
<i>- It's ridiculous.</i>

57
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,608
<i>- My 3-year-old is more capable of helping.</i>
- I am your friend.

58
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,481
<i>And now the doctor says there's fiberglass</i>
<i>in his lungs.</i>

59
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,584
<i>He coughs. He never stops coughing.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

60
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:07,061
His wife says there's so much crap
in his lungs he can't breathe,

61
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:10,396
and now his insurance is refusing to pay
for this drug that might really work.

62
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:13,869
- Tell her to call the Health Department.
- That's an answering machine.

63
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:17,339
Andrea Gomez in the mayor's office.

64
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:20,576
Thank you. Thank you.

65
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:35,455
Chocolate cream pie.

66
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:41,465
- You know what I love about cooking?
- What's that?

67
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:43,966
I love that after a day when nothing is sure,

68
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:50,304
and when I say "nothing" I mean nothing,
you can come home and absolutely know

69
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:54,242
that if you add egg yolks to chocolate
and sugar and milk,

70
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:57,770
it will get thick. It's such a comfort.

71
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:00,180
Bad day?

72
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,254
When will this pie be ready?

73
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,984
Soon, but I have to make
the whipped cream first and let it set.

74
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:09,549
I'll be here. It's a masterpiece.

75
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,730
Ritual Cobb salad lunch tomorrow.

76
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:17,761
Dreading, dreading, dreading.

77
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:21,295
Subway.

78
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:22,839
- Hi.
- Hi.

79
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:24,306
How are you?

80
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:27,939
What can I get for you ladies?

81
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:30,037
I will have a Cobb salad, no bleu cheese.

82
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:33,015
- Cobb salad, no beets.
- Cobb salad, no bacon.

83
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:35,279
- Cobb salad, no eggs.
- Okay, tell them...

84
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:40,290
Are you listening carefully, Tracy?
Tell them to take the offer up to 185.

85
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:41,857
- Here she goes.
- Repeat after me, Tracy.

86
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,894
- 1-8-5.
- What's going on?

87
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,988
And call me the second you hear back.

88
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,590
My assistant.
It's almost not worth having one.

89
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,499
I know. Yesterday I said to Allison,

90
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,765
"Go to the pharmacy,
get me a pair of black pantyhose."

91
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,739
She came back and said,
"They didn't have any."

92
00:09:56,808 --> 00:10:01,177
I said, "Did you try another pharmacy?"
I mean, really.

93
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:04,146
Or Bloomingdale's.
What's wrong with trying Bloomingdale's?

94
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:06,911
Yeah, I don't get it.
If only I could be my own assistant.

95
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:08,349
You can be.

96
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:12,214
Fire your assistant
and don't hire a replacement.

97
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:14,953
No, that's not what I mean, Julie.

98
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:17,119
Excuse me. Oh...

99
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:20,359
- Oh, those are cute.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

100
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:25,926
Okay, tell them 190, 1-9-0. Great.

101
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,663
"1-9-0." What? What are you up to?

102
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:32,675
$190 million.
We're assembling a parcel at Midtown.

103
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:35,371
Oh, wow. Oh, oh, that is so great, Cassie.

104
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:37,073
A parcel of what?

105
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:39,408
Buildings.

106
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:42,280
We're gonna tear them all down
and put up a high-rise.

107
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:43,877
- To your parcel.
- Thank you.

108
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:49,992
And enough about you, here's to me.

109
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:54,964
As of yesterday, I am the senior vice
president in charge of corporate publicity.

110
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,825
- No.
- Which means I get a raise

111
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:00,803
and I can borrow half a million dollars
at 2% if I want to.

112
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:02,839
- Great.
- If you want to?

113
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:06,572
- So how's your job, Julie?
- Oh, it's...

114
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:08,770
- I can only imagine. Heartbreaking.
- So sad.

115
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:10,677
- Painful.
- Not in a bad way.

116
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:13,875
- Excuse me. Oh, God, I forgot.
- Excuse me.

117
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:15,741
- Hello?
- Hello?

118
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,878
- Hi.
- Hi.

119
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:20,913
Hey, Jules? I have got to interview you
for this piece that I'm writing.

120
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,688
Sure, Annabelle, great. I'd be honored.

121
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,295
Call Julie about interview.

122
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:30,095
Find out about dry cleaning.
Find out before dinner on Thursday.

123
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,657
Saturday party.

124
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:34,461
No.

125
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:37,871
I cannot computer-coach you every day
while I'm with my girlfriends.

126
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:40,240
What is it about? The article?

127
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:44,379
It's about our generation turning 30.

128
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:50,550
People turning 30. Oh, my life, I am so busy.

129
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:53,713
I don't know when I can fit you in.

130
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:58,591
May I remind you, I don't want to
see you, you want to see me?

131
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,891
Yeah. Would a breakfast work?

132
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:06,669
I believed her. What kind of idiot am I?

133
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:10,229
She said,
"It's about our generation turning 30."

134
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:12,776
What'd you expect?
Annabelle was always a liar.

135
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,241
"Julie Powell, once the editor of
the Amherst literary magazine,

136
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:18,976
"the one we all knew would be 'The One,'

137
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:22,483
"temped for eight years before giving up
on her novel,

138
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:25,716
"and now works in a cubicle
as a mid-level bureaucrat,

139
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,123
"attempting to deal with
the aftereffects of 9l11."

140
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:33,095
Oh, God, you memorized it? How pathetic.

141
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,061
She left so much out.

142
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,462
Anyway, the picture was good.

143
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:40,936
- I looked fat.
- Just your face.

144
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,502
I forgot to tell you.
Do you know what Annabelle's doing now?

145
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,413
- Sarah told me. A blog.
- Of what?

146
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,575
What do you mean "of what"?
A blog of Annabelle.

147
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:58,349
Of every thought
that passes through her brain.

148
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:01,619
Her stupid, vapid, insipid...

149
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:05,691
I could write a blog.

150
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:07,359
I have thoughts.

151
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:10,434
And you're a writer,
which is more than I can say for Annabelle.

152
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,867
- If only that were true.
- You wrote a novel.

153
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:16,464
Half a novel.
And no one wanted to publish it.

154
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:19,875
You're not a writer unless someone
publishes you.

155
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:23,708
See, that's what's so great about blogs.
You don't have to be published.

156
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:29,242
You can just go online,
press enter and there it is, out there.

157
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,354
What would I write a blog about?

158
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:33,185
You're an editor, tell me.

159
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:36,852
Why don't you write about
how much you love Queens?

160
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,363
A short blog.

161
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:46,202
You could write about your job.

162
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:50,535
If I wrote a blog about my job
and anyone at work ever read it...

163
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:53,202
- I mean, hello.
- This is good.

164
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:55,436
This is really good.

165
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:59,415
On top of which, the whole idea of writing
a blog is to get away from what I do all day.

166
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:03,112
The way that cooking is a way
that I get away from what I do all day.

167
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,417
So write a blog about cooking.

168
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:11,319
I'm not a real cook,
like Julia Child or Mario Batali.

169
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:14,190
Julia Child wasn't always Julia Child.

170
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,264
If I really wanted to learn to cook,

171
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:26,031
I could just cook my way through
Julia Child's cookbook.

172
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,078
I could blog about that.

173
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,440
I have a copy. I stole it from my mother
last time I was in Texas.

174
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:39,152
When I was eight, my father's boss came
to dinner and it was a really big deal,

175
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:41,885
and my mother made <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

176
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:46,757
But it wasn't just <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>
It was Julia's <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

177
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:51,591
And it was like she was there,
like Julia was there in the room,

178
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:57,605
on our side like some great big good fairy.

179
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:01,374
And everything was going to be all right.

180
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:08,942
<i>I'm gonna try to flip this thing over now,</i>

181
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:12,213
<i>which is a rather daring thing to do.</i>

182
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:14,085
She changed everything.

183
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:18,356
Before her, it was frozen food
and can openers and marshmallows.

184
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:20,420
Don't knock marshmallows.

185
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:23,323
<i>When you flip anything,</i>

186
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:27,598
<i>you've just got to have the courage</i>
<i>of your convictions.</i>

187
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:31,668
<i>Especially if it's a loose sort of mass like...</i>

188
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,744
<i>That didn't go very well.</i>

189
00:15:35,112 --> 00:15:36,443
<i>But, you see, when I flipped it,</i>

190
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:40,143
<i>- I didn't have the courage I needed...</i>
- She's so adorable.

191
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:42,879
<i>... the way I should've.</i>

192
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:46,385
<i>But you can always put it together.</i>

193
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:51,354
<i>And you're alone in the kitchen.</i>
<i>Who's to see?</i>

194
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,723
Pearls. The woman is wearing pearls
in the kitchen.

195
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:57,961
<i>... you've just got to practice, like the piano.</i>

196
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:01,062
<i>I'm Julia Child.</i>

197
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,771
Bon appétit.

198
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:05,667
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>

199
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:08,438
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

200
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,082
<i>Julia Child is coauthor of the book</i>
Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

201
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:23,186
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

202
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:29,792
"For the servantless American cook."
That's me, all right.

203
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:36,270
Okay, here's a problem.
I've never eaten an egg.

204
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,275
And I have a hyperacidic stomach.
We'll deal.

205
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:44,976
So I'll cook my way through
the Julia Child cookbook

206
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:46,744
and write a blog about it.

207
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:49,479
- But I'll probably need a deadline.
- Why?

208
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,420
Because otherwise it'll be like
everything else I do.

209
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,081
'Cause let's face it, I never finish anything.

210
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:56,183
- Hey.
- Well, it's true.

211
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:59,226
You know why I think it is?

212
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,321
- ADD.
- You have ADD?

213
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:04,434
Yes. That's why I'm so bad at housework.

214
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:06,794
Oh, is that it?

215
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:09,065
I'm just saying, a deadline would be good.

216
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:10,629
So a deadline. "I love deadlines.

217
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,166
"I love the sound they make
as they go whooshing past."

218
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,406
<i>- Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</i>
- I mean it.

219
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,109
- Okay, so a year, or so.
- A year?

220
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:23,852
This thing weighs like two pounds.

221
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:29,223
I have a full-time job. Sometimes
I don't get home until 8:00 or 9:00 and...

222
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,151
It's crazy. It's crazy.

223
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:35,194
- Is it crazy?
- Yes. Yes.

224
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,135
- Okay, you want to do Blog Z?
- Yes.

225
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:40,803
Blog Z it is.

226
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:44,263
Nobody here

227
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:48,811
but us servantless American cooks.

228
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:53,847
"Servantless American cooks."

229
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,075
- What do you think?
- Love it.

230
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,547
"Start blogging."

231
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,720
<i>"The Julie/Julia Project."</i>

232
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,996
<i>The Book,</i>
Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

233
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:10,625
<i>First edition, 1961 by Simone Beck,</i>
<i>Louisette Bertholle,</i>

234
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:16,037
<i>and, of course, Julia Child, the woman</i>
<i>who taught America to cook and to eat.</i>

235
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:20,168
<i>It's 40 years later and no one can touch her.</i>

236
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:26,245
<i>The Challenge, 365 days, 524 recipes.</i>

237
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,780
<i>The Contender, Julie Powell.</i>

238
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:31,715
<i>Government employee by day,</i>
<i>renegade foodie by night.</i>

239
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,225
<i>Risking her marriage, her job,</i>
<i>and her cat's well-being,</i>

240
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:38,318
<i>she has signed on for</i>
<i>a deranged assignment.</i>

241
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,955
<i>How far it will go, no one can say.</i>

242
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:10,750
<i>Dear Charlie, we're settled in finally,</i>
<i>and Julia loves it here.</i>

243
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,220
<i>She wants to stay forever.</i>

244
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:17,699
<i>You know how famously grouchy</i>
<i>the French can be, dear brother.</i>

245
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:20,032
Everyone here is so delightful.

246
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:23,965
<i>But Julia brings out the best in a polecat.</i>

247
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,338
So charming.

248
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:29,209
<i>So she thinks they're the most</i>
<i>wonderful people in the world.</i>

249
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:32,943
I feel that I am French.

250
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:37,986
I just must be.

251
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:41,755
Well, you might be.

252
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:49,288
<i>As for staying here forever,</i>
<i>I have to say, I wouldn't mind it myself.</i>

253
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:51,900
And I'm so glad that you came,

254
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,197
- I can't tell you.
- It was a very nice show.

255
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,067
- Thanks for coming.
- I enjoyed it.

256
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:59,641
- Paul, congratulations. Excellent exhibit.
- Thanks so much, Jack.

257
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,304
Jack Donovan, this is my wife, Julia.

258
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:08,080
- It was such a wonderful exhibition, Paul.
- Thank you. Thank you.

259
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:12,652
- I am so proud of you.
- Oh, good.

260
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,891
French people eat French food!

261
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:21,061
- Every single day! I can't get over it.
- They do.

262
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:27,964
You know I love you so much,
I'm gonna let you take the first bite.

263
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:31,732
- That's so good.
- Before I even had... It's good, is it?

264
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:38,945
What should I do, do you think?

265
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,715
About what?

266
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,519
I don't really want to go back into
government work.

267
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:50,223
You know, but I...
Shouldn't I find something to do?

268
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:55,387
These wives don't do anything here.

269
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:59,031
- That's not me. It's just not me.
- I know.

270
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:03,339
I saw a notice on the bulletin board
at the embassy

271
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:06,099
for hat-making lessons.

272
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:11,103
You like hats.

273
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:13,681
I do, I do.

274
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,211
I do.

275
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:22,485
What is it that you really like to do?

276
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:24,952
Eat.

277
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:31,833
- It's what I like to do.
- I know, I know. I know. I know.

278
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:34,760
- And you are so good at it. Look at you!
- I am good at it.

279
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:36,897
- Now. How good you are.
- I'm growing in front of you.

280
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:53,451
I was thinking of taking bridge lessons.

281
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:59,888
- You like bridge.
- I do. I like the idea of bridge.

282
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:03,398
Four points for an ace,
three points for a king,

283
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:06,834
two points for a queen, one point for a jack.

284
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,095
And breast your cards.

285
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:14,036
Do you have any French cookbooks
in English?

286
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:18,308
- I'm afraid not.
- Gosh.

287
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:36,690
The salesperson. She...

288
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,664
Had no idea... Because, you see,
there is no French cookbook in English.

289
00:22:45,008 --> 00:22:48,466
And all I have is this <i>Joy of Cooking</i>
by Irma Rombauer,

290
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:51,844
which is an excellent, excellent cookbook,
but it's not French.

291
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:54,509
So I did ask my friend Avis De Voto

292
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:57,553
to look around in the United States
to see if she could find...

293
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:06,053
Right. Right.

294
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:10,289
Gosh, I thought I was
speaking French to you!

295
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,339
Oh, my goodness!

296
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:25,073
What do we have here?

297
00:23:25,515 --> 00:23:28,006
- It's a copy of...
- It's my memoirs.

298
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,482
Oh, look.

299
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:36,824
Oh, it's fantastic! But it's in French!

300
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,657
- You'll get there. You'll get there.
- Thank you, darling.

301
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,790
I know. I'm learning. I'm trying. I'm really...

302
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,297
Happy birthday to me.

303
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,733
Happy birthday.

304
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:53,768
- What can this mean?
- What?

305
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:02,775
- "Wash the thighs."
- No, "bathe." Bathe the thighs.

306
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:06,251
- Look, but then...
- Where?

307
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,184
"In butter." I know that. But what is the...

308
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:13,161
"Bathe the thighs in butter
and then stuff the..."

309
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,254
What's that word?

310
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:16,231
- The hen!
- Right. Hen.

311
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:21,669
"Until she just can't take it anymore."

312
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:26,473
- It doesn't say that.
- It does.

313
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:31,412
I'll show you later in the dictionary.
I'll go through the whole recipe with you.

314
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:36,115
- Why don't I go to cooking school?
- Why don't you?

315
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:38,677
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

316
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:41,588
Oh, my God.

317
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:50,229
What if you hadn't fallen in love with me?

318
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:52,667
But I did.

319
00:24:58,141 --> 00:24:59,904
Oh, gosh.

320
00:25:08,785 --> 00:25:12,084
<i>Yesterday was Tuesday, August 13th, 2002.</i>

321
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:15,790
<i>Day one. 364 days to go.</i>

322
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:19,326
<i>I cooked artichokes with hollandaise sauce</i>

323
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:23,093
<i>which is melted butter that's been whipped</i>
<i>into a frenzy with egg yolks</i>

324
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,930
<i>until it's died and gone to heaven.</i>

325
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:30,069
<i>And let me say this.</i>
<i>Is there anything better than butter?</i>

326
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,869
<i>Think it over.</i>
<i>Every time you taste something</i>

327
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:36,276
<i>that's delicious beyond imagining,</i>
<i>and you say, "What is in this?"</i>

328
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:39,540
<i>The answer is always going to be "butter."</i>

329
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,978
It's incredible.

330
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,848
It's been whisked into submission,
that's why.

331
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,821
<i>The day there's a meteorite heading toward</i>
<i>the earth and we have 30 days to live,</i>

332
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,484
<i>I am going to spend it eating butter.</i>

333
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:52,618
<i>Here's my final word on the subject.</i>

334
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:56,859
<i>You can never have too much butter.</i>

335
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:00,396
<i>August 24th, day 11.</i>

336
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,337
Is this what you mean when you say, "Don't
crowd the mushrooms"? Is this a crowd?

337
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:07,502
<i>353 days to go. A horrible day at work.</i>

338
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:09,736
<i>An old grandma who looked as if</i>
<i>she wouldn't harm a fly</i>

339
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:12,281
<i>called me a pencil-pushing capitalist dupe.</i>

340
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:15,978
<i>But then I came home and cooked chicken</i>
<i>with cream, mushrooms and port,</i>

341
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:17,952
<i>and it was total bliss.</i>

342
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:19,587
<i>Here's the big news.</i>

343
00:26:19,656 --> 00:26:22,887
<i>I had been cooking mushrooms</i>
<i>the wrong way my entire life.</i>

344
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:26,827
<i>Don't crowd the mushrooms,</i>
<i>otherwise they won't brown.</i>

345
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:29,422
<i>Are you listening, whoever you are?</i>

346
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,526
You're gonna love that one.

347
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:32,795
<i>Day 22.</i>

348
00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:34,527
This one's really good with fig jam.

349
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:38,665
<i>I got carried away in Dean & DeLuca last</i>
<i>night and spent half my take-home pay.</i>

350
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:41,006
<i>And the first thing I realized</i>
<i>when I got to the subway</i>

351
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,409
<i>with my groceries, a bag of cat litter,</i>

352
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,042
<i>a bottle of olive oil I absolutely could not</i>
<i>live without, and a huge bunch of branches</i>

353
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:51,747
<i>was that the branches were</i>
<i>probably not a good idea.</i>

354
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:53,213
Sorry.

355
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,282
<i>They were slapping folks in the face</i>
<i>right and left and I was sweating like a pig.</i>

356
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:01,695
<i>Not surprising, since I've been way too busy</i>
<i>cooking fattening food to bother exercising.</i>

357
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:06,330
<i>And then I came home and got</i>
<i>a big vote of confidence from my mother.</i>

358
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:09,503
<i>Remind me again why you're doing this...</i>

359
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:12,298
- Blog.
<i>- Whatever it's called.</i>

360
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,441
It's a regimen, Mom. Like doing sit-ups.

361
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:19,879
<i>- Well, it's just adding pressure.</i>
- What pressure?

362
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,942
<i>You have a full-time job,</i>
<i>you have a husband,</i>

363
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:25,920
<i>and now you're gonna get sick</i>
<i>from blogging.</i>

364
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:29,356
- It's sort of like being in AA.
<i>- What are you saying?</i>

365
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:33,353
It gives you something you have to do
every day, one day at a time.

366
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,364
<i>How do you know this lingo?</i>

367
00:27:35,432 --> 00:27:37,491
<i>Honey, are you an alcoholic?</i>

368
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,559
I'm saying it's good for me to have
short-term goals.

369
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:43,731
<i>Well, that is silly. That is just plain silly.</i>

370
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,107
<i>Who's reading this blog?</i>

371
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:48,235
People. People are reading it, I'm sure.

372
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:50,108
<i>Well, it's something you decided to do,</i>

373
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,411
<i>and you can decide not to,</i>
<i>and not one single person's gonna mind.</i>

374
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:56,043
No. Don't you get it? I just started.

375
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,316
I can't stop, I have to finish. It's all I've got.

376
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:02,587
Hello? Hello?

377
00:28:04,227 --> 00:28:05,421
Stupid dead phone.

378
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:07,520
Hey, it's not all you got.

379
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:10,856
I know. I know. I didn't mean that.

380
00:28:13,303 --> 00:28:15,635
<i>Yesterday, I poached an egg.</i>

381
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:17,498
<i>It seemed like the perfect thing to do</i>

382
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:21,135
<i>on perhaps the second worst workday</i>
<i>in recorded history.</i>

383
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,543
Explain to me how you've never eaten
an egg in your whole life.

384
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:25,843
I've had eggs in, like, cakes.

385
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:29,609
Never had an "egg" egg.
I was a very willful child.

386
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:30,914
It's simmering.

387
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:35,219
<i>I had this notion, God knows why,</i>
<i>that poaching eggs would be simple.</i>

388
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:37,590
<i>But I was deeply wrong.</i>

389
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:40,528
"Immediately and gently push the white over
the yolk with a wooden spoon

390
00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:43,327
"for two to three seconds." Immediately.

391
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:50,603
Disgusting.

392
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:53,438
Oh, maybe the eggs aren't fresh.
Julia says the eggs have to be fresh.

393
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,034
They are fresh.

394
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:59,605
Okay. You don't have to bite my head off.
I'm just quoting Julia.

395
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,417
<i>It took three of us, crammed into the</i>
<i>kitchen over a pot of simmering water,</i>

396
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,818
<i>but, eventually, we nailed it.</i>

397
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:07,618
- Hello.
- Welcome.

398
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:09,018
How cute is that?

399
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,159
<i>And I ate my very first egg</i>
<i>of my whole life, ever, ever, ever.</i>

400
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:21,100
I thought eggs were going to be greasy
and slimy, but it tastes like

401
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:24,739
cheese sauce. Yum.

402
00:29:25,842 --> 00:29:27,605
Julia Child, you are so good.

403
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,076
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

404
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:31,670
And, may I say, excellent wine?

405
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:35,044
- Do you think Julia knows about you?
- I wish.

406
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:39,220
I have this fantasy that she comes for dinner
and I show her my new lemon zester.

407
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:41,086
We become very close.

408
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:45,317
The truth is, no one knows about me.

409
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:49,490
I feel like I'm just sending things
into this giant void.

410
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,527
Which reminds me. Annabelle's blog.
Have you read it lately?

411
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:54,661
Yes.

412
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:57,968
- It's sort of funny.
- Is it?

413
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:02,339
She's dating this rich guy who owns a plane.
His name's Lester.

414
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:07,941
And they do it in the air.
People love it. It's a huge hit.

415
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,087
What do you think it means
if you don't like your friends?

416
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:14,646
- It's completely normal.
- Men like their friends.

417
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:18,091
We're not talking about men.
Who's talking about men?

418
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:23,828
<i>So it's five weeks down, 47 to go,</i>
<i>and I feel fantastic.</i>

419
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:29,001
<i>Sometimes, I can't help but wonder.</i>
<i>Is there anyone out there reading me?</i>

420
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:32,235
<i>But I'm sure you are,</i>
<i>aren't you? Somebody?</i>

421
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:34,570
<i>Anybody?</i>

422
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,306
Ernestine, I have a comment.

423
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,416
My mother. Doesn't count.

424
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:56,492
Today we will begin by learning to boil eggs.

425
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,597
First, you must make sure
that the egg is fresh.

426
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:05,801
I was so hoping that...

427
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:10,837
Well, for something a little more advanced,
Madame Brassart.

428
00:31:11,214 --> 00:31:14,547
But you are not an advanced cook.

429
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:17,777
But I do know how to boil an egg.

430
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:21,213
Do you know how to bone a duck?

431
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:25,020
No, but that's exactly the sort of thing

432
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:28,758
that I'm very interested
in learning how to do.

433
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:35,633
There is one other class,
but you will not like it.

434
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:40,471
It's for <i>professionnel,</i>
which you will never be, I'm sure.

435
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,936
All men. All GIs.

436
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:46,475
And very expensive.

437
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:50,349
I cannot imagine
that you would ever want to pay the tuition.

438
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,182
How much?

439
00:31:53,823 --> 00:31:56,053
So the onion is ready, but...

440
00:32:19,682 --> 00:32:21,877
You must hold the knife,
first of all, like this.

441
00:32:21,951 --> 00:32:24,351
Wrist, easy. Leave the thumb here.

442
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:27,817
The hand and the knife are one.

443
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:31,088
And the hand, the other hand,
you must protect it.

444
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:34,024
Here, you must cut only the onion. Yes?

445
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:36,258
- Not me.
- Yes.

446
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:40,029
And then, you put your thumb here
and the other fingers here.

447
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:52,607
Jule?

448
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,714
You're being a little over-competitive,
don't you think?

449
00:32:55,785 --> 00:32:59,084
Well, you should've seen the way
those men looked at me.

450
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:05,025
As if I were some frivolous housewife,
just looking for a way to kill time.

451
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:08,191
Well...

452
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:13,860
- Where are you going?
- Not here.

453
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:16,167
- You hungry?
- No.

454
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:19,301
Good.

455
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,240
Ta-da!

456
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:49,799
Well done, Madame Child.

457
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:58,040
<i>Dear Avis,</i>
<i>I'm in my third week at Le Cordon Bleu,</i>

458
00:33:58,214 --> 00:34:00,341
<i>and I'm in utter bliss.</i>

459
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:05,116
<i>Every morning the alarm goes off at 6:30,</i>
<i>and I leap out of bed.</i>

460
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:06,416
I'm up!

461
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:12,257
<i>By 7:30 I'm in class, in my apron,</i>
<i>peeling potatoes.</i>

462
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:16,464
<i>Then we cook stock and we bone fish.</i>

463
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:21,435
<i>We dress pigeons.</i>
<i>We make pastry with so much butter,</i>

464
00:34:21,504 --> 00:34:24,871
<i>it almost stops your heart just to look at it.</i>

465
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:29,339
<i>My teacher moves so quickly</i>
<i>I'm sometimes lost.</i>

466
00:34:29,412 --> 00:34:33,314
<i>But I'm way ahead of the others in the class,</i>
<i>all of them men,</i>

467
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:39,447
<i>and all of them very unfriendly,</i>
<i>until they discovered I was fearless.</i>

468
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,086
<i>Something I realized</i>
<i>about the same time they did.</i>

469
00:34:43,826 --> 00:34:49,924
<i>Morning class ends at 12:30,</i>
<i>then I go home and make lunch for Paul.</i>

470
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,637
<i>Then Paul takes a nap.</i>

471
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:03,810
<i>And later in the afternoon, he goes back</i>
<i>to the embassy and I go back to school.</i>

472
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:09,310
You must have a mortar and pestle.

473
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:14,354
<i>Incidentally, my father is horrified</i>
<i>I'm going to cooking school.</i>

474
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:17,450
<i>Offered to give me extra money</i>
<i>to hire a cook.</i>

475
00:35:18,828 --> 00:35:23,424
Go on. Fun! Joy! This is what matters.

476
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:26,059
<i>I'm probably the only American I know</i>
<i>in Paris</i>

477
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:31,266
<i>who thinks shopping for food</i>
<i>is as much fun as buying a dress.</i>

478
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:33,608
<i>Course, you'd think so too,</i>
<i>if you lived in a country</i>

479
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:37,942
<i>where absolutely nothing comes in my size.</i>

480
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:42,708
<i>By the way, did you know</i>
<i>that if you don't dry meat,</i>

481
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:45,219
<i>it won't brown properly?</i>

482
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:51,490
<i>Irma Rombauer doesn't say a word about it</i>
<i>in the</i> Joy of Cooking.

483
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:55,856
<i>Avis, I am in heaven here.</i>

484
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,195
<i>I've been looking for a career all my life...</i>

485
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:02,766
- Happy Valentine's Day.
<i>...and I've found it.</i>

486
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:06,999
We met in Ceylon when we were in the OSS.

487
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:09,510
But he never noticed me at first.

488
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:12,377
Well, that's not true. I noticed you.
I noticed your legs straightaway.

489
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:14,609
Oh, you were such a roué.

490
00:36:14,951 --> 00:36:19,081
- All the women were mad for him.
- Can you blame them?

491
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:21,680
Anyway, we were sent off to China.

492
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:25,960
Absolutely delicious, if I do say so myself.

493
00:36:26,129 --> 00:36:27,357
Julia.

494
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,796
When you finish your term,
you'll be teaching at Cordon Bleu.

495
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:31,697
No, I don't think so.

496
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:35,463
The woman who runs it absolutely hates me!

497
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:38,473
Come on.
Oh, no one could possibly hate you.

498
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:40,972
That's true. But she does.

499
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:42,601
Were you spies?

500
00:36:44,514 --> 00:36:47,381
No. Yes. No.

501
00:36:48,818 --> 00:36:50,376
Oh, so cagey, right?

502
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:56,119
You were in the Office of Strategic Services
and you were not spies?

503
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:58,759
I was only a file clerk.

504
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:04,690
But Paul? Paul designed all of the secret
war rooms for General Mountbatten.

505
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:07,264
Well, just maps and exhibits and things.
It wasn't...

506
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:10,737
He did!
He single-handedly won the war for us.

507
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:14,868
Well, I had to. Someone did.
I mean, it was dragging on, wasn't it?

508
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:19,343
Anyway, so there we were in China,
just friends having dinner,

509
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:25,750
and it turned out to be Julia.

510
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:29,714
It turned out to be Julia all along.

511
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:38,290
Julia, you are the butter to my bread,
and the breath to my life.

512
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:40,759
I love you, darling girl.

513
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:43,803
Happy Valentine's Day.

514
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:51,604
<i>Dear Charlie,</i>

515
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:55,208
<i>Julia in front of her stove</i>
<i>has the same fascination for me</i>

516
00:37:55,284 --> 00:37:58,219
<i>as watching a kettle drummer</i>
<i>at the symphony.</i>

517
00:37:58,788 --> 00:38:01,723
<i>The oven door opens and shuts so fast,</i>

518
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:06,660
<i>you hardly notice the deft thrust of a spoon</i>
<i>as she dips into a casserole,</i>

519
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,720
<i>and up to her mouth for a taste check</i>

520
00:38:08,798 --> 00:38:11,995
<i>like a perfectly-timed double beat</i>
<i>on the drums.</i>

521
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:14,329
<i>Then with her bare fingers,</i>

522
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:18,703
<i>she snatches a set of cannelloni</i>
<i>out of the pot of boiling water,</i>

523
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:20,036
<i>and she cries,</i>

524
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:23,169
<i>" These damn things</i>
<i>are as hot as a stiff cock. "

525
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:26,214
- She said what?
- I know.

526
00:38:26,282 --> 00:38:29,877
- Julia Child said, "Hot as a..."
- I know, I'm shocked.

527
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:35,686
It's from a letter that Paul Child
wrote to his twin brother Charlie in 1949,

528
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:38,022
when Julia was just starting classes
at Le Cordon Bleu.

529
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:41,222
So Julia and Paul, <i>beaucoup, beaucoup.</i>

530
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:44,494
- I know. Just goes to show you.
- What?

531
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,593
You can never tell about
a person's sex life by looking at them.

532
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,467
They were so in love.

533
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,777
Hot sauce from a reader.

534
00:38:55,878 --> 00:39:00,338
And today I had 12 comments from readers,
and I didn't know any of them.

535
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:04,652
<i>Thanks to all my faithful readers</i>
<i>for this loot.</i>

536
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:08,451
<i>I have now completed 65 recipes in 47 days.</i>

537
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:18,528
<i>On track with 103 recipes</i>
<i>in just over two months.</i>

538
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:19,625
Looks like a cupcake.

539
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:21,966
<i>Lobster thermidor is coming up,</i>

540
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:26,372
<i>and I am going to have to murder</i>
<i>and dismember a crustacean.</i>

541
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:28,744
<i>How will I ever do this?</i>

542
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:31,840
<i>Last night our sleep machine,</i>
<i>the one we have by our bed</i>

543
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:35,179
<i>to drown out the noise of freight trucks</i>
<i>rumbling past our apartment,</i>

544
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:37,981
<i>was speaking to me. And it was saying,</i>

545
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:39,646
"Lobster killer.

546
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:43,448
"Lobster killer, lobster killer, lobster killer."

547
00:39:45,494 --> 00:39:48,361
One of my readers said
that if you put lobsters in the freezer,

548
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,296
it sort of numbs them.

549
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,036
Then I got another comment that said,
"Man up, kill the damn lobster.

550
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:02,339
"Just take a knife and do it."

551
00:40:07,717 --> 00:40:09,241
It's alive!

552
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:10,512
Eric.

553
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:17,189
Oh, God.

554
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:21,295
"A note on dealing with live lobsters.

555
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:25,130
"If you object to steaming
a live lobster," yes,

556
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:29,160
"plunge the point of the knife
into the head between the eyes."

557
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:33,499
Oh, Julia, you make it sound so simple.

558
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:35,168
Lobster killer.

559
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:36,705
Eric.

560
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:39,311
Eric.

561
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:41,145
Get out of here.

562
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:44,544
I don't need you at all.
You are completely useless.

563
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,920
I'm just gonna throw them into the water

564
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:52,290
and put the lid on and that will be that.

565
00:40:52,361 --> 00:40:53,419
Fine.

566
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:54,588
Fine.

567
00:40:58,234 --> 00:40:59,428
Hello.

568
00:41:00,302 --> 00:41:01,530
Goodbye.

569
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,505
I'm sorry.

570
00:41:10,212 --> 00:41:11,611
I'm sorry.

571
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:30,028
You okay?

572
00:41:32,068 --> 00:41:33,330
Okay.

573
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:37,365
Okay. All right.

574
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,466
All right, boys.

575
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,308
There's a new sheriff in town.

576
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,506
Lobster killer.

577
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:50,916
Lobster killer.

578
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:58,651
Under control.

579
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,653
You are a saint.

580
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,690
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

581
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:06,860
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

582
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:11,834
- I can't. I can't.
- You can.

583
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,034
- No, I can't. I have a lot to do.
- You can.

584
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,236
- Eric, I can't.
- I'm good.

585
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:16,403
- Eric.
- Just give me one more, give me one more.

586
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:20,074
- Just one more.
- Fine. Go, I have so much to do. Get!

587
00:42:20,149 --> 00:42:21,377
Out!

588
00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:27,345
- Hey, thank you so much.
- Hey, man. How you doing?

589
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:28,481
Happy birthday.

590
00:42:28,557 --> 00:42:29,751
Yeah, terrific. Good to see you.

591
00:42:29,825 --> 00:42:32,225
- Cake.
- Cake. Brother-in-law.

592
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:33,989
- Love you so much.
- Hey, man.

593
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:35,553
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

594
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:37,155
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

595
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:38,791
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

596
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:41,767
Happy birthday, Julie.

597
00:42:41,837 --> 00:42:43,896
- Happy birthday.
- Hi! Thanks, sweetheart.

598
00:42:43,973 --> 00:42:46,999
Oh, thanks for coming all out here. Hey, you.

599
00:42:48,244 --> 00:42:51,372
Here's an incredible thing.
When Julia and Paul met, she was a virgin.

600
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:52,812
- Really?
- Wow.

601
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:55,282
She was, like, practically 40.

602
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:57,444
- You serious?
- How does anyone even know that?

603
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,614
There were all these letters that Julia
wrote to her friend Avis De Voto.

604
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:04,454
And Paul wrote to his brother, and no
one threw anything out, as far as I can tell.

605
00:43:04,493 --> 00:43:07,553
When they got married,
she could barely boil an egg.

606
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,824
Isn't that amazing?

607
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:10,092
Really?

608
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,592
- Braised cucumbers are a revelation.
- This is good.

609
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,264
I'm obsessed with her. I'm totally obsessed.

610
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:18,601
She's totally obsessed.

611
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,972
Well, it's good that you are,
because this is amazing.

612
00:43:21,043 --> 00:43:22,601
Seriously. So good.

613
00:43:22,678 --> 00:43:26,375
Well, savor it, because that's all there is.
I mean, lobster, major bucks.

614
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:29,474
Why don't you put a PayPal thing
on the website?

615
00:43:29,552 --> 00:43:31,417
People could send in money
if they felt like it.

616
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:33,421
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

617
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:35,423
You have fans, your readers love you.

618
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:38,255
I do? I have fans?

619
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,056
Yeah, you do.

620
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:44,127
- Well, I can't ask them for money.
- Why not?

621
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,035
I think you should do the PayPal thing.
That way we could have more lobster.

622
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:54,235
- Harder. Get them. Get them. Hey, hey, hey!
- Thirty. Thirty. Thirty. Thirty. Thirty.

623
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:59,606
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

624
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:03,282
Thank you.

625
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:18,328
Just like Julia's.

626
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:23,831
Only hers were probably the real deal.

627
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:26,370
They're beautiful.

628
00:44:26,442 --> 00:44:28,205
Help you put it on.

629
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:34,111
Let's give this a shot here.

630
00:44:38,854 --> 00:44:40,321
How's that?

631
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,750
Yeah.

632
00:44:43,626 --> 00:44:45,253
I'm 30.

633
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:48,856
I thought it was gonna be terrible,

634
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:53,592
but thanks to you, and thanks to Julia,

635
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:56,229
it feels like I'm gonna get through.

636
00:44:58,574 --> 00:44:59,768
Cake.

637
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,969
More cake. How do you like that cake?

638
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:11,417
Hey, you.

639
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:15,516
I'm going to bed.

640
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:25,594
Ernie, 53 comments on my lobster blog.

641
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:26,930
Shut up.

642
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:31,569
- Julie Powell.
<i>- This the person I speak to</i>

643
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,698
<i>if I got a problem?</i>

644
00:45:32,775 --> 00:45:34,003
Yes, sir. What is your problem?

645
00:45:34,076 --> 00:45:36,636
<i>Too much food, not enough sex.</i>

646
00:45:37,947 --> 00:45:39,244
Eric, that's not funny.

647
00:45:39,315 --> 00:45:41,647
<i>I thought it was pretty funny.</i>

648
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:43,175
Okay, it was.

649
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:44,879
<i>- Hey, guess what?</i>
- What?

650
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:48,822
You are the third most
popular blog on salon. com.

651
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:51,588
- I am?
<i>- Yes, you are.</i>

652
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,820
I am!

653
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:56,355
So I figure for every one who writes in,

654
00:45:56,432 --> 00:46:00,425
there are, I don't know, hundreds that don't.
Don't you think?

655
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:05,369
It's like there's this whole group of people
who are sort of connected to me.

656
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:08,534
They need me in some way.

657
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:12,979
Like, if I didn't write,
they would really be upset.

658
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:18,344
They'd probably take, like, poison,
try to kill themselves.

659
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:49,279
Julia.

660
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,718
Are you still making hats?

661
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:54,347
Oh, no, I abandoned it.

662
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:58,883
But I am ready to graduate
from the Cordon Bleu.

663
00:46:59,428 --> 00:47:03,660
I can't get the damn woman
who runs the school to schedule the test.

664
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:07,525
Madame Brassart?
Is that the woman you are speaking of?

665
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,499
She is a bitch.

666
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:12,570
She is, you're right.

667
00:47:12,975 --> 00:47:18,106
I think she's almost the only person
in the world I honestly can't stand.

668
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:22,950
She is not the only person I can't stand.

669
00:47:23,786 --> 00:47:25,219
Do you two know each other?

670
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:28,120
You should. Julia Child, Simone Beck.

671
00:47:28,524 --> 00:47:30,958
- Simca.
- Simca, how do you do?

672
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,729
And this is my friend Louisette Bertholle.

673
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,163
I can't believe you haven't met.

674
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:42,169
Simca and Louisette are writing a cookbook.

675
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:45,531
- For Americans.
- Really?

676
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,837
Why do you need to take a stupid test?

677
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:52,671
So I can get a diploma. So I can teach.

678
00:47:53,382 --> 00:47:55,873
You don't need a diploma to teach.

679
00:47:56,518 --> 00:47:57,951
You're probably right.

680
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,818
- Avis says the same thing.
- Who is Avis?

681
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,916
My friend, Avis De Voto,
who lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

682
00:48:05,227 --> 00:48:06,990
She's very wise.

683
00:48:07,162 --> 00:48:11,462
But I can't help it. I want a diploma.

684
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:15,230
I am very conventional.

685
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:20,900
I don't know what to do.

686
00:48:21,677 --> 00:48:26,671
Well, why don't you write
to the horrible Madame Brassart

687
00:48:26,748 --> 00:48:28,079
and threaten her?

688
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,742
Threaten her? With what?

689
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:32,082
The United States of America.

690
00:48:32,154 --> 00:48:33,382
Yes!

691
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:36,447
Tell her the American ambassador
personally wants you

692
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:38,459
to take the examination.

693
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:40,586
No, no, no, no, no, no.

694
00:48:40,696 --> 00:48:43,187
I couldn't do that. Heavens, no!

695
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:46,996
The American ambassador.
Hardly even know the man.

696
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:49,068
Of course you can.

697
00:48:49,138 --> 00:48:51,197
<i>Dear Madame Brassart,</i>

698
00:48:51,673 --> 00:48:54,301
<i>everyone at the American embassy,</i>

699
00:48:54,376 --> 00:48:57,971
<i>including my dear friend the ambassador,</i>

700
00:48:58,046 --> 00:49:03,712
<i>will be very surprised if I'm not allowed</i>
<i>to take my examination.</i>

701
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:05,980
You will write the recipes

702
00:49:06,555 --> 00:49:09,649
for <i>oeufs mollets.</i>
<i>Côtelettes de veau en surprise,</i>

703
00:49:09,725 --> 00:49:12,159
<i>et crème renversée au caramel.</i>

704
00:49:13,695 --> 00:49:18,359
<i>Côtelettes de veau en surprise.</i>

705
00:49:19,968 --> 00:49:24,667
I had no idea
what veal <i>en surprise</i> was. None.

706
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:30,110
Cooked it in class.
It's a veal chop with mushrooms in a bag.

707
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:33,342
A paper bag. That's the surprise.

708
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:35,713
You open the bag, surprise!

709
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:42,346
Veal and mushrooms, it's just
I've never flunked a test in my entire life.

710
00:49:42,424 --> 00:49:47,361
- I am an A student.
- You can ask to take it again.

711
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,032
- I can?
- Of course.

712
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:57,162
Meanwhile, you can come teach with us.

713
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:00,733
Gosh!

714
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,873
Is it true you plan to teach?

715
00:50:04,947 --> 00:50:08,508
Yes, we're going to teach
Americans in Paris how to cook.

716
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:15,056
Madame Child, I must tell you,
you have no real talent for cooking.

717
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:20,495
But the Americans
will never know the difference.

718
00:50:31,306 --> 00:50:35,333
<i>We are, I am sorry to say, entering aspics.</i>

719
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:39,979
<i>An aspic is sort of a beef-flavored</i>
<i>Jell-O mold.</i>

720
00:50:40,048 --> 00:50:41,709
<i>Doesn't that sound delicious?</i>

721
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:44,809
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>why no one makes them anymore.</i>

722
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:46,410
<i>You begin with a calf's foot,</i>

723
00:50:46,488 --> 00:50:49,651
<i>which I am in possession of</i>
<i>thanks to my sainted husband,</i>

724
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:53,661
<i>and you boil it until</i>
<i>your kitchen smells like a tannery.</i>

725
00:50:54,463 --> 00:50:58,490
<i>And then it gels in the refrigerator</i>
<i>and you flip it onto a plate.</i>

726
00:50:58,834 --> 00:51:01,826
<i>Which, according to Julia Child,</i>
<i>is supposed to be easy.</i>

727
00:51:01,903 --> 00:51:06,169
<i>And all I can say about that,</i>
<i>no offense intended, Julia, is</i>

728
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:08,170
<i>the bitch lied.</i>

729
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:10,911
Shit.

730
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:16,977
- Shit!
- How many more aspics are there?

731
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:18,679
Seven.

732
00:51:19,721 --> 00:51:21,655
No one will know if you don't do them.

733
00:51:21,723 --> 00:51:24,851
It's not like there's, like,
the Aspic Police or something.

734
00:51:24,926 --> 00:51:26,416
You could lie.

735
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:28,759
I can't. I just can't.

736
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:32,857
Julia will know. It's like she's watching me.
I'm under her influence.

737
00:51:32,934 --> 00:51:36,097
I'm becoming a much better person
because of her.

738
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,167
Yuck! The sink! Look at this!

739
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:45,512
I hate it here!
Did you put something down the sink?

740
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,569
You hate it here?

741
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:49,913
How am I supposed to cook anything
in this kitchen?

742
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:54,285
It's no wonder that my mold fell apart.
I don't suppose we have any Drano.

743
00:51:54,356 --> 00:51:56,347
Not unless you bought it.

744
00:51:56,992 --> 00:51:59,586
I do all of this
and I'm supposed to buy Drano, too?

745
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:03,495
Right now, you are so
not under the influence of Julia Child.

746
00:52:06,902 --> 00:52:11,771
What if I don't make my deadline, Eric?
I'll have wasted a whole year of my life.

747
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,037
I used to be thin and now I'm getting fat.

748
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,338
- Fat?
- On top of which,

749
00:52:16,411 --> 00:52:17,935
I have to bone a whole duck.

750
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:20,072
- When?
- At some point.

751
00:52:20,148 --> 00:52:23,345
- Can you even conceive of boning a duck?
- No, I can't.

752
00:52:23,418 --> 00:52:25,215
Of course you can't.

753
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:31,720
<i>I'm sure you all remember,</i>
<i>because it was only a few days ago,</i>

754
00:52:31,793 --> 00:52:34,193
<i>that I had a meltdown over my aspic</i>

755
00:52:34,262 --> 00:52:37,925
<i>and vowed to transform myself</i>
<i>into a better human being.</i>

756
00:52:39,267 --> 00:52:42,998
<i>And then I was trussing</i>
<i>the</i> poulet rôti à la normande,

757
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:46,700
<i>which is roast chicken stuffed with</i>
<i>chicken livers and cream cheese,</i>

758
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:51,235
<i>and it fell on the floor and the stuffing</i>
<i>fell out into a big gooey mess.</i>

759
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:55,416
<i>So, long story short, another meltdown.</i>

760
00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:56,974
This is crazy.

761
00:52:57,352 --> 00:52:58,785
<i>Worse than the last.</i>

762
00:53:01,189 --> 00:53:03,384
I can't even truss.

763
00:53:04,025 --> 00:53:07,961
<i>And I cried like a small,</i>
<i>emotionally disturbed child.</i>

764
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,354
I'm a mess.

765
00:53:16,605 --> 00:53:18,596
I got it. I got it.

766
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:20,799
Hello?

767
00:53:22,811 --> 00:53:24,278
Yeah, who's this?

768
00:53:27,115 --> 00:53:28,514
Can you hold on just one second?

769
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:32,417
I'm not sure if she's here.
She might've stepped out. Hold on.

770
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,187
Hey, it's a reporter from
<i>The Christian Science Monitor.</i>

771
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:44,357
He wants to write about you.

772
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:48,365
He does?

773
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:51,531
I should tell him to call back, right?

774
00:53:51,606 --> 00:53:53,801
No, no, I'll take it.

775
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,940
Hello?

776
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:02,674
Yes?

777
00:54:03,852 --> 00:54:06,184
You want to bring who to dinner?

778
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:11,190
No, of course, I know who that is.
I know exactly who that is.

779
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:12,920
Who? Who, who, who, who?

780
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:17,396
That would be great,
that would be completely amazing.

781
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:18,728
Goodbye.

782
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:22,596
- Who?
- Guess who's coming to dinner?

783
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:24,704
Oh, my God.

784
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,600
To <i>Les Trois Gourmandes.</i>

785
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,108
One for all and all for one.

786
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:33,305
Yes!

787
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:37,444
All right. I had such a horrible time

788
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,922
converting these recipes
from the metric system.

789
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:45,824
- Measurements do not matter.
- Oh, but they do!

790
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:49,263
They absolutely do.

791
00:54:49,331 --> 00:54:50,764
This is one of the biggest arguments

792
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:53,232
Louisette and I had
when we worked on our cookbook.

793
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:55,326
Which is finally finished.

794
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:59,737
Sent off to the publisher.
Soon Simca and I will be famous.

795
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:02,605
We'll be the next Mrs. <i>Joy of Cooking.</i>

796
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:07,679
Maybe. All right. Well, let's try.
Let's just give it a...

797
00:55:08,984 --> 00:55:10,349
Can I help?

798
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:17,625
Yeah. It is <i>mieux.</i>

799
00:55:20,128 --> 00:55:24,895
So, yes. They're early. Americans!

800
00:55:25,267 --> 00:55:30,864
<i>Dear Dorothy,</i>
<i>your sister, Julia, is now a cooking teacher.</i>

801
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:35,205
<i>We have three students who pay $2 a class.</i>

802
00:55:35,277 --> 00:55:38,872
<i>Barely enough to cover the cost of the food,</i>
<i>but who cares?</i>

803
00:55:38,947 --> 00:55:43,907
<i>Simca, Louisette, and I
<i>are</i> Les Trois Gourmandes.

804
00:55:44,085 --> 00:55:47,486
<i>Although sometimes we are only</i>
Les Deux Gourmandes

805
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:51,048
<i>because Louisette</i>
<i>turns out to have headaches</i>

806
00:55:51,126 --> 00:55:55,688
<i>and doctor's appointments</i>
<i>she schedules during class.</i>

807
00:55:55,764 --> 00:55:57,789
I have a little headache.

808
00:55:59,434 --> 00:56:02,699
<i>You'll meet them both</i>
<i>when you come here next month,</i>

809
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:06,502
<i>unless, of course,</i>
<i>Louisette is having a stomachache.</i>

810
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:12,104
Perfection.
And even if it isn't, never apologize.

811
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,445
No excuses! No explanations.

812
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:19,412
Louisette abandoned us,
another stomachache.

813
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:21,011
And the day before that,

814
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:25,651
she left class before we even finished
making the chocolate Bavarian cream.

815
00:56:26,027 --> 00:56:30,760
I can't believe that's the only time
her dentist could see her.

816
00:56:30,832 --> 00:56:33,232
Keep an eye out,
we don't want to miss Dorothy.

817
00:56:33,301 --> 00:56:35,667
It's impossible to miss your sister.

818
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,231
I don't see her!

819
00:56:43,745 --> 00:56:46,612
- There she is.
- Dorothy!

820
00:56:51,686 --> 00:56:54,780
Hi, Julia! I missed you!

821
00:56:54,856 --> 00:56:56,187
So good to see...

822
00:56:56,257 --> 00:56:58,191
- Paul!
- Hi. Hi, sweetie.

823
00:56:58,259 --> 00:57:01,990
I've had an adventure on the ocean liner!

824
00:57:02,063 --> 00:57:05,191
- I didn't get sick once!
- Good girl! How about your legs?

825
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:08,463
People were dropping like flies
all around me!

826
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:13,804
- Look.
- Oh, my goodness.

827
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:15,536
Look at that.

828
00:57:17,379 --> 00:57:23,682
All I think about all day is food
and then I dream about it all night.

829
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,450
It is true, she's obsessed.

830
00:57:26,521 --> 00:57:29,183
If I didn't sit in the kitchen, I'd never see her.

831
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:34,250
Last week, I dreamed that
I made <i>cassoulet</i> for Dad,

832
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:37,230
and he hated it, of course.

833
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:39,766
He doesn't understand any of this.

834
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,665
I almost feel sorry for him.

835
00:57:41,736 --> 00:57:44,830
He wanted so much
for us to stay in Pasadena,

836
00:57:44,906 --> 00:57:47,739
marry Republicans, and breed like rabbits.

837
00:57:48,176 --> 00:57:50,804
- Why didn't we?
- Too tall.

838
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:52,608
Let's face it, it's true.

839
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:55,411
From the beginning,
you just don't fit in. Literally.

840
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:58,315
- So then you don't.
- I know, it's true.

841
00:57:58,386 --> 00:58:01,412
Do not bait Father about politics
when he comes.

842
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:03,957
- No.
- Or he won't pick up the check.

843
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:07,051
- He won't, will he?
- I can't make any promises.

844
00:58:07,128 --> 00:58:10,120
- He loves Senator McCarthy.
- Oh, I know.

845
00:58:10,198 --> 00:58:11,358
- Pasadena.
- Pasadena.

846
00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:12,491
Jinx.

847
00:58:20,308 --> 00:58:22,367
Dort, do you have... You have the Brie.

848
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:24,071
- Is this the Brie?
- Yes. Yes, that's the Brie.

849
00:58:24,145 --> 00:58:27,171
Is that not the most wonderful cheese
you ever had in your life?

850
00:58:27,248 --> 00:58:29,079
- Yes!
- Yes.

851
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,811
The answer's yes.

852
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:40,357
I got the chef at Chez la Mère Michel
to give me the recipe for <i>beurre blanc.</i>

853
00:58:40,428 --> 00:58:42,760
<i>Beurre blanc.</i> What's <i>beurre blanc?</i>

854
00:58:42,831 --> 00:58:46,494
- Butter in a white wine vinegar reduction.
- I love butter.

855
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:49,530
You whisk them together,

856
00:58:49,604 --> 00:58:54,268
and the acid in the vinegar
works on the milk solids in the butter

857
00:58:54,342 --> 00:58:57,505
so that the butter, instead of melting,
becomes this

858
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:00,639
creamy, light, frothy,

859
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:04,651
with kind of a fantastic subtle kind of...

860
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:06,447
Tangy.

861
00:59:07,288 --> 00:59:09,017
It has a tanginess.

862
00:59:09,657 --> 00:59:11,022
Tanginess?

863
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:12,418
Yes.

864
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:14,952
Well, that's...

865
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,695
That's who I married.

866
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:21,398
Anyway,

867
00:59:21,469 --> 00:59:26,133
you serve it on fish and it's splendid.
I'm going to make it for you.

868
00:59:26,207 --> 00:59:27,936
- That'll be divine.
- Yeah.

869
00:59:28,009 --> 00:59:30,500
And, Dort, we're going to throw you a party.

870
00:59:31,817 --> 00:59:34,479
- Really?
- Very exciting.

871
00:59:34,553 --> 00:59:37,750
By the way, there's a man
that I want to introduce you to.

872
00:59:37,823 --> 00:59:39,620
I think you'll really...

873
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:40,920
He's...

874
00:59:41,994 --> 00:59:43,359
Tall. He's very tall.

875
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:45,863
- Pardon?
- Tall. He's very.

876
00:59:45,931 --> 00:59:48,229
- Extremely tall.
- I'm extremely tall.

877
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:51,893
- But he's even taller, so that's good.
- He is even taller.

878
00:59:51,971 --> 00:59:53,029
Well, that's good.

879
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,548
All right.

880
01:00:06,952 --> 01:00:08,419
Pretty good.

881
01:00:12,758 --> 01:00:13,850
But not great.

882
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:31,405
Hello, ladies. Anybody want anything?

883
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:32,903
Yes.

884
01:00:32,978 --> 01:00:35,674
Help yourself. The tapenade is marvelous.

885
01:00:35,748 --> 01:00:37,579
Julia, there you are.

886
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:40,447
John!

887
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,547
There you are.

888
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:44,748
Now, where is this sister of yours?

889
01:00:44,824 --> 01:00:47,019
She's right over there. Hi, John.

890
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:48,788
- Hi, Paul.
- There.

891
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:52,488
So we've told her a lot about you.

892
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,897
Well, I don't want to
interrupt her conversation.

893
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:58,459
With Ivan Cousins? They just met.

894
01:00:58,671 --> 01:01:02,107
I can't imagine Dorothy running off
with Ivan Cousins.

895
01:01:40,713 --> 01:01:42,340
Dearly beloved...

896
01:01:56,695 --> 01:01:58,526
John, this is lovely.

897
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:01,464
I've never been to a wedding like this before.

898
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,933
Here, Julia.

899
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:07,001
- What a beautiful wedding.
- Thanks, Pops.

900
01:02:07,339 --> 01:02:10,536
I am not enthusiastic about this marriage.

901
01:02:11,243 --> 01:02:14,735
Well, you weren't very enthusiastic
about ours, either.

902
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,974
True.

903
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:20,210
How are things at the embassy, Paul?

904
01:02:20,886 --> 01:02:23,684
Fine. Thank you, Phila. Thank you.

905
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:28,922
Well, not fine, really, because
they've cut our library allowance by 90%.

906
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:32,928
It seems that Senator McCarthy
has very long arms.

907
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:35,466
Senator McCarthy is a man
who knows his mind.

908
01:02:35,534 --> 01:02:38,765
I admire a man who knows his mind.

909
01:02:39,638 --> 01:02:43,699
Well, we know lots of people in Washington
who have lost their jobs,

910
01:02:43,776 --> 01:02:47,644
after years in government service,
for no reason whatsoever.

911
01:02:47,713 --> 01:02:52,377
And Paul had to make a list of
every single book in the embassy library.

912
01:02:52,885 --> 01:02:56,252
Surely you're not suggesting that
the French government is any better.

913
01:02:56,322 --> 01:02:58,654
- And...
- Shall we dance?

914
01:02:58,757 --> 01:03:00,588
Come on, dance with me.

915
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:01,957
Excuse us.

916
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:06,562
You said you didn't want to talk about it,
then you went and talked about it.

917
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:07,963
I know, I never learn.

918
01:03:49,508 --> 01:03:51,373
Where's my big sprig?

919
01:03:54,113 --> 01:03:56,206
Up here, whipping away.

920
01:03:57,149 --> 01:04:00,983
And for dinner, mayonnaise?

921
01:04:04,356 --> 01:04:07,348
- That's good.
- That is good, isn't it?

922
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:11,487
- Very. From your sister.
- I'm going to send this recipe to Avis.

923
01:04:11,563 --> 01:04:13,588
I'm very excited about it.

924
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:18,300
- I think it's a breakthrough.
- Well, it tastes like it.

925
01:04:31,383 --> 01:04:33,180
Dorothy is pregnant.

926
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:39,348
Paul.

927
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:45,128
Isn't that wonderful?

928
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,524
Yes.

929
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,132
Okay.

930
01:04:56,909 --> 01:04:58,001
Okay.

931
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,544
- I'm so happy.
- I know.

932
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:05,076
I know.

933
01:05:06,085 --> 01:05:11,751
If you warm the bowl slightly
before you beat in the egg yolk,

934
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,689
it changes everything.

935
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:19,729
Foolproof mayonnaise. Absolutely foolproof.

936
01:05:23,302 --> 01:05:24,792
I typed it up.

937
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:34,540
- You disagree?
- About the mayonnaise? Not at all.

938
01:05:34,913 --> 01:05:36,847
I'm sure you're exactly right.

939
01:05:36,915 --> 01:05:42,251
Scientific workability. That's my motto.

940
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:45,149
Julia.

941
01:05:46,158 --> 01:05:47,853
We have a little problem.

942
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,860
- Our editor...
- For our cookbook.

943
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:54,364
...thinks our book is not in English.

944
01:05:54,433 --> 01:05:56,560
But your book is in English.

945
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,334
They are giving it a rejection.

946
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,672
But they suggest that
if we are continuing with it,

947
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,836
we should get a collaborator
who could take what we have

948
01:06:07,913 --> 01:06:10,609
and make it work for American cooks.

949
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:16,110
Would you do it, Julia?

950
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,890
Would I do it?

951
01:06:24,963 --> 01:06:26,021
Yes.

952
01:06:29,134 --> 01:06:34,231
<i>We are now going to play a round of</i>
<i>"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner."</i>

953
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:38,802
<i>This Wednesday, I am going to be</i>
<i>playing host to a distinguished guest.</i>

954
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:40,139
<i>Clue number one.</i>

955
01:06:41,513 --> 01:06:44,505
<i>The degree of separation</i>
<i>between Julia Child and me</i>

956
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:48,041
<i>is about to shrink</i>
<i>by a factor of about a thousand.</i>

957
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,144
A thousand.

958
01:06:49,221 --> 01:06:53,317
<i>In answer to your questions, no, it is not</i>
<i>Amanda Hesser of</i> The New York Times

959
01:06:53,392 --> 01:06:55,917
<i>or Nigella Lawson, or Ina Garten.</i>

960
01:06:56,495 --> 01:06:58,292
<i>But here's clue number two,</i>

961
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,255
<i>I will be making</i> boeuf bourguignon,

962
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:04,234
<i>which was the first dish</i>
<i>our distinguished guest cooked</i>

963
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:07,966
<i>upon reading</i> Mastering the Art
of French Cooking <i>for the first time.</i>

964
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,407
<i>Boeuf bourguignon.</i>
Julia Child's <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

965
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:16,244
<i>Well, since no one guessed my mystery</i>
<i>guest, I'm going to have to tell you all.</i>

966
01:07:16,582 --> 01:07:19,312
<i>It's Judith Jones,</i>
<i>the editor who's responsible</i>

967
01:07:19,384 --> 01:07:22,785
<i>for getting Julia's cookbook published</i>
<i>way back when,</i>

968
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:26,484
<i>the woman who recognized history</i>
<i>in an onionskin manuscript.</i>

969
01:07:26,558 --> 01:07:29,789
<i>She's older and probably not used to</i>
<i>eating at 10:00 at night,</i>

970
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:34,322
<i>which is why I'm being diligent about this</i>
<i>and making the stew the night before.</i>

971
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:36,162
<i>And as I cook it,</i>

972
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:40,171
<i>I almost feel as if Julia and I
<i>are communicating over space and time</i>

973
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:42,799
<i>on a deep, spiritual, mystical level.</i>

974
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:46,675
<i>Although, mostly, I'm just talking to myself.</i>

975
01:07:47,513 --> 01:07:50,778
- How long does it take to cook?
- Two and a half hours.

976
01:07:56,755 --> 01:07:57,983
<i>Welcome.</i>

977
01:07:58,724 --> 01:08:00,715
<i>I'm Julia Child.</i>

978
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:06,363
<i>And today we're going to make</i>
<i>a holiday feast, or</i> les fêtes d'holiday.

979
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:11,266
<i>And we're going to start with half- boned</i>
<i>chicken or</i> poularde demi- désossée.

980
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:17,007
<i>Now, first, remove the liver and fry it up</i>
<i>with some onions for a little snack</i>

981
01:08:17,075 --> 01:08:21,171
<i>or perhaps a delicious liverwurst</i>
<i>which you can spread on a cracker,</i>

982
01:08:21,246 --> 01:08:24,340
<i>a Ritz cracker, a saltine.</i>

983
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:25,944
Saltine.

984
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:29,647
<i>Or if you have a pet, a cat or a dog,</i>
<i>they love liver.</i>

985
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:31,052
<i>Save the liver.</i>

986
01:08:31,123 --> 01:08:33,614
- Save the liver.
- Save the liver.

987
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:34,852
<i>Now, you place the chicken on its stomach</i>

988
01:08:34,927 --> 01:08:38,863
<i>and cut along the backbone</i>
<i>to the pope's nose, like so.</i>

989
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,498
<i>Crack!</i>

990
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,428
<i>Now I've done it,</i>
<i>I've cut the dickens out of my finger.</i>

991
01:08:44,503 --> 01:08:46,937
<i>Well, I'm glad, in a way, this happened.</i>

992
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:50,668
<i>You know, accidents do occur</i>
<i>from time to time in the kitchen.</i>

993
01:08:50,742 --> 01:08:53,905
<i>We've never really discussed what to do.</i>

994
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:56,675
<i>First, you must stop the bleeding.</i>

995
01:08:58,317 --> 01:09:02,014
<i>The best way is with direct pressure</i>
<i>on the apron, like so.</i>

996
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:05,779
<i>You want to raise your hand over your head.</i>

997
01:09:05,857 --> 01:09:10,226
<i>I recommend natural coagulants,</i>
<i>such as chicken liver.</i>

998
01:09:10,862 --> 01:09:13,922
<i>Another reason not to throw away the liver.</i>

999
01:09:15,033 --> 01:09:18,935
<i>Oh, God, it's throbbing!</i>
<i>A tourniquet, that's it.</i>

1000
01:09:19,004 --> 01:09:20,801
<i>Why are you all spinning?</i>

1001
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:24,637
<i>Well, I think I'm going to go to sleep now.</i>
Bon appétit.

1002
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:12,288
No, no, no!

1003
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:28,566
Well, it's just a big, dry collection
of recipes.

1004
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,074
It doesn't work at all.

1005
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:35,375
I'm just gonna have to throw
most of it out and start all over again!

1006
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,841
This has got to be a cookbook

1007
01:10:39,918 --> 01:10:44,651
that makes French cooking accessible
to Americans who do not have cooks.

1008
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:48,155
Who are servantless.

1009
01:10:49,961 --> 01:10:51,485
Is that a word?

1010
01:10:51,663 --> 01:10:54,291
Servantless.

1011
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,199
I think it is a word.

1012
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:59,632
Julia?

1013
01:11:02,307 --> 01:11:07,574
- What if we had to leave Paris?
- Why would we have to leave Paris?

1014
01:11:08,113 --> 01:11:11,173
Because my assignment was for four years.

1015
01:11:11,249 --> 01:11:14,082
So then we still have time.

1016
01:11:14,886 --> 01:11:16,353
Eight months.

1017
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:23,150
And this cookbook is not something
you can finish in eight months.

1018
01:11:23,228 --> 01:11:28,222
No. But two years seems possible.

1019
01:11:30,802 --> 01:11:31,962
Julia.

1020
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,204
What if they transfer me someplace else?

1021
01:11:37,275 --> 01:11:39,004
Would they do that?

1022
01:11:39,711 --> 01:11:40,871
Yes.

1023
01:11:41,446 --> 01:11:43,778
They don't really care about me.

1024
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:48,583
Paul. Of course they do.

1025
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,884
They don't, really.

1026
01:11:54,559 --> 01:11:56,584
Well, if we can't stay in Paris,

1027
01:11:56,661 --> 01:11:59,824
then I'll just mail the pages
to Louisette and Simca

1028
01:11:59,931 --> 01:12:01,523
and they can mail them back to me.

1029
01:12:01,566 --> 01:12:06,230
That's why they invented the mail system
and carbon paper and onionskin copies,

1030
01:12:06,304 --> 01:12:09,273
or I can just jump on the train to Paris

1031
01:12:09,341 --> 01:12:14,244
whenever the three of us
absolutely have to work together, you know.

1032
01:12:14,312 --> 01:12:19,079
Or the two of us, actually, because as
we know, Louisette does next to nothing.

1033
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:23,788
But we would still be somewhere in Europe.

1034
01:12:23,855 --> 01:12:25,720
Don't you think?

1035
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:30,660
It's very hard to say,
given the current political climate.

1036
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:36,390
Senator McCarthy
does not like people like us.

1037
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:39,297
Us? Why? What have we done?

1038
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:44,266
We haven't done anything.
That's not the point.

1039
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:49,744
The point is, we were in China.
And that's practically sufficient.

1040
01:12:49,815 --> 01:12:51,976
Well, meanwhile, we're still here.

1041
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:54,678
- Yes, we are. You're right.
- Yes.

1042
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,183
Here's to the book.

1043
01:12:58,056 --> 01:13:00,889
<i>French Cooking for All!</i>

1044
01:13:02,828 --> 01:13:07,959
Or <i>French Home Cooking.</i>
Do you like that? Which one do you like?

1045
01:13:08,033 --> 01:13:09,660
I like them both.

1046
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:16,973
<i>Dear Avis, enclosed is part of our cookbook</i>
<i>from the chapter on sauces.</i>

1047
01:13:17,275 --> 01:13:20,836
<i>Naturally, it must not be shown to anyone</i>

1048
01:13:21,012 --> 01:13:24,641
<i>unless you are sure they are not,</i>
<i>never have been,</i>

1049
01:13:24,716 --> 01:13:28,584
<i>and won't have anything to do</i>
<i>with the publishing business.</i>

1050
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:31,850
<i>There are people</i>
<i>who would love nothing more</i>

1051
01:13:31,923 --> 01:13:35,290
<i>than to steal this hollandaise recipe.</i>

1052
01:13:37,295 --> 01:13:40,856
We're late! Do you suppose she'll be there?

1053
01:13:40,932 --> 01:13:44,493
Louisette? Of course she'll be there.
It's at her house.

1054
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:47,336
I was making a little joke.

1055
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:51,506
- What's this about, anyway?
- Louisette wouldn't tell me.

1056
01:13:51,576 --> 01:13:53,874
She said it was a surprise.

1057
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:58,108
Maybe she's dropping out of the project.
That would be heavenly.

1058
01:13:58,216 --> 01:14:00,116
- Julia.
- Well, it would.

1059
01:14:05,557 --> 01:14:10,324
My friends, this is Irma Rombauer.

1060
01:14:11,429 --> 01:14:13,488
Mrs. <i>Joy?</i>

1061
01:14:14,799 --> 01:14:18,599
The first edition of the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>
took me a year to write.

1062
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:22,766
Only a year? Including testing the recipes?

1063
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:28,344
Well, I didn't really test all the recipes.
There were so many of them.

1064
01:14:28,413 --> 01:14:32,577
And then I found a publisher,
a small printer in St. Louis.

1065
01:14:33,118 --> 01:14:35,052
How much money did he pay you?

1066
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,521
I paid him. $3,000.

1067
01:14:38,623 --> 01:14:42,218
- $3,000?
- A small fortune.

1068
01:14:42,294 --> 01:14:46,628
But I had a little life insurance money
because my husband...

1069
01:14:48,099 --> 01:14:50,363
- No!
- He killed himself?

1070
01:14:50,435 --> 01:14:51,766
Yes.

1071
01:14:51,836 --> 01:14:55,135
And I thought, "Well, what else am I
gonna do with the insurance money?"

1072
01:14:55,206 --> 01:14:57,333
And then, the book began to sell

1073
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:01,277
and Bobbs- Merrill picked it up,
so now I had a real publisher.

1074
01:15:01,379 --> 01:15:03,313
And they gave you some money?

1075
01:15:03,348 --> 01:15:04,576
Absolutely not.

1076
01:15:04,649 --> 01:15:08,176
They swindled me. They stole my copyright,

1077
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:11,347
and now there's a new edition,
and guess what?

1078
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:15,120
- What?
- The index is a complete calamity.

1079
01:15:15,193 --> 01:15:20,096
If you're looking for City Chicken,
you're not gonna find it under "C."

1080
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:21,359
Really?

1081
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:24,601
It's under "Drumsticks, Mock."

1082
01:15:25,904 --> 01:15:27,303
No.

1083
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,000
All she wanted to talk about

1084
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:35,237
was how her publisher had cheated her

1085
01:15:35,313 --> 01:15:38,510
out of thousands of dollars in royalties.

1086
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,915
It just made me realize this...

1087
01:15:41,553 --> 01:15:45,489
Not going to be simple,
this getting published business.

1088
01:15:45,557 --> 01:15:47,650
This is from Avis, for you.

1089
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:56,223
Oh, my. Well.

1090
01:16:00,171 --> 01:16:02,105
What does she say now?

1091
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:06,638
Avis loves my sauce chapter.

1092
01:16:06,711 --> 01:16:08,770
That's wonderful, darling.

1093
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:10,341
Oh, no.

1094
01:16:11,783 --> 01:16:17,551
She showed it to someone.
Which I specifically asked her not to do.

1095
01:16:18,023 --> 01:16:22,460
She showed it to an editor
at Houghton Mifflin in Boston,

1096
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:27,487
and the Boston editor showed it
to the head of publishing and...

1097
01:16:27,565 --> 01:16:28,930
Paul! Paul!

1098
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:32,064
Yes? What, what, what? What, what?

1099
01:16:32,937 --> 01:16:34,404
They want to...

1100
01:16:35,073 --> 01:16:37,303
They want to publish our book.

1101
01:16:37,876 --> 01:16:39,741
That's great news!

1102
01:16:39,811 --> 01:16:42,279
And they want to give us an advance.

1103
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:43,541
How much?

1104
01:16:43,615 --> 01:16:47,642
- $250!
- No.

1105
01:16:47,786 --> 01:16:51,552
And when the book is finished, $500 more!

1106
01:16:51,623 --> 01:16:53,090
I'm so proud of you.

1107
01:16:53,158 --> 01:16:55,524
The editor loves the book!

1108
01:16:57,796 --> 01:17:00,230
She just loves it.

1109
01:17:04,602 --> 01:17:08,094
"So with the smell of burned stew
still in the air,

1110
01:17:08,173 --> 01:17:11,472
"I woke up dying of stomach cramps.

1111
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,033
"I called in sick."

1112
01:17:13,111 --> 01:17:15,807
And went back to bed for several hours.

1113
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:19,680
Put it in. Put it in the blog in case
someone in your office reads it.

1114
01:17:19,751 --> 01:17:23,209
And went back to bed for several hours.

1115
01:17:24,489 --> 01:17:29,051
<i>By noon, I was somehow able to</i>
<i>straighten myself up to a standing position.</i>

1116
01:17:29,127 --> 01:17:30,116
What are you making?

1117
01:17:30,195 --> 01:17:33,187
<i>Bought the ingredients for</i>
boeuf bourguignon <i>all over again.</i>

1118
01:17:33,264 --> 01:17:34,322
<i>Boeuf bourguignon.</i>

1119
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:36,162
<i>Dragged myself home.</i>

1120
01:17:37,035 --> 01:17:39,526
<i>And made another</i> boeuf bourguignon.

1121
01:17:40,905 --> 01:17:44,170
<i>And for dessert, a raspberry Bavarian cream.</i>

1122
01:17:45,677 --> 01:17:47,872
<i>By the end of the day, I felt fine.</i>

1123
01:17:47,946 --> 01:17:49,675
<i>I was cooking dinner for a legend,</i>

1124
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,649
<i>even though I'd never really heard of her</i>
<i>until a few months ago.</i>

1125
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:55,413
Maybe she'll offer you a book contract.

1126
01:17:55,553 --> 01:17:57,180
What if she does?

1127
01:17:57,655 --> 01:18:02,115
I mean, what would that mean?
That would mean I might be a writer.

1128
01:18:03,294 --> 01:18:06,092
How much money
do people make for books?

1129
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:09,594
Like an advance? I have no idea.

1130
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:12,497
- $100,000?
- Don't even say it.

1131
01:18:21,312 --> 01:18:22,472
Hello?

1132
01:18:24,182 --> 01:18:25,206
Hi.

1133
01:18:27,218 --> 01:18:31,985
I know. I know, I know.
It is here, too. Cats and dogs.

1134
01:18:34,826 --> 01:18:36,020
I know.

1135
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:37,722
I know.

1136
01:18:39,664 --> 01:18:41,097
I know.

1137
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:42,633
Well, thanks.

1138
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:44,559
Bye.

1139
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,129
So not coming.

1140
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:55,875
That was the guy
from <i>The Christian Science Monitor.</i>

1141
01:18:56,948 --> 01:18:58,540
It's raining.

1142
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:02,775
And we live in Long Island City
and she's, like, older.

1143
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:05,347
It's mortifying.

1144
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:08,688
But on the bright side, more stew for us.

1145
01:19:09,127 --> 01:19:12,688
Just for once, could you not
look on the bright side?

1146
01:19:12,764 --> 01:19:16,495
Yeah. Well, it's not the end of the world.

1147
01:19:18,236 --> 01:19:23,264
I thought, I really did think, I just did.
I thought "book contract."

1148
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:25,502
Me, Judith Jones, happily ever after.

1149
01:19:25,577 --> 01:19:27,841
And then we'd have a little money

1150
01:19:27,912 --> 01:19:31,040
and we wouldn't live over a pizzeria
for the rest of our lives.

1151
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:32,912
How am I gonna explain this?

1152
01:19:32,984 --> 01:19:37,182
My readers are gonna be really upset.
They were so into it.

1153
01:19:37,255 --> 01:19:41,783
- Your readers are gonna be really upset.
- I never should've told everyone.

1154
01:19:42,293 --> 01:19:43,521
They'll live.

1155
01:19:44,829 --> 01:19:46,160
Somehow,

1156
01:19:47,665 --> 01:19:51,066
your readers will live.

1157
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:56,169
- Is it bland?
- Not anymore.

1158
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,232
Thank you for telling me that.

1159
01:19:58,309 --> 01:20:01,972
You almost let me feed Judith Jones
bland <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

1160
01:20:02,046 --> 01:20:04,276
This is a nightmare.
I told everyone she was coming.

1161
01:20:04,349 --> 01:20:05,748
They will survive.

1162
01:20:05,817 --> 01:20:08,877
And when this year's over,
and I cannot wait until it is,

1163
01:20:08,953 --> 01:20:12,480
your readers will somehow
get on with their lives.

1164
01:20:13,091 --> 01:20:16,322
- And I won't, is that what you're saying?
- I don't know. I have no idea.

1165
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:19,056
I mean, what's gonna happen when
you're no longer the center of the universe?

1166
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,995
That's just great.

1167
01:20:21,065 --> 01:20:24,796
I am finally totally engaged in something.

1168
01:20:24,869 --> 01:20:26,837
Okay, maybe I'm being a little narcissistic.

1169
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,998
A little? On a scale of 10?

1170
01:20:29,807 --> 01:20:33,470
Okay, a 9.3. But what do you think a blog is?
It's me, me, me day after day.

1171
01:20:33,544 --> 01:20:35,205
I thought it'd be fun. How stupid is that?

1172
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,544
It just turns out to be a lot of
what you call "meltdowns,"

1173
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:38,639
but they don't feel like meltdowns.

1174
01:20:38,716 --> 01:20:41,549
They feel like I'm living with
a totally self- absorbed person

1175
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:44,087
who writes this stuff
for a bunch of complete strangers.

1176
01:20:44,155 --> 01:20:46,851
And it's supposed to be a big adventure,
but it's not.

1177
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,688
It's our life. It's our marriage.

1178
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,093
And, here, in this room, it doesn't
feel like an adventure, it feels like shit.

1179
01:20:52,163 --> 01:20:54,097
- It was your idea!
- I know, I'm so sorry.

1180
01:20:54,165 --> 01:20:57,657
What the hell was I thinking?
And I'll tell you something else.

1181
01:20:57,735 --> 01:20:59,600
I am not a saint.

1182
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:01,604
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

1183
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:03,300
- Yes, you are!
- No, I'm not!

1184
01:21:03,374 --> 01:21:07,208
And it makes me feel like an asshole
every time you say it!

1185
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:09,542
And do not write about this in your blog.

1186
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:11,878
- About what?
- About this fight!

1187
01:21:14,018 --> 01:21:15,542
I'm outta here.

1188
01:21:34,405 --> 01:21:36,965
- You all right, Julia?
- Yes, fine.

1189
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:40,010
I'm perfectly fine.

1190
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:44,944
<i>Dear Avis, we finished packing today,</i>

1191
01:21:45,016 --> 01:21:49,214
<i>and tomorrow we leave beloved Paris</i>
<i>for Marseilles.</i>

1192
01:21:49,287 --> 01:21:53,724
<i>Paul has been appointed Cultural Affairs</i>
<i>Commissioner for the South of France.</i>

1193
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:58,728
<i>I'm having a hard time pretending to be</i>
<i>anything but devastated.</i>

1194
01:21:59,063 --> 01:22:01,691
I'm going to go buy some bread.

1195
01:22:01,766 --> 01:22:06,863
<i>The advantage of Marseilles is that</i>
<i>it won't have the distractions of Paris.</i>

1196
01:22:07,972 --> 01:22:10,497
<i>So we'll be able to finish the book.</i>

1197
01:22:11,642 --> 01:22:13,269
<i>Although not on deadline.</i>

1198
01:22:15,246 --> 01:22:17,544
<i>At least we're still in France.</i>

1199
01:22:21,052 --> 01:22:25,352
<i>Dear Avis, I don't know</i>
<i>what we've done to deserve it</i>

1200
01:22:25,423 --> 01:22:27,721
<i>but here we are in Germany.</i>

1201
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:32,429
<i>Actually in a suburb of Bonn</i>
<i>called Plittersdorf on the Rhine,</i>

1202
01:22:32,497 --> 01:22:36,399
<i>which sounds much more picturesque</i>
<i>than it is.</i>

1203
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:40,433
<i>By the way, there is no chance</i>
<i>we'll meet our new deadline.</i>

1204
01:22:40,505 --> 01:22:43,941
<i>We'll be at least two more years.</i>

1205
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:48,274
<i>Meanwhile, Paul has been</i>
<i>called to Washington.</i>

1206
01:22:48,346 --> 01:22:50,314
<i>We have no idea why.</i>

1207
01:22:50,381 --> 01:22:54,340
Well, they're going to promote you, finally.
They have to.

1208
01:22:54,852 --> 01:22:59,016
Well, I don't know why they have to call me
back to Washington to tell me that.

1209
01:22:59,123 --> 01:23:01,523
They could just send a telex.
It'd be a lot cheaper.

1210
01:23:02,593 --> 01:23:04,720
Well, they're going to reassign you, then.

1211
01:23:04,796 --> 01:23:08,197
They'll ask you whether
you prefer Paris or Paris.

1212
01:23:11,469 --> 01:23:14,495
It's a possibility.
It's not likely, but it is a possibility.

1213
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:16,802
And if they are moving us back to Paris,

1214
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:20,503
I can look for an apartment
when I'm there next week.

1215
01:23:21,879 --> 01:23:23,471
Good idea, yes?

1216
01:23:24,048 --> 01:23:27,040
I promise I'll call you the minute they tell me

1217
01:23:27,118 --> 01:23:29,848
we're being transferred back to Paris,
all right?

1218
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:31,582
All right.

1219
01:23:32,423 --> 01:23:33,913
- I know, darling. I know.
- I think it could happen.

1220
01:23:33,991 --> 01:23:35,583
It could happen, I know.

1221
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:36,854
Stay right there. That's perfect.

1222
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:38,691
- Say cheese, ducky.
- Move your hand.

1223
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:40,628
- Good. Great.
- Put your legs together, darling.

1224
01:23:41,532 --> 01:23:42,897
It's very simple.

1225
01:23:42,967 --> 01:23:46,801
We're just going to tell her she should have
a smaller share of the royalties

1226
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:53,037
because it is clear she can't put in the 40
hours a week you and I are spending on it.

1227
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,409
- Sixty is more like it. Eighty.
- Exactly.

1228
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:01,510
- You and I are <i>vaches enragées.</i>
- That's exactly what we are. Mad cows.

1229
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:06,280
But I can't bring myself
to say this to Louisette.

1230
01:24:06,924 --> 01:24:10,758
- You're going to have to do it.
- I will do it. We must be cold- blooded.

1231
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:13,991
I shall love her much more
when this is settled.

1232
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,601
It isn't that you're not helping
to some extent.

1233
01:24:20,671 --> 01:24:22,298
But I am helping.

1234
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:26,670
It was my idea to add peas
to the <i>coq au vin</i> recipe.

1235
01:24:26,744 --> 01:24:29,542
We know, and that was a wonderful idea,

1236
01:24:30,214 --> 01:24:33,047
but the book has become a magnum opus.

1237
01:24:33,117 --> 01:24:35,142
But we are a team.

1238
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:39,085
We are <i>Les Trois Gourmandes.</i> One for all.

1239
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:43,719
Yes, it's absolutely true, Louisette.
Yes, it's true.

1240
01:24:43,794 --> 01:24:47,696
And you have been very valuable
to the project.

1241
01:24:47,765 --> 01:24:48,925
Thank you.

1242
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,365
But...

1243
01:24:52,303 --> 01:24:53,497
But...

1244
01:24:55,473 --> 01:24:57,464
I am getting a divorce.

1245
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:01,304
- What?
- Jean- Luc is leaving me.

1246
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:09,886
I'm so sorry. Louisette.
Just forget that I even mentioned it.

1247
01:25:10,521 --> 01:25:13,319
But it isn't fair for Louisette to get
the same amount of money that we do.

1248
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:15,825
Simca, this is not the time to discuss this.
She's getting a divorce.

1249
01:25:15,893 --> 01:25:18,020
But she doesn't do the work.

1250
01:25:19,931 --> 01:25:23,298
You don't do the work,
so your share should be 10%.

1251
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:25,567
Ten percent?

1252
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:27,995
You're not doing the work.

1253
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,672
Twenty- five.

1254
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:31,303
- Fifteen.
- Twenty.

1255
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:33,639
Eighteen and not a penny more.

1256
01:25:34,612 --> 01:25:37,274
And where it says our names,
I think it should say,

1257
01:25:37,348 --> 01:25:42,376
"By Julia Child and Simone Beck,
with Louisette Bertholle."

1258
01:25:43,287 --> 01:25:45,915
- "With"?
- And in smaller type.

1259
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,582
No, no, no, no, Simca.

1260
01:25:47,658 --> 01:25:52,527
Our names exactly the... Exactly...
And alphabetical. Alphabetical.

1261
01:25:57,101 --> 01:26:00,901
But it was not even her idea
to put the peas in the <i>coq au vin.</i>

1262
01:26:01,005 --> 01:26:04,031
- No.
- But it bothers me.

1263
01:26:07,478 --> 01:26:08,672
For me?

1264
01:26:09,113 --> 01:26:14,881
<i>Dear Avis, we've been through</i>
<i>our own version of Kafka.</i>

1265
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:18,046
<i>Paul went off to Washington,</i>
<i>and in my innocence</i>

1266
01:26:18,122 --> 01:26:21,285
<i>I thought it must be because</i>
<i>the United States government</i>

1267
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:24,556
<i>had finally realized how valuable he was.</i>

1268
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:29,026
<i>Far from it. He was being investigated.</i>

1269
01:26:30,334 --> 01:26:33,963
<i>He spent three days being grilled</i>
<i>in a windowless room</i>

1270
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:38,940
<i>with a foot- high stack of papers</i>
<i>ominously sitting on the table.</i>

1271
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:42,309
<i>They asked him about our friends,</i>
<i>our books,</i>

1272
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:44,974
<i>our China years, our patriotism.</i>

1273
01:26:45,049 --> 01:26:48,883
<i>They even asked him</i>
<i>if he was a homosexual.</i>

1274
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:51,854
- Are you a homosexual, Mr. Child?
- No.

1275
01:26:53,024 --> 01:26:54,958
I am not a homosexual.

1276
01:26:55,726 --> 01:26:57,785
This is not a joke.

1277
01:26:59,196 --> 01:27:01,096
I'm well aware of that.

1278
01:27:01,165 --> 01:27:06,296
<i>He came home exonerated</i>
<i>but thoroughly bruised.</i>

1279
01:27:06,671 --> 01:27:08,662
Julia, it was a nightmare.

1280
01:27:11,642 --> 01:27:13,507
What am I going to do?

1281
01:27:14,045 --> 01:27:17,014
I feel like my entire life has been a waste.

1282
01:27:17,915 --> 01:27:20,247
- Paul.
- I have one more posting,

1283
01:27:21,452 --> 01:27:23,750
then I'll retire and then what?

1284
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:29,755
We'll figure it out.

1285
01:27:34,298 --> 01:27:36,926
I just don't know what it was all for.

1286
01:27:38,903 --> 01:27:40,165
You know?

1287
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:45,668
You at least have the book.

1288
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,501
Well, it's your book, too.

1289
01:27:49,313 --> 01:27:50,473
It is.

1290
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,910
Without you, it wouldn't be a book.

1291
01:27:55,486 --> 01:27:58,683
Not that Simca and I'll ever be done with it.

1292
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:03,820
- Someday you'll be done with it.
- I'm beginning to wonder.

1293
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:23,512
<i>So to wrap things up,</i>

1294
01:28:23,581 --> 01:28:27,517
<i>at 6:22 last night,</i>
<i>guess who wasn't coming to dinner?</i>

1295
01:28:28,352 --> 01:28:29,614
<i>That's right.</i>

1296
01:28:29,687 --> 01:28:33,282
<i>It began pouring down rain</i>
<i>and Judith Jones canceled.</i>

1297
01:28:33,357 --> 01:28:35,222
<i>I was utterly crushed.</i>

1298
01:28:36,694 --> 01:28:37,820
<i>And then on top of everything,</i>

1299
01:28:37,895 --> 01:28:41,331
<i>I had a horrible fight with my husband</i>
<i>and he left me.</i>

1300
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,376
<i>The</i> boeuf bourguignon <i>was delicious,</i>
<i>not that I ate it.</i>

1301
01:28:59,483 --> 01:29:03,681
<i>As for the raspberry Bavarian cream,</i>
<i>I am taking it to the office.</i>

1302
01:29:10,361 --> 01:29:11,658
Morning.

1303
01:29:12,963 --> 01:29:14,726
Julie, could you come in here?

1304
01:29:14,799 --> 01:29:17,029
I didn't tell him, I swear.

1305
01:29:17,168 --> 01:29:18,328
Julie?

1306
01:29:23,874 --> 01:29:25,899
- Feeling better?
- Much.

1307
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:31,175
So you burned the stew?

1308
01:29:31,816 --> 01:29:35,479
But that's not why I didn't come to work.
I didn't come to work because I had...

1309
01:29:35,553 --> 01:29:37,384
Stomach flu.

1310
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,286
Listen, it's a free country.

1311
01:29:39,356 --> 01:29:44,453
But this little thing of yours on the Internet,
I do not want to show up in it. Okay?

1312
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:48,329
And if you don't feel like coming in to work,
let me know.

1313
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:52,665
Somebody will want this job.
We're trying to do something here.

1314
01:29:54,705 --> 01:29:56,036
I'm sorry.

1315
01:29:57,575 --> 01:29:59,634
Anyone else would fire you.

1316
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:01,837
A Republican would fire you.

1317
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,275
I'm not a schmuck.

1318
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:13,681
I'm in shock. I can't believe it.

1319
01:30:14,058 --> 01:30:18,188
You're like "The Ones." If you and Eric
can't make it work, who can?

1320
01:30:18,596 --> 01:30:23,329
All sorts of people can.
Just not me because I am a bitch.

1321
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:26,192
I am, Sarah. I'm a bitch.

1322
01:30:27,438 --> 01:30:29,338
I know. I know you are.

1323
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:32,938
By the way, Garth and I broke up.

1324
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:36,605
Oh, God, I didn't even ask.
I am a one- way street, just like Eric says.

1325
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,205
It's okay. I wasn't in love with him.

1326
01:30:39,283 --> 01:30:41,615
Do you really think I'm a bitch?

1327
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:44,486
- Well, yeah.
- I know.

1328
01:30:44,555 --> 01:30:46,045
But who isn't?

1329
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:48,751
Julia.

1330
01:30:50,861 --> 01:30:53,625
<i>I've been thinking about me and Julia.</i>

1331
01:30:53,697 --> 01:30:57,428
<i>She was a secretary</i>
<i>for a government agency and I am, too.</i>

1332
01:30:57,501 --> 01:31:01,870
<i>A really nice guy married her.</i>
<i>A really nice guy married me.</i>

1333
01:31:02,773 --> 01:31:04,331
<i>Both of us were lost</i>

1334
01:31:04,408 --> 01:31:07,900
<i>and both of us were saved</i>
<i>by food in some way or other.</i>

1335
01:31:07,978 --> 01:31:13,348
<i>So major overlaps.</i>
<i>But let's face it, I am not Julia Child.</i>

1336
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:18,214
<i>Julia Child never lost her temper</i>
<i>just because something boiled over,</i>

1337
01:31:18,289 --> 01:31:21,986
<i>or collapsed in the oven,</i>
<i>or just plain fell through.</i>

1338
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:26,518
<i>And she was never horrible to her husband,</i>
<i>I'm sure.</i>

1339
01:31:26,597 --> 01:31:29,031
<i>And she never behaved like,</i>
<i>"Who has time to be married?"</i>

1340
01:31:29,099 --> 01:31:32,591
<i>Which is how I behave sometimes,</i>
<i>I'm sorry to say.</i>

1341
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:37,004
<i>I wish I were more like her.</i>
<i>She deserved her husband and I don't.</i>

1342
01:31:37,074 --> 01:31:38,701
<i>That's the truth.</i>

1343
01:31:39,176 --> 01:31:41,940
<i>Well, anyway, that's the truth for now.</i>

1344
01:31:42,012 --> 01:31:43,502
<i>Yogurt for dinner.</i>

1345
01:32:08,072 --> 01:32:12,475
<i>Hi, you've reached Eric Powell at</i>
Archaeology <i>magazine. Leave a message.</i>

1346
01:32:13,544 --> 01:32:16,274
<i>I hated sleeping without you last night.</i>

1347
01:32:17,081 --> 01:32:18,673
Where are you?

1348
01:32:19,016 --> 01:32:20,381
I miss you.

1349
01:32:51,882 --> 01:32:54,908
- Hello?
<i>- Honey, is something wrong?</i>

1350
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:57,177
No.

1351
01:32:58,188 --> 01:33:00,179
Why would you think that?

1352
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:02,815
<i>Are you and Eric</i>
<i>having some kind of problem?</i>

1353
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,088
Of course not.

1354
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:07,028
<i>- Is he there and you can't talk?</i>
- He's not here.

1355
01:33:07,097 --> 01:33:11,056
<i>I just read your blog, and it was strange</i>
<i>and uncharacteristically thoughtful.</i>

1356
01:33:11,135 --> 01:33:12,864
<i>- Where is he?</i>
- Out.

1357
01:33:14,104 --> 01:33:16,095
He went out to get pizza.

1358
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,331
<i>Have you stopped cooking?</i>

1359
01:33:18,909 --> 01:33:22,538
Just temporarily.
Just taking a little break from cooking.

1360
01:33:22,746 --> 01:33:23,940
<i>Well, get back to it.</i>

1361
01:33:24,014 --> 01:33:27,643
<i>It's gonna be good for you to finish</i>
<i>something for once in your life.</i>

1362
01:33:27,718 --> 01:33:30,653
<i>- Julia didn't give up.</i>
- Who says I'm giving up?

1363
01:33:30,721 --> 01:33:33,417
<i>Well, I'm just saying don't.</i>

1364
01:34:21,872 --> 01:34:22,964
Hey.

1365
01:34:25,642 --> 01:34:27,109
Are you back?

1366
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:29,102
Please be back.

1367
01:34:31,181 --> 01:34:32,842
What's for dinner?

1368
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:54,000
Well, Avis said she'd be here.
Even if we were late.

1369
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:56,596
Well, if she's not here, we can take a taxi.

1370
01:34:56,673 --> 01:34:58,834
They probably have taxis in Boston.

1371
01:34:58,942 --> 01:35:02,776
She'll be here. Wearing a plaid jacket.

1372
01:35:03,714 --> 01:35:06,182
That's how I'm to recognize her.

1373
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:10,077
What do you mean, "recognize her"?
Has she changed?

1374
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:14,718
Well...

1375
01:35:15,626 --> 01:35:20,154
"Look for the middle- aged woman
in a plaid jacket."

1376
01:35:21,031 --> 01:35:23,363
- So...
- You and Avis have never met?

1377
01:35:23,433 --> 01:35:25,196
We're just pen pals.

1378
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:27,566
You don't know each other?

1379
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:29,697
Well, we do. We write.

1380
01:35:29,773 --> 01:35:32,571
But how did you start writing one another?

1381
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:37,371
That's a long story.

1382
01:35:38,215 --> 01:35:43,653
Avis' husband, Bernard De Voto, now dead,
was a wonderful, wonderful writer.

1383
01:35:44,254 --> 01:35:49,317
He wrote an article in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>
all about stainless steel knives

1384
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:53,728
- and how he absolutely detested them.
- Yes.

1385
01:35:53,797 --> 01:35:59,793
And so I wrote him a fan letter
because he was 100% right

1386
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:02,370
and Avis wrote me back.

1387
01:36:02,806 --> 01:36:05,832
And so I wrote her back.
And she wrote me back.

1388
01:36:07,077 --> 01:36:10,478
Well, it's been eight years, I think.

1389
01:36:22,025 --> 01:36:24,459
- Avis.
- Julia.

1390
01:36:27,931 --> 01:36:31,264
- My darling friend.
- Look at you.

1391
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:37,207
Brilliant friend. Bless you.

1392
01:36:37,808 --> 01:36:43,474
This is a very impressive undertaking,
Mrs. Child and Mrs. Beck.

1393
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:45,879
Well, thank you very, very much.

1394
01:36:46,116 --> 01:36:48,516
And your editor loves it.

1395
01:36:48,952 --> 01:36:51,147
I do. I think it's brilliant.

1396
01:36:51,822 --> 01:36:54,791
There's really nothing else like it
on the market.

1397
01:36:54,858 --> 01:36:59,852
- The problem is not just the length.
- It's 700 pages.

1398
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:04,792
- Yes, we know. It is long.
- Yes, we know it's long.

1399
01:37:04,868 --> 01:37:10,306
You have 700 pages
of just sauce and poultry recipes.

1400
01:37:11,108 --> 01:37:15,477
We were thinking that you could publish it
in a series of volumes.

1401
01:37:15,545 --> 01:37:17,604
Volume One, Sauces.

1402
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:19,979
- Volume Two...
- Poultry.

1403
01:37:21,018 --> 01:37:22,076
Yes.

1404
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:29,216
Volume Three, Fish.
Meat, vegetables, and desserts.

1405
01:37:29,293 --> 01:37:32,558
That's one, two, three... That's six volumes.

1406
01:37:33,297 --> 01:37:34,423
Eggs.

1407
01:37:35,132 --> 01:37:38,568
- Eggs.
- Eggs. Seven. Seven volumes.

1408
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:42,263
But we don't want to publish
an encyclopedia.

1409
01:37:42,339 --> 01:37:44,671
I thought this was intended for housewives.

1410
01:37:44,741 --> 01:37:49,178
Yes, housewives want something quick,
with a mix.

1411
01:37:50,213 --> 01:37:51,373
Like this.

1412
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:56,346
But if I may speak for everyone,

1413
01:37:56,420 --> 01:38:01,016
if you were willing to revise it,
I'm sure we would all be interested.

1414
01:38:04,594 --> 01:38:08,155
Simca, I am so sorry.

1415
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:11,400
You just picked the wrong collaborator.

1416
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:16,303
Yes, I should have worked with this woman,
"Baked Alaska in a Flower Pot."

1417
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:22,273
We'll just take the book away from
Houghton Mifflin and find another publisher.

1418
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:27,713
We have just begun to fight.
Julia, your book is a masterpiece.

1419
01:38:27,784 --> 01:38:29,775
What is Marshmallow Fluff?

1420
01:38:29,853 --> 01:38:35,758
And keep the advance, by the way.
Keep the entire $250.

1421
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:37,794
Don't give them back a penny of it.

1422
01:38:37,861 --> 01:38:43,697
Why did we ever decide to do this anyway?
What were we thinking?

1423
01:38:43,767 --> 01:38:45,394
Who can remember?

1424
01:38:46,703 --> 01:38:47,863
I can.

1425
01:38:49,306 --> 01:38:54,573
We wanted to write a French cookbook
for American women who do not have cooks.

1426
01:38:54,644 --> 01:39:00,514
So then, that's what we'll do.
We'll just do it all over again.

1427
01:39:01,551 --> 01:39:03,883
And that's that. It'll be easy.

1428
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:11,052
It will. The dessert section is done.
Thanks to Simca, it is brilliant.

1429
01:39:11,962 --> 01:39:13,293
Thank you.

1430
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:16,292
I just haven't typed it up yet.

1431
01:39:16,366 --> 01:39:20,894
But that will give me something to do
in Oslo.

1432
01:39:52,102 --> 01:39:56,061
Eric, come see
the world's most beautiful chicken.

1433
01:40:07,584 --> 01:40:08,812
Naughty.

1434
01:40:15,025 --> 01:40:16,083
Wow.

1435
01:40:17,861 --> 01:40:19,260
Oh, my God.

1436
01:40:22,566 --> 01:40:25,501
It feels so good. No, I'm serious. I love it!

1437
01:40:26,903 --> 01:40:29,736
I just want to savor this moment.

1438
01:40:30,173 --> 01:40:32,164
The moment when anything is possible.

1439
01:40:32,242 --> 01:40:37,179
The moment that you can just imagine
they're going to love everything you did

1440
01:40:37,247 --> 01:40:42,150
and it's going to sell a million copies
and change the world.

1441
01:40:43,086 --> 01:40:46,954
Yes. But I think
it calls for a great bottle of wine.

1442
01:40:47,023 --> 01:40:48,786
- Don't you think?
- Yes.

1443
01:40:48,859 --> 01:40:50,520
What's for dinner?

1444
01:40:54,931 --> 01:40:56,796
What if she doesn't eat pork?

1445
01:40:56,867 --> 01:41:01,463
She's a food writer. Of course she eats pork.
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

1446
01:41:01,571 --> 01:41:04,540
You're right. I know you're right.
I'm sure you're right.

1447
01:41:05,308 --> 01:41:07,139
- Is she early?
- She's right on time.

1448
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:08,700
- I'll finish, I'll finish.
- Thank you, thank you.

1449
01:41:08,778 --> 01:41:12,805
You are a terrible human being.
And very difficult to live with.

1450
01:41:14,417 --> 01:41:15,509
Who is it?

1451
01:41:15,585 --> 01:41:17,678
<i>Amanda Hesser from</i> The New York Times.

1452
01:41:18,588 --> 01:41:19,816
Come in.

1453
01:41:24,995 --> 01:41:27,520
You have such a sense of Julia
when you do something like this,

1454
01:41:27,597 --> 01:41:29,656
as a teacher, as a voice.

1455
01:41:29,733 --> 01:41:32,964
I have conversations with her
while I'm cooking.

1456
01:41:33,036 --> 01:41:36,528
And I feel like she is there with me
in the kitchen.

1457
01:41:36,606 --> 01:41:38,471
She's like your imaginary friend.

1458
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:39,600
Yes.

1459
01:41:40,644 --> 01:41:42,805
And, of course,
she is the person I write for every day.

1460
01:41:42,879 --> 01:41:45,541
Although, I don't think she ever reads it.
I don't know.

1461
01:41:45,615 --> 01:41:47,480
I'm dying to meet her.

1462
01:41:47,617 --> 01:41:51,644
I would like to be a bridesmaid
in her wedding in 1946.

1463
01:41:52,722 --> 01:41:56,715
I realize that that would take
an inexplicable episode of time travel,

1464
01:41:56,793 --> 01:41:59,660
but that is the sort of thing
that I think about.

1465
01:41:59,763 --> 01:42:02,197
We're planning a pilgrimage
to Julia's Cambridge kitchen

1466
01:42:02,232 --> 01:42:04,496
in the Smithsonian museum
when this is over.

1467
01:42:04,568 --> 01:42:09,267
But first, I have to finish.
I have 15 days and 24 recipes,

1468
01:42:10,273 --> 01:42:12,707
and I still have to bone a duck.

1469
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:20,547
I read somewhere that it was bad form
to say "yum" while you're eating, but "yum."

1470
01:42:44,507 --> 01:42:48,739
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,
this is Julie Powell. Please hold.

1471
01:42:48,812 --> 01:42:51,940
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,
this is Julie Powell. Can you hold?

1472
01:42:52,015 --> 01:42:53,312
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Great.

1473
01:42:53,383 --> 01:42:55,681
- Lower Manhattan Development...
<i>- Julie, it's Sarah.</i>

1474
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:57,617
The New York Times. <i>I can't believe it!</i>

1475
01:42:57,687 --> 01:43:00,815
I know. I know, I know, I know, I know.
Can I call you back?

1476
01:43:00,924 --> 01:43:02,653
I have to call you back. Hold on.

1477
01:43:02,692 --> 01:43:05,024
Hello, this is Julie Powell.
How can I help you?

1478
01:43:07,497 --> 01:43:09,488
- Hi.
- Hey.

1479
01:43:10,867 --> 01:43:13,734
Guess what? Messages on machine?

1480
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:16,538
Sixty- five.

1481
01:43:16,973 --> 01:43:19,339
- Sixty- five?
- Sixty- five.

1482
01:43:24,381 --> 01:43:28,408
<i>If this is the Julie Powell in this morning's</i>
New York Times, <i>this is Judy Clain.</i>

1483
01:43:28,485 --> 01:43:30,919
<i>I'm an editor at Little Brown</i>
<i>and I wanted to talk to you about</i>

1484

Thank you, God.

Gimlets.

1513
01:45:00,944 --> 01:45:02,434

<i>- Hi, this is Julie.</i>

<i>And other stuff, so leave a message.</i>

1517
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,346

- I just make them stronger.

1518
01:45:13,423 --> 01:45:15,755
<i>Hi, it's Barry Ryan</i>
<i>from the</i> Santa Barbara News- Press,

1519
01:45:15,825 --> 01:45:19,022
<i>and I'm writing an article about</i>
<i>Julia Child's 90th birthday</i>

1520
01:45:19,095 --> 01:45:20,892
<i>and I asked her about your blog,</i>

1521
01:45:20,964 --> 01:45:26,027
<i>and, frankly, she was kind of a pill about it</i>
<i>so I thought maybe you'd want to comment.</i>

1522
01:45:26,803 --> 01:45:27,963
Hello?

1523
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:29,770
Yes, it is.

1524
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:35,233
She said that?

1525
01:45:36,579 --> 01:45:38,479
Julia Child said that?

1526
01:45:42,652 --> 01:45:44,449
Has she read my blog?

1527
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:51,450
No, I don't really wanna comment.

1528
01:45:52,695 --> 01:45:54,720
But thank you for calling.

1529
01:45:59,536 --> 01:46:01,060
Julia hates me.

1530
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:07,535
Jule?

1531
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,747
They hate us.

1532
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:13,507
Who?

1533
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:15,977
Houghton Mifflin.

1534
01:46:28,398 --> 01:46:31,663
- They don't hate you.
- They do. They absolutely do.

1535
01:46:32,969 --> 01:46:35,164
No, they say the book is good.

1536
01:46:35,238 --> 01:46:37,206
But they don't want to publish it.

1537
01:46:37,273 --> 01:46:41,642
Well, they think it's too expensive.
They think it's "economically prohibitive."

1538
01:46:41,711 --> 01:46:47,980
Eight years of our lives
just turned out to be something for me to do

1539
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:52,019
so I wouldn't have nothing to do.

1540
01:46:53,456 --> 01:46:54,718
Oh, well.

1541
01:46:55,425 --> 01:46:56,653
Boo- hoo.

1542
01:46:58,928 --> 01:47:00,190
Now what?

1543
01:47:03,066 --> 01:47:04,658
- You're a teacher.
- Yeah.

1544
01:47:04,734 --> 01:47:06,224
You can teach.

1545
01:47:07,437 --> 01:47:09,530
Right? We'll go home and...

1546
01:47:10,373 --> 01:47:11,840
Where's home?

1547
01:47:12,542 --> 01:47:14,169
Where do we live?

1548
01:47:18,815 --> 01:47:21,648
- Home is wherever we are.
- Yeah.

1549
01:47:22,151 --> 01:47:26,247
All right?
And we'll work it out. We'll figure it out.

1550
01:47:27,457 --> 01:47:29,823
- You can teach in our kitchen.
- True.

1551
01:47:29,893 --> 01:47:31,554
You can teach on television.

1552
01:47:35,164 --> 01:47:36,529
Television?

1553
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:38,197
- Me?
- Yes.

1554
01:47:38,935 --> 01:47:39,959
- Paul.
- No, Julia.

1555
01:47:40,036 --> 01:47:43,733
I think you would be excellent on television.
I do.

1556
01:47:44,574 --> 01:47:46,064
- Paul!
- I do. I do.

1557
01:47:46,142 --> 01:47:47,302
Don't...

1558
01:47:47,844 --> 01:47:50,039
I'm not kidding you. I'm not.

1559
01:47:51,614 --> 01:47:53,878
Someone is going to publish your book.

1560
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:57,852
Someone is going to read your book
and realize what you've done.

1561
01:47:57,921 --> 01:48:00,082
Because your book is amazing.

1562
01:48:00,189 --> 01:48:02,987
Your book is a work of genius.

1563
01:48:03,526 --> 01:48:06,654
Your book is going to change the world.

1564
01:48:09,499 --> 01:48:10,761
Do you hear me?

1565
01:48:13,002 --> 01:48:15,232
You are so sweet.

1566
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:18,601
You are

1567
01:48:19,842 --> 01:48:21,469
the sweetest man.

1568
01:48:26,249 --> 01:48:27,375
Fuck them.

1569
01:48:32,789 --> 01:48:35,519
Judith, would you take a look at this?

1570
01:48:35,592 --> 01:48:37,958
Our intrepid literary scout, Avis De Voto,

1571
01:48:38,027 --> 01:48:41,588
is friends with some woman
who's written a huge French cookbook.

1572
01:48:41,664 --> 01:48:44,258
Houghton Mifflin just turned it down.

1573
01:48:44,901 --> 01:48:48,837
<i>"French Recipes for American Cooks."</i>
Terrible title.

1574
01:48:49,272 --> 01:48:50,899
Have fun, Judith.

1575
01:49:24,907 --> 01:49:25,965
Yum.

1576
01:49:34,984 --> 01:49:36,042
Yum.

1577
01:49:37,954 --> 01:49:39,148
Oh, my.

1578
01:49:47,997 --> 01:49:51,262
- Here it is. Of course.
- What...

1579
01:49:52,035 --> 01:49:54,868
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

1580
01:49:59,075 --> 01:50:01,100
Special delivery for Mrs. Julia Child.

1581
01:50:01,177 --> 01:50:02,474
Chilly!

1582
01:50:05,381 --> 01:50:06,905
There you are.

1583
01:50:33,976 --> 01:50:35,603
<i>Dear Mrs. Child,</i>

1584
01:50:35,678 --> 01:50:38,203
<i>we have read your superb French cookbook,</i>

1585
01:50:38,281 --> 01:50:42,047
<i>studying it, cooking from it,</i>
<i>estimating, and so on.</i>

1586
01:50:42,118 --> 01:50:44,951
<i>And we have come to the conclusion</i>
<i>that it is a unique book</i>

1587
01:50:45,021 --> 01:50:47,353
<i>that we would be very proud to publish.</i>

1588
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:49,455
Paul! Paul!

1589
01:50:49,525 --> 01:50:51,720
What? What, what, what, what?

1590
01:50:52,595 --> 01:50:53,755
Knopf...

1591
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:56,655
Knopf wants to publish our book.

1592
01:50:56,733 --> 01:50:58,724
Is it "K- nopf" or "Nopf"?

1593
01:50:59,268 --> 01:51:01,133
- Who cares?
- Who cares?

1594
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:05,673
They want to offer us an advance of $1,500.

1595
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:07,107
Oh, my God.

1596
01:51:08,211 --> 01:51:13,171
"We believe that your book will do
for French cooking in America

1597
01:51:13,249 --> 01:51:17,208
"what Rombauer's the <i>Joy of Cooking</i> did
for standard cooking.

1598
01:51:17,286 --> 01:51:19,686
"And we will sell it that way."

1599
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:21,087
Julia!

1600
01:51:22,558 --> 01:51:25,322
<i>When we meet,</i>
<i>which I hope will be very soon,</i>

1601
01:51:25,394 --> 01:51:28,852
<i>I especially wanna talk to you</i>
<i>about the title of the book.</i>

1602
01:51:28,931 --> 01:51:32,492
<i>Because it is of the utmost importance</i>
<i>that the title distinguish this book</i>

1603
01:51:32,568 --> 01:51:35,162
<i>from all the other cookbooks on the market.</i>

1604
01:51:36,672 --> 01:51:40,836
- Is this the way you normally do this?
- Absolutely not.

1605
01:51:47,483 --> 01:51:50,714
<i>"Mastering the Art of French Cooking."</i>

1606
01:51:53,589 --> 01:51:54,647
What do you think?

1607
01:51:54,724 --> 01:51:59,752
Well, at this point,
I have no idea whatsoever.

1608
01:51:59,862 --> 01:52:02,956
- Julia, that won't do.
- All right, then.

1609
01:52:04,066 --> 01:52:05,658
I love it.

1610
01:52:07,236 --> 01:52:10,831
She said "hate"?
Julia Child used the word "hate"?

1611
01:52:11,908 --> 01:52:12,932
No.

1612
01:52:13,609 --> 01:52:17,943
But she said I wasn't respectful,
or serious, or something.

1613
01:52:18,014 --> 01:52:20,744
How much more serious could a person be?

1614
01:52:21,551 --> 01:52:25,351
Do you think
she thinks I'm sort of using her?

1615
01:52:25,988 --> 01:52:28,218
She can't have read your blog.

1616
01:52:28,291 --> 01:52:29,883
Did she read it?

1617
01:52:30,092 --> 01:52:32,253
He didn't know if she'd read it.

1618
01:52:32,328 --> 01:52:35,195
But she definitely had an opinion about it.

1619
01:52:35,264 --> 01:52:39,030
Do you think it's because I use
the "F" word every so often?

1620
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:41,899
Could be. Who knows?

1621
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:46,434
Look, there's something wrong with her
if she doesn't get what you're doing.

1622
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:48,306
There is nothing wrong with her. Nothing.

1623
01:52:48,377 --> 01:52:50,675
I've spent a year with her. She's perfect.

1624
01:52:50,746 --> 01:52:53,078
The Julia Child in your head is perfect,

1625
01:52:53,149 --> 01:52:56,744
the Julia Child that doesn't understand
what you're doing is not perfect.

1626
01:52:56,819 --> 01:52:59,754
The one in your head is the one that matters.

1627
01:53:02,358 --> 01:53:04,258
I'm never gonna meet her.

1628
01:53:05,494 --> 01:53:07,485
But you already know her.

1629
01:53:09,365 --> 01:53:12,630
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Anytime.

1630
01:53:14,203 --> 01:53:17,195
- She saved me.
- You saved yourself.

1631
01:53:17,506 --> 01:53:20,964
I was drowning
and she pulled me out of the ocean.

1632
01:53:21,043 --> 01:53:22,943
Don't get carried away.

1633
01:53:25,915 --> 01:53:27,610
<i>Julia Child began learning to cook</i>

1634
01:53:27,683 --> 01:53:30,311
<i>because she loved her husband,</i>
<i>and she loved food,</i>

1635
01:53:30,386 --> 01:53:32,217
<i>and she didn't know</i>
<i>what else to do with herself.</i>

1636
01:53:32,288 --> 01:53:35,348
<i>And, in the process, she found joy.</i>

1637
01:53:35,424 --> 01:53:38,791
<i>I didn't understand this for a long time,</i>
<i>but I do now.</i>

1638
01:53:38,861 --> 01:53:40,795
<i>Julia taught me that.</i>

1639
01:53:40,863 --> 01:53:43,559
<i>But here's what Julia really taught me.</i>

1640
01:53:46,969 --> 01:53:47,993
<i>So here we are.</i>

1641
01:53:48,537 --> 01:53:50,732
<i>One day to go and one recipe.</i>

1642
01:53:53,242 --> 01:53:58,009
<i>You may think that boning a duck</i>
<i>is an impossible feat.</i>

1643
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,173
<i>- And the whole procedure...</i>
- Nothing is impossible.

1644
01:54:00,283 --> 01:54:04,845
<i>... can take as long as 45 minutes</i>
<i>the first time because of fear.</i>

1645
01:54:05,655 --> 01:54:07,247
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

1646
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:09,624
No fear, Julia. No fear.

1647
01:54:09,692 --> 01:54:12,661
<i>Take your knife, confront the duck.</i>

1648
01:54:12,728 --> 01:54:15,094
Confronting the duck. You're my duck.

1649
01:54:15,164 --> 01:54:19,396
<i>You make a deep slit</i>
<i>down the back of the bird</i>

1650
01:54:20,269 --> 01:54:25,639
<i>all the way from the neck down to the tail</i>
<i>to expose the backbone.</i>

1651
01:54:25,808 --> 01:54:30,268
<i>And with a small, sharp knife,</i>
<i>its edge always cutting against the bone...</i>

1652
01:54:30,346 --> 01:54:34,009
I did it. Look at that, Julia.
It looks just like yours.

1653
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:38,819
<i>... down one side of the bird...</i>
<i>... pulling the flesh.</i>

1654
01:54:38,888 --> 01:54:43,416
<i>Thread the boned duck on a board,</i>
<i>face skin side down.</i>

1655
01:54:43,492 --> 01:54:46,154
<i>... patting it into place. Roll out the dough.</i>

1656
01:54:46,228 --> 01:54:51,495
<i>... two hours and remove it from the oven</i>
<i>and let it cool for several hours.</i>

1657
01:54:51,567 --> 01:54:54,661
It looks exactly the way
it's supposed to look.

1658
01:54:55,938 --> 01:54:58,133
Here you go. Can you grab the plates, too?

1659
01:54:58,207 --> 01:55:00,402
- You sure?
- I got it.

1660
01:55:02,511 --> 01:55:03,808
Coming around.

1661
01:55:06,349 --> 01:55:08,112
Here she comes. Wow!

1662
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,682
Thank you. <i>La pièce de résistance.</i>

1663
01:55:13,756 --> 01:55:18,386
365 days. 524 recipes.

1664
01:55:22,431 --> 01:55:24,991
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, guys.

1665
01:55:26,569 --> 01:55:29,333
Babe. It's fantastic.

1666
01:55:30,206 --> 01:55:31,468
So great.

1667
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:34,699
I love it. I love it.

1668
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:41,541
Eric, I could never have done this
without you.

1669
01:55:42,585 --> 01:55:44,280
As someone once said,

1670
01:55:44,353 --> 01:55:47,880
you are the butter to my bread,
the breath to my life.

1671
01:55:50,059 --> 01:55:51,549
To my husband.

1672
01:55:52,995 --> 01:55:54,587
I love you, babe.

1673
01:55:55,631 --> 01:55:56,859
Thank you.

1674
01:55:56,932 --> 01:55:58,399
<i>So it's over.</i>

1675
01:55:59,201 --> 01:56:04,002
<i>The project has come to a close.</i>
<i>We're back exactly where we started,</i>

1676
01:56:04,073 --> 01:56:07,440
<i>Eric, me, the cat, slightly worse for wear,</i>

1677
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:10,411
<i>sitting in the outer boroughs, eating.</i>

1678
01:56:11,013 --> 01:56:12,810
<i>So thanks, everybody.</i>

1679
01:56:13,149 --> 01:56:14,673
<i>And guess what?</i>

1680
01:56:15,418 --> 01:56:17,249
Bon appétit.

1681
01:56:30,666 --> 01:56:34,432
See how the counters are raised?
She had them made special.

1682
01:56:37,706 --> 01:56:40,300
There's her famous mortar and pestle.

1683
01:56:41,377 --> 01:56:42,867
If you say so.

1684
01:56:43,546 --> 01:56:45,309
- Perfect.
- Take my picture.

1685
01:56:46,782 --> 01:56:47,874
Okay.

1686
01:56:49,952 --> 01:56:52,648
That's nice. Give me something else.

1687
01:56:52,721 --> 01:56:54,916
Here we go. Talking to her.

1688
01:56:55,057 --> 01:56:56,649
That's good.

1689
01:56:57,393 --> 01:56:58,553
One more.

1690
01:56:58,661 --> 01:56:59,855
Very sweet.

1691
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:03,655
That's it. That's the one.

1692
01:57:04,433 --> 01:57:05,957
That's the one.

1693
01:57:07,203 --> 01:57:08,636
Just give me a second.

1694
01:57:25,821 --> 01:57:27,516
I love you, Julia.

1695
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:25,169
There you are!

1696
01:58:27,116 --> 01:58:29,084
That smells good. What are we having?

1697
01:58:29,151 --> 01:58:31,244
<i>Navarin d'agneau.</i>

1698
01:58:38,627 --> 01:58:40,288
Something for you.

1699
01:59:28,715 --> 01:59:38,715
THE END
