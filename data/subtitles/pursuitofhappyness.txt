1
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,309
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,830
All right, Dad.
Come on.

3
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,350
Should be here soon.

4
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,035
<i>♪ Go marching in ♪</i>

5
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:54,754
<i>♪ Oh, when the saints
Go marching... ♪</i>

6
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,750
I think I should make a list.
Uh, what do mean?

7
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:43,352
For your birthday gifts?
Yeah.

8
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:46,105
Well, you know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

9
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:47,157
Yeah, I know.

10
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,942
Just to look at and study,

11
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,343
so I can choose better.

12
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:53,813
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

13
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:55,881
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

14
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:57,467
I think so.

15
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,635
All right.
That's good.

16
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:05,458
How you doing in here, man?

17
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,459
Okay.

18
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,534
Can we go to the park today?

19
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:16,569
After?

20
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,805
Um. No, I gotta
go to Oakland.

21
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:21,040
Well, uh...
maybe. We'll see.

22
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,359
Give me a kiss.

23
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:25,161
I'll talk to you later.

24
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:29,949
Excuse me.

25
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,169
Oh. Excuse me, uh...

26
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:35,621
when is, uh, somebody
gonna clean this off?

27
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:39,425
And... And...
And the Y?

28
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:41,211
The Y. We talked
about this.

29
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,762
It's an I in "happiness."

30
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,563
There's no Y in "happiness."
It's an I.

31
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:49,152
<i>I'm Chris Gardner.</i>

32
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:50,937
<i>I met my father
for the first time</i>

33
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:53,072
<i>when I was 28 years old.</i>

34
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:54,957
<i>And I made up my mind
as a young kid</i>

35
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,693
<i>that when I had children,</i>

36
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,862
<i>my children were gonna know
who their father was.</i>

37
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,916
<i>This is part of my life story.</i>

38
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,437
<i>This part is called...</i>

39
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,389
<i>"Riding the Bus."</i>

40
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:16,379
What's that?

41
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:20,033
It's a time machine, isn't it?

42
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,435
Seems like a time machine.

43
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:23,970
That seems like a time machine.

44
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:25,721
It's a time machine.
Take me with you.

45
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:27,440
<i>This machine...</i>

46
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,825
<i>This machine on my lap...</i>

47
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,993
This guy, he has a time machine.

48
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,179
He... He... He travels.
He travels in the past

49
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:34,263
with this machine and...

50
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,699
<i>it is not a time machine.</i>

51
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:40,120
<i>It's a portable
bone-density scanner.</i>

52
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:43,506
<i>A medical device
I sell for a living.</i>

53
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:46,342
Thank you for the opportunity
to... To discuss it with you.

54
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,345
I appreciate it.
We just don't need it, Chris.

55
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,313
It's unnecessary.
And expensive.

56
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,730
Well, maybe next...
Thank you.

57
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:57,269
<i>It gave a slightly denser
picture than an x-ray...</i>

58
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,788
<i>for twice the money.</i>

59
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:03,426
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

60
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,294
What happened?
Uh... No, nothing.

61
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:07,314
Look, I can't get
Christopher today.

62
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:08,715
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I need...

63
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:09,799
I'm back on at 7.

64
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,952
I know. I have got
to go to Oakland.

65
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,686
So I gotta
get Christopher home,

66
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,104
feed him, bathe him,

67
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:18,742
get him in bed, and be back here by 7?
Yes.

68
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,226
And we got
the tax bill notice today.

69
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:21,744
What are you gonna do
about that?

70
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,063
Look. This is what
we gotta do.

71
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:29,519
<i>You see that car?</i>

72
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:32,472
<i>The one with the pretty
yellow shoe on it?</i>

73
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,057
<i>That's mine.</i>

74
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,225
<i>There's no parking
near hospitals.</i>

75
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:39,062
<i>That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.</i>

76
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,047
Thanks anyway.
Uh, very much.

77
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:42,915
Uh... Uh, maybe next quarter.
It's possible.

78
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,787
<i>I needed to sell at least
two scanners a month</i>

79
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:51,240
<i>for rent and daycare.</i>

80
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:52,825
<i>I'd have to sell one more</i>

81
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:56,379
<i>to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.</i>

82
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:05,238
<i>The problem is...</i>

83
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,057
<i>I haven't sold any for a while.</i>

84
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,362
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

85
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,198
Since birth?

86
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:20,603
What's that?
What?

87
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,405
What is this?

88
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:23,889
It's a gift for Christopher.

89
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:26,592
From who?
Cynthia from work.

90
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:28,177
It's for adults.
Chris can't use it.

91
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:29,913
She didn't know.

92
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,047
What are you supposed to

93
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:32,615
do with it?

94
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,452
Make every side the same color.

95
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,254
Did you pay the taxes?

96
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:42,375
No, I'm gonna have to,
uh, file an extension.

97
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:45,361
You already filed an extension.

98
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:48,030
Yeah, well, I gotta
file another one.

99
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,582
That's...
It's $650.

100
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,900
I'll have it in the next month.

101
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,270
That means interest, right?

102
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,839
And a penalty?
Yeah, a little bit.

103
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,275
Look, why don't you
let me do this?

104
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:02,679
All right, just relax.
Okay?

105
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:04,447
Now, come here.
Calm down.

106
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,183
I have to go back to work.

107
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,142
Let's get ready for bed.

108
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:19,212
Hey, uh, put your plate
in the sink.

109
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:22,332
<i>A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for.</i>

110
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,634
<i>A comprehensive audit,
if you will,</i>

111
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,735
<i>of our economic condition.</i>

112
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:29,688
<i>You won't like it.
I didn't like it.</i>

113
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,540
<i>But we have to face the truth</i>

114
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,377
<i>and then go to work
to turn things around.</i>

115
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,211
<i>And make no mistake about it...</i>

116
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:38,380
<i>we can turn them around.</i>

117
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:41,634
<i>The federal budget
is out of control.</i>

118
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:45,221
<i>And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion</i>

119
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,639
<i>for this budget year</i>

120
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,858
<i>that ends September 30th.</i>

121
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,476
<i>That deficit is larger</i>

122
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:53,145
<i>than the entire
federal budget in 1957.</i>

123
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,066
<i>And so is the almost
$80 billion</i>

124
00:08:57,068 --> 00:09:02,004
<i>we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.</i>

125
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:04,741
<i>Twenty years ago, in 1960,</i>

126
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,359
<i>our federal government payroll</i>

127
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,843
<i>was less than $13 billion.</i>

128
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:12,014
<i>Today it is 75 billion.</i>

129
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,283
<i>During these 20 years,
our population</i>

130
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:18,087
<i>has only increased
by 23.3 percent...</i>

131
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:36,940
Woo! Man.

132
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,725
I got two questions for you:

133
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:40,860
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

134
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:44,614
I'm a stockbroker.

135
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,665
Stockbroker.
Oh, goodness.

136
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,835
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

137
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,052
You don't have to.

138
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:51,403
Had to be good with numbers

139
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:52,956
and good with people.

140
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,357
That's it.
Hey, you take care.

141
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,677
Hey. I'm gonna let you hang on
to my car for the weekend.

142
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,046
But I need it back for Monday.
Feed the meter.

143
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,788
<i>I still remember that moment.</i>

144
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:16,613
<i>They all looked so...</i>

145
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,747
<i>damn happy to me.</i>

146
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,341
<i>Why couldn't I look like that?</i>

147
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:47,376
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

148
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:50,730
I'm, uh, gonna stop by
a brokerage firm after work.

149
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:51,747
For what?

150
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:54,183
I wanna see about a job there.

151
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:55,935
Yeah? What job?

152
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,555
Uh, you know, when I...

153
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:01,173
When I was a kid,
I could go through a...

154
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,491
A math book in a week.

155
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:03,993
So I'm gonna go see about, uh,

156
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,644
a job they got down there.

157
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:06,829
Oh.

158
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,348
What job?

159
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,319
Stockbroker.

160
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,539
Stockbroker?

161
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,425
Yeah.

162
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,361
Not an astronaut?

163
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,062
Don't talk to me
like that, Linda.

164
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:42,882
I'm gonna go down
to see about this,

165
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:45,101
and I'm gonna do it during the day.
Mm-hm.

166
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:47,036
You should probably
do your sales calls.

167
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,805
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

168
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:50,857
I got three of 'em

169
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,543
before the damn office
is even open.

170
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,179
Do you remember that
rent is due next week?

171
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,681
Probably not.

172
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,950
We're already
two months behind.

173
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:04,337
Next... Next week
we'll owe three months.

174
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,754
I've been pulling double shifts

175
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:08,991
for... For four months now,
Chris.

176
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,778
Just... Just sell
what's in your contract.

00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,496
Get us out of that business.

178
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:17,684
Linda. That is what
I am trying to do.

179
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:20,853
This is what I'm trying
to do for my family.

180
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,555
For you and for Christopher.

181
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,359
What's the matter with you?

182
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:31,047

Do you mind... if I

00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:13,388
um, just for five minutes?

00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,667
Okay.
Um, it's not valuable.

203
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,086
You can't sell it anywhere.

204
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:30,539

209
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:43,936
Come with me.
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,554
Let me see if I can
find you an application

211
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:46,839
for our internship.

212
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,690
I'm afraid that's all
we can do for you.

213
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,126
See, this is
a satellite office.

214
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,477
Jay Twistle in the main office,

215
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,061
he oversees Witter Resources.

216
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:55,347
I mean, I'm... You know,
I'm just this office.

217
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:58,701
As you can see, we got a hell
of a lot of applications here...

218
00:13:58,703 --> 00:13:59,885
Normally I have a resume sheet,

219
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,654
but I can't seem
to find it anywhere.

220
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:05,541
W-we, uh... Uh...
Um... Thank you very much.

221
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,359

222
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,212
I'll... I'll br...
I'll bring this back.

223
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,546
Thank you.

224
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:12,080

00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:27,289
<i>I didn't need that many lines.</i>

It's late.

240
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,643

00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,406
<i>Don't expect

246
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:03,042

Hey.

Wake up.

254
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:18,791
Eat.

255
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:21,344
<i>Bye, Mom.</i>

256
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,795
Bye, baby.

257
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:25,097
Come back without that, please.

258
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,132
Oh. Yeah,
I'm going to.

259
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:27,633
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,

260
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,151
'cause I'm coming back
without it.

261
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:31,787
Goodbye and good riddance.

262
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,955
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

263
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:35,107
Bye, Mom.

264
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,110
Bye.

265
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:40,028
It's written as P-P-Y,

266
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,880
but it's supposed to be
an I in "happiness."

267
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,232
Is it an adjective?

268
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:45,250
Uh, no. Actually,
it's a noun.

269
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:47,152
But it's not spelled right.

270
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:48,537
Is "fuck" spelled right?

271
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,140
Yeah, that's spelled right.

272
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:52,725
But that's not part
of the motto,

273
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,292
so you're not supposed
to learn that.

274
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:56,662
That's an adult word
to show anger

275
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:59,397
and, um... other things.

276
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,250
But just don't...
Don't use that one, okay?

277
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:02,501
Okay.

278
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,520
What's that say on
the back of your bag?

279
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,121
My nickname.

280
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,941
We pick nicknames.

281
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:10,359
Oh, yeah?
What's it say?

282
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:11,643
"Hot Rod."

283
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,566
Did you have a nickname?
Yep.

284
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:20,435
What?
"Ten-Gallon Head."

285
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:21,486
Heh-heh.
What's that?

286
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,606
I grew up in Louisiana,
near Texas.

287
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,041
So everybody wears
cowboy hats. And a...

288
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:28,444
A ten-gallon's
a big hat.

289
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:29,795
I was smart back then,

290
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:32,615
so they called me
Ten-Gallon Head.

291
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:35,301
Hoss wears that hat.
Hoss?

292
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,219
Hoss Cartwright on <i>Bonanza.</i>

293
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:38,838
How do you know <i>Bonanza?</i>

294
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,090
We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

295
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,426
You watch <i>Bonanza</i> at daycare?

296
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:44,927
Yeah.

297
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,846
When? When do...?
When do you watch it?

298
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,316
After snack?
After your nap?

299
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:51,733
After <i>Love Boat.</i>

300
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,991
I made my list for my birthday.

301
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:01,027
Yeah, what'd you...?
What did you put on there?

302
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,411
A basketball...

303
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,112
or an ant farm.

304
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,151
He says he's been watching TV.

305
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:12,904
Oh, little TV for history.
<i>Love Boat?</i>

306
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,774
For history. Navy.

307
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,843
That's... That's
not the Navy.

308
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,062
I mean, he... He could
watch television at home.

309
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:23,082
We're paying you $150 a month.

310
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:24,633
I-if he's gonna be
sitting around

311
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:27,236
watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

312
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:31,022
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

313
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:36,261
You late pay anyway.
You complain.

314
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:37,796
I complain.

315
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,032
Can you at least put the dog

316
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:43,635
upstairs in you room
or something?

317
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:44,853
Bye.

Morning, Mr. Twistle.
Good morning.

00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,115
Mr. Twistle. Chris Gardner.
Hi. Hi.

327
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,700
I wanted to
drop this off personally

328
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:49,884
and make your acquaintance.

329
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,486
I thought I'd catch you
on the way in.

330
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:53,822
I'd really love the opportunity
to sit and discuss

331
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,941
what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

332
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:57,259
We'll start with this, Chris,

333
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,927
and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

334
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,730
Yes, sir. You have a great day.
You too.

335
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:10,556
<i>Hey. Uh, yeah, how you doing?</i>

336
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:12,758
This is Chris Gardner
calling for Dr. Delsey.

337
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,261
Uh, yeah, look, I'm running
a little late for a sales call.

338
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:18,830
I was... I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.

339
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:21,717
Right. Uh, we can still...?
Half an hour?

340
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,786
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.

00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:03,775
<i>Which was unlikely...</i>

353
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:06,561
<i>because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.</i>

354
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:09,798
<i>I spent our entire life
savings on these things.</i>

355
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,368
<i>It was such
a revolutionary machine.</i>

356
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,438
Ooh.

357
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,723
Can you feel it, baby?

358
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,591
Oh, yeah. You got me
doing all the work.

359
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:22,694
<i>What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals</i>

360
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,530
<i>would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.</i>

361
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:31,620
<i>I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.</i>

362
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,774
<i>So if I lost one, it was like</i>

363
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:37,943
<i>losing a month's groceries.</i>

364
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:44,283
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

365
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,388
Hey! Get back here!

366
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:55,761
Hey, man, uh...

367
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:57,412
Uh, I... Uh...

368
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:01,733
Who's he?
He's that guy.

369
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,228
<i>Did you forget?</i>

370
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,230
Forget what?

371
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:19,384
You're not supposed to
have any of those.

372
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:20,602
Yeah, I know.

373
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,671
You have two now.

374
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,550
Hey.

375
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:39,154
Hey, Mom.

376
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:46,178
<i>One...</i>

377
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,162
two...

378
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:48,196
three!

379
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:49,214
Whoo!

380
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:51,032
That's a basketball!

381
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,968
Hey, hey.
What do you mean?

382
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,819
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

383
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,037
This could be an ant farm.

384
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,657
This... This could be a...
A microscope or anything.

385
00:22:58,659 --> 00:22:59,691
No, it's not.

386
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,593
There, there.

387
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:03,828
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

388
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,487
That paper's a little heavy, huh?

389
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:15,557
Yeah, but I got it.

390
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,653
Yeah, you should've
seen me out there today. Uh...

391
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:31,273
Somebody, uh, stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...

392
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,908
Whatever.

393
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,312
What?
Whatever, Chris.

394
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:40,515
What the hell
you got attitude about?

395
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:41,667
"Whatever" what?

396
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:43,485
Every day's
got some damn story.

397
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:45,153
Hey, hey, Roy.
Roy!

398
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:47,372
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

399
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:48,807
There's dust and shit all over.

400
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,258
I'm trying to keep
a clean house.

401
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,777
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.

402
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:54,446
Listen.
Look, Linda. Relax.

403
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:56,348
We're gonna come out of this.

404
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,870
Everything is gonna
be fine, all right?

405
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:03,438
You said that before, when
I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

406
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,023
So you don't trust me now?

407
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:07,726
Whatever.
I don't care.

408
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:26,078
Taxi!
Mr. Twistle.

409
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,947
Yeah, hi.
Hi. Chris Gardner.

410
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:30,866
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

411
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:33,034
I submitted an application
for the intern program

412
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,319
about a month ago,

413
00:24:34,321 --> 00:24:36,254
and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

414
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:39,224
Listen, I'm going to
Noe Valley, Chris.

415
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:40,225
Uh, take care of yourself.

416
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:42,294
Mr. Twistle.

417
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:44,829
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

418
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:46,882
Uh... how about
we share a ride?

419
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,302
All right, get in.
All right.

420
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:59,344
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor

421
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:02,347
who loved to play golf, hour...
Hours every day.

422
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:05,016
And... I would actually...

423
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:07,119
perform medical procedures

424
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:08,570
when he'd leave me
in the office.

425
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:10,738
So... I'm... I'm used to
being in a position

426
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,942
where... Where I have to
make decisions and...

427
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:18,747
Mr. Twistle. Listen, this is...
This is a very important...

428
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,600
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh.
Th... This thing's impossible.

429
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,687
I can do it.
No, you can't. No one can.

430
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,640
That's bullshit.
No. I'm pretty sure I can do it.

431
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,142
Mm. No, you can't.

432
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:31,843
Let me see it.

433
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:33,711
Give it here.

434
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,932
Oh, yeah. Oh.

435
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:40,602
Wow, you... You, uh,
really messed it up.

436
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:42,154
Heh. Sorry.

437
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:46,291
Uh... it... It looks like it...
It, uh, works around a swivel,

438
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:49,411
so the center pieces
never move.

439
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:51,213
So if it's yellow
in the center,

440
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,630
that's the yellow side.
Right.

441
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:55,100
If it's red in the center,
that's the... red side.

442
00:25:55,102 --> 00:25:57,035
Okay.
All right. So...

443
00:25:57,037 --> 00:25:59,338
You... You can slow down.

444
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,089
Uh, listen, we can
drive around all day.

445
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:02,507
I don't believe
you can do this.

446
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:04,092
Uh, yeah, I can.
No. No, you can't.

447
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:05,560
Yes, I can.
No, you can't.

448
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:07,712
I'm telling you,
no one can. It's tough.

449
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,999
See? That's all
I ever do.

450
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:13,302
Uh, uh, uh...

451
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:25,880
Y-you almost have
this side.

452
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,184
Holy cow.

453
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,695
Oh. Oh, you almost
had that one.

454
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,198
I'm gonna get it.

455
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:52,357
Look at that.

456
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:16,982
You're almost there.

457
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:42,140
17.10.

458
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:43,524
Oh, this is me.

459
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:47,979
Good job.

460
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:50,448
Goodbye.

461
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,884
Yeah. I'll see...
See you soon.

462
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:57,372
Uh, where are you going, sir?

463
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,007
Excuse me, sir.

464
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,592
Where are you going, please?

465
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:02,410
Uh... Um...

466
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:05,146
Uh, two...
A couple blocks.

467
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:06,965
Just, you know, flip around.

468
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:08,817
Okay.

469
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:53,145
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

470
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:54,546
Where are you going?!
Come here!

471
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:57,099
No! No!
No. No, no, no, no!

472
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,735
Hey! You asshole. Give me
my money! Give me my money.

473
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:01,636
Please stop.
Please, please. Please!

474
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:02,587
Son of a bitch.

475
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,105
Please! He should've paid you!

476
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:05,624
He should've paid you!
Come here!

477
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:06,908
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,077
I'm so sorry.
Come here. I'll kick your ass!

479
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,330
I'm sorry!

480
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,630
Idiot.

481
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:24,576
I'll get you!

482
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:28,463
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

483
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:45,647
Hey!

484
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:48,600
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

485
00:29:48,602 --> 00:29:50,151
Stop him!

486
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,074
Stop him!

487
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:03,915
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

488
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:06,818
<i>Please stand clear
of the doors.</i>

489
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:16,594
No! No! No!

490
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,333
No!

491
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:46,474
<i>Hello?</i>

492
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:48,226
Hey. Yeah.

493
00:30:48,228 --> 00:30:50,195
Sorry... Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

494
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:52,280
<i>Chris. I missed my shift.</i>

495
00:30:52,282 --> 00:30:54,615
Yeah, I... I know.
I'm sorry about that.

496
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,117
Look, um... I'm
on my way right now.

497
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,769
Are you all right
with Christopher?

498
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:00,705
<i>I'm leaving.
Chris, I'm leaving.</i>

499
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:02,941
What?
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

500
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:07,329
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

501
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:09,614
and we're gonna leave now.

502
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:11,049
<i>I'm gonna put the phone down...</i>

503
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:12,734
Linda. Wait a minute.
Hold it... Hold...

504
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:13,851
<i>We are leaving.</i>

505
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,210
<i>It was right then
that I started thinking</i>

506
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:25,464
<i>about Thomas Jefferson...</i>
Wait, wait!

507
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,648
<i>...and the Declaration
of Independence...</i>

508
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,084
<i>...and the part about
our right to life,</i>

509
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:33,772
<i>liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.</i>

510
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:35,807
<i>And I remember thinking:</i>

511
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:36,924
<i>How did he know...</i>

512
00:31:36,926 --> 00:31:40,812
<i>to put the "pursuit"
part in there?</i>

513
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:42,530
<i>That maybe happiness
is something</i>

514
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:45,133
<i>that we can only pursue.</i>

515
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:48,887
<i>And maybe we can actually
never have it...</i>

516
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:50,555
<i>no matter what.</i>

517
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:52,673
<i>How did he know that?</i>

518
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:00,631
Linda. Linda.

519
00:32:33,282 --> 00:32:35,133
Hello?
<i>Chris.</i>

520
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:38,119
Who is this?
<i>Jay Twistle.</i>

521
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:40,588
Uh... Hey.
<i>Dean Witter.</i>

522
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,557
Yeah, of course. Uh...
Uh... how are you?

523
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,927
<i>I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?</i>

524
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,378
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

525
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,481
<i>I'll tell you what.
Come on by day after tomorrow,</i>

527
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,733
<i>We're interviewing
for the internships.</i>

528
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:53,868
<i>You got a pen and paper?</i>

529
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,587
Uh. Yes. Uh, yes, I do.

530
00:32:56,589 --> 00:33:00,408
Um... Uh. Hold on one second.

531
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,260
<i>All right.</i>

532
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:08,115

Uh... Uh, go ahead. I have one.

Yep.
<i>Okay, 415.</i>

538
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,259

<i>Right. Call her tomorrow.</i>
Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:40,815
4796. Janice.

547
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:45,920
Chris.
Hey.

548
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:48,673
Did you, uh...? Have you seen,
uh, Linda and Christopher?

549
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:50,157
No. You catch
the game last night?

550
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,460
No, no.
You didn't see that, 118-1... One...

551
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:54,895
Excuse me, did, uh, Linda
and Christopher come in here?

552
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:59,484
No, I haven't see them.
119-120. Double overtime.

553
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:01,202
Moons hits a three-pointer,
17 seconds left.

554
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:02,787
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

555
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:04,605
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

556
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,491
What's your problem
with numbers?

557
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:08,793
8642.

558
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:09,894
And you owe me money.
Yeah.

559
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,729
You owe me $14.

560
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:14,465
I'm gonna get that to you.

561
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:16,084
I need my money.
I need my money.

562
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,237
Fourteen's a number.

563
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:50,251
Hey. Don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

564
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:51,619
Do you hear me?
Leave me alone!

565
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:53,438
Don't take my son away
from me again.

566
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,356
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

567
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:57,524
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

568
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,227
Do you hear me?

569
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:00,711
Do you wanna leave?
Yeah.

570
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,663
You wanna leave?
Yes, I want to leave!

571
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:06,784
Get the hell out
of here, then, Linda.

572
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:08,369
Get the hell out of here.

573
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:09,803
Christopher's staying with me.

574
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:12,123
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

575
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:15,643
You are so weak...
No. I am not happy anymore.

576
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:18,462
I'm just not happy!
Then go get happy, Linda!

577
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,281
Just go get happy.

578
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,350
But Christopher's
living with me!

579
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:24,819
Stop!
Did you hear what I said?!

580
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:26,804
Christopher's living with me!

581
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:55,816
Hey. Come... Come on.
Let's go.

582
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:58,703
How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
Hi.

583
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,091
Where's Mom?

584
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:04,842
Look, just get...
Get your stuff.

585
00:36:04,844 --> 00:36:08,496
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

586
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:10,164
Uh... Yeah, I know.

587
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,468
Um... I talked to
Mom earlier.

588
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,402
Everything is fine, okay?

589
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:23,894
Where do I sleep tonight?

590
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:26,231
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

591
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:29,100
Yeah.
All right. Because I'm happy.

592
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:31,336
And if you're happy
and I'm happy,

593
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:32,854
then that's
a good thing, right?

594
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,839
Yeah.
Yeah. All right.

595
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:37,108
You're s... You're
sleeping with me.

596
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,277
You're staying at home,
uh, where you...

597
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,146
Where you belong, all right?

598
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:42,180
Uh...

599
00:36:45,634 --> 00:36:46,618
Come on.

600
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:57,478
Christopher.

601
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:18,299
Hey. Listen, I need the rent.
Yeah.

602
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:19,484
I can't wait anymore.

603
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:21,168
Yeah, uh... I'm good
for that, Charlie.

604
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,520
I'm gonna get it.

605
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:25,923
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

606
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,859
It's half what you pay here.

607
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:30,427
Listen, Chris. I need you
out of here in the morning.

608
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:34,766
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

609
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:36,050
I got painters coming in.

610
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:37,985
All right. All right, look.
I need more time.

611
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:39,370
No.

612
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,188
All right...
I'll paint it myself.

613
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,424
All right, but I...
I just... I gotta have

614
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:46,577
some more time...
I got my son up in here.

615
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:52,783
All right.

616
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:56,237
One week.
And you paint it.

Uh, yeah.
What happened?

626
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:55,163
Payable to
the City of San Francisco.

627
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:57,364
Does it have to be the...
The full amount?

628
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:59,183
Well, you gotta pay
each parking ticket.

629
00:38:59,185 --> 00:39:00,818
Otherwise, you're staying.

630
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,769
This is all I got.

631
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:10,794
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

632
00:39:10,796 --> 00:39:11,912
What?

633
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:14,382
Yeah, you gotta stay
until this thing clears.

634
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,868
No.

635
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,270
No, I... I can't... I can't
spend the night here.

636
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,522
I... I have to
pick up my son.

637
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:23,224
You verify at
9:30 tomorrow.

638
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:26,093
Sir... I have a job interview
at Dean Witter

639
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,862
at 10:15
tomorrow morning.

640
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:29,647
I cannot stay...
9:30 tomorrow morning.

641
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:31,182
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

642
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:34,719
Is there anyone else who can...?
I take care of him.

643
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:37,938
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

644
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:45,613
All right. Uh, can I make...
Have my phone call, please?

645
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,817
Hello.

646
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:50,818
<i>Hey.</i>

00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:54,238
Um...

649
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,407
you gotta get
Christopher, uh...

650
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,825
from daycare.

651
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:58,742
I can't... Um...

652
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:02,146
Just keep him
for the night, and I'm gonna...

653
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:03,914

Just one night.

654

<i>What happened?</i>

655
00:40:06,185 --> 00:40:09,871
I'll pick him up
from, uh, daycare... tomorrow.

656
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:11,422
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...

657
00:40:11,424 --> 00:40:13,140
You can drop him off,
and I'll pick him up.

658
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:16,244
No.

659
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,129
<i>Come on, Linda.</i>

660
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:19,480
<i>Why you...?
Why you doing that?</i>

661
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:22,833
No. I wanna take him
to the park.

662
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:24,385
To Golden Gate...

663
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:25,920
after daycare tomorrow.

664
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:29,156
How is he?

665
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,541
He's fine.

666
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:34,261
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park... and...

667
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:35,746
And... bring him back,
all right?

668
00:40:37,817 --> 00:40:39,099
All right, just...

669
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:41,002
bring... Bring me my son back.

670
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:43,837
<i>Okay?</i>

671
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,589
<i>Linda?</i>

672
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:47,558
I'll bring him back around 6.

673
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:50,912
All right. All right.

674
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:53,314
Uh... thank you.

675
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:54,831
Um...

676
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,017
All right.

677
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:56,984
Bye.

678
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:24,762
I'm okay?

679
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:01,682
Excuse me. Excuse me.

680
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:03,066
Yes, I did.

681
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,544
Mr. Gardner.

682
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:22,553
This way.

683
00:42:24,757 --> 00:42:25,789
It'll be right this way.

684
00:42:39,054 --> 00:42:40,304
What is the word on that one?

685
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:02,960
Chris Gardner.

686
00:43:06,431 --> 00:43:07,448
Chris Gardner.

687
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:11,102
How are you?
Good morning.

688
00:43:11,104 --> 00:43:12,786
Chris Gardner.

689
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:15,055
Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

690
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:16,173
Chris Gardner.
Pleasure.

691
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:20,778
I've been sitting there
for the last half hour

692
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,813
trying to come up with a story

693
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:25,799
that would explain
my being here dressed...

694
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:27,351
like this.

695
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:29,553
And... And I wanted
to come up with a story

696
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:31,555
that would
demonstrate qualities

697
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:33,491
that I'm sure
you all admire here,

698
00:43:33,493 --> 00:43:36,143
like... Like earnestness
or diligence.

699
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:38,829
And team-playing.
Something.

700
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:41,398
And I couldn't think...
of anything.

701
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:44,518
So the truth is...

702
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,305
I was arrested for failure
to pay parking tickets.

703
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:48,422
Parking tickets?

704
00:43:48,424 --> 00:43:49,640
What?

705
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:52,243
And I ran all the way here
from the... The Polk Station,

706
00:43:52,245 --> 00:43:53,443
the police station.

707
00:43:53,445 --> 00:43:55,646
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

708
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:58,865
I was, uh...
painting my apartment.

709
00:43:58,867 --> 00:43:59,950
Is it dry now?

710
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,170
Uh. I hope so.

711
00:44:03,172 --> 00:44:05,122
Jay says you're
pretty determined.

712
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:07,691
Oh, he's been waiting outside
the front of the building

713
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:09,993
with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

714
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,678
He said you're smart.

715
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,597
Well, I like to think so.

716
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,449
And you want to
learn this business?

717
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:16,800
Yes, sir, I wanna
learn this business.

718
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:19,186
Have you already started
learning on your own?

719
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:21,038
Absolutely.

720
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,441
Jay?
Yes, sir.

721
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:25,659
How many times
have you seen Chris?

722
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:27,194
Yeah, I don't know.

723
00:44:27,196 --> 00:44:28,662
One too many, apparently.

724
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:30,715
Was he ever dressed like this?

725
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:34,017
No. No. Jacket and tie.

726
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:38,839
First in your class in school?

727
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:40,791
High school?
Yes, sir.

728
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,793
How many in the class?

729
00:44:42,795 --> 00:44:44,545
Uh, 12.

730
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:45,348
It was a small town.

731
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:47,597
I'll say.

732
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,017
But I was also first
in my radar class in...

733
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,387
In the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

734
00:44:55,756 --> 00:44:57,408
Can I say something?

735
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,660
Uh... Um... I'm
the type of person...

736
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:04,114
if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer,

737
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:06,584
I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

738
00:45:06,586 --> 00:45:08,135
But I bet you what.

739
00:45:08,137 --> 00:45:10,187
I know how to find the answer.

740
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:13,107
And I <i>will</i> find the answer.

741
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:16,043
Is that fair enough?

742
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:18,612
Chris.

743
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:21,465
What would you say

744
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:23,817
if a guy walked in
for an interview

745
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:26,019
without a shirt on...

746
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:27,454
and I hired him?

747
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:28,505
What would you say?

748
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,346
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

749
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:52,530
Chris...

750
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,715
I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man,

751
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:55,999
but you really pulled it off.

752
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:57,768
Thank you very much,
Mr. Twistle.

753
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,170
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

754
00:46:00,172 --> 00:46:01,955
All right, so I'll
let you know, Jay.

755
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:06,043
You'll... "You'll let me know,
Jay"? What do you mean?

756
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:08,212
Yeah. I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...

757
00:46:08,214 --> 00:46:10,514
What are you talking...?
You hounded me for this.

758
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,299
You stood here...

759
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:13,884
Listen. There's no salary.
No.

760
00:46:13,886 --> 00:46:15,085
I was not aware of that.

761
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:16,887
My circumstances
have changed some,

762
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:19,189
and I need to be certain
that I'll be...

763
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:21,142
All right. Okay.

764
00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:25,879
Tonight.

765
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:29,567
I swear, I will fill
your spot. I promise.

766
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:32,669
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

767
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:34,922
Yes. An ass...

768
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:35,923
A-hole.

769
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:39,410
Yeah, an ass A-hole,
all the way.

770
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:44,865
You are a piece of work.

771
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:47,534

00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:32,223
Okay, baby.

803
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:45,986
I got it.

804
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:53,593
I'm going to New York.

805
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:01,268
Uh.

806
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:25,959
My sister's boyfriend...

807
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,377
opened a restaurant,

808
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:30,230
and they may have
a job for me there, so...

809
00:49:30,232 --> 00:49:32,699
I'm going to New York, Chris.

810
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:37,704
Christopher's staying with me.

811
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:47,581
I'm his mom. You know?

812
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,883
He should be with his mom.

813
00:49:49,885 --> 00:49:52,002
I should have him, right?

814
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:54,071
You know you can't
take care of him.

815
00:50:02,814 --> 00:50:04,548
What are you gonna do
for money?

816
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:08,118
I had an...

817
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,255
interview at Dean Witter
for... For an internship.

818
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:14,058
And I got it.

819
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,776
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

820
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:20,614
Salesman to intern's backwards.

821
00:50:20,616 --> 00:50:22,499
No, it's not.

822
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:25,702
I gotta go.

823
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,455
Tell him I love him, okay?

824
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:04,507
And...

825
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:13,032
I know you'll take care
of him, Chris.

826
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:14,701
I know that.

827
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:58,295
<i>Dean Witter.</i>
Yes, hi.

828
00:51:58,297 --> 00:51:59,712
Um...

829
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:01,565
Yes, uh, I'd like to leave
a message for...

830
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:03,316
For Mr. Jay Twistle.

831
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:04,467
<i>Your name?</i>

832
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,603
Uh... Yeah, my name

833
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:08,405
Uh... Uh, the message is:

834
00:52:08,407 --> 00:52:10,056
Thank you very much for...

835
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:13,676
For inviting me
into the program.

836
00:52:13,678 --> 00:52:15,895
Uh, I really appreciate it,

837
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:17,464
and...

838
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:20,366
I'd be very pleased
to accept your invitation.

839
00:52:20,368 --> 00:52:22,502
<i>Is that all?</i>

840
00:52:22,504 --> 00:52:24,287
Yes, that's...
That's it.

841
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:26,223
<i>Okay.</i>
Thank you.

842
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:27,774
<i>Bye.</i>

843
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:55,885
Be careful with that.
What?

844
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:57,637
Be care... Go ahead.

845
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:24,130
Are we there?

846
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:25,415
Yep.

847
00:53:38,746 --> 00:53:40,864
Hey. You know
what today is?

848
00:53:40,866 --> 00:53:42,349
Yeah.
What?

849
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:43,399
Saturday.

850
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:44,951
You know what
Saturday is, right?

851
00:53:44,953 --> 00:53:46,953
Yeah.
What?

852
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:48,538
Basketball.

853
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,307
You wanna go play
some basketball?

854
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:51,824
Okay.

855
00:53:51,826 --> 00:53:54,378
All right. Then we're gonna
go sell a bone density scanner.

856
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,662
How about that?

857
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:57,347
Wanna do that?

858
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:58,198
No.

859
00:54:01,236 --> 00:54:02,369
Hey, Dad, I'm going pro.
Oh.

860
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:05,872
I'm going pro.

861
00:54:05,874 --> 00:54:07,224
Oh-ho!

862
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:08,758
Okay.

863
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,328
Yeah. I don't know,
you know.

864
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,931
Uh... you'll probably be
about as good as I was.

865
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:16,700
That's kind of the way
it works, you know.

866
00:54:16,702 --> 00:54:18,051
And I... I was
below average.

867
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:19,886
You know, so...
Whoa.

868
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:22,155
So you'll probably
ultimately rank...

869
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:23,890
somewhere around there,
you know, so...

870
00:54:23,892 --> 00:54:24,891
I really...

871
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:26,293
You'll excel at
a lot of things,

872
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:27,327
just not this.

873
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:28,745
So I don't want you out here

874
00:54:28,747 --> 00:54:31,298
shooting this ball around
all day and night, all right?

875
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,349
All right.

876
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:34,133
Okay.

877
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,236
All right, go ahead.

878
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:02,279
Hey.

879
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:08,184
Don't ever let
somebody tell you...

880
00:55:08,186 --> 00:55:10,020
you <i>can't</i> do something.

881
00:55:11,472 --> 00:55:13,540
Not even me.

882
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:16,443
All right?

883
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:18,395
All right.

884
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:21,098
You got a dream...

885
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,333
you gotta protect it.

886
00:55:24,468 --> 00:55:26,270
People can't do something
themselves,

887
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:28,605
they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

888
00:55:33,077 --> 00:55:35,578
If you want something,
go get it.

889
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,029
Period.

890
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:46,423
Let's go.

891
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:52,311
Dad. Why did we move
to a motel?

892
00:55:52,313 --> 00:55:54,881
I told you. Because I'm...
I'm getting a better job.

893
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:57,834
You gotta trust me, all right?

894
00:55:57,836 --> 00:55:59,152
I trust you.

895
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:01,254
All right, here. Come on,
come on. Come on. Keep up.

896
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:05,609
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

897
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,162
Dad. When's Mom
coming back?

898
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,731
I don't know, Christopher.

899
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:13,867
Dad, listen to this.

900
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:17,520
One day, a man was
drowning in the water.

901
00:56:17,522 --> 00:56:20,223
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

902
00:56:20,225 --> 00:56:22,759
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

903
00:56:22,761 --> 00:56:26,146
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

904
00:56:26,148 --> 00:56:28,715
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

905
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:31,051
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

906
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:34,487
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

907
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:37,507
And God said, "I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

908
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:40,927
Do you like it?

909
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:43,630
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

910
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:51,538
Oh. Thank you very much, sir.
Yes, sir.

911
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,373
You got the bill of sale here.
Yes.

912
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:54,957
All the information
you'll need.

913
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:56,810
Uh, thank you very much
for your business.

914
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:58,344
Thank you.

915
00:56:58,346 --> 00:57:01,014
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 182, please.</i>

916
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:03,166
<i>One hundred, 200, 20, 40,</i>

917
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:05,952
45, 46, 7, 8, 9, 10.

918
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:07,370
Thank you.

919
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,140
Hey, you want one of those?

920
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:12,758
No, it's okay.

921
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,096
Come on, you can
have one. Which one?

922
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:17,798
You like that one? How much?

923
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,449
Twenty-five
cents.

924
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:38,735
<i>This part of my life
is called "Internship."</i>

925
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:41,187
The 1200 building is Medley
Industrial and Sanko Oil.

926
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:43,656
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

927
00:57:43,658 --> 00:57:45,758
In a couple of weeks,
you'll get call sheets

928
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,810
with the phone numbers
of employees

929
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:51,131
from every <i>Fortune 500</i> company
in the financial district.

930
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:54,133
You will be pooling
from 60 <i>Fortune</i> companies.

931
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:57,086
You will mainly be
cold-calling potential clients.

932
00:57:57,088 --> 00:57:58,938
But if you have to
have lunch with them,

933
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,374
have breakfast with them,
even babysit for them,

934
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:02,742
you will do whatever it takes

935
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:04,711
to familiarize them
with our packages.

936
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:06,796
We need you to match
their needs and goals

937
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,432
to one of our many
financial plans.

938
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:10,066
In essence...

939
00:58:10,068 --> 00:58:12,069
you reel them in,

940
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,219
we'll cook the fish.

941
00:58:14,973 --> 00:58:17,107
Some of you guys are here
because you know somebody.

942
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:19,793
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

943
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:22,546
But there's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

944
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:24,948
That person's gonna be
the guy...

945
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,433
who can turn this into this.

946
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:30,954
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

947
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:33,623
You, you, help me
hand these out.

948
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:36,976
This is going to be your bible.

949
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:38,978
You'll eat with it.
You'll drink with it.

950
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,396
<i>It was simple.</i>

951
00:58:40,398 --> 00:58:43,600
<i>X number of calls equals
X number of prospects.</i>

952
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:47,086
<i>X number of prospects equals
X number of customers.</i>

953
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:50,240
<i>X number of customers equals
X number of dollars</i>

954
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,274
<i>in the company's pocket.</i>

955
00:58:51,276 --> 00:58:52,492
Your board exam.

956
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:54,293
Last year, we had an intern

957
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:56,480
score a 96.4 percent

958
00:58:56,482 --> 00:58:58,548
on the written exam.

959
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,299
He wasn't chosen.

960
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:02,135
It's not a simple pass/fail.

961
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:05,722
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

962
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:07,607
Be safe. Score a hundred.

963
00:59:09,961 --> 00:59:12,578
Okay. Let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

964
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:23,422
Oh. Hey. Mr. Frohm.
Hi.

965
00:59:23,424 --> 00:59:24,641
Uh, Chris.

966
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:25,992
Ah, Chris, how are you?

967
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:27,043
I'm good. How you doing?

968
00:59:27,045 --> 00:59:28,894
Fine, thank you for asking.

969
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:31,364
Yeah, uh, first day in there.
It was, uh, exciting.

970
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:33,666
You're not quitting on us yet, are you?
Oh, no.

971
00:59:33,668 --> 00:59:35,702
No, sir. Ten-minute break.
Uh...

972
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:36,986
Pop out, get a quick bite,

973
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:38,704
and then back in there
for board prep.

974
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:40,607
Oh, man, I remember mine.

975
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:43,342
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

976
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:45,945
We didn't do world markets,
we didn't bother with taxes,

977
00:59:45,947 --> 00:59:47,864
and it was still
a pain in the ass.

978
00:59:47,866 --> 00:59:49,399
Funny what you remember.

979
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:50,583
There was a beautiful girl

980
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:51,934
in that class.

981
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:54,487
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so...

982
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:57,023
I've seen an old friend
of mine. Uh, do... Do you mind?

983
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:58,241
No, go ahead.

984
00:59:58,243 --> 00:59:59,859
Uh, good talking to you, sir.

985
01:00:26,354 --> 01:00:27,837
Aah.

986
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,074
Hey, hey... Hey, asshole.
Yeah.

987
01:00:31,076 --> 01:00:32,342
Are you all right, asshole?

988
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:35,044
Are... Are you okay?

989
01:00:35,046 --> 01:00:36,613
I mean, what were you thinking?

990
01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:39,432
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

991
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:41,551
I'm trying to cross the street.

992
01:00:41,553 --> 01:00:42,802
Uh... you're all right?

993
01:00:42,804 --> 01:00:43,953
Yeah, yeah.

994
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,239
Where's my shoe?
What?

995
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:48,491
You knocked off my shoe!

996
01:00:48,493 --> 01:00:51,060
I don't know
where your shoe is.

997
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,279
Where's my damn shoe?

998
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:54,264
I don't know.

999
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:02,104
Hey.

1000
01:01:03,423 --> 01:01:05,458
Did you see it?
I lost my shoe.

1001
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,109
No, I'm sorry.

1002
01:01:07,111 --> 01:01:10,362
Hey. Hey. Where
are you going?

1003
01:01:10,364 --> 01:01:11,898
We should wait for the police.

1004
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,660
I gotta go to work.

1005
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:15,935
Hey, you just got hit by a car.

1006
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:18,137
Go to the hospital.

1007
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:21,424
I'm in a competitive
internship at Dean Witter.

1008
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:34,271
Hey, man, you're
missing a shoe.

1009
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,405
Oh. Yeah.
Thanks.

1010
01:01:36,407 --> 01:01:38,324
Thank you.
Yeah.

1011
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:45,665
<i>Dad.</i>

1012
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:47,166
Y-you don't have
a shoe.

1013
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:49,252
Yep. I know.

1014
01:01:49,254 --> 01:01:50,636
Wanna know what happened?

1015
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:51,588
Yeah.

1016
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:54,507
I got hit by a car.

1017
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:56,442
You got hit by a car?

1018
01:01:56,444 --> 01:01:57,793
Yep.

1019
01:01:57,795 --> 01:01:59,245
Where?

1020
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:01,380
Uh, just right by the office.

1021
01:02:01,382 --> 01:02:03,032
No, where in your body?

1022
01:02:03,034 --> 01:02:04,334
Like, the back of my legs.

1023
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:05,618
Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.

1024
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,752
Goodbye.

1025
01:02:06,754 --> 01:02:07,903
Where you on the street?

1026
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:10,073
Y-yeah. I was running
in the street.

1027
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:12,141
Don't do that.
You can get hurt.

1028
01:02:12,143 --> 01:02:15,478
Yeah, thanks.

1029
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,480
I'll remember that next time.

1030
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:21,767
<i>And here I was again.
Show up early.</i>

1031
01:02:21,769 --> 01:02:23,987
<i>While qualified persons...</i>

1032
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:26,305
Qualified persons are
interested in investing

1033
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:27,924
and have money to invest.

1034
01:02:27,926 --> 01:02:29,876
Now... Chris.
Yes, sir.

1035
01:02:29,878 --> 01:02:32,295
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

1036
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:36,465
<i>Favors for Frakesh,
our office manager. All day.</i>

1037
01:02:36,467 --> 01:02:39,119
My name is Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Michael Anderson.

1038
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:42,005
Well, yes, sir. We're having
a lunch actually this Thursday.

1039
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:44,690
Okay, next time. All right.
I'm gonna hold you to that.

1040
01:02:44,692 --> 01:02:45,841
Okay, yes. Thank you.

1041
01:02:46,828 --> 01:02:48,144
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

1042
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:49,128
Chris?

1043
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,132
Yes, sir.

1044
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:54,684
<i>Feeling underrated</i>

1045
01:02:54,686 --> 01:02:56,435
<i>and unappreciated.</i>

01:02:56,437 --> 01:02:58,371
Hello. Mr. Ronald Fryer.

1047
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:00,773
Why, good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner,

1048
01:03:00,775 --> 01:03:02,224
and I'm calling
from Dean Witter.

1049
01:03:02,226 --> 01:03:04,344
Yes, I have some very, very
valuable information

1050
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:05,528
on what's called a tax...

1051
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,080
Okay... Thank you, sir.

1052
01:03:08,816 --> 01:03:10,599
<i>Then catch the bus by 4</i>

1053
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:14,020

<i>The 22 home.</i>

1056
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:20,976
Hey! Chris!

1057
01:03:20,978 --> 01:03:22,095
Hey. Hi, Ralph.

1058
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:23,346
I'm waiting.

1059
01:03:23,348 --> 01:03:25,314
All right, uh,
I-I got that for you, Ralph.

1060
01:03:25,316 --> 01:03:27,166
I'm... I'm gonna
get that for you.

1061
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:38,077
<i>Whoever brought in

1063
01:03:39,397 --> 01:03:41,764
Yes, hello, Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Walter Hobb.

1064
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:44,917
<i>We were all working our way up
call sheets to sign clients.</i>

1065
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:46,135
<i>From the bottom to the top.</i>

1066
01:03:46,137 --> 01:03:47,453
Yes, sir.
How are you?

1067
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,305
<i>From the doorman to the CEO.</i>

1068
01:03:49,307 --> 01:03:50,840
Okay.

1069
01:03:50,842 --> 01:03:53,625
<i>They'd stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.</i>

1070
01:03:53,627 --> 01:03:56,929
<i>I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.</i>

1071
01:03:56,931 --> 01:03:58,998
Good afternoon.
My name is Chris Gardner.

1072
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,082
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

1073
01:04:00,084 --> 01:04:01,834
<i>In order not to waste any time,</i>

1074
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:04,404
<i>I wasn't hanging up the phone
in between calls.</i>

1075
01:04:04,406 --> 01:04:05,688
Okay. Thank you very much.

1076
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:10,443
<i>I realized that by
not hanging up the phone,</i>

1077
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:12,729
<i>I gained another
eight minutes a day.</i>

1078
01:04:12,731 --> 01:04:14,680
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

1079
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:16,099
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

1080
01:04:16,101 --> 01:04:17,500
<i>I also wasn't drinking water,</i>

1081
01:04:17,502 --> 01:04:20,119
<i>so I didn't waste any time
in the bathroom.</i>

1082
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:22,388
Uh, yes, I'd love to
have the opportunity...

1083
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:25,691
Okay... No problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

1084
01:04:25,693 --> 01:04:27,209
<i>But even doing all this...</i>

1085
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,794
<i>after two months...</i>

1086
01:04:28,796 --> 01:04:31,564
<i>I still didn't have time
to work my way up a sheet.</i>

1087
01:04:43,994 --> 01:04:46,663
We're feeling really
confident about that one as well.

1088
01:04:46,665 --> 01:04:48,882
<i>Walter Ribbon's office.</i>

1089
01:04:48,884 --> 01:04:50,283
Yes. Hello, my name
is Chris Gardner.

1090
01:04:50,285 --> 01:04:51,901
I'm calling for
Mr. Walter Ribbon.

1091
01:04:51,903 --> 01:04:53,118
<i>Concerning...?</i>

1092
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,921
Yes, ma'am, I'm calling
from Dean Witter.

1093
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:56,022
<i>Just a moment.</i>

1094
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,759
<i>Hello?</i>

1095
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:01,544
Mr. Ribbon.
Uh, h-h-hello, sir.

1096
01:05:01,546 --> 01:05:03,912
My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

1097
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:05,498
<i>Yeah, Chris.</i>
Uh, yes, Mr. Ribbon,

1098
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,066
I would love to have
the opportunity

1099
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:09,084
to sit with you to discuss
some of our products.

1100
01:05:09,086 --> 01:05:10,586
And, I... I'm certain
that I could be

1101
01:05:10,588 --> 01:05:11,754
of some assistance to you.

1102
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:13,822
<i>Can you be here in 20 minutes?</i>

1103
01:05:13,824 --> 01:05:16,693
Uh... ye... 20 minutes.
Absolutely.

1104
01:05:16,695 --> 01:05:18,294
<i>Just had someone cancel.</i>

1105
01:05:18,296 --> 01:05:20,580
<i>Come now. I can give you
a few minutes before the 49ers.</i>

1106
01:05:20,582 --> 01:05:22,298
<i>Monday Night Football, buddy.</i>

1107
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,682
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

1108
01:05:23,684 --> 01:05:24,834
<i>See you soon.</i>

1109
01:05:24,836 --> 01:05:26,018
Bye-bye.

1110
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:29,222
Excuse me.

1111
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:30,990
Thank you for the...

1112
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:32,574
Chris, what's up?
Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

1113
01:05:32,576 --> 01:05:34,093
Hey, man, do you have
five minutes?

1114
01:05:34,095 --> 01:05:36,279
Actually, I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon...

1115
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:38,981
Because I have no minutes. I'm
supposed to present commodities

1116
01:05:38,983 --> 01:05:41,484
to Bromer. Could you move my
car? That'd really help me out.

1117
01:05:41,486 --> 01:05:43,385
It's on Samson,
half block, silver Caprice.

1118
01:05:43,387 --> 01:05:45,788
Just move it to the other side.
They're street sweeping.

1119
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:47,340
There's spaces.
Hang on to these.

1120
01:05:47,342 --> 01:05:49,091
I have backups in my desk.

1121
01:05:49,093 --> 01:05:50,476
And you have to jimmy that.

1122
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:51,377
Uh, uh... Jimmy what?!

1123
01:05:51,379 --> 01:05:52,962
You have to jimmy the key.

1124
01:05:52,964 --> 01:05:55,331
And the other doors
don't unlock.

1125
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:56,482
You have to jimmy it.

1126
01:06:13,867 --> 01:06:15,150
Come on. I'm jimmying it.

1127
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:19,789
Oh, no!

1128
01:06:21,308 --> 01:06:22,558

Just filling out a check.

1163

Paying some bills and a...

1164
01:08:34,742 --> 01:08:36,375
parking ticket.

1165
01:08:38,878 --> 01:08:41,264
We don't have a car anymore.

1166
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:43,599
Yep. I know.

1167
01:08:45,102 --> 01:08:47,053
Oh, um...

1168
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:50,339
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

1169
01:08:50,341 --> 01:08:52,975
A couple doctors' offices.
Well...

1170
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:54,893
On sales calls, okay?

1171
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:56,929
Okay.

1172
01:08:59,732 --> 01:09:01,667
Then, possibly...

1173
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:03,936
we'll go to the football game.

1174
01:09:03,938 --> 01:09:04,937
Really?

1175
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:05,888
Uh, possibly.

1176
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,123
All right?

1177
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,925
All right.
Mm-hm.

1178
01:09:09,927 --> 01:09:11,210
Come on, finish up.

1179
01:09:12,362 --> 01:09:13,346
Are you sure?

1180
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:14,530
I was...

1181
01:09:14,532 --> 01:09:15,514
Possibly.

1182
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:17,750
Really?

1183
01:09:48,148 --> 01:09:50,449
Are you bringing it
to the game?

1184
01:09:50,451 --> 01:09:52,952
Yeah. I don't...
I don't wanna leave it.

1185
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:55,187
And maybe we're
going to the game.

1186
01:09:56,306 --> 01:09:57,406
All right.

1187
01:09:57,408 --> 01:09:59,008
Where are we going now?

1188
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:01,811
Uh, to see someone
about my job.

1189
01:10:01,813 --> 01:10:03,345
I don't understand.

1190
01:10:03,347 --> 01:10:04,797
You don't understand what?

1191
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,200
Are we going to the game?

1192
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:09,618
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

1193
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,154
You know what "possibly" means?
Like probably.

1194
01:10:12,156 --> 01:10:14,756
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

1195
01:10:14,758 --> 01:10:18,060
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

1196
01:10:18,062 --> 01:10:19,445
What does "probably" mean?

1197
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:21,346
It means we have a good chance.

1198
01:10:21,348 --> 01:10:22,932
And what does "possibly" mean?

1199
01:10:22,934 --> 01:10:25,267
I <i>know</i> what it means.
What does it mean?

1200
01:10:25,269 --> 01:10:28,354
It means that we're <i>not</i>
going to the game.

1201
01:10:29,773 --> 01:10:31,757
How did you get so smart?

1202
01:10:31,759 --> 01:10:33,008
Cause you're smart.

1203
01:10:38,081 --> 01:10:39,348
Are we there?

1204
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:41,033
Yeah.

1205
01:10:46,255 --> 01:10:47,607
Mr. Ribbon.

1206
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:50,359
Yes?
How are you, sir? Chris Gardner.

1207
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:51,360
Dean Witter.

1208
01:10:51,362 --> 01:10:52,895
Oh, hi. Hi.

1209
01:10:52,897 --> 01:10:54,279
This is my son, Christopher.

1210
01:10:54,281 --> 01:10:55,864
Hi.
Hey, Christopher.

1211
01:10:55,866 --> 01:10:57,349
W-w-what are you
doing up here?

1212
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:58,167
Uh, I came to apologize

1213
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:00,185
for missing our appointment
the other day.

1214
01:11:00,187 --> 01:11:02,505
Oh, you didn't need to come up.
Oh, no. Actually,

1215
01:11:02,507 --> 01:11:03,488
we were in the neighborhood

1216
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:06,492
visiting a very close friend
of ours, and I-I just wanted

1217
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:08,610
to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

1218
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:10,062
I know you probably
waited for me.

1219
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:11,180
Little bit.

1220
01:11:11,182 --> 01:11:12,197
I-I want you to know

1221
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:14,050
that I <i>do not</i>
take that for granted.

1222
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,302
Oh, come on. W-what, uh...
What's that?

1223
01:11:16,304 --> 01:11:20,022
Oh, this... Uh, an Osteo
National bone-density scanner.

1224

going to work at Witter.

1226
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,210
I have a meeting
after the game.

1227
01:11:25,212 --> 01:11:27,196
You guys are going to the game?
Oh, yeah.

1228
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:28,614
Possibly.

1229
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:29,898
Possibly.

1230
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,001
We're... We're going too.
I'm taking my son, Tim.

1231
01:11:32,003 --> 01:11:34,120
My 12-year-old.
We were just leaving. Tim!

1232
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:35,888
Listen, we'll... We'll
get out of your way.

1233
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,540
Um, again, thank you very much,

1234
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:38,841
and I'm sorry
about the other day.

1235
01:11:38,843 --> 01:11:41,310
And I hope that we can
reschedule for later this week.

1236
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:42,677
You got it.
Thank you very much, sir.

1237
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:44,914
All right.
You take care. Here, come on.

1238
01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:46,582
Um. Say bye-bye, Chris.
Bye.

1239
01:11:46,584 --> 01:11:48,334
Bye, Christopher.

1240
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:50,018

What, uh...?
To Candlestick?

1242
01:11:51,672 --> 01:11:53,022
We're going now.
Come with us.

1243
01:11:53,024 --> 01:11:54,139
Where are your seats?

1244
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:56,893
Oh, we've...
We're... upper deck.

1245
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:57,810
We got a box.
Come on.

1246
01:11:57,812 --> 01:11:59,061
You wanna sit in a box?

1247
01:11:59,063 --> 01:12:00,313
No.

1248
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:01,297
Well...

1249
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:02,815
It's not actually a box.

1250
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:05,351
It's... It's, um...
a private section.

1251
01:12:05,353 --> 01:12:07,586
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

1252
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,088
Okay.

1253
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,607
Okay. Kids in the back.

1254
01:12:12,925 --> 01:12:15,394
Hey, why don't you just
put that in your car?

1255
01:12:15,396 --> 01:12:16,878
Um...

1256
01:12:18,197 --> 01:12:19,682
Yeah, okay...
Uh, sure. Sure.

1257
01:12:19,684 --> 01:12:21,367
We don't have a car.

1259
01:12:21,953 --> 01:12:24,203
Oh, my G...
What happened?

1260
01:12:24,205 --> 01:12:25,687
I think I got stung by a bee.

1261
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:27,924
You all right?
Oh. Yeah.

1262
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:30,175
Goodness. I'm fine.
You're not allergic or anything?

1263
01:12:30,177 --> 01:12:31,360
No, no, no. Aah.

1264
01:12:31,362 --> 01:12:32,678
Where'd he get you?

1265
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,280
Just, like, right at the, uh,
back of my head. Aah.

1266
01:12:35,282 --> 01:12:37,800
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

1267
01:12:37,802 --> 01:12:39,818
Does it hurt?
Uh, Christopher, I'm fine.

1268
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,937
Let me see.

1269
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,173

Hey, that's my pleasure, Chris.

1289
01:13:35,192 --> 01:13:37,109
And, uh, Mr. Ribbon,
I also wanna thank you

1290
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:38,594
for giving me the opportunity

1291
01:13:38,596 --> 01:13:40,395
to discuss the asset management

capabilities of Dean Witter,

1293
01:13:41,782 --> 01:13:44,049
which we believe
to be far superior

1294
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:46,852
to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

1295
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:49,054
And, uh, really, I think
you're gonna be blown away.

1296
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:51,957
Point blank, Dean Witter
needs to be managing

1298
01:13:54,295 --> 01:13:55,777
You know, I didn't
have any notion

1299
01:13:55,779 --> 01:13:57,062
that you were new over there.

1300
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:59,465
I mean, I like you, but...
there's not a chance

1301
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:00,949
I'm gonna let you
direct our fund.

1302
01:14:00,951 --> 01:14:03,119
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

1303
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:04,503
So... you know,
come on, relax.

1304
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:06,404

Go, go, go!

01:19:46,996 --> 01:19:48,864
Chris?
Yes.

1396
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:50,932
Dr. Telm can't get back
to meet you.

1397
01:19:50,934 --> 01:19:52,868
I'm sorry.

1398
01:20:03,963 --> 01:20:07,149
Where are we going now?

1399
01:20:07,151 --> 01:20:10,568
Gotta, uh... We gotta
see somebody else.

1400
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:14,439
I'm tired.

1401
01:20:16,626 --> 01:20:19,143
I know.

1402
01:20:23,482 --> 01:20:25,734
Um...

1403
01:20:25,736 --> 01:20:28,069
Doesn't seem to be, uh,
functioning...

1404
01:20:28,071 --> 01:20:29,905
right now.

1405
01:20:29,907 --> 01:20:31,456
I have to go now, Chris.

1406
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:33,858
No. No, no. Uh...
Just give me a second.

1407
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:35,961
I'm sure I can... I'm gonna
be able to figure it out.

1408
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:40,932
Chris. Chris. Just
come back when it's working.

1409
01:20:40,934 --> 01:20:42,584
No. No. I... I...
I have to fix it now.

1410
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:43,968
No.

1411
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:46,972
Look, I'll still be putting
money into the office, then...

1412
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:49,407
all right?

1413
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:50,626
I really have to go, Chris.

1414
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:54,629
Thank you. Thank you.

1415
01:20:54,631 --> 01:20:56,481
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1416
01:20:56,483 --> 01:20:58,383
I'll see you soon.

1417
01:21:50,403 --> 01:21:51,853
Why are our things here?

1418
01:21:53,839 --> 01:21:55,440
Dad.

1419
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:39,984
Let's go. Come on.
Where?

1420
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:43,405
Come on.
Just out of here.

1421
01:22:43,407 --> 01:22:44,856
Why?

1422
01:22:44,858 --> 01:22:47,158
We can't stay here tonight.
Yes, we can. Open the door!

1423
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,794
Hey. Did you hear
what I said?

1424
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:49,978
Let's go.
Open the door!

1425
01:22:52,715 --> 01:22:56,802
Hey. Did you hear
what I said? Stop it.

1426
01:22:56,804 --> 01:22:58,420
Stop it.

1427
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,525
Come on.
Come on.

1428
01:23:13,102 --> 01:23:14,552
Come on.

1429
01:23:31,603 --> 01:23:34,089
<i>Wayne!</i>

1430
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:36,191
Wayne!

1431
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:45,750
Wayne!

1432
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:04,919
Get up. Stand up.
Come on.

1433
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,153
Where are we going?

1434
01:24:25,057 --> 01:24:26,758
Dad! Where are
we going?

1435
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,326
I don't know.

1436
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:46,010
It's not a time machine.

1437
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:47,195
Dad.

1438
01:24:48,147 --> 01:24:49,781
It's not a time machine.

1439
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:51,266
The guy said
it was a time machine.

1440
01:24:51,268 --> 01:24:53,235
It's not a time machine.
He was wrong.

1441
01:24:53,237 --> 01:24:54,468
What guy?

1442
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,088
The guy.
He was at the park.

1443
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,589
He said it was a time machine.

1444
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,680
Yes, it is.

1445
01:25:07,233 --> 01:25:08,967
No, it's not.

1446
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:12,954
It is.
No, it's not.

1447
01:25:19,061 --> 01:25:22,563
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1448
01:25:26,769 --> 01:25:28,052
You wanna push it?

1449
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:34,092
Okay.

1450
01:25:35,694 --> 01:25:37,361
Come on.

1451
01:25:38,848 --> 01:25:40,831
Come on, man.

1452
01:25:46,071 --> 01:25:47,422
Right here.

1453
01:25:47,424 --> 01:25:49,591
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1454
01:25:49,593 --> 01:25:51,760
I don't know.
Someplace from before.

1455
01:25:51,762 --> 01:25:53,595
You gotta close your eyes.

1456
01:25:53,597 --> 01:25:55,780
You close your eyes.
I wanna see.

1457
01:25:57,768 --> 01:26:00,017
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1458
01:26:05,842 --> 01:26:07,959
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1459
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:10,895
It takes a few seconds.

1460
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:15,082
Oh, my goodness.

1461
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:16,751
W... Open, open,
open!

1462
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:20,238
Whoa.

1463
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,173
What is it?

1464
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:23,174
Dinosaurs.

1465
01:26:23,176 --> 01:26:24,359
Where?

1466
01:26:24,361 --> 01:26:27,078
You don't see
all these dinosaurs?

1467
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,630
Look around.

1468
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:30,465
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1469
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:32,717
Wow.

1470
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,451
Do you see 'em?

1471
01:26:33,453 --> 01:26:35,036
Yeah.

1472
01:26:35,038 --> 01:26:36,421
Wait. Come on,
come on, come on.

1473
01:26:36,423 --> 01:26:37,538
Wait... Watch out.

1474
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,056
What is it?
Don't step in the fire.

1475
01:26:39,058 --> 01:26:40,525
We're cavemen.

1476
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:42,927
We need this fire,
'cause there's no electricity,

1477
01:26:42,929 --> 01:26:44,780
and it's cold out here, okay?

1478
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:47,465
Watch out! Watch out!
Whoa! Oh, my good... A <i>T. rex.</i>

1479
01:26:47,467 --> 01:26:49,451
That's... Get your stuff.
Get your stuff.

1480
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:51,153
Get... Get it...

1481
01:26:51,155 --> 01:26:52,387
Get up here.

1482
01:26:52,389 --> 01:26:53,755
We gotta find someplace safe.

1483
01:26:53,757 --> 01:26:54,906
Like what?

1484
01:26:54,908 --> 01:26:57,842
Um... we need a cave.

1485
01:26:57,844 --> 01:26:59,044
A cave?

1486
01:26:59,046 --> 01:27:00,661
We gotta find
a cave. Come on.

1487
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:02,130
Okay.
Come on, come on.

1488
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:06,301
Wait... Watch your
back! Look out.

1489
01:27:06,303 --> 01:27:08,486
Here it is. Here's
a cave. Come on.

1490
01:27:08,488 --> 01:27:10,588
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1491
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:11,606
Whoa.

1492
01:27:11,608 --> 01:27:13,091
Go ahead.
Get in.

1493
01:27:13,093 --> 01:27:14,926
Hurry, hurry. Hurry.

1494
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:20,464
Are we safe?

1495
01:27:20,466 --> 01:27:22,667
Yeah, I think so.

1496
01:28:30,469 --> 01:28:31,419
Hey.

1497
01:28:33,489 --> 01:28:35,373
How you doing? Jay?
I'm doing good.

1498
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:36,892
How you, uh, getting along?

1499
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:37,876
Good. I'm good.

1500
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:39,427
You doing good?

1501
01:28:39,429 --> 01:28:41,396
How you doing?
I'm doing great.

1502
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:44,882
Where you going?

1503
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:46,801
Oh. Um...

1504
01:28:48,004 --> 01:28:49,754
I, uh... Sacramento.

1505
01:28:49,756 --> 01:28:50,938
'Cause, um...

1506
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:54,092
I'm trying to move
a couple guys that... From...

1507
01:28:54,094 --> 01:28:57,228
They're at... At PacBell, and I'm
trying to bring them over...

1508
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,630
Get them over to us.

1509
01:28:58,632 --> 01:29:00,782
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1510
01:29:00,784 --> 01:29:02,784
Awesome.

1511
01:29:02,786 --> 01:29:04,602
Hey, let 'em win a round.

1512
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:11,976
Deborah. Someone's
asking for you.

1513
01:29:11,978 --> 01:29:13,661
Where?
He's outside.

1514
01:29:13,663 --> 01:29:15,213
Please come with me.

1515
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:24,655
Hi.

1516
01:29:24,657 --> 01:29:26,591
How you doing?
Um...

1517
01:29:27,976 --> 01:29:29,660
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

1518
01:29:29,662 --> 01:29:30,612
Um...

1519
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:33,949
We need a room.

1520
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:34,983
Um...

1521
01:29:34,985 --> 01:29:36,801
Just until I can...

1522
01:29:36,803 --> 01:29:38,169
fix this and sell it.

1523
01:29:38,171 --> 01:29:40,672
There's just some glasswork.
Let me stop you right there.

1524
01:29:40,674 --> 01:29:43,074
I wish I could help you...
This is my son, Christopher.

1525
01:29:43,076 --> 01:29:44,893
He's 5 years old.

1526
01:29:44,895 --> 01:29:46,010
Hi, baby.

1527
01:29:46,012 --> 01:29:47,295
We need someplace to stay.

1528
01:29:47,297 --> 01:29:49,146
Okay. And I would
love to help you,

1529
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:50,815
but we don't take men here.

1530
01:29:50,817 --> 01:29:52,266
It's only women and children.

1531
01:29:52,268 --> 01:29:53,568
Now, he can stay here,

1532
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:55,620
but you have to find
someplace else to go.

1533
01:29:55,622 --> 01:29:57,205
We gotta stay together.

1534
01:29:57,207 --> 01:29:58,589
We got... We... We're...

1535
01:29:58,591 --> 01:30:00,692
Okay. Okay, listen.
You gotta have someplace...

1536
01:30:00,694 --> 01:30:03,928
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1537
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:05,679
So you hurry up,
'cause there's a line.

1538
01:30:05,681 --> 01:30:06,998
Where is it?
Where? Come on.

1539
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,566
E-E-Ellis
and Jones.

1540
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:46,470
Hey! Hey, everybody.

1541
01:30:46,472 --> 01:30:49,807
We have four spots left,
and that's all.

1542
01:30:49,809 --> 01:30:51,275
Man.

1543
01:30:51,277 --> 01:30:53,395
Hey. Come on, man.

1544
01:30:53,397 --> 01:30:54,512
Come on.
Come on, what?

1545
01:30:54,514 --> 01:30:56,580
Hey, that's my spot.
Back up.

1546
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:58,732
Come on, don't do this to me. Don't...
Back up!

1547
01:31:01,304 --> 01:31:03,321
Dad! Dad!

1548
01:31:03,323 --> 01:31:05,657
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1549
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:07,441
Stop! Stop!
Come here! Come here!

1550
01:31:07,443 --> 01:31:10,045
Get out of the line,
both of you. Both of you.

1551
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,764
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be here on time.

1552
01:31:12,766 --> 01:31:14,999
I got here on time.
I was in line.

1553
01:31:15,001 --> 01:31:16,968
I came from work, I got my son.

1554
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:19,704
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1555
01:31:19,706 --> 01:31:21,756
He sliced in front
of him in line.

1556
01:31:21,758 --> 01:31:22,424
Who did?

1557
01:31:22,426 --> 01:31:24,074
He did.
He did.

1558
01:31:24,076 --> 01:31:25,593
Come on.
Come on, Rodney.

1559
01:31:25,595 --> 01:31:27,712
Come on. Let's go.
Get out of line.

1560
01:31:37,839 --> 01:31:39,089
That's it.
No more.

1561
01:31:46,865 --> 01:31:48,283
What's your favorite color?

1562
01:31:48,285 --> 01:31:50,018
Green.

1563
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,502
Green?
Mm-hm.

1564
01:31:51,504 --> 01:31:53,154
What do you like that's green?

1565
01:31:53,156 --> 01:31:54,689
Trees.

1566
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:55,707
Trees.

1567
01:31:55,709 --> 01:31:57,925
What else?

1568
01:31:57,927 --> 01:31:59,109
Holly.

1569
01:32:01,147 --> 01:32:03,314
Holly. What's holly?

1570
01:32:03,316 --> 01:32:05,500
The Christmas stuff.

1571
01:32:05,502 --> 01:32:07,201
Ah. Christmas
stuff.

1572
01:32:08,653 --> 01:32:10,405
What's that?

1573
01:32:13,642 --> 01:32:16,493
I guess they want us
to go to sleep.

1574
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:23,885
There you go.

1575
01:32:23,887 --> 01:32:25,136
We gotta...

1576
01:32:25,138 --> 01:32:28,523
make sure Captain America's
warm in there.

1577
01:32:28,525 --> 01:32:30,475
Can he breathe?

1578
01:32:30,477 --> 01:32:31,743
He's good?
Yeah.

1579
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:35,363
I gotta go work on the scanner...
Don't go.

1580
01:32:35,365 --> 01:32:38,783
No, no, no. I'm gonna be...
I'll be right outside the door.

1581
01:32:38,785 --> 01:32:41,252
All right? I'm just...
I'm gonna be right there...

1582
01:32:41,254 --> 01:32:43,121
I'll leave the door open
a little bit.

1583
01:32:43,123 --> 01:32:46,324
And I'll be able to
hear you if you call me.

1584
01:32:46,326 --> 01:32:48,743
I wanna go home.

1585
01:32:50,912 --> 01:32:53,047
But... that's why
I gotta, uh,

1586
01:32:53,049 --> 01:32:54,915
work on the scanner.

1587
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:57,568
All right?

1588
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,737
I'm gonna go
out there. Um...

1589
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:02,840
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1590
01:33:02,842 --> 01:33:04,192
And...

1591
01:33:04,194 --> 01:33:06,093
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1592
01:33:06,095 --> 01:33:07,695
All right?

1593
01:33:07,697 --> 01:33:09,197
All right.

1594
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,732
You gotta trust me, okay?

1595
01:33:11,734 --> 01:33:13,067
You gotta trust me.

1596
01:33:14,604 --> 01:33:16,120
You gotta...
Trust you. I trust...

1597
01:33:16,122 --> 01:33:17,471
You gotta...

1598
01:33:17,473 --> 01:33:19,123
I trust you.

1599
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:20,408
I trust...
I can't hear you.

1600
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:23,845
I trust you.

1601
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:27,031
All right.
Give me a kiss.

1602
01:33:29,768 --> 01:33:30,801
Mwah.

1603
01:33:40,312 --> 01:33:41,829
I'll just be a little
while, okay?

1604
01:33:41,831 --> 01:33:43,481
All right.

1605
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:44,899
I'll be right here.

1606
01:33:44,901 --> 01:33:46,350
Okay.

1607
01:33:46,352 --> 01:33:47,468
Can you still hear me?

1608
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,820
Yeah.

1609
01:33:48,822 --> 01:33:50,521
Can you hear me?
Yeah.

1610
01:33:50,523 --> 01:33:52,223
Do you trust me?
Yeah.

1611
01:34:40,339 --> 01:34:42,106
Yeah.
Like that?

1612
01:34:42,108 --> 01:34:43,374
Yeah. Put that one...

1613
01:34:43,376 --> 01:34:44,441
Then you go like that.

1614
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:47,294
Is that okay?

1615
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,730
I don't know.
What do you think?

1616
01:34:49,732 --> 01:34:50,615
It's good.

1617
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,201
Let's go.
Get your stuff.

1618
01:34:55,387 --> 01:34:57,038
Hey, why don't you leave it?

1619
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,722
We can't.

1620
01:34:58,724 --> 01:35:01,059
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1621
01:35:01,061 --> 01:35:02,209
Go.

1622
01:35:07,966 --> 01:35:09,550
Hey, Chris.

1623
01:35:09,552 --> 01:35:11,269
Hey. Good morning,
Mr. Frakesh.

1624
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:12,836
What's up?

1625
01:35:13,888 --> 01:35:15,273
Work trip.

1626
01:35:15,275 --> 01:35:17,741
Your wife, Martha,
works at PacBell also, correct?

1627
01:35:17,743 --> 01:35:20,078
Yes, she does.
And you guys are both looking

1628
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,462
to retire at about
the same time?

1629
01:35:21,464 --> 01:35:23,681
We'd like to retire and
maintain the same lifestyle

1630
01:35:23,683 --> 01:35:25,883
without paying a lot of taxes.
So basically,

1631
01:35:25,885 --> 01:35:28,385
you don't want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1632
01:35:28,387 --> 01:35:29,636
Nobody's.

1633
01:35:29,638 --> 01:35:31,706

1688
01:39:13,345 --> 01:39:15,046
you have to go somewhere?

1689

I have to go somewhere.

01:39:16,599 --> 01:39:18,198

1691
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,084

Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

Chris. You got
five bucks?

1708

sleep in a room with me

1746
01:42:47,577 --> 01:42:48,892
for the rest of your life.

1747
01:42:50,578 --> 01:42:53,047
I don't mind.
Hm.

1748
01:42:53,049 --> 01:42:54,815
Yeah, you will.

1749
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:13,667
Why don't you get
some sleep, okay?

1750
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:15,118
Okay.

1751
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:18,439
Warm enough?
Yeah.

1752
01:43:18,441 --> 01:43:20,107
All right.
All right.

1753
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:25,112
Did Mom leave because of me?

1754
01:43:28,466 --> 01:43:29,867
What?

1755
01:43:29,869 --> 01:43:32,969
Did Mom leave because of me?

1756
01:43:37,225 --> 01:43:38,976
Don't... Don't even...

1757
01:43:38,978 --> 01:43:41,011
think something like that.

1758
01:43:42,864 --> 01:43:45,165
Mom left because of Mom.

1759
01:43:45,167 --> 01:43:47,668
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1760
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:50,470
Okay.

1761
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:02,182
You're a good papa.

1762
01:44:09,707 --> 01:44:11,041
All right, go to sleep.

1763
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,528
I love you.
I love you too.

1764
01:45:12,003 --> 01:45:14,337
So far so good, Chris.

1765
01:45:20,077 --> 01:45:22,846
It works.
All right. Thank you very much.

1766
01:45:22,848 --> 01:45:27,101
<i>Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Four more weeks of oxygen.</i>

1767
01:45:27,103 --> 01:45:31,471
One hundred,
20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1768
01:45:31,473 --> 01:45:34,174
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1769
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,344
Anything else?
No. This is good.

1770
01:45:37,346 --> 01:45:38,795
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1771
01:45:38,797 --> 01:45:40,063
You ready?
Yup.

1772
01:45:40,065 --> 01:45:41,114
Bye.

1773
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:44,718
Are we going to
the church place?

1774
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:48,421
No.
Where are we going then?

1775
01:45:48,423 --> 01:45:51,258
Probably stay at a hotel.
A hotel?

1776
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,442
Well, just for the night.

1777
01:45:52,444 --> 01:45:55,462
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1778
01:45:55,464 --> 01:45:57,414
Hm.
No, thank you.

1779
01:45:57,416 --> 01:46:00,134
Ever?
I-I hope not.

1780
01:46:00,136 --> 01:46:01,818
Why not?

1781
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:04,821
Well, 'cause some things are fun
the first time you do 'em,

1782
01:46:04,823 --> 01:46:07,357
and then not so much the next.

1783
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:10,644
Like the bus?
Yeah. Like the bus.

1784
01:46:10,646 --> 01:46:14,214
<i>I'm sorry.
I shouldn't laugh, should I?</i>

1785
01:46:17,403 --> 01:46:20,987
<i>He doesn't know
where it is though.</i>

1786
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:22,740
<i>Didn't you ever
want to have a home</i>

1787
01:46:22,742 --> 01:46:24,808
<i>of your own like other people?</i>

1788
01:46:26,878 --> 01:46:28,895
<i>Sometimes when
we're moving at night,</i>

1789
01:46:28,897 --> 01:46:32,015
<i>we pass houses with
lights and people.</i>

1790
01:46:32,017 --> 01:46:34,134
<i>Sometimes you can
hear them laugh.</i>

1791
01:46:39,358 --> 01:46:42,726
<i>The next day... after work...</i>

1792
01:46:42,728 --> 01:46:45,362
<i>we just went to the beach.</i>

1793
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:47,464
<i>Far away from anything.</i>

1794
01:46:47,466 --> 01:46:49,049
<i>Everything.</i>

1795
01:46:49,051 --> 01:46:50,783
<i>Just Christopher and me.</i>

1796
01:46:52,337 --> 01:46:54,905
Did you see me?
Yep.

1797
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:58,241
<i>Far away from...
buses and noise</i>

1798
01:46:58,243 --> 01:47:01,161
<i>and a constant disappointment</i>

1799
01:47:01,163 --> 01:47:02,862
<i>in my 10-gallon head.</i>

1800
01:47:04,783 --> 01:47:07,534
<i>And myself.</i>

1801
01:47:07,536 --> 01:47:09,436
Chris, thank you very much.
Thank you, Dean.

1802
01:47:09,438 --> 01:47:12,072
Take care, Chris.
Hey, you made the right moves here.

1803
01:47:12,074 --> 01:47:13,590
Thanks, Chris.

1804
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:18,629
<i>Because when I was young
and I'd get an A</i>

1805
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:21,197
<i>on a history test
or whatever...</i>

1806
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:22,866
<i>I'd get this good feeling</i>

1807
01:47:22,868 --> 01:47:25,435
<i>about all the things
that I could be.</i>

1808
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:31,308
<i>And then I never became
any of them.</i>

1809
01:47:38,783 --> 01:47:40,383
Hey, Chris.

1810
01:47:40,385 --> 01:47:41,568
Hey.

1811
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,404
How are you doing, Jay?
I'm doing fine.

1812
01:47:44,406 --> 01:47:46,739
Rumor has it you signed
31 accounts for us

1813
01:47:46,741 --> 01:47:48,759
from Pacific Bell.

1814
01:47:48,761 --> 01:47:50,177
Yeah, I, uh...

1815
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:52,045
met some guys at a ball game,

1816
01:47:52,047 --> 01:47:53,730
got some cards
I've been working.

1817
01:47:53,732 --> 01:47:56,132
I guess.

1818
01:47:59,003 --> 01:48:01,438
So... one more day.

1819
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,607
Getting nervous?

1820
01:48:03,609 --> 01:48:06,109
No, I'm... I'm okay.
Yeah?

1821
01:48:06,111 --> 01:48:08,479
Listen, whatever happens...

1822
01:48:08,481 --> 01:48:11,080
you've done
a fantastic job, Chris.

1823
01:48:11,082 --> 01:48:12,900
I mean that.

1824
01:48:12,902 --> 01:48:15,134
Take care of yourself.

1825
01:48:30,386 --> 01:48:33,787
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1826
01:48:33,789 --> 01:48:35,889
Yes, sir. Just, uh, calling
to thank you very much

1827
01:48:35,891 --> 01:48:39,025
for your support
at last month's seminar.

1828
01:48:39,027 --> 01:48:41,095
Uh... Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely.

1829
01:48:41,097 --> 01:48:41,995
Yes, sir.

1830
01:48:43,164 --> 01:48:45,015
No, sir, that's it.

1831
01:48:45,017 --> 01:48:47,200
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.

1832
01:48:48,803 --> 01:48:50,220
Chris.

1833
01:48:50,222 --> 01:48:51,738
Come.

1834
01:49:19,016 --> 01:49:22,302
Hi, Chris.
Mr. Frohm. Good to see you.

1835
01:49:23,187 --> 01:49:25,639
Nice shirt.
Heh. Thank you, sir.

1836
01:49:25,641 --> 01:49:27,090
Chris.
Hi, Jay.

1837
01:49:27,092 --> 01:49:28,424
Chris.

1838
01:49:28,426 --> 01:49:31,595
Chris. Sit down,
please.

1839
01:49:34,231 --> 01:49:35,815
I thought I'd, uh...

1840
01:49:35,817 --> 01:49:37,617
wear a shirt today.

1841
01:49:37,619 --> 01:49:40,753
Um... you know,
being the last day and all.

1842
01:49:40,755 --> 01:49:41,905
Well, thank you.

1843
01:49:41,907 --> 01:49:44,441
Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1844
01:49:44,443 --> 01:49:46,960
But, um...

1845
01:49:46,962 --> 01:49:49,946
wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1846
01:49:49,948 --> 01:49:53,250
Because tomorrow is going
to be your first day.

1847
01:49:53,252 --> 01:49:57,204
If you'd like to
work here as a broker.

1848
01:49:58,122 --> 01:50:00,541
Would you like that, Chris?

1849
01:50:00,543 --> 01:50:02,709
Yes, sir.

1850
01:50:02,711 --> 01:50:05,312
Good. We couldn't
be happier.

1851
01:50:07,099 --> 01:50:08,614
So...

1852
01:50:08,616 --> 01:50:09,849
welcome.

1853
01:50:12,053 --> 01:50:14,054
Was it as easy as it looked?

1854
01:50:14,056 --> 01:50:17,373
No, sir. No.
No, sir, it wasn't.

1855
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:18,942
Well...

1856
01:50:18,944 --> 01:50:22,112
Good luck, Chris.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1857
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:28,285
Welcome, sir.

1858
01:50:28,287 --> 01:50:30,220
Oh, Chris.

1859
01:50:32,523 --> 01:50:34,757
I almost forgot.

1860
01:50:36,996 --> 01:50:38,295
Thank you.

1861
01:50:58,983 --> 01:51:01,818
<i>This part of my life...</i>

1862
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:04,120
<i>This little part...</i>

1863
01:51:07,341 --> 01:51:09,225
<i>is called "Happiness."</i>

1864
01:51:56,724 --> 01:52:00,310
Christopher. Come here, man.
Come here.

1865
01:52:29,206 --> 01:52:32,659
<i>So... how many...</i>

1866
01:52:32,661 --> 01:52:34,660
planets are there?

1867
01:52:34,662 --> 01:52:37,097
Um... seven.
Seven?

1868
01:52:37,099 --> 01:52:38,548
Mm-hm.

1869
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:40,283
Nine.
Okay.

1870
01:52:40,285 --> 01:52:42,369
Um...

1871
01:52:42,371 --> 01:52:44,837
Who's the king of the jungle?

1872
01:52:44,839 --> 01:52:47,857
Gorilla.
A gorilla?

1873
01:52:47,859 --> 01:52:49,442
The gorilla?
Mm-hm.

1874
01:52:49,444 --> 01:52:51,328
No. Lion.

1875
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:53,880
Oh, yeah.
Lion, lion, lion.

1876
01:52:55,967 --> 01:52:59,185
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1877
01:52:59,187 --> 01:53:00,337
What? Who's there?

1878
01:53:00,339 --> 01:53:02,489
Shelby.
Shelby who?

1879
01:53:02,491 --> 01:53:05,575
<i>♪ Shelby coming around
The mountain when she comes ♪</i>

1880

Nobody.
Nobody who?

Nobody who?

1883
01:53:15,136 --> 01:53:17,270
Oh.

1884
01:53:17,272 --> 01:53:19,839
