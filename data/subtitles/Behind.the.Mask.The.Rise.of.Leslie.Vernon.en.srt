00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:24,475
Welcome to Glenn Echo a community
similar the image of a postcard

2
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:29,370
and that represents thousands of small
dispersed towns for the whole america of the north.

3
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:35,013
But there will be a mark of events
indescriptiveis that threaten the peacefulness

4
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:38,949
of this celestial world? Events
similar that devastated similar communities

5
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:43,521
during more than 30 years.
You recount them are very known.

6
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:47,828
In Crystal Lake, a demented
call Jason Borges murdered

7
00:02:48,063 --> 00:02:52,864
dozens during more than 3 decades,
leaving a devastated community and it deserts.

8
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:56,326
Fearing his/her next appearance.

9
00:02:56,371 --> 00:03:01,672
Here, in the street Elm in the high community
of Springwood, the repeated attacks

10
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:06,469
of a murderer they left scars
so deep that some say that

11
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,839
of only to dream with them
he/she could die when sleeping.

12
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:13,843
Excuse, he/she wanted to know if it was able to
to do some questions on

13
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,418
his/her old neighbor Frederick...

14
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:21,049
In Haden Field, a prodigal son
call Michael Myers will have attacked of

15
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:26,058
he/she forms similar in Halloween in almost
four occasions.

16
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:30,964
For these neighbors,
Halloween will never be same.

17
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,492
Who are these homems?
How do they make the one what do?

18
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,997
That relationship exists among
these towns and Glenn Echo?

19
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:45,403
Here we would have another contact with
the next incarnation of the evil.

20
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:59,521
20 years ago in this abandoned farm,
a boy was thrown in this fall of it longs for.

21
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:06,923
That boy this to the point of to avenge
of the town that murdered him/it.

22
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,357
He knows, he/she says him, because and the father
of that terror wave impelled by the

23
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:20,137
desire of Borges, Myers and Crooger.

24
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,033
His/her name and Leslie Vernon.

25
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:34,411
Very well, good work.

26
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:37,717
Did pitchfork seem? He/she seemed an amateur.

27
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,382
I try to find my own voice...

28
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:59,798
- No and possible.
- I don't think so this home.

29
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:05,141
He/she waits, he/she looks there at the hut.

30
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:09,372
Sr. Vernon! Hello.

31
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:14,613
- Did you see him/it?
- What this to happen?

32
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:18,513
Wait. In the second
I step, in the window.

33
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:21,948
- I didn't see him/it.
- Hello.

34
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:27,824
Sr. Vernon... I am me Taylor.

35
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:32,523
We had talked on the phone.

36
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,870
Sr. Vernon.

37
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,642
I am Leslie Vernon, hello.

38
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,672
- Can we put him/her a microphone?
- Of course yes.

39
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,680
This and the room. Them
they are Church and Zowie.

40
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:02,188
Here they are my beauties.
You don't go for the near finger.

41
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:05,686
You can caress this.

42
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,220
I am very bad with them.

43
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:12,199
I don't feed them during days.

44
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:15,225
It is die never.

45
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:19,706
The turtles are well
like this, they are calm.

46
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,033
Yes, the plants and the turtles.

47
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:29,905
I only have mascots that he/she can eat.

48
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:35,052
This and the best part.

49
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,846
The amount of books and incredible.

50
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,656
I didn't have time of actualiza-los.

51
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:48,963
I saw many manuals and books of texts.

52
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,959
- Yes, and displeased. . .
- Would you say that most has...?

53
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:55,463
Relationship with my work?

54
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:58,495
He/she would not suggest to read on anatomy.

55
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:05,411
Here they are the entertaining ones.Coperfield, Houdini,
Slight of Hand, escape Tacticas...

56
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,040
- Do they want to see magic tricks?
- Yes.

57
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:11,072
- Do you have letters?
- No.

58
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,950
Do you have letters?

59
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:17,477
- Because he/she would have them...?
- He/she looks in your pocket.

60
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:21,814
Rays!

61
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,893
- How did you do?
- They are alone tricks, tricks...

62
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,322
I don't say where I saw him/it.

63
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,330
In the reality, he/she refers the
to scare innocent people?

64
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,729
No!

65
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,902
Because it finds grace?

66
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:49,541
You, came to me to find as and
that people as Mike and Chucky, Freddy

67
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,749
they do what do...

68
00:07:52,784 --> 00:08:00,280
I cannot explain to you at once the!
You have to understand the process.

69
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:03,851
Or not. It depends on you.

70
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,727
He/she tells us...

71
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,325
...how do you make him/it?

72
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:15,803
- Let us go.
- Where?

73
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:19,263
My house.

74
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:25,009
You know her recounts of as me
did they throw in the waterfalls?

75
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,782
In I have a birthday him of my death, the
boys dared to pass the night

76
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,484
in this abandoned farm.

77
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,013
This year... I will reappear.

78
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,092
Home sweet home.

79
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:46,527
- And owner of this?
- This bass credits.

80
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,625
If I want, I can claim him/it.

81
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,458
We came in the summer.

82
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:58,327
Now it polices takes care her/it once and for all of her
in when. Almost always this empty one.

83
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:05,038
Because you don't live here?
Instead of living so far.

84
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,407
Because I am not able to.

85
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:14,044
Since in Glenn Echo crem
what did die... do you remember?

86
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:19,050
If here to reappear me not
they can see to cut the grass.

87
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:29,291
- That serves you?
- It cheers me that you ask.

88
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:32,131
First step...

89
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:36,035
...I need a hook for mine
legend.Let us see in the back yard of the stretchers.

90
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:42,432
Dark.

91
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,835
As a closet.

92
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:49,137
It took years so that it is like this.

93
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:55,218
If you go ties the end in one night
of full moon and burrows the ground...

94
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,214
...you had noticed that the earth and humida.

95
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:05,918
Impossible of crossing.

96
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:14,032
Still better, if you have enough value...

97
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,269
...to enter in the back yard
in a full moon night.

98
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:26,074
To half night and so
calm as the death.

99
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,846
You can hear mine
mother among them hoists.

100
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:47,186
I am to play.

101
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,558
Today not.

102
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,592
Though it lacks one month.

103
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:01,871
Everything doesn't imagine him/it
that I have to workout.

104
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:07,703
Because so much?

105
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:11,914
You have to be capable of
to run as a gazelle.

106
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:15,146
Without weakening.

107
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:19,987
It imagines if you walk
while the others flee.

108
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,818
You have that reach them.

109
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:28,988
And difficult.

110
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:33,425
Let us continue.

111
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:40,737
Once you selected
the place, we began the step 2.

112
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:42,904
To find the appropriate group.

113
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:45,935
Do you refer sacrifice them?

114
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:51,848
"Bapa, potato... "As you want.

115
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:54,119
No and as easy as leaning.

116
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:57,747
They think that you wake up a guile and you are
obsecado in a girl, murderous

117
00:11:58,156 --> 00:12:00,919
all killing the ones that intervenes...

118
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,088
- He/she happens a lot with you.
- No and like this.

119
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:09,965
The girl and important but he/she needs of
to have a past that supports.

120
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:14,793
As those there... they are our reason.

121
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:20,471
Boys athletic, attractive.
With a healthy appearance.

122
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:27,677
Them, there... they don't move
so fast when you threaten them.

123
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,106
They are good to take the double bill.

124
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,284
He/she looks at that brute!

125
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,915
You have to find a group where
all are together. He/she calls him/it THE or B.

126
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:43,124
And a '' survivor '' that unites them.

127
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:45,395
What and a survivor?

128
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:48,421
One finishes of the it elaborates.

129
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:55,336
A girl that is capable of
to flee in the end of the day.

130
00:12:55,737 --> 00:13:00,538
- What does have this girl?
- It is virgin.

131
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:05,935
- How do you know?
- I don't know. . .

132
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:10,474
...he/she looks at her. And a virgin.

133
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,941
No these to play?

134
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,712
By God... did you see that? Did you see?

135
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,747
- He/she tells me that you were hit.
- I filmed him/it.

136
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,652
Did you see how we have ourselves given well?

137
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,753
Then, you followed her before.

138
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:30,960
And the first time that I see her.
I already have a chosen girl.

139
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:36,029
I only swallow them so that they have
a notion of what did.

140
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:42,106
If he/she had not chosen her
already, we would be very late.

141
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,548
And as the kitchen programs that
he/she already has the foot in the ready oven.

142
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:51,916
Did you see those programs?

143
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:54,943
Forget him/it.

144
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:04,626
From now on, we are working with something
more specifies for my hole in the farm.

145
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:09,658
And the hour of the truth.
Everything has to leave well.

146
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:13,225
So that we are here?

147
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:17,765
And her, same oh.

148
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,073
Know Kelly Curtis. Mine
hopes and dreams are oh.

149
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:25,312
- Is it virgin?
- Yes.

150
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:28,746
- Can you speak to her?
- In no way.

151
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,050
We cannot approach, her
this out of our reach.

152
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:50,290
Here we go. I wait that the
cameras are to work.

153
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:57,236
And the step 3. Known as approach.

154
00:14:57,706 --> 00:15:04,406
Every night, Kelly comes out for this
door. And it deposits the spillings here.

155
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:10,407
For that, it uses this brick
to maintain the open door.

156
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,310
Do you see that tied him/it with fishing thread?

157
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:16,287
Observe. And very strong.

158
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:19,313
I usually make him/it me.
But, since these here...

159
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,024
...you can help me.

160
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:27,963
I will be seated there in the darkness.
Kelly had come out to deposit the spillings.

161
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:34,064
I will leave the darkness,
she had thought that he/she saw something.

162
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:37,266
He/she will give some steps ties me...

163
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:45,076
...and you remove of the thread, the brick
he/she slides and clamor the door.

164
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,671
She turns...

165
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:55,113
I return the darkness. She turns.

166
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,315
- And you disappear.
- It is like this.

167
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:04,183
I think well.

168
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:08,221
Here we go.

169
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:21,098
- Incredible.
- How do you get?

170
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:25,005
- Todd continues to film.
- Here I am.

171
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:28,913
And completely. He/she gives me your fist. The elbow now.

172
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:32,641
The fist, the elbow.

173
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:35,953
And you... the heart.

174
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:41,218
Well we leave.

175
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,353
Do you think he/she saw me?
Maybe no, no this holds.

176
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:48,563
I want scare her a little...

177
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:51,834
...that he/she sees the proximity of a problem.

178
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,859
We go, he/she enters.

179
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,462
- Who and that person oh?
- Who knows.

180
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,635
Where do we go now?

181
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,769
We will see two my friends.

182
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:06,780
Eugene and his/her wife Jamy highway below.

183
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:10,215
Eugene and a professional in this.
This removed.

184
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:14,676
He/she taught me a lot.

185
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:18,879
I think and good that you see them.

186
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:24,024
He/she will give them a perspective. One
bridge between the past and the future.

187
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:31,162
You ally that Jamie "this hot" one.

188
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:32,896
Hello!

189
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:37,838
- That is treated?
- They are alone boys to follow me.

190
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,141
Hello, they are the people that
you had me counted. Enter.

191
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:47,342
Done this light? Mister. That shame!

192
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,748
Eugene this?

193
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:56,847
Yes, it went to the tank and you should go for him
because and forgotten and this very busy one.

194
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,319
- What do make?
- Eugene this in the tank.

195
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,328
A sensorial camera of depravity.

196
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:07,353
As those big tubes...

197
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:12,091
- Because you make this?
- He/she helps to control the corporal functions.

198
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:15,093
As the ones that make yoga.

199
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:19,164
That can slow down their beats
and breathing to 4 per minute.

200
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:21,938
And good to be capable to do something like that.

201
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:25,969
In case you need to look
to be dead.

202
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:33,143
He/she said that his/her friend if it removed.
Because we have to do this?

203
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,912
I don't know.

204
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:54,003
What hour they are?

205
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:57,062
They are 6:30.

206
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,131
- And Tuesday fair?
- Tuesday fair?

207
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:06,836
We go, and fifth fair.Jamie, didn't say
that he/she had state here for 3 days.

208
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,247
Slowly, slowly.

209
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,522
Do you see him/it what say?

210
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,995
And I magnify. He/she seems
that Kelly sees for you.

211
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:27,626
I feel optimista to the respect.

212
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:30,031
The things coincide when everything
this well.

213
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:33,661
Jamie, support him/it that
Does Leslie try to do?

214
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:36,767
Clear.He/she worked very hard for that.

215
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:40,002
He/she would have wanted him to choose something
safer than to do with his/her life.

216
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:42,776
He knows him/it that and better for him.

217
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,802
Hello late, how these?

218
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:50,412
Anything better than one douches cold
so that it circulates the blood.

219
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:55,510
- How this the beer?
- Well, thank you. I recommend her.

220
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,916
- Do you want one?
- I don't think so.

221
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,093
When did we eat?

222
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:10,122
When you cut the vegetables
and you prepare the roast.

223
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:19,637
Leslie told us that he/she left.

224
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,508
Can we speak to that respect?

225
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:26,536
Yes.He/she told them said that were able to
to speak of it recounts.

226
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,945
It was a world completely different.

227
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:44,283
He/she had a lot of success in the 70.
The one that imported was the quality

228
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:48,454
of the work. The amount of
works that you did in one year.

229
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:54,362
The places that you devastated. No
you got ready as they make him/it today.

230
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:57,966
- The good ones make him/it.
- Clear.

231
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:01,866
Always the fear existed.

232
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:08,808
Some wonder on being murdered
and to spill all that blood...

233
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:17,212
He/she never coincides completely.

234
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:20,414
It is bad for the crop.

235
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:25,892
Perfect, dear.

236
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:30,526
- Because you don't light the oven?
- Clear.

237
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:37,239
He/she mentioned most of the people that
scare.

238
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,333
I don't speak about the ones that didn't make an effort.

239
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,940
As Jay, Fred, Mike...

240
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:49,114
There was not anybody like them.

241
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:55,645
We hit with fork as all and
we disappeared without thinking in returning.

242
00:21:57,957 --> 00:22:03,360
Those boys passed at other level.
They did of an I inhabit, an art.

243
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:08,457
They turned into legends
when returning an and again.

244
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:11,527
It was a radical change in the philosophy.

245
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:15,901
- He/she changed all I negotiate him/it.
- I negotiate him/it of the deaths

246
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:19,264
supernatural in the waterfalls.

247
00:22:19,475 --> 00:22:25,970
Her no this soaked in general
of because we do what do.

248
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:33,818
No, young. It is treated of the I negotiate
of the fear.

249
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:41,057
Each culture, civilization, had
their monsters.

250
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,418
That were compared with the evil.

251
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,289
The badly has to exist.

252
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:50,323
- Here your Doggie Dog.
- Thank you.

253
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:55,127
I feel that we don't have
had time of talking.

254
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:58,329
How is it going your work?

255
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:04,734
Very well. He/she told Jamie that
I am right that the girl sees.

256
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:07,612
Did you investigate?

257
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:11,948
And that that I find. She passes a lot
time in the library. I make him/it there.

258
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:15,014
Does she know the janitor?

259
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:18,046
Do you want to accompany us outside?

260
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,151
Thank you.

261
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:27,488
He/she thought to drop one of their friends...

262
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:32,566
I don't know, son. That if
he/she would discover very quickly.

263
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,199
He/she would increase the heat a lot.

264
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:41,801
Is there more anybody? She spoke with
plus anybody?

265
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,137
What such a librarian?
She passes a long time oh.

266
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:49,172
And a good idea.

267
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:52,651
There is a lady that leaves you
it ties late sometimes.

268
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,883
You have a winner.

269
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:58,913
Yes, I will think about that.

270
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,927
Maintain the investigation.
You owe a gaseous one!

271
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:10,823
What does want to say '' do you redden her ''?

272
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:16,135
It is a blow preliminary indirecto.

273
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,642
When you say '' blow ''... you refer
the first person that you killed?

274
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:35,787
The next step will be...

275
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:41,821
...to give this in hands of Kelly.

276
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:45,625
- That is treated?
- The article on the

277
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:51,033
I suspect that was interrogated
in my mother's violation.

278
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:55,236
Mark Daniel Kurtis.
And family of Kelly?

279
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,698
And the uncle grandmother.

280
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:03,144
- If it seems a lot her.
- And her.

281
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:07,037
And an image generated by computer.

282
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,876
Very well, not

283
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:13,113
Not even he/she has uncle grandmother.
At least, no that I know.

284
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:15,580
Then you did invent him/it?

285
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:18,613
A lot of what we used and CGI.

286
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,286
Can I sit down the front?

287
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:23,124
Thank you.

288
00:25:23,162 --> 00:25:26,028
No longer there is turn behind.

289
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:29,556
Or they are going their houses to clean
the conscience...

290
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:33,025
...or they enter.

291
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:36,371
What pharaoh?

292
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,301
How would it be?

293
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,470
I don't know.

294
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:51,281
I will introduce him/it, I hope she believes.

295
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:58,881
And a proof to see
if we are synchronized.

296
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:04,829
A lot of the one that happen depends on her.
Of the one that knife.

297
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,892
Now regreso.

298
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:16,328
We go, we go.

299
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:20,532
- Don't you see?
- I lost him/it.

300
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,902
Oh this.

301
00:26:26,214 --> 00:26:29,911
- And as a small monkey.
- He/she concentrates you.

302
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:33,409
Let us go.

303
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,460
Carefully.

304
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:46,760
Don't smell that this and dangerous.

305
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:50,633
What and this?

306
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:53,899
The data of the newspaper
they are in a microfiche.

307
00:26:54,371 --> 00:27:01,172
He/she extracts the true and pus that
he/she has his/her uncle grandmother's report.

308
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:11,280
If everything leaves well, that never happens.
She will see him/it title and he/she will want to read the rest.

309
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:14,677
He/she had helped the librarian for help.

310
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:17,246
Therefore he/she will see the microfiche.

311
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:22,124
He/she had read about the relationship with his/her family.

312
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:27,130
And it had been crazy.

313
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,193
Everything this very well,
and a big one recounts.

314
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:33,226
It is soon... I appear me.

315
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,867
This night there will be accao.

316
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:45,941
The lost paradise? I found him/it.

317
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:51,908
Continue to film.

318
00:27:51,952 --> 00:27:58,254
Perseguire a little the
Kelly so that it doesn't escape.

319
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:02,452
Wait for my sign, apanhamo-to
and we returned the carrinha.

320
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:10,557
- He/she wishes me luck.
- Good luck.

321
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:15,861
Todd, ahead. We have company.

322
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:28,281
- Her this that burns.
- Can Todd, film his/her rostrum?

323
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:35,421
He/she got up.

324
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:39,848
He/she shines as a gazelle.

325
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,424
He/she has good taste, he/she looks that well shines.

326
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:54,370
I cannot believe that you have worked
for it assures you that works.

327
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:03,271
Sra. Collinwood, could help myself
to find the rest of this article?

328
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:09,840
By God, this owes
to have about 30 years.

329
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:13,484
Somebody must have left him/it by mistake.

330
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:17,151
- No and of the library?
- No.

331
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:22,186
We don't maintain newspapers
so old. Scanerizamo-los.

332
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,959
Something like that should be in the microfiche.

333
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,259
Glenn Echo newspaper

334
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:37,097
Interrogated vagabond and position
in freedom in the case of violation.

335
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:42,205
Mark D.Curtis told as a vagabond
it was interrogated for the it polices of Glenn

336
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:46,002
Tuesday guile fair for the violation
of Molly Vernon.

337
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:51,647
Curtis, and his/her family?

338
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:55,646
He/she knows her recounts of the boy
what did die in the waterfalls?

339
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:58,914
All know her.

340
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:05,925
- But, and only one recounts.
- I want to know that happened.

341
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:11,057
Oh this.

342
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:16,936
And a marriage picture.
Vernon in his/her marriage.

343
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:20,673
And the first and it finishes her
picture that saw her.

344
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:26,443
They were a very strange couple.
Closed in themselves.

345
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:32,343
After that night, nine
months later, of done.

346
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:36,452
Molly Vernon gave the light a son d
esgracado.

347
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:45,561
They violated him/it and they forced him/it and they treated him
as a slave to cultivate the earth

348
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:50,264
only with a scythe.

349
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:55,602
One day, he/she says the legend,
the boy was reborn.

350
00:30:56,173 --> 00:31:03,510
Before the full moon he/she murdered people
with his/her scythe and it buried their bodies

351
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:11,783
in the fields. And it dragged Molle from the
it marries and it hung her/it in the back yard of stretchers.

352
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:19,487
When they were known about the crimes, all
in the town they went ties the farm

353
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:26,991
they removed the boy of the house, they tied
their hands and they threw him/it in the waterfalls

354
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,232
it ties that disappeared
in you water them cold.

355
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:40,476
- Did they find the body?
- The frozen bodies don't emerge.

356
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:44,742
If and my uncle grandmother,
the boy would be mine. . .

357
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:54,844
The boy drowned. You don't have that
to worry.

358
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,818
Leslie!

359
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:04,853
Plus no, it ends here.

360
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:12,292
He/she walks here, girl.

361
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:28,681
Did you catch him/it? Do you have him/it?

362
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:31,708
Did you catch the man, clear?

363
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,380
Did you record him/it?

364
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,415
- We have an alibi.
- We have an alibi.

365
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:45,361
- What and that?
- And somebody like him.

366
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,096
He/she walks, we will count Eugene.

367
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,032
- Did he/she shoot you?
- Yes. In the shoulder.

368
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,059
- Did he/she hurt you?
- No, this well.

369
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:58,838
- Same when you need.
- And incredible.

370
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:03,735
It seems that you have the alibi.

371
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:11,041
- Who and Dr. Calloran?
- A psychiatrist.

372
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:14,444
It visited me when he/she was boy.

373
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:18,049
After Leslie disappeared,
he foresaw that he/she would return.

374
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:22,589
- Angers behind him now?
- No, I need him.

375
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:26,055
- Because?
- Because and an alibi.

376
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,958
You will have to define an alibi.

377
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:36,039
In this context, and a reflex of everything
the one that and good.

378
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,699
Somebody that this disposed the
to defend people badly against the.

379
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:43,477
It is still had to take a risk his/her person.

380
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:46,481
He knows who am and what will do.

381
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:51,713
- He/she will make all the possible one to stop.
- They are good announce!

382
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,815
Let us be not ahead. The boy needs
to concentrate.

383
00:33:57,157 --> 00:34:00,718
We go, he/she has alibi. Doesn't he/she move you?

384
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:04,221
We are very proud of him.

385
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,121
He/she wanted to tell you that this and one
bad idea.

386
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:11,659
I need to check.

387
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:28,278
Hello, how this? Does he/she want a coffee?

388
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:31,675
- Yes, thank you.
- I return following.

389
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:33,720
What waits?

390
00:34:33,754 --> 00:34:37,712
When it returns, I tell him/her. Calm.

391
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:53,994
- Rays, that I say.
- He/she usually acts.

392
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:57,697
He/she thinks about the opposite
of what you do now.

393
00:35:00,577 --> 00:35:03,511
Because they follow this girl?

394
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:06,709
- Who are?
- We have only been coming here.

395
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:10,007
Do I serialize her? Because they film?

396
00:35:10,118 --> 00:35:12,678
Who and you?

397
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:15,712
Because he/she needs to know?

398
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:21,524
Do you know where this, clear?
Him no and who you find.

399
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:25,361
Did he/she feel how Vernon?

400
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,992
Perfect.

401
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:31,525
I don't know who and.

402
00:35:32,037 --> 00:35:37,099
He/she calls himself Leslie Mann
Crusoe. Of Reeno, Nevada.

403
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:40,499
He/she doesn't have idea of who and him.

404
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:43,871
What does happen he/she?

405
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:47,780
I think they want to speak with you.

406
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:55,213
We needed to go. A lot
thank you. Charmed, Sr. . .

407
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:58,514
Doctor. Halloran.

408
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:01,717
Esperen more you announce mine.

409
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:05,186
With his/her authorization.

410
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:11,996
They want to fake that we have
done talk the one what was us necessary?

411
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,669
- Leslie...
- Well, you said your part.

412
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,071
And my time.

413
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:20,304
He/she told you that you didn't speak with
her! You can lie down him to lose!

414
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:27,039
I showed them pearls.
Things that nobody saw.

415
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:33,820
If you want to leave, well. No
afectara that I have to do.

416
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:37,056
He/she would be happy not to see them more.

417
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:44,186
Don't lie down to lose. . .

418
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:47,555
...the work of my life.

419
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:55,462
Trust, necessary to trust.

420
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:59,305
- Yes!
- Clear!

421
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,873
Since it comes from you, who and him?

422
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,339
Who and the Dr. Halloran?

423
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:08,976
Who are you?

424
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,384
- We won't speak about this in the street.
- Don't you want that returns you to shoot?

425
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:15,678
- He/she enters in the carrinha.
- Did you live in Reeno?

426
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:22,084
Enough.

427
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:36,163
I will tell you everything that you need know.

428
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:47,741
Please, he/she enters in the carrinha.

429
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:53,347
You never lived in another place.

430
00:37:53,388 --> 00:37:56,380
You are not Molly Vernon's son.

431
00:37:57,158 --> 00:38:00,149
Who and the Dr. Halloran?

432
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:06,198
And a psychiatrist that assisted in Reeno.
Then I came to make this.

433
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:11,160
Because he/she didn't give you
is the truth known?

434
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:19,202
I made him/her a trap. I arranged one
restrincao order against him.

435
00:38:19,576 --> 00:38:23,102
And if he/she tries to surrender, they arrest him.

436
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:27,280
- You used me.
- How do you think is taken care of you?

437
00:38:30,585 --> 00:38:33,577
And my life.

438
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:39,816
Do you think and false?

439
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,121
If you cannot be...

440
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:47,522
...I understand.

441
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:01,534
He/she turns off her.

442
00:39:02,546 --> 00:39:05,537
Is it now it what? Were we or do we go?

443
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:09,449
Todd, for of pressing.It silences you Doug.

444
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:12,876
He/she leaves that thinks.

445
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:14,364
This and the one that I decided do.

446
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:19,067
Let us continue.

447
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:29,449
Welcome the supposed
he/she marries of my ancestors.

448
00:40:30,852 --> 00:40:33,980
You want to limit yours
time the most possible?

449
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:36,422
Because?

450
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:40,655
You will want see him/it all at the same time.

451
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:45,087
The worst and to hide to see.
That and a delay.

452
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:49,560
If they hide in the closet,
because not to go for them?

453
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:52,860
We have an ethical code.

454
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:58,067
The closet and a sacred place.

455
00:41:00,677 --> 00:41:04,408
He/she symbolizes the womb. And the more place
I hold because

456
00:41:05,615 --> 00:41:08,606
in the womb we are innocent.

457
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:13,477
Does that mean something in your life?

458
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:22,820
You won't want to ponder in a
person and to give time the other that escape.

459
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,097
Rule numbers a, nobody should flee.

460
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:34,868
If he/she escapes a not only and a blow
hard but yes that and shameful.

461
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,073
The bedroom will be where everything had begun.
If everything happens how I wait

462
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:45,342
somebody will bring his/her girl here and clear
that I will be to wait close.

463
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:56,856
This and my state area. I wait that
begin and later and thing of decision.

464
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,350
Which would a beneficial situation be?

465
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:04,394
If I know everything that happens,
if I know where they are whole.

466
00:42:04,764 --> 00:42:09,791
I will prepare the area. So that it seems
that are to sleep.

467
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:12,260
So that?

468
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:19,970
If somebody enters and he/she sees two corpses,
they will leave to run of the house and I lose them.

469
00:42:20,377 --> 00:42:24,279
I have to reduce the persecution
to me and Kelly.

470
00:42:26,983 --> 00:42:30,919
I have the central command
to cut the energy.

471
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:39,322
To go downstairs and to take advantage
the first moments of chaos.

472
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:45,124
Clear, the first reaccao will be to go
to seek flashlights in the kitchen.

473
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:48,557
I put batteries descargadas.

474
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:52,932
They will have to go digs her/it to see the fuses.

475
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:57,433
Nobody knows about the corpses
that they are there top, there won't be panic.

476
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:02,644
All will be celebrating. Kelly no.

477
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,044
The boyfriend had been frustrated and
he/she had attacked their friends.

478
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:12,386
It is later, the lights will fade.

479
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:18,455
One of the boys will want to go digs her
and it will be a great hormonas sack

480
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,851
and he/she will bring his/her small one to write down.

481
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:37,132
Leslie, don't think
and a little grotesque?

482
00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:40,944
I am only to tell her recounts.

483
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:49,408
And my best moment.

484
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,318
She will want to know everything well this.

485
00:43:53,622 --> 00:43:56,614
Then. . .

486
00:43:58,025 --> 00:44:01,119
- Clue-there to go?
- She had begun.

487
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:04,520
He/she angers to scream ties the house and it had begun
the panic.

488
00:44:04,831 --> 00:44:07,823
He/she will give time for my next step.

489
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:13,434
There is no lock as soon as in the hut
I use his/her body to scare the neighbor.

490
00:44:13,872 --> 00:44:17,136
The hut and it holds, not
I can leave that nobody among.

491
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:20,434
- The closet.
- Correcto. Kelly will only be able to enter.

492
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:23,736
If somebody tries to enter,
he/she will have to be seen with the scythe.

493
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:28,440
It is so sadistic.

494
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:33,480
- You are a genius.
- Thank you.

495
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,182
But, you want that Kelly among.

496
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:41,058
- Yes!
- So that?

497
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:45,191
- We want that knives the question.
- Well.

498
00:44:48,101 --> 00:44:53,094
Leslie, foresee that you want
that Kelly enters in the hut.

499
00:44:53,538 --> 00:44:55,369
Correcto.

500
00:44:55,407 --> 00:44:58,398
And the first fork sign that
I will look for in her.

501
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:04,845
And one moment pivot when
she becomes heroine.

502
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:10,015
He/she shows when it seeks
a great weapon.

503
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,012
You know the one that refer.

504
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:19,249
This well.

505
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,120
It is known.

506
00:45:22,163 --> 00:45:25,563
She strengthens... with a penises.

507
00:45:27,234 --> 00:45:29,633
We go...

508
00:45:29,668 --> 00:45:34,298
He/she thinks about the women that survived
these subjects and of certainty that

509
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,598
any consegiu without a small weapon.

510
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:43,772
- She had looked for some thing. . .
- He/she angers for my weapon.

511
00:45:45,883 --> 00:45:51,377
And the primordial because
he/she would be to take my virility.

512
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:54,584
It is if sobrevaloriza with that.

513
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:59,116
- And chovinista.
- And something conventional.

514
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:04,995
We are going the hut.

515
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:13,702
You want her to take one of these weapons.

516
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:20,703
If you look here, he/she has three
parts through where to catch.

517
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,136
He/she had broken in the first blow.

518
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,208
He/she has the free head.

519
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:38,053
The weapons obviate in front were
sabotaged.

520
00:46:39,394 --> 00:46:42,760
I hope he/she doesn't have
he/she supplies with the first blow.

521
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:54,670
There are 11 exits of the first floor
and other 8 or 9 in the second.

522
00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:58,598
You have to treat that
most is not practica.

523
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:03,974
I nailed them discreetly.

524
00:47:04,014 --> 00:47:07,608
- Had not he/she broken them?
- Do you think yes?

525
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:11,109
It would be a surprise.

526
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:15,789
When they break them, they are of it
second floor the highest.

527
00:47:16,225 --> 00:47:19,284
And in the tecto they are ended.

528
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:22,786
I cut the branches more squares of the you hoist.

529
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:29,090
For anybody to go down for them.
And the smallest also.

530
00:47:29,603 --> 00:47:33,333
As soon as everything would leave below.

531
00:47:33,806 --> 00:47:38,333
- He/she seems a trap.
- And the preparation.

532
00:47:39,244 --> 00:47:43,942
As regards to logistics,
I am in desventagem.

533
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,510
What had happened later he/she?

534
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:56,286
While they are rearranged, I dispose of
a small time to avoid that you/they leave.

535
00:47:56,658 --> 00:47:59,650
Then return in front of the house
and here and when the synchronization

536
00:47:59,761 --> 00:48:01,125
he/she becomes important.

537
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:02,822
They will go to wake up the
the two boys there top.

538
00:48:02,863 --> 00:48:05,855
- They will find them deads and they will get scared.
- Very well.

539
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:50,796
Now we approached at the end.

540
00:48:50,836 --> 00:48:53,634
- I think you know where it is going everything.
- I think so.

541
00:48:53,673 --> 00:48:56,664
Because you don't try?

542
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:05,310
I suppose that all will arrive ties here...

543
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:08,340
No supongas, will arrive ties here.

544
00:49:08,384 --> 00:49:11,376
They will try to hide and summer...

545
00:49:14,256 --> 00:49:17,453
Very well. Is it later?

546
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:20,784
They will go to the only place that is.

547
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:27,890
Does he/she wait, don't you forget something?

548
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:30,831
- The alibi!
- Exacto.

549
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:35,101
Calloran had imagined everything, as soon as
I must wait him/it.

550
00:49:35,507 --> 00:49:40,341
What should do and
to maintain busy Kelly.

551
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:46,513
I put some dispersed bodies. And
therefore we have our perverse espectaculo.

552
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,812
Then we will continue.

553
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,952
Her this loosens.Where do you go now?

554
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:08,824
The only place that is.

555
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,868
If the closet represents the womb,
what and this?

556
00:50:13,272 --> 00:50:16,263
- The channel from birth?
- Very well.

557
00:50:16,575 --> 00:50:19,567
This and one moment extremely
important in our work.

558
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:25,112
The opposite of phallus.

559
00:50:25,149 --> 00:50:28,140
And the girl's time.

560
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:33,383
She has to cross
some psychological passage.

561
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:40,985
She work, if and the chosen,
he/she had happened.

562
00:50:41,295 --> 00:50:44,889
His/her lost innocence, turn
to be born with revenge anguish.

563
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:51,059
If she makes him/it...

564
00:50:52,705 --> 00:50:55,697
I will be the happiest man of the life.

565
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:27,689
This and a jewel.

566
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:32,294
A press of seeds?

567
00:51:33,806 --> 00:51:38,243
Didn't you imagine stepping you stretchers?

568
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:43,870
What had with this happened?

569
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:53,654
I go squeeze them and soon I will use
his/her juice.

570
00:51:56,058 --> 00:51:59,049
He/she referred the this night.

571
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:04,487
Today I will hurt somebody.

572
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:13,164
Because that triumph. You will be fantastic.

573
00:52:14,907 --> 00:52:19,309
Before leaving, that such
a piece of advice of the experts?

574
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:25,579
As he/she survives her to an encounter
with anybody like you and Leslie?

575
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:31,120
He/she falls me well, and aventajada.

576
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,887
I will tell you.

577
00:52:34,923 --> 00:52:37,585
Never skirts with a virgin.

578
00:52:37,626 --> 00:52:40,617
If you have a virgin in yours equips,
or he/she lies down with somebody,

579
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:42,628
or you stand back of her.

580
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:49,966
You ally, it hurries completely that can. No
stop ties you that he/she leaves the sun.

581
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:59,835
And don't try to hide, we found you.
Don't try to be hero, you had lost.

582
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:05,579
He/she chooses a place so far
as it is possible and he/she flees.

583
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:11,452
It is look never behind. You had not liked
of what you will see.

584
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:17,024
And if they are together.

585
00:53:17,058 --> 00:53:20,459
You can do him/it.

586
00:53:20,962 --> 00:53:24,897
It assures you that is more
slow that you when running.

587
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:31,064
- I was fast, Eugene.
- Of course yes.

588
00:53:31,971 --> 00:53:34,906
You taught me.

589
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:48,407
Good-bye.

590
00:53:56,659 --> 00:54:02,824
This and one formulates for one
prepared against the aging.

591
00:54:03,131 --> 00:54:06,759
- What does make he/she?
- He/she narrows the vases

592
00:54:07,134 --> 00:54:08,795
sanguine close to the skin.

593
00:54:08,835 --> 00:54:12,429
I won't bleed in the case that me golpeem.

594
00:54:14,073 --> 00:54:20,136
You ally, he/she will make me pale lucir.

595
00:54:20,445 --> 00:54:23,414
You ally, I mixed him/it with my own one
prepared.

596
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:26,746
Does it worry you Halloran?

597
00:54:29,253 --> 00:54:32,016
It is not him.

598
00:54:32,055 --> 00:54:34,990
I need to ponder.

599
00:54:35,825 --> 00:54:40,227
- In Kelly?
- In my destiny.

600
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:45,588
My longevity depends
of the one that her knife.

601
00:54:47,735 --> 00:54:52,501
- You had tried murder her.
- And what does.

602
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:01,001
Owner-there?

603
00:55:02,614 --> 00:55:05,606
I love his/her ideal.

604
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:11,010
What finds in his/her interior.

605
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:15,115
What doesn't kill you, he/she will do you stronger.

606
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:28,157
These are my native one.

607
00:55:28,636 --> 00:55:33,231
If you don't stop to think in them,
they pass so fast.

608
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:46,273
I am so happy.

609
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:40,651
They remain few hours.

610
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:46,790
I will give one finishes view.

611
00:57:02,113 --> 00:57:07,983
There are 8 boys in the house. They are in low.

612
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:13,616
They drink beer. Kelly this
here, no this to drink.

613
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:17,082
The one that and good.

614
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:24,395
Somehow not
I feel that today and my night.

615
00:57:28,535 --> 00:57:34,837
The boy and the chorister will come soon.

616
00:57:35,842 --> 00:57:43,270
I usually give them a little
of time to do yours. . .

617
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:26,206
Same on time.

618
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:45,256
Do you want to dance with the devil?

619
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:14,550
Mister, this this to happen her serializes.

620
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:20,595
- Do you want that films something of this?
- I don't know.

621
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:35,937
He/she began, it began.

622
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:44,905
- What does happen he/she?
- He/she moves away her. He/she moves away her.

623
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:48,241
- What do make?
- No and my subject!

624
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:54,813
They go out, leave all.

625
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,225
We go, already.

626
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:02,128
- Because you make this?
- Because he/she notices him/it in you.

627
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:05,428
- What did notice?
- We cannot leave him/it that happens."

628
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:18,733
Leave.

629
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:30,047
I noticed them that was my night.

630
01:00:31,755 --> 01:00:38,091
This can have another result.
Then, I will have to hide

631
01:00:38,461 --> 01:00:41,452
or they will contain me, or they will kill me.

632
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:49,561
We won't see each other after this night.

633
01:00:51,171 --> 01:00:54,162
It will be better dismiss ourselves.

634
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:00,001
It was a pleasure.

635
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:04,572
Thank you.

636
01:01:06,684 --> 01:01:09,676
Thank you. A lot of luck.

637
01:01:20,696 --> 01:01:25,723
He/she chose to live as a ghost.
You chose for fidelity, not

638
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:29,293
you have to continue...

639
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:35,170
He/she doesn't have anything to see with the place
from where go or what happened.

640
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:39,034
He/she would have made him/it in all ways.

641
01:01:39,545 --> 01:01:42,342
And a choice.

642
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:49,148
To toast a balance among those
things that we had faith good or pure.

643
01:01:51,355 --> 01:01:54,346
You chose the journalism.

644
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:03,153
I was born to do this.

645
01:02:15,008 --> 01:02:18,000
Good-bye.

646
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:37,125
And everything? Nothing else? Incredible.

647
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:44,655
Everything collects.

648
01:02:54,341 --> 01:02:57,468
I will only film something more of the house.

649
01:02:58,978 --> 01:03:01,969
God, and like him he/she said.

650
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:05,444
- Now it should be at the hut.
- Same on time.

651
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:12,046
- What does happen he/she?
- He/she turns off her. We cannot see this.

652
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:15,481
No and like him it did describe?

653
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,227
We finished.

654
01:03:21,263 --> 01:03:25,995
- Now he will also have finishing.
- What do say?

655
01:03:26,668 --> 01:03:31,502
We already know what will do.
And we know that he/she will make him/it.

656
01:03:31,972 --> 01:03:34,907
- We can stop him/it.
- Wait.

657
01:03:36,109 --> 01:03:38,474
What do make?

658
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:46,007
He/she obtained what wanted. We built
yours recounts, it lacks the edition.

659
01:03:46,418 --> 01:03:51,912
- Do we can think him?
- You saw what prepared.

660
01:03:52,322 --> 01:03:55,314
Do you think Kelly will stop him/it?

661
01:03:55,526 --> 01:03:59,723
- It will be then that her no and...
- The survivor?

662
01:04:00,029 --> 01:04:02,121
He/she is 17 years old only.

663
01:04:02,164 --> 01:04:05,156
We woke up not to interfere.

664
01:04:06,935 --> 01:04:11,371
We entered, we tell everything the
Kelle and we go.

665
01:04:11,872 --> 01:04:14,704
Is it been pursues us?

666
01:04:14,741 --> 01:04:18,336
Be here to hold the tomatoes.

667
01:04:19,546 --> 01:04:22,946
Because he/she made reference to the tomatoes?

668
01:04:29,153 --> 01:04:31,212
And a very bad idea.

669
01:04:31,255 --> 01:04:34,189
I don't like, given the circumstances.

670
01:04:39,795 --> 01:04:42,787
Boys. . .

671
01:04:43,132 --> 01:04:45,599
They scared me.

672
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:48,625
Where this Kelly?

673
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:55,299
She was top there with his/her friend.

674
01:04:57,009 --> 01:05:00,001
Leslie cannot know that are here.

675
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:03,437
He/she could be where the corpses.

676
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:06,841
This room was not
closed when we went.

677
01:05:11,822 --> 01:05:14,813
By God.

678
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:20,319
I don't think a virgin.

679
01:05:22,564 --> 01:05:24,725
Who rays are you!

680
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:27,758
They leave of here!

681
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:35,367
No and a virgin. Definitively
no and his/her first time.

682
01:05:37,978 --> 01:05:40,343
This to the point of to kill
the other in the hut.

683
01:05:40,379 --> 01:05:43,507
- He/she waits, wait.
- Who are you?

684
01:05:43,883 --> 01:05:46,874
You have connosco to come,
there is no time to explain.

685
01:05:51,688 --> 01:05:54,987
All go. We go remove them of here.

686
01:05:58,594 --> 01:06:04,293
There is a called man Leslie
Crusoe that this in the hut and

687
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:08,035
planeou kill them this night.

688
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:14,101
- Leslie Vernon?
- No Leslie Vernon, and Leslie...

689
01:06:14,508 --> 01:06:16,702
Where this Lauren?

690
01:06:16,743 --> 01:06:21,612
- He/she went down her digs with the boy.
- With Pete?

691
01:06:22,514 --> 01:06:25,506
- You cannot go down.
- Because?

692
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:30,710
Because and very late.

693
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,456
A man with one
he/she chews murdered Pete.

694
01:06:41,997 --> 01:06:44,989
We were together and he appeared...

695
01:06:49,704 --> 01:06:53,969
- This cannot be to happen.
- He/she excuses but it will worsen.

696
01:06:59,879 --> 01:07:04,077
That night, he/she does one weeks,
you closed the cafeteria and

697
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:10,182
you took out the spillings, the door closed.
You thought to see somebody in the

698
01:07:10,521 --> 01:07:13,012
darkness that observed you.

699
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:18,686
- I made him/it but, it was not him.
- It was yes, it was him.

700
01:07:19,696 --> 01:07:22,687
That night in the library...

701
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:29,328
You saw him/it and him this here now.
He/she looks at him/it.

702
01:07:32,807 --> 01:07:35,775
Help me take her/it to her
to the other room.

703
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:49,244
- This doesn't work.
- He/she perfectly works.

704
01:07:49,654 --> 01:07:51,713
We have to undo his/her plan.

705
01:07:51,756 --> 01:07:56,158
The top boys, no if
it supposes that he/she sees ties them later.

706
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,326
- He/she goes do them to leave of the house.
- He/she has to happen now.

707
01:07:59,362 --> 01:08:02,490
Come, we have to show them something.

708
01:08:09,571 --> 01:08:12,562
What rays?

709
01:08:12,907 --> 01:08:16,070
Did we see him/it, no and?

710
01:08:21,781 --> 01:08:26,012
He/she calms, of certainty that
Pete this to play.

711
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:30,377
I go call him/it.

712
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:38,355
There is no service.

713
01:08:40,931 --> 01:08:43,694
Because it would change his/her plan like this?

714
01:08:43,732 --> 01:08:46,030
- This to readjust.
- So that?

715
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:49,002
For the people extra that you/they are
in the house.

716
01:08:49,037 --> 01:08:52,029
He/she tells me that he didn't see you in the window.

717
01:08:53,907 --> 01:08:56,899
Damned!

718
01:08:58,278 --> 01:09:00,404
Let us think well this.

719
01:09:00,446 --> 01:09:03,438
There are two in the barn.

720
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:06,512
He/she only waits for a boy.

721
01:09:06,551 --> 01:09:09,543
It had killed her/it both.

722
01:09:17,895 --> 01:09:21,762
I will enter, it collects me.

723
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:26,157
With what I do cover you?

724
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:40,677
Mister!

725
01:09:40,714 --> 01:09:44,809
- He/she walks to see this.
- He/she leaves give.

726
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:48,142
I will put this in my room.

727
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,550
We go, we will leave of here.

728
01:10:35,092 --> 01:10:38,083
We are ended!

729
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:43,421
The tires of the cars are broken out.

730
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:48,568
Everything happens as the planeou,
in spite of to the exchanges.

731
01:10:48,871 --> 01:10:53,773
It is very good. In the bad sense,
but and good.

732
01:10:54,108 --> 01:10:57,201
What scares me and to think that
survivor type had won him/it.

733
01:10:57,577 --> 01:11:02,604
That survivor type jumps on top
of a man as if I/you had been a puppet?

734
01:11:02,982 --> 01:11:07,611
The solution and the one that
did we need, what will make now?

735
01:11:19,896 --> 01:11:22,888
Do help me, what will make later?

736
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,327
The boys, are going top there and it comes the
corpses. Therefore they are going to the cars.

737
01:11:28,837 --> 01:11:31,829
- That are decomposed.
- Our carrinha no.

738
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:34,974
Let us go.

739
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,544
I silence!

740
01:11:59,463 --> 01:12:02,454
He/she won't diffuse.

741
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:08,759
Let us return the house.

742
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:17,071
He/she said that hated to be closed.
We will be in group,

743
01:12:17,478 --> 01:12:20,242
we will protect Kelly and we waited.

744
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,305
To protect me? Because not to protect
to all?

745
01:12:23,783 --> 01:12:28,549
- Kelly, have to go bottom, same bottom ,
all counted on you from now on.

746
01:12:28,989 --> 01:12:30,915
- With me? Because me?

747
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:34,215
Because he thinks are the
survivor of him

748
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:36,416
Yours that?

749
01:12:37,661 --> 01:12:41,824
He thinks you are who had struggled and
he/she had defeated him/it.

750
01:12:42,732 --> 01:12:44,995
Because he/she would believe in that?

751
01:12:45,033 --> 01:12:48,025
He studied them during months.

752
01:12:48,537 --> 01:12:52,028
It thinks are virgin.

753
01:12:53,274 --> 01:12:56,266
- He/she is going to the devil, prostitute.
- Farias you better.

754
01:12:57,644 --> 01:13:02,411
Of course is not it and if Leslie knows...

755
01:13:03,949 --> 01:13:07,043
What? What would make he/she?

756
01:13:07,953 --> 01:13:12,946
- It would kill us without leaving witnesses.
- Well done, Kell.

757
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:16,123
And my fault?

758
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:19,152
Because I am activa sexually?

759
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:23,793
He/she excuses, I am not virgin!

760
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:34,540
Kelly, not!

761
01:13:39,913 --> 01:13:42,905
That no and the worst now.

762
01:13:51,456 --> 01:13:54,447
We are going to the barn, exactamente
where he wants that go.

763
01:13:54,859 --> 01:13:57,692
- To the devil!
- What do make?

764
01:13:57,728 --> 01:13:59,194
And that you don't see him/it?

765
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:02,221
We are part of his/her education.

766
01:14:02,566 --> 01:14:05,557
I will see them. Have a good summer.

767
01:14:09,572 --> 01:14:12,563
Leslie, am to get!

768
01:14:13,641 --> 01:14:16,632
We go, he/she flees.

769
01:14:16,944 --> 01:14:19,936
We go, he/she walks.

770
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:22,412
He/she walks specimen.

771
01:14:22,448 --> 01:14:25,440
You had not reached me.

772
01:14:37,795 --> 01:14:40,786
What rays?

773
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,661
We go, Leslie, looks at me.

774
01:14:46,702 --> 01:14:49,068
He/she looks at me.

775
01:14:49,104 --> 01:14:52,096
He/she lets to see me you.

776
01:14:54,609 --> 01:14:56,873
I am Todd.

777
01:14:56,911 --> 01:14:59,606
Todd.

778
01:14:59,646 --> 01:15:02,638
We are together in this.

779
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:08,509
We go, we go.

780
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:35,575
Maybe Todd can escape.

781
01:15:36,877 --> 01:15:40,677
We should see. Maybe
their plans disappear.

782
01:15:41,115 --> 01:15:44,106
We are in the place that he wants.

783
01:15:48,687 --> 01:15:50,746
We should have escaped in the carrinha.

784
01:15:50,789 --> 01:15:53,780
Would you abandon us here?

785
01:15:55,293 --> 01:15:58,285
Is there how long what follow us?

786
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:07,392
No longer it matters.

787
01:16:16,411 --> 01:16:21,245
He knew him/it before knowing us.

788
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:27,142
Therefore it agreed.

789
01:16:28,521 --> 01:16:31,751
He/she found me before beginning.

790
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:37,559
- You don't say anything with sense.
- And perfect.

791
01:16:38,462 --> 01:16:42,557
- And a genius.
- Enough, speeches of his/her plan?

792
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,132
His/her plan this finishing.

793
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:49,797
No there are virgin and Todd... I wait that
one have not deceived.

794
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,266
And her.

795
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:04,976
You are right, you are the virgin.

796
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:15,782
Please...

797
01:17:16,027 --> 01:17:19,018
...you have to tell me.

798
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:23,122
What had he/she/you happened me?

799
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,952
No, Doug!

800
01:18:12,307 --> 01:18:15,298
No!

801
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,912
He/she loosens me!

802
01:18:45,435 --> 01:18:48,427
We go, we have to leave.

803
01:18:53,341 --> 01:18:56,332
We have to find another exit.

804
01:18:56,577 --> 01:18:59,944
- No and good, not.
- He/she could work.

805
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:03,439
And part of his/her plan.

806
01:19:34,042 --> 01:19:37,034
And if I am his/her lover?

807
01:19:37,412 --> 01:19:40,403
You will have to kill me.

808
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:02,422
Excuse Todd.

809
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:03,972
Now you will see.

810
01:26:30,256 --> 01:26:32,689
This...?

811
01:26:32,724 --> 01:26:35,659
I don't know.

812
01:26:37,863 --> 01:26:38,954
I don't know him/it that and.

813
01:26:38,996 --> 01:26:41,430
And only a man.

814
01:26:41,465 --> 01:26:44,457
Only a man.
