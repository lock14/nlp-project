1
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,708
John Muir said it really beautifully.

2
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:08,515
He said, ""Go to the mountains
and get their good tidings. ""

3
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,887
What he meant is
that there is so much out there

4
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,052
that you can receive from that environment.

5
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,724
We receive these amazing feelings
when we're up there

6
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:24,395
and we feel so strong and
sometimes you do bring those things back.

7
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,429
And it's special.
It's like you've been blessed.

8
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,742
I'm not sure what that is right there.

9
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,645
Ice or rock or something. Yeah.

10
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,549
Nice though. I like the deep of it.
I'm sure the snow will be good in there.

11
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,950
Magical.

12
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,283
It's got a nice start.
The snow looks perfect at the top.

13
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,850
You know, not too steep.
Get a little few warm-up turns

14
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,089
before we drop into this thing.

15
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,496
I didn't choose my life in the mountains.
It just happened.

16
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:01,172
I tried to become a normal person
and have a normal job, but that didn't work.

17
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,034
As soon as I got out of jail, I went skiing.

18
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,172
As soon as I got out of broken legs,
I went skiing.

19
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,582
That's where I had to go
to make it all right again.

20
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,047
The rest of the world is total chaos.

21
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:21,459
We're mountain people. This is what we do.
This is how we live.

22
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,994
The risks are very high.

23
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:30,434
But I think most of us have decided
that the risk is worth it.

24
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,575
For me, as soon as the winter stops,
I get a week off.

25
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,077
I'll start dreaming about skiing.

26
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:45,275
This concept of just strapping
these boards on your feet.

27
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,615
You know, if you actually sit down and think
about it, it"s like, ""What a concept. ""

28
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,521
You know, that's great.

29
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,618
A couple of 2" x 4"s on your feet,
sliding down the mountain.

30
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,094
You know, how much fun is that?

31
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,337
The idea is simple.

32
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,840
Ski where no one thought to ski before.

33
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,876
Ski the backcountry, away from the resorts

34
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,146
and the rules and restraints
that go with them.

35
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:57,246
Ski where the sport of skiing
can still be an adventure.

36
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,789
A simple idea, but 35 years ago,

37
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:06,730
only a handful of people saw
big, wild mountains as a place to ski.

38
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,594
One of the first who did was Bill Briggs.

39
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,705
Skis are appropriate on mountain sides

40
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,009
and all kinds of mountainsides.

41
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,120
In June 1971, Briggs,

42
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,093
a skier and mountain guide
from Jackson Hole, Wyoming,

43
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,288
became the first person to ski

44
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:42,232
from the summit of one of
America's greatest peaks, the Grand Teton.

45
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,797
The idea wasn't, for me,

46
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,468
that I would be the only one
that would ever do this.

47
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,975
My idea was everybody
should be doing this.

48
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:00,078
At the time nobody was,
but this is something...

49
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,785
It's too much fun to pass up.

50
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,686
The Grand Teton,
it really is an iconic mountain.

51
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,460
You drive into Jackson Hole
and the first thing you see is

52
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,834
that gigantic, jagged thing
looming up there,

53
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,807
and it looks like it would be
tough to climb, let alone ski.

54
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:27,107
And in 1971, the concept of skiing
those kind of mountains

55
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,014
was very far from even
most skiers' point of view.

56
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,578
There's nobody out there with signs.

57
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,053
There's no ropes. There's no signs.
There's no patrolmen.

58
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,455
There's nobody, like,
taking care of you on the slopes.

59
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,153
It's not a ski area. You"re on your own.

60
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,026
You know,
you have to make decisions on your own.

61
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,901
Bill Briggs skiing the Grand Teton
was so far ahead of its time.

62
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,340
No one had even come across the idea that,
"Oh, hey, let's go ski that big rock

63
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,479
"with a little bit of snow on it
and call it a ski run."

64
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,681
What Bill Briggs did
was open people"s minds.

65
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:11,179
People in Jackson told Bill
skiing the Grand was impossible.

66
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,917
There were avalanches and falling rock.

67
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,189
Sections were too steep.

68
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:21,222
He would have to ski along cliffs
that dropped off for thousands of feet.

69
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,064
The smallest misstep could be fatal.

70
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:30,598
And Briggs was climbing and skiing
on a surgically fused right hip

71
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,406
that caused him to limp when he walked.

72
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,044
If there's no risk, there's no adventure.

73
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,544
I think adventure is a great part of life.

74
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,690
For me it's, "Why am I living?" You know?

75
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,585
Gee, it's to have some adventure.

76
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,193
Before dawn on June 16th,

77
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:57,225
Briggs, and three friends he had convinced
to help him climb up the Grand,

78
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:01,364
Ieft their camp at 11, 000 feet
and began the push to the top.

79
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:08,538
The route Briggs planned would
take them up the Stettner Couloir,

80
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,315
up the avalanche-prone snowfield
on the east face

81
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,778
along the Petzoldt Ridge

82
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:21,559
and then the last few hundred feet
to the summit of the Grand.

83
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,594
I expected those guys to break trail for me.

84
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,066
Breaking trail is physically exhausting.

85
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,543
So I get up to the top of the Couloir

86
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,776
and I find they are all right there
and they say, "We can't do it."

87
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,818
Oh, that means I have to do it.

88
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:58,662
They took one look at the top of the Couloir
and it's a thousand-foot drop, and sheer.

89
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,556
And that was just too much.

90
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,103
Well, at that point I didn't want to quit.

91
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,298
At least I was going to see
how far I could go.

92
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,405
I think the biggest thing
is that he was alone.

93
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,213
You have this internal dialog
up there all the time.

94
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,878
You don't have your friend to talk to.

95
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,718
"You think we should go around
to the left a little?"

96
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,453
Or, "Boy, it's getting steep now."
You know, that's all in your brain.

97
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,052
You can't relay it to anyone else.

98
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:36,296
And it's fall-you-die terrain.
Where if you get avalanched, you'd be gone.

99
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,301
It's tough when you're alone.

100
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,107
His friends watched Bill pull himself up

101
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,941
onto the steep, snow-covered east face
of the Grand

102
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,615
and disappear from view.

103
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:05,260
No one saw Bill Briggs
when he reached the summit of the Grand.

104
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,095
No one saw him begin his ski descent.

105
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,196
No one saw him fall
and recover just below the summit

106
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,671
or ski the high snowfields.

107
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,973
Hours after he left them,
Bill's climbing partners waiting below

108
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,846
witnessed an avalanche tear past them.

109
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:32,849
They are sure that I was in it
and I had gone off this precipice

110
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,415
down a thousand feet.

111
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,462
""Well, that's Briggs
and he"s finished, right?""

112
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,928
Well, I drew a big turn

113
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,135
and I ski right up to my friends.

114
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,662
And they turn around and,
"Where did you come from?"

115
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,541
They didn't see me come through that at all.

116
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,743
They figured I was dead anyway.
And, all of a sudden, I reappear.

117
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,922
Bill descended more than 6,000 feet on skis.

118
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,489
It took him almost five hours
to reach the valley floor.

119
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:21,102
When I got to the bottom, I'm really tired.
I'm really physically beat

120
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,639
and...

121
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,077
Overjoyed.

122
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,546
I did it. Okay?

123
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,080
Man. This is...

124
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,515
This is the biggest thing I'll do in my life.

125
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,464
There were no witnesses
to Bill Briggs" achievement.

126
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:52,026
But the next day the proof was still etched
in the snow.

127
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,475
The editor of the local paper flew
with Bill around the summit.

128
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,105
She took four photographs.

129
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,740
And one of them was just a classic.

130
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,344
The beauty of the mountain,

131
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,080
enhanced a bit by human contact.

132
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,352
It was fabulous.

133
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,029
I don't know.

134
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,130
You dream up

135
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:27,101
what you want to accomplish

136
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,767
in your life and...

137
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,309
I don't know that many people get a chance

138
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,675
to fulfill that.

139
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:43,415
What that was...
I had at that point fulfilled a dream.

140
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,021
Totally.

141
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,468
I knew that someone had skied the Grand,

142
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,127
but I didn't know
what the Grand looked like.

143
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,365
So it just sort of, "Oh, yeah,
somebody skied the Grand."

144
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,202
And it was, you know, big news.

145
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,843
But I didn't really know what it was.

146
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,846
Doug Coombs was a teenager
growing up in Bedford, Massachusetts

147
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,782
when Bill Briggs skied the Grand.

148
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,911
The quote in his high school yearbook said,

149
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,252
"There is no such thing as too much snow. ""

150
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:26,560
Even when I was just a little tiny kid,
I would try to ski every day.

151
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,028
And where I live I could even
go skiing in my backyard.

152
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,629
My parents would flick the light on
and I'd ski at night.

153
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,833
You know, I could just go down
a little hill in the backyard.

154
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,435
It was flat as a pancake,
but it was icy because it was New England.

155
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,945
And I would just skate like a fiend
from the neighbor"s house

156
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,872
and then come down
through the other neighbor's house

157
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,510
and by the time I got to my house
I could do some turns.

158
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,883
No one ever said to me,
""Don't go off the trail. ""

159
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,297
We were off-piste skiing
when I was seven, 10.

160
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,325
I just didn't think of it as that. I just thought
it was going through the trees.

161
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,203
And then we'd go down riverbeds
and things like that and jump off waterfalls.

162
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,504
I just thought it was normal.

163
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:17,239
I grew up skiing maple trees in Vermont,
birch trees in Vermont.

164
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,681
Sometimes we weren't even on the ground.

165
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,746
We were skiing branches
and calling it good skiing.

166
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,314
We weren't even touching the snow.

167
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,318
You're not skiing the ground,
you just ski the trees.

168
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,403
If someone said you have to ski
at a ski area for the rest of your life...

169
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,531
Well, I could maybe do that when I'm 80,
but I can't do that now.

170
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,632
Every mountaineer and every skier

171
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,568
realizes the mountains are
a living, breathing thing.

172
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,102
Where's that chalk? Breathe.

173
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:56,513
When they're not happy, or just pissed off,
they're blowing, you have to read that.

174
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:01,542
You can't just say, ""I'm gonna do this, ""
even though they're telling you, 
""Not today. ""

175
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,054
That's when you get in trouble.

176
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:08,787
Being able to feel what the mountains
are saying to you is huge.

177
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,795
They're alive. You know, they're totally alive
and they'll make you more alive.

178
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,695
You know, or they'll make you dead,
you know, if you don't read them.

179
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,900
You know, there's always bad luck,
and I don't know

180
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,138
where bad luck comes in,
but it's definitely there.

181
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,090
When you're always in that element,
the vertical world,

182
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,826
either skiing or climbing,
moving through the mountains,

183
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,165
not just being in them,
but actually moving through the mountains

184
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,330
and with the mountains, you're only a guest.

185
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,864
And you don't know
when your time is up as a guest.

186
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,413
I'm just a cheater. I've been out there
a lot longer than most people

187
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,780
and I just keep doing it
and doing it and doing it.

188
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,417
When I go out, I become more alive.

189
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,497
And that's probably the endorphins
that everyone talks about.

190
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,866
And I guess the more you produce,
the more you want.

191
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,801
And so I think I have been
producing a lot for a long time

192
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,274
'cause I want them all the time.

193
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,480
I just love skiing.
I like the gravitational pull.

194
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:13,749
It's not a natural motion for the human body
to stand on two planks and slide.

195
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:21,715
When you ski steep terrain,
all it takes on a 45-degree slope

196
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:26,457
to just launch into space is
a small tweak of your quadricep muscle.

197
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,558
And if you pop off that snow,
you can sail 20 feet

198
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,331
down the hill with very little effort.

199
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,936
You can almost get a feeling of flying.

200
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,611
You get up to the 50-degree range

201
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,352
and it starts to become
difficult to control yourself.

202
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,791
There's so much gravity pulling you down

203
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,665
that you get to a point
where you can't overcome it anymore.

204
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,569
But anything that produces
this much joy in people's lives

205
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:17,946
is worth a certain amount of risk,
physical risk, emotional risk, whatever.

206
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,952
But how much risk it's worth
is an open question.

207
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,917
Nowhere in the world are
the risks and rewards of a life

208
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:34,296
in the mountains revealed more clearly
than in the French valley of Chamonix.

209
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,259
Chamonix is the birthplace of alpinism.
It"s the motherland.

210
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,572
In the "70s and "80s,
it was always kind of held up as

211
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,510
this shining, larger-than-life destination.

212
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,208
It was like, "Oh, Cham, Chamonix."
And it was almost mythical.

213
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,183
You would aspire someday
to go ski in Chamonix.

214
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,559
The mountains are big. They're wild.
They're unbelievably aesthetic.

215
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,120
There are spires everywhere.

216
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:10,430
I mean, you cannot go there, whether you're
a skier or whether you've never seen snow,

217
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,062
and not be inspired by the landscape.

218
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,299
It will just blow your mind.

219
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,976
You know, in Chamonix,
there is a lot of people.

220
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,715
They come here
from everywhere in the world.

221
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,555
American, Swedish,
Norway, Australia, New Zealand.

222
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:39,755
There's a lot of very good extreme skiers
from everywhere in the world.

223
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,629
And they come here for the same things.

224
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:48,968
You can see if you go in the bar after 6:.00,
everybody was going crazy.

225
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,204
After a powder day or something, it's...

226
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,609
It's... You can feel the energy.

227
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:00,849
They have the same spirit.
So it's very special.

228
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,482
When you're skiing in America,

229
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,081
you're skiing in little,
controlled snow parks.

230
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,218
And everywhere is safe. You go
and you can't really get into trouble.

231
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:16,495
And in Europe, the ski areas are
basically access to the big mountains.

232
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,332
I mean, they put lifts,
you know, as high up as they can.

233
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,531
They wanted to put a lift
to the top of Mont Blanc.

234
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:25,167
So you get into a whole different level of

235
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,005
trouble over there.

236
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,781
Chamonix is one of those places
in the world of skiing

237
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,346
where every time you go there,

238
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,951
there is some chance
that you will leave in a body bag.

239
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,288
So this makes it

240
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:51,667
a little bit higher-intensity spot
than most places that you go to.

241
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:56,031
It's the place.
You're not a big mountain skier unless

242
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,473
you've skied Chamonix.

243
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,975
In the valley, you know,
the life is not easy when you are down.

244
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,143
When you are in the mountains,
it's very simple.

245
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,877
You have to do something right.

246
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:14,688
There is no way to do something wrong
because you die.

247
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,521
You know it's very risky, but you go,

248
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:25,798
because it's every day a new adventure,
a new story. It's magic.

249
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:35,109
In the 1970s and "80s,
extreme skiing became a sport

250
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,412
here in these mountains
around Europe's highest peak, Mont Blanc.

251
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:46,149
Europeans watched films of men
like Patrick Vallencant and Anselme Baud,

252
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,987
as they climbed and then skied

253
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,460
some of the steepest,
snow-covered faces in the Alps.

254
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:57,498
Patrick and I were more than friends.
We were like brothers.

255
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,167
We were always in control.
If we hadn't been...

256
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,469
Yeah, what can I say?
We'd be crazy.

257
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:15,050
And this is how the first viewers
of our films thought of us.

258
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,612
They thought we were insane.
But that wasn't it at all.

259
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,856
Of course, we were always
very afraid.

260
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,195
The one who's not afraid is crazy.
He's a dead man.

261
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,765
But we never panicked.

262
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,031
Like Jean-Marc Boivin
used to say,

263
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,841
you can either live your
life like a lamb,

264
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,846
or live your life like a lion.

265
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,045
We have a choice in life.

266
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:52,989
There was no shortage of
lions in Chamonix.

267
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,727
There were many skiers
attempting descents so extreme,

268
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,269
they appeared almost suicidal.

269
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,140
They were the early visionaries.

270
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,974
They were the people who were showing us
what could be done.

271
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,341
In the States,
Bill Briggs" descent of the Grand is

272
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:23,080
sort of the singular, crystallizing moment
for American big mountain skiing.

273
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:27,887
But there were dozens of people
doing stuff like that in Chamonix.

274
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,554
A whole series of people who were,
you know, pioneers and legends.

275
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:36,333
This whole string of people
that kept going steeper and steeper

276
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,494
and bigger and bigger.

277
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,666
You had people who were living and playing

278
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,207
in these mountains kind of
looking out there going,

279
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,038
"Well, what else can I do on skis?"

280
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:54,016
Even the deaths of men
like Vallencant and Boivin

281
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,215
did little to slow the pursuit
of bigger and steeper descents.

282
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,154
Extreme skiing is a way of life.

283
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,288
It was my way to become a man.

284
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,131
Stefano de Benedetti, like the others,

285
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,639
was drawn into the unskied world
around the Mont Blanc massif.

286
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,343
During the 1980s, de Benedetti made

287
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,075
some of the most extreme ski descents
ever attempted.

288
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,346
Some so dangerous,
they would never be repeated.

289
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,884
When you live in touch with the mountain,

290
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,892
when you spend most of
your time in the mountains

291
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,292
your vision changes completely.

292
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,958
And after three or four years,

293
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:46,197
I could see the possibility to ski

294
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,102
where nobody saw it.

295
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:58,406
In 1984, a film was made
about de Benedetti's attempt

296
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:03,648
to ski the east face of the Aiguille Blanche
on the Italian side of Mont Blanc.

297
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,818
A face so steep that it held snow
just a few days a year.

298
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:14,763
Imagine the line. The simple pen
stroke between base and summit.

299
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,196
It makes for an
unrepeatable experience.

300
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:22,097
Perhaps only in these
moments am I truly aware

301
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,772
that this is my mode of
expressing myself.

302
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,942
That this is my mode of speaking
to the others of freedom.

303
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,617
When I was sure it was the right moment,

304
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,220
it was the beginning of June.

305
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:51,394
I started from the bivouac
at 4,000 meters in the night.

306
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,165
And I climbed all over the mountain.

307
00:27:56,474 --> 00:28:02,709
When you wake up at midnight
and you cross a glacier with stars

308
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,182
in the black and you start climbing
these big walls

309
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,446
with avalanches, with seracs,

310
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,953
you feel you are a very little thing
in a big universe.

311
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:39,849
When I reached the top, I knew
that it was possible to ski.

312
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:45,288
I knew that that day
I would find my perfect moment.

313
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,282
And I did it.

314
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:08,872
In the perfect moment
I was so concentrated,

315
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,813
there was no space for other thoughts.

316
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,350
When you want to make a turn

317
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,258
and you are at the top
of a steep vertical wall...

318
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,556
I mean, when you are in the situation
that if you fall, you die,

319
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,231
everything changes.

320
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,336
You think very much about turning.

321
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,468
You think very much about where to turn.

322
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,807
And you do all this in a very special way.

323
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,719
You act like a different person.

324
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,853
You act with all yourself.

325
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:02,063
You are making
a completely different experience

326
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:06,800
and in some way
you are discovering yourself.

327
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,031
This is the magic of the mountain.

328
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:16,407
You can accept to die for this.
You don't want to die.

329
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:22,784
But to live so close
to the possibility of dying,

330
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:27,380
you understand
what is really important and what not.

331
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,151
And this makes you a better person.

332
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,560
It's probably the highest moment

333
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:42,870
of my life because in the perfect moment

334
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:47,810
I was, or I felt to be, a little Superman.

335
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,670
Let's go into this clearing here.

336
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:25,177
In the mid-1980s, extreme skiing,

337
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,913
the way of life that emerged
in the mountains around Chamonix

338
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:33,856
found a follower in a young skier
from western Canada named Eric Pehota.

339
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,621
You know, back then I didn't have kids.
I didn't have a wife.

340
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,530
It was me, me, I, I, me, me, right?

341
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,194
You know, you just keep stepping it up.

342
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,639
You just wanted to keep pushing it
and see how big and steep you could go,

343
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,566
without killing yourself.

344
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,637
You can see the log and slosh
right there, right?

345
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:57,806
Yeah.

346
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:58,871
It's the ultimate paradox,

347
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,511
the closer you come to dying,
the more alive you feel.

348
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,918
And that's so true.

349
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:07,424
You know, if you just sit around
on a couch and watch TV.

350
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,426
How can you appreciate that cold beer,

351
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,463
or that nice, big, hearty steak
and this and that?

352
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,591
But you eat soup, and live in a cold,
icy environment for two, three weeks,

353
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,728
and, man, you get back,
and that's the best burger

354
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,773
you've ever had in your life
and the coldest, warmest... Doesn't matter,

355
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,398
that beer could be piss warm,

356
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,773
and it'll be the nicest beer
you've had in your life.

357
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,368
I tell you that right now.

358
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,146
Can't breathe, eh?
We should get back to the truck.

359
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,515
Okay.

360
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,254
It's my life, right. You know,
it's something I've done all my life.

361
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,588
And I pass it on to my kids.

362
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,629
Pehota, like Vallencant,
like Baud, like de Benedetti,

363
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,725
risked skiing
where no one had skied before.

364
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,702
During the 1980s,
Eric was the first to ski dozens of peaks

365
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,504
in the coast range of British Columbia,

366
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:03,707
including the first ski descent
of the highest peak in the range,

367
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,442
Mount Waddington.

368
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,849
I've lost a few friends,
really close friends, you know,

369
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,083
almost like blood brother-type friends,

370
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,685
in this kind of life
I guess I've chosen for myself.

371
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,032
But, you know,
I guess I've learned to accept that.

372
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,365
When you ski big mountains
in an uncontrolled environment

373
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,599
and on a full-time basis,
you"re going to see death

374
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,734
and you may succumb to it yourself, right?

375
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,012
Pehota's closest friend
and frequent ski partner

376
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:41,483
was a skateboarder and skier
named Trevor Petersen.

377
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:47,017
Petersen died in an avalanche
in Chamonix in 1996.

378
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,660
But in the 1980s, he and Eric were inspired

379
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,391
by the partnership of Patrick Vallencant
and Anselme Baud.

380
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,101
Trevor Petersen was a big influence
on my ski mountaineering.

381
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,333
He had a really magical psyche
for the mountains.

382
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:07,305
And he had this gift of just getting me
psyched and pumped as well.

383
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:13,445
Trevor knew quite a bit of background
on the French extreme skiing.

384
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,116
He had a book.
I think it was written by Anselme Baud

385
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:21,920
on first descents in the French Alps.

386
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,190
And Trev started filling me in
and showing me pictures and, you know,

387
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,699
I was just awestruck
at what these guys were doing on skis

388
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,757
and I said, "l want to do that."

389
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,576
In the "80s, Trevor and Eric

390
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,520
basically pioneered ski mountaineering
in western Canada.

391
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,787
They were the guys who put down
most of the first descents,

392
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,523
who taught an entire generation
of western Canadians

393
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,792
what could be done in their backyard.

394
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,597
They just got after it in ways more so
than anybody did in the States

395
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,004
and created a body of ski work
that is really unprecedented.

396
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,306
Me and Trevor always kind of had
the same goal.

397
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:19,338
We seemed to focus on the same thing
that was the big objective in the area,

398
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,544
the big peak and the big run.

399
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,784
Maybe not the raddest run in the range,
but just the big peak and the line off it.

400
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,391
We were both driven to do that.

401
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,125
I think that's kind of how
we became really close.

402
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,168
To share that moment with somebody
and you know, work towards

403
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,397
a goal and then achieve that goal.

404
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,463
And to actually share that
with your best friend is, you know,

405
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,907
a feeling that, you know,
I can't really describe.

406
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,513
It's just such a great feeling, really.

407
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,676
In the early 1980s,
few American skiers were even aware

408
00:35:56,754 --> 00:36:00,690
of the kind of skiing taking place
in the mountains around Chamonix.

409
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:04,819
Most American skiers
had never heard of extreme skiing.

410
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,797
In 1988, that began to change.

411
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:17,868
Steep skiing in big mountains
found an unlikely American pitchman.

412
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,740
His name was Glen Plake.

413
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,381
I grew up in South Lake Tahoe,
which was considered kind of a rat hole

414
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,816
of a place to be a snow skier.

415
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,381
You know, I was definitely an oddball.
I was an outcast.

416
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,885
Like anybody else, you grow up raising Cain
and sometimes you get caught.

417
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,227
Few people would have guessed
that a former juvenile delinquent

418
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,741
with a criminal record would become
skiing's most recognizable icon.

419
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,976
Everything I have in my life is
from skiing, everything.

420
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,211
Every dollar I've ever earned is
from skiing, every dollar.

421
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,479
That's it. It's what I do.

422
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:07,348
Glen Plake's star began to rise
in 1988 when he appeared

423
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,360
in an unconventional,
irreverent ski movie called

424
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,362
The Blizzard of AAHHH's.

425
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,989
Okay, if you thought skiing was skiing
and there was a certain sameness to it all,

426
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,469
I suggest you buckle your breakfast seatbelt
because what we're about to show you

427
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,563
is something called extreme skiing.

428
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,803
It lacks only a disclaimer
that you not try this on your own.

429
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,868
We assume your sense of
self-preservation will tell you that.

430
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,574
Extreme skiing is virtually outlawed
in this country,

431
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,550
where insurance companies
and promoters fear the worst.

432
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,611
So these days extreme skiing
is centered in France

433
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,351
where the concept of recovery
for ski injuries is laughed at.

434
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,326
Out-of-bound skiers have
no sanctioned competitions,

435
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:48,092
but most arguments advance
veteran Scot Schmidt as America's best.

436
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,099
Lately, though, he is being challenged

437
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,761
by newcomer Glen Plake,
the man with the Mohawk.

438
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,032
He now lives in France
where he earns a living

439
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,042
by wearing a point-of-view camera
to make ski movies like this one.

440
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,704
It's called The Blizzard of AAHHH's.

441
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,181
Glen Plake, Scot Schmidt,
good morning, guys.

442
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,409
-Morning, Bryant.
-How are you?

443
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm not going to let this pass
without comment, did you dress for us?

444
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,955
-Yeah.
-Did you?

445
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,581
-Did it for my country.
-Let's talk about the lake.

446
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,922
Oh, okay. So, talk to me
a little bit about injuries, guys.

447
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,223
I mean, how many
and what kind have you had?

448
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,695
I've had three broken legs.

449
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,324
Broken when I was five,
broken when I was like 17,

450
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,527
and then just broke one again
two years ago.

451
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,160
Before you started doing all the weird stuff.

452
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,536
No, I've been doing
the weird stuff the whole time.

453
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,770
-Do you do everything to extreme?
-Yeah.

454
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,138
The Blizzard of AAHHH's was
the creation of filmmaker Greg Stump.

455
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:41,582
Stump was unhappy
with the state of American skiing.

456
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,378
They wouldn't let us film in America.

457
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,515
We had been kicked out of every ski resort
because we were jumping off stuff

458
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,957
and skiing out of bounds.

459
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,460
And we were like, ""Screw it.

460
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,498
""Let's go to France
where we don't have to get any insurance,

461
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:55,862
""where they've got better mountains. ""

462
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,231
So we just all booted it to Europe.

463
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,300
Glen Plake joined skiers
Mike Hattrup and Scot Schmidt

464
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:11,437
in what would become the most influential
American ski film ever made.

465
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:18,748
They came to Chamonix,
the birthplace of European extreme skiing.

466
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,917
But The Blizzard of AAHHH's
bore little resemblance

467
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:25,120
to the extreme ski films
being made in Europe.

468
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,791
The skiers in Blizzard
were in Chamonix to play.

469
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,897
We were just having a good time, you know.
We were out cruising around.

470
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:37,202
We were making a ski film and skiing hot.

471
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,208
We were just good skiers
out ripping around.

472
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,574
And I think it showed. You know?

473
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,706
It looked like these guys were having
a fun time. That's cool.

474
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:59,254
The skiers in Blizzard were having fun.
But they were also courting danger.

475
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:07,728
I had never seen a glacier before.
I had never seen

476
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,800
Iifts that took us
to those types of places before.

477
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,642
You know, I mean, I knew what
a crevasse was, but I had never seen one.

478
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:20,173
You know. I'm from South Lake Tahoe.
You know, I grew up skiing Heavenly.

479
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,820
Yikes, this is kind of wild.

480
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,837
It was our introduction
into the big mountains.

481
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:45,134
It was awe-inspiring
and intimidating at the same time.

482
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,145
And that was all captured on film.

483
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,507
One run in Blizzard
that resembled the kind of skiing

484
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:58,214
that the European extremists were doing
was Scot Schmidt"s run

485
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,985
from the top of the Aiguille du Midi.

486
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,583
This one here is called the Couloir Poubelle.

487
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:08,030
It's about 47, 50 degrees.
It's a 200-meter shot.

488
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:12,000
-Scott, you want to try to ski it?
-Yeah, I'll ski it for sure.

489
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,370
Two, one...

490
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,849
Steep.

491
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:42,229
Blizzard really made skiing seem
like a dangerous sport,

492
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,790
more like surfing than golf, for instance.

493
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,736
I mean, you know,
there's this mountain that can cream you.

494
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,273
There's doubt there.
There's risk there. There's...

495
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:58,111
If you do something wrong,
the consequences could be fatal.

496
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,219
It was just light years away from the typical
American ski experience in the "80s.

497
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,727
People went berserk
and it just caught on like wildfire.

498
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,429
You know, you ask people where they were

499
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,730
when they first saw Blizzard of AAHHH"s

500
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,168
and most people can tell you
where they were.

501
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,172
It's like JFK getting shot
or something, right?

502
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,437
I mean, obviously not
something that monumental.

503
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,205
But, for a skier, the people that are fans,

504
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,737
they'll tell you where they were,
what house they were in, what town,

505
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,612
what they were doing, how old they were.

506
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,117
They know right where they were.

507
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:38,643
I was at my high school living room

508
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:45,590
and that movie had a real big impact on me,
just like it did for everybody else my age.

509
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:49,927
From that moment on, I focused
on being a professional skier.

510
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,197
And, you know,
I basically went back and told my dad

511
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,170
that I'm gonna go be in ski movies.

512
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,072
And he's like, "You're out of your mind."
I'm like, "No, I'm gonna do it."

513
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,168
You're just on the edge of your seat,
watching this thing, the whole time.

514
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:05,110
And then they get to go to Chamonix.
And they get to ski these lines

515
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,513
that nobody has ever seen before.

516
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,213
At least none of my friends,
nobody in the States, I mean...

517
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:15,623
It was just so eye-opening
and mind-boggling what they were doing.

518
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,162
I've probably watched it over
a hundred times. I mean...

519
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,259
I think we burned through
at least two VHS tapes

520
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,864
when that came out
with my friends and I watching that.

521
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:39,476
Blizzard was the first ski movie to come out
after VCRs were widely adopted.

522
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:44,214
And so it was the first ski movie
that you could watch over and over again.

523
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,855
It brought Chamonix into your living room.

524
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:54,330
It brought Chamonix to you
in a much more personal, intimate way.

525
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,604
American skiers were looking
for their own Chamonix,

526
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,974
a place to create
their own style of extreme skiing.

527
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:20,018
In 1991, the port town of Valdez, Alaska
was famous for one thing,

528
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,617
the massive oil spill
that fouled Prince William Sound.

529
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,460
But one feature of Valdez was overlooked.

530
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:33,594
Valdez is the gateway
to the Chugach Mountains.

531
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,572
A vast, uninhabited wilderness
that receives as much

532
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,972
as 80 feet of snow a year.

533
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,070
The mountains are
literally blanketed in snow.

534
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:50,117
In 1991, the town got the idea
to promote the Chugach

535
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,054
as a helicopter skiing destination

536
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:58,686
by staging an annual event called WESC,
the World Extreme Skiing Championships.

537
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:08,967
One of my sponsors had read
about this extreme skiing competition

538
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,836
and said, ""We'd like to send you there. ""

539
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:14,366
And I said, "Sure, I'm in. That'd be great."

540
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,608
And they said if you don't win, though,
you're going to have to come back

541
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,512
and paint the building.

542
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,246
And I didn't realize they were just joking
on that, but I was thinking,

543
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,753
"l don't want to paint that building."

544
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,014
Yeah. Coombsy.

545
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:35,194
So at WESC in 1991 you have the best skiers
and the toughest hills in North America.

546
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:38,132
-What's this guy's name?
-Doug Coombs.

547
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:43,230
Doug Coombs comes in, he's got this gleam
in his eye, this grin on his face.

548
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:47,573
And he skis everything
so much better than everybody else.

549
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:51,341
Stronger, cleaner, crisper,
makes it look easy.

550
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,578
There was just absolutely
no question who won.

551
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,016
-What do you have to say, Doug?
-Yeah, Doug!

552
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,920
Thanks, Valdez.

553
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:05,587
Doug won WESC in 1991 and again in 1993.

554
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:11,095
But it wasn't the competition
that drew Coombs and his wife Emily

555
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,728
back to Alaska year after year.

556
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,366
Well, when he came back,
he just said, "Em, you got to come.

557
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,433
"You got to go to Alaska.
It's just unbelievable."

558
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:24,208
He was just, you know, on fire about Alaska.
So we all went.

559
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:30,912
We'd all sort of found
this ultimate part of skiing

560
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,855
that we'd all dreamed about,
but never really imagined.

561
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:37,553
I mean, I had never imagined any places
like Valdez ever existing.

562
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:44,224
Just the vastness
and the enormous variety of terrain.

563
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,565
That's what attracted me the most.

564
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:51,074
It looked like a lifetime to ski.
And I said, "Oh, I love that."

565
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:59,578
It truly is, I think,
the best skiing zone on the planet.

566
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,016
And I can't believe it was only 15 years ago.

567
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,918
Like, why didn't someone find that
in the '80s and bring a helicopter up there?

568
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,513
It was like this gold field
in Alaska that just lay there

569
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,890
for hundreds of years,
but was never discovered.

570
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,392
The snow in Alaska is unique.

571
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:25,975
In the Chugach,
wet snow falls and sticks to everything.

572
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:32,280
Then cold, dry air comes in from the north,
pulling the moisture out of the snow.

573
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:40,154
What's left is light, soft powder
that sticks to even the steepest faces.

574
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:47,230
The velvety texture of snow in Alaska is...
There's no other.

575
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,333
Alaska's all about the velvet, that feeling,

576
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:57,635
the way it feels brushing up against
your legs and your thighs and stuff.

577
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,700
You don't get that
anywhere else in the world.

578
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:09,415
In the Chugach, the light surface snow
can slough off and follow the skier down.

579
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:15,624
It's like being on a giant wave at the ocean

580
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:19,253
and the thing's just tickling your back,
same thing up there.

581
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,058
You know,
the wave's about to crash on you,

582
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:24,157
but if you keep skiing hard
and you keep skiing the right way,

583
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,829
it's going to be there,
but it's never going to get you.

584
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:32,035
And that to me is the ultimate. I just loved it.

585
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,011
Doug was really one of the people

586
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,515
who pioneered literally
hundreds of runs up there.

587
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,810
And to think that you could actually ski
down these things,

588
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,982
you know, before anybody had done it,
is pretty phenomenal

589
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,321
because they are really steep.

590
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,795
Doug found the place
that he was meant to be.

591
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,459
It was the place that he had been...
Maybe he didn't know it,

592
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,298
but had been looking for his whole life.

593
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,999
It was the right place,
the right time and the right guy.

594
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,917
The helicopter pilot who took Doug
and his friends into the mountains

595
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:21,185
was a Vietnam veteran
named Chet Simmons.

596
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,494
I'd strap on my pistol,
put my helicopter on like a jacket

597
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:31,296
and go out into the wild unknown.
And it was great.

598
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,098
Things like this haven't happened
since the cowboy days.

599
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,401
I mean, you know,
you get on your horse, put your gun on

600
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,464
and go out and fight some lndians.

601
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,271
Well, I'd go out and fight some mountains.

602
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,074
You know, when you start skiing in
that kind of terrain up there,

603
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,013
you've got to have some sort of,
something going on in your brain.

604
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:50,543
Maybe it's a little bit of chemical imbalance
and Chet had that.

605
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,417
All of us had that.

606
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:03,365
He had a great eye for ski lines.
He knew what we wanted.

607
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,367
He would be flying up and he"d say,

608
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,335
""I don't know why you guys haven't tried
that peak yet. ""

609
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:10,635
And we'd look at it
and just get shivers up our spine.

610
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,505
And then we'd look at him
and he'd already be flying at it.

611
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,101
And you knew you were going to ski it.

612
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:23,346
Chet was a Vietnam vet pilot
that had been shot down 13 times

613
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,153
and he would come into these LZs,
landing zones,

614
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,989
and he would kind of look at you and say,

615
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,656
"You know, I'm not nervous at all."
He says, "Nobody's shooting at me."

616
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:43,799
We were the first, like, the pioneers,
and in Alaska pioneers are a big thing.

617
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:48,572
Nobody had been to these peaks.
Nobody had skied them.

618
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:49,976
Nobody even thought about it yet.

619
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,415
That first run I took in Alaska
was life-changing.

620
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,949
I've never been more scared than the time
when the helicopter took me to the top

621
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:06,291
of the summit and I'm looking at this
unbelievable peak below me going,

622
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:10,163
"Wow, we're going to ski this?
Is this safe? Am I going to die?"

623
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,529
I just thought, "Well,
either I'm going to die on this run

624
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,697
"because it's going to avalanche,
or it's going to be the best run of my life.

625
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,742
""So I'm just going to do it. It's worth it. ""

626
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,976
And I skied down and it was just effortless

627
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:28,814
and just got to the bottom and it was like,
""I can't imagine that I just did that.

628
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,877
""You know,
I would love to just do that again. ""

629
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,354
So we did.

630
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:42,126
No one could tell me where I could ski,
what I could ski, when I could ski.

631
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,191
Any of those rules, thrown out the window.

632
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,631
That was a really big freedom

633
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:50,935
and I think that freedom led
into all those first descents.

634
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:55,068
You know? There was nobody
telling me that lifts close at 5:00.

635
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:02,877
We made it happen because we couldn't
get enough of that kind of skiing.

636
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:07,117
The combination of endless lines
that hadn't been skied before

637
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:10,057
and just the adventure in this great snow.

638
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:14,894
It's where the craziest times
of the early '90s went down in skiing.

639
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:24,405
In 1995, Doug and Emily launched
Valdez Heli-Ski Guides

640
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:29,069
and together began taking
paying clients to ski in the Chugach.

641
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,715
The goal was just to keep skiing
with our friends out in the mountains.

642
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:38,515
And that's the only reason that we did it.

643
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:41,580
I mean, that was our plan,
was to take other people's money

644
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:45,219
so we could go skiing
in the greatest place in the world.

645
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:52,330
We just started out really bare bones
and it was just for the pure excitement

646
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,701
of being able to go skiing
in these big mountains

647
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:58,900
and to share the terrain with each other.

648
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:03,036
She knew how I thought
and we wouldn"t even have to talk out there.

649
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,613
Somehow we had some kind of
telepathic communication.

650
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,454
I don't know what it was, but it just worked.

651
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,512
I just felt very comfortable
with Doug in the mountains,

652
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,218
that was where we were together.

653
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,925
That was what I fell in love with,
was Doug in the mountains.

654
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:30,534
Skiers from all over the world came to be
with Doug and Emily in the Chugach.

655
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:35,135
They took them to the tops of mountains
where no one had ever been before.

656
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,610
You've gotten out of the helicopter,
and you are just afraid

657
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:46,452
to even stand there
because it"s just so completely intimidating.

658
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:50,425
And there's Doug, you know,
so casual and so calm about it.

659
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:56,295
It's just completely crazy. Completely crazy.
It's beautiful, but crazy.

660
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,771
We took heli-skiing to the extreme level.

661
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:06,199
It was amazing because we had the funds

662
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,643
from our clients to go further
and further back.

663
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:14,306
It was big-game hunting,
basically, up in Alaska.

664
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,616
Everybody has to ski Valdez once.

665
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,985
When you have a guy
from Kansas skiing 50 degrees

666
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,621
in perfect snow,
I mean, there's nothing like it.

667
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,989
He'll never forget that for the rest of his life.

668
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:43,911
Valdez became the North Shore of skiing.
Just like Maui is the North Shore of surfing.

669
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:48,816
You go there when you're
at the highest level of your game.

670
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,716
It's the total Mecca.

671
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:59,261
I can still visualize almost every
single first descent, every run I've done.

672
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:03,425
If you just transported me there
by a magic transporter on top of a peak,

673
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,628
I would tell you exactly where we were.
It would be no problem.

674
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,297
That's how vivid the memories are.

675
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:15,172
Doug Coombs put
Chugach heli-skiing on the map.

676
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:22,085
Like Chamonix a generation earlier,
skiers now make the pilgrimage to Alaska.

677
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,991
Showing up in Alaska for the first time,

678
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,293
everybody says
it's a mind-blowing experience,

679
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,629
it's an eye opener, all that stuff.

680
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,693
And it truly is,
because it's not like riding lifts

681
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:45,469
and skiing, you know, 1,000 vertical.
It's a different program.

682
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,547
And it's real.
That's real big mountain skiing.

683
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,008
Shane McConkey became
a big mountain skier

684
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,782
performing for the cameras in Alaska.

685
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,386
Standing on top of those peaks in Alaska is,

686
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,760
to me, one of the coolest feelings
that I've ever had in my life.

687
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:11,824
It's all up to you at that point to,
like, take care of yourself.

688
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,267
And it's a pretty cool feeling,

689
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,804
knowing you're about to do
something dangerous,

690
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,806
and about to drop in.

691
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,468
It's... It's really addictive.

692
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:29,150
Guys like Shane McConkey started
doing things in the mountains in Alaska

693
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,709
that they couldn't do anywhere else.

694
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:34,052
You couldn't ski the backcountry
in Jackson Hole that way.

695
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:37,651
You couldn't ski Aspen that way
or Squaw Valley, even, that way.

696
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:42,130
It's too short. You don't have enough room
to go big and to go that fast.

697
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:46,430
But in Alaska, all of a sudden your canvas
is five times bigger, and steeper,

698
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,666
and the snow is better
than it is anywhere else.

699
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,973
Alaska expanded the idea
of what is possible on skis.

700
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,881
And a new generation of skiers,
many inspired by The Blizzard of AAHHH's,

701
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:06,751
are coming here to make
their mark in ski films.

702
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:13,087
Ski films nowadays
are all about high speed,

703
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,792
huge air, showmanship,
style, explosiveness.

704
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,766
You know, just taking it to the mountain.

705
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:26,204
Chris Davenport won the World Extreme
Skiing Championships in 1996

706
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,734
and has been performing
in ski films ever since.

707
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,348
The ski filmmaker wants
to shred the mountain apart

708
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:37,386
and show off their skiing for the camera.

709
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,488
And when I'm in a ski film,

710
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,151
I'm trying to make as few turns as possible,

711
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,422
because I want to make it look
just death-defying.

712
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,986
I want to make it look exciting

713
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,726
and I want to make it look like somebody
just lit a firecracker in my pants

714
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,463
and I'm trying to get down
the mountain as fast as I can.

715
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,369
When you get up on top of a ridge,

716
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,037
and you've got a perfectly
smooth curtain of snow,

717
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:06,013
almost like a shower curtain
hanging down with maybe a spine

718
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:09,916
or a flute of snow,
it's like you're a kid in a playground.

719
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,482
Hopping from one side
of the curtain back to the other,

720
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:16,992
or on a pillow or catching a small air.

721
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,891
You know, your slough's going to the right.
I'm going left.

722
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:22,056
I'm going to cross underneath
my slough and let it go off a cliff.

723
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,122
And you're just kind of thinking to yourself,

724
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,398
""How can I choreograph this run
so it"s just playful and fun?""

725
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,602
When somebody makes it look fun on film,
you say, that's cool.

726
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,205
That's what I want to do.
And it inspires your skiing.

727
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,022
Ingrid Backstrom was discovered
in Squaw Valley, California,

728
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,227
by filmmaker Scott Gaffney.

729
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:05,606
Ingrid is special in that she's a guy
with a ponytail in the manner she skis.

730
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,441
I saw this woman ripping Squaw

731
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,710
and you'd be sitting on a chair
and a guy would be like,

732
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,547
""Wow, that guy rips. ""

733
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,923
And then I just kind of sit there like,
"l know that chick. Yep, she rips."

734
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:32,761
Ingrid's very first run
in a ski film was in 2004.

735
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:37,399
She traveled with Matchstick Productions
to Bella Coola, British Columbia,

736
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:40,806
with skiers Shane McConkey
and Hugo Harrison.

737
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:46,238
The first line of the day was... Hugo said,

738
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,783
""Oh, I skied this line last year,

739
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,650
"l wanna go back to the Harrison Motel
and ski it again."

740
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,855
The first thing that happens is
Hugo drops into this line that he's skied,

741
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,659
you know, probably five times.

742
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,566
And all I can see is Hugo
just cartwheeling out the bottom.

743
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:16,538
So I'm up there all by myself kind of like,
""Hugo, who never falls,

744
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,776
"just took the hardest crash
I've ever seen anybody take."

745
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,409
And, you know,
it kind of got me a little nervous.

746
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:28,216
I could see the helicopter
firing up down in the valley

747
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,749
and just really supercharged energy.

748
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:36,962
The helicopter gets closer and they give
their little wave or their foot kick

749
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,523
that says, ""We're ready. ""

750
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:42,594
And at that point I don't even know,
I think my brain probably shut off

751
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:45,402
and I just dropped in and went for it.

752
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,010
This is what you dream about skiing.

753
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:04,191
I just remember skiing out the bottom
and it was so fast that it was just a blur.

754
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,960
But it was
one of the most incredible feelings ever.

755
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,327
She comes charging off the ridge,
whack over the rocks,

756
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:17,806
and like four turns down to the bottom
at like 50 miles an hour.

757
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:22,141
I caught maybe the first turn from the heli.

758
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:26,511
And then we were sitting up there
just dumbfounded because she was gone.

759
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,716
We were just like, "All right,
that's gonna be

760
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:33,779
"the next big mountain skier chick
right there for sure."

761
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,756
She's good.

762
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,230
For me,
like the beginning part of my season,

763
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,891
I'm just like everybody else.

764
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,697
I'm at the mountain hiking for my turns.

765
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:26,005
But then, you know, the film season
starts coming in around January, February,

766
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,838
and it's off to heli-land.

767
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,557
Seth Morrison has made the big mountains

768
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:50,031
his place to explore
what a skier can do in the air.

769
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,834
Seth Morrison is a cat.

770
01:02:56,906 --> 01:03:02,310
He can control his body in the air
and on the snow as good as anybody ever.

771
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:14,479
He is a light wiry guy
who's incredibly coordinated,

772
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:18,755
incredibly athletic, could probably excel
at any number of sports,

773
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,921
but he's a skier.

774
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:32,032
He has redefined what's possible on skis,
redefined the style of how to do it on skis.

775
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,704
He is a legend.

776
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:43,242
No one can stick a landing exactly
where he wants to quite like Seth can.

777
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:58,564
You take these risks
because it's the ultimate, man.

778
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,295
It's all about the powder

779
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:03,736
and just the experience
of being out in the mountains.

780
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,668
Flying in the helicopter
is the other half of it.

781
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,973
Getting dropped off on some crazy peak

782
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:14,107
where the heli
just has to like come in sideways

783
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,152
and just stop and hover and let you out.

784
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,749
That's like the best landing ever

785
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,450
when it's just room enough
for you up there.

786
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,730
Deep powder.

787
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,394
That's all that matters.

788
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:39,104
When you get one of those runs
that everything goes right,

789
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,702
where you ski the steep fresh pow
and nail your air

790
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,643
and everything is perfect,

791
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:50,380
you know, like nothing's better, you know,
flying through the air off a cliff just...

792
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,136
We're always looking for that next thing.

793
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,369
We're always looking for something new.

794
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,435
And at this day and age,
it's hard to find those things.

795
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,674
But they're still out there.

796
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,681
Right on. You guys ready?

797
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:32,194
-I am, yeah.
-Very nice and early.

798
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,161
Dude, what trick are you gonna do?

799
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,165
I'm not sure. Still thinking about that one.

800
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,999
You'll figure it out
when we get out there, right?

801
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:45,436
It's a beautiful day.

802
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,101
Good wind.

803
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,804
I don't think I'm an adrenaline junkie,

804
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:53,371
but I sure do love those kind of things
that give you adrenaline.

805
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,882
What are you gonna do?

806
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,579
Possibly a flying squirrel of some type.

807
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,520
For me, it's all about trying new things,

808
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,217
something I haven't tried before
but I think that's possible.

809
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,591
""Hey, what if we do it?"" ""Hey, totally, dude,
we should try it this way. ""

810
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,960
-All right.
-Yeah, dude, have a good jump.

811
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,328
-Yeah.
-Enjoy.

812
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,264
Awesome.

813
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,169
Triple gainer, yeah?

814
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:21,267
It's all about getting creative and original
with different ideas and to do fun stuff.

815
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:27,308
Everyone else is going, "You're crazy.
You've got no fear," stuff like that.

816
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,284
But I don't see it that way.

817
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:32,651
-Yeah, Shane, nice one.
-Ready, set...

818
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,451
Watch out for that porcupine
in the landing area.

819
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:35,751
See you.

820
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,899
With the addition of a parachute
to my ski gear,

821
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:06,278
I'm looking at these mountains with totally
different goggles than all the other skiers.

822
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:12,152
There's a lot of lines that are really
aesthetic, really cool-looking lines,

823
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,622
that you can't do
because it ends in a big, giant cliff.

824
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,922
Well, if you throw a parachute on your back
and you have some BASE-jumping skills,

825
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,586
you can totally ski those lines.

826
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,510
For most of us it's a stunt.

827
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,641
It's completely crazy and kooky,
but for Shane it isn't.

828
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,242
I mean, if you have that ability
to BASE-jump,

829
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:49,553
and you have the ability to ski some
of the steepest, most radical things around,

830
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,025
putting the two of those together
makes complete sense.

831
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,829
It makes total sense. Why not?

832
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,332
I got to ski a line a couple years ago
in Bella Coola

833
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,767
that was a big, open powder field,
really nice snow

834
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,361
that came, that rolled over

835
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:08,069
and then came down into this choke
with ice on one side and rock on the other

836
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,807
and then it opened up again
to this big, slanting ramp

837
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,712
that ended in a massive cliff.

838
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:28,324
Above that ramp was
like a flat spot with a kicker.

839
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:31,332
You know, I got to ski that powder field
down through the crux

840
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,631
and then boom, off the kicker. 500-foot cliff.

841
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:39,304
And that was amazing.
You can't do that without a parachute.

842
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,987
Complacency is what gets everybody.

843
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:09,231
Accidents, deaths, problems,
you know, whatever, you know.

844
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,129
And I find myself getting
complacent in places.

845
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,268
Like when I was in Alaska
for year after year after year,

846
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,780
I was setting off class three avalanches,
six-foot fractures,

847
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:22,442
four-foot fractures,
going 1,000 meters, 3,000 feet.

848
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,544
Oh, darn it! Too bad I ruined the mountain.

849
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,953
You know, let's go on to the next slope,
but, you know,

850
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:31,322
you're looking down there at 50, 60 feet
of snow that you could be buried under.

851
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,452
And it's like I almost got numb to it.

852
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,926
Something in the back of my mind just said,

853
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:41,970
""Why don't you just step back
and take a look at all this?""

854
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:44,335
And so I left Alaska.

855
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,817
La Meije is the peak that looms over
the small French village of La Grave.

856
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:01,250
La Grave is like Chamonix 50 years ago,

857
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:05,718
a wild, alpine world
with a lift to take you there.

858
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:12,161
It's where Doug Coombs and his family
now spend part of each year.

859
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:18,204
Well, we fell in love with France
and La Grave partly for the chocolate

860
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,300
and the red wine,
but mostly for the mountains.

861
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,505
The power of the mountain
and the mystique of La Meije.

862
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,107
And we were just drawn to it.

863
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:32,643
It's very raw and wild and it has moods,
ups and downs. But we thrived on that.

864
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:36,816
Everyone said it was
the last frontier of wild skiing.

865
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:39,622
You know, it's ski sauvage, as they say.

866
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,724
I instantly felt like I belong there.

867
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,694
That was fun.

868
01:11:56,912 --> 01:12:00,473
Okay, let's go to town,
we'll go to the bakery.

869
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:03,575
We'll go buy some bread.
Wanna go to the store?

870
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,786
You can instantly get off the lift here

871
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:16,229
and get in the most amazing,
dangerous situations of your life.

872
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:21,895
You can go from sipping a nice cafe au lait
to almost killing yourself in five minutes.

873
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:26,374
I mean, to be able to have that freedom
of just wandering off the mountain

874
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,639
and getting into this wild spot right away.

875
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:34,740
You know, right from the restaurant,
it's like no other, no other, and I love it.

876
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:39,049
One, two, three, four, five.

877
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,022
Ten.

878
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,687
-Eleven.
-Twelve.

879
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,227
Fourteen.

880
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:50,458
-Fifteen.
-Fifteen.

881
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,022
Seventeen.

882
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:56,504
I haven't been slowing down very much.
A little here, and a little there, but...

883
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,807
I don't know how Emily puts up with me.

884
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:04,812
I think my wife is super tolerant.
She must think I'm just a complete kook.

885
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,815
She always calls me that. But I don't know,

886
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:11,512
I think she's the most tolerant person
in the whole world.

887
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:21,959
And to make me stop doing something
that I love, she knows it is not possible.

888
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:46,385
On April 3, 2006,

889
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:50,824
Doug Coombs died in a skiing accident
in the mountains above La Grave.

890
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:57,094
He fell to his death trying to reach a friend

891
01:13:57,166 --> 01:14:02,001
who had slipped and fallen off a cliff
while skiing the Polichinelle couloir.

892
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,270
We never questioned our life.

893
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:15,077
The other people might have, but we knew
that the risk that we encountered

894
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,277
was worth every bit of it.

895
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,720
He knew and I knew,
you're never above the mountains.

896
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,453
Mountains have always had the last say.

897
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:30,455
Mostly they give,

898
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,966
mostly the mountains just give you
incredible amounts of pleasure.

899
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:36,061
And sometimes they swallow you up.

900
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,901
I just can't imagine a better way
for Doug to have gone,

901
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,546
even if it was too soon.

902
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,089
You know what they say
in the mountains around here,

903
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:59,287
all the birds, all the blackbirds,
that's a dead person.

904
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,988
And there's a lot of birds
in the mountains here.

905
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,158
And they're all blackbirds.

906
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:09,269
That's their spirits flying around.
That's the rumor.

907
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,569
And there are a lot of deaths here,
because the mountains are so intense.

908
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,043
They're so gnarly, they"re so big,

909
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:21,048
and they can be so friendly one day
and so mean the next.

910
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:28,846
I remember being really shocked
when a friend died skiing.

911
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:32,690
And then the next friend died skiing.
And then the next friend died skiing.

912
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:37,130
And you're like, I don't know what it is,
it's weird, you just become numb to it.

913
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:44,036
It's still terrible, and you don't like it,
but it doesn't make you stop.

914
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:51,341
I hate seeing people that I know die,
but I know it's gonna happen.

915
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,579
I think that's just part of it.

916
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:59,380
It's like saying you know someone
who's died in a car accident.

917
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:03,948
You know, what's worse, a car accident,
or falling off the mountain?

918
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:07,484
I don't know,
I think the car accident's worse.

919
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:11,761
At least when they're falling off the
mountain, they loved what they were doing.

920
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:36,455
I was just getting ready to tell him,
if he runs into any of my family out there,

921
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,784
to steer clear of us.

922
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,384
Let's jump right in to that real quick

923
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:44,865
and take a phone call from Andrew McLean
calling from Iceland.

924
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:48,460
-Good morning, Andrew.
-Top of the morning to you, trail master.

925
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,599
Top of the morning to you, sir.
How's the weather in Iceland?

926
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:55,131
Well, the weather in lceland is a lot
like our last trip to Patagonia.

927
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,576
I woke up and I wasn't really sure
where we were.

928
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:01,309
It's dumping snow, a total white-out,
and we're camped on a glacier.

929
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:03,317
It's kind of like deja vu.

930
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:06,345
I'm kind of wondering
what we're doing here.

931
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,515
Okay, Andrew,
for people that aren't familiar,

932
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,650
you were up here doing a little skiing

933
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:14,855
and decided Iceland had not been skied
a whole lot

934
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,091
so it was a great place to take off to.

935
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:21,602
Yup, so the skiing terrain up here
is phenomenal.

936
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,729
What we're doing is called
ski mountaineering.

937
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:26,467
And that's where you hike up
and then ski down.

938
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:29,908
And we're specifically looking
for steeper slopes

939
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:33,880
Iike couloirs and slopes
that are above 40 degrees.

940
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,076
And there's no shortage of them up here.

941
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:39,552
We can't see them at the moment,
but we know they're out there.

942
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:46,923
But just kind of reading some big,
thick, fat books and waiting it out.

943
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:01,670
Andrew McLean is a throwback.

944
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,077
He calls himself a ""ski mountaineer. ""

945
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:10,274
Like Bill Briggs, like the first extreme skiers
around Chamonix,

946
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:15,085
his passion is simply to climb
steep mountains and ski down them.

947
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:21,193
No helicopters,
no starring roles in ski movies.

948
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:27,694
Just Andrew and friends exploring
the remote corners of the world on skis.

949
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:34,065
I've never really taken skiing that seriously.

950
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,440
I've always just looked at it
as kind of like a hobby and, you know,

951
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:42,006
I'm going to get a real job and a real career,
and, you know, get with the program.

952
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,978
But what always happens is, you know,

953
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,715
I'll have the opportunity
to kind of get with the program

954
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:50,849
and then there will be like a ski trip.

955
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,992
And it will be like, well, you know,
I'll do the ski trip first

956
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:57,156
and then, you know,
I'll get with the program.

957
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:03,227
You know, 20 years later, you know,
it's like skiing always takes precedence

958
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:05,364
over getting with the program.

959
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:12,510
At some point you just have to realize like,
well, okay, you know, maybe this is,

960
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:17,280
you know, more of a full-time thing,
and I should just accept it as it is.

961
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:18,842
It's my destiny.

962
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:36,161
Ski mountaineering, I look at it
as kind of between-the-cracks exploration.

963
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:40,508
All these mountains,
people haven't been into them.

964
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:44,011
They've never been skied.
They've never been explored.

965
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,910
You can be a modern-day explorer.

966
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:50,145
And it may not be as significant as going
to the moon or the bottom of the ocean,

967
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:54,245
but from just a common standpoint
it's a great method

968
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,222
to get out and explore the world.

969
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:06,767
Andrew McLean has explored
remote mountains on seven continents.

970
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:13,065
This is the peninsula of the Giants
on the north coast of Iceland.

971
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:17,842
This is where Andrew and two friends,
Matt Turley and Dylan Freed,

972
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:20,711
have come to climb and ski.

973
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:34,354
I like doing steep skiing
and I like doing remote skiing,

974
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:37,694
and I like doing
complicated, technical skiing

975
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:41,224
which could also be considered
dangerous skiing to some people.

976
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,901
It doesn't seem that dangerous when
you have been doing it for a long time.

977
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:47,237
It seems almost commonplace.

978
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:49,300
But taking a dangerous situation

979
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:53,871
and kind of figuring out how to do it safely,
that's the ideal.

980
01:20:56,318 --> 01:21:00,880
Andrew McLean,
he's the real extreme skier in the bunch.

981
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:09,024
He's going on these trips
that are a million miles away from anything.

982
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:13,261
You're skiing 55-degree slopes.

983
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:16,702
You slip up, there's nothing there
to save you. You're done.

984
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:27,276
There's not very many people out there
pushing that envelope and for good reason,

985
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:31,752
because many of the people
that have pushed that envelope,

986
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,720
they're not with us anymore.

987
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:40,791
Andrew McLean continues that tradition
of skiing the ultimate extreme.

988
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:05,780
Having friends die and seeing friends die
and being involved in accidents

989
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:09,051
definitely does give me pause.

990
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:13,290
When I was involved in my first
avalanche fatality, I just was like,

991
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,829
""That's it, I'm not skiing anymore. ""

992
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,465
But I think I'm a slow learner.
You know, I just rationalize it.

993
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:22,526
I have what's called creative rationalization.

994
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,936
I always think,
well, you know, this was an accident.

995
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,975
It happened because
of these foreseeable circumstances

996
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:32,275
and those won't happen again.
But it's always something else that happens.

997
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:39,351
This was Andrew's 15th day
in the mountains of Iceland.

998
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:45,993
Holy crap.

999
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:08,140
-Dylan, you okay?
-Andrew!

1000
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,943
-Andrew, Dylan.
-You okay?

1001
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:15,288
-Dylan, you okay?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

1002
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,585
Holy...

1003
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:20,124
Holy shit!

1004
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,096
Oh, my God.

1005
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:29,926
Oh, my gosh.

1006
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:37,809
Wow.

1007
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,516
I'm very glad to be alive.

1008
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,456
Glad you're all right, Dyl.

1009
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,086
There, Dylan.

1010
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:01,702
-That was cool. Full value, huh?
-Oh, man.

1011
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:11,077
If I really want to avoid being caught
or dying in an avalanche,

1012
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,843
it's not the idea ofjust scaling back
on my skiing activities.

1013
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,282
It's more completely stopping.

1014
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:25,122
I know it's dangerous, but if I give it up,
what's the future going to be like?

1015
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:28,253
Is it just going to be sitting at a desk job?

1016
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:31,560
You know, you need to figure that
what's going to take the place of that.

1017
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,396
Where are you going
to get the same adventure

1018
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:35,595
or same excitement out of your life?

1019
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:42,934
It's just something about mountains

1020
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:47,243
that really appeals to me
on a very basic DNA level.

1021
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:49,846
I'm just a mountain person.

1022
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:05,089
Those of us that want the risk
and want the challenge

1023
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,930
are going to do it one way or another,

1024
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:12,167
whether it's in the mountains
or it's on a racetrack

1025
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,175
or floating down the river.

1026
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:21,075
This should be a common thing
for man to be doing.

1027
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:25,350
I think we get a little bit too safe
in our lives these days.

1028
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:35,022
I had a romantic vision of the mountains.

1029
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:41,531
The mountains represented something
different from a mass of rock.

1030
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:48,801
To me the mountains were the possibility
to discover life and discover myself.

1031
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,939
It's a different world.

1032
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,575
It's extreme. You risk your life.

1033
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:02,049
But if we decide to live this way,

1034
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:05,615
it can give you
a lot of pleasure and emotion.

1035
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:08,389
And that's what you need in your life.

1036
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,768
I'd be lying if I said I was never scared but,

1037
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:17,532
you know, I think the risks are well worth it.

1038
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:25,946
Gliding down a slope with such peaceful
and graceful ease, no resistance.

1039
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:29,276
Something I've done all my life

1040
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,649
and I want to continue to do
to the day I die.
