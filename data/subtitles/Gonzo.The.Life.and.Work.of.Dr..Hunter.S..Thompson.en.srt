on the left side.

out at the 20-yard line
and a big...

5
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:44,411
Sondi Wright:
HE'D KNOWN FOR
A LONG TIME

6
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,812
THAT HE WAS NO LONGER
A REALLY GOOD WRITER.

7
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:49,378
HE HAD SPURTS.

8
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,079
Douglas Brinkley:
HE LOST THAT GONZO EDGE.

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,678
( TV sports announcer

10
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:57,344
Tom Wolfe:
I WONDER WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO OLD HUNTER.

11
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,678
HE'S KIND OF LOSING IT.

12
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:04,378
Charles Perry:
CREATIVELY, HE HAD WRITTEN
ALL HIS GREAT STUFF.

13
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:07,179
HE HADN'T
BEEN REALLY PRODUCTIVE
FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS.

14
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:10,179
I THINK HE JUST HAD
RUN OUT OF JUICE.

15
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,079
Brinkley:
IN HUNTER'S LAST YEARS--

16
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,611
IN ORDER TO REALLY GET
THE JUICES STIRRED UP
IN HIM--

17
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:17,411
IN WHAT WE CALL
QUINTESSENTIAL HUNTER--

18
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,145
IT TOOK SOMETHING LIKE--

19
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,745
IT HAD TO ALMOST A FEEL
LIKE A KICK IN THE GROIN.

20
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:27,611
Johnny Depp:
"IT WAS JUST AFTER DAWN
IN WOODY CREEK, COLORADO,

WRITING ABOUT SPORTS,

00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,678

FOR ANYONE AS BAFFLED
AS GEORGE W BUSH.

52

A NATIONAL SECURITY EMERGENCY

word has died.

59

Hunter S Thompson
was a lot of things--

60
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:41,812
a journalist,
an author, a patriot,

61
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:44,079
a professional
troublemaker,

62
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:47,678
a complex
walking monument
to misbehavior

63
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:51,079
who apparently
took his own life
with a gun last night.

"IT WAS ALWAYS AT NIGHT,
LIKE A WEREWOLF,

THAT I WOULD
TAKE THE THING OUT

00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,645
FOR AN HONEST RUN
DOWN THE COAST.

67
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:01,344
I WOULD START
IN GOLDEN GATE PARK,

TO RUN A FEW LONG CURVES
TO CLEAR MY HEAD."

I'D BE OUT AT THE BEACH

OF THE ENGINE IN MY EARS,

ON THE SEA WALL

AND A FINE EMPTY ROAD
STRETCHING ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO SANTA CRUZ.

76

THERE WAS NO HELMET
ON THOSE NIGHTS,

NO SPEED LIMIT
AND NO COOLING IT DOWN
AROUND THE CURVES.

FORGETTING THE CARS

79

AND LETTING THE BEAST
WIND OUT-- 35, 45.

80

THEN INTO THIRD,
NOT WORRIED ABOUT GREEN
OR RED SIGNALS

81

WEREWOLF LOONY.

NO HONEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT

WHO REALLY KNOW WHERE IT IS

THE OTHERS--
THE LIVING--

CONTROL AS FAR AS THEY FELT
THEY COULD HANDLE IT,

AND THEN PULLED BACK,
OR SLOWED DOWN.

IS STILL OUT THERE."

please?

I MET HUNTER IN THE '60s

101
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,411
A SHORT TIME BEFORE
HE WROTE THE BOOK ON US.

102
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:22,079
AND HE WENT ON TO BECOME

103
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,945
PROBABLY ONE
OF THE GREATEST WRITERS

104
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:25,945
THAT AMERICA WILL EVER HAVE.

105
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,745
DOESN'T MEAN HE ISN'T
A JERK IN MY EYES,

106
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:29,578
BUT HE'S
A VERY GOOD WRITER.

107

HUNTER REMINDS ME
SO MUCH OF MARK TWAIN.

108
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:38,445
HE WAS A REPORTER-- TWAIN
STARTED OUT AS A REPORTER--

109
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:40,378
WITH A WILD IMAGINATION

110
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:42,378
AND HE'S NOT
TRYING TO FOOL YOU.

111
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:46,445
YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT
HE IS FILTERING REALITY

112
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:48,578
THROUGH WHAT HUNTER
CALLED GONZO.

113

Will the real Hunter
Thompson please stand up?

OH, NO! GOD!
HELP US, JESUS!

120
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,712
I KNOW IT.
IT'S IN MY INTEREST--

121
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:20,778
MAYBE IN THE INTEREST
OF GREATEST GOOD--

122
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:23,012
FOR ME TO SMOKE
A JOINT AND CALM DOWN.

HE WAS NOT AFRAID
TO ROCK THE BOAT,

TO CHALLENGE
THE ESTABLISHMENT

125
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:31,978
AND EXPRESS HIMSELF
IN UNIQUE AND RADICAL,
SOMETIMES SHOCKING, WAYS.

RUNNING AROUND THE PARAPETS
OF NIXON'S ALAMO.

128

WE WERE ALL AMUSED
BY HIM.

129
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,311
HE WAS AN INTERESTING GUY
TO BE AROUND.

130
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:47,845
HE ASKED YOU
UNEXPECTED QUESTIONS.

131
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:51,278
MOST PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED
THAT I WALK ON TWO LEGS.

132
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:54,912
I THINK PEOPLE THINK
I'M... VERY MUCH--

133
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:57,378
MAYBE A VIOLENT VERSION
OF THAT COMIC STRIP.

134
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:06,611
THIS IS THE LAST DRAWING
I DID OF HIM SO FAR.

135
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,845
"MY GOD! I MUSTA MISSED--
IT'S HELL DOWN HERE!!"

136

( chuckles )

Ralph Steadman:
HE'S PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES
AS MUCH AS HE COULD.

138
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:17,812
LIFE TO HIM WAS
THE CHALLENGE.

139
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:19,411
HE WAS GONNA BE DEAD
AT 30, ANYWAY,

140
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,344
SO NOW HE WAS LIVING
ON BORROWED TIME.

IT IS OVER A YEAR

143
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:46,179
SINCE YOU SET THE SCENE
FOR YOUR STRANGELY-
PLANNED SUICIDE.

144
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,311
THE MESSAGES THAT I HAVE
RECEIVED FROM YOU

145
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:51,545
UP TO THE BUSH/KERRY
ELECTION OF 2004

146
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:54,845
WERE INFECTED
BY A DISMAL UNDERTONE.

147
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:58,511
'IF BUSH WINS,' YOU SAID,
'THE PLANET IS DOOMED.'

148
00:08:58,511 --> 00:09:02,278
WHEN YOU PULLED
THE TRIGGER ON YOUR MAGNUM .44,

149
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,645
MY FIRST
REACTION WAS TO SAY,
'ABOUT BLOODY TIME.

150
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,211
HE'S BEEN THREATENING
TO DO THAT FOR YEARS.'

151
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,912
YOU WERE
NEVER REASONABLE,
AND YOU KNEW,

152
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,778
IN SPITE
OF YOUR WAYWARD SPIRIT,

153
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:14,712
YOU WERE NOT INVINCIBLE.

154
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:17,812
THOSE WHO
GREW TO BE A THREAT
TO YOUR AMERICA

155
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:19,478
CONTINUE TO BURGEON.

156
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:23,045
FOR YOU, IT WAS
VICTORY OR GAME OVER.

157
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:27,244
I JUST WANTED YOU TO HANG
AROUND AND NAIL THE BEAUTY

158
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:29,411
OF THAT IMAGE
OF ABSOLUTE EVIL.

159
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:34,478
BUT YOU LEAVE US
WITH A BLUEPRINT,
OLD SPORT.

160
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:36,478
TAKE IT UP
WITH THE GODS.

161
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:39,611
SEND WORD.
RALPH."

162

Wright:
I THINK HE WAS IMPORTANT

163
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:45,378
IN A LITERARY WAY

164
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:48,712
AND ALSO
IN A POLITICAL WAY.

165
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:52,945
AND I THINK THAT
HIS STORY IS TRAGIC.

166
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:56,145
HE WAS LOVING.

167
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:58,912
HE WAS GENEROUS.

168
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:01,912
ON THE OTHER END
OF THE SPECTRUM,

169
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,179
THE BOY IN THE MAN

170
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,179
WAS ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS.

171
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,012
GOD DAMN, YOU DUMBASS!
REACH UNDER THERE

172
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,311
- AND GET SOME
GODDAMNED MEDICINE!
- Man: OVER HERE?

173
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:12,244
TO THE RIGHT.

174
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,478
Anita Thompson:
HUNTER HAD TWO EXTREMES
IN HIM

175
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:17,012
THAT HE LIVED WITH
CONSTANTLY--

176
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:18,745
THE GENEROUS,
BEAUTIFUL HUNTER

177
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:20,745
AND THE SCARY,
MEAN, CRUEL HUNTER.

178
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,445
AND HE WAS AWARE
OF BOTH.

179
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:26,511
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS
IN CONTROL OF BOTH
ALL THE TIME,

180
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:28,179
BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY
AWARE OF BOTH.

181
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,045
AND THEY BECAME
PRESENT IN HIS LIFE

182
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:31,878
WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG--
BOTH SIDES.

183
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:34,812
( jazz music playing )

184
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:43,445
Brinkley:
YOU'VE GOTTA GO BACK
TO LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,

185
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:46,311
TO UNDERSTAND HIM.
HIS FATHER DIED WHEN
HE WAS YOUNG.

186
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:49,244
SO YOU HAD A MOTHER
RAISING THREE BOYS

187
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:51,244
ON A LIBRARIAN SALARY.

188
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:53,378
HE LIVED-- IT WASN'T
EVEN MIDDLE CLASS,

189
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,712
IT WAS A LOWER-
MIDDLE-CLASS EXISTENCE.

190
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:57,845
HIS FRIENDS WERE THE RICH
KIDS OF LOUISVILLE,

191
00:10:57,845 --> 00:10:59,945
THE ONES THAT
HAD ALL THE PRIVILEGE.

192
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:02,378
SO HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE RAILROAD TRACKS.

193
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:05,411
YET, HUNTER WAS VERY SMART,
NATURALLY INTELLIGENT,

194
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,778
AND HE ALWAYS FELT
A BIT LIKE THE OUTSIDER.

195
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,945
HE WAS A REAL HELLION
ON VANDALISM.

196
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:17,611
THE SEMINAL EXPERIENCE
WAS WHEN HE AND A GROUP
OF BUDDIES

197
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,545
WERE PARTYING
AND SMOKING CIGARETTES

198
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,978
AND DRINKING BEER.
THEY WERE ALL ARRESTED.

199
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:24,678
THE RICH KIDS WHO KNEW
THE JUDGES GOT OUT.

200
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,678
HUNTER NEVER GOT TO WALK
FOR GRADUATION.

201
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:28,278
HE WAS IN JAIL.

202
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:30,645
Depp:
"I COULD SEE THE MOON
HUNG HIGH IN THE SKY

203
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:33,079
WITH A MOCKING GRIN
ON HIS FACE.

204
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,878
I SEIZED THE BARS,
AND SHRIEKED AND WAILED

205
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,545
LIKE A SOUL
WHO'S LOST IN HELL."

206
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:40,945
Wright:
ESSENTIALLY, INSIDE...

207
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:44,344
HUNTER WAS AN AGONIZED
HUMAN BEING.

208
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:46,611
BUT HE ALSO FELT

209
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,611
LIKE HE HAD
THE POTENTIAL

210
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:52,611
OF BEING
A REALLY GREAT WRITER.

211
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:56,278
Brinkley:
"THE GREAT GATSBY" IS HOW
HUNTER LEARNED TO WRITE.

212
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,179
HE WOULD TYPE
"THE GREAT GATSBY"
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

213
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,411
JUST TO LEARN
THE MUSIC OF FITZGERALD.

214
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:05,712
"THE GREAT GATSBY"
WAS FILLED WITH ANGER

215
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:08,378
THAT THE WHOLE DEAL
IN AMERICAN LIFE WAS RIGGED.

216
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:11,812
HUNTER IDENTIFIED
WITH FITZGERALD I'D SAY
MORE THAN ANY OTHER WRITER.

217
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:15,278
THE DIFFERENCE IS
FITZGERALD WOULD LOOK IN
ON THE CANDY STORE WINDOW,

218
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,712
LOOK IN ON THE STOREFRONTS
OF THE RICH.

219
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:19,645
HUNTER WANTED
TO SMASH THE WINDOWS.

220
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:27,545
Wright:
HUNTER WAS EXTREMELY
SEDUCTIVE.

221
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:29,778
I WAS VERY ATTRACTED
TO HUNTER.

222
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:32,311
HIS ENERGY
WAS JUST PHENOMENAL.

223
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:34,311
HE WROTE EVERY DAY.

224
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:37,645
HE WAS GETTING PAID
$100 FOR AN ARTICLE
OR SOMETHING,

225
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,712
BUT WE WERE VERY POOR.

226
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:42,411
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT
WITH MY SON,

227
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,778
HUNTER SHOT ELK
AND I ATE ELK LIVER,

228
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:47,411
MILK AND SALAD, PERIOD.
THAT'S ALL I ATE.

229
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:51,179
Brinkley:
HERE WAS A GUY
STRUGGLING.

230
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,311
HE HAD HIS WIFE SONDI
WITH HIM.

231
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,079
HE WAS LIVING
ON A FREELANCER,

232
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,311
CHECK TO CHECK,
BARELY ABLE TO PAY RENT.

233
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,311
SO WHEN HE GOT
THE ASSIGNMENT

234
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,244
FROM CAREY MCWILLIAMS
OF "THE NATION"

235
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,045
TO WRITE ABOUT THIS
PHENOMENON-- HELL'S ANGELS--

236
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:04,745
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

237
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:06,411
Man:
"I, Hunter Thompson,
am a writer.

238
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,112
Recently, I spent
over a year living

239
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:11,179
in close contact
with a notorious

240
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,678
California motorcycle gang
which is the basis

241
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:15,678
of my new book,
'Hell's Angels.'"

242
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:18,478
- Signed
"Hunter Thompson."
- ( applause )

243
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:24,079
Uh, number two,
approximately how many members
do the Hell's Angels have?

244
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,578
It varies.
Anywhere from--

245
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:28,578
I'd say 100 to 200.

246
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:30,645
( rock music playing )

247
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,912
Brinkley:
HUNTER INFILTRATED
THE STORY.

248
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,045
HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF
A PHOTOJOURNALIST.

249
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:39,179
IN HIS EARLY
APPLICATIONS FOR JOBS,

250
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:41,045
HE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING
TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER.

251
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:48,511
Depp:
"THE SIGHT OF A PHOTOGRAPHER
INVARIABLY WHIPS THE ANGELS

252
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:52,645
INTO A KISSING FRENZY.
THIS IS A GUARANTEED
SQUARE-JOLTER,

253
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:55,145
AND THE ANGELS
ARE GLEEFULLY AWARE
OF THE REACTION IT GETS.

254
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:57,812
'THEY CAN'T STAND IT,'
SAYS TERRY.

255
00:13:57,812 --> 00:13:59,678
'IT BLOWS THEIR MINDS
EVERY TIME--

256
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:02,411
ESPECIALLY
THE TONGUE BIT.'"

257
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,645
Wolfe: IT IS ONE
OF THE BRAVURA PIECES
OF REPORTING OF ALL TIME.

258
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,645
HE ACTUALLY, AS THEY SAY,
RAN WITH THE ANGELS FOR--

259
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:11,179
HE WAS EMBEDDED,
YOU KNOW?

260
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,344
HE WAS EMBEDDED
IN THE HELL'S ANGELS
BATTALION.

261
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:16,278
( rock music playing )

262
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:27,311
Depp:
"THE MENACE IS LOOSE AGAIN.

263
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:30,012
THE HELL'S ANGELS,
THE 100-CARAT HEADLINE,

264
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:32,511
RUNNING FAST AND LOUD
ON THE EARLY-MORNING FREEWAY

265
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:35,145
LIKE GENGHIS KHAN
ON AN IRON HORSE...

266
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:39,179
A MONSTROUS STEED
WITH A FIERY ANUS,

267
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,278
FLAT OUT THROUGH
THE EYE OF A BEER CAN
AND UP YOUR DAUGHTER'S LEG

268
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:45,611
WITH NO QUARTER ASKED
AND NONE GIVEN."

269
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:47,912
Brinkley:
IT WAS THE BEGINNING
OF HUNTER

270
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:49,611
DEVELOPING HIS STYLE.

271
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:52,745
IT IS NOT GONZO,
IT'S NOT SURREAL.

272
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:56,311
IT IS STRAIGHT JOURNALISM,
BUT IT'S PARTICIPATORY.

273
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:01,578
Depp:
"WEIRD AS IT SEEMS, AS THIS
GANG OF COSTUMED HOODLUMS

274
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,545
CONVERGED ON MONTEREY
THAT MORNING

275
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:06,012
THEY WERE ON THE VERGE
OF 'MAKING IT BIG,'

276
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:08,311
AS THE SHOWBIZ
PEOPLE SAY,

277
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:11,278
AND THEY WOULD OWE
MOST OF THEIR SUCCESS
TO A CURIOUS RAPE MANIA

278
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,645
THAT RIDES
ON THE SHOULDER
OF AMERICAN JOURNALISM

279
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:16,778
LIKE SOME JEERING,
MASTURBATING RAVEN.

280
00:15:16,778 --> 00:15:21,045
NOTHING GRABS AN EDITOR'S
EYE LIKE A GOOD RAPE.

281
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,244
TO THEM, THE APPEARANCE
OF THE HELL'S ANGELS

282
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:25,978
MUST HAVE SEEMED
LIKE A WONDERFUL
PUBLICITY STUNT."

283
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,112
HELL'S ANGELS ACCUSED
OF RAPE AND PERVERSION,

284
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:35,112
THEFT, NARCOTICS
AND VIOLENCE.

285
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,278
AND THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL SAYS,

286
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,211
"THEY WILL NO LONGER BE
ALLOWED TO THREATEN
THE LIVES,

287
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:45,678
THE PEACE AND SECURITY
OF HONEST CITIZENS.

288
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,045
HELL'S ANGELS ARE
THE BIGGEST

289
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:51,411
OF THE OUTLAW
MOTORCYCLE CLUBS."

290
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:54,378
OH, SHIT!
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

291
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,112
( engine revs )

292
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:57,845
Depp:
"IN A NATION
OF FRIGHTENED DULLARDS

293
00:15:57,845 --> 00:16:00,344
THERE'S ALWAYS A SORRY
SHORTAGE OF OUTLAWS,

294
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:04,378
AND THOSE FEW
WHO MAKE THE GRADE
ARE ALWAYS WELCOME.

295
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:07,344
THE HELL'S ANGELS POSE
FOR TELEVISION CAMERAMEN

296
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:10,145
AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS
ON RADIO CALL-IN SHOWS.

297
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:12,411
THEY WERE SOUGHT OUT
BY MYSTICS AND POETS,

298
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:14,578
CHEERED ON
BY STUDENT REBELS

299
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:18,244
AND INVITED TO PARTIES
GIVEN BY LIBERALS AND
INTELLECTUALS."

300
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,578
Number two,
who is the author

301
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:24,912
that sort of leads
the kind of LSD sect
out there

302
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:27,211
in Los--
San Francisco?

303
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,278
Ken Kesey.

304
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,511
Number two,
the Merry Pranksters
gave a party

305
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:33,678
for the Hell's Angels--
were you there?

306
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:36,978
- --that lasted two days?
- Yes.

307
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:40,045
WE'RE GOING
OUT ON AN OUTING--
ON A SUNDAY OUTING.

308
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:43,445
OH, THIS IS LOVELY.
YOU KNOW, OUR LITTLE FAMILY.

309
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:45,712
AND SO WE ENDED UP--
HUNTER SAID,

310
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:48,645
"OH, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING OVER--

311
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,912
LET'S GO JUST KIND
OF CHECK IT OUT."

312
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:54,545
THE BIG BANNERS
OUT THERE SAYING

313
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:57,478
"THE MERRY PRANKSTERS
WELCOME THE HELL'S ANGELS."

314
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:03,645
I THOUGHT I WAS
HAVING A LOT OF FUN.

315
00:17:03,645 --> 00:17:06,278
JUAN WAS IN THE CAR ASLEEP.
EVERYBODY WAS ON ACID.

316
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:09,344
I WASN'T.HUNTER WASN'T.
HE HADN'T TAKEN ACID YET.

317
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,645
AND EVERYBODY IS
PRETTY HAPPY AND DANCING

318
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:13,845
AND THEN WATCHING
THIS FIVE-HOUR FILM

319
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:16,311
OR SOMETHING
KESEY HAD PUT TOGETHER.

320
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:19,378
AND WHEN WE LEFT...

321
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:23,445
HUNTER SAID,
"DID YOU KNOW WHAT
WAS HAPPENING IN THERE?"

322
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:25,445
AND I SAID,
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

323
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:29,945
AND HE SAID,
"WELL, THERE WAS
A GANGBANG GOING ON."

324
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:32,344
Hunter:
I'm watching it as
I was about six feet away.

325
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,344
See from the door,
the lights were on,

326
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,012
there was a kind of a filmy
curtain over the door.

327
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:40,378
You could see shadows moving
around on the side.  If you
knew what was happening--

328
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:42,778
you could interpret
the movements of all
these shadowy figures

329
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:45,244
behind this curtain--
silhouettes is what
they were.

330
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,978
You could see
people getting down on her,
other people holding her legs,

331
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:49,745
and really...

332
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:51,712
surrealistically
horrifying.

333
00:17:53,545 --> 00:17:56,211
Brinkley:
THE TAPE RECORDER
FOR HUNTER WAS ESSENTIAL.

334
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:58,211
HE ALWAYS BROUGHT
A TAPE RECORDER--

335
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:02,211
LIKE THOSE FAMOUS-- NOW--
TAPES OF THE HELL'S
ANGELS PARTY.

336
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:04,179
( Hunter speaking )

337
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:22,179
Brinkley: THOSE TAPES BECAME
A BIG PART OF THE BOOK
"HELL'S ANGELS,"

338
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,812
BUT HE ALSO LOANED
THOSE TAPES TO TOM WOLFE.

339
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,845
WOLFE USED THOSE TAPES

340
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:32,211
AND EXTRACTED THINGS
FROM THEM FOR "THE ELECTRIC
KOOL-AID ACID TEST."

341
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,611
Wolfe:
I HAD A HARD TIME
WITH THE TAPE

342
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:36,645
ABOUT THE RAPE SCENE
AT THE HELL'S ANGELS PARTY.

343
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:39,778
IT WAS DYNAMITE,
FROM A REPORTING
POINT OF VIEW,

344
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:42,678
BUT THE THING WAS,
I KNEW WHO THE KEY FIGURES
IN THAT WERE.

345
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:46,045
ONE WAS THE EX-WIFE...

346
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:48,378
OF NEAL CASSADY.

347
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:52,445
AND SHE
QUITE WILLINGLY...

348
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,611
INVITED THE--

349
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,678
THE ENTIRE CORPS

350
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,712
OF HELL'S ANGELS
TO HAVE A GO AT HER.

351
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:03,311
Wright: IT WASN'T
THE KESEY PEOPLE WHO WERE
DOING THE GANGBANG.

352
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:07,745
THEY WERE ABOUT LOVE
AND HAPPINESS...

353
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:10,344
AND TOGETHERNESS
AND COMMUNITY...

354
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,912
AND LOVE AND LIGHT.
THEY WERE, THE ANGELS WEREN'T.

355
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,478
Depp:
"IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME

356
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:19,678
THAT MY LONG-STANDING
RAPPORT WITH THE ANGELS
BEGAN TO DETERIORATE.

357
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:22,745
FOR NEARLY A YEAR
I HAD LIVED IN A WORLD
THAT SEEMED, AT FIRST,

358
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,678
LIKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL.

359
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:26,511
IT WAS OBVIOUS
FROM THE BEGINNING

360
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:29,012
THAT THE MENACE
BORE LITTLE RESEMBLANCE
TO ITS PUBLICIZED IMAGE.

361
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:32,344
LATER, AS THEY ATTRACTED
MORE AND MORE ATTENTION,

362
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:35,079
THE MYSTIQUE
WAS STRETCHED SO THIN

363
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,478
THAT IT FINALLY
BECAME TRANSPARENT.

364
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,778
THE HONEYMOON
CAME TO A JANGLED END
ON OCTOBER 16th,

365
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:46,645
WHEN THE HELL'S ANGELS
ATTACKED A GET OUT OF
VIETNAM DEMONSTRATION

366
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,778
AT THE OAKLAND-BERKELEY
BORDER."

367
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:56,578
Man on TV:
The bike rider is
Clifford Workman,

368
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:58,244
treasurer
of the Hell's Angels.

369
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,145
He's here to challenge
his biographer,

370
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:03,179
a tense young
literary journalist
named Hunter Thompson.

371
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,978
What did you think
of the book?

372
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:07,145
Well, I'll tell you, Al

373
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:11,145
- and Hunter,
everybody in this room,
- ( audience laughs )

374
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:13,645
that that book
is 60% cheap trash.

375
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,712
This is what happened:
Junkie George was beating
his own lady.

376
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:19,578
- Al: Junkie George?
- ( audience laughs,
applause )

377
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:24,812
Clifford:
Junkie George's dog
bit him, right?

378
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:27,211
- Hunter: I didn't see--
- To me, this is a personal
affair.

379
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:29,244
If a guy wants to beat
his wife and his dog
bites him,

380
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,645
that's between
the three of them.

381
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:32,578
But there was somebody
about 30' to my left

382
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:34,478
beating his wife
to a pulp on the rocks.

383
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:36,478
If he had been beating her
that bad, somebody would
have stopped him.

384
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,378
Oh, no.Don't-- don't--
you're kidding me

385
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,511
and you're gonna
kid everybody else.
Nobody stopped him.

386
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:42,278
You know he beat his wife up.
You just said it, right?

387
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:44,244
You walked right up
to him and you said,

388
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,912
"Only a punk beats
his wife and dog."

389
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,945
- You finish it--
- And he said, "Hunter,
you want some of this?"

390
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:52,845
And you said, "No."
But you got it anyways.

391
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:56,112
And when he hit you,
three or four others
hit you too.

392
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:57,845
We let them beat him up
for a minute,

393
00:20:57,845 --> 00:21:00,211
then we broke it up
and told him to get
out of there.

394
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:02,878
He left
and got in his car.
Well, uh--

395
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:06,411
he says that he went
to the police station

396
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:09,645
all bloodied-up
and they threw him out,
which is malarkey.

397
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,978
I mean, but it's part
of his style of writing.

398
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:16,878
Depp:
"MY FACE LOOKED LIKE
IT HAD BEEN JAMMED

399
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:19,079
INTO THE SPOKES
OF A SPEEDING HARLEY,

400
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,344
AND THE ONLY THING
KEEPING ME AWAKE

401
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:24,211
WAS THE SPASTIC PAIN
OF A BROKEN RIB.

402
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:26,211
IT HAD BEEN
A BAD TRIP--

403
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:29,878
FAST AND WILD
IN SOME MOMENTS,
SLOW AND DIRTY IN OTHERS,

404
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:33,079
BUT ON BALANCE
IT LOOKED LIKE A BUMMER.

405
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,244
ON MY WAY BACK
TO SAN FRANCISCO,

406
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,311
I TRIED TO COMPOSE
A FITTING EPITAPH.

407
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:39,511
I WANTED
SOMETHING ORIGINAL,

408
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:42,745
BUT THERE WAS NO ESCAPING
THE ECHO OF MISTAH KURTZ'S
FINAL WORDS

409
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:44,445
FROM THE 'HEART
OF DARKNESS':

410
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:48,278
'THE HORROR!
THE HORROR!

411
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:51,045
EXTERMINATE
ALL THE BRUTES!'"

412
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,945
Brinkley:
ALTHOUGH "HELL'S ANGELS"
ROCKETED HIM

413
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:57,912
TO NAME RECOGNITION
AND SUCCESS,

414
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:00,945
HE DIDN'T SEE IT HIMSELF
AS BEING THE SUCCESSFUL BOOK
THAT HE WANTED.

415
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,611
IT DIDN'T SELL ENOUGH
FOR HIM,

416
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,712
EVEN THOUGH IT MADE
THE BEST-SELLER LIST.

417
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:07,478
HE DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH
MONEY OFF OF IT.HE FELT
RIPPED OFF BY THE PUBLISHER.

418
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:09,211
HE GOT FRUSTRATED
WITH THAT.

419
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:11,578
HE HAD THOUGHT THAT IT
WOULD BE THE HOME RUN,

420
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:14,845
BUT WHAT IT DID DO,
THAT BOOK MADE HIM REALIZE

421
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:18,211
THAT THERE WAS A MARKET
IN THE FREAK CIRCUS
OF THE '60s.

422
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,778
( "It's No Secret"
playing )

423
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:25,745
Brinkley:
AND IT BECAME THIS THING
GOING ON OUT IN THE BAY AREA

424
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,378
AND HUNTER WAS
DEEPLY PART OF IT.

425
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:35,278
HE USED TO DRIVE
HIS BSA LIGHTNING MOTORBIKE

426
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:38,978
AND GO TO
THE MATRIX AND BEFRIENDED
JEFFERSON AIRPLANE.

427
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:41,311
HE HAD A HUGE CRUSH
ON GRACE SLICK.

428
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,912
* OH!

429
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:44,845
* IS IT ANY WONDER
WHY I FEEL LIKE *

430
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:47,912
* MY WHOLE
LIFE IS THROUGH? *

431
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:49,945
* YEAH!

432
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:54,045
* WHEN I STOP FEELING
HOW STRONG MY LOVE
IS FOR YOU... *

433
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:56,378
Jann Wenner:
THE SAN FRANCISCO
BAY AREA WAS A HOTBED

434
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:58,045
OF LIVE
ROCK 'N' ROLL STUFF,

435
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,344
DRUG CULTURE,
PSYCHEDELICS, KESEY,

436
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:03,745
POLITICS,
CAMPUS ACTIVISM.

437
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:05,611
IT WAS MORE ON THE EDGE
CULTURALLY

438
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:08,311
THAN ANY OTHER
PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.
THERE'S MORE FREEDOM THERE.

439
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:11,411
"ROLLING STONE"
BEGAN AND MERGED
ALL THOSE ELEMENTS.

440
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:13,812
AND WE JUST THOUGHT
THERE WAS A TIME FOR
A NEW KIND OF POLITICS

441
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:16,778
AND IT WOULD EMERGE
OUT OF THE ROCK 'N' ROLL
CONSCIOUSNESS

442
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:19,344
AND THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL
ETHOS AND THAT IDEA.

443
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:25,745
* TODAY I FEEL LIKE
PLEASING YOU *

444
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,745
* MORE THAN BEFORE...

445
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:30,445
Wright:
THE ENERGY WAS
JUST PHENOMENAL.

446
00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:33,278
IT WAS LIKE
LOSING YOUR IDENTITY

447
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,878
AND BEING
JUST KIND OF SUCKED...

448
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:39,411
INTO WHATEVER,
YOU KNOW?

449
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:41,411
WHATEVER--
WHATEVER THIS WAS,

450
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:44,344
IT WAS SOME KIND OF
MAGICAL SOMETHING OR OTHER.

451
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:46,878
* ...ALL I WANT TO DO

452
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:52,244
* TO BE LOVING YOU

453
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:58,278
* IT'LL ALL BE THERE WHEN
MY DREAMS COME TRUE... *

454
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:03,812
Tim Crouse:
HUNTER WAS A ROMANTIC.
HUNTER'S UTOPIA,

455
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:07,244
WHICH HE HAD EXPERIENCED
BEFORE I MET HIM,

456
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:11,378
WAS SAN FRANCISCO
IN THE EARLY '60s.

457
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:15,745
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS
TWO GREAT MORAL PRESSURES--

458
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,344
THE WAR
AND CIVIL RIGHTS.

459
00:24:18,344 --> 00:24:23,045
- ( clamoring )
- * TODAY YOU'LL
MAKE ME SAY... *

460
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,311
Buchanan:
THERE'S BITTERNESS AND
NASTINESS TO POLITICS TODAY,

461
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:29,812
BUT I DON'T SENSE
THE SAME ANGER AND RAGE

462
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:32,079
THAT WE HAD
IN THE 1960s--

463
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,712
ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS,
RIOTS,

464
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:38,611
DISORDERS OF RACIAL CONFLICT,
THE GENERATIONAL CONFLICT.

465
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,645
AND HUNTER WAS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT.

466
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,244
* ...ANY MORE
THAN ALL I AM *

467
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:47,445
* WOULD BE A LIE...

468
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:52,378
Brinkley:
THE LAST PERIOD
WHERE THERE WAS AN OPTIMISM

469
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:54,478
IN HUNTER ABOUT AMERICA
WERE THE KENNEDYS,

470
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:57,478
WITH JOHN KENNEDY
AND BOBBY KENNEDY.

471
00:24:57,478 --> 00:25:00,079
HUNTER LIKED THAT THEY
HAD SUCH HUBRIS.

472
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,678
THEY COULD BE GOOD POLITICIANS
BUT PLAY HARD AT MIDNIGHT.

473
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:06,344
THAT MEANT A LOT.
THOSE WERE HIS GUYS.

474
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:08,012
I WANT
THE POLITICS OF HOPE,

475
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:10,545
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
WE CAN DO BETTER
IN THIS COUNTRY.

476
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:12,211
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT WE CAN SAY

477
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,411
THAT WE ARE JOYOUS
OR THAT WE ARE HAPPY

478
00:25:14,411 --> 00:25:17,578
IF 590 AMERICANS ARE KILLED
IN VIETNAM LAST WEEK

479
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:19,778
AND IF WE HAVE RIOTING
IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL.

480
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:21,311
I THINK THAT
WE CAN DO BETTER.

481
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,878
* ...ALL FOR YOU.

482
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:25,278
( gunshot )

483
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:27,712
( people screaming )

484
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:32,211
Depp:
"THE DAY AFTER
ROBERT KENNEDY DIED

485
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:35,611
I RECEIVED A NOTICE
FROM THE LOCAL RAILWAY
EXPRESS OFFICE

486
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:38,745
SAYING MY WALTHER P-38
AUTOMATIC PISTOL
HAD ARRIVED.

487
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:43,012
WE SHOT IT ONE AFTERNOON,
AGREEING THAT IT HAD A VERY
SMOOTH ACTION...

488
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:45,511
AND THEN I SENT IT BACK.

489
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,878
RETURNING THE P-38
SOLVED NOTHING.

490
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:49,878
IT ONLY POSTPONED
THE NECESSITY

491
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,045
OF COMING TO GRIPS
WITH MY GUN PROBLEM."

492
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:55,645
- ( gunshots )
- * HEY, JOE...

493
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:58,344
* WHERE YOU GOIN'
WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND? *

494
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:04,445
Brinkley: HUNTER SAW GUNS
AS ONE OF THE GREAT
THINGS IN LIFE.

495
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:07,045
HE LOVED SHOOTING THEM
AND FIRING THEM WHENEVER
HE COULD.

496
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,912
* WHERE YOU GOIN'
WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND? *

497
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:11,578
WHEN HE'S AT BIG SUR,
HE WOULD GO

498
00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:14,712
WILD-BOAR,
WILD-PIG HUNTING
WITH A SUBMACHINE GUN.

499
00:26:14,712 --> 00:26:16,645
( gunshots )

500
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:20,912
Juan Thompson:
I HAD A BB GUN WHEN I WAS
LIKE SEVEN, PROBABLY.

501
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,912
THOSE ARE SOME
OF MY BEST MEMORIES
FROM THAT TIME,

502
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,912
BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING
WE BOTH ENJOYED DOING,

503
00:26:24,912 --> 00:26:27,045
BUT IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE
IT WAS TIME

504
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,712
WE WERE BUILDING
OUR RELATIONSHIP

505
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,012
AS A FATHER AND SON,
AND NOT JUST AS KIND
OF ROOMMATES.

506
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:34,945
Wenner:
THE GUNS-- THEY WEREN'T
JUST FOR AMUSEMENT.

507
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:37,079
HE LIKED THE NOISE,
THE VIOLENCE AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF IT.

508
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:39,244
AND HE HAD THAT
IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE TOO.

509
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:41,311
WE HAD
A REAL VIOLENT STREAK.

510
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,678
Wright:
THE FIRST TIME
HE TOOK ACID, HUNTER SAYS,

511
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:46,578
"SONDI, GET ME THE GUN."
I SAID, "I CAN'T
GET YOU THE GUN.

512
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:50,712
I'M TERRIFIED
SOMETHING IS GONNA
HAPPEN TO JUAN."

513
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:53,645
AND-- AND HUNTER SAYS,

514
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,678
"YOU GET ME THAT GUN

515
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:58,945
OR I'M THROWING THIS BOOT
THROUGH THE WINDOW."

516
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:01,578
HE THROWS THE BOOT
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
( mimics glass shattering )

517
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:07,045
Depp: "HAD MY BRAIN
TURNED INTO JELLY FROM
TOO MUCH ACID?

518
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:09,645
WHAT WAS I DOING
WITH ALL THESE GUNS?

519
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:11,311
MY ANGST BEGAN
TO FESTER

520
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:14,578
AS THE GUN-CONTROL ARGUMENT
RAGED CLOSER TO HOME.

521
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:16,678
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
BEGAN TELLING EACH OTHER

522
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:21,145
THAT THE GUN
WAS THE ULTIMATE CURE
FOR WHAT AILS US...

523
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:23,145
THE AMERICAN WAY."

524
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:26,878
Brinkley:
BY 1968, HUNTER
TAKES ON THIS IDEA

525
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,712
THAT HE'S GONNA
BE ABLE TO WRITE ON THE DEATH
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.

526
00:27:29,712 --> 00:27:32,411
AND HUNTER THOUGHT
THAT COVERING POLITICS--

527
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:34,578
'68 WAS GONNA
BE THE BOOK.

528
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:38,079
( rock music playing )

529
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:42,478
Depp:
"I WENT TO CHICAGO
AS A JOURNALIST.

530
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,311
MY CANDIDATE HAD BEEN
MURDERED IN LOS ANGELES

531
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:46,912
TWO MONTHS EARLIER."

532
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:56,278
* COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON *

533
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:57,945
* COME ON

534
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:01,511
* DIDN'T I MAKE
YOU FEEL... *

535
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:04,511
Crouse:
HUNTER WAS IN CHICAGO RIGHT
IN THE MIDST OF THE GAS

536
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:06,478
AND THE BEATINGS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

537
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,611
AND I THINK THAT
THAT WAS A MILESTONE EVENT

538
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:12,244
FOR HUNTER
THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER.

539
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:15,478
AND HE NEVER
FORGAVE HUMPHREY
WHO WAS THE CANDIDATE,

540
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:18,678
AND HE NEVER
FORGAVE MUSKIE WHO WAS THE
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

541
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:22,478
FOR SUPPORTING MAYOR DALEY
AND HIS CHICAGO POLICE.

542
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:28,445
* TAKE IT,
TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE
OF MY HEART NOW, BABY... *

543
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:31,244
Depp:
"I WITNESSED AT LEAST
10 BEATINGS IN CHICAGO

544
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:34,878
THAT WERE WORSE
THAN ANYTHING I EVER
SAW THE HELL'S ANGELS DO.

545
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:37,378
I LEFT IN A STATE
OF HYSTERICAL ANGST,

546
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:39,478
CONVINCED
BY WHAT I HAD SEEN

547
00:28:39,478 --> 00:28:42,079
THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS
CLUBBING ITSELF TO DEATH."

548
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,778
* IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL GOOD... *

549
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:48,445
Wright: THERE WERE ONLY TEARS
TWICE THAT I REMEMBER EVER
IN OUR 19 YEARS TOGETHER.

550
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:51,878
I REMEMBER ONE,
WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM
THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.

551
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:53,878
AND HE WAS TELLING ME
THE STORIES

552
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:55,912
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
BEING BEATEN

553
00:28:55,912 --> 00:28:58,211
AND HE-- YOU KNOW,
THE TEARS JUST--

554
00:28:58,211 --> 00:29:02,578
AND THAT WAS
VERY-- YOU KNOW.

555
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:06,112
IT WAS--
HUNTER WAS A MAN
THAT DIDN'T CRY.

556
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:09,278
* AND BABY, DEEP DOWN
IN YOUR HEART... *

557
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,211
Wright:
AND HE CARED SO MUCH.
HUNTER WAS A PATRIOT.

558
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,611
HE KNEW THE CONSTITUTION,
HE CARED ABOUT IT,

559
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:19,244
AND THEN THERE HE WAS
IN CHICAGO AND IT'S ALL
BEING DESTROYED.

560
00:29:19,244 --> 00:29:21,145
( Janis Joplin shrieks )

561
00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:23,778
* TAKE IT, TAKE
ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE... *

562
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,378
Wright:
I THINK CHICAGO
INSPIRED HIM TO DO--

563
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:28,812
TO DO MORE,
TO GET MORE INVOLVED.

564
00:29:28,812 --> 00:29:30,945
* TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE
PIECE OF MY HEART *

565
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:34,211
- * NOW, DARLING,
YEAH YEAH YEAH *
- * OH, HAVE A...

566
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:37,578
Wenner:
RIGHT AWAY, RIOTS STARTED--
CHICAGO, '68 TOOK PLACE.

567
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:40,445
THEN THAT WAS
KIND OF A RADICALIZING,
GALVANIZING EVENT.

568
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,411
WE WERE ALREADY ESCHEWING
MAINSTREAM NOSTALGIA
IN POLITICS

569
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,712
SAYING, "LOOK,
THE SYSTEM IS TOO RIGGED.
POLITICS IS...

570
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:48,378
FINE, BUT IN
SOME OTHER VENUE."

571
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:50,411
I GOT A LETTER FROM HUNTER
OUT OF THE BLUE,

572
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:53,145
COMPLIMENTING ME
ON "ROLLING STONE,"
HOW MUCH HE LIKED IT.

573
00:29:53,145 --> 00:29:55,411
SO I WROTE HIM BACK
AND SAID, "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING THESE DAYS?

574
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:57,145
I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
IN THE MAGAZINE."

575
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:58,945
THEN HE MENTIONED
HE WAS RUNNING FOR SHERIFF.

576
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:01,912
SO I SAID,
"HOW ABOUT THAT?
SOUNDS GREAT."

577
00:30:01,912 --> 00:30:04,179
IT'S THE KIND OF THING
WE WOULD RUN TODAY,

578
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:07,845
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY
RUNNING FOR SHERIFF IN ASPEN,
TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE TOWN.

579
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:10,511
James Salter:
Hunter Thompson is a moralist

580
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:12,545
posing as an immoralist.

581
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:16,079
Nixon is an immoralist
disguised as a moralist.

582
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,145
This is James Salter.

583
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:21,678
There'll be thieves
and auto wrecks in Aspen
whoever gets elected,

584
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,912
but Hunter represents
something wholly alien

585
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:26,311
to the other candidates
for sheriff--

586
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:28,678
ideas,
and the sympathy

587
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:32,079
towards the young, generous,
grass-oriented society,

588
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,411
which is making
the only serious effort

589
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:37,778
to face the technological
nightmare we have created.

590
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:39,778
The only thing
against him is

591
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:42,244
he is a visionary
who wants to cure
the world.

592
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:45,511
George Stranahan:
FIRST OF ALL, HE DROVE
EVERYBODY BATSHIT NUTS.

593
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,478
HUNTER WAS MY FRIEND
AND NEIGHBOR,

594
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:52,045
THE MAN WHO
NEVER PAID HIS RENT,
BROKE UP MY MARRIAGE

595
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:53,778
AND TAUGHT MY CHILDREN
TO SMOKE DOPE.

596
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:56,912
NOW HUNTER
WAS OUTRAGEOUS,

597
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:59,244
BUT THERE WAS
SUCH A SORT OF MOVEMENT

598
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:02,012
THAT THIS GUY
MAY BE CRAZY,

599
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:04,311
BUT BETTER THAT
THAN WHITMIRE.

600
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:06,244
( bell tolling )

601
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,145
Announcer:
The American sheriff's job was
carved out of the rugged West.

602
00:31:13,145 --> 00:31:14,945
It was a desperately-
needed position

603
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:19,179
of few words, much action,
and little praise or glory.

604
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,945
Today the sheriff has
reams of responsibility.

605
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:25,478
But still-- as in the past--
the number-one responsibility

606
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:28,645
is to protect his people
and enforce their laws.

607
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,645
Vote for and elect

608
00:31:30,645 --> 00:31:33,445
Carrol Whitmire
for our sheriff.

609
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:35,912
I THINK A LOT OF PLACES
ARE BEYOND THIS KIND
OF POLITICS.

610
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:40,045
WE SEEMED TO BE RUNNING
AN EXPERIMENT THAT PEOPLE
WERE WATCHING.

611
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:46,678
Stranahan:
HUNTER CAME TO ASPEN,
HE HAD MOVED INTO OUR FARM.

612
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:48,545
HUNTER LIKED
TO TALK POLITICS.

613
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:53,079
I WAS JUST AT THAT AGE
OF WAR PROTEST-- 1968.

614
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,112
I WAS BECOMING
POLITICAL...

615
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:58,778
AND SO HUNTER AND I
HAD A LOT IN COMMON
TO TALK ABOUT.

616
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:04,945
Bob Braudis:
ASPEN THEN WAS A MAGNET
FOR INTELLECTUALS

617
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:07,378
WHO WANTED TO DROP OUT.

618
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:09,511
AND HUNTER CONVINCED US

619
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,411
THAT WE DIDN'T
HAVE MUCH EFFECT
ON WHAT HAPPENED

620
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:13,511
IN WASHINGTON
DAY TO DAY

621
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:17,244
AND WHAT HAPPENED
IN WASHINGTON FROM DAY TO DAY
DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON US.

622
00:32:17,244 --> 00:32:20,878
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN PITKIN COUNTY
HAD A VISCERAL,

623
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:25,445
DAILY, HOURLY
EFFECT ON THE WAY
WE LIVED HERE.

624
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:29,344
PEOPLE DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT ASPEN
WAS A BATTLEGROUND.

625
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:32,112
ASPEN WAS MORE
OF A DISNEYLAND.

626
00:32:32,112 --> 00:32:36,012
HUNTER WAS A VISIONARY.
HE UNDERSTOOD MORE
ABOUT LAND USE

627
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:38,045
AND DEVELOPMENT
THAN ANY OF US DID.

628
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:42,778
NOBODY AT THE TIME
WAS STANDING UP TO
THE BULLDOZERS.

629
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:44,778
"TENTATIVE PLATFORM,
THOMPSON FOR SHERIFF,

630
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:48,112
ASPEN, COLORADO, 1970:

631
00:32:48,112 --> 00:32:52,645
1-- RIP UP ALL CITY STREETS
WITH JACKHAMMERS

632
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:55,378
AND SOD THE STREETS
AT ONCE.

633
00:32:55,378 --> 00:33:00,179
2-- CHANGE THE NAME 'ASPEN'
TO 'FAT CITY.'

634
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,945
THIS WOULD PREVENT
GREEDHEADS, LAND-RAPERS

635
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:05,912
AND OTHER HUMAN JACKALS
FROM CAPITALIZING ON
THE NAME 'ASPEN.'

636
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:09,845
THESE SWINES SHOULD BE
FUCKED, BROKEN,

637
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:11,878
AND DRIVEN
ACROSS THE LAND.

638
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:15,611
3-- IT WILL BE
THE GENERAL PHILOSOPHY

639
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:19,012
OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE
THAT NO DRUG WORTH TAKING

640
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:21,278
SHOULD BE SOLD
FOR MONEY.

641
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:23,378
MY FIRST ACT AS SHERIFF

642
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:27,344
WILL BE TO INSTALL
ON THE COURTHOUSE LAWN
A SET OF STOCKS

643
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:29,912
IN ORDER TO PUNISH
DISHONEST DOPE DEALERS

644
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:32,045
IN A PROPER
PUBLIC FASHION."

645
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:34,845
( "Walk on the Wild Side"
playing )

646
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,478
Juan:
I WAS ONLY ABOUT SIX
AT THE TIME,

647
00:33:38,478 --> 00:33:40,511
BUT LEGEND HAS IT
THAT MY FATHER SHAVED
HIS HEAD

648
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:44,411
SO HE COULD SAY,
"UNLIKE MY LONG-HAIRED
OPPONENT, SHERIFF WHITMIRE."

649
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:46,411
I JUST WISH I COULD
HAVE BEEN OLD ENOUGH

650
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:48,611
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE'S REACTION

651
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,079
ABOUT THIS CRAZY,
BALD, FREAK DRUG-FIEND

652
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:54,278
WHO WAS ABOUT
TO TAKE OVER THE WHOLE
POLITICAL MECHANISM.

653
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:59,145
* HOLLY CAME
FROM MIAMI, F.L.A... *

654
00:33:59,145 --> 00:34:02,311
HUNTER THOMPSON
IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE
WHO HAS THE IMAGINATION

655
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:06,278
AND INTELLIGENCE TO BE
A LAW-ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVE.

656
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,079
ELECT HUNTER THOMPSON
SHERIFF.

657
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,079
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
LISTENING!

658
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,678
WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY
LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE?!

659
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,678
( screams )
THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!

660
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:18,045
* HEY, HONEY, TAKE
A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE... *

661
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:20,445
( woman laughs,
applauds )

662
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:23,378
Braudis: AT THE START,
I THINK IT WAS MORE TO GET
A MESSAGE OUT

663
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,945
KNOWING THAT DEFEAT
WAS CERTAIN.

664
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:29,778
THE SERIOUS COMPONENT
OF HUNTER'S CAMPAIGN
SNOWBALLED

665
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:33,145
AND, AS THE MOVEMENT
GAINED MOMENTUM,

666
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:36,578
I THINK HUNTER
ACTUALLY BELIEVED
THAT HE HAD A CHANCE.

667
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:40,445
AND A LOT OF US THAT
WERE SUPPORTING HUNTER
SHARED THAT BELIEF.

668
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,578
WE'RE TRYING
TO GET TOGETHER A LIST
OF ENDORSEMENTS

669
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:46,511
FOR HUNTER THOMPSON
FOR SHERIFF.

670
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:48,179
Braudis:
WE WERE ALL FREAKS--

671
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,411
THE PEOPLE
WHO CAME TOGETHER
IN SUPPORT OF HUNTER--

672
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:55,311
BUT I THINK OUR BIGGEST
ISSUE AT THE TIME WAS
THE ENVIRONMENT,

673
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,311
AND A SECONDARY ISSUE

674
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,978
WAS THE ILLEGAL STATUS
OF DRUGS.

675
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:02,179
WHAT IS THAT
YOU'RE SMOKING?

676
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:04,745
THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE
TO BE MARIJUANA.

677
00:35:04,745 --> 00:35:06,645
( all laugh )

678
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,411
- YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T TELL?
- ( laughs )

679
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:11,211
AN AWFUL LOT OF US
WERE SMOKING DOPE

680
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:13,645
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SAID,
"THOU SHALT NOT."

681
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,311
WE SAID, "WE SHALL."

682
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:18,645
MARIJUANA LAWS ARE
ONE OF THE REASONS

683
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:21,778
THAT HAS ENGENDERED
THIS LACK OF RESPECT

684
00:35:21,778 --> 00:35:25,244
THAT COPS COMPLAIN ABOUT
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

685
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:27,978
WHEN YOU GET A WHOLE
GENERATION THAT GROWS UP

686
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:31,311
AS FELONS, THEY KNOW
THE LAW IS RIDICULOUS

687
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:33,344
AND THEY'RE TOLD US
ALL THIS GIBBERISH ABOUT IT--

688
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:36,211
"IT DRIVES YOU CRAZY
AND MAKES YOUR BRAIN SOFT,
AND YOUR FEET FALL OFF."

689
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:38,712
( all laughing )

690
00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:40,712
EVEN THE POLICE KNOW
IT'S A SILLY LAW.

691
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:43,712
IT'S TIME THAT
WE EITHER BRIDGE
THAT CHASM

692
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:46,145
WITH SOME KIND OF REALISTIC
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ELSE--

693
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,112
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA
BE BRIDGED IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO REVOLUTION.

694
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:51,079
Wright:
I THINK THAT WAS
ONE OF HUNTER'S

695
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,179
GREATEST TIMES,
MYSELF.

696
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:55,978
HE HAD THE PASSION
TO MOVE PEOPLE,

697
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:58,812
CHANGE PEOPLE'S THINKING,

698
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:02,012
MAKE THEM ACT

699
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:05,511
AND BRING THEM OUT--
NOT JUST DEFY AUTHORITY

700
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:08,344
AND TAKE AS MANY DRUGS
AS YOU WANT,

701
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:11,611
BUT TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE
TRYING TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM,

702
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:13,912
MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK

703
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:16,179
AND MAKE
THE SYSTEM GOOD.

704
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,112
HE HAD THAT IN HIM.

705
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,611
Whitmire:
IF HE WAS ELECTED SHERIFF,
I CAN FORESEE

706
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:27,179
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE
AN INFLUX OF WHAT WE
CALL THE HIPPIES.

707
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:30,378
AND I THINK
IF THIS HAPPENED,

708
00:36:30,378 --> 00:36:32,445
IT WOULD ACTUALLY
DESTROY ASPEN.

709
00:36:39,845 --> 00:36:42,778
Man:
WHEN YOU PUBLICLY COME OUT
WITH STATEMENTS

710
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:44,411
OF MESCALINE,
MARIJUANA--

711
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,945
MY GOOD GOD!

712
00:36:46,945 --> 00:36:49,012
THIS ISN'T THE WAY
OF AMERICAN LIFE.

713
00:36:49,012 --> 00:36:52,745
* YOU WALK
INTO THE ROOM *

714
00:36:52,745 --> 00:36:55,045
* WITH YOUR PENCIL
IN YOUR HAND *

715
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:57,778
* YOU SEE
SOMEBODY NAKED *

716
00:36:57,778 --> 00:37:00,678
* AND YOU SAY,
"WHO IS THAT, MAN?" *

717
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:05,445
THEY ARE RAPING
OUR FORESTS.SOME OF THEM
ARE LIVING LIKE ANIMALS.

718
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:08,012
* BECAUSE SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING HERE *

719
00:37:08,012 --> 00:37:12,112
* BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS *

720
00:37:12,112 --> 00:37:17,244
* DO YOU,
MR. JONES? *

721
00:37:17,244 --> 00:37:19,611
HUNTER THOMPSON...

722
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:23,511
HAS NO GRIP ON REALITY.
I THINK HE'S PSYCHOTIC.

723
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:26,578
I THINK IF THERE WAS EVER
GONNA BE ANY EXCESSES

724
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,578
WITHIN THE SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT,

725
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:31,912
I'D LOOK FOR MORE
OUT OF HUNTER THOMPSON
THAN CARROL WHITMIRE.

726
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:33,945
* AND YOU GO WATCH
THE GEEK... *

727
00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:37,012
Braudis:
HE WAS A REDNECK
AND VERY POPULAR

728
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:40,578
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO
CONTROLLED THIS VALLEY THEN.

729
00:37:40,578 --> 00:37:42,611
THEY DIDN'T WANT
A SMART SHERIFF.

730
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:44,745
THEY WANTED PEOPLE
WHO WOULD DO THEIR BIDDING.

731
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:46,445
* BE SUCH A FREAK...

732
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:49,578
I'M NOT AT ALL
EMBARRASSED AT THE USE
OF THE WORD "FREAK."

733
00:37:49,578 --> 00:37:52,112
I THINK THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING,
IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY

734
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:54,511
IT'S A VERY
HONORABLE DESIGNATION.
I'M PROUD OF IT.

735
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,945
* AND SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING HERE... *

736
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,211
Hunter:
WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE,
AN ISOLATED TOWN,

737
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,112
WITH A VERY UNUSUAL
KIND OF POPULATION.

738
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,112
WE DO HAVE
A FREAK POWER BASE.
IT'S UNDENIABLE.

739
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:06,712
WE HAVE
ABOUT 1,000 VOTES
THAT WOULDN'T--

740
00:38:06,712 --> 00:38:10,778
IF I WENT OUT THERE AND WALKED
THROUGH THE STREETS NAKED
WITH A BOMB IN EACH HAND,

741
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:13,278
( laughs )
THEY WOULD STILL VOTE FOR ME.

742
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:20,244
Braudis:
ONE OF HUNTER'S
"FREAK POWER" TOOLS

743
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:23,344
WAS TO REGISTER PEOPLE
WHO HAD NEVER VOTED BEFORE.

744
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,678
- OKAY, WHERE'S
THIS VOTING PLACE?
- ( laughs )

745
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,678
- HUNTER, 182;
WHITMIRE, 137.
- ( phone rings )

746
00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:30,511
- RICKS, 10.
- YEAH!RIGHT!

747
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:33,211
( all cheering )

748
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,545
Woman:
ONE COULD DO IT,
ONE COULD DO IT.

749
00:38:36,545 --> 00:38:38,878
THE SUBURBS--
THE SILENT MAJORITY.

750
00:38:38,878 --> 00:38:43,112
- OKAY, HERE'S THE TOTALS.
- Man: HE'S NOT AVAILABLE
RIGHT AT THIS SECOND.

751
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:49,344
WHITMIRE, 204;

752
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,012
- HUNTER, 173.
- ( murmuring )

753
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:54,645
OKAY, UH...

754
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:57,278
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT PROVED WHAT
I SET OUT TO PROVE--

755
00:38:57,278 --> 00:39:00,378
AND IT WAS MORE
A POLITICAL POINT
THAN A LOCAL ELECTION--

756
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:04,145
- THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM
REALLY IS --.
- ( bleeps )

757
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:07,112
VERY HARD TO HAVE
A BALDHEADED LUNATIC--

758
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:09,344
I'LL DO THAT
FOR THE CAMERAS.
HEY, YOU FELLOWS.

759
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:11,678
Man:
ALL RIGHT!

760
00:39:11,678 --> 00:39:15,645
AND WE MADE A MISTAKE
IN THINKING...

761
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,778
THAT THE TOWN WAS
READY FOR AN HONEST
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.

762
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:21,378
Depp:
"WE FRIGHTEN
THE BASTARDS SO BADLY

763
00:39:21,378 --> 00:39:24,344
THAT ON ELECTION DAY
THEY ROLLED PEOPLE
IN WHEELCHAIRS--

764
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:28,611
EVEN ON STRETCHERS--
INTO THE POLLING PLACES
TO VOTE AGAINST US.

765
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:31,912
AND WHEN I LOST,
THEY INSTANTLY GOT
DOWN TO MAKING SURE

766
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:36,378
THAT NOBODY
LIKE ME COULD EVER
RUN FOR OFFICE AGAIN."

767
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:39,012
WE RAN THAT STORY,

768
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:42,311
HAD THE INFAMOUS POSTER
OF A TWO-THUMBED HAND

769
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:43,978
HOLDING A PEYOTE BUTTON.

770
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:48,878
HE CAME IN
AND TALKED TO AN EDITOR
NAMED JOHN LOMBARDI.

771
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:51,211
AFTERWARDS, LOMBARDI,
WHO WAS FROM PHILADELPHIA

772
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:54,311
AND WAS NOT QUITE USED
TO THE WEST COAST CRAZY--

773
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,812
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW,
THAT HUNTER THOMPSON
IS WEIRD.

774
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,545
HE'S REALLY WEIRD.

775
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:00,878
HE CAME IN WITH A BOX
FULL OF WIGS AND HATS.

776
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:02,878
HE WAS TAKING THEM OFF
AND PUTTING THEM ON

777
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:05,445
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE CONVERSATION."

778
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,545
( "Sympathy for the Devil"
playing )

779
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:19,912
* PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF *

780
00:40:19,912 --> 00:40:24,244
* I'M A MAN OF WEALTH
AND TASTE... *

781
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:26,478
Wenner:
RALPH IS CRAZIER
THAN HUNTER EVER WAS.

782
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:28,545
WHEREAS HUNTER COULD ALWAYS
PULL BACK FROM THE EDGE,

783
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:31,845
RALPH WAS
A TRUE BELIEVER.
AND IF IT WAS TIME

784
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:34,012
TO TAKE
THE FUCKING THING DOWN,
RALPH WAS PREPARED

785
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,878
TO GO IN LIKE GUY FAWKES
AND BLOW UP PARLIAMENT.

786
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:39,678
AND SO WE HAD
THIS PURITY OF VISION,

787
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:41,611
AND HUNTER SAW THAT.

788
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:43,678
I KNOW YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE.
I WONDER WHERE.

789
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:45,445
* PLEASED
TO MEET YOU... *

790
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,611
HAVE I SEEN YOU
SOMEWHERE BEFORE?

791
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,179
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
ARE YOU LISTENING?

792
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:52,244
PLEASE!

793
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:55,278
Stewardess: On behalf
of Rocky Mountain Airways
and your flight crew,

794
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:57,411
we'd like to thank you
for flying with us today.

795
00:40:57,411 --> 00:40:59,411
Have a pleasant stay
in Aspen

796
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:01,978
or wherever your final
destination might be.

797
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:04,912
Steadman:
I THINK WHAT
HE SAW IN THIS CONNECTION

798
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:08,145
WAS SOMEBODY THAT SOMEHOW
SAW THE THING IN PICTURES

799
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:11,211
AS HE SAW IT IN WORDS.
AND THAT SEEMED TO ME

800
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:14,145
TO BE PART
OF THE WHOLE CHEMISTRY,
OF OUR CHEMISTRY,

801
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:15,945
THAT MADE GONZO
POSSIBLE.

802
00:41:15,945 --> 00:41:18,978
HERE I GO.

803
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,045
Perry:
I'VE SEEN THE ILLUSTRATIONS
STEADMAN WAS DOING

804
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:24,045
BEFORE HE WORKED
WITH HUNTER.

805
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:28,045
HE WAS MUCH MORE
CONVENTIONAL BEFORE HUNTER
GOT AHOLD OF HIM.

806
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:30,845
HUNTER TOLD ME
HE LIKED STEADMAN'S STUFF,

807
00:41:30,845 --> 00:41:34,611
SO HE ASKED HIM
TO HELP HIM COVER
THE KENTUCKY DERBY

808
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:37,278
FOR A MAGAZINE
CALLED "SCANLAN'S."

809
00:41:37,278 --> 00:41:39,812
AND RALPH TOLD ME
AS SOON AS HE GOT OFF
THE AIRPLANE,

810
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:42,545
HUNTER GAVE HIM
SOME PSILOCYBIN
AND HIS LIFE CHANGED.

811
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:45,278
- COME ON, BUDDY.
- COME ON, HEY!
HUNTER!

812
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:50,978
* WHEN AFTER ALL
IT WAS YOU AND ME... *

813
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:53,378
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

814
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,112
Wright: RALPH--
WHEN HE FIRST MET HUNTER,

815
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,712
HE'D NEVER DONE
ANY DRUGS.

816
00:41:56,712 --> 00:42:00,112
HE DRANK, BUT HE'D NEVER
DONE ANYTHING HALLUCINOGENIC.

817
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:03,278
AND SO HERE COMES HUNTER,
HE GIVES HIM MESCALINE

818
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:06,511
AND HE LOSES IT.

819
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:08,445
YOU KNOW,
RALPH LOSES IT.

820
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:13,411
Steadman:
I WAS A CHOIRBOY--

821
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:16,079
YOU KNOW, DECENT,
INNOCENT ABROAD.

822
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,712
YOU KNOW HOW THINGS ARE.

823
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:20,945
AND SO I GUESS
IT WAS ATTRACTIVE,

824
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:23,278
THAT KIND OF RACINESS.

825
00:42:25,278 --> 00:42:27,278
* OH, YEAH

826
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,745
* GET DOWN, BABY...

827
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:33,778
Steadman:
I THINK THE BIRTH
OF GONZO HAPPENED

828
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:36,611
WHEN THE EVIL CAME OUT
OF ME IN THE DRAWINGS.

829
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:39,745
Depp:
"UNLIKE MOST OF THE OTHERS
IN THE PRESS BOX,

830
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:42,878
WE DIDN'T GIVE
A HOOT IN HELL WHAT WAS
HAPPENING ON THE TRACK.

831
00:42:42,878 --> 00:42:45,511
WE HAD COME TO WATCH
THE REAL BEASTS PERFORM.

832
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:47,978
WHEN THE CROWD STOOD
TO FACE THE FLAG

833
00:42:47,978 --> 00:42:49,845
AND SING
'MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME,'

834
00:42:49,845 --> 00:42:52,511
STEADMAN FACED THE CROWD
AND SKETCHED FRANTICALLY.

835
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:55,478
THOUSANDS OF RAVING,
STUMBLING DRUNKS

836
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:58,712
GETTING ANGRIER
AND ANGRIER AS THEY LOSE
MORE AND MORE MONEY."

837
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:02,511
Wolfe:
IN THAT STORY, YOU GET
ALL OF THE ATTITUDES

838
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:05,845
TO THE DERBY,
AND YOU NEVER
GET TO THE DERBY.

839
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:08,912
YOU'RE THERE TO--
HE SAID TO COME TO THE DERBY,

840
00:43:08,912 --> 00:43:10,978
AND YOU GET ALL
THE DRUNK SOUTHERNERS,

841
00:43:10,978 --> 00:43:12,978
YOU GET ALL
THE WEIRD SOCIALITES,

842
00:43:12,978 --> 00:43:15,179
THE WEIRD BOOKIES,
THE HANGERS-ON.

843
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,645
Depp:
"IT WAS A FACE
I'D SEEN A THOUSAND TIMES

844
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:19,278
AT EVERY DERBY
I'D BEEN TO.

845
00:43:19,278 --> 00:43:23,344
I SAW IT
IN MY HEAD AS THE MASK
OF THE WHISKEY GENTRY--

846
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:27,745
THE INEVITABLE RESULT
OF TOO MUCH INBREEDING."

847
00:43:27,745 --> 00:43:29,978
Hunter:
FIRST, I'D REALIZED I WAS
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

848
00:43:29,978 --> 00:43:32,244
A FRIEND OF MINE,
HE WROTE ME A NOTE SAYING

849
00:43:32,244 --> 00:43:34,645
"THAT DERBY PIECE
WAS PURE GONZO."

850
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,012
AND I THOUGHT, "WELL,
IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS..."

851
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:37,978
I THOUGHT
IT WAS A BRUTAL FAILURE.

852
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:40,678
I'D BOTCHED MY ASSIGNMENT,
YOU KNOW?

853
00:43:40,678 --> 00:43:42,511
IT WAS ONE
OF MY WORST FAILURES

854
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:46,278
AND I GOT THIS ONSLAUGHT
OF MAIL-- MAIL, CALLS--

855
00:43:46,278 --> 00:43:48,745
SAYING I MADE
A GREAT BREAKTHROUGH
IN JOURNALISM.

856
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,478
WELL, CHRIST,
IF I MADE IT--

857
00:43:50,478 --> 00:43:52,878
AS A BREAKTHROUGH,
WE'VE GOTTA CALL IT
SOMETHING.

858
00:43:52,878 --> 00:43:55,912
SO I LIKED THE WORD "GONZO,"
AND IT SEEMED TO ME
WHAT I WAS DOING--

859
00:43:55,912 --> 00:43:59,145
KIND OF NICE AND CRAZY,
LIKE ZEN. GONZO.

860
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:01,445
* HOPE YOU GUESS
MY NAME... *

861
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:04,445
- I'M EDWARD.
- Steadman: HE HAS
A BIRD CALLED EDWARD.

862
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:06,411
HE'S SUCH
A MARVELOUS CHARACTER.

863
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:10,445
I THINK HUNTER
TORMENTED IT, BUT IT WAS
KIND OF A TWO-WAY AFFECTION.

864
00:44:10,445 --> 00:44:13,545
HUNTER WOULD USE IT,
I THINK, TO BOUNCE OFF,

865
00:44:13,545 --> 00:44:15,545
TO BRING
INTO THE STORY

866
00:44:15,545 --> 00:44:17,611
HOW HE WAS
FEELING ABOUT IT,
WHO WAS THE BIRD.

867
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:21,244
I SUPPOSE THAT
AT SOME POINT I, IN A WAY,
BECAME THE BIRD.

868
00:44:22,978 --> 00:44:25,878
SPEAK UP, EDWARD.
SPEAK UP! SPEAK UP!
TALK TO ME!

869
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:29,079
HE BANGED THE CAGE--
BANG BANG BANG BANG!

870
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:31,112
"EDWARD.
IT'S ME, EDWARD.

871
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:32,912
I'M COMING
TO GET YOU, EDWARD."

872
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:37,079
HE'D OPEN THE CAGE,
AND HE'D SAY, "EDWARD,
THERE IS NO BIRD GOD

873
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,012
THAT'S GONNA HELP YOU
NOW, EDWARD."

874
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,578
AND THIS BIRD'S GOING...
( mimics bird )

875
00:44:42,578 --> 00:44:44,079
( squawking )

876
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,578
Steadman:
I FEEL LIKE EDWARD
SOMETIMES...

877
00:44:46,578 --> 00:44:48,079
NOW, WE'RE GOING
TO TALK, EDWARD.

878
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,511
Steadman:
...HOLDING ME LIKE A BIRD,

879
00:44:49,511 --> 00:44:51,578
AND I'M TRYING TO BITE
MY WAY OUT OF IT.

880
00:44:52,712 --> 00:44:55,045
I NEVER FELT FEAR

881
00:44:55,045 --> 00:44:57,278
WHEN HE WAS
AT THE WHEEL.

882
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,511
THERE'S NO HOLES
OVER HERE.

883
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:04,211
- OOH!
- THIS IS A BIG BOX.

884
00:45:04,211 --> 00:45:06,244
NO WONDER WHY I DON'T BUY
AMERICAN CARS. GOD DAMN IT.

885
00:45:06,244 --> 00:45:09,079
MOVE OVER,
I'M GONNA KILL SOMEBODY!
YOU'RE TOO SMALL!

886
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:11,578
- I WANT TO KILL SOMEBODY
A LOT BIGGER THAN YOU!
- ( tires screeching )

887
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:15,278
- WHAT'S THE SPEED LIMIT?
- 70. OH MY GOD, IT'S 75.

888
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:18,079
HOLY SHIT.
NO WONDER HE'S GOING--

889
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:21,812
Duke's voice:
WE WERE SOMEWHERE
AROUND BARSTOW,

890
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:24,578
ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT,
WHEN THE DRUGS BEGAN
TO TAKE HOLD.

891
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:27,411
SUDDENLY, THERE WAS
A TERRIBLE ROAR
ALL AROUND US

892
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:30,211
AND THE SKY WAS
FULL OF WHAT LOOKED
LIKE HUGE BATS,

893
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:33,778
ALL SWOOPING
AND SCREECHING AND
DIVING AROUND THE CAR.

894
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:36,778
AND A VOICE WAS SCREAMING,
"HOLY JESUS, WHAT ARE THESE
GODDAMN ANIMALS?!"

895
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,112
( yelling softly )

896
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:40,578
( screeches )

897
00:45:40,578 --> 00:45:43,344
DID YOU SAY
SOMETHING?HUH?

898
00:45:43,344 --> 00:45:45,211
NEVER MIND.

899
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:47,411
- IT'S YOUR TURN TO DRIVE.
- * EVERYBODY'S DANCING... *

900
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,244
Duke's voice:
"NO POINT IN MENTIONING
THESE BATS," I THOUGHT.

901
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:51,311
"THE POOR BASTARD
WILL SEE THEM SOON ENOUGH."

902
00:45:51,311 --> 00:45:54,045
Wenner: "FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS"-- IT STARTS
OFF LIKE A ROCKET.

903
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:55,845
"WE WERE SOMEWHERE
ON THE EDGE OF BARSTOW

904
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:57,712
WHEN THE DRUGS BEGAN
TO TAKE HOLD."

905
00:45:57,712 --> 00:46:00,611
WELL, THAT JUST GRABS YOU--
DAMN-- RIGHT THERE,

906
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:03,545
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUNK
WHAT WAS IN THE TRUNK--

907
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:05,344
ALL THE DRUGS,
THE SALT SHAKERS

908
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:07,445
FULL OF MESCALINE, COCAINE--
ON AND ON AND ON.

909
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:09,344
IT WAS MAD GENIUS STUFF.

910
00:46:09,344 --> 00:46:11,211
Duke's voice:
WE HAD TWO BAGS OF GRASS,

911
00:46:11,211 --> 00:46:13,478
75 PELLETS OF MESCALINE,

912
00:46:13,478 --> 00:46:16,112
FIVE SHEETS OF HIGH-POWERED
BLOTTER ACID,

913
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:18,112
- A SALT SHAKER
HALF-FULL OF COCAINE...
- ( bat screeching )

914
00:46:18,112 --> 00:46:21,311
...A PINT OF RAW ETHER,
AND TWO DOZEN AMYLS.

915
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,344
NOT THAT WE NEEDED
ALL THAT FOR THE TRIP,

916
00:46:23,344 --> 00:46:26,112
BUT ONCE YOU GET
LOCKED INTO A SERIOUS
DRUG COLLECTION,

917
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:30,045
THE TENDENCY IS TO PUSH IT
AS FAR AS YOU CAN.

918
00:46:30,045 --> 00:46:32,211
* DON'T MATTER
WHERE YOU COME FROM... *

919
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:34,045
Radio host:
A House subcommittee report

920
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:38,445
says illegal drugs
killed 160 American
GIs last year,

921
00:46:38,445 --> 00:46:41,179
40 of them
in Vietnam. Drugs--

922
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:44,712
- * One toke over
the line, sweet Jesus... *
- ONE TOKE, MAN!

923
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:48,545
* ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE

924
00:46:48,545 --> 00:46:51,745
* SITTIN' DOWNTOWN
IN A RAILWAY STATION *

925
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:54,112
* ONE TOKE
OVER THE LINE... *

926
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:56,545
Wenner: THROUGH ALL
THIS TIME, HE'S TRAVELING
WITH OSCAR ACOSTA.

927
00:46:56,545 --> 00:46:59,478
THEY WENT THERE AND HAD
THIS DRUG RAMPAGE.

928
00:46:59,478 --> 00:47:01,778
- I FOUND SOME GOOD GRASS
FOR $12 A LID.
- Hunter: GOOD.

929
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:04,912
- I JUST ORDERED TWO LIDS.
I'LL GET IT TOMORROW.
- GOD BLESS YOU.

930
00:47:04,912 --> 00:47:06,978
Wenner:
HUNTER'S RAOUL DUKE--
THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK--

931
00:47:06,978 --> 00:47:09,244
WE PUBLISHED WHATEVER WAS
PUBLISHED IN "ROLLING STONE."

932
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:11,012
IT WAS PUBLISHED
AS "BY RAOUL DUKE."

933
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:15,012
OSCAR TRANSMOGRIFIES
FROM OSCAR ZETA ACOSTA,

934
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:17,578
CRUSADING CHICANO ATTORNEY,
INTO DR. GONZO.

935
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:21,745
* I FELT THE JOY
AND I LEARNED ABOUT
THE PAIN *

936
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:23,411
* THEN MY MAMA SAID...

937
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:25,411
Laila Nabulsi:
RAOUL DUKE AND DR. GONZO

938
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:27,511
WERE HUNTER THOMPSON
AND OSCAR ACOSTA.

939
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,511
HE JUST USED THAT
AS A COVER.

940
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:31,478
YOU HAVE THESE
SORT OF ANTIHEROES.

941
00:47:31,478 --> 00:47:33,344
IT'S "BUTCH CASSIDY
AND THE SUNDANCE KID."

942
00:47:33,344 --> 00:47:35,211
IT'S JUST THE NEXT
VERSION IN A WAY.

943
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:37,745
THEY'RE OUTLAWS.
THESE GUYS WERE FIGHTING

944
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:39,712
AND THEY REALLY
WERE IN REAL LIFE.

945
00:47:39,712 --> 00:47:41,645
OSCAR ACOSTA WAS
USING THE LAW

946
00:47:41,645 --> 00:47:43,578
AND THE BROWN POWER MOVEMENT

947
00:47:43,578 --> 00:47:47,278
AND HUNTER WAS
FIGHTING WITH THE PEN
AND USING JOURNALISM.

948
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:50,945
SO THEY REALLY WERE WARRIORS
OF THEIR GENERATION.

949
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:54,578
* ...IN A RAILWAY STATION,
ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE *

950
00:47:54,578 --> 00:47:57,545
* ONE TOKE, ONE TOKE
OVER THE LINE. *

951
00:47:57,545 --> 00:47:59,311
Brinkley:
WHEN HUNTER WENT
TO LAS VEGAS,

952
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:01,179
HE WAS ON AN ASSIGNMENT
FOR "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"

953
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,611
TO WRITE ABOUT
THIS MOTORCYCLE RACE.

954
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:07,311
THEY ONLY WANTED
A VERY BRIEF, ALMOST LIKE
A LITTLE BOX ABOUT THE RACE.

955
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:11,578
HE DELIVERED
THIS SCREED THAT WENT ON
FOR ABOUT 60 PAGES

956
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:14,145
DETAILING THE DESERT
AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

957
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:16,778
AND IT HAD IN IT
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

958
00:48:16,778 --> 00:48:19,678
WILD, DRUGGY...

959
00:48:19,678 --> 00:48:22,712
FEEL THAT THE FINAL
"FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS" HAD.

960
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:26,545
Duke's voice:
IGNORE THIS TERRIBLE DRUG.
PRETEND IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

961
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:31,812
UH... HI THERE!
( groans )

962
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:33,812
MY NAME...

963
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:36,045
UH...

964
00:48:36,045 --> 00:48:39,845
- RAOUL DUKE.
- YOUR SUITE ISN'T
READY YET, BUT...

965
00:48:39,845 --> 00:48:41,678
( hisses, voice distorts )
SOMEONE WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU.

966
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:44,145
( yells )
NO! WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET. MOVE!

967
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:45,645
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

968
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:47,678
AT THAT POINT
THERE WAS STILL

969
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:50,079
KIND OF THAT TIMOTHY LEARY
APPROACH TO PSYCHEDELICS

970
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,012
GOING AROUND,
WHERE IT'S THIS
VERY PIOUS THING.

971
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,511
YOU SAT ON A PERSIAN RUG
AND LISTENED TO INDIAN MUSIC.

972
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:59,244
THERE HAD BEEN
VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY

973
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:02,211
OF ACTUALLY DEALING
WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN
YOU'RE STONED ON PSYCHEDELICS,

974
00:49:02,211 --> 00:49:04,211
YOU'RE OFTEN JUST
WAY OUT OF CONTROL

975
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:06,645
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GONNA
HANDLE THINGS.

976
00:49:06,645 --> 00:49:10,012
AND HUNTER MADE THAT
HIS REAL TOPIC.

977
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:12,812
Depp:
"WHAT LEARY
TOOK DOWN WITH HIM

978
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:15,012
WAS THE CENTRAL ILLUSION
OF A WHOLE LIFESTYLE

979
00:49:15,012 --> 00:49:16,678
THAT HE HELPED CREATE--

980
00:49:16,678 --> 00:49:19,278
A GENERATION
OF PERMANENT CRIPPLES,

981
00:49:19,278 --> 00:49:21,079
FAILED SEEKERS,
WHO NEVER UNDERSTOOD

982
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,611
THE ESSENTIAL
OLD-MYSTIC FALLACY
OF THE ACID CULTURE:

983
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:27,578
THE DESPERATE
ASSUMPTION THAT SOMEBODY
OR AT LEAST SOME FORCE

984
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:30,978
IS TENDING THE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL."

985
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,211
Woman: I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M
STARTING TO FEEL THAT DRINK.

986
00:49:35,211 --> 00:49:37,278
- PEANUTS, MAN.
- OH, GOD! OH, GOD.

987
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:39,311
TWO CUBA LIBRES
WITH BEER AND MESCAL
ON THE SIDE.

988
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,878
Duke's voice:
TERRIBLE THINGS WERE
HAPPENING ALL AROUND US.

989
00:49:45,878 --> 00:49:49,578
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO WALK IN THIS MUCK--
NO FOOTING AT ALL.

990
00:49:49,578 --> 00:49:53,478
Perry: AT LAST
THERE WAS A VOCABULARY FOR
TALKING ABOUT PSYCHEDELICS,

991
00:49:53,478 --> 00:49:56,112
AND IT WAS
ALSO AN EARLY CLUE
TO THE NEW DIRECTION--

992
00:49:56,112 --> 00:49:59,244
MORE AND MORE
CRAZINESS FROM HUNTER.
OF COURSE, HE WAS HIGH ANYWAY.

993
00:49:59,244 --> 00:50:01,211
I NEVER SAW
THE GUY WITHOUT
EITHER A CAN OF BUD

994
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:03,211
OR A BOTTLE
OF WILD TURKEY
IN HIS HAND.

995
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:04,878
HE DRANK A BOTTLE
OF BOURBON A DAY,

996
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:08,012
AND THAT WAS ON TOP
OF ALL THE PILLS
HE WAS TAKING,

997
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:11,611
SO HE WAS JUST
CONSTANTLY PUSHING
THE LIMIT OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

998
00:50:11,611 --> 00:50:14,411
( reptiles roaring )

999
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:18,079
Duke's voice:
I WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FUCKING REPTILE ZOO

1000
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,244
AND SOMEBODY WAS
GIVING BOOZE TO THESE
GODDAMN THINGS.

1001
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:24,812
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW
BEFORE THEY TEAR US
TO SHREDS!

1002
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:27,145
( roars )

1003
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:28,645
( yells )
PLEASE!

1004
00:50:28,645 --> 00:50:30,678
TELL ME ABOUT
THE FUCKING GOLF SHOES!

1005
00:50:30,678 --> 00:50:33,012
All: HUH?

1006
00:50:33,012 --> 00:50:36,545
THE REJECTION
BY "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"
INFURIATED HIM.

1007
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:39,344
AND IT WAS ONLY
AT THAT POINT THAT
HE STARTED REALIZING,

1008
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:41,344
LIKE, "EUREKA!
CHICAGO MAY NOT BE

1009
00:50:41,344 --> 00:50:43,344
WHERE THE DEATH
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IS.

1010
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:45,145
IT'S LAS VEGAS."

1011
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:47,578
( Hunter vocalizes )

1012
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:51,545
* OOH YES!

1013
00:50:51,545 --> 00:50:54,545
( vocalizes )

1014
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:58,678
* OOH YES!

1015
00:50:58,678 --> 00:51:01,712
* THESE LONG STRANGE NIGHTS

1016
00:51:01,712 --> 00:51:05,045
* THESE LONG
STRANGE NIGHTS... *

1017
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:07,912
Wenner:
HUNTER HAD RENTED A CADILLAC
AND WANTED ME TO PAY FOR IT.

1018
00:51:07,912 --> 00:51:11,411
I SAID, "NO," YOU KNOW?
"I'M NOT PAYING FOR THE
RENT OF A CADILLAC."

1019
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:14,578
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"WELL, I CAN'T COVER
THE GODDAMN AMERICAN DREAM

1020
00:51:14,578 --> 00:51:17,079
IN A VOLKSWAGEN.
WHAT THE FUCK IS
WRONG WITH YOU?"

1021
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:19,145
AND UM...

1022
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:21,145
YOU KNOW, OF COURSE
THAT'S QUITE TRUE.

1023
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:23,945
( Steadman vocalizes )

1024
00:51:23,945 --> 00:51:26,611
* DRIVE YOUR STAKE

1025
00:51:26,611 --> 00:51:29,712
* THROUGH
A DARKENED HEART *

1026
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:35,012
* IN A RED
MERCEDES BENZ... *

1027
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:37,079
Depp:
"BREAKDOWN
ON PARADISE BLVD."

1028
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:38,578
"AT THIS POINT
IN THE CHRONOLOGY,

1029
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:41,445
DR. DUKE APPEARS TO HAVE
BROKEN DOWN COMPLETELY.

1030
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:43,878
THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT
IS SO SPLINTERED

1031
00:51:43,878 --> 00:51:46,845
THAT WE WERE FORCED
TO SEEK OUT THE ORIGINAL
TAPE RECORDING

1032
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:50,211
AND TRANSCRIBE IT
VERBATIM."

1033
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:53,645
Hunter:
TESTING-- ONE, TWO.

1034
00:51:53,645 --> 00:51:58,244
CLOSING.
OKAY, IT IS NOW 11:30 A.M.

1035
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:17,645
Depp:
"THE TRANSCRIPTION
BEGINS SOMEWHERE

1036
00:52:17,645 --> 00:52:20,145
ON THE NORTHEAST OUTSKIRTS
OF LAS VEGAS--

1037
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:23,478
ZOOMING ALONG PARADISE ROAD
IN THE WHITE WHALE."

1038

( Hunter speaks )

1043
00:52:49,812 --> 00:52:51,678
- HELLO.
- MAY I HELP YOU?

1044
00:52:51,678 --> 00:52:54,112
- YEAH.YOU HAVE
TACOS HERE?
- MM-HMM.

1045
00:52:54,112 --> 00:52:56,079
BUT THEY'RE FIVE
FOR A DOLLAR?

1046
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,645
I'LL TAKE
FIVE OF THEM.

1047
00:52:57,645 --> 00:53:00,278
DO YOU WANT
ANYTHING TO DRINK?

1048
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:02,478
BEER.NO, I HAVE
BEER IN THE CAR--

1049
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:05,578
TONS OF IT--
THE WHOLE BACK SEAT'S
LOADED WITH IT.

1050
00:53:05,578 --> 00:53:07,244
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM.

1051
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:09,179
WE WERE TOLD THAT
IT WAS SOMEWHERE
IN THIS AREA, BUT--

1052
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:11,378
- THE AMERICAN DREAM?
- YEAH, THE AMERICAN DREAM.

1053
00:53:11,378 --> 00:53:14,045
- I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING--
GO TO PARADISE.
- IS THAT IT?

1054
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:16,179
WE'RE HERE LOOKING FOR
IT BECAUSE THEY SENT
US OUT HERE,

1055
00:53:16,179 --> 00:53:18,778
ALL THE WAY
FROM SAN FRANCISCO,
TO LOOK FOR IT.

1056
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,344
THAT'S WHY THEY GAVE US
THAT WHITE CADILLAC.

1057
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:23,812
THEY FIGURED THAT
WE COULD CATCH UP
WITH IT IN THAT.

1058
00:53:23,812 --> 00:53:27,211
HEY, LUKE,
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS?

1059
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:29,378
Acosta:
SHE'S ASKING HIM.

1060
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:31,978
- WHAT IS IT?
- THAT'S WHAT
WE DON'T KNOW.

1061
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:34,712
WE WERE SENT OUT HERE
FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOOK
FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM.

1062
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,211
NOW ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS?!
BECAUSE--

1063
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:39,344
Acosta:
NO, LOOK AT THE CAR.
I MEAN, DO I LOOK LIKE--

1064
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:44,978
COULD THAT BE
THE OLD PSYCHIATRISTS' CLUB?
IT WAS A DISCOTHEQUE PLACE.

1065
00:53:44,978 --> 00:53:48,611
ALL WE WERE TOLD WAS,
"GO TILL YOU FIND
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

1066
00:53:48,611 --> 00:53:50,112
TAKE THIS WHITE CADILLAC

1067
00:53:50,112 --> 00:53:51,611
AND GO FIND
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

1068
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:53,045
IT'S SOMEWHERE
IN THE LAS VEGAS AREA."

1069
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:55,445
ARE YOU TAKING
PICTURES OF IT OR--

1070
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:59,311
- NO NO NO, PICTURES, JUST--
- SOMEBODY JUST SENT YOU
ON A GOOSE CHASE.

1071
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:01,445
IT'S SORT OF
A WILD GOOSE CHASE
MORE OR LESS, YEAH.

1072
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:03,445
Woman:
IT HAS TO BE
THE OLD PSYCHIATRISTS'.

1073
00:54:03,445 --> 00:54:05,112
BUT THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO HANG OUT THERE

1074
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:07,179
IS A BUNCH
OF PUSHERS, PEDDLERS,

1075
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,678
- UPPERS-AND-DOWNERS
AND ALL THAT STUFF.
- MAYBE THAT'S IT.

1076
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:11,545
- DOPERS.
- COULD BE IT.

1077
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:13,712
I THINK THIS PLACE,
THE WAY YOU'RE
DESCRIBING IT--

1078
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:15,945
I THINK-- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THAT'S IT.

1079
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:21,878
( "Get Together"
playing )

1080
00:54:21,878 --> 00:54:24,812
Wenner:
HUNTER SAID, YOU KNOW,
VEGAS IS THE CITY

1081
00:54:24,812 --> 00:54:26,812
THAT WAS THE DEATH
OF WHAT HE THOUGHT

1082
00:54:26,812 --> 00:54:28,978
WAS THE AMERICAN DREAM.
IN THAT FAMOUS SCENE,

1083
00:54:28,978 --> 00:54:32,845
HE SEES THAT OPPORTUNITY
AND POSSIBILITY THAT WAS
REPRESENTED BY THE '60s.

1084
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:35,311
"THE WAVE ROLLS BACK

1085
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:37,179
AND," HE SAID, "ONCE FOR
A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT THERE,

1086
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:40,578
- WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT."
- * IT FEELS THE WAY
WE DIE... *

1087
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:43,712
Duke's voice:
SAN FRANCISCO
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE '60s

1088
00:54:43,712 --> 00:54:47,045
WAS A VERY SPECIAL TIME
AND PLACE TO BE A PART OF,

1089
00:54:47,045 --> 00:54:49,045
BUT NO EXPLANATION,

1090
00:54:49,045 --> 00:54:51,978
NO MIX OF WORDS
OR MUSIC OR MEMORIES

1091
00:54:51,978 --> 00:54:54,978
CAN TOUCH THAT SENSE
OF KNOWING THAT YOU
WERE THERE

1092
00:54:54,978 --> 00:54:57,978
AND ALIVE IN THAT CORNER
OF TIME IN THE WORLD,

1093
00:54:57,978 --> 00:55:00,845
WHATEVER IT MEANT.

1094
00:55:00,845 --> 00:55:04,545
* AND YOU MAY NOT
KNOW WHY... *

1095
00:55:06,578 --> 00:55:10,344
Duke's voice:
THERE WAS MADNESS IN
ANY DIRECTION, AT ANY HOUR.

1096
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:13,745
YOU COULD STRIKE
SPARKS ANYWHERE.

1097
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:15,745
THERE WAS A FANTASTIC
UNIVERSAL SENSE

1098
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,079
THAT WHATEVER
WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,

1099
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,878
THAT WE WERE WINNING.

1100
00:55:19,878 --> 00:55:22,211
AND THAT, I THINK,
WAS THE HANDLE...

1101
00:55:22,211 --> 00:55:29,845
I have seen... the promised land.
I may not get there with you...

1102
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,234
Duke's voice:
...THAT SENSE OF
INEVITABLE VICTORY

1103
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,900
OVER THE FORCES
OF OLD AND EVIL.

1104
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,534
NOT IN ANY MEAN
OR MILITARY SENSE;

1105
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:38,434
<i>WE DIDN'T NEED THAT.</i>

1106
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,099
<i>OUR ENERGY
WOULD SIMPLY PREVAIL.</i>

1107
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,100
<i>WE HAD
ALL THE MOMENTUM.</i>

1108
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,000
<i>WE WERE RIDING
THE CREST OF A HIGH
AND BEAUTIFUL WAVE.</i>

1109
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,600
We, as a people,
will get to the promised land!

1110
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
<i>Duke's voice:
SO NOW, LESS THAN
FIVE YEARS LATER,</i>

1111
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
<i>YOU CAN GO UP
ON A STEEP HILL</i>

1112
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
<i>IN LAS VEGAS
AND LOOK WEST</i>

1113
00:56:01,626 --> 00:56:03,392
AND WITH
THE RIGHT KIND OF EYES

1114
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:06,192
YOU CAN ALMOST SEE
THE HIGH-WATER MARK,

1115
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:09,092
THAT PLACE WHERE
THE WAVE FINALLY BROKE...

1116
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:12,259
- AND ROLLED BACK.
- ( gunshot )

1117
00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:14,758
Martin Luther King was shot
and was killed tonight.

1118
00:56:14,758 --> 00:56:17,192
- ( gunshot )
- ( women scream )

1119
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:24,192
Nabulsi:
IT'S AMAZING TO THINK
THAT IN 1971

1120
00:56:24,192 --> 00:56:27,858
HE ALREADY SAW
THAT FINAL NAIL
IN THE COFFIN OF THE '60s,

1121
00:56:27,858 --> 00:56:29,925
WHICH IS
REALLY BITTERSWEET.

1122
00:56:29,925 --> 00:56:32,359
AND I THINK FOR HUNTER
IT WAS BITTERSWEET,

1123
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:35,559
SO I THINK SPEECH
SORT OF ENCAPSULATES THAT.

1124
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,825
I HAVEN'T READ ANYTHING ELSE
ON THAT GENERATION,

1125
00:56:38,825 --> 00:56:41,626
THAT SUBJECT
THAT MOVES ME AS MUCH.

1126
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:43,758
I FELT IT WAS
SO IMPORTANT.

1127
00:56:43,758 --> 00:56:45,658
TO ME, IT WAS
THE DRIVING THING

1128
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:47,791
THAT MADE ME
WANNA DO THE MOVIE.

1129
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:49,592
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF IT--

1130
00:56:49,592 --> 00:56:52,325
THAT ISN'T ONE
OF THE BEST FUCKING THINGS
I'VE EVER WRITTEN--

1131
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,758
TO TURN IT INTO SOME KIND OF
A STUPID CARTOON SHOW--

1132
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:56,592
Woman:
IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS
THAT ANYBODY'S EVER WRITTEN.

1133
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:58,425
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE
A VERY HIGH AFFECTION

1134
00:56:58,425 --> 00:57:00,359
FOR THAT ONE PIECE
AND SO DO OTHER PEOPLE.

1135
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:02,626
Nabulsi:
BEFORE TERRY GILLIAM WAS
HIRED TO DIRECT THE FILM,

1136
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:04,992
THERE WAS ANOTHER DIRECTOR,
BUT THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT

1137
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:07,791
WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT
THIS ANIMATED SEQUENCE

1138
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:12,626
IN THE WAVE SPEECH
OF THIS LITTLE HUNTER
ON A WAVE OF BONES.

1139
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:14,758
YOU CAN SEE
THAT I MIGHT BE
A LITTLE BIT EDGY

1140
00:57:14,758 --> 00:57:16,526
WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT PUTTING IT
IN A CARTOON FORM

1141
00:57:16,526 --> 00:57:18,325
WITH ME ON
SOME KIND OF TIDAL WAVE

1142
00:57:18,325 --> 00:57:21,125
ACROSS SOME IMAGINARY
MICKEY MOUSE DESERT.

1143
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,892
Man:
YOU'VE BEEN PUT
IN A CARTOON FORM ALREADY.

1144
00:57:23,892 --> 00:57:26,492
THE PROBLEM IS
THAT YOU'VE PUBLISHED
A NOVEL WITH CARTOONS.

1145
00:57:26,492 --> 00:57:28,791
- I HIRED RALPH
TO DO SOME DRAWINGS.
- AND THEY'RE GREAT.

1146
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,825
- No no no no.
- You're really
getting me angry.

1147
00:57:30,825 --> 00:57:32,526
Nabulsi:
I KNOW HUNTER
WELL ENOUGH

1148
00:57:32,526 --> 00:57:35,359
THAT EVEN IF HE WAS MAD,
I'M NOT TERRIFIED

1149
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:36,958
AND I KNOW HOW
TO GET THROUGH IT,

1150
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,159
BUT I WAS JUST
SORT OF SHOCKED

1151
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:41,758
THAT IT HAD GONE
SO AWRY.

1152
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:45,092
Hunter on TV:
Just don't fucking go
and make it a cartoon!

1153
00:57:45,092 --> 00:57:46,858
All right, we're having
a little problem here

1154
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:49,725
with your goddamn
stupid fucking cartoons
in this thing.

1155
00:57:49,725 --> 00:57:51,058
If you think
you're in charge
of this movie,

1156
00:57:51,058 --> 00:57:52,392
we're gonna have
a real problem right now.

1157
00:57:52,392 --> 00:57:54,492
IF YOU WANT WAR--
HERE WE GO, BABY--

1158
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:56,725
THERE'S GONNA BE
A NASTY FUCKING WAR.

1159
00:57:56,725 --> 00:58:00,791
YEAH, BUT I DON'T LIKE
YOU TURNING ON ME
AT THE END.

1160
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,425
I MUST SAY
I DON'T LIKE
THAT AT ALL.

1161
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:03,758
Hunter:
WHAT SHOULD I HAVE SAID?

1162
00:58:03,758 --> 00:58:05,725
"NO, I'VE KNOWN LAILA
FOR MANY YEARS...

1163
00:58:05,725 --> 00:58:08,925
- ( all laughing )
- ...AND SHE WOULD
NEVER SAY THAT."

1164
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:13,392
- Man #2: FUCK.
- HE HAD A KIND OF
OVER-THE-TOP

1165
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:16,058
DRAMATIC WAY OF BEING.

1166
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:19,058
YEAH, I'LL TALK TO HUNTER NOW.
YEAH, OKAY.

1167
00:58:19,058 --> 00:58:21,058
HUNTER, HOW ARE YA?

1168
00:58:21,058 --> 00:58:23,559
Wenner:
HUNTER ALWAYS HAD
TO HAVE A RUNNING CRISIS.

1169
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:25,159
GOING ON
OF SOME TYPE OF OTHER--

1170
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:26,925
TO ANIMATE HIM,
TO GET HIM GOING.

1171
00:58:26,925 --> 00:58:29,992
WHAT DISEASE?
I MEAN, DO YOU-- IS IT
A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS THING?

1172
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:33,125
BRAIN-- BRAIN DAMAGE.

1173
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,958
I SEE.

1174
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:38,292
Jimmy Buffet:
HUNTER DID EVERYTHING
FOR EFFECT.

1175
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,092
HE WAS NOT EVER HAPPY,
I DON'T BELIEVE,

1176
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:43,858
WHEN THINGS WERE
STABLE AND TRANQUIL.

1177
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:46,725
Crouse:
HUNTER WAS
A FORCE OF NATURE.

1178
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:48,925
HUNTER WOULD SIT

1179
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:51,492
VERY STILL
AND VERY STRAIGHT

1180
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:55,325
WITH HIS ARMS UP
LIKE THIS, WAITING.

1181
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:59,359
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE WOULD GET A JOLT
AND HE WOULD TYPE.

1182
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,159
HE ALSO HAD DEADLINES,

1183
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:03,292
AND HUNTER NEVER MET
A DEADLINE.

1184
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:05,592
HE WAS COMPLETELY
BEHIND DEADLINE.

1185
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:08,691
HE HADN'T WRITTEN
A WORD AND JANN WAS
CALLING AND SCREAMING.

1186
00:59:08,691 --> 00:59:11,192
HUNTER WAS, AT THAT TIME,
CARRYING AROUND
THE MOJO WIRE...

1187
00:59:11,192 --> 00:59:13,259
Announcer:
Just insert the document--

1188
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:18,559
...WHICH WAS
A SUITCASE-SIZED PORTABLE
TRANSMISSION MACHINE.

1189
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,526
Announcer:
In just six minutes
or less,

1190
00:59:20,526 --> 00:59:22,758
an exact copy
of the document

1191
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:24,892
can be received anywhere
in the country.

1192
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:26,958
HE SAID, "I'VE GOTTA
DO THE STORY." I SAID,
"YOU HAVEN'T WRITTEN THE STORY."

1193
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:29,192
"IT DOESN'T MATTER.
JUST-- WHEN I TELL YOU TO,

1194
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:33,058
JUST TAKE THE PLUG
AND UNPLUG IT--

1195
00:59:33,058 --> 00:59:35,658
IN AND OUT--
ON THE MACHINE."

1196
00:59:35,658 --> 00:59:38,725
HE CALLED UP
"ROLLING STONE" OFFICES,

1197
00:59:38,725 --> 00:59:40,858
"WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE WORKING."

1198
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:44,159
THE ENTIRE PLACE IS
SHUT DOWN

1199
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:46,725
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
HAS BEEN DONE EXCEPT
THESE FOUR PAGES

1200
00:59:46,725 --> 00:59:50,025
- YOU'VE BEEN
HOLDING FOR HUNTER.
- I WAS USUALLY THE GUY,

1201
00:59:50,025 --> 00:59:51,325
AT 2:00 OR 3:00
IN THE MORNING,

1202
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:53,992
WHO HAD TO BE THERE TO GET
THE FEED FROM HUNTER.

1203
00:59:53,992 --> 00:59:57,825
HE TOOK THE FAX MACHINE,
HELD THE PHONE LIKE THIS
AND DESTROYED IT.

1204
00:59:57,825 --> 00:59:59,592
AND THEN HE WENT
INTO THIS RAVE

1205
00:59:59,592 --> 01:00:01,392
ABOUT SOME EDITOR
ON THE OTHER END,

1206
01:00:01,392 --> 01:00:02,825
THEN HUNG THE PHONE UP
AND WENT TO THE BAR.

1207
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,325
Perry:
JANN WAS GENERALLY SO HAPPY
WITH THE KIND OF STUFF

1208
01:00:07,325 --> 01:00:09,758
THAT HUNTER WAS TURNING IN
THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

1209
01:00:09,758 --> 01:00:11,925
IT WAS JUST MERELY
A DAMN INCONVENIENCE FOR US.

1210
01:00:11,925 --> 01:00:14,092
Young Wenner:
THE EDITOR'S NOTE SAYS

1211
01:00:14,092 --> 01:00:16,925
"AFTER LONG,
HEAVY AND OCCASIONALLY
BRUTAL NEGOTIATIONS,

1212
01:00:16,925 --> 01:00:18,392
DR. THOMPSON IS
BACK ON THE PAYROLL.

1213
01:00:18,392 --> 01:00:20,825
HIS GIBBERISH WILL
APPEAR REGULARLY

1214
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,359
IN AN UNPREDICTABLE LENGTH
ON A WIDE VARIETY
OF SUBJECT MATTER.

1215
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,025
WE HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE
IN HIM, FOR GOOD OR ILL."

1216
01:00:26,025 --> 01:00:29,359
Wenner:
AFTER "VEGAS,"
IT WAS CLEAR

1217
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,626
WHAT AN ENORMOUS TALENT
HUNTER WAS,

1218
01:00:32,626 --> 01:00:34,626
AND, WITH THE ENERGY
AND THE REPORTING LEVEL,

1219
01:00:34,626 --> 01:00:38,392
HE WAS GOING TO BE
BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
AT "ROLLING STONE."

1220
01:00:38,392 --> 01:00:40,159
WOULD YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER PLACE
TO PUBLISH YOUR STUFF

1221
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:41,925
IF IT WASN'T
FOR "ROLLING STONE"?

1222
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,292
Wenner:
SO IT WAS ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR WHAT WOULD BE NEXT.

1223
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:49,758
WHAT WOULD BE
THE NEXT ASSIGNMENT?

1224
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:51,392
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST THING
WE COULD THINK OF?

1225
01:00:51,392 --> 01:00:53,192
I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
THAT HE SHOULD MOVE
TO WASHINGTON,

1226
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:55,658
BECOME THE FULL-TIME
CORRESPONDENT

1227
01:00:55,658 --> 01:00:57,725
FOR THE McGOVERN CAMPAIGN.

1228
01:00:57,725 --> 01:01:00,159
TWO OF THE CLASSICAL WORKS
OF AMERICAN POLITICS

1229
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:03,159
CAME OUT OF THAT CAMPAIGN
AND OUT OF THAT ASSIGNMENT
FOR "ROLLING STONE."

1230
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,559
ONE IS "FEAR AND LOATHING:
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL"
BY HUNTER;

1231
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:08,925
AND "BOYS ON THE BUS"
BY TIM CROUSE,

1232
01:01:08,925 --> 01:01:10,459
WHO WAS ONE
OF OUR LITTLE JUNIOR STARS.

1233
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,526
BUT HE WANTED TO BE UP THERE
AND COVER THE CAMPAIGN,

1234
01:01:12,526 --> 01:01:15,492
SO I SAID, "SURE.
GO RIGHT AHEAD. YOU CAN HELP
HUNTER WHILE YOU'RE AT IT."

1235
01:01:15,492 --> 01:01:17,526
PART OF THE REASON
I WAS THERE

1236
01:01:17,526 --> 01:01:20,292
WAS TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

1237
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:23,058
AND WHAT I FELT FROM HIM

1238
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:26,192
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS
A SENSE OF PROTECTION.

1239
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:30,192
AND WE BECAME
A VERY GOOD TEAM THAT WAY.

1240
01:01:30,192 --> 01:01:31,725
Young Wenner:
IF YOU WERE REALLY INTERESTED
IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING

1241
01:01:31,725 --> 01:01:33,559
ON THE McGOVERN CAMPAIGN,
THE ELECTION,

1242
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:35,359
YOU WOULD'VE ALSO--
ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT
AS WIDELY KNOWN--

1243
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,292
TURNED TO "ROLLING STONE"
TO FIND OUT REALLY
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1244
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:38,992
HUNTER'S COVERAGE
AND RECORD OF IT--

1245
01:01:38,992 --> 01:01:40,691
HIS COVERAGE WAS
JUST BRILLIANT.

1246
01:01:40,691 --> 01:01:42,626
( Wenner and Hunter
speaking )

1247
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:58,691
Pat Caddell: WHEN HE
SHOWED UP AT THE CAMPAIGN,
NO ONE KNEW WHO HE WAS.

1248
01:01:58,691 --> 01:02:01,025
BUT I'M STILL IN COLLEGE,
SO I READ "ROLLING STONE,"

1249
01:02:01,025 --> 01:02:03,259
SO I KNEW WHO HE WAS.
NOBODY ELSE KNEW.

1250
01:02:03,259 --> 01:02:04,825
THAT WAS
HIS GREAT ADVANTAGE--

1251
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:06,592
NOBODY WAS PAYING
ATTENTION TO HIM...

1252
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:08,892
UNTIL HE STARTED PUBLISHING,

1253
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,725
THEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.

1254
01:02:10,725 --> 01:02:14,259
Depp:
"SO THIS IS MORE
OF A JANGLED CAMPAIGN DIARY

1255
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:16,025
THAN A RECORD
OR REASONED ANALYSIS

1256
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:18,025
OF THE '72
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

1257
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:21,592
FROM DECEMBER '71
TO JANUARY '73

1258
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:23,858
IN AIRPORT BARS,
ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOPS

1259
01:02:23,858 --> 01:02:25,459
AND DREARY HOTEL ROOMS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

1260
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:28,159
THERE IS HARDLY
A PARAGRAPH IN THIS SAGA

1261
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:30,925
THAT WASN'T
PRODUCED IN A LAST-MINUTE
TEETH-GRINDING FRENZY.

1262
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:35,658
EVERY DEADLINE WAS
A CRISIS

1263
01:02:35,658 --> 01:02:37,858
WHEN I WAS CRANKING IT
OUT OF THE TYPEWRITER

1264
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:39,958
ONE PAGE AT A TIME
AND FEEDING IT

1265
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:42,325
- INTO THE PLASTIC MAW
OF THAT GODDAMN MOJO WIRE...
- ( fax buzzing )

1266
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:44,325
...TO SOME HASH-ADDLED FREAK
OF AN EDITOR

1267
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:47,559
AT THE 'ROLLING STONE'
NEWS DESK IN SAN FRANCISCO."

1268
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,392
THERE. CHEW ON THAT
GIBBERISH FOR A WHILE,
YOU HEARTLESS SCUM.

1269
01:02:53,691 --> 01:02:55,892
- ( buzzing )
- YOU PUSHED ME TOO FAR.

1270
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,058
( buzzing frantically )

1271
01:03:00,058 --> 01:03:01,492
( buzzing stops )

1272
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:07,526
( gunshot )

1273
01:03:07,526 --> 01:03:10,025
McGovern:
I COULDN'T READ THAT BOOK,
"FEAR AND LOATHING,"

1274
01:03:10,025 --> 01:03:13,025
WITHOUT BEING IN A PLACE
WHERE I COULD LAUGH OUT LOUD

1275
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:15,325
FROM TIME TO TIME.

1276
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:17,359
IT WAS A HILARIOUS BOOK.

1277
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,825
I HAVE BEEN QUOTED MANY TIMES
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN--

1278
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:24,359
IT WAS THE MOST ACCURATE
AND LEAST FACTUAL ACCOUNT
OF THAT CAMPAIGN.

1279
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:26,392
( all laugh )

1280
01:03:26,392 --> 01:03:28,058
McGovern:
I'LL SAY ONE OTHER THING:

1281
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:31,025
THAT BOOK WAS WRITTEN
FOR "ROLLING STONE"

1282
01:03:31,025 --> 01:03:34,192
AS THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSED.

1283
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:37,259
IT WASN'T SOMETHING WRITTEN
FROM THE HINDSIGHT

1284
01:03:37,259 --> 01:03:40,392
OF THE CAMPAIGN.
THOSE CHAPTERS ROLLED OFF

1285
01:03:40,392 --> 01:03:44,958
OF HIS TYPEWRITER
AS THE CAMPAIGN MOVED ALONG.

1286
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:50,092
Perry:
IT WAS A JOURNALISTIC RISK.

1287
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,925
HE HAD COVERED
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS BEFORE

1288
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:55,192
HE WAS JUST SICK
OF THE CONVENTIONS,

1289
01:03:55,192 --> 01:03:57,559
SITTING AROUND
AND REPORTING THE SPEECHES.

1290
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:01,592
AND THE SPEECHES WERE
ALL WRITTEN FOR REPORTERS
TO WRITE ABOUT.

1291
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:03,626
Depp:
"AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED,

1292
01:04:03,626 --> 01:04:05,958
THERE WAS NO SUCH THING
AS 'OFF THE RECORD.'

1293
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,125
UNLIKE MOST
OTHER CORRESPONDENTS

1294
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:09,992
I COULD AFFORD TO BURN
ALL MY BRIDGES BEHIND ME,

1295
01:04:09,992 --> 01:04:11,791
'CAUSE I WAS ONLY THERE
FOR A YEAR.

1296
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:14,025
AND THE LAST THING
I CARED ABOUT

1297
01:04:14,025 --> 01:04:17,559
WAS ESTABLISHING
LONG-TERM CONNECTIONS
ON CAPITOL HILL."

1298
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:19,758
HE WANTED
TO STIR THINGS UP.

1299
01:04:19,758 --> 01:04:22,192
Buchanan:
THERE WAS NO ONE
QUITE LIKE HUNTER.

1300
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,858
HE WAS ON THE EDGE
AND BEYOND THE EDGE,

1301
01:04:24,858 --> 01:04:26,492
AND IT WAS VERY FUNNY.

1302
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:29,526
I REMEMBER HE WROTE
THAT HUBERT HUMPHREY,

1303
01:04:29,526 --> 01:04:31,392
THE GREAT FATHER
OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT--

1304
01:04:31,392 --> 01:04:35,691
HE SAID, "THEY OUGHT TO STUFF
HUBERT IN A GODDAMN BOTTLE

1305
01:04:35,691 --> 01:04:37,592
AND SEND HIM OUT
WITH THE JAPANESE CURRENT."

1306
01:04:37,592 --> 01:04:40,626
Depp:
"THERE IS NO WAY TO GRASP
WHAT A SHALLOW, CONTEMPTIBLE

1307
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:44,225
AND HOPELESSLY
DISHONEST OLD HACK
HUBERT HUMPHREY REALLY IS

1308
01:04:44,225 --> 01:04:47,159
UNTIL YOU'VE FOLLOWED
HIM AROUND FOR A WHILE
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

1309
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:50,092
HUBERT HUMPHREY IS
A TREACHEROUS,

1310
01:04:50,092 --> 01:04:52,292
GUTLESS OLD WARD-HEELER."

1311
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:55,359
Buchanan:
HE HAD A VIEW OF THE
RIDICULOUSNESS OF IT ALL...

1312
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,125
THANK YOU.
SHALOM SHALOM.

1313
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,691
...AND HUNTER DID
SOME OF HIS BEST WORK
ON THE LIBERALS.

1314
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:03,825
McGovern:
HE WAS PARTICULARLY
HOSTILE TO HUBERT,

1315
01:05:03,825 --> 01:05:06,192
BUT HE CERTAINLY
LOATHED RICHARD NIXON.

1316
01:05:06,192 --> 01:05:10,192
Depp:
"OUR BARBIE DOLL PRESIDENT
WITH HIS BARBIE DOLL WIFE

1317
01:05:10,192 --> 01:05:12,159
AND HIS BOXFUL
OF BARBIE DOLL CHILDREN

1318
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:16,125
IS ALSO AMERICA'S ANSWER
TO THE MONSTROUS MR. HYDE.

1319
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,758
HE SPEAKS
TO THE WEREWOLF IN US

1320
01:05:18,758 --> 01:05:22,025
ON NIGHTS WHEN THE MOON
COMES TOO CLOSE."

1321
01:05:22,025 --> 01:05:25,359
NIXON REPRESENTS
EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS COUNTRY...

1322
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,526
DOWN THE LINE.

1323
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,359
Buchanan:
WELL, HE FIRST CAME
INTO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS

1324
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:34,825
IN THE BEGINNING OF 1968.
HE WAS WRITING FOR
"PAGEANT" MAGAZINE.

1325
01:05:34,825 --> 01:05:37,691
HE CAME UP TO COVER US.
I WAS WITH NIXON IN THE
NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY

1326
01:05:37,691 --> 01:05:42,192
AND HUNTER WOULD
IMPORTUNE ME TO GET
SOME TIME WITH THE CANDIDATE.

1327
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:46,125
SO WE GOT HUNTER--
AS I RECALL IT--

1328
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,658
WE PUT HIM
IN THE CAR WITH NIXON

1329
01:05:47,658 --> 01:05:49,292
IN THE BACKSEAT
OF THE LIMO

1330
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:51,758
WHEN NIXON WAS GOING
TO MANCHESTER AIRPORT.

1331
01:05:51,758 --> 01:05:56,025
Man: WASN'T IT IN 1968
YOU TRIED TO INTERVIEW NIXON?

1332
01:05:56,025 --> 01:05:57,492
Hunter:
NO, I DID IT. I HAD
A WONDERFUL TALK WITH HIM.

1333
01:05:57,492 --> 01:05:59,058
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT?

1334
01:05:59,058 --> 01:06:01,559
FOOTBALL. I WAS
THE ONLY PERSON
IN THE PRESS CORPS

1335
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:02,825
WHO COULD TALK
ABOUT FOOTBALL.

1336
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,492
IS THIS A NEED THAT
OCCURS TO HIM DURING--

1337
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:06,359
OH, YEAH.
HE'S A COMPLETE
FOOTBALL FREAK.

1338
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:09,626
AND I SAID, "NO,
OF COURSE. I'M A FREAK.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT."

1339
01:06:09,626 --> 01:06:11,626
HE SAID, "BUT YOU--
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTS

1340
01:06:11,626 --> 01:06:14,425
TO TALK ABOUT VIETNAM
AND THAT KIND OF THING."

1341
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:16,725
I SAID, "NO, I'LL TALK
ABOUT FOOTBALL.
DON'T WORRY."

1342
01:06:16,725 --> 01:06:18,725
HE SAID,
"OKAY, IF YOU PROMISE,
THEN YOU CAN RIDE

1343
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,592
IN THE CAR WITH HIM
BACK TO THE AIRPORT."

1344
01:06:20,592 --> 01:06:21,958
IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR
AND A HALF RIDE,

1345
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,592
JUST ME A NIXON
IN THE BACKSEAT.

1346
01:06:23,592 --> 01:06:25,492
WAS HE
AN AMIABLE FELLOW?

1347
01:06:25,492 --> 01:06:28,259
OH, ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.
IT WAS KIND OF PLEASANT.
IT WAS WEIRD.

1348
01:06:28,259 --> 01:06:32,559
( chanting )
FOUR MORE YEARS,
FOUR MORE YEARS...

1349
01:06:34,025 --> 01:06:38,892
TONIGHT I AGAIN
PROUDLY ACCEPT
THAT NOMINATION

1350
01:06:38,892 --> 01:06:41,192
- FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
- ( crowd cheering )

1351
01:06:45,259 --> 01:06:49,492
Hunter:
RICHARD NIXON REPRESENTS
EVERYTHING THAT I...

1352
01:06:49,492 --> 01:06:52,125
NOT ONLY HAVE CONTEMPT FOR
BUT DISLIKE AND THINK
SHOULD BE STOMPED OUT.

1353
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:55,392
Depp:
"HE WAS A CHEAP CROOK
AND A MERCILESS WAR CRIMINAL

1354
01:06:55,392 --> 01:06:58,559
WHO BOMBED MORE PEOPLE
TO DEATH IN LAOS AND CAMBODIA

1355
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,559
THAN THE U.S. ARMY LOST
IN ALL OF WORLD WAR II.

1356
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,626
WHEN STUDENTS
AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY

1357
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:06,459
IN OHIO PROTESTED
THE BOMBING,

1358
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:08,992
HE CONNIVED TO HAVE THEM
ATTACKED AND SLAIN

1359
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:12,858
- BY TROOPS FROM
THE NATIONAL GUARD."
- ( gunfire )

1360
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:15,958
"SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY
THAT WORDS LIKE 'SCUM'
AND 'ROTTEN'

1361
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:18,225
ARE WRONG
FOR OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM,

1362
01:07:18,225 --> 01:07:20,758
WHICH IS TRUE.
BUT THEY MISS THE POINT.

1363
01:07:20,758 --> 01:07:22,592
IT WAS
THE BUILT-IN BLIND SPOTS

1364
01:07:22,592 --> 01:07:24,359
OF THE OBJECTIVE
RULES AND DOGMA

1365
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:26,058
THAT ALLOWED
NIXON TO SLITHER

1366
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:27,958
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1367
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,025
HE SEEMED
SO ALL-AMERICAN."

1368
01:07:30,025 --> 01:07:36,725
* AND THE SKIES ARE
NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY. *

1369
01:07:38,691 --> 01:07:40,858
Depp:
"YOU HAD TO GET SUBJECTIVE
TO SEE NIXON CLEARLY.

1370
01:07:40,858 --> 01:07:43,892
HE WAS SO CROOKED
THAT HE NEEDED SERVANTS

1371
01:07:43,892 --> 01:07:47,359
TO HELP HIM SCREW
ON HIS PANTS EVERY MORNING."

1372
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,825
I AM FILLING WITH
HATE AND RAGE RIGHT NOW
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

1373
01:07:55,459 --> 01:07:58,392
Gary Hart:
I HAD NEVER TRIED
TO PSYCHOANALYZE HUNTER

1374
01:07:58,392 --> 01:07:59,825
IN MOOD SWINGS
AND SO ON,

1375
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,892
BUT I THINK
IN HIS BAD MOMENTS
OR WORSE MOMENTS

1376
01:08:02,892 --> 01:08:05,159
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
ALL FEAR AND LOATHING.

1377
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:08,092
Crouse:
"FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS"

1378
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:11,325
IS OSTENSIBLY
ABOUT A MAN IN SEARCH

1379
01:08:11,325 --> 01:08:13,159
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.

1380
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:15,892
AND "FEAR AND LOATHING:
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL"

1381
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:20,092
IS ABOUT A MAN IN SEARCH
OF AN HONEST POLITICIAN.

1382
01:08:20,092 --> 01:08:24,058
AND THE ONLY ONE IN SIGHT
WHO EVEN VAGUELY QUALIFIED

1383
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,526
- WAS GEORGE McGOVERN.
- WHEN YOU SUPPORT
GEORGE McGOVERN--

1384
01:08:27,526 --> 01:08:30,459
AT THE POSITION
I AM IN THE POLLS,

1385
01:08:30,459 --> 01:08:32,559
THAT'S AN ACT OF COURAGE.

1386
01:08:32,559 --> 01:08:35,292
Depp:
"GEORGE McGOVERN--
THE ONLY CANDIDATE

1387
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:37,025
IN EITHER PARTY
WORTH VOTING FOR

1388
01:08:37,025 --> 01:08:38,626
IS HUNG
IN A FRUSTRATED LIMBO

1389
01:08:38,626 --> 01:08:40,359
CREATED MAINLY
BY THE GROSS CYNICISM

1390
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:41,858
OF THE WASHINGTON
PRESS CORPS.

1391
01:08:41,858 --> 01:08:44,791
'HE'D BE A FINE PRESIDENT,'
THEY SAY,

1392
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,892
'BUT OF COURSE
HE CAN'T POSSIBLY WIN.'

1393
01:08:46,892 --> 01:08:49,526
- WHY NOT?"
- I JUST WANTED
TO SAY HELLO.

1394
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,858
I'M SENATOR McGOVERN, FOLKS.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

1395
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:54,691
YES, YOU TOO.

1396
01:08:54,691 --> 01:08:57,325
YOU FELLAS KNOW
I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?

1397
01:08:57,325 --> 01:08:59,159
I HOPE YOU'LL HELP ME OUT.

McGOVERN'S PROGRAM WAS

1400
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:08,958
IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL
FROM VIETNAM...

1401
01:09:11,825 --> 01:09:13,858
McGovern:
EVEN IF WE STAYED THERE

1402
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,459
AND BOMBED
FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

1403
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:19,325
AND AMERICANS
CONTINUE TO DIE,
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW

1404
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,192
WE'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT
WHERE WE ARE NOW.

1405
01:09:21,192 --> 01:09:23,492
SO LET'S RECOGNIZE
THAT WE MADE A MISTAKE.

1406
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,559
LET'S BRING
THIS WAR TO AN END.

1407
01:09:25,559 --> 01:09:29,159
...AMNESTY FOR DRAFT DODGERS
AND DESERTERS,

1408
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:30,791
EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN

1409
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:36,058
AND-- AND A CUT
IN THE DEFENSE BUDGET.

1410
01:09:36,058 --> 01:09:38,459
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

1411
01:09:43,592 --> 01:09:47,992
McGovern:
THE TRANSCENDENT ISSUE
OF '72 WAS VIETNAM,

1412
01:09:47,992 --> 01:09:50,892
AND I DESPERATELY WANTED
TO WIN THAT ELECTION

1413
01:09:50,892 --> 01:09:54,125
TO PUT AN END
TO THAT SENSELESS WAR.

1414
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:58,658
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF OLD MEN SITTING AROUND

1415
01:09:58,658 --> 01:10:01,392
IN AIR-CONDITIONED ROOMS
HERE IN WASHINGTON

1416
01:10:01,392 --> 01:10:06,092
DREAMING UP WARS
FOR YOUNG MEN TO DIE IN.

1417
01:10:06,092 --> 01:10:08,992
McGovern:
IT IS A TIDE
THAT WOULD SWEEP AWAY

1418
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:10,992
THE BARBARISM OF WAR

1419
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:14,159
AND END THE FOLLY
OF VIETNAM ONCE AND FOR ALL.

1420

01:10:15,626 --> 01:10:17,658
Depp:
"McGOVERN IS
THE ONLY MAJOR CANDIDATE

1422
01:10:17,658 --> 01:10:19,758
WHO LINES OUT
THE PAINFUL TRUTH,

1423
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,958
AND HIS REWARD HAS BEEN
JUST ABOUT THE SAME

1424
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:25,192
AS THAT OF ANY OTHER
POLITICIAN WHO INSISTS
ON TELLING THE TRUTH:

1425
01:10:25,192 --> 01:10:27,492
HE IS MOCKED, VILIFIED,

1426
01:10:27,492 --> 01:10:30,892
IGNORED AND ABANDONED
AS A HOPELESS LOSER."

1427

THE PRESIDENT
IS ATTACKING...

1428
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:35,992
Hart:
HUNTER NEVER TRUSTED
ANYBODY WHO WAS ELECTED.

1429
01:10:38,058 --> 01:10:39,992
THAT WAS THE IRONY,

1430
01:10:39,992 --> 01:10:44,592
BECAUSE TO BE ESTIMABLE
IN HIS JUDGMENT

1431
01:10:44,592 --> 01:10:47,092
YOU HAD TO BE
A LOSER, IN EFFECT.

1432
01:10:47,092 --> 01:10:48,691
A NOBLE LOSER.

1433
01:10:52,058 --> 01:10:54,192
Brinkley:
WHAT WAS BOLD
ABOUT HUNTER WITH McGOVERN

1434
01:10:54,192 --> 01:10:55,958
IS HE WASN'T
BEING OBJECTIVE.

1435
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:58,492
HE WAS SAYING
"THIS IS THE GUY I WANT
TO SEE AS PRESIDENT.

1436
01:10:58,492 --> 01:11:00,092
I'M GONNA TRY TO HELP
MAKE HIM PRESIDENT."

McGovern:
LEAVING OUT GEORGE WALLACE,
WHO WAS SHOT,

1439
01:11:07,492 --> 01:11:10,658
THE TWO STRONGEST
DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS

1440
01:11:10,658 --> 01:11:12,459
WERE MUSKIE AND HUMPHREY.

1441
01:11:12,459 --> 01:11:15,159
THEREFORE,
HUNTER SAW THEM

1442
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:18,025
AS A THREAT
TO BE UNMASKED,

1443
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:22,626
BECAUSE BY THEN I THINK
HE WAS PRETTY STRONGLY
COMMITTED TO ME.

1444
01:11:24,459 --> 01:11:28,825
Crouse:
HUNTER'S PIECES WERE
A VERY PARTICULAR HYBRID

1445
01:11:28,825 --> 01:11:31,691
OF VERY CLEAR-MINDED,

1446
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:34,025
ACCURATE
STRAIGHT REPORTAGE

1447
01:11:34,025 --> 01:11:37,758
AND THEN SOMETIMES
FLAT-OUT FANTASY.

1448
01:11:37,758 --> 01:11:40,025
IT WAS ALL RUN TOGETHER,

1449
01:11:40,025 --> 01:11:43,758
AND SOME PEOPLE
FOUND IT HARD

1450
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:47,092
TO TELL THE FANTASY
FROM THE OTHER STUFF.

1451
01:11:47,092 --> 01:11:49,492
IT OCCURRED TO ME
ABOUT HALFWAY DURING
THE CAMPAIGN

1452
01:11:49,492 --> 01:11:52,392
THAT PEOPLE
ACTUALLY BELIEVED

1453
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,691
A LOT OF THE THINGS
I WAS WRITING ABOUT--

1454
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:57,459
MUSKIE EATING
THIS STRANGE BRAZILIAN DRUG.

1455
01:11:57,459 --> 01:12:00,225
HUNTER HAD IT IN FOR MUSKIE

1456
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:02,159
LIKE YOU COULDN'T BELIEVE.

1457
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,192
HUNTER JUST COULD NOT
LAY OFF OF MUSKIE.

1458
01:12:05,192 --> 01:12:08,425
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO ED MUSKIE?

1459
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:11,492
NOTHING.
ED MUSKIE DID IT
TO HIMSELF.

1460
01:12:11,492 --> 01:12:13,159
I JUST HELPED HIM ALONG.

1461
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:19,025
Depp:
"NOT MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN
ABOUT THE IBOGAINE EFFECT

1462
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:21,958
AS A SERIOUS FACTOR
IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN,

1463
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:24,459
BUT TOWARD THE END
OF THE WISCONSIN PRIMARY RACE,

1464
01:12:24,459 --> 01:12:26,459
ABOUT A WEEK
BEFORE THE VOTE,

1465
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:29,559
WORD LEAKED OUT THAT SOME
OF MUSKIE'S TOP ADVISORS

1466
01:12:29,559 --> 01:12:31,025
HAD CALLED IN
A BRAZILIAN DOCTOR

1467
01:12:31,025 --> 01:12:32,559
WHO WAS SAID TO BE
TREATING THE CANDIDATE

1468
01:12:32,559 --> 01:12:34,592
WITH 'SOME KIND OF
STRANGE DRUG.'"

1469
01:12:39,758 --> 01:12:41,825
WHAT WAS THE DRUG
THAT YOU SAID HE WAS ON?

1470
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:44,359
- IBOGAINE.
- IBOGAINE.

1471
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:47,392
Perry:
FIRST WE SAW HIS WORK,
THEN WE HAD TO LOOK IT UP

1472
01:12:47,392 --> 01:12:48,858
AND THEN
WE STARTED WONDERING

1473
01:12:48,858 --> 01:12:50,626
WHETHER SOMEBODY
COULD SUE US ABOUT THIS.

1474
01:12:50,626 --> 01:12:53,125
THEN WE REALIZED
HOW SILLY THAT WOULD BE,

1475
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:54,925
SO WE WENT AHEAD WITH IT.

1476
01:12:54,925 --> 01:12:57,058
Caddell:
"ROLLING STONE" REPORTS

1477
01:12:57,058 --> 01:12:59,459
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE EDMUND MUSKIE

1478
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:02,292
IS IN FACT ADDICTED.
IT ENDED UP ON THE WIRES
AS A STRAIGHT STORY.

1479
01:13:02,292 --> 01:13:04,259
IT CAUSED
A MAJOR SENSATION.

1480
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,858
IT WAS JUST THIS MAGICAL
LYRICAL MOMENT OF HUNTER'S.

1481
01:13:06,858 --> 01:13:08,958
Depp:
"IT HAD BEEN COMMON KNOWLEDGE
FOR MANY WEEKS

1482
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:12,626
THAT HUMPHREY WAS
USING AN EXOTIC BRAND
OF SPEED KNOWN AS 'WALLOT.'

1483
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:13,992
AND IT HAD
LONG BEEN WHISPERED

1484
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:16,159
THAT MUSKIE WAS
INTO SOMETHING VERY HEAVY,

1485
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,292
BUT IT WAS HARD TO TAKE
THE TALK SERIOUSLY UNTIL
I HEARD ABOUT THE APPEARANCE

1486
01:13:19,292 --> 01:13:22,359
OF A MYSTERIOUS
BRAZILIAN DOCTOR.
THAT WAS THE KEY."

1487
01:13:23,592 --> 01:13:25,526
( all speaking
Portuguese )

1488
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:47,425
BY ATTACKING ME,
HE'S PROVED HIMSELF
TO BE A GUTLESS COWARD.

1489
01:13:47,425 --> 01:13:49,791
Depp:
"I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED
THE IBOGAINE EFFECT

1490
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,392
FROM MUSKIE'S
TEARFUL BREAKDOWN

1491
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:53,425
ON THE FLATBED TRUCK
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE..."

1492
01:13:55,092 --> 01:13:57,092
Perry: HE SAID,
"WELL, LOOK AT THE WAY

1493
01:13:57,092 --> 01:13:58,492
THE GUY GIVES
HIS SPEECHES.

1494
01:13:58,492 --> 01:14:00,958
IT EXACTLY FITS
THE SYMPTOMS

1495
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:03,791
OF SOMEBODY
WHO'S STONED ON IBOGAINE."

1496
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:07,092
AND THE CHARGE WAS
SO BIZARRE, SO OFF-THE-WALL,

1497
01:14:07,092 --> 01:14:09,092
IT REALLY BROUGHT
A LOT OF ATTENTION
TO HUNTER'S REPORTING.

1498
01:14:09,092 --> 01:14:11,526
DO YOU MIND
IF I STATE MY VIEW?

1499
01:14:11,526 --> 01:14:13,058
Depp:
"...TO THE DELUSIONS
AND ALTERED THINKING

1500
01:14:13,058 --> 01:14:15,025
THAT CHARACTERIZED
HIS CAMPAIGN IN WISCONSIN,

1501
01:14:15,025 --> 01:14:17,626
AND FINALLY THE CONDITION
OF 'TOTAL RAGE'

1502
01:14:17,626 --> 01:14:19,658
THAT GRIPPED HIM
IN FLORIDA."

1503
01:14:19,658 --> 01:14:23,392
BUT I AM SPEAKING
TO THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE
WILLING TO LISTEN TO ME!

1504
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,592
Man:
THE RUMOR BEGAN
TO SPREAD EVERYWHERE

1505
01:14:25,592 --> 01:14:28,058
AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO WERE COVERING
THE CAMPAIGN

1506
01:14:28,058 --> 01:14:30,725
THAT MUSKIE WAS IN FACT
ON THIS BIZARRE DRUG.

1507
01:14:30,725 --> 01:14:33,325
- YOU FINALLY SAID
YOU MADE IT ALL UP.
- I HAD TO.

1508
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:36,658
I COULDN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE
TOOK THIS STUFF SERIOUSLY.

1509
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:39,292
PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVED THAT
MUSKIE WAS EATING IBOGAINE.

1510
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:43,725
I NEVER SAID HE WAS.
I SAID THERE WAS A RUMOR
IN MILWAUKEE THAT HE WAS...

1511
01:14:43,725 --> 01:14:45,791
WHICH WAS TRUE.
I STARTED THE RUMOR
IN MILWAUKEE.

1512
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:48,492
- ( audience laughing )
- YEAH, IF YOU'RE
REALLY CAREFUL--

1513
01:14:48,492 --> 01:14:50,159
I'M A VERY ACCURATE
JOURNALIST.

1514
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:56,892
Depp:
"MUSKIE'S ALWAYS
TAKEN PRIDE

1515
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,791
IN HIS ABILITY
TO DEAL WITH HECKLERS.

1516
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:00,526
HE'S FREQUENTLY
CHALLENGED THEM,

1517
01:15:00,526 --> 01:15:02,691
CALLING THEM UP TO THE STAGE
IN FRONT OF BIG CROWDS

1518
01:15:02,691 --> 01:15:06,259
AND THE FORCING THE POOR
BASTARDS TO DEBATE WITH HIM
IN A BLAZE OF TV LIGHTS.

1519
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:08,992
BUT THERE WAS NONE
OF THAT IN FLORIDA.

1520
01:15:08,992 --> 01:15:11,425
WHEN THE BOOHOO BEGAN
GRABBING AT HIS LEGS

1521
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:13,159
AND SCREAMING
FOR MORE GIN,

1522
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:14,925
BIG ED WENT
ALL TO PIECES,

1523
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:17,592
WHICH GAVE RISE
TO SPECULATION
AMONG REPORTERS

1524
01:15:17,592 --> 01:15:20,292
FAMILIAR WITH
HIS CAMPAIGN STYLE
IN '68 AND '70

1525
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,425
THAT MUSKIE
WAS NOT HIMSELF."

1526
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:25,725
...SHREDDED, TORN,
BATTERED AND BEATEN

1527
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:27,725
BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION.

1528
01:15:27,725 --> 01:15:29,259
Depp:
"IN RETROSPECT, HOWEVER,

1529
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:31,359
IT IS EASY TO SEE
WHY MUSKIE FELL APART

1530
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,892
ON THAT CABOOSE PLATFORM
IN THE MIAMI TRAIN STATION.

1531
01:15:33,892 --> 01:15:35,725
IT IS ENTIRELY CONCEIVABLE,

1532
01:15:35,725 --> 01:15:37,325
GIVEN THE KNOWN EFFECTS
OF IBOGAINE,

1533
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:39,658
THAT MUSKIE'S BRAIN WAS
ALMOST PARALYZED

1534
01:15:39,658 --> 01:15:41,325
BY HALLUCINATIONS
AT THE TIME,

1535
01:15:41,325 --> 01:15:43,325
THAT HE LOOKED OUT
AT THE CROWD

1536
01:15:43,325 --> 01:15:45,425
AND SAW GILA MONSTERS
INSTEAD OF PEOPLE.

1537
01:15:47,259 --> 01:15:49,259
THAT HIS MIND
SNAPPED COMPLETELY

1538
01:15:49,259 --> 01:15:51,825
WHEN HE FELT SOMETHING LARGE
AND APPARENTLY VICIOUS

1539
01:15:51,825 --> 01:15:53,992
CLAWING AT HIS LEGS."

1540
01:15:56,526 --> 01:15:58,592
THAT'S CRAZY STUFF.

1541
01:15:58,592 --> 01:15:59,992
NOBODY WAS
WRITING LIKE THAT.

1542
01:15:59,992 --> 01:16:02,992
I MEAN, IN THE SERIOUS WORLD
OF POLITICAL JOURNALISM

1543
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:04,992
THEY THOUGHT
THAT WAY OF HUNTER,

1544
01:16:04,992 --> 01:16:08,092
THAT HE WAS
GETTING AWAY WITH STUFF

1545
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:11,259
THAT THEY COULDN'T
IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

1546
01:16:11,259 --> 01:16:12,658
AND THEY ALL LIVED
VICARIOUSLY THROUGH HIM.

1547
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:15,825
Crouse:
THE SOCIAL SCENE
OF THE PRESS--

1548
01:16:15,825 --> 01:16:19,125
IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS
ALMOST ALL MALES

1549
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:23,092
AND THEY ALMOST
ALL DRANK PRETTY SERIOUSLY.

1550
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:26,992
AND HUNTER, HE WAS
KIND OF IMPERVIOUS MAN

1551
01:16:26,992 --> 01:16:30,892
WHEN IT CAME
TO DRUGS AND TO LIQUOR.

1552
01:16:30,892 --> 01:16:33,359
YOU SAW
THAT STUFF GO IN

1553
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:36,292
AND THERE WAS
NO DISCERNABLE EFFECT

1554
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,392
IN HIS BEHAVIOR.

1555
01:16:38,392 --> 01:16:41,125
AND THAT LEFT
AN IMPRESSION

1556
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:42,825
ON THE PEOPLE
HE WAS WITH.

1557
01:16:44,626 --> 01:16:47,192
HUNTER COULDN'T
RESIST, EVER,

1558
01:16:47,192 --> 01:16:48,858
TRYING TO SHOCK
THE SQUARES.

1559
01:16:48,858 --> 01:16:50,791
HUNTER WOULD TURN
TO ME AND SAY,

1560
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:53,592
"MAYBE AT THE NEXT STOP
WE CAN SHOOT UP,"

1561
01:16:53,592 --> 01:16:56,225
OR "HEY, IF THEY HAVE
A MEN'S ROOM,

1562
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:58,758
IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO EAT SOME ACID."

1563
01:16:58,758 --> 01:17:01,325
AND HUNTER,
IN THIS SENSE,

1564
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:05,592
ALMOST HAD
THE ATTRIBUTES
OF AN ACTION HERO.

1565
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:15,758
McGovern:
I GOT A CALL FROM HUNTER.

1566
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:18,425
HE INVITED ELEANOR AND ME
TO MEET HIM FOR DINNER.

1567
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:22,192
WHEN WE GOT THERE,
THE WAITRESS MATERIALIZED

1568
01:17:22,192 --> 01:17:26,225
AND HE SAID,
"BRING ME THREE MARGARITAS

1569
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:29,626
AND SIX BEERS,"

1570
01:17:29,626 --> 01:17:31,192
AND THE GIRL LAUGHED.

1571
01:17:31,192 --> 01:17:35,225
SHE SAID, "ARE YOU EXPECTING
SOME OTHER PEOPLE, SIR?"

1572
01:17:35,225 --> 01:17:39,425
HE SAID, "NO. FIND OUT
WHAT THESE TWO FOLKS WANT,

1573
01:17:39,425 --> 01:17:41,958
BUT BRING ME
THREE MARGARITAS

1574
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,259
AND SIX BEERS."
( laughs )

1575
01:17:46,592 --> 01:17:49,691
Hart:
I DON'T THINK HUNTER EVER
THOUGHT McGOVERN WAS GONNA WIN.

1576
01:17:49,691 --> 01:17:52,159
I THINK HE WAS ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.

1577
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:54,359
THIS THING PICKS UP
SPEED FAST, DOESN'T IT?

1578
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:57,626
Man:
OH YEAH,
SO IS YOUR CAMPAIGN.

1579
01:17:57,626 --> 01:17:59,292
Hart:
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

1580
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:01,658
THIS THING BEGINS
TO BE SERIOUS.

1581
01:18:01,658 --> 01:18:03,125
Man:
OF THE SIX
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES,

1582
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,192
WHICH ONE ARE
YOU SUPPORTING
IN THE PRIMARY?

1583
01:18:05,192 --> 01:18:07,025
- McGOVERN?
- WHY?

1584
01:18:07,025 --> 01:18:11,359
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
HE'S THE ONLY MAN THAT
CAN UNITE THE COUNTRY.

1585
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:13,592
- GEORGE McGOVERN.
- Man: WHY?

1586
01:18:13,592 --> 01:18:15,925
BECAUSE I THINK
HE'S THE PEOPLE'S MAN.

1587
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:18,359
UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

1588
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:20,925
- Man: WALLACE?
- NO NO NO. NO.

1589
01:18:20,925 --> 01:18:22,325
- LINDSAY?
- NO.

1590
01:18:22,325 --> 01:18:23,892
- HUMPHREY?
- NO.

1591
01:18:23,892 --> 01:18:25,626
- MUSKIE?
- NO.

1592
01:18:25,626 --> 01:18:27,825
- McGOVERN?
- YES, YOU'VE GOT IT
RIGHT THERE.

1593
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:30,159
I THINK YOU'RE COMING
ON GOOD TO LABOR PEOPLE.

1594
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,892
- YEAH.
- Hart: I THINK
HUNTER REALIZED

1595
01:18:32,892 --> 01:18:35,858
THAT THE MAN
HE WAS FOLLOWING MIGHT
ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE.

1596
01:18:35,858 --> 01:18:40,425
Man:
MUSKIE, JACKSON,
LINDSAY TRAIL BADLY.

1597
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:42,825
WHAT THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

1598
01:18:42,825 --> 01:18:44,626
WE WON BY A LANDSLIDE.

1599
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:46,459
THE PRESS COVERAGE IS
UNBELIEVABLE.

1600
01:18:46,459 --> 01:18:47,858
HE'S GONNA BE
ON THE COVER OF "NEWSWEEK,"

1601
01:18:47,858 --> 01:18:49,791
PROBABLY THE COVER
OF "TIME,"

1602
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,225
AND THEY'RE CALLING HIM
THE FRONTRUNNER

1603
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:52,658
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINATION.

1604
01:18:52,658 --> 01:18:54,025
NOW WE'VE GOT TO WORRY.

1605
01:18:54,025 --> 01:18:56,958
( cheering )

1606
01:19:02,858 --> 01:19:04,725
Man:
Senator George McGovern,

1607
01:19:04,725 --> 01:19:06,526
having received
the majority vote

1608
01:19:06,526 --> 01:19:08,492
of this convention
of certified delegates,

1609
01:19:08,492 --> 01:19:10,758
is hereby declared

1610
01:19:10,758 --> 01:19:13,325
the 1972 Democratic nominee

1611
01:19:13,325 --> 01:19:15,559
for President
of the United States.

1612
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:22,359
Depp:
"McGOVERN APPEARED
TO HAVE A SURE LOCK

1613
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:23,925
ON THE WHITE HOUSE
WHEN THE SUN CAME UP

1614
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:27,992
ON MIAMI BEACH ON THE MORNING
OF THURSDAY, JULY 13TH.

1615
01:19:27,992 --> 01:19:30,492
SINCE THEN HE HAS
CRIPPLED HIMSELF

1616
01:19:30,492 --> 01:19:33,459
WITH A SERIES OF ALMOST
UNBELIEVABLE BLUNDERS."

1617
01:19:35,592 --> 01:19:37,425
Hart:
THE POLLS GOING
INTO THAT WEEKEND

1618
01:19:37,425 --> 01:19:39,125
SHOWED McGOVERN
WITH A CHANCE TO WIN.

1619
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:41,092
NOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO DEFEAT AN INCUMBENT,

1620
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:43,159
PARTICULARLY AT WAR TIME,

1621
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:45,459
SO YOU HAD TO HAVE
EVERYTHING GO RIGHT.

1622
01:19:45,459 --> 01:19:47,758
YOU COULD NOT HAVE
ONE THING GO WRONG.

1623
01:19:47,758 --> 01:19:51,225
AND OF COURSE
WE HAD A HUGE MAJOR THING
GO WRONG WITHIN HOURS.

1624
01:19:51,225 --> 01:19:53,758
THERE WAS THIS DISASTER

1625
01:19:53,758 --> 01:19:56,359
WITH THE CHOICE
FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT--

1626
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:58,992
THOMAS EAGLETON,
SENATOR FROM MISSOURI.

1627
01:19:58,992 --> 01:20:01,359
Frank Mankiewicz:
HE MEETS THE MAIN REQUIREMENTS

1628
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:04,159
SENATOR McGOVERN
SET DOWN WHEN HE BEGAN
HIS CONSIDERATION,

1629
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,092
WHICH IS A MAN
IN WHOM HE WOULD HAVE

1630
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:08,125
ABSOLUTE
AND COMPLETE CONFIDENCE

1631
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:10,725
AND IN WHOM HE BELIEVES
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE

1632
01:20:10,725 --> 01:20:13,658
TO BECOME PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD
AN OCCASION ARISE.

1633
01:20:13,658 --> 01:20:15,658
I THINK IT WAS
MANKIEWICZ WHO ASKED HIM

1634
01:20:15,658 --> 01:20:18,791
IF HE HAD ANY SKELETONS
IN HIS CLOSET AND HE SAID NO.

1635
01:20:20,725 --> 01:20:23,259
TOM SAID HE COULDN'T
THINK OF ANYTHING

1636
01:20:23,259 --> 01:20:25,725
AND THEN THE CLOCK
STARTED TO TICK.

1637
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:32,025
Hart:
THE WEEKEND AFTER
THE CONVENTION IN MIAMI

1638
01:20:32,025 --> 01:20:35,025
WE HAD GOTTEN
AN ANONYMOUS CALL
AT HEADQUARTERS

1639
01:20:35,025 --> 01:20:38,058
SAYING THAT
SENATOR EAGLETON HAD HAD...

1640
01:20:38,058 --> 01:20:41,858
SHOCK THERAPY,
WHICH WE HAD NOT KNOWN.

1641
01:20:41,858 --> 01:20:47,192
- ( speaking indistinctly )
- * WELL, I THINK I'M GOING
OUT OF MY HEAD *

1642
01:20:47,192 --> 01:20:51,626
* YES, I THINK
I'M GOING OUT OF MY HEAD *

1643
01:20:51,626 --> 01:20:55,159
* OVER YOU...

1644
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:57,526
ON THREE OCCASIONS
IN MY LIFE,

1645
01:20:57,526 --> 01:21:00,425
I HAVE VOLUNTARILY GONE
INTO HOSPITALS

1646
01:21:00,425 --> 01:21:03,758
AS A RESULT
OF NERVOUS EXHAUSTION
AND FATIGUE.

1647
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:06,092
Buchanan: I'D BEEN
IN ST. LOUIS. I'D HEARD
ABOUT THE EAGLETON STUFF,

1648
01:21:06,092 --> 01:21:07,825
EVEN BEFORE--
WHEN THEY NOMINATED HIM.

1649
01:21:07,825 --> 01:21:09,958
IT WOULD SURPRISE ME
WHEN THEY NOMINATED HIM.

1650
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:12,691
WHEN THAT HIT,
THAT WAS THE COUP DE GRACE.

1651
01:21:12,691 --> 01:21:14,691
I WAS IN NIXON'S OFFICE

1652
01:21:14,691 --> 01:21:17,791
AND THERE WAS
WHAT I WOULD SAY WAS
CONSIDERABLE MERRIMENT.

1653
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:20,425
NIXON SAID,
"WELL, PAT TOLD US,
DIDN'T HE, CHUCK?"

1654
01:21:25,392 --> 01:21:28,392
Depp:
"TOM EAGLETON WAS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF VP CANDIDATE

1655
01:21:28,392 --> 01:21:30,559
THAT MUSKIE OR HUMPHREY
WOULD HAVE CHOSEN--

1656
01:21:30,559 --> 01:21:32,758
A PEACE OFFERING
TO THE OLD POLITICS GANG,

1657
01:21:32,758 --> 01:21:34,225
BECAUSE McGOVERN
THOUGHT HE NEEDED

1658
01:21:34,225 --> 01:21:35,892
THOSE BASTARDS
TO BEAT NIXON."

1659
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:39,459
IS IT YOUR INTENTION
THEN TO REMAIN
ON THE TICKET?

1660
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:42,425
- CATEGORICALLY, YES.
- Depp: "IT'S HARD TO SEE

1661
01:21:42,425 --> 01:21:43,858
HOW GEORGE COULD HAVE
DONE ANY WORSE,

1662
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:46,658
EVEN WITH CHARLES MANSON
FOR A RUNNING MATE."

1663
01:21:46,658 --> 01:21:50,425
Hart:
ALL OF A SUDDEN, HUNTER JUMPS
ON THAT CRITICAL BANDWAGON.

1664
01:21:50,425 --> 01:21:53,658
HIS WHOLE CRITIQUE OF McGOVERN
IN THE FALL CAMPAIGN WAS

1665
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:56,492
"SELLOUT, COMPROMISER."

1666
01:21:56,492 --> 01:21:58,925
BUT YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS
ABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS

1667
01:21:58,925 --> 01:22:01,259
AND BE INFANTILE ABOUT IT.

1668
01:22:01,259 --> 01:22:03,492
AND THERE WAS
AN INFANTILE--

1669
01:22:03,492 --> 01:22:07,359
I SAY THIS
WITH ALL RESPECT
TO MY LATE FRIEND--

1670
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:09,425
AN INFANTILE ASPECT
TO HUNTER.

1671
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,225
HE WANTED
IT ALL TO BE FUN,

1672
01:22:11,225 --> 01:22:14,691
ALL TO BE AMUSING,
ALL TO BE GOOD AND EVIL,

1673
01:22:14,691 --> 01:22:17,159
AND "WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS,
THEY'RE THE BAD GUYS

1674
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:18,825
AND WE'RE GONNA
CRUSH 'EM,"

1675
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:20,425
AND OVERDRAMATIZING

1676
01:22:20,425 --> 01:22:23,526
WHAT IS REALLY SOME
OF THE TOUGHEST THINGS

1677
01:22:23,526 --> 01:22:25,192
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE TO DO,

1678
01:22:25,192 --> 01:22:27,125
AND THAT IS TO TRY
TO GOVERN A DEMOCRACY.

1679
01:22:28,858 --> 01:22:31,825
McGovern:
THE PUBLIC DEBATE
OF SENATOR EAGLETON'S

1680
01:22:31,825 --> 01:22:33,526
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

1681
01:22:33,526 --> 01:22:35,992
CONTINUES
TO DIVERT ATTENTION

1682
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,925
FROM THE GREAT
NATIONAL ISSUES

1683
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:40,325
THAT NEED
TO BE DISCUSSED.

1684
01:22:40,325 --> 01:22:43,459
THEREFORE WE HAVE
JOINTLY AGREED

1685
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:46,292
THAT THE BEST COURSE IS
FOR SENATOR EAGLETON

1686
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:48,259
- TO STEP ASIDE.
- ( applause )

1687
01:22:48,259 --> 01:22:49,958
Crouse:
WHEN McGOVERN FINALLY
HAD TO GIVE IN,

1688
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:53,292
IT MADE McGOVERN
LOOK LIKE A LIAR,

1689
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:54,758
IT MADE HIM LOOK
LIKE A WAFFLER.

1690
01:22:54,758 --> 01:22:57,259
IT WAS A BLOW
FROM WHICH THE CAMPAIGN

1691
01:22:57,259 --> 01:22:58,758
NEVER REALLY COVERED.

1692
01:22:58,758 --> 01:23:00,825
WISH I WORE
MY DRIP-DRY SUIT.

1693
01:23:00,825 --> 01:23:04,825
McGovern:
THE NATIONAL PRESS WASN'T
VERY RESPONSIBLE AT THAT TIME.

1694
01:23:04,825 --> 01:23:07,125
I DON'T CONDEMN
THE PRESS.

1695
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,225
THEY WERE DOING WHAT
THEY THOUGHT WAS RIGHT,

1696
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:12,492
BUT THEY SPENT FAR MORE INK

1697
01:23:12,492 --> 01:23:15,626
DWELLING
ON MY MISHANDLING

1698
01:23:15,626 --> 01:23:17,858
OF THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL
SELECTION

1699
01:23:17,858 --> 01:23:22,058
THAN WAS EVER DEVOTED
TO THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN

1700
01:23:22,058 --> 01:23:25,092
ON THE PART
OF THE NIXON PEOPLE
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

1701
01:23:25,092 --> 01:23:26,925
IT WAS HARD TO GET
THEM INTERESTED IN THAT.

1702
01:23:30,392 --> 01:23:32,958
Depp:
"AT THE STROKE
OF MIDNIGHT IN WASHINGTON

1703
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:36,459
A DROOLING RED-EYED BEAST
WITH THE LEGS OF A MAN

1704
01:23:36,459 --> 01:23:38,359
AND THE HEAD
OF A GIANT HYENA

1705
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:40,626
CRAWLS OUT
OF ITS BEDROOM WINDOW

1706
01:23:40,626 --> 01:23:42,492
IN THE SOUTH WING
OF THE WHITE HOUSE

1707
01:23:42,492 --> 01:23:45,359
AND LEAPS 50'
DOWN TO THE LAWN,

1708
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:48,292
PAUSES BRIEFLY TO STRANGLE
THE CHOW WATCHDOG,

1709
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:50,958
THEN RACES OFF
INTO THE DARKNESS

1710
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:54,192
TOWARDS THE WATERGATE,
SNARLING WITH LUST,

1711
01:23:54,192 --> 01:23:57,359
LOPING THROUGH THE ALLEYS
BEHIND PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE

1712
01:23:57,359 --> 01:23:58,791
AND TRYING DESPERATELY
TO REMEMBER

1713
01:23:58,791 --> 01:24:01,225
WHICH ONE OF THOSE
400 IDENTICAL BALCONIES

1714
01:24:01,225 --> 01:24:04,425
IS THE ONE OUTSIDE
MARTHA MITCHELL'S APARTMENT."

"DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES
BEYOND MY CONTROL,

NOT WRITE ANYTHING

PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
AT THIS TIME.

1719

ON TUESDAY,
NOVEMBER 7TH,

1720
01:24:21,492 --> 01:24:23,691
I WILL GET OUT
OF BED LONG ENOUGH

1721
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:25,392
TO GO DOWN
TO THE POLLING PLACE

1722
01:24:25,392 --> 01:24:27,958
AND VOTE
FOR GEORGE McGOVERN.

1723
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:31,825
AFTERWARDS, I WILL
DRIVE BACK TO THE HOUSE,

1724
01:24:31,825 --> 01:24:35,058
LOCK THE FRONT DOOR,
GET BACK IN BED

1725
01:24:35,058 --> 01:24:38,492
AND WATCH TELEVISION
AS LONG AS NECESSARY.

1726
01:24:38,492 --> 01:24:42,492
IT WILL PROBABLY
BE A WHILE BEFORE
THE ANGST LIFTS.

1727

BUT WHENEVER IT HAPPENS,

1728
01:24:44,892 --> 01:24:47,225
I WILL GET OUT
OF BED AGAIN

1729
01:24:47,225 --> 01:24:51,259
AND START WRITING THE MEAN,
COLD-BLOODED BUMMER

1730

THAT I WAS NOT
QUITE READY FOR TODAY."

HE WAS THE RIGHT MAN
IN THE RIGHT PLACE

1732
01:24:59,492 --> 01:25:01,858

TO CAPTURE

1733
01:25:01,858 --> 01:25:03,892
A CERTAIN MOMENT
IN HISTORY

1734
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:06,392
AS NOBODY ELSE WAS
EQUIPPED TO DO.

1735
01:25:11,058 --> 01:25:13,259
IN HIS BEST PAGES,

1736
01:25:13,259 --> 01:25:15,592
I THINK HE CAPTURED
CERTAIN TRUTHS

1737
01:25:15,592 --> 01:25:17,025
ABOUT HUMAN PERVERSITY

1738
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:19,958
THAT WILL NEVER LOSE
THEIR STING.

1739
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:26,459
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT ANYBODY CAN BE
TOO SURPRISED

1740
01:25:26,459 --> 01:25:29,992
THAT WE FIND OURSELVES
IN THE NIGHTMARE
WE'RE IN TODAY

1741
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:32,125
BECAUSE IT'S
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

1742
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:34,992
AS THE NIGHTMARE
HE DESCRIBED BACK THEN.

1743
01:25:34,992 --> 01:25:37,559
AND I THINK
IT WILL ALWAYS BE SALUBRIOUS

1744
01:25:37,559 --> 01:25:42,225
AND CLEANSING
TO HAVE SOMEONE EXPRESS

1745
01:25:42,225 --> 01:25:44,259
THE MOCKERY
AND THE RAGE

1746
01:25:44,259 --> 01:25:46,459

1747
01:25:46,459 --> 01:25:49,825
THAT ARE THE ONLY REACTION

1748
01:25:49,825 --> 01:25:52,758

Massachusetts has gone

We project that
President Nixon

1753

will come out
of this the winner.

1754
01:26:17,259 --> 01:26:27,000

And somewhere between 450-500 or more election votes.

I've never known
a national election

THAT WE ARE
REALLY JUST A NATION

1763
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:50,092
OF 220 MILLION
USED-CAR SALESMEN

1764
01:26:50,092 --> 01:26:51,958
WITH ALL THE MONEY
WE NEED TO BUY GUNS

1765
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:54,925
AND NO QUALMS
AT ALL ABOUT KILLING
ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD

1766
01:26:54,925 --> 01:26:56,725
WHO TRIES TO MAKE US
UNCOMFORTABLE."

1767
01:26:59,559 --> 01:27:01,992
McGovern:
NEVER AGAIN WILL WE SEND

1768
01:27:01,992 --> 01:27:04,392
THE PRECIOUS YOUNG BLOOD
OF THIS COUNTRY

1769
01:27:04,392 --> 01:27:06,259
TO DIE TRYING
TO PROP UP

1770
01:27:06,259 --> 01:27:09,526
A CORRUPT MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP ABROAD.

1771
01:27:09,526 --> 01:27:11,526
( crowd cheers )

1772
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:14,259
"THE TRAGEDY OF ALL THIS IS
THAT GEORGE McGOVERN,

1773
01:27:14,259 --> 01:27:15,958
FOR ALL HIS MISTAKES

1774
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:20,526
AND ALL HIS IMPRECISE TALK
ABOUT NEW POLITICS

1775
01:27:20,526 --> 01:27:22,092
AND HONESTY
IN GOVERNMENT,

1776
01:27:22,092 --> 01:27:24,992
IS ONE OF THE FEW MEN
WHO WOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT

1777
01:27:24,992 --> 01:27:26,958
OF THE UNITED STATES
IN THIS CENTURY

1778
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:29,892
WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS
WHAT A FANTASTIC MONUMENT

1779
01:27:29,892 --> 01:27:32,025
THIS COUNTRY
MIGHT HAVE BEEN

1780
01:27:32,025 --> 01:27:34,025
IF WE COULD'VE KEPT IT
OUT OF THE HANDS

1781
01:27:34,025 --> 01:27:36,025
OF GREEDY LITTLE HUSTLERS
LIKE RICHARD NIXON."

1782
01:27:36,025 --> 01:27:39,925
* GUESS I'VE GOT
THAT OLD TRAVELING BONE *

1783
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:46,058
* GONNA FEEL
REALLY ALONE... *

1784
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:48,392
...WHETHER OR NOT
THEIR PRESIDENT IS A CROOK.

1785
01:27:48,392 --> 01:27:51,192
WELL, I'M NOT A CROOK.

1786
01:27:51,192 --> 01:27:56,492
* BUT I WON'T-- I WON'T BE
LOSING MY WAY, NO NO... *

1787
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,892
Crouse:
"McGOVERN MADE
SOME STUPID MISTAKES,

1788
01:28:01,892 --> 01:28:04,825
BUT, IN CONTEXT,
THEY SEEM ALMOST FRIVOLOUS

1789
01:28:04,825 --> 01:28:06,992
COMPARED TO THE THINGS
RICHARD NIXON DOES

1790
01:28:06,992 --> 01:28:08,925
EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE
ON PURPOSE

1791
01:28:08,925 --> 01:28:10,858
AS A MATTER OF POLICY

1792
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:13,658
AND A PERFECT EXPRESSION
OF EVERYTHING HE STANDS FOR.

1793
01:28:13,658 --> 01:28:17,758
JESUS, WHERE WILL IT END?
HOW LOW DO YOU HAVE TO STOOP

1794
01:28:17,758 --> 01:28:20,658
IN THIS COUNTRY
TO BE PRESIDENT?"

1795
01:28:20,658 --> 01:28:24,159
* PUT A CANDLE
IN THE WINDOW *

1796
01:28:28,325 --> 01:28:32,392
* THOUGH I'M GOING,
GOING *

1797
01:28:32,392 --> 01:28:34,292
* I'LL BE
COMING HOME SOON *

1798
01:28:36,025 --> 01:28:39,825
* LONG AS I CAN SEE
THE LIGHT... *

1799
01:28:41,325 --> 01:28:42,725
WHEW.

1800
01:28:44,259 --> 01:28:47,058
Wenner:
AS MUCH AS HE WAS
REVILED AND REVULSED

1801
01:28:47,058 --> 01:28:48,725
BY NIXON,
HE IDENTIFIED WITH HIM.

1802
01:28:48,725 --> 01:28:50,725
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT DARKNESS
OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT.

1803
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:53,058
YOU KNOW, HUNTER WAS
DEEPLY INVESTED IN AMERICA.

1804
01:28:53,058 --> 01:28:56,058
WHETHER YOU CALL IT
THE AMERICAN DREAM
OR AMERICAN POLITICS,

1805
01:28:56,058 --> 01:28:57,925
ALL THE THINGS
HE WROTE ABOUT

1806
01:28:57,925 --> 01:29:01,725
WERE ALWAYS
LOOKING AT THE DARK SIDE
AS WELL AS THE HOPE.

1807
01:29:01,725 --> 01:29:04,225
BUT DURING HIS LIFETIME
IT KEPT LOOKING LIKE,

1808
01:29:04,225 --> 01:29:07,526
ONCE AGAIN, THE EVIL,
THE DARKNESS WOULD TRIUMPH.

1809
01:29:09,092 --> 01:29:13,359
Crouse:
IN 1972, HE BEGAN
TO FEEL DISILLUSIONED.

1810
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:15,259
AND WITH JIMMY CARTER,
HE WAS TRYING

1811
01:29:15,259 --> 01:29:17,825
TO GIVE POLITICS
ONE LAST CHANCE.

1812
01:29:17,825 --> 01:29:19,758
( "Georgia on my Mind"
playing )

1813
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,858
Depp:
"I HAVE HEARD
HUNDREDS OF SPEECHES

1814
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:27,159
BY ALL KINDS OF CANDIDATES
AND POLITICIANS,

1815
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:29,725
BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD
A SUSTAINED PIECE

1816
01:29:29,725 --> 01:29:31,992
OF POLITICAL ORATORY
THAT IMPRESSED ME MORE

1817
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:34,359
THAN THE SPEECH
JIMMY CARTER MADE
ON LAW DAY

1818
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:36,192
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF GEORGIA

1819
01:29:36,192 --> 01:29:38,691
ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON
IN MAY, 1974.

1820
01:29:38,691 --> 01:29:42,092
IT WAS A KING HELL BASTARD
OF A SPEECH.

1821
01:29:42,092 --> 01:29:46,691
BY THE TIME IT WAS OVER,
IT HAD RUNG EVERY BELL
IN THE ROOM."

1822
01:29:46,691 --> 01:29:50,192
Carter: Senator Kennedy
and distinguished
fellow Georgians,

1823
01:29:50,192 --> 01:29:51,658
friends of the Law School
of Georgia and--

1824
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:53,092
Hunter: I WAS
THE ONLY REPORTER THERE

1825
01:29:53,092 --> 01:29:55,025
AND I WAS WITH KENNEDY.

1826
01:29:55,025 --> 01:29:57,125
I HAD NO INTEREST
IN CARTER

1827
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,791
AND NO INTENTION
OF EITHER LISTENING TO HIM

1828
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:01,425
OR REPORTING
ANYTHING HE SAID.

1829
01:30:01,425 --> 01:30:03,325
Carter:
NOT PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO ME,

1830
01:30:03,325 --> 01:30:05,125
HE WAS GOING OUTSIDE
EVERY NOW AND THEN

1831
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:08,425
TO REPLENISH
HIS GLASS OF WHAT WAS
APPARENTLY ICE TEA

1832
01:30:08,425 --> 01:30:10,392
BUT WAS REALLY
WILD TURKEY WHISKEY.

1833
01:30:10,392 --> 01:30:13,658
I STARTED SPEAKING
FROM MY HEART

1834
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,958
ABOUT THE DEFECTS

1835
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,758
IN THE AMERICAN
JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

1836
01:30:18,758 --> 01:30:20,691
( Carter speaking )

1837
01:30:35,992 --> 01:30:38,092
Depp:
"BUT WHAT SENT ME
BACK OUT TO THE TRUNK

1838
01:30:38,092 --> 01:30:40,492
TO GET MY TAPE RECORDER
INSTEAD OF ANOTHER DRINK

1839
01:30:40,492 --> 01:30:43,459
WAS THE SPECTACLE
OF A SOUTHERN POLITICIAN

1840
01:30:43,459 --> 01:30:45,492
TELLING A CROWD
OF JUDGES AND LAWYERS

1841
01:30:45,492 --> 01:30:47,559
THAT 'THE SOURCE
OF MY UNDERSTANDING

1842
01:30:47,559 --> 01:30:49,459
ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT
AND WRONG IN THIS SOCIETY

1843
01:30:49,459 --> 01:30:51,259
IS FROM A FRIEND
OF MINE--

1844
01:30:51,259 --> 01:30:54,325
A GREAT POET
NAMED BOB DYLAN.'"

1845
01:30:54,325 --> 01:30:56,259
( Carter speaking )

1846
01:31:06,092 --> 01:31:10,359
* I AIN'T GONNA WORK ON
MAGGIE'S FARM NO MORE... *

1847
01:31:24,526 --> 01:31:26,559
- ( crowd laughs )
- Carter: SHE SAID...

1848
01:31:28,758 --> 01:31:30,892
Hunter:
"AT THIS POINT,
CARTER WAS ATTACKED

1849
01:31:30,892 --> 01:31:34,825
BY WHAT WAS LATER IDENTIFIED
AS A 48 LB SLOPE."

1850
01:31:34,825 --> 01:31:36,758
( Carter speaking )

1851
01:31:42,225 --> 01:31:44,492
Carter:
I WAS SPEAKING
TO A BUNCH OF LAWYERS

1852
01:31:44,492 --> 01:31:46,492
AND THE REACTION
AMONG THEM WAS ONE

1853
01:31:46,492 --> 01:31:49,058
OF STUNNED SILENCE.

1854
01:31:49,058 --> 01:31:51,626
( silence )

1855
01:31:51,626 --> 01:31:53,559
( Carter speaking )

1856
01:32:09,425 --> 01:32:11,092
"...HE WAS GREETED
WITH HORROR.

1857
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:12,425
STILL, ONCE THAT
CHANGE WAS MADE--

1858
01:32:12,425 --> 01:32:14,425
A VERY SIMPLE,
DIFFICULT CHANGE--

1859
01:32:14,425 --> 01:32:16,691
NO ONE IN HIS RIGHT MIND
WOULD WANT TO GO BACK

1860
01:32:16,691 --> 01:32:19,192
TO CIRCUMSTANCES PRIOR
TO THAT JUNCTURE

1861
01:32:19,192 --> 01:32:21,259
IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF OUR NATION'S SOCIETY."

1862
01:32:21,259 --> 01:32:23,058
IT CHANGED MY LIFE.

1863
01:32:23,058 --> 01:32:25,359
OF COURSE, HUNTER IS THE PERSON
THAT FOUND JIMMY CARTER.

1864
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:29,292
HUNTER WOULD GO
AROUND THE COUNTRY
AND PLAY IT FOR PEOPLE.

1865
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:32,459
Brinkley:
HIS COVER STORY
ON "ROLLING STONE"

1866
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:34,626
THAT HUNTER WROTE
ENDORSING CARTER

1867
01:32:34,626 --> 01:32:36,626
HELPED JIMMY CARTER
WIN THAT ELECTION.

1868
01:32:36,626 --> 01:32:40,125
HE WAS THE MOST POPULAR WRITER
IN THE UNITED STATES.

1869
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:44,858
My next guest is one
of the most controversial
writers in America

1870
01:32:44,858 --> 01:32:46,892
and the inventor
of gonzo journalism.

1871
01:32:46,892 --> 01:32:48,758
We're delighted that
he could be with us tonight.

1872
01:32:48,758 --> 01:32:51,092
Welcome, please,
Dr. Hunter Thompson.

1873
01:32:51,092 --> 01:32:54,459
- ( applause )
- Brinkley: HE HAD JUST
DELIVERED "HELL'S ANGELS"

1874
01:32:54,459 --> 01:32:56,459
"VEGAS,"
"CAMPAIGN TRAIL,"

1875
01:32:56,459 --> 01:32:59,192
AND ALL THOSE GREAT
"ROLLING STONE" PIECES.

1876
01:32:59,192 --> 01:33:02,259
PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE THIS GUY WAS GONNA
STOP AT THAT POINT.

1877
01:33:02,259 --> 01:33:05,658
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER
HE WOULD HAVE 30 YEARS
OF THIS KIND OF PRODUCTIVITY.

1878
01:33:05,658 --> 01:33:08,159
HE WAS--
HE WAS SO HOT.

1879
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:11,192
HE'D GIVE A SPEECH
AT A COLLEGE

1880
01:33:11,192 --> 01:33:14,725
AND 20 WOMEN
WANTED TO PARTY
WITH HIM ALL NIGHT.

1881
01:33:14,725 --> 01:33:17,058
CLASSIC ROCK 'N' ROLL
ATTITUDE.

1882
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:18,925
AND HUNTER SAW
ROCK STARS,

1883
01:33:18,925 --> 01:33:22,392
AND HE THOUGHT,
"WHY SHOULDN'T A WRITER
BE A ROCK STAR?"

1884
01:33:22,392 --> 01:33:26,325
HE BECAME
THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL--
TRASH THE HOTEL ROOM,

1885
01:33:26,325 --> 01:33:28,459
THROW THE TYPEWRITER
OUT THE WINDOW,

1886
01:33:28,459 --> 01:33:30,459
LET THE WOMEN IN,
TOO MUCH DRUGS--

1887
01:33:30,459 --> 01:33:32,791
MEANWHILE, THERE WAS
THIS OTHER SIDE OF HIM.

1888
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:35,359
HE WAS THE SQUIRE
OF WOODY CREEK,

1889
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:36,925
WHO HAD
A WIFE AND A KID.

1890
01:33:36,925 --> 01:33:39,359
( "Devil or Angel"
playing )

1891
01:33:43,992 --> 01:33:46,492
* DEVIL OR ANGEL

1892
01:33:46,492 --> 01:33:50,125
* I CAN'T MAKE UP
MY MIND *

1893
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:52,958
* WHICH ONE YOU ARE

1894
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:56,791
* I'D LIKE
TO WAKE UP AND FIND *

1895
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:59,858
* DEVIL OR ANGEL

1896
01:33:59,858 --> 01:34:02,825
* DEAR, WHEREVER YOU ARE

1897
01:34:02,825 --> 01:34:05,992
* I MISS YOU,
I MISS YOU... *

1898
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:09,858
Wright:
HERE WAS ALL THIS FAME,

1899
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:11,925
ALL THESE FAMOUS PEOPLE,

1900
01:34:11,925 --> 01:34:14,492
ALL THESE
HANGER-ON GIRLS

1901
01:34:14,492 --> 01:34:16,459
AND PEOPLE COMING
INTO MY KITCHEN

1902
01:34:16,459 --> 01:34:17,958
WITH HEELS LIKE THIS.

1903
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,459
WE LIVED OUT
IN WOODY CREEK--

1904
01:34:19,459 --> 01:34:24,259
AND IN TIGHT JEANS
AND STILETTOS

1905
01:34:24,259 --> 01:34:26,192
AND EVERYTHING GORGEOUS.

1906
01:34:26,192 --> 01:34:28,858
AND I SAID,
"WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

1907
01:34:28,858 --> 01:34:31,958
AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING
IN MY WORLD?"

1908
01:34:34,958 --> 01:34:37,958
Juan:
YOU DON'T THINK HOW
IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT.

1909
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:41,925
YOU JUST ACCEPT
THAT MY DAD GETS UP
AT 5:00 IN THE AFTERNOON

1910
01:34:41,925 --> 01:34:44,559
FOR THE 5:00 NEWS.

1911
01:34:44,559 --> 01:34:46,492
HE EATS BREAKFAST,
I EAT DINNER.

1912
01:34:46,492 --> 01:34:48,626
IT'S A SHAME
HE WASN'T AROUND MORE,

1913
01:34:48,626 --> 01:34:50,225
BUT THAT'S WHO HE WAS.

1914
01:34:51,892 --> 01:34:53,725
I MET HUNTER
IN JOHN BELUSHI'S
DRESSING ROOM

1915
01:34:53,725 --> 01:34:55,459
AT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

1916
01:34:55,459 --> 01:34:57,691
HE WAS
THE ULTIMATE BAD BOY,

1917
01:34:57,691 --> 01:35:00,159
BUT WE BECAME
FANTASTIC FRIENDS.

1918
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:03,459
AND ONE NIGHT
HE WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE

1919
01:35:03,459 --> 01:35:05,459
AND I GUESS BY THE WAY
HE WAS TALKING TO THEM--

1920
01:35:05,459 --> 01:35:07,125
WHEN HE HUNG UP I SAID,
"OH, WHO WAS THAT?"

1921
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:09,225
AND HE SAID,
"WELL, THAT'S SONDI."

1922
01:35:09,225 --> 01:35:11,758
I SAID, "WELL, WHO'S SONDI?"
HE SAID, "MY WIFE,"

1923
01:35:11,758 --> 01:35:13,325
AND I SAID,
"YOUR WIFE?"

1924
01:35:14,992 --> 01:35:18,025
Brinkley:
MEANWHILE, HIS MARRIAGE
WAS GETTING VERY ROCKY,

1925
01:35:18,025 --> 01:35:20,526
HE WAS STARTING TO DRINK
AND DO TOO MANY DRUGS

1926
01:35:20,526 --> 01:35:23,092
AND FELL INTO FAME.

1927
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:26,092
Caddell:
WHAT HAD GIVEN HIM
HIS STRENGTH--

1928
01:35:26,092 --> 01:35:27,791
HIS ANONYMITY-- WAS GONE.

1929
01:35:27,791 --> 01:35:30,492
BY WRITING AND BECOMING
THE POLITICAL REPORTER HE WAS,

1930
01:35:30,492 --> 01:35:33,526
HE HAD LOST THAT ANONYMITY
THAT HAD BEEN HIS CLOAK.

1931
01:35:33,526 --> 01:35:35,292
SO NOW HE WAS THE STORY.

1932
01:35:35,292 --> 01:35:37,159
I USED TO BE ABLE
TO STAND IN THE BACK

1933
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:39,425
AND OBSERVE STORIES
AND ABSORB THEM.

1934
01:35:39,425 --> 01:35:42,159
NOW THE MINUTE
I APPEAR AT A STORY,

1935
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,925
THEN I BECOME
PART OF IT.

1936
01:35:43,925 --> 01:35:46,359
FIRST TIME I WENT
TO A PRESS CONFERENCE
WITH JIMMY CARTER

1937
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:48,325
I HAD TO SIGN
MORE AUTOGRAPHS
THAN CARTER SIGNED.

1938
01:35:49,992 --> 01:35:51,691
AND THE SECRET SERVICE HAD
NO IDEA WHO I WAS.

1939
01:35:51,691 --> 01:35:52,958
THEY THOUGHT I WAS
AN ASTRONAUT.

1940
01:35:54,425 --> 01:35:56,425
Wenner:
AT THAT POINT,
YOU KNOW, IT WAS HARD.

1941
01:35:56,425 --> 01:35:58,125
HOW DO YOU FIND STUFF
FOR HUNTER TO DO?

1942
01:35:58,125 --> 01:35:59,791
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR A STORY THAT SOMEHOW

1943
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:01,892
CAN TOP THE CAMPAIGN STORY
OR VEGAS,

1944
01:36:01,892 --> 01:36:03,992
SOMETHING BIG ENOUGH
FOR HIS TALENT.

1945
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:08,559
GOING TO ZAIRE SEEMED
LIKE A NATURAL ASSIGNMENT
FOR HUNTER,

1946
01:36:08,559 --> 01:36:11,125
A BIG SPECTACLE,
HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT;

1947
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,526
ALI, WHOM HE KNEW
OR HAD WRITTEN ABOUT BEFORE.

1948
01:36:13,526 --> 01:36:16,992
HE WENT.
STEADMAN CAME DOWN
FROM LONDON.

1949
01:36:16,992 --> 01:36:19,825
I'M GONNA RETIRE
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD!

1950
01:36:19,825 --> 01:36:22,992
SEPTEMBER THE 25th,
THE WORLD WILL BE STUNNED!

1951
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:27,492
Brinkley:
HIS HERO, NUMBER ONE,
WAS MUHAMMAD ALI.

1952
01:36:27,492 --> 01:36:29,492
HE USED TO ALWAYS SAY
THAT HE WAS RELATED

1953
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:31,725
TO CASSIUS CLAY
IN THE BLOODLINE.

1954
01:36:31,725 --> 01:36:34,658
I'VE NEVER
FULLY BELIEVED IT--

1955
01:36:34,658 --> 01:36:37,392
IT COULD BE TRUE--
BUT HE LOVED TO SAY

1956
01:36:37,392 --> 01:36:40,092
THAT HE WAS BLOOD-RELATED
TO MUHAMMAD ALI.

1957
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:42,325
HAH! SUCKER,
YOU AIN'T NOTHING.

1958
01:36:42,325 --> 01:36:45,992
YOU'RE TOO UGLY TO REPRESENT
US COLORED FOLKS.

1959
01:36:45,992 --> 01:36:48,592
Brinkley:
AND REMEMBER AGAIN,
MUHAMMAD ALI IS

1960
01:36:48,592 --> 01:36:50,225
THIS TOUCHSTONE
FOR HUNTER,

1961
01:36:50,225 --> 01:36:53,359
THAT THE KENTUCKY BOYS
ARE MAKING IT BIG.

1962
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:56,992
- ( grunts )
YOU OUT, SUCKER.
- ( men chuckle )

1963
01:36:56,992 --> 01:37:00,092
Wolfe:
HE WENT TO ZAIRE TO COVER
THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE.

1964
01:37:00,092 --> 01:37:02,092
IT WAS
THE FOREGONE CONCLUSION

1965
01:37:02,092 --> 01:37:04,626
THAT GEORGE FOREMAN WAS
GOING TO KNOCK OUT
MUHAMMAD ALI.

1966
01:37:04,626 --> 01:37:06,192
THERE SEEMED TO BE NO WAY

1967
01:37:06,192 --> 01:37:08,025
THAT ALI COULD SURVIVE
THAT FIGHT.

1968
01:37:08,025 --> 01:37:10,225
( Hunter speaks )

1969
01:37:10,225 --> 01:37:12,159
( Steadman speaks )

1970
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,092
( Hunter speaking )

1971
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:24,058
( Hunter speaking )

1972
01:37:29,758 --> 01:37:31,691
( Hunter speaking )

1973
01:37:36,626 --> 01:37:38,292
( inhaling deeply )

1974
01:37:40,492 --> 01:37:43,225
HE STOPS, AND HE LOOKS UP
AT THE DRUG DEALER
AND HE SAYS...

1975
01:37:43,225 --> 01:37:45,159
( Hunter yelling )

1976
01:37:47,925 --> 01:37:49,858
( yelling )

1977
01:37:51,425 --> 01:37:54,526
YOU KNOW, AND IT GOT WORSE
AND WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.

1978
01:37:54,526 --> 01:37:56,526
( Hunter yelling )

1979
01:37:56,526 --> 01:37:59,958
THIS WAS WHEN HUNTER GAVE
OUR TICKETS AWAY.

1980
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,092
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT I DID.

1981
01:38:02,092 --> 01:38:04,658
I JUST THINK
I TRIED TO WATCH IT
ON TELEVISION OR SOMETHING

1982
01:38:04,658 --> 01:38:06,359
SO I WOULD GET
SOME IDEA OF IT,

1983
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:09,392
BUT HUNTER HAD GONE
DOWN TO THE POOL

1984
01:38:09,392 --> 01:38:11,526
WITH A BUCKET OF ICE

1985
01:38:11,526 --> 01:38:13,559
AND A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY,

1986
01:38:13,559 --> 01:38:15,526
DRINKING AND SMOKES--
HIS DUNHILLS.

1987
01:38:15,526 --> 01:38:18,159
AND HUNTER DECIDED TO...

1988
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,058
TAKE A DIP IN THE POOL,

1989
01:38:20,058 --> 01:38:22,492
FLOAT IN THE POOL
AT THE HOTEL

1990
01:38:22,492 --> 01:38:24,292
THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE FIGHT.

1991
01:38:24,292 --> 01:38:26,858
( Hunter whoops )

1992
01:38:26,858 --> 01:38:29,292
Announcer:
30 seconds left
in round eight.

1993
01:38:30,559 --> 01:38:34,292
AS IT TURNED OUT,
IT WAS ONE OF THE...

1994
01:38:34,292 --> 01:38:36,259
CLASSIC FIGHTS
OF ALL TIME.

1995
01:38:36,259 --> 01:38:38,192
Announcer:
Another sneaky right hand.

1996
01:38:38,192 --> 01:38:40,025
This time he worked
over his shoulder.

1997
01:38:40,025 --> 01:38:42,025
Unbelievable!

1998
01:38:42,025 --> 01:38:44,559
( cheering )

1999
01:38:44,559 --> 01:38:46,958
( Hunter speaks )

2000
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:50,858
Referee:
Four, five, six, seven--

2001
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:52,858
( announcer yelling )

2002
01:38:52,858 --> 01:38:54,791
( Hunter speaks )

2003
01:39:04,526 --> 01:39:07,325
THIS WAS CALLED
THE BIGGEST FUCKED-UP
JOURNALISTIC STORY

2004
01:39:07,325 --> 01:39:09,159
IN THE HISTORY
OF JOURNALISM--

2005
01:39:09,159 --> 01:39:11,192
THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T
GET A STORY.

2006
01:39:11,192 --> 01:39:14,958
Wenner: ZAIRE WAS
HUNTER'S FIRST BIG FAILURE
AS AN ASSIGNMENT.

2007
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:17,192
THERE WAS A BIG EXPENSE BILL--
WHICH I PAID FOR--

2008
01:39:17,192 --> 01:39:18,958
AND DIDN'T DO THE PIECE,

2009
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:20,325
AND THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING
TO US ALL.

2010
01:39:20,325 --> 01:39:23,058
I THINK HUNTER FELT
A STRONG SENSE OF FAILURE.

2011
01:39:23,058 --> 01:39:26,925
THAT WAS KIND OF THE BEGINNING
OF A PERIOD OF DECLINE THERE.

2012
01:39:26,925 --> 01:39:30,259
HE, AS A WRITER,
A JOURNALIST AND A PERSON,

2013
01:39:30,259 --> 01:39:33,192
RAN UP AGAINST
SOME WALL THERE
OR A PERIOD THERE,

2014
01:39:33,192 --> 01:39:35,025
WHETHER IT WAS
COMING FROM EXHAUSTION

2015
01:39:35,025 --> 01:39:39,459
OR SOMETHING GOING
ON WITH HIS MARRIAGE--
SOMEWHERE HE JUST LOST IT.

2016
01:39:40,958 --> 01:39:43,791
Wright:
HUNTER CAME BACK
FROM AFRICA,

2017
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:46,425
HE DIDN'T WAKE UP
FOR A DAY AND A HALF.

2018
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:49,825
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE JUST COULDN'T WRITE.

2019
01:39:49,825 --> 01:39:51,325
HE COULDN'T PIECE
IT TOGETHER.

2020
01:39:51,325 --> 01:39:53,691
HIS LIFE REALLY CHANGED
AFTER THAT

2021
01:39:53,691 --> 01:39:57,259
AND HE KNEW THAT
HE WASN'T THE WRITER
THAT HE WANTED TO BE.

2022
01:39:57,259 --> 01:39:59,192
- ( chatting )
- * MAN...

2023
01:40:03,058 --> 01:40:05,325
* YOU KNOW
I DONE ENJOYED THINGS *

2024
01:40:05,325 --> 01:40:08,425
* THAT KINGS AND QUEENS
WILL NEVER HAVE... *

2025
01:40:08,425 --> 01:40:10,725
Wenner:
HE STOPPED WRITING FULL-TIME
IN THE MID-'70s,

2026
01:40:10,725 --> 01:40:12,292
THEN HE'D JUST DO
THE ARTICLES.

2027
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:14,092
PART OF WHAT HAPPENED
WAS I THINK

2028
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,858
THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE
HANGING AROUND WOODY CREEK,

2029
01:40:15,858 --> 01:40:17,791
AND HE WAS VERY WELCOMING
AND ENJOYED IT ALL,

2030
01:40:17,791 --> 01:40:19,858
BUT IT REALLY MADE IT
DIFFICULT TO WORK.

2031
01:40:19,858 --> 01:40:22,858
"...SAFE FOR MY YOUNG SON."

2032
01:40:22,858 --> 01:40:24,992
( all laughing )

2033
01:40:24,992 --> 01:40:27,958
"BUT THE FRONT DOORS ARE
A DIFFERENT MATTER."

2034
01:40:27,958 --> 01:40:31,392
Brinkley: I WAS
A BIT OF A STRAIGHT MAN
ENTERING HIS CARNIVAL LIFE.

2035
01:40:31,392 --> 01:40:35,125
HE USED TO CALL
HIMSELF A DRUG-ADDLED
COMPOUND JUNKIE.

2036
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:40,526
* AND GOOD TIMES, MMM

2037
01:40:42,526 --> 01:40:45,159
* I HAVE HAD MY FUN...

2038
01:40:48,658 --> 01:40:50,626
Stranahan:
I'D GO AROUND
TO TAKE CARE OF HUNTER.

2039
01:40:50,626 --> 01:40:52,958
IF HE CAN TOSS
THE HEINEKEN BOTTLE
AND CATCH IT,

2040
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:54,592
HE HASN'T HAD
TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

2041
01:40:56,325 --> 01:40:59,259
AND HE BEGAN TO RETREAT
TO OWL FARM MORE AND MORE.

2042
01:41:02,791 --> 01:41:05,125
Juan:
THEN EVENTUALLY HE DIDN'T
REALLY GO OUT AT ALL.

2043
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:06,791
I GUESS PEOPLE
CAME TO HIM.

2044
01:41:08,691 --> 01:41:10,292
Wenner:
HE WAS WRITING
OCCASIONAL COLUMNS

2045
01:41:10,292 --> 01:41:12,259
FOR THE "EXAMINER"
AND HE DID THAT "LONO" BOOK.

2046
01:41:12,259 --> 01:41:14,892
THEY WERE ALL RIGHT.

2047
01:41:14,892 --> 01:41:16,892
BUT HE WROTE
THREE PIECES,

2048
01:41:16,892 --> 01:41:19,925
JUST-- THEY WERE
JUST BRILLIANT.

2049
01:41:19,925 --> 01:41:23,658
ELKO, PULITZER, "POLO"--
THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL,

2050
01:41:23,658 --> 01:41:26,292
BUT HIS WORK NEVER GOT
QUITE BACK TO THOSE LEVELS.

2051
01:41:26,292 --> 01:41:28,858
IT WAS
ALL JUST REPETITIVE,

2052
01:41:28,858 --> 01:41:31,892
NOT FUNNY
GOOFBALL STUFF.

2053
01:41:31,892 --> 01:41:33,892
HUNTER WANTED A PERSONA,

2054
01:41:33,892 --> 01:41:36,592
BUT HE BECAME A HOSTAGE
TO THAT PERSONA

2055
01:41:36,592 --> 01:41:38,359
AS HE GOT OLDER AND OLDER

2056
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:41,626
AND HE WAS BEING RIDICULED
AS A COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER.

2057
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:45,159
WHEN GARRY TRUDEAU
FIRST MADE DUKE

2058
01:41:45,159 --> 01:41:46,758
A CHARACTER
IN DOONESBURY

2059
01:41:46,758 --> 01:41:48,626
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY,
LITERALLY,

2060
01:41:48,626 --> 01:41:50,658
THE RAOUL DUKE CHARACTER
THAT HUNTER INVENTED.

2061
01:41:50,658 --> 01:41:52,292
IT WAS HUNTER'S
LITERARY PROPERTY.

2062
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:55,858
SO I THINK HE SHOULD'VE--
HE COULD HAVE AND--

2063
01:41:55,858 --> 01:41:57,691
IN RETROSPECT--
SHOULD HAVE STOPPED THAT.

2064
01:42:03,125 --> 01:42:05,125
BUT THEN HE SAID,
"WHAT CAN I DO?

2065
01:42:05,125 --> 01:42:08,392
I DECIDED TO OWN IT.
THEY WANT TO SEE UNCLE DUKE?

2066
01:42:08,392 --> 01:42:10,791
I'LL GIVE 'EM UNCLE DUKE
TIMES FIVE."

2067
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:21,159
- WOW.
- Man: YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

2068
01:42:21,159 --> 01:42:23,592
Caddell:
HE HATED "DOONESBURY."
HE HATED BEING A CARICATURE.

2069
01:42:23,592 --> 01:42:25,592
HE ALSO LOVED
BEING A STAR,

2070
01:42:25,592 --> 01:42:28,092
BUT ALSO IT INTERFERED
WITH HIM BEING A REPORTER,

2071
01:42:28,092 --> 01:42:30,192
WHICH IS WHAT
HE WANTED TO BE.

2072
01:42:30,192 --> 01:42:31,791
Hunter:
IF YOU WANT TO BE
A FAMOUS AMERICAN WRITER,

2073
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:33,791
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK OF...

2074
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:36,492
BEING IN THE COMIC STRIPS,

2075
01:42:36,492 --> 01:42:38,125
- YOU KNOW, BEING--
- ( ice clatters )

2076
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:39,559
OH, ARE WE DOING THINGS
LIKE THAT?

2077
01:42:39,559 --> 01:42:41,159
YES, IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA

2078
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:43,626
AND IT WILL BE ON FILM,
WON'T IT? MMM.

2079
01:42:43,626 --> 01:42:46,159
HUNTER DID BECOME,
IN A WAY, A PRISONER
OF HIS OWN FAME.

2080
01:42:49,125 --> 01:42:52,325
Wright:
I WAS GETTING MORE
DISTRAUGHT WITH HIS FAME.

2081
01:42:52,325 --> 01:42:54,392
IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS
IN THE HOUSE.

2082
01:42:54,392 --> 01:42:59,125
JUST THOUGHTS
OF BOOZE, DRUGS,

2083
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:02,992
STAYING UP FOR DAYS
AND PARTIES.

2084
01:43:02,992 --> 01:43:06,025
AND LITTLE DID I KNOW
HE WAS HAVING AFFAIRS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

2085
01:43:06,025 --> 01:43:10,025
IT WAS UNHEALTHY FOR ME,
IT WAS UNHEALTHY FOR MY SON.

2086
01:43:10,025 --> 01:43:13,425
Brinkley:
EVENTUALLY SONDI
UNCOVERED A TAPE

2087
01:43:13,425 --> 01:43:14,992
OF A WOMAN
THAT HE WAS WITH.

2088
01:43:14,992 --> 01:43:19,392
Woman:
I'm gonna burn up
with unfulfilled desire

2089
01:43:19,392 --> 01:43:22,758
if I have to stay here
one more minute alone.

2090
01:43:22,758 --> 01:43:26,192
( Hunter speaks )

2091
01:43:26,192 --> 01:43:29,691
No, I don't want
the delivery boy.
I want you.

2092
01:43:31,791 --> 01:43:33,626
( woman giggles )

2093
01:43:33,626 --> 01:43:35,259
Wright:
SO I REMEMBER SITTING
ON THE PHONE,

2094
01:43:35,259 --> 01:43:37,459
I LOOKED UP AT HIM
AND I SAID,

2095
01:43:37,459 --> 01:43:39,559
"YOU KNOW I CAN'T
DO THIS ANYMORE.

2096
01:43:39,559 --> 01:43:42,758
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
HAVE A DIVORCE."

2097
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:44,626
WELL...
( mimics explosion )

2098
01:43:44,626 --> 01:43:47,825
HE JUST BLEW UP
AND THEN I GOT SCARED

2099
01:43:47,825 --> 01:43:51,892
AND I ENDED UP
CALLING THE SHERIFF.

2100
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:54,292
AND A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY
COMES OUT TO THE HOUSE.

2101
01:43:54,292 --> 01:43:56,892
THE GUYS SAYS...

2102
01:43:56,892 --> 01:43:59,392
"UM, DOES HE HAVE
ANY GUNS?"

2103
01:43:59,392 --> 01:44:01,626
AND I SAID,
"'DOES HE HAVE ANY GUNS?'

2104
01:44:01,626 --> 01:44:03,725
HE HAS 22 GUNS

2105
01:44:03,725 --> 01:44:05,925
AND EVERY ONE
IS LOADED."

2106
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:09,325
- ( gunshot )
- Woman: HEY!

2107
01:44:09,325 --> 01:44:10,992
( mumbles )

2108
01:44:10,992 --> 01:44:13,259
Brinkley:
IT WAS NOT AN EASY DIVORCE
FOR HUNTER.

2109
01:44:13,259 --> 01:44:16,825
HE REFUSED
TO LEAVE OWL FARM.

2110
01:44:16,825 --> 01:44:19,791
SANDY SAID, "THE ONLY THING
HE OWNS IS THIS LAND.

2111
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:22,225
I HAVE TO HAVE HALF
OF WHAT HUNTER OWNS,

2112
01:44:22,225 --> 01:44:24,658
'CAUSE I'M DIVORCING HIM.

2113
01:44:24,658 --> 01:44:26,125
AND I DON'T WANT
HALF THE LAND

2114
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:27,992
BECAUSE I HAVE TO LIVE
NEXT TO THE SON OF A BITCH."

2115
01:44:27,992 --> 01:44:31,626
SO I GOT TO BUY
MY LAND BACK.

2116
01:44:31,626 --> 01:44:34,325
WELL, I'D GIVEN IT
TO HUNTER.

2117
01:44:34,325 --> 01:44:37,459
SO THEN I ENDED UP
MAKING PAYMENTS TO SONDI
FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS.

2118
01:44:37,459 --> 01:44:39,392
BUZZ OFF!
I'M GOING TO FLORIDA.

2119
01:44:39,392 --> 01:44:41,658
Brinkley:
HE COULDN'T WRITE.

2120
01:44:41,658 --> 01:44:44,025
HE WAS
COMPLETELY SHATTERED

2121
01:44:44,025 --> 01:44:46,459
AND JIMMY BUFFET CAME
TO HIS RESCUE

2122
01:44:46,459 --> 01:44:48,626
AND ALLOWED HIM
TO COME DOWN

2123
01:44:48,626 --> 01:44:50,958
AND STAY AT HIS HOUSE
IN KEY WEST FREE OF CHARGE.

2124
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:55,125
* WASTING AWAY AGAIN
IN MARGARITAVILLE... *

2125
01:44:55,125 --> 01:44:58,159
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.

2126
01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:02,025
* SEARCHING FOR MY
LOST SUGAR AND SALT... *

2127
01:45:02,025 --> 01:45:04,425
Hunter:
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE
DRIVE SO FUCKING SLOWLY.

2128
01:45:04,425 --> 01:45:06,992
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
YOU DIRTY SONS OF BITCHES.

2129
01:45:06,992 --> 01:45:09,425
MOVE OVER. GO GET
IN THE FAST LANE,
YOU COCKSUCKERS.

2130
01:45:13,592 --> 01:45:15,192
Buffet:
THE FIRST THING I SEE IS

2131
01:45:15,192 --> 01:45:17,025
"GONZO JOURNALIST
COMES TO KEY WEST,"

2132
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:19,425
FRONT PAGE,
FUCKING "MIAMI HERALD."

2133
01:45:19,425 --> 01:45:21,791
HUNTER'S STRETCHED OUT
IN MY APARTMENT.

2134
01:45:21,791 --> 01:45:23,992
AND THEN ALL
OF A SUDDEN, I GOT A CALL
FROM MY ACCOUNTANT.

2135
01:45:23,992 --> 01:45:25,992
HE SAID, "WHAT'S THIS

2136
01:45:25,992 --> 01:45:29,025
$9,000 TELEPHONE BILL?"
AND I WENT...

2137
01:45:29,025 --> 01:45:32,092
"OH MY GOD,
HUNTER'S DOWN THERE
AND I LEFT THE PHONE ON."

2138
01:45:32,092 --> 01:45:34,192
AND LIKE ALWAYS...

2139
01:45:34,192 --> 01:45:38,092
THEN HE GOT A BOAT
AND I THOUGHT, "OH, JESUS."

2140
01:45:38,092 --> 01:45:42,492
YOU KNOW, I EXPECTED
TO READ THE OBITUARY
DURING THOSE DAYS.

2141
01:45:42,492 --> 01:45:47,292
* IF I HAD A BOAT,
I'D GO OUT ON THE OCEAN *

2142
01:45:47,292 --> 01:45:49,492
* AND IF I HAD A PONY

2143
01:45:49,492 --> 01:45:52,526
* I'D RIDE HIM
ON MY BOAT *

2144
01:45:52,526 --> 01:45:54,791
* AND WE COULD
ALL TOGETHER *

2145
01:45:54,791 --> 01:45:57,526
* GO OUT ON THE OCEAN

2146
01:45:57,526 --> 01:46:01,925
* I SAID ME UPON MY PONY
ON MY BOAT *

2147
01:46:01,925 --> 01:46:05,425
* I SAID
ME UPON MY PONY *

2148
01:46:05,425 --> 01:46:09,691
* ON MY BOAT.

2149
01:46:09,691 --> 01:46:12,658
Anita on tape:
Say hello to the dolphins.
Well, hello.

2150
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:15,325
Okay.

2151
01:46:15,325 --> 01:46:17,559
Anita:
WELL, THE FIRST TIME
I MET HUNTER,

2152
01:46:17,559 --> 01:46:21,292
IT WAS JUST KIND OF A--
BIG WRITER THAT I WAS
CURIOUS ABOUT.

2153
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:24,691
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
HE PROMISED ME 10 YEARS.

2154
01:46:24,691 --> 01:46:28,159
I JUST FIGURED HE WAS
SUCH A POWERFUL FORCE

2155
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:29,791
THAT HE WOULD KNOW.

2156
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:33,025
IF HE SAID 10 YEARS,
THAT MEANT 10 YEARS.

2157
01:46:33,025 --> 01:46:36,359
HE HAD TALKED
ABOUT SUICIDE A LOT
SINCE I'VE KNOWN HIM,

2158
01:46:36,359 --> 01:46:39,259
AND NOW I KNOW,
TALKING TO HIS FORMER WIFE

2159
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:41,825
AND OTHER GIRLFRIENDS,
THAT HE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME.

2160
01:46:43,992 --> 01:46:45,992
Depp:
"TROUBLE CAN COME AT YOU

2161
01:46:45,992 --> 01:46:47,526
FROM ANY DIRECTION
THESE DAYS,

2162
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,892
LIKE BEING CHASED THROUGH
A CROWDED PARKING LOT

2163
01:46:49,892 --> 01:46:51,858
BY A PACK
OF VICIOUS STRAY DOGS.

2164
01:46:51,858 --> 01:46:55,492
THE WORLD'S SITUATION HAS
BECOME SO NERVOUS AND WRONG

2165
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:57,958
THAT DISASTERS THAT
WOULD'VE BEEN INCONCEIVABLE

2166
01:46:57,958 --> 01:47:02,125
TWO YEARS AGO ARE
ALMOST COMMONPLACE TODAY."

2167
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:04,125
Anita:
I DID START
TO WORRY ABOUT HIM

2168
01:47:04,125 --> 01:47:06,058
RIGHT AFTER
THE BUSH ELECTION.

2169
01:47:06,058 --> 01:47:08,225
THAT I THINK
WAS THE TRIGGER.

2170
01:47:08,225 --> 01:47:10,125
HE DIDN'T GET ANGRY,
HE JUST GOT DEPRESSED.

2171
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:12,292
YOU KNOW, I COULD HANDLE
WHEN HE WAS ANGRY,

2172
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:14,825
FEISTY OR SULKY--

2173
01:47:14,825 --> 01:47:17,691
ANYTHING BUT DEPRESSED
OR SOMETHING I WASN'T USED TO.

2174
01:47:17,691 --> 01:47:21,559
* Goodbye,
Norma Jean... *

2175
01:47:21,559 --> 01:47:25,691
THERE ARE CERTAIN MOMENTS
THAT I'M REALLY GLAD
I HAD THE CAMERA.

2176
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:28,925
THERE'S A MOMENT
I WALK OUT ONTO THE BALCONY--

2177
01:47:28,925 --> 01:47:32,459
HE HAD BEEN LISTENING
TO "CANDLE IN THE WIND"
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

2178
01:47:32,459 --> 01:47:34,292
THERE WAS A LOOK
OF A GRIN,

2179
01:47:34,292 --> 01:47:36,159
LIKE A ROGUISH EYE
IN HIS EYE

2180
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,159
WHEN HE WAS
ABOUT TO HAVE SOME FUN.

2181
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,292
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

2182
01:47:41,691 --> 01:47:44,025
Anita:
SEEING HIM
LOOK AT THE KEYS--

2183
01:47:44,025 --> 01:47:46,058
ESPECIALLY TO MUSIC--
WHEN HE WAS HAVING FUN,

2184
01:47:46,058 --> 01:47:48,725
YOU COULD
SEE IT IN HIS FACE
AND ALSO ON THE PAGE.

2185
01:47:48,725 --> 01:47:50,925
* I would have liked
to have known you *

2186
01:47:50,925 --> 01:47:55,058
* Oh, but I was
just a kid *

2187
01:47:55,058 --> 01:47:57,725
* Your candle burned out
long before... *

2188
01:47:57,725 --> 01:47:59,359
( both laughing )

2189
01:48:00,858 --> 01:48:05,225
- * Your legend ever did.
- I feel wet.

2190
01:48:06,758 --> 01:48:08,892
Anita on tape:
Uh-oh. Good.

2191
01:48:08,892 --> 01:48:12,791
WHEN HE DID DIE, HIS WORDS
TOOK ON A NEW SPARKLE,

2192
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:15,758
MAYBE BECAUSE
THEY ARE FINITE NOW.

2193
01:48:15,758 --> 01:48:18,058
WE HAVE A FINITE AMOUNT.

2194
01:48:18,058 --> 01:48:22,526
AND JUST THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE THE WORDS
IS A LUCKY THING.

2195
01:48:22,526 --> 01:48:24,359
I MEAN, IMAGINE IN
A TWISTED UNIVERSE

2196
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:27,259
WHEN HE DIED
IF SOMEHOW HE TOOK

2197
01:48:27,259 --> 01:48:28,992
HIS WORDS WITH HIM,
HIS WORK.

2198
01:48:31,658 --> 01:48:33,858
- ( grapefruit thuds )
- Anita: OH, COME ON, HUNTER.

2199
01:48:33,858 --> 01:48:36,159
- THAT WAS NOT COOL AT ALL.
- I WAS TOSSING IT TO YOU.

2200
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:38,359
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

2201
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:41,058
- I DIDN'T HIT HIM
IN THE HEAD LIKE THAT.
- Anita: THAT'S ENOUGH.

2202
01:48:41,058 --> 01:48:44,359
Wolfe:
TO FEEL COMPELLED
TO BE GONZO ALL THE TIME

2203
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:47,225
MUST HAVE BEEN A BURDEN
ON HIS POOR MIND.

2204
01:48:47,225 --> 01:48:50,691
HE WAS SO IDENTIFIED
WITH THE LIFE HE'S DESCRIBED,

2205
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:54,025
IT WAS HARD FOR HIM
NOT TO BE IN COSTUME,

2206
01:48:54,025 --> 01:48:57,492
NOT TO BE THE ACTOR
THAT WAS REQUIRED.

2207
01:48:57,492 --> 01:49:00,992
HUNTER MUST
HAVE FELT TRAPPED--
TRAPPED IN GONZO.

2208
01:49:05,592 --> 01:49:07,791
Hunter:
SO, I'M REALLY
IN THE WAY AS A PERSON.

2209
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,058
THE MYTH HAS TAKEN OVER

2210
01:49:10,058 --> 01:49:12,825
AND I FIND MYSELF,
YOU KNOW, AN APPENDAGE.

2211
01:49:12,825 --> 01:49:14,025
I'M...

2212
01:49:15,592 --> 01:49:18,791
I'M NO LONGER NECESSARY.
I'M IN THE WAY.

2213
01:49:18,791 --> 01:49:20,758
IT'D BE MUCH BETTER
IF I DIED,

2214
01:49:20,758 --> 01:49:23,459
THEN PEOPLE COULD TAKE
THE MYTH AND MAKE FILMS.

2215
01:50:13,425 --> 01:50:14,858
LIKE, WHEN I GO OUT TO--

2216
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:17,058
WHEN I GOT INVITED TO SPEAK
AT, SAY, UNIVERSITIES,

2217
01:50:17,058 --> 01:50:19,359
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE
INVITING DUKE OR THOMPSON.

2218
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:21,225
so I'm not sure
who to be--

2219
01:50:21,225 --> 01:50:23,192
SO I'M NOT SURE WHO TO BE.

2220
01:50:23,192 --> 01:50:25,825
I suppose that my plans
are to figure out
some new identity.

2221
01:50:25,825 --> 01:50:28,459
You know, I have
to kill off one life
and start another one--

2222
01:50:28,459 --> 01:50:30,192
KILL OFF ONE LIFE
AND START ANOTHER ONE.

2223
01:50:30,192 --> 01:50:32,626
( "Mr. Tambourine Man"
playing )

2224
01:50:35,425 --> 01:50:40,292
* HEY, MR. TAMBOURINE MAN,
PLAY A SONG FOR ME *

2225
01:50:40,292 --> 01:50:42,259
- * I'M NOT SLEEPY... *
- ( gunshot )

2226
01:50:42,259 --> 01:50:46,125
* AND THERE IS
NO PLACE I'M GOING TO... *

2227
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:48,626
Juan:
IT WAS NO SECRET THAT

2228
01:50:48,626 --> 01:50:50,392
THAT'S THE WAY
HE WOULD DIE.

2229
01:50:50,392 --> 01:50:53,225
HE'D MADE THAT CLEAR
MANY YEARS BEFORE,

2230
01:50:53,225 --> 01:50:55,825
THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME,
HE WAS GONNA--

2231
01:50:55,825 --> 01:50:57,359
HE WAS GONNA
TAKE HIMSELF OUT

2232
01:50:57,359 --> 01:50:59,359
AND IT WOULD BE
WITH A GUN.

2233
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:02,791
SO THAT--
THAT WAS NO SURPRISE.

2234
01:51:02,791 --> 01:51:06,459
BUT IT'S ONE THING
TO KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT,

2235
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:08,325
YOU KNOW,
HE WAS GONNA KILL HIMSELF

2236
01:51:08,325 --> 01:51:10,758
AND IT'S ANOTHER
WHEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS.

2237
01:51:10,758 --> 01:51:13,559
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM

2238
01:51:13,559 --> 01:51:15,392
THAT WE WERE THERE.

2239
01:51:15,392 --> 01:51:18,025
IT WAS A SUNNY AFTERNOON
IN THE WINTER

2240
01:51:18,025 --> 01:51:19,992
AND IT WAS JUST
A VERY PEACEFUL TIME.

2241
01:51:19,992 --> 01:51:22,559
HIS FAMILY WAS THERE
AND HE DECIDED

2242
01:51:22,559 --> 01:51:25,125
"ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
A GOOD TIME TO GO OUT."

2243
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:26,526
IT SOUNDS KIND OF SAPPY,

2244
01:51:26,526 --> 01:51:29,459
BUT IT WAS
A WARM FAMILY MOMENT.

2245
01:51:29,459 --> 01:51:32,592
* I'M READY
TO GO ANYWHERE *

2246
01:51:32,592 --> 01:51:35,225
* I'M READY FOR TO FADE... *

2247
01:51:35,225 --> 01:51:38,025
Steadman:
WHEN HE DID IT,
JUAN WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM

2248
01:51:38,025 --> 01:51:40,559
AND HE SAID,
"WHEN IT HAPPENED

2249
01:51:40,559 --> 01:51:42,892
I THOUGHT
I HEARD A BOOK DROP."

2250
01:51:42,892 --> 01:51:44,559
( book thuds )

2251
01:51:44,559 --> 01:51:46,125
IT WENT LIKE THAT.

2252
01:51:46,125 --> 01:51:49,058
JUAN WENT OUTSIDE
WITH A GUN

2253
01:51:49,058 --> 01:51:51,425
AND SHOT THREE TIMES
INTO THE AIR.

2254
01:51:51,425 --> 01:51:54,125
( three gunshots )

2255
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:55,658
Steadman:
IT WAS A KIND OF
SALUTE TO HIM

2256
01:51:55,658 --> 01:51:57,992
AS MUCH AS ANYTHING--
OR SHOCK.

2257
01:52:00,292 --> 01:52:03,791
Wright:
HUNTER WAS VERY MUCH
ABOUT PRESERVING A LEGACY,

2258
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:06,392
AND THIS WAS PERFECT.

2259
01:52:06,392 --> 01:52:08,259
THIS WAS ROMANTIC.

2260
01:52:08,259 --> 01:52:11,125
AND IN A LOT
OF PEOPLE'S MINDS,

2261
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:15,058
IT WAS A VERY STRONG ACT.
IT WAS A NOBLE ACT.

2262
01:52:15,058 --> 01:52:17,592
"GO OUT WHEN
YOU'RE ON TOP."
HE WASN'T ON TOP.

2263
01:52:17,592 --> 01:52:20,758
HE WAS NOWHERE
NEAR ON TOP.

2264
01:52:20,758 --> 01:52:23,125
BUT SOME PEOPLE
THOUGHT THAT,

2265
01:52:23,125 --> 01:52:26,691
AND SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT
IT WAS A VERY COURAGEOUS ACT.

2266
01:52:26,691 --> 01:52:29,225
I THINK
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

2267
01:52:29,225 --> 01:52:31,691
I THINK THIS IS A TIME

2268
01:52:31,691 --> 01:52:34,125
WHEN A TOGETHER
HUNTER THOMPSON

2269
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:37,892
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IN THIS COUNTRY.

2270
01:52:37,892 --> 01:52:40,325
* I WOULDN'T
PAY IT ANY MIND *

2271
01:52:40,325 --> 01:52:42,559
* IT'S JUST A SHADOW
YOU'RE SEEING *

2272
01:52:42,559 --> 01:52:44,559
* THAT HE'S CHASING... *

2273
01:52:44,559 --> 01:52:47,526
Buffet:
IT'S A TRAGIC MISTAKE.
I WISH HE WAS STILL HERE.

2274
01:52:47,526 --> 01:52:50,392
I WISH THERE WAS STILL
A HUNTER AROUND TO TALK TO.

2275
01:52:50,392 --> 01:52:53,559
IT'S AN AMAZING THING.
YOU THINK ON ONE SIDE

2276
01:52:53,559 --> 01:52:56,925
IT'S FUN TO REMINISCE,
BUT ITS SAD THAT HE'S GONE.

2277
01:52:56,925 --> 01:52:59,858
WE COULD HAVE USED
A FEW MORE YEARS OF HUNTER.

2278
01:52:59,858 --> 01:53:03,359
HE COULD WIELD
A PRETTY EFFECTIVE SWORD

2279
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:04,992
AGAINST WHAT'S
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

2280
01:53:04,992 --> 01:53:08,626
* I'LL COME
FOLLOWIN' YOU... *

2281
01:53:10,725 --> 01:53:14,225
( Wenner speaking )

2282
01:53:14,225 --> 01:53:16,325
YOU KNOW, JUST ALL OF IT.

2283
01:53:16,325 --> 01:53:17,892
JUST ALL OF IT.

2284
01:53:21,526 --> 01:53:24,292
HUNTER, NO!
YOU BASTARD!

2285
01:53:24,292 --> 01:53:26,325
- ( Hunter chuckles )
- FUCKHEAD!

2286
01:53:26,325 --> 01:53:29,858
- OH SHIT.
- Hunter: YOU'RE OKAY.

2287
01:53:32,858 --> 01:53:34,658
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

2288
01:53:34,658 --> 01:53:36,592
( fire roars )

2289
01:53:37,825 --> 01:53:39,825
Buchanan:
HE FLAMED OUT TOO QUICKLY,

2290
01:53:39,825 --> 01:53:42,459
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
HE LIVED HIS LIFE

2291
01:53:42,459 --> 01:53:44,359
AND CHOSE
TO LIVE HIS LIFE.

2292
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:47,292
SO IN MY VIEW IT WAS--
IT WAS SELF-INDULGENT.

2293
01:53:47,292 --> 01:53:49,292
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
HE WANTED TO DO,

2294
01:53:49,292 --> 01:53:52,691
BUT HE HAD SO MUCH MORE
HE COULD GIVE HIS READERS

2295
01:53:52,691 --> 01:53:55,626
AND HIS PEOPLE...
AND HIMSELF.

2296
01:53:55,626 --> 01:53:57,559
( motorcycle
roars loudly )

2297
01:54:01,325 --> 01:54:03,325
THAT'S FITTING.
THAT'S FITTING.

2298
01:54:03,325 --> 01:54:06,259
- Man: THAT'S FITTING
FOR HUNTER.
- A MOTORCYCLE...

2299
01:54:06,259 --> 01:54:09,392
- ( men laughing )
- ...ROARS OFF.

2300
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:12,592
OKAY.

2301
01:54:14,725 --> 01:54:16,791
Steadman:
IT SEEMS WE'RE HERE
TODAY TO DISCUSS

2302
01:54:16,791 --> 01:54:18,825
SOME KIND IDEA
FOR A MONUMENT.

2303
01:54:18,825 --> 01:54:21,025
IF I SHOW YOU THIS--
THIS IS THE BASIC IDEA,

2304
01:54:21,025 --> 01:54:22,691
BUT ACTUALLY,
HUNTER HASN'T
APPROVED IT YET.

2305
01:54:22,691 --> 01:54:24,592
IT'S JUST
A THOUGHT, YEAH.

2306
01:54:24,592 --> 01:54:27,025
HE LIVES IN ASPEN

2307
01:54:27,025 --> 01:54:29,425
- IN COLORADO.
- Man: THAT IS DIFFERENT.

2308
01:54:29,425 --> 01:54:32,425
IS THIS SOMETHING
THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO

2309
01:54:32,425 --> 01:54:34,858
- IN THE NEAR FUTURE?
- Hunter: HE'S WRITTEN--

2310
01:54:34,858 --> 01:54:38,225
- I'M NOT SURE.
- I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING

2311
01:54:38,225 --> 01:54:40,292
THAT MAYBE YOU WANT
TO DO AFTER YOU DIE.

2312
01:54:40,292 --> 01:54:43,392
OH, YEAH,
IT'S IN THE WILL.
IT'S ALL DESCRIBED.

2313
01:54:43,392 --> 01:54:47,058
IT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE HARD TO DO,
PARTICULARLY WITH ME GONE.

2314
01:54:47,058 --> 01:54:50,492
THIS RIM OF MOUNTAINS
IS A GIANT VALLEY
20 MILES ACROSS.

2315
01:54:50,492 --> 01:54:52,992
- IS THIS PROPERTY
THAT YOU OWN NOW?
- Hunter: YEAH.

2316
01:54:52,992 --> 01:54:54,658
THE PROPERTY GOES BACK
OVER THE CLIFFS,

2317
01:54:54,658 --> 01:54:57,058
SO I CAN DO WHATEVER--
IF I WANTED TO BUILD A...

2318
01:54:58,758 --> 01:55:00,758
McDONALD'S,
I COULD DO IT BACK THERE.

2319
01:55:00,758 --> 01:55:03,359
( "Spirit in the Sky"
playing )

2320
01:55:13,825 --> 01:55:16,526
Hunter:
IT'S GONNA BE A PILE
OF ROCKS ABOUT 100' TALL.

2321
01:55:16,526 --> 01:55:19,691
* WHEN I DIE
AND THEY LAY ME TO REST... *

2322
01:55:19,691 --> 01:55:21,592
A GIANT CONE-- CONICAL.

2323
01:55:21,592 --> 01:55:23,626
GOING AROUND
AND TAPERING DOWN
TO THE TOP.

2324
01:55:23,626 --> 01:55:26,225
ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS,
THE DOCTOR TELLS ME
I'M GONNA DIE.

2325
01:55:26,225 --> 01:55:28,725
FOR ALL I KNOW,
SOMEHOW I MIGHT LIVE
FOR 10 MORE YEARS.

2326
01:55:28,725 --> 01:55:32,025
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING--
NONE OF US KNOW HOW LONG
WE'RE GONNA LIVE.

2327
01:55:35,025 --> 01:55:36,592
ON TOP OF THE BIG ARM,

2328
01:55:36,592 --> 01:55:39,325
A DOUBLE-- A FIST
WITH DOUBLE THUMBS--
THE SYMBOL.

2329
01:55:39,325 --> 01:55:41,259
I'VE TOLD YOU
1,000 TIMES FOR 10 YEARS--

2330
01:55:41,259 --> 01:55:43,125
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT
TWO THUMBS ON THE FIST.

2331
01:55:43,125 --> 01:55:46,192
Steadman:
IT'S BETTER THAN NO THUMB,
WHICH IS WHAT YOU HAD.

2332
01:55:46,192 --> 01:55:49,825
* SO YOU KNOW
THAT WHEN YOU DIE *

2333
01:55:49,825 --> 01:55:51,958
* HE'S GONNA RECOMMEND YOU *

2334
01:55:51,958 --> 01:55:54,025
* TO THE SPIRIT
IN THE SKY *

2335
01:55:54,025 --> 01:55:58,192
* GONNA RECOMMEND YOU
TO THE SPIRIT IN THE SKY *

2336
01:55:58,192 --> 01:56:02,192
* THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE
GONNA GO WHEN YOU DIE *

2337
01:56:02,192 --> 01:56:04,825
* WHEN YOU DIE AND THEY
LAY YOU TO REST... *

2338
01:56:04,825 --> 01:56:07,725
Hunter:
AFTER THE CREMATION, THEY PUT
THE ASHES IN A CANISTER

2339
01:56:07,725 --> 01:56:11,092
AND SHOOT IT OUT
OF THE TOP OF THE FIST
OVER THE VALLEY.

2340
01:56:11,092 --> 01:56:13,758
SAY 500' UP, IT EXPLODES

2341
01:56:13,758 --> 01:56:15,492
AND THE ASHES DRIFT OUT
ALL OVER THERE.

2342
01:56:15,492 --> 01:56:18,958
THAT I DO KNOW ABOUT.
WE PLACE ASHES IN
DIFFERENT AREAS.

2343
01:56:18,958 --> 01:56:21,892
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER
IN "ASHES TO ASHES,
AND DUST TO DUST."

2344
01:56:23,626 --> 01:56:25,559
( crowd cheers )

2345
01:56:45,592 --> 01:56:48,758
AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S MY FUNERAL.

2346
01:56:59,691 --> 01:57:02,658
Man:
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!

2347
01:57:02,658 --> 01:57:05,092
( "Lawyers, Guns and Money"
playing )

2348
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:20,092
* I WENT HOME
WITH THE WAITRESS *

2349
01:57:22,925 --> 01:57:25,459
* THE WAY I ALWAYS DO

2350
01:57:27,626 --> 01:57:30,691
* HOW WAS I TO KNOW

2351
01:57:32,392 --> 01:57:35,691
* SHE WAS
WITH THE RUSSIANS TOO? *

2352
01:57:44,992 --> 01:57:47,925
* I WAS GAMBLING
IN HAVANA *

2353
01:57:50,492 --> 01:57:53,225
* I TOOK
A LITTLE RISK *

2354
01:57:55,392 --> 01:57:58,325
* SEND LAWYERS,
GUNS AND MONEY *

2355
01:58:00,225 --> 01:58:03,058
* DAD, GET ME OUT OF THIS

2356
01:58:03,058 --> 01:58:04,791
* HAH!

2357
01:58:14,559 --> 01:58:17,791
* I'M THE INNOCENT BYSTANDER *

2358
01:58:19,858 --> 01:58:22,758
* SOMEHOW I GOT STUCK

2359
01:58:25,092 --> 01:58:28,225
* BETWEEN THE ROCK
AND THE HARD PLACE *

2360
01:58:28,225 --> 01:58:31,425
* AND I'M DOWN
ON MY LUCK *

2361
01:58:33,459 --> 01:58:36,791
* YES, I'M DOWN
ON MY LUCK *

2362
01:58:38,626 --> 01:58:41,559
* WELL, I'M DOWN
ON MY LUCK *

2363
01:58:43,925 --> 01:58:46,825


2364
01:58:49,192 --> 01:58:51,559
