1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The joy of geometry - when you realize
everything is right.

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Such regularity.

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,560
I've never been able to enlarge a photograph.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I have friends who do it,
and I trust them.

6
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm just interested in the shot.

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A little lighter this one.

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That is beautiful enlarged.

9
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:41,414
It wasn't easy. What patience,
and that is what you need.

10
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,164
You're patient too.

11
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:46,796
No, it's actually impatience.

12
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,279
Who said years ago,

13
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:57,180
he told photograpers to aim wild,
shoot fast and scram...

14
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,401
the faster the better.

15
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:10,460
I took this book along
to Jean Renoir in 1936.

16
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:17,897
I showed him my pictures
and asked him for a job.

17
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:26,348
That's how I became
his second assistant.

18
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,497
Beckett was the first one and I was the second.

19
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:44,919
He wanted to look all of them one by one

20
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,343
The facial expression.

21
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,593
The attitude.

22
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:54,851
The motion of the hands and feet.

23
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:04,595
Photographs can be very mysterious.

24
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,113
There is a deep mysterious link between

25
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,525
the people and things around them.

26
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:22,022
You picture their lives,
what they're about to do.

27
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:26,933
What they've done
or where they're going.

28
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:45,469
I remember him saying about someone,

29
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,866
he thinks he is a great photographer.

30
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,349
How can he?

31
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:53,895
He just have to live
and then life will give you pictures.

32
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:55,673
You can't live for photography.

33
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:01,503
You have to take pictures
because it fills you with life. That's Henri.

34
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:11,035
Pure coincidence.

35
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:14,313
I was standing on a bridge,

36
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:17,963
for that moment everything fell into place.

37
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:21,493
But only for a split of second.

38
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:28,072
That is photography.
You have to seize the moment.

39
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:32,602
Like here.

40
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:46,400
That's the joy of taking pictures.
Yes, no, yes, no, yes.

41
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,400
That is sacred music.

42
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:52,871
Life, death, everything.
Pure bliss.

43
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:59,977
Here it is!

44
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:08,174
It's one of the first pictures I've seen.

45
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:12,695
Which gave me an idea
about what you can do.

46
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:17,147
About how you can get a good picture

47
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:21,217
without models, without artifice, without anything...

48
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:24,599
but by just simple observation.

49
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:28,438
And it's the first time that I...

50
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:32,079
...remember thinking that

51
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:38,632
you really don't have to know too much
in order to be a photographer.

52
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,561
What you need to do
is simply to look.

53
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,747
Incredible. It's like a picture of a dream.

54
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,202
As if you were dreaming a void
of intersecting lines.

55
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:28,534
And then suddenly, at night, you hear
the sound of an approaching carriage.

56
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,464
It is full of meaning,
but you can't explain it.

57
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:40,002
You don't know where it's going
or where it's coming from.

58
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:47,891
A single instant can reveal all the
ambiguity of visible.

59
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:23,590
A great photo has
a musical feel to it.

60
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,965
It's the feeling that counts.

61
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,815
It's hard to analyze because
it's beyond words and reason.

62
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:47,809
You also sense that its approach
is completely intuitive.

63
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:55,058
And yet there is an order to his pictures.

64
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:58,381
It's a little like theater in fact.

65
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:03,473
Like any form of expression.

66
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:10,566
It is instantaneous, instinctive and constructive.

67
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:13,519
All the same time.

68
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:17,394
I think he's also telling us
about himself

69
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:20,497
when he tells us about the world.

70
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,151
Easter bonnet.

71
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:41,793
I've lived in Harlem for a long time.

72
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:47,843
When hardly any whites were living there.

73
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:10,208
Shot from the window of the car.

74
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:16,312
My friend said "Hey, let's get out of
here before they beat you up!"

75
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,574
Was really dangerous in Mississippi.

76
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,937
I never talked to him about that,

77
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,698
but I suppose he had the feeling...

78
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:47,309
...that this place had
the potential for both

79
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:54,459
tremendous good and tremendous problems, evil.

80
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,845
And he was looking at it.

81
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:15,016
God! What picture he has.

82
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:22,499
America is a place of great extremes.

83
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:30,363
And if you choose to look at the extremes,
it can be very tragic.

84
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,870
God bless America.

85
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:51,863
My passion has never been
for photography in itself,

86
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,249
but for the possibility, by forgetting yourself,
-and this is important-

87
00:14:57,426 --> 00:15:03,572
of capturing in a fraction of  a second the emotion of the subject,
and the beauty of the form.

88
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:07,112
There's a natural geometry in what we see.

89
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:11,373
I don't have a message.
I'm not trying to prove anything.

90
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,923
You see, you feel,
and the surprise eye responds.

91
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,135
To me, taking pictures means discovering
rhythms, lines and gradations in reality.

92
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:38,323
The eye does the framing
and the camera does the work.

93
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,943
It registers the decision the eye makes.

94
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,632
You see a photograph all at once,
like a painting.

95
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:18,773
If the hatches were closed,
she had a client.

96
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:26,469
Calle Cuauhtemoctzin in Mexico City.

97
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:49,256
The chineses took that bird
to the cafe with them

98
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:53,935
and an ultramarine cover
protected them from the lights.

99
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:11,663
The last eunuch.
Just before the communists came.

100
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:42,348
The most beautiful gift
Matísse could make.

101
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:47,508
The first time I saw
"Images à la Sauvette"

102
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,225
was at Leonardo Sciascia house.

103
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:53,944
He had the book. And then I did something terrible.

104
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:56,564
Since I didn't have a copy of my own.

105
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:58,283
I photographed every single page.

106
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:01,645
I assimilated the photographs
through the lens of the camera.

107
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,075
So, sometimes when I was working

108
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,569
I couldn't remember if
I shot the picture myself.

109
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:14,378
Or whether was one of the pictures
from the Cartier-Bresson's Books.

110
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:23,240
It was almost as if I had digested them,
consumed them, rather than seeing.

111
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:33,859
She doesn't need a passport.
You can tell she is british.

112
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,418
A ball.

113
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:49,156
The movement.

114
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:06,141
All together.

115
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:17,098
Do you see the pigs?
They're interested in everything.

116
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:19,817
That was the mouth of the Rhine.

117
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:38,543
He shows what amuses him too.

118
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,517
He was everywhere, incredible.

119
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:08,083
Fishermen near Suzdal in Russia.

120
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:26,738
He always said "Eye, mind
and heart have to be aligned.".

121
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:30,653
I still use that criterion
to judge photographs,

122
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:33,003
my own and those of my colleges.

123
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:38,615
Sometimes in his pictures,
formal elements dominate.

124
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,973
The eye, a conceptual approach.

125
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,873
Other times is the emotion, the heart.

126
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:54,923
Pictures of that kind are more ideological,
propagandistic, narrative.

127
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:58,323
When he concentrate on aesthetics and form,

128
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:02,941
the result is what Henri calls patterns.

129
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:12,180
So his dictum is a excellent critical tool,

130
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,930
to determine whether he achieved
what easier said than done.

131
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:20,688
The balance between eye, mind and heart.

132
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:29,785
But what counts is geometry and structure.
Everything where it should be.

133
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:35,829
To me geometry is the foundation.
Everybody has feelings.

134
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:46,848
They know how to act.

135
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:50,298
They're professionals.

136
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,729
The eye encounters reality
at the decisive moment.

137
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,950
It's not just movement.

138
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:14,548
The moment is decisive

139
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:21,434
because it shows that the photographer
also recognises the formal aspect of things.

140
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,470
Whether it's a landscape
or just a fleeting expression.

141
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:44,579
When you hit the target,
there is no need to crop the picture.

142
00:22:57,925 --> 00:23:01,925
To question by looking and the sense of form.

143
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,647
People think, think, think.

144
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:07,147
In all directions, but they think.

145
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:10,283
A questioning engaged is rare.

146
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:13,687
Alberto Giacometti and E. Teriade

147
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:23,054
And there is a beautiful picture of Marilyn here.

148
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:29,488
In "The Misfits".

149
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:34,514
I remember that one.

150
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,830
There it is.

151
00:23:39,464 --> 00:23:42,564
Yeah, she was beautiful.

152
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,830
It was the first day of shooting.
First day.

153
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,673
She is thinking about something.

154
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:56,680
She is not simple posing for a picture.

155
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:00,007
She is preoccupied with something.

156
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,742
I don't know what it was, but was something.

157
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,040
Also, she is very alive in the picture.

158
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:15,129
It's her basic intelligence in that picture.

159
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,457
It's a very introspective picture, I think.

160
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:24,743
It's her, it is the way she was.

161
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,928
He is about to take off.

162
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,871
Is he heading for us?
His head lowered.

163
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:54,151
Beat the time.
But which tempo?

164
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:57,351
In any case he is putting up a good fight.

165
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,240
So many memories on this pieces of paper.
An accumulation of things.

166
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:24,686
Alexander Shneider

167
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,380
Beckett

168
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:41,835
When I was a little boy I annoyed my grandfather

169
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:45,334
by playing Stravinsky's rite of spring
on the gramophone.

170
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:55,411
I liked him a lot, Calder.

171
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:05,086
You couldn't understand
a word he was saying.

172
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:19,456
I like doing portraits.

173
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:30,425
Saul Steinberg

174
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:41,976
Basically, you just have to make
people forget the camera.

175
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:43,940
It's no different for you.

176
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:58,458
It was early morning, no not that early.

177
00:26:59,108 --> 00:27:01,108
He sat opposite me.

178
00:27:01,157 --> 00:27:03,757
We were talking.
Until he pick up his camera.

179
00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:09,651
He shot some pictures, just a few.
And showed to me.

180
00:27:16,492 --> 00:27:20,192
One picture stood out.
When he sat across from me,

181
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:24,032
I had the feeling that he saw something
in me which I wasn't aware.

182
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,260
Something I would not discover.

183
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,630
Probably, I know myself pretty well.
And what I look like in pictures.

184
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:41,651
I've been photographed so much.

185
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:46,055
But something completely unexpected
happened with him.

186
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:48,384
It was a moment of truth.

187
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:15,429
Of course, because for Bonnard,
it's not only the eye, everything counts.

188
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,550
All wrapped up.

189
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,923
He said "Why did you just pressed the release?"

190
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:45,573
I answered "Why did you painted the yellow patch there?"

191
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:47,823
He laughed.

192
00:28:52,421 --> 00:28:56,821
Portraits are the most difficult.
Everything is so fleeting.

193
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:03,655
You can't say "Give me that smile again".

194
00:29:04,883 --> 00:29:06,883
It's madame Chanel.

195
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:10,133
A split second later her smile has vanished.

196
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:19,705
And her face was hard as nail.

197
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:26,587
I made the mistake of mention a old lady.
A friend of mine, Mary Louise.

198
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:29,663
They couldn't stand each other.

199
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:33,641
I don't mind making a gaffe, but that...

200
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:42,497
Her face was distorted like this.

201
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:21,204
My God, how I miss Mexico.

202
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:25,527
The intensity and passion.

203
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:38,528
There were whores at night,
making love on the street.

204
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:50,031
And by day, the sound of a hammer.

205
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,651
The carpenter making coffins.

206
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:56,135
"Calle de Ecuador"

207
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:09,481
When I left Czechoslovakia,

208
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:12,399
you said something that was
very important to me.

209
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:19,788
You said "take care of your eye".

210
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:23,380
You always said that after a while

211
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,905
many photographers no longer have a good eye.

212
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,218
If I've had succeed in preserving my eye,

213
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:32,938
then it's really thanks to you.

214
00:32:41,463 --> 00:32:49,212
I came here, in Czechoslovakia there was no
agency like Magnum and no photojournalism.

215
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:55,827
I joined Magnum and I sensed that
you liked my photographs.

216
00:32:56,425 --> 00:33:01,225
You liked my work and I sensed you liked me too.

217
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,449
How lucky I am to have met both of you.

218
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:09,849
I want to thank you.

219
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:20,034
To friendship and love and both together.

220
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:12,283
That is Truman Capote.
I had no idea he once looked like that.

221
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,508
Like an angel.
Such a long time ago.

222
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:25,359
He doesn't take pictures of silence.

223
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,379
It is the time after the last
word has been spoken.

224
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:32,811
He listens to the silence that follows speech.

225
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,132
That's different.

226
00:34:37,632 --> 00:34:40,954
And maybe that's exactly what
he captures in his pictures.

227
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:43,296
The moment that comes out of movement.

228
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:55,098
His picture is never ever static.

229
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:26,121
What treasure!

230
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:35,294
See, you can't pose things like that.
It's not possible.

231
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:42,597
The best way to take portrait is
to spend a little time with people

232
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:44,797
and just sit with them.

233
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:49,322
Then see what happens.

234
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:00,558
From most refined to most mundane.

235
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:06,599
His eye makes no distinction,
you can see their best on the portraits.

236
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:11,154
He chooses celebrities and farmers,
and workers on the street.

237
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:15,083
And he treats them all
with the same compassion.

238
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:19,727
It reminds me of stand out,
get close enough to feel something.

239
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:24,264
Yet remain detached enough
not to get too involved.

240
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:45,017
Under the doorbell "Enter without knocking."
I did and that's what I saw.

241
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:52,068
I took the shot before I said "hello".
I said "hello" afterwards.

242
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:59,795
But when I saw that,
I couldn't resist.

243
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:07,627
You can't force things,
if you do you're lost.

244
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:17,189
He's right and actually the same thing
applies to what I do.

245
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:20,544
Things happen quickly or not at all,

246
00:37:20,844 --> 00:37:25,868
easily and effortlessly, you can't will it,
it just happens.

247
00:37:26,502 --> 00:37:31,213
It's the same in photography
either something happens or doesn't.

248
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:07,139
The best thing is to shoot a few pictures,
to breach the silence.

249
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:10,263
It puts citizens at ease,
if they're having a hard time.

250
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:13,483
Ok, that's it.
And then.

251
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:21,202
There is no law - no rule.

252
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:33,365
I have one basic principle: don't repeat yourself.

253
00:38:34,598 --> 00:38:39,218
And when I find that something works,
it means that I have to change directions.

254
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:43,536
I have to destroy the rule
and start from scratch again.

255
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:47,240
Sometimes I think that's why Henri,
even if there is other reasons,

256
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:50,208
started drawing again.

257
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,676
That's for tomorrow.

258
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:26,019
And that was yesterday. Does it work?

259
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:52,537
Just sketches.

260
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:12,598
Scribbling.

261
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,151
Look!

262
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:24,104
André de Mandiargues

263
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:30,408
A childhood friend.

264
00:40:31,758 --> 00:40:33,458
A good drawing.

265
00:40:45,157 --> 00:40:48,574
Collage pasted with gum of
a rubber tree 1931,

266
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:52,092
Ivory Coast on the Cavalier river

267
00:40:55,316 --> 00:41:01,266
For love and against industrial labour.

268
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:10,912
Africa made a deep impression on me.

269
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:18,007
And against colonialism, it's outrageous.

270
00:41:27,058 --> 00:41:33,292
Mélanie - our daughter.

271
00:41:55,549 --> 00:42:01,084
To keep myself calm, a watercolor
I painted in Lyon,

272
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:06,920
while waiting for my contact
to bring my false papers.

273
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:13,363

274
273
00:42:18,722 --> 00:42:20,722
And I got them.

275
00:42:52,592 --> 00:42:55,810
My first wife sent me this copy in 1942,

276
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,129
and I had it with me when I escaped 1943.

277
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:15,534
That book always kept me company
on the prison camp.

278
00:43:24,223 --> 00:43:27,845
They wrapped this paper around the bars.

279
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:32,594
I used it to make a cover to my poems.

280
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:39,855
I worked in 30 different commands,
always trying to find a way to escape.

281
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:45,428
My citizenship is still a little
like escaped prisoner,

282
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:48,024
cannot be rehabilitated.

283
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:16,107
I don't take pictures anymore,
at least not on the street.

284
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:20,633
I don't care about much anymore,
I rather draw, there is more envolved.

285
00:44:27,026 --> 00:44:29,026
The light is too harsh now.

286
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:38,010
Till next time.

287
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:51,336
The liberation of Paris.

288
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,760
A girl who was working for the GESTAPO.

289
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:17,481
It was awful.

290
00:45:19,981 --> 00:45:24,347
She was screaming
"Don't kill me, I tell you everything".

291
00:45:29,115 --> 00:45:31,635
The separation between
East and West in Dessau.

292
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:37,081
In a camp the two have been separated.

293
00:45:49,063 --> 00:45:53,987
The Berlin Wall, very important.

294
00:46:01,943 --> 00:46:04,655
They're waiting to see a curtain at the window.

295
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,987
Relatives giving a signal.

296
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:19,778
The Berlin Wall, it's incredible.

297
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:25,427
Till there, children playing, life goes on.

298
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:29,880
Innocent because they're children,
innocent to violence.

299
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:36,733
But there is despair as well and
a kind of helplessness.

300
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:40,669
A decency of human too.

301
00:46:40,892 --> 00:46:44,720
There is something whimsical,
ironical about the three man on the pedestal.

302
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,591
All of his photographs are like that.

303
00:47:21,722 --> 00:47:24,434
Borobudur Temple

304
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:30,464
Sumatra

305
00:47:33,198 --> 00:47:34,998
And this one.

306
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:41,998
They're moving.

307
00:47:46,606 --> 00:47:50,639
They're getting rid of the portraits of
Dutch governors - Independence.

308
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,579
The end of colonialism.

309
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:03,299
There is not a single moment in
Cartier-Bresson work,

310
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:07,080
that makes you want to say
"he shouldn't had done that".

311
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:11,147
He somehow has an innate feeling for politics.

312
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:14,085
He didn't just happen to be in China
when the Kuomintang collapse

313
00:48:14,285 --> 00:48:16,803
and the communist marched in.

314
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,732
And he wouldn't be in India,
precisely when Gandhi died

315
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:27,785
without has an incredible nose for
international political events.

316
00:48:31,155 --> 00:48:34,155
Gandhi on his deathbed.
Here as well.

317
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:46,283
I showed Gandhi a book of photographs,
because I was to portray him the following day.

318
00:48:46,731 --> 00:48:49,531
So I wanted him to see how I work.

319
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,880
He looked one picture for a long time.

320
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:05,139
Then he asked me,
"What does this picture mean?".

321
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:07,812
I said "That's Claudel".

322
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,362
And briefly explained what Claudel
meant to me,

323
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:15,511
and I taking the picture in Brangues.

324
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:26,452
And Gandhi said "Death, death, death".
And that's all.

325
00:49:25,802 --> 00:49:30,726
I said goodbye.
Our conversation had last a quarter of an hour.

326
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:36,776
A few minutes later, he left,
he went outside and he was killed.

327
00:50:02,114 --> 00:50:06,377
I had to get out of there fast,
my foot was close to the funeral pyre.

328
00:50:06,627 --> 00:50:08,127
The fire was already burning.

329
00:50:25,842 --> 00:50:28,619
Nehru announcing the Gandhi's death.

330
00:50:47,471 --> 00:50:53,913
He sensed death,
but it isn't sad.

331
00:50:54,163 --> 00:50:58,280
It has a finality, doesn't it?

332
00:51:19,123 --> 00:51:21,365
I always had a passion for painting.

333
00:51:21,615 --> 00:51:25,034
When I was a child I painted
Thursdays and Saturdays.

334
00:51:25,434 --> 00:51:26,954
The rest of time I claimed about it.

335
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:52,123
The quality of that red.

336
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:20,076
A photo is like the stab of a knife,
painting is meditation.

337
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,497
When I was a child I used to
come here to draw that.

338
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:39,955
Copying Rubens is good practice.

339
00:52:54,612 --> 00:52:59,623
Teriade's finger, a vessel by Picasso and Matisse.

340
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:04,579
The secret is there.

341
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:26,039
I love Matisse with a pigeon,

342
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:28,175
and not just because it's a picture of Matisse.

343
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:30,431
I like a lot of thing about the picture,

344
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:33,012
the tragedy of an old man, animals.

345
00:53:33,081 --> 00:53:37,781
There are so much in it.
Everybody can see something else in it.

346
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:20,067
I especially like this one.

347
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:28,895
......... statue.[corrigir]

348
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:49,334
An italian countess,
I forgot her name.

349
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,656
I like this alot.

350
00:55:10,115 --> 00:55:15,296
Matisse with Teriade and Elytis.
A greek poet.

351
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:23,193
And madame Lydia.

352
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,050
There was plenty of glitz in
America in the 60s and 70s,

353
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,462
yes and in the 40s, the era of these pictures.

354
00:55:32,993 --> 00:55:39,533
But clearly Cartier-Bresson was trying to get
behind it to the substance of American society.

355
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:43,823
And since his is fundamentally
a tragic vision,

356
00:55:44,023 --> 00:55:46,894
he reacted most feelingly
to what in America

357
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:51,153
he saw as related to its decay, its pain.

358
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:53,965
The very horizon is often oppressive,

359
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:59,128
jagged with junked cars,
the detritus of consumer culture,

360
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:05,109
which after all is a culture of planned
waste, engineered obsolescence.

361
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,363
Whatever lasts is boring,

362
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:12,068
what demands its ownreplacement
energizes our imaginations.

363
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:16,701
These are painful ironic pictures of the
United States

364
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:21,185
before Reagan’s ‘Morning in America’
made it difficult,

365
00:56:21,368 --> 00:56:25,668
if not impermissible, to take a straight look at
real life on this continent.

366
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:35,813
Since the Seventies the United States
has become a different culture.

367
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:40,756
The urgency behind these pictures now
seems archaic.

368
00:56:40,803 --> 00:56:45,995
We are tired of so much knowing,
we want diversion.

369
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:52,515
These images ask the inevitable question...
what is our next chapter?

370
00:56:52,765 --> 00:56:54,572
Where do we go from here?

371
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:58,329
And can the new impulse,
whatever it's mode,

372
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:02,244
come forth with such rooted beauty?

373
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,733
It was the 4th of July.

374
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:16,933
The woman said "That's day you put
the flag on your heart".

375
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:46,984
I was in trouble.

376
00:57:54,661 --> 00:57:56,683
The USSR army.

377
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:04,680
Terrible trouble. I didn't realize.

378
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,287
I took this picture because the subject
interested me.

379
00:58:08,923 --> 00:58:12,243
I didn't know that something secret
was going on over there.

380
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:20,031
Then my interpret told me
it would be better to vanish

381
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,472
because of what was happening in the woods.

382
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:29,974
You never know what you're getting into.

383
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,131
I was at a reception yesterday,

384
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:51,242
I looked at the people's legs,

385
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:55,179
especially the women's
they reminded me of this.

386
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:07,650
The impact of the horizontal lances - incredible.

387
00:59:16,923 --> 00:59:19,437
It has to do with mathematics.

388
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:26,995
What science!

389
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:43,702
What can you do after this?

390
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:46,950
Get good and drunk.

391
00:59:52,474 --> 00:59:55,092
And Piero della Francesca as well.

392
00:59:57,032 --> 00:59:59,640
Paolo Uccello and Piero are the highlights for me.

393
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:17,173
The most difficult thing in photography,
and probably in other fields as well.

394
01:01:17,445 --> 01:01:20,360
Is to look what you've done with complete detachment.

395
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,216
To see as a piece of paper.

396
01:01:23,003 --> 01:01:26,221
Forget the music and how difficult it was.

397
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:29,539
Just look at it. Nothing is more difficult.

398
01:01:29,572 --> 01:01:32,439
That's why people who have
a good eye, also important,

399
01:01:32,739 --> 01:01:35,406
they can evaluate what someone else has done.

400
01:01:35,656 --> 01:01:38,056
That's why Delpire was so
important to Henri

401
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:40,256
and also to me.

402
01:01:45,652 --> 01:01:49,904
These two photographs are typical.
This one is pure form.

403
01:01:50,218 --> 01:01:55,105
And when you turn the page.
You see women praying in Kashmir.

404
01:01:55,148 --> 01:01:57,170
And you note two things.

405
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:02,093
The regular form and the desire to grasp
the meaning of the situation.

406
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,038
Taking pictures means holding
your breath.

407
01:02:45,238 --> 01:02:49,006
With all your faculties focused on capturing fleeting reality.

408
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:53,572
It is then that mastering an image becomes
a great physical and intellectual joy.

409
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:16,535
Carson McCullers

410
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:35,485
It's hard to choose any of them.

411
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:10,963
A good photo tells lots of stories.

412
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,730
And different people tell different stories.

413
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,449
A single picture, lots of stories.

414
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:19,018
To me, that makes a good photograph.

415
01:04:19,873 --> 01:04:23,188
Henri's best pictures are exactly like that.

416
01:04:24,897 --> 01:04:29,464
It is not important if these women are prostitute
or lesbian, that's unimportant.

417
01:04:29,614 --> 01:04:32,264
Even if knowing affects the way
you look the picture.

418
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:34,714
A good photo is a good photo.

419
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:51,071
I'm looking for a picture.
I don't know where it is anymore.

420
01:04:51,118 --> 01:04:53,027
It's one I really like,

421
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,933
because it so accurately expresses the time
he spent with surrealists

422
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:59,018
and his interest in them.

423
01:04:59,268 --> 01:05:02,586
Aesthetically the picture is so surrealist,

424
01:05:02,886 --> 01:05:06,305
and yet the expression is still typical
of Cartier-Bresson.

425
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:19,699
Amazing this one, no title,
no body, no title.

426
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:23,057
After your feelings were liberated
from all influences.

427
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:37,503
This picture taken in Livorno,
it always makes me feel uneasy.

428
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:41,799
It's easy to talk about "objective chance"
and all that.

429
01:05:42,186 --> 01:05:45,159
But it takes so much to see
everything at once.

430
01:05:45,259 --> 01:05:48,232
With all the balance, the relationships.

431
01:05:48,237 --> 01:05:52,237
All the narrative contains the ambiguity
and obscurity,

432
01:05:53,137 --> 01:05:54,937
even though it's so obvious.

433
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:04,820
The young black child running, how often have I tried
to take that picture again.

434
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,208
I love this picture.

435
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:31,534
In Bangalore I've met the
greatest mathematicians.

436
01:06:44,483 --> 01:06:49,613
And at the same time, a boy
came by in a bicycle.

437
01:06:49,863 --> 01:07:00,255
The Bhagwan is dead.
I get on my bike right to the Ashram.

438
01:07:01,013 --> 01:07:05,548
At 30 minutes to nine, the Bhagwan's fan has stopped.

439
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:17,877
I live from day to day.

440
01:07:20,317 --> 01:07:22,228
The past is a tabula rasa.

441
01:07:26,452 --> 01:07:30,158
But usually comes back like a burp.

442
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:51,119
Memory is so strange.

443
01:07:54,343 --> 01:07:56,755
Proust had a lot to say about that.

444
01:08:12,897 --> 01:08:15,319
You can't never find a picture when you are looking for.

445
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:16,750
It's the same as taking pictures,

446
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:20,432
you can't find when you are
looking for them.

447
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:24,360
And they come and bite you.

448
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:10,714
That is so long ago. And still so immediate.

449
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:16,971
That's why there is no such thing as death.

450
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:22,162
Everything lives on.

451
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,348
Suddenly scenes come back to the mind’s eye.

452
01:09:57,983 --> 01:10:00,505
Either you get it or you don't.
