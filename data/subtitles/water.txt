00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,243
My Child.

2
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,577
Child.

3
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:32,912
Do you remember getting married?

4
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,506
No.

5
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:39,077
Your husband is dead.

6
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:42,348
You're a widow now.

7
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,609
For how long, Ether?

8
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,011
Chuyia!

9
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,908
Chuyia!

10
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,272
Let's go home, Father.

11
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,109
This is your home now.

12
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,413
Then m/here is Ma?

13
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,538
Where is Ma?

14
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,105
Where is Ma?

15
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,904
Come on.

16
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:04,606
Don't leave me here.

17
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,545
Let me go.

18
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:13,613
I'm not staying here.

19
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:17,411
Quiet.

20
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,576
Shut her mouth.

21
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,205
Hey you m/hore.

22
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,611
You haven't fed my parrot Mitthu.

23
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:33,676
Didi, there are no lentils.

24
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:34,768
What! No lentils?

25
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:37,404
Then go buy some.

26
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,007
No lentils!

27
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,535
Kunti, let her go.

28
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:45,543
You. Come here.

29
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,370
Go.

30
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:47,975
You poor thing.

31
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,673
Howl feel for you.

32
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:52,871
I ms also young...

33
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,880
m/hen my bastard husband died.

34
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:58,413
Come sit here.

35
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:04,173
In grief, we are all sisters here...

36
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:07,544
and this house is our refuge.

37
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,044
I vwnt my mother.

38
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,679
Our Holy Books say.

39
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,509
A wife is part of her husband.

40
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,080
M/hile he's alive.

41
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,276
Right?

42
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,536
<i>And when husbands die.</i>

43
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,045
God help us.

44
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,944
Wives also half die.

45
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,213
So how can a half-dead woman feel pain?

46
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,511
Because she's half alive?

47
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,110
Don't try and be too clever...

48
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:44,071
or I'll throw you into the river!

49
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,871
I don't vwnt to be a stupid widow. Fatty!

50
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:46,843
What did you say?

51
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,537
She bites like a little bitch!

52
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,340
What are you staring at? Catch her.

53
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:53,503
Ass Iickers!

54
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,206
Are your arms and legs broken?

55
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,278
Catch her!

56
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,701
Let her go.

57
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,345
But, Madhu Didi...

58
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,235
Leave.

59
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,870
Come here.

60
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,744
Come here.

61
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,103
Turn around and sit.

62
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:04,673
It's Turmeric.

63
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:07,112
It cools the head.

64
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,337
You saved me like the Goddess Durga.

65
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,371
Sharp teeth and a sharper imagination.

66
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:21,108
Go, sit in the sun.

67
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,177
Are you deaf?

68
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,709
They'll throw me in the river.

69
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:30,343
Only if you bite someone else.

70
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,269
Come here little one.

71
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,072
What's your name?

72
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,710
Chuyia.

73
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:59,776
Chuyia the mouse...

74
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:04,843
...the mouse with sharp teeth.

75
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,873
What's your name?

76
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,944
My husband embraced eternity.

77
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:14,675
And Iefl behind Patiraji.

78
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,338
You can call me Auntie.

79
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:26,775
You really made that fit cow dance.

80
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,405
Do you have a sweet?

81
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,837
Awake or asleep,

82
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:47,209
even in dreams. all I see are sweets.

83
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:48,578
You're back?

84
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,044
Water?

85
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:18,543
UP here!

86
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,171
An angel!

87
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,508
Close your eyes.

88
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,346
Close them.

89
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,838
His name is Kaalu.

90
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,609
You can playwith him anytime.

91
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,577
You feed him.

92
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,610
He has ﬂeas. I should bathe him.

93
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:45,843
Downstairs?

94
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,503
No silly.

95
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,375
Dogs aren't allowed here.

96
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,774
They're a bad omen.

97
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,410
Don't tell anyone about Kaalu.

98
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:59,105
But I'm not staying here.

99
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,612
My mother's coming to get me.

100
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,079
If not today, tomorrow For sure.

101
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:23,711
Krishna, this is my Friend.

102
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,007
What's your name?

103
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,574
Chuyia.

104
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,105
Can he hear you?

105
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,576
Of course. He hears everything.

106
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,712
What did he say?

107
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,779
He says you won't be here long.

108
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:46,535
I told you so.

109
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,744
In a day, chantjai shree krishna.

110
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,837
A hundred and eight times, and soon...

111
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:55,503
You'll ﬂy away!

112
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,513
But I can only count to ten.

113
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,677
This has one hundred and eight beads.

114
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:12,208
Why don't you start the prayer?

115
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,170
Mat...

116
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,772
While the priest ms reciting the vows,

117
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,911
I started to laugh.

118
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:27,575
Ma slapped me hard.

119
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,538
And than until the end...

120
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,613

Plump m/hite rasgullas.

127
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:52,608
Piping hot gulabjamuns.

128
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,170
The saliva ms drooling out of my mouth.

129
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,941
Yellow Iadoos.

130
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,639

Covered with gold leaf.

133
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:11,105
Life is so disappointing.

134
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:33,710
Good, ﬂeas and sins washed away.

135
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:40,171

141
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,069
What are you doing?

142
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:22,276
Widows shouldn't run around like unmarried girls.

143
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,735
You've polluted me! I have to bathe again.

144
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,075
Catch him.

145
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,942

Yes.

147
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,736
He doesn't like to bathe.

148
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:33,605
What's wrong?

149
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:38,575

Kalyani, I found him.

159
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:24,534
Always running around...

161
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,213

00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:41,171
Let's go.

163
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:46,174
Where do you live?

164
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,175
I mean... I'm not asking m/here you live, but...

165
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:53,680
asking if you are lost...

166
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,441
than I could take you m/here you live.

167
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,670
She lives in a house of widows,

168
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,337
I'm just visiting her.

169
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:04,913
Chuyia, tell him not to follow us, it'll be a sin.

170
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:06,002
It'll be a sin!

171
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,510
But m/here is this house of widows?

172
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,772
I don't know.

173
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:10,369
Ask her if she knows.

174
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:12,337
Ask her if she knows!

175
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:14,368
Dharma Ghat.

176
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:15,775
Next to the river.

177
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,876
God bless you.

179
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,207
How did your exams go?

181
00:24:58,767 --> 00:24:59,939
Double Fail.

182
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,278

Live long be happy.

184
00:25:12,134 --> 00:25:15,672
Master, should I unpack for you?

185
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:16,268
No.

186
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,105
Sadhuramji.

187
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:30,008
Don't get drunk with this.

188
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:34,344
My hands haven't touched the bottle for years.

189
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,541
Make sure your lips don't either!

190
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:21,012
My husband the old bastard ms so horny...

191
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,273
the minute he climbed on me...

192
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:25,108
instead of coming...

193
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,271
he went, straight to Heaven.

194
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,313
Bastard!

195
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,175
Pleasing himself in Heaven.

196
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,508
And Iefl me stuck in Hell.

197
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,578
Poor man.

198
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,611
Poor who?

199
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,234
Poor you I mean.

200
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,308
Didi, have you heard?

201
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,003
What?

202
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,602
That Mohandas...

203
00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:52,006
Mohandas who? Is he a new client?

204
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,603
No Mohandas Gandhi.

205
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:56,608
He's come From the jungles oFAFrica.

206
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,577
He doesn't drink, he doesn't sleep.

207
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,041
Why? Doesn't he feel sleepy?

208
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,010
No. He doesn't sleep with women.

209
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,777
For discipline he says.

210
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:08,773
Why are you still here?

211
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,109
Take her to Seth Dvwrkanath.

212
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,540
Standing there and gossiping.

213
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,577
Hand it over.

214
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,174
Long live Lord Shiva!

215
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:04,069
There she goes.

216
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,508
There goes who?

217
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,105
A m/hore.

218
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:10,903
To meet a client.

219
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:12,672
Perhaps my Father.

220
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,838
Does she look like a m/hore?

221
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:17,880
She's a widow, you fool.

222
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:19,268
I know.

223
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:21,707
The gentry here.

224
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:28,115
Have an 'unnatural concern' forwidows.

225
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:38,910
Gulabi...

226
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,877
Does Lord Krishna take on human form?

227
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,941
Of course he does.

228
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:50,537
Haven't you seen us re-enact his life story?

229
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,375
He plays himself.

230
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,672
M/hile I play his adoring milkmaid!

231
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:07,048
<i>My father doesn't even bother with thew names.</i>

232
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:08,408
There's the old one.

233
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:10,041
The fit one.

234
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,108
The new one.

235
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,879
The young one.

236
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:18,410
Rabindra.

237
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:22,044
You should get your Father to join Gandhi.

238
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:25,774
Seth Bhupindernath and Gandhi...

239
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,244
hand in hand...

240
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,645
liberate the widows oflndia.

241
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,804
You can laugh.

242
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,040
You don't have an oaf For a Father.

243
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:35,508
No, definitely not.

244
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,580
Have you thought of joining the Congress?

245
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:52,973
Are you crazy?

246
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:56,947
I happen to like English vwys.

247
00:29:57,034 --> 00:30:01,505
Their cricket, their whiskey...

248
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,007
and m/hat poets they have!

249
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:14,348
If Gandhi can Free India, then think

250
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:19,882
how Byron would sound.

251
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:23,244
Recited by a Free man.

252
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:28,605
You haven't become a Nationalist have you?

253
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:34,770
Passive resistance.

254
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,208
An intriguing concept.

255
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:40,841
Forget it.

256
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:45,506
Romantics make terrible Nationalists.

257
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:56,014
O Sacred River...

258
00:30:56,933 --> 00:31:01,939
Radiant like the moon...

259
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:04,778
Home of the Eminent...

260
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,972
Home...

261
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:09,741
When do we stop praying?

262
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,211
Don't you have a dry sari?

263
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,779
It's in your house.

264
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,401
Bring it tomorrow.

265
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:40,180
Tomorrow I'll be in myawm house.

266
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:58,342
A new widow.

267
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,474
Sit up straight!

268
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:00,944
Don't scold her.

269
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:02,936
She's just a child.

270
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,278
Child indeed!

271
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:09,340
She's turned the house upside down.

272
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:32,277
Where is the house for men widows?

273
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:33,905
Good God!

274
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,847
What a horrible thing to say.

275
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:39,277
God protect our men From such a Fate.

276
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,779
May your tongue burn.

277
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:45,540
Pull out her tongue and throw it in the river.

278
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,440
Kunti, where's my food?

279
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,277
Coming Didi.

280
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,705
Where is Kalyani?

281
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,773
You and your questions.

282
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,935
Witch.

283
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,268
Shut up.

284
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,871
Black tongue.

285
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:45,443
Eat slowiy.

286
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:48,879
Chew each grain.

287
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:53,240
Your next meal is tomorrow.

288
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,112
With her uncut hair and clients...

289
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,176
eating with Kalyani would pollute our food...

290
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:02,708
Right?

291
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,579
I don't even remember being seven.

292
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,873
What did you say?

293
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:53,340
She says, she doesn't remember being seven.

294
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,237
Ask ma.

295
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,774
I remember.

296
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:05,984
I got married m/hen I ms seven.

297
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,338
Plump juicy rasgullas.

298
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:12,608
Piping hot gulabjamuns,

299
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,704
cashew-nut sweets.

300
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,941
Covered with gold leaf.

301
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:21,709
Yellow Iadoos.

302
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,702
Dripping in butter.

303
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:27,680
late them all m/hen I ms seven.

304
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:18,774
What do you vwnt?

305
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:21,242
Uh, is... Chuyia here?

306
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,412
Are you a relative?

307
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,710
A Friend.

308
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,670
Men are not allowed here.

309
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:40,278
Can't you match m/hat you're doing?

310
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,204
Please forgive us.

311
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:46,980
No... it's all right.

312
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:48,978
You can do it again if you vwnt!

313
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:56,675
Where did she go?

314
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,101
She's hiding.

315
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,078
Gone!

316
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,010
Watch it!

317
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,046
Don't let your shadow touch the bride!

318
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:45,210
Such ignorance.

319
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:50,075
It's this ignorance that is our misfortune.

320
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,713
Shakuntula, you've been doing this service for many years.

321
00:41:18,134 --> 00:41:23,948
So many years of sacrifice and devotion.

322
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:30,175
Do you feel closer to self liberation?

323
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:52,939
If...

324
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,407
self liberation means...

325
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,409
detachment From worldly desires.

326
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,704
Then no. I'm no closer.

327
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:10,777
Whatever happens...

328
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:13,507
never lose your Faith.

329
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:18,940
Never lose your Faith.

330
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,244
I hate you!

331
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,908
She's still not used to this.

332
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:33,508
Get lost.

333
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:34,745
I have money.

334
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:38,911
Widows don't eat Fried Food.

335
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,007
What do you vwnt?

336
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,508
Speak up.

337
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,271
Hail Lord Shiva!

338
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,041
Auntie. Auntie.

339
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,376
What is it little mouse?

340
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,039
A Iadoo!

341
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,679
Chuyia!

342
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:03,179
Where are you?

343
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:32,271
Well done my Chuyia.

344
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,508
Do my feet now.

345
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,106
Yes, Didi.

346
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:43,511
Gently.

347
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:45,376
My skin is like satin.

348
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,274
Ifa mosquito sits on me. it creates a crater.

349
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:51,808
Ask Gulabi.

350
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,709
I always keep my promises.

351
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,844
Always.

352
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,871
If she says she'll send you home,

353
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,275
than she will.

354
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:01,945
Did you know?

355
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:02,842
Know m/hat?

356
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:05,471
This Gandhi is going to sink India.

357
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,205
What's he done now?

358
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,214
He says the Untouchables are...

359
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,711
children of God.

360
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,040
Disgusting!

361
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:18,511
Before he came everything ran like an English clock.

362
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,704
You'll be seen.

363
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:12,269
Take me back.

364
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:14,244
Are you insane?

365
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:16,569
I vwnt to go back.

366
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,710
Then you can tell the client.

367
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,940
To shut someone': mouth during a recital...

368
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:42,009
is an insult Narayan!

369
00:47:52,934 --> 00:47:54,208
Who's that?

370
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:58,274
A eunuch.

371
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,110
My Father's pimp.

372
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:04,508
In English... a procurer.

373
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:09,680
There's a Famous saying.

374
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:14,038
Widows, bulls, slippery steps and holy men.

375
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:17,606
Avoid these, and Liberation awaits.

376
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,278
Can't you ever be serious?

377
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:55,008
Say you had a wife...

378
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,340
I'm not married.

379
00:48:56,634 --> 00:49:00,275
Just imagine you were... and she died.

380
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:03,541
And everything you've cared for

381
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:06,205
is taken away From you.

382
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:08,779
If you hadn't met that widow.

383
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:11,507
You wouldn't be such a champion of their cause.

384
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,444
I don't even know how to see her again.

385
00:49:19,034 --> 00:49:21,537
Stand beneath her balcony.

386
00:49:21,634 --> 00:49:23,307
But don't quote Romeo.

387
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,870
People here don't know Shakespeare.

388
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:29,174
You really are a Brown Englishman.

389
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,773
I'll tell you one thing Rabindra.

390
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:36,043
Your precious English are not going to last.

391
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,180
And m/ho': going to take their place?

392
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:40,274
Your Gandhi?

393
00:50:10,134 --> 00:50:12,614
Take me outside.

394
00:50:12,934 --> 00:50:15,278
You'll be all right. Sleep now.

395
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,438
Take me outside.

396
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,907
I vwnt a Iadoo.

397
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,402
Try to sleep.

398
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:36,775
<i>Du you want water'?</i>

399
00:50:40,567 --> 00:50:42,513
I vwnt to die in the open.

400
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,374
No.

401
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:51,843
We should take her outside.

402
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,874
Aunty is so lucky.

403
00:51:23,433 --> 00:51:26,004
Brahmin widows keeping vigil.

404
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:28,772
And that too For Free.

405
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,737
Shakuntala.

406
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:38,235
Holy Water.

407
00:51:42,734 --> 00:51:44,771
Get some water From the river.

408
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:46,068
Hurry!

409
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:24,174
Remember me? Narayan.

410
00:52:24,534 --> 00:52:25,512
Yes.

411
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,406
Is Kalyani inside?

412
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:29,575
Yes.

413
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,204
I have to go.

414
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,703
Wait.

415
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,570
Give this to Kalyani.

416
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,506
Didi, mater!

417
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,677
You're too late.

418
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:26,838
The money for the cremation?

419
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,740
Every penny that we have

420
00:53:32,434 --> 00:53:34,539
goes for the rent.

421
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:37,676
Go get Auntie': things.

422
00:54:05,434 --> 00:54:06,708
Nothing.

423
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:22,446
I ms saving these for my cremation.

424
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:26,176
What a goddess!

425
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:06,204
Where do you run off to?

426
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,108
Don't you listen?

427
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,042
I've told you...

428
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:09,772
You're always angry.

429
00:55:30,534 --> 00:55:32,411
I ms going home.

430
00:55:34,567 --> 00:55:36,410
You can't go home.

431
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,936
I know.

432
00:55:43,134 --> 00:55:45,205
Forget that life.

433
00:55:55,033 --> 00:55:57,513
Auntie ate a Iadoo.

434
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:02,346
Don't worry.

435
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:07,011
Aﬂer eating the Iadoo, she'll go to Heaven.

436
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:12,406
God m/illing she'll be reborn as a man.

437
00:57:15,534 --> 00:57:17,946
I would like to meet you tonight.

438
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:21,776
At Karam Ghat. At the Shiv Temple.

439
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:24,773
I will vwit for you.

440
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,736
Yours, Narayan.

441
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:30,538
I met him with Chuyia.

442
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:34,942
I didn't ask.

443
00:57:38,534 --> 00:57:40,673
What should I do Didi?

444
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:43,746
Don't ask me.

445
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,236
I'm here.

446
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:05,879
'On the banks of the river.

447
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,178
<i>M/here the kadamba ﬂowers bloom'...</i>

448
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:17,013
The kadamba is a ﬂower so ﬂagrant.

449
01:01:18,934 --> 01:01:21,710
That people swoon in its presence.

450
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:27,277
It's From Kalidas's poem, 'Meghdoot'.

451
01:01:27,534 --> 01:01:29,741
I can't read.

452
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,906
Shakuntala Didi read your letter.

453
01:01:35,034 --> 01:01:37,514
Do you know m/hat'Meglldoot' is?

454
01:01:42,567 --> 01:01:46,276
In Sanskrit, 'megh' means a raincloud,

455
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,507
<i>and 'dual' . a messenger.</i>

456
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:56,372
The poem is about...

457
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,542
the pain of separation between two lovers.

458
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,111
Continue.

459
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,702
The lover tells the cloud.

460
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:11,408
It resembles Lord Vishnu...

461
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,180
in Krishna's guise.

462
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:17,612
Gleaming with peacock feathers.

463
01:02:31,434 --> 01:02:34,506
And the cloud heard him?

464
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,671
How is that possible?

465
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:41,104
If we believe that a statue of God can hear us,

466
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:44,373
m/hy not a cloud?

467
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:03,738
Are you gentry?

468
01:03:05,067 --> 01:03:07,673
Would it matter if I ms?

469
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,535
Yes.

470
01:03:10,034 --> 01:03:13,379
I just finished my law exams.

471
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:20,074
When did you become a widow?

472
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:22,003
I don't remember.

473
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,443
Maybe...

474
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:25,207
m/hen I ms nine.

475
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,874
Was your husband good to you?

476
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,909
I never met him.

477
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:48,908
Anyone else. in your house?

478
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,140
My mother.

479
01:03:51,234 --> 01:03:53,111
My Father,

480
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,235
Sadhuramji.

481
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:58,610
No. I'm not married.

482
01:04:01,867 --> 01:04:02,845
Good God!

483
01:04:03,134 --> 01:04:04,238
Why not?

484
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,943
My Father says,

485
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:08,708
childhood is a time for play.

486
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,211
Not for marriage.

487
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:14,413
And your mother?

488
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:16,679
Ifshe had her way.

489
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,777
I'd have a daughter as old as Chuyia.

490
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,046
Your mother's right.

491
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,246
That's how things are.

492
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,737
That's how things were.

493
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,046
Times are changing.

494
01:04:30,134 --> 01:04:35,914
All the old traditions are dying out.

495
01:04:36,134 --> 01:04:37,613
All of them?

496
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:44,041
But m/hat is good should not die out.

497
01:04:48,267 --> 01:04:50,042
And who will decide...

498
01:04:50,134 --> 01:04:51,340
m/hat is good.

499
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,846
And m/hat is not?

500
01:04:56,367 --> 01:04:57,778
You!

501
01:05:50,734 --> 01:05:55,734
Didi, m/hen do we get food?

502
01:05:55,934 --> 01:05:57,777
Today we fist.

503
01:05:59,034 --> 01:06:00,945
No food, no mater.

504
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:03,341
Come in.

505
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:11,573
What's wrong?

506
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:14,045
No tantrums?

507
01:06:17,434 --> 01:06:20,540
You're getting used to this life.

508
01:06:21,234 --> 01:06:22,178
Come sit here.

509
01:06:22,934 --> 01:06:23,969
I have to go.

510
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,274
Kalyani': reciting Kalidas.

511
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,470
What?

512
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:28,739
A Poem.

513
01:06:34,067 --> 01:06:37,048
'Megh' means cloud.

514
01:06:37,133 --> 01:06:40,342
<i>And 'dual' a messenger.</i>

515
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,005
The Cloud Messenger.

516
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,341
Come on. let's send a message.

517
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:07,611
Did you send your message?

518
01:07:07,934 --> 01:07:09,675
I don't vwnt to send one.

519
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:24,243
Why won't you send one?

520
01:07:28,234 --> 01:07:29,907
Have you gone deaf?

521
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:31,670
<i>Didi wants you.</i>

522
01:07:44,067 --> 01:07:46,707
You are lucky Mitthu.

523
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,076
You don't have to fist.

524
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:50,368
<i>Y as Dir}?!?</i>

525
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:52,878
Come on in child.

526
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:57,710
Here, this is for you.

527
01:08:02,134 --> 01:08:03,545
Wait child.

528
01:08:06,533 --> 01:08:08,535
You must take care of yourself.

529
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,636
You are the jewel of this house.

530
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:11,838
If you are happy.

531
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:13,208
Our clients are happy.

532
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,212
And m/hen they are happy, I am happy.

533
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,508
This is an ashram Didi,

534
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,204
not a brothel.

535
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,875
This is the edge of the city.

536
01:08:34,967 --> 01:08:37,072
Where the British live.

537
01:08:39,534 --> 01:08:42,242
They don't care if you're a widow.

538
01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:44,002
Why not?

539
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:47,605
Don't they have widows?

540
01:08:48,534 --> 01:08:50,104
Of course they do.

541
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:52,208
But not like ours.

542
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,439
It must be hard for you.

543
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:02,071
Sometimes yes.

544
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,845
Sometimes no.

545
01:09:05,134 --> 01:09:06,943
'Learn to live like a lotus...

546
01:09:07,034 --> 01:09:10,607
untouched by the filthy mater it grows in.'

547
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,340
Krishnaji said it in the Geeta.

548
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,180
Krishna ms a God.

549
01:09:18,267 --> 01:09:21,248
Not everyone can live like the lotus ﬂower.

550
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:26,876
Yes, they can.

551
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,204
It's ink.

552
01:09:45,034 --> 01:09:47,674
I didn't have time to change.

553
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,244
I ms applying for a job in Calcutta.

554
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:55,345
What's wrong?

555
01:09:58,234 --> 01:09:59,679
When do you go?

556
01:10:00,567 --> 01:10:03,241
As soon as they call me.

557
01:10:07,201 --> 01:10:09,238
<i>And when vim“ you be back'?</i>

558
01:10:16,534 --> 01:10:20,676
I'm not going anywhere without you.

559
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,038
Are you asleep?

560
01:11:02,434 --> 01:11:03,412
Yes.

561
01:11:03,867 --> 01:11:04,709
Wake up.

562
01:11:04,967 --> 01:11:06,037
What?

563
01:11:07,767 --> 01:11:09,576
Speak soﬂly.

564
01:11:24,567 --> 01:11:26,376
Did you have a fight with fither?

565
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,206
He's never hereto have a fight with.

566
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:34,445
What does he preach?

567
01:11:35,734 --> 01:11:36,644
That's Gandhiji.

568
01:11:36,734 --> 01:11:38,213
Not some crooked priest.

569
01:11:38,734 --> 01:11:40,213
So, m/hat does he say than?

570
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:41,674
He talks about Freedom,

571
01:11:41,767 --> 01:11:43,178
about truth.

572
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:45,174
To talk about truth is easy.

573
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:48,680
But to live by it is not.

574
01:11:49,634 --> 01:11:53,673
The girl's Father is getting impatient.

575
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,374
What?

576
01:11:57,934 --> 01:11:59,538
Turn off that gramophone!

577
01:12:04,634 --> 01:12:06,341
I vwnt a yes. or a no.

578
01:12:08,234 --> 01:12:09,269
No!

579
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:10,341
What?

580
01:12:13,734 --> 01:12:16,010
Don't you xrvant to set up a Family?

581
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:17,907
It's not like setting yogurt.

582
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:21,172
Who am I going to find for you?

583
01:12:22,734 --> 01:12:24,736
You don't have to.

584
01:12:25,034 --> 01:12:27,071
I found her myself.

585
01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:28,838
Really?

586
01:12:33,367 --> 01:12:34,812
Who is she?

587
01:12:35,234 --> 01:12:36,941
Do I know her?

588
01:12:37,401 --> 01:12:38,243
No.

589
01:12:38,867 --> 01:12:40,278
Is she Fair skinned?

590
01:12:41,134 --> 01:12:42,613
Yes.

591
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,236
Tell me quickly who is she?

592
01:12:45,701 --> 01:12:46,941
She's a widow Ma.

593
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,837
Gandhi has turned you into a lunatic!

594
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,102
Marry a widow?

595
01:12:59,367 --> 01:13:01,176
How can you even think of it?

596
01:13:01,734 --> 01:13:02,678
This is a sin.

597
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,647
You should get a gold medal for drama Ma.

598
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:12,375
Raja Ramohan Roy says widows should get remarried.

599
01:13:13,467 --> 01:13:15,037
And Raja m/hoever Roy.

600
01:13:15,134 --> 01:13:17,273
M/hat does he know of our traditions?

601
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,406
What will your fither say?

602
01:13:19,534 --> 01:13:21,775
He'll be pleased, he's a liberal thinker.

603
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,008
Stop it!

604
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:43,240
<i>Have some Dir}?!?</i>

605
01:13:44,034 --> 01:13:46,913
I've been Farting non-stop since this morning.

606
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,771
late too much last night.

607
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:55,371
Here. eat some.

608
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,735
Are you mad?

609
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,674
Giving a widow forbidden food.

610
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:02,580
I'll eat a hundred puris at Kalyani': wedding.

611
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,508
Whose wedding?

612
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,102
Kalyani': wedding.

613
01:14:07,434 --> 01:14:08,777
And m/hen is her wedding?

614
01:14:08,934 --> 01:14:09,912
Don't know.

615
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,704
She'll get married over my dead body.

616
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,177
Widows don't get married.

617
01:14:13,267 --> 01:14:15,873
But she will. I know she will.

618
01:14:15,967 --> 01:14:16,843
No! She won't!

619
01:14:16,934 --> 01:14:17,776
Now get offi

620
01:14:17,867 --> 01:14:18,811
She will get married.

621
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,106
She will. She will. She will.

622
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:21,741
Drown yourself. liar!

623
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:22,535
Madhu Fatty!

624
01:14:22,634 --> 01:14:23,305
Liar Fatty!

625
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:23,878
Madhu Fatty!

626
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:24,468
Liar Fatty!

627
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:25,170
Bitchy may!

628
01:14:25,267 --> 01:14:27,076
Get off the old bitch, she'll die!

629
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,040
Get this devil off me!

630
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:00,607
Chuyia, that's enough.

631
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,269
Chuyia, stop.

632
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:07,039
Chuyia. Enough.

633
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,076
Come here.

634
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:27,571
Chuyia says you're getting married.

635
01:15:28,934 --> 01:15:29,708
Yes.

636
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:31,210
Have you gone mad?

637
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:33,008
Nobody marries a widow.

638
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:35,777
He will.

639
01:15:36,434 --> 01:15:37,674
Shameless.

640
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:40,748
You'll sink yourself and us.

641
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,577
We'll be cursed.

642
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:44,511
We must live in purity.

643
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,273
To die in purity.

644
01:15:47,434 --> 01:15:49,744
<i>Then why did you send me across the river'?</i>

645
01:15:49,934 --> 01:15:51,379
For survival.

646
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:53,447
And how we survive here.

647
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:55,571
No one can question,

648
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:57,278
not even God!

649
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,681
We would have burnt in Hell because of her.

650
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,504
I've saved you.

651
01:16:35,634 --> 01:16:36,874
I've saved you all.

652
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:40,045
Let's see the m/hore get married now.

653
01:16:40,134 --> 01:16:41,408
Is this true?

654
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:42,773
Yes.

655
01:16:49,801 --> 01:16:52,338
You'll let Kalyani out, won't you?

656
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,013
To even think of remarriage is a sin.

657
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:57,239
Why?

658
01:16:57,467 --> 01:16:59,071
Ask God.

659
01:17:27,367 --> 01:17:29,677
<i>Haw vim“ you get married now'?</i>

660
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:32,407
You've become bald.

661
01:17:34,534 --> 01:17:37,037
Don't worry, I'll get married.

662
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:39,405
I hope that fit Madhumati drowns!

663
01:17:42,934 --> 01:17:46,905
If widows start to fintasize they'll turn blind.

664
01:17:47,367 --> 01:17:50,007
Let's see how she gets married now.

665
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,973
What a disaster.

666
01:19:42,067 --> 01:19:46,607
Ifone widow vwnts to marry.

667
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,146
All the widows of India will vwnt to marry.

668
01:19:49,234 --> 01:19:51,009
A catastrophe!

669
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:54,610
Do you know m/hat he says?

670
01:19:54,734 --> 01:19:55,678
Who?

671
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:56,644
Gandhi.

672
01:19:56,734 --> 01:19:59,180
He says widows are strangers to love.

673
01:19:59,267 --> 01:20:01,873
And nobody should be a stranger to love.

674
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:08,344
Didi, m/hat': wrong?

675
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:13,376
I miss my dear departed Mitthu.

676
01:20:17,534 --> 01:20:19,036
My Mitthu.

677
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,579
My Mitthu.

678
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:30,379
Are you in heaven my Mitthu?

679
01:20:34,034 --> 01:20:36,708
I hear Mitthu ms murdered.

680
01:21:03,634 --> 01:21:06,080
I know you're not asleep.

681
01:21:09,734 --> 01:21:12,010
I won't ask about Mitthu.

682
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,511
Tell me, m/hat do I look like?

683
01:21:22,534 --> 01:21:23,945
Old.

684
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:22,680
You have studied the Holy Scriptures.

685
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:26,513
Is itwritterl.

686
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:31,105
That widows should be treated badly?

687
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:36,677
The Scriptures say.

688
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:40,177
That widows have three options.

689
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:42,947
They can burn with their dead husbands.

690
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:45,847
Or lead a life of self-denial,

691
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,180
or if the Family permits,

692
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:55,738
marry their husband's younger brother.

693
01:23:00,967 --> 01:23:02,412
<i>However,</i>

694
01:23:05,967 --> 01:23:08,777
a law ms recently passed.

695
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:14,607
M/hich fivours widow remarriage.

696
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:19,411
A law?

697
01:23:20,601 --> 01:23:22,877
Why don't we know about it?

698
01:23:24,634 --> 01:23:31,279
We ignore the laws...

699
01:23:31,367 --> 01:23:37,010
that don't benefit us.

700
01:23:50,967 --> 01:23:52,344
Keys to her room.

701
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:53,745
I won't give them.

702
01:23:56,234 --> 01:23:57,372
The keys.

703
01:23:57,867 --> 01:23:59,278
I told you I won't give them.

704
01:24:05,067 --> 01:24:06,671
If you open the door,

705
01:24:07,101 --> 01:24:09,047
you destroy us all.

706
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:16,172
Imbecile!

707
01:24:16,434 --> 01:24:18,414
Don't open the door.

708
01:24:46,034 --> 01:24:47,035
Leave.

709
01:25:02,134 --> 01:25:02,771
Go.

710
01:25:13,867 --> 01:25:15,938
If you go to him.

711
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:19,213
I won't let you come back.

712
01:27:00,767 --> 01:27:03,008
I love you very much.

713
01:27:11,134 --> 01:27:13,273
Will you marry me?

714
01:27:43,767 --> 01:27:46,008
Come and play Holi. We've dressed you...

715
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,875
for this Festival of Colour.

716
01:27:48,034 --> 01:27:49,377
Stop Sulking.

717
01:29:25,467 --> 01:29:27,504
What's the first colour you'll wear?

718
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:29,274
Blue.

719
01:29:29,934 --> 01:29:31,504
The colour of Lord Krishna.

720
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,180
A blue sari with a gold border.

721
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,376
You'll look as beautiful as a peacock feather.

722
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,080
You really told your mother?

723
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,071
Yes.

724
01:29:53,367 --> 01:29:54,846
What did you say?

725
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,337
I said I vwnted to marry you.

726
01:29:59,467 --> 01:30:00,673
And m/hat did she say?

727
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,779
She began to cry.

728
01:30:03,567 --> 01:30:04,568
Good God!

729
01:30:07,401 --> 01:30:09,506
Father and I will convince her.

730
01:30:14,567 --> 01:30:15,841
Look... my house.

731
01:30:22,134 --> 01:30:24,273
What's your Ether': name?

732
01:30:25,601 --> 01:30:28,844
Dvwrkanath... Seth Dvwrkanath.

733
01:30:40,267 --> 01:30:41,746
Turn the boat around.

734
01:30:42,634 --> 01:30:43,669
What happened?

735
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,438
Turn the boat around.

736
01:30:53,967 --> 01:30:55,173
Sit Kalyani.

737
01:31:00,467 --> 01:31:02,378
At least tell me m/hat': wrong.

738
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:10,344
Alright, you don't need to say anything.

739
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:12,545
But I do need to.

740
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:15,172
Then please try.

741
01:31:16,967 --> 01:31:18,844
I can't.

742
01:31:20,234 --> 01:31:21,872
Ask your Father.

743
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,778
What?

744
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:40,743
What happened ms unfortunate.

745
01:31:42,734 --> 01:31:43,769
<i>However...</i>

746
01:31:52,134 --> 01:31:53,613
However m/hat?

747
01:31:54,600 --> 01:32:00,346
So you've found out she's not a goddess.

748
01:32:01,734 --> 01:32:03,236
Don't marry her.

749
01:32:04,467 --> 01:32:06,447
Keep her as a mistress.

750
01:32:10,867 --> 01:32:12,869
I respected you so much.

751
01:32:16,034 --> 01:32:20,540
Brahmins can sleep with m/homever they want,

752
01:32:20,634 --> 01:32:24,514
and the women they sleep with are blessed.

753
01:32:29,534 --> 01:32:31,741
Do you know Lord Ram told His brother,

754
01:32:32,767 --> 01:32:36,681
never to honor those Brahmins.

755
01:32:36,767 --> 01:32:38,872
Who interpret the Holy Texts

756
01:32:38,967 --> 01:32:40,275
for their own benefit?

757
01:32:40,567 --> 01:32:43,275
You're not a hero in an epic play,

758
01:32:43,534 --> 01:32:47,380
ready to wage war For love.

759
01:32:49,467 --> 01:32:51,947
You disgust me.

760
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:24,408
Did you put butter?

761
01:33:24,801 --> 01:33:25,609
Yes.

762
01:33:47,434 --> 01:33:49,345
So, you've come back.

763
01:33:54,867 --> 01:33:57,939
Your Father-in-law didn't like you?

764
01:34:06,101 --> 01:34:07,273
Wait there.

765
01:34:07,367 --> 01:34:09,608
Gulabi will be here soon.

766
01:36:15,367 --> 01:36:17,540
I've come for Kalyani.

767
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:03,240
The Holy Texts say all this is an illusion.

768
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,846
Kalyani': death is no illusion.

769
01:37:13,234 --> 01:37:14,838
Have Faith.

770
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:20,843
Why is your Faith so strong?

771
01:37:22,267 --> 01:37:24,042
I don't know.

772
01:37:47,967 --> 01:37:50,504
Why are we widows sent here?

773
01:37:53,301 --> 01:37:55,372
There must be a reason for it.

774
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:59,837
One less mouth to feed.

775
01:38:00,801 --> 01:38:02,007
Four saris saved.

776
01:38:03,601 --> 01:38:05,603
One bed.

777
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:10,847
And a corner is saved in the Family home.

778
01:38:14,067 --> 01:38:16,069
There is no other reason m/hy you are here.

779
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:23,106
Disguised as religion, it's just about money.

780
01:38:46,901 --> 01:38:49,472
I always keep my promises.

781
01:38:49,567 --> 01:38:50,443
Don't I?

782
01:38:50,534 --> 01:38:53,208
Everyone knows you do.

783
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,171
But she doesn't even vwnt to go home.

784
01:38:56,267 --> 01:38:57,211
Right?

785
01:39:00,867 --> 01:39:02,403
I vwnt to go home.

786
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:05,941
Alright than, Gulabi will take you.

787
01:39:06,767 --> 01:39:09,338
You know m/here my home is?

788
01:39:09,967 --> 01:39:12,777
She does. Gulabi knows everything.

789
01:39:13,234 --> 01:39:17,512
But if you don't vwnt to go, you don't have to.

790
01:39:17,601 --> 01:39:19,945
Aﬂer all, I'm also like your mother.

791
01:39:26,634 --> 01:39:29,843
Can I take Kaalu?

792
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,672
Weapons cannot cleave it.

793
01:39:35,734 --> 01:39:38,237
Fire cannot burn it.

794
01:39:39,034 --> 01:39:41,446
Eternal and all pervading.

795
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:44,671
Is this soul.

796
01:39:48,801 --> 01:39:50,678
Holy Water.

797
01:40:13,101 --> 01:40:19,677
The British have let Gandhiji out of jail!

798
01:40:19,767 --> 01:40:22,077
He's Free, on his xrvay From Allahabad.

799
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,548
Gandhi is one of the few people in the world,

800
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:32,239
who listens to the voice of his conscience.

801
01:40:35,067 --> 01:40:36,011
But...

802
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:42,878
xrvhat if our conscience conﬂicts xrvith our Faith?

803
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,102
Whose house is this?

804
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,004
This is KalyanFs Friends house.

805
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:01,013
Play here for a m/hile, than I'll take you home.

806
01:41:01,534 --> 01:41:02,604
No.

807
01:41:05,201 --> 01:41:07,442
Don't you xrvant sweets and Fried bread?

808
01:41:10,967 --> 01:41:11,604
Let';

809
01:42:16,134 --> 01:42:18,876
I've come to play.

810
01:42:59,567 --> 01:43:00,841
Have you seen Chuyia?

811
01:43:03,034 --> 01:43:04,945
Ask Madhu Didi.

812
01:43:18,534 --> 01:43:20,343
Where's Chuyia?

813
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:29,545
Have you seen Chuyia?

814
01:43:29,634 --> 01:43:30,738
What?

815
01:43:33,367 --> 01:43:34,243
Have you seen her?

816
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:38,370
Have you seen her?

817
01:43:41,701 --> 01:43:43,578
I've sent her.

818
01:43:46,567 --> 01:43:47,841
Where did you send her?

819
01:43:52,567 --> 01:43:53,875
Where did you send her?

820
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,401
Open your eyes!

821
01:43:58,034 --> 01:43:58,944
Where did you send her?

822
01:43:59,034 --> 01:44:00,741
With Gulabi.

823
01:44:05,534 --> 01:44:07,673
Wake up! Wake up!

824
01:44:11,301 --> 01:44:14,339
Wake up! Take me across the river.

825
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:07,841
What are your plans?

826
01:46:13,934 --> 01:46:15,470
To take the train,

827
01:46:15,567 --> 01:46:18,912
and leave this place behind.

828
01:46:36,734 --> 01:46:39,180
The British have let Gandhiji out of jail.

829
01:46:39,267 --> 01:46:42,373
He's here at the train station for five minutes.

830
01:46:42,467 --> 01:46:45,175
He's holding his prayer meeting.

831
01:46:45,734 --> 01:46:47,714
If you vwnt his blessings be there!

832
01:48:40,767 --> 01:48:42,212
Live long.

833
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,938
Be hﬂPPV-

834
01:48:44,301 --> 01:48:46,508
My dear brothers and sisters.

835
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:52,607
For a long time I believed that God is Truth.

836
01:48:52,701 --> 01:48:57,775
But today I know, that Truth is God.

837
01:48:57,867 --> 01:49:00,313
The pursuit of truth...

838
01:49:00,401 --> 01:49:02,608
is invaluable for me.

839
01:49:02,701 --> 01:49:06,877
I trust itwill be the same for you.

840
01:49:13,201 --> 01:49:16,512
Long Live Gandhi!

841
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,004
Please let me through.

842
01:50:01,934 --> 01:50:03,538
Brothers, please take her with you.

843
01:50:03,634 --> 01:50:05,375
Please, give her to Gandhiji.

844
01:50:05,467 --> 01:50:06,275
Brother!

845
01:50:10,734 --> 01:50:12,543
Help her, please help her!

846
01:50:16,567 --> 01:50:18,376
Take this child with you.

847
01:50:18,434 --> 01:50:19,742
Why doesn't anybody listen?

848
01:50:21,601 --> 01:50:23,512
This child is a widow!

849
01:50:25,067 --> 01:50:25,772
Didi!

850
01:50:30,134 --> 01:50:32,114
Make sure she's in Gandhiji': care!

851
01:50:49,867 --> 01:50:52,108
Don't be afraid.

852
01:50:55,634 --> 01:50:57,113
Give her to Gandhi!
