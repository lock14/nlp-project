{398}{447}Domnule Bond?
{491}{525}Da?
{527}{598}Sunt locotenentul Mathis|de la Fortele Speciale de Politie.
{694}{760}Acestea sunt acreditarile mele.
{762}{811}Par a fi in regula.
{814}{867}Veniti cu mine.
{5712}{5823}Obisnuiau sa spuna ca un spion bun|este un simplu spion,si inauntru si afara.
{5903}{5995}Trandafiri,figurine de Tanagra si Debussy.
{6038}{6089}Canta Debussy in fiecare dupa amiaza
{6091}{6169}de la apus pana era prea intuneric|ca sa mai poata citi notele.
{6335}{6423}Statea mult timp in cap, manca bomboane.
{6455}{6535}Isi lasa intestinele in jos|si le spala cu mana.
{6544}{6622}Ceva ce a invatat|in timpul calatoriei in Tibet.
{6726}{6800}M, ce ti-a dat?
{6802}{6859}Am uitat sa mentionez leii.
{6862}{6956}- Lei si...mai multi lei.|- Suntem inconjurati de lei.
{7031}{7113}Nu am venit aici|sa fiu devorat de simbolurile monarhiei!
{7116}{7165}Te avertizez, M, daca este o capcana...
{7168}{7246}Calmati-va domnilor.|Nu e nici o capcana, va asigur.
{7249}{7343}Leii sunt doar curiosi.|El are putini vizitatori.
{7345}{7402}Asta o pot crede.
{7750}{7817}Un rai veritabil, nu-i asa, domnilor??
{7819}{7886}Un rai fara Eva este o absurditate.
{7888}{7953}Un spion bun este doar un spion.
{7955}{8018}Nu bun. Grozav.
{8020}{8090}Cel mai mare spion din istorie, domnilor.
{8092}{8207}Adevaratul, unicul,|originalul James Bond.
{8643}{8717}- Domnii sunt aici, Sir James.|- Multumesc.
{8976}{9039}- Dragul meu Bond.|- Dragul meu M.
{9074}{9123}Ransome, CIA, Sir James.
{9126}{9204}J-Junior cipher c-clerk in m-my day,|nu-i asa, Ransome?
{9206}{9356}Yes, sir. JCC, class G, SIC to SCCT.|CIA, Washington DC.
{9384}{9433}Smernov, KGB, Sir James.
{9436}{9491}Ah, da. Inspector de teren.
{9494}{9582}Ikon 988, GPU, sectorul Siberian.
{9585}{9648}Imi amintesc de individul asta...Lenin, foarte bine.
{9650}{9730}organizator de prima clasa, gandire da clasa a doua.
{9732}{9791}Le Grand, Sir James.|Deuxième bureau.
{9794}{9861}Promovat in sfarsit de la micile vicii?
{9863}{9933}Arati incredibil de bine, James.
{9935}{10015}Timpul, dragul meu M,|nu exista intre peretii acestia.
{10029}{10165}- Astia nu sunt reali.|- Da, un stigat indepartat din infinita noastra lume.
{10167}{10226}Pe vremea mea|spionajul era o alternativa la razboi.
{10229}{10311}Spionul era membrul|al unei selecte si imaculate tagme preotesti,
{10314}{10425}devotat vocational,|sublim dezinteresat.
{10454}{10525}Aceasta este o descriere palida|a acestui acrobat sexual
{10527}{10642}insensibil ce lasa |femeile gafaind in urma sa.
{10656}{10715}-Ce vrei sa spui...|- Stii foarte bine ce vreau sa spun.
{10718}{10789}Ingamfatul acela|caruia i-ai dat numele si numarul meu.
{10791}{10881}Dragul meu James,cand ne-ai parasit|eram un departament mic,
{10884}{10950}sub-finantat, ridicol de prost echipat.
{10952}{11024}Era esential|ca legenda ta sa fie pastrata.
{11027}{11130}Fara un James Bond 007,|nimeni nu ne-ar fi respectat.
{11132}{11183}El si ale lui dispozitive nenorocite.
{11185}{11242}Trebuie sa ne folosim|de armele timpului nostru.
{11245}{11294}Am remarcat.
{11297}{11422}Tu, Ransome, cu acel truc cu garoafa|care s-scuipa cianura.
{11424}{11473}Ar trebui sa-ti fie rusine.
{11498}{11547}Rusii au inceput.
{11550}{11675}Si tu, Smernov,cu un arsenal|ascuns in bocancii aia grotesti.
{11708}{11765}Asculta-le cum zdrangane.
{11785}{11904}Si tu, Le Grand,cu otrava|diferita si mortala in fiecare din butonii tai zburatori.
{11960}{12058}Si tu, M,|cu stilourile tale aruncatoare de flacari.
{12060}{12136}V-V-Voi sunteti o gluma de spioni, domnilori.
{12139}{12206}Suntem in ultima jumatate|a secolului 20, Sir James.
{12208}{12307}- Chiar si tu trebuie sa recunosti.|- De ce ar trebui, daca eu ii pot face fata?
{12338}{12459}Priviti-mi gradina.|Acolo afara, este un trandafir negru.
{12469}{12535}Nu rosu inchis, negru.
{12543}{12596}Ca o aripa de corb in miezul noptii.
{12686}{12807}N-as schimba nici macar o singura petala|pentru nimic din ce are lumea voastra de oferit,
{12810}{12888}inclusiv un Aston M-Martin|cu accesorii mortale.
{12891}{12985}Aveti numai dispret pentru|proletariat, Sir James. Asta stim.
{12988}{13074}Daca nu v-as cunoaste bine, as spune|ca v-ati pierdut increderea in democratie.
{13077}{13153}Poti sparge sticla,|dar nu poti opri vremea.
{13156}{13292}Lucrurile merg rau. Am pierdut 11 agenti|in ultimile 2 saptamani - 7 ucisi, 4 disparuti.
{13295}{13400}- Tizul meu este printre ei?|- Ar putea foarte bine sa fie maine.
{13402}{13471}8 dintre ai nostri au primit de lucru -|2 la Pentagon.
{13473}{13537}- 16.|- KGB este deplorabil.
{13539}{13590}Nu pot calcula exact cifrele.
{13592}{13672}Inamicul a patruns|in cele mai secrete cercuri ale noastre.
{13675}{13730}- Ne citeste gandurile.|- Din ce stim,
{13733}{13784}este cu ochii pe noi acum.
{13787}{13861}Sunteti siguri|ca nu este unul sau m-mai multi dintre voi?
{13864}{13923}- Nu, nu.|- Sigur.
{13926}{14031}Pana trece pericolul, trebuie|sa fim uniti in apararea tuturor spionilor,
{14034}{14106}mari sau mici, indiferent de nationalitate.
{14109}{14220}Necazurile fac oamenii rai si ciudati,|dar de ce, in puterea unitatii voastre,
{14223}{14288}deranjati un domn|care s-a retras?
{14290}{14360}Avem nevoie de inspiratia ta de a ne conduce.
{14362}{14456}Te rugam da-ne beneficiul|incomparabilelor tale puteri de deductie.
{14458}{14565}- Pentru toti oamenii liberi si iubitori.|- Pentru glorioasa revolutie socialista.
{14568}{14621}Daca imi permiteti sa intrerup aceasta insiruire de clisee ,
{14624}{14708}este momentul zilei|pe care l-am stabilit pentru Debussy.
{15087}{15171}Poate acesta fi omul|care a castigat Victoria Cross la Mafeking?
{15174}{15243}Eroul de la Ashanti Uprising?
{15245}{15333}Ce geniu irosit|in serviciul unui imperiu prabusit.
{15335}{15423}De ce, in apogeul carieirei,|a decis Bond sa se retraga?
{15522}{15579}Mata Hari, dragul meu.
{15582}{15666}- Care este legatura?|- Femeia din viata lui.
{15668}{15734}- Nu pricep.|- A fost dureroasa lui datorie
{15736}{15816}s-o momeasca dealungul frontierei Spaniei|prin Franta,
{15818}{15904}unde a abandonat-o|in fata unui detasament de tragatori.
{15907}{15956}Chiar a iubit-o.
{16107}{16154}Deci, James?
{16156}{16244}Imi pare rau, batrane,|dar ce imi ceri e imposibil.
{16271}{16335}Poate asta i-ti va schimba decizia.
{16460}{16579}Dosarul meu vorbeste de loialitatea mea.|Dar nu, nici macar pentru ea, McTarry.
{16761}{16814}Imi pare rau, James.
{16843}{16910}Acela este semnalul lui McTarry . Fiti gata.
{16912}{16942}- Zero.|- On.
{16944}{16997}- Foc!|- Foc!
{17160}{17215}Mai sus cu 200!
{17366}{17417}- Centrul catre Baza.|- Spune.
{17427}{17484}Incepeti cu Smersh Planul B.
{17487}{17623}Sir James Bond s-a intors, cu moralitatea lui,|juramintele lui, si cu imaginea de celibatar.
{17633}{17684}Trebuie sa distrugem aceasta imagine.
{17832}{17867}Riverbank catre Baza.
{17869}{17949}- Spune.|- Tinta tocmai a intrat in Scotia.
{18201}{18297}- Castelul lui M catre baza.|- Numele lui M este McTarry. Foloseste-l.
{18299}{18344}Planul B in functiune.
{18347}{18450}Castelul lui McTarry complet ocupat  ,|cu o singura modificare.
{18452}{18534}Agent Mimi este acum vaduva lui M.
{18536}{18607}Agentul Mimi a impresionat-o pe Lady Fiona?
{18609}{18670}Ea a fost cel mai bun agent Scotian.
{18685}{18744}Si asta este tot ce a mai ramas din McTarry.
{18752}{18869}Sotul dumneavoastra a murit asa cum a trait,|Lady Fiona.In serviciul Majestatii Sale.
{18876}{18954}M-am gandit ca ar fi|dureroasa mea datorie d-de-a aduce vestile.
{18959}{19039}Cum ati stiut ca sotul dumneavostra M -|imi pare rau, McTarry - a murit?
{19041}{19117}- Ni s-a spus.|-Va pot intreba cine v-a spus?
{19139}{19205}- Grey Piper.|- Cine?
{19234}{19295}Spune-i lui Sir James despre Grey Piper, lass.
{19297}{19361}Ori de cate ori un McTarry moare,
{19371}{19488}el coboara din munti,|over the loch and through the heather,
{19490}{19535}intonand bocetul clanului.
{19537}{19627}Noi punem intotdeauna un "tappit-hen" de|"usquebaugh" in fata usilor castelului.
{19635}{19698}- "Tappit-hen"?|- Un sfert de whisky.
{19700}{19757}- Este intr-adevar un cimpoier?|- Nu stim.
{19760}{19830}Dar este acelasi de 600 de ani.
{19869}{19959}- Nu a mai ramas nimic??|- Ma tem ca nimic despre care sa putem vorbi.
{19977}{20078}A fost gasita intr-un copac,|100 de metri de unde stateam.
{20089}{20177}Scoasa, asa cum era,si a zburat ca o p-pasare.
{20190}{20257}But whether it is an article of apparel
{20259}{20347}or an anatomical f-feature,|that is the question.
{20349}{20480}Ar trebui sa-l inmormantam Crestineste?|Just how p-personal is a toupee?
{20485}{20569}Poate fi privita doar ca o "peruca".
{20584}{20678}Eliza,pune-o langa celelalte relicve ale gloriei lui McTarry .
{20716}{20787}We all ken that|our beloved McTarry of the Glen
{20789}{20853}was a different man in Whitehall.
{20855}{20927}Dar femeile McTarry nu pun niciodata intrebari.
{20982}{21066}In conformitate cu traditiile clanului,|cand lordul moare
{21075}{21215}un tap negru trebuie luat viu|din Ben Tarry de cartre 6 virgine desculte.
{21231}{21290}Eu insami il sacrific.
{21293}{21396}Ficele smulg stomacul,|si-l umplu cu maruntaie.
{21399}{21448}Minunate maruntaie.
{21451}{21527}Il parjolesc, il fierb, si apoi il servesc.
{21541}{21582}Si il mananca?
{21585}{21688}- Duhoare fierbinte.|- Suna d-delicios.
{21698}{21805}Incepem festinul la miezul noptii,|washin' the haggis down wi' usquebaugh.
{21807}{21922}One gies strength to the limbs,|the other fire to the blood for dancin'.
{21925}{21999}- Danseaza?|- The McTarry funeral fling.
{22028}{22131}"Argar, argar garar goru argar" it goes.
{22144}{22236}-Foarte m-miscator.|- Ah,dansam pana ne prabusim.
{22238}{22320}Dupa o pauza de o ora,|cimpoierul ne trezeste
{22323}{22384}cu melodia din "Away to the Grouse"
{22386}{22458}si noi plecam|la o memorabila vanatoare de cocosi de munte.
{22468}{22529}D-Dar nu este sezon de vanatoare|pentru cocosii de munte?
{22534}{22643}Ori de cate ori moare un McTarry,|se face sezon pentru cocosii de munte.
{22810}{22859}Eu sunt Heather.
{22878}{22960}Eu sunt Meg. Baia dumneavoastra e pregatita, Sir James.
{22963}{23018}- Multumesc.|- La capatul culoarului.
{23020}{23135}- Sunteti foarte amabile.|- Lasa-ne sa te ajutam.
{23137}{23229}- Nu,multumesc. M-ma descurc...|- Intotdeauna il ajutam pe Tati.
{23243}{23331}Cate sunteti aici?|F-fiice,vreau sa spun .
{23334}{23424}- 11 cu totul.|- 11? O-oh Doamne.
{23452}{23530}Si ce varste aveti?
{23533}{23586}Cine este cea mai... Cati ani are cea mai tanara?
{23589}{23644}- 16.|- Si cea mai in varsta?
{23646}{23685}19.
{23687}{23756}Asta inseamna ca sunt doar...?|Ai grija cu rotula mea.
{23758}{23842}Sunt numai 3 ani|intre voi 11?
{23845}{23898}Unele dintre noi suntem adoptate.
{23901}{23967}Inteleg. Usurel.
{23969}{24069}- In casa asta sunt b-barbati?|- Nimeni in afara de cimpoieri.
{24081}{24145}Tatalui meu ii plac numai fetitele.
{24147}{24243}T-Tatal tau a fost|un om d-diferit in Whitehall.
{25363}{25428}Verific temperatura apei
{25430}{25479}cum faceam intotdeauna pentru tatal meu.
{25504}{25569}Obisnuia sa-mi spuna micul lui termometru.
{25611}{25662}Ei bine? Intra.
{25686}{25735}- Sa intru?|- Intra!
{26012}{26067}Esti sigura ca nu te i-inghesui?
{26070}{26119}Intra.
{26211}{26270}I-ti place sa fii spalat pe spate?
{26272}{26321}Multumesc.
{26358}{26450}- Cum te c-cheama,draga mea?|- Buttercup.
{26452}{26526}-Cati ani ai?|- 17.
{26563}{26635}- Mergi la scoala?|- Taticu'ne-a invatat.
{26665}{26714}Uite. Esti neted ca un bebelus.
{26735}{26784}Acum,intoarce-te.
{27178}{27227}In ce clasa esti?
{27230}{27316}Can ye nae judge that|for yourself, Sir James? 
{27318}{27379}- Care este material ta preferata?|- Anatomia.
{27381}{27432}Asta este mediastinum.
{27435}{27509}Asta este|orbicularis oris.
{27511}{27562}Asta este Azygos vein.
{27565}{27692}Asta este articular cartilage,|si astia sunt synovial membranes.
{27694}{27772}- Corect,corect.|- Se face foarte frig!
{27774}{27837}- Quite.|- My daddy liked it hotter. 
{27842}{27907}I am not your d-da... Quite.
{28496}{28545}Multumesc.
{28623}{28689}- La latifundie!|- La latifundie!
{28766}{28916}In dreapta ta, Sir James - Lady Mary,|fiica Lordului Douglas McTarry,
{28919}{29011}violata de Campbells in 1622.
{29022}{29071}In legatura cu asta,
{29074}{29220}Lordul Douglas l-a trimis pe unicul sau fiu Hamish|s-o violeze pe Lady Campbell lassies.
{29237}{29329}- In acelasi t-timp?|- Cei mai in varsta primii,desigur.
{29332}{29426}Cum a prezis scriptura.|Primul ia daruit tripleti.
{29505}{29579}Casatoria lor a inceput|cu o binecuvantare generoasa,
{29582}{29641}a contract of marriage was entered into
{29644}{29759}which brought the McTarrys Black Loch,|Ben Torn, the Shags of Raugh,
{29762}{29836}Glen Noch,|and a good stretch of salmon water.
{30208}{30257}Toate cele bune.
{30324}{30373}Am intrebat, ea face...?
{31184}{31233}Noapte buna, doamnelor.
{32653}{32735}Nu am avut somn|gandindu-ma la iubita mea.
{32771}{32874}Toata noaptea am umblat,tarandu-ma ___________All the long night I walk, grovellin' in grief.
{32885}{32934}Consoleaza-ma, Jamie lad.
{32955}{33029}Da-mi umarul tau prietenesc ca sa pot plange.
{33031}{33101}- Dublu, Jamie.|- Zau, doamna!
{33103}{33251}Prin prezenta declar vaduvia mea|in acord cu traditia McTarry.
{33253}{33302}lasa-ma sa-ti fiu mangaiere.
{33333}{33382}Dublu!
{33385}{33506}A quaint custom, but one more honoured|in the breach than in the observance.
{33508}{33574}Atunci va trebui sa platesti flautistul!
{33590}{33643}Flautistul?
{33646}{33720}M-ai auzit,|you mean-mou'd, ill-willie cuif!
{33725}{33784}You'll have to pay the piper!

{39786}{39849}Magnific. Dar...
{39993}{40052}E surprinzator cat de repede se intorc toate.
{40054}{40159}Ah, bine. Un mic somn de frumusete|inainte de vanatoare,poate?
{40525}{40588}Beaters, urmareste-o pe Marie peste ______ the butts.

{53548}{53630}De fapt,|sunt fata doamnei Moneypenny.
{53664}{53762}- Ce face draga ta mama?|- Dupoa ce ai plecat, ____ she took the vows.
{53764}{53825}That seems to be|the in thing to do these days.
{53827}{53888}Trebuie sa spun, acest loc|imi rascoleste amintiri.
{53891}{53944}Da,mama mi-a spus cateva dintre ele.
{53986}{54119}She probably also told you that I'm partial|to jasmine tea. Lapsang Souchong.
{54121}{54205}Apropo, de cand am venit aici|ai observat ca ma balbai?
{54208}{54257}- Nu, sir.|- Anunta-ma cand observi.
{54260}{54309}Nu am timp acum pentru asa ceva.
{54312}{54390}- Vei avea nevoie de mine la noapte, sir?|- Aproape sigur.
{54393}{54477}Daca voi prelua acest departamen,|trebuie sa stiu toate secretele lui M.
{54479}{54542}Nu cele personale, desigur.
{54554}{54638}- Va urez bine ati revenit, Sir James.|- Multumesc...
{54640}{54699}- Hadley, sir.|- Bineinteles. Esti...
{54702}{54794}- Fiul tatalui meu, sir.|- Si unde este tatal tau acum?
{54796}{54857}- In acelasi loc, sir.|- Asta e incurajator.
{54860}{54932}Punema-la curent.|Cine in ce misune e?
{54934}{54998}- Nu e o imagine prea frumoasa.|- De ce e asa de sumbru?
{55005}{55054}Mi se pare ca au fost lichidati.
{55066}{55154}Finlanda - injunghiat pana a murit|intr-o sauna pentru femei, sir.
{55190}{55259}Madrid - ars intr-un bordel, sir.
{55261}{55353}Si Tokyo, sir -|strangulat intr-o casa de geishe.
{55362}{55463}Este dezolant ca "agent secret"|a devenit sinonim cu "maniac sexual".
{55465}{55565}- Apropo, unde este omologul meu?|- A trebuit sa ne descotorosim de el, sir.
{55567}{55616}Acum face televiziune.
{55625}{55688}De ce sunt doua steaguri|in Caraibe?
{55690}{55784}Nu am mai fost in contact pentru o luna,|sir. Nu am fost siguri care a plecat.
{55787}{55875}- Cine e acolo?|- Nepotul dvs., sir. Jimmy Bond.
{55877}{55965}Mai mult o dezamagire,|din pacate, micul Jimmy.
{55967}{56038}Asculta. Nu poti sa ma impusti.
{56040}{56095}I have a very low threshold of death.
{56098}{56198}Doctorul meu spune ca nu pot|fi impuscat niciodata.
{56279}{56328}What if I said I was pregnant?
{56437}{56552}Pot sa fumez o ultima tigara?|Ma voi lasa in orice zi de acum incolo.
{56555}{56604}Multumesc.
{56691}{56732}¡Listos!
{56752}{56821}Iti dai seama ca asta inseamna|o scrisoare cu repros catre The Times.
{56835}{56894}¡Apunten!
{56896}{56943}¡Fuego!
{56956}{57036}La revedere, fraierilor!
{57165}{57210}¡Apunten! ¡Fuego!
{57275}{57334}And so I think|we'd better count him out, sir.
{57337}{57442}Yes. Hadley, we're up against|an opposition of fiendish ingenuity.
{57444}{57524}- They make incredible use of women.|- Yes, they tend to nowadays.
{57527}{57646}Female spies harassed me in Scotland,|female spies chased me to London.
{57649}{57735}We need an AFSD -|Anti-Female-Spy Device.
{57748}{57844}We find the one man all women want,|then we train him not to want women.
{57854}{57921}Toti agentii nostri wantable |au disparut, sir.
{57923}{58013}Asta e momentul in care intervii tu.|Verifica toate documentele auxiliare.
{58015}{58066}Toate, sir? O sa dureze toate noaptea.
{58076}{58127}Mama ta lucra cel mai bine noaptea.
{59313}{59370}Sa continuam?
{59525}{59632}- Si care este numele tau?|- Cooper, Big Eyes. Dar spune-mi Coop.
{59635}{59719}- Ca un cotet de pasari.|- Asta's eu.
{59782}{59916}- Trebuie sa notez calificarea ta.|- Inaltime 6ft 1/2, 184lb.
{59918}{60023}Trofee la karate si judo,|detinator al centurii negre Kamasutra.
{60026}{60120}- Impresionant. Cum traduci asta?|- O sa-ti arat.
{60123}{60205}I have to check 15 more auxiliaries|in alphabetical...
{60208}{60325}Call Mr Zacharias and tell him not to|wait up. The vacancy's just been filled.
{60412}{60488}A first-class performance, Cooper.|Excellent.
{60490}{60582}- Your primary statistics fit the bill.|- We aim to please, sir.
{60584}{60650}You will start|your AFSD training immediately.
{60652}{60738}Moneypenny, get a few dozen girls|for Cooper to start with.
{60741}{60796}- Moneypenny?|- A few dozen girls...
{60798}{60853}I appreciate your confidence, sir.
{60856}{60959}All agents and trainees will now be known|as James Bond 007, including the girls.
{60962}{61005}Won't that be confusing, sir?
{61008}{61094}The enemy won't know which way|to turn. You are now James Bond.
{61104}{61161}Congratulations, 007.
{61164}{61234}And you, 007... sir.
{61236}{61285}Good hunting, 007.
{61873}{61932}Doesn't that do something to you, 007?
{61934}{62036}It does but I'm being trained to ignore it.|Beauty's only skin-deep.
{62054}{62125}How about some skin diving?
{62127}{62176}Not today, Lorelei.
{62179}{62228}Right. Ting-Ling.
{62313}{62403}You know that every fifth child|born in the world is Chinese?
{62406}{62511}- They'll have to keep it up without me.|- Why are you so inscrutable?
{62513}{62589}- That's meant to be our racket.|- You might be a double agent.
{62591}{62679}- What would you do if I was?|- Whether you are or not, sayonara.
{62734}{62783}Next. Shirley.
{62893}{62957}- You're not Shirley.|- No.
{62959}{63020}I'm the new secret weapon.
{63022}{63081}- I've just been perfected.|- Yes, haven't you?
{63084}{63160}- They've kept me under wraps.|- Lucky them.
{63211}{63260}What do you do that's so secret?
{63263}{63374}I don't do anything.|But unless you're one of them, you do.
{63513}{63599}You're really learning|to put up quite a resistance.
{63601}{63666}- It goes against my nature.|- I sense that too.
{63668}{63750}- What are you doing after the exercise?|- Getting my head examined.
{63956}{64052}Our man in Delhi tells us gold will|be up two points by midday tomorrow.
{64054}{64082}Buy gold.
{64085}{64183}- It'll cost you three nuclear warheads.|- Offer two.
{64185}{64246}Your offer for Rockefeller Center|is accepted.
{64249}{64337}I've changed my mind. I like London.|What about Lord Nelson's statue?
{64339}{64415}It was delivered today, Miss Lynd.
{64464}{64515}My dear Miss Lynd.
{64550}{64626}- Who are you, sir?|- I am Sir James Bond.
{64704}{64763}But I thought you were retired, Sir James.
{64766}{64832}The whole world believes|you were eaten by a shark.
{64834}{64922}That was no shark,|that was my personal submarine.
{64924}{64979}But enough of this polite conversation.
{64981}{65067}- What is the purpose of your visit?|- I desperately need your help.
{65069}{65180}My dear Sir James, I hardly ever|undertake assignments these days.
{65182}{65283}I can see why, but I think I can|persuade you to undertake this one.
{65285}{65352}Your reputation is remarkable.
{65354}{65440}But believe me when I say|I save all my energies for business.
{65470}{65552}I have here a writ|for just over £5 million tax arrears.
{65563}{65616}If you were to be cooperative,
{65618}{65698}I could arrange easy payments|and a substantial discount?
{65737}{65827}Perhaps we should discuss|this matter in comfort, Sir James.
{65830}{65918}Thank you. What a charming outfit that is.
{65920}{65983}Do you often wear that in the office?
{65985}{66056}If I wore it in the street,|people might stare.
{66082}{66143}You said, Sir James, you needed my help.
{66145}{66239}I did, didn't l? I have a dossier on a man|who works at the Buckingham Club.
{66241}{66290}His name is Evelyn Tremble.
{66545}{66623}Mr Evelyn Tremble?
{66677}{66769}- Yes, that's right.|- Isn't Evelyn a girl's name?
{66816}{66865}No, it's mine actually.
{66938}{67032}- Do you know me from somewhere?|- Your book: Tremble On Baccarat.
{67035}{67092}I've studied it very closely.
{67102}{67182}At night, in my bed.
{67207}{67256}Is that where you study it?
{67280}{67370}There are several passes|you describe in your book
{67373}{67424}which I don't fully understand.
{67427}{67476}Which passes are these?
{67479}{67588}They're all marked. I would|have to have my book. Your book.
{67633}{67690}And my book is in...
{67706}{67745}My bed.
{67972}{68031}You're winning tonight.
{68118}{68177}I'll send my car for you.
{68519}{68591}- Yes?|- Hello. It's me, Evelyn Tremble.
{68594}{68672}Hello, Mr Tremble.|Can you hold on for a moment?
{68932}{69047}Eric? Don't forget to empty|the deepfreeze first thing in the morning.
{69062}{69148}Hello, Mr Tremble.|I'm so sorry to keep you waiting,
{69150}{69205}but I was just seeing someone off.
{69208}{69290}Come right up, all right? Bye-bye.
{69345}{69402}- So nice of you to come.|- My pleasure.
{69405}{69441}This way.
{69443}{69527}The look of love
{69555}{69649}Is in your eyes
{69667}{69859}A look your smile can't disguise
{69899}{70014}The look oflove
{70051}{70230}It's saying so much more|than just words could ever say
{70289}{70359}And what my heart has heard
{70361}{70453}Well, it takes my breath away
{70478}{70548}I can hardly wait to hold you
{70555}{70620}Feel my arms around you
{70632}{70701}How long I have waited
{70703}{70754}Waited just to love you
{70757}{70839}Now that I have found you
{70855}{70966}You've got the look of love
{70988}{71078}It's on your face
{71104}{71303}The look that time can't erase
{71370}{71417}Hello.
{71446}{71495}Hello.
{71606}{71684}That's Lord Nelson, isn't it?
{71687}{71755}- Yes. Isn't he beautiful?|- Yes.
{71773}{71824}- And do you know what he said?|- What?
{71840}{71924}England expects every man|to do his duty.
{71944}{72106}So he did, yes. But this is Mayfair.|Lord Nelson's in Trafalgar Square surely.
{72116}{72198}No, not any more. He's mine.|Haven't you read the papers today?
{72200}{72309}- I don't normally get them quite so early.|- I get 'em before they're printed.
{72311}{72383}I suppose you can do anything|if you have money.
{72386}{72437}Why don't you come down to me?
{72498}{72551}Thank you very much.
{72553}{72608}Lovely place you've got down there.
{72611}{72660}Sit here.
{72767}{72864}I do so like to feel comfortable|whatever I'm doing.
{72866}{72971}Yes indeed. Yes.|The more relaxed the muscles,
{72973}{73088}the better the synchronisation|between mind and body.
{73106}{73198}I should think you're frightfully|synchronised, Mr Tremble.
{73300}{73366}- Martini?|- What about them?
{73368}{73432}I was just about to offer you one.
{73655}{73768}The things I didn't understand|too well in your book. Let me see...
{73771}{73857}Was it in chapter seven or chapter six?
{73904}{73961}Chapter six probably.
{73964}{74060}Though of course|it could have been chapter seven.
{74106}{74184}Have you got the book|or is it still in your bed?
{74217}{74266}I believe it is.
{74548}{74634}Well, we'd better go|right through the book, hadn't we?
{74945}{75019}Do you get many complaints|from the neighbours?
{75163}{75263}Do you really think that your system|is completely faultless?
{75265}{75353}- Which system?|- Your system for winning at baccarat.
{75360}{75551}Yes, yes.|The Evelyn Tremble system is faultless.
{75553}{75637}Good. Come on. We have more to do.
{75651}{75690}More?
{75693}{75765}I like a man who is able|to retain his own personality,
{75768}{75839}no matter what the circumstances.
{75871}{75905}Yes.
{75907}{75972}No matter how he's dressed.
{75995}{76071}They say it's the clothes|that make the man.
{76073}{76178}If we're gonna work together, I have|to know what kind of a man you are.
{76235}{76305}I thought you might have|gathered a little from...
{76307}{76405}I want to see what happens when|you put on a different hat, a costume.
{76407}{76464}You know, that sort of thing.
{76484}{76607}- You like that sort of thing, eh?|- You'll find clothes in there. Put them on.
{76628}{76693}Well, if you think it's really necessary.
{76695}{76750}Unless you'd like to|go around one more time.
{76753}{76802}One more time?
{77012}{77150}There is nothing wrong with the British|Army that a damn good swim won't cure.
{77172}{77248}Now, Evelyn Tremble.
{77251}{77320}38 years old, born in Highgate.
{77330}{77385}Hello, sailor.
{77484}{77533}The wrong one, yes?
{77582}{77623}Perfect.
{77625}{77724}Distinguishing birthmark,|little scar on right shoulder,
{77726}{77794}strawberry-shaped birthmark on left thigh.
{77796}{77860}Well, there's nothing unusual in that.
{77862}{77950}No. I myself have|an apricot one on my hip.
{77959}{78043}Well, I'll show you my strawberry|if you'll show me your apricot.
{78045}{78102}Author of a book on baccarat.
{78263}{78333}Have you ever heard of|a man called Le Chiffre?
{78344}{78445}Yes. An excellent card player.|He once wrote me a fan letter.
{78460}{78534}Keep your hands there. Perfect. Lovely.
{78577}{78707}I devoted a chapter to him in my book.|His forte is baccarat.
{78720}{78792}Beside baccarat, he deals in lechery.
{78811}{78862}Well, nobody's perfect.
{78874}{78977}Do you think you can|win against Le Chiffre?
{78980}{79120}Well, you'll remember that to operate|my system completely free of risk
{79122}{79192}a stake of £100,000 is required.
{79209}{79262}Yes, I remember.
{79265}{79314}Stand still.
{79407}{79576}I'm gonna give you a 500th at f2.
{79610}{79694}That's the nicest thing|that anyone's ever said to me.
{79762}{79871}What would you say if I offered|to stake you in a game against Le Chiffre?
{79920}{79956}What?
{79958}{80060}I put up the money, you play the game|and we split 50-50.
{80159}{80243}- I think I'll go now if you don't mind.|- What's wrong?
{80280}{80362}I enjoyed the earlier part|of this evening very much.
{80378}{80466}I shall always remember|the pleasure of your company.
{80468}{80548}I didn't even mind this dressing-up bit.
{80550}{80667}But I do mind bloody unnecessary jokes|about the one thing I really know well.
{80669}{80788}Evelyn, I'm serious. It's because you|know about baccarat that I'm not joking.
{80799}{80870}You said you needed £100,000?
{80921}{80982}- It's yours.|- That's fantastic.
{81008}{81113}But look here. Old Le Chiffre|would never agree to play me.
{81115}{81174}He's read my book.|He'd recognise my name.
{81176}{81244}- No, no. Not any more.|- Why?
{81255}{81325}We have chosen a new name for you.
{81338}{81385}James Bond.
{81405}{81477}Welcome to|the James Bond 007 training school.
{81480}{81595}It's a small Minnox camera, isn't it?|A friend of mine's got one of those.
{81598}{81653}- It's Mr Bond, isn't it?|- Yes.
{81656}{81717}If you'd be good enough to sign here, sir.
{81720}{81827}It's not for me.|It's for the Official Secrets Act.
{81829}{81855}Of course.
{81857}{81927}Eyes right!
{81956}{82003}Eyes front!
{82005}{82083}- Carry on, Sergeant Major.|- Yes, sir. Mark time!
{82112}{82175}Halt! About turn.
{82250}{82305}You really do stock|everything at Harrod's.
{82308}{82386}Don't pay too much attention.|It's all basic stuff.
{82388}{82456}It'll be out of date by the January sales.
{82562}{82629}- Good morning, Johnson.|- Sir!
{82855}{82906}May I tell you something?
{82909}{82981}- I'm being followed.|- I know. It's part of the training.
{82984}{83037}Shadowing people without being seen.
{83039}{83146}The whole point is I can quite clearly|see the man who is shadowing me.
{83184}{83274}Oh! Him. Don't worry about him.|He's not one of our trainees.
{83276}{83345}- He's our security man.|- I see.
{83353}{83435}Good morning, lnspector.|Don't let me interrupt you.
{83437}{83500}On the command,|the head is turned thus,
{83502}{83573}the hat is aimed thus,|the gun is fired thus.
{83679}{83742}Yes, we're still working on that one.
{83765}{83834}Now to Agents' Outfitting. Here we are.
{83874}{83942}- Morning, Q.|- Good morning, Fordyce. New man.
{83996}{84062}If I could bother you|for the signature, sir.
{84064}{84142}I shouldn't use that pen.|The moment the nib touches the paper,
{84145}{84235}it releases a stream of poisonous gas|into the writer's eye.
{84237}{84301}Good heavens!|What will they think of next?
{84303}{84356}I won't be going near that.
{84359}{84433}I suppose it's useful|if you want to send anyone a...
{84435}{84484}Poison-pen letter.
{84487}{84618}All our new men say that. I reply "I don't|wish to know that. Kindly leave Ml5."
{84637}{84742}Yes, sir. We have a very highly developed|sense of humour down here.
{84744}{84863}It isn't the only thing that's|highly developed down here. Fordyce!
{84866}{84929}- Wristwatch.|- Sir.
{84931}{85013}1965 Rolex Oyster Perpetual.
{85023}{85124}Date indicator and log table|round the outer band.
{85126}{85204}And a thing that shows you|what shape the moon is.
{85230}{85324}- Now, this is very important. Try it on.|- Let me help you.
{85327}{85432}It's your means of reporting to us|and our means of contacting you.
{85434}{85497}Channel six, Fordyce.
{85499}{85587}Don't worry too much about him, sir.|Channel six it is, sir.
{85590}{85670}I don't think I know|which one is which myself now, sir.
{85673}{85740}Look at your watch|and tell me what you see.
{85761}{85880}It's five and 20 minutes past 11 .|It's the 14th of March and...
{85892}{85953}I said channel six, Fordyce.
{85983}{86032}Well, nobody's perfect.
{86114}{86212}But it's absolutely amazing!|I've never seen anything like this.
{86226}{86306}It's a two-way television|and radio wristwatch.
{86327}{86425}It's an American idea. They got it|from one of their comic strips.
{86427}{86496}- Good heavens.|- Ah! Tea.
{86498}{86530}Three lumps.
{86532}{86593}It's an incredible thing, this.
{86596}{86670}Which side do you dress, sir?
{86672}{86808}- I usually dress away from the window.|- It's just some protective clothing, sir.
{86810}{86879}Let me help you|out of your hampering things.
{86950}{87005}And it is of course Sanforized, sir,
{87008}{87105}non-iron, and also available|in chocolate, oyster or clerical grey.
{87107}{87209}- It's hand-reefed and double-charvered.|- Is it?
{87211}{87297}- It's a little tight around the...|- Poison capsule compartment?
{87299}{87412}I'm sure we can let it out above|the switchblade and Geiger counter.
{87414}{87494}Do what you can, Fordyce.|Your intercom button's in here
{87497}{87567}with midget transmitters|for short-range contacts.
{87569}{87668}There's an infrared camera, a tape|recorder in the shoulder padding,
{87670}{87805}a Beretta in the buttonhole,|and a cute little minigun in the gusset.
{87807}{87856}Yes. Just one thing.
{87859}{87943}What happens|if I suddenly need to go somewhere?
{87951}{88070}In this, sir? You'll find safety|instructions under the left lapel.
{88090}{88172}Don't worry.|You're in very good hands here.
{88198}{88249}Now this won't hurt a bit, sir.
{88260}{88375}- Who g-gave you these orders?|- International Mothers' Help, East Berlin.
{88377}{88473}There it is, Hadley. Our only clue.|The voice of a beautiful woman.
{88475}{88584}We've checked it out, sir.|It's a Smersh cover operation, sir.
{88587}{88698}It supplies baby-sitters and au pair girls|to some of the most important families.
{88701}{88781}Then it must be infiltrated|by someone absolutely reliable.
{88783}{88861}- I hope you weren't thinking of me.|- I was thinking of Mata.
{88864}{88948}- You can't mean Mata Hari, sir.|- No, her daughter Mata Bond.
{88950}{89015}- Mata Bond, sir?|- Her mother gave her that name
{89017}{89101}because I happen to be|the child's sort of godfather.
{89103}{89201}And to think that you knew Mata Hari!|She really was one of the greats.
{89203}{89283}Yes. Great little dancer, terrible spy.
{89285}{89379}Whereas young Mata is a terrible dancer.|Might be a great little spy.
{94237}{94354}It's uncanny. Quite uncanny.|What memories it brings back.
{94357}{94484}Paris, Berlin, Vienna.|How madly we danced through the night.
{94486}{94584}- I was disguised as a Hungarian hussar...|- What are you going on about?
{94608}{94709}You're the very image of your mother|and every bit as beautiful.
{94711}{94766}You knew my mum?
{94784}{94833}I am Sir James Bond.
{94856}{94905}- Daddy!|- My child.
{94970}{95052}- Snail's egg?|- No, thanks. They don't agree with me.
{95071}{95145}Well, you're a charmer, aren't you?
{95183}{95300}You dump me in an orphanage when I'm|three, and now, because you need me...
{95303}{95395}It really was very difficult.|My career was at its height...
{95398}{95482}It was a traumatic experience,|I can tell you,
{95485}{95565}being the illegitimate daughter|of Mata Hari and James Bond.
{95568}{95637}Still, you do get my monthly paychecks?
{95653}{95731}Your monthly paychecks|went on analysts' fees.
{95734}{95808}That's why I came here.|I had to get away from it all.
{95810}{95904}I had no idea. Well, I must say,|you seem to be very comfortable here.
{95906}{95971}It's crazy. You want a drag?
{95973}{96061}No, thank you. I'm trying to give that up.|Who are all these people?
{96063}{96135}They're the high priests of the temple.|OK, Fred. Hop it.
{96354}{96440}Extraordinary performance.|They seem to treat you like a goddess.
{96443}{96556}Well, I am the Celestial Virgin|of the Sacred Altar.
{96586}{96676}- Figuratively speaking, of course.|- Of course. Some tea.
{96679}{96736}A cup of tea. Splendid.
{96739}{96846}It's made from poppy seeds. Two cups of|this and you're stoned out of your mind.
{96849}{96879}Thank you.
{96882}{96993}You know, if you weren't my dad,|I think I could fancy you.
{97024}{97083}Well, that's very good of you, my dear.
{97086}{97178}- Rather warm in here, don't you think?|- Cool it, Charlie.
{97181}{97232}So you want me to go to Berlin, huh?
{97235}{97315}Now, Mata. You remember|the old house on the Feldmannstrasse?
{97318}{97419}- Where Mum had her dancing school.|- It's become lnternational Mothers' Help.
{97421}{97495}But that's just a cover|for its real function. It is...
{97497}{97566}- Does he speak English?|- Hey, Charlie. Speak English?
{97568}{97617}- No.|- Good.
{97620}{97702}It is a training centre for what|are commonly referred to as spies.
{97705}{97797}You are eminently suited|to infiltrate the organisation.
{97799}{97877}Two weeks' briefing in London|and you're off to Berlin.
{97921}{97974}You want me to be a spy like Mum, huh?
{98000}{98059}- Well!|- Family tradition, my dear.
{98062}{98152}Do I get an exploding briefcase|and a secret transmitter?
{98154}{98226}- That won't be necessary.|- I have to have some equipment.
{98228}{98341}Your mother wiped out three divisions|of infantry and five of cavalry and...
{98344}{98434}Well, frankly, she had|much less equipment than you have.
{98605}{98681}If you have any problems,|contact London immediately.
{98683}{98781}- Are there any questions?|- Well, I have got one question.
{98783}{98859}- How do I get to Berlin?|- Oh, dear! Silly me.
{98862}{98911}Taxi!
{98935}{98976}- Where to?|- Berlin.
{98978}{99029}- East or West?|- West, of course.
{99032}{99087}Well, that's all right, then.
{99090}{99195}- Say goodbye to Dad for me.|- Yes. Have a good trip. Jolly good luck.
{99323}{99397}Get out of it, you lunatic!|What are you trying to do?
{99414}{99502}Come on! Move. Get out of it.|Get out the way! Go on.
{99813}{99907}- That'll be £482 15s 9d.|- You'll have to wait.
{99909}{99987}I've been caught like that before.|I haven't had my dinner yet.
{99989}{100058}- I don't have any change.|- Here we go.
{100109}{100158}What about my dinner then, eh?
{100161}{100232}What a liberty. Any fish and chip shops|round here, mush?
{101501}{101554}Who are you? What do you want?
{101608}{101678}I'm here to enrol as a student.
{101686}{101741}What are your qualifications?
{101771}{101859}- I am the daughter of Mata Hari.|- Mata Hari!
{101861}{101930}- You are a liar.|- Am l?
{101975}{102046}Well, what about this, then?
{102048}{102132}My little Mata Hari!
{102135}{102237}- I told you she'd come back!|- Silence! Or I will switch you off.
{102260}{102354}Not that! Anything but that.
{102357}{102451}You're even more|fascinating than your mother.
{102464}{102527}You must be Frau Hoffner,|Mum's teacher.
{102529}{102590}- I had that honour.|- You must be Polo.
{102602}{102696}She remembers me, her little Polo.|She remembers me.
{102699}{102752}- Welcome home.|- Welcome indeed.
{102755}{102798}Shtum!
{102818}{102956}The Mata Hari School of Dancing is the|only international school of espionage.
{102958}{103015}There is no political prejudice here.
{103017}{103134}We train Russian spies for America|und American spies for Russia.
{103136}{103203}- Very democratic.|- Very democratic.
{103233}{103346}Some of the greatest spies in the world|have graduated from this institution.
{103348}{103442}- Von Grudendorf, Malenvosky...|- Peter Lorre, Bela Lugosi.
{103444}{103522}Here we have|the decoding and cipher class.
{103725}{103803}We are even training animals|as espionage agents.
{103806}{103896}We have in the Kremlin|a Russian-speaking parrot
{103899}{103977}in constant radio communication|with the Pentagon.
{103980}{104046}Und here is our class|in karate und self-defence.
{104183}{104251}Excuse me. I have|an important conference to attend.
{104253}{104310}Polo, you will show Mata to her room.
{104313}{104362}Please, follow me.
{104498}{104559}Mata? Allow me.
{104607}{104666}- Thank you.|- Follow me.
{104781}{104851}My battery needs recharging.
{104870}{104979}- Might be your head needs examining.|- No, I had that examined last week.
{105013}{105149}This is your mother's room. It has not|been opened since she left here in 1916.
{105277}{105334}You see? Nothing has been touched.
{105336}{105385}It's a wild room.
{105405}{105464}Hey, what an enormous bed.
{105467}{105553}The German army|was very large in those days.
{105584}{105689}To see you here in your mother's room|brings back such happy memories.
{105708}{105767}Here.
{105769}{105915}What's all this about|an important conference, hm?
{105959}{106025}A representative of Le Chiffre is coming.
{106097}{106132}Tonight.
{106134}{106191}Who is Le Chiffre?
{106193}{106242}Nobody knows.
{106298}{106351}Not even Le Chiffre.
{106387}{106446}What's the conference about then, hm?
{106490}{106625}Le Chiffre is trying to raise money|by selling his unique art collection.
{106650}{106752}- Why does he need money?|- He is a compulsive gambler, that's why.
{106754}{106863}Und he is using organisation funds|for his gambling!
{106880}{106937}- You mean Smersh?|- Smersh!
{106991}{107104}If he does not pay off his debts,|he will be liquidated.
{107107}{107187}Liquidated? Who by?
{107190}{107249}- By them.|- You mean...?
{107251}{107317}You're so like your mother.|You're driving me mad.
{107319}{107440}- Well, you haven't got far to go.|- Come to me, my little Mata. Come!
{107467}{107530}About time you were|back in your box, innit?
{107532}{107606}You must forgive me.|I lose control of myself.
{107609}{107676}- I'm a mad fool. Mad.|- You want an argument?
{107701}{107783}- Remember, forget everything I tell you.|- My lips are sealed.
{107785}{107859}- Lips! Don't say such words.|- Run along, sonny.
{107888}{107941}Le Chiffre. Mm-hm.
{108255}{108316}It's the first john|I've ever gone round with.
{109568}{109648}There you are.|I have been looking for you.
{109650}{109722}- It is little Otto.|- Who is he?
{109725}{109815}One of your mother's lovers.|We often find them lying around.
{109817}{109889}- Is he dead?|- Hard to tell. He always looked like that.
{109892}{109982}Come along, child.|The auction is about to begin.
{110000}{110016}Auction?
{110019}{110107}Tonight we are selling one of|the finest art collections in Europe.
{110110}{110192}- Le Chiffre's collection.|- Who is Le Chiffre?
{110194}{110262}- The man who owns the collection.|- What collection?
{110264}{110346}- The one to be auctioned.|- Who said anything about an auction?
{110349}{110390}- You did.|- Who am l?
{110393}{110473}- Frau Hoffner.|- Never heard of her. You're insane.
{110475}{110561}- Quite insane.|- I think she's right.
{110611}{110713}Gentlemen! Please take your seats|and the auction will commence.
{110715}{110762}Thank you.
{110764}{110887}Gentlemen, I am here tonight on behalf of|Le Chiffre, of whom you will have heard,
{110889}{110960}to auction this unique collection|of art treasures.
{110969}{111043}Are there any specific|bidding instructions?
{111046}{111151}When we sit, we are bidding.|When we stand, we are not bidding.
{111167}{111276}We'll do our bidding sitting down.|When we stand up, we're not bidding.
{111279}{111338}We stand, we bid.|We no stand, we no bid.
{111341}{111406}And the British representatives?
{111408}{111513}Well, I don't know actually.|A bit of both, I suppose, really.
{111515}{111584}- Is that all right with you chaps?|- That's fine.
{111590}{111645}Very well, gentlemen.
{111670}{111725}Now then.
{111728}{111806}This is an extraordinarily|embarrassing item,
{111808}{111872}one of the classic|blackmail items of all time.
{111874}{111931}What am I bid for this priceless picture?
{111944}{111993}£14 10s.

{112353}{112402}- Here!|- Stop it!
{112405}{112485}Whatever you do, you must not|let Le Chiffre raise the money.
{112488}{112537}Who are you?
{112574}{112623}I'm Carleton Towers of the FO.
{112626}{112681}- FO?|- The Foreign Office, dear.
{112684}{112737}Wait outside and keep the motor running.

{113556}{113644}Hello! Hello! Get me the Pentagon!
{113652}{113701}Hello, Fenella?
{113704}{113811}I shan't be able to get back|for dinner. A sort of war's broken out.
{114141}{114210}You should not have done this thing.
{114212}{114290}Now I will have to kill you.
{114360}{114409}What are you doing to me?
{114455}{114504}No!
{114578}{114670}Positive, negative -|I never know which is which.
{114917}{114966}Give me those films.
{115093}{115148}She's got the films!
{115179}{115248}Grab her! Get her! Get her!
{115677}{115738}Now look here.
{115925}{115978}- Taxi!|- Tally-ho!
{116252}{116301}I'm sorry, madam.
{116313}{116393}- Let me go! Taxi!|- Over here!
{116495}{116544}Come on!
{116721}{116793}- Good Lord! Captain Towers?|- How nice to see you.
{116858}{116907}This way!
{116976}{117029}No, no! Down. No.
{117142}{117201}- Where to, miss?|- London!
{117859}{117920}- Le Chiffre speaking.|- The scheme was a failure.
{117930}{118001}And also Dr Noah knows|what you've been up to.
{118012}{118096}- What now?|- I'll just have to raise the money.
{118110}{118198}- But how?|- How? By playing baccarat.
{118209}{118276}But Le Chiffre, what about me?
{118286}{118335}What's going to happen to me?
{119123}{119207}Thank you.|And welcome to France, Monsieur Bond.
{119328}{119420}We don't want our little talk|to be overheard. Get in the car.
{119423}{119494}Well, there's nothing|to talk about, is there?
{119496}{119545}Perhaps. Perhaps not.
{119548}{119628}The point is you must not|allow yourself to become involved.
{119630}{119749}Don't forget there are many people here|who loathe and despise you.
{120057}{120139}I have to warn you, Bond,|my instructions are
{120142}{120232}that you play your game|with Le Chiffre and leave immediately.
{120245}{120350}No one can be such a perverse idiot|as to assault a customs official.
{120352}{120434}- It may just be natural talent, sir.|- I have to warn Vesper.
{120437}{120503}- You mean James Bond 007, sir.|- Yes, yes, yes.
{120796}{120853}Vesper? James Bond 007?
{120869}{120953}- Vesper, are you there?|- Hello, Sir James. Yes, I'm here.
{120956}{121027}I can't see you. Your picture's gone.
{121029}{121098}No, it hasn't. I was|just getting into the bath.
{121127}{121197}Vesper, do you think|Tremble could be a double agent?
{121209}{121293}He has enough trouble being|a single agent. Leave him to me.
{121304}{121361}Right. Over and out.
{121524}{121573}Mr Bond?
{121576}{121625}Missed, Mr Bond.
{121651}{121686}Yes.
{121688}{121755}I am Miss Goodthighs.
{121757}{121806}I can see that.
{121833}{121907}You've got your cork still in your bottle.
{121919}{121983}So I have. What are you|going to do about it?
{122037}{122094}Stick your arm out.
{122189}{122273}The management of the Hotel Tropical|send their compliments
{122275}{122342}and hope you will enjoy your stay with us.
{122478}{122527}I see.
{122549}{122623}Very sexy pants you're wearing, James.
{122640}{122705}Yes, they're the new double-O-fronts.
{122707}{122773}Tell me, Miss Goodthighs,
{122775}{122841}how much did you tip the porter|to let you in here?
{122846}{122926}- I just showed him a little kindness.|- How much?
{122934}{122989}Not too much. He's 83.
{122991}{123040}It's a good year.
{123071}{123112}So...
{123126}{123175}What can I do for you?
{123178}{123247}The question should be|what can I do for you?
{123249}{123321}- Have you got any suggestions?|- This, for one.
{123771}{123820}Tell me about yourself, James.
{123862}{123962}Well, I've had some|pretty wild times in my life.
{124064}{124163}Could you move over a bit?|You're lying on my loose change.
{124208}{124271}James, I need you.
{124273}{124357}Yes, yes, yes.|Well, I can understand that, my dear.
{124375}{124476}- I want to know you better.|- You're absolutely right.
{124515}{124581}My goodness, this is strong shampoo.
{124583}{124632}This really is.
{124635}{124701}I think I'd better|freshen up a bit quick.
{124711}{124822}I'll be back in five minutes.|If I'm not, start without me.
{124909}{124989}James Bond playing at Casino Royale
{124991}{125093}He won a lot of money|and a gal at Casino Royale
{125231}{125297}Oh, he's not really|such a wonderful spy
{125313}{125422}But winning lots of money|and a gal, he's a fabulous guy
{126480}{126529}Evelyn! Evelyn!
{126552}{126605}Evelyn! Evelyn!
{126612}{126657}Evelyn! Evelyn!
{126668}{126738}Evelyn, wake up!|Evelyn, what's the matter?
{126745}{126837}- Wake up! You were drugged.|- What?
{126845}{126937}- You were drugged.|- Yes, I know I was drugged.
{126939}{126996}I put the antidote pill in. And then...
{126999}{127118}Hey, I thought those antidote pills were|supposed to give me 24-hour protection.
{127121}{127209}- I've got to get Sir James Bond...|- There is no time for that.
{127211}{127316}Look at you! You're wearing your glasses|and you know you're not supposed to.
{127319}{127370}James Bond doesn't wear glasses.
{127373}{127467}Yes, but l... It's just that|I like to see who I'm shooting.
{127470}{127595}There are only a few hours left|before the game. Now, get freshened up.
{127597}{127656}Here, what about Miss Goodthighs?
{127686}{127778}Don't worry. I took care of her.|Now concentrate on the game.
{127840}{127906}Vesper, I've given this game|a lot of thought.
{127908}{127963}When I go into that casino tonight,
{127965}{128070}I'm going to sit down opposite|Le Chiffre, look him in the eye and say...
{128428}{128477}No cards.
{128498}{128567}- Neuf à la banque.|- It's amazing! He never loses.
{128576}{128652}La banque gagne. La partie est terminée.
{128654}{128705}Quiet. Absolute silence, please.
{128707}{128804}For this experiment, I require|the assistance of a young lady.
{128806}{128863}You, madam. Look me in the eyes!
{128908}{128977}And you, Georges,|keep your eyes on my chips.
{128999}{129093}I present you with the levitation|of the Princess Ayisha,
{129122}{129239}an illusion taught to me|by an ancient vegetarian
{129242}{129324}in the mountain fastnesses of Tibet.
{129511}{129595}She feels no pain.|My assistants will enshroud her
{129597}{129668}in this perfectly ordinary paisley shawl.
{129738}{129810}Now will you all|place your hands on the table?
{130287}{130344}Now let's get the show off the ground.
{130501}{130626}Keep your hand in place, madam,|and continue to ascend into thin air.
{130654}{130715}Don't take your eyes from her,|not one of you.
{130718}{130775}It is by your perfect concentration
{130777}{130849}that the young lady|remains floating in thin air.
{130852}{130938}Excuse me, madam.|Sorry to keep you hanging around.
{131110}{131173}Monsieur. You wish to make a deposit?
{131175}{131245}- Yes.|- How much?
{131247}{131329}- £100,000 sterling.|- One hundred thou...
{131344}{131409}You can keep the case|with my compliments.
{131430}{131508}Thank you, monsieur.|Could we have the name, please?
{131523}{131568}Bond. James Bond.
{131577}{131626}James B...
{131663}{131737}- James Bond?|- Yes, James Bond.
{131760}{131817}Yes. James Bond.
{131839}{131933}I wonder if you'd be kind enough|to sign my autograph book.
{131951}{132039}It's not for me, you understand.|It's my little sister.
{132041}{132092}I wonder if you'd be kind enough
{132095}{132193}to put your autograph on that receipt|for the £100,000 sterling.
{132195}{132256}But of course, Mr Bond.
{132258}{132319}It's not for me, it's for somebody else.
{132344}{132426}- Now what happens?|- We go to the casino director's office.
{132428}{132483}Point me. Just point me.
{132604}{132680}- What's the matter?|- Nothing.
{132683}{132767}Just a bit different|from the Buckingham Club, that's all.
{132823}{132903}- Bond has arrived.|- Bond is here. All staff on the alert.
{132939}{132988}Come in.
{133022}{133088}Ah! Hello. How nice to see you again.
{133090}{133141}- May I introduce...|- We have met.
{133167}{133232}Mr Slymington-Jones, Mr James Bond.
{133239}{133305}How do you do?|Do make yourself comfortable.
{133418}{133487}I see you've put a tiger in your office.
{133510}{133617}Yes. I have several actually.|That one that you so cleverly spotted,
{133620}{133671}the head on the wall over there,
{133674}{133766}and the one you're about to trip over.|Do be careful.
{133769}{133814}Yes.
{133856}{133917}The man in the white coat is Le Chiffre.
{133919}{133986}Don't be afraid. It's a one-way mirror.
{133988}{134037}- Which way?|- That way.
{134096}{134145}- No card.|- No card.
{134199}{134248}Neuf à la banque.
{134266}{134358}Mr Bond, you can watch|Le Chiffre better on here.
{134424}{134514}He's bought the bank for the evening,|and he's winning consistently.
{134516}{134582}And showing off|with his magic throughout.
{134906}{134965}- Why the dark glasses?|- Here.
{135117}{135189}So if Le Chiffre wears|the same kind of glasses,
{135192}{135241}he knows every card on the table.
{135244}{135301}- Infrared glasses.|- The cheat!
{135340}{135389}Listen, Evelyn.
{135392}{135486}You win and he will almost certainly|be killed by his organisation.
{135488}{135568}- But he'd try and avoid that, wouldn't he?|- If you win, yes.
{135570}{135619}- How?|- By trying to kill you.
{135622}{135712}- As in dead?|- Yes. But don't worry about that now.
{135719}{135801}Let's go down there|and you play the game of your life.
{135804}{135909}Yes, I better had. There may|not be too much more of it left.
{135975}{136073}- Vesper...|- Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
{136185}{136265}- Well, then. It's all under control now.|- I hope so.
{136281}{136330}- Well, excuse me.|- Willingly.
{136534}{136583}Messieurs, faites vos jeux.
{136921}{136985}I believe you have my name|in a crevice. James Bond.
{136987}{137057}- Pardon, monsieur?|- Bond. James Bond.
{137059}{137108}Oh, yes, Mr Bond.
{137120}{137214}Bond? James Bond?|The name is familiar.
{137228}{137287}I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
{137301}{137375}- I'm flattered you've heard of me.|- I have heard of you,
{137377}{137451}but not as an expert on baccarat.
{137453}{137504}Well, I'm sorry you weren't told.
{137638}{137705}Don't think that went unnoticed, Mr Bond.
{137728}{137795}I see everything that goes on at this table.
{137820}{137888}- Nothing escapes me.|- I'm quite sure it doesn't.
{137890}{137939}But we mustn't forget that
{137942}{138014}the beggar who is in the marketplace
{138016}{138100}is completely deaf|insomuch as far as listening
{138103}{138189}to the song that is coming|from the mockingbird is concerned.
{138191}{138254}I'm sorry, Mr Bond,|I don't get the connection.
{138292}{138328}You will.
{138357}{138406}Sim salabim.
{138616}{138671}When you're quite ready.
{138674}{138779}Now I require a perfectly ordinary|gentleman's pocket handkerchief.
{138782}{138882}From the pocket|of one perfectly ordinary gentleman.
{138884}{138951}That's the kind of remark|that leads to war.
{138953}{139002}How much better for all humanity
{139005}{139093}if all the nations could learn|to live together in peace.
{139096}{139153}Marvellous!
{139194}{139218}More!
{139395}{139495}That's finished, is it?|Fantastic. Wonderful. Incredible.
{139497}{139626}Incredible, isn't it? Absolutely marvellous.|I've never seen anything like it.
{139660}{139763}And now if you're ready, Monsieur|Le Chiffre, I would like to play baccarat.
{139765}{139843}- I use the Evelyn Tremble method.|- You read Tremble.
{139872}{139956}I thought he'd only published|a few paperback editions.
{139959}{140023}Well, I have an autographed first edition.
{140025}{140121}It's a bit dog-eared now, mind you,|but it nevertheless has a certain...
{140123}{140176}Uninformed quality?
{140252}{140348}Six à la ponte et neuf à la banque.|La banque gagne.
{140359}{140423}Aren't you a little|out of your depth, Mr Bond?
{140425}{140517}In the last 20 minutes I have ruined|two Greeks and a maharajah.
{140520}{140604}You know, Mr Bond,|we aren't playing for marbles.
{140606}{140734}The night is young and the rose garden|is already littered with my victims.
{140736}{140874}Yes, but the beggar in marketplace|are deaf to song of nightingale.
{140885}{140975}- You amuse me, Mr Bond.|- I'm glad you're enjoying me.
{140982}{141049}Shall we double the bank?
{141073}{141134}If it'll improve your game.
{141320}{141381}Pas de cartes.|No card.
{141659}{141727}- Sept à la banque.|- He never loses!
{141739}{141796}Cinq à la ponte. La banque gagne.
{141798}{141867}What about one for the road?
{141885}{141975}It looks as though luck isn't|on your side of the road, old man.
{141978}{142035}She has a habit of moving around.
{142038}{142122}Then we might as well|double the bank again.
{142185}{142242}Suppose I were to treble it?
{142245}{142304}Treble it? You haven't any chips!
{142360}{142413}I think my credit's good.
{142460}{142509}Bond credit good.
{142512}{142571}The bank now stands at 50 million francs.
{142746}{142795}Very well.
{142817}{142884}Goodbye, Mr Bond.|It's been nice knowing you.
{143232}{143287}Pas de cartes.|No card.
{143810}{143869}- Baccarat.|- He lost!
{143926}{143975}La ponte gagne.
{143978}{144045}Goodbye, Monsieur Le Chiffre.|It was nice knowing you.
{144047}{144127}Let's not say goodbye, Mr Bond.|Let's just say au revoir.
{144129}{144188}- Lovely!|- Credit my account, would you?
{144220}{144279}La partie est terminée.
{144298}{144413}- A remarkable performance, Mr Bond.|- Thank you. Trifle unusual but...
{144416}{144484}- How would you like the money?|- A cheque in a Swiss bank.
{144486}{144578}- Would you like the cheque now?|- Yes, now, yes.
{144581}{144649}I'll tell the cashier.|You can pick it up as you go out.
{144651}{144700}- Excuse me.|- Willingly.
{144736}{144845}Mr Bond, what are your movements|for the rest of the evening?
{144866}{144985}We thought we'd have a bite to eat|and then back to the hotel.
{144987}{145059}And you're leaving Royale|first thing in the morning.
{145061}{145087}Are we?
{145090}{145168}The inspector isn't asking us.|He's telling us.
{145171}{145257}A police car will escort you|from the hotel to the airport.
{145260}{145305}- Mr Mathis.|- Yes?
{145307}{145358}Something's been worrying me.
{145361}{145462}You're a French police officer|and yet you have a Scots accent.
{145469}{145545}Aye. It worries me, too.
{146172}{146250}Haven't by any chance seen|a young lady in a green dress?
{146252}{146326}Would that be a lady|with a black bag over her head
{146329}{146393}being manhandled|by two unsavoury gentlemens?
{146395}{146454}- Could very well be.|- She went that way, sir.
{146456}{146530}In a car. A very fast car!
{146548}{146597}- Moss?|- Yes, sir.
{146600}{146649}- Follow that car!|- Yes, sir.
{146688}{146739}I'll use Fangio next time. Idiot!
{146798}{146853}Grand Prix enthusiasts may be worried
{146855}{146943}by the time it's taken me|to get into this Lotus Formula Three.
{146946}{147063}They don't realise that although Le Chiffre|thinks he has a faster car than me,
{147066}{147127}I am faster in my Lotus Formula Three!
{147509}{147562}Wake up, Mr Bond. Wake up.
{147658}{147754}Well, now, Mr Bond. You've had|your little victory at the baccarat table.
{147756}{147838}Now it's my turn. I'm going to|have to have that cheque, Mr Bond.
{147841}{147900}Smersh is going to be very unhappy.
{147903}{148002}- You mean you're going to torture me?|- Persuade you, Mr Bond. Persuade you.
{148124}{148247}Don't worry about that chair with the hole.|It's merely waiting to be reupholstered.
{148250}{148315}- By me.|- You have an inventive mind, Mr Bond.
{148317}{148383}But my methods are much more subtle.|They have to be.
{148393}{148498}- What are you going to do?|- Physically, I'm not going to do anything.
{148501}{148558}Oh, you're going to nothing me to death.
{148575}{148700}Torture of the mind. The most|exquisite torture is all in the mind.
{149017}{149070}I'm going to have to|have that cheque, Mr Bond.
{149298}{149355}Suppose Mr Bond isn't ready|to give it to you?
{149357}{149431}You are a tiresome little man.|Let's try another approach.
{149487}{149542}It's a beauty contest, Mr Bond.
{149797}{149852}You're supposed to pick the winner.
{151452}{151561}- Excuse me. Are you Richard Burton?|- No, I'm Peter O'Toole.
{151563}{151631}Then you're the finest man|that ever breathed.
{151677}{151734}- God bless you, sir.|- Thank you.
{152469}{152516}You've changed my plans, Miss Lynd.
{152518}{152598}But neither you nor Bond will leave here|till I get that cheque!
{152601}{152644}Mr Tremble?
{152684}{152754}Never trust a rich spy.
{152805}{152935}Le Chiffre, you're a fool. Smersh|believed you could win at baccarat.
{152943}{153006}- All I need is 24 hours!|- It's too late.
{153578}{153703}Oh, Daddy, I do so long to meet him.|All the girls do. He really turns me on.
{153705}{153789}- Did that finishing school teach you that?|- No, I taught them.
{153791}{153862}Now run along and watch|the Changing of the Guard.
{153864}{153969}- I bet Mummy would have taken me in.|- Mummy took everyone in.
{154797}{154854}Put me down! Put me down!!
{154857}{154929}- What is it, a film?|- It must be a commercial.
{155996}{156076}No time for window-gazing, Moneypenny.|Mata's been kidnapped.
{156079}{156148}- But...|- That's an unidentified flying object.
{156150}{156218}And our fastest jets|trying to track it down. Control?
{156220}{156277}- That's the canteen.|- Control!
{156280}{156362}Contact all operatives.|We must find out where it lands.
{156364}{156456}- Air Ministry. They've lost it.|- Lost it? You were right on its tail.
{156459}{156528}Well, you must have|one plane fast enough... I see.
{156530}{156591}They stopped building those last week.
{156641}{156702}I wonder if you'd care to help us.
{156717}{156809}- Could you come back...|- Do please come in, Sister.
{156848}{156922}It's our annual collection for needy girls.
{157009}{157062}Your receipt?
{157135}{157248}This department has always been|very helpful to needy girls.
{157268}{157348}That's strange.|We've never had a receipt before.
{157415}{157524}"They're taking your daughter|to Casino Royale. Sister McTarry."
{157590}{157639}The Prime Minister, urgently.
{158625}{158664}Daddy'll come after me.
{158666}{158756}- That's what we're hopin'.|- You won't get away with this.
{158778}{158870}Move to the door, Mata Bond.|You are a prisoner of Smersh.
{158873}{158986}We already have most of your father's|agents here. You will complete the set.
{159191}{159279}- Looks like a Smersh convention.|- Le directeur wishes to see you.
{159281}{159377}- It is about your daughter.|- Tactic 4B if necessary.
{159443}{159502}I will tell him you are here.
{160221}{160270}Hold it! Back up.
{160337}{160386}Face the curtains!
{160404}{160453}March!
{160474}{160566}You are now entering|the Smersh headquarters of Dr Noah.
{160596}{160645}Tactic 33A.
{160746}{160795}Now!
{161349}{161435}Operation James Bond completed.
{161437}{161504}Dr Noah, I presume.|Why don't you come out and face me?
{161506}{161565}Because you are going to|come in and face me.
{161567}{161616}Sir!
{161655}{161704}Moneypenny!
{162276}{162362}This is an historic day|in our saga, Sir James.
{162386}{162489}The day Smersh finally eliminated|the original James Bond.
{162497}{162581}- His world will soon follow.|- This is all very impressive.
{162583}{162677}You might be even more impressed|to meet one of my 1,000 doubles.
{162759}{162856}Waiting for the moment when|I command them to take over the world.
{162869}{162924}It's fantastic. May I take a closer look?
{162936}{162989}It's quite perfect.
{163373}{163445}- Good Lord! It's my nephew.|- Jimmy Bond?
{163448}{163565}This explains the Caribbean assignment.|Is this some kind of a joke?
{163616}{163690}- He can't speak!|- Never could in my presence.
{163692}{163788}Psychological block he's had since|childhood, based on hero worship.
{163790}{163887}- He's Dr Noah?|- My nephew the head of Smersh?
{163894}{164015}I have been bombed, bullied and baited|out of retirement to deal with you?
{164018}{164092}- Do you suppose he's a junkie?|- Leave this to me.
{164095}{164192}Now, Jimmy, as your uncle|I really must insist...
{164194}{164274}- What is it?|- He's put a sheet of glass between us.
{164421}{164518}I never should have let Nellie|send him to progressive school.
{164570}{164609}What's that?
{164611}{164730}Dr Noah's bacillus? Now, Jimmy,|even you wouldn't release germ warfare.
{164743}{164854}Handle these capsules with care.|Dr Noah's bacillus is highly contagious.
{164857}{164947}When distributed in the atmosphere|it will make all women beautiful
{164949}{165008}and destroy all men over 4ft 6.
{165011}{165118}- Please handle these capsules with care.|- So that's your plan, huh?
{165120}{165235}A world full of beautiful women|and all men shorter than yourself.
{165584}{165703}Good evening. All this just to make up|for your feeling of sexual inferiority?
{165954}{166030}I'm beginning to think|you're a trifle neurotic.
{166528}{166626}Maybe you can explain. Why was I|abducted and subjected to this?
{166635}{166748}Because, of all Uncle James's 007s,|you're the most beautiful and desirable.
{166751}{166814}Do you treat|all the girls you desire this way?
{166816}{166906}Yes! I undress them and tie them up.|I learned that in the Boy Scouts.
{166909}{167011}Let me ask you a question.|Do I appear menacing to you at all?
{167013}{167083}- What are you laughing at?|- Nothing. I just think...
{167085}{167175}Did you see yourself in the mirror lately?|I think you should.
{167177}{167288}You are a wretched, grotesque,|ridiculous, insignificant little monster.
{167291}{167394}Are you saying to me that you find|Uncle James more attractive than I am?
{167396}{167484}Uncle James? He's a real man. Wow!
{167487}{167577}Do you realise that anything|Uncle James can do I can do better?
{167580}{167637}That will be the day.
{168861}{168926}You're crazy. You are absolutely crazy.
{168934}{169028}- They called Einstein crazy.|- No one ever called Einstein crazy.
{169031}{169130}- They would have if he behaved like this.|- People respected Einstein.
{169132}{169216}Einstein could never have conceived|of something like this.
{169218}{169327}It looks like an aspirin, it tastes|like an aspirin, but it's not an aspirin.
{169329}{169452}- It's cyanide.|- This pill contains 400 tiny time pills.
{169454}{169540}They go off in the body,|forming a chain reaction,
{169543}{169604}and turn the person|into a walking atomic bomb.
{169607}{169681}Einstein's bomb was crude.|This is brilliant.
{169690}{169739}It's crude to tie up women.
{169744}{169818}In a week it'll be|April Fools' Day, my birthday.
{169821}{169942}All world leaders will be assassinated|and my doubles will take their places.
{169944}{170005}In five days' time|I'll be ruler of the Earth.
{170029}{170115}- How would you like to be my co-ruler?|- Why not?
{170118}{170200}- Why not? You hate me.|- I don't know.
{170202}{170282}I'm beginning to wonder|if the real genius of the Bond family
{170284}{170349}is not right here in the room with me now.
{170375}{170428}- Why don't you unlock me?|- Yes, I will.
{170430}{170502}I'll unlock you immediately|and we'll run amok.
{170505}{170564}If you're too tired, we'll walk amok.
{170567}{170661}I'm so sorry for all the things I said.|I didn't really mean it.
{170664}{170777}- Here. Slip into this.|- Just a moment. Be careful.
{170780}{170835}Yes. I don't want to|damage any of your parts.
{170838}{170887}Multam.
{170945}{170984}Multumesc.
{170986}{171086}Now, turn yourself like a nice fool|while I slip this on.
{171088}{171137}Da. Da, astept aici.
{171140}{171245}Aceasta ii va arata lui Sir James odata pentru totdeauna|care din noi are un corp perfect.
{171247}{171308}The poor boob! Grabeste-te, draga.
{171311}{171374}Am planuri mari pentru noi.
{171436}{171524}It's vaporised lysergic acid.|Este foarte exploziv.
{171571}{171649}Intrati acum in|avionul personal al lui Dr Noah
{171651}{171729}Unde dragul nostru conducator|a asamblat ____a collection
{171732}{171797}of the world's|most distinguished doubles.
{171799}{171902}Avionul spatial a Dr Noah|va ureaza bine ati venit la bord.
{171920}{172037}A great likeness, isn't she?|I copied her right down to the last...
{172039}{172146}Doi dintre noi au avut cateva|experiente religioase.
{172149}{172241}Cum iti place locul asta? Am un|decorator care ma ajuta, dar lucrez cu ea.
{172244}{172310}Seful vostru|has remoulded ordinary agents
{172312}{172435}into replicas of the world's greatest|figures in culture, politics and the arts.
{172438}{172514}- Look! They're uncovered!|- These are not doubles.
{172517}{172615}These are the real people. I've already|substituted my robots for them.
{172617}{172726}La acest moment lumea este condusa|de dublurile care sunt sub controlul meu.
{172728}{172783}Ei bine, asta explica o multime de lucruri.
{172785}{172848}Your rain-cooled Taittinger, sir.
{172850}{172899}Bautura!
{172938}{172989}Si pentru tine.
{172992}{173120}Gandeste-te. O lume fara ____A world free of|poverty and pestilence and war.
{173122}{173179}O lume in care toti oamenii sunt egali.
{173181}{173261}In care un om, nu conteaza cat de scund,|poate inscrie _____can score with a top broad.
{173264}{173366}in care un om fara a tine cont de rasa,|credinta, culoare, beneficiaza de lucrari stomatologice gratuite
{173368}{173462}and a chance of subscription-buying|all the good things in life.
{173464}{173515}Dar, Noah, tu esti de acord cu toate astea?
{173518}{173577}Nu, nu. Eu nu sunt de acord.
{173579}{173638}Iubesc politica!
{173682}{173768}- Pentru viitor.|- Beau pentru asta.
{173843}{173888}Sampania mea speciala.
{173891}{173993}- With your very special pill in it.|- Despre ce vorbesti?
{173995}{174085}Arata ca o aspirinalooks like an aspirin, it tastes|like an aspirin, but it isn't an aspirin.
{174087}{174175}- And you just swallowed it.|- You're lying.
{174230}{174361}398 more of those little pills to go off.|Have a real bomb of an evening!
{174373}{174445}Alka Seltzer!
{174485}{174534}Right?
{174998}{175051}Charge!
{175119}{175168}Delightful vintage, sir.
{175171}{175234}- 297.|- Smooth to the palate.
{175249}{175337}Here. There's a fish|in my mixture. You fool!
{175396}{175468}I say! Super place for a coming-out party.
{175471}{175524}Now now, Mata.
{175534}{175589}- Through here!|- Down!
{175887}{175957}Look! Quick, before the fuse burns out.
{176079}{176140}Try not to look conspicuous.
{176190}{176259}- Dumnezeule! Este unul de-al nostru.|- Domnule!
{176261}{176353}- Trebuie sa iesim inainte sa explodeze!|- Trebuie sa gasim biroul.
{176356}{176432}- Ce birou? | - Cel in care am coborat, bineinteles.
{176496}{176545}Asta lasami-o mie.
{176589}{176665}Unde e biroul? Biroul.
{176679}{176742}Haide! Repede.

{177036}{177097}Urmati-ma!
{177201}{177242}Charge!
{177354}{177450}Mata, pune degetul|in urechea tigrului. O sa actioneze usile.
{177518}{177590}- Bine.|- Care e strategia, domnule?
{177592}{177663}Plecati din locul asta nenorocit|inainte sa explodeze.
{177753}{177853}- Toata lumea sa stea in spatele meu.|- Nu mai risc sa trec prin casinoul acela din nou.
{177855}{177945}- Mai bine cobor pe conducta de scurgere.|- Frumos, dar fara sustinere.
{178017}{178091}Scoate fetele prin iesirea din spate.|Imi pare rau ca te-am bagat in asta.
{178093}{178173}Pe naiba, tata.|Nu puteam sa ma distrez mai tare.
{178175}{178234}Pe acolo.
{178268}{178331}Evacueaza cladirea.|Este gata sa explodeze.
{178333}{178396}As dori Londra. Whitehall 007.
{178448}{178501}Pacat ca n-o sa o mai prinzi, Sir James.
{178504}{178576}Am intampinat o gramada de necazuri|sa te aduc aici.
{178578}{178641}Draga Vesper.|Ce nu faci tu pentru bani.
{178651}{178704}De data asta e din dragoste, Sir James.
