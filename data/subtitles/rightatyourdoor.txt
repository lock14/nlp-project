5
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,710
<i>From L.A.'s KDHP,</i>

<i>Los Angeles traffic is next.</i>

14
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,830
<i>We have a considerable</i>

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,910
<i>We have a Sig Alert on the southbound 101</i>

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,190

17
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,070

Baby, coffee.

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,550
Thank you, sir.

25
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,630
No.

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,710
A little make up for last night?

27
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,070
No.

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,030
Oh, I gotta get up and get ready.

29
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,910
Here's your latte.

30
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,190
Thank you.

31
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,750
Right there?

32
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,710
I put the sugar in the thing.

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,190
Thanks, babe.

34
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,910
Do you want me to run the shower?

35
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,070
Hey, you got that--
whatever it's called tonight?

36
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,150
Yeah. Sorry.
Last one.

37
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,430
- Paper down.
- Hmm, they found us.

38
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,990
Yeah, took them two weeks.

39
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,030
Oh, man, I forgot to charge my phone.

40
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,550
I don't think I can go to work.

41
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,150
Well, don't go.

42
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,790
Quit it.
Come on.

43
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,350
I have to.

44
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,750
Where's my car charger?

45
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,870
Hey, baby, it's 8:19.

46
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,550
Earlier they said that
the 101 is all fucked up.

47
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,670
- So you might want to take side streets.
- Oh, thanks, babe.

48
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,270
You guys rehearsing today?

49
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,150
Uh, no, but I got some calls to make.

50
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,870
- The cable guy's coming, right?
- Yeah, he's supposed to.

51
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,590
Do you mind getting my dry cleaning?

52
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,710
Yes, dear.

53
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,150
I love you.

54
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,390
Thanks for cooking last night.

55
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,670
Pretty good, right?

56
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,110
Yeah.

57
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,470
Oh, I'll finish unpacking
the bedroom boxes tonight. I promise.

58
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,950
- So, yeah, like, that's--
- It was so so--

59
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,190
- That's it, yeah?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,950
- It was good.
- Yeah?

61
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,070
Yeah, that's it.

62
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,790

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,990
<i>Beverly Hills is engulfed</i>
<i>in smoke and flames.</i>

345
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,150
<i>I stand here with hundreds of people,</i>

346
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,630
<i>and I swear we can feel</i>
<i>the heat from four or five blocks away.</i>

347
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,310
<i>Lucky enough to have saved</i>
<i>a dust mask which was handed to me</i>

348
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,230
<i>by a helpful security guard from the hotel--</i>

349
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,910
<i>We had the wherewithal to grab a first aid kit</i>
<i>before we were evacuated.</i>

350
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,150
<i>I've been given numerous</i>
<i>answers to the question,</i>

351
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,830
<i>"How toxic is the gas?"</i>

352
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,150
<i>"Is there--</i>

353
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,590
<i>It seems all structures</i>
<i>have been evacuated,</i>

354
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,030
<i>but there is nowhere to go.</i>

355
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,990
<i>No information on who is responsible</i>
<i>for these coordinated attacks</i>

356
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,830
<i>on the innocent people of Los Angeles</i>
<i>is available from authorities.</i>

357
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,270
<i>Officials do not yet fully understand</i>
<i>the lethal properties of the toxin,</i>

358
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,710
<i>but continue to caution</i>
<i>that it is acutely fatal.</i>

359
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,390
<i>I am in the middle</i>
<i>of a full-on riot down here.</i>

360
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,510
<i>Toxic ash rains from the sky.</i>

361
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,430
<i>People are fighting</i>
<i>to exit the quarantine area.</i>

362
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,950
<i>Police struggle to contain the crowd.</i>

363
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,870
<i>Police on horses are kicking their way</i>

364
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,310
<i>into the massive crowds, injuring dozens.</i>

365
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,390
<i>A police car was overturned</i>
<i>just a few moments ago.</i>

366
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,270
<i>The fires have spread.</i>

367
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,950
<i>People are getting</i>
<i>knocked to the ground.</i>

368
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,590
<i>Many have been trampled.</i>

369
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,550
<i>Authorities continuing</i>
<i>seeing crowds tonight</i>

370
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,510
<i>have been given numerous</i>
<i>answers to medical questions--</i>

371
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,110
<i>How toxic is the ash?</i>

372
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,110
<i>Is there medicine?</i>

373
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,270
<i>Mostly semi-positive answers...</i>

374
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,950
<i>From what I can see,</i>

375
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,110
<i>I can confirm that the city is under siege,</i>

376
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,830
<i>and this area is being quarantined</i>
<i>as an enormous crime scene,</i>

377
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,390
<i>as well as the potentially</i>
<i>toxic crowd of individuals</i>

378
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,270
<i>that are a threat</i>
<i>to the rest of the city.</i>

379
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,390
<i>The levels of tension</i>
<i>in the crowd is immense.</i>

380
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,470
<i>Everyone is concerned about</i>
<i>the toxic levels of the ash.</i>

381
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,470
<i>An immense crowd has been corralled</i>
<i>here on Beverly Drive.</i>

382
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,230
<i>... organizing a way</i>
<i>to move this crowd</i>

383
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,870
<i>safely away from</i>
<i>the immediate dangers.</i>

384
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,590
<i>The fires still burn.</i>

385
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,990
<i>Ash still rises into the sky.</i>

386
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,790
<i>Hundreds of people who tried to run</i>
<i>from their gridlocked vehicles,</i>

387
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,190
<i>now seek to re-enter their car,</i>

388
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,950
<i>only to find someone else inside.</i>

389
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,070
<i>Juan, I'm sorry to interrupt you.</i>

390
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>I understand we have</i>
<i>Heather Malone, a city official,</i>

391
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,070
<i>now speaking from</i>
<i>a Burbank Sheriff's office in the valley.</i>

392
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,390
<i>Please stay safe, Juan.</i>

393
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,710
<i>We'll check back with you</i>
<i>as soon as we can.</i>

394
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,710
She's safe.

395
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,950
She'll be okay.

396
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,190
We're all going to be okay.

397
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,270
Everything-- We're safe.

398
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,870
Seal it.

399
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,790
<i>Fire Departments are busily trying</i>
<i>to extinguish the fires.</i>

400
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,350
<i>We have determined that</i>
<i>the explosive devices used</i>

401
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,470
<i>have let off immense amounts</i>
<i>of deadly molecular toxins</i>

402
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,670
<i>that are now traveling</i>
<i>in the smoke from the fires.</i>

403
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,230
<i>Due to gridlocked streets,</i>

404
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,350
<i>the fires had a larger head start...</i>

405
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,510
<i>... full understanding of what kind of toxins--</i>
<i>their life span,</i>

406
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,110
<i>the full effects are still being determined.</i>

407
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,310
<i>We have a team of specialists</i>
<i>gathering samples...</i>

408
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,630
<i>... and a team of scientists</i>

409
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,390
<i>arriving on the scene to run tests.</i>

410
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,150
<i>Mobile labs are being</i>
<i>set up across the city.</i>

411
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,630
<i>Antibiotics will be distributed to those</i>
<i>now quarantined in the red zones.</i>

412
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,470
<i>So please, do not attempt</i>
<i>to join someone</i>

413
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>who has been quarantined.</i>

414
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,710
<i>If by chance, someone who</i>
<i>was near one of the blasts</i>

415
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,550
<i>approaches your home,</i>

416
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,270
<i>refrain from contact.</i>

417
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,830
<i>All air traffic in southwestern United States</i>
<i>has been grounded.</i>

418
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,590
<i>California, Nevada,</i>
<i>Arizona, Utah,</i>

419
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,510
<i>and New Mexico have no flights.</i>

420
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,630
<i>... taking shelter under awnings,</i>
<i>inside cars,</i>

421
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,270
<i>but it seems</i>
<i>to be covering everything.</i>

422
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,710
<i>It is harder and harder to breathe, Neil.</i>

423
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,830
<i>Everyone here has their faces</i>
<i>wrapped with shirts, towels, jackets,</i>

424
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,830
<i>whatever they can get their hands on, Neil.</i>

425
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,950
<i>There is a gentleman</i>
<i>lying on the ground here.</i>

426
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,630
<i>Civilians are actually tending to him.</i>

427
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,710
<i>He's bleeding profusely from his head.</i>

428
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,470
<i>I asked if he was hit by debris,</i>
<i>and a bystander said,</i>

429
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,830
<i>"No, he was run over</i>
<i>by all the people fleeing."</i>

430
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,030
- Hello?
- Brad! Jesus!

431
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,430
<i>We've been trying</i>
<i>to reach you all day.</i>

432
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,990
Mrs. Fontana.

433
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,270
<i>Is everything okay?</i>
- Yeah.

434
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,750
<i>- You're okay, right?</i>
- Yeah, we're fine.

435
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,470
<i>- Oh! They're okay!</i>
- Yeah, um--

436
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,990
<i>- They're okay!</i>
- Lexi took the freeway.

437
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,470
She took the freeway!

438
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,110
I guess the phone
lines are jammed, huh?

439
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,030
All day.
Can I speak with Lexi, please.

440
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,230
Can I speak with her?

441
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,190
<i>What?</i>
<i>You're okay, right?</i>

442
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,070
You know, we sealed the house.

443
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,630
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>They say that's good.</i>

444
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,750
<i>Oh, God.</i>

445
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,710
<i>We saw the whole thing on the news.</i>

446
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,710
<i>They say the chance</i>
<i>of survival for anybody</i>

447
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,630
<i>near the explosions</i>
<i>is most likely zero.</i>

448
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,910
<i>Brad, I need to speak with my daughter.</i>

449
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,230
<i>Brad?</i>

450
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,510
<i>All circuits are busy.</i>
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

451
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,070
<i>A total of three explosions in downtown,</i>

452
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,470
<i>three more blasts near</i>
<i>the Century City Plaza in Beverly Hills.</i>

453
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:36,230
<i>Yes, okay,</i>
<i>we would like to correct an earlier report.</i>

454
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,070
<i>It is now confirmed</i>
<i>that the blast at L.A.X.</i>

455
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,990
<i>was on the arrivals level,</i>
<i>not the departures,</i>

456
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,350
<i>between terminal 6--</i>

457
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,150
I should have fucking went.

458
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,790
It's suicide.

459
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,430
No one really knows
what's going on yet.

460
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,190
<i>Anyone approaching your home,</i>
<i>who has been exposed to the deadly ash,</i>

461
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,590
<i>must remain quarantined</i>
<i>until further instruction.</i>

462
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,950
<i>Please do not tend to the medical needs</i>
<i>of anyone contaminated.</i>

463
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,150
<i>Refrain from contact.</i>

464
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,310
<i>They are highly toxic,</i>
<i>considered lethal,</i>

465
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,790
<i>and need professional attention.</i>

466
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,390
<i>Authorities have reported that some</i>
<i>who were within blocks of the blasts</i>

467
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,470
<i>have fled to other parts of the city.</i>

468
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,430
<i>Isolate the people who</i>
<i>were near the impact areas.</i>

469
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,150
<i>The civilians, police,</i>
<i>and other rescue authorities</i>

470
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,390
<i>that were unfortunately</i>
<i>near one of the blasts,</i>

00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,390
<i>are being held at a high-security quarantine</i>

472
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,590
<i>in downtown Los Angeles.</i>

473
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,910
Brad!

474
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,190
Brad!

475
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,590
- Lex!
- Thank God you're home.

476
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,110
Oh, God.

477
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,910
You're home.

478
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,630
Honey, open up!

479
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,750
Open the door, honey.

480
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,910
Honey.

481
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,270
Oh, Jesus Christ.

482
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,350
The bombs were half
a block from my car.

483
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,670
The cop threw me up against
a wall with his club.

484
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,630
It hurts to breathe.

485
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,790
Someone picked me up off the ground,
and the sirens were so loud.

486
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,950
The entire block was on fire.

487
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,110
Open the door, sweetie.

488
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,950
Open the fucking door.

489
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,710
Open the door.
What are you doing?

490
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,630
Listen, baby,
we're gonna get you checked out.

491
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,150
We're gonna get you
to a hospital as soon as we can.

492
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,550
- Open the door.
- Baby...

493
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,710
they were dirty bombs.

494
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,630
It's chemical shit.

495
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,870
Open the door.

496
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,390
- You're contaminated.
- I can't.

497
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,390
The news said that you
have to be isolated.

498
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,390
What are you talking about?

499
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,790
The shit's airborne.

500
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,590
- Nobody knows what's going on.
- Wait--

501
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,150
Everybody on the radio said
guys were wearing toxic suits.

502
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,750
What are you doing, Brad?
What are you doing?

503
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,670
I didn't know what to do.
They said tape up the house.

504
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,150
It's some kind of poison.

505
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,350
I saw these cops.

506
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,590
And you're just going to leave me out in it?

507
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,510
Look, it's not going
to be for long, okay?

508
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,910
Brad! Go around back.

509
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,390
Get away from the front of the house.

510
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,750
- I didn't know if you were okay.
- Well, here I am!

511
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,710
- You gotta get to the back of the house.
- Oh, my God.

512
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,270
Go around back and we'll figure this out.

513
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,750
Brad, open the door.

514
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,150
I can't.

515
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,270
Baby...

516
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,710
Baby, listen to me.

517
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,550
What the fuck is this?

518
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,910
The news said that people
need to be isolated.

519
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,350
People?
It's me!

520
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,710
What, did you plan this?

521
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,430
They said to seal
the house

522
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,670
and you weren't here in time, so--

523
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,070
Who the fuck is "they"?
Fox fucking news!

524
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,390
What the fuck do they know!

525
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,710
You're pretty quick to lock
me out of my own home!

526
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,670
Baby, the, uh--

527
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,870
the--

528
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,790
the neighbor's handyman is inside.

529
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,390
What?

530
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,350
What!

531
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,550
Well, he didn't have any--

532
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,470
And not me!

533
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,510
Fuck-- You idiot!

534
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,150
Look, I know it's fucked up.

535
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,710
I couldn't just--
He had no where to go.

536
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,630
- I just couldn't--
- Yeah, well, join the fucking club!

537
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,990
We saw the ash
and the dust cloud

538
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,750
roll across the sky
and we didn't have a choice.

539
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,950
I was there, Brad!

540
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,430
Half of somebody's fucking arm
flew in my goddamn car!

541
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,510
You know, everybody's a little--

542
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,430
Once we get some information,
it'll be better in a while.

543
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,430
You know, they'll have answers.

544
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,790
It's just hysteria right now.

545
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,150
l-- I love you.
We just--

546
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,110
We gotta calm down for a second.

547
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,470
Okay, just calm down for a second.

548
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,990
I'm sorry.

549
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,990
Take this.

550
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,470
<i>Have not released an official report</i>

How long?

558
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,950
They, uh--
[sighs]

559
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,110
They don't really know anything.

560
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,990
I'm gonna be here with you, okay?

561
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,230
I'll stay right here with you, all right?

562
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,510
We'll get some help.

563
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,990

It is stupid.

- He said it was the only way to--
- What?

573
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,270
Honey, I left the door,
the front door open.

574
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,950
I left it open as long as we could.

575
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,870
l-- I just thought--
I was hoping that you were safe somewhere.

576
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,710
Are they sugar coating it?

577
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,950
No.

578
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,510
They don't fucking know
enough to sugar coat anything.

579
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,990
They-- I mean--

580
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,670
We're going to be
fucking smart about this.

581
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,030
When we figure it out,
we're going to get help.

582
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,470

585

What were you going
to do today, anyway?

586
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,990
So how's the phone work?

587
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,030
It's, uh--
It's in and out.

588
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,310
There's no Internet either.

589
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,590
Why? Do you want me
to try to call somebody?

590
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,070
No.

591
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,630
When you listen to your voicemail--

592
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,910
- Yeah?
- Ignore my messages.

Stop, stop.

00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,310
- What?
- Yeah, when I went to get you.

684
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,190
You went to get me?

685
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,870
Of course I went to get you.

686
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,310
Where are the doctors?
That guy said they'd be here by the morning.

687
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,270
- He lied.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

688
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,030
I think it was his way
to calm us down.

689
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,710
Tell him to come out here
and die alongside me.

690
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,510
How about that for an idea?

691
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,750
Fuck!

692
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,750
Look, nobody's gonna die, okay?

693
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,630
Not now, not later.
Look at me. Nobody. Okay?

694
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,750
Fuck him.

695
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,350
Can I have my phone?

696
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,870
Yeah. Sure.
Just don't--

697
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,070
Don't go anywhere anymore.

698
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,950
Give me a minute.

699
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,150
Okay, Lex.

700
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,670
Lex! You can open the door.

701
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,830
- You sure?
- Yeah.

702
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,870
Oh!

703
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,670
I talked to the Hotline.

704
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,350
What'd they say?

705
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,950
That they're doing everything
they possibly can at this time.

706
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,670
What'd they really say?
Did they say I'm dead?

707
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,110
Can't we just talk?

708
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,350
Six years, you've never
said, "Can we just talk?"

709
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,510
What'd they say?

710
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:26,110
Am I dead?
Just say it!

711
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,430
- Lexi.
- Brad!

712
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,510
Nobody is sure, 100%, of anything right now.

713
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,870
Can't anyone help me?

714
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,350
They said that the toxins
have to be like 1.5 microns--

715
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,470
- What?
- Diameter, or something like that.

716
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,550
- What?
- They're distributing antibiotics.

717
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,550
When?

718
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,510
They're using the help
of the U.S. postal service.

719
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,310
'Cause all the hospitals and
rescue centers are overwhelmed.

720
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,390
They're turning people away,
so we're going to have to, um--

721
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:59,710
- No!
- Whatever they have, it could help.

722
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,670
Brad!

723
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,430
No...

724
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,229

<i>10,000 reservists--</i>

733
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,670
- Mom.
<i>- Lexi! Finally!</i>

734
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,270
Hey.

735
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:53,110
<i>Brad told you we got</i>
<i>disconnected yesterday, right?</i>

736
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,150
- Yeah.
<i>- Oh, I'm so happy to hear your voice!</i>

737
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,590
<i>You're doing okay.</i>
<i>You're safe.</i>

738
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,390
- A little confused.
<i>- Well, me too.</i>

739
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:00,790
<i>It's terrible.</i>

740
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,230
<i>Everybody thinks it's gonna</i>

741
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,230
<i>But you're doing okay.</i>

742
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,270
<i>You and Brad have enough supplies?</i>

743
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:09,750
<i>Lex? You're--</i>
<i>You're okay, right?</i>

744
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,830
- No.
<i>- What?</i>

745
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,430
<i>- Brad said--</i>
- Doesn't matter what Brad said, Mom.

746
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,190
- I was there.
<i>- Oh, God. What are you saying?</i>

747
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,350
I just don't know what to do.

748
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,830
<i>Jesus, why did Brad lie?</i>
<i>Oh, God!</i>

749
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:22,470
<i>Okay. Okay, Lex.</i>
<i>I need you to listen to me.</i>

750
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,150
<i>There are places that</i>
<i>you can go for help--</i>

751
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,150
There's nowhere to go.

752
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,070
They're arresting people
for crossing the street.

753
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,550
Okay? Your news is not
what's really happening.

754
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,030
<i>- Calm down.</i>
- Stop telling me to calm down, Mom.

755
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,590
It's so easy to say.

756
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,710
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

757
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,550
<i>What can I do to help you, huh?</i>

758
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,150
<i>How can I help you, sweetie?</i>
- You can't.

759
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,670
<i>All right, Lex.</i>
<i>Hang up with me, and call for help.</i>

760
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,790
<i>Call for help!</i>

761
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,190
- Mommy?
<i>- Call the hospital.</i>

762
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,390
Mommy, the entire city is a crime scene.

763
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,350
- Everything is overloaded.
<i>- Get to the hospital, Lexi!</i>

764
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,470
<i>Get to the hospital.</i>
<i>They're setting up health stations.</i>

765
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,110
No, Mom, they said to stay put, okay?

766
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,950
<i>I see it here.</i>
<i>It's right here in the news--</i>

767
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:00,030
They said they'd bring us antibiotics
to calm us down.

768
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:00,949
<i>- Lexi, you cannot just sit there!</i>
- God, Mom.

769
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,110
<i>- Lexi, you cannot just sit there!</i>
- God, Mom.

770
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,670
Look! You're stressing me out, okay?

771
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,030
I don't want this either!

772
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,350
You always think you know
how to make everything right,

773
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,830
but this is fucking real, and you can't
just make it magically disappear.

774
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:13,670
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

775
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,390
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>Let's take it-- Are you all right?</i>

776
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,310
<i>Listen to you!</i>

777
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,670
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>Listen to you, Lex.</i>

778
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,750

- Hey!

781
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,070
<i>Lex, talk to me.</i>

00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,470
<i>Lex!</i>

783
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,670
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- I love you. I got to go.

784
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,710
<i>- Don't hang up, honey.</i>
- No, I love you, and--

785
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:34,870
<i>Tell me you're gonna be okay.</i>

786
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,270
Tell Dad and Jason
I love 'em too, okay?

787
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,510
<i>- Stay on the phone. Honey--</i>
- Gotta go.

788
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,910

Hey, come here.
Come here, come here.

00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,910
Where are you going?
What's going on?

791
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,230
- Where are your parents?
- They're at work.

792
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,870
- What's your name?
- Timmy.

793
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,790

Come and have some water.

811

812
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,510

- Because. The bomb.

00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,470
I'm gonna leave.

852
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,910
Look, I didn't mean what I said, okay?

853
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,190
That's not it.

854
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,590
I need to be with my wife.

855
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,150
Nobody answered the phone?

856
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,550
I reached my cousin.
He hasn't heard from her.

857
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,950
Well, uh, try somebody else.

858
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,350
I'm sorry I put you through all the trouble.

859
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,510
It's no trouble.

860
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,030
Why don't you try a neighbor?

861
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,590
She could be safe, you know,
next door or something.

862
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,590
Okay.

863
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,230
You take care of Lexi.

864
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,470
Make sure that she knows
she's not alone.

865
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,590
God help us.

866
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,190
Hey.

867
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,670
You don't have to leave.

868
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,990
Don't do this, man.

869
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,870
I'm going through the office.

870
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,110
You seal the door to the hallway.

871
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,310
I should have never came.

872
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,110
I would have never gotten
the house sealed up in time.

873
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,230
<i>Rescue teams, of course, remain ready,</i>

874
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,030
<i>in protective suits and red alert.</i>

875
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:34,710
<i>So I urge everyone to call</i>
<i>the 24-hour emergency hotline.</i>

876
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,910
<i>State your location, and the condition of you</i>
<i>and all your family members,</i>

877
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,510
<i>and they are prioritizing houses,</i>

878
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,630
<i>and will bring the proper medicine to you.</i>

879
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:51,510
<i>Do not attempt to go to a hospital</i>
<i>or a rescue center,</i>

880
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:54,870
<i>especially near the quarantined areas,</i>
<i>near the impact zones.</i>

881
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:59,990
<i>You will be turned away.</i>
<i>You will not receive medicine.</i>

882
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,710
<i>Authorities are trying to contain</i>
<i>the already overwhelming crowds.</i>

883
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,230
<i>National Guard reservists</i>
<i>continue to be briefed</i>

884
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:10,430
<i>at Edwards Air Force Base,</i>
<i>and then bused into the city</i>

885
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:13,510
<i>where they are to help with the--</i>

886
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:28,190
<i>No new news has surfaced</i>
<i>in the last several hours.</i>

887
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,350
It's a goddamn sauna
in here.

888
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,830
Do you have water?

889
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,430
I think.

890
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:38,230
Alvaro left.
Just walked out.

891
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,550
You think the shower's safe?

892
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,830
You know what, honey?
I think it'll be just fine.

893
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,950
Yeah.

894
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:57,150
The very special and important
people in charge of this disaster

895
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,390
said that it was okay.

896
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:02,390
In fact, they phoned today,
and they said,

897
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,350
"Sorry to interrupt

898
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:08,150
"your busy fucking day,
but in case you were wondering

899
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,710
"if your wife can take a nice, hot shower,

900
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,470
"she can, 'cause the water is safe.

901
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:16,750
There's not toxins in it."

902
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,550
Brad? Timmy.

903
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:23,550
And they also speculate
that boys like Timmy--

904
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,110
in general--

905
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,430
'course, you have to leave
it up to interpretation

906
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,950
what "general" means,

907
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:36,070
that boys like Timmy
are immune, too,

908
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:39,790
because they have
built-in antibiotics.

909
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,430
Can you believe that?
I mean--

910
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:43,950
They forgot to mention that.

911
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,030
Oh, shit.

912
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,310
Because I haven't seen
my family in ten years,

913
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:54,750
and I fit the classic profile
of the out-of-work musician

914
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:58,710
living off the bread-winning
coat tails of my wife,

915
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:02,350
that I'm immune too.

916
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:07,710
Since all the hospitals
are overloaded,

917
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,230
and we're told to
stay put at the time--

918
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:17,230
I think everybody's immune
to this mystery poison.

919
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:27,230
I think it's just
one big goddamn

920
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,750
public service announcement.

921
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,950
All right, I'm done.

922
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,630
You okay?

923
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,590
Yeah.

924
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,790
Oh, God.

925
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,550
I hope the mailman's
carrying some good drugs.

926
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,710
Were your parents supposed
to pick you up?

927
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,550
Yeah, they s'posed
to pick me up at school.

928
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:41,830
Don't worry.
We'll find 'em. Okay?

929
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,430
Brad?

930
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:50,630
Brad?

931
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,150
Yeah?
Did you hear that?

932
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,270
No. What is it?

933
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,830
Sounded like someone
at the back gate.

934
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,190
Shit. I'll get a flashlight.

935
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:05,030
Brad, what do you see?

936
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,630
Hang on a second.

937
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,910
Do you see anything?

938
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,190
Are you sure
you heard something?

939
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,990
Lex! Get out of the bedroom!

940
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,750
Get away from the back of the house!

941
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,830
There's someone in the back yard!
Run!

942
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,150
Lock the doors!
Lock the doors!

943
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,310
You see anyone in back?

944
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,950
I can't see!
He went around the side.

945
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,870
- Let me see.
- Stay in the bathroom.

946
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,390
- Lexi, what do you see?
- I can't see--

947
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,310
Lex! Get back in the bathroom!

948
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:29,910
Get away from the door, Lexi!

949
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,590
He's on that side
of the house!

950
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:34,310
Brad? I can't see him!

951
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,310
Help!

952
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,270
Timmy, what is it?

953
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,870
Oh, God.
Timmy?

954
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:38,990
What, what, what?
What is it?

955
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,150
I saw something in the window.

956
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:41,750
Lexi!

957
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,990
What is that?

958
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:44,790
Someone's out there!

959
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:47,150
Lock the door and stay in the bathroom.

960
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,510
- Brad, what is it? Brad!
- I can't see!

961
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,790
I'm gonna check around back.

962
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,270
- Who is it?
- Come on, it's me Rick!

963
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:53,710
Rick?

964
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,950
Lexi!

965
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,870
Oh, my God.

966
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:57,910
It's Rick!

967
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,390
- What?
- Oh, my God! Thank God.

968
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,070
Are you okay?

969
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,310
- Are you okay?
- No, I was downtown.

970
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,910
What the fuck is he doing here?

971
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,710
- I was downtown.
- Oh, fuck.

972
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,030
Oh, my God.
Thank God it's you.

973
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,870
- I'm sorry.
- I'm in trouble.

974
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,030
- Where's Brad?
- He's safe. He sealed himself in.

975
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,830
- Good. That's good.
- Yesterday, he didn't know where I was.

976
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:17,070
No, he's doing the right thing.

977
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,550
Oh, that's terrific.

978
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,350
Lexi!

979
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,470
I've been trying to get a hold of you.

980
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,550
Gail said she couldn't
get in touch with you, either.

981
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,510
Hey, Lexi, I need to talk to you.

982
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:27,790
- We gotta get help.
- Yeah, but--

983
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,390
They're setting up an airlock
at the children's hospital.

984
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:32,350
I'm going.
You can come with me.

985
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,710
No, we're supposed to stay put
if we want antibiotics.

986
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:35,510
- The news said stay--
- No! Fuck that! Fuck that!

987
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,030
- There's a Navy ship docking off of--
- Lex!

988
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,550
Oh, my God, Rick.

989
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,590
Don't go near that man.

990
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,590
There's a Navy medical ship
docking off of San Pedro.

991
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:46,670
Really?

992
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:49,870
We gotta get help.

993
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,630
Lexi!

994
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,390
Rick, here.
Here, here!

995
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:55,510
Lexi!

996
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,070
- What?
- I need to talk to you.

997
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,830
What?

998
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,310
Brad, there's a Navy ship
at San Pedro--

999
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:02,310
Don't get near that guy.

1000
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,510
He's got real information.

1001
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,590
He could be fucking worse off than you.

1002
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,830
- What?
- He sounds awful.

1003
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,670
So what, Brad?
I sound awful.

1004
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,030
You never really liked him, anyway.

1005
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,670
The guy's a scumbag.
You told me that!

1006
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,110
Are you fucking kidding me?

1007
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:15,190
He's dying. I'm dying.
Stop playing God.

1008
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:16,510
What is that supposed to mean?

1009
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,550
Fuck.

1010
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,270
All we have to do is get on the right side
of the barricades at the hospital.

1011
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:27,070
Okay? Let's go.
Come on, we gotta do something, all right?

1012
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,670
Okay, we'll go.

1013
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,430
- Okay?
- Fuck.

1014
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:34,190
<i>Symptoms continue to worsen.</i>

1015
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,550
<i>The first round of medicine--</i>

1016
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,870
You're right. I'm sorry. I just--

1017
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,950
It's just that I feel like, I guess,
that I should be taking you to the hospital.

1018
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,590
I think it's a good idea,
it's just--

1019
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:44,830
All over the news they're just saying--

1020
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,550
Fuck the news.
Baby, fuck the news.

1021
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,310
We're dying.
I gotta go.

1022
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,830
I gotta take Timmy, too.

1023
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,390
Listen, are you--

1024
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,630
Are you sure that you want to go out there?

1025
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:00,910
It's my only chance.
I have to go.

1026
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,710
I'm gonna be back, okay?

1027
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:07,190
I have no choice.

1028
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,630
I promise.

1029
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,710
<i>...clearly in over their heads.</i>

1030
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:16,030
<i>- They are understaffed...</i>
- Fuck.

1031
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,390
<i>...and you know, quite frankly,</i>
<i>they seem ill-equipped.</i>

1032
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:23,350
<i>As soon as they receive any</i>
<i>new information from the labs,</i>

1033
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:27,750
<i>they disseminate it through</i>
<i>the crowd on slips of paper.</i>

1034
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:31,350
<i>Information about the toxin</i>
<i>is still being analyzed</i>

1035
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:32,910
<i>in remote labs.</i>

1036
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:36,470
<i>No official understanding</i>
<i>of its dangers is available.</i>

1037
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:41,030
<i>It's understood to be a viral hybrid</i>

1038
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,630
<i>which attacks the respiratory system first.</i>

1039
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,190
<i>Symptoms have rapidly increased</i>

1040
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:50,670
<i>as precious time continues to slide by.</i>

1041
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:09,710
Sir, I'm Corporal Marshall from

1042
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,070
the Special Emergency
Medical Epidemiology Nexus.

1043
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,950
Jesus Christ.

1044
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,990
I need you to remain inside your house
and answer the following questions.

1045
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,870
Were you anywhere
near the accident?

1046
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,150
No.

1047
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,670
My wife was.

1048
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,030
Are you the one that called the hotline?

1049
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,270
Yeah.

1050
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,550
My wife's been locked
outside for two days

1051
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:38,670
because that's what
you said to-- said to do.

1052
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,710
Do you have any children?

1053
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:41,310
- What?
- Do you have any children?

1054
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,230
- No.
- Do you have any pets?

1055
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:44,750
- No.
- Do you have a gun?

1056
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,430
No. Wha--

1057
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:48,230
What? What is this?

1058
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:51,070
How well is your house sealed?

1059
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,830
It's very sealed.

1060
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:54,990
Keep your house sealed
and remain inside.

1061
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,630
Is your wife around back?

1062
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,710
No.

1063
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:02,430
She, uh...
She walked to--

1064
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,670
She walked to the hospital.

1065
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,350
Sir, we need everyone to stay home

1066
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,270
until we do a pre-screening process.

1067
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,270
Have you or your wife started coughing?

1068
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,510
Yeah, I mean--

1069
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:14,190
- You?
- Not me.

1070
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:16,990
I need you to stay
inside your house if you want to live.

1071
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,470
And if your wife returns,
you instruct her to stay put.

1072
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:22,270
Do you guys have any medicine?

1073
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,230
We're surveying each household
and gathering data

1074
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,390
and trying to decide what to do.

1075
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:28,470
We cannot leave medicine behind.

1076
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:30,270
We cannot waste any medicine on a maybe.

1077
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:31,830
My wife's not a "maybe."

1078
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,190
We don't know the full limits
or lethality of the toxic ash yet.

1079
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:37,030
Has she been inside?

1080
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,590
Well, I mean...

1081
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:44,990
I mean...

1082
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:47,030
You know, not really.

1083
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:49,510
She has?

1084
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,990
She hasn't been inside,
but she broke a window.

1085
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:53,870
- Did you touch her?
- No, I didn't touch her.

1086
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,350
She-- She just--

1087
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:58,590
Used her cell phone
and broke a window, and--

1088
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:01,110
Did the toxin get inside?

1089
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,390
I don't think so.

1090
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:05,150
I mean, there might have--
been a little something on it.

1091
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,750
I threw a rug over it.

1092
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,790
- Did you reseal the window?
- Yeah.

1093
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:09,790
Right away.

1094
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:12,430
How long ago did she break it?

1095
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,030
Um, like, uh--

1096
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:19,550
Like, a day, day and a half.

1097
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,430
You have an air-conditioning system?

1098
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:23,030
No, it's 100 fucking degrees in here.

1099
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:24,830
I'll need you to gather a sample for me.

1100
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,030
There's ash all over the street.

1101
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,470
We've gathered that already.

1102
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,990
I need a sample of the ash
that your wife was in contact with.

1103
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,910
I'm not opening the door.

1104
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,990
Which window did she break?

1105
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:44,830
She, uh--
She broke a window in the back.

1106
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:59,550
It's right here, sir.

1107
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:10,270
Put some in a bag, and put it
through the broken window pane.

1108
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,390
And I want you to put
some plastic on the inside

1109
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,110
and seal it up,
make it air-tight.

1110
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,550
I'm not touching that stuff.

1111
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,670
Put some in a bag.

1112
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,270
What about my wife?

1113
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:21,110
I can't answer that question
at this time, sir.

1114
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,230
It won't kill you,
and after we're downtown,

1115
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,470
we'll have it analyzed.

1116
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,110
All right.
Fuck.

1117
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,630
Here, I'll put this
through the center for--

1118
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,430
We'll check in later.

1119
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:36,310
Keep inside your house
and keep it sealed.

1120
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:37,870
It's your only chance of survival.

1121
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,470
Yeah, what kind of chance?

1122
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,830
Stay put.

1123
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:42,550
And instruct your wife to do the same.

1124
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,350
If she returns, refrain from contact.

1125
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,590
Why can't you guys just
tell me what's going on?

1126
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,550
I mean, what's the big fucking secret?

1127
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,990
We're not trying to cause
any more panic than there already is.

1128
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:53,150
Yeah.

1129
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,470
1621 Russell Avenue.
Red tag.

1130
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:05,310
What the fuck does that mean, red tag?

1131
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:06,670
What does that mean?

1132
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,230
Where are you guys fucking going?

1133
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:11,830
Son of a bitch.

1134
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,350
Hey!

1135
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,550
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1136
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,710
I answered all your fucking questions.

1137
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:34,230
If you're not gonna fucking do anything,
get out of my house!

1138
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:38,230
Listen, if you don't have
any fucking medicine,

1139
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:40,270
then get the fuck out of my house, okay?

1140
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:48,030
What he fuck are you guys doing?
Get out of my house.

1141
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,710
What are you looking for?

1142
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:56,430
If you're not gonna help me,
get the fuck out of my house!

1143
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,710
<i>...is researching its properties.</i>

1144
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:30,790
<i>Increased dosages do not</i>
<i>seem to help, either.</i>

1145
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:34,070
<i>The extensive search</i>
<i>for those who fled downtown</i>

1146
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,630

<i>and in L.A.X. has heightened.</i>

1147
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:42,070
<i>The president has activated another</i>
<i>5,000 more reserves in Southern California.</i>

1148
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:42,629
<i>Please stay inside your homes.</i>

1149
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:44,710
<i>Please stay inside your homes.</i>

1150
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:47,870
<i>The 24-hour curfew for</i>

<i>Please stay inside...</i>

1153
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,830
Brad?

1154
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,430
Brad!

1155
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,790
Jesus-fucking Christ.

1156
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,830
Lex, did you get help?

1157
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,270
- No, I couldn't get in.
- What?

1158
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:10,750
They took Timmy.
They ran through the crowd,

1159
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,350
and they took all the children.

1160
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:14,030
- They were giving them medicine.
- Well, that's good.

1161
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,710
The cops got Rick.

1162
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:18,230
They shoved five guys in a van--
Took off.

1163
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:20,150
- I just started running.
- You gotta get away from the street.

1164
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,670
Those medical people came by today.

1165
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,350
They're not doctors.
They're fucking soldiers.

1166
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,550
Lex!

1167
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,590
Lexi, please go around back!

1168
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:31,670
Lex, get around to the back of the house!

1169
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:33,870
- What is this?
- Who cares what it is!

1170
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,310
- What does it mean?
- Who cares what it fucking means!

1171
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,550
- You gotta go around back!
- It's gotta be bad.

1172
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:40,350
Lexi, please!

1173
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,910
- Would you please go around back?
- Okay.

1174
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,030
<i>Do not leave your homes.</i>

1175
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,350
What the fuck is this?

1176
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:52,950
Fuck!

1177
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:54,230
Lexi!

1178
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,510
There's fucking thousands of people
at the hospital.

1179
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,710
They're pushing
and they're screaming,

1180
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,150
and and they're climbing over each other.

1181
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:00,310
There's people jumping
from a parking garage

1182
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:02,270
across an alley way into a window.

1183
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,350
And cop cars are blocking the doors.

1184
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,390
I mean, what is that?

1185
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,390
Fuck!

1186
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:09,110
Motherfuckers!

1187
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,630
Oh, Brad.

1188
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,630
I mean, what is that?

1189
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,510
That's not help.

1190
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,190
No one's coming here with medicine.

1191
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:51,510
Maybe you should
go rest in the bedroom.

1192
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,950
I'm good here.

1193
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:56,750
The air feels good.

1194
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:16,150
What is it?

1195
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:17,430
I don't know.

1196
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:22,270
Baby, get in the back.
Go in the bedroom.

1197
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:11,790
Lex, where are you?

1198
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,070
It's dead birds.

1199
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:16,310
There's dead birds everywhere.

1200
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,150
Are you okay?

1201
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:22,390
I'm okay!
I'm okay, it's just me.

1202
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,550
It's just me.

1203
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,390
<i>Lexi, it's me.</i>

1204
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:34,670
<i>Listen, I'm gonna head downtown,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna come and get you.</i>

1205
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,590
<i>Just call me and tell me that you're okay.</i>

1206
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:37,750
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

1207
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,070
<i>Lexi, it's Mom.</i>

1208
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,750
<i>I hope you're getting help.</i>

1209
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:44,670
<i>Dad needs to speak with--</i>

1210
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:46,270
<i>You know how he is.</i>

1211
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,910
<i>Jason is up at the house, too.</i>
<i>We're worried sick.</i>

1212
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:51,270
<i>Please call us, sweetie.</i>

1213
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:54,670
<i>We love you, okay?</i>
<i>We love you.</i>

1214
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,510
Lexi, it's me, Rich.

1215
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:00,390
<i>No one was at the office,</i>
<i>and Gail said she couldn't reach you.</i>

1216
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,910
<i>I'm headed your way.</i>

1217
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:03,750
Lex, it's Gail.

1218
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:07,350
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>That's all.</i>

1219
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,710
<i>I...</i>

1220
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:16,110
<i>I pray that you're safe.</i>

1221
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,870
<i>Lexi, it's Mom.</i>

1222
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:23,830
<i>We love you.</i>

1223
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:25,270
<i>I know that you know that.</i>

1224
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,910
<i>We're praying for you, baby.</i>

1225
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:28,630
<i>Please call us.</i>

1226
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:30,950
Lex, it's Jason.

1227
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:35,350
<i>I talked to Mom, and--</i>

1228
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:38,750
<i>if you get this--</i>

1229
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:41,990
<i>I don't know.</i>

1230
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:44,750
<i>I love you.</i>

1231
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:47,990
<i>If there's anything I can do,</i>
<i>if I can-- just call me.</i>

1232
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:49,830
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

1233
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:52,230
<i>Mom 's driving me fucking crazy.</i>

1234
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,990
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

1235
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:57,910
<i>All I know is I miss you.</i>

1236
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:00,270
<i>Call us.</i>

1237
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,470
<i>Bye.</i>

1238
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:21,390
<i>Lex! Are you okay?</i>
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

1239
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:22,870
- It's bad.
<i>- I know. Mom said--</i>

1240
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:24,670
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- It's really bad, Jas.

1241
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:26,470
<i>Fucking Christ, Lexi!</i>

1242
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:29,510
Listen, there's nothing
anyone can do, okay?

1243
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:31,950
I just...

1244
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:33,470
I just want to talk to you.

1245
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,630
<i>What? Lexi, did you get help?</i>
<i>Did you go to the hospital?</i>

1246
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,270
<i>They said on the news that there--</i>

1247
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:39,950
Jason, I tried.
There's nothing I can do!

1248
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,750
<i>Lexi--</i>

1249
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,710
Please just talk to me, okay?

1250
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:48,510
I just want to hear your voice.
Just talk, okay?

1251
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,150
Please?

1252
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:53,750
Jason?

1253
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:58,870
<i>What do you want to talk about?</i>

1254
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,750
I don't know.

1255
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:03,470
Anything.

1256
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,870
How are you?

1257
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:15,550
It's okay.

1258
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:16,750
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1259
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:19,550
It's okay if you can't.

1260
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,190
<i>I, um...</i>

1261
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:23,190
<i>I drove by the house</i>
<i>with Dad yesterday.</i>

1262
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:25,350
- You did?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1263
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:27,990
How is he?

1264
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:30,710
<i>He's... the same.</i>

1265
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:36,030
<i>The house is brown now.</i>

1266
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:38,030
- No! Really?
<i>- Yeah. Really ugly.</i>

1267
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:39,670
- Weird.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1268
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,150
<i>Lexi, are you okay?</i>

1269
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,190
<i>Lexi?</i>

1270
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:47,790
<i>Lexi, are you okay?</i>

1271
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,829
Listen...
I gonna go, okay?

1272
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:53,070
Listen...
I gonna go, okay?

1273
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,230
<i>What? Don't.</i>

1274
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:56,150
- I'm tired.
<i>- Don't.</i>

1275
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,710
- Jason--
<i>- Lexi, is there anything I can do?</i>

1276
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,230
I'm gonna go be with Brad.

1277
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:01,510
I love you, Jason.

1278
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,190
<i>No, don't hang up!</i>
<i>Don't--</i>

1279
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:36,670
<i>The president is set to hold</i>
<i>a press conference tonight</i>

1280
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:40,950
<i>where he will ask for assistance</i>
<i>from other allied nations</i>

1281
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,910
<i>for professional and scientific relief.</i>

1282
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,630
<i>In the meantime, National Guard reservists</i>

1283
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:48,910
<i>continue to be briefed at</i>
<i>Edwards Air Force Base</i>

1284
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,830
<i>and then bused into the neighborhoods.</i>

1285
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:52,670
You know...

1286
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:55,110
you did an amazing thing.

1287
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:56,790
What?

1288
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:58,350
You saved Timmy.

1289
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:02,670
Brad...

1290
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:06,070
I'm sorry for...

1291
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,910
anything...

1292
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:08,910
Ugly.

1293
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:12,230
No, I'm--
I don't know.

1294
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,910
The fights seem--

1295
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:16,870
Stupid fights seem stupider now.

1296
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:21,150
They seemed stupid the other night.

1297
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:24,830
Yeah. It's just...

1298
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,630
I was...

1299
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:32,430
working so much and keeping so busy
and thinking about the future.

1300
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,030
We were...

1301
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,110
When we were getting married,

1302
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,710
I had doubts about you and me.

1303
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:05,030
Why are you telling me this?

1304
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:08,710
I don't know.

1305
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,430
I never had any.

1306
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:21,270
What else should we talk about?

1307
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:24,310
Why don't we talk about
the children that we never had.

1308
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,390
We would have screwed them up anyway.

1309
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:40,830
You know what's gonna happen, right?

1310
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,070
We're gonna...

1311
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:48,150
end up on one
of those daytime talk shows.

1312
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:54,990
Like a... a real sappy one,
you know?

1313
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:57,310
I mean, we'll take their calls, and...

1314
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:03,910
I'll ramble on about how we managed...

1315
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:06,270
to survive and, you know,

1316
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:09,670
all about how much
I love you, and how much...

1317
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,150
You mean to me.

1318
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:20,990
You're the reason
I get out of bed every morning, and...

1319
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:25,230
how you make...

1320
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:27,750
my life complete.

1321
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:37,910
We'll just-- We'll rip their hearts out.

1322
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,790
We'll jam 'em right through
the phone lines.

1323
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:50,950
You'll tell 'em how we met?

1324
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,030
Your version or my version?

1325
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:55,190
The only version.

1326
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,950
I love you.

1327
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,350
How much?

1328
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:19,630
To Catalina and back.

1329
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,350
Oh, fuck.

1330
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:29,590
I'm sorry.

1331
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,350
No.

1332
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:35,230
It's not our fault.

1333
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:37,750
You stay with me, okay?

1334
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:40,670
I need you to stay.

1335
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:44,750
Listen, baby,
you'll be okay.

1336
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,350
It's okay.

1337
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,310
I'm okay.

1338
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:05,070
Brad!

1339
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:08,230
Brad!
Let me in! Brad!

1340
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,230
Don't you touch her!
Don't fuckin' touch her!

1341
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,350
Let go of her!

1342
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:12,990
- Get the fuck off of her!
- Brad!

1343
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:15,030
Open my fucking door!

1344
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,750
Open my fucking door!

1345
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,110
Don't you fucking touch her!

1346
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:20,350
We're here to help you!

1347
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:22,430
Get your hands off of her!

1348
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:24,590
Let go of her!
Don't you fucking touch her!

1349
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:28,150
Don't you fucking touch her!

1350
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:29,150
You motherfuckers!

1351
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:31,910
Get the man!

1352
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,990
Stay put!

1353
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:35,910
Don't fucking move!

1354
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:54,950
Your wife is safe.

1355
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:56,350
The best thing you could have done

1356
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:57,950
was to keep her sealed right outside here.

1357
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:59,190
What?

1358
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:02,070
The toxic level in your house
has reached an irreversible level.

1359
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,430
Your airtight house has incubated
the ash into an airborne hybrid.

1360
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,190
You've created a breeding ground
for the poison.

1361
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:09,590
What are you saying?

1362
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:11,790
The air in your house
is a deadly supply,

1363
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:15,030
and you're a lethal carrier.

1364
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:17,390
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
nothing we can do.

1365
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:22,710
Please don't struggle.

1366
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:27,190
Wait a minute!

1367
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:28,910
What'd you do with my wife?

1368
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:30,990
Hey!

1369
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:38,550
Jesus Christ.

1370
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:40,150
Oh, fuck!

1371
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:41,310
Hey!

1372
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,630
Hey!

1373
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:59,110
Hey, stop!

1374
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:01,190
Fuck!

1375
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:10,670
Stop!

1376
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,110
I'm still in here!

1377
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,910
Stop!

1378
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:58,390
Stop!

1379
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,590
Stop it! I'm still alive!

1380
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:08,230
I can't breathe!
Please fucking stop!

1381
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:10,230
Lexi!

1382
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:12,750
I'm still alive!

1383
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:14,950
Brad! Brad, get out!

1384
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:18,710
- Help me!
- Let go!

1385
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,790
Somebody help him!

1386
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,350
No!

1387
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,270
I'm still alive, you fucking assholes!

1388
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,670
Come on, come on, come on!

1389
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,070
Somebody help him!

1390
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:35,390
I'm still alive!

1391
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,510
No! Brad!

1392
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:41,150
Help him!

1393
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:54,990
Pump the gas for another 20 minutes.

1394
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,270
It'll suffocate the disease.

1395
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,030
There's nothing we could have
done for your husband.

1396
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:48,190
The virus has grown to an
uncontrollable proportion inside the house.

1397
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:51,390
It's lethal.
The condition is irreversible.

1398
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,310
Say a prayer.
You might just make it.

1399

<i>barreled, and shipped</i>

1400
