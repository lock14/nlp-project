1
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,298
Not you know to where you are going.

2
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:49,638
Yes I know it.

3
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:53,323
Not you know where you are.

4
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:54,290
Yes I know it.

5
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:55,252
I mean, veto the devil.

6
00:00:55,285 --> 00:01:01,075
Only enter to the car, you are not able to
to walk the whole route.

7
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,255
 Was this your election?

8
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:04,605
Not it was my election mom.

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,737
You want to live with that old dog that neither
though you understand and I not even know.

10
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:11,742
If you love me outside of your life,
I will be outside of your life.

11
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:14,307
You are impossible.

12
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:18,923
It seems that in any way we will return
to have the life that we had.

13
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,888
I am fed up with this shit.

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,995
Is what you not want?

15
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:23,531
Then I am outside of your life.

16
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:24,501
Nobody is requesting that.

17
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,779
I am outside of your life.

18
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,311
Then please...

19
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,144
veto of my life

20
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:30,389
- I leave

21
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:32,024
How good, veto.

22
00:01:35,683 --> 00:01:40,773
THE RULE DE GEORGIA

23
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,697
Hello.

24
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:57,174
who are you?

25
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,278
He/she hears I didn't make anything.

26
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:01,250
Calm down

27
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:03,839
Oh God, you belong to those perverts.

28
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:05,986
He/she looks, I didn't make anything.

29
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:09,634
Please help me

30
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,095
- Are you crazy?
-No.

31
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:15,690
I Am Rachel.

32
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:17,321
I Am Harlan Wilson.

33
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,909
I found you playing my breast.

34
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:23,376
That was not my intention.

35
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,369
Then, which was it?

36
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,553
To see if you were dead.

37
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:31,361
Problems with the car Harlan?

38
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,019
Oh, I like this.

39
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:34,985
it is new

40
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:35,684
can I manage?

41
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:36,616
 do you know it?

42
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,889
I found it sleeping to the side of the track

43
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:41,424
ok goes!

44
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,465
their name is Rachel

45
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:44,435
ok

46
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:46,063
it seems that now it is safe

47
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:48,144
now it is all yours

48
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:49,591
I work again

49
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:50,553
he/she hears

50
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:51,930
thank you for the aventón

51
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:52,892
but good

52
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,553
it has been a strange form
of picking up me

53
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,085
 how do you call yourself?

54
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:57,723
Simón

55
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:01,631
in fact I don't have destination

56
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,719
the same as me

57
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:03,689
 to where?

58
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:04,649
to any place

59
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:05,611
he/she went alone

60
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:07,107
good I believe that no longer ,
you are very lucky

61
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,579
it would consider this way me,
if you were not here

62
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,253
good we go or we will stay here

63
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:17,750
I don't like to speak

64
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:20,121
perfect, I don't like to neither listen

65
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:32,419
you could lower your feet inside
of my car?

66
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,020
oh, you change the rules

67
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,403
in fact there are not rules

68
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:38,156
only it is not good that some part of l
body of somebody estéfuera of l car

69
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,502
then I can speak to you?

70
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:40,467
it lowers your feet

71
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,573
you didn't say " Simón says... "

72
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:43,561
Simón

73
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:47,898
I am going to Hull

74
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:50,103
oh in Idaho, is there to where I go

75
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,090
what luck!

76
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:54,847
and you will call to somebody or you will arrive him/her
of surprise?

77
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:58,397
good, it is supposed that my mom would call me

78
00:04:58,438 --> 00:04:59,552
how boring!

79
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,445
don't make that

80
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:34,798
he/she had mentioned it to you

81
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:36,906
you cannot hide letters
neither to show them

82
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,020
everything and l world play this way

83
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:40,207
we can make it

84
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:42,190
then if all
they make any thing you

85
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:44,373
you accept it, only because
they say that it is correct

86
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:46,069
probably yes

87
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:47,604
me due him my leg

88
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:48,540
one hears it cannot leave

89
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:55,197
they hurt me my arthritis, I cannot remain
in this position for a lot of time

90
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:58,341
 to leave? did I say to leave?

91
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:11,189
I won!

92
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,174
oh

93
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:14,612
mom!

94
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:17,077
he/she hears, you cannot leave, to go is bad

95
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:19,260
hello

96
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,759

97
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:21,730

102
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:32,234
to her they hurt him/her the muscles and
we should understand him/her

103
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:41,266
where is Rachel?

104
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:45,588
I thought that this trip
it would be good for us,

105
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,448
and that we could speak
and at least to tolerate us

106
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:50,914
where is my nie ta?

107
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,246

111
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:08,687

164
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,059
then now you know me

165
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,174
you don't have ring of commitment

166
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:30,669
 how old are you?
 30 ? 40 ?

167
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:31,990

00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:54,156
I don't want you to play again

175
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:00,205

side of the track

185
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:38,113
as your father he/she used to say

186
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:40,704
everybody feels superior

187
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,552
you never said anything regarding it
that he thought when it was alive

188
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:47,273
and if he/she had made it what would you have made?

189
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,706
he/she had not made anything

190
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:54,539
your granddaughter goes away but you/he/she doesn't escape

191
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,689
it is easy to find it, only
be you slope

192
00:10:56,858 --> 00:11:01,782
if he/she doesn't appear in next hours,
you call me to the cellular one and I will look for it

193
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:06,079
thank you to take care of it

194
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,576
I hope he/she makes him/her well
to be with you

195
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:11,391
and to you he/she would not make you well?

196
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:08,962
you are same

197
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:10,596

198
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:12,998
where is my mom?

199
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,927
he/she left home of Allison

200
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:15,889
ok

201
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:18,827
 you told to my mom
that he/she stops to smoke, to drink and

202
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,014
to be hated to if same

203
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:25,684
Rachel

204
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,583
am I hungry you have something sweet?

205
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:38,047
you arrive late 5 hours

206
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:41,959
my mom threw away me to some 20 miles
of Idaho and I had to walk.

207
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,859
you have to wait to the breakfast

208
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:50,132
but there are some apples in the table

209
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:53,945
you can really know
what is happening?

210
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,185
so that you realize
of how they are the things

211
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:57,172
I would love it

212
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,632
my mother and stepfather make me the life difíci l

213
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:03,196
maybe because I live with and llos

214
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:05,990
anyway, you
it supposed that it should finish

215
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:07,335
my studies in January

216
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:11,370
then, he/she had that re alizar some trips
until the university begins

217
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:12,719
then they had to come undone of my

218
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:14,926
they sent me to one summer to pass in Idaho

219
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,862
and it sent me to the woman's of the house
that and lla cannot be close

220
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:20,597
hence I am here

221
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,287
he/she tries to straighten out abue the

222
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,309
veto the devil

223
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,311
 there is not kiss of good night?

224
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:42,250
ok

225
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:39,887
the only picture that he/she had seen of you
it is when you loaded me to my and this dog

226
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,142
I bought it to you, so that not
be him/her afraid to the funeral of your father

227
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,187
you put him/her Grandfather

228
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:51,061
he/she had 4, any help that gave me
he/she would not make sense

229
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:53,016
yes he/she made sense for you

230
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,364
my stepfather promised me to buy me a
car to go to the university

231
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:00,679
if it is that I can survive here

232
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:01,664
and to remain calm

233
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:05,093
oh, then your time here
it won't be a complete one I waste

234
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:07,690
good, I miss my friends

235
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:12,144
the friends happen but
the family lasts

236
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:27,811
I brought 7 novels

237
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:28,776
to read them here calmly

238
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:30,820
every week that I will be here

239
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:33,891
oh what a God this is?

240
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:38,894
I don't want you to mention to the gentleman in
any act

241
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:41,358
as ago an instant that
Oh God said

242
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,415
you spend and l sugar

243
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,183
I won't tolerate you to blaspheme

244
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,741
and next time I hope you sleep up

245
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:49,632
I wonder why
they send me to the masmorras

246
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,555
up, it is the rule of Georgia

247
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:53,979

next time

249
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:01,514
and I wondered why
my mom hated you

250
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,762
I am happy that you are here, Rachel

251
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:18,017
then, they have something here well
that Harlan Wilson

252
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,627

253
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,582

260
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:43,636

261
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,302
he/she washes your plates

262
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:48,897
 do you request it to me or do you order?

263
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:51,618

your plates

264
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,262

I believe that he/she needs a hand

272
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,723
good, I should make myself the idea that

273
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,338

he is veterinary, it is not legal
that that him ago

341
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:43,235

346
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,021

Mrs. Seymour, the music

431
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:30,064
does he/she want to spend more behind?

432
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:32,846
he/she looks at affection

433
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:36,532
good shot

434
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:40,790

436
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:42,721

441
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:59,506
George sent him/her this

442
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,342
 didn't it put him/her some poison?

443
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,818
he/she is playing Bach

444
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,703
he/she waited some music country

445
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:11,389
we are residents of a learned earth

446
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:14,048
I cannot say the same thing
of Harlan

447
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,434
in some days, he/she will leave mission
for the church

448
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:26,095

449
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,955

450
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:30,902

00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:33,306
my sister and nephew are
here

452
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,065
I only escaped a while

453
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:37,148
 in Georgia?

454
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,526
not exactly

455
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:41,789
it is supposed that one should
to maintain their family values

456
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:43,323
people make the
that in the bottom they want

457
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:46,407
sometimes not

458
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:51,785
I am not for sure
Harlan is rebellious

459
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,605
we leave he/she doesn't preach,
I don't like it

460
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:00,623
or the envenaré

461
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:04,187
anyone can make any
sew any person

462
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,228
he/she cannot leave it if it begins him

463
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:08,696
he/she only survives

464
00:29:09,282 --> 00:29:10,047
oh please

465
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:12,250
you have 17

466
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,211
you allow yourself to take for your instinct
you don't understand a little bit what is to survive

467
00:29:18,252 --> 00:29:21,607
oh, and did you invent it not?

468
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:25,837
without a doubt you are a survivor

469
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:31,088
you are noticed in everything, eyes, it forms
of walking, face

470
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,910
he/she died your wife and son, and

471
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:38,395
I feel proud that are here

472
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,464
you know, when he/she had 12 my stepfather
it forced me to have sex with me

473
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:52,045
and I loved him, he/she went delicate to
to weigh of it

474
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,354
I also survived Simón

475
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:57,557
you don't only have to feel pain

476
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,818
Rachel hears to see ribbon

477
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,596
3, 2, 1,

478
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:16,717

00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,439
what an uh? what did it happen?

482
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:38,591
their name was June

483
00:30:40,264 --> 00:30:41,673
is ah, beautiful?

484
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:46,280
June was my life

485
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,957
I never planned to see this way it but until
we end up thinking of marrying

486
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:53,749
but good

487
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:59,383
Simón said that you will go to one
mission in the Mormons

488
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:01,307
yes

489
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:03,264
I want to make it

490
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:09,282
I don't make it to intersect the hair ,
I will have to make it per years for the mission

491
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:11,592
your hair will grow

492
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:13,481
 and for how long will you go?

493
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:14,467
2 years

494
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:17,073
enough time

495
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:19,497
can they have sex in the mission?

496
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:24,250
no

497
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,139
not until we marry

498
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:30,720
then you are about telling me that
you never had before sex

499
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,531
 are you virgin not?

500
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:35,996
and you?

501
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:40,132
comic sounds

502
00:31:49,335 --> 00:31:51,059
 do you like to look?

503
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,080
it excuses

504
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:00,835
he/she looks I believe that we should return

505
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,179
put on in the part of behind

506
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:05,344
 at some time you did look?

507
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:07,012
clear in a magazine I suppose

508
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,287
leave the skin

509
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:12,237
do you want to see?

510
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:13,287
no, really not

511
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,891
what is what impedes you?

512
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:25,144
you can play it if you like

513
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:58,520
he/she plays me

514
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,375
I believe that we should stop

515
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,365
that is not exactly

516
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,120
I don't apologize for anything

517
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:34,659
ok

518
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:38,667
hello, he/she not waits
will you allow me to happen?

519
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:40,945
no

520
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:43,121
 will we work tomorrow?

521
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:44,752
why not?

522
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,101
I don't know it,

523
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:48,923
I mean, due to what I said
on your wife and son

524
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:51,610
you were right, they are dead
and it is already made

525
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:02,954
I only love you that everything
what my father made I caused it

526
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:03,939
that is everything

527
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:05,710
was it this way?

528
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:09,063
yes, he/she needed a what a topic to converse

529
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:11,019
Rachel told to your grandmother
what you told me

530
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:12,818
why?

531
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:14,832
he/she didn't have option, that is very serious

532
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:16,282
you are a silly idiot

533
00:34:16,314 --> 00:34:17,363
he/she waits

534
00:34:17,404 --> 00:34:18,518
 don't you know how to recognize the truth?

535
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:19,770
everybody knows that I lie

536
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,702
nobody believes me

537
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:21,685
I believe you

538
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:23,388
but you don't count

539
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:26,182
shit, I cannot believe that there are
fact that

540
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:27,559
you are a complete one silly

541
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:43,064
oh Rachel

542
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:47,475
I went to fish with Harlan ,
I will put this in and l refrigerator

543
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:58,113
I will ask it once

544
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:03,309
and I will know if you tell me the truth in
that instant because you are part of my

545
00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:06,697
I don't understand you completely but
yes I understand each other to me

546
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:08,214
I will know it

547
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:10,190
I am really sleepy

548
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:13,939
 Did Arnold play you?

549
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:21,241
if it was this way, he would be dead

550
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:38,550
you are grandiose

551
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,774
and you

552
00:35:42,812 --> 00:35:43,741
you are the only one

553
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,531
we give ourselves the turn

554
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:49,631
you are a charm, to be with you is brilliant

555
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:57,607
if you have something important,
he/she leaves your message and I will call you

556
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:01,897
I can hang and to call again

557
00:36:01,939 --> 00:36:03,434
damned it is

558
00:36:10,076 --> 00:36:13,340
that it is not excuse

559
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:25,668
if t ienes something important he/she leaves
your message and I will call you

560
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,087
what?

561
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:38,645
what?

562
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:53,832
what was that whole moving call?

563
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:01,906
what?

564
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,885
- Harlan good morning
-Good morning Mrs. Randol

565
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:15,169
how's it going?
 how are you?

566
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:16,515
their newspaper

567
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:17,478
thank you

568
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:18,438
 is Rachel in her room?

569
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:19,966
I believe that it is very sleeping

570
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:22,184
if it allows me to wait for it it would appreciate it

571
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:24,516
he/she hears thank you for and fished l

572
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:27,279
 does he/she believe that June is beautiful?

573
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:32,849
good, I prefer the autumn, your you know,
September, October

574
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:35,192
no, I refer to my girl
June Smith

575
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:37,783
oh

576
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:42,907
clear, yes I think that small Smith
they are nice

577
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:46,403
I don't eat Rachel

578
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:49,759
good, nobody is
as Rachel

579
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:50,567
 Harlan?

580
00:37:52,975 --> 00:37:53,902
pancakes?

581
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:54,885
no

582
00:37:56,241 --> 00:38:00,108
I avenge to tell you that I will speak with her
and I want you to come with me

583
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,047
why?

584
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:04,118
it is the only way that you realize
that I leave home with her

585
00:38:04,155 --> 00:38:05,084
what?

586
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,158
I have to be said it personally to June

587
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,307
 and me what I have to see?

588
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:11,681
I believe that it is the only form in that he/she forgives me

589
00:38:11,715 --> 00:38:16,707
oh Harlan, I only sucked you
the penis, was not even an appointment

590
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:19,014
I wait for you in the truck

591
00:38:22,095 --> 00:38:24,683
thank you for the breakfast
Sra. Randoll

592
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:25,650
you know

593
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:27,790
anything is left without being
punished

594
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:29,107
I have to change myself

595
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,719
the meditation is the road to your interior energy

596
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:39,289
and instead of losing your energy

597
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,083
your you will overcome your problems

598
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,581
he/she usually takes something of time

599
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:47,042
and every day you will go filling your energ ía

600
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:52,424
to improve your health, to increase your energy,
to reduce the stress and to overcome the sadness

601
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:55,338
then taking deep respirations
relax you!

602
00:38:55,924 --> 00:38:59,726
and it lets that the energy is recharged
and be renewed in you

603
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,602
he/she remembers, you are very blessed for
estresada to be

604
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,210
you are maybe only looking for
an excuse to not say

605
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:17,187
and I believe that it is this way

606
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:21,673
but you played me and you dressed

607
00:39:22,163 --> 00:39:23,539
and that avoids you to make something

608
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,734
Harlan is supposed that you are religious

609
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,178
it is supposed that yes

610
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,140
if you only could

611
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:31,668
I have to be sorry

612
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,304
 to be sorry of what?

613
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:34,687
if you could forgive me

614
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:36,573
Rachel everything...

615
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,810
ok, I forgive you

616
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:41,504
 something more?

617
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,945
ok then already forgave you

618
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:04,153
Lili

619
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,145
she is a liar

620
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,579
 did you manage so much to tell me that?

621
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:10,504
Rachel

622
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:12,514
it is outside with a friend

623
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:16,204
she was smoking crack
in that night

624
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:21,515
Pey and Former they were with that for the house,
 do you realize what I speak?

625
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:23,120
I know that something is passing him/her

626
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,944
and he/she lies the whole time

627
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:28,216
he/she is a destructive liar

628
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:29,880
why are Lili here?

629
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:36,221
I listened all that, and I deny it ,
that never happened

630
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:38,720
he/she is paying me to have her
brought here

631
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,169
it is as simple as that

632
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:41,131
then why you are here?

633
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:44,550
I am here to tell you the truth

634
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:45,519
why do you think that I am here then?

635
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:46,480
where should it be then?

636
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:49,932
it was supposed that he/she would go to the university
in autumn

637
00:40:49,973 --> 00:40:50,901
but who he/she knows if he/she will make it

638
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:56,308
because he/she lied in the shipment of the application

639
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:58,421
 are you hungry?

640
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:13,225
then you don't drink, you consume drugs,

641
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:16,615
do you smoke or do you have sex?

642
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:18,123
not until I marry

643
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:19,989
for good luck

644
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:21,300
I don't understand

645
00:41:21,336 --> 00:41:24,307
why you take such a strict life
and boring?

646
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:26,716
because it is the correct thing

647
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:29,369
 how can you know if something is correct?

648
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,479
I chose to believe

649
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:34,592
it is question of faith

650
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:37,834
I didn't say that I have this way faith or things

651
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:39,210
but something knows

652
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,283
yes, I understand it

653
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:50,927
1, 2, 3

654
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,697
let us be maybe guessing

655
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:11,664
great idea

656
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:15,792
you know, there is not reason to feel that I hurt
your feelings because we don't marry

657
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:18,549
no, undoubtedly not

658
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,626
oh, is she?

659
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:21,616
Harlan

660
00:42:22,108 --> 00:42:23,353
hello

661
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:25,183
surprise

662
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:30,338
of course, I only have
one minute and I should already return

663
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,865
hello

664
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:35,559
June wants you to know
to my friend, Rachel,

665
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:38,120
he/she works for the doctor
Wart, crossing the street

666
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,188
your you know the lady
Randoll, she is their granddaughter and

667
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,604
it is from California

668
00:42:43,638 --> 00:42:47,896
Rachel Wilcox, and she will study in New York

669
00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:52,027
- a lot of pleasure
-hello, I kissed Harlan

670
00:42:54,818 --> 00:42:56,958
and of this it is in fact what is

671
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:58,339
 in the mouth?

672
00:42:58,372 --> 00:43:00,349
no, he/she would not make that

673
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:01,408
I am not this way

674
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,098
and what does that mean Harlan?

675
00:43:05,485 --> 00:43:08,523
anything, is it that sini fica

676
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:12,909
he/she only wanted you to sit down that I am
1 00 honest% with you

677
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,631
he/she looks at the truth it is that I took advantage of him

678
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:19,004
ok, I made it, he/she didn't have anything to see

679
00:43:19,037 --> 00:43:23,798
I kissed him and he wanted to be sure
anything will interfere between him and you

680
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:26,879
and it already happened and we are only friends

681
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,123
 is all that happened?

682
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:31,169
clear, it is everything

683
00:43:31,723 --> 00:43:33,099
 Harlan?

684
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,145
she made me oral sex

685
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,846
he lies

686
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:47,313
but we don't kiss each other, June

687
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:49,398
Junepher,

688
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,350
what things

689
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:53,055
June returns

690
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:08,499
when dad died, you missed
some food especially?

691
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:10,443
 something?

692
00:44:10,486 --> 00:44:11,436
no

693
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,189
I took an alone time

694
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:17,819
I will light the radio

695
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:24,064
at least these on time, he/she enjoys
your food, I will wait Rachel

696
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:28,161
the life this full with surprises
still when he/she is falling everything

697
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:35,760
this it is not a surprise, mother,
this it is a damned lie

698
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,594
he/she hears we already arrive

699
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:08,051
then and l agreement is that I cannot see you
or to speak to you or to come closer to t i

700
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:12,052
I don't try to put on in one
cruel position

701
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:15,775
it is not exactly

702
00:45:18,946 --> 00:45:21,819
now she will put more
attention to that makes

703
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:27,115
you are my only friend

704
00:45:32,017 --> 00:45:33,842
ok is well

705
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:37,974
Rachel

706
00:45:42,814 --> 00:45:47,096
good ok, good-bye

707
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:59,399
 did you have a good time?

708
00:46:04,503 --> 00:46:06,415
 did you make it?

709
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,624
does what a mom make here?

710
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,163
where is the grandmother?

711
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:12,760
he/she went to fall asleep, I stayed to wait for you,

712
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,174
I take hours thinking how I will be able to
to forgive you

713
00:46:19,624 --> 00:46:22,114
I sometimes think the same thing
regarding you

714
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:31,310
and then, I was happened to use
the only weapon that I left

715
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:34,069
instead of using all the other ones

716
00:46:37,915 --> 00:46:39,861
and it is my love for you

717
00:46:39,902 --> 00:46:42,109
you took it to this point

718
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,603
I love you

719
00:46:44,642 --> 00:46:46,238
 did you practice it in the mirror?

720
00:46:46,822 --> 00:46:47,935
he/she waits

721
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:52,551
he leaves as their own one
daughter, that is it that not

722
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:54,477
I understand, he loves you

723
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:57,962
the question is if it is that he/she loves you
 how does he/she love me?

724
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:03,544
I want the truth

725
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:04,505
the same one that I said

726
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:06,067
dilo

727
00:47:06,108 --> 00:47:09,625
he should have you that said, for what reason to manage
10 hours to listen the same thing?

728
00:47:09,664 --> 00:47:11,903
he said it and I believe him/her

729
00:47:11,938 --> 00:47:14,046
I want to listen to it now of you

730
00:47:15,397 --> 00:47:16,347
Rachel

731
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:22,505
I don't believe that you know more
the difference

732
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:24,617
of what is well or
what is bad

733
00:47:24,656 --> 00:47:26,762
what a lie is and
what the truth is

734
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,215
and that it is my blame

735
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:35,931
only he/she didn't want to be as my mother

736
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:38,555
with all that of the good thing and
the bad thing and the rules

737
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:40,188
what is what you mean that?

738
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:41,689
that he never played you

739
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:43,075
he/she never played me

740
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,211
he never slipped their hands until
the superior part of my

741
00:47:46,249 --> 00:47:47,744
it never put their hands in my waist

742
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:49,676
when their head looked at you
while we had dinner

743
00:47:49,707 --> 00:47:52,493
never, it never put their mouth in my body

744
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:56,271
never mom, I said it

745
00:49:19,825 --> 00:49:21,615
at this time not, grandmother

746
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:24,784
I am proud of you

747
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:38,053
uh, is a happy morning

748
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,834
uh played you the naricita

749
00:49:40,873 --> 00:49:44,325
yes your naricita

750
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,879
 when did it begin?

751
00:50:09,129 --> 00:50:09,959
when he/she had 12

752
00:50:09,995 --> 00:50:11,819
 when did he/she stop?

753
00:50:14,255 --> 00:50:16,427
when my friend tried to kill him

754
00:50:16,946 --> 00:50:19,120
when he/she had 14

755
00:50:19,924 --> 00:50:22,862
I went to mass and I outlined the
option of beginning again

756
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:24,334
and there I left it

757
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:28,057
Rachel, takes!

758
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:33,631
ham and cheese, one is
for Simón, he/she takes

759
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,079
that you have a good day

760
00:50:45,682 --> 00:50:49,298
if you don't enter to have breakfast in 15 minutes,
you will have to wait to the lunch

761
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:09,795
it is they very already opened up

762
00:51:11,823 --> 00:51:16,650
ok, you believe me, it is all yours
you can use the colors

763
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:21,680
thank you Rachel

764
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:22,649
of anything

765
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:24,594
your mom is here of turn

766
00:51:25,888 --> 00:51:28,092
- good-bye
-good-bye pleasure of seeing you

767
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:30,626
thank you Dr.  Wilson

768
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,589
we see each other soon

769
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:32,571
of course

770
00:51:33,095 --> 00:51:36,777
hello, they are 25 dollars

771
00:51:36,812 --> 00:51:40,427
oh not, the doctor will send me
the invoice to my house

772
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:44,363
not you if one can because
he/she has to be charged today

773
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:45,715
where is Ethan?

774
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:48,884
it is on vacation, I don't really know
where it is

775
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:49,686
 effective or check?

776
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:54,429
you know that it is not the form
in that were accustomed to

777
00:51:54,462 --> 00:51:55,391
I am new

778
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:56,734
then

779
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,325
I will be paid him/her completely

780
00:51:59,364 --> 00:52:02,683
in their receipts and I will give him/her this
as a reminder

781
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:05,699
these they are copies of their receipts
unpaid

782
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:08,421
 when will Ethan return?

783
00:52:08,463 --> 00:52:09,391
I don't have idea

784
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:11,214
I will send him/her weekly reminders

785
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:12,460
thank you

786
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:13,264
of anything

787
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:14,862
it is not so happy this end

788
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:16,277
that he/she has good day

789
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,416
astonishing

790
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:23,832
I have not been able to charge to Nicolás in 4 years
and you already took out him/her 25 dollars in 2 minutes

791
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:25,468
I am this way

792
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:28,061
I am happy of you young lady Wilcox

793
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,944
oh, I never saw him/her making that

794
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:39,566
oh from the school that I don't play ,

795
00:52:39,602 --> 00:52:42,288
but this relaxes me a lot

796
00:52:43,638 --> 00:52:45,615
 did it go out with the shepherdess?

797
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:47,513
I not even thought it

798
00:52:48,828 --> 00:52:51,067
you know, it used to go out with your mother

799
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:52,052
I know it

800
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:55,585
we were some lunatics

801
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:00,200
why didn't he/she marry her?
problems would not exist

802
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,274
the things didn't work in the way
in that we would have liked it

803
00:53:04,237 --> 00:53:05,646
you know of and llo

804
00:53:05,678 --> 00:53:08,846
it is strange, then you could be my dad

805
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:13,077
but your dad had a car and a cow

806
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:15,481
yes I ended up seeing and l car

807
00:53:15,515 --> 00:53:17,010
the pizza is clever

808
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:28,164
at least answer him/her and tell him/her
that you don't want to speak to him/her

809
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,002
he/she answers and it cuts

810
00:53:32,493 --> 00:53:38,064
 you have something of this size but
more filudo?

811
00:53:39,414 --> 00:53:41,903
one of these it should be

812
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:49,719
you know that this puts me hysterical

813
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:52,410
I call it prenatural

814
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:56,838
I will finish here, without anything and without

815
00:53:56,873 --> 00:54:01,514
to live in a place
where I am not welcome

816
00:54:01,549 --> 00:54:03,013
who does he/she say that you are not welcome?

817
00:54:04,816 --> 00:54:05,679
your face

818
00:54:08,886 --> 00:54:10,295
at least you will be in prison

819
00:54:12,026 --> 00:54:16,788
I don't know if it is one of the better defenders
of criminals in California

820
00:54:16,832 --> 00:54:22,589
but it is over there happy, smiling, laughing
and playing to the golf

821
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:27,489
take you this!

822
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:37,681
then you did know my true dad?

823
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:42,744
it is exactly with the one that you wanted
that your daughter marries

824
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:44,758
he/she had their character

825
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,289
and everybody until me
we respected it

826
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:49,241
 average was not?

827
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,755
but he/she was good person

828
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,350
I know it

829
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:54,722
there

830
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,211
do you want to listen something strange?

831
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:00,710
probably not

832
00:55:02,161 --> 00:55:05,133
when Arnold spoke to me, I began
to hate the sex

833
00:55:06,486 --> 00:55:10,486
but then sometimes before only played me

834
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,787
I felt love for him

835
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,695
did he/she tell me how it can be this way?

836
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:23,521
the re lación that took was maybe good,
sure Rachel am not

837
00:55:23,561 --> 00:55:27,308
but I know that everything the rest was lie

838
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:36,151
I will show you the cover of this game ,
to finish quick and go home

839
00:55:36,184 --> 00:55:38,739
I won't see, I am not looking

840
00:55:38,778 --> 00:55:41,466
 how it is supposed that you will arm it
if you don't look at it?

841
00:55:42,111 --> 00:55:45,148
it is as knowing how it is
that your life will finish

842
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:47,971
he/she makes that all that involved
fall

843
00:55:48,005 --> 00:55:48,769
good, veto to house

844
00:55:49,575 --> 00:55:50,591
I don't want to go home

845
00:55:50,632 --> 00:55:53,504
you cannot stay here,
good night

846
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,026
hour of sleeping

847
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:41,243
I found this in the closet

848
00:56:41,282 --> 00:56:43,870
I believed that it would be safe there

849
00:56:45,029 --> 00:56:48,099
most of people guard

850
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:52,451
people's gifts that the visit

851
00:56:53,486 --> 00:56:55,212
I don't like flowers inside the house

852
00:56:56,274 --> 00:56:59,825
he/she is late mother, will sleep

853
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:09,910
oh goes

854
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:15,259
there was a time in that you pulled me of those
hair if you found me drinking

855
00:57:15,303 --> 00:57:18,471
a long time ago, of your hair

856
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,764
it is good

857
00:57:26,003 --> 00:57:27,794
this will go here

858
00:57:34,557 --> 00:57:35,485
here he/she goes

859
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,963
they come here, allow me to take you to the bed, we go

860
00:57:45,001 --> 00:57:49,708
no, don't attempt it, you don't come
to my life to tell me what to make

861
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:51,533
everybody should pay attention to the rule

862
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:53,064
I don't like your rules

863
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:55,826
I please ask you you to leave me calm

864
00:57:55,861 --> 00:58:00,241
for your father, it is already enough

865
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:03,929
but you continue this way, you are drunk

866
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:06,007
it is not a lot like it stops
that you are alarmed

867
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:06,975
he/she was afraid ,

868
00:58:07,008 --> 00:58:10,274
Arnold maintains us,
he helped me

869
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:15,268
- I want you to stay
-I want you to die

870
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:26,445
really not, only a little bit

871
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:29,168
why do you scream to the abue the?

872
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:34,136
because you slept with my husband

873
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:41,732
Rachel

874
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:44,424
mom!

875
00:58:45,612 --> 00:58:46,311

00:59:04,064 --> 00:59:06,238

896
00:59:34,243 --> 00:59:36,864
he/she can make it almost alone

897
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,832
I am fishing

898
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,654

good it seems that it is already better

902
01:00:15,474 --> 01:00:16,882
apparently yes

903
01:00:16,915 --> 01:00:21,110
suddenly he/she put on this way and
he/she started to run as crazy

904
01:00:21,144 --> 01:00:24,692
it is not normal in pigs
 does he/she believe that it is stress?

905
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:25,878
stress in pigs

906
01:00:37,994 --> 01:00:38,978
silly!

907
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:41,668

908
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:03,552
go to work, pass it well

909
01:01:04,808 --> 01:01:06,882
I don't seem him beautiful

910
01:01:06,922 --> 01:01:08,419
he doesn't like I

911
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,885
no, he likes the problems and the adventure

912
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:24,923
where is Rachel?

913
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:26,494
where Simón

914
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:27,457
how good

915
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,210
I thought that you would not leave until
that you are well

916
01:01:30,244 --> 01:01:31,173
 to where do you go now?

917
01:01:31,205 --> 01:01:32,134
I will give a turn

918
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:34,024
you are not dressed as to give a turn

919
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,841
I am thirsty, I die from thirst ,

920
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:40,262
and I can no longer remain inside

921
01:01:40,303 --> 01:01:41,232
although you to I will go in bus

922
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:42,192
no

923
01:01:42,225 --> 01:01:43,656
it was not a question

924
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:44,629
no

925
01:01:44,662 --> 01:01:46,157
certainly that not

926
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,050
allow me to go, I don't care your regals

927
01:01:49,563 --> 01:01:51,540
don't no longer continue

928
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,990
come unfastened

929
01:01:57,508 --> 01:01:59,418
it is well, don't wet me

930
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:06,631
I called Arnold last night and
I requested him/her the divorce

931
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,471
 do you find mom well?

932
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:15,215
you lost your...

933
01:02:17,787 --> 01:02:19,129

934
01:02:20,864 --> 01:02:24,161
I will take the bus,
he/she enters to the house

935
01:02:31,273 --> 01:02:32,038

01:02:38,224 --> 01:02:40,016

I believe that a good ide went to

941
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,213
I tossed hn little of perfume in
your washbasin

942
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:10,319
I don't believe that it bothers you

943
01:03:11,544 --> 01:03:13,552
I forgot that he/she had that perfume

944
01:03:13,592 --> 01:03:15,734
this fence to your hygienic paper

945
01:03:15,773 --> 01:03:18,459
every time that you pass somewhere around you see it

946
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:24,509
do you want to smell it?

947
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:25,664
non thank you

948
01:03:25,703 --> 01:03:27,910

949
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,620
poem that contains the
line.. " it lay under and l bust

950
01:03:36,658 --> 01:03:38,962
of Athena on the door of l room "

951
01:03:38,997 --> 01:03:40,461
which it is and l crow

952
01:03:40,503 --> 01:03:41,453

953
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:43,930

954
01:03:43,962 --> 01:03:45,527
in commercial

955
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:48,862
can you hug me?

956
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,587
 to hug you?

957
01:03:52,326 --> 01:03:53,668
to put on next to you

958
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:57,891
to feel that somebody is next to me

959
01:04:06,357 --> 01:04:08,365
" which the wolf is "

960
01:04:08,407 --> 01:04:09,334
correct

961
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:10,897
can I request you another favor?

962
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:13,369
what?

963
01:04:13,404 --> 01:04:14,834
relax you!

964
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:22,115
I believe that leave to sleep

965
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:23,843
there are blankets and pillows
in the closet

966
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:24,830
ok

967
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:31,080
you should sometimes eat something

968
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,218
I will open the door

969
01:04:43,997 --> 01:04:45,690
oh, you intersected the hair

970
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:47,898
it was amid my drunkenness

971
01:04:50,726 --> 01:04:52,638
oh already memory

972
01:04:53,129 --> 01:04:55,074
dad's hugs

973
01:04:55,115 --> 01:04:56,710
he/she always smiled

974
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:58,442
for any thing

975
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,587
it was very pretty

976
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:01,641
clear

977
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:05,677
why you tried to move away it
of my?

978
01:05:06,456 --> 01:05:07,667
 me?

979
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:11,539
sometimes, you didn't like that
let us look at TV together

980
01:05:11,582 --> 01:05:12,760
and you took it away from my

981
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,031
TV distracted you when
they should rest

982
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:19,267
 you feared a lot that we came closer
a lot my dad and me?

983
01:05:19,303 --> 01:05:22,437
 how much did we attach?

984
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,018
you know, in most of the cases

985
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,328
he/she feared you to marry a fool

986
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:33,676
and to lose all that you had gotten
as it happened to me to my

987
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:37,361
I believe that it was for their alcoholism

988
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,596
and yours also

989
01:05:42,047 --> 01:05:43,193
yes

990
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:50,343
you know what it is what I don't really understand
of all this

991
01:05:50,378 --> 01:05:51,327
maybe guess

992
01:05:52,844 --> 01:05:55,149
if he really loved me

993
01:05:56,368 --> 01:05:57,994
oh is not silly

994
01:05:58,418 --> 01:06:02,766
I refer to at some time, not
I include to the present talves

995
01:06:02,807 --> 01:06:04,401
 which you believe that they were
the rules then?

996
01:06:04,441 --> 01:06:10,011
why it will lose and l time for
somebody that I didn't care?

997
01:06:12,226 --> 01:06:17,829
I remember that gave it jiste

998
01:06:17,864 --> 01:06:19,721
my parents never gave it jeron

999
01:06:19,755 --> 01:06:21,698
and how do you know that they didn't make it?

1000
01:06:23,408 --> 01:06:24,869
I don't know it

1001
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:36,660
hate

1002
01:06:37,277 --> 01:06:40,029
that you have bought me so many

1003
01:06:41,987 --> 01:06:43,394
 do you think yourself to drink all?

1004
01:06:45,703 --> 01:06:46,597
no

1005
01:07:12,132 --> 01:07:14,818
 how could not he/she love you?

1006
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:36,250
Rachel

1007
01:07:36,289 --> 01:07:38,462
oh took the free day

1008
01:07:39,876 --> 01:07:41,984
he/she needs more exercise, to walk more

1009
01:07:42,023 --> 01:07:43,650
enough with that then

1010
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:45,191
 or not?

1011
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:48,842
you have to behave well

1012
01:07:50,576 --> 01:07:52,072
it is very fat

1013
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:54,485
fat are

1014
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:58,776
you see what I told you, the doctor he/she mentioned it
I was not me

1015
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:00,251
thank you

1016
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,233
clear

1017
01:08:04,351 --> 01:08:05,978
you are pretty with the short hair

1018
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:13,253
where is Rachel?

1019
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,883
it is Saturday I gave him/her the free day

1020
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,331
he/she left to fish with Harlan

1021
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:21,743
I need to stop to drink

1022
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:25,427
I am not here

1023
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:27,856
 how can I help?

1024
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:30,137
it is pregnant also

1025
01:08:33,023 --> 01:08:35,447
I want to go to my office with her
I take a long time one second

1026
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:36,439
ok

1027
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,720
it is with the Californian fool

1028
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:46,153
it was worthwhile to spy

1029
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:47,140
I don't know it

1030
01:08:49,234 --> 01:08:50,730
it is risky that you ace my friend

1031
01:08:50,772 --> 01:08:53,709
good I was thinking a lot
and reaching conclusions

1032
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:56,504
we can maybe be more than friends

1033
01:08:56,538 --> 01:09:04,348
you know, maybe can
to end up loving me

1034
01:09:09,673 --> 01:09:11,267
I kick the boys

1035
01:09:12,939 --> 01:09:14,022
seriously

1036
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:16,071
it is something that loved you

1037
01:09:16,561 --> 01:09:17,423
I kick them

1038
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:21,259
good but like I will be far
in this mission

1039
01:09:22,615 --> 01:09:24,855
I don't believe that you can paté ar for always

1040
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:29,047
prome to overcome it

1041
01:09:29,663 --> 01:09:34,044
I believe that I leave, put
the raft fences to the bank

1042
01:09:36,935 --> 01:09:38,464
more cats

1043
01:09:38,505 --> 01:09:40,745
it seems that this town needs more cats

1044
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,368
and that it was my last patient

1045
01:09:46,546 --> 01:09:48,008
 does already nobody look the hour?

1046
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,255
me yes and you

1047
01:09:50,295 --> 01:09:51,923
I made it yesterday

1048
01:09:51,961 --> 01:09:53,686
what is what puts back to a clock?

1049
01:09:57,407 --> 01:10:01,469
and that completely sounds a complete one
disorder

1050
01:10:02,982 --> 01:10:04,543
except you, you are not a disaster

1051
01:10:05,095 --> 01:10:05,957
anyway

1052
01:10:07,754 --> 01:10:10,025
I need to show up

1053
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:13,480
that seems a good beginning
to overcome it

1054
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,530
I am inside in re alidad
from already

1055
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:21,077
I will make the arrangements and I warn you

1056
01:10:21,465 --> 01:10:22,809
thank you

1057
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:26,489
 is all that you need?

1058
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:31,002
I will miss what I began to lose

1059
01:10:33,607 --> 01:10:35,517
people are busy

1060
01:10:36,363 --> 01:10:39,235
as busy as for not noticing
what your husband made to your daughter

1061
01:10:41,777 --> 01:10:43,599
yes because, I don't know eómo it happens that

1062
01:10:45,236 --> 01:10:49,616
you always tell me the truth, thank you

1063
01:11:22,174 --> 01:11:23,157
what was that?

1064
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,148
I don't know it, I sit down it

1065
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,065
no

1066
01:11:27,524 --> 01:11:30,308
thank you

1067
01:11:30,343 --> 01:11:31,838
I should leave

1068
01:11:56,867 --> 01:11:59,139
 how long more we will follow them?

1069
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:02,441
until it snows

1070
01:12:04,365 --> 01:12:05,708
ok makes it

1071
01:12:05,743 --> 01:12:06,888
Medy, lists

1072
01:12:07,664 --> 01:12:10,001
Harlan

1073
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:12,371
I will give you a good clap

1074
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,545
vamonos!

1075
01:12:17,244 --> 01:12:18,587
the car doesn't start up

1076
01:12:25,701 --> 01:12:27,297
volte to toward us

1077
01:12:27,336 --> 01:12:28,766
oh God, descend

1078
01:12:35,728 --> 01:12:36,590

hello, I will show up,
I am Rachel Willcox

1080
01:12:52,612 --> 01:12:53,540
a lot of pleasure

1081
01:12:53,572 --> 01:12:54,501
Chris Cunning has

1082
01:12:54,534 --> 01:12:55,461
me...

1083
01:12:55,494 --> 01:12:56,422
 how are you?

1084
01:12:56,455 --> 01:13:01,578
he/she looks I only came to tell you that Harlan and me
we are only friends

1085
01:13:01,613 --> 01:13:03,021
anything will spend another time

1086
01:13:03,055 --> 01:13:04,944
I promise it, for the honor scout

1087
01:13:04,977 --> 01:13:07,402
then they can go and to make their things

1088
01:13:07,444 --> 01:13:08,939
to have a good time

1089
01:13:08,981 --> 01:13:14,005
and tell to June that doesn't have
that to worry

1090
01:13:14,075 --> 01:13:15,767
and what has happened was already

1091
01:13:15,804 --> 01:13:16,668
and it is the end of it

1092
01:13:16,702 --> 01:13:18,647
ok

1093
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:21,538
then why ho you leave home

1274
01:28:13,036 --> 01:28:15,855
good, he/she decided that
it would be me the liar

1275
01:28:15,888 --> 01:28:17,799
then you owe me

1276
01:28:19,571 --> 01:28:20,981
to be due what?

1277
01:28:24,313 --> 01:28:26,289
not taking you in opinion

1278
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:28,212
it would affect you a lot

1279
01:28:28,253 --> 01:28:29,815
to be in the newspapers

1280
01:28:29,855 --> 01:28:32,159
he/she wanted you to write him/her
a letter requesting me

1281
01:28:32,192 --> 01:28:33,789
an excuse for that made

1282
01:28:33,829 --> 01:28:34,756
 is that?

1283
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:36,707
and a check for 10 millions

1284
01:28:39,852 --> 01:28:41,641
oh, clear, that, certainly

1285
01:28:41,676 --> 01:28:44,330
I mean, always
you wanted to give the appearance,

1286
01:28:44,367 --> 01:28:46,193
of a good relationship father - daughter

1287
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:48,878
that impressed me and for that
instant for my all was well

1288
01:28:48,917 --> 01:28:50,773
it is a great lie yours

1289
01:28:50,806 --> 01:28:52,499
I believe that better you give me 20 my llones

1290
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:56,949
because if he/she decides that you are a shit,
then he/she will receive 10

1291
01:28:57,951 --> 01:28:58,999
ok

1292
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:02,845
we see each other in trial

1293
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:06,790
as I have the tape

1294
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:10,022
of what do you speak?

1295
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:14,539
you know, I hate this scent

1296
01:29:14,577 --> 01:29:15,724
of what do you speak?

1297
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,354
 do you remember to Tomy?

1298
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:20,880
him that he/she threatened you with the gun

1299
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,706
 then you are above with cables or cameras?

1300
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:25,628
he/she doesn't swim, with sincerity

1301
01:29:27,392 --> 01:29:30,176
ok, is already enough Rachel

1302
01:29:33,349 --> 01:29:38,090
and l matter is that I have it engraving ,
there is a video of us

1303
01:29:38,124 --> 01:29:39,073
oh yes

1304
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,931
you, all sweaty one ,

1305
01:29:41,968 --> 01:29:45,321
entering she and I had 14

1306
01:29:45,909 --> 01:29:46,673
grandiose

1307
01:29:46,709 --> 01:29:51,351
he/she looks, as much as my mother it is happy, you will have everything

1308
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,763
I won't make fairy against you,

1309
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,863
- happy mantén to my mother ok?
-ok

1310
01:30:07,149 --> 01:30:08,360
 were you thinking?

1311
01:30:08,397 --> 01:30:10,440
I have some saved money

1312
01:30:10,897 --> 01:30:14,217
and it would be happy of paying the
education of Rachel

1313
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:15,722
it won't be that a problem

1314
01:30:17,304 --> 01:30:19,476
or maybe neither he/she needs it and you already have it

1315
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:23,829
maybe with a mortgage you feel happier

1316
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:29,468
mom, I leave in the morning with Arnold

1317
01:30:36,206 --> 01:30:37,254
thank you

1318
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:43,792
veto to the sofa

1319
01:31:44,986 --> 01:31:45,915
I love you

1320
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:50,521
please Simón

1321
01:31:50,561 --> 01:31:51,509
no

1322
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:54,464
it is not like with your family

1323
01:31:55,237 --> 01:31:59,465
I will never have sex with you ,
never, not

1324
01:32:00,235 --> 01:32:03,587
I not even think it and
ent iende that not

1325
01:32:04,559 --> 01:32:05,904
you are good in it maybe

1326
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:09,804
but the matter of the attraction for beauty

1327
01:32:09,845 --> 01:32:11,823
and demons take away from my

1328
01:32:11,865 --> 01:32:13,143
he/she doesn't have anything to do with him

1329
01:32:13,179 --> 01:32:16,663
him trat or of forcing the things toward my,
without necessity that you enter to my bed

1330
01:32:16,702 --> 01:32:17,652
as a friend, or a father

1331
01:32:17,695 --> 01:32:19,190
he/she has everything to do with him

1332
01:32:22,468 --> 01:32:27,591
this is to know it I gave ferencia of the correct thing
and the incorrect thing, of the truth and the ment anger

1333
01:32:28,522 --> 01:32:30,282
he made you before that

1334
01:32:31,309 --> 01:32:35,088
and if you cannot notice the difference,
you cannot trust nobody

1335
01:32:37,366 --> 01:32:39,090
and you won't be able to love then

1336
01:32:44,093 --> 01:32:46,396
 how you make to be so
sure of yourself?

1337
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:48,512
it is good that

1338
01:32:53,605 --> 01:32:57,090
count me of your wife,
describe me the

1339
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:03,505
what do I describe you?

1340
01:33:04,948 --> 01:33:06,477
 did you love her?

1341
01:33:08,505 --> 01:33:13,726
when he/she played it, it felt the best
it leaves of my being played

1342
01:33:17,281 --> 01:33:19,706
it is a different form of loving, Rachel

1343
01:33:20,838 --> 01:33:22,214
 do you believe that vue lvas to love?

1344
01:33:24,491 --> 01:33:26,117
I don't know it

1345
01:33:26,892 --> 01:33:28,137
maybe, I don't know it

1346
01:33:29,423 --> 01:33:30,636
maybe

1347
01:33:34,196 --> 01:33:36,688
thank you to not say

1348
01:33:53,514 --> 01:33:54,727
where is your car?

1349
01:33:54,764 --> 01:33:59,558
to the turn of the corner, for
reasons of security

1350
01:34:01,587 --> 01:34:05,301
if he/she could close the doors and windows
and to maintain it far from t i, he/she would make it

1351
01:34:05,335 --> 01:34:06,800
he/she would wait for the insurance

1352
01:34:12,384 --> 01:34:13,662
you know that I know it

1353
01:34:14,627 --> 01:34:16,800
oh goes George t you

1354
01:34:17,381 --> 01:34:20,351
I believe Rache l, I know it

1355
01:34:20,393 --> 01:34:21,801
and you also know it

1356
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:24,967
 it is not displeasing to have that in your mind?

1357
01:34:25,005 --> 01:34:29,418
you are a criminal, not known here
but you will already fall

1358
01:34:32,085 --> 01:34:36,980
if my hi ja was not in love
of t i, would kill you

1359
01:34:41,793 --> 01:34:45,212
it seems that Rachel didn't arrive, but you/he/she seems
that it is busy

1360
01:34:45,252 --> 01:34:46,781
thank you

1361
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,117
could you give him/her this to and lla?

1362
01:34:50,154 --> 01:34:51,082
since I don't see it

1363
01:34:51,115 --> 01:34:52,676
please

1364
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,310
I don't want you to leave

1365
01:35:05,979 --> 01:35:07,706
I call you when arriving

1366
01:35:08,384 --> 01:35:12,161
I know that that glass will be seen
well in your shelf

1367
01:35:12,194 --> 01:35:14,205
clear, I will find the best place

1368
01:35:14,245 --> 01:35:15,653
thank you

1369
01:35:28,725 --> 01:35:30,352
small hey

1370
01:35:30,774 --> 01:35:32,850
they come to say goodbye to Lili

1371
01:35:35,453 --> 01:35:37,342
- adi ós,
-adi ós L i li

1372
01:35:37,374 --> 01:35:39,003
adi ós children

1373
01:36:05,854 --> 01:36:07,166

1374
01:36:08,355 --> 01:36:09,370
I already go

1375
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:15,144
Rachel why ho you lifted the telephone?

1376
01:36:16,491 --> 01:36:17,352
newly I got up

1377
01:36:17,836 --> 01:36:19,431
Simón has just left for and l work

1378
01:36:19,469 --> 01:36:20,365
he/she was ahead

1379
01:36:24,212 --> 01:36:28,407
I thought that it could allow him/her to leave,
but I am not able to Rachel

1380
01:36:28,985 --> 01:36:30,033
him ment iste

1381
01:36:31,099 --> 01:36:33,786
I arm puzzle guiding me of the cover

1382
01:36:35,231 --> 01:36:35,963
look at me!

1383
01:36:36,001 --> 01:36:37,049
why?

1384
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:39,711
you look at me, you should tell him/her the truth

1385
01:36:39,751 --> 01:36:43,780
Simón says that difference doesn't exist among
the truth and the lie

1386
01:36:44,459 --> 01:36:46,151
is he/she able to the lie to be correct?

1387
01:36:46,188 --> 01:36:47,138
no

1388
01:36:48,815 --> 01:36:51,087
and what does it happen if I tell the truth?

1389
01:36:51,762 --> 01:36:53,837
they will be imputed criminal positions

1390
01:36:53,877 --> 01:36:56,431
but he/she will take long steps

1391
01:36:56,471 --> 01:36:57,880
we go you leave to vest to go

1392
01:36:57,913 --> 01:36:58,841
but he/she looks I have to go to the kitchen
and to make some things

1393
01:36:58,874 --> 01:36:59,889
we will attempt this way it

1394
01:36:59,931 --> 01:37:02,718
Simón and Harlan t clever ienen the camione ta
and and lla gave me this to give you

1395
01:37:02,752 --> 01:37:04,378
no, will change

1396
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:06,273
you can read it in and l road

1397
01:37:06,307 --> 01:37:07,234
hurry!

1398
01:37:07,267 --> 01:37:08,676
what does he/she make you think that he/she will believe me now?

1399
01:37:08,708 --> 01:37:11,298
we will make it, you and me

1400
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,991
I should maybe manage

1401
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:25,039
clear but I won't leave you hanejar

1402
01:37:30,557 --> 01:37:31,901
why are you so hurried?

1403
01:37:37,445 --> 01:37:39,905
 will you send more to somebody for your car?

1404
01:37:39,945 --> 01:37:40,775
it is ridiculous

1405
01:37:40,809 --> 01:37:44,261
good, non sue him to make that, but
that he/she has been giving me problems

1406
01:37:45,423 --> 01:37:48,393
it is not good to leave it in a street
anyone of Idaho

1407
01:37:48,434 --> 01:37:52,749

she seduced me

1432
01:39:36,427 --> 01:39:38,469
you are a damned one!

1433
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:39,819
what did you hope he/she makes?

1434
01:39:39,854 --> 01:39:41,964
 was it drugged?

1435
01:39:42,003 --> 01:39:43,792
and fortune-teller what?

1436
01:39:43,827 --> 01:39:45,618
she enjoyed it

1437
01:39:45,653 --> 01:39:47,565
no

1438
01:39:49,178 --> 01:39:50,586
do you want to take this in opinion?

1439
01:39:50,619 --> 01:39:53,722
it continues, for my well

1440
01:39:53,759 --> 01:39:57,023

01:40:02,312 --> 01:40:05,065
gone damned pervert!

1442
01:40:15,959 --> 01:40:18,865
dear Rachel, my mother
he/she always told me the things

1443
01:40:18,908 --> 01:40:21,560
more difíci them of the life
in those which to trust

1444
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:24,951
to have faith and to forgive

1445
01:40:24,994 --> 01:40:29,057
then I want you to know about my voice

1446
01:40:29,095 --> 01:40:32,644
that I forgive you because I love you

1447
01:40:33,323 --> 01:40:35,213
so simple and so complex

1448
01:40:35,246 --> 01:40:37,833
to forgive is to continue ahead,

1449
01:40:38,512 --> 01:40:41,386
to continue with everything, he/she loves you, your mom

1450
01:41:22,499 --> 01:41:23,515
mom!

1451
01:41:25,543 --> 01:41:28,130
lament that happened

1452
01:41:29,514 --> 01:41:32,867
oh affection

1453
01:41:34,095 --> 01:41:34,990
I love you

1454
01:41:38,997 --> 01:41:40,045
I regret it so much

1455
01:41:40,086 --> 01:41:40,914
yes

1456
01:41:45,531 --> 01:41:46,875
Mrs. Randoll

1457
01:41:47,391 --> 01:41:50,241
I believe that he/she already knows that I am
in love with their granddaughter

1458
01:41:50,273 --> 01:41:57,090
and when it returns of my mission,
I will marry her.

1459
01:41:57,129 --> 01:41:58,078
ok
