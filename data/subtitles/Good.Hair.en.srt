1
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:24,096
 Those are my daughters,
 Lola and Zahra,

2
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:26,632
 the most beautiful girls
 in the world.

3
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:29,633
 And even though I tell them
 that they're beautiful every single day,

4
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,272
 sometimes
 it's just not good enough.

5
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:36,075
 Just yesterday,
 Lola came into the house crying

6
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:39,076
 and said, ''Daddy, how come
 I don't have good hair?''

7
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:44,515
 I wonder
 how she came up with that idea?

8
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:48,821
 Well, there's always this sort of pressure
 within the black community,

9
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:51,624
 like, ''Oh, if you have good hair,

10
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,625
 ''you're prettier or better
 than the brown-skinned girl

11
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:57,861
 ''that wears the Afro or the dreads
 or the natural hairstyle.''

12
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:59,832
 I mean,
 have I gone around thinking it,

13
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,168
 and have I said it to myself,
 ''l got good hair''?

14
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:03,202
 Do I say it to my daughter,

15
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:05,604
 like, and not even
 thinking what I'm saying?

16
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:07,173
 I'm like,
 ''Honey, you have such good hair.

17
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:08,674
 ''You have such beautiful hair.''

18
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,675
 Growing up, I considered
 anybody's hair but mine good hair.

19
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:13,746
 Like, my mom is white.

20
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:15,848
 I'm half Russian and Norwegian
 on my mother's side,

21
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,849
 so my mom's hair is silky and blonde,
 and I was like, ''Why?

22
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:22,221
 ''Just why didn't I get your genetics?''

23
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,356
 That was what I looked at as,
 you know,

24
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:27,357
 good hair was white hair.

25
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,364
 The lighter, the brighter,
 the better.

26
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:35,067
 And that's a thing
 that causes great dissension

27
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,269
 within the black community
 and with black women.

28
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,472
 You know,
 I look in the black hair books,

29
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:41,707
 and it's like all the hair
 is straight.

30
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,276
 It was a hard,
 like, decision in the beginning.

31
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:47,277
 I said, ''No, I'm going to be strong
 against all the forces

32
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,516
 ''that are going to try to get me
 to straighten my hair.''

33
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,585
 You know,
 you look at the magazines

34
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:54,186
 and you want to be that girl,
 you know.

35
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:55,855
 You want to be that girl,

36
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:58,657
 and you have this fantasy
 where you think,

37
00:02:58,658 --> 00:02:59,692
 ''If they straighten it out,

38
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:00,759
 ''then all of a sudden
 it's going to grow

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,061
 ''and it's going to really move
 and it's going to really flow

40
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:03,462
 ''and I'm going to have this hair.''

41
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:05,197
 Well, you never had the hair
 to begin with,

42
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:06,565
 but you don't know that,
 you know.

43
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:08,801
 When you look at a woman's hair,

44
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,237
 it's a fantasy come true
 if they can really pull that off.

45
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:14,238
 So, for me,
 yeah, hair's real important.

46
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,708
 Well, I would say
 that hair is a woman's glory,

47
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,847
 and that you share
 that glory with your family.

48
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:25,851
 And they get to see you braiding it,

49
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,720
 and they get to see you washing it,

50
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,388
 and they get to--It's a glory.

51
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,389
 But it is not a bad thing
 or a good thing. It's hair.

52
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,460
 If you have it on your head,
 it's good.

53
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:36,362
 If you have it growing
 between your toes,

54
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:38,264
 it probably isn't so good.

55
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:41,265
 So what feeds
 this hair machine?

56
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:43,969
 How do we decide
 what good hair is?

57
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,772
 Well, at least for some people,
 that decision is made

58
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:49,773
 where all major
 black decisions are made...

59
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:53,043
 in Atlanta
 at the Bronner Brothers Hair Show.

60
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:56,248
 That's right,
 the Bronner Brothers Hair Show.

61
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,951
 Twice a year,
 for over sixty years,

62
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,952
 the Bronner Brothers
 have hosted this massive hair show

63
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,622
 with over 120,000 hair professionals
 in attendance,

64
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,295
 over twenty-eight major hotels
 booked exclusively,

65
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:12,296
 and over $60 million pumped
 into the Atlanta economy.

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
 Good hair is good business.

67
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,938
 My father started it
 sixty years ago,

68
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:21,307
 and the show was
 actually a seminar

69
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,475
 to teach the people
 buying the products

70
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:25,477
 how to use the products.

71
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:27,346
 And sixty years later,

72
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:28,914
 the number-one purpose
 of the hair show,

73
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:31,915
 to come learn
 how to use new products.

74
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:35,385
 Certain products, we index triple
 what the white market does.

75
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:40,457
 We're at 12째/째 of the population,
 but we buy 80째/째 of the hair.

76
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,695
 Wow!

77
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,797
 I got in the wrong business.

78
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:47,798
 All I know is, we spend
 a ton of money on our hair.

79
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,502
 No matter what,
 we going to look good.

80
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:52,137
 We going to look good.

81
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,238
 You know,
 that's the bottom line.

82
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,908
 We're going
 to look good regardless.

83
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,476
 While the main purpose
 of the show

84
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:59,678
 is to promote products
 and make tons of money,

85
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:02,679
 the three-day event
 culminates in a hair contest

86
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:04,583
 where stylists
 from around the world

87
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,652
 come to compete
 and show off their skills

88
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:09,221
 in front of an arena
 of cheering hair fans.

89
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:12,222
 The winner
 not only takes home $20,000,

90
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:15,160
 but also receives
 lucrative endorsement deals

91
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,161
 and establishes themselves
 as the leading voice in black hair.

92
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:22,232
 Now, can you tell me,
 how are the hairstylists chosen

93
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:25,337
 to compete in this competition?

94
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:28,007
 We try and select
 the best of the best.

95
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:31,008
 If we see someone
 that's exciting on stages,

96
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,513
 we invite them in
 to do our Battle.

97
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:37,216
 Tanya, I really
 can't say her strength,

98
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,217
 'cause this is
 her first time doing the Battle.

99
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,555
 Her weakness
 is that she's sort of new.

100
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,958
 Well, I'm happy to be nappy.
 How about that?

101
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,959
 Oh, Lord.
 See, Tanya, don't take it there.

102
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:50,763
 She don't want to be nappy.

103
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:51,864
 No, I'm not saying--

104
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:54,633
 I know my hair
 can get very coarse, but...

105
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,569
 Ooh, and then they try
 to find a better word for it.

106
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,772
 Yes!

107
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:01,874
 Dress it up, baby. It's okay.

108
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,409
 That's a stigma.

109
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,244
 Chris, are you listening?

110
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,079
 It's not called bad.

111
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,881
 Nappy's not bad.

112
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:09,915
 Well, actually--

113
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,083
 It can still be good.

114
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:12,885
 It's just nappy.

115
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,520
 I changed it around.

116
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,521
 'Cause people
 with that soft, natural, curly hair,

117
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:20,459
 I call that bad hair now.

118
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,660
 Okay, 'cause it's hard to curl?

119
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,295
 'Cause nappy hair holds curls.

120
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:26,296
 Tanya's new to this,
 but she's also business partners

121
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,134
 with former Bronner Brothers
 champion Kevin Kirk.

122
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:32,004
 Kevin won twenty grand
 back in 2005,

123
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:34,173
 when twenty grand
 really meant something.

124
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:37,174
 If that belt could talk,
 what do you think it would say?

125
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:42,212
 It'd say, ''Bring home
 my brother August 18th.''

126
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,018
 So the brother's held captive?

127
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,186
 It's held captive.

128
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:48,954
 Bronner Brothers
 got it on lock right now.

129
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,823
 I picture myself being David

130
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,824
 and all the other contestants
 being Goliath.

131
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:01,198
 Derek is a very exciting person.

132
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:02,468
 He's a unique person.

133
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,070
 His performance
 is always at the top.

134
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,539
 Styling, he might be
 a little bit weak on that,

135
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,540
 but exciting, very exciting.

136
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,444
 Derek competed last year

137
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,445
 and many people, mostly Derek,
 felt he should have won.

138
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:18,117
 But he ended up losing
 on two technicalities:

139
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:21,118
 nudity and too many people
 on stage at one time.

140
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,425
 My biggest scare was me

141
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,961
 trying to find a pair of boots
 to wear for the show.

142
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:30,763
 A guy hit me up on MySpace,

143
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:33,031
 and he ends up
 being a boot designer.

144
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:35,834
 Jayda, Tyree.
 Terrence, Tyree.

145
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:37,503
 And he basically
 takes boots that you--

146
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,637
 a boot
 that you already have,

147
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,806
 and redesigns it
 and customizes it

148
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:43,807
 and, hopefully, you guys will see
 a phat pair of boots.

149
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:48,645
 I can't wait.
 I'm so excited about this right now.

150
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:51,784
 Freddie...

151
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:53,318
 very smart.

152
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,188
 That's her strength.
 Smart, can do hair.

153
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:58,490
 Her weakness
 is that she over-thinks it.

154
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:01,226
 She goes
 over the audience's head.

155
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,262
 Last year's theme
 was Broke Front Mountain.

156
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,530
 So that was based

157
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,498
 - on the movie Brokeback Mountain.
 - It was, kind of.

158
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,534
 When we did the...

159
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:09,902
 We did a video clip

160
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:12,903
 that was in the beginning
 that was about thirty seconds.

161
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,241
 I'm going to work on her
 with all these.

162
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:19,242
 I might have to hide
 from them to get them, though.

163
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:22,147
 I'm going to be hiding
 more than Harriet Tubman was hiding.

164
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,750
 You know,
 I liked Broke Front Mountain.

165
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,352
 I think I just shouldn't have
 cut the hair in the boxes.

166
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:30,155
 I put this ''FJ,''
 my logo on there,

167
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:31,723
 and people thought
 it was something Asian.

168
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:34,724
 They just couldn't keep up.

169
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:41,198
 Now, which of the other stylists
 are you most worried about?

170
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:45,838
 Probably Jason.

171
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,739
 Jason Griggers.

172
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,708
 Me and Jason
 know of each other.

173
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,709
 Do you have
 any enemies in hair?

174
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,079
 No.

175
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,083
 Jason's strength
 is his incredible hairstyles.

176
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:05,791
 l, actually, am
 from the same hometown as Jason.

177
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:08,360
 He's been doing my hair
 since about 2000,

178
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,429
 and my hair was her length
 when I started coming,

179
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,897
 and this is mine.

180
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,265
 No tracks in this.

181
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:16,266
 So he has what we used to call
 ''the growing hand.''

182
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:18,303
 I never said that.

183
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:21,304
 So, Jason, you seem to be able
 to get women off the weaves.

184
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,847
 You're kind of like
 the Betty Ford of black hair.

185
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:31,848
 I refer to it
 as the Rosa Parks of hair.

186
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:37,155
 Jason...

187
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:39,658
 where does a white man
 learn how to do black hair?

188
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,460
 In school,
 they teach you everything.

189
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:44,096
 This one teacher that I had,

190
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,598
 she would always give me
 a pair of these

191
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,834
 to walk around school with,
 and she'd say,

192
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,569
 ''l don't hear you
 clicking and twisting.

193
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,070
 ''l don't hear you
 clicking and twisting.''

194
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,105
 Was she a black woman?

195
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:54,139
 She was a black woman.

196
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,440
 She was
 the only black teacher at school.

197
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,509
 And she was determined
 to teach you--

198
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,510
 She was determined to teach me
 how to work those Marcel irons.

199
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:03,847
 So she's like Branch Rickey
 and you're the Jackie Robinson.

200
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:07,786
 That's ''The Jackie Robinson Story''

201
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,888
 starring Jackie Robinson as himself.

202
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,224
 It's big league all the way.

203
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:14,326
 There are some white people
 that are good at doing black hair.

204
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:17,327
 But there are very few
 that I've met.

205
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:19,898
 There are very few.

206
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,333
 So what happens is,

207
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:24,334
 you walk in
 and the first thing you say is,

208
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,138
 ''Do you have a pressing comb?

209
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,205
 ''Do you have a flat iron?''

210
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,840
 And it's like, ''Oh, yeah!

211
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,642
 ''You know, we have everything.

212
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:32,144
 ''l can do whatever you need.''

213
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,779
 And then the process starts.

214
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,048
 The process starts,
 and it's a little tragic.

215
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,617
 If you don't
 understand black hair,

216
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,618
 you're afraid of it
 if you see it in its natural state.

217
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,156
 And you can't really see around it.

218
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,658
 They don't understand
 that it can change.

219
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,026
 ''Give me two days, baby.

220
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:51,027
 ''What you want?
 Long, short, black, blue, green?

221
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:53,131
 ''Little fan on the side?
 What hair do you look--

222
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:55,834
 ''Give me a picture, give me
 two days, I got you.''

223
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,269
 ls this your hair?

224
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,303
 Yes. All mine.

225
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,005
 - All your hair?
 - All mine.

226
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:02,107
 Shake it for me.

227
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,609
 I mean, how does this happen?

228
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,144
 What did you put in it?

229
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:09,145
 If you went under the counter
 in a black woman's bathroom,

230
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:13,717
 she's got about thirty
 or forty bottles of different things.

231
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:16,321
 She's always constantly
 trying out something,

232
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:19,322
 trying to perfect
 the solution, if you will.

233
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,426
 The antidote.

234
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:23,829
 The antidote. Yeah.

235
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,330
 Relaxer.

236
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,331
 The closest thing we have
 to a nap antidote.

237
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,735
 For all you white people out there
 that don't know what it is,

238
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:34,871
 you name a black woman,
 any black woman,

239
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,743
 no matter how famous
 or infamous,

240
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:39,678
 they've either
 had their hair relaxed,

241
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,679
 or they're having
 their hair relaxed right now.

242
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,751
 And a lot of black men, too.

243
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:48,752
 If your hair's relaxed,
 white people are relaxed.

244
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:52,057
 If your hair is nappy,
 they're not happy.

245
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:55,027
 So what's
 your definition of good hair?

246
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:58,028
 Something that looks
 relaxed and nice.

247
00:11:58,464 --> 00:11:59,931
 Yeah, relaxed and straight.

248
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:01,266
 Wow, what do you have there?

249
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,101
 ls that a bucket of relaxer?

250
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,236
 No doubt, baby.

251
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,304
 Relaxer.

252
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:09,305
 Also known by its government name,
 sodium hydroxide.

253
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:16,046
 Relaxer's the chemical that will
 take a black woman's hair from this...

254
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,550
 and change it into this.

255
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,121
 Wow.

256
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:25,891
 Look at it.

257
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:28,892
 My ring is still there.

258
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,029
 My fingers all there.

259
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,030
 I think I'm going to marry you.

260
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,169
 In fact,
 as far as hair products go,

261
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,105
 relaxer's the cash cow
 for the Bronner Brothers Hair Show.

262
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:43,106
 It's how black women have been
 getting their hair straight for decades.

263
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:47,045
 Vigorol Liquid Hair Relaxer.

264
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,046
 You're going to love your hair
 like you've never loved it,

265
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:52,818
 come rain or come shine.

266
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,152
 The first time I got a relaxer,

267
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:56,221
 I remember thinking,
 ''Wow, now I'm pretty.

268
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,990
 ''Now, I'm beautiful...

269
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,125
 ''or closer to it, at least.''

270
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:02,828
 Dark and Lovely
 Permanent Creme Relaxer.

271
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,497
 A beautiful way
 to relax your kind of hair.

272
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:08,498
 Mentally,
 I think a lot of black women,

273
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,534
 they're on this quest for
 attaining the straightest hair possible,

274
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:16,374
 trying to conform
 to a more European look.

275
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,243
 The straighter hair, the better.

276
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,244
 And we've been coached
 with that mentality since childhood.

277
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,517
 With Vigorol Hair Relaxer
 and a hot comb,

278
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:27,419
 you'll have your hands full.

279
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,121
 I remember seeing ads like this

280
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:32,122
 when I was a little kid
 watching ''Soul Train.''

281
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:34,693
 What the hell
 is relaxer anyway?

282
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:35,794
 Where does it come from?

283
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:38,795
 Well, some of it comes
 from Greensboro, North Carolina.

284
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:41,466
 This medium-size town

285
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,401
 was once the capital
 of the Confederacy.

286
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:45,737
 White will fight desegregation!

287
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,707
 But now it's the home
 of Dudley Products,

288
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,708
 a $35-million black-owned
 hair empire

289
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,713
 that employs thousands
 of people worldwide.

290
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,714
 Greensboro is the home
 of the Dudley Mansion,

291
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:01,918
 the Dudley Beauty School,

292
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,556
 Mr. Dudley himself,

293
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:07,557
 and, of course,
 Dudley Manufacturing.

294
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:16,099
 Dudley Products have been valued
 at up to $100 million.

295
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,771
 The plant itseIf is worth over ten.

296
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:21,406
 It employs hundreds of people

297
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,407
 and is situated
 on over 47,000 acres

298
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:27,579
 of prime North Carolina real estate.

299
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,580
 In short,
 Mr. Dudley is a nap impresario.

300
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,050
 Bad hair has been very good
 for Mr. Dudley.

301
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:35,787
 What's he doin'?

302
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,455
 Joe is making relaxer.

303
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,391
 This is how they make relaxer?

304
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:42,392
 This is a portion
 of a 7,000-pound batch of relaxer.

305
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,165
 7,000 pounds
 is worth how much?

306
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,935
 7,000 pounds,
 you're talking about $18,000.

307
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,137
 This would last Prince
 about a month.

308
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,838
 Exactly.

309
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,241
 The slightest
 little bit of these chemicals

310
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:57,442
 can really cause harm
 to the body.

311
00:14:57,443 --> 00:15:00,011
 A splash of sodium hydroxide
 in your eye

312
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,447
 can potentially lead to blindness.

313
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,848
 It may not happen right away,

314
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,483
 but it can lead to blindness
 later on in life.

315
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:06,818
 But you'll eventually
 have a dog.

316
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,087
 Yes, you will eventually have one.

317
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:12,088
 And the more
 of these chemicals you inhale

318
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,159
 as you continue to work in it,

319
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,160
 it can have
 an adverse affect on your body.

320
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,101
 Let me read some of these.

321
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:26,102
 ''The rate of change
 is controlled by what factors?

322
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:29,105
 Temperature, concentration,
 time, and pH.''

323
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:32,477
 Wow, what's that word?

324
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,312
 What? Ammonium thioglycolate?

325
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:35,614
 Wait. Say that again
 to the camera.

326
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,416
 Ammonium thioglycolate.

327
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:41,417
 You're smart.

328
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:43,788
 Enrollment at
 the Dudley School of Beauty

329
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:46,789
 means one thing:
 long nights poring over scalp theory.

330
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,127
 These budding hair scholars

331
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,863
 master the chemistry
 of Dudley products

332
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,798
 and how to use them
 on mannequins,

333
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,134
 even white mannequins.

334
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:58,370
 They are
 also tested on the finer points

335
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,939
 of how not to put relaxer
 in the eyes,

336
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,940
 how not to burn ears
 with hot combs,

337
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,610
 but most importantly,
 they learn

338
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,146
 that if you can make
 enough black women happy,

339
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:11,147
 you can live like a king.

340
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,486
 When you go back home,

341
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,755
 I want you to tell the world,

342
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:19,491
 we manufacture
 our own product,

343
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:22,492
 we sell our own product
 to our own, through our own.

344
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:26,863
 That's the reason why we will
 never sell our company.

345
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:32,702
 Because if I asked you
 to take off the clothes

346
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:35,507
 that you didn't buy
 from your race,

347
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:38,508
 it would be a nudist camp
 in here right now.

348
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,980
 The nudity thing
 was a little weird,

349
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:43,782
 but if you sniff
 enough chemicals,

350
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:45,517
 you just might say anything.

351
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,052
 But I've got to admit,

352
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,120
 looking at these
 proud black women

353
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,121
 just made me think
 about my daughters.

354
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,460
 So the next day,
 I got on a plane

355
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,296
 and went to meet the Dalai Lama
 of hair himself.

356
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:01,297
 Tell me, when was the first time
 you had relaxer in your hair?

357
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:04,769
 Late seventies.

358
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,770
 James Brown, who was like
 the father I've never had,

359
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,975
 was in his office one evening
 in Augusta, Georgia,

360
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,510
 and he said to me

361
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:15,180
 that he was real tight
 with the Republicans.

362
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:16,748
 And I said,
 ''Well, if you so tight,

363
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:19,617
 ''why don't you get us
 Martin Luther King's birthday

364
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,519
 ''a federal holiday?''

365
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,554
 He said, ''Get the White House
 on the phone.''

366
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:23,888
 I said, ''Oh, yeah, right.''

367
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,890
 But I told his secretary,
 ''Get the White House on the phone.''

368
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,058
 They left a message.

369
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,993
 Three hours later,
 to my surprise,

370
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:30,261
 the White House called back.

371
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:31,896
 He got on the phone

372
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:34,466
 and told them he wanted
 to come see President Reagan.

373
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,467
 So they agreed to meet
 on January 15th, '82.

374
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,671
 And l'll never forget, he said,

375
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:42,540
 ''When you go to the White House,
 I want you to look like me,

376
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,909
 '''cause when people see you,
 I want 'em to see me.

377
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,344
 ''You're a reflection of me.''

378
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:48,847
 He took me to a lady
 in Augusta named Mary.

379
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,616
 He said, ''l want you to style
 Rev's hair like mine.''

380
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:54,617
 But that's the day we went
 to the White House, right there.

381
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,423
 When was the first time
 you had a relaxer?

382
00:17:58,424 --> 00:17:59,724
 I was nine.

383
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:01,326
 I remember the exact day.

384
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:03,294
 And I was, like, ''Mama,
 I want to get my hair done.

385
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:04,562
 ''l want a relaxer.''

386
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,698
 And she was, like,
 ''What do you know about relaxers?''

387
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:08,800
 And I was, like,
 ''l want a relaxer.''

388
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:10,468
 At nine years old,
 I got my first relaxer

389
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:13,338
 and I remember it just being...

390
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:14,372
 it was like a miracle.

391
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:15,640
 I think you're trying to blend in.

392
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,009
 I think you're trying to make
 everybody comfortable.

393
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,177
 Relaxed.

394
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:20,378
 Relaxed and not, like,

395
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,213
 ''Oh, my God, what is that?''
 you know?

396
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:24,849
 That's what the relaxer does.
 It relaxes people.

397
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,218
 How old were you

398
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:30,219
 the first time you got a relaxer?

399
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:32,257
 Oh, God.

400
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:33,992
 I was about seventy.

401
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:35,827
 Seventy?

402
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,328
 You went your whole life?

403
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:40,329
 Not my whole life.
 I'm still alive.

404
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:45,635
 I relaxed my hair
 when I was in the tenth grade.

405
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,672
 And l'll tell you,
 when you was really gangster,

406
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:49,641
 you could show up in homeroom
 with rollers in your hair.

407
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:52,377
 And you had rank
 by how big the rollers were.

408
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:54,312
 Like, the yellow rollers
 were smaller,

409
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:55,547
 and they get bigger
 and bigger.

410
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:57,782
 The orange rollers
 meant you had more hair,

411
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:59,684
 so it was like,

412
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,653
 I actually got a mug shot
 some-damn-where

413
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:04,654
 with rollers in my hair.

414
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,560
 I have a relaxer.
 I am on the creamy crack.

415
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:10,395
 You call it ''creamy crack''?

416
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,197
 Because once you're on it,

417
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:15,198
 unfortunately, people tend to have
 a difficuIt time getting off of it.

418
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,670
 Creamy crack.

419
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:21,671
 So you're saying
 your hair's addicted to relaxer?

420
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:25,174
 It was. For a time, I was
 the first one at the beauty shop.

421
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:28,246
 I was like, ''l feel roots.

422
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,814
 ''Hook it up.''

423
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,216
 I don't know.

424
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:32,784
 I was taught by
 a lot of old hustlers.

425
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:34,285
 They said that the only way

426
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:35,954
 you could have
 a upper hand on a woman

427
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:38,955
 is to be flyer than her.

428
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,602
 Tell us about the first time
 you ever got...

429
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:51,636
 the process.
 - The cook-up?

430
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:54,637
 Yeah, the cook-up.

431
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,908
 You got to
 wash that out immediately.

432
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,244
 Soon as it starts to burn,

433
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:01,012
 you got to get
 to the sink immediately,

434
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,447
 or else you lose your hair.

435
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:05,448
 The burn of a perm is, I think,
 the most excruciating burn.

436
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:08,453
 I think it's hotter than fire.

437
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,954
 Especially the first time.

438
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:11,289
 I mean, the first time,

439
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,290
 you've never feIt like
 your whole skull is on fire,

440
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,729
 and why are you doing this?

441
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,730
 If you have maybe like a pimple
 or something in your scalp,

442
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,934
 and that stuff gets in,
 it'll start to burn.

443
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,171
 But usually if you're
 really trying to relax your hair,

444
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:29,107
 it's kind of like a torture session.

445
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,876
 It's like you want it to get
 as straight as possible,

446
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,111
 so you feel it burning,

447
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:34,546
 but you be like,
 ''Just a little longer.

448
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,314
 ''Just a little longer.
 A little bit longer.

449
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,348
 ''Wash it out!''

450
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:40,218
 Anybody here ever been shot?

451
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:41,819
 So what feIt worse,

452
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
 the bullet or the relaxer?

453
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:47,225
 Anybody here have a baby?

454
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:48,693
 What's more pain,

455
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:51,694
 a chemical burn or childbirth?

456
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,098
 Childbirth.

457
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:57,099
 But what if you had to have
 a bad perm for eight hours?

458
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:01,304
 I don't know.

459
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,841
 Where were you shot?

460
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:04,876
 In the face.

461
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:06,210
 You got shot in the face?

462
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:07,946
 That's a pretty bad shot.

463
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,148
 I was the first 50 Cent.

464
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,150
 Somebody just thought
 you was ugly?

465
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:13,451
 Could be.

466
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:16,452
 What's it feel like,
 the chemical burn?

467
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:17,622
 Can you explain it?

468
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:20,623
 Just like, you know,
 you're on fire, literally.

469
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:23,061
 You know,
 my head was just burning.

470
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:24,562
 The sensation was just horrible.

471
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:26,064
 lmmediately,
 I just began to cry.

472
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:27,165
 It was horrible.

473
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,901
 The burning of the skin,
 the stripping,

474
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:32,303
 you know,
 the oozing, the weeping,

475
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,439
 all the things
 that go along with stripping

476
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,440
 that superficial epidermis
 off the skin.

477
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:40,612
 You can get a burn,
 like scabs around your head,

478
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:42,146
 in the middle of your head.

479
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:44,616
 It's supposed to take
 the knottiness of your hair

480
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:47,617
 down to some thin, laid-back,
 Suave Bolla Dominica hair.

481
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:52,588
 But if you leave it in too long,
 you just get Negro nappy scab,

482
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,027
 left the Concolean too long,

483
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:58,730
 and you just are
 walking around twisted

484
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:00,698
 with scabs
 on the front of your head.

485
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:03,001
 That's how
 my asymmetrical thing came in.

486
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:04,168
 Oh, yeah?

487
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:07,005
 Remember when my sister
 did my hair?

488
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,674
 And then this whole side
 was burnt off.

489
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:11,442
 And then that's how the style

490
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:14,443
 of the asymmetrical look
 came in with Salt-n-Pepa.

491
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,580
 And I had to shave off
 one side of my hair,

492
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:20,518
 and that's how my hair fell out.

493
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,220
 I remember that.
 That was devastating.

494
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:23,855
 I was really hurt for you.

495
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,089
 In the ''Push It'' video.

496
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,090
 Right before that.

497
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:31,329
 'Cause in the ''Push it'' video,
 it's kind of--

498
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,031
 And then you were
 coloring it in with...

499
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:35,333
 With pencil.
 With brown pencil.

500
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:37,135
 I was coloring
 in those spots for you.

501
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:38,236
 I remember that.

502
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:39,303
 Can you imagine that?

503
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,305
 And she's coloring my hair
 with pencil,

504
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:44,306
 trying to cover the bald spots.

505
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:48,878
 So, I'm here with Professor Berry,
 well-renowned.

506
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:51,449
 Now, could you tell us

507
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,450
 exactly how dangerous
 sodium hydroxide is?

508
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:58,054
 Sodium hydroxide
 will burn through your skin.

509
00:22:58,457 --> 00:22:59,624
 The chicken is your skin.

510
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,625
 Okay. So it'll go from my brown skin
 down to the white meat.

511
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,064
 - Right.
 - Wow.

512
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:08,366
 Now, you realize
 this goes on people's heads, right?

513
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,467
 Sodium hydroxide?

514
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:12,468
 Yeah, black people,
 black women, some men--

515
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,573
 You know,
 Morris Day, Prince--

516
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:18,574
 put sodium hydroxide in their hair
 to straighten it out.

517
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:20,978
 Why would they do that?

518
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:22,346
 To look white.

519
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,515
 Probably what
 the sodium hydroxide is doing

520
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:26,751
 is actually breaking down
 the protein in their hair.

521
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:29,752
 If it gets down into the scalp,
 it'll kill it at the root,

522
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:33,157
 and you'll actually have
 bald spots there.

523
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:34,826
 If you're
 a beautician or something,

524
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:37,662
 and you deal
 in sodium hydroxide all day,

525
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:39,430
 - I mean...
 - I wouldn't do it.

526
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,431
 If you breathe just the fumes
 from sodium hydroxide,

527
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,469
 those fumes
 will ruin your lungs.

528
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,803
 They'll damage
 your lungs permanently.

529
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:47,004
 Wow.

530
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,005
 Now, this is
 an aluminum soft drink can,

531
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:54,777
 and it's been in sodium hydroxide
 for just over an hour.

532
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:58,750
 Another aluminum soft drink can

533
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:01,751
 that's been
 in for about three hours.

534
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,757
 And then this one
 has been in

535
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:08,758
 for out four hours.
 It has disintegrated.

536
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:11,462
 So that can's got a good perm.

537
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:14,463
 That can's got a good perm.

538
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:24,075
 Wow, you're a good girl.

539
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:25,109
 How old are you?

540
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,477
 Six.

541
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:29,478
 Six. Getting that perm.

542
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:33,415
 What's the youngest kid
 you ever done?

543
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,386
 Three.

544
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:36,888
 Three?

545
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:39,889
 How long you been getting
 your hair permed?

546
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,361
 This is your second perm, huh?

547
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:44,462
 No.

548
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:45,997
 How many have you gotten?

549
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:48,998
 I had the texturizer,
 and some of my hair fell out,

550
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:52,868
 and my mama started
 giving me some Kidee Perms.

551
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:58,607
 So your mama
 gave you Kidee Perms?

552
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,778
 I didn't even know
 they had Kidee Perms.

553
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,281
 Of course,
 they go to the drugstore

554
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:04,715
 and they see Kidee Perm.

555
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:07,716
 Well, a kidee perm is really
 the same as any aduIt perm.

556
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,453
 It's just milder.

557
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:12,123
 But it's still that same chemical,

558
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:14,926
 that hydroxide chemical
 that can be very damaging.

559
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:16,761
 It would be like a kiddie beer.

560
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:19,230
 Right.

561
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:22,231
 Does your hair
 blow in the wind?

562
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:25,267
 ls it cuter than
 the other girls at school?

563
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,771
 Really?

564
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:29,772
 Sometimes their hair be hanging
 down longer than mine.

565
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,010
 The other girls
 at school got perms, too?

566
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:36,011
 I mean, I have had mothers
 that are starting to give their girls,

567
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,884
 their little girls perms,

568
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:42,153
 and they're
 not even two years old yet.

569
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:44,589
 They're calling
 regarding consultation

570
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,458
 on, ''Dr. Maclin, what do
 you think that I should do?

571
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:50,061
 ''My daughter is one and a half,

572
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,897
 ''and it's tough
 for me to comb her hair.

573
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:54,899
 ''l'd really like to put a perm in.
 What do you think?''

574
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,301
 Under a certain age,
 the child is still growing,

575
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:58,803
 the scalp is still maturing,

576
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:00,171
 the follicles are still maturing.

577
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:03,040
 And if you're putting
 this chemical on too early,

578
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:06,041
 you're damaging
 your child's follicles almost for life.

579
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:10,246
 When was the first time
 you got a perm in Jaylin's hair?

580
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:15,453
 It was back in July, I think.

581
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:16,854
 How old was she?

582
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:19,790
 Three.
 She had turned three in June.

583
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,326
 Do you like gettin' perms?

584
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:24,362
 I got a little
 three-year-old, Zahra.

585
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:26,797
 She don't have a perm, though.
 Not yet.

586
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:27,865
 Should I get one for her?

587
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,767
 - Yes.
 - Okay.

588
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:32,069
 Why should Zahra get a perm?

589
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,205
 'Cause...

590
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:36,774
 she's supposed to get a perm.

591
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,276
 'Cause everybody's
 supposed to get a perm?

592
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:41,277
 - Yes.
 - Okay.

593
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:48,419
 When the time's right,
 I'm going to tell my daughters,

594
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,354
 ''Don't drink, don't smoke,

595
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:52,823
 ''and don't have babies
 till you're married.''

596
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,726
 Now I got to add,
 ''If you do have a baby,

597
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,795
 ''make sure you don't get her
 a Kidee Perm.''

598
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:00,796
 Wow.

599
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:09,238
 Now, it's five days till the show.

600
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:12,310
 What do you think you need
 to work on the most?

601
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:15,311
 Upside-down cuttin'.

602
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:22,820
 I'm hanging upside down
 from a bar,

603
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:25,821
 and I'm cutting one of
 my models' hair upside down.

604
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:27,558
 It's really hard.

605
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:30,559
 Oh, jeez.

606
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:33,164
 I'm scared.

607
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:35,733
 So are you going to try
 to cut in front of her face?

608
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,368
 Uh-uh. She going
 to have a spiked bob.

609
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,369
 Okay, so you ain't--
 That'll make it easy.

610
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:42,506
 That's what I was tellin' you.

611
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:45,507
 It takes you so long
 to catch on here.

612
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:48,112
 In order to do great things,
 you know,

613
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,581
 you have to have
 greatness inside you.

614
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:53,184
 I believe
 the greatness is Jesus Christ.

615
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:55,853
 Our talent level
 might be right there,

616
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:58,322
 but it's that favor
 and anointing that we have

617
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:01,323
 that take us over the top.

618
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:07,763
 Now...sacrifice.

619
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,633
 If you ain't never been there,
 you're about to go there.

620
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:10,935
 So let's get ready, okay?

621
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:13,871
 Sacrifice.
 We're going to start a fast

622
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:16,872
 starting midnight tonight,
 no sodas...all right?

623
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,644
 No juice. Water only.

624
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:23,080
 We're purifying ourselves, okay?

625
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,349
 No snacks. Water only.

626
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,385
 No food?

627
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:30,386
 Okay, first of all, hold on.

628
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,324
 You're not going to stand here
 and tell me

629
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,960
 what you are
 or not going to do, all right?

630
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:37,895
 Winners do one thing. Hold on.

631
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:40,896
 Winners do one thing--
 that's win. All right?

632
00:28:40,932 --> 00:28:42,900
 And we're going to make
 some sacrifices.

633
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:45,901
 I've sacrificed
 a lot for this show.

634
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:49,273
 That's something
 I really don't believe in.

635
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:50,307
 You're not a Christian?

636
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:53,308
 No.

637
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:04,353
 Wow, she's gettin'
 debris out your nose.

638
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:06,390
 You went to school for this?

639
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,926
 Yes.

640
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:11,662
 Now, what does the feet
 washin' do for you, Derek?

641
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:14,331
 I'm wearing
 a four-inch boot for the show.

642
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:15,533
 - A four-inch boot?
 - Correct.

643
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:18,402
 And so I need to make sure
 that my feet is right

644
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:21,403
 so they won't be all hurtin'
 after I get off that stage.

645
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:25,376
 'Cause people don't want
 to see me nasty,

646
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:27,378
 so this is just my ''me'' time.

647
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:30,379
 So can you
 describe your show?

648
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,950
 It's a real high-energy show.

649
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:40,191
 I chose the theme
 ''Battle of the Bands,''

650
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:41,859
 'cause it's a big thing
 here in Atlanta.

651
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,762
 It basically shows rivalry
 throughout the first part of the show.

652
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:47,198
 Then everyone that's
 in the show come together

653
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:49,467
 to do this whole number
 at the end of the show.

654
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:50,801
 A lot of people
 are on point this year.

655
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:53,304
 I just like glamorous, sexy hair.

656
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,706
 That's what people want.
 That's what men want to see.

657
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:58,707
 Now, what do you have to say
 to the competition right now?

658
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:01,745
 Just come correct.

659
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:03,481
 You know, that's all
 I can really say to them.

660
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:05,716
 Just come correct.
 That's why they got me at the end.

661
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,017
 'Cause they know
 what's about to happen.

662
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,052
 You the headliner?

663
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:10,821
 Yep. They just my openers.

664
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:13,822
 Can you tell us
 about this year's competition

665
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:19,061
 and what you have planned?

666
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:23,165
 Basically,
 I have planned a bar scene

667
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:26,435
 called the ''Aqua Bar.''

668
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:31,876
 My theme is,
 I play the owner of a bar,

669
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:34,877
 and I'm the hairstylist that works
 at the bar sometimes, so...

670
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:38,916
 two other ladies
 come in the bar

671
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,684
 and they have
 these hideous ponytails

672
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:41,886
 that somebody
 put on their heads.

673
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:43,521
 I talk her
 into getting a haircut.

674
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:46,522
 And I tell her I have to wet it,
 and she says, ''Water?''

675
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:49,160
 So then there's
 an aquarium at the back,

676
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:51,061
 so basically
 I throw her in the aquarium,

677
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:54,062
 and I jump in and cut her hair.

678
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,002
 So you're going to make it
 a little simpler this year by...

679
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:00,271
 I'm trying to make it simpler.

680
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:03,272
 By going underwater?

681
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
 How much time do you spend
 rehearsing for this show?

682
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:13,851
 I haven't rehearsed
 at all for this show.

683
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:16,852
 What I'm trying to do this year is
 a bit of an experiment.

684
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,955
 My theory is, if I can get
 into what makes women feel pretty

685
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:24,495
 or what makes women feel good,

686
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:26,297
 I can expand on that.

687
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:27,731
 So I'm trying
 something different this year

688
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,967
 for the hair competition.

689
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:31,135
 What are we seeing you
 for today, Jason?

690
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:34,136
 A little Restylane
 and a little Botox.

691
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:37,007
 A little bit of this
 and a little bit of that.

692
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:39,877
 - Fill this up.
 - Fill it up?

693
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:40,978
 Okay, we'll fill it up.

694
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:43,113
 Let's get you
 over here on the table.

695
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,482
 I got to psych myself up.

696
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:46,517
 You're going to do great.

697
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:48,752
 I can do this.
 I can do it.

698
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,120
 Good. Excellent.

699
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:51,555
 I wish we had a Botox

700
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:54,556
 with something similar
 to the python venom.

701
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:58,162
 It's actually botulism toxin.

702
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:00,965
 What is the main ingredient
 in this Restylane?

703
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:02,433
 Hyaluronic acid.

704
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:03,534
 Like I know that that is.

705
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:04,735
 I don't want to be
 too aggressive

706
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:06,604
 since this is
 your first treatment, okay?

707
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:09,605
 Some of the girls that come
 into the salon say they get this done,

708
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:12,376
 so I'm excited to--

709
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:15,112
 I think you will end up
 loving it.

710
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,348
 I'm pleased with the way
 everything is looking now.

711
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:19,283
 The redness
 and the swelling are normal.

712
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:22,284
 That will dissipate over
 the next several hours to 48 hours.

713
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:26,490
 I don't feel as beautiful
 as I had anticipated.

714
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:29,491
 lce the face
 over the next thirty minutes.

715
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:33,161
 I feel like I've been attacked
 by a thousand killer bees.

716
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:40,337
 We came up with a test,
 'cause human hair actually--

717
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:42,373
 usually has a little weight to it,
 so it bounces.

718
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:45,374
 So if you ladies mind
 jumping up for me,

719
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,978
 you can kind of see
 which one's real and which one's not.

720
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:49,546
 Bounces. Bounces.

721
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,949
 Just sitting there.

722
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,284
 Not doing anything.

723
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:56,220
 They always say,
 ''Diamonds are a girl's best friend.''

724
00:32:56,221 --> 00:32:58,022
 But diamonds better watch out,

725
00:32:58,023 --> 00:32:59,723
 because there's
 a new friend in town,

726
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,892
 and its name is weave.

727
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:04,828
 I don't remember
 the world without weaves.

728
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:07,264
 Back in your mother's day,
 there was wigs, right?

729
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:10,265
 The weave is like
 a graduation from the wig.

730
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:13,435
 At least a weave is
 like an extension of reality.

731
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:16,872
 Maybe her mother's mother
 was an lndian or something.

732
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:20,110
 It's about big hair today.
 I can't keep up.

733
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:23,111
 I'm like, ''Peps, you got to get
 this hair bigger, you know?''

734
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:25,416
 They just want
 a little fullness, a little thickness.

735
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,885
 They want their own hair,
 but with some drama.

736
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:29,720
 Like, they want to go like this.

737
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:32,289
 Like in the movies
 in the 1970s or something.

738
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,058
 Like Farrah Fawcett.

739
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,427
 Those images are stuck
 in everybody's head,

740
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:37,661
 and they ain't lettin' them go.

741
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,530
 Chicks be wantin' to be
 blonde or something.

742
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,099
 When I first started going
 to Extensions Plus,

743
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,701
 which is where
 I get my hair from in L.A.,

744
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,436
 they used to have
 a back entrance,

745
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:47,137
 and going in Extensions Plus

746
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:49,540
 was like a scene
 from a James Bond movie.

747
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,775
 You have dark glasses,

748
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:53,610
 and you pull up to the door
 and you run in,

749
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:56,413
 and it's like,
 ''Did anybody see me? Okay.''

750
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:58,115
 You know,
 when I started doing it,

751
00:33:58,116 --> 00:33:59,616
 women weren't
 as free to discuss,

752
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:00,884
 ''No, this is really my hair.''

753
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,454
 No, it's not. It's really not.

754
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:06,190
 So in the early days,
 everyone was lying?

755
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:07,358
 For the most part, yeah.

756
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,159
 Back in the day,
 a weave was kind of like

757
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,160
 you was in a secret weavy society,
 and it was like,

758
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:13,931
 we vow to weave together,

759
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:16,567
 and we have
 little special weave sayings.

760
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:18,669
 I don't know.
 It was like a special little world

761
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,170
 that literally I had white friends

762
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:23,171
 who were like,
 ''Your hair grew overnight!

763
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,377
 ''A foot!
 How did you do that?''

764
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:28,445
 I mean, like, you know,

765
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:30,214
 they used to have these dolls
 in the Toys ''R'' Us

766
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:31,782
 that you could make their hair grow
 by pushing a button.

767
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:32,816
 I swear to God,

768
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:33,917
 they think black people
 had a little button

769
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,819
 at the small of our back

770
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,321
 where you just pressed
 the button and the hair grows.

771
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:39,156
 Hair that grows,
 hair that goes

772
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:41,592
 To here, to there

773
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:44,128
 You know, it was considered
 our beauty secrets

774
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:45,162
 that we just don't discuss.

775
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:46,797
 And now it's like,

776
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:48,332
 women stop other women
 on the street,

777
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,434
 like, ''What kind of hair
 is that that you got?''

778
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:51,902
 And we share our secrets.

779
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:54,772
 The weave words
 and the weave culture,

780
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,039
 I wasn't in it for very long,

781
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,575
 but you have
 to get indoctrinated quick.

782
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,544
 So they teach you a lot.

783
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:02,513
 You know
 how you're in the desert,

784
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:05,514
 and you see, like,
 the tumbleweed going by,

785
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,884
 the scene in the movie?

786
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:08,986
 Well, if you're
 on 125th Street in Harlem,

787
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,987
 or Hillside Avenue
 in Jamaica, Queens, where I was,

788
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:13,891
 or any number of places
 in Brooklyn

789
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,993
 or Crenshaw or wherever
 you are in this country

790
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:17,428
 in a black neighborhood,

791
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,130
 occasionally you will see
 the tumbling tumbleweave

792
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:21,698
 blow down the street.

793
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:24,668
 It's a ball of hair
 that's flying out of a door

794
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:27,669
 after they have done the weave
 and swept up the hair.

795
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,207
 They sweep it outside,

796
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:33,208
 and it goes tumbling
 down the street.

797
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,479
 And I call it
 the tumbling tumbleweave.

798
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,547
 I love it.

799
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:39,548
 Every time I see it, I'm, like,
 there goes the tumbleweave.

800
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:43,821
 The tumbling tumbleweave.

801
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:45,589
 I think the horrific part
 of the hair

802
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,590
 was when I really started
 to find out, you know,

803
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,794
 what they was doing.

804
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:53,030
 You know, because
 it was a mystery early,

805
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:56,031
 and then I was like, ''Okay,
 if it's a wig, do they take it off?''

806
00:35:57,669 --> 00:35:58,869
 They're like, ''No.''

807
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,870
 How's it stay on? Glue?

808
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:03,674
 Sometimes, and they sew it.

809
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,709
 They sew it to what?

810
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,579
 Then I was getting
 more and more information and stuff.

811
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,347
 It was like a secret society,

812
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:13,348
 a hair society of what's
 really going on and stuff.

813
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:15,886
 It's very interesting.

814
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:17,421
 Do they have classes?

815
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:19,122
 I don't know, but I'm starting it.

816
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:22,092
 So you're like a weave scientist?

817
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:24,895
 Yeah, l'll note myself
 as a weave scientist.

818
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,896
 You're a weaveologist.

819
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,367
 So what's in your hair now?

820
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:31,835
 A few things.

821
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:34,836
 This hair, underneath the other hair,
 is thick hair.

822
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:37,774
 This is a weave right now.

823
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:40,377
 This is a weave.
 It's my edges and everything.

824
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:42,946
 I have pieces that are...

825
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:44,781
 ...kind of, like,
 you know, like, extensions.

826
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:47,251
 Right now,
 I have clips in my hair.

827
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:49,620
 - I've attached...
 - ...two pieces here because...

828
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:50,954
 - I want a little more...
 - ...fullness.

829
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,322
 Mine is all one unit.

830
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:54,258
 Like that.

831
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:55,592
 Oh, God.

832
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:57,861
 It's like Dr. Frankenstein.

833
00:36:57,862 --> 00:37:00,862
 ''It lives! It lives!''

834
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,501
 There are a couple
 different ways of doing it.

835
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:07,037
 You could do tracks,
 where you just take a cornrow,

836
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:10,038
 and you attach the track
 onto the braid and sew.

837
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,176
 It you have a full weave
 like myself,

838
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,746
 my entire hair is braided up,

839
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:18,747
 and then there's a very thin net
 that protects my hair,

840
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:22,851
 and then the tracks
 are actually braided onto the net.

841
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:25,989
 The thing
 about a successful weave,

842
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,791
 and as we say in our industry,

843
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,227
 ''You got to know your weaver.''

844
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,662
 Know your weaver, baby,

845
00:37:31,663 --> 00:37:33,530
 'cause you got to be able
 to do it and cut it.

846
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,799
 She's got to know
 what she's doing, right?

847
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,268
 I'm from New York,
 but I live in Colorado.

848
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:41,269
 You flew from Colorado
 to New York?

849
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,941
 Yep, to get my hair done.
 Yes, I did.

850
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:45,142
 How long is the flight?

851
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:47,411
 The flight is 3 1/2 hours.

852
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:49,279
 There should be
 a weave airline.

853
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,715
 Sometimes you got
 a long flight,

854
00:37:51,716 --> 00:37:54,017
 and you want to pass the time.

855
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:57,018
 If you could get your hair done
 on the flight...

856
00:37:57,422 --> 00:37:58,956
 Would you take that airline?

857
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:00,424
 Yes, I would.

858
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:03,360
 Every black woman in the country
 would take that airline.

859
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:06,361
 And when you land,
 your hair's done.

860
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,200
 Depending
 on who your hairdresser is,

861
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:13,201
 I mean, I've been in the chair
 for six to eight hours.

862
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:15,672
 Black men have to become
 very, very patient.

863
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:16,840
 It's like jail.

864
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:19,643
 And I remember it took
 a good five hours.

865
00:38:19,644 --> 00:38:21,578
 It was a very intricate piece,

866
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:23,046
 and I was very particular.

867
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,615
 I don't like weaves
 that you can see the tracks.

868
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:26,516
 I don't like weaves
 where it looks like weaves.

869
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:28,552
 I don't like hair
 that looks like that waxy hair.

870
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:30,187
 If it looks waxy,
 it needs to look shiny,

871
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:31,221
 'cause you put grease in it,

872
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:34,222
 not because there's
 extra pieces of plastic in it.

873
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,693
 I'm very particular
 about my hair.

874
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:37,961
 Okay.

875
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:39,496
 I get serious, right?

876
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,365
 You're really serious
 about your weave.

877
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:43,367
 I love my weave.
 I do. I love it.

878
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:45,068
 I embrace it, yes.

879
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:46,570
 Do you have a pet name
 for your weave?

880
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:49,571
 No! Money.
 Bitch costs money.

881
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,041
 I paid a lot of money for this,
 but this is an investment.

882
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:56,678
 The black hair business
 is a $9 billion business.

883
00:38:57,148 --> 00:39:00,148
 Sixty percent to seventy percent
 of the business is the weave hair alone.

884
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:04,187
 The margin is 125째/째, 150째/째.

885
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,722
 How much is this hair?

886
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:07,491
 $1,000.

887
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:09,826
 $1,000. For just the weave
 or the weave--

888
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:11,528
 Just the weave, not the hair.

889
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:12,729
 The hair was more.

890
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,264
 Let me tell you,
 them prices can go up.

891
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:16,366
 One of these
 can run you $5,000.

892
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:18,435
 I'm famous
 for switching out my weaves

893
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:20,837
 once every month
 'cause I get bored.

894
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:22,873
 ls that $18,000 for the year?

895
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:24,574
 Yeah, about that.

896
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:26,977
 - Throughout her whole life?
 - Oh, my God!

897
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,311
 Probably about 150,000.

898
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:30,847
 Over. Oh, yeah, about that.

899
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,716
 I change my mind a lot.

900
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:33,950
 So some people
 have a wine cellar.

901
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:35,452
 You have a weave cellar.

902
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:38,088
 1998, this was
 a good year for weaves.

903
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:39,690
 How much does this cost?

904
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:40,757
 That's $1,000.

905
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:41,825
 This is $1,000?

906
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:43,560
 Yes, it is.

907
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,729
 You come in--
 It's a maintenance.

908
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,898
 You got to come in
 every two weeks or once a week

909
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:49,266
 for wash and condition

910
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:52,267
 and every six weeks,
 you have to get it retightened.

911
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:55,138
 Wow. This is amazing.
 $1,000.

912
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,441
 Yes. It starts at $1,000.

913
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:59,142
 It starts?
 So, how high--

914
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,911
 You can go as far as 3,500.

915
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:03,714
 - $3,500?
 - Yes, yes.

916
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:04,781
 And who's payin' for this?

917
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:06,817
 Ladies, workin' people.

918
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:07,951
 Black women?

919
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:10,952
 Black women,
 everyday people that are working

920
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:14,091
 and want to look good
 and look as natural as possible.

921
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:16,159
 She's wearing
 a hair unit over there.

922
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,694
 You? How much did you pay?

923
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:18,895
 1,000.

924
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:20,997
 You paid $1,000?

925
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:22,833
 And those two ladies
 in the back over there.

926
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:25,834
 A question.
 Where do you work?

927
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:28,839
 I have my own business.
 Child care.

928
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,474
 Child care, okay.

929
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:33,009
 And you spent $1,000?

930
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,811
 And it's worth it.

931
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,113
 She's wearing one.

932
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:38,882
 Yours cost $1,000, too?
 Where do you work?

933
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:40,784
 I'm a schoolteacher,
 and I'm a grad student.

934
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:43,785
 Wait a minute. Schoolteachers
 don't make no money.

935
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:47,722
 And this lady, she's getting hers
 for the first time today.

936
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,392
 You're getting
 your first $1,000 weave today?

937
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:51,394
 - I am.
 - Wow.

938
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:53,697
 But I raised the kids already,
 so it's my turn now.

939
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:55,699
 - It's your turn for the weave.
 - That's right.

940
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,001
 Good for you. $1,000.

941
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:00,537
 People don't realize
 how much money is in this.

942
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:03,373
 It just seems
 that your clientele

943
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:06,374
 is more hooked to this than,
 say, cocaine because...

944
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:09,212
 Well, l'll tell you,

945
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:11,214
 once they start,
 they won't go back.

946
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:12,816
 They won't go back.

947
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:15,817
 She's been gettin'
 weaves for ten years.

948
00:41:16,154 --> 00:41:19,154
 If she had a drug habit,
 she would've went to rehab by now.

949
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,824
 You know, even a bad drug addict
 got periods of sobriety.

950
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:26,329
 The weave is going to
 put you in situations

951
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,064
 that you don't want to be in.

952
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:29,432
 Yes.

953
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,801
 You going to have to date men
 you don't want to date

954
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:31,835
 just 'cause you hungry.

955
00:41:31,836 --> 00:41:33,136
 'Cause our hair's
 got to be weaved.

956
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:34,938
 'Cause you got to pay
 the money on this weave.

957
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:37,874
 The problem is
 when it becomes something

958
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,142
 that's beyond your means,

959
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:42,112
 and we buy what we want
 rather than what we need.

960
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:43,780
 And I tell women all the time,

961
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:46,781
 ''What do you have
 a $1,000 weave on for

962
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:49,619
 ''and don't have food
 in the house for the kids?''

963
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,787
 It just doesn't make sense.

964
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:53,590
 How does the average girl
 pay for this?

965
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:55,559
 I have no idea.

966
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,327
 I think about that all the time.

967
00:41:57,328 --> 00:41:59,229
 Like, what would I do

968
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,765
 if I didn't make
 the money that I have?

969
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:04,766
 I guess l'd--l have no idea.

970
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:16,780
 Are you payin' for this?

971
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:18,381
 I'm paying for it right now.

972
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:21,382
 Okay. Right now?

973
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:24,354
 You've had a man handle
 this expense before?

974
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:25,722
 Yes.

975
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:28,491
 Any of you guys
 ever been pressured into,

976
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:30,493
 you know, giving
 a woman some money

977
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:33,494
 because of an expensive weave?

978
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:36,099
 My mother and daughter.

979
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,934
 Mother and daughter?

980
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:40,770
 So you're spend on weaves--

981
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:43,306
 These weaves
 are hurtin' your pocket?

982
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:45,008
 A woman wants to look good,

983
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:48,009
 and a man is going to
 find money up under a rock

984
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:51,479
 so that she can be pleased
 by getting her hair done.

985
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,817
 Now, those are the facts.

986
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:56,818
 Well, I have a layaway plan
 on my hair units.

987
00:42:57,622 --> 00:42:59,256
 So you can layaway
 the weave?

988
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,157
 That's right.
 I have a layaway plan.

989
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:02,626
 This lady right now,

990
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:05,495
 in about another month or so,
 she's gettin' a new one.

991
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:08,496
 She already start payin'
 for her next weave.

992
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,534
 The price of maintaining a woman

993
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:14,535
 is like real estate
 in New York City.

994
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:16,773
 It's skyrocketing.

995
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:18,375
 It's beyond out of hand.

996
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:21,111
 One trip to the hairdresser,
 or the weaveologist,

997
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:22,979
 could leave you bankrupt.

998
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,980
 Do you think some of the men
 are being asked to subsidize

999
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:30,084
 this weave habit,
 and it's creating

1000
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:33,490
 an animosity
 in the community?

1001
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:35,358
 Oh, it definitely
 can create animosity.

1002
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,359
 I mean, it's one thing for me
 to subsidize your living,

1003
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:42,096
 or subsidize your education

1004
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,335
 if you're young and I'm young
 and you're in school,

1005
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:48,204
 or I'm going to help you
 with your kids even.

1006
00:43:48,205 --> 00:43:49,940
 But to subsidize your weave?

1007
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:52,941
 I mean, hard enough
 for me to get a job,

1008
00:43:53,411 --> 00:43:55,312
 hard enough to go
 through school and get something,

1009
00:43:55,313 --> 00:43:58,313
 and you don't want me to help you
 with education, children, Mama,

1010
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:03,386
 401K, none of that.

1011
00:44:03,387 --> 00:44:05,822
 Your weave.
 You want me to go to work

1012
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:08,823
 and invest
 in you puttin' some hair

1013
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:10,293
 on the back of your head
 that ain't yours.

1014
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:12,529
 I mean, I can't even write it off
 on my income tax.

1015
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,530
 Maybe I should have, as part
 of my dependents, your weave.

1016
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,969
 'Cause your weave costs
 as much as some children.

1017
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,503
 That's ridiculous.

1018
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:23,504
 As you can see, the hair business
 can be cutthroat.

1019
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:25,875
 So far I've learned
 that good hair

1020
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,277
 could put you
 in the poorhouse,

1021
00:44:27,278 --> 00:44:30,278
 and if you're not careful,
 it could burn down your house.

1022
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:34,082
 Back in Atlanta, the hair show battle
 was coming together,

1023
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:37,452
 and I was wondering
 how our contestants were holding up.

1024
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:40,455
 Okay...we're going to see
 your first rehearsal on this stage.

1025
00:44:41,826 --> 00:44:43,093
 We have a problem.

1026
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:44,260
 What's the problem?

1027
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:46,096
 This stage is double the size
 it was last year.

1028
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:48,098
 This is some bullshit.

1029
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,066
 This really is, though.

1030
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:51,668
 There's no way that y'all
 going to be able to make it

1031
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:53,470
 all the way
 down this damn stage.

1032
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:54,904
 I can't work with this.

1033
00:44:54,905 --> 00:44:57,774
 This stage is double
 the fuckin' size it was last year.

1034
00:44:57,775 --> 00:44:59,275
 This is some bullshit.

1035
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:02,112
 Whose job was it to get you
 the measurements of the stage?

1036
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:04,047
 Bronner Brothers. I don't
 have the right measurements.

1037
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:07,048
 I don't have rules.
 I don't have shit.

1038
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:12,787
 Derek, he said he didn't
 get the dimensions of the stage.

1039
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:14,324
 Oh, really?

1040
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:15,825
 Did you know
 the dimensions of the stage?

1041
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:18,728
 Yes, I got it in my packet.

1042
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:21,031
 Are you nervous?

1043
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:22,198
 No, just anxious.

1044
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:24,167
 - Just anxious?
 - Yeah.

1045
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:27,168
 Llke ''anxious,'' you getting ready
 to kick somebody's ass?

1046
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:28,938
 - Well, yeah.
 - Okay.

1047
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:31,241
 How was it, Tanya?

1048
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:32,275
 It was fine.

1049
00:45:32,276 --> 00:45:34,177
 Leah, pay attention. Shit.

1050
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:36,646
 It's plugged up.
 He already did.

1051
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:38,281
 It's plugged up.

1052
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:40,250
 It's on the cord.

1053
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:43,251
 We kind of ran
 into every...mishap

1054
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:45,288
 you can possibly have.

1055
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:47,157
 It all had something
 to do with the show.

1056
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:49,192
 What we got,
 ten minutes left now?

1057
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:51,027
 Guys, come on!

1058
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:52,262
 You name it, it happened.

1059
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,197
 Lord Jesus, help me.

1060
00:45:54,198 --> 00:45:55,832
 I just know this is our destiny.

1061
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,400
 You know what I'm saying?

1062
00:45:57,401 --> 00:46:00,103
 Through my prayers,
 through the vision that God gave me.

1063
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:02,038
 And I said,
 ''The next time it would be you.''

1064
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:05,039
 Did I not say that?

1065
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:15,116
 Jason, everybody's rehearsin'.

1066
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:17,320
 Everybody's rehearsin'.
 That's right.

1067
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:18,655
 Except you.

1068
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:20,857
 You're the only one.

1069
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:23,593
 Yet, you're the favorite.

1070
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,361
 I just can't see
 why I'm the favorite.

1071
00:46:25,362 --> 00:46:27,464
 I mean...

1072
00:46:27,465 --> 00:46:28,798
 Are you worried?

1073
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:30,266
 - No.
 - You're not worried?

1074
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,535
 Like I said,
 I would love to win,

1075
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:34,871
 but, you know,
 whatever happens happens,

1076
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:36,639
 and I'm excited either way.

1077
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,241
 And no rehearsal?

1078
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:39,342
 And no rehearsal.

1079
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:41,044
 But we're going to look good.

1080
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:42,378
 Okay.

1081
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,379
 Lookin' good
 is haIf of the battle.

1082
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:49,352
 It may be all about
 looking good for Jason

1083
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:51,554
 and the other hair show
 contestants,

1084
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:54,555
 but it's all about cash
 for the 1,800 hair booth vendors.

1085
00:46:57,828 --> 00:47:00,828
 You guys are heads of the Black Owned
 Beauty Supplier Association.

1086
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:05,668
 Most of the black manufacturers

1087
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:07,704
 have sold their companies
 to the various companies

1088
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:09,539
 like Revlon and L'Or챕al.

1089
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,540
 Do black people
 own anything in this room?

1090
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,445
 We have a cluster
 of black manufacturers.

1091
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:17,614
 And these two rows
 and this row here

1092
00:47:17,615 --> 00:47:19,849
 and this row here
 are all black entrepreneurs,

1093
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,417
 black manufacturers.

1094
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:23,019
 So of this whole convention,

1095
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,988
 only two rows are
 owned by black people,

1096
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:26,289
 but most of this is white?

1097
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,758
 Most of it is, I think, Asian.

1098
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:30,927
 - Asian?
 - Right.

1099
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:32,529
 Most of the black hair money
 is made by Asians.

1100
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,563
 Right, correct.

1101
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:36,564
 ls it hard for black people
 to get in the black hair business?

1102
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:38,635
 Yes, it is very hard

1103
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:40,937
 for African Americans
 to get into the hair business.

1104
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:43,306
 The Koreans have dominated
 the manufacturing,

1105
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:45,875
 and they also dominate
 the retail level.

1106
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:48,411
 Koreans only sell
 to Korean retailers,

1107
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:51,314
 but because
 the profit margin is so large,

1108
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:53,283
 they will not sell
 to other African Americans.

1109
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:54,984
 Are you Korean?

1110
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:56,452
 No, I am Chinese.

1111
00:47:56,453 --> 00:47:57,487
 Chinese, sorry.

1112
00:47:57,488 --> 00:47:59,189
 That's okay.

1113
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,190
 Are Chinese people in China
 buying any black hair?

1114
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:05,628
 We would like to.

1115
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:07,297
 And second,
 we're not Chinese.

1116
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:08,631
 We are Korean.

1117
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:10,099
 Korean. Sorry.

1118
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,969
 lmagine if I went
 into another community

1119
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,970
 and just set up shop selling them
 what only they use.

1120
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:19,075
 The question would be
 whether they'd call the cops

1121
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:20,176
 or whether
 they'd just shoot me.

1122
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:23,079
 But in our community,
 anything goes.

1123
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,882
 And I think that a lot of that,
 we got to blame on ourselves.

1124
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:28,883
 I mean, it's not like anybody else
 needs black hair products,

1125
00:48:30,254 --> 00:48:33,254
 so if we can't control
 what nobody uses but us,

1126
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:37,658
 that is
 real economic retardation.

1127
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:41,464
 How many
 other black hair companies

1128
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:43,299
 do you know of
 that are black-owned?

1129
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,168
 That manufacture
 their own products?

1130
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:46,402
 That manufacture
 their own products.

1131
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:48,671
 About four.

1132
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:50,106
 Out of hundreds.

1133
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:52,742
 So did the white man just buy up
 everybody else's company?

1134
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:54,444
 Yeah. Yep.

1135
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:57,445
 In 1987, Revlon's president,

1136
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:01,351
 he said, ''Eventually
 there are not going to be

1137
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:02,752
 ''any black-owned
 hair care companies.''

1138
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:04,988
 And then you could see
 the gradual takeover

1139
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:07,423
 through the late eighties
 into the nineties,

1140
00:49:07,424 --> 00:49:09,626
 and now
 very few of the companies

1141
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:12,627
 that market to African Americans
 are black-owned.

1142
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:16,399
 No wonder the schools
 and everything else is out of control.

1143
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,400
 I mean, you get up
 and comb your oppression

1144
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:21,137
 and exploitation every morning.

1145
00:49:21,138 --> 00:49:24,138
 Or you attach
 your economic exploitation

1146
00:49:25,242 --> 00:49:27,143
 to the back of your head
 every morning.

1147
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:30,013
 Or you shove it down
 or you put it on the nightstand.

1148
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:32,615
 ''Here's my symbol
 of economic exploitation.''

1149
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:34,083
 Lights out, go to sleep,

1150
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:36,586
 wake up,
 and cover it back up.

1151
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:37,787
 How are you going to think right

1152
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:40,256
 when you're wearing
 exploitation all the time?

1153
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:42,425
 That is a real grassroots need,

1154
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:45,426
 to recapture the fact
 that we can't control something

1155
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,965
 as close to us
 as the hair on our head.

1156
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:50,300
 People are complaining

1157
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:52,935
 that black people aren't making
 any money off this hair,

1158
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:55,936
 but the truth is,
 it's not our hair.

1159
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:59,373
 When and if my daughters
 ever decide to buy hair,

1160
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:02,443
 it can come
 from anyplace in the world.

1161
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:05,579
 What kind of hair
 is the ponytail?

1162
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:08,785
 I guess it
 would be considered--

1163
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:11,754
 It's called ''human'' on the pack.

1164
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:13,189
 What kind of hair is in there?

1165
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,357
 Oh, my God. I didn't know

1166
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:15,858
 you were going to ask
 all these questions.

1167
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:18,859
 I would've called the lady
 that I bought it from.

1168
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,532
 This is 100째/째 human hair.

1169
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:24,367
 Meaning that you can curl it,

1170
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:25,902
 do whatever,
 and it won't melt.

1171
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:27,904
 This is 100째/째 real, baby.

1172
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:29,739
 So do you have any idea

1173
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,740
 what nationality
 these humans were?

1174
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:36,412
 What part of the world
 these humans come from?

1175
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,348
 Yes, lndian humans.

1176
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:39,649
 Janet Jackson's hair
 is lndian hair?

1177
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:40,883
 It's lndian hair.

1178
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:42,452
 Who else got lndian hair?

1179
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:44,320
 Right now, I have lndian hair.

1180
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:47,321
 It's human hair, though,
 and it's prayed upon.

1181
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:49,459
 Are you thinking--
 Are you considering--

1182
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,228
 I see Jessica Simpson
 has her own weave line.

1183
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:55,229
 Have you looked into having
 your own weave line?

1184
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:58,334
 So there's a chance
 you may join the weave empire?

1185
00:50:58,335 --> 00:50:59,535
 I don't know.

1186
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:01,738
 It depends on if I can get
 a straight connection to lndia.

1187
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:04,739
 Then I will, yeah.

1188
00:51:04,742 --> 00:51:06,376
 You heard what Raven said.

1189
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:08,411
 ''A straight connection
 to lndia.''

1190
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:11,412
 Well, I guess
 that's where I got to go.

1191
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,660
 This is lndia,
 a land with a population

1192
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:26,929
 of over one billion people.

1193
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,930
 A quarter of the population
 lives below the poverty line,

1194
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:32,235
 making about forty cents a day.

1195
00:51:32,236 --> 00:51:35,236
 Good thing
 they don't need weaves.

1196
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,340
 Overpopulation is at the root
 of much of lndia's problems,

1197
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:41,444
 but there would be
 even less room

1198
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:44,180
 if the lndians didn't
 ship out most of their hair.

1199
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:47,181
 After software and statues
 with eighty pairs of hands,

1200
00:51:47,418 --> 00:51:50,418
 human hair
 is lndia's biggest export.

1201
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:15,309
 My cab driver, Sanji, said
 if I wanted to find good hair,

1202
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:19,246
 this was the place to go.

1203
00:52:21,852 --> 00:52:23,252
 All right.

1204
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:24,387
 Mr. Murali!

1205
00:52:24,388 --> 00:52:25,421
 Hello, how are you?

1206
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:27,089
 All right. Chris Rock here.

1207
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,425
 - All the way from America.
 - Yeah, very good.

1208
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:30,726
 You are welcome to all this.

1209
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,829
 Now, I hear you the man
 with the hair.

1210
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:33,863
 Yes.

1211
00:52:33,864 --> 00:52:35,164
 You got
 more hair than anybody.

1212
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:36,199
 Yes.

1213
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,200
 If I want some lndian hair,
 you're the man to see.

1214
00:52:39,336 --> 00:52:41,571
 Yes.

1215
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:43,573
 This is daily,
 we are getting like this.

1216
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:46,342
 Collected from the temple.

1217
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:47,543
 Well, show me some more.

1218
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:50,544
 - Let's see some more.
 - Yes. Come.

1219
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:54,250
 What are they doing right now?

1220
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:57,251
 Now, this is the hair
 we have bought from the temple,

1221
00:52:57,387 --> 00:52:59,489
 and they're
 just segregating this thing.

1222
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:02,490
 And this is before washing,
 we do like this.

1223
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:05,261
 Then we go for a washing.

1224
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:06,696
 Because there'll be some bugs.

1225
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:09,065
 It is all dead bugs
 but some people,

1226
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:11,400
 they don't like to have
 lice and bugs in their hair.

1227
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:12,635
 Yeah, I don't.

1228
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:15,636
 Whenever I buy hair,
 I don't want no bugs in it.

1229
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:30,086
 This is the place
 where we process human hair.

1230
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:31,821
 Weave paradise.

1231
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:32,922
 Yes.

1232
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:35,923
 So this is where
 the magic happens, huh?

1233
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,560
 And everyone's got
 a perfect weave on their head.

1234
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:42,632
 What are they doing right there?

1235
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:43,900
 See, this is what I mean.

1236
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:45,067
 I show you
 that after washing,

1237
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,770
 they'll just put the hair
 on the hackle,

1238
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:49,572
 there to remove this tangle,

1239
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:52,241
 and they'll remove
 the top-side of the hair.

1240
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:55,242
 So then it will be bundled,
 and it will be sold as bulk hair.

1241
00:53:55,612 --> 00:53:57,513
 Okay.

1242
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:59,515
 Approximately
 how many heads of hair

1243
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:00,583
 are processed every day?

1244
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:02,818
 - Not that, weight.
 - Kilos?

1245
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:03,886
 So you don't even
 care about the head.

1246
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,087
 You measure by the kilo.

1247
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:06,522
 We measure by kilo only.

1248
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:08,291
 You like Scarface. ''Keys.''

1249
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:09,692
 Kind of like cocaine.

1250
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:12,295
 The hair business is probably
 an easier business to be in.

1251
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:15,296
 - Yes, it is a legal one.
 - It's legal.

1252
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,667
 Are there hair farms?

1253
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:19,302
 Are there just places

1254
00:54:19,303 --> 00:54:21,571
 where just a bunch of women
 are sitting there growing hair?

1255
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:22,738
 No.

1256
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:25,408
 Everything's from sacrifice.
 Tonsure.

1257
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:26,776
 Everything's from the sacrifice.

1258
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:29,645
 Do your other friends
 sacrifice their hair, too?

1259
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:31,447
 Yeah. Everybody does.

1260
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:32,715
 Everybody does it.

1261
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:34,483
 I guess nobody in lndia
 buys hair.

1262
00:54:34,484 --> 00:54:36,352
 Why? We already have
 our own hair.

1263
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:39,353
 It's like fish buyin' water.

1264
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:41,691
 Has anybody ever tried
 to steal your hair?

1265
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:43,326
 No. Not yet.

1266
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:45,394
 If you see some black women,
 just run the other way.

1267
00:54:45,395 --> 00:54:46,429
 Okay.

1268
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:49,430
 Now, there seems to be
 a great demand

1269
00:54:49,466 --> 00:54:52,466
 for the hair all over the world.

1270
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:56,038
 Can the temple satisfy
 all the demand,

1271
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:59,039
 or do people find other ways
 to get the hair?

1272
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,754
 So let me get this straight.

1273
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:13,923
 Women fall asleep,

1274
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:16,692
 and while they're asleep,
 someone...

1275
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:17,760
 Trimming their hair.

1276
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:19,128
 Takes their hair.

1277
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:22,129
 Does this happen a lot?

1278
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:29,905
 Somebody is cutting hair.

1279
00:55:29,906 --> 00:55:32,408
 So you go see ''l Am Legend,''

1280
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:35,409
 and when you leave,
 you go, ''l am bald.''

1281
00:55:48,992 --> 00:55:50,760
 Hair is worth more than gold?

1282
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:51,861
 Yes.

1283
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:54,862
 And women are being scalped
 to get this hair.

1284
00:55:57,734 --> 00:56:00,136
 Ten inches and better?

1285
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:01,470
 It's like porno.

1286
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:04,206
 Tell me.

1287
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:05,474
 l'd learned that this good hair

1288
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:08,411
 came from a religious ceremony
 called ''tonsure.''

1289
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:11,412
 And that's what I needed to see,
 the tonsure ceremony.

1290
00:56:11,815 --> 00:56:14,750
 If my daughters were going
 to eventually wear this hair,

1291
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:17,751
 I needed to see what kind of
 person's head it had been on first.

1292
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:37,404
 Over ten million people
 tonsure their hair every year.

1293
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:42,342
 They tonsure their hair in exchange
 for the gods' blessings.

1294
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,460
 Why do you tonsure your hair?

1295
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:07,267
 You ever think about your hair?

1296
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,740
 Thinkin' about seeing it again
 on somebody else?

1297
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:17,244
 - God likes hair?
 - Yeah.

1298
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:24,687
 Tonsure.

1299
00:57:24,688 --> 00:57:27,323
 That's the word
 we keep hearin'. Tonsure.

1300
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:29,859
 Eighty-five percent
 of lndia's population

1301
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,860
 have had their hair shaved
 at least twice in a lifetime

1302
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:36,296
 in a religious ceremony
 known as tonsure.

1303
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:39,435
 In lndia,
 hair is considered a vanity

1304
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:42,436
 and removing hair is considered
 an act of self-sacrifice.

1305
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:15,271
 By the end of the night,

1306
00:58:15,272 --> 00:58:17,606
 these pretty young girls
 will be baldheaded.

1307
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:19,308
 And in a few weeks,

1308
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:21,644
 their hair will be
 on the heads of doctors,

1309
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:24,645
 lawyers, and even strippers
 swinging off of poles.

1310
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:28,551
 These people have no idea
 where their hair's going

1311
00:58:28,552 --> 00:58:30,286
 or how much it's worth.

1312
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:33,287
 The money made at this temple
 is second only to the Vatican.

1313
00:58:33,824 --> 00:58:36,725
 The hair collected here
 is auctioned off to exporters

1314
00:58:36,726 --> 00:58:39,726
 who distribute it
 around the planet.

1315
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:41,831
 But its chief destination

1316
00:58:41,832 --> 00:58:44,832
 is the weave capital
 of the world, Los Angeles.

1317
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:09,425
 - Vijay!
 - Hey.

1318
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:10,459
 How's it goin', man?

1319
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,727
 Good. How are you?

1320
00:59:11,728 --> 00:59:13,229
 - Can't wait to see what you got.
 - Oh, yes.

1321
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,230
 All right, let's go in.

1322
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:18,000
 Now, Vijay.

1323
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:20,169
 How much money worth of hair

1324
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,503
 do you have
 in that bag right now?

1325
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:24,206
 Roughly about
 $10,000 to $15,000.

1326
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:26,909
 - $15,000 worth of hair?
 - Yeah.

1327
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,677
 Have you ever been robbed?

1328
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:31,513
 No. Luckily, no.
 Touch wood.

1329
00:59:31,514 --> 00:59:32,948
 All right.

1330
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:34,383
 Do you have security?

1331
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:36,585
 No. The security
 is it's a suitcase,

1332
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:39,586
 and they think it's clothes,
 and I'm a tourist.

1333
00:59:39,856 --> 00:59:41,090
 I need, uh...

1334
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:43,659
 the auburn shades
 or the natural black?

1335
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,894
 The natural black.

1336
00:59:44,895 --> 00:59:47,463
 And I need, like, 14 to 16 inch.

1337
00:59:47,464 --> 00:59:50,464
 Now, what are you lookin' for
 when you go through the hair?

1338
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:53,767
 Well, one, I look to make sure
 that the ends are not so frayed.

1339
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:55,371
 You know what I mean?

1340
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:58,372
 I look to make sure that when I run
 my hands through it that it's silky.

1341
00:59:59,242 --> 01:00:02,242
 Okay. Now,
 is this your first stop today?

1342
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:05,014
 Yes.
 Today, it's my first shop.

1343
01:00:05,015 --> 01:00:07,449
 So you get it first?

1344
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,852
 Beverly Hills gets it first?

1345
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:12,853
 So you start here
 and then you go to Compton?

1346
01:00:13,256 --> 01:00:14,790
 It's not quite like that, Rock.

1347
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:17,791
 Everything else works like that.

1348
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:21,929
 Okay, so you got
 this big-ass suitcase full of hair.

1349
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,734
 And this is your first shop?

1350
01:00:25,735 --> 01:00:28,570
 Will you make it
 through the day with that?

1351
01:00:28,571 --> 01:00:31,307
 How long
 before all that hair is gone?

1352
01:00:31,308 --> 01:00:33,976
 It could be gone in a few hours.

1353
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:35,477
 A few hours?

1354
01:00:35,478 --> 01:00:37,379
 Once the ladies get it,
 they want more.

1355
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,848
 And they won't pay their rent
 to get their hair done.

1356
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:42,849
 Yeah, there's a lot
 of that goin' on in America.

1357
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:44,286
 A lot of foreclosures.

1358
01:00:44,287 --> 01:00:46,288
 But they got hair.

1359
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:48,457
 There's no hair-closures
 goin' on.

1360
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,492
 So if you not
 in the weave business,

1361
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:53,095
 you not in the hair business.

1362
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,531
 It's true, because
 you can't make the money.

1363
01:00:55,532 --> 01:00:57,166
 The weavin'
 is where the money is.

1364
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:58,233
 It takes you up there.

1365
01:00:58,234 --> 01:01:00,069
 It puts you up there
 with the doctors, you know?

1366
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,270
 It's that kind of income

1367
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:03,906
 because you're finding something
 that you can really promote.

1368
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:06,442
 It's like surgery.
 Non-surgical hair replacement.

1369
01:01:06,443 --> 01:01:07,843
 It's the real deal.

1370
01:01:07,844 --> 01:01:09,078
 You ever say, like,

1371
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:11,880
 ''Hey, this hair is
 from a Hindu princess''?

1372
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:13,048
 Charge a little extra?

1373
01:01:13,049 --> 01:01:14,383
 No. Why should I say that?

1374
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:17,384
 Well, I've put it on some celebrities
 and said, ''This was on so-and-so.

1375
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:19,722
 ''l'll sell it to you if you want it.''

1376
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:20,889
 They'll buy it.

1377
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,157
 ''Ooh, I got so-and-so's hair.''

1378
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:24,526
 Really? So you can sell, like,

1379
01:01:24,527 --> 01:01:26,595
 a used weave
 if Angela Bassett had it?

1380
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:29,298
 Yeah, she brings it back,
 then I resell it.

1381
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:30,666
 I say, ''Angela
 had it on her head.''

1382
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:31,867
 And they like, ''Really?''

1383
01:01:31,868 --> 01:01:33,168
 ''This is Vivica Fox hair.''

1384
01:01:33,169 --> 01:01:34,570
 Yeah, and they'll buy.

1385
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:37,571
 You know,
 she like Malaysian hair.

1386
01:01:37,741 --> 01:01:39,508
 Vivica likes Malaysian hair.

1387
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:42,509
 She's not really
 into the lndian hair.

1388
01:01:43,279 --> 01:01:46,279
 I knew there was a market
 for selling lndian hair,

1389
01:01:46,649 --> 01:01:48,617
 but what I really wanted to know

1390
01:01:48,618 --> 01:01:51,618
 is if I could make any money
 at all selling black hair.

1391
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:54,721
 Black hair!

1392
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,160
 Black hair!

1393
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:06,869
 How you doin', sir?

1394
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:07,903
 Okay, sir. How are you?

1395
01:02:07,904 --> 01:02:08,937
 Pretty good.

1396
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:10,939
 So you sell a lot of hair here?

1397
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,107
 Yes.

1398
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:13,275
 What kind of hair?

1399
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:16,078
 We have Malaysian.
 We have the lndian hair.

1400
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,880
 We have synthetic hair.

1401
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:19,348
 We have so many different hair.

1402
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:22,349
 Wow. Do you have
 any hair from Africa?

1403
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:25,621
 Really?
 Can I see the African hair?

1404
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:28,622
 Where is that?

1405
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:31,758
 This is--
 That's not African hair.

1406
01:02:32,328 --> 01:02:33,996
 That's lndian hair.
 It says ''lndian.''

1407
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:35,998
 lndia is Africa from lndians.

1408
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:37,966
 That's lndian hair?

1409
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,002
 For African women?

1410
01:02:40,003 --> 01:02:43,003
 See, I was tryin' to sell--

1411
01:02:43,473 --> 01:02:45,808
 I had lndian hair,
 and I sold it easy,

1412
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:48,809
 but the black hair, nobody--

1413
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:53,313
 Would you like to buy
 some black hair?

1414
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,385
 I have all sorts
 of black hair here.

1415
01:02:56,386 --> 01:02:59,386
 Some of this hair is from Cleveland
 and Cincinnati.

1416
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:03,025
 This hair is from Detroit.

1417
01:03:03,026 --> 01:03:05,761
 Well, you might want
 to take it back.

1418
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:07,129
 So this is not good hair?

1419
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:08,197
 Uh-uh.

1420
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:10,732
 ls that off of someone else's...

1421
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:13,733
 This hair was
 cut off at a Baptist temple.

1422
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:17,239
 Uh, well, I couldn't--

1423
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,708
 It wouldn't be healthful
 for me to sell that hair here.

1424
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:21,944
 You think somebody's
 going to get sickle-cell

1425
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:23,946
 or something
 from wearing black hair?

1426
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:26,081
 Oh, yes.

1427
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:28,150
 The hair's no good.

1428
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:30,719
 But it's black hair
 for black people.

1429
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,754
 But black people
 don't wear that no more.

1430
01:03:32,755 --> 01:03:35,755
 So my nappy hair's
 not worth anything?

1431
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:38,160
 They don't want to look like,
 you know...

1432
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:41,161
 like, you know, Africa, like this.

1433
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:43,098
 They want to look the style.

1434
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,601
 You know, right now,
 you look at all the magazines,

1435
01:03:45,602 --> 01:03:47,469
 all the style,
 what kind of styles they have.

1436
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,538
 They want sexy-looking.

1437
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:51,773
 So this is sexy?

1438
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:54,710
 Nobody walks around
 with nappy hair no more.

1439
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:57,146
 No more. You see,
 how many people, they do it?

1440
01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:59,314
 No. You make sure
 the hair's straight.

1441
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:01,850
 Look more natural.

1442
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:04,851
 As far as black women
 wearing hair from other nationalities

1443
01:04:06,322 --> 01:04:09,322
 or the hairstyles
 of other ethnicities and races,

1444
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,660
 you know, I would just say
 that European and Asian hair,

1445
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:19,566
 the texture
 seems to be the style

1446
01:04:19,702 --> 01:04:22,702
 that all women seem
 to be trying to achieve.

1447
01:04:22,906 --> 01:04:25,307
 I always
 was bothered by women

1448
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:28,308
 that had it
 and used it as a power thing.

1449
01:04:30,713 --> 01:04:32,848
 It's kind of like, if I'm wearing
 somebody else's jewelry,

1450
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:35,751
 but I'm flexin' it on you,
 that's kind of fake.

1451
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:38,752
 So if you got a wig on,
 but you flexin' your hair

1452
01:04:38,755 --> 01:04:41,223
 like I'm supposed to give
 you points for that hair,

1453
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:43,091
 I'm not giving you those points.

1454
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:44,493
 l'll give you points for your ass.

1455
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:46,828
 l'll give you points
 for your legs or your skin,

1456
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:48,163
 but you don't get points for that.

1457
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:50,632
 But you whippin' it at me like--

1458
01:04:50,633 --> 01:04:52,734
 And a real pimp can always
 look at a girl

1459
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,204
 and know what she
 looks like baldheaded. Be like...

1460
01:04:55,205 --> 01:04:58,106
 You could see through the cap.

1461
01:04:58,107 --> 01:04:59,708
 I have alopecia,

1462
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:02,709
 which causes hair loss
 on your head or on your body.

1463
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:06,246
 I chose not to wear a wig
 for a number of reasons.

1464
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:11,153
 There's this feeling
 about somehow hiding,

1465
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:14,154
 and I never wanted to feel
 like I was hiding something.

1466
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:18,325
 I wanted to deal with sort of
 accepting who you are

1467
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,331
 and look in the mirror
 and feeling

1468
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:25,332
 as though
 you're beautiful and legitimate.

1469
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:28,668
 So I think the reason
 hair is so important

1470
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:32,405
 is because our self-esteem
 is wrapped up in it.

1471
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:37,010
 It's like a type of currency for us,

1472
01:05:37,614 --> 01:05:40,614
 even though those standards
 are completely unrealistic

1473
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:45,153
 and unattainable,
 especially for black women.

1474
01:05:45,154 --> 01:05:47,289
 You know, you're going to
 be graduating soon,

1475
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:49,358
 going out into the real world.

1476
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,059
 You might have
 to pay your parents back

1477
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,029
 for the weaves at some point.

1478
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,531
 Do you think...

1479
01:05:56,532 --> 01:05:59,434
 you have a chance of getting
 a good job with natural hair,

1480
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:02,435
 or are you going to need a weave
 to get a good job?

1481
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:05,672
 Even though I think
 your Afro is kind of cute,

1482
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:08,775
 if somebody came into my office
 with an Afro way out here

1483
01:06:11,114 --> 01:06:13,482
 and a suit,
 that just seems really out of place.

1484
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:15,250
 It's like a contradiction.

1485
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:17,452
 So I would
 kind of second-guess.

1486
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:19,421
 And I agree with you.

1487
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:22,422
 If I was going to,
 say, some new law firm,

1488
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:24,626
 and you wanted to,
 you know, join,

1489
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:26,695
 and I'm like,
 ''Okay, you look really nice,

1490
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:27,963
 ''and I'm understanding
 what you're saying,

1491
01:06:27,964 --> 01:06:29,231
 ''but I can't get past the fact

1492
01:06:29,232 --> 01:06:32,232
 ''that you're going to be sitting
 with big executives and all that,

1493
01:06:32,268 --> 01:06:35,268
 ''and it's, like, they're not going
 to really take you seriously

1494
01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:38,538
 ''for the fact that you just don't look
 too put together.''

1495
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:45,178
 You have to kind of really
 have conviction with it.

1496
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:47,049
 'Cause there's
 so many pressures

1497
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,250
 to straighten your hair
 all the time.

1498
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:51,251
 But the resuIt is
 a beautiful thing, you know.

1499
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:55,357
 And it's funny,
 because I always think it's interesting

1500
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,358
 that to keep my hair
 the same texture

1501
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:02,595
 as it grows out of my head
 is looked at as revolutionary.

1502
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,667
 Why is that?

1503
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:13,909
 I seek them out
 with the natural hair.

1504
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:15,577
 Now, do you seek out women
 with natural hair

1505
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:17,279
 'cause it's more affordable?

1506
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,547
 Absolutely.

1507
01:07:18,548 --> 01:07:19,815
 How old are you?

1508
01:07:19,816 --> 01:07:20,849
 Nineteen.

1509
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:21,950
 Nineteen. God.

1510
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:23,352
 Have you ever seen a woman,

1511
01:07:23,353 --> 01:07:26,353
 seen her hair, and thought,
 ''l can't afford her''?

1512
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:29,958
 Sometimes.

1513
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,060
 Okay.

1514
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:35,061
 I know how you feel.

1515
01:07:36,232 --> 01:07:38,166
 Does this have an effect
 on the relationships

1516
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,701
 between black men
 and black women?

1517
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:42,702
 ls there a pressure
 on a black man...

1518
01:07:43,373 --> 01:07:44,606
 Right.

1519
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:45,640
 that's dating a black woman

1520
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:48,641
 that a white man doesn't
 have dating a white woman?

1521
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:51,446
 A black man
 automatically knows,

1522
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:54,349
 out the gate,
 especially if his mama's black,

1523
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:56,418
 so he's already grown up
 in a household with a black woman.

1524
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:58,520
 So he kind of understands

1525
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:01,521
 the importance
 of getting the hair done

1526
01:08:01,624 --> 01:08:03,625
 and of the woman looking good,

1527
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:06,461
 and he wants his woman
 to look good.

1528
01:08:06,462 --> 01:08:09,462
 Yeah, he probably has to make
 a bit of an investment in that area

1529
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:14,401
 and just know
 that's part of being a black woman,

1530
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:16,004
 and I'm going to embrace that.

1531
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:19,005
 I'm just sayin',
 your woman has a head of hair,

1532
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:22,542
 it's like a condo, and you
 got to pay the maintenance.

1533
01:08:25,014 --> 01:08:26,982
 When your woman's hair
 is jacked,

1534
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:29,983
 it's a reflection on you.

1535
01:08:30,386 --> 01:08:33,386
 And when you date a chick,
 as a single guy,

1536
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:35,424
 when I go out with a girl
 and I look at her,

1537
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:36,591
 and I'm looking at her hair,

1538
01:08:36,592 --> 01:08:38,026
 first thing I know,

1539
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:39,828
 whether we could go
 to the bathhouse,

1540
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:42,097
 steaming, swimming,
 or a beach trip,

1541
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:43,698
 and is it going to be
 a big to-do?

1542
01:08:43,699 --> 01:08:46,134
 When you have natural hair,
 you can do stuff. More stuff.

1543
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:49,135
 If I get caught in the rain,
 it's not the end of the day.

1544
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:53,475
 She will be, like,
 ''l don't want a massage,''

1545
01:08:53,476 --> 01:08:54,976
 or, ''l don't want
 to go to the steam room.''

1546
01:08:54,977 --> 01:08:56,211
 And you say, ''Why not?''

1547
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:57,379
 ''I'm not tense.''

1548
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,680
 You know she's tense.

1549
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:01,681
 She's tense at the idea
 of the weave she just paid for

1550
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:03,185
 just fallin' to pieces.

1551
01:09:03,186 --> 01:09:05,487
 Do you swim?

1552
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:08,488
 I have a pool.

1553
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:10,358
 That doesn't answer the question.

1554
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,793
 I do have a pool.

1555
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:13,428
 I can definitely get in the water.

1556
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:15,864
 I definitely get in the water,
 from about here down.

1557
01:09:15,865 --> 01:09:17,332
 You don't swim?

1558
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:20,035
 No. We don't play those games.

1559
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:22,804
 He's got to be really special
 for me to get my hair wet.

1560
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:24,439
 Taking a shower together

1561
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,308
 could be more intimate
 than having sex.

1562
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:27,876
 Wow.

1563
01:09:27,877 --> 01:09:30,877
 That's damn near like,
 ''You're my nigga for real.''

1564
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:34,483
 All my white classmates,
 whenever l'd get out of the pool

1565
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:36,318
 and my hair went
 from straight to curly,

1566
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,652
 they were like, ''Wow!''

1567
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:39,554
 And they'd pull on it.
 And I'm like...

1568
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:41,122
 But they're curious.

1569
01:09:41,123 --> 01:09:44,123
 They're curious white people.
 It's okay.

1570
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,027
 It's okay. You can touch it.

1571
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:48,263
 But just be gentle,
 and if it's me.

1572
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:50,966
 Don't just go walking up to a random
 black chick on the street

1573
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,034
 and reach out to touch her hair,

1574
01:09:53,035 --> 01:09:54,069
 'cause you might get hurt,

1575
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:56,137
 your fingers broken,
 sawed off, something.

1576
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:58,406
 Of course,
 a random white stranger

1577
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:01,309
 shouldn't walk up
 and touch a black woman's hair,

1578
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,912
 but what about her husband,
 her boyfriend?

1579
01:10:03,913 --> 01:10:05,780
 You'd be surprised.

1580
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:07,816
 You guys, anybody
 ever been with a woman

1581
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:10,519
 that you couldn't touch her hair?

1582
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,687
 You know, when you can't
 put your hands

1583
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:14,956
 through a woman's hair,
 there's a lack of intimacy.

1584
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:17,957
 Have you ever put your hand
 through a black woman's hair?

1585
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:19,294
 Not that I can remember.

1586
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:21,563
 You can't touch
 a black woman's hair.

1587
01:10:21,564 --> 01:10:22,697
 You just don't touch it.

1588
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:23,965
 Just leave it alone.

1589
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:26,268
 Don't tell me
 I can't touch your head.

1590
01:10:26,269 --> 01:10:28,503
 It's decoration. Leave it alone.

1591
01:10:28,504 --> 01:10:30,238
 It's like plastic fruit?

1592
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,507
 Kind of.
 Just leave it alone.

1593
01:10:32,508 --> 01:10:33,942
 I don't care
 if you got fake titties,

1594
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:35,443
 I want to at least
 be able to squeeze 'em.

1595
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:38,380
 There just can't be no off-limits
 to no parts of your body.

1596
01:10:38,381 --> 01:10:41,381
 If it's fake, cool,
 but I want to touch anyway.

1597
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:44,719
 Like, really. Don't do that.

1598
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,754
 'Cause l'll have to fight you.

1599
01:10:45,755 --> 01:10:48,056
 So you can't touch
 your woman's hair?

1600
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:50,792
 Hell, no! Not a black woman,
 right after she get it done.

1601
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:52,327
 ''Nigga, I just got this done.

1602
01:10:52,328 --> 01:10:54,629
 ''Now let me wrap this up
 before we do anything.''

1603
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,630
 The weave,
 yeah, it does matter.

1604
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:00,001
 It definitely matters
 if a girl got natural or weave.

1605
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:01,503
 I like real hair.

1606
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:03,538
 I mean, if you baldheaded,
 I'm cool with that, too.

1607
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:05,006
 You can't run
 your fingers through,

1608
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:06,841
 'cause your fingers get stuck.

1609
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:09,842
 Like a deejay!

1610
01:11:11,013 --> 01:11:12,547
 I don't want to run
 into the tracks

1611
01:11:12,548 --> 01:11:14,783
 and get caught up
 and got to reset the fingers,

1612
01:11:14,784 --> 01:11:16,017
 like, you know what I'm saying?

1613
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:18,420
 It's like gettin' your fingernail
 stuck in a sweater or something,

1614
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:19,754
 and you don't want that happening.

1615
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:21,022
 That's just nasty.

1616
01:11:21,023 --> 01:11:22,657
 So weave-touching is off-limits?

1617
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:24,626
 Do not touch my weave, no.

1618
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:27,395
 I don't even touch
 the inside of my weave, barely.

1619
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:29,364
 But how close
 can you get with somebody

1620
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:31,366
 if you can't touch their hair?

1621
01:11:31,367 --> 01:11:33,001
 I mean, at the right time,
 the right place,

1622
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:35,136
 I might be in another zone,

1623
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:38,137
 but if I'm in my right mind,
 get out my weave.

1624
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:40,308
 So what, you got to be high
 for somebody to touch your weave?

1625
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:41,843
 Maybe.

1626
01:11:41,844 --> 01:11:43,778
 Weave sex
 is a little awkward.

1627
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:46,779
 What do you do?

1628
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:51,417
 I guess stay on top.

1629
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:54,289
 So if you're makin' love
 to one of these women

1630
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:56,458
 and you want to roll
 your hands through their hair,

1631
01:11:56,459 --> 01:11:58,627
 you just got
 to really put all the...

1632
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:01,096
 Put all your effort in the bangs.

1633
01:12:01,097 --> 01:12:02,397
 My advice for men

1634
01:12:02,398 --> 01:12:05,100
 when they're making love
 to a woman who has a weave

1635
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,502
 is keep your hands
 on the titties.

1636
01:12:07,503 --> 01:12:10,138
 That's probably the safest bet.

1637
01:12:10,139 --> 01:12:11,840
 On the titties.

1638
01:12:11,841 --> 01:12:13,308
 You can only touch
 up to here,

1639
01:12:13,309 --> 01:12:16,077
 but if you get here,
 that's the forbidden zone?

1640
01:12:16,078 --> 01:12:17,412
 Exactly.

1641
01:12:17,413 --> 01:12:18,680
 You grab it during sex,

1642
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:20,515
 it's going to tear
 the relationship's ass up.

1643
01:12:20,516 --> 01:12:21,850
 It's going to hurt
 the relationship, definitely,

1644
01:12:21,851 --> 01:12:22,984
 if you grab it during sex,

1645
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:24,719
 'cause it's going to go
 here, there.

1646
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,421
 They don't want you
 pulling that tail!

1647
01:12:26,422 --> 01:12:29,124
 Maybe we stayed together
 back in the old days

1648
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:32,125
 'cause Kunta Kinte could
 put his hands through Kizzy's hair,

1649
01:12:35,164 --> 01:12:37,666
 thus bringing them
 closer together.

1650
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,300
 Kizzy was his daughter.

1651
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:41,336
 Oh, Kizzy was his daughter.
 I messed up.

1652
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:44,337
 Does your wife
 let you touch her hair?

1653
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:48,508
 The question is,
 do I let her touch mine?

1654
01:12:50,112 --> 01:12:52,414
 So I hung out with her
 a couple of times.

1655
01:12:52,415 --> 01:12:54,015
 You know,
 we went from partying

1656
01:12:54,016 --> 01:12:57,016
 to, like, maybe
 we should do something.

1657
01:12:57,019 --> 01:12:58,920
 You know, been over
 to my house a couple times,

1658
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:00,422
 laid up
 in the bed a couple times.

1659
01:13:00,423 --> 01:13:03,224
 I ain't get at it yet,
 but I'm close.

1660
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:04,759
 But I haven't ran
 my fingers through her hair

1661
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,760
 because I'm not sure,
 is she really...

1662
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:09,364
 ls that all her hair?

1663
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:12,365
 And I don't want to ask her
 is that all her hair.

1664
01:13:12,535 --> 01:13:15,270
 And I don't want to fool around
 and rub my fingers through it,

1665
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:16,771
 and say, ''Wait, wait, wait, wait.''

1666
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:19,772
 That ''wait, don't do that.''

1667
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:21,276
 I don't want to ruin the rhythm,

1668
01:13:21,277 --> 01:13:23,378
 so I've been
 waiting for a period

1669
01:13:23,379 --> 01:13:25,613
 where I ask her,
 what are the rules and regulations

1670
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:28,614
 of messing with your hair
 and making you feel sexy?

1671
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:31,653
 But I haven't got there yet.

1672
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:34,654
 I'm still waiting
 for that moment.

1673
01:13:36,058 --> 01:13:37,826
 Hold up there.
 Hold a minute.

1674
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:40,395
 I was making love
 to this woman one time, right?

1675
01:13:40,396 --> 01:13:43,396
 And I was, you know,
 gettin' it from the back.

1676
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:45,266
 You know what I mean, right?

1677
01:13:45,267 --> 01:13:46,701
 You was getting it
 from the back?

1678
01:13:46,702 --> 01:13:49,404
 Doggy-style!

1679
01:13:49,405 --> 01:13:51,606
 And she told me--

1680
01:13:51,607 --> 01:13:54,175
 She told me
 to pull her hair.

1681
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:55,677
 And when I pulled her hair...

1682
01:13:55,678 --> 01:13:57,545
 it came off.

1683
01:13:57,546 --> 01:13:59,481
 I said, ''Uh-oh.

1684
01:13:59,482 --> 01:14:01,349
 ''l think it looks like a man.''

1685
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,151
 - Oh, no!
 - But it wasn't.

1686
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:04,519
 - We ain't talkin' about that.
 - But it wasn't.

1687
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,520
 Baldheaded as could be.

1688
01:14:08,023 --> 01:14:09,824
 So you cannot touch
 a black woman's hair.

1689
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:11,826
 You can't. Wrong.
 You can't do it.

1690
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:13,228
 Understandably so.

1691
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:15,697
 If you paid $150 for a haircut,

1692
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:17,198
 you wouldn't want people
 touchin' your head.

1693
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:20,199
 You can't touch the weave?

1694
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:21,936
 When was the last time
 you touched a woman's hair?

1695
01:14:21,937 --> 01:14:24,472
 1986, before the market crash.

1696
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:27,473
 The market crashed
 in '87, October 19th.

1697
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:30,943
 The last time I was allowed
 to touch a broad's hair was...

1698
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:35,250
 '86, somewhere in there.

1699
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:36,851
 White women love you
 to touch their hair.

1700
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:39,852
 Pull it, yank it.
 Twirlin' 'em around by it.

1701
01:14:39,955 --> 01:14:41,556
 Jump off the ceiling with it.

1702
01:14:41,557 --> 01:14:43,892
 Jump off the cliff
 and hang-glide with it.

1703
01:14:43,893 --> 01:14:46,694
 ls this why black men--
 some black men favor white women?

1704
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:48,062
 - Yes.
 - No!

1705
01:14:48,063 --> 01:14:49,430
 I don't favor them, though.

1706
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:51,933
 But some black men--
 not you--

1707
01:14:51,934 --> 01:14:54,269
 some black men do favor--

1708
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:56,304
 - White women.
 - Yes.

1709
01:14:56,305 --> 01:14:59,305
 Do you feel a level
 of intimacy with a white woman

1710
01:14:59,642 --> 01:15:00,909
 that you cannot feel
 with a black woman?

1711
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,877
 - Yes, I do!
 - I'm not going to say that.

1712
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:05,280
 l'll speak up myself!
 Hell, yeah!

1713
01:15:05,281 --> 01:15:06,848
 Because there's no rules.

1714
01:15:06,849 --> 01:15:09,751
 I can do things with a white broad
 that I can't do with a black, yes!

1715
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:12,752
 Not true. You got to find
 the right black woman.

1716
01:15:26,969 --> 01:15:29,103
 It's no secret that some
 of the best conversations

1717
01:15:29,104 --> 01:15:31,773
 happen in barbershops
 and hair salons.

1718
01:15:31,774 --> 01:15:33,074
 While the big hair business,

1719
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:36,075
 like manufacturing and distribution
 isn't in black hands,

1720
01:15:36,612 --> 01:15:38,313
 these barbershops
 and hair salons

1721
01:15:38,314 --> 01:15:41,314
 employ thousands of black men
 and women all over the country,

1722
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:43,785
 feed black babies,

1723
01:15:43,786 --> 01:15:46,321
 and send thousands
 of black kids to college.

1724
01:15:46,322 --> 01:15:47,722
 And they continue to act

1725
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:49,724
 as social centers
 in their communities.

1726
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:52,725
 As the barber,
 what is your role in the community?

1727
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:56,731
 I'm the doctor.
 I'm the psychiatrist.

1728
01:15:56,732 --> 01:15:59,033
 Whatever it is you need,

1729
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:00,768
 if I can help you,
 l'll try to help you.

1730
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:02,337
 It's still an industry

1731
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:04,539
 where somebody
 can go into business,

1732
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:07,540
 make a lot of money,
 not have a college education,

1733
01:16:07,576 --> 01:16:10,144
 be able to do something wonderful
 for themselves

1734
01:16:10,145 --> 01:16:11,279
 and for their families

1735
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,614
 and maybe even
 their communities.

1736
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:14,115
 But there's this expression,

1737
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:16,985
 this creative expression
 of black people

1738
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:19,387
 that I think is shown
 when we see

1739
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:22,388
 all of these amazing
 individual hairstyles.

1740
01:16:23,058 --> 01:16:25,026
 But what's the definition
 of style?

1741
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:26,327
 Right there, that's style.
 See that?

1742
01:16:26,328 --> 01:16:28,496
 It's like a sculpture.

1743
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:29,898
 Hairdressers are superstars.

1744
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:31,199
 Barbers are superstars

1745
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,200
 that are bigger
 than doctors, lawyers.

1746
01:16:35,537 --> 01:16:37,138
 What are your hair dreams?

1747
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:39,874
 I want to own
 a whole chain of salons.

1748
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:41,643
 - Like lHOPs.
 - Right.

1749
01:16:41,644 --> 01:16:43,278
 What's your hair dream?

1750
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:44,913
 What's my hair dream?

1751
01:16:44,914 --> 01:16:47,914
 To own my own salon
 and be a platform artist.

1752
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:50,118
 Platform artist?
 At the Bronner Brothers Show?

1753
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:53,119
 Right. Like
 at the Bronner Brothers Show.

1754
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:56,557
 So here we are in Atlanta.

1755
01:16:56,558 --> 01:16:59,027
 After months of rehearsals
 in the heat,

1756
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:01,195
 fish tanks, Botox clinics,

1757
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:02,697
 churches, and day spas,

1758
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:05,698
 we finally made it to the
 Bronner Brothers hair competition,

1759
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:08,636
 all in the pursuit of good hair.

1760
01:17:08,637 --> 01:17:10,538
 Now let's break it down.

1761
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:12,040
 We have Jason,

1762
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:15,041
 the self-proclaimed
 Rosa Parks of good hair,

1763
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,644
 the favorite to win

1764
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:18,313
 even though
 no one has seen him practice.

1765
01:17:18,314 --> 01:17:21,049
 I told everybody
 to be here around 3:00.

1766
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,651
 It's 3:05. It is what it is.

1767
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:25,153
 We've got Tanya and Kevin,

1768
01:17:25,154 --> 01:17:26,754
 who have some
 beautiful models...

1769
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:28,556
 Oh, God!

1770
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:30,458
 And the heavenly Father
 in their corner.

1771
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:31,492
 Victory, Lord,

1772
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:33,494
 in the name of Jesus
 and the Father,

1773
01:17:33,495 --> 01:17:36,164
 let Your will be done.

1774
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:37,665
 And then there's Freddie,

1775
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:40,666
 the old pro with the tragic history
 of elaborate themes gone wrong.

1776
01:17:42,237 --> 01:17:44,572
 Are they connected,
 they set up okay?

1777
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:46,140
 And then there's Derek,

1778
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:48,643
 a guy who's
 all about the hair.

1779
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:50,144
 Have you seen the boots?

1780
01:17:50,145 --> 01:17:53,145
 Wow! That is some boot.

1781
01:17:53,816 --> 01:17:56,451
 All of them as representative
 of the black hair industry

1782
01:17:56,452 --> 01:17:59,452
 as anything the Bronner Brothers
 put on their shelves.

1783
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:03,524
 Yes, folks,
 this is the alpha and omega,

1784
01:18:03,525 --> 01:18:05,760
 where it all begins
 and some of it ends,

1785
01:18:05,761 --> 01:18:08,761
 where the weave monster sleeps
 and the world of curl leaks.

1786
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:12,633
 It's the Bronner Brothers
 Hair Battle Royale.

1787
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:15,634
 Now let's get ready
 to do some really good hair.

1788
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:19,138
 Hair is a woman's glory.

1789
01:18:20,376 --> 01:18:23,376
 And that you share
 that glory with your family.

1790
01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:28,047
 Okay, before we start,
 let's meet our judges.

1791
01:18:28,817 --> 01:18:31,817
 First up, the beauty surgeon,
 Dr. Dave Ray,

1792
01:18:32,888 --> 01:18:35,888
 internationally known
 weaveologist, Sammy Jones,

1793
01:18:36,492 --> 01:18:39,492
 hot comb expert
 Britannica Stewart,

1794
01:18:39,995 --> 01:18:41,963
 and, of course,
 former champion,

1795
01:18:41,964 --> 01:18:44,964
 the legendary
 Patrick Antonio Bradley.

1796
01:18:49,805 --> 01:18:52,173
 Welcome to
 the Hair Battle Royale.

1797
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:53,708
 Here are the basic rules.

1798
01:18:53,709 --> 01:18:55,043
 There are four categories

1799
01:18:55,044 --> 01:18:57,145
 that each contestant
 will be judged on:

1800
01:18:57,146 --> 01:18:59,447
 originality, creativity,

1801
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:00,481
 hairstyles,

1802
01:19:00,482 --> 01:19:02,683
 and audience participation.

1803
01:19:02,684 --> 01:19:04,318
 There's a mandatory three-cut.

1804
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,319
 Three heads of hair
 must be combed and styled.

1805
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:09,791
 They have fifteen minutes
 to complete a look--

1806
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:11,926
 a fantasy look
 or an avant-garde look.

1807
01:19:11,927 --> 01:19:14,927
 And finally, they must present
 a central theme on stage with music.

1808
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:21,367
 Tanya Crumel
 was born in New York

1809
01:19:21,637 --> 01:19:23,471
 and raised
 in Birmingham, Alabama.

1810
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:26,472
 Tanya has been doing hair
 for twelve years

1811
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:29,377
 under the instruction
 of Kevin Kirk.

1812
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:32,378
 She gives total thanks
 to the Lord every single day.

1813
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:36,949
 Ladies and gentlemen, give
 Tanya a great big round of applause.

1814
01:19:47,796 --> 01:19:50,796
 Can you feel the flows?

1815
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:04,810
 Tanya came to hit hard!

1816
01:20:07,549 --> 01:20:10,549
 Don't hurt her.

1817
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:28,968
 She don't want
 no split decision.

1818
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:32,271
 She wants a knockout.

1819
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,210
 Tanya Crumel.

1820
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:41,916
 How'd you feel?

1821
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:44,917
 I feel good!

1822
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:48,487
 ls there anything
 you would change?

1823
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:52,424
 Just when we were all certain
 that Tanya couldn't be topped,

1824
01:20:53,595 --> 01:20:56,397
 Jason's models arrived...

1825
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:59,398
 with 700 carats of diamonds.

1826
01:21:00,469 --> 01:21:03,469
 Even our own camera crew
 was taken by surprise.

1827
01:21:04,506 --> 01:21:06,807
 Would this be
 the deciding factor

1828
01:21:06,808 --> 01:21:09,808
 in the 60th Annual Bronner Brothers
 Hair Battle Royale?

1829
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:13,579
 Let's see.

1830
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:28,362
 I was having
 the most amazing dream.

1831
01:21:28,363 --> 01:21:31,363
 Oh, well,
 it's time to go to work!

1832
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:42,241
 Time to get that work done.

1833
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:48,013
 Exercise.

1834
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:51,984
 Getting in shape.

1835
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:06,667
 Now we know
 why Jason didn't rehearse.

1836
01:22:06,668 --> 01:22:09,668
 No one needs to choreograph
 hot women with no clothes on.

1837
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:11,405
 If you like what you see,

1838
01:22:11,406 --> 01:22:14,406
 let me hear some noise
 out there.

1839
01:22:42,137 --> 01:22:45,137
 Jason Griggers.

1840
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:52,811
 Will it be a knockout?

1841
01:22:52,948 --> 01:22:54,248
 You're the best, Papa.

1842
01:22:54,249 --> 01:22:57,249
 Thank you.
 We'll see who's best, Mama.

1843
01:22:58,253 --> 01:22:59,687
 With such a hard act to follow,

1844
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:02,290
 I could see that Freddie
 was cracking down on her team

1845
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:04,091
 and internalizing the pressure.

1846
01:23:04,092 --> 01:23:06,761
 Make sure when I cut you or curl,
 you work the judges.

1847
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:09,697
 Work the judges.
 Smile.

1848
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:12,166
 Seductive. Smile.

1849
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:14,468
 There's no question that Freddie
 is a brilliant mind

1850
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:15,936
 in the hair world,

1851
01:23:15,937 --> 01:23:18,205
 but after the failure
 of Broke Front Mountain,

1852
01:23:18,206 --> 01:23:20,574
 her success will depend
 on her ability

1853
01:23:20,575 --> 01:23:23,575
 to translate her concept
 into good hair.

1854
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:31,550
 It's obvious at this point
 that Jason's styling ability

1855
01:23:31,687 --> 01:23:34,055
 is a thorn in Freddie's side.

1856
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:36,390
 Freddie will have to harness
 her amateur models

1857
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:39,391
 and rely on a complicated concept
 to earn the belt.

1858
01:23:43,432 --> 01:23:45,066
 All right, make some noise

1859
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:48,067
 for Freddie J.,
 ladies and gentlemen.

1860
01:23:58,046 --> 01:24:01,046
 Freddie had her whole camp
 out there exercising.

1861
01:24:21,236 --> 01:24:24,236
 The judges have
 no idea what's goin' on.

1862
01:24:24,906 --> 01:24:27,906
 Freddie really
 made it simple this time.

1863
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:32,444
 Freddie knows how to handle it.

1864
01:24:36,084 --> 01:24:37,852
 Oh, my goodness,
 what are they doin'?

1865
01:24:37,853 --> 01:24:39,687
 She tryin' to cut her hair
 in there.

1866
01:24:39,688 --> 01:24:42,688
 She's cutting
 that hair underwater.

1867
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:49,962
 I think they threw her in.
 What's goin' on?

1868
01:24:50,499 --> 01:24:53,499
 I need some help.
 Get the lights on.

1869
01:24:55,437 --> 01:24:58,437
 Freddie had a secret move.

1870
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:03,611
 Freddie J.

1871
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:06,612
 Come on, Atlanta,
 give it up for Freddie J.

1872
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,820
 Aquarium, aquarium!

1873
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:15,089
 Freddie!

1874
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:16,624
 You did great.

1875
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:17,792
 How'd you think it went?

1876
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:19,960
 I didn't even
 know what was going on.

1877
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:22,961
 While Freddie and her team
 were still catching their breath,

1878
01:25:23,098 --> 01:25:26,098
 scores of dancers and models
 began to amass around Derek J.

1879
01:25:31,606 --> 01:25:34,606
 He is Bronner Brothers'
 current Male Hairstylist of the Year.

1880
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:41,013
 He will radiate
 his greatest potential to the world.

1881
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:44,084
 So you're closin' the show?

1882
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:45,486
 Yeah. They opened for me,

1883
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:47,888
 Now it's time
 to have the all-time headliner.

1884
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:49,557
 So you going to take this
 to the next level.

1885
01:25:49,558 --> 01:25:50,591
 Yes.

1886
01:25:50,592 --> 01:25:51,625
 Good luck.

1887
01:25:51,626 --> 01:25:53,961
 Ladies and gentlemen,

1888
01:25:53,962 --> 01:25:56,962
 I know you are ready
 to see the Battle continue.

1889
01:26:00,602 --> 01:26:03,602
 He is Derek J.

1890
01:26:25,861 --> 01:26:28,861
 He's in the house.

1891
01:26:35,136 --> 01:26:38,136
 Oh, my goodness!

1892
01:26:38,707 --> 01:26:40,908
 Remember,
 the maximum number of people

1893
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:43,611
 allowed on stage is ten.

1894
01:26:43,612 --> 01:26:46,612
 Anything more should result
 in an automatic disqualification.

1895
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:08,736
 Uh-oh.

1896
01:27:08,737 --> 01:27:10,838
 I think...

1897
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:13,674
 he wants...

1898
01:27:13,675 --> 01:27:16,675
 to knock out.

1899
01:27:49,644 --> 01:27:51,812
 Ladies and gentlemen...

1900
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:54,813
 Derek J.

1901
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:57,284
 That was way more
 than ten people.

1902
01:27:57,285 --> 01:28:00,154
 - And nude.
 - But they was not on the stage.

1903
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,790
 You know what I'm sayin'?
 So he found a loophole.

1904
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:05,791
 You can have twenty dancers
 on the side of the stage,

1905
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:09,163
 but they can't be
 on the stage.

1906
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:12,164
 Yeah, but if I get two plane tickets
 to go to New York,

1907
01:28:13,268 --> 01:28:14,802
 and I show up with ten people

1908
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:16,503
 and go,
 ''Well, they're not going to sit,''

1909
01:28:16,504 --> 01:28:18,639
 they don't let me on the plane.

1910
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,608
 I understand
 what you're sayin', but--

1911
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:23,277
 So this man
 brought seventy people?

1912
01:28:23,278 --> 01:28:24,545
 It's a band.

1913
01:28:24,546 --> 01:28:27,546
 Earth, Wind, and Fire
 don't got seventy people.

1914
01:28:27,782 --> 01:28:30,782
 Even though the judges
 have not deliberated yet,

1915
01:28:31,286 --> 01:28:33,187
 Heavenly Father,
 we're going to stand in our faith

1916
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:35,389
 and claim victory
 right now, Lord.

1917
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:37,057
 Who do you think won?

1918
01:28:37,058 --> 01:28:39,026
 We did! Of course.

1919
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:41,095
 All right. Take care.

1920
01:28:41,096 --> 01:28:43,597
 - Okay.
 - Stay off the pipe.

1921
01:28:43,598 --> 01:28:45,265
 You guys still think
 you're going to win?

1922
01:28:45,266 --> 01:28:47,134
 Of course.

1923
01:28:47,135 --> 01:28:48,268
 There's no question.

1924
01:28:48,269 --> 01:28:51,269
 We're more about
 the substance than the show.

1925
01:28:51,306 --> 01:28:53,340
 They need to bring it back
 where it's about hair.

1926
01:28:53,341 --> 01:28:55,409
 Jason's assistant was right.

1927
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:58,410
 At the end of the day,
 it's all about hair.

1928
01:28:58,713 --> 01:29:01,713
 And even though none of them
 cut that much hair,

1929
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:05,350
 one of them was
 about to win this contest.

1930
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:08,922
 Ladies and gentlemen,

1931
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:11,923
 we've got a champion.

1932
01:29:15,363 --> 01:29:17,998
 Our winner is...

1933
01:29:17,999 --> 01:29:20,999
 Derek J.

1934
01:29:29,844 --> 01:29:32,112
 Did you all have Derek winning?

1935
01:29:32,113 --> 01:29:34,114
 Yes.

1936
01:29:34,115 --> 01:29:36,183
 Bringing out the marching band

1937
01:29:36,184 --> 01:29:39,184
 actually used more
 than ten people at one time.

1938
01:29:39,821 --> 01:29:41,722
 But they were not on the stage.

1939
01:29:41,723 --> 01:29:43,490
 To be honest with you,
 he was brilliant.

1940
01:29:43,491 --> 01:29:45,125
 Everything tied in for him.

1941
01:29:45,126 --> 01:29:46,460
 Jason was number two,

1942
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:49,063
 but he was actually first
 in the hairstyles.

1943
01:29:49,064 --> 01:29:50,130
 But just like in basketball,

1944
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:51,532
 you have to play
 offense and defense.

1945
01:29:51,533 --> 01:29:54,034
 Freddie's I didn't quite get it.

1946
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:56,970
 I was like, ''Well, where
 is the connection here?''

1947
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:58,972
 You know,
 these people are in the club.

1948
01:29:58,973 --> 01:30:01,973
 ls there, you know,
 a fish tank in the club?

1949
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:04,878
 It didn't congeal.

1950
01:30:04,879 --> 01:30:06,747
 So, Tanya lost.

1951
01:30:06,748 --> 01:30:08,382
 What advice
 would you have for her?

1952
01:30:08,383 --> 01:30:10,150
 Originality.

1953
01:30:10,151 --> 01:30:11,652
 Now, if she
 had did her homework

1954
01:30:11,653 --> 01:30:14,188
 and realized
 that cutting upside-down--

1955
01:30:14,189 --> 01:30:17,189
 some of the other competitors
 have done that years before.

1956
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:18,726
 She's new to this,

1957
01:30:18,727 --> 01:30:20,694
 but maybe by the third time,
 she'll be all right.

1958
01:30:20,695 --> 01:30:22,162
 This is our Hollywood.

1959
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:25,163
 Competing has literally
 become a profession in itself.

1960
01:30:28,636 --> 01:30:31,371
 In trying to understand
 the world of black hair,

1961
01:30:31,372 --> 01:30:33,607
 I've been all over the world,

1962
01:30:33,608 --> 01:30:35,943
 and I've talked
 to all sorts of people.

1963
01:30:35,944 --> 01:30:38,944
 I've seen sodium hydroxide
 in its rawest form

1964
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:42,349
 and in the heads
 of four-year-old girls.

1965
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:44,852
 I've seen some people pay
 thousands for hair

1966
01:30:44,853 --> 01:30:47,588
 and others
 give it away to God.

1967
01:30:47,589 --> 01:30:49,490
 I've learned
 that the black hair industry

1968
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:51,925
 generates billions of dollars...

1969
01:30:51,926 --> 01:30:54,528
 mostly for white people
 and Asians.

1970
01:30:54,529 --> 01:30:57,529
 I've hung out with the best hairdressers
 in the country

1971
01:30:57,632 --> 01:31:00,400
 and watched a thrilling
 hair competition.

1972
01:31:00,401 --> 01:31:03,401
 I've seen black women
 work hard in their own businesses

1973
01:31:03,972 --> 01:31:06,972
 to give other black women
 straight hair.

1974
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:10,310
 So what do I tell my daughters?

1975
01:31:10,311 --> 01:31:13,311
 I tell them that the stuff
 on top of their heads

1976
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:15,549
 is nowhere near as important

1977
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:18,550
 as the stuff
 inside their heads.

1978
01:31:20,688 --> 01:31:23,688
 Once we realized
 and identified who we were,

1979
01:31:23,792 --> 01:31:25,292
 then it became personal.

1980
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:28,293
 Now I am also free to be
 who I want to be no matter what.

1981
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:31,431
 So my relaxed hair
 is just, to me,

1982
01:31:31,432 --> 01:31:33,500
 as African-based as an Afro,

1983
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:35,669
 because all of that
 came out of black culture.

1984
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:36,937
 But I don't think it should be--

1985
01:31:36,938 --> 01:31:39,139
 I don't think this is--
 I'm not my hair.

1986
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,642
 You know, it's just
 like putting on clothes.

1987
01:31:41,643 --> 01:31:43,977
 It changes,
 it alters your appearance.

1988
01:31:43,978 --> 01:31:45,045
 And it also alters the way

1989
01:31:45,046 --> 01:31:47,815
 that you are perceived
 to the world.

1990
01:31:47,816 --> 01:31:49,216
 Hair's very strong.

1991
01:31:49,217 --> 01:31:51,485
 There is no good hair.
 Hair is hair.

1992
01:31:51,486 --> 01:31:53,921
 You have to embrace
 what God's given you naturally

1993
01:31:53,922 --> 01:31:55,722
 and keep it moving.

1994
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:56,824
 You got to work
 with what you got.

1995
01:31:56,825 --> 01:31:58,192
 Or weave in
 what you don't got.

1996
01:31:58,193 --> 01:32:01,193
 Or weave in
 what you don't got. Hey.

1997
01:32:01,196 --> 01:32:04,031
 This is like soul music
 crossing over, this weave thing.

1998
01:32:04,032 --> 01:32:06,200
 We don't even know
 how many white girls

1999
01:32:06,201 --> 01:32:07,768
 really got weaves.

2000
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:09,169
 We should look at that, Chris.

2001
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,271
 We should find out
 which of these girls

2002
01:32:11,272 --> 01:32:14,272
 that we think got long, wavy hair
 really got a weave?

2003
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:18,946
 Black hair care manufacturers

2004
01:32:18,947 --> 01:32:21,947
 have turned
 the black hair care industry

2005
01:32:21,983 --> 01:32:24,983
 into a chemical waste dump.

2006
01:32:25,587 --> 01:32:26,920
 Who cares?

2007
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,921
 Not one piece of research
 have gone on in America,

2008
01:32:30,391 --> 01:32:32,359
 while we have gone
 to the moon

2009
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,795
 and walked on the moon,

2010
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:36,964
 when our scientists
 have not even walked

2011
01:32:36,965 --> 01:32:38,732
 on a black woman's head.

2012
01:32:38,733 --> 01:32:41,733
 Natural hair is freedom.

2013
01:32:46,174 --> 01:32:49,174
 Black women, yes,
 we are high-maintenance.

2014
01:32:49,878 --> 01:32:52,878
 But with us,
 you get so much.

2015
01:32:58,419 --> 01:33:01,121
 I just think that women

2016
01:33:01,122 --> 01:33:03,123
 shouldn't point fingers
 at other women

2017
01:33:03,124 --> 01:33:06,124
 for whatever they're doing
 to enhance their bodies.

2018
01:33:06,127 --> 01:33:08,929
 Other than that,
 do whatever makes you feel good,

2019
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:11,899
 because, trust me,
 if a woman ain't happy with herself,

2020
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,433
 she going to bring
 nothing but pain

2021
01:33:13,434 --> 01:33:16,434
