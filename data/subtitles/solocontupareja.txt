- Condoms?|- Yes.

There's some in my purse.|- Some what?
Con... doms...
Luis, breakfast's ready!
Jesus!
There should be|a law against idiots.
She dried her dog off|in a microwave! Come on!
- Did it work?|- It got cooked to a crisp.
What was that gringa|thinking of?
- What breed?|- It just says she was American.
I mean the dog.
A French poodle.|You know, the tiny ones.
- See you later, Paulina.|- Paola.
Want to go jogging sometime?|- Sure, anytime.
Paola...
The slogan? Still?
It's absolutely crucial.
The entire account|depends on it,
I know, Gloria.|I'm working on it.
Anyway, the commercial|is better without it.
I want good copy|and a good slogan,
Use your talent.
Use your imagination.|Use your brains.
Use the computer I gave you.
Just don't use up|any more time!
- It's just -|- Just nothing!
See you first thing Monday|at the office, okay?
I'll bring a slogan, I promise.
You better!
Listen...
save me some kisses|for Monday, okay?
Sure.
Fucking hell!
"Gómez Home-Style Jalapenos,'|The envy of Moctezuma,
Our national pride, Exclusively|from Hamsun-Rasmussen,"
No, that's crap.|It stinks.
It's gotta be more -|I don't know.
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos:|The taste of Moctezuma."
No, that's not it either.
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos:|They're mouth-watering!"
Not even close.
"The spice of life"?
No, I don't think so.
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos:|For a real socko taco."
Even worse.|That's really shit.
Fuck almighty!
And my fever's gone up!
- Hello?|- Tomas? You working?
Trying to, but I've got a fever.|What should I take?
"Two" aspirin,
Better still, change|your light bulb to 10 watts.
Are you my physician|or my electrician?
- Both. De auditu,|- What?
By hearing only.
Invite him.
- He can't. He's sick.|- Invite him anyway.
What's a wedding|without the cake?
A wedding?|Who's getting married?
Bubbles.
Bubbles-Soda?
Yeah,|Does she "owe" you something?
- Sort of. When are you leaving?|- In 10 minutes. But your fever...
Wait for me.|Two aspirins and I'll be ready.
Bubbles, man?
Bubbles.
The satisfied cat doesn't worry|about the mouse, does he?
- What?|- Nothing.
They make a lovely couple,|don't they?
An old fling with Bubbles is one thing,|but on her wedding day!
You went too far, Tomas.
Poor groom.
Bubbles says,|"Darling, you've been cuckolded."
And he says,|"Honey, how do you know?"
Clean up your act, Tomas.
You've been doing|the same old thing for years.
I swear I'm not|what you think I am.
Now you feel guilty.
He who lives by the sword|dies by the sword.
You haven't got a chance.
Want some coffee?
No, thanks.|I've got lots of work to do.
- Have you met Clarisa?|- From the penthouse?
No, Clarisa who just|moved in next door.
In between us?
No, I haven't seen her.|- Just as well.
Who do they think I am?
Mateo? It's Tomas.
I'm still sick.|I've got a fever.
- Did you change the lightbulb?|- Come on. This is serious. I can't work.
What are your symptoms?
Symptoms?|I don't know.
I feel lousy all over.
Take "two" aspirin|and come to my office "tomorrow,"
Your office?
Blood everywhere,
and a terrible pain|in my insides,
Unbearable,
The operating room|was spinning.
I felt like I was giving birth|to a porcupine.
My husband kept trying to help:|"Push! Push!"
Then I saw my little Ricardo,
and it was tears of joy.
Is that him?
He's not so hot.
I don't know.|You gotta envy the guy.
Inter nos, he's been featured|in several Pap smears.
Not mine.
Not yet.
You think I don't see you|staring at my belly?
What?
I'm not sick.|I'm just pregnant.
If you want to look,|just say so.
Mr. Tomas,|come this way, please.
Nosy creep!
- You have some white spots.|- White spots?
We need a throat smear|and blood tests.
You want to take blood?|With a needle?
Don't argue.|I'm your doctor.
And a hematic biometry|to see if there are any anomalies,
a complete blood analysis|and an HIV test
to see if you have any immunological|deficiency, like AIDS.
AIDS?
Who do you think I am?|- You're Tomas Tomas.
You can't take chances.|There's always a risk.
A blood transfusion, an infected syringe.|It can happen to anyone.
And you get laid a lot.
- You want me to boil them first?|- No, just get tested.
Go with Sylvia.|She'll take your blood.
Does it hurt?
Will this hurt?
First time?
It's very painful.
Very?
You mean extremely!
Good thing|you've never had a baby.
God forbid.
Be brave, Mr. Tomas.
Dr. Mateo says|you're a real man.
He says things|even he doesn't understand.
You look great in white.
They make me wear it.
Want to watch|the tube fill up?
Here goes the second one.|- Not another one, please.
I guess you get used|to these sorts of things.
I mean it, Sylvia.|White makes your eyes glow.
Does that hurt, Mr. Tomas?
Don't jiggle it.
What are you doing tonight?|- I don't know.
Oh, yes. I have a date.
- That's not true.|- How do you know?
Your words can lie,|but your pulse gives you away.
How about my place?
These you can boil.|You'll need them for the fecal analysis.
What do you think of Sylvia?
So-so.
Really?|Don't you think she's hot?
- She's all yours.|- I need a favor.
Teresa and I are going|to a conference.
Here are the house keys. Could you|water the plants and feed the fish?
Okay.|When will you be back?
In three days.
You can take the cotton off now.
"The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up|the spout again." (Endless refrain)
Listen, you can't just|stand your boss up
"whenever you friggin'feel like it,
I'm sorry, Gloria.|I was working,
and I had to see the doctor,
Not another word.|I'm on my way over.
Now?
How about tomorrow|at your office?
I won't stand you up again,
No, it has to be today.|I need that ad campaign.
You live in Number 8, right?|- Yes... I mean no. Number 5.
I'll be right there,
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos:|The secret of the pyramids."
I'm fucking pathetic today.
You look great in black too.
It's in fashion.|Just another uniform.
It looks great on you.|Makes your eyes sparkle.
Must be the contact lenses.
You look just like the girl|in the comm... The commercial!
I've got to come up with a slogan.|- A what?
- A line for an ad.|- For what?
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos.
Those? They're the worst!
I don't need reviews.|I need help.
Any ideas?|- Isn't that your job?
Well, I'm sick,|and I can't think of anything.
It's so easy.|I've got one.
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos.|Pick a peck of pickled peppers."
Are you crazy?
That's their slogan now.|We want to change their image.
Something historical.
I've got it.
"Chile has a pretty name,
but Mexico has the best chilies:
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos."
Not bad.|Not bad at all.
Sit here and watch|the commercial.
The copy's by the computer.|I'll be right back.
I was just borrowing|a cup of sugar.
I forgot the keys.|Hold this a moment.
Have you seen|some keys around?
These?
No, on a Bayer aspirin|key ring.
I watched the commercial,|and now I know what you want.
I have a few ideas.
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos:|For real royal flavor."
"Real" and "royal" - get it?
Not bad, eh?
The other is a slight variation.|See if you like this better.
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos.|A conquest of two worlds."
Perfect.
The other is almost the same.
Where are you going?|- My car's double-parked.
"The best of both worlds."
"The best of both worlds."
What?
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos.
Sorry I took so long|with the slogan.
You know I'm not|usually like that.
I was looking|for something shorter,
something stronger,|something explosive.
The way a haiku achieves|an explosion of images.
- Something more creative.|- Exactly.
Something more|than just a simple slogan.
Have you seen the fish food?|- Over there.
I didn't know you had fish.
They're my pals.|See that one? It's a sawfish.
He's always chasing the guppy.
Cleo here likes dried shrimp,|but I ran out.
You know how|to get them to eat?
Don't they eat by themselves?
What about the ad campaign?
The ad campaign?
Ah, of course.
I left it around here|somewhere.
Where are you going?
Why don't you water the plants|while I get the copy?
No, you're not going anywhere.
- I'm going to my car.|- You don't have a car.
Do you have the campaign or not?|- Yes.
What's wrong?
Wait a minute.|I have to use the bathroom.
What's wrong?
I'll be right back.
The itsy-bitsy spider|climbed up the water spout
Out came the rain|and washed the spider out,
"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos:
A tradition preserved...
and preserves with tradition."
When did you get back?|- I never left.
You know, I thought writing|commercials was a job for idiots,
but it's fun.
- It has its drawbacks.|- Like what?
Like putting up with the boss.
Don't be silly.|We all have a boss to put up with.
But there are bosses...|and then there are bosses.
Why don't you make yourself|more comfortable?
I'm not as easy as you think.
No, of course not.
- When did you come out?|- I never went in.
Here's the campaign|singing the praises
of "Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos,|plus lots of slogans -
Never keep a woman waiting.
What's wrong?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Out came the rain|and washed the spider out,,,
Sylvia, you really look|great in black.
Would you please knock it off?
I'll just knock this off|and we're set.
Let's do this some other time.|It's getting a little tedious.
You animal!
- Condoms?|- Yes.
- You're not on the pill?|- It's not that.
I think I brought some.
Con... dom.
How glor... ious!|- Gloria!
I have to go to the bathroom.
,,, and washed the spider out
Tomorrow.|Let's wait till tomorrow.
Wait a sec!
The best of both worlds!
- Real royal flavor.|- "Real" and "royal" - get it?
Jalapenos!
I have to use the bathroom.
Yes, Mateo.|Sylvia is hot.
The itsy-bitsy spider|climbed up the water spout
Awaken
Sweet love of my life
What a peaceful morning.
You're all ready to go!
Forgive me|for disturbing your dreams
But I couldn't help myself
This bastard is just a myth!
- Where are you going?|- To get the paper.
- Don't leave.|- I have to read my horoscope.
Awaken
Sweet love of my life
- Weren't you in the bathroom?|- I can't go without the paper.
So where is it?
I lent it to my neighbor.|He lends me his lawnmower.
What are you - Houdini?|Disappearing, reappearing!
You left me high and dry.|Why did I even come?
You're all show and no action.|I'm leaving!
These Japanese guys are great!
It's Dr. Mateo and his wife!
- Let me out!|- Don't tell them I was here!
Not a word.|Now let me out!
Mateo, who's this woman?
I don't know. A patient.
Dr. Mateos!
What's she doing here?
- In flagrante,|- That one I know.
Tomas, you didn't mention|we had visitors.
Doctor, can you see me|on Friday?
I don't know.|Speak to my secretary.
Give him an inch and he'll take a mile.|Did you water my plants?
Of course.|What are you doing here?
The air conditioning broke down,|so they moved the conference here.
Did you feed my fish?
They wouldn't eat.|Right, Gloria?
They're not your fish|and this isn't your apartment.
You little shit!
You'll never|do this to me again.
Please forgive me, Doctor.
I'm so ashamed, ma'am.
- The campaign.|- What?
Don't forget the campaign.
This too.
Some mariachis came to serenade,
and a dog barked nonstop.
He had his boss in my apartment|and another woman in his.
His boss left satisfied,|if a bit angry.
But he only managed|to just penetrate the other woman.
Twice.
When Teresa and I arrived,
we caught the corpus delicti|singing in our bed.
Who's his boss?
A patient of mine.|Mrs. Gold. Just imagine!
- And the other woman?|- Some girl who writes slogans.
Hello?
Tomas, do you happen|to know a certain Sylvia?
Sylvia Silva, the nurse.
Don't play dumb with me,
you little shit!
You're fired!
PHYSICIAN'S COPY
TEST RESULTS
HIV - AIDS
NEGATIVE
PATIENT'S COPY
Go pick a peck|of pickled peppers.
That's real royal flavor.
The best of both worlds.
The true conquest.
I'll give you chilies, you bastard!
As|Don Wolfango|said,|I've got|a toothache|in|my|heart.
Shit!
Takeshi's asking|if you've been to Osaka.
Why did you drag me here|with these damn Japs?
You wanted to see me,
and I've got to go sightseeing|with these doctors from the conference.
And they aren't fools.|Takeshi is a genius.
He invented|an electronic contraceptive device.
Audaces fortuna iuvat, man.|- Who taught you all that bullshit?
- The Jesuits. Why?|- Just wondering.
Mateo, I'm in bad shape.|It's not just losing my job.
Something's gotten to me.|- You need some dough?
Don't be a jerk.
It's Clarisa.
Tell me about her.
Neighbors can be trouble.
I know. But I'm in a daze.|I can't stop thinking about her.
I think I'm in love.
You, in love?|Tell me another fairy tale.
All right.
She's a stewardess.|I don't know what airline.
She's engaged to a pilot and moved|in with him. I don't know his name.
They're getting married|next month.
Married?
Yes. If you want to know more,|ask Teresa.
You coming to the Ballet Folklórico?|- Spare me.
Come on. It's great.
Airplanes are kind of cool,|aren't they?
Claustrophobia? Yes,
I felt like opening the door|and jumping,
The man I loved|"was cheating on me,
I was depressed,|"working on a DC-10,
The ocean, the clouds,,,
the plane soaring|through the vast sky,
I swear I felt like jumping.
Luckily, the captain called me -|it was Carlos!
That's great.
If Mateo ever cheats on me,|I'll kill him!
I'll kill the bastard!
At last, Teresa -|I'm in love!
If at first you don't succeed,|try, try again.
No, Teresa,|this is true love.
Tell me about Clarisa.
She's an angel sent to show me|the error of my ways.
She has an inner beauty.|Have you seen her eyes?
They're like -
She would be a true conquest.
By the way,|can you lend me your thermom-
I think you two have met.
Clarisa Negrete...
Tomas Tomas.
- Pleased to meet you.|- The pleasure is mine.
Get me that thermometer,|would you?
You're a stewardess, right?
Flight attendant.
Ah, flight attendant.
Right.
Right.
Beautiful night, isn't it?
Yes, beautiful.
Cool.
Cool.
Here.
I believe this is yours too.
If you'll excuse me.|See you later.
Good night.
Shit!
Sweetheart!
Good morning.
- No one undresses the naked.|- Lend me your robe.
Ah, to be young and foolish.
She must think I'm sick.
You are sick, aren't you?
Shit!
Shit!
Tomas, did you read the paper?
Not yet. Listen, I'm sorry|about yesterday and this morning.
Someone took my robe.
To each his own.
Please don't think I'm crazy,
or that I like to cover up|with sensational headlines.
Adam used a fig leaf.
That's true.
Need help?
Are you in a hurry?|- Not quite the Concorde, but yes.
I just wanted to see if maybe -
You caught me|at a very bad time.
Wait until you've flown|without air conditioning.
Perhaps when -
Clarisa, I swear I'm not|usually like this.
I mean, I am, but -
Look, I'm flying Oaxaca-Merida-|Cancun-Mexico City today.
We'll talk when I get back, okay?|- Sure.
- Do I look all right?|- Great.
It's a captain's hat.|See you.
Here.
Have a good flight.
Excuse me, miss.|I've brought my fecal samples.
Just leave them.
They came out great.
That's what they all say.
- Hello?|- Tomas? Mateo,
Do me a favor,|Take Takeshi and Koyi sightseeing,
Right now?
I can't. I'm busy.
Come on, just this once,
I can't.|I've got things to do.
Hold on a minute,
Nolens volens, Like it or not,|show them around town.
You owe us, and we've had it|up to here with sushi.
- But they don't speak Spanish.|- Use sign language.
I don't have a car.
Take ours.|We'll take a cab to the movies.
- Where should I take them?|- Let's see.
Try "Plaza" Garibaldi.|- Or the Paseo de la Reforma.
- What are you seeing?|- The latest Kurosawa. See you.
Thank God -|a day without flashbulbs!
Anything you'd like to hear, sir?
I fuckin' love broads.|I love 'em.
I can't help it, man.
And you know what? I've been|a real fuckhead with all of 'em.
But what can I do? I'm weak.|What am I supposed to do?
I swear I'm not that way.
I'm not that way, man.
But what can I do?|It's too late. I can't change.
You know what?|For the first time, I'm in love
like a fucking romantic.
And I haven't got|a chance in hell.
And it's not her body, man.
It's what she's awakened in me.
If Clarisa turns me down,
it's harakiri, man.
Harakiri, you understand?
Fucking asshole Jap.
I love you, you fucker.
I fuckin' love you, Takeshi.
There goes my neighbor.
They're making me get married,|but I don't want to.
Castrato.
A big shot, huh?
No, a big hot-shit.
No, big hot sauce!
I'm faking, Tomas.|I'm faking.
What's wrong?
You okay?
What the fuck|are you doing here?
You don't remember?|I was jogging, and you picked me up.
It was all a nightmare.
You're a nightmare.
I'm sick of all you fucking broads,|and all those fuckers,
and the whole fucking world.
There's nothing clean left.
We shit on everything.
Nobody knows where he is|or what he wants.
We're just a bunch of floating shit,|afraid to breathe 'cause we might die.
God should flush us down|once and for all!
- Tomas?|- What do you want?
Where's Lucia?
You must have said something.|She just ran out in a panic.
She couldn't take the truth.|What do you want?
What you did|to Takeshi wasn't right.
What I did to him?
Takeshi's a kamikaze.
You left him at the wrong hotel.
He had to call a cab|and carry Koyi back to their own hotel.
I thought he was staying|at the Nikko.
He said everyone|should drive a Nissan.
Let it be a lesson to him.
- What's wrong with Tomas?|- He's feeling seasick.
"Dizzy" and thirsty.|Completely hung over.
I saw his tests.|It's nothing too serious.
He's got strep.|Penicillin will take care of it.
But I told him to avoid any close|encounters, for health reasons.
I really got him good this time!
For every action|there is an equal|and opposite|reaction.
Newton's Third Law
- I'm going to die!|- Why?
It was positive!|I'm going to die, Paola!
- Does your husband know?|- I just found out myself!
It's Paola,|"How" are you?
Still alive.
There's something|you ought to "know,"
A friend of mine was seeing|an irresponsible guy like you
"who never used a condom,
What's that got to do with me?
The guy has AIDS,
Listen, baby, AIDS and I have got|a bilateral nonaggression pact.
The problem is|I was her husband's lover,
and since you and I got together recently,|you should take precautions.
Thanks for letting me know.
I can tell you a good place|to go for self-hypnosis,
Bye.
This is a message for Dr. Mateos,|extension 4232,
from Tomas Tomas.
Tell him he's an asshole|for not having the balls -
that's with a B -|to tell me I have AIDS!
No, you can't get AIDS|over the phone, ma'am!
Paola.
That bitch!
Dr, Roldan, you dropped|your forceps in the cake,
A message for Dr, Mateos|from Tomas Tomas,'
You're an asshole for not having|the balls - that's with a B -
to tell the poor guy|he has AIDS,
AIDS? Tomas?|What's wrong with him?
Doctor?
Did you look at Tomas's|test results?
Of course.|It's my responsibility.
You didn't find|anything serious, did you?
Nothing. Why?
It's just that I played|a bad joke on him.
I know.
You jiggled the needle|when you drew his blood.
There's more.
I marked his HIV test positive.
Positive!
And I told him to abstain!
No wonder!|He must be living a nightmare!
Lmagine!|That should calm him down a bit!
Calm him down? He's probably|out of his mind right now?
Positive!
AIDS!
Sylvia, why'd you do that|to poor Tomas?
You've been|an asshole, Tomas.
You wasted your time
and your life.
Tomas, it's your mother,
Mom, for Christ's sake!
Watch out with your microwave,|A gringa used hers to kill her dog,
At least the doggie died quickly|and painlessly, Take care,
Ma'am, this is a message|for Dr. Mateos,
extension 4232,|from Tomas Tomas.
Tell him I'm going|to commit suicide in the microwave.
I'll leave the front door open|so they can get in.
Yes, ma'am.
Just like the gringa's|French poodle.

"Gómez" Home-Style Jalapenos:|Pick a peck of pickled peppers."
Message for Dr, Mateos|from Mr, Tomas,'
He's committing suicide|in the microwave,
He'll leave the front door open|so you can get in,
That's going to make|such a mess!
He's going to kill himself|in a microwave!
Just like the gringa's|French poodle.
A stupid life|deserves a stupid death.
- Who's there?|- Clarisa. Your neighbor.
What are you doing?
Committing suicide.
Then... maybe I should|leave you alone.
No, don't.|What can I do for you?
- Nothing, thanks.|- Really - anything you want.
I was wondering...
if you could give me a hand.
A hand? You don't want my hand,|believe me.
- You can't help me?|- Help you? Of course.
Look, there was an unexpected|change of crew in Acapulco,
and I got a shorter route,|so I'm back early.
Carlos is probably still flying.
And I've lost my keys.
- You don't have a spare?|- Yes, on my night table.
Maybe you could get in|by the ledge.
The ledge?
I don't think so.|It's very dangerous.
- You won't do me that favor?|- No. I mean yes!
For you more than anyone.|Better now than never.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
- No, this is wrong.|- Why?
Yeah, why?
We taught him a lesson - fine.
But we've got to stop him|before he does something stupid.
When have you ever|stopped him before?
It doesn't matter.|Let's go save him.
Takeshi, Tomas harakiri.
I'll drive.
- Here are your keys.|- Thanks. Would you like some coffee?
No, I have to finish this.
Well, I mustn't keep you.
Listen...
don't go back|to your apartment.
You won't like what you see.
After clearing 300 dinner trays,
there's nothing like waiting|at home for my captain to land.
I don't think so.
Thanks.
See you later.
Or maybe not, right?
Good luck.
This time you went|too far, Sylvia.
You should control|your impulses.
Ira furor brevis est,|for God's sake!
He's the one|who went too far.
Okay, I jiggled the needle|when I drew his blood,
but that doesn't justify|taking me to his bed
while he had Mrs. Gold|waiting in yours.
That's one point for Sylvia.
And our Casanova gave me|just 20 seconds of his glory -
she got all the rest!
2-0, Matito!
Good-bye, Mateo.
You were stupid|to be jealous of me.
Teresa, what can I say?
"The leopard never|changes his spots."
Take care of yourselves.
Mother, I bid you|a sad farewell,
and thanks for suggesting|this painless way out.
He did it again!
This time with a girl|from Continental!
He said he'd never do it again!|He'll never change!
Continental!
Last time it was United! The girls|from KLM won't look in his direction!
But Continental!
What can I say?|Things don't always turn out right.
But you can start fresh.
Or talk to him.
No, you don't understand.
When we fell in love,|he swore he'd change.
He said we'd be like wolves.
- Wolves?|- Always faithful.
I was his she-wolf|and he was my little wolfey.
This is worse|than an emergency landing.
I want to die!
Come on. You have|a whole life ahead of you.
No, Carlos just killed me!
He clipped my wings.
Forget him.|There are other men.
I don't know what to do.|You don't know how I feel.
I want to shoot myself.
Clarisa, come on.
You're going to commit suicide.|Lend me your oven!
- No, the oven's mine.|- You first, then me.
What if I'm smeared|all over it?
I don't want to die|like that French poodle.
If you put it that way...
I don't want to slash my wrists.
Sleeping pills|mess up my stomach.
They're awful.
I don't want to hang myself.
I want to die in the heavens.
The heavens?
The friendly skies.
Are you serious?
In the air?
Up in the clouds?
Up in the sky?
Flying like a bird...
on the wings of freedom.
- Would you like company?|- Why not?
The Latin American Tower.
The Latin American Tower?
Let me explain!
Nancy has nothing|to do with us.
Nancy from Continental!
Who's next?|Debbie from Delta?
Nancy jumped|into my taxi and -
What's wrong with your car?
A message for Dr. Mateos,|extension 4232,
from Tomas Tomas:
"Forget the microwave. We're jumping|off the Latin American Tower."
Mind your own business, ma'am!
Let's go!
Higher, faster, stronger.
Olympic slogan.
Why do you want|to commit suicide?
I have AIDS.
"I'll leave the front door open|so you can get in."
Use the ledge.
The ledge?|Are you crazy?
You brought us here.|You get him out.
"My little wolfey."
A sly fox!
They're all disgusting.
Who?
Bed-hopping bastards
always looking|for something new and different.
That's not what's important.
I think Sylvia ought to go.
No way.|I'm wearing high heels.
Come on, Matito. Do it for Tomas.|You can do it.
Where there's a will,|there's a way.
Right.
"Row, row, row" your boat|gently "down" the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily|Life is but a dream
Tomas, ad damnum|adderetur injuria,
Motherfucker!
I'm disgusting.
What?
I'm disgusting.
,,, life is but a dream
Message for Dr, Mateos,'
Forget the microwave, He's jumping|off the Latin American Tower,
I say let the rude creep jump!
It's like when you're a kid
and you step|on every insect you see.
You don't know why,|but you like that crunch.
It's wrong...
but you keep on doing it.
The poor things.
You grow up,|but you keep doing the same thing -
only now|it's people you step on.
It's wrong.|Totally wrong.
And I kept right on|stepping on others
until something bigger|stepped on me.
Is he dead?
It's Carlos, your neighbor.
Tomas is jumping|off the Latin American Tower!
It's a sad night.
And cold too.
Not a star in sight.
Only those down below.
The lights.
They say time stops at night...
and everything stands still.
Still.
What time is it?
I can't tell.|The clock's down there.
It doesn't matter.|There's no more time.
- We wasted so much time.|- What do you mean?
- In life.|- You think?
We could have -|I don't know.
What? Met before?
Martita too?
What's that?
Tomas's curriculum vitae,
I wouldn't be surprised|to find my mother's name here.
I know someone on this list.
Teresa de Teresa...
de Mateos!
Let bygones be bygones.
What an abyssus abyssum invocat,|for crying out loud!
Past loves are like empty glasses.
It was before I met you.
Need I remind you of Patricia|from Applied Pathology 101?
You better|quieta non movere!
No use crying|over spilt milk, Matito.
Quod Deus conjunxit,|homo non separet,
That's right.
What God has joined,|let no man put asunder.
If you leave me,|I'll kill myself.
We're putting an end|to the abyss of life.
All that remains|is the abyss below.
And the abyss of death.
And the abyss between us?
Between us?
Don't you think|there's an abyss?
Not at all.
You feel an abyss between us?
A very small one.
I can't.
I could infect you.
What does it matter now?
Has anyone jumped?
Has anyone jumped?|- Jumped?
Clarisa's underwear.
I think it was|during the storm of '61
that a lovelorn young lady
jumped off with a depressed|young man she hardly knew.
No, Matito, don't!
EMERGENCY STAIRCASE
During that same storm,
the statue of Diana the Huntress|was found wearing a bra
reported to belong|to a famous actress.
It looks like a long way down,|but it's very close.
- Don't let go of my hand.|- Never.
Your hand is cold.
Listen...
don't let go of my hand|after we jump.
I'll try.
Tomas, you don't have AIDS!
I do!|I saw the test results!
No, I made it all up!|I swear!
She's right!|They were negative!
Sylvia marked them positive!
Clarisa, forgive me|for the Nancy thing!
Go howl at the moon,|you were-wolf!
I can't marry you!|I'm going through a selfish period!
I need my freedom!
Then fly away, you vulture!
Then why did you tell me|to stay away from women?
You have white spots|on your throat!
Penicillin will cure them!
Clarisa, don't jump!
Don't ever leave me.
Never.|If you leave me, I'll kill you.
For those sick of life,|love is the cure.
How much?
