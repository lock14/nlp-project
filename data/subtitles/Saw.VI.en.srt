1
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:45,134
Help!

2
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,975
- Eddie!
- What?

3
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,186
Eddie! Wake up!

4
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,479
- Don't move. Okay, Listen to me.
- Where are we?

5
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:00,691
- Whatever you do, don't lean forward.
- What's this? What's...

6
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,569
- What's going on?
- No!

7
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:13,913
Hello. I want to play a game.

8
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:20,920
The devices on your heads are symbolic of
the shackles that you place upon others.

9
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:25,508
You recklessly loan people money,
knowing their financial limitations,

10
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:29,971
counting on repossessing more
than they could ever pay back.

11
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:34,933
You are predators, but
today, you become the prey.

12
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:38,437
And it is your own pound
of flesh that I demand.

13
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:39,605
This is your fault!

14
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:42,984
The scale before you is
your only path to freedom.

15
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,945
However, only one of you may pass,

16
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:50,616
and the toll is the ultimate sacrifice,

17
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,951
the sacrifice of flesh.

18
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:57,790
Before you are the instruments
to exact this flesh.

19
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,417
Move with haste, though,

20
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:02,586
for when the 60-second timer hits zero,

21
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:07,133
the one who has given the most
flesh will release their bindings,

22
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:12,806
while the gears on your opponent's
head will engage, piercing their skull.

23
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,102
Who will offer the most flesh
order to save their life?

24
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:18,812
The choice is yours.

25
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:19,896
No!

26
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:33,993
I'm not dying for you, bitch!

27
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,379
No!

28
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:33,590
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,

29
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,802
have you learned enough to trust me?

30
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:41,848
For if you do not, this room
will forever be your tomb.

31
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:46,269
You will never be heard from again,
your body will never be found,

32
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:48,646
and my legacy will become yours.

33
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:50,899
Make your choice.

34
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:07,684
There was a pre-existing condition,

35
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,519
which you did not inform
your insurance company of.

36
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:15,692
Thank you.

37
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:23,783
Hey, babe. Good. Listen, I am so,
so sorry, but I can't make dinner.

38
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,247
I've got to work late again.
well, I've got to meet with legal,

39
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:33,710
and that's going to jam me up for,
certainly, the rest of the afternoon.

40
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,091
I know it's your birthday. I'm going
to make it up to you, I promise.

41
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:44,721
Love you.

42
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:51,101
- What were we talking about?
- We're talking about your deposition.

43
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:52,312
Don't worry about me, Debbie.

44
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,397
Some small-time lawyer
trying to squeeze us

45
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:56,441
is not gonna get me to say
anything I don't want to say.

46
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:57,775
I have no doubt about that,

47
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,236
but as lead counsel for this company,
if you screw up, it comes down on my ass.

48
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:04,323
So what do you say we
prep your deposition?

49
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,741
Christ.

50
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:07,869
Do you remember dealing
with a Mr. Harold Abbott?

51
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:10,205
William, I have a Casey
Patterson on line 1.

52
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:14,000
Take another message, Addy.
I'll get back to her this week.

53
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,336
Some time. Keep going.

54
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:19,630
When opposing counsel asks you about
Mr. Abbott, how will you respond?

55
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:21,548
I am going to respond by saying,

56
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:24,510
as Senior Vice President
of Membership and Claims,

57
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:27,514
it is my job to review
every terminated policy.

58
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:30,182
As a matter of fact, Mr. Abbott
was sitting right where you are now

59
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:32,268
when we discussed his appeal.

60
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,272
I just... I don't get it.

61
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,274
I've been with this insurance
company for over 10 years.

62
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,611
I know, Harold. But, unfortunately,
when we reviewed your claim,

63
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:45,615
we discovered that you failed
to mention a previous condition.

64
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,409
What condition? There was no condition.

65
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,206
It says here you had oral surgery
to remove a cyst from yourjaw.

66
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:55,290
This is absurd! I have heart disease.

67
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,211
It has nothing to do with some
oral surgery I had 30 years ago.

68
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:01,548
Any type of oral surgery is
going to leave scar tissue.

69
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:03,341
Scar tissue can lead to gum disease.

70
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:07,095
And, as you well know, gum
disease can cause heart disease.

71
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:10,514
You know what? You're...
You're a criminal.

72
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,476
You are a goddamn criminal.

73
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:19,231
I paid my monthly premium for 10
years without so much as a cold.

74
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:22,067
And now that I'm actually sick,
you're going to deny my coverage?

75
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:25,154
- I have a family!
- Those are the rules, Harold.

76
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,408
I'm sorry, but your own
actions have caused this.

77
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:34,748
You've just given me a death sentence.
I mean, who's going to cover me now?

78
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,499
You just killed me.

79
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:42,379
I have family, too, so I can
empathize with his argument.

80
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,423
But, basically, the guy
lied on his application.

81
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:47,427
- Hey. Watch it, Will.
- What?

82
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,928
Do you think he did that on purpose?

83
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,722
All right.

84
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:55,684
It wasn't my job to assess
what his intentions were.

85
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:58,270
It was my job to check
the accuracy of his claim.

86
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,440
Look, everybody thinks
we're the bad guys.

87
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:04,110
Nobody mentions the millions of
people help every year without incident

88
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:07,739
or the millions of dollars we
donate to charity every year

89
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:09,532
or all the free clinics we support.

90
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:12,326
- Short answers, Will. Short answers.
- Today in probate court,

91
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,538
the assets for one of history's most
notorious serial killers, John Kramer,

92
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:17,916
were distributed.

93
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,461
They were mainly in real estate
holdings. But in my time researching...

94
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:24,963
One more question. Who found
the error on his application?

95
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:28,551
The dog pit. They work as a team.

96
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,014
If there's a discrepancy to be found in an
application, the six of them will find it.

97
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,308
Sir, they're waiting for
you in the conference room.

98
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:37,434
Very good.

99
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:41,147
- How's it going today, people?
- Great, Mr. E.

100
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:44,692
Found two application errors
for a chronically ill client.

101
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:47,153
This guy practically lives
at his doctor's office.

102
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:49,989
I mean, this could probably save
us nearly 200K over his lifetime.

103
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:51,490
Terminator strikes again.

104
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:53,743
I'll be back in a few hours.

105
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:55,870
Looking good, Hank.

106
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:02,335
Who will offer the most flesh
in order to save their life?

107
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:04,129
The choice is yours.

108
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:06,548
I'm not dying for you, bitch!

109
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:17,975
Yeah.

110
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:21,062
I'm on my way.

111
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:36,369
What's going on?

112
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:39,788
Feds who took over the crime
scene are requesting you ASAP.

113
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:52,677
Erickson.

114
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:56,556
I didn't know you ever made
it out from behind the desk.

115
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,643
I make exceptions when fingerprints
are found at a Jigsaw murder scene.

116
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,147
Have a look.

117
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:09,318
We also got a right index off the scale.

118
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:13,822
- Been ID'd yet?
- Yeah. They're Agent Strahm's.

119
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:19,203
When I learned that he and Perez
were being targeted by Jigsaw,

120
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:23,082
I should have been more aware.
But I didn't see this coming.

121
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,417
Not from Peter Strahm.

122
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:27,003
- It was a shock to all of us.
- Yeah.

123
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:31,674
But we have something
he doesn't know about.

124
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:35,720
You want to follow me?

125
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,769
Lindsey.

126
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:49,484
- Detective Hoffman.
- Perez.

127
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:55,990
It was my call, Detective.

128
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:57,783
I knew that Jigsaw wasn't working alone,

129
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:00,327
but until I knew for
certain who was helping him,

130
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,621
I couldn't guarantee her well-being.

131
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:07,210
- So you let me think she was dead?
- well, I didn't know who I could trust.

132
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:11,130
What else have you been keeping from me?

133
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:14,509
We know that Agent Strahm knew the
five people in the real estate scam,

134
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,720
the victims from the
traps that Erickson found.

135
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,888
- How'd he know them?
- Strahm and I investigated them

136
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:20,097
after the house fire.

137
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:22,725
It was arson and all five
people were accountable.

138
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,479
But after our lone witness went
missing, no charges were ever filed.

139
00:14:27,273 --> 00:14:29,899
Strahm couldn't let them get
away, so he put them in a trap

140
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:32,317
in which slaughtering each
other was the only way out.

141
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,153
So, what are you telling
me, he's a vigilante?

142
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:37,282
Call him whatever you like,
but he has to be found.

143
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,331
We'd like to work together on this.

144
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:48,000
You led me to believe that she was
dead, and you want to work with me?

145
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,586
Look, we're offering full
disclosure, Detective.

146
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:54,631
From now on, everything we
know, you know. Is that fair?

147
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,976
Detective Hoffman,
how about a quick word?

148
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:09,022
Pamela Jenkins, the resident
Jigsaw sensationalist.

149
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:10,565
Just reporting the facts, Detective.

150
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:15,028
Is that what you're doing? "John
Kramer, conundrum of carnage. "

151
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,653
If you'd like to make a
statement on the record,

152
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,197
I'd be more than happy to take it.

153
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:22,076
You know, twisting the facts to
make a better story is irresponsible.

154
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,370
Excuse me. Nice catching up.

155
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:27,749
I know more about John
Kramer than you might think.

156
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,583
Somehow I doubt that.

157
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:33,462
Kramer left his wife a box in
his will. Did you know that?

158
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:36,298
Maybe I did, maybe I
didn't. How do you know it?

159
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:39,677
Probate court. It's public record
for those who know where to look.

160
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:42,346
All right. What do you really want?

161
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:47,519
Jill Tuck. Help me get to her and
I'll dial down on the sensationalism.

162
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:50,980
Really? I'll see what I can do.

163
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,533
Do you remember how you
were transported there?

164
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,827
I don't know how I got there.

165
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:10,958
Just opened my eyes
and... He did this to me.

166
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:13,128
Who did this?

167
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,255
Jigsaw.

168
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,552
- You didn't cut your own arm off?
- I did. I did.

169
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,263
But he made me do it.

170
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:25,597
And why is that?

171
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:29,184
Because what Eddie and
I were doing was wrong.

172
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:34,024
We were... We were
ruining people's lives.

173
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:40,947
And he wanted us to learn.

174
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,325
And did you?

175
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:47,620
Look at me.

176
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,915
Look at my goddamn arm!

177
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,128
What the fuck am I supposed
to learn from this, huh?

178
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:59,466
Look at my arm! What... What am
I supposed to learn from this?

179
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:01,009
- Just breathe.
- Look at me!

180
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,642
Hello, Gideon.

181
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,271
- It's a good name, hon.
- wow.wow.

182
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:17,942
Could have been Scarlet.
But, no, has to be a boy.

183
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:21,237
Let me see if I can get
all three of us in there.

184
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:26,076
Snuggle around here.
Lean inside. There we go.

185
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:28,952
- There We are.
- Hey, Gideon.

186
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,330
Here's a little happy family.

187
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:33,750
- We love you, Son. We're waiting for you.
- We love you.

188
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:47,262
Gideon, Gideon, Gideon.

189
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:51,768
If you're watching this, Jill,
I'm long gone from this world.

190
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:58,566
I'm leaving you a box today, and
its contents are of grave importance.

191
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,942
Hello. I'm not in right now,
but please leave a message.

192
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:43,987
Miss Tuck, this is Pamela
Jenkins calling, yet again.

193
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,823
I was hoping you can clear some
things up for me about your husband.

194
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,407
Let me buy you lunch or a cup of coffee.

195
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:51,536
I've found something interesting
about John Kramer's death.

196
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:54,038
Are you there, Detective?

197
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:59,501
By hearing this tape, you will
likely assume this is over.

198
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:03,088
You feel you now have
control, don't you?

199
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,676
You think you will walk away untested.

200
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:14,433
Look here.

201
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:18,605
These are the Jigsaw pieces
cut from previous victims.

202
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:24,027
This is the piece taken
from the latest victim.

203
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:28,239
- It looks like all the rest.
- Yeah, that's what we said, too.

204
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:32,661
The skin abrasions, they're indicative
of a knife with a partially serrated edge.

205
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,707
- So?
- So, all of the other cuts were made

206
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,834
with a near-perfect
blade of surgical quality.

207
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,714
Obviously, Strahm used a
different knife than John Kramer.

208
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,635
Right. But it got us curious, so
we pulled the files to compare.

209
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,262
That same knife was used
on only one other victim.

210
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:54,098
And that victim was Seth Baxter,

211
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:56,851
the man who killed your sister.

212
00:19:57,894 --> 00:20:02,272
You're telling me that you can tell a
different knife was used from a photo?

213
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:06,277
No, but I can. I was the
one who examined that body.

214
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,655
I've examined every victim
of the Jigsaw Killer.

215
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,824
Good work.

216
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:15,161
The tape from the latest victim was missing,
so we're looking into the Seth Baxter tape.

217
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:18,789
- Why's that?
- well, if a different person cut the piece,

218
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:22,001
then maybe a different
person made the tape, too.

219
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,005
- Strahm?
- Yeah, maybe.

220
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:27,965
Strahm's voice on that tape
would be our smoking gun.

221
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:31,344
If we had that, we'd go
public with his involvement.

222
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:37,892
Hey, Jill.

223
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:43,480
- But that's not what the prescription...
- I'm sick!

224
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:46,026
- Look at me! Look at me!
- Hey. It's okay. Sorry.

225
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:05,920
I didn't expect to see you here so soon.

226
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:08,298
Change of plans.

227
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:13,303
- The game begins tonight.
- Why?

228
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,056
Because somebody knows
about the box that shouldn't.

229
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,016
- Who?
- That's not your concern.

230
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:22,729
All you need to know is that from now
on, I control all aspects of the game.

231
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,647
That's not what John wanted.

232
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:29,486
Give me the envelopes.
And that's not a request.

233
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:41,205
Here.

234
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,377
From now on, I work alone.

235
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:50,839
I know. I'm only carrying
out John's final request.

236
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:54,176
well, John's dead. And
his work is almost done.

237
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:01,267
- Who's this?
- Unfinished business.

238
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:09,233
When I'm done, we no longer speak.

239
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:19,702
- ... forty-five minutes.
- Yes, I understand that.

240
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:21,371
- Please! Please.
- But we have to wait for the doctor.

241
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,038
Let my hand go.

242
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:29,045
Methadone is a masking agent. It
doesn't heal, it simply numbs the senses.

243
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:32,589
I've found a better way.

244
00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:40,056
These people, they will continue
to hurt you and let you down.

245
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:43,143
They're addicts, John.
Recovery is a process.

246
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:46,479
Maybe addiction's just
part of human nature.

247
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:51,859
But what about these people, Jill,
who come here every day and use you?

248
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:56,655
They bide their time. They're
avoiding prison sentences.

249
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,410
They're getting hooked on masking
agents. Do you call that recovery?

250
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:02,119
It's not that simple.

251
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:06,415
Addiction is not simple, Jill! Wake up!

252
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:13,464
These people have no respect for
the lives that they're destroying.

253
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:17,259
Once you see death up close,

254
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:24,267
then you know what the value of life is.

255
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,688
And that's my way.

256
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,776
And I brought proof that it works.

257
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:43,619
- Amanda?
- Hello, Jill.

258
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:47,499
Jill,

259
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:53,712
you once told me that
she was a lost soul.

260
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:57,884
But here she stands.

261
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,637
She's clean and whole.

262
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:07,685
And she has a new
appreciation for her life.

263
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:12,816
It works. It's real. He helped me.

264
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:34,128
...as this is not just the
macabre conjectures of a psychic,

265
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:38,008
but a foregone conclusion just
waiting to rear its ugly head.

266
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:43,680
Even though police would have you
believe John Kramer, aka Jigsaw, is dead,

267
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:48,434
just this past week a new so-called
game was discovered with grisly results.

268
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,436
Victims have included anyone associated

269
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,772
with the life of John
Kramer, however remote.

270
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:58,028
The Jigsaw Killer may be
dead, but the murders continue.

271
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:08,747
Shit!

272
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,501
Hank, you still here?

273
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:49,078
Don't fucking move.

274
00:25:57,253 --> 00:25:59,881
Shit! Oh, fuck! Okay.

275
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,219
Okay, I'm gonna take care of you. Just...
Where'd you get hit? You wearing a vest?

276
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:46,051
Hello, William.

277
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:47,554
Oh, Jesus.

278
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:51,682
You've probably been wondering
when we would see each other again.

279
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:54,394
- Today is that day.
- No!

280
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:59,398
For years, your probability formula
has decided the fate of others.

281
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:00,775
The healthy have benefited

282
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:04,738
while the potentially sick
have been unjustly rejected.

283
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:09,534
However, this formula does not take
into account the human will to live.

284
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:11,076
When faced with death,

285
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:16,040
who should live versus who will live
are two entirely separate things.

286
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:19,336
Today, your policy
will be put to the test.

287
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,465
There are four straps around your limbs,
and you have four tests you must complete,

288
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:30,262
for if you don't, the straps on
your arms and legs will detonate.

289
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,267
Look closely.

290
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:39,439
Oh, shit!

291
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:44,736
You have 60 minutes to complete your
tests and avoid this fate, starting now.

292
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:47,989
You are not alone in this game.

293
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:50,950
Just as you have taken loved
ones away from their families,

294
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,869
if you don't reach the end
before the timer hits zero,

295
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:56,247
you will never see your family again.

296
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:04,588
Mom? Mom! Mom. Mom, wake up! Mom.

297
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:08,718
Mom.

298
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:12,055
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

299
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:15,224
- What is this?
- I don't know! Look.

300
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,106
Oh, my God.

301
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,069
Here is your first test.

302
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:32,575
Your health and hereditary background put
you in the highest category of success.

303
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,203
However, the same cannot
be said for your adversary.

304
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,711
While only 52 years of age,
this man has continued to smoke

305
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:47,257
even though he has a history of high
blood pressure and heart disease.

306
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,302
This demonstrates very little appreciation
for the blessings of his own life.

307
00:28:52,387 --> 00:28:57,267
Your game will focus on
the simple element of air.

308
00:28:57,351 --> 00:29:01,229
Once this game begins,
every time you take a breath,

309
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:05,733
the clamps around your chest
will close in and crush your body.

310
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:09,778
The only escape is in
the other's failure.

311
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:13,700
So I ask you, when faced
with death, who will survive?

312
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:18,788
Live or die, William. Make your choice.

313
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,666
- Fuck you!
- Who the hell is that?

314
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:30,299
Hold your breath!

315
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:23,663
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus!

316
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:57,989
Come on! Come on!

317
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,124
Shit!

318
00:32:16,592 --> 00:32:18,593
Please help us!

319
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:23,222
Help us! Someone,
please! Please! Help us!

320
00:32:23,682 --> 00:32:29,520
Somebody, please! Please!
Please, somebody help!

321
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:31,980
Anybody?

322
00:32:32,232 --> 00:32:35,026
"Live. Die. " What the fuck?

323
00:32:38,114 --> 00:32:40,155
It's connected to that.

324
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:49,665
- "H-F." What does that stand
for? - Hydrofluoric acid.

325
00:32:53,128 --> 00:32:56,923
This stuff will eat through
human flesh within seconds.

326
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,260
- What should we do?
- Pull the lever. You want to live, don't you?

327
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:04,513
What about the timer?
That has to mean something.

328
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:08,393
I don't know. I don't
even know why we're here.

329
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:11,563
We're here because of your father.

330
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:00,987
Miss Jenkins.

331
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:03,948
Please, this will only take a
second. We can help each other.

332
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:06,284
What makes you think you can
just come to my door like this?

333
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:09,496
Because I found something
you'll want to see.

334
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:11,498
Go on.

335
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:19,547
- Where'd you get this?
- It was at the location where John died.

336
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:22,092
- Does it mean anything to you?
- No.

337
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,135
Goodbye, Miss Jenkins.

338
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:31,976
If you think of anything.

339
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:34,371
I want to thank you for
sponsoring this party, William.

340
00:35:34,456 --> 00:35:37,583
And I know how much the
clinic appreciates it.

341
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:40,420
- John Kramer.
- William Easton.

342
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:43,047
- Kramer? You're Jill's husband, right?
- I am.

343
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:45,842
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

344
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,219
Sounds like we'rw in a
similar business, John.

345
00:35:48,304 --> 00:35:49,346
Oh, yeah? How's that?

346
00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:52,724
well, you try to predict
people's behavior. So do I.

347
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:56,101
When people come to us for coverage,

348
00:35:56,186 --> 00:36:00,023
we have to analyze each person
for the probability of success.

349
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:02,525
- How do you do that?
- well, it's a formula.

350
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,985
It's pretty complicated, actually,

351
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,530
but, in essence, it breaks
down to monthly payments

352
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:10,867
multiplied by lifespan minus
the probability of illness.

353
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:14,119
And if the sum is positive,
we consider coverage.

354
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:19,541
- Who devised that formula?
- Me.

355
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:24,630
So, in a sense, you
choose who lives or dies.

356
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:30,219
No. I... No, I'd say I decide
which people have the potential

357
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:37,226
But you're not taking into consideration
the most important human element of all.

358
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:40,230
- Which is what?
- The will to live.

359
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:43,983
Until a person is faced with death,

360
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,030
it's impossible to tell whether
they have what it takes to survive.

361
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,751
Fuck that.

362
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:47,172
Shit.

363
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,155
Hello, William.

364
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:17,702
Standing on the platforms behind
me are two of your colleagues.

365
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:22,623
One, your file clerk, a young,
healthy male with no living relatives.

366
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:29,172
The other, a middle-aged woman
with a family history of diabetes.

367
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,677
According to your policy, your
secretary is older and weaker

368
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:37,847
and therefore less worthy to survive.

369
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,643
But you know the loss that
she will be to her family,

370
00:38:41,726 --> 00:38:46,523
while young Allen will disappear
without a blip on the world's radar.

371
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:53,237
Only one can exit this room, and
the choice of whom falls upon you.

372
00:38:54,572 --> 00:38:58,326
You must let go of one to
save the life of the other.

373
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:00,954
As you can see, the
choice is not so clear

374
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:05,666
when you are face to face with the
people whose blood will stain your hands.

375
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:08,545
Let the game begin.

376
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:16,260
Wait! No! No, wait! I won't
do this! I won't do this!

377
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,646
William!

378
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:31,275
It's a business! My decisions
aren't made this way!

379
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:37,239
No, I'm not gonna do
it! I'm not gonna do it!

380
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:39,242
I'm not gonna do it!

381
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,291
- Stop!
- Please! Help me!

382
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:11,775
- I'm sorry.
- No! No!

383
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:21,284
I'm sorry.

384
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,240
Thank you. Thank you!

385
00:41:06,706 --> 00:41:11,751
You try to find a way out of here,
Addy. I have to keep going. Be careful.

386
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,076
What if we put acid on the metal bars?
It'll eat through the metal, won't it?

387
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:48,746
Yeah, but how are we going to get
it on the bars? With our hands?

388
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,626
What are you looking at?

389
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,547
I wonder... The mirror.

390
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:02,969
- What?
- Who's behind the glass?

391
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:07,639
What do you want?

392
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:12,103
Why are you doing this?

393
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:18,025
Help me, please! Please, help me!

394
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:37,461
Hello, Pamela. You've
sensationalized my life,

395
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:41,840
twisting the truth and exploiting
my message for your own benefit.

396
00:43:07,994 --> 00:43:09,952
- Hoffman.
- It's Erickson.

397
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:13,873
- We found the Seth Baxter tape.
- Yeah?

398
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,918
But there was something else that
we wanted to discuss with you.

399
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,463
- What's that?
- Better to talk about it in person.

400
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:22,297
It's time-sensitive.

401
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,842
I'll be right there.

402
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,650
Excuse me.

403
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,487
- Just down there.
- Thank you.

404
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,597
The device Timothy is strapped to is my
personal favorite. I call it The Rack.

405
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:25,527
Last-minute tweaks? Told
you he'd fuck with it.

406
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:27,447
If you switch the gear ratio,

407
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,659
you have to change the gear grease
to match the increased friction.

408
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:35,789
Maybe you should stick
to the heavy lifting.

409
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,041
You need five-weight.

410
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:41,210
It's in the gun.

411
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,838
Check with me next time.

412
00:44:45,257 --> 00:44:47,007
How many next times are there gonna be?

413
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:49,677
However many there needs to be.

414
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,063
That's a human being.

415
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,487
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

416
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,657
Let's be honest. You want him
to suffer just as much as I do.

417
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:39,184
- So when's your test, Detective?
- I don't need one.

418
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:41,646
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

419
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:46,108
Because I didn't take
my life for granted.

420
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:50,030
You're still dragging your
knuckles on the ground.

421
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,072
What do you know about life?

422
00:45:58,331 --> 00:46:02,291
Get used to me, 'cause
I'm not going anywhere.

423
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,755
You sure about that?

424
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:11,760
Time is short.

425
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:18,891
You okay?

426
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:25,398
Now it's time to go get Dr.
Denlon from the hospital.

427
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:28,902
Okay. I'll take you back.

428
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:57,222
Go. Be quick.

429
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:12,737
- Why'd you come?
- John, please stop.

430
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:16,365
- Don't do this.
- I promise you,

431
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,996
when all this is done,

432
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,626
I will provide a way out for you.

433
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,213
I wish that time was now.

434
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,842
Then I have something for you.

435
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,233
What's this for?

436
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:58,407
When the time's right, you'll
know what to do with it.

437
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:29,271
Shit!

438
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,786
I came to talk to you, Will, because

439
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:49,793
I've found a treatment for my cancer
that I think holds a lot of promise.

440
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:52,003
But my requests for coverage

441
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,382
- have all been turned down.
- Yeah.

442
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:59,177
So I was hoping that if I
came and explained it to you,

443
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,639
that you might be able to
get that overturned for me.

444
00:49:05,518 --> 00:49:08,811
- well, the buck stops here, John. Fire away.
- Okay.

445
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,942
This is a doctor in Norway.

446
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:18,612
He's got a 30 to 40% success
rate with gene therapy.

447
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:24,077
He injects what he calls suicide
genes into cancerous tumor cells.

448
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,496
Then an inactive form of a
toxic drug is administered...

449
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:30,833
Yes. I'm familiar with the
therapy you're talking about.

450
00:49:30,918 --> 00:49:33,961
Right. And a new trial's starting.

451
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:35,588
He's looking for new patients,

452
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,798
and he seems to think that
I'm the perfect candidate.

453
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:41,885
John, if your primary physician, Dr. Gordon,
thought you were a suitable candidate,

454
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,389
- he would have pursued it.
- No.

455
00:49:44,472 --> 00:49:47,891
Dr. Gordon is a specialist. You know,
he's making money on his specialty.

456
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:49,601
He's not a thinker.

457
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,731
I mean, the man has his hand on the
doorknob half the time that I'm there.

458
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:56,443
I'm gonna be straight with you. At your
age and with the development of your cancer,

459
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,277
it's simply not feasible
for Umbrella Health...

460
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's not feasible?

461
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:05,242
By whose mathematical
equation is this not feasible?

462
00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:08,288
It's policy, John. It's policy.

463
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,041
And if you go outside the system
and seek out this treatment,

464
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:16,086
which has been deemed ineffective,
you will be in breach of policy

465
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:21,050
I'm sorry.

466
00:50:32,355 --> 00:50:34,230
Did you know that in the Far East,

467
00:50:34,315 --> 00:50:37,067
people pay their doctors
when they're healthy?

468
00:50:38,027 --> 00:50:41,070
When they're sick, they
don't have to pay them.

469
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:45,699
So, basically, they end up
paying for what they want,

470
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:47,786
not what they don't want.

471
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:51,748
We got it all ass-backwards here.

472
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:58,170
These politicians, they say the same
thing over and over and over again.

473
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:02,217
"Healthcare decisions should be
made by doctors and their patients,

474
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,510
"not by the government. "

475
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:07,137
well, now I know they're not
made by doctors and their patients

476
00:51:07,222 --> 00:51:09,014
or by the government.

477
00:51:10,393 --> 00:51:13,478
They're made by the
fucking insurance companies.

478
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:16,188
Piranha.

479
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:23,612
John, please. If you do
this, you'll be on your own,

480
00:51:23,697 --> 00:51:25,990
and the subsequent cost
to you will be staggering.

481
00:51:26,074 --> 00:51:29,494
Don't talk to me about
money. I have money.

482
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,039
This is about principle.

483
00:51:37,085 --> 00:51:41,547
You see, Will, this is my
life we're talking about.

484
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,800
- You remember?
- What about Jill's life?

485
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:45,385
How's she going to be taken
care of when you're gone?

486
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,469
Let me worry about Jill.

487
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:51,849
The type of cancer you have
is malignant and inoperable.

488
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:53,809
That rolled off your tongue real smooth.

489
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:56,855
Even if the treatment works, the
cancer will return eventually.

490
00:51:56,938 --> 00:52:00,400
- It's an unwinnable battle.
- That was even smoother.

491
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:03,485
As a matter of fact,
that was downright slick.

492
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:09,326
You think it's the living who will
have ultimate judgment over you,

493
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:12,954
because the dead will have
no claim over your soul,

494
00:52:23,382 --> 00:52:25,342
but you may be mistaken.

495
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,400
Oh, shit!

496
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:54,871
Hello, William. You have
seen the flaws in your policy.

497
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:58,666
But what you have not seen is
the extent some people will go to

498
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,626
when faced with death.

499
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,757
The lawyer from your firm has...

500
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,259
- Debbie!
- ... 90 seconds to cross this room

501
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:12,597
or the device attached to her chest
will discharge and pierce her brain.

502
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:15,391
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

503
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:19,728
She will find that the journey across
this room is filled with danger.

504
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:25,193
In order for her to make it, you
will need to be there for her,

505
00:53:25,277 --> 00:53:29,864
and it is you who ultimately
holds the key to her survival.

506
00:53:31,534 --> 00:53:35,077
When faced with death, will
she have the skills to live?

507
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:37,579
Let the game begin.

508
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:42,168
Okay. Okay, Listen!

509
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,963
- Jesus Christ! What the fuck is this?
- Debbie! Debbie! Listen to me!

510
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:48,048
- Debbie! Okay, Debbie, Listen to me! Debbie!
- What is this?

511
00:53:49,135 --> 00:53:50,677
- Get me the fuck out of herw!
- Get through the maze

512
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,262
as fast as you can. Listen to me!

513
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:54,304
- Get me out of herw!
- Debbie!

514
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:59,978
Okay. You've got to get through this maze
as fast as you can! Go! Move now! Go now!

515
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,985
Come on! You can make it! You can
make it! You got to keep moving! Go!

516
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:11,030
- Will, this is insane! I can't!
- Go! You can make it!

517
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:14,284
Come on! You can make it!
You've got to keep moving!

518
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:22,250
Wait a minute! I think
I can help you up here!

519
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:24,293
Maybe this will stop it!

520
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,590
Yes! Yes!

521
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:32,385
Do it again! It worked! It worked!

522
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,597
- Do it again! It worked, it worked, it worked!
- Okay! Ready?

523
00:54:35,681 --> 00:54:37,766
- Yes!
- Go!

524
00:54:53,865 --> 00:54:58,327
Keep moving! Don't stop! Keep
going! Keep going! Keep going!

525
00:54:59,413 --> 00:55:00,789
Don't stop!

526
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:06,335
You gotta keep going!
Keep going! Go! Go!

527
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,340
Keep moving! Go! Go! Go!

528
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:16,179
Fuck, I can't! It's a fucking
trap! There's no way out!

529
00:55:18,139 --> 00:55:20,349
It's a fucking trap! I can't!

530
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:28,525
No! No, there's a ladder at the
end! So just go under! I'll help you!

531
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,985
Ready?

532
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:35,489
Go!

533
00:55:55,135 --> 00:56:00,431
God! Come on, Debbie, go! Climb! Climb!

534
00:56:01,516 --> 00:56:05,228
Come on! Come on, you're almost
there! You're almost there!

535
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:08,565
Go! Go! Go!

536
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:14,153
Okay, look for a key. There's
got to be a key! Look for a key!

537
00:56:16,824 --> 00:56:18,032
What?

538
00:56:19,952 --> 00:56:21,827
What are you waiting for?

539
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:24,121
- It's in you.
- What?

540
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:27,333
- It's fucking inside you!
- Oh, fuck!

541
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:34,590
Okay. Okay, I can do this. Wait!

542
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,762
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I need that fucking key!

543
00:56:57,822 --> 00:57:00,949
I can get it! I can
get it! I can get it!

544
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:07,791
God! No! God! No!

545
00:57:34,025 --> 00:57:35,527
Hello, Pamela.

546
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:41,699
Well, today you will experience
the meaning of sacrifice.

547
00:57:41,784 --> 00:57:46,413
And you will see the consequence
for those who unjustly hurt others.

548
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,706
Fuck!

549
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:11,438
Someone's there. They're watching us.

550
00:58:12,063 --> 00:58:15,692
Why? Why would someone do this?

551
00:58:15,775 --> 00:58:17,652
To see how we respond.

552
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:21,489
They want to know what
decision we'll make.

553
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:26,827
- Let's pull it.
- No! We don't know what it does yet.

554
00:58:26,911 --> 00:58:28,454
It's too risky.

555
00:58:32,043 --> 00:58:33,208
Fuck!

556
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:40,632
Hey.

557
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:43,594
- Thanks for coming in.
- What'd you find?

558
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:45,889
- An abnormality in Strahm's fingerprint.
- What?

559
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:47,349
Take a look.

560
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:51,978
So the human fingerprint
leaves an oily residue,

561
00:58:52,063 --> 00:58:54,356
and depending on how long it's
been exposed to the elements,

562
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,358
- it's highly susceptible to contamination.
- So what's the problem?

563
00:58:57,443 --> 00:59:00,778
well, we found trace
amounts of halo methane R-12.

564
00:59:00,862 --> 00:59:02,822
She means Frwon.

565
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:05,282
Production of R-12 ceased in 1994.

566
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:09,036
So the question is, was the
contaminant we found at the site already

567
00:59:09,117 --> 00:59:10,952
or did Strahm bring it in with him?

568
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:12,831
Yeah. We're looking into
the building's function

569
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,876
before it was abandoned.

570
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:17,545
Excuse me.

571
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,548
Did anything come from
the Seth Baxter tape?

572
00:59:21,634 --> 00:59:24,719
Yeah, actually, we
might be on to something.

573
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:26,512
The tape was in pretty
rough shape when we found it,

574
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,222
but we were able to authenticate it.

575
00:59:28,306 --> 00:59:32,768
The voice was intentionally distorted,
but it didn't match John Kramer's.

576
00:59:32,853 --> 00:59:35,980
- It's currently being analyzed.
- For what?

577
00:59:36,065 --> 00:59:40,110
well, we're trying to descramble
the tape to find the original voice.

578
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:42,528
He's on with the tech right now.

579
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:47,617
Are you timing something? Your watch.

580
00:59:49,202 --> 00:59:51,704
I was before I got your call, yeah.

581
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:56,291
We got it. This is our smoking gun.

582
00:59:57,795 --> 01:00:00,295
The lab's off-site. Come on.

583
01:00:01,673 --> 01:00:04,967
- You're coming, right?
- Of course.

584
01:00:40,338 --> 01:00:43,505
You shut up! All you do is try
to take over every situation.

585
01:00:43,632 --> 01:00:44,923
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about!

586
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,509
Shut the fuck up!

587
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:49,929
- Fuck off!
- Would you two just shut up already!

588
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:51,306
We can figure this out.

589
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:54,893
- Hey! Who's in there?
- Mr. Easton? Is that you?

590
01:00:54,976 --> 01:00:58,103
- Yeah. Shelby? Who's in there with you?
- Mr. Easton!

591
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,856
We're all in here, sir. All six
of us. What the hell is going on?

592
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,442
Everybody! We need your help.

593
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,110
What can you see?

594
01:01:04,195 --> 01:01:06,862
We can't see anything. It's pitch dark.

595
01:01:07,655 --> 01:01:10,784
- What's that sound?
- I don't know, something we're chained to.

596
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,786
- It's spinning. Oh, God.
- Get us out of herw!

597
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:16,373
- You have to help us!
- Please!

598
01:01:16,956 --> 01:01:19,501
Come on, get us out of here, Mr. E!

599
01:01:26,634 --> 01:01:28,425
Mr. Easton!

600
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,804
Mr. Easton! You got
to get us out of here!

601
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,222
Oh, my God!

602
01:01:34,934 --> 01:01:36,684
Pull it together, Mr. Easton. Come on!

603
01:01:36,768 --> 01:01:38,436
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

604
01:01:38,521 --> 01:01:40,521
Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton!

605
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:43,315
Please! Please get us
out of here! Please!

606
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,402
Mr. Easton, what is this?

607
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:49,280
It's a game.

608
01:01:49,907 --> 01:01:51,574
- Game?
- Mr. Easton?

609
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:06,965
Hello, William. Before you are six
of your most valuable associates,

610
01:02:07,048 --> 01:02:09,967
the ones who find errors in policies.

611
01:02:10,052 --> 01:02:12,721
Their findings result
in over two-thirds

612
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:16,849
of all applications denied
or prematurely terminated.

613
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:22,438
Now you must apply your analysis to them.
And will you be able to find their errors?

614
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,650
Six ride the carousel.

615
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,280
But only two can get off.

616
01:02:32,032 --> 01:02:35,909
The decision of which two
survive falls upon you.

617
01:02:35,994 --> 01:02:39,914
But remember, the mounted
gun will continue to fire

618
01:02:39,998 --> 01:02:42,291
until all six rounds are spent.

619
01:02:43,085 --> 01:02:47,255
And if no decision is made on
your part, all six will perish.

620
01:02:47,922 --> 01:02:49,048
What? What?

621
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,134
To offer the two reprieves,

622
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:55,722
you must press both buttons
at once in the box before you.

623
01:02:55,806 --> 01:03:00,184
However, in doing so you'll
give a sacrifice of your own.

624
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:03,103
Two can live, four will die.

625
01:03:03,188 --> 01:03:07,483
Your decision's symbolized
by the blood on your hands.

626
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:16,201
Mr. Easton, wake up! You
gotta get us out of here!

627
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:18,494
- Pick me!
- Mr. Easton, come on!

628
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:22,206
Listen to me. Mr. Easton, I
am the one who should live.

629
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,501
- Do something!
- Fuck.

630
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,588
Jesus Christ!

631
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:34,427
Please, Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton! Please!

632
01:03:34,512 --> 01:03:37,554
Follow the policy, Mr. Easton. Do it!

633
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:42,226
Please! Mr. Easton, follow
the policy! Follow the policy!

634
01:03:46,398 --> 01:03:48,315
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God!

635
01:03:49,568 --> 01:03:51,735
- No!
- Oh, my God!

636
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,320
What the fuck!

637
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,657
- What the fuck!
- No!

638
01:03:58,327 --> 01:04:01,413
Mr. E! They say we're only
as strong as the weakest link!

639
01:04:01,496 --> 01:04:03,748
I'm the strongest! You can't let me die!

640
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:07,126
Fuck him! I'm healthy,
sir. I'm healthy! Please!

641
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,128
Mr. Easton, come on!

642
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:12,840
No, I have two kids. You
know them well. Please!

643
01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:16,552
Please, they can't grow up
without me! They need me!

644
01:04:22,684 --> 01:04:24,226
Oh, shit!

645
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:39,909
Thank you! Thank you!

646
01:04:39,994 --> 01:04:42,494
- Fucking hell!
- Thank you.

647
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:45,581
Fuck her! You don't even
know her, Mr. Easton.

648
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:49,293
Listen to me, okay? My
parents are sick, okay?

649
01:04:49,378 --> 01:04:51,588
- They need me. I'm all they have, please!
- You fucking liar!

650
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:54,007
- Your parents hate you! They cut you off!
- What?

651
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,260
- Shut up! That's not true!
- Fuck you, it is true. I sit next to you!

652
01:04:57,344 --> 01:05:01,181
- I... I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant!
- No, she's not! She's lying!

653
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,891
- She's fucking lying!
- Fuck you!

654
01:05:02,974 --> 01:05:04,851
- Mr. Easton, she is lying!
- I'm pregnant!

655
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,519
- She's lying.
- No! No, fuck!

656
01:05:07,605 --> 01:05:09,105
- I'm pregnant!
- She's fucking lying!

657
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:12,775
He's lying, Mr. Easton, it's
not true! Please! Please!

658
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:16,028
Fuck! Push the thing! Push the thing!

659
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,239
- She's lying.
- No!

660
01:05:18,324 --> 01:05:21,617
- Mr. Easton, push it! Push the thing!
- Oh, God! No!

661
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,288
Push it!

662
01:05:26,498 --> 01:05:29,250
Oh, God! What the...

663
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,670
What the fuck!

664
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:36,382
You have to trust me!
I won't lie to you!

665
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:39,927
- Oh, please! He's a kiss-ass! -
Mr. Easton! My parents are loaded!

666
01:05:40,012 --> 01:05:41,637
- Oh, God!
- They'll give you whatever you want!

667
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:42,931
- Just say a number!
- He's a thief!

668
01:05:43,014 --> 01:05:44,974
He's been stealing from
the company for years!

669
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:48,686
It's true! It's true!
It's true! It's true!

670
01:05:48,771 --> 01:05:50,480
- Thief!
- Fuck you!

671
01:05:50,563 --> 01:05:52,898
- It's true! He has been...
- Don't Listen to them!

672
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:55,818
- Don't Listen to them, Mr. E!
- It's true!

673
01:05:55,902 --> 01:06:00,447
Christ! Mr. Easton,
come on! Mr. Easton...

674
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:13,253
Okay, Mr. Easton, Listen to me carefully.
I'm on your side, and I can help you.

675
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:18,757
- But you cannot trust this bitch!
- What? Fuck you!

676
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:20,719
- She's a fucking liar!
- What?

677
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:24,431
You cannot believe her. She
has already tried to lie!

678
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:28,476
And she's just going to
continue to do it! You know it!

679
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:29,978
It's me, Josh!

680
01:06:30,061 --> 01:06:34,398
No, I haven't! What about you? He
wants to be you! Okay, you know that!

681
01:06:34,483 --> 01:06:37,943
But he'll slit your throat
at the first opportunity!

682
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:44,284
Please don't let me
die! Please! No, please!

683
01:06:49,956 --> 01:06:53,626
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, fuck!

684
01:07:00,509 --> 01:07:02,052
Oh, God!

685
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:07,014
Thank you!

686
01:07:10,268 --> 01:07:13,646
Oh, well, that's it,
isn't it? It's over!

687
01:07:13,981 --> 01:07:17,150
- You motherfucker!
- Stop it!

688
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:21,905
You spineless,
pussy-whipped motherfucker!

689
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:27,077
That's all it takes, eh? A bitch
says one thing and it's all over!

690
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:32,748
You know what, William?
Your policy, it's bullshit!

691
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:35,126
Fucking bullshit!

692
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,755
well, you Listen to
me, you son of a bitch!

693
01:07:39,297 --> 01:07:41,298
I did everything for you.

694
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:50,599
Look at me! When you're
killing me, you look at me!

695
01:08:03,114 --> 01:08:04,447
Thank you.

696
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:08,242
Oh, my God!

697
01:08:09,244 --> 01:08:12,038
- Thank you.
- Emily.

698
01:08:35,104 --> 01:08:49,367
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

699
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,912
- How's it going?
- Good.

700
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:57,167
This is it.

701
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,418
Whoever made this tape had access

702
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,171
to some very impressive
audio-filtration equipment.

703
01:09:02,256 --> 01:09:04,966
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

704
01:09:05,051 --> 01:09:07,969
Fortunately, we have some
tricks of our own here.

705
01:09:08,054 --> 01:09:12,931
We can turn his algorithm upside down and
let us hear what he really sounds like.

706
01:09:15,435 --> 01:09:17,354
Let's hear what you got.

707
01:09:19,606 --> 01:09:22,775
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

708
01:09:23,985 --> 01:09:25,235
You okay?

709
01:09:26,697 --> 01:09:29,198
You seem a little preoccupied.

710
01:09:29,283 --> 01:09:31,618
I'm just anxious about the tape.

711
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,581
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

712
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,877
- Right now, you're feeling helpless.
- You know, there are still a couple of things

713
01:09:40,961 --> 01:09:44,631
- I can't quite wrap my head around.
- Right now, you're feeling helpless.

714
01:09:44,715 --> 01:09:47,716
Like, I don't understand
Strahm's motivation.

715
01:09:48,636 --> 01:09:50,386
He was my partner for five years.

716
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:52,680
I mean, we all knew he
was a bit of a hothead.

717
01:09:52,765 --> 01:09:56,225
But I never saw any indication
of psychotic behavior.

718
01:09:56,310 --> 01:10:00,270
You never can really tell what
someone's thinking on the inside.

719
01:10:03,442 --> 01:10:04,859
...helpless.

720
01:10:05,653 --> 01:10:08,488
- Hear that?
- Right now, you're feeling helpless.

721
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:09,863
We're getting there.

722
01:10:09,948 --> 01:10:12,492
Come on, I thought you
had something to show us.

723
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:15,619
Yeah, it's just I never really
thought of him as being vengeful.

724
01:10:15,704 --> 01:10:20,542
- Right now, you're feeling helpless.
- You know? I mean, all the facts are there.

725
01:10:24,462 --> 01:10:27,966
- But something doesn't sit right.
- Listen. It's getting closer.

726
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:31,427
- Right now, you're feeling...
- You know, there is an alternative.

727
01:10:31,511 --> 01:10:34,514
Let's say that Strahm killed Seth Baxter

728
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:38,560
specifically to set you up
as an accomplice to Jigsaw.

729
01:10:38,644 --> 01:10:39,769
Okay.

730
01:10:41,021 --> 01:10:43,398
well, there's a problem
with that, though.

731
01:10:43,481 --> 01:10:45,483
On further analysis of
Strahm's fingerprints,

732
01:10:45,568 --> 01:10:49,029
it was found that the uric acid
levels in the eccrine gland residue

733
01:10:49,113 --> 01:10:54,658
were inconsistent for an individual
with an active epidermal metabolism.

734
01:10:54,743 --> 01:10:56,286
In other words?

735
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,497
In other words, when he left his
fingerprints on the latest victim,

736
01:10:59,582 --> 01:11:00,914
Strahm was already dead.

737
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,667
- Right now, you're feeling helpless.
- There it is.

738
01:11:03,752 --> 01:11:06,253
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

739
01:11:30,488 --> 01:11:32,447
Who else knows about me?

740
01:11:34,033 --> 01:11:36,368
Who else fucking knows about me?

741
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:43,082
- Everyone.
- You lie. You're fucking lying.

742
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,792
I found something you'll want to see.

743
01:14:31,877 --> 01:14:33,795
It was at the location where John died.

744
01:14:33,878 --> 01:14:35,005
Does it mean anything to you?

745
01:14:40,344 --> 01:14:41,344
What are you doing?

746
01:14:41,429 --> 01:14:43,887
Get as far away from the
sprinkler head as possible.

747
01:14:43,972 --> 01:14:45,180
We don't know what it does!

748
01:14:45,265 --> 01:14:46,975
I'm not gonna just sit
here and do nothing.

749
01:14:47,059 --> 01:14:50,228
We need to make a decision!
Don't you understand?

750
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:16,587
Okay. You can pull it. I love you.

751
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:20,466
I love you, too. Get back.

752
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:26,722
No. You don't know what it does!

753
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:40,694
- On three, I'll pull it.
- Okay.

754
01:15:41,863 --> 01:15:43,073
No. No.

755
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:46,743
One,

756
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:49,371
two,

757
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:52,414
three!

758
01:15:54,377 --> 01:15:55,877
What the fuck?

759
01:15:58,756 --> 01:16:02,966
It doesn't even work! It
doesn't even fucking work!

760
01:16:03,051 --> 01:16:04,551
What the fuck?

761
01:16:08,849 --> 01:16:11,309
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

762
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:24,197
I think I know what it does.

763
01:16:39,505 --> 01:16:42,506
Get used to me, 'cause
I'm not going anywhere.

764
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:44,341
You sure about that?

765
01:16:50,015 --> 01:16:51,181
Amanda will fail you.

766
01:16:53,101 --> 01:16:54,226
We'll see.

767
01:17:04,113 --> 01:17:09,158
"Amanda, you were with Cecil
the night Jill lost Gideon. "

768
01:17:11,619 --> 01:17:12,619
Go.

769
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:17,833
- What the fuck are you doing? Go. Go.
- I don't know about this.

770
01:17:17,917 --> 01:17:19,711
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- She's been good to us.

771
01:17:19,795 --> 01:17:20,837
I've been good to you.

772
01:17:20,921 --> 01:17:23,881
- I know...
- Please, please, go.

773
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,507
You drive me crazy.

774
01:17:25,592 --> 01:17:28,886
Go on, you fucking pussy! Go! Go! Go!

775
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,265
- Cecil! No!
- Listen to me!

776
01:17:44,194 --> 01:17:45,487
"You killed their child.

777
01:17:47,364 --> 01:17:51,326
"You know it and I know
it, so do exactly as I say.

778
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:56,206
"Kill Lynn Denlon or I will
tell John what you did. "

779
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,458
She doesn't deserve to go free!

780
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:02,628
Amanda, Lynn is more
important than you know.

781
01:18:07,009 --> 01:18:08,259
Lynn!

782
01:18:44,296 --> 01:18:49,259
I made it. I made it. I made it!

783
01:18:50,011 --> 01:18:53,262
If you fail, you will
never see your family again.

784
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,313
- What are you doing here?
- Will!

785
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,899
- Pamela!
- Yeah.

786
01:19:06,277 --> 01:19:09,404
I know it's your birthday. I'm going
to make it up to you, I promise.

787
01:19:09,572 --> 01:19:13,615
Are you really standing up your
sister for work? I'm your only family.

788
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:15,827
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

789
01:19:17,246 --> 01:19:19,788
Let her go! I mean it! I won!

790
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:24,085
I followed your fucking
rules! Now you let her go!

791
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:26,296
You son of a bitch!

792
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:29,841
You've just given me a death sentence.
I mean, who's going to cover me now?

793
01:19:30,509 --> 01:19:32,260
You just killed me.

794
01:19:32,511 --> 01:19:34,220
Come on, Let's go.

795
01:19:40,144 --> 01:19:42,604
You're the man that killed my dad.

796
01:20:03,876 --> 01:20:09,213
Hello, Tara. My apologies for exposing
you and your son to this kind of treatment.

797
01:20:09,506 --> 01:20:12,966
But I can assure you,
it is not without reason.

798
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:18,180
The man before you just made the
sacrifices to save the life of a loved one.

799
01:20:18,474 --> 01:20:22,394
However, when given the opportunity
to save your husband's life,

800
01:20:22,853 --> 01:20:24,688
he chose not to.

801
01:20:24,814 --> 01:20:28,858
Now you will be given
the power to save a life.

802
01:20:28,943 --> 01:20:32,779
Will you grant this man the
opportunity to continue living?

803
01:20:32,863 --> 01:20:35,364
Or will you dispense
the same death sentence

804
01:20:35,448 --> 01:20:37,242
he issued your husband?

805
01:20:37,326 --> 01:20:38,702
Live or die.

806
01:20:40,037 --> 01:20:41,829
The choice is yours.

807
01:20:47,712 --> 01:20:49,378
It's not my game.

808
01:20:56,511 --> 01:21:01,890
I'm leaving you a box today, and
its contents are of grave importance.

809
01:21:04,811 --> 01:21:06,979
Miss Tuck, what's in the box?

810
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:34,090
Please. Please forgive me.

811
01:21:34,884 --> 01:21:36,760
Have mercy, please!

812
01:21:36,844 --> 01:21:40,430
Did he show mercy when
my husband was suffering?

813
01:21:46,686 --> 01:21:48,896
John left you five envelopes.

814
01:21:49,899 --> 01:21:51,899
The sixth one was for me.

815
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:58,907
This is John's will.

816
01:22:02,662 --> 01:22:04,537
...to watch this horror!

817
01:22:04,622 --> 01:22:07,957
- He had no choice!
- He always had a choice!

818
01:22:09,877 --> 01:22:14,046
The reason I am doing this
isn't because I can't forgive you

819
01:22:14,131 --> 01:22:16,131
for what you did to me.

820
01:22:17,801 --> 01:22:20,052
The reason I'm doing this

821
01:22:20,136 --> 01:22:24,306
is because I couldn't forgive myself
for what you might do to someone else.

822
01:22:24,432 --> 01:22:26,725
Please, no. Please.

823
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,563
- You will never kill again.
- Please.

824
01:22:33,149 --> 01:22:40,573
Please.

825
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:44,034
Please. Please.

826
01:22:44,744 --> 01:22:47,204
I can't. I can't kill him.

827
01:22:52,502 --> 01:22:53,837
But I can.

828
01:22:54,671 --> 01:22:58,007
- No, Brent!
- You killed my father, you motherfucker!

829
01:23:02,846 --> 01:23:04,639
Now you burn in hell.

830
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:34,461
Game over.

831
01:23:42,595 --> 01:23:43,970
- John Kramer.
- William Easton.

832
01:23:44,055 --> 01:23:45,055
Nice to meet you.

833
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:57,192
- Those are the rules, Harold.
- You've just given me a death sentence.

834
01:23:57,275 --> 01:24:00,569
So, in a sense, you
choose who lives or dies.

835
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:08,494
No!

836
01:24:08,953 --> 01:24:11,497
It's policy, John. It's policy.

837
01:24:17,505 --> 01:24:22,132
You think it's the living who will
have ultimate judgment over you,

838
01:24:22,217 --> 01:24:25,470
because the dead will have
no claim over your soul,

839
01:24:29,391 --> 01:24:31,350
but you may be mistaken.

840
01:24:41,695 --> 01:24:43,279
So when's your test, Detective?

841
01:24:46,242 --> 01:24:48,368
- I don't need one.
- Oh, yeah?

842
01:24:56,543 --> 01:24:58,670
You know why you're here, don't you?

843
01:25:03,426 --> 01:25:06,427
I want to know if you have
what it takes to survive.

844
01:25:07,345 --> 01:25:09,930
You feel you now have
control, don't you?

845
01:25:10,015 --> 01:25:13,059
You think you will walk away untested.

846
01:25:27,949 --> 01:25:30,577
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

847
01:25:32,496 --> 01:25:34,663
I'm only carrying out
John's final request.

848
01:25:35,248 --> 01:25:37,583
You want a chance?
I'll give you a chance.

849
01:31:15,256 --> 01:31:18,966
Remember...

850
01:31:21,636 --> 01:31:27,684
Remember, don't trust
the one who saves you.

851
01:31:30,186 --> 01:31:32,646
Don't trust the one who saves you.
