2
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:21,678
Red Riding Hood,
you probably know the story.

3
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,714
But there's more to every tale
than meets the eye.

4
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:30,456
It's just like they always say,
you can't judge a book by its cover.

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,661
If you want to know the truth,
you've gotta flip through the pages.

6
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,540
Granny!

7
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,581
It's me, Red!

8
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,788
Is everything OK?

9
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,122
Oh, yeah, sure thing. Come on in.

10
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,752
What?

11
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,923
Who are you?
- I'm your grandma.

12
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,524
Your face looks really weird, Granny.

13
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,501
I've been sick. I...

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,504
Your mouth doesn't move when you talk.

15
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,507
Plastic surgery.
Grandma's had a little work done.

16
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,874
Now, come on over here.
Let's have a look at you.

17
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,278
So, what's going on, Grandma?

18
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,316
This and that, doing a lot of quilting.

19
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,579
So you got the loot?

20
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,282
Whoa. What big hands you have.

21
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,792
Oh, all the better
to scratch my back with.

22
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,421
And what big ears you have!
- All the better to hear your...

23
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,692
...many criticisms!

24
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,030
Old people just have big ears, dear.

25
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,696
And Granny, what big eyes you have!

26
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,070
Are we just gonna sit around here
and talk about how big I'm getting?

27
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,805
You came here for a reason. So tell
old Granny what you got in the basket.

28
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,712
Ah, Granny! What bad breath you have!

29
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,249
All right!
- Ah!

30
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,411
You again? What do I have to do,
get a restraining order?

31
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,819
Settle down, little girl. I'm on to you.

32
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,982
Hai-ya!
- Save it, Red Fu.

33
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,323
You been dodging me all day,
but now you might as well give up.

34
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,658
Ahh!

35
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,357
Ha!

36
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,833
You crazy wolf!
What have you done with Granny?

37
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,496
I'm taking Granny down, and you're next!

38
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,269
Granny!
- It's you! But you...

39
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,827
Chief Grizzly, are the suspects

40
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,332
connected with the Goody Bandit?
- Yeah, uh...

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,233
No. Don't print that, Maxine.
We don't know anything yet.

42
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,567
Is the house
made of gingerbread?

43
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,800
Don't think so.
- Do bears eat gingerbread?

44
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,571
That's enough with the questions.
Jerry, come on! Get these people back!

45
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,079
All right, back it up!
Let the chief do his job!

46
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,207
Come on, you, with the feathers,
back behind the snake.

47
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,252
I just want to go home and hibernate.

48
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,513
Bill!
- Chief!

49
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,488
All right, what do we got?
- It's a domestic disturbance.

50
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,220
Breaking and entering, wielding an ax
without a license, intent to eat.

51
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,956
I get it. Any connection
with the recipe robberies?

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,761
You mean the Goody Bandit? Could be.
The house belongs to Granny Puckett.

53
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,393
The cookbook lady?
- Yeah, that's the one.

54
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,164
Hmm.

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,272
OK, Paul Bunyan was swinging the ax,
and Wolfie was trying to eat Lil' Bit.

56
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,836
All right, get a muzzle on that guy.
- I can explain everything.

57
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,575
You can explain it to the judge.

58
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,379
Shouldn't you be in school?
- Shouldn't I have a lawyer?

59
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,851
Uh... What are you doing?

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,081
Hey. We was just...
- I was just smelling it.

61
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,057
Don't eat that. That's evidence.
- Right.

62
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,991
All right, so this looks
pretty open-and-shut.

63
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,022
Little Miss Rosy Cakes making covert
deliveries to the goody tycoon,

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,829
Wolfie tries to eat 'em both,

65
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,236
then Crazy Flannel Pants with the ax
here busts in swinging vigilante-style.

66
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,933
Take 'em downtown, boys.

67
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,408
It's the woods, chief.
We don't have a downtown.

68
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,377
You know what I mean.
Just book 'em!

69
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,381
Not so fast, Grizzly.

70
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,683
That's the problem with you bears,
always growling up the wrong tree.

71
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,814
Hey, Nicky!
- You on the case, Nick?

72
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,256
No, just stopping by
to have a sarsaparilla.

73
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,692
Say, Tommy, you lose some weight?

74
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,127
Uh, no.
- Didn't think so.

75
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,894
Nicky Flippers. What are you
doing here? This is my case.

76
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,869
Well, someone hibernated
on the wrong side of the cave.

77
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,304
I saw the lights,
thought the circus was in town.

78
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,932
Now, of course, I see I was right.

79
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,739
You're too late, Nicky.
I got this case all wrapped up.

80
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,711
Is that right?
- Yeah.

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,214
They got us all wrong, Mr. Flippers.

82
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,013
Oh, I don't know,
you look pretty dangerous to me.

83
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,643
What's your name?
- Red.

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,951
And why do they call you that?
- Why do they call you "Flippers"?

85
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,481
Go Flippers!

86
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,119
Jump! Get on!
- Go Flippers!

87
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,060
Go Flippers, Go Flippers!

88
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,123
Uh, no reason.

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,794
They call me Red
because of this red hood I wear.

90
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,431
What about when you're not wearing it?
- I usually wear it.

91
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,907
Recipes have come up missing
all over the forest.

92
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,672
Goody shops have been
going out of business for months,

93
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,145
and the trail ends here.
I got a case to close.

94
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,742
Slow down, chief. We've got four
suspects, and that means four stories,

95
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,277
and if you get people talking long
enough, someone will spill the beans.

96
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,984
Beans?
- Could I just make a quick phone call?

97
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,458
Aaah!

98
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,325
I'll tell you what happened.

99
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:35,022
What's with the handcuffs on a girl?
Her wrists could slip right out.

100
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,626
How about a cage?
- Bring in the cage!

101
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,265
I was being sarcastic.
- Sarcasm. Strike the cage.

102
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,642
All right, get the cuffs off her.

103
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,981
So, Red, why don't you explain
how this all began?

104
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,712
Well, like any other day.

105
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,277
I was making deliveries
for my Granny's goody shop.

106
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,051
# Ba ba ba-da-ba-da

107
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,352
# Ba ba

108
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,451
# Ba ba ba ba

109
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,362
# Ba ba ba

110
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,764
# Here's a story I hope

111
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,065
# You'll like

112
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,106
# It's the one about the girl
riding on her bike

113
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,765
# I know
- Hi, Red!

114
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,437
# It's a tired old tale
but it still rings true

115
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,037
Hey, Red.
- # She could never be rude

116
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,310
# Or unkind
- Hey!

117
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,376
# But a sad song played
at the back of her mind

118
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,614
# Oh

119
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,920
# Can someone show me a different day

120
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,892
# To take me away

121
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,089
# Take me out of the woods

122
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,654
# Great big world

123
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:45,136
# You know what I'm wanting for you

124
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,135
# You know what I'm wanting for you

125
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,804
# What I'm wanting for you

126
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,348
# Wanting for you

127
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,407
Ahh!

128
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,351
# Oh ##

129
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,321
Hey, Red!

130
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,224
Oh! Nice outfit. Always red with you.

131
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,194
You must be in autumn.
- Hey, Boingo.

132
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,731
Aren't you helping the Muffin Man today?

133
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,200
Oh, he closed up shop.
Someone took all his recipes last night,

134
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,703
and now I'm out of a job.

135
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,229
Gee, Boingo, I'm really sorry.
Are you still running the cable car?

136
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,969
Yeah, yeah, I am.

137
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,273
But it's nothing like
making goodies all day.

138
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,540
Would a carrot crumpet
make you feel better?

139
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,311
Oh, boy, oh, boy! Thanks, Red.
I can always count on you to deliver,

140
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,615
you little rascally devil.

141
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,485
Yeah, well, the woods
don't go around by themselves.

142
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,889
Shut it down.

143
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,375
Come on, let's go.
- Where are we going now, Mama?

144
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,439
With the Goody Bandit
on the loose,

145
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,350
recipes were becoming
an endangered species.

146
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,081
I decided to call Granny.

147
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,953
If anyone would know what to do,
she would.

148
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,050
I don't know what to do.
I'm just a tired old lady.

149
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,392
Your recipes are the most famous
in the whole forest, Granny.

150
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,194
What if they get swiped?
It could wipe you out.

151
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,293
Maybe I should bring you
the recipe book, for safekeeping.

152
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,237
A trip up the mountain
is too dangerous for a little girl.

153
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,137
I'm not so little anymore.

154
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,269
Please, dear, you just keep the recipes
there, and everything will be fine.

155
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,871
But...
- I have to go now. My program's on.

156
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,041
Kisses.

157
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,352
What you reading, Red?

158
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,824
"Far Away Places"?

159
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:52,422
Are you going somewhere far away?
- No. The world is too dangerous.

160
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,264
Can't see! Danger! Turn into the skid!

161
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,735
I'm OK. I'll walk it off.

162
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,674
You can't go away.
Who's gonna ride the Goody Bike?

163
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,771
If I had wings like you,
I'd fly all the way past that mountain,

164
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,783
and the next one and the next one...

165
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,287
But I can't. I'm just a kid.

166
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,049
I'm just a woodpecker.

167
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,524
Uh-oh.

168
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,699
"You're next"?

169
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,770
What... what does it mean,
"you're next"?

170
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,783
Ruined.

171
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,413
It means someone wants our recipes.

172
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,499
Are they gonna get your recipes?

173
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,869
Not today.

174
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,436
So you deliberately
took your Granny's recipes

175
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,744
from the family vault,
without permission.

176
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,876
Help yourself.
- And then,

177
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,444
you set out on a dangerous journey
up the mountain...

178
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,514
...alone?
- Yeah. I guess I did.

179
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,127
# Critters have feelings

180
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,221
# Well, critters have feelings

181
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,595
# Critters have feelings

182
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,998
# Well, critters have feelings too

183
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,468
# Critters have feelings
Critters have feelings

184
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,529
I guess running the cable car's
not so bad, you know.

185
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:45,202
It's a great way to see the forest
without worrying about all those big,

186
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,677
mean, hairy beasts out there.

187
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,047
Beasts?
- Oh, yeah, you know, beasts.

188
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,642
The wolves and the bobcats
and the mountain lions

189
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,153
and the saber-tooth tigers!
But mostly wolves.

190
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,452
Mostly wolves.

191
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:02,255
The forest can be a dangerous place for
a little guy like me, with my cute...

192
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,922
Look at me, I'm fuzzy...
You deliver up this far?

193
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,624
Well, not usually.

194
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,725
But I was thinking
about what you told me earlier.

195
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,599
About the Muffin Man?

196
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,970
I need to protect Granny's recipes
from that Bandit's evil plan.

197
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,477
They're gonna shut down everyone
in the forest if we're not careful.

198
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,444
Aaah! Aah! Aah!

199
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,482
No!
- Aaah!

200
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,685
Ohh!

201
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:31,018
Aah! Whoa! Ohh!

202
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,751
Aaah!

203
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,435
'Afternoon.

204
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,669
Hello.

205
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,181
So you're the little girl
in the red hood.

206
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,683
That was quite a bit of falling
you did just now.

207
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,050
You saw that.
- Yeah, gravity's working.

208
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,716
Those old cable cars on the...
You should write a letter.

209
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,921
Wow! Something smells good.
Those, uh... goodies in there?

210
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,088
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

211
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,598
No, you shouldn't. Good call.

212
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,828
What are you doing
in the big, bad forest?

213
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,871
You taking the goodies
to someone in particular?

214
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,100
Um... my granny.
- Granny?

215
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,869
Granny Puckett? The goody lady?

216
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,106
My goodness,
she makes some good... goodies.

217
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,842
She's got a thing, it's like a...
It's like a... cookies.

218
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,147
Shortbread,
chocolate icing between, very...

219
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,655
It's good. Ah, it's very good.

220
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,055
You make deliveries
to your granny often?

221
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,890
I don't think I should tell you that.

222
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,953
Oh, you don't have
anything else in that?

223
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,055
You ask a lot of questions, mister.

224
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,398
Well, I'm a curious guy.
Let me have a look.

225
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,800
I'd rather you didn't.

226
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,434
Red! Red Riding Hood!

227
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,382
Hand over the basket.

228
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,114
Aaah!

229
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,483
Red!

230
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,565
You can't hold
onto those recipes forever!

231
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,435
I'll get you,
and your little Granny too!

232
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,300
Well, that settles it.

233
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,969
We got our Bandit.
- Could be.

234
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,513
I'd like to count my chickens
after they hatch.

235
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,809
Chickens?

236
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,943
You've gotta admit, a wolf stopping
kids in the middle of the forest...

237
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,750
That's pretty creepy.
- Right. Yes, yes.

238
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,314
But we don't arrest people
for being creepy.

239
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,660
Yeah, Bruce. You know that guy
we got in the tank?

240
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,923
The creepy one?
- Yeah. Better let him go.

241
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,666
So you went on to Granny's?

242
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,802
I found an old trail
up the north side of the mountain.

243
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,207
Hello!

244
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,621
Hello.

245
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,290
I'm looking for Granny Puckett's house.

246
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,291
# Granny Puckett

247
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,135
Could you stop singing for one moment?
- # No, I can't, I wish I could.

248
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:39,109
# But a mountain witch done
put a spell on me 37 years ago

249
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,308
# And now I gotta sing
everything I say.

250
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,407
Everything?
- That's right.

251
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,349
You just talked! Just now!

252
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,818
Did I?

253
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,253
# Did I?

254
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:55,123
# Did I, did I, did I
doo-dah, doo-dah did-i-doo

255
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,554
Granny?
- What's that? Who's there?

256
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,793
It's Red. I'm on my way
to come see...

257
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,665
Oh, my dearie, I'm not prepared.

258
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,070
I need to put down fresh doilies! Aah!

259
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,303
Granny! Granny, what's wrong?
- Gotta go, munchkin.

260
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,402
Bonsai!

261
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,503
Oh, no.

262
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,208
Mr. Goat, my granny's in trouble.

263
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,116
I've gotta find a way
around the mountain, fast.

264
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,586
# Well, you came to the right goat

265
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,783
Oh, good. More singing.

266
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,157
# Thirty-seven years ago
a witch done put a spell on me

267
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,354
Yeah. I know.

268
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,559
# A spell where when I'm talking
I'm singing it with glee

269
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:38,626
# But when you're always singing
you've got to live alone

270
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,798
# That's why I made
this mountain shack my home

271
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,863
That's great...

272
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,605
# When you're on the mountain
there's lots to be a-feared

273
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,479
# That's why this here
old mountain goat's prepared

274
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,645
# Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

275
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,281
These tunnels, I need one
that leads to Puckett Grove.

276
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,859
Ohh.

277
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,960
# But I got horns that open bottles
and I got horns that hold my keys

278
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,199
# I got horns that
when you turn 'em right

279
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,174
# They help me watch TV

280
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:21,474
# I got horns that open pickle jars
and horns that come with hair

281
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,845
# I got horns that hang my other horns

282
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,612
# I always come prepared

283
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,483
Can you help me find?
- # To be prepared, to be prepared

284
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:33,321
# This lesson must be shared
This lesson must be shared

285
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,417
# To be prepared

286
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,962
# To be prepared, to be prepared

287
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,157
# And unless you've got a spare

288
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,998
# You've got one life
so handle it with care

289
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,264
Aaah!
- Yipee!

290
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:51,708
Keep your hands and feet
inside of the vehicle at all times!

291
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,207
# An avalanche is coming
and I do not feel prepared

292
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,336
# It's rumbling like a mountain lion
I must say that I'm scared

293
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,405
# And if not for the witch's spell
you'd hearjust how I scream

294
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,576
# But since I'm only singing
I'll just yodel till we're creamed

295
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,424
Aaah! Aaah!

296
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,728
Aaah!

297
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,841
Red!

298
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,703
Granny?

299
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,544
Use the hood, Red!

300
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,881
Use the hood!

301
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,295
What?

302
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,895
# I was prepared!

303
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,676
Granny! It's me, Red. Is everything OK?

304
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:42,845
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

305
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,357
So this wolf, he was dressed
as your grandmother?

306
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,791
Yes.
- I'm your grandma.

307
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,489
And you bought that?
- No, not really.

308
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,861
Whoa. What big hands you have.

309
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,797
And what big ears you have.

310
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,496
What bad breath you have!
What big eyes you have.

311
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,937
Are we just gonna sit around here
and talk about how big I'm getting?

312
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,838
Then the fellow with the ax burst in?

313
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,537
Aaah!
- Whoa! Whoa!

314
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,876
No, no, not yet.

315
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,341
First I was attacked
by that crazy wolf!

316
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,578
Hai-ya! You crazy wolf!

317
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,553
My granny jumped
out of a closet.

318
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,886
Aaah!
- But she was tied up...

319
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,118
And then the axman cometh?

320
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,285
You got it.

321
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,125
Only he was screaming.

322
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,289
Arghh?

323
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,730
Like a maniac.

324
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,229
Wow.
- Hmm.

325
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,865
So that was it?
- That wolf was gonna eat us all.

326
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,603
The guy's pawprints
are all over the room. Book him!

327
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:43,376
Hold the phone, fuzzy-wuzzy.
Let's hear it from the wolf's mouth.

328
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,324
Don't I get a drink?
- No!

329
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,362
So, Mr. Wolf, may I call you "Wolf"?

330
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,421
You can call me Sheila.
I like long walks and fresh flowers.

331
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,932
Quit playing around, Wolf!

332
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,367
You're looking at three-to-five
in an old shoe with no windows!

333
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,166
So start singing!

334
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,766
Your face looks familiar.
- I get around the forest.

335
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,571
What do you for a living, Mr. Wolf?

336
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,112
I'm a shepherd. Hey!

337
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,740
You might as well confess.
I told them everything!

338
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,046
Could you keep her
away from me, please?

339
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,847
I remember you.

340
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,047
Three years ago on the Stiltskin case.

341
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,784
You were snooping around
for a lead on his real name.

342
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,052
I was close too.

343
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,959
I was gonna go with "Greg."
Greg Stiltskin.

344
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,930
Wait a minute, Flippers!
You saying this guy's a cop?

345
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,331
Worse. He's a reporter.

346
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,734
A what?
- And I've got the real story.

347
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,640
I'm an investigative journalist.

348
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,380
You've probably read my column
Facts and Fairy Tales.

349
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,952
I spent the last six months undercover

350
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,859
investigating
the so-called "Goody Bandit."

351
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,727
As more recipes go missing,
the trail has gotten hotter.

352
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,232
Huh?

353
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,168
And I'm talking hot coffee, hot coffee,

354
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,137
all over my neck. Very, very painful.

355
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,664
People think a health board examiner
doesn't lead a dangerous life,

356
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,576
but I will tell you, my furry friend,
food is dangerous.

357
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,114
That's why Kenny told me
to come and take a look.

358
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,649
Who?
- Your boss, Kenny.

359
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,912
You mean Earl?
- That's what Earl said.

360
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,752
He said, uh, "Kenny, come down here,"
and so, here I am.

361
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,519
I'm surprised your dessert counter
hasn't been hit,

362
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,424
with all the thievery going around.

363
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,591
What did you say your name was?
- Shaw. Rick Shaw. I'm in from Japan.

364
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,430
Well, Kenny, I'm gonna
give you a clean bill of health.

365
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,970
But I'm gonna need the names
of all your suppliers.

366
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,529
You'll have to talk to Earl.

367
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,974
Well, that's Earl right now.
Probably called the FDA.

368
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,639
You keep that thing groomed.
And watch out for hot coffee. Painful.

369
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,710
No desserts. Waste of time.

370
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,219
The little delivery girl
in the red hood.

371
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,279
Always on the go.

372
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,624
More goodies pass through her hands
than anyone's in the whole forest.

373
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,926
She seemed happy...

374
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,297
...a little too happy, perhaps.

375
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,703
Oh! Creepy.

376
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,298
I was starting to have my suspicions.

377
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,868
Question:
Who does she move the goodies for?

378
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,143
Where do they come from?
Where are they going?

379
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,446
And why the hood?

380
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,507
Aaah!

381
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,749
Twitchy, you scared me.
- Hey, boss, I beeped you. Get my beep?

382
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,814
Calm down.
- I got up early. Got the gear.

383
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,984
I was watching the girl
like you told me to.

384
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,894
Yeah. Did you see where she went?
- Past porcupines and the bird's tree,

385
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,365
guy with the beard, now she's
up the creek! She sings everywhere!

386
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,494
I'm way ahead of you.
We gotta find out who she's working for.

387
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,802
You got the camera?
- The 220x and photograb with autofocus!

388
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,035
Color or black and white?
- Doesn't matter.

389
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,408
I brought a flash!
- Put that away!

390
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,845
It's covert. No flash.
- Undercover, got it.

391
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,508
Nobody sees, nobody knows.
Click-click. Hee-hee.

392
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,712
You ever thought
about decaffeinated coffee?

393
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,379
I don't drink coffee!

394
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,554
Hmm...

395
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,293
Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon.

396
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,092
I decided to get the word on the
street from one of my top informants.

397
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,157
How's it going, Woolworth?
- Man, what are you doing here?

398
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,898
The shepherd comes by and sees me
talking to you, I'm gonna get the crook.

399
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:30,339
Yeah? There's a bigger crook
on the loose that I'm concerned about.

400
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,503
What ya hear about the Goody Bandit?
- What do I know?

401
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,546
Hiya, Twitchy.

402
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:39,072
The little girl in the red hood.
- Don't know, never heard of her.

403
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,547
Little Red? Processing...

404
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:46,853
Yeah, yeah, it's coming back to me now.
Sweet gal. Not like that Bo Peep.

405
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,122
Brat put in an invisible fence.
I tasted my own fillings for a week!

406
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,594
Focus! The girl in the hood.

407
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,291
You get around the mountain.
Who does she work for?

408
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,493
How should I know?
I ain't that curious.

409
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,594
Family business. Ain't you
ever heard of Granny Puckett?

410
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,968
Puckett?
- Her grandma.

411
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,304
The Granny Puckett?
You pulling the wool over my eyes?

412
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,345
Ha-ha. Hilarious. Come up
with that yourself? That's funny.

413
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,738
You're looking pretty tasty.
- Why you gotta be like that?

414
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,614
All I know is that the old lady
lives up high in the hills.

415
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,119
Not a lot of visitors.
- Except the little girl.

416
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,021
She's been known to take
the cable car up the mountain.

417
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,114
Cable car?

418
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,053
Those sheep made me hungry.
After this, we're grabbing a bite.

419
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,791
Sounds good. Sounds good.

420
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,326
Baa.

421
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,939
I don't know what to do.
Should I call her?

422
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:39,374
Am I supposed to play it cool?
- Keeping her options open.

423
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:42,140
Seeing other people.
You should do the same.

424
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,613
Shh. Up there.

425
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,174
Do you mind?

426
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,344
Ooh. Sorry.

427
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,018
Hey, you deliver up this far?

428
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,891
The Muffin Man...
Granny's recipes...

429
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,159
...an evil plan.

430
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,066
...shut down everyone in the forest...

431
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,397
I knew it.

432
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,928
She's working for the old lady. Twitchy.

433
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,835
Aaah!

434
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:17,981
Aaah!

435
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,414
Ooh! Uhh!

436
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:23,147
Uhh! Ooh! Ugh!

437
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,189
Ouch!

438
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,392
Ooh!

439
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,698
Ahh!

440
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,206
Ohh!

441
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,673
'Afternoon.

442
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,006
Hello.

443
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,069
So you're the little girl
in the red hood.

444
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,377
That's quite a bit of falling
you did just now.

445
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,575
Gravity's working.

446
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,678
What are you doing
in the big, bad forest?

447
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,849
You taking goodies
to someone in particular?

448
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,289
Um... Granny.

449
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,989
You don't have anything else
in that basket?

450
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,591
You ask a lot of questions, mister.
- Well, I'm a curious guy.

451
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:12,831
Let me have a look.
- I'd rather you didn't.

452
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,541
I mean, "please." Come back here!

453
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,009
What are you doing?
- Sorry, I was winding.

454
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:24,742
Come on! We're gonna lose her!
Red! Red Riding Hood!

455
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,511
We'll never catch her.

456
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,576
Taxi!

457
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,057
Whoa! That was her.
We passed her. Right here's fine.

458
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,896
Suspect is approaching on foot,
stolen recipes in basket.

459
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,699
I'm about to catch her red-handed.

460
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,796
Hand over the basket!

461
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,400
Aaah!
- Hyahh!

462
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,269
So you really took a beating...

463
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,475
...from a little girl?
- Hey!

464
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,513
Hai-yah!
- Ooh!

465
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,553
Get back here, you little brat!

466
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,523
# One, two, buckle to you
Ready or not, here I come

467
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,963
# Don't you run away

468
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,661
# A- B-C, I can read
And the sign up ahead said

469
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,830
# Son, you're the 1-2-3-4
Knock on the door

470
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,601
# Open up, gotta run away ##

471
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,634
OK. Not cool. Ahhh!

472
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,582
You can't hold
onto those recipes forever!

473
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,450
I'll get you,
and your little Granny too!

474
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,353
Well, that's fishy.

475
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:44,521
What? They're evil. I'll prove it!

476
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,227
So can we eat?
- Sure. You hungry for failure?

477
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,502
Maybe a side of unemployment?
'Cause that's what's for lunch.

478
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,634
What do we do?
- We go right to the source.

479
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,736
We gotta get to Granny's before the kid.

480
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,373
Is it a surprise?
- Excuse me?

481
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,976
You're going over to Granny's house
to surprise Red. Is it her birthday,

482
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,489
or what is it? Is there a shindig?
'Cause I'm great at parties.

483
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,616
Watch me pull myself out of a hat!
- Yeah.

484
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,161
Big surprise party.
You know how to get there?

485
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,355
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
In fact, I know a shortcut.

486
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,262
You hear that? He knows a shortcut.

487
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,493
Over the woods and through the river...

488
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,696
No, you don't want to go
through the river, you'll get all wet.

489
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,865
You see, Twitchy, you get lemons,
you make lemonade.

490
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,338
And then that lemonade goes bitter
and ferments and turns to pig swill.

491
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,938
Never trust a bunny
with directions, Twitchy.

492
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,881
Sure thing, boss. Never trust a bunny!

493
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,419
The bright side is,
at least I finally dried off.

494
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,920
Ohh!

495
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,822
Why couldn't I write movie reviews?

496
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,951
We are in a pickle, and I blame myself.

497
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:54,124
That bunny was worthless, not to mention
he wrote directions on an Easter egg,

498
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,429
which is hard to read.
- We're gonna die here!

499
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,095
Hey, now, that's what they said
at The Alamo.

500
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,365
Wha... what was that? Who's that?

501
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,669
Aaah!

502
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,307
Uhh!

503
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,941
Hey, look where we are. More cave.

504
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,451
Hey, whazzi-lookie!
- With God as my witness,

505
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,080
you will learn to speak.
Look! A way out.

506
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,646
But I was just... Ahh!

507
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,792
Follow me.

508
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:35,898
Hmm...

509
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,101
Huh?
- Come on.

510
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,643
# Train

511
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,768
# Train

512
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,746
# Living like a bandit #

513
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,418
Now, this is a shortcut.

514
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,482
Whazzat? Sounds like an avalanche!

515
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,458
Well, Twitchy, that's natural.

516
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,963
It's just Old Man Mountain
showing us who's boss.

517
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,395
Hey, lookie!
A box of candles! A big box!

518
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,596
Box of candles? Light 'em up!

519
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,631
Wow, that's nice and bright.
What kind of candles are those?

520
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,474
Deen-a-meet-tay. Must be Italian.
- Ah! Lose the candle!

521
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,138
But I...
- Ahhh!

522
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,345
Got it.

523
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,112
Ahhh!

524
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,925
Aaahhh!

525
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,865
Did you hear something?
- Hm?

526
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,875
Hm. Come on, let's get to Granny's.

527
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,969
Hello! Paper boy.

528
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,145
Publisher's, uh...

529
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,574
Candygram.

530
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,818
What do we do, boss?

531
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,181
Ohh!

532
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,060
Lucky for me, Granny keeps
her merchandise around the cottage.

533
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,654
Disguise was the only way
to catch this girl

534
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,290
in the act of smuggling.

535
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,097
Sweetie-pie! Sugar plum!

536
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,573
Hug your granny, little pudding pop.

537
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,336
Aww!

538
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,309
Boy, that's hot. OK, change of plans.

539
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,312
You can be Granny.

540
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,642
She's coming!

541
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,273
Wa-dee-dee!
- Ohh!

542
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,580
Granny! It's me, Red.

543
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,883
Is everything OK?
- Yeah, sure thing. Come on in.

544
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,354
Pretty thin, Wolf.

545
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,914
You said the old lady
was already tied up.

546
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,052
How did that happen?
- I don't know,

547
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,062
maybe to make herself look innocent.

548
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,496
I just write the news, chief,
I don't make it.

549
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,364
For a reporter, you have
a strange way of doing yourjob.

550
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,029
What can I say?
I was raised by wolves.

551
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,001
Got a way to back this up?
- I got these pictures developed.

552
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,137
That so? Let's have a look.

553
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,745
These are good.

554
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,080
Here's a nice one of you, Wolf.
- Ugh!

555
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,586
I wanna do a gallery show.
A coffee table book.

556
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,748
I don't drink coffee.
A Chai tea latte book.

557
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,757
Photos don't lie, chief.

558
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,588
Good work, Twitchy.
- Arghh.

559
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,323
Now, I want to know more
about this fellow with the ax.

560
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,797
How does he fit into all of this?

561
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:18,131
Maybe you should
"ax" him yourself.

562
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,804
You see? "Ax" him? He was saying...

563
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,071
I'll bring him in.

564
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,173
Ohh!

565
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,214
Hmm. Hello.

566
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,317
My, my. You're a big fellow, aren't you?

567
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,481
Shop at the Big and Tall store?
- This is a big and tall mistake.

568
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,524
I would not hurt a butterfly.

569
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,491
Then what's this? A letter opener?

570
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,495
That's a funny accent
you got there, choppy.

571
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:49,329
I can do the cowboy accent.
Howdy, partner!

572
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,061
Indeed you can.

573
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,763
Say, before you ride off
into the sunset, hopalong,

574
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,965
you think you could
rustle up information?

575
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,507
I will do my best.

576
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,476
How about explaining what
you were doing in the forest?

577
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,776
Oh! I am working
to make good my call-back!

578
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,179
Your what-what?

579
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,184
Paul's Bunion Cream
has a soothing formula

580
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,743
to make the bunions
head for the hills!

581
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:15,020
This guy's a loon.
- Watch it, chief. My mama's half-loon.

582
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:18,620
Your call-back.
You mean, like, for an audition?

583
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,561
Yes! For the bunion cream.

584
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:24,624
I must find my wood-cutting self
to book the spot.

585
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,260
The what?
- The commercial.

586
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,603
He's an actor.
- Oh, boy.

587
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,412
Arghh!

588
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,384
Paul's Bunion Cream
has the soothing formula...

589
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,511
No, hold it! Hold it!

590
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,056
Stop. "Arghh"?
- Uh-huh.

591
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,093
What are you, some kind
of German pirate or something?

592
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,220
I just got the script,
like, five minutes ago.

593
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,196
You're not getting it.
- I'm trying.

594
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,029
My name Kirk.
- Kirk. OK, Kirk.

595
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:00,764
What makes you feel proud
and strong and mighty?

596
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,035
What puts a fire
in your belly, Steven?

597
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,202
Oh! My dream!
- Yes, yes! Your dream!

598
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,905
To travel the world

599
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,108
with the greatest singing group
of all time...

600
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,673
...the Happy Yodelers!

601
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,352
# To yodel for the people

602
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,151
# To hear the applause

603
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,885
# My dream #

604
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,058
Sorry.

605
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,699
Listen. We'll look at your tape
and we'll give you a call, OK?

606
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,235
Thanks for coming in.
Have a nice life. Next!

607
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,539
That was my first audition in months.

608
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,871
Then it was back to my day job.

609
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,006
I drive a schnitzel truck.

610
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,573
It's not such a bad job.

611
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:51,020
After all, I bring much joy
to the children.

612
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,785
# Schnitzel!

613
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,917
Mommy, Mommy!
I want a schnitzel stick!

614
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,358
Ooh, the schnitzel man!

615
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,396
# Schnitzel, the favorite treat
For little girls and boys to eat

616
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,459
# Schnitzel man can serve them quick

617
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,629
# It's a schnitzel on a stick

618
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,536
# No more spoons
Use your hands

619
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,075
# Says the friendly schnitzel man

620
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,270
# Make sure you keep an extra one

621
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,438
# For later in your lederhosen

622
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,755
Schnitzel!
- Ow!

623
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,826
# Schnitz...

624
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,559
What the schnitzel?

625
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,500
My schnitzel truck,
it's been piddly... piddle-llaged...

626
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:39,831
They stole everything!

627
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,630
Oh, that's too bad.

628
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,972
It's not easy being in the
goody business these days, huh?

629
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,511
I'm getting schnitzeled
left and right today.

630
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,410
I cannot even sell the bunion cream.

631
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,473
Now I'm gonna lose my job!
- Chin up, mister.

632
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,850
Maybe someday somebody
will open up a great big goody shop

633
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,412
and we can all work
for that little guy.

634
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,583
Oh, yeah... What?

635
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,990
Uhh...

636
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,187
Hello?
- Kirk! Yeah, baby, listen.

637
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,595
We got the client here,
we looked at your tape,

638
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,897
and we think we might have a real
"Hercules goes bananas" angle on this.

639
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,132
So we want you to come back in.
- Come back in?

640
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,833
It's a call-back.

641
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,139
I had always heard
about call-backs,

642
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,872
but I had never gotten one.

643
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,471
A call-back?

644
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,141
Ahh! What do I do?

645
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,811
You come back tomorrow,
do the same you did today,

646
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,480
only this time you do it good.
Can you handle that?

647
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,786
I will. I can do it!
- OK.

648
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,326
Now, I want you
to go out into the wild

649
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,921
and I want you to find that
tree-chopping side of yourself.

650
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,897
You find your inner woodsman, Curtis.

651
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,402
Don't act like a woodsman,
be a woodsman. Got it?

652
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,868
Yes, I can!

653
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,099
Find an ax, start swinging, OK?

654
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,665
I've gotta be in a circle wipe
across town, but I'll see you at 10:00.

655
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:56,270
I have to go
and find the little woodsman...

656
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,541
...in me!

657
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:01,210
OK. Well, tell him I said hello.

658
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,682
Ay! Ay-ay-ay-ay!

659
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,151
Ooh!

660
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,561
Ha-ha!

661
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:14,928
Goodbye!

662
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,261
Hup, hup!

663
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,097
Sorry, little birds!

664
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,072
Run!

665
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,472
I had done itl

666
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:32,448
I had found
the little woodsman inside of me.

667
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,289
Yes.

668
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,462
Paul's... Bunion...

669
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,293
...Cream...

670
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,927
...has the soothing formula...

671
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,665
...to make your bunions...

672
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:58,038
...head for the hills!

673
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,770
Right!

674
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,541
...bunion...

675
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,041
...cream...

676
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,877
...has the soothing...

677
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,450
...formula...

678
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,587
Hello?

679
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,497
Ohh...

680
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,993
Oh, schnitzel!

681
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,773
Aah! Aah!

682
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,671
Ohh! Ohh!

683
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,839
Aahhh!

684
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,784
I'm taking Granny down,
and you're next!

685
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,344
Aahhh!

686
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:59,400
So you didn'tjump through
the window, you were pushed?

687
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:01,596
Yes.
- By a tree.

688
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:02,660
Yes.

689
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:05,401
Because you were pretending
to be a woodsman.

690
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:07,466
That's right!
- To sell foot cream.

691
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:08,875
I got the call-back!

692
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:10,970
And good for you.

693
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:13,914
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our thespian friend here

694
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,612
knows the least about anything
of anyone in this room.

695
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,881
Exactly! What does that mean?

696
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:21,753
That it all points to Granny.

697
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,920
What about it, Granny?

698
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:30,455
Maybe you're not the sweet goody-maker
everyone thinks you are.

699
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:33,934
Are you stealing recipes
to protect your sugar-coated kingdom?

700
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,562
Oh, no, Mr. Flippers.

701
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,470
The only crime I've ever committed

702
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,408
is making my goodies
unlawfully delicious!

703
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,711
My granny doesn't keep secrets.

704
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:49,013
And even if she did,
she'd tell me about it.

705
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:52,816
We tell each other everything.
Right, Granny?

706
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:55,619
Sure, dear. Mostly.

707
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:59,324
Mostly?
- What are you hiding, old girl?

708
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:03,628
My family worries too much.
I didn't want them to find out.

709
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,101
Find out what?
- Yeah. What?

710
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,401
Hey, chief!

711
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,109
Check this out!

712
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:19,104
When did they make that a sport?

713
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:25,444
I noticed you have three G's
tattooed on the back of your neck.

714
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,826
That's appropriate, since there
are three strikes against you.

715
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:34,129
It's true.

716
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:36,324
I'm not like other grannies.

717
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:41,962
I never did like the quilting bees
and the bingo parlors.

718
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:46,475
I'd rather live life to the extreme.

719
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:50,239
# Here come the real G

720
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:54,983
# She don't need bling-bling
She got a set of wings

721
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:57,281
# From all the fame
and the pain that she brings

722
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,288
# Neck and neck
you know she gets respect

723
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:02,154
# She's like a special effect
with every record she wrecks

724
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:04,159
#You think you see Aunt B
but you get Mr. T

725
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:06,661
# Underneath the beehive
is the new Bruce Lee

726
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,597
# I count to three before you see
a ball of four-foot-three

727
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,157
# With the money for nothing
and her tricks for free

728
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:15,068
# Seventy-five, alive
and a hardcore biddy

729
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,470
# Still making half pipe
hand plants look pretty

730
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,168
# In the woodie with the goodies
for the Jacks and Jills

731
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:23,235
# More power to the granny
with the skills #

732
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:28,980
A trip up the mountain
is too dangerous for a little girl.

733
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:30,849
I'm not so little anymore.

734
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,947
Please, dear, you just keep the recipes
there, and everything will be fine.

735
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,619
But...
- I have to go now. My program's on.

736
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:39,252
Kisses.

737
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:39,662
Time to shred some powder!

738
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:41,960
Time to shred some powder!

739
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:47,064
I didn't have time
for Red to visit today.

740
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:52,234
I was on my way to the big
Xtreme Dream Snowsports Competition.

741
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:55,869
I've been training
three months for this one.

742
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:58,243
Nothing but solid snow,

743
00:41:58,314 --> 00:42:03,081
and the top maniacs are here
to teach this mountain a lesson.

744
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:06,150
# Buck teeth
Bark in my claws

745
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:08,417
# I'm a tree critter

746
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:13,491
# Sticks and stones
are my bread and bones

747
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:14,621
# I'm a tree critter

748
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:17,962
Triple G, what's up, baby?
- Granny, what's happening?

749
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:20,935
What up, my homeys?
You ready to get spanked?

750
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:24,838
So, what's the dizzo, grizzo?
You ready to floss that hill, playa?

751
00:42:24,908 --> 00:42:28,002
Fo' shizzle!
- Yeah, gimme some love.

752
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,876
G, you checking the hardcore
European team over there?

753
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:34,405
Those guys put the Saber-Tooth Brothers
in the hospital yesterday!

754
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:36,975
On the real, it's gonna be
wicked out there!

755
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:39,715
You let me worry
about those player-haters.

756
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:42,986
Oh, I almost forgot.
I made you kids some snicker-doodles.

757
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:44,549
Yo!
- Tight!

758
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:47,027
Yeah, snicker-doodles!
Give it up! Give it up!

759
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,361
Snickadeedoo!

760
00:42:49,432 --> 00:42:52,026
# You can take the critter
out of the tree

761
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:56,004
# But you can't take the tree
out of the tree critter's needs

762
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:59,269
# Now this critter's gotta run
with the birds and the bees

763
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,300
Well, what's your name?

764
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,839
Just put, "To my biggest
and cutest fan, Boingo."

765
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:10,181
And then, like, put some X's and O's
and a little smiley-face.

766
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:12,778
All contestants
to the starting line!

767
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:32,269
Oh, yeah.

768
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,276
[Austrian accent] Be careful,
Granny Puckett.

769
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:38,610
Old ladies get hurt on these slopes.

770
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,740
Bring it, honey.

771
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:46,780
Aahhh!

772
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:48,016
Yo, Granny!

773
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:52,226
I know you did notjust
swing your pole at me!

774
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:56,356
You're little! You're small!
- Yeah? Well, take that, yo!

775
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:58,059
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

776
00:43:58,134 --> 00:44:01,570
Yeah. 
- Watch that skier!

777
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:05,338
Whoa! Look out!
- So it's like that?

778
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:07,774
You wanna play now? Get some of this!

779
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:10,843
Whoa! Whoa!

780
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:15,884
Whoa! Woo-hoo!

781
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:22,782
That must have been right about
when Red called me the second time.

782
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,487
I always forward my phone
when I leave the house.

783
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,326
 Granny?
- What's that? Who's there?

784
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:31,925
Take that, from Mr. Big Muscleman!
- Want some of this?

785
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,229
Ha-ha!

786
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:39,407
Gotta go, munchkin! Bonsai!

787
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:00,894
Uhh!
- Uhh!

788
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:08,693
Ya!

789
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:19,210
Ohh! Aww!

790
00:45:21,784 --> 00:45:24,480
Oh, you're not so bad!

791
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:34,393
Who do you work for?
- I can't tell you that.

792
00:45:34,464 --> 00:45:37,922
Young man, you tell me this instant!
- All right!

793
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,435
We were hired by the Bandit!

794
00:45:40,503 --> 00:45:42,437
Who is the Bandit?

795
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:45,738
Ha!

796
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:49,868
Granny is finished.

797
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:53,347
Now we go after
the little red-hooded girl.

798
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:56,814
Red!

799
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:02,452
Ooh! Ooh! Oohhh!

800
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:11,991
'Afternoon.

801
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:30,415
Oh, applesauce.

802
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:37,215
# Eva Deanna
My sister is your mama

803
00:46:37,293 --> 00:46:40,387
# She fell from heaven
like a loaf of manna

804
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:42,954
Put her in pajamas
and read her a book about animals

805
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:44,795
# The way they sound
and how they look

806
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,164
# She likes to stomp around

807
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:48,135
# She buckles on her shoes
to make it loud

808
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:50,434
# Singing the wheels on the bus
go round and round

809
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:53,771
# I hold her ankles up
so she can dangle upside-down

810
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:57,244
# An avalanche is coming
and I do not feel prepared

811
00:46:57,313 --> 00:47:00,339
It's just Old Man Mountain
showing us who's boss.

812
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02,509
Woo-ha-ha!

813
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:03,916
Ahh!

814
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:05,647
# You can't rearrange her

815
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,690
# She's no stranger to danger

816
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:10,817
# Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh

817
00:47:10,893 --> 00:47:12,520
# With golden locks on her head #

818
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:16,429
I wish I had a video camera! Whoo!

819
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:28,809
# Rolling on the edge

820
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:32,314
# Of the afternoon

821
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,373
# The glow of the sun

822
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,386
# Tells you that your day is not done

823
00:47:38,454 --> 00:47:41,651
# Pay the clock hand no mind

824
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:43,692
# I can't rewind

825
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,696
# But time is a friend of mine

826
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,164
Red!

827
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:54,362
Granny?

828
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:57,338
Use the hood, Red!

829
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,376
Use the hood!

830
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:07,808
Ah, that's my girl.

831
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,453
# Ba-ba, da-dum-ba-ba-ba-ba

832
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,819
# Ba-ba, da-dum-ba-ba-ba-ba

833
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,916
# And it's all right

834
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:19,427
I guess it's just one of those days.

835
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:21,895
# Rollin'in the afternoon #

836
00:48:28,037 --> 00:48:33,031
Whoa... whoa, whoa! Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa! Uhh!

837
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,177
What do we do, boss?

838
00:48:39,248 --> 00:48:42,809
Sweetie-pie! Sugar plum!

839
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:45,479
Boy, that's hot.
OK, change of plans.

840
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:47,147
You can be Granny.

841
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:48,451
She's coming!

842
00:48:48,524 --> 00:48:51,652
Wee-dee-dee.

843
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:54,389
Hi.

844
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:59,190
Granny! It's me, Red.
Is everything OK?

845
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:01,600
Yeah, sure thing. Come on in.

846
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:05,266
Eventually I was able to use
the squirrel to break down the door.

847
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:06,865
Ow! That hurts!

848
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,309
'm taking Granny down,
and you're next!

849
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:11,869
I could've handled
that wolf myself.

850
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,109
But then the craziest thing happened.

851
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:34,465
Honey, don't look
at your granny like that.

852
00:49:34,537 --> 00:49:37,938
I'm sorry, I thought you were Triple G.

853
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:40,475
Or are you the Bandit?

854
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:43,307
Awkward!

855
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:46,914
You're being ridiculous, Red.
- I'm being ridiculous?

856
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,611
You're off living... la vida loca,

857
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:51,710
risking your life for some dumb thrills,

858
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:55,314
and I'm supposed to stay home
and be your happy little delivery girl?

859
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:57,621
I have a...
- Coffee break, anyone?

860
00:49:57,693 --> 00:49:59,957
Yeah.
- Who's got my keys?

861
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:03,760
You think Granny would mind
if I went through her garbage?

862
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,001
Excuse us.
- I thought you were happy.

863
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:07,265
Excuse us.
- I thought you were happy.

864
00:50:07,336 --> 00:50:08,860
Open your eyes.

865
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:11,168
I've never even been outside the forest.

866
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,266
Don't you think I want more than that?

867
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:18,706
Of course you do. You're a Puckett.

868
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:24,549
I don't know what that means anymore.

869
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:48,235
Hey, look! It's Little Red!
- No, it's just some kid.

870
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,711
She's not wearing the red hood.
- There she goes!

871
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,839
Excuse me!
- Little girl!

872
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,714
# Everything is changing

873
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,690
# You're looking for the cure

874
00:51:03,426 --> 00:51:07,795
#And you feel like
you're the loneliest girl

875
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:09,888
# In the world

876
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:15,300
# Trouble in your head, now

877
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:18,135
# You don't know what to do

878
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:22,143
# Seems like up is down and red

879
00:51:22,778 --> 00:51:25,212
# Is blue

880
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:30,651
# Because red is blue

881
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,813
# Doesn't make much sense

882
00:51:32,888 --> 00:51:37,848
# But red is blue

883
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:40,691
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

884
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:44,199
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

885
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:47,030
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

886
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:50,595
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

887
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:59,344
How do you remember
all these recipes?

888
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:01,645
They're all right here
in this book.

889
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:04,743
Every recipe in here
comes from the Puckett family,

890
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,483
generation after generation. See?

891
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:11,617
Now, there's Sylvia Puckett
at the North Pole.

892
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:15,255
She found the best hot chocolate
in the world there.

893
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:17,060
And there's Emma Puckett.

894
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:20,261
She flew cheesecakes
across the Atlantic.

895
00:52:20,336 --> 00:52:23,965
For as long as critters
have had a sweet tooth,

896
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,066
Pucketts have been making
and collecting recipes

897
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,838
all over the world,

898
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:33,644
refining them, giving them
that special Puckett touch.

899
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:37,152
So you see, Red,
when you put that hood on,

900
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:40,746
you carry on a grand tradition.

901
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:44,350
It's a big job, making sure
the world stays sweet.

902
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:50,288
Huh? What's this?

903
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:54,598
Oh, it says,
"World's Greatest Grandma."

904
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,228
Grandma, I can read.

905
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:59,672
It says,
"Battle of the Iron Cage Gladiators."

906
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:02,506
A-ha! Ahh!

907
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:05,611
Granny?
- Listen, munchkin.

908
00:53:05,681 --> 00:53:08,081
If there are two things
your Granny doesn't do,

909
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,913
it's lie and play extreme sports.

910
00:53:09,985 --> 00:53:15,252
# In your heart there's a room
where you lock away

911
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:21,126
All the times
and the things that she said

912
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:27,159
# And now red is blue

913
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:30,069
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

914
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:33,575
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh #

915
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:36,545
Is it a flush that beats a full house?
- No, that's a full house.

916
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:39,537
Is it a flush that beats a full house?
- No, that's a full house.

917
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:41,640
It's not my turn?
- I know about houses.

918
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:44,151
I built mine out of straw.
I'm not an idiot.

919
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,711
Am I gonna get to put the cuffs
on someone, or what?

920
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:47,778
Remember, Ted,

921
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:51,691
pieces of a puzzle make funny shapes,
but they still fit together in the end.

922
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,922
Boy, you're just full of those,
aren't you?

923
00:53:53,996 --> 00:53:57,159
We are closer to the Bandit
than we've ever been before, chief.

924
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,828
The clues to find him
are right here in this room.

925
00:54:00,903 --> 00:54:03,736
In this room?
That's what I've been saying!

926
00:54:03,806 --> 00:54:06,001
Are you telling me
we're back to square one?

927
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:08,236
Hold on, Smokey.
Where's the fire?

928
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,904
Timmy, it's Tommy.
You there? Over.

929
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,210
Am I talking to the wall?

930
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:15,546
If you don't have your walkie,
don't talk to me,

931
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:17,483
but if you got your walkie, let's talk.

932
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:20,249
Put everybody in cuffs.
I'm taking them all in.

933
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:22,916
It's what I do,
that's why I'm police chief.

934
00:54:22,992 --> 00:54:26,450
Timmy, it's Tommy. Pick up.
If you're there, pick up the walkie.

935
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,054
What are zou doing this weekend? Over.

936
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:32,567
We've got this place
locked down, all secured.

937
00:54:36,672 --> 00:54:40,768
It would seem that all of you
came together tonight by mistake.

938
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:45,810
Maybe you naughty neighbors butted heads
so we could get to the real truth.

939
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:48,714
The Goody Bandit.
- That's right.

940
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:50,775
The Bandit's still at large.

941
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:53,253
There's been a lot
of finger-pointing tonight,

942
00:54:53,322 --> 00:54:55,347
but now all fingers point to the Bandit.

943
00:54:55,424 --> 00:54:57,619
Not my finger!
- Oh, no,

944
00:54:57,693 --> 00:55:00,491
you were just out
damaging forest property,

945
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,895
cutting down the redwoods
we all call home.

946
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:05,991
Big guy like you, you could
probably take whatever you want

947
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,093
from little goody-loving creatures.

948
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:11,765
But someone robbed me!
Have we lost track of that?

949
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:14,173
That's right, someone did.

950
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:17,076
Maybe a snack food competitor.

951
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:18,875
Right, Granny?

952
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:21,143
Now, hold on a pea-picking minute!

953
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:25,017
I may lead a double life
full of secrets and deception,

954
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:27,578
but that's no reason to be suspicious.
- Huh?

955
00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:31,251
A woman like you could have a lot
to gain stealing all those recipes.

956
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,785
And that's how she makes
her goodies so good! Huh?

957
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:38,163
Or she could just be another victim...

958
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:41,135
What?
...of a hungry wolf!

959
00:55:41,203 --> 00:55:43,194
The wolf did it. Talk about profiling.

960
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:46,264
Why should we trust someone
who wears disguises for a living?

961
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:50,005
Maybe he's not a wolf at all!
- You got me. I'm a poodle.

962
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,708
Just haven't been to the barbershop.
- Is this all just a big joke to you?

963
00:55:53,782 --> 00:55:57,343
I just followed the girl here.
- You leave my granddaughter alone!

964
00:55:57,419 --> 00:56:00,786
Yes, now we get to Little Red,

965
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:03,381
the girl with the basket on the run.

966
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:07,628
Where is she, anyway?
- I was just...

967
00:56:07,696 --> 00:56:10,665
The recipes are gone!

968
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:24,108
Are you saying Red is the Bandit?
- Not my Red!

969
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,314
Calm down there, Triple G.

970
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,782
The only thing your
granddaughter is guilty of

971
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:31,183
is flying hummingbirds
without a license.

972
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:34,814
It would seem there is
another player in this game,

973
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:38,758
someone who's hippity-hopped
his way through all of your stories.

974
00:56:43,065 --> 00:56:45,727
Yes, there's someone else.

975
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:50,099
The only one who was with Red
when she fell...

976
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:53,005
Ohh!
- No!

977
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:55,043
...who knew a shortcut to Granny's...

978
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,907
Oh, yeah. In fact, I know a shortcut.

979
00:56:56,979 --> 00:56:59,948
...who fraternizes
with evil ski teams...

980
00:57:00,015 --> 00:57:04,213
What's your name?
- Put, "To my biggest and cutest fan."

981
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:06,379
...and someone who was there

982
00:57:06,455 --> 00:57:08,685
when the schnitzel truck
was schnitzeled.

983
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:09,883
What the schnitzel?

984
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,893
Not the bunny!

985
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,260
I knew it. Never trust a bunny.
- Never trust a bunny!

986
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,457
Uh, chief.
- Yeah?

987
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:20,127
No one's seen the bunny or the girl,
and that cable car left the station.

988
00:57:20,202 --> 00:57:23,694
I think we need an APB out
on something small and fuzzy.

989
00:57:23,772 --> 00:57:24,864
I think you're right.

990
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:28,034
Get your boys to Red's place.
We need to head off that cable car.

991
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,477
And bring in a police sketch artist.
No, make it a cartoonist.

992
00:57:31,547 --> 00:57:34,812
We gotta hurry to beat it down.
Bill, get everyone in the cars.

993
00:57:34,883 --> 00:57:37,750
Tommy, you can bring that evidence
with you. Let's go!

994
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,381
You heard the chief, let's move it!
- Not in the same car!

995
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:43,823
Keep it moving.
There's nothing to see.

996
00:57:43,892 --> 00:57:46,452
Who's got my keys?
- Shotgun.

997
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,992
- Did you get any shots of the bunny?
- The bunny? Why?

998
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,038
I told you to take pictures
of everything!

999
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:01,370
Ohh! We gotta get this to print
before it's all over the forest!

1000
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:04,674
Something don't sit right
in my bones about this.

1001
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:10,144
What's that?
- Maybe it's your bones.

1002
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:12,619
I smell schnitzel.

1003
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:18,053
What have they done
to my schnitzel truck?

1004
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:25,132
Why are they going up?

1005
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,636
There's on old cable car station
at the top of the mountain.

1006
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:32,504
We've got to follow them, boys.
Red's up there. I know it!

1007
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:35,338
Get down the mountain.
You gotta stop those cops.

1008
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,879
Run 'em off the road,
dangle a donut, I don't care.

1009
00:58:37,946 --> 00:58:41,347
Tell 'em they're going the wrong way.
- Eezie-peezie! Leave it to me!

1010
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:43,681
You'll never catch 'em in time.

1011
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,211
Is that coffee?

1012
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:50,747
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but... drink up.

1013
00:58:52,928 --> 00:58:54,919
We may want...

1014
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,061
...to stand back.

1015
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,736
Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1016
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:11,636
Caffeine! Yeah, baby!

1017
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:13,943
Whoa!
- Go get 'em, boy.

1018
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:22,256
What...

1019
00:59:22,691 --> 00:59:26,525
...have I done?
- Now the rest is up to us.

1020
00:59:26,628 --> 00:59:28,994
Can I have coffee?

1021
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,747
I don't like it.
The cops are all over the place.

1022
00:59:47,816 --> 00:59:49,010
Forget about the cops!

1023
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:51,382
We've got everything
we need right here.

1024
00:59:51,453 --> 00:59:54,183
What about the old lady?
If she's alive, she'll be back.

1025
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:57,692
You just don't get it, do you,
Dolph? I'm done!

1026
00:59:57,759 --> 01:00:00,387
I'm done dancing for the man!

1027
01:00:00,462 --> 01:00:02,930
The Muffin Man and Granny!

1028
01:00:02,998 --> 01:00:04,932
They can both take a hike!

1029
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,336
I'm never gonna answer
to anyone ever again!

1030
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:12,839
A-ha-ha!

1031
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:21,272
Ah, I just love my job!

1032
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,215
You see how it works, Dolph?

1033
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:26,584
You prioritize, you set your goals,
you write a mission statement.

1034
01:00:26,655 --> 01:00:30,716
You ask yourself,
"Where do I see me in five years?"

1035
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,987
How about behind bars?

1036
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:36,758
Red! Oh, hi, Red! What are you?

1037
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:41,235
You've spoiled the surprise.
- You're the Bandit.

1038
01:00:41,737 --> 01:00:43,364
Surprise!

1039
01:00:43,438 --> 01:00:45,770
I'm walkin' out of here
with those recipes.

1040
01:00:45,841 --> 01:00:47,138
Really?
- Yeah.

1041
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,842
You're a bad bunny.

1042
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:54,178
Oh, somebody's finally catching up!

1043
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:58,948
Did you think I followed you around
on your deliveries because I liked you?

1044
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:06,483
Oh, you best be fearing the ear, baby.

1045
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,225
Ahh!

1046
01:01:13,235 --> 01:01:15,362
Hai-yahh!

1047
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:16,699
Is that all you got?

1048
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:21,567
Ohh!
- Ha! You hit like a girl!

1049
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,138
Come on.

1050
01:01:29,418 --> 01:01:32,387
And ka-blam!

1051
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:39,191
Why don't you go home
and cry to your granny?

1052
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:42,025
Dolph, tie up the brat.
Lesa, hold the book.

1053
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:44,327
Vincent, get the truck. And Keith...

1054
01:01:44,399 --> 01:01:46,959
Darn it, change your name. Please.

1055
01:01:47,035 --> 01:01:49,868
That's not scary,
and I'm embarrassed to say it.

1056
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:52,873
Boris. Try that.
- Hmm.

1057
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:54,408
Keith. You know?

1058
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:57,570
Oh, watch out for Keith.

1059
01:01:58,046 --> 01:02:00,844
You're crazy!
- Maybe so.

1060
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:04,613
But I'm top of the woods now, baby!

1061
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:08,213
# When you're

1062
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:10,656
# Hopping on down the bunny trail

1063
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:12,819
# The critters all seem to look down

1064
01:02:12,894 --> 01:02:15,556
# You're fuzzy and small
Your ears are too tall

1065
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,963
# And goodies make the woods go round

1066
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,092
# Now, I'm not a pig
But you gotta think big

1067
01:02:20,168 --> 01:02:22,762
# When you're competing
with the girl in the hood

1068
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:25,398
# So you won't be a fan of my evil plan

1069
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:28,034
# But I'm gonna be top of the woods

1070
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:31,238
# Now the kids will be packed
with my Boingo snacks

1071
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:32,780
# Construction begins in a day

1072
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:35,909
# And all of the bears
will be ruled by the hare

1073
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:40,512
# As I maniacally plot
from my evil lair

1074
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,585
[Whistling tune]

1075
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:51,465
We've really grown in the past year.
Nabbing all the recipes was phase one.

1076
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:54,798
Now phase two is adding
my own special ingredient

1077
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,030
to every goody.

1078
01:02:56,104 --> 01:02:59,471
A little something
I like to call "Boingonium."

1079
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:02,942
It makes my snacks a little more...
habit-forming.

1080
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,345
Happy customer!

1081
01:03:06,715 --> 01:03:08,945
Phase three gets a little messy.

1082
01:03:09,017 --> 01:03:11,781
I'm gonna need a lot of real estate
down the mountain,

1083
01:03:11,853 --> 01:03:13,753
so I've gotta blow the competition away.

1084
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:15,255
Oh, and that's not a metaphor.

1085
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,815
We've literally got
to blow them away. OK?

1086
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:19,485
Yeah, I got it.

1087
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,586
And now that I have
your granny's secrets,

1088
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:26,225
I'm afraid you'll be taking
the dyno-mite express home.

1089
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:32,439
# You won't be disrespecting
this bunny no more

1090
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:35,169
# 'Cause I'm gonna be top of the woods
Oh, yeah

1091
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:37,143
# I said I'm gonna be top of the woods

1092
01:03:37,212 --> 01:03:38,543
# Let's bring it on home!

1093
01:03:38,613 --> 01:03:42,447
# I said, I'm gonna be

1094
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:45,714
# Top of the woods

1095
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:50,587
# You've been hoodwinked, baby!

1096
01:03:52,527 --> 01:03:55,257
# Oh, yeah #

1097
01:03:55,397 --> 01:03:58,389
Sweet tea and cookies!
We got to do something!

1098
01:03:58,467 --> 01:03:59,456
I know.

1099
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:03,436
The song was catchy,
but the choreography was terrible.

1100
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,531
OK, listen.

1101
01:04:05,607 --> 01:04:08,201
I have an idea, but we need
to get past that ski team.

1102
01:04:08,276 --> 01:04:12,235
The toughest one is the big fella,
really mean-looking,

1103
01:04:12,314 --> 01:04:16,148
with a fat head and a thick skull.
Looks like a shaved ape.

1104
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:19,085
I mean, he is u-u-u-ugly!

1105
01:04:19,154 --> 01:04:22,555
Like a big, swollen, overgrown...

1106
01:04:22,624 --> 01:04:24,649
He's standing right behind me, isn't he?

1107
01:04:24,726 --> 01:04:26,887
Mm-hm.
- Ahh!

1108
01:04:32,234 --> 01:04:33,258
Ah.

1109
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:41,041
Ohh! Ohh!

1110
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:42,940
Whoa!

1111
01:04:43,011 --> 01:04:44,035
Whew!

1112
01:04:44,112 --> 01:04:47,513
Who taught you how to drive?
- Almost hit a squirrel. That was close.

1113
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:49,573
Whee-yahh!

1114
01:04:56,758 --> 01:04:58,555
What's the big idea?

1115
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,822
I could've made road pizza
out of you, kid!

1116
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:06,496
What's he saying?
- What is it, boy?

1117
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:09,731
Truck. Trouble at the mill!

1118
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:12,000
Is the barn on fire?

1119
01:05:12,073 --> 01:05:15,270
The barn's on fire! The well!
Timmy's stuck in the well!

1120
01:05:15,343 --> 01:05:19,507
Hold on. He seems to be
speaking words of some kind.

1121
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:20,946
Pffsst!

1122
01:05:21,783 --> 01:05:24,547
You're a delivery girl.
Then could you do me a favor?

1123
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:26,644
Could you take this down the mountain?

1124
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:30,020
'Cause it absolutely, positively
has to be there tonight!

1125
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:32,719
I'm sorry. What?
I can't quite... with the...

1126
01:05:32,794 --> 01:05:37,197
You got something right there
across your mouth!

1127
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,934
You're an actor, right?
So this is your big part.

1128
01:05:41,002 --> 01:05:44,130
This is the role of a lifetime.
Make them believe in you.

1129
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,300
Don't act like an evil henchman,
be an evil henchman. Got it?

1130
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,605
Know what you're gonna say, right?
- Right!

1131
01:05:51,413 --> 01:05:54,280
Mr. Rabbit?
- Dolph! Where have you been?

1132
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:57,876
You nim-witted Eurotrash with the...
What is that, a ski mask?

1133
01:05:57,953 --> 01:06:00,786
I like that. See, that's scary.
That's good.

1134
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:04,053
Boss...
- What? Say it! Spit it out!

1135
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,492
What's going on?
- Boss...

1136
01:06:07,562 --> 01:06:10,258
Paul's Bunion cream
has the soothing formula...

1137
01:06:10,332 --> 01:06:13,733
Hi there. What he means to say
is that I'm the building inspector.

1138
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,667
Yes.
- I just need to tap the pipes

1139
01:06:15,737 --> 01:06:17,398
to see if your wiring's up to par.

1140
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:22,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it. You're not...
No. You can't touch anything in here.

1141
01:06:22,077 --> 01:06:23,510
Let's walk.

1142
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,579
Let me level with you.
You're an evil genius, right?

1143
01:06:27,649 --> 01:06:32,109
Well, I don't know
if I'd say genius, you know.

1144
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:33,814
I was asked to join Mensa.

1145
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,619
You got an evil lair in a cave,
that's standard,

1146
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:39,524
but see, most masters of evil
that we deal with

1147
01:06:39,594 --> 01:06:41,926
are up to evil genius code.

1148
01:06:41,997 --> 01:06:43,931
Are you familiar with the code?

1149
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:48,436
You know, I'm more of a
do-it-yourself kind of guy. Yeah.

1150
01:06:48,503 --> 01:06:51,199
I understand.
Thinking about putting in a laser?

1151
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:53,764
I don't know. I don't...
Do you think I should?

1152
01:06:53,842 --> 01:06:56,970
Well, it's standard equipment
for a cave lair.

1153
01:06:57,045 --> 01:06:59,445
I'm not saying you're
gonna zap someone today,

1154
01:06:59,514 --> 01:07:02,915
but you gotta think about the future.
They gotta be calibrated.

1155
01:07:02,984 --> 01:07:06,943
You gonna do that yourself?
- Well, I... I...

1156
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:09,217
We should take a look
at that power grid.

1157
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,589
OK. Yeah, sure, sure.

1158
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:20,567
Wait a minute.

1159
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:24,695
I smell hairspray.

1160
01:07:25,707 --> 01:07:28,767
A-haaa!

1161
01:07:29,377 --> 01:07:31,277
Come here, you little bunny!

1162
01:07:33,982 --> 01:07:36,143
Huh?

1163
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:39,816
Ooh!

1164
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:40,980
Whoo!

1165
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:42,318
Ha-ha!

1166
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:44,051
Gotcha!

1167
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,232
Get over here!

1168
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,201
Aahhh!

1169
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,600
Hey, Puckett!

1170
01:08:00,408 --> 01:08:03,002
Little Red's gonna take a ride!

1171
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:04,770
And there ain't...

1172
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:06,408
...no...

1173
01:08:06,481 --> 01:08:07,675
...brakes!

1174
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:11,908
Red!

1175
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:24,529
Aah!

1176
01:08:24,599 --> 01:08:26,794
Whoo!

1177
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:29,336
She doesn't trust you anymore, Granny!

1178
01:08:29,404 --> 01:08:31,235
Out of my way, bunny!

1179
01:08:32,707 --> 01:08:36,165
Whoo! Ha-ha!

1180
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:37,404
Ahh!

1181
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:39,470
Uhh!

1182
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:48,754
Dolph!

1183
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,220
Whahh!

1184
01:08:54,596 --> 01:08:57,121
Wow, that's a... that's a long way.

1185
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,632
We could take the truck.
- Let's take the truck.

1186
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:00,963
Yeah, cool.

1187
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:04,904
They go up, you go down.
Gotta help! APB! Get the bunny!

1188
01:09:04,973 --> 01:09:08,306
This squirrel ate the wrong nuts.
- English! What's wrong with you?

1189
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:11,140
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

1190
01:09:22,123 --> 01:09:24,114
Ah... OK.

1191
01:09:24,192 --> 01:09:27,491
The criminal cannot be found
at the bottom of the mountain.

1192
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:29,860
He resides at the top
in a cave fortress

1193
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:32,263
where my companions
are trying to detain him.

1194
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:33,800
Aww.

1195
01:09:33,868 --> 01:09:36,496
That's more like it.
- How do we know he's on the level?

1196
01:09:36,571 --> 01:09:39,472
He threw himself in front of a car.
That's commitment.

1197
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:42,408
No, that's crazy.
We can't get up there in time anyway.

1198
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:46,379
Hey, chief! It looks like
they're coming to us!

1199
01:09:59,894 --> 01:10:00,918
Ahh!

1200
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:05,724
Ohh! Ohh!

1201
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:13,901
A-ha!

1202
01:10:13,975 --> 01:10:17,035
Granny!
- I'm coming, honey!

1203
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:22,850
Grab the hood!

1204
01:10:28,256 --> 01:10:29,723
Aahhh!

1205
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,295
Hold tight!

1206
01:10:57,619 --> 01:10:59,280
Whoo-hoo!

1207
01:10:59,354 --> 01:11:04,053
End of the line, ladies!

1208
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:07,060
Granny!
- You know what to do.

1209
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:10,322
Whoo!

1210
01:11:10,398 --> 01:11:12,491
Oh, wonderful.

1211
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:19,967
No!

1212
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,338
Watch your head.

1213
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:23,377
Oh!
- Ow!

1214
01:11:23,444 --> 01:11:24,433
That hurts.

1215
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,445
Get 'em outta here, boys.

1216
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:32,078
No, no, no, no. Not prison.
- Say Parcheesi!

1217
01:11:32,153 --> 01:11:34,622
Not prison! Not for a cute
little bunny rabbit!

1218
01:11:34,622 --> 01:11:36,317
Not prison! Not for a cute
little bunny rabbit!

1219
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:39,053
Granny, Little Bit, we got 'em!

1220
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:42,460
Not bad for a little cookie maker.
- Thanks.

1221
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:49,270
I guess I must have had
my eyes shut pretty tight

1222
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:52,864
not to see how fast
you were growing up.

1223
01:11:54,108 --> 01:11:57,771
You were really something up there.

1224
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:00,474
I take after my granny.

1225
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:06,651
 Hello, everybody!
Here, we have the book!

1226
01:12:10,391 --> 01:12:13,724
What happened here tonight?
- My granny swooped in and saved me.

1227
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:17,026
And the whole forest!
- It was my Red who saved the day.

1228
01:12:17,098 --> 01:12:20,795
Well, it was a group effort,
spearheaded by myself, of course.

1229
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:25,329
You'll read the story in tomorrow's
column, but I will take a few questions.

1230
01:12:25,406 --> 01:12:28,068
Mr. Kirkendal will be appearing
in our ad campaign...

1231
01:12:28,142 --> 01:12:30,269
I got a call-back!
- No, don't talk.

1232
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:33,371
If a tree falls in the forest,
you'll get three stories,

1233
01:12:33,448 --> 01:12:35,973
yours, mine and the tree's.

1234
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:39,076
Well, a bunny gone bad
is going away,

1235
01:12:39,153 --> 01:12:42,281
and you'll wake up tomorrow
with piping hot tea cakes,

1236
01:12:42,357 --> 01:12:44,291
same as always.

1237
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,386
Ooh!

1238
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:48,053
Those are piping hot.

1239
01:12:48,129 --> 01:12:50,461
So how about that new
delivery system?

1240
01:12:50,531 --> 01:12:52,965
Well, it beats riding a bike,
that's for sure.

1241
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:55,127
# I got horns that hold the muffins

1242
01:12:55,203 --> 01:12:57,330
# And I got horns that hold the pies

1243
01:12:57,672 --> 01:13:00,140
Hey, did you hear about Kirk?
He finally made it.

1244
01:13:04,312 --> 01:13:07,179
Wanna see the show with us?
- I'm allergic to yodeling.

1245
01:13:07,248 --> 01:13:09,682
Now, Wolfie...
- I'm front page material now,

1246
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:11,981
I'm about to crack a story
about the three pigs

1247
01:13:12,053 --> 01:13:14,544
running a home improvement scam.
Houses falling.

1248
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:17,090
I got the wide-angle lenses
for those piggies.

1249
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:19,319
You sure this is the right place?

1250
01:13:19,394 --> 01:13:21,055
Ah.
- Mr. Flippers.

1251
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:22,892
I see you all got my message.

1252
01:13:22,964 --> 01:13:25,194
Glad you could make it.
- What's going on?

1253
01:13:25,266 --> 01:13:28,599
Well, I was wondering if you would
like to come and work for me.

1254
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,195
I could use some fresh talent like you.

1255
01:13:31,272 --> 01:13:33,137
What kind of work
are we talking about?

1256
01:13:33,207 --> 01:13:37,109
You'd be undercover,
on impossible missions...

1257
01:13:37,178 --> 01:13:39,510
...to faraway places.

1258
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:43,016
There's a lot of stories out there
that need a happy ending.

1259
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:46,178
I'm part of a secret organization
that makes sure that happens.

1260
01:13:46,254 --> 01:13:48,586
"Happily Ever After Agency"?

1261
01:13:48,656 --> 01:13:51,090
The woods don't
go around by themselves.

1262
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:53,650
We fight the bad guys,
swing through the windows

1263
01:13:53,728 --> 01:13:55,559
secret-agent-style, right?

1264
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,860
So, what do you think?

1265
01:14:00,234 --> 01:14:01,724
Bring it, honey.

1266
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:05,506
I always did like happy endings.

1267
01:14:06,305 --> 01:14:12,169
