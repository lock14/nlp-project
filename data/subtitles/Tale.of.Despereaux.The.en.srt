1
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:25,238
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,387
<i>there was a brave little mouse</i>

3
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,008
<i>who loved honor and justice</i>
<i>and always told the truth.</i>

4
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:46,673
<i>No, that's not him.</i>

5
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:49,723
<i>That's a rat.</i>

6
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:51,123
<i>And anyone who knows anything,</i>

7
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:53,653
<i>knows there's a big difference</i>
<i>between a mouse and a rat.</i>

8
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:54,711
Ohhh.

9
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:57,655
<i>First of all,
rats hate the light.</i>

10
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,720
<i>They spend their
lives in the darkness.</i>

11
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:04,261
<i>They're also terrified of people,</i>

12
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,372
<i>which is why they slink</i>
<i>and cower all the time.</i>

13
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:07,460
Ooh!

14
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>And as far as telling
the truth is concerned,</i>

15
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,653
<i>well, that's impossible</i>
<i>because, as everyone knows,</i>

16
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,698
<i>a rat can't talk.</i>

17
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,291
Tell me that thing again, please.

18
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:18,898
Come on.

19
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:20,792
Just once, I promise.

20
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:21,940
Tell me one more time,

21
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,639
and I won't ask you ever again. I swear.

22
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:27,649
Fine. We are headed to Dor,

23
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:30,401
one of the most
magical places in the whole world.

24
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,966
No, that's not what you said before.

25
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,496
You know, every place
has something special.

26
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,940
And, in Dor, it's the soup!

27
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,695
Land ho!

28
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,721
Ohhh.

29
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:46,195
It's down below, I tell you.

30
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,244
Give it a heave.

31
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:53,563
I can see it!

32
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:59,485
Ooh, I can smell it! I can smell it.

33
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,964
Oh, I can't wait
to taste the soup!

34
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:10,691
Just stay close.

35
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:11,979
We leave again at 6:00.

36
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,768
You know, we ought to think
about staying here just a little longer.

37
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,779
Don't even think about it.

38
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,062
Remember Shanghai?

39
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:19,663
Yeah, but this place is different.

40
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,947
I mean, this is special.

41
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:27,932
<i>On any given day,</i>
<i>just one whiff from one of the soup shops</i>

42
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,338
<i>was almost like
having a full meal.</i>

43
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:33,800
<i>But on one very
special day every year,</i>

44
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:36,713
<i>the kingdom of Dor</i>
<i>was magically transformed.</i>

45
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,188
<i>In Dor, Christmas was nothing.</i>

46
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:42,791
<i>Well, they still celebrated it,</i>

47
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:45,485
<i>but it was nothing
compared to Soup Day.</i>

48
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,311
Watch it, watch it.

49
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,209
Incoming potatoes!

50
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:54,969
Hurry! Hurry! Excuse us.

51
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:58,008
<i>Every Dorian, young and old,</i>
<i>would flock toward the castle</i>

52
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:01,018
<i>because they knew that,
at that very moment,</i>

53
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,613
<i>deep within the royal kitchens,</i>

54
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:05,510
<i>a masterpiece was being created.</i>

55
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,268
Potatoes coming up!

56
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:15,402
Let's go!

57
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:16,460
Don't forget the parsley!

58
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,165
Make sure it's clean!

59
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:30,844
<i>Everyone knew</i>
<i>Chef Andre was a genius,</i>

60
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:35,141
<i>but they got reminded of it</i>
<i>on the first Sunday of every spring.</i>

61
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:39,144
<i>At exactly 12:00 noon,</i>

62
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:42,512
<i>he would unveil that
year's royal creation.</i>

63
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:56,085
More onions!

64
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:57,142
More onions!

65
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:58,231
More onions!

66
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,351
More onions!

67
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,820
<i>They would jam the town square,</i>

68
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:05,091
<i>and, as the aroma began to build,</i>

69
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,202
<i>so did their anticipation.</i>

70
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,564
- Ohhh!
- Ow!

71
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:12,645
Sorry.

72
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:21,774
Wow.

73
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:25,459
Thank you.

74
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,392
It's my pleasure to announce
this year's royal creations

75
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,858
from the kitchens of Chef Andre.

76
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:35,554
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

77
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,065
Something is wrong.

78
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,692
I need more time!

79
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,006
But we're late already!

80
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,636
This is not right!

81
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,128
Everyone out!

82
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:46,536
Out!

83
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:53,395
<i>Now, it's hard to</i>
<i>be a genius all by yourself.</i>

84
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,563
<i>In fact, sometimes,
it takes a little help.</i>

85
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,366
You changed something.

86
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,697
You're crazy. I did not touch it.

87
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,819
- I can smell it.
- Hmm?

88
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,940
- What's this?
- What?

89
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,573
- This!
- Ow! Garlic.

90
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,112
- Garlic.
- Yeah, a little garlic.

91
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:31,192
- It was already there.
- No.

92
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,249
- Yes.
- No.

93
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:33,372
- Yes.
- Not this much!

94
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:34,459
Ow!

95
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,614
You ruined my soup!

96
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,063
I save your soup!

97
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:41,956
Those people wait all year,
and you want to give them this dishwater.

98
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,914
Dishwater?

99
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:45,194
Dishwater.

100
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:46,312
Dishwater?

101
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:47,466
Ow! Cut it out!

102
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,173
And this year's soup is

103
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,022
a spring tureen

104
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,745
with a <i>mélange</i>
of roasted vegetables...

105
00:07:58,815 --> 00:07:59,797
Oh.

106
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,564
...fresh herbs...
- Mmm!

107
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,261
...and wild mushrooms.

108
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:04,412
Oh.

109
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,272
Roscuro?

110
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:11,658
Roscuro?

111
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,963
Oh. Evening.

112
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,071
I don't have to stand here
and listen to a big talking garbage can!

113
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:25,716
Ha! And I don't have
to stand here and listen to a coward!

114
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,507
- Coward?
- Yes, a coward!

115
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,372
- You call me coward?
- Yes!

116
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:34,691
Oh, no!

117
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:52,940
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

118
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,544
That did it.

119
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:00,443
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

120
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,111
Mmm!

121
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,177
<i>- Bellissima!</i>
- It's <i>fantastique!</i>

122
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:09,096
Roscuro! Roscuro, where are you?

123
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:13,284
Ohhh.

124
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,044
Whoa!

125
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:55,985
<i>Voil?</i>

126
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,188
This is amazing!

127
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,047
Wait till
Your Highness tastes it.

128
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,218
Hmm?

129
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,907
This is...

130
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:17,991
Whoa!

131
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,008
...absolutely...

132
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:24,852
Oh, it moved! My soup moved!

133
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,123
No, it isn't... It did not move.

134
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:28,918
Oh, Your Highness.

135
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,036
- Ahhh!
- Darling?

136
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:33,014
Oh! A rat! There's a rat in my soup!

137
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,652
Madam, I know that this is unfortunate.

138
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,828
And I know that
while on first glance, I might...

139
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,942
- A rat! In my soup!
- No. Please. Shh, shh, shh.

140
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,023
- And I ate it!
- Your Highness, hold on...

141
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,911
- Uh-oh.
- She's right! It's a rat!

142
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,077
- Please...
- Ahhh! It's a rat!

143
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,826
Get me that rat!

144
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:52,781
Now, I really believe
you're jumping to conclusions.

145
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,701
And I'm sure that the
rats you met last time

146
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,914
might have caused you
to create a stereotype,

147
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,513
but... But I... But...

148
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,761
It's just... I'm just...
I'm not really from around here.

149
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,522
I'm... I'm from... Oh...

150
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,639
Oh!

151
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:05,120
That's very aggressive.

152
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,683
Get him!

153
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:07,804
Kitchen...

154
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,120
He's going into the kitchen!

155
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:12,384
Oh!

156
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:18,118
Over there!

157
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,842
Stop that rat!

158
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:22,767
Whoa!

159
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,525
I got him!

160
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:25,646
Uh-oh.

161
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:34,842
He's going near the soup!

162
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,036
There he is!

163
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:41,094
lf... If I could just tell...

164
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:44,329
On the kettle!
That's him, right there!

165
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,542
Look, up there!

166
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,143
Sweetie? Darling?

167
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,989
She's... She's...

168
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,964
She's...

169
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,200
Blimey, she's dead. Get him!

170
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:12,964
Don't let him escape!

171
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,207
We'll get you, you rowdy rat!

172
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:17,862
Oh!

173
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:22,698
No, no, no!

174
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,433
No, not there!

175
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,678
You don't need to be afraid.

176
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:29,688
I know it's dark,
but you'll get used to it.

177
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:32,088
Who... Who are you?

178
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:35,067
Just a rat, like you.

179
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,049
Come with me.

180
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:53,680
<i>When something hurts
this much, there must be a reason.</i>

181
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,721
<i>There must be someone to blame.</i>

182
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,977
"From this moment on, soup,

183
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:11,355
"the making of soup,
the selling of soup, or the eating of soup,

184
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:14,658

00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:25,587

00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:30,162

190
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,177
<i>So think about this.</i>

191
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:46,854
<i>What happens when you make something</i>
<i>illegal that is just a natural part of the world?</i>

192
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,565
<i>You may as well
make flies illegal.</i>

193
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,778
<i>Or sweat. Or Monday morning.</i>

194
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,971
<i>But that's what the King did</i>
<i>out of a terrible sadness.</i>

195
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:03,508
<i>Sunlight left and
the world went gray.</i>

196
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:08,664
<i>Colors faded into each other and</i>
<i>dark clouds filled the sky.</i>

197
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:14,623
<i>And for a long time,
it wouldn't rain.</i>

198
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:23,880
<i>The clouds just stayed</i>
<i>and stayed and stayed.</i>

199
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:35,544
I wish it would rain.

200
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:37,685
You and the whole world, madam.

201
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,608
Ow!

202
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:40,794
Oh, sorry, milady!

203
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:43,869
Well, at least I can still feel that.

204
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:50,659
Louise, do you think
there's a bit of light

205
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:52,392
somewhere in the world?

206
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:53,961
Don't know, ma'am.

207
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:55,596
I think there is.

208
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:59,054
You just need to know where to find it.

209
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:13,027
<i>Okay, remember</i>
<i>when we told you how,</i>

210
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:15,877
<i>once upon a time,</i>
<i>there was this brave little mouse?</i>

211
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:19,363
<i>Well, if you know
anything about fairytales,</i>

212
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,466
<i>you know that a
hero doesn't appear</i>

213
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,774
<i>until the world really needs one.</i>

214
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,251
Oh, look out!

215
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:43,423
Alms for the blind! Alms for the blind!

216
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,285
Excuse me. Excuse me.

217
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,148
Excuse me.

218
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,909
Excuse me.

219
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:26,993
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

220
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:28,238
- Tilling?
- Oh!

221
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,223
Mr. Mayor, hello!

222
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:31,439
Where are you going?

223
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:35,192
Oh, well,
my baby is having a...

224
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,262
No, my wife is having a...

225
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:40,406
Oh, right. Congratulations.

226
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:41,951
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

227
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,770
I'm sorry, I... I really... Goodbye.

228
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:55,018
His eyes are open.

229
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:56,430
Don't worry about it.

230
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:58,125
Sometimes they are.

231
00:17:58,228 --> 00:17:59,692
But he isn't cowering.

232
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,555
He's looking right at us.

233
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:03,961
Don't worry. He'll learn to cower.

234
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:06,071
They all do in time.

235
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,370
But he isn't!

236
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,077
Wow! He's so puny!
And look at those ears!

237
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,450
<i> And, from the very beginning,</i>

238
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,657
<i>Despereaux Tilling heard more,</i>

239
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,374
<i>saw more and even smelled more</i>
<i>than any of the other mice.</i>

240
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:34,809
Despereaux, don't do it.

241
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:46,753
Don't look. Don't look!

242
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:47,871
I won't, I won't.

243
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:56,712
Mmm.

244
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:00,080
<i>Despereaux Tilling</i>
<i>had no idea he was small.</i>

245
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,566
<i>He wasn't just small
in human terms.</i>

246
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:06,106
<i>He was small even for a mouse.</i>

247
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,782
<i>But, to tell you the truth,</i>
<i>he didn't even notice.</i>

248
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:14,175
<i>In fact, in his own mind,</i>
<i>Despereaux was a giant.</i>

249
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,353
We're worried about him.

250
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:27,432
He doesn't scurry. He doesn't cower.

251
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:29,680
At first, we thought he would
grow out of it, but...

252
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:31,604
Well, he scurries sometimes.

253
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:32,946
But not when he's scared!

254
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,030
He just does it for fun.

255
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,599
And he never cowers.

256
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:36,754
We've showed him how, but he...

257
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,251
Well, some kids are slower than others.

258
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:41,367
He'll cower in time. We'll work on it.

259
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,898
- Yes, but...
- It'll be fine, I promise.

260
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:46,403
All right, settle down.

261
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:48,390
Ready, class?

262
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,143
Good.

263
00:19:57,392 --> 00:19:58,824
Mmm! Ah!

264
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,388
Good. Excellent.

265
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,728
- Despereaux!
- Yes?

266
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,843
You didn't cower.

267
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,442
Looks like a sword.

268
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,908
It's a carving knife.

269
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:22,084
It's beautiful!

270
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,618
It's dangerous.

271
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,861
Do you have anymore?

272
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,498
Despereaux, what are you doing?

273
00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:33,002
We're not even supposed to be here.

274
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,606
That's the dungeon.

275
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:36,056
They have rats down there.

276
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:37,584
And they'll eat you.

277
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:39,483
And pull your arms off!

278
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:44,314
How far down is it?

279
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,683
I don't know. No one's ever come back.

280
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,959
How come?

281
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,439
'Cause... 'Cause...

282
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,195
'Cause that's where
you go when you get...

283
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:53,674
When you get...

284
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:54,918
Banished.

285
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,163
What do you get banished for?

286
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,702
Oh, you know.

287
00:20:58,769 --> 00:20:59,980
- Rules and...
- Breaking.

288
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:01,294
- We can't even...
- Talk about it...

289
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:02,412
- Because...
- That's one of the...

290
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,077
Rules!

291
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:08,058
Despereaux!

292
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:11,932
I just want to have a quick look.

293
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,918
We got to get out of here!

294
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,052
Oh, gosh.
- Oh, no.

295
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,238
Oh, jeez.

296
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,423
Uh-oh.

297
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,794
Despereaux! You can't feed them.

298
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:40,699
Hello?

299
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:49,153
Here you go, whoever you are.

300
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,402
Nice.

301
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,229
You are crazy!

302
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:34,708
What I say? I said nothing!

303
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:36,149
Well, you heard exactly what I said.

304
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:37,743
- I say you crazy.
- No, no, no, no!

305
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:54,662
Hurry!

306
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,560
Ha! They look hungry, sir.

307
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,838
Mmm-hmm.

308
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:14,781
Dinnertime.

309
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:32,778
You're not eating.

310
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:35,124
Uh, I was.

311
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:37,459
No, you weren't.

312
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:40,828
Well, I'm just watching, sir.

313
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:44,727
Well, that's not very grateful of you

314
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:47,834
after I've taken you under my wing.

315
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:52,356
Well, I'm grateful, really.
I am.

316
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:54,440
You miss something, don't you?

317
00:23:54,504 --> 00:23:56,329
Uh, no, I don't.

318
00:23:56,492 --> 00:23:58,795
There's nothing up there, Roscuro.

319
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,653
Nothing at all.

320
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,089
Oh, no, I know that! Absolutely.

321
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,902
Uh, nothing!

322
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:08,429
Nothing. Nothing at all.

323
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:10,064
He's a tough one.

324
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,757
You're not gonna turn him.
Nah, you're not.

325
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:17,207
Oh, I don't know. A rat is a rat.

326
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:20,799
It doesn't really matter
where you come from.

327
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:50,720
I'm sorry.

328
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:03,720
He is so weird.

329
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:04,938
No kidding.

330
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,541
That is so beautiful.

331
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:08,917
I wonder what's out there.

332
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:29,160
Doesn't scurry.

333
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,170
Didn't cower.

334
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:32,972
"Didn't cower. Didn't cower.

335
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,449
"Wouldn't scurry."

336
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:37,898
Oh, here's one:
"Drew pictures of cats on his notebook."

337
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:39,919
- No! Cats?
- Oh! I can't imagine!

338
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:43,284
I'm afraid so. Named it Fluffy.

339
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,417
- Oh, I had no idea!
- Oh! That's terrible.

340
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,263
- Despereaux.
- Yes, sir?

341
00:25:51,557 --> 00:25:52,801
Come in, please.

342
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,559
Despereaux, why do you think
you're in school?

343
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:00,999
To learn?

344
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,118
- To learn, yes.
- Yes.

345
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,205
To learn what?

346
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:08,979
To learn
how to be a mouse, sir.

347
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:10,829
That is correct.

348
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,239
And you can't be a mouse if
you don't learn to be afraid.

349
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:15,705
Oh, Despereaux, this...

350
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,623
There's so many
wonderful things in life to be afraid of

351
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:20,513
if you'd just learn how scary they are.

352
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:22,749
Yes. Yes, sir.

353
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:27,718
How about his brother?

354
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,063
His brother? What about him?

355
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:31,982
Yes, is he, you know, timid?

356
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,599
Oh! Oh, yes!

357
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:36,364
- Yes, very timid.
- Yes. So timid!

358
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:38,096
As timid as the day is long.

359
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,474
Good. Good.

360
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,227
Sometimes they just need
to see the older ones do it.

361
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,793
No one starts out afraid.

362
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:45,913
- Understood.
- Of course.

363
00:26:46,653 --> 00:26:48,119
- You coddle that boy, that's the problem.
- No.

364
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:49,208
- Yes, you do.
- No, no.

365
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:51,224
- Yes, you do. You've been doing it for years.
- He was always...

366
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,315
He's little. I've had to help him.

367
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,973
He's not going to be afraid unless
you allow him to be afraid.

368
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:56,324
Well, Furlough will teach him.

369
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:03,365
Do what he does.

370
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:04,618
And don't do anything he doesn't.

371
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,032
And if he's afraid of something...

372
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:07,725
Then you need to be afraid of it, too.

373
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:28,833
Oh!

374
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,536
Wow.

375
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,657
Come on, Furlough, hurry up!

376
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:54,557
Whoa...

377
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:08,207
All right, now, you start
nibbling right along that edge there.

378
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:12,245
The glue is all right,
but it's the pages that taste the best.

379
00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:16,689
Hmm. "Once upon a time."
That's great, isn't it?

380
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:18,514
"Upon a time."

381
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:20,544
And they don't even tell you
what time that is yet.

382
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,367
It's like you have to find that out.

383
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,340
You're not supposed to read it, Despereaux.
You're supposed to eat it.

384
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,868
Good. I'll come back in an hour.

385
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:34,188
And no reading! It's a rule.

386
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,940
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there lived a fair princess,</i>

387
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:54,210
<i>fairer than any in any other land.</i>

388
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:57,056
Hmm. Fair.

389
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:02,624
<i>And, as the story goes,</i>
<i>she was locked up in a faraway castle,</i>

390
00:29:02,732 --> 00:29:06,051
<i>where she could see the world</i>
<i>but could never touch it.</i>

391
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,676
<i>She longed for a prince.</i>

392
00:29:11,477 --> 00:29:14,449
<i>A brave knight who would</i>
<i>deliver her from all of this.</i>

393
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:18,299
<i>Someone with courage</i>
<i>and honor and decency.</i>

394
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,109
<i>But in a cruel and
frightened world,</i>

395
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:28,190
<i>men like this were scarce indeed.</i>

396
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:10,544
<i>They lived in a special world</i>

397
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:14,348
<i>built on courage and
chivalry and honor.</i>

398
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:16,691
<i>They pledged their
lives to each other.</i>

399
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,281
<i>To fight for truth,
to defend the weak,</i>

400
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:23,963
<i>to seek justice, and to always...</i>

401
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:29,765
How was the library?

402
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:30,879
Fine.

403
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:33,093
Spoil your appetite?

404
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:35,593
No. Helped it, actually.

405
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:37,738
Made me hungrier.

406
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:40,428
Good lad.

407
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,725
Ha-hah!

408
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:50,417
Did you see they're putting up
a new front on the crumb shop?

409
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:53,048
Oh! But I loved the old front.
- Quite modern. Yes.

410
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,731
<i>Did a book ever speak to you?</i>

411
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:04,429
<i>Almost like it was
written for you?</i>

412
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:06,991
<i>Despereaux loved it all.</i>

413
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:08,905
<i>Every bit of it.</i>

414
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:12,304
<i>The truth, the justice,
the bravery,</i>

415
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:14,290
<i>the sword-fighting.</i>

416
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,001
<i>He even loved things
you wouldn't suspect.</i>

417
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:22,235
<i>The story said she was a prisoner,</i>

418
00:31:22,302 --> 00:31:24,377
<i>but that wasn't totally true</i>

419
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:28,292
<i>because she had hope,</i>
<i>and whenever you have hope,</i>

420
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:30,434
<i>you're never really
anybody's prisoner.</i>

421
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,090
Someday, my prince will come.

422
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:35,653
<i>But how did she know that?</i>

423
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:37,926
Yeah, how did she know that?

424
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:25,664
Why are you crying?

425
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:29,696
Why are you crying?

426
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:32,705
Down here.

427
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:34,246
Are you a rat?

428
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:35,617
No.

429
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,287
What are you? A mouse?

430
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:41,552
I am a gentleman.

431
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:45,867
And how do you do?

432
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:49,232
You're sad.

433
00:32:50,044 --> 00:32:51,059
Yes.

434
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:52,405
Because you have longing.

435
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:55,988
You're a strange little mouse.

436
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:57,753
Thank you.

437
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:02,531
Come on.

438
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,631
Where did you hear that?

439
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:14,027
About the longing.

440
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:15,379
In a story.

441
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,421
A story? About what?

442
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,502
About a princess, like you,
in a castle, like this.

443
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:24,381
Oh. You're a smooth little mouse,
aren't you?

444
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:27,969
Bet you tell that to all the princesses.

445
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,112
I am sworn to tell the truth.

446
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,749
It is a code of honor.

447
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:36,392
Ah. Not just a gentleman,
an honorable gentleman.

448
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:40,393
Well, then, how does this story end

449
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,571
with this princess
who's locked in a castle?

450
00:33:42,643 --> 00:33:44,018
I don't know...

451
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:45,771
I haven't finished it yet.

452
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,149
I'd love to know.

453
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:51,034
Oh, I wish it would rain.

454
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:53,492
I wish there was soup again.

455
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,704
I even wish there were rats!

456
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,493
Will you promise me that?

457
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:01,019
Will you promise to finish your story
and tell me how it ends?

458
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,910
Yes. It will be my quest.

459
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:08,106
Your quest! You are a very brave mouse.

460
00:34:14,258 --> 00:34:16,334
Thank you, my good gentleman.

461
00:34:22,363 --> 00:34:23,380
Whoa!

462
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:26,969
Whoa.

463
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:37,090
Whoa!

464
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:53,593
<i>Now, there are</i>
<i>all kinds of princesses.</i>

465
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:57,118
<i>Some are born that way,</i>

466
00:34:57,215 --> 00:34:58,844
<i>some marry into it,</i>

467
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:02,526
<i>and some are destined
to be princesses</i>

468
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:03,975
<i>only in their own minds.</i>

469
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:07,203
<i>But at one time or another,</i>

470
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:10,212
<i>every little girl
longs to be a princess.</i>

471
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:14,026
I'm gonna live right there.

472
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:16,947
Right up there, near the tippy-top.

473
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:21,399
Quit your daydreaming
and feed those swine!

474
00:35:22,073 --> 00:35:24,533
Yes, I know. It's gonna be all mine.

475
00:35:25,278 --> 00:35:29,986
No, you deaf little urchin.
I said feed those swine!

476
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:35,552
<i>Miggery Sow had been</i>
<i>shoveling slop</i>

477
00:35:35,657 --> 00:35:37,633
<i>for as long as she could remember.</i>

478
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:41,484
<i>Her Uncle Ned had put a shovel in her
hand from the minute she could hold one.</i>

479
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:44,200
<i>But it turned out all right</i>

480
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:46,217
<i>because she got on</i>
<i>quite nicely with the pigs.</i>

481
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:47,701
That's right.

482
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,737
I'm gonna have a special room
just for my dresses

483
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:55,445
and another whole closet
just for my knickers!

484
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:59,295
<i>In fact, Miggery Sow could</i>
<i>see her future so clearly.</i>

485
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:03,872
<i>She could see the tiara, the fancy dresses,</i>
<i>the maids-in-waiting,</i>

486
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:07,392
<i>and when things got</i>
<i>really bad around the farm,</i>

487
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:11,694
<i>she could see the moment that she would
finally be delivered from all of this.</i>

488
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:13,455
Not long now.

489
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:15,147
I promise you that.

490
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:20,048
20 for the big ones,
15 for the sow, and 12 for the girl.

491
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:22,963
15 for the girl, same as the sow.

492
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,864
I told you! I told you
I'd make it to the castle!

493
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,398
Whoa!

494
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:34,048
<i>So sometimes, it doesn't take much</i>
<i>for your dreams to come true.</i>

495
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:37,736
<i>You just have to be
able to see it that way.</i>

496
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:41,859
She was beautiful! Like an angel.

497
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,946
You are crazy.

498
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:46,668
And she smelled so amazing.

499
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:48,366
Like a garden.

500
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:49,837
Despereaux!

501
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:51,821
You can't talk to a human.

502
00:36:51,928 --> 00:36:53,335
That is the worst thing you can do.

503
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:55,259
No, it's the best thing I ever did.

504
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,730
They will throw you in the dungeon.

505
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,293
You will get eaten by rats!

506
00:36:58,367 --> 00:36:59,580
It would be worth it.

507
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:01,890
They could tear at my flesh.

508
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,297
Oh, this is bad.

509
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:05,702
Oh, and when she held me
in her hand, it was...

510
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:09,448
It was so soft,
like floating in a pillow.

511
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:11,179
You know what? I'm worried about you.

512
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:13,097
That's the point, Furlough.

513
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:14,893
There's nothing to be afraid of.

514
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:16,904
Quiet! They will hear you.

515
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:18,671
Come on. Just try it.

516
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:21,556
Just for a second, just try being brave.

517
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,476
- Oh!
- And stop cowering!

518
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:25,753
What's going on in here?

519
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,297
What's all this talk
about princesses and bravery?

520
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:33,789
Furlough, I want to see you
in my study, right now.

521
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:39,333
Are you sure?
- That's what he said.

522
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:41,741
- A real human?
- A princess.

523
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:44,390
We need to tell them.

524
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,991
We need to tell the Mouse Council.

525
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,304
- But they'll...
- This is bad. This is very bad.

526
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:51,244
If they find out...
If they find out that they didn't find out...

527
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:54,255
Oh, then they'll find
out that it was me who...

528
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:55,378
Oh, no.

529
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:57,527
But they will send him to the dungeon!

530
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:00,375
- Oh, he'll get eaten by rats!
- Oh!

531
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,911
No, not if we beg.

532
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:05,852
If we really beg
and show them that he's changed.

533
00:38:06,246 --> 00:38:07,525
That he's afraid.

534
00:38:07,594 --> 00:38:10,944
That he's afraid,
and he's turned into a real mouse.

535
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:13,003
Despereaux!

536
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,658
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>destiny is a funny thing.</i>

537
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:28,728
<i>We go out to meet it,</i>
<i>and we don't always know that we are.</i>

538
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:39,391
For glory and honor!

539
00:38:39,498 --> 00:38:40,906
Surround him!

540
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:58,970
Despereaux Tilling.

541
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:04,738
How long have you been
working on this book?

542
00:39:04,804 --> 00:39:06,716
Hmm... A week?

543
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,964
A week? You've hardly cracked it.

544
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,200
Well, I was...

545
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:14,217
I just wanted to see how it ends.

546
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:26,515
Refused training as a mouse.

547
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:29,907
Refused to respect the will
and guidance of elder mice.

548
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,852
Repeatedly engaged in bold
and un-meek behavior.

549
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:38,748
Triggered willfully
not less than 17 mousetraps.

550
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:40,993
Just shameful!

551
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,206
Had personal contact with...

552
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:44,869
With...

553
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:48,842
With a human being.

554
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:52,816
Isn't there something you can do?

555
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:54,862
Antoinette, stop right now! Stop that.

556
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,344
You have to trust them.

557
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,907
They are the Council.

558
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,086
They're the Council because...

559
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:02,775
Because they're the Council.

560
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:05,763
They're the Council.

561
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,065
Is there anything you wish to say
in your defense?

562
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,647
Well, it was a very good story,

563
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:16,838
and she was a very beautiful princess.

564
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:21,331
Despereaux Tilling,

565
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:24,849
our laws are here
to protect us and our way of life.

566
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,852
And when one of our citizens
strays from that way of life,

567
00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:31,386
he becomes a threat to us all.

568
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:33,793
It's an easy question.

569
00:40:34,658 --> 00:40:36,930
Are you a man or are you a mouse?

570
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:41,158
And your actions have told us

571
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:44,130
that you have a great deal
of trouble being a mouse.

572
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,307
It is the judgment of this court

573
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:49,866
that you should be banished
from these walls forever.

574
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:54,163
You shall be remanded into the
custody of Hovis, the Threadmaster,

575
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:57,365
who will prepare you for your
descent into the dungeons of Dor,

576
00:40:57,434 --> 00:41:00,886
from which no mouse
and no light has ever escaped.

577
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,564
- Shh!
- My baby!

578
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:18,151
Quiet. Be quiet, my dear.
There's nothing to be done.

579
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:44,040
Come with me.

580
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:53,460
Stand there.

581
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:05,368
Red?

582
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:07,523
Ah, so they tell me.

583
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:11,687
So you're the brave one.

584
00:42:12,745 --> 00:42:13,828
I guess.

585
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,354
It's good. It'll carry well down there.

586
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,562
Wear it proudly.

587
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,833
There's no shame.

588
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,810
It's time.

589
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:31,736
It's all right.
They're too scared to come down here.

590
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:39,103
In there?

591
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:40,892
I'm afraid so.

592
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:44,128
Courage, right?

593
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:45,512
And truth.

594
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:47,950
- And honor.
- Good.

595
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:50,506
But especially courage.

596
00:43:01,854 --> 00:43:02,835
I'm ready.

597
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:04,886
All right, then you need to...

598
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,718
What? Whoa!

599
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:39,523
Hello? Hello?

600
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:43,100
Whoa!

601
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:48,073
Lads, let's go, on the double!

602
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,742
Who is that?

603
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:54,575
Who goes there?

604
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:56,656
Who is that?

605
00:44:56,726 --> 00:44:58,189
Despereaux Tilling.

606
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:00,403
Are you a man or are you a mouse?

607
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:04,726
I am a gentleman.

608
00:45:05,086 --> 00:45:06,496
Oh.

609
00:45:08,033 --> 00:45:09,528
- It's a mouse.
- I'm hungry.

610
00:45:09,634 --> 00:45:12,540
Shh! Quiet, lads. Patience.

611
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,255
And what makes you a gentleman?

612
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:17,957
A code...

613
00:45:18,027 --> 00:45:19,272
A code of honor.

614
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,472
You're a strange little
mouse, aren't you?

615
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:24,912
And where did you find
this code of honor?

616
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,868
Well, in a legend.

617
00:45:26,966 --> 00:45:28,310
A legend that I read.

618
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:31,029
Fine. Oh, tell me this legend of yours.

619
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,271
I could do with a good story right now.

620
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:34,840
Well,

621
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,246
it's about a princess and a knight

622
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,280
and his quest to save her honor.

623
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,939
Ah. It was a princess
that took away my soup.

624
00:45:44,424 --> 00:45:45,853
She didn't take it.

625
00:45:45,928 --> 00:45:47,971
In fact, she misses it, too!

626
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,271
How do you know all this, then?

627
00:45:51,343 --> 00:45:52,392
I've seen her.

628
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,381
- Seen her?
- I've talked to her.

629
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,818
- Talked to her?
- That's why they sent me down here.

630
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,125
Mmm-hmm.
And what did this princess tell you

631
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:00,784
when you had your little audience?

632
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:02,231
Eh? Eh?

633
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,983
Oh, you must be a royal mouse.
Is that it?

634
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:08,824
She told me that
she missed the soup and the rain

635
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:11,362
and, most of all, the sunlight.

636
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,528
And that she just
wanted it all to come back again.

637
00:46:17,802 --> 00:46:19,332
Well, I don't want to
hear your little stories

638
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:21,261
about princesses and sunshine.

639
00:46:22,191 --> 00:46:23,950
Go tell them to the rats!

640
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:31,571
All right, boys, come on!

641
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:11,744
Good crowd, isn't it, sir?

642
00:47:12,325 --> 00:47:14,267
Yes, it is, quite.

643
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:16,385
Mouse! Mouse!
Mouse! Mouse!

644
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,286
Ah, Roscuro! I'm glad you could make it.

645
00:47:26,353 --> 00:47:28,746
I thought you didn't like the arena.

646
00:47:28,853 --> 00:47:31,856
Huh? Oh! No, no.
It... It's an honor, sir.

647
00:47:32,506 --> 00:47:33,522
Oh!

648
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:34,771
Good.
- Mmm.

649
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:36,884
Well, enjoy.

650
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:40,216
Oh, uh... Thank you.

651
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,918
Let the games begin!

652
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:02,289
Mouse! Mouse! Mouse!

653
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,282
Come on!

654
00:49:03,063 --> 00:49:04,046
Hold on!

655
00:49:10,142 --> 00:49:12,383
Eat! Eat! Eat!

656
00:49:21,931 --> 00:49:22,914
Wait!

657
00:49:23,246 --> 00:49:26,893
Can I have him?
Can I have this one? Please?

658
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:31,371
What?

659
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:34,931
It's just that that one looks tasty.

660
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:37,620
Well, this is progress.

661
00:49:37,692 --> 00:49:41,690
Perhaps we're starting
to leave the past behind us, eh?

662
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:44,098
Enjoy, my friend.

663
00:49:44,196 --> 00:49:46,336
Don't leave a morsel.

664
00:49:46,437 --> 00:49:48,644
Oh, I won't.

665
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:51,584
Pull!

666
00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:09,629
Come on, let's go, buster!

667
00:50:09,982 --> 00:50:12,854
That's it. That's it. You keep moving!

668
00:50:14,851 --> 00:50:17,571
It's okay. Keep walking.

669
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:21,217
Come on, keep moving! Let's go, come on!

670
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:24,524
It's right up there.

671
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:33,840
- Huh?
- Keep walking.

672
00:50:41,183 --> 00:50:42,493
- Oh.
- See that?

673
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,280
Light. Real light.

674
00:50:46,725 --> 00:50:49,093
It's mine, but you can share it.

675
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:53,568
It isn't much, but there isn't much
anywhere since everything turned gray.

676
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:57,096
You're not gonna eat me?

677
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,659
No. I don't eat mice.

678
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:01,363
Then what do you eat?

679
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:02,670
Crumbs.

680
00:51:02,742 --> 00:51:04,018
When I can find them.

681
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:07,703
So you are a gentleman.

682
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:11,861
Tell me that story.

683
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,175
About the Princess.

684
00:51:14,976 --> 00:51:16,769
Tell me what she looked like.

685
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:19,041
Well, she was...

686
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,353
Was she angry?

687
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:21,603
No.

688
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:23,299
No, not at all.

689
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,188
Her heart was full of longing.

690
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:29,257
What's longing?

691
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:33,877
<i>And that's</i>
<i>how a friendship is born.</i>

692
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:38,417
<i>Over the next few weeks, he told Roscuro</i>
<i>everything he knew about loyalty</i>

693
00:51:38,524 --> 00:51:40,760
<i>and honor and
chivalry and courage.</i>

694
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:44,029
<i>He told him about the Princess,</i>
<i>and where her longing came from.</i>

695
00:51:44,128 --> 00:51:47,809
<i>That she missed the rain and
the soup and even the rats.</i>

696
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:50,110
Even the rats?

697
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:54,822
<i>He told him about their</i>
<i>code of honor, about his noble quest,</i>

698
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:57,451
<i>about duty and loyalty.</i>

699
00:51:57,967 --> 00:52:00,938
<i>And there, in the
darkness of the cellar,</i>

700
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:05,938
<i>two knights pledged devotion to a
princess who was trapped inside a castle.</i>

701
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:09,618
<i>Trapped in a life full
of pain and longing.</i>

702
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:11,548
<i>Even if no one could tell.</i>

703
00:52:15,522 --> 00:52:17,278
Your crown, ma'am.

704
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,518
Oh.

705
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:22,047
I don't want it today.

706
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,846
But it's beautiful, ma'am.

707
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,246
I know, but I don't want it.

708
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:28,807
You look so pretty in it, ma'am.

709
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,704
Like a princess.

710
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:33,833
I know. I am the princess.

711
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:35,565
Oh, I know, ma'am,

712
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:39,701
but such a fine princess,
with a little, pretty, glittery...

713
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:41,333
I don't want it!

714
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:42,780
All right, Mig?

715
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,305
Very well, ma'am.

716
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:47,549
Please, take it away.

717
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:04,906
Princess.

718
00:53:06,006 --> 00:53:07,437
Who's the princess?

719
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:09,619
I'm a princess.

720
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,547
I'm the princess.

721
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:17,953
My comb, my hat, my gloves

722
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:22,783
and my pretty powder

723
00:53:22,857 --> 00:53:25,312
on my pretty princess face.

724
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:27,558
And what do you think you're doing?

725
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,613
Ma'am!

726
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:31,175
Where did you get all this?

727
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,038
I just borrowed it, ma'am.

728
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:34,188
Borrowed it?

729
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:36,460
I was gonna put them all back.

730
00:53:36,598 --> 00:53:37,877
See that you do!

731
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,042
And you can spend the whole week

732
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:43,900
taking slop to the dungeon

733
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:45,976
for your little escapade.

734
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:48,127
"Princess"!

735
00:53:51,622 --> 00:53:54,407
God! She's the princess.

736
00:53:55,627 --> 00:54:00,072
And now I have to carry the sloppy,
gloppy, stinky stew

737
00:54:00,143 --> 00:54:02,732
down in the damp, dark, dingy...

738
00:54:04,884 --> 00:54:07,122
A person could get
lost forever down here.

739
00:54:09,144 --> 00:54:10,194
Oh!

740
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:12,786
Din-din.

741
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:15,222
Slop.

742
00:54:17,536 --> 00:54:21,054
No, don't stop! I said "slop"!

743
00:54:25,802 --> 00:54:28,105
How am I supposed to eat this swill?

744
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:32,302
Oh, stop that!
I don't have to be putting up with all this!

745
00:54:33,745 --> 00:54:35,373
I serve the Princess.

746
00:54:37,463 --> 00:54:40,018
Right. You serve the Princess.

747
00:54:40,121 --> 00:54:42,907
- That's a bit of a laugh, isn't it?
- I do.

748
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:45,625
- I bring her tea and...
- Well, I don't want to hear it!

749
00:54:46,464 --> 00:54:48,352
Had me own little princess once.

750
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:50,045
And now I don't.

751
00:54:50,468 --> 00:54:52,959
Oh. What, you had a princess?

752
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:55,808
Yeah.

753
00:54:55,882 --> 00:54:58,090
Every dad's got a princess.

754
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:00,774
<i>Till he stops being a dad,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

755
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:06,386
Sorry. So, so, sorry!

756
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:09,845
Oh, well, I've got a real one.

757
00:55:09,943 --> 00:55:12,882
And she's got a tiara and fancy robes,

758
00:55:12,988 --> 00:55:15,609
and she's got shiny bits
all over every frock in her closet.

759
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,464
And I get to see her every single day.

760
00:55:19,523 --> 00:55:21,017
What kind of a quest?

761
00:55:21,124 --> 00:55:22,107
Uh...

762
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:24,580
To right a terrible wrong.

763
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:26,922
But who did you wrong?

764
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:30,661
Okay.

765
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:34,766
Do you remember when
they banished the rats?

766
00:55:35,284 --> 00:55:36,878
- Sure. Yes.
- Okay.

767
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:39,575
Well, it wasn't all
the rats they banished.

768
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:43,900
I mean, they did, but it was
all because of one particular rat

769
00:55:44,703 --> 00:55:46,163
in particular.

770
00:55:46,303 --> 00:55:47,286
Oh.

771
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:49,495
Mmm-hmm.

772
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,230
If I could just tell her I'm sorry,

773
00:55:51,299 --> 00:55:55,461
that I'm, you know, I'm really sorry.

774
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:58,148
And that I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

775
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:00,076
If she could just hear me say it,

776
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:02,510
you know, just... Just hear my voice,

777
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:05,710
she would
know how much I meant it.

778
00:56:07,475 --> 00:56:09,202
That is a very noble quest.

779
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:26,310
Your Highness?

780
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:30,956
Your Highness?

781
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:33,388
Is that you?

782
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:34,990
My little mouse?

783
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:37,459
Oh, I'm not a mouse. I...

784
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,284
I'm a...

785
00:56:40,728 --> 00:56:41,712
Oh.

786
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:43,283
I forgot.

787
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:45,720
You're my little gentleman, aren't you?

788
00:56:48,673 --> 00:56:50,583
Have you come to tell me
how the story ends?

789
00:56:50,691 --> 00:56:52,318
Did you finish your quest?

790
00:56:53,478 --> 00:56:54,885
Where are you?

791
00:56:56,007 --> 00:56:57,898
I have come to apologize.

792
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:00,930
Oh, you are noble, remember?

793
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:03,817
You have nothing to be sorry about.

794
00:57:05,392 --> 00:57:06,769
Oh, but I am.

795
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:11,094
I am sorry.

796
00:57:13,947 --> 00:57:15,803
I know you.

797
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:18,261
- No, no.
- Oh, no!

798
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,061
No! Please, please listen. Please.

799
00:57:20,162 --> 00:57:21,470
- A rat!
- Please. I just want to tell you.

800
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:23,098
Someone, please!

801
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:24,351
Listen. It's okay.

802
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:26,756
Get it off me! There's a rat in my room!

803
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,774
Please get him off!

804
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:35,272
What?

805
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:41,902
Rat!

806
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:45,300
Oh!

807
00:57:46,555 --> 00:57:48,467
It's a rat!

808
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,733
Quick, rush him!

809
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:57,855
Get him!

810
00:57:57,961 --> 00:57:59,271
Filthy rodent!

811
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:06,569
Uh-oh.

812
00:58:07,892 --> 00:58:08,875
Oh!

813
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,378
Where'd he go?

814
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:58,210
<i>What would you do</i>
<i>if your own name was a bad word?</i>

815
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:03,718
<i>If John or Beth or
Bill was an insult.</i>

816
00:59:05,198 --> 00:59:08,520
<i>Well, that's how Roscuro</i>
<i>came to feel about who he was.</i>

817
00:59:10,515 --> 00:59:14,350
<i>When your heart breaks,</i>
<i>it can grow back crooked.</i>

818
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,938
<i>It grows back twisted
and gnarled and hard.</i>

819
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:24,418
<i>Even as he changed,</i>
<i>Roscuro still had longing.</i>

820
00:59:25,414 --> 00:59:29,608
<i>But now he just longed for someone
whose heart was as hardened as his was.</i>

821
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:35,912
Pretty princess.
Pretty, pretty princess pie.

822
00:59:36,945 --> 00:59:38,889
What a pretty princess!

823
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:41,744
My gloves.

824
00:59:42,581 --> 00:59:43,761
My comb.

825
00:59:44,986 --> 00:59:47,605
My jewel-y, girly hat,

826
00:59:47,996 --> 00:59:52,156
all sitting on my princess head.

827
00:59:55,396 --> 01:00:00,519
Who's the pretty princess pumpkin pie?

828
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:04,355
You are.

829
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:07,209
Right. I am.

830
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:11,054
You are. And you should be
dressed in those clothes.

831
01:00:11,701 --> 01:00:14,421
Quite right. I should.

832
01:00:14,616 --> 01:00:17,467
Mmm-hmm.
And you should lounge in that bed.

833
01:00:17,564 --> 01:00:18,774
Lounging.

834
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:22,623
Lounging round, yes, the whole day!

835
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,400
And you should be wearing that crown.

836
01:00:26,212 --> 01:00:27,740
I should be wearing a frown?

837
01:00:27,847 --> 01:00:31,395
No. No, no, no. Not a frown. A crown.

838
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:34,565
Wow! Can't hear me own self think.

839
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,315
- Ah!
- Shh!

840
01:00:38,418 --> 01:00:40,361
- Ah!
- Shh!

841
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:41,996
Shh!

842
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:43,762
- Ah!
- Shh!

843
01:00:45,465 --> 01:00:46,874
Who are you?

844
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:48,468
I'm here to help you.

845
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:51,029
I can't be caught with
a real rat in my bunk.

846
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:53,114
I don't think so.

847
01:00:55,138 --> 01:00:57,596
And what if they find you
with a painting of the Princess?

848
01:00:57,669 --> 01:00:59,582
You think that's as bad as a rat?

849
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:01,923
I want the same thing you do.

850
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:14,350
<i>Allo?</i>

851
01:01:19,324 --> 01:01:20,341
What are you doing?

852
01:01:20,573 --> 01:01:21,556
Uh...

853
01:01:22,463 --> 01:01:24,287
I need it for a baby.

854
01:01:26,114 --> 01:01:27,873
No, not a baby!

855
01:01:28,357 --> 01:01:29,341
For milady.

856
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:32,131
I mean milady.

857
01:01:32,778 --> 01:01:33,827
Yes.

858
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:35,495
To chop apples.

859
01:01:35,598 --> 01:01:36,580
Mmm.

860
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:38,062
She'd like some apples.

861
01:01:40,595 --> 01:01:41,708
Now turn and leave.

862
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,634
Now turn and leave.

863
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:49,044
No, no! Just turn and leave.

864
01:01:49,244 --> 01:01:50,936
Oh, right. Sorry.

865
01:01:51,486 --> 01:01:52,467
Sorry. Bye.

866
01:01:52,574 --> 01:01:55,741
Oh, I can't hear you,
see, because deaf, but...

867
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:56,859
A bit deaf.

868
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,336
<i>You know, hurt is a funny thing.</i>

869
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:06,822
<i>The same thing that makes one person angry</i>
<i>can put another person into grief.</i>

870
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:09,514
Here, take care of me little princess.

871
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:11,305
I can't no more.

872
01:02:11,538 --> 01:02:13,995
Oh, I will. Don't worry.

873
01:02:15,992 --> 01:02:17,041
I'm sorry.

874
01:02:17,722 --> 01:02:20,593
Sorry. So, so sorry!

875
01:02:23,646 --> 01:02:26,651
<i>Gregory always said</i>
<i>that she had too much heart.</i>

876
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:30,338
<i>And that's why they had to put</i>
<i>some of it on the outside.</i>

877
01:02:30,406 --> 01:02:31,782
<i>But let's face it.</i>

878
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,402
<i>It's hard to see
something on your back.</i>

879
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:38,440
<i>In fact, you can have a good heart</i>
<i>and not even know it.</i>

880
01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:40,267
You can do this. You know you can.

881
01:02:40,688 --> 01:02:41,868
I know I can.

882
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:46,383
She belongs in the dungeon,
and you belong in the palace, like a princess.

883
01:02:51,837 --> 01:02:52,953
What are you doing?

884
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:55,321
I'm cleaning, ma'am.

885
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,049
With rope?

886
01:02:58,213 --> 01:02:59,197
It helps, ma'am.

887
01:02:59,271 --> 01:03:01,093
Well, stop it. You look ridiculous.

888
01:03:03,593 --> 01:03:04,674
Sorry, ma'am?

889
01:03:04,778 --> 01:03:07,237
I said you look ridiculous.

890
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,475
<i> Ridiculous,</i>
<i>ridiculous, ridiculous.</i>

891
01:03:12,306 --> 01:03:13,902
- You can't do this, Mig.
- Gor.

892
01:03:14,133 --> 01:03:15,694
Seems I am, ma'am.

893
01:03:15,766 --> 01:03:17,176
You'll get in a terrible
amount of trouble.

894
01:03:17,272 --> 01:03:19,184
Don't listen. You're the princess now.

895
01:03:19,259 --> 01:03:20,689
I'm the princess now.

896
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:22,423
And you belong in the palace.

897
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:24,056
I belong in the palace.

898
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,177
And she belongs in...

899
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:27,190
No! You can't do this!

900
01:03:27,265 --> 01:03:30,401
Help! Help! Someone help me!

901
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,358
Help! Help!

902
01:03:33,128 --> 01:03:35,552
Help! Help!

903
01:03:44,245 --> 01:03:46,003
Help! Help!

904
01:03:47,895 --> 01:03:49,305
Help!

905
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:51,928
I'm in here!

906
01:03:53,821 --> 01:03:55,253
Help!

907
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,376
You filthy, stinking rat!

908
01:03:58,466 --> 01:03:59,874
You tricked me!

909
01:04:02,697 --> 01:04:03,743
Here's the spot, rats!

910
01:04:03,815 --> 01:04:05,160
What's Roscuro brought us, then?

911
01:04:05,226 --> 01:04:06,603
Hungry! Yum! Hungry now!

912
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:08,425
Not yet, lads.
No, no, you've got to wait.

913
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:09,868
It's nowhere near dinnertime.

914
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:11,911
Oh, come on, Smudge, I'm starving.

915
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:19,316
Something special
for dinner tonight.

916
01:04:19,672 --> 01:04:21,103
Smells delicious!

917
01:04:23,134 --> 01:04:26,137
Smells human to me. A young one.
- And not just any human.

918
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:28,153
Let's have a look.
- It's the Princess!

919
01:04:28,259 --> 01:04:30,015
Oi, you'll wait
for your dinner like everyone else.

920
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:31,100
Come on, Smudge,
give us a little look.

921
01:04:31,174 --> 01:04:32,222
No, no, no!

922
01:04:32,295 --> 01:04:34,663
Boss doesn't want her getting
nervous. Spoils the meat, doesn't it?

923
01:04:39,216 --> 01:04:40,589
Milady!

924
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,801
Psst! Milady!

925
01:04:43,443 --> 01:04:46,347
Oh, my little mouse! It's you.

926
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:48,787
I will deliver you from this evil, ma'am.

927
01:04:48,887 --> 01:04:50,863
Oh, no. Just go find my father.

928
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:53,240
Take this chain from around my neck.

929
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:55,066
To show him you are honest and truthful.

930
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:58,399
Oh, I am!
Honest and truthful and loyal and...

931
01:04:58,498 --> 01:04:59,547
I know.

932
01:04:59,653 --> 01:05:00,666
But hurry.

933
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,182
Here. Take it.

934
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:03,934
There isn't much time.

935
01:06:10,286 --> 01:06:11,269
Whoa!

936
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:15,433
Ha-ha!

937
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:22,938
Oh, oh!

938
01:06:47,957 --> 01:06:49,520
Hey, did you get some?
- Oh, yeah.

939
01:06:49,622 --> 01:06:50,900
Here you are, sir.

940
01:06:50,968 --> 01:06:52,016
Fresh worms.

941
01:06:52,089 --> 01:06:53,553
Oh, um...

942
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:55,444
Thank you.

943
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:02,745
Well done, Roscuro!

944
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:04,547
You hear that?

945
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:06,788
That's all because of you.

946
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:11,401
Come, my friend. Look at your handiwork.

947
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:37,700
King! King!
Sire, your daughter is in danger!

948
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:39,200
Sire, up here!

949
01:07:40,011 --> 01:07:42,796
Your Highness! Please, sir!

950
01:07:45,201 --> 01:07:46,414
Oh, come on.

951
01:07:47,445 --> 01:07:48,425
Oh!

952
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:54,190
Hey, Sire!

953
01:07:55,227 --> 01:07:56,756
Your Highness!

954
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,901
Look, Your Highness! Look!

955
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:00,253
Hello, Mr. King!

956
01:08:00,769 --> 01:08:01,752
Hey, hello!

957
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:02,842
Whoa!

958
01:08:04,453 --> 01:08:06,080
Down here! Hello! Down here!

959
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,712
Listen, your daughter is in danger!

960
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,092
She's in a dungeon!

961
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:10,538
You're the only one who can help!

962
01:08:10,603 --> 01:08:12,199
She sent me to get you!

963
01:08:12,302 --> 01:08:13,449
Sir, please! Sir...

964
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:15,013
Ooh! Sire!

965
01:08:15,087 --> 01:08:16,431
Your Highness!

966
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:20,658
Look down here! Whoa!

967
01:08:30,879 --> 01:08:32,825
Dad? Dad, listen. You've got to help me.

968
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:34,787
But you're dead!

969
01:08:34,884 --> 01:08:36,480
No. No, I'm not. I'm not dead!

970
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:39,522
Now, listen. The Princess is in danger.
She's locked in the dungeon.

971
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:42,913
Oh, my golly, you're dead.

972
01:08:43,535 --> 01:08:45,509
Dad! Dad, I'm not dead!

973
01:08:45,615 --> 01:08:48,653
Dad, I'm not dead!
Oh, Dad, wake up, please!

974
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:54,712
Furlough, listen. You've gotta help me.

975
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:56,240
You're...

976
01:08:56,347 --> 01:08:57,843
No. No, I'm not dead.

977
01:08:57,948 --> 01:09:00,538
Listen, the Princess is in danger.
She's locked in the cellar.

978
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:03,743
Oh, my God, you're dead!

979
01:09:03,844 --> 01:09:04,828
No!

980
01:09:05,286 --> 01:09:06,301
Whoo!

981
01:09:06,405 --> 01:09:07,715
Guys? Listen.

982
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:09,470
Okay, look. Now, I'm not dead.

983
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:12,198
The Princess is in danger,
and she's down in the dungeon

984
01:09:12,267 --> 01:09:14,791
and you've gotta... You've gotta help me!

985
01:09:14,895 --> 01:09:16,205
Somebody?

986
01:09:28,252 --> 01:09:29,235
Whoa!

987
01:09:33,825 --> 01:09:34,809
Whoa!

988
01:09:42,605 --> 01:09:43,587
Whoa!

989
01:09:52,376 --> 01:09:53,358
Hmm.

990
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:02,456
Oh!

991
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:05,467
Oh!

992
01:10:06,052 --> 01:10:07,231
Oh, ho, ho!

993
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:15,331
Ah!

994
01:10:18,002 --> 01:10:19,280
Whoa!

995
01:10:24,217 --> 01:10:25,262
Oh, I must have been...

996
01:10:30,686 --> 01:10:31,670
Enough!

997
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:37,692
Ah-ha!

998
01:10:40,969 --> 01:10:42,017
Ah!

999
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:27,217
<i>Voil?</i>

1000
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,664
Look at you! You are still brewing tea.

1001
01:11:38,404 --> 01:11:40,994
If you want to make a statement,
what do I say?

1002
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:42,631
Make it a good one!

1003
01:11:43,945 --> 01:11:46,152
Ah, it's so great to see you!

1004
01:11:46,253 --> 01:11:47,466
Fantastic!

1005
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:51,629
- Ah.
- Marjoram?

1006
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:52,911
Mmm-hmm. Love it. Perfect.

1007
01:11:53,013 --> 01:11:54,574
- Ah! <i>Superbe!</i>
<i>- Bellissima!</i>

1008
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:58,966
Basil, will you look at that?

1009
01:12:00,221 --> 01:12:01,204
Oh!

1010
01:12:01,886 --> 01:12:03,930
Look up there!
Marge, come and have a look at this!

1011
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:05,015
Oh, my!

1012
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:11,775
Mmm!

1013
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:17,061
Cauliflower?

1014
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,761
Perfect. Perfect, yes, it's about time.

1015
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,042
<i>Basilico.</i>

1016
01:12:20,594 --> 01:12:21,740
Eh, some celery?

1017
01:12:22,387 --> 01:12:23,501
Hey, hello!

1018
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,101
Good, celery. Parsley, maybe.

1019
01:12:25,559 --> 01:12:27,317
The Princess is in danger!
- No, no, no.

1020
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:29,077
- Garlic! Should I use the garlic?
- Look down here!

1021
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:31,483
- I mean not too much, but just a little bit.
- Oh, no, no, no, of course.

1022
01:12:31,582 --> 01:12:32,925
- It is fantastic!
- Yes.

1023
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,007
<i>Bellissima!</i>

1024
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:35,835
Brav-ow!

1025
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,177
Oh.

1026
01:12:37,347 --> 01:12:39,357
The Princess is in danger!

1027
01:12:39,461 --> 01:12:40,478
Ooh!

1028
01:12:42,664 --> 01:12:44,969
You are a cute little mouse.

1029
01:12:45,774 --> 01:12:47,333
Would you like some soup?

1030
01:12:47,436 --> 01:12:48,452
No, I don't want...

1031
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,667
The Princess is in danger!

1032
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:52,265
And a talking mouse, too.

1033
01:12:52,338 --> 01:12:53,715
Listen, you've gotta help me.

1034
01:12:53,781 --> 01:12:55,309
Perhaps a little cheese?

1035
01:12:55,382 --> 01:12:57,556
No, I don't want any cheese!

1036
01:12:57,625 --> 01:13:00,083
The Princess! She's in danger!

1037
01:13:00,156 --> 01:13:01,749
She's locked in the dungeon!

1038
01:13:02,974 --> 01:13:03,957
In the dungeon!

1039
01:13:04,031 --> 01:13:06,270
Oh, don't be silly, my little mouse.

1040
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:07,864
Everything is fine!

1041
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:10,974
The Princess is perfectly
safe up in her...

1042
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:26,414
Oh, my.

1043
01:13:26,712 --> 01:13:28,140
Boldo!

1044
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:29,775
Look! It's...

1045
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,115
Boldo.

1046
01:13:32,862 --> 01:13:34,072
Where are you?

1047
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:37,342
Charge!

1048
01:13:38,275 --> 01:13:39,322
Tell me again.

1049
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:40,378
- Chivalry!
- Mmm.

1050
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:41,501
- Bravery!
- Mmm-hmm.

1051
01:13:41,608 --> 01:13:42,591
Honor!

1052
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:46,474
Chivalry! Bravery! Honor!

1053
01:13:46,733 --> 01:13:47,880
I love it!

1054
01:13:47,982 --> 01:13:50,919
Oh, it feels so good to
be out of the kitchen!

1055
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:52,841
Let's go!

1056
01:13:53,332 --> 01:13:55,186
Into the breach!

1057
01:13:56,501 --> 01:13:57,485
Down there.

1058
01:13:57,592 --> 01:13:58,903
<i>Andiamo!</i>

1059
01:14:00,345 --> 01:14:01,362
Whoa!

1060
01:14:03,102 --> 01:14:04,150
Ha-ha!

1061
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:11,616
Where did she go?

1062
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,720
My friends!

1063
01:14:16,106 --> 01:14:18,762
My friends, there are rats,

1064
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:24,202
and then there are rats!

1065
01:14:25,684 --> 01:14:28,689
And I would like a huge round of applause

1066
01:14:28,761 --> 01:14:31,096
for our good friend here

1067
01:14:31,161 --> 01:14:35,804
for delivering us our princess!

1068
01:14:38,466 --> 01:14:39,614
Come on, let's go!

1069
01:14:40,997 --> 01:14:44,132
Oi! Hang on! Where you going? Help!

1070
01:14:47,019 --> 01:14:48,034
Hurry!

1071
01:14:49,647 --> 01:14:50,630
Look at that!

1072
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,388
Let's get him, boys.

1073
01:15:01,725 --> 01:15:03,479
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

1074
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:06,231
Keep going! Keep going!

1075
01:15:06,337 --> 01:15:08,159
Please! Oh, no, get off of me!

1076
01:15:12,773 --> 01:15:13,758
Nice shot!

1077
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:17,410
That's my onion!

1078
01:15:38,178 --> 01:15:39,605
Hello?

1079
01:15:39,714 --> 01:15:40,730
Help!

1080
01:15:41,733 --> 01:15:43,644
Help!

1081
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,061
Can anybody hear me?

1082
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:48,513
Help!

1083
01:15:49,547 --> 01:15:51,373
I'm in here!

1084
01:15:53,457 --> 01:15:54,767
I'm in here!

1085
01:15:55,571 --> 01:15:56,980
I'm in here!

1086
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,197
Oh, gor!

1087
01:16:06,943 --> 01:16:08,505
What took you so long?

1088
01:16:08,609 --> 01:16:12,027
I've been screaming in here
for over two hours.

1089
01:16:13,768 --> 01:16:16,069
My little princess.

1090
01:16:19,886 --> 01:16:20,932
Rain.

1091
01:16:21,005 --> 01:16:21,989
Yes.

1092
01:16:30,106 --> 01:16:31,731
Papa! Papa, look!

1093
01:16:32,025 --> 01:16:33,008
Up there!

1094
01:16:34,973 --> 01:16:35,989
The sun!

1095
01:16:51,599 --> 01:16:53,290
Go on, Despereaux.

1096
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:05,813
Wait! Wait just a moment! Patience!

1097
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:11,964
Not just yet.

1098
01:17:18,602 --> 01:17:23,624
The honor is all yours, my friend.

1099
01:17:27,348 --> 01:17:30,132
Eat! Eat! Eat!

1100
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,727
Eat! Eat! Eat!

1101
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:41,407
<i>Okay, remember</i>
<i>when we said that grief</i>

1102
01:17:41,506 --> 01:17:43,998
<i>was the strongest thing
a person could feel?</i>

1103
01:17:44,102 --> 01:17:45,531
<i>Well, it isn't.</i>

1104
01:17:46,344 --> 01:17:47,775
<i>It's forgiveness.</i>

1105
01:17:48,298 --> 01:17:52,098
<i>Because a single act of
forgiveness can change everything.</i>

1106
01:17:53,295 --> 01:17:54,311
No.

1107
01:17:54,735 --> 01:17:55,751
What?

1108
01:17:55,825 --> 01:17:56,808
No.

1109
01:17:57,299 --> 01:17:59,342
You worthless little...

1110
01:17:59,543 --> 01:18:01,878
Eat! Eat! Eat!

1111
01:18:22,668 --> 01:18:23,653
Help!

1112
01:18:37,404 --> 01:18:39,164
Who let him out?

1113
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,037
Hey, you!

1114
01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:48,223
It's that mouse!

1115
01:18:53,741 --> 01:18:54,725
Get him!

1116
01:19:37,467 --> 01:19:41,781
Ah, if it isn't our brave little knight.

1117
01:19:43,139 --> 01:19:45,049
- I wonder.
- No!

1118
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,941
Should I finish you off myself

1119
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:51,239
or turn you into cat food?

1120
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:03,603
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1121
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:10,069
What is that?

1122
01:20:42,047 --> 01:20:44,669
Please. Nice kitty?

1123
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:47,682
No, no, no, no!

1124
01:20:57,742 --> 01:20:58,758
Hmm?

1125
01:21:32,853 --> 01:21:35,243
Thank you, my good gentleman.

1126
01:21:46,498 --> 01:21:48,062
I am sorry.

1127
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,256
I'm the one who should be sorry.

1128
01:21:56,237 --> 01:22:00,846
I'm so, so sorry.
You've no idea how sorry I am.

1129
01:22:01,842 --> 01:22:03,154
That's all right.

1130
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:11,187
I'm so sorry.

1131
01:22:17,827 --> 01:22:19,804
<i>So, you could call all of this</i>

1132
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:22,246
<i>a big misunderstanding
if you wanted to.</i>

1133
01:22:22,344 --> 01:22:25,513
<i>A king was hurt, so he hurt a rat.</i>

1134
01:22:25,581 --> 01:22:28,301
<i>And a rat was hurt,
so he hurt a princess.</i>

1135
01:22:29,297 --> 01:22:32,299
<i>And a princess was hurt,</i>
<i>so she hurt a servant girl,</i>

1136
01:22:32,404 --> 01:22:34,795
<i>without even meaning to do it.</i>

1137
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:37,687
<i>And that servant had been</i>
<i>hurting for so long,</i>

1138
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:40,723
<i>that almost nothing</i>
<i>could make her feel better.</i>

1139
01:22:41,885 --> 01:22:46,397
<i>But was it a mistake</i>
<i>or was it just good luck?</i>

1140
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:49,406
<i>Because the servant girl</i>
<i>went back to her farm.</i>

1141
01:22:49,477 --> 01:22:51,935
<i>And the jailer finally
found his princess.</i>

1142
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:55,010
<i>And the King found something</i>
<i>stronger than grief.</i>

1143
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:57,607
<i>And the mice finally
got rid of their fear.</i>

1144
01:23:00,144 --> 01:23:03,790
<i>And the people of Dor</i>
<i>lived side by side with their rats.</i>

1145
01:23:04,756 --> 01:23:06,035
<i>All except one.</i>

1146
01:23:06,104 --> 01:23:07,632
<i>Who went back to sea</i>

1147
01:23:07,705 --> 01:23:09,910
<i>and felt a cool
breeze each morning</i>

1148
01:23:09,978 --> 01:23:13,016
<i>and the sun in his
face every afternoon.</i>

1149
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,247
<i>And we'd tell you that they all
lived happily ever after, but...</i>

1150
01:23:17,315 --> 01:23:18,299
Whoa!

1151
01:23:18,948 --> 01:23:20,194
<i>what fun is that?</i>

1152
01:23:20,325 --> 01:23:21,309
Whoa!

1153
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:34,047
THE END
