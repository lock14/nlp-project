2
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,452
My name is Andre. Andre Moussa.

3
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:49,204
28 years old. Single. U.S. citizen.

4
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:53,369
Paris is a wonderful city, although I
don't really have the time to enjoy it.
Too much work...

5
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:57,330
I also do business in Argentina,
Chile... a bit in China.

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:01,494
Almost nothing in the U.S., actually.
Just my penthouse in N.Y.C.,
right above Central Park.

7
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:05,659
Let's focus on Paris...
I've made many friends here.

8
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:09,827
I used to think the French would
be angry about the Iraq war,
and this silly disagreement between our countries.

9
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,664
But it's not the case.

10
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:16,282
Maybe it's thanks to my behaviour.
I'm nice, generous...

11
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,575
I'm not too bad in bed.
Things are going well for me.

12
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:24,744
I think I can tell sincerely
that I am a nice guy.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,910
Here you go. That's all
I can tell you about me.
Who I would like to be... would dream to be.

14
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:32,946
Because I'm lying.

15
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,083
To myself.

16
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,363
To everyone.

17
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,160
All day.

18
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:45,245
You really are an American piece of crap.
Do you believe we're going
to believe that story?

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,368
I'm not American. I told you...
I won my green card at the lottery.

20
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,663
They do that every year.
I'm from Morocco.

21
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,954
I don't like Arabs either!

22
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,908
Stop punching, damnit!

23
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,034
It's a misunderstanding.
I didn't have the time to explain.

24
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,619
Okay. You have 10 seconds.

25
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:13,833
Here you go.

26
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,374
If it wasn't for that, I would
have repaid you a long time ago.

27
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,746
And you don't have a credit card?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,571
If I had a card, I would have gotten cash anywhere.
There's one of those banks
with the squirrel, right here.

29
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:21,542
Shut up!

30
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,409
Shut your mouth! When you open
it, it pisses me off even more.

31
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,076
No, you haven't understood.

32
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,533
Don't even say 'okay'.
Shut your mouth 100%.

33
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,125
You understand '100%'?

34
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,786
Don't say a single word.
Breathe. That's all.

35
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,914
Here you go. Good.

36
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:45,369
That must be tough.

37
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,663
For a fucking American like you...
Shutting up.

38
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,829
You who always want to
teach lessons to the world.

39
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:56,827
No comment. Just shut up.
And quietly listen to
what I have to say.

40
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,665
Mamou... Do you remember
Monsieur Mamou?

41
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,289
You owe money to Monsieur Mamou.

42
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:12,452
40,000 Euros!
Not shitty Dollars... Euros!

43
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,785
And if you haven't
returned them by tonight.
I will find you, and break your fingers.

44
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:20,407
And if it's not enough,
I'll break your arms.

45
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,708
And your legs.

46
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,035
And your head.

47
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,750
I know that song... I like it.

48
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,660
You have until tonight.
And tonight ends at midnight.

49
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:34,531
After that, it's tomorrow.
And tomorrow, you'll be dead!

50
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,159
See you later.

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,870
Suddenly, two things had
become very clear to me.

52
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:52,035
I really had to do something.
And I definitely hated Paris.

53
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,285
Monsieur Frank!

54
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,951
Please... Monsieur Frank.

55
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,248
I don't really understand, Andre.

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,410
I welcome you in my home, as a
friend. Introduce you to people.
Lend you money when you're in need.

57
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,792
And what do I get in return?

58
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,833
I can explain!

59
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,744
Not a word. Not a phonecall.
And now you make me climb the
fucking Eiffel tower to find you...

60
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,410
Do you really think I have
the time to be a tourist?

61
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:30,577
No, of course you're not
a tourist, Monsieur Frank.
I can explain... please!

62
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,542
Go ahead, I'm listening.

63
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:36,540
Can you ask this gentleman to
bring me back on the ground?
It would me more convenient...

64
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,498
I hear you just fine from here.
Hurry up, I'm running late.

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,530
I've lost my identification, my
passport and all my credit cards.
I went to the American Express offices.

66
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:43,833
Let go of him.

67
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,871
No, Frank! Please!
Don't let go!

68
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,071
Monsieur Frank!
Please!

69
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,250
Something to add?

70
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,075
Tonight.
I'm paying tonight.

71
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,743
On my mother's head!
I'm paying tonight.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,279
Why should I care?
I don't know your mother.

73
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,702
I'm paying everything tonight.
On the whoever's head you want.

74
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,364
And how do you intend to do that?
You're broke, and indebted
to everybody in Paris.

75
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,952
I don't know. I don't know.

76
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,948
But I'm having a hard time thinking
I'm my current position.

77
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,874
You're aware that I have
men in every train station?

78
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,404
I know, Monsieur Frank.

79
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,083
So, don't try to run.

80
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,868
No.
That would be a very bad idea.

81
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,577
I give you until midnight.

82
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,577
Thank you, Monsieur Frank.

83
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,700
You have no idea how glad
I am to see you, Monsieur.

84
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,198
Good morning, sir.
Can I see your papers, please?

85
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,698
No, but don't worry, I'm American.

86
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,666
Did you block your credit cards?

87
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,121
Yes. All of them.
And now I can't get cash anymore.

88
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,661
It makes things rather difficult.
Life is so expensive in Paris...

89
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:15,958
I know...

90
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,364
But American Express can make
you a new card in 24 hours,
can't they?

91
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,160
Yes, but for that I need
to prove my identity.

92
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,573
And since I don't have
my papers anymore,
I can't prove my identity.

93
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,160
Ah, yes...
It's a vicious circle.

94
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:28,996
On top of that, it's Saturday.
All my friends have either gone
to the country or on holidays.

95
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,992
Baldwin alley, it's in Manhattan?

96
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,739
No. Brooklyn.
Number 720.5th floor.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,042
You want the phone number?

98
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,783
No, it's okay.
I have it already.

99
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,666
Really?
You have this kind of
data in the computer?

100
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,583
Yes. I also have your
three condemnations.

101
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,446
Really?

102
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,616
Then it must have told you
that it's ancient history.
I was young...

103
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,458
The last one was three months ago.

104
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,291
Ah...
You have this one too?

105
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,113
That computer is powerful.

106
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,622
Did it tell you it was
a misunderstanding?

107
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,916
In the report, they call it a con job.

108
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,576
And you almost got
three months for it.

109
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,243
Yes. It's true.

110
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,325
And I intend to appeal when I return.

111
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,953
Monsieur Moussa, there is
not much we can do for you.

112
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:16,119
I suggest you go to the nearest police
station. And declare the theft.
They will give you temporary papers.

113
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,374
Listen, sir...

114
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,500
I am an American citizen.

115
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,410
I have rights. Written in a constitution.
For which my great-grandparents
have fought their entire lives.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,998
I think I deserve my country's support.
Especially in such a
desperate situation.

117
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,659
Monsieur Moussa, your
grandparents lived in Algery.

118
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:37,540
So, maybe they fought
for independance...

119
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,119
But certainly not the
U.S. independance.

120
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,160
Keep in mind that the green
card you won at the lottery
requires that you obey some rules.

121
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,699
Rules written at the
back of the document
that you obviously did not bother reading.

122
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,869
It is clearly written that the American administration
can cancel your visa in case
of severe or repeated offense.

123
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:56,081
And in your case, you ostensibly
combine both criteria.

124
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,000
Now, let me give you a more
personal piece of advice.

125
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,580
I think that the only
person that can do anything
for you is... yourself.

126
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,744
Please exit the building quietly.
Or I am going to call the
marines in charge of security.

127
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,624
Hey, Andre!
Andre!

128
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,540
You've got my money, Andre?

129
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,327
Hey, Andre, come here!
You fucker!

130
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,167
Hi!

131
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,790
What are you here for?

132
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:45,657
Well, err...
I was thinking that... err...

133
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,915
I was intending to...

134
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,702
I can't take it anymore.

135
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,949
I'm at the end of the rope.

136
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,452
What's wrong, little fellow?

137
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,578
I fucked up.
I have borrowed lots of money.

138
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,369
And my calculations
were slightly wrong.

139
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,791
Now I can't return
anything to these guys.

140
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,867
And if I don't do it
they're going to shoot me.

141
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,292
And you want to report them?

142
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:24,452
Nah... reporting them...
If I do that they're going
to shoot me even more.

143
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,157
What can I do for you, then?

144
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,494
I was thinking that... you...

145
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,533
Maybe you could put me in
jail for a few days...
Until I figure things out.

146
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,538
That's a joke for TV? Is that it?

147
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,954
No, it's not for TV.

148
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,119
Can't you see I'm about to crack?
And you tell me about TV jokes!

149
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,250
I'm asking you to throw me in jail!

150
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,620
An Arab without any ID papers.
That shouldn't be a problem!

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,279
What 'uh... '?

152
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,455
You bastards!

153
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,700
Cowards!

154
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:14,744
What kind of police is that?

155
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,248
You only start reacting now, uh?

156
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,994
Well... it's too late!

157
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,363
I'm going to kill myself!

158
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,415
And it's your fault.

159
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,829
Nobody cares about me, is that it?

160
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,113
I'm going to do it.

161
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,702
Is that what you want?

162
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,123
Why are you giving up on me?

163
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,409
Why don't you ever
answer my questions?

164
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,077
What are you doing here?

165
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,285
Well... the same as you.

166
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,497
Meaning?

167
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,744
Don't worry!

168
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,374
I'm coming.
I'm here.

169
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,283
Don't worry.
I'm here.

170
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,494
What the hell was that all about?

171
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,496
I can't even kill myself in peace.
Even there, someone has to annoy me.

172
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,790
Don't I deserve a minute alone?
So that I can leave with dignity?

173
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,914
You... what did you come here for?
It's Sunday morning!

174
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,576
Couldn't you stay in
bed, like everybody?

175
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,917
I couldn't sleep.

176
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:48,117
Then you should have
chosen another bridge.
We have plenty of them in this fucking city!

177
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,366
Didn't you see that one was occupied?

178
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,746
We had the same idea.
Isn't that funny?

179
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,535
Funny, yeah...
Hysterical.

180
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,199
Can you tell me why
you want to jump off
that bridge so badly?

181
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,248
Probably because I have
the same problems as you.

182
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,542
I don't think so...

183
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,869
Why?

184
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,701
Because my problem is
that I feel stupid,
ugly, and totally useless.

185
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,949
And I don't think you have
this kind of problem.

186
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,491
It's exactly the same:
I'm stupid and ugly

187
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,077
...on the inside.

188
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,700
At least you can hide
it, with your looks.

189
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,830
I have nothing to hide.

190
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,244
I can see that, yeah...

191
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:27,492
Can you tell me, why a girl
like you can feel so bad?

192
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:28,583
You're young.
You're beautiful.

193
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,494
The world could be at your feet.
You could ask for anything.

194
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,207
So? What do I want?

195
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,283
I don't know.
I'm not a psychic.

196
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,079
To be rich, I guess.
Like everybody.

197
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,282
To spend your money around the world.
To be attractive...

198
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,663
To buy dresses, furs...

199
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,493
That's what makes women happy,
if I understand correctly.

200
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,622
And you?
What would make you happy?

201
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,577
To be left alone, at peace...
To breathe. Here's what I need.

202
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,500
I need time to figure things out.
Can't you see what I look like?

203
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,748
What matters is on the inside,
no on the outside.

204
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,538
Easy for you...
Don't you see how good you look?

205
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:04,576
Women think they're
the ones to talk...
Who would be dead if it wasn't for me?

206
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,535
And who would be dead if he didn't
have someone to save?

207
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,782
Don't you have a smoke?

208
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,829
Listen... I'm not in the mood
for psychological games.
Especially on a Sunday morning.

209
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,698
Yeah, you're right.
What are we doing now?

210
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,458
Why 'what are we doing'?

211
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,575
You saved my life.
I suppose you intend to
do something with it.

212
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,578
No. I didn't think.
I jumped by chance.

213
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,789
People should not be left to die.
It's not good.

214
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:38,495
I agree.
So... what do we do now?

215
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,871
Nothing! Just leave me alone.

216
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,495
Damn, men...
You really are all the same.

217
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,499
You act without thinking,
and then you throw us away.

218
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,950
That's enough.
I'm not in the mood
for an argument either.

219
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,915
Bye.

220
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,618
What's your first name?

221
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,034
Angela.

222
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,910
Listen, Angela.
If I leave you like that,
will you try it again?

223
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:13,875
Try what?

224
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,154
Jumping off bridges, obviously!

225
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,744
It's likely...

226
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,250
Can't you try changing your mind?

227
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,577
Why?

228
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,499
What kind if question is that?

229
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,781
Because you...

230
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,321
Because you're beautiful.

231
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,828
And losing a pretty girl like you
would be a waste.

232
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,123
And also because I never did
anything good in my life.

233
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,165
So, knowing that I saved someone,
at least once...

234
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,696
That could help me.

235
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,949
If you could do that for me,
I would appreciate it.

236
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,571
I'll see what I can do.

237
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,958
Thank you.

238
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,238
Don't mention it...

239
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,404
Bye.

240
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,539
Good bye...

241
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,244
Why don't you dedicate
your life to a cause?

242
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,542
What cause?

243
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:03,824
I don't know... Orphans in India?
Kids with aids in Africa?

244
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,457
Why go so far?

245
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,746
You're right.

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,872
Poverty is everywhere.

247
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,578
Why not help people in need,
here in Paris?

248
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,160
People you could be a relief to.

249
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,500
People like you?

250
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,786
Yes.
Uh... no!

251
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:20,083
I'm fine.

252
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,458
Yeah...
You are SO fine.

253
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,705
You merely tried jumping off a bridge.
Five minutes ago.

254
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,496
If I gave you my life
would you know what to do with it?

255
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,953
Give a carrot to a donkey,
you'll see if he knows
what to do with it.

256
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:44,119
Of course.
Of course I'd know what to do with it.

257
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,410
Okay. Agreed.
I am yours.

258
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,208
You gotta be kidding!

259
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,614
Not at all.
What you said makes a lot of sense.

260
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,826
You're right:
you are a good cause.

261
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,406
I am yours.

262
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,000
You're making fun of me.

263
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,864
Not at all.
Can we start by buying some smokes?

264
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,407
You mean you're going
to stay next to me?

265
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:14,281
Yeah. I will do whatever you ask.
Without arguing.

266
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,493
You really are making fun of me.

267
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,741
No.
Try me.

268
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,279
Kiss me.

269
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:31,958
Again?

270
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,573
No, that's good enough.
I believe you.

271
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,156
So, are we going to get smokes?

272
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,123
First, we need to dry ourselves.

273
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,702
Cool!

274
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,620
All done.
Now, give me your panties.

275
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,534
Come one... don't be shy.
I have just dried mine.

276
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,699
I can tell you, it feels better now.
Much warmer.

277
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,079
I just told you: I'm fine.

278
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,613
Okay.

279
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,122
You know... it's the
ladie's room here.

280
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,417
Yeah?

281
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,822
Yes, so can you tell this man
to go wash somewhere else?

282
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,125
Who?

283
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,495
Here! The man in that stall.
To whom you have handed
a pair or pants.

284
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,660
Don't judge a book by
its cover: it's a woman.

285
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,159
Yeah? With that kind of voice?

286
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:36,327
It's a women on the inside.
The outside doesn't matter.

287
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,458
What's going on?

288
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,366
Nothing, just chatting between women.

289
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,616
So? What are we doing now?

290
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,620
Now, back to the business!

291
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,866
Good!
Can we get some food on the way?

292
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,080
I could die for some breakfast.

293
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,616
Avoid mentioning 'dying'.
Lately, I...

294
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,708
Okay.

295
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,415
Thank you.

296
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,322
I'm sorry... Can you
move away from me?
I'm not used to that.

297
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,417
Okay.

298
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,573
And can you stop replying 'okay',
whenever I ask you something?

299
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,113
Okay.

300
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,619
You want a half?

301
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,167
No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

302
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:32,034
Eat. You need strength,
if you want to leave.

303
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,329
Look, this one is going to the South!

304
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,206
I love the South!

305
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,785
Me too.

306
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:40,032
Really. At one point I was
dreaming of living over there.
But I...

307
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,571
Why didn't you move?

308
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,625
Someday, maybe.

309
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,952
Why not today?

310
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,000
No. Today is not a good idea.

311
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,784
It is! Let's take the train right now.
And go to the beach.

312
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,321
Together.

313
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,417
You know that song?

314
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:58,458
Entirely.

315
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,500
So? Are we going?

316
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,208
Where?

317
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,292
To the South!

318
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:05,202
But... we can't go to the South
simply because you want to.

319
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,446
Anyway, I have some
issues to take care of.

320
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,781
Issues?
Can I help you?

321
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,833
Yeah... maybe.

322
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,705
Awesome! What should I do?

323
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,282
Nothing.
Just stay next to me.

324
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:19,583
That will be enough?

325
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,498
Yeah.
That way they're going
to believe that...

326
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,449
That we...
That we're together.

327
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,035
And that's going to impress them.

328
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,747
They are going to start respecting me.
See what I mean?

329
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,042
Not at all.

330
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,369
That's normal.

331
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,073
First, Monsieur Frank, I
thank you for seeing us.
I know you have better things to do...

332
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,042
Cut the crap!

333
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,083
Right.

334
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,750
Listen. I know I owe you money.

335
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,667
For you, it's not much.
But for me, it's an
extraordinary amount.

336
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:50,666
I am waiting for some
cash sometime soon,
from my Argentina businesses, but...

337
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:51,958
What kind of businesses?

338
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,996
Uh... olive oil.

339
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,500
Olive oil?

340
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,455
It's winter over there.
No olive oil before five months.

341
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,988
That's what you call 'sometime soon'?

342
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,620
True.
But I'm relying on stocks
from... this month.

343
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,533
But everything was stolen.

344
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,743
People are starving
so badly, over there.

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,453
On the other hand,
stealing olive oil...
it's ridiculous.

346
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,458
Who's that girl?

347
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,785
Who?

348
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,000
Her?

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,784
She's my associate.
Speaking of which, Frankie,
I got to tell you...

350
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:23,750
Frankie?

351
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,375
Sorry.

352
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,654
Watch it...

353
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,039
I was thinking: you
can't pay Frank back.
No need to hide it. You can't...

354
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:33,202
At least, offer him a share of the pie.
I swear, Frank. It's
a golden opportunity.

355
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,875
Whatever you're offering,
I'm not interested.

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,327
Why?
We used to have good deals.

357
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,290
You're a loser, Andre.
Whatever you try, fails.

358
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,291
The few times when you made money
that was just luck.

359
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,746
It's a wonder you managed
to stay in one piece.

360
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,327
Look at yourself.

361
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,040
You look like a bum.
You stink.

362
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,661
People wouldn't even give you a penny.

363
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,452
I'm sorry, Frank.
I didn't have the time to shave.

364
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,457
Yesterday, I spent my time
struggling to find a solution.

365
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,035
I swear, when you hit rock bottom...

366
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,583
Cut the theatrics, Andre!

367
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,823
It's your fault, if
you're in that situation.

368
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:13,286
Well, then. I'm giving
you six more hours
to find my 30 grands.

369
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,698
If you fail, I'm sending
two Yugos on your ass.
Is that clear?

370
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,581
Two Yugos?

371
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,577
Or two Bosnians, if you want.

372
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,823
I only have one condition...

373
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,491
Don't you have a little job?
Even a shitty one. I can take it...

374
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,073
I think I know what he wants.

375
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,785
Got a second, Monsieur Frank?

376
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,913
You were supposed to shut
up during this meeting.
Are you trying to screw things up, or what?

377
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:49,367
As if you needed me to screw up.
You're negotiating like a white chick.

378
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,904
Like a white chick?

379
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,202
Why don't you give him what he wants?
Don't beat around the bush.

380
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,500
Around the bush?

381
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,542
Uh uh.

382
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:59,623
Listen, Angela. You shut up for a minute.
Let me sort this business
out. I'm back in a sec.

383
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,917
What a 'business'...

384
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,038
Damn... shut up!
You shut up.

385
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,446
We were saying?

386
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:13,446
Monsieur Frank!

387
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,113
Monsieur Frank!

388
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,416
Why don't you let
your girlfriend talk?
She seems smarter than you.

389
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,243
Well, then... no problem.

390
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,498
If you want to chat with her.
Since we're associates...

391
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,029
If you're talking to me,
it's as if you were talking to her.

392
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,785
There's no...
Angela, will you please
discuss with my friend?

393
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:35,198
Where do you want to do it?

394
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,163
I've got a small
lounge, right upstairs.
We won't be disturbed.

395
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:39,696
Fine.

396
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,371
You're unbelievable, you...

397
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,744
Angela! Angela...
That guy is a killer. He's
gonna mess with your head.

398
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,825
Shhhh...
Let me handle this.

399
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,868
I'm going to make him
an offer he can't refuse.

400
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,035
Be nice.

401
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:20,958
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for an hour!

402
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,411
It didn't take an hour. I
stayed for five minutes.
It all went very well.

403
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,618
You don't realize, poor girl.
That guy is a killer!

404
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,700
He could as well have killed you.

405
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:32,786
I guess I got lucky, then.
Here... It's for you.

406
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,083
What is that?

407
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,706
Paper.
With pictures on it.

408
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:37,451
It is called 'money'.

409
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:40,458
And my debts?

410
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,409
You don't owe him anything anymore.
He wiped your slate clean.

411
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,741
You're white as snow, now.
You can breathe.

412
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,702
And take the time you need
to feel better again.

413
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,079
Angela. What have you done?
Did you sell your mother, or what?

414
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,000
Of course not.

415
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,279
Wait. Tell me.

416
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,786
Ah. Why do you care?
You had a problem...

417
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,369
and it's solved.
Now, look ahead of you.

418
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,663
Move forwards, now.

419
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:03,282
Wait. I'm not moving anywhere.
I don't want any dirty money.

420
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,583
What do you mean by 'dirty money'?

421
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,250
If you did nasty stuff...
then I don't want it.

422
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,410
When you take money from an ATM
do you wonder where it comes from?

423
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,829
It's coming from the machine.
And I'm fine with that.

424
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,991
Well... today I am the ATM.

425
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,532
BEEP Take your money.
And stop bitching about it.

426
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,998
Actually, it helps me a lot.

427
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,279
How much is there?

428
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,449
Enough to repay the Spaniard.

429
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,492
That's so great!

430
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,367
How do you know I owe
money to the Spaniard?

431
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,204
Everybody knows about your debts,
my poor Andre...

432
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:39,500
I don't want it anymore!

433
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,542
Why don't you?

434
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,995
Because I'm convinced you've done
nasty things with Frank.

435
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,743
I'm not a pimp.
You hear me?

436
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,833
Nonsense!

437
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,741
Yes, sense!
Give me that...

438
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,204
Wait... Do you think I didn't see you
dancing in front of him?

439
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,500
Dancing, me?

440
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,123
You kept showing him your panties.
I saw it!

441
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,417
You have eyes behind your back?

442
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:58,284
I noticed he wasn't focused on
what I was saying.

443
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:01,077
What you were saying
wasn't really interesting...

444
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,660
I was talking business, okay?

445
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:05,706
Business has its code,
its own language.
It's mostly body language.

446
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,577
You got to look weak one moment,
so as to catch your prey unaware!

447
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,374
But you're not fishing trout, Andre.

448
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,576
You're dealing with a crook.
Behaving like a grade
school student...

449
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,120
At least I have some pride left.
A few principles.

450
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,417
Probably too much for you.

451
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,656
Then why didn't use your principles?

452
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:21,409
Frank was like a marshmallow, today.

453
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,539
You could have asked
for 10 grands. Easy...

454
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,119
Never.

455
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:26,708
I considered it.

456
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:30,039
You know... brains are large.
You can use more than this tiny piece.

457
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,780
You are so wrong, poor girl.
I'm using all of it. All!

458
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,949
I think all the time.

459
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:37,080
Right now, I'm thinking
you should leave me alone.

460
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,205
But you're thinking small.
Paying small debts.

461
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,828
Buying a small plane ticket.
To quickly go to New York...

462
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,157
So as to sell your Brooklyn apartment.

463
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,582
How come you know about
my Brooklyn penthouse?

464
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,492
You call this hole a penthouse?

465
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,036
It was cheap when I bought it,
but since then the price
must have increased...

466
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:56,282
Who cares about your
Brooklyn apartment?

467
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:59,872
It's not the problem. Your problem is
that all you want is to run away.

468
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,116
All the time...
Instead of taking a break.

469
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,661
Instead of breathing.

470
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,782
Letting oxygen climb up to your brain.
Making it happy.

471
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:11,530
So that it helps you take
the right decisions.

472
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,031
Now, breathe!

473
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,077
Breathe...

474
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:17,910
Breathe!

475
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,450
Good... Look.
Come here.

476
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,167
Lift up your head.

477
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,446
Breathe.

478
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,250
Breathe.

479
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,292
There... look.

480
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,333
Breathe!

481
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,450
Look.
There...

482
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,613
The clouds...

483
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,327
The birds...

484
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,450
The city...

485
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,499
All around us.

486
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,071
Breathe.

487
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:52,704
Is it not the most beautiful
city in the world?

488
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:57,206
So, how should I have handled Frank?

489
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,738
By telling him the truth.
That's all.

490
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,664
What truth?

491
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,870
The only one you don't want to hear.

492
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,490
The money I owe you is dirty.
Coming mostly from sex and drugs.

493
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,499
I'll never return it
because I don't want to
be part of that shit.

494
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,660
Anyway, I'll never see your ugly face again.
I won't lose any more
time with scum like you.

495
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,529
Bravo, Andre!

496
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,119
You really think I
should have said that?

497
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,702
Isn't that what you were thinking?

498
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,658
We can't always say
what we think, Angela.

499
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:29,623
Why not?
Maybe life would be better that way.

500
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,115
And we'd have the time to enjoy Paris.

501
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,413
Oh!
Do you think we can
ride the tourist boats?

502
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:36,539
It's not the right time to ride
the damned tourist boats...

503
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,581
Ah?
And when is the right time?

504
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,207
When you are free from stress.

505
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,532
Right now, I'm not free
from any stress at all.

506
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:44,617
Come on, it's only five minutes.

507
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,202
Stop that!

508
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,000
I can't swim, anyway...

509
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,623
Liar.
You jumped off the bridge to save me.

510
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,125
It was different. I was not thinking.

511
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,950
Now that I'm thinking,
I remember I can't swim.

512
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,033
Come on... please.
To make me happy...

513
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,033
No, no, no!
Do not insist.

514
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:58,998
When I say no, I mean it.

515
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,577
I've always dreamt of
riding a tourist boat,
like that, on the Seine.

516
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,702
It's so romantic!

517
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,285
I'm feeling sick...

518
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,869
I'm happy, Andre.

519
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,706
Right here, right now.

520
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,368
At this precise instant...

521
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,248
you're saving my life.

522
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,542
Making my dreams come true.

523
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,579
See?
You can do good things.

524
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,113
Yes, but it only works on you.

525
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,615
We should come back at night too.
It's so pretty at night.

526
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,250
No. This time, we won't.

527
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,288
The boats are lit up
with these spotlights.

528
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:29,583
And when you see them from above...

529
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,325
watching them winding
upriver is so pretty.

530
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,704
They look like small balls of light,
gliding over the water.

531
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,208
What do you mean, 'from above'?

532
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,365
Above! From the sky.

533
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,239
Come on.
Relax a little.

534
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,957
You're so tense...

535
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,784
It gives you all these small wrinkles.

536
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:51,079
Here.
You look like a turtle.

537
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,874
It's easy for you.
You never had trouble with money...

538
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,666
No, I never had any.

539
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,250
Any what?

540
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,292
Trouble or money?

541
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:58,571
Both.

542
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,659
Good for you, really...
But I still have a problem with both.

543
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:05,405
But you have money, now.
You can pay what you owe.

544
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,534
You seem to be misinformed.
I owe much more than
that to the Spaniard.

545
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:10,996
No big deal.
Let's go get more dough.

546
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,040
...get more dough...

547
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,454
You think it's easy,
getting more dough?

548
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,289
I made 20,000 Euros in five minutes.

549
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:19,583
It's not the same.
Not at all.

550
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,332
Yes it is!
How much do you need to be happy?

551
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:24,375
What are you talking about?

552
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,868
Your debt...
How much is it?

553
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:28,083
Total?

554
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,083
Yes.
Not broken down.

555
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,370
I have no idea.
I swear... I don't know.

556
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,201
Thirty...
Thirty five...

557
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,330
With interest that
must be around 50,000.

558
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:38,958
I'm so screwed.

559
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:40,996
50 is no big deal.

560
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,529
Come on, let's go.

561
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:43,750
Where?

562
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,540
Where there is music.

563
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,000
What for?

564
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,038
Because I like music when I'm working.

565
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,333
How're you doing?

566
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,167
Fine.

567
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:04,241
Say... would you like to
screw in the bathroom?

568
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,280
Wow, you're quite a straight chick...
Can I know your name, first?

569
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,781
You won't need it.
So?

570
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:12,083
Okay.

571
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,742
How much are you willing to pay?

572
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,201
Ah... I see.
Why should I pay?

573
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,947
What you don't pay
has no value.

574
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,535
It's kind of true...

575
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,034
So? How much?

576
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,031
1,000!
And you get the full monty.

577
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,666
Okay. Deal.

578
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,367
Here you go: 1,000.

579
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:48,904
What's that?

580
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:52,042
The girl... the tall blonde.
She told me to give it to you.

581
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,654
Angela?

582
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,458
Angela?

583
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,785
What?

584
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,000
What're you doing?

585
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,279
Guess...

586
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,619
Angela, you can't be doing this.
I don't want...

587
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,498
I don't want you to do this for me!

588
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,290
I thought you needed money...

589
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,497
Yes... Yes, I need it.
But...

590
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,997
Listen, I still have
some morality left.
I don't want you to be doing this for me.

591
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,952
No way...
I thank you very much for it.

592
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,365
I appreciate the gesture.
But no. Really.

593
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:55,917
No way you're doing this at all.

594
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,540
Come on. It's all right.
It's nothing.

595
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,747
Yes it's something!
What are you talking about?

596
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,042
Of course it's something!

597
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:03,328
Listen, Angela.
Stop immediately, and
come out right now!

598
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,119
Listen... let's say I'm
doing it for myself.
Okay?

599
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,539
I simply need you to keep the money,
to prevent me from spending it all.

600
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,161
Listen...
I'm not feeling well, Angela...

601
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,826
Please come out, and let's go away.

602
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,536
Now, she's asking you
to keep her dough.
So keep it and give us a break!

603
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,071
So that I can finish. Fuck!

604
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,081
Angela... really.
I feel terrible,
leaving you like that.

605
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:29,244
Andre... go to the bar.
I don't want to spend
the night here, okay?

606
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,417
I'm off to the bar, now.

607
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:39,696
Go!

608
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,160
Thank you, sir.

609
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,363
Hey! That one was...

610
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,115
I got 500. Is that okay?

611
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,654
It's finished, it's over.

612
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,871
Come on, don't be cheap.
Only five minutes!

613
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,696
I just told you it's over!

614
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,029
Isn't that your third time?

615
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,167
Ah, no... uh!
Not at all!

616
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:22,208
Not a single time.

617
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,618
I've spent three hours
waiting for my turn.

618
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:24,917
Come on, be nice!

619
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,156
Here, have 1,000.

620
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:30,790
I don't give a fuck about your dough.
I just told you the girl is tired.

621
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:32,949
Tired... tired...
Everybody went on top of her.

622
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,164
One more is not going
to make any difference.

623
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:36,696
Yes it will!

624
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,574
It's one too many.
At last I understand.

625
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:40,875
Understand what?

626
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,533
I don't want her to be sullied!

627
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:45,197
Especially if it's to make me happy.

628
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,077
I'm not worth it.

629
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,532
I really don't want to have
anything to do with assholes like you.

630
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:56,288
Now get the fuck away,
or I'm going to get really mad.

631
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,282
See what I get for telling the truth?
You and your lousy advice...

632
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:03,200
You didn't have to be rude.

633
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,698
And the stuff about his mother
was uncalled for.

634
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,332
It came naturally...

635
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,373
Good.
There's some improvement.

636
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,118
You spoke your heart out.

637
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,745
If I get my ass kicked
whenever I speak my mind,
I'll be dead before tomorrow morning.

638
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,991
You're always complaining.
Did you notice that?

639
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,956
Did you see the evening
you had me go through, Angela?

640
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,697
Standing at the bar, playing the pimp.
I'm ashamed.

641
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,581
Would you rather have
been in my shoes?

642
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,167
No.

643
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,446
Then shut up.

644
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:32,535
Anyway. I thought having your money
would make you feel better.

645
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,327
It's in your pocket now.

646
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:35,874
What are you waiting
for, before you smile?

647
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,582
I need to pay my debt first.

648
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,623
I'll smile afterwards.

649
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,619
Open!

650
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,331
What're you looking at, bitch?
Open!

651
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,956
Okay. You stay next to me.
Just in case...

652
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,199
In case I have to pull you out
of a tricky negotiation?

653
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:01,916
Why do you keep humiliating me?

654
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,208
You don't need me for that...

655
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,998
See? You're doing it again!
Stop treating me like that.

656
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,624
I'm treating you
like you treat me.

657
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:07,917
I should have let you drown.

658
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:08,667
What?

659
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,041
Nothing!

660
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,363
No, no, no!

661
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,166
Don't start dancing again!
I've had enough shame.

662
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,583
It's over.
No more dancing.

663
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:28,875
Okay.

664
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,125
Don't do it again.

665
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:30,542
Okay.

666
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,034
I'm a big shot, here.

667
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:33,619
Okay.

668
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,699
How many times do I have to tell you?
Wash your hands before touching it.

669
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,447
It's worth a fortune.
One month...

670
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,750
Pedro!

671
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,369
...and it's already filthy.
You want to ruin me, that's it?

672
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:58,535
Pedro!
Ho! Que pasa, Pedro?

673
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:05,577
Ho, Pedro!
Como esta?

674
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,748
Quite ballsy, coming to
my club like that...
Have you forgotten?

675
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,784
No. I had to take a trip to Argentina.
And my cellphone
doesn't work over there.

676
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,083
What were you doing over there?

677
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,125
I have a small business.
Didn't I tell you?

678
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:15,708
No.

679
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:16,500
Well, I'm telling you.

680
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,786
Good.
That way you can pay me back.

681
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,032
That's why I came back.

682
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,000
Wait... really?

683
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,279
Yup!

684
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,623
This is amazing.

685
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,167
You want a drink?

686
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,494
Well... it'd be a pleasure.

687
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:29,667
What will you have?

688
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,243
A quick vodka-tonic.
It's going to...

689
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,827
What about your girlfriend?

690
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,534
Should I answer, or bark?

691
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,125
Answer, that's all.

692
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,167
The same thing, please.

693
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,702
Diego, please!
Two vodka-tonic for my friends.

694
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,534
Say... your girlfriend...
she's pretty.

695
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:42,833
Yeah, I know.

696
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,286
We met... in Agentina.

697
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:48,078
Really?
She's rather blonde, for a Latina.

698
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:52,030
Yeah... It's from her mother.
She's from Sweden. That's why.

699
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,571
Really?

700
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,907
Should I answer in
Spanish, or Swedish?

701
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,992
Answer! Any...

702
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:16,375
Well!

703
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,698
Short reckonings
making long friends...
How much do I owe you?

704
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,869
17,000? With interest that makes
something like 20,000 Euros.

705
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,250
Agreed?

706
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,529
Agreed!

707
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:30,785
Andre, you know...
I'm removing all I
ever said about you.

708
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,333
And god knows I said a lot!

709
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,205
You were right anyway, Pedro.
I didn't behave properly.

710
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,999
I should have called
you as soon as I knew
I would be a little late.

711
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,454
Six months late?
That's not what I call 'a little'.

712
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:41,994
A little...

713
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:43,458
But it's true.
You should have called!

714
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:44,500
Yes.

715
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,250
Isn't it true?

716
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,250
Yes. Yes.

717
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,616
Because it's always good
to have a friend on the phone.

718
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:51,821
Really?

719
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,410
How sweet of you!

720
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,372
Moreover...
You seem in good shape!

721
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:57,904
I'm feeling better, yeah...

722
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,375
You seem more stable.

723
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,449
Yes, it's true...
Ouch! Careful, careful...

724
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,829
Initially I was not feeling good.
But now I'm better.

725
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:07,330
Good! I can tell you now...
You were on a slippery slope.

726
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,118
Yes, I know... I know.

727
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:12,575
I even know some guys who
got contracts for your head.

728
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,000
For real?

729
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,576
I haven't told you anything, right?

730
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,582
Anyway, there's no point in
getting contracts on my head.
I'd rather die than not paying my debts.

731
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:20,958
You're exaggerating, aren't you?

732
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,411
I swear it!
Yesterday morning, I...

733
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:25,571
I almost killed myself.

734
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:31,452
I... I went on a bridge.
I stepped over the railing.

735
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,165
And I...
I almost jumped.

736
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:38,124
Don't fool around with that, Andre...

737
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,615
You've got a girl, now.
She needs you, to build something...

738
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:41,958
Don't give up on her.

739
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,625
No, I won't give her up.
You can trust me.

740
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:48,785
Hey! Let me give you a tip,
to get you started again.

741
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:55,158
I've got a horse running
in Miami, in 20 minutes.
The name's Brutus.

742
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:56,458
His odds are 30 to 1.

743
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:59,207
I got a guy over there,
who added bromide in the
three favourite's grub.

744
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,832
They're gonna drag
themselves like donkeys.

745
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,619
My horse, on the other hand,
is loaded with amphetamines.

746
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:05,249
He's going to kick their asses.

747
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,290
But what if they block the winnings
and have a drug test?

748
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:08,821
They're all on my payroll...

749
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,864
Brutus, number 7 in the
third race. 30 to 1.
Can you smell the cash?

750
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:13,958
I can.

751
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,368
But be careful...
It's just for you, Andy boy.

752
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:16,375
No problem.

753
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,951
Don't you cause the odds to drop
right before it starts...

754
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,488
No no no! I swear, Pedro.
Trust me.

755
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:22,991
Well... Consider it my gift.
Now that you're back in business.

756
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,541
Thank you. Thank you, Pedro.
Really...

757
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:30,702
Brutus, number 7 in the third race.
Have a blast, Andy boy!

758
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:31,792
Thank you.

759
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:34,197
Diego!
All drinks from my friend Andre
and his partner are on me.

760
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,738
Senorita...

761
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,281
Did you see that? Wow! Like I said...
When you're next to
me, they are impressed.

762
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:41,951
Pepito gobbled it all!

763
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,791
Okay. What are we doing now?

764
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,456
Now, we're off to make
shitloads of cash!

765
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,826
Miami in the third race.
Everything on number 7. Brutus!

766
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,457
I have a feeling you're
going to lose my money.

767
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,829
Trust me.
I'm going to repay you three
times the price, honey.

768
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,957
Haha! Thanks!

769
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,286
Come. I'm going to show you.

770
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:18,208
Miami?

771
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:18,417
Yes.

772
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:19,744
Hehe!

773
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,241
Go, my horse!
Go! Go! Go! Yes!

774
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,325
He's first!
He's first! Hell yeah!

775
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,657
He was right...
He's first!

776
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:33,998
Go, my horse!
Yeah!

777
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,826
Yeah! He's first!
Do you realize?

778
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,493
The Spaniard was right!

779
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,741
Keep up with the race!
Keep it up! Yeah!

780
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,279
Yeah yeah yeah!
That's no big deal.

781
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,500
He's slowing down, it's normal.

782
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,542
He's breathing before returning...

783
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:44,821
Go, my horse, go!

784
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,078
What's going on?
It's an American technique.

785
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,822
He's breathing... breathing.
And then he's going to run for it!

786
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,363
He's gonna run for it.
Like lightning. I'm sure.

787
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:53,792
Give it all!
Come back!

788
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:55,533
Go for it!
Go!

789
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,917
Why is he slowing down?

790
00:43:57,917 --> 00:43:59,824
He's slowing down too much...

791
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,207
Why is he walking?

792
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,531
They... they told us number 7.

793
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:22,364
The Spaniard told me to
bet everything on number 7.

794
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,327
I bet everything on number 7.

795
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,579
Number 1 won.

796
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:32,625
I've lost it all.

797
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,948
With that kind of name,
you should have been careful.

798
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,250
How so?

799
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,160
Well. Brutus. Caesar's son.
The one who murdered him,
stabbed in the back.

800
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,488
Why didn't you tell me before?

801
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,034
You should have paid
attention in school.

802
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,833
Of course.

803
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:51,495
Why do you keep smoking?
Can you tell me?

804
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,155
Because where I live,
we are not allowed to smoke.

805
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:56,491
Even secretly...
So I'm catching up with it.

806
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,073
It's cancer that's gonna
catch up with you...
You won't see it coming. Give me that!

807
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,123
Hmm... okay.

808
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:02,702
Are we going for breakfast?

809
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,374
Not a chance...
I don't have any cash left.

810
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:08,535
No problem. I kept one bill
For cases when business is bad.

811
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,202
Give me that!

812
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,493
This neighbourhood is not very safe.

813
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,029
Thank you.

814
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:21,868
'A gift now that you're
back in business'
What a fucking joke...

815
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,375
I'm so surprised...

816
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,998
Hmm... me too.

817
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,250
There are no croissants
either, where you live?

818
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,367
Uh uh.
Did Didier ever make
you a gift, before?

819
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:33,667
Of course not.

820
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:37,530
So, why did you decide that
he could make you one this time?

821
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,583
I don't know.
I bought it.

822
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,704
Because he flattered you.

823
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:44,538
Yeah, okay. He flattered
me and I fell for it.
Satisfied?

824
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:47,743
Since you don't have much self esteem,
whenever you are flattered, you dive.

825
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,958
I dive?

826
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,238
Hmm hmm.

827
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,953
You were glad when I
dived for you, last time.
You seemed less satisfied with yourself...

828
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,491
Why do you keep busting my
balls, since yesterday?
With your lousy moral...

829
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,705
Who are you anyway?
How come you fell in my life?

830
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:02,158
I didn't fall in your life.
I fell from the sky.

831
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:05,038
No, you fell from a bridge.
I was there, remember?

832
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:06,868
I was there too, smartypants.
I'm talking about before...

833
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,831
Before, I fell from the sky.

834
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:11,288
What do you mean 'fell from the sky'?

835
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,417
From a plane?

836
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:13,696
No, from the sky.

837
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,238
Up There.

838
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,113
That's where I live.

839
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:33,164
I'm an angel.
If you prefer.

840
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:34,458
An angel?

841
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,540
Yes. A real one. Coming from the sky.
With great white wings and all that...

842
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:38,833
Uh yeah?

843
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,409
And where are your great
white wings and all that?

844
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,741
You don't expect me
to unfold them here,
in the middle of the cafe.

845
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,208
A chainsmoking angel?

846
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:46,957
What do you care, if I smoke?
I'm immortal.

847
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,742
Okay then.
You're an angel.

848
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,457
I'm open-minded.
You're an angel. Allright?

849
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,995
Fine. Start with this assumption.
It can not hurt.

850
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,917
Agreed. So...
How are things going
up there? What's up?

851
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,572
Nothing special.
Business as usual.

852
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,954
But tell me! I'd like to understand
how things happen over there.

853
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:04,113
You don't believe me, do you?

854
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,292
Angela...

855
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:09,202
Admit that a beautiful, 6 feet tall, blonde girl,
smoking like a factory, is not
the usual picture of an angel.

856
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,741
And you don't even want
to show me your wings.
How am I supposed to believe you?

857
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,286
You're annoying...
I told you I can't unfold them.

858
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,331
First, they're too large.
And second...

859
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:21,665
I only unfold them when I'm leaving.
When my mission is complete.

860
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,907
But you're so stupid
the mission is far from complete.

861
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:27,165
You're so slow at
figuring things out...
I'm not going home anytime soon.

862
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:29,249
What mission?

863
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,333
I have come to help you.

864
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:32,826
For now, you've only
made things worse.

865
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,288
You're the one making things worse!
Lying all the time, to everybody!

866
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:36,869
Especially to yourself...

867
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:40,656
Not even small lies here and there.
You're lying to yourself
at a very deep level.

868
00:47:40,917 --> 00:47:43,073
And you're afraid.
Of yourself, of
everything, all the time.

869
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,909
You're airtight...
like an oyster who'd
be afraid of the sea.

870
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,208
An oyster?

871
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:47,950
You came down from the sky
to tell me I'm like an oyster?

872
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:51,408
Yes. I came to help you understand
what's going on in here.

873
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:55,495
To help you figure out who you are.
So that you accept it.

874
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,792
That's all?

875
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:57,833
It's good enough.

876
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,741
And how's that different
from a psychoanalyst?

877
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,327
I won't cost you 100 Euros.

878
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,446
Okay.
Let's say you're an angel.

879
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,327
How does it go? You're on your cloud,
and they call you for an assignment?

880
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,788
Quite simplitic,
but that's the idea, yes...

881
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:16,739
And so they call?
'Angela! Can you please
handle case number 12,737? '

882
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,164
No, you don't get to
choose your mission.
It's imposed on you.

883
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:21,744
Actually that's a good thing...

884
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,780
Because if each angel got
to choose his assignment,
the planning department would never manage it.

885
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:27,499
Ah yes... the planning department.

886
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,622
Planning is important. Right...
And after that?

887
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:33,785
Well... after you got your mission,
you go to the dressing room.
It's my favourite part.

888
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:36,994
And what outfit did you choose?

889
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,167
Bitch!

890
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:39,446
Bitch fits you really well.

891
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:40,958
Gee, thanks!

892
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:44,869
I've already tried all the other styles.
I figured it'd be fun to
try something more weird.

893
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:47,708
You've been doing that job for long?

894
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,699
300 years.
Approximately.

895
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:51,700
I'm still young.

896
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:54,988
Why are you laughing?

897
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:05,029
This story is so great!

898
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:08,076
I never heard a girl
who had so much imagination.

899
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:13,783
You should write books,
or encyclopedias...

900
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:15,867
We would make so much money!

901
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,664
You still don't believe me,
is that it?

902
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,654
No.

903
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,201
Hey, Angela...

904
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:45,204
There nothing worse for an angel,
than being rejected by its mate...

905
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:48,291
and returning from a mission
without having completed it.

906
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:51,113
Please, don't be like that...

907
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,576
Understand me... I'm a loser.
I'm in trouble...

908
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,203
...and a bitch would be sent
from the sky to help me?

909
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,369
Yes.
What's the problem?

910
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,789
The problem is that, here on Earth,
we have a hard time believing
in what we can't see.

911
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:06,075
I don't know when was your last visit,
but this world has become
very materialistic.

912
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:09,450
And... and... and...
there are satellites, science, tv...

913
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:12,031
People don't really
believe in miracles.

914
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:15,041
The ney proof.
You understand?

915
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,040
Don't you have a small proof?

916
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:23,613
You men are all the same...
Always needing proof.

917
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,000
Always needing to be reassured.

918
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,366
That's what you keep blaming me for:
my lack of self-confidence.

919
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:32,535
At least, show me that
that I can trust you.
And maybe it'll help me trusting myself.

920
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,408
Don't tell anyone...

921
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,408
I don't want to be fired
because of you.

922
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:42,708
I swear.

923
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:43,988
Shhh!

924
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,866
I... I promise.

925
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,077
Satisfied?

926
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:12,744
How...
How did you do that trick?

927
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,326
Rha! Fuck!
You gotta be kidding!

928
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:18,079
You asked for proof. I provided.
And you don't believe me!

929
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,333
How did you do that trick?

930
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:20,613
You really are a tool...

931
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:22,907
Opening your mind
won't take a miracle,
but a jackhammer.

932
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,446
How come?

933
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,576
I... I haven't seen it clearly.
How you did the cigarette trick.

934
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,831
I... I wasn't focused.
I wasn't looking. And...

935
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:36,119
Angela. I'm asking nicely...
Please, do it again.

936
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:37,654
Please...

937
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,783
It's the last time I'm asking you.

938
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,827
Okay.

939
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:06,657
Garcon!
Another coffee.

940
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:09,240
And a vodka tonic
for this man, please.

941
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,160
Thank you.

942
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,833
Why me?

943
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,784
I don't know...
I'm not from the planning department.

944
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:29,825
Probably because you're good, inside.
And you haven't realized it yet.

945
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:31,908
I'm here to show it to you.

946
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,157
I'm your reflection.

947
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,744
Your image.

948
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:37,576
I am you.

949
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,583
I'm a 6 feet tall bitch?

950
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,285
Yeah. A little.
On the inside.

951
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:53,208
But I'm not a woman.

952
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:57,119
Yes you are. A half...
Actually more feminine than masculine.

953
00:52:57,583 --> 00:53:00,996
That's where you get
your sensibility from.
Your humor, your wit...

954
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,157
...those are feminine traits.

955
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:06,488
Men are hunters...

956
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,203
But you...
You're not really built for hunting.

957
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:12,160
From the masculine side...
You've only kept the bad traits.

958
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:14,910
Lies.
Ambition.

959
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:16,790
Fear of failure.

960
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:18,083
Fear of judgement.

961
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,363
Fear of loving.

962
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:28,708
And you see all this in me?

963
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:29,988
All of it.

964
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,619
And let me tell you
that you're a real hottie inside.

965
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:42,708
It's the outside that troubles me...

966
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:45,991
Okay.
Let's go outside, then...

967
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,538
Am I losing feathers?

968
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,375
Here. In the back.
Am I losing feathers?

969
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:23,417
What?

970
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:24,333
Feathers...

971
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:25,500
Uh?

972
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,328
I have a calcium deficiency.
I need to eat.

973
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,494
You need cheese, for calcium...

974
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,866
Double cheese, double ham,
double salad, please.

975
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:38,579
Don't stare like that.
You look like you're going to eat me.

976
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,500
Ah... sorry.
That's because...

977
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,534
...l'm not used to have...

978
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,250
...someone next to me.

979
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,577
You'd better get used to it, then.

980
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:48,988
I know.

981
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,828
But you know...
In my life, a lot of
bad shit happened to me.

982
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:55,204
And nobody ever helped me with it.

983
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,500
Ever.

984
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,242
You're screwed, now.

985
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,292
Why?

986
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:02,455
Because you don't have an excuse
to stay in trouble anymore.

987
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:04,167
Thank you.

988
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,208
Do you have any mustard, please?

989
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:07,033
On the counter.
It's free.

990
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:08,863
Thanks.

991
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:11,500
Can I take a napkin?

992
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,827
Yep.

993
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:16,746
Hey! Mustard is free.
The sandwich is 8 Euros.

994
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,864
I've just put a 10
Euros bill on the table.

995
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,250
There.

996
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,956
No 10 Euros bill.

997
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,779
Wait... Look on the ground.
It must have flown away...

998
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,042
You never put the 10 Euros.

999
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:30,952
Come on... don't pull that on me.
We need money too.

1000
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:34,534
Keep that trick for the tourists.
I'm from Paris, and I
know too well how you...

1001
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:38,204
Pay! Or else, you not leaving
the park alive! Understand?

1002
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,738
Can I finish the neg'?

1003
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,083
Here yo go.
It's much better like that.

1004
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:43,958
So, how much was it?

1005
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:44,875
It's on me...

1006
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,249
Thank you.

1007
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:52,659
Is... is that clear?

1008
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,371
Hell!
Your masculine side is
quite in-your-face.

1009
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:58,667
Why did you act like that, Andre?

1010
00:55:58,667 --> 00:55:59,994
What did I do wrong?

1011
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:01,863
What is this?

1012
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:03,750
Where did you get it?

1013
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,792
Why didn't you give him his 10 Euros?

1014
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:06,071
Why did you care?

1015
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,238
Can't we talk about
that a bit further?
Come...

1016
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:10,490
Those 10 Euros weren't even yours.
I gave them.

1017
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,492
Exactly: that's all we have left.
Let's go!

1018
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:16,530
You spend your time finding
ways not to communicate, Andre.
You're all over the place. Up to no good.

1019
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:17,833
Sorry for interrupting...

1020
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:18,667
You! Shut up! Okay?

1021
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:21,534
And you... you remind me of those people
who take a second serving of
bread to finish their cheese.

1022
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,829
And then they take more cheese,
to finish the bread.

1023
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:27,165
And if with the French,
it's even more complicated.
They take more wine, to finish both.

1024
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,988
Afterwards, they're
suprised to still be
around lunch at three in the afternoon.

1025
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,577
What kind of lame example was that?

1026
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,829
I don't like cheese.
And I don't see your point anyway.

1027
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:35,955
I'm in trouble.
And I'm trying to get
out of it like I can.

1028
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:37,831
But there no way for
you to understand that.

1029
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:40,204
You can jump from a
bridge, fuck whoever,
smoke like a drunkard...

1030
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,738
Nothing is a problem to you.

1031
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:44,365
Belittling my credit won't
make yours any greater.

1032
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,279
You really are an annoyance, Angela.

1033
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,407
Why do you always have
to intellectualize everything?

1034
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,243
She keeps doing that.
It's irritating.

1035
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:54,113
I'm just trying to
show you the mechanism
that causes you to always screw up.

1036
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,661
She's got a point:
you're screwed.

1037
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,906
Listen, buddy.
You're going to let
me handle this, okay?

1038
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:04,494
I'll be right back.

1039
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,452
Damn, Angela...
Why are you doing this to me?

1040
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,331
You said you're here to help me.
Why are you depressing me?

1041
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,875
Ah? You were feeling better before?

1042
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:12,873
Yeah! Yeah... Nothing exceptionnal,
but I sure was far less confused.

1043
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,618
Why did you want to jump
from a bridge, then?

1044
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:16,202
Because...

1045
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:18,623
See?
She's definitely messing with me.

1046
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,115
What was the initial agreement?
Don't you remember our agreement?

1047
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,330
You were supposed to
shut up and follow me.
Remember?

1048
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:24,792
Yes.
You're right

1049
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:26,071
Well, here you go.

1050
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,250
Shut up, then.

1051
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,707
Don't say anything, okay?

1052
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:30,500
Okay.

1053
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,458
No!

1054
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,283
Don't even say 'okay'.

1055
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:35,914
You shut 100% up.
Okay?

1056
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:38,658
Do you understand '100% '?

1057
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:42,950
Are you done?
Can we start doing
serious business, now?

1058
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:45,871
Angela.
Can you play 'Simon says'?

1059
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,167
I love it!

1060
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:48,624
Simon says:
Beat the shit out of
these three assholes.

1061
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,202
Okay!

1062
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,375
I'm glad I'm rid of them.

1063
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,033
So?
What are we doing now?

1064
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,571
Shhhh!

1065
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,368
We don't say anything.

1066
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:06,618
Now, we're going to go...

1067
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:10,119
...going to go that way.

1068
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:15,744
Angela...
I'd like to know more
about you, actually.

1069
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,289
Your past.
Back when you were on Earth.

1070
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:19,333
Yeah?

1071
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,613
Yes.

1072
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:23,869
Really. I want to know you better.
How were you, as a kid?

1073
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:29,956
We were living in Paris.
In the 13rd district.

1074
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:32,365
I'm the eldest of eight children.

1075
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,497
I'm the one who took care of them.

1076
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:39,202
My mother ran away when I was 15.

1077
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:41,781
And my father was drunk all day.

1078
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,575
I would take the
little ones to school.

1079
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:47,915
Then I would work as a prostitute,
so as to pay for their food.

1080
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:51,781
I died of an ovarian
tumor when I was 23.

1081
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,288
Damn... poor thing.
It's horrible.

1082
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:01,160
What kind of life was that?
Whoa...

1083
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:05,290
And I thought I was in trouble...
I should stop complaining.

1084
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:07,625
Why are you smiling?

1085
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:09,746
Because you're so gullible...
You believed that.

1086
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,279
Ah?
That wasn't true?

1087
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:12,542
Nah...

1088
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:15,374
No.
I'm a rich girl from New Jersey.

1089
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:17,196
Daddy used to work for the U.N.

1090
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,998
And mummy was working
to bring people together...

1091
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,532
...by being humped by all the males
she could find at cocktail parties.

1092
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:25,161
On my 16th birthday,
I got my first Ferrari.

1093
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:27,740
And I smashed it in
the first fall I met.

1094
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,457
Just so that my father
would notice me...

1095
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,082
...at least at my funeral.

1096
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,158
I'm lost, now...
Which was your life?

1097
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:35,905
Which one makes your
own easier to endure?

1098
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:39,667
I don't know.

1099
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:43,577
I can make up a thousand of lives.
But yours will still be the same.

1100
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,288
You'll have to accept it.

1101
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,285
I...
I see what you mean, Angela.

1102
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:53,374
And...
I'm working on it.

1103
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,989
But still...
I want to know you.

1104
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:01,665
Who were you?
Before...

1105
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:14,957
I don't know who I am.

1106
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,915
How can't you know?

1107
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:19,204
You come from the sky.
You're in the best position to know...

1108
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:22,326
We can't access our past.
It's top secret data.

1109
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,029
Really?

1110
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,577
That gotta suck.

1111
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:31,208
Are my questions bothering you?

1112
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:32,250
No.

1113
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,663
You're interested in me.
That means you're getting
interested in you.

1114
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:37,125
I'm not really interesting.

1115
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,452
Of course you are!

1116
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,333
You're good looking, smart...

1117
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:41,583
Stop making fun of me.

1118
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:42,957
You are!
I tell you!

1119
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:46,041
It's all inside. But you don't see it.
You can't pull it out.

1120
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:48,366
I'm trying.
I know...

1121
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:50,917
But it's not easy.

1122
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:53,322
Yes it's easy!
Come, I'll show you!

1123
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:58,582
Look in the mirror!
What do you see?

1124
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,904
Look in the mirror...
What do you see?

1125
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:04,994
I see...

1126
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:07,208
A wonderful girl.

1127
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:10,870
Thank you. And next to her?
What do you see?

1128
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:14,458
I don't know.

1129
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:15,833
Good.
You're improving.

1130
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:16,542
You think so?

1131
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,200
Yes.
All you used to see
was a pile of crap.

1132
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,951
Now, you don't see anything anymore.

1133
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:22,033
It means you've cleaned up the place.

1134
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,120
Now, we need to
fill that empty shell with something.

1135
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,368
You can't leave it like that.

1136
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,990
So, take a good look.
In front of you...

1137
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:35,160
Isn't there anything you like,
in this beautiful face?

1138
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,000
Not much, no...

1139
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,910
Look carefully. In your eyes.
What do you see?

1140
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,075
Some... some kindness?

1141
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:58,030
Yes there is. A lot...
What else?

1142
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,577
They're not too bad?

1143
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:08,996
Beauty. That's right.

1144
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,624
They are beautiful.

1145
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,363
What else?

1146
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,077
Maybe...

1147
01:02:20,792 --> 01:02:21,958
Some sweetness?

1148
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,791
Yes.
Lots of it.

1149
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,743
And love?

1150
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,327
Yeah.

1151
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,699
Lots of love, yes.

1152
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,000
Too much, maybe.

1153
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,907
If there's too much,
you need to get it out.

1154
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:37,792
Tell me you love me.

1155
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:38,792
Come again?

1156
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:39,667
Don't you love me?

1157
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:40,917
I do.
A lot.

1158
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:42,244
I mean...

1159
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,368
I feel a kind of affection...

1160
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:46,000
But maybe it's friendship, and...

1161
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,784
Do you love me, or not?

1162
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:55,248
Since the first day.

1163
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:58,910
Since the first second.

1164
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,329
Good.
Say it, then.

1165
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,579
It's...
It's hard to say.

1166
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:12,113
Do you know why?

1167
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:12,917
No.

1168
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:14,658
Because nobody ever told it to you.

1169
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,244
Right?

1170
01:03:17,917 --> 01:03:21,827
It's difficult to love yourself,
when nobody shows you how.

1171
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:24,154
Yes.

1172
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:28,204
I love you, Andre.

1173
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,281
Here you go.
You have received love.

1174
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,367
Now you can give some away.

1175
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:34,904
Go for it.

1176
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:43,163
I love you, Angela.

1177
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:46,874
Whatever your fist name...

1178
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:48,738
You're right.

1179
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:50,208
Say it again...

1180
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,033
...without my name.

1181
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,454
I love you.

1182
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:00,196
Good.

1183
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:05,077
Now, look at yourself in the eye
and say it.

1184
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:19,792
I can't.

1185
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:21,119
Of course you can.

1186
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:25,367
Look at your body.
Bruised by the lack of love...

1187
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:26,904
...of trust.

1188
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:30,956
Don't you see it
deserves your attention?

1189
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:34,041
So, don't reject this wounded body.

1190
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:36,958
It has put up with you for so long...

1191
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,329
...and never complained.

1192
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,786
Tell him that he's important.

1193
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,706
That he belongs here.

1194
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:49,708
Give him what he deserves.

1195
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:15,030
I love you... Andre.

1196
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,788
I love you.

1197
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,366
I am proud of you, Andre.

1198
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:28,201
So? Can we get some food?
I'm hungry...

1199
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:30,613
You're obsessed with food, aren't you?

1200
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:32,119
Do you have an emotional problem?

1201
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,615
Hey, that's my line!

1202
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,529
You're right.

1203
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,529
How are we going to pay the bill?

1204
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:50,207
We'll wash the dishes...

1205
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:51,910
It only worked in the Dark Ages.

1206
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:53,535
They're going to call the cops.
And we'll end up in jail.

1207
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:55,450
I have a 6 months suspended sentence.
I know where I'm...

1208
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:58,197
Stop complaining, now.
Just enjoy.

1209
01:05:58,458 --> 01:05:59,785
The wine is good, isn't it?

1210
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:00,958
What kind is it?

1211
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,238
Chateau Cheval Blanc.

1212
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:05,119
Cheval Blanc?

1213
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:06,667
It's 1,000 Euros!

1214
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,823
1,500
It was the most expensive.

1215
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,576
It sucks.
This place sucks.

1216
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,243
Being the most expensive
doesn't mean it's the best, Angela.

1217
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,242
How would you know?
You deal in olive oil.

1218
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,491
Yes, but I know a thing or two.
I...

1219
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:20,163
I'm sure the menu has
some good little wines,
at very reasonable prices.

1220
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:23,249
Look! Saint Chignon '98.
100 Euros. I'm sure it's good.

1221
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,542
Sommelier!

1222
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:25,583
Yes?

1223
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:26,167
What are you doing?

1224
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:27,956
Well... we're going to taste.

1225
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:30,490
Can we have a Saint
Chignon '98, please?

1226
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,990
Oh, of course.
It's almost at maturity right now.

1227
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,992
It's a bit peppery, a little round.

1228
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,040
It's a very good wine.
A very good choice.

1229
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:38,208
It's my favourite.

1230
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,784
Can we simply have half a bottle?

1231
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:42,495
No, we only have liters, here.

1232
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,041
You're crazy!
I swear... you're totally crazy.

1233
01:06:46,292 --> 01:06:48,366
You've had a hard day.
I'm trying to please you.

1234
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:49,999
Is that your mission?
Pleasing me?

1235
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:53,829
No. I'm supposed to teach you
the most things as
quickly as possible.

1236
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,742
So that you give up
jumping from bridges.

1237
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,535
If you intend to pay the bill
by doing dirty things
in the restroom...

1238
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:00,332
...I won't wait for you at the bar.
I'm warning you.

1239
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,750
What dirty stuff?

1240
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,239
Don't act innocent... I was there,
behind the door. I've seen everything.

1241
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:08,032
Have you seen...
or heard?

1242
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,577
Angela?

1243
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,827
What?

1244
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:17,494
What're you doing?

1245
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:20,119
Guess...

1246
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:22,742
I don't want...
I don't want you do do this for me.

1247
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,250
I thought you needed money.

1248
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,324
Yes, I need it.
But I still have some morality left.

1249
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:29,202
I thank you for it...
I appreciate the gesture...

1250
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:30,999
But no, really.
No way you're doing this at all.

1251
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,075
Come on...
It's nothing.

1252
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,375
Yes, it's something!

1253
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:36,200
Listen. Stop right now.
Ask this man to go back home.

1254
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:37,542
Come out, right now!

1255
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:39,865
Can't you give me a break,
so that I can finish? Fuck!

1256
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,827
And what about Frank, then?

1257
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:48,323
In his office...
What did you do?

1258
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,417
You didn't do that!

1259
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:54,324
No...
Just kidding.

1260
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,827
What a relief...

1261
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,658
But how did you get the money?

1262
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,167
You can't have done that!

1263
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:14,655
Which option would you rather have?

1264
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,285
I'd rather go away.

1265
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:28,542
For a single night, is that it?

1266
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:29,167
Yes.

1267
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:30,494
Good.

1268
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,113
All done.

1269
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,827
Do you have...
any luggage?

1270
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:37,288
Yes. One item.
Right in front.

1271
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:52,785
Feeling better?

1272
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:54,369
Yeah, I'm fine...

1273
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:55,863
Are you coming to bed?

1274
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,167
No, I'm looking at the city.

1275
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,241
It'll still be there tomorrow.
Come to bed.

1276
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,206
Paris is beautiful.

1277
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,458
I wasn't seeing anything.

1278
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:08,125
I was blind like a bat.

1279
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:10,792
Angela...

1280
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:12,071
What?

1281
01:09:13,042 --> 01:09:14,321
I think I love you.

1282
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,491
No you don't...
You're horny, that's all.

1283
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:20,447
You're lacking affection.
So you're hanging on to
the first one you run into.

1284
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:21,958
i. e: me!

1285
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,826
No, no... Really.
You make me feel good.

1286
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:27,707
I love how you shake me up.

1287
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,032
Without ever judging me.

1288
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:32,164
It makes me happy.

1289
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,541
It's been a while since
this happened to me.

1290
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:37,284
It probably never did.

1291
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:39,166
You want to fuck, that's all.

1292
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:41,324
No, I don't want to fuck...

1293
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,454
Actually, I do,
but that's not it.

1294
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:46,619
It's stronger.
Warmer...

1295
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,665
Oh la la!
You're waxing sentimental.

1296
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:49,792
Come on, let's fuck!

1297
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:51,747
No no no! Stop that!
What are you doing? Hey!

1298
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:54,207
Don't you like me?

1299
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:57,657
Yes, yes... I do.
But I don't want to fuck.

1300
01:09:57,917 --> 01:10:01,827
I'd like to make love.
But I'll only do it once I feel...

1301
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,410
...free.

1302
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,201
And what about me?

1303
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,541
It won't take long.

1304
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:13,198
Come on...
Come to bed.

1305
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:14,500
I can't sleep.

1306
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,407
And there's no point in brooding.

1307
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:18,953
I'm not brooding.
I'm enjoying the room.

1308
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:20,917
It's incredible.

1309
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:22,623
By the way...
How are we going to pay for it?

1310
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:25,079
I have an agreement
with the head porter.

1311
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:26,375
How so?

1312
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,282
He bets on races.

1313
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:30,082
So I gave him a tip.

1314
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:31,375
A bad tip?

1315
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,200
No, he's going to make 10,000 Euros.

1316
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:35,083
You know races results?

1317
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:36,363
Any race.
Anywhere in the world.

1318
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,953
Are you kidding me?
You let me bet on
that rotten Brutus...

1319
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:40,250
I had warned you.

1320
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,739
But a few hours ago
you wouldn't listen to me.

1321
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,615
And anyway... I'm not allowed to
give away that kind of information.

1322
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,154
It's forbidden.

1323
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,243
You're not allowed to
give away that kind of information?

1324
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,989
Why... Why did you tell me
that you're an angel, then?

1325
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:57,707
I shouldn't have.

1326
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:00,202
Why did you do it, then?

1327
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:10,202
Hey!

1328
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:11,667
What are you doing, Angela?

1329
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,373
I'm off to see your buddy Frank.

1330
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:15,367
What? In the middle of the night?
What are you going to tell him?

1331
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,532
I'm not the one who
has things to tell him.
You are!

1332
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:20,743
So we're going to see him.
And you'll tell him
everything you need.

1333
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,991
So that I can go back home.

1334
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,077
Angela...

1335
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,164
Okay...
So, what should I tell him?

1336
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,125
You're doing it again...

1337
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,500
I told you a hundred times!

1338
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,909
The truth!
Nothing but the truth.

1339
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:35,707
The truth.
No problem. Okay.

1340
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,625
If you don't do that, your pain
will stay here, in a ball.

1341
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,665
It's weaker, but it's
still here, yeah...

1342
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:43,488
You've got to get it out.
Once for all!

1343
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,788
If it's outside,
it won't trouble you inside anymore.

1344
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:47,451
Okay. No problem.
I agree.

1345
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:48,750
And after that?

1346
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:52,530
After that? You'll be
cleared, on the inside.
You'll just have to fill up.

1347
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:55,040
Angela...
What if it's with you
that I want to fill up?

1348
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:56,666
Ah...
Don't do that again.

1349
01:11:56,917 --> 01:11:59,038
Angela, I'm in love with you.

1350
01:11:59,292 --> 01:12:01,282
You see everything.
You feel everything...

1351
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,785
How can't you see
something this simple?

1352
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:08,203
Focus, please.
Right here...

1353
01:12:09,667 --> 01:12:11,290
What do you feel?

1354
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:14,875
I feel something, but...

1355
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:17,908
I feel exactly the same thing.

1356
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,658
And now I know how it's called.

1357
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,292
Anyway...

1358
01:12:23,292 --> 01:12:24,333
Let's go meet Frank...

1359
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:27,450
Things are getting really messy.

1360
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:32,455
No.
Things only start to
looking clear now.

1361
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:34,410
Like...

1362
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,326
Looking like the truth, for instance.

1363
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:40,664
I'm tired, Angela... I swear.

1364
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:44,622
I'm tired of screwing up all the time.

1365
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,866
Tired of lies...

1366
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:53,031
For the first time in my life,
I want to be true.

1367
01:12:56,792 --> 01:12:58,782
I'll be able to say everything I feel.

1368
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,369
Everything.

1369
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:05,160
Do you know what I'm feeling, Angela?

1370
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:06,869
Shut up.

1371
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,706
Miss!
Miss!

1372
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,700
Miss, please...
Miss.

1373
01:13:19,417 --> 01:13:22,331
Now is really not the
time to fuck with me.

1374
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:27,542
Sorry for interrupting you like that
in the middle of the night...

1375
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:29,533
...but Andre has something
very important to tell you.

1376
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:31,866
I can't take it anymore,
and I want to go home...

1377
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,582
...so let's end this now!

1378
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:34,750
Come again?

1379
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,417
Who's that girl?

1380
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:37,040
You!
Shut the hell up!

1381
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:38,417
Andre! Come in!

1382
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:40,656
He's here.
In his bed...

1383
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,540
What the fuck is this?

1384
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:47,997
When you start breaking the rules,
you really go for it...

1385
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,241
The door...
The bodyguard...

1386
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,532
And you chose this
place because you knew
that's where he would stay.

1387
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:55,201
You're going to be fired.

1388
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:57,283
That's not your business.
It's mine.

1389
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,828
Be nice, now.
And deal with him quickly...

1390
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:01,410
...so that we can get the hell away.

1391
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,279
Okay.

1392
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:07,910
Andre...

1393
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:09,988
Andre...

1394
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:16,741
You're not going to
kill me, aren't you?

1395
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,324
Your coffee isn't bad, Frank.

1396
01:14:28,417 --> 01:14:31,829
Andre... I... I... I...
I'm sorry.

1397
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:33,363
I... I know I offended you.

1398
01:14:33,542 --> 01:14:34,951
And it really was stupid of me, buddy.

1399
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:36,250
Buddy?

1400
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,529
No. Sorry about that.

1401
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,994
I took advantage of
your weakness, sir,
and really I shouldn't have.

1402
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,873
That... that was pathetic of me.

1403
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:47,117
There's even some business
we could do together.
If you want... That is, if you have the time

1404
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:51,285
But I beg you... Andy.

1405
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:56,413
Do not kill me.
Be nice... do not kill me.

1406
01:14:57,417 --> 01:14:59,206
I'm sorry I borrowed
money from you, Frank.

1407
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,532
It's my fault.
I'm the one to blame.

1408
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:04,324
In the first place,
I should never have
set foot in your lousy club.

1409
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,708
It cost me time and money...

1410
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:08,327
Instead of taking care of the business
for which I came to Paris.

1411
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,457
But there's no escaping it.

1412
01:15:10,917 --> 01:15:14,365
When you feel like shit, you're attracted by
the other pieces of shit
like you. That's life.

1413
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:17,663
That's why we used to get along fine,
in the beginning, Frank.

1414
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:21,365
We could hate each other mutually.
That wasn't a problem.

1415
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,573
One day, an angel entered my life.

1416
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,329
A wonderful woman, who opened my eyes.

1417
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,155
It's so good to have
the eyes opened, Frank.

1418
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:41,906
Now I can look at the
sun, rising over Paris.

1419
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:45,497
All these small lightbulbs...
switching off, one by one.

1420
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,289
I can see all this, Frank.

1421
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:52,041
And it's thanks to her.

1422
01:15:53,167 --> 01:15:55,785
Because she had the
kindness never to judge me.

1423
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,373
She loved me as I was.

1424
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,958
Even though I wasn't much.

1425
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,741
I am happy for you, Andre.
Sincerely.

1426
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,868
But you're not going to
kill me, aren't you?

1427
01:16:16,917 --> 01:16:18,196
No.

1428
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,956
I'm going to feel sorry for you.

1429
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,620
Did you see that, Angela?
I did really good, for a first time!

1430
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:25,917
Where are you?

1431
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,244
Angela?

1432
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:31,910
Angela...

1433
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,667
Angela, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

1434
01:17:28,667 --> 01:17:29,500
I'm going home.

1435
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,874
You can't do this to me.
It's impossible.

1436
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:33,163
Angela, stop!
I did all you asked me to do.

1437
01:17:33,417 --> 01:17:34,993
Look!
I've emptied everything.

1438
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,908
Now we can start over, together.

1439
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:39,323
We'll be together, choosing the things
that will fullfill me. Like we said.

1440
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:40,993
You're big enough to
choose on your own, now.

1441
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,625
I don't want to choose on my own!

1442
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:44,201
I want to do this with you, Angela.

1443
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:46,911
Because I love you. And I want to spend
the time I have left
to live at your side.

1444
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,536
If you leave me, it's
going to be horrible.
I'll be falling back on my old habits.

1445
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:51,166
As if I had gone this far for nothing.

1446
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,740
Well... too bad.
Destroy yourself if you want.

1447
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,493
I took many chances for you.

1448
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,824
I've got a 9/10 chance of being fired.

1449
01:17:58,083 --> 01:18:00,157
So please be helpful, Andre.
Don't ruin it all.

1450
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,957
And live the life you
are meant to live.

1451
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:05,373
Angela! What if the life
I'm meant to live was
the one where I'm staying with you?

1452
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:08,706
No! I already know your life entirely.

1453
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:10,914
In two months, you will
create your company.

1454
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:14,947
In five years, it's going to be
the leading olive oil business.

1455
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,167
You're going to meet Catherine.
A lovely 30 years old lawyer.

1456
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:21,119
With whom you will have
three beautiful children.

1457
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:23,449
Do you want to know their names?

1458
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:27,291
Do you want to know how
they'll do in school?

1459
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:31,450
I want to know why you're crying.

1460
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:34,280
Because...
Because it's always like that
when a mission is completed.

1461
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:36,497
I'm made for meeting.
Not for goodbyes.

1462
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,871
Are you satisfied with this answer?

1463
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,529
Listen to me.

1464
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:43,574
What you've done for me was enormous.

1465
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:45,083
You have my eternal appreciation.

1466
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:47,916
'Eternal'?
Please, don't use words
you don't understand.

1467
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:49,908
Angela, listen to me...
I'm sorry.

1468
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:52,035
Forgive me.

1469
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,698
You've taught me what matters:
to stop lying.

1470
01:18:58,417 --> 01:18:59,826
That's right.
That's the most important thing.

1471
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:02,121
So why don't you stop lying yourself!

1472
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:06,118
Angela, stop!
Listen to me.

1473
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,868
Look at me.
Look at me in the eye.

1474
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:08,667
Stop!

1475
01:19:08,667 --> 01:19:09,994
Look at me.

1476
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,292
Leave me alone.

1477
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:13,868
Let me tell you what
I see in these eyes...

1478
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:18,030
I see a woman who doesn't want to leave.
A woman who's tired of
not knowing who she is.

1479
01:19:19,417 --> 01:19:22,201
Like me, nobody ever
told you he loved you.
And if someone did, you don't remember.

1480
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:23,083
Shut up.

1481
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,458
I love you, Angela!

1482
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:25,042
Shut up.

1483
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:26,499
I love you.

1484
01:19:27,542 --> 01:19:28,292
Shut up!

1485
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:29,667
I can't live without you.
It's impossible!

1486
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:31,741
What's the point of living with me?

1487
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,327
What are you talking about?

1488
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:35,373
I'd be an angel who burned her wings.

1489
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:36,833
A fallen angel.

1490
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,113
I don't care about that!

1491
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:40,531
I love you the way you are.

1492
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:50,625
I don't know...

1493
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,166
...who I am!

1494
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:54,123
I have no past.

1495
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:55,654
Can you understand that?

1496
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:56,500
I know... I know...

1497
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,364
How can...
How can, I achieve anything?

1498
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:01,667
I know...

1499
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:03,906
...if I don't know where I come from.

1500
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:08,077
I don't know where I come from.
I don't know where I come from...

1501
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:16,745
I know...
I know.

1502
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,866
I know you don't have a past.

1503
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:28,120
But at least, let me
give you a future.

1504
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:35,373
What am I doing?

1505
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,404
My god...

1506
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:40,369
What am I doing?

1507
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:45,120
Can you leave god out of
this decision, for once?

1508
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:02,041
Angela... what's going on?
What's wrong, Angela?

1509
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:03,998
What's happening to you?

1510
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,529
I have to go, Andre.

1511
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:14,917
It's time.

1512
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:17,452
Don't go! I'm begging you.
I love you.

1513
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:19,913
I love you too, Andre.

1514
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,333
I must go.

1515
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:24,613
No!

1516
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,779
Angela, I love you!

1517
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:56,914
My name is Andre.
Andre Moussa.

1518
01:24:57,167 --> 01:25:00,165
I'm 28 years old.
And I am... free.
