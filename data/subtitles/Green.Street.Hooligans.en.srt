1
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,838
<i>I know I am
I'm sure I am</i>

2
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:42,097
<i>I'm West Ham till I die</i>

3
00:00:47,024 --> 00:00:49,144
Go on, bruv. Go on, bruv.

4
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,526
Fuck me.

5
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:58,625
If I knew we was
going to a bar mitzvah...

6
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,470
...I would have brought me
fucking skullcap.

7
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,626
Mate, Tottenham's due north.

8
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:06,794
Are you lost? Or just fucking stupid?

9
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:09,614
- Still a stand-up comedian, eh, Dunham?
- Oh, shut up.

10
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:12,001
All right, mate.
You know, back when the Major...

11
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,500
...was doing your job,
he wasn't nearly so chatty.

12
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,721
Probably because he wasn't
quite so nervous either.

13
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:21,261
Yeah, the Major always preferred
a scrap to your yammer.

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,720
- What's all that? What is that?
- Yammer?

15
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:25,347
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:28,764
Mate, I think you should get on
the next train and fuck off out of here.

17
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:31,183
Before something bad happens.

18
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:35,838
Maybe we'll be interested
to see exactly what that is.

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,520
You're not exactly top-flight mob
these days, are you?

20
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:40,666
Hey? More like a two-bob mob.

21
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:44,715
See? Now that's just plain rude.

22
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:48,402
But, hey, if you fancy it,
who are we to let you down?

23
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:55,982
You fucking cunt. You.

24
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:14,732
Let's go.

25
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:18,755
I'm telling you, you don't need Lewis.

26
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:23,377
No, I know... Look, I will trade you
Keyshawn and Maddox for Lewis.

27
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,971
<i>- Maddox?
- And I'm gonna be losing out on this deal.</i>

28
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,193
Because Keyshawn, he's back with the...

29
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:30,844
He's back with the old coach.
He's back with Parcells.

30
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:36,513
And they are gonna be an unstoppable team.
You know that. I know that.

31
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:42,191
Hey, look, man,
he was comeback player of the year.

32
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,780
You know? Not many guys have thrown
over 6000 yards.

33
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:48,657
Come on, you...

34
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,270
Look, let me call you back.
I gotta deal with something.

35
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:55,553
<i>All right, but I...</i>

36
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:59,162
Buckner.

37
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:03,235
That's $10,000,
I think it's a pretty good deal.

38
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:06,612
We never had a deal, Jeremy.

39
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,291
Look. I know you got screwed here.

40
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:15,614
But I have my family's reputation
to protect.

41
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:19,311
I mean, a Van Holden getting expelled
from Harvard.

42
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,199
There's no way.

43
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:23,834
I've got a little more
at stake here, Matt.

44
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,480
Buckner?

45
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,550
Come on, man.

46
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,760
My dad is definitely gonna get re-elected.

47
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,689
When I graduate, I'll totally hook you up.

48
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,668
Thanks, bro.

49
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,850
You're really saving my ass.

50
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,924
<i>You've reached Carl Buckner.</i>

51
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,110
<i>I'm currently on assignment in Kabul,
and I'm unreachable.</i>

52
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:31,964
<i>Leave a message with
the Foreign Correspondence Desk...</i>

53
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,359
<i>...of the Washington Bureau
of the Times...</i>

54
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:38,458
<i>...and I will get back to you
as soon as possible. Thanks so much.</i>

55
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,391
<i>This is a security announcement
at Heathrow Airport.</i>

56
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,270
<i>Please keep your belongings
with you at all times.</i>

57
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:31,896
<i>My name is Matt Buckner.
Last spring, I got kicked out of Harvard...</i>

58
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:35,541
<i>...two months shy of my diploma.
But what I was about to learn...</i>

59
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:39,088
<i>...no Ivy-League school in the world
could teach me.</i>

60
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:08,511
<i>Mind the gap.
Please stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

61
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,848
<i>Mind the gap.
Please stand clear.</i>

62
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,303
All right.

63
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,350
Matt?

64
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,644
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

65
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,213
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

66
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,879
You too. Was there a terrorist attack?
What happened here?

67
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,511
Oh, welcome to match-day madness.
Tottenham was in town last night.

68
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,021
Are you a soccer fan now?

69
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,358
Don't let them hear you
say the word "soccer."

70
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,106
- Who's them?
- The British Empire.

71
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,602
Uncle Matt, meet Ben.

72
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:00,784
- Can you believe that?
- Hey there, little guy.

73
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,882
- He's adorable.
- Yeah.

74
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:08,638
It is so good to see you.
But what are you doing here?

75
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,069
It just doesn't make any sense, Matt.

76
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:18,707
Why would you have been expelled
if you didn't do anything wrong?

77
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,859
It was my roommate.
He's a total cokehead.

78
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:26,512
Somebody tipped off campus security
and we got our room searched.

79
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:29,677
They found his stash in my stuff.

80
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:33,117
I guess he'd been hiding his shit
in my closet the entire time.

81
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:35,194
Really?

82
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:38,473
Yeah. Really.

83
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,989
No, I mean, you could tell me
if you were taking...

84
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:44,091
- It's not like that.
- You fought it and they didn't believe you?

85
00:09:46,382 --> 00:09:47,862
Matt?

86
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:49,663
You fought it, right?

87
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:53,318
Look, you don't know who this guy is.

88
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,684
He's a Van Holden.

89
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:58,672
I wouldn't have even had a chance.

90
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,168
So what did Dad say?

91
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:04,835
"You've reached Carl Buckner."

92
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:07,948
Oh, "I'll be in the Ivory Coast
for the next 57 years."

93
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,039
- Kabul this time.
- Whatever.

94
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,473
Seriously, though, when you spoke to him,
what'd he say?

95
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:18,166
- I didn't tell him.
- He doesn't know?

96
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:24,296
You know what? If I was you,
I probably would've done the same thing.

97
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,671
- Yeah?
- Once he finds out that his golden boy...

98
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:31,046
...just got kicked out of Harvard, he'll dive
head first into an empty swimming pool.

99
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,109
Gee, thanks.

100
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:36,806
Oh, Steve's home.

101
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:39,991
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

102
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:46,658
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, honey, we have a guest.

103
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:50,285
This is my kid brother, Matt.

104
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,087
Hello, mate. How you doing?

105
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,127
- It's good to finally meet you.
- And you.

106
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,410
Finally made it
across the pond, then, did you?

107
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:58,985
Yeah.

108
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:03,241
Who's this? Who's this? Come on.

109
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:05,546
I missed you. Come here.

110
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:10,202
- Yeah.
- I missed you, my little lord Ben.

111
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:12,391
- Honey, you want some tea?
- That'd be great.

112
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,520
- Tea, huh?
- Get over it.

113
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,591
- Good-looking little geezer, isn't he?
- He sure is.

114
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:21,333
Listen, Matt, I'm really pleased
you're here, mate...

115
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,846
...but I kind of
made some plans for tonight.

116
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,950
I've got this romantic evening set up.
Got a babysitter booked...

117
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:29,438
<i>...and we got tickets to see Chicago.</i>

118
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,739
You wouldn't mind if we go, would you?

119
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,911
Hold on, excuse me.

120
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,461
What a surprise.

121
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:43,528
- What you doing?
- Aye, aye. All right, bruv.

122
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:49,444
Jesus, Shannon, you look rough.

123
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,279
You're a funny guy, Pete.

124
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:56,387
Matt, this is Pete, Steve's brother.
Pete, this is my brother, Matt.

125
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:58,126
- Hey.
- Hi, son.

126
00:11:58,395 --> 00:11:59,315
Good to meet you.

127
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:01,973
Hello, Ben.

128
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:06,031
<i>I'm West Ham till I die
I'm West Ham till I die</i>

129
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:09,245
<i>I know I am
I'm sure I am</i>

130
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,573
- I'm taking him to bed. Hey.
- All right, babe.

131
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:16,072
See you later, Ben.

132
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:17,529
- Well done.
- What?

133
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,749
- I thought you were going to the match.
- Well, technically, yes.

134
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:24,645
But me and the boys got into a bit
of a drinking session last night.

135
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,686
One thing's led to another...

136
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:31,446
- Let me guess. You've lost your wallet.
- And me keys. There's a taxi outside.

137
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,521
Top bloke, my brother.

138
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,180
So...

139
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,877
How are we, my colonial cousin?

140
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,980
- Fine, thanks.
- "Fine, thanks."

141
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:54,162
You couldn't make it 100, could you?

142
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:57,174
- Yeah, how does "piss off" sound?
- Oh, fuck off, come on.

143
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,820
<i>Get some drinks in
Get some drinks in</i>

144
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:04,649
<i>- Get...
- Shut up. Just shut up.</i>

145
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,502
I'll tell you what I'll do, all right?

146
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,061
I'll give you...

147
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:13,153
...a hundred...

148
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,574
...if you take Matt to the match.

149
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,981
Oh, fuck off, you're having a bubble.

150
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,771
Bruv, you know I can't
take a Yank to football.

151
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:26,505
Yeah, you can. And you're gonna be
on your best behavior, do you understand?

152
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,500
- Go on.
- Well, come on, then.

153
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,208
Cheers, Matt. We don't get
much time on our own.

154
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:40,942
Right.

155
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:45,489
Listen to me. You don't give him
the money. Okay? No way.

156
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,523
- That's beer for the boys.
- All right.

157
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,480
All right.

158
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:52,534
Matt? Where are you going?

159
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:54,568
I'm going to the soccer game with Pete.

160
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:59,174
- But you just got here.
- I know, but I'll catch up with you later.

161
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,279
- Yeah, have a good time.
- Hurry up.

162
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:03,326
See you.

163
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:06,848
I don't want him hanging out
with Pete and those thugs.

164
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,276
It's all right. He's a big boy.
He can look after himself, can't he?

165
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:13,734
Pick a hand. Come on.

166
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,580
The right hand?
You've just won the star prize.

167
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,230
Yeah?

168
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:29,446
- How much do you love me?
- A lot.

169
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,839
That's not enough.

170
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
Look, mate...

171
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:40,344
...I'm not being funny.

172
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:43,368
But the last thing I wanna do
is take you to the match with me.

173
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:45,615
So here's how it works.

174
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:48,265
Give me half the money.
I'll go to football.

175
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:51,014
You can have a wander round
where Churchill took a tom.

176
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:53,885
Or whatever it is that you Yanks do
in jolly old.

177
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:58,563
- A tom?
- A tom. A tom tit, a shit.

178
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,600
It's rhyming slang.
Like "bees and honey" for money.

179
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:06,282
All right, I can say to you,
give me the fucking bees.

180
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,648
I made a promise to Steve.

181
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:12,886
Well, Steve ain't here, is he, mate? I am.
And to be honest...

182
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,825
...you're pissing in the wind
if you think I'm taking you.

183
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:20,502
- I'm not giving you the money.
- You ain't really got a fucking choice, mate.

184
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:24,938
And you're starting to get on my tits.
Give me half the money.

185
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,955
Cops!

186
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,560
Well, how fucking stupid
do you feel now?

187
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,110
Come on then, dance for me, Yankee.

188
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:43,218
Serves you right for fighting
like a bleeding tart.

189
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:47,787
But try that again,
and I will kick the shit out of you.

190
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:50,385
Yeah, the tom out of me, I get it.

191
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,535
Get up, come on.

192
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:57,167
So. I'm guessing you're not much
of a fighter.

193
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,000
Fighter? That's probably
the first fight I ever had.

194
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:01,884
You call that a fight?

195
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,270
Fuck it. I will take you with me.
You might learn something.

196
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:14,221
- About soccer?
- No, mate. Not about soccer.

197
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,940
And for fuck's sake,
stop saying "soccer."

198
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:22,614
Come on, hurry up.

199
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,063
What are you talking about,
baseball is a girl's game?

200
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,667
The Red Sox have a guy that pitches
a ball at over 90 miles an hour.

201
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:35,814
Who cares? All that means is
he can have a wank faster than you.

202
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:38,306
- Come on.
- Think about it.

203
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,927
I just don't get it.
What is it with you Americans?

204
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,678
You start a fucking war, bottle it...

205
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,989
...then we have to come
save your ass again.

206
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,441
Save our ass?

207
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,260
Yes. And then, on top of that,
you kill half our soldiers in friendly fire.

208
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:59,024
- That's called an accident.
- Yeah, accident, my ass.

209
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:00,658
- All right.
- All right, Dunham.

210
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:01,799
You all right, mate.

211
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:03,607
Look...

212
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,405
...we're sort of going into my place
of business, right?

213
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:10,917
Shut up until you're spoken to
and you might have a better run of things.

214
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:14,946
Only thing regarded worse than a Yank
around here are coppers and journalists.

215
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:18,468
- What do you got against journalists?
- How long you got?

216
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:22,692
They're lying fucking scum
who'll write anything just to fill papers.

217
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:26,907
I mean, not your old man, of course.
He's the exception maybe.

218
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:29,802
That's a point. These boys don't know
about your old man.

219
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:33,116
And if I was you, I'd keep it that way.
Another thing.

220
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:36,294
What you hear in here
stays in here, all right?

221
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:39,946
No blabbing to brother Steve about
how your day was or who said what.

222
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:42,936
What happens at football
stays at football, all right?

223
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,896
Yeah, all right.

224
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:48,582
Let's have some fun. It's football day.

225
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,777
All right, Pete.

226
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:56,596
Aye, aye!

227
00:17:57,649 --> 00:17:58,729
Welcome back.

228
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:00,749
- We good?
- Yeah, good. yeah, good.

229
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:01,985
How you doing, mate.

230
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:04,833
All right, boys.
This is Matt, Shannon's brother.

231
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:06,474
- You got Ned.
- Nice to meet you.

232
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:08,538
- Dave.
- Nice to meet you.

233
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,226
- Swill.
- Hello, mate.

234
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:13,374
Ike, and the one with the dodgy
haircut's Keith.

235
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,586
- Hey, Keith.
- I'll get the drinks in, then.

236
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,233
Yeah, go on, get the drinks in.

237
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:19,579
- Does that mean I'm getting them?
- Every fucking time.

238
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:21,877
Every fucking time.
Every fucking time.

239
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:25,342
- Fine.
- Where's Bovver?

240
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:27,114
Been in the toilet for 15 minutes.

241
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:30,064
Like dodgy Ruby or something,
down at Bengal last night.

242
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,307
Look, he looks lost.

243
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:34,196
No, "Ruby Murray" means curry.
We call it Cockney rhyming...

244
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,879
- ...slang.
- Slang. Like "bees and honey" for money.

245
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:39,549
- That's it, yeah.
- Like "struggle and grunt" for cunt.

246
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,177
- Oh, you went dark. Why'd you go...?
- I'm not a cunt.

247
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:44,084
Like "septic tank" for Yank.

248
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:46,032
Hello.

249
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:47,445
- All right, Bovver.
- Pete.

250
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:49,301
- How you doing? All right?
- Sweet.

251
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,016
This is Matt, Shannon's brother.

252
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:52,532
Hey.

253
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,467
That's the proper, right?
He don't give a fuck, does he?

254
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:00,611
Mate, he's practically family.

255
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,317
Mate, it's fucking painful.

256
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:07,971
Bov's a miserable cunt,
but we love him dearly, don't we, boys?

257
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:09,825
- Sometimes.
- Like a fucking brother.

258
00:19:10,057 --> 00:19:12,497
- Matt, grab these two pints for us, will you?
- Sure.

259
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,047
- While you're there, get some peanuts.
- Sure.

260
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:16,472
- Good boy.
- Bov, come on.

261
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,650
He's all right, man.

262
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:19,658
What's with all the fucking babysitting?

263
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,580
You know we had a meet set up.

264
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,900
It's all right, Bov.
He'll stay out of the way.

265
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:27,075
- It's not like we didn't have it last night.
- What?

266
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:28,648
That's not the bloody point.

267
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:31,871
We look like mugs if we set
something up and our fearless leader...

268
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,285
...don't show because he's playing
Pin the Tail on a Fucking Yank.

269
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,303
No, he's right, man. He's got a point.

270
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:41,149
You let me worry about that,
all right, boys?

271
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:44,423
As for the Yank,
he's too modest to tell you...

272
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,919
...but back in the States,
he's an internationally ranked...

273
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:51,064
...double black belt in karate.

274
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:53,911
- Is he fuck? Look at the size of him.
- No, no, no.

275
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,906
<i>Bloody Karate Kid film?
Based on his exploits.</i>

276
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:58,309
- Really?
- Yeah.

277
00:19:58,525 --> 00:19:59,885
- Really?
- Yeah, it's true.

278
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,550
- Fucking straight.
- Bollocks. Bollocks.

279
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,620
- Come on, why not?
- You're lying already.

280
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:07,264
You've been here
fucking five minutes and you're lying.

281
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:28,235
Hurry up, will you.

282
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,720
Hurry up.

283
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,260
He's now officially cockney, the boy is.

284
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:57,081
<i>- Oh, East London
- Is wonderful</i>

285
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:58,535
<i>Is wonderful</i>

286
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:01,194
<i>Oh, East London is wonderful</i>

287
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:04,267
<i>It's full of tits, fanny and West Ham</i>

288
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:06,672
<i>Oh, East London is wonderful</i>

289
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,369
<i>- Oh, East London
- Oh, East London</i>

290
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,603
<i>- Is wonderful
- Is wonderful</i>

291
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:15,251
<i>Hey, Matt, that bollocks you was
talking about earlier about the Karate Kid.</i>

292
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:19,004
- I mean, that... That's horse piss, right?
- Oh, no, no.

293
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:22,361
- No, mate. Shit's Gospel of Paul.
- Really?

294
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:24,935
What was your coach's name?

295
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:27,078
Little chink geezer. What was his name?

296
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:30,086
- In the first one?
- All fucking three of them, for fuck's sake.

297
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:33,091
Why weren't you in the fourth one?
Why'd you let the side down?

298
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:35,773
I remember thinking
why the fuck weren't you in there?

299
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:36,963
The bird was in it.

300
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:40,718
<i>Stick your blue flag up your ass</i>

301
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,096
<i>Up your ass
Up your ass</i>

302
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,863
What was his fucking name, you cunt?
Your mentor, man.

303
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:48,057
- Yeah, his name.
- You owe it all to him.

304
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,228
- I can't remember it.
- Wait, wait. Miyagi.

305
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,435
- Miyagi. Fuck's sake.
- Miyagi.

306
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,859
- Miyagi, Miyagi. Mr.... Mr. Miyagi.
- Mr. Miyagi. He would have...

307
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,509
He was based on a real person.
Based on a real person.

308
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,095
They based him on a real person.
That's fucking out of order, if you ask me.

309
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,324
Did they pay him?

310
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,852
- Of course he got fucking paid.
- Imagine this. Just imagine this situation.

311
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,607
He's getting all...

312
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,627
No, listen, seriously,
imagine the situation.

313
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,553
Someone used you in a fucking film...

314
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,111
...and don't pay you...
Don't take the piss out of me.

315
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,738
I'm talking...
This is real stuff that I'm talking about.

316
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,327
The real Mr. Miyagi!

317
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,792
Listen to this, this is our song.

318
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:31,975
<i>They reach the sky
And like my dreams they fade and die</i>

319
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:38,314
<i>Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere</i>

320
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,974
<i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i>

321
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,320
<i>Pretty bubbles in the air</i>

322
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:49,617
<i>United. United. United.</i>

323
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:53,195
<i>Let's go fucking mental
Let's go fucking mental</i>

324
00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:59,667
<i>Let's go fucking mental
Let's go fucking mental</i>

325
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:04,526
<i>Let's go fucking mental</i>

326
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:13,922
Friend of the family, eh?

327
00:23:14,229 --> 00:23:17,629
Pete might be showing you a bit
of courtesy, you being Shannon's brother.

328
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:19,742
But get it straight.

329
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:23,347
We don't like outsiders.

330
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,640
All right?

331
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:45,632
Cover your ass.

332
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:47,946
Morning, mate.

333
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,170
Hey, Pete, look, I'm gonna head home.
I'm not feeling so hot. Jet lag.

334
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:55,519
Oh, fuck off. You're not missing the game.

335
00:23:55,774 --> 00:23:59,094
You're the one who wanted to learn
about "soccer."

336
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:04,292
<i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i>

337
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:07,976
<i>Pretty bubbles in the air</i>

338
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:12,647
<i>They fly so high
They reach the sky</i>

339
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:16,521
<i>And like my dreams they fade and die</i>

340
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:19,797
<i>Fortune's always hiding</i>

341
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,771
<i>I've looked everywhere</i>

342
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:28,332
<i>I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air</i>

343
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:33,166
<i>United. United. United.</i>

344
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:52,967
<i>Come on, United</i>

345
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:56,531
<i>Come on, United</i>

346
00:25:22,697 --> 00:25:25,777
Look out, mate. We're the most watched
country in the world.

347
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:29,846
Keep your head down.

348
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:37,732
<i>Will the parents of a little John Deale
please contact the nearest steward.</i>

349
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:44,543
<i>Our next three games are Fulham away,
Everton at home, Newcastle United away.</i>

350
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:54,614
Sweet, innit? Come on.

351
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:11,989
Get the fuck out of here.

352
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,739
Come on, United.

353
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:32,766
- Go on, son, fucking have him.
- Forward, team.

354
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,467
In the box, son.

355
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:51,513
What the fuck?

356
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,126
Come on.

357
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:44,233
Dirty northern bastards.

358
00:27:44,471 --> 00:27:46,751
You fucking wanker.
You fucking...

359
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:49,976
Come on, you fucking Zulu cunt.
Come on, I want you, you cunt.

360
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:51,964
Come on, you fucking mug.

361
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:54,556
I don't fucking believe it. He's over there.

362
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:58,736
Look, it's fucking Bovver.
It's fucking Bovver. Look, he's over there.

363
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:01,132
Go on, son.

364
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,789
Yeah. Yes, fucking A.

365
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:10,231
Fuck you.

366
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:18,441
There he is. Oi, Bov.
Fucking quality, son. Fucking quality.

367
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,600
- Stuff of legends.
- Well, you had your hands full, didn't you?

368
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:23,725
Don't worry. It ain't over yet, boys.

369
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:25,812
Word is these twats
are gonna have a pop.

370
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:27,949
- What you heard?
- Oh, the usual.

371
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:31,305
Fucking Zulus. There's like 50 or more
mobbing up the tube right now.

372
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:33,166
It's gonna kick off near East Ham.

373
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:36,001
- Time to go then, boys.
- What are we standing here for?

374
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:37,877
All right, keep going...

375
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:39,231
Let's get them.

376
00:28:39,446 --> 00:28:41,606
- I should head home.
- You know where you're going.

377
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:43,266
- Back to Shan's.
- Bank Station?

378
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:46,731
Yeah, but keep your head down.
Bloody Birmingham lot will be on the tube.

379
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:48,437
That's all right, I'll manage.

380
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:50,544
Fuck, wouldn't he be better in a crèche?

381
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:53,632
Don't get on at East Ham.
If you see trouble, walk the other way.

382
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:55,401
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.

383
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:57,474
Let's go, eh?

384
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:16,351
Get him.

385
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:29,874
- Look, I don't want any trouble.
- A fucking Yank.

386
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,046
Why's a Yank running with the GSE?

387
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:34,973
GSE? I don't know anything about the GSE.
I'm just a tourist.

388
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:39,534
Oh, well, in that case, how's about we
leave you with a proper souvenir?

389
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:41,325
Ever heard of a Chelsea grin?

390
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:42,952
No, come on, please.

391
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,060
Do you take American Express?

392
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:53,002
I bet the Major gave out his shares
of Chelsea grins...

393
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:56,473
...back in the good old days, eh?
Back when the GSE weren't so sloppy...

394
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:58,578
...to leave one of their own behind.

395
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,550
We don't leave our mates behind.

396
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:09,706
Come on.

397
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,536
You horrible bastard.

398
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:15,552
- Look, he's getting away. Go. Come on.
- Don't lose sight of me.

399
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,367
I'll get the van.

400
00:30:20,803 --> 00:30:22,003
Where the fuck's he gone?

401
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,941
Two-foot small.
Where the fuck is he?

402
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,350
I'm getting too old for this shit.

403
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,120
Seriously, I could use a beer
and a lie-down.

404
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,950
- Get it out of first.
- Can't get it out of your mom.

405
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,917
This has to be financed though, right?

406
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,677
Come on, lads, back to the Abbey.

407
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,308
- Whose round is it?
- Whose fucking round do you think?

408
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,540
- You're all supposed to be fucking...
- It's your round, then, Ned.

409
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:51,191
- Oh, shut up, mate.
- It stinks.

410
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,980
- Sit down.
- Who was that?

411
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,530
- Fucking hell.
- Fuck off.

412
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:57,318
Come on, boys.
This is fucking up.

413
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,830
Let's sock the little cunt.

414
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:02,369
<i>Zulu! Zulu! Zulu!</i>

415
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:04,416
What the fuck is that?

416
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:09,717
Well, come on, eh! What the fuck
you standing there for, you cunts?

417
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:11,381
Fuck off, you cunts!

418
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:12,845
What the fuck is that?

419
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:17,194
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- What?

420
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:18,925
- There's 20 guys.
- You don't run.

421
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:22,034
Not when you're with us.
You stand your ground and fight.

422
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:25,285
- Fight? I don't know how to fight.
- Just think of someone you hate.

423
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:26,739
Come on, then.

424
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:37,548
Get up... Get up, you fucking twat!

425
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,561
Come on!

426
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,831
You fucking...

427
00:31:59,198 --> 00:32:00,758
Get off me.

428
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:12,452
<i>GSE! GSE!</i>

429
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:33,963
Come on! Come on!

430
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:36,406
Come on!

431
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:45,330
- Fuck, Pete.
- What do you make of that, then?

432
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,260
What a fucking result, Bovver.

433
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:51,502
You are a fucking maniac, Matt.
Look at me.

434
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:53,073
Fair play, son.

435
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:56,256
There's plenty would've bottled it and run.
You stood your ground.

436
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,990
I'm proud of you. Good.

437
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,460
- Who was he, then?
- Who?

438
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,598
The geezer you was just fighting.

439
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:03,976
Jeremy Van fucking Holden.

440
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:08,706
You done yourself proud. Now we gotta stop
kissing each other's asses. Got to point out.

441
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:10,664
- You see the first punch he threw.
- Yeah.

442
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:12,978
- A little bit on the feminine side.
- A bit gay.

443
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:16,723
Come on. That was my first hit. Come on.

444
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:18,872
Come on, youse all wanna get pinched?

445
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:20,635
His got it, let's push him out.

446
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:41,363
Morning, sunshine.

447
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:42,876
How do you feel?

448
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:45,658
Oh, a little sore.

449
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:50,962
English breakfast, double dose
of aspirin, you'll feel sweet as a nut, mate.

450
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:52,691
Here.

451
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,180
I gotta piss like a racehorse.

452
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,230
Fucking journos. Look at this.

453
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,632
West Ham wins 3-0,
in a blinding performance...

454
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:08,513
...and our little scrap makes
the headline. Bloody muckrakers.

455
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:11,072
So, what is this?

456
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:13,378
Bollocks journo bullshit.

457
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:17,191
- No, no, this, the GSE.
- Lower it, son.

458
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:21,456
What are you guys, like an organized
political movement or something?

459
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:23,443
No, mate. We're a firm.

460
00:34:24,517 --> 00:34:27,597
- You never heard of a firm in the States?
- No.

461
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:32,456
All right. Every football team in Europe's
got a firm. Some have two.

462
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:36,104
Christ. I forgot how clueless
you Yanks are.

463
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:40,082
All you've seen of us is the stadium riots
on TV, innit? Come on.

464
00:34:40,408 --> 00:34:42,528
- Here you go love, two bacon sarnies.
- Thanks.

465
00:34:42,786 --> 00:34:45,266
See, West Ham football is mediocre.

466
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:48,178
But our firm is top notch
and everyone knows it.

467
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:51,499
The GSE. Green Street Elite.

468
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:56,235
Arsenal: Great football,
shit firm, "The Gooners."

469
00:34:56,633 --> 00:35:00,393
Tottenham:
Shit football and a shit firm.

470
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:01,961
"The Yids," they're called.

471
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:05,342
I actually put their main lad through
a phone-box window the other day.

472
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:08,204
- What about Millwall?
- Ah, Millwall.

473
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:11,839
Where to even fucking
begin with Millwall.

474
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,350
Millwall and West Ham firms hate
each other more than any other firms.

475
00:35:15,654 --> 00:35:17,494
Sort of like the Yankees
and the Red Sox.

476
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:20,258
More like the Israelis
and the Palestinians.

477
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:22,895
We haven't played Millwall in ten years.

478
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:27,042
Their top boy's this geezer named
Tommy Hatcher. Horrible old cunt.

479
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,535
Back in the Major's day,
Tommy's son was killed in a scrap.

480
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:34,916
After that, he went completely mental.
Lost the plot.

481
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,791
- Well, who's the Major?
- Ah, the Major.

482
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,655
Quite a legend around here.

483
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,888
He ran the GSE in the
early '90s, when I was coming up.

484
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:46,022
Hardest bastard you ever saw.

485
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,350
They say we kind of lost our way
when he left.

486
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:53,645
But believe me, my boys are bringing
the old GSE reputation right back.

487
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,997
So basically, firms are gangs.

488
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,206
Kind of. But we're a far cry from all
that Bloods-and-Crips bullshit.

489
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:05,106
I mean, shooting a machine gun out
of a moving car at an 8-year-old girl...

490
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,177
...that's just cowardly.

491
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,792
See, we might be into
fighting and all that...

492
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,203
...but it's really about reputation.

493
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:14,823
Humiliating another mob in a row...

494
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:18,214
...or doing something that the other firms
get to hear or talk about.

495
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:22,952
Like a Yank in his first fight,
battering one of Birmingham's main lads.

496
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,231
- Here you are, love, sit down.
- Thank you.

497
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,039
That's all right.

498
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:32,641
Look, Pete, I don't know how to thank you
for what you did for me.

499
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:36,223
Don't give it another thought.
Yesterday was a good result for us.

500
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,930
We had a laugh, we had a few pints,
cheered on the mighty Hammers.

501
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,642
We was completely outnumbered,
but we stuck by our mates...

502
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:46,755
...and we stood our ground.
No matter what happened.

503
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,120
That's what it's all about.

504
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,150
- Look at the fucking state of him.
- Now, don't fucking start, all right?

505
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:07,836
What did I say to you? I said to you
one simple thing: No trouble.

506
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:09,467
It had nothing to do with me.

507
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:13,011
He's walking home. He gets jumped.
Bruv, he's lucky we was there.

508
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,240
Right. You're a real hero,
ain't you, mate?

509
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,570
You saw the whole thing
from your sofa, did you?

510
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:20,345
Tell you what, bruv.
You concentrate on your family...

511
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:24,539
- ...and leave my business to me, all right?
- My family? What is it with you, eh?

512
00:37:24,872 --> 00:37:27,072
Do you want Mom to come
and visit you in the nick?

513
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:29,694
Maybe you want the plot next to Dad.

514
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:32,761
Oh, my God! Matt, what happened?

515
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:34,167
Shannon, I'm fine.

516
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:37,102
Pete, can't you see what you're doing
to this family?

517
00:37:37,636 --> 00:37:40,356
All I see is a scared old man.

518
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,679
- Don't talk to me like...
- Get off him! You got the wrong idea.

519
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:45,457
- Get your hands off me!
- Stop it!

520
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,088
Steve! Leave it, leave it.

521
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:51,076
Get the fuck out. Get out!

522
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:52,838
Lying little shit.

523
00:37:56,489 --> 00:37:58,609
Babe, I'm so sorry.

524
00:38:03,204 --> 00:38:05,764
Well, that weren't the smartest
of moves, mate.

525
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,839
But thanks, yeah.

526
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,195
Fancy a pint?

527
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:14,982
- No.
- Oh, come on.

528
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:17,938
You're the one's that's
gotta buy the bleeding thing.

529
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,930
Get your cash out,
the fat bird's about to sing.

530
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,665
- So you still got your dough? You got it?
- Yeah.

531
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:32,566
Jesus, you two joined
at the fucking hip, or what?

532
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:34,742
Leave it out, Bov. It's getting old.

533
00:38:34,988 --> 00:38:37,188
No, I'm starting to wonder
about you two.

534
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:40,967
I mean, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you was a couple of gay boys.

535
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:46,213
Bov.

536
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,159
We've known each other
a long time, yeah?

537
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:51,459
I trust you more than
any other bloke I know.

538
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:56,443
But you're getting dangerously close
to crossing the line with me.

539
00:38:57,345 --> 00:39:02,145
If you got a problem,
then it's your fucking problem. Not mine.

540
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,500
But if you wanna discuss it further,
we can go outside.

541
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:08,733
Beers, boys.

542
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,980
- Hey, Bov, come on. It's your shot, mate.
- Pete.

543
00:39:12,236 --> 00:39:15,116
- Yeah, come on. Fuck all that.
- Go on with the game, mate.

544
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:18,426
- Pete.
- Watch out.

545
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,779
Everything all right, mate?

546
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:30,841
I can't believe that you came all this way
and you didn't even stay the night.

547
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:33,212
I don't want to mess
anything else up for you.

548
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:35,066
Oh, you didn't mess anything up.

549
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:39,301
- So you and Steve are okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

550
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:42,567
All right, well, I'll call you from Pete's.

551
00:39:47,314 --> 00:39:48,714
Matt.

552
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:51,437
Please don't go.

553
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,633
It's just Steve feels so horrible
about what happened...

554
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:58,904
...and he really wants you
to stay with us, and so do I.

555
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:03,363
- I don't want you to stay with Pete.
- Well, I wanna stay with Pete.

556
00:40:04,957 --> 00:40:07,357
You know Pete and his thug friends
aren't the answer.

557
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,286
What are you talking about?
What answer?

558
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:18,806
It's just, I've been begging you to come
and visit me for the last three years...

559
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:21,941
...and you... You didn't even come
to my wedding...

560
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:25,305
...and you don't know my husband,
and you haven't held your nephew...

561
00:40:25,604 --> 00:40:28,244
...and you show up yesterday
and you're leaving already...

562
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:32,324
Look who's talking. I mean, you ran
to another fucking country after Mom died.

563
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,459
I'm sorry.

564
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:52,027
- Will you come and visit me?
- Yeah, of course.

565
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:03,099
Jeremy Van Holden?

566
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:06,142
Sounds like a cunt.

567
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,573
Mate, if he'd done that to me...

568
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:12,255
...I'd smash seven shades
of shit out of him.

569
00:41:14,114 --> 00:41:17,434
Sounds like these Harvard boys
would slit your throat in your sleep.

570
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,290
What was you studying?
Before this geezer stitched you up?

571
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:25,534
- History.
- History?

572
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:29,129
- I teach history.
- You teach?

573
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:33,001
Yes. Cheeky slag.

574
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,780
History and PE. What? Do you think
the GSE pay the bloody wage?

575
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:39,994
Mate, I'm smart as fuck.

576
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:43,311
Come on, it's brass monkeys out here.

577
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:49,198
Class, today we have an
extraordinarily distinguished guest.

578
00:41:49,483 --> 00:41:51,123
Mr. Buckner is an American...

579
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:55,641
...who went to the finest university
in the United States. Harvard.

580
00:41:56,115 --> 00:41:58,675
But despite his prestigious education...

581
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:01,993
...Mr. Buckner still thinks...

582
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:06,689
...that baseball is better than football.

583
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:10,727
I know, boys. It's an utter sin.

584
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:13,727
Now, it's our job to save
this heathen from his evil ways...

585
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:17,051
...and teach him what really matters
in life. And that is?

586
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:19,387
- Football!
- Exactly.

587
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,319
We're gonna play five-a-side. Mr. Buckner
will be goalie for the away colors.

588
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:28,528
Now, go easy on him, boys.
You know how these Americans bruise.

589
00:42:35,115 --> 00:42:36,355
So how do we keep this fair?

590
00:42:36,574 --> 00:42:38,494
I should let every other ball go through?

591
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:41,225
I wouldn't worry about that, mate.

592
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:45,165
All right. You ready?

593
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:55,511
Go on, son.

594
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:58,629
That's it, that's it.

595
00:42:59,933 --> 00:43:02,613
Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thing of beauty.

596
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:05,085
Yes, yes.

597
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:10,085
Go on, Duncan.

598
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:13,601
Go on, son. Get out of it.
Take it all the way.

599
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:17,045
Have it. Have it in, mate.

600
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:30,602
All right, that's it.

601
00:43:44,812 --> 00:43:46,612
What was that?

602
00:43:53,447 --> 00:43:55,487
Beautiful. Oh, it's such a beauty.

603
00:43:58,243 --> 00:43:59,403
I love it.

604
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:02,508
All right, kids.

605
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:09,272
All right, let's go. Home team 10,
away team 3.

606
00:44:09,672 --> 00:44:12,912
Thanks to some pathetic goalkeeping
from the away keeper.

607
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,017
All right, get yourselves changed,
boys, all right?

608
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:22,154
- Now, that's what I call a real ass-whipping.
- Oh, you set me up.

609
00:44:22,477 --> 00:44:24,877
That was like the Junior Olympic
football team, right?

610
00:44:25,147 --> 00:44:27,427
No, mate, just regular English boys.

611
00:44:27,692 --> 00:44:30,372
We got history next.
Why don't you come say a few words...

612
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:32,493
...about the American War of Independence.

613
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:35,179
They'd get a kick out of hearing it
from a colonial.

614
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:38,011
Well, American history
isn't really my specialty.

615
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:41,189
Mate, they're 10.
Teach them whatever you want.

616
00:44:42,165 --> 00:44:44,885
Well, I sort of have plans
with Shannon this afternoon. So...

617
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:47,167
Fuck you, then.
We'll have a beer later, yeah?

618
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,540
- Yeah, see you at the pub.
- All right, mate.

619
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:52,158
Who are you! Who are you!

620
00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:54,349
These kids. He set me up, man.

621
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:57,572
I'm in there thinking
this is some class of kids.

622
00:44:57,889 --> 00:44:59,289
Shut up.

623
00:45:01,685 --> 00:45:03,485
And they're coming in
fucking everywhere.

624
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:05,249
Oh, come on.

625
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:08,911
You say that?

626
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:13,076
I saved more goals than you say.

627
00:45:13,364 --> 00:45:14,964
- No, no. No.
- No.

628
00:45:52,906 --> 00:45:54,986
- Jesus.
- Look at that fat cunt.

629
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:57,401
You fucking little bastard.

630
00:45:57,869 --> 00:45:59,549
Go on, then. Get the fucking chips in.

631
00:45:59,787 --> 00:46:01,627
Well, I'll be fucked.

632
00:46:01,873 --> 00:46:04,513
If it ain't my old mate Bovver.

633
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:07,748
How you doing, son? All right?

634
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:10,486
I'll say one thing for you.
You got some fucking front...

635
00:46:10,757 --> 00:46:13,037
...showing your face
over this side of the water.

636
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:17,271
There's plenty of people here love to kick
your fucking ass, given half the chance.

637
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:19,946
There's four of them
stood over there.

638
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:22,065
Fucking right, son.

639
00:46:22,772 --> 00:46:24,452
So tell me, what's this I'm hearing...

640
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:27,449
...about your firm gone
all fucking international?

641
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:36,128
Don't you even fucking think
about ignoring me, you little cunt.

642
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:42,259
Now, I said, what's this bollocks I'm hearing
about you having a little Yank on the firm?

643
00:46:45,587 --> 00:46:47,627
It's only temporary.

644
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:50,724
Temporary, eh?

645
00:46:52,427 --> 00:46:54,867
Do you think I might be able
to get a bit of quiet here?

646
00:46:55,137 --> 00:46:58,457
I'm trying to have
a fucking conversation.

647
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:01,569
What's his problem?

648
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,354
So look at you, little Bovver.

649
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:07,489
All grown up now, look.

650
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,459
Where's your other little girl...?

651
00:47:09,695 --> 00:47:11,855
- Petey.
- Petey.

652
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:14,434
She at home, is she?
Trying to get her little toes...

653
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,539
...into the Major's big fucking shoes?

654
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,780
Yeah, I guess he was pretty small
back then, son.

655
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:23,794
Back in your day.

656
00:47:26,754 --> 00:47:28,714
You always did have a bit
of bottle, you.

657
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:34,461
So tell me, Bov.
You come over to Millwall.

658
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:37,848
Did you come alone?

659
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:45,868
Should I wind him up?
If I wind him up...

660
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:48,439
Excuse me a minute, Bov.

661
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:55,985
Hello? I'm Tommy. Tommy Hatcher.

662
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:59,914
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, you know?

663
00:48:00,498 --> 00:48:03,738
Well, now, you see, that's bad.
That's really, really bad.

664
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:07,962
Because now you ain't got no excuse for
not keeping that shit cunt of yours quiet.

665
00:48:08,298 --> 00:48:11,018
Excuse me? George, you can't
let him talk to me like that.

666
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:15,662
George, your bird hasn't stop fucking
rabbiting since I've walked in here.

667
00:48:16,055 --> 00:48:18,575
Now, can I recommend
that you shut her up...

668
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,690
...so I can continue my conversation
with our guest there, Bovver...

669
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:24,944
...of the once-proud GSE firm?

670
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:27,152
You can't tell me... My God!

671
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,480
You see what she's doing?
Does she ever fucking stop?

672
00:48:30,822 --> 00:48:32,502
Ever, fucking, ever?

673
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:35,623
- That's enough!
- That's enough?

674
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:38,312
I'll tell you when it's enough,
son, all right?

675
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:39,899
Look at her. Tommy.

676
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:42,963
The Paki's called the old bill, mate.
Come on, we best fuck off.

677
00:48:43,251 --> 00:48:45,611
Tommy, we best fuck off sharpish, mate.

678
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,468
I'll see you again.

679
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:52,441
Soon, Bov.

680
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:27,197
I don't reckon I'll be back
till tomorrow night.

681
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,866
Be gentle with her, and remember...

682
00:49:30,174 --> 00:49:32,534
- ...left side.
- Left side. Right.

683
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:41,636
- You seem nervous.
- Nervous? Fuck off.

684
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,658
What's on your mind, then?

685
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:47,178
Just two little words keep
every Hammer in England up all night.

686
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,884
United. Away.

687
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:50,432
- Oi, oi.
- All right, boys.

688
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,255
Aye, aye.

689
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:55,715
- All right, mate. You all right?
- Yeah, all right, big man.

690
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:57,195
- How's it going?
- Good.

691
00:49:57,413 --> 00:49:59,253
Hello, Matt.

692
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:03,409
- Where's Bovver?
- Fuck knows.

693
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:06,509
He's been a pain in the ass all week.
Must have PMS.

694
00:50:06,797 --> 00:50:10,957
Pre-match stress. Guy's being a right cunt
at the minute, isn't he?

695
00:50:11,302 --> 00:50:14,382
- Come on, Pete, the train's in five minutes.
- Yeah, hang on.

696
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:21,357
His fucking phone is off. I can't believe
he's gonna pull a runner for United away.

697
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:25,848
They're gonna be gunning for you too. After
the job you pulled on their top boy last year.

698
00:50:26,736 --> 00:50:28,496
What happened last year?

699
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:32,605
- I may have gone a bit over the top.
- Yeah, just a bit?

700
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:36,076
- Where's Dave? You heard from him?
- Have you?

701
00:50:36,372 --> 00:50:39,892
Oh, everything's just falling
right into place, innit?

702
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:42,154
I'll go.

703
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:44,478
- No, mate.
- What?

704
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:47,232
I'll go. You can't just go up there
with Ike and Swill.

705
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:50,307
No offense, mate, but we can't take
passengers on this trip.

706
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:52,353
Go on, piss off. Give you a bell later.

707
00:50:52,637 --> 00:50:55,117
So how many Reds do you reckon
we're gonna tear up today?

708
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:57,592
Fuck knows. Enough.

709
00:50:57,851 --> 00:51:00,451
- Catch it.
- How's that?

710
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:06,385
<i>The 2:55 train to Manchester Express
will be approaching...</i>

711
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,790
- All right, lads. Bovver.
- Sweet, mate.

712
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:14,482
I thought we agreed to meet
in the car park.

713
00:51:14,743 --> 00:51:16,503
Decided to wait here.

714
00:51:16,745 --> 00:51:19,305
Look, Bov, you wanna play the wanker,
that's fine with me.

715
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:22,741
But leave it out till we got today
out of the way, all right?

716
00:51:23,669 --> 00:51:25,869
You all right, mate?
Keith. Come on, boys.

717
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,370
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Let's have it.

718
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,940
No, I'm not lending you
any more money.

719
00:51:36,183 --> 00:51:39,263
- I don't owe you any money.
- For fuck's sake, come on, play the game.

720
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:42,641
- You never paid me for the last time.
- You taking the piss or what?

721
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:48,765
What are you doing here, Matt?

722
00:51:48,987 --> 00:51:52,307
- I thought it was just the three of you.
- Oh, isn't that sweet?

723
00:51:52,617 --> 00:51:55,097
This what...?
This your proper planning, eh?

724
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:58,310
I ain't going in with that fucking mug.

725
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:00,645
- Sit down, mate.
- Come on, mate.

726
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,555
Hello, mate.

727
00:52:03,211 --> 00:52:05,171
- Who's calling what?
- I ain't got any money.

728
00:52:08,674 --> 00:52:10,834
- He's here now...
- Fucking hell.

729
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:17,649
No, I don't. Think of any footballer.

730
00:52:17,893 --> 00:52:20,453
- Think of any other fucking footballer.
- Robbie Fowler.

731
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:22,608
- He's not, not really.
- He looks like...

732
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:23,816
Dave, where are you?

733
00:52:24,024 --> 00:52:25,544
<i>- Sorry I missed you.
- Plane late?</i>

734
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:27,058
The flight was an hour late.

735
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:28,398
<i>- Fly faster.
- I'm here.</i>

736
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:29,936
What, Manchester?

737
00:52:30,157 --> 00:52:31,437
Yeah. But...

738
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:35,106
There's like 40 of them waiting here,
all getting very fucking excited.

739
00:52:35,411 --> 00:52:38,651
<i>- So have a listen.
- United! United!</i>

740
00:52:38,957 --> 00:52:40,597
Oi, Bov.

741
00:52:43,546 --> 00:52:45,706
- Fuck.
- Do you hear that?

742
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:48,485
<i>- Yeah, mate.
- They're waiting here for you.</i>

743
00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:51,079
Don't roll into Manchester.
Do you hear me?

744
00:52:51,346 --> 00:52:53,826
<i>- All right, nice one.
- All right, laters.</i>

745
00:52:55,016 --> 00:52:57,216
We are fucked.

746
00:52:58,018 --> 00:53:00,618
- What's happening?
- They're waiting for us at the station.

747
00:53:00,896 --> 00:53:02,456
What, they know we're on here?

748
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,490
Yeah, must have had
a scout watching us.

749
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:06,774
- How many?
- Forty, fifty.

750
00:53:07,529 --> 00:53:10,529
- Can't we get off at the next station?
- This is the express train.

751
00:53:10,823 --> 00:53:13,903
- Don't stop till Manchester.
- Is that right, bruv?

752
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:22,673
Come on. Come on, boys. If we don't
show up now, they'll claim a result.

753
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:26,405
- Fuck that. We got to get to that station.
- Are you insane? We just got away.

754
00:53:26,715 --> 00:53:28,675
Shut the fuck up.
You shouldn't even be here.

755
00:53:28,927 --> 00:53:31,527
This is what it's all about.
It's what we fucking live for.

756
00:53:31,805 --> 00:53:33,685
- Fuck him.
- All right, here's the plan.

757
00:53:33,932 --> 00:53:37,372
Ike, call Dave, tell him what's happening.
It's about 12 miles to Manchester.

758
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:39,448
We need a couple of cabs immediately.

759
00:53:42,191 --> 00:53:45,231
Fuck! Where's all the fucking cabs?

760
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:51,961
Pete, I got an idea.

761
00:53:53,368 --> 00:53:55,248
- I told you to shut up.
- Fuck you, Bovver.

762
00:53:55,495 --> 00:53:57,135
- You what?
- Cut it...

763
00:53:57,414 --> 00:54:00,054
Fucking cut it out! What is it?

764
00:54:00,418 --> 00:54:02,938
<i>Who the fuck are Man United?</i>

765
00:54:03,254 --> 00:54:05,694
<i>Who the fuck are Man United?</i>

766
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:09,765
<i>MP, this is MM5 in the vicinity
of the last report, responding.</i>

767
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:14,554
Where the fuck are these cunts? That train
should have been here 10 minutes ago.

768
00:54:14,934 --> 00:54:18,174
They'll be here soon enough.
There's no way off that train. Stay sharp.

769
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:21,558
And remember, Nigel gets that
Dunham cunt all to himself.

770
00:54:21,856 --> 00:54:24,296
- That's right.
- Nice one.

771
00:54:28,905 --> 00:54:32,265
- What the fuck do you want?
- Sorry, we're with Paramount Pictures...

772
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:35,179
...shooting the Hugh Grant film.
We gotta get this through.

773
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:37,575
Hugh Grant film?
Any decent women in it?

774
00:54:38,082 --> 00:54:41,562
- Cameron Diaz, I think.
- I hope so. She's fit as fuck.

775
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,438
- All right, lads, let this come through.
- Thanks.

776
00:54:49,135 --> 00:54:51,295
Give me 30 seconds,
then I get the fuck out.

777
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:55,874
<i>Where's your famous, Where's your famous?
Where's your famous GSE?</i>

778
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:59,626
<i>Where's your famous GSE?</i>

779
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:08,188
<i>There's your famous,
There's your famous GSE</i>

780
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:11,271
<i>There's your famous GSE</i>

781
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:25,169
<i>We could have died that day
in Manchester.</i>

782
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:27,924
<i>Everybody knew it. But we didn't.</i>

783
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:30,636
<i>Ike said later that the story
traveled across England...</i>

784
00:56:30,908 --> 00:56:35,788
<i>...faster than the death of Lady Di.
The GSE were finally back.</i>

785
00:56:36,457 --> 00:56:39,177
<i>Suddenly I was part of the firm
with the best rep in London.</i>

786
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:41,499
- The old guard.
- The old guard.

787
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,643
<i>People around town had heard of me.</i>

788
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:47,443
<i>They would hear my accent
and say, "So you're the Yank."</i>

789
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:50,006
<i>Till I die</i>

790
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:56,631
<i>United! United!</i>

791
00:56:57,311 --> 00:56:58,711
<i>You know the best part?</i>

792
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:01,299
<i>It isn't knowing that your friends
have your back.</i>

793
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:04,289
<i>It's knowing that you
have your friend's back.</i>

794
00:57:14,162 --> 00:57:15,362
They're on me.

795
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,860
<i>I'd never lived closer to danger.</i>

796
00:57:18,124 --> 00:57:20,124
<i>But I'd never felt safer.</i>

797
00:57:20,376 --> 00:57:22,256
<i>I'd never felt more confident...</i>

798
00:57:22,504 --> 00:57:24,944
<i>...and people could spot it
from a mile away.</i>

799
00:57:26,383 --> 00:57:29,863
<i>And as for this, the violence...</i>

800
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:32,819
<i>...I gotta be honest. It grew on me.</i>

801
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,800
<i>Once you've taken a few punches
and realize you're not made of glass...</i>

802
00:57:40,149 --> 00:57:44,149
<i>...you don't feel alive unless you're
pushing yourself as far as you can go.</i>

803
00:57:54,662 --> 00:57:56,502
So, what couldn't you tell me...?

804
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:03,812
I had to find out from your sister
that you're expelled?

805
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,100
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did. Your machine answered.

806
00:58:08,387 --> 00:58:09,707
You could have left a message.

807
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:13,634
Well, I'm tired of having
a relationship with your voice mail.

808
00:58:14,684 --> 00:58:16,644
You know what? I don't need this.

809
00:58:16,895 --> 00:58:19,455
Hey, Matt. Matt, come...

810
00:58:19,898 --> 00:58:22,898
Hey, come on. Shannon says
you were set up. Is that true?

811
00:58:23,192 --> 00:58:24,992
- Yes.
- Well, then why didn't you find me?

812
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:27,997
Why didn't I find you?
What's your fucking point?

813
00:58:28,282 --> 00:58:30,162
My point is, this doesn't look good, Matt.

814
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:33,249
You say that you're set up.
You don't even contact your father?

815
00:58:33,537 --> 00:58:36,017
We could have fought this together
if you were innocent.

816
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:38,171
- If I were innocent?
- If you're innocent...

817
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:41,018
- ...why didn't you ask for help?
- You think I'm a dealer?

818
00:58:41,296 --> 00:58:43,456
- Obviously, I don't know.
- But what do you think?

819
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:46,994
- I don't know.
- Well, that's why I didn't find you.

820
00:58:47,302 --> 00:58:51,062
Of course you don't know what to think.
You don't really know anything about me.

821
00:58:54,602 --> 00:58:57,562
So you... You came to England?

822
00:58:57,895 --> 00:59:00,855
- Yeah.
- Okay, what now, Matt? What's the plan?

823
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,670
- What do you really want?
- Come on, it's just a question.

824
00:59:03,945 --> 00:59:07,745
Listen, Carl. Do you really expect
me to unburden myself to you?

825
00:59:08,074 --> 00:59:11,514
You just show up and decide
you're the dad again?

826
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:20,562
<i>Look, I... I have to go to
the London Times.</i>

827
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,120
- You're unbelievable. You know that?
- Just someone I'd like you to meet.

828
00:59:24,424 --> 00:59:27,944
I'm not 5 years old anymore. It takes
a little bit more to manipulate me.

829
00:59:28,596 --> 00:59:30,916
<i>Just an old friend from
my Tribune days. I thought...</i>

830
00:59:31,181 --> 00:59:34,301
<i>You thought all it takes is a handshake
from the editor of the Times...</i>

831
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:36,521
...and I'll have my old life back?

832
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:44,169
It's just a free lunch.

833
00:59:54,122 --> 00:59:57,762
<i>Welcome to the quarterfinal draw
for the Football Association Cup.</i>

834
00:59:58,168 --> 01:00:01,808
<i>The oldest and most prestigious
tournament in world club football.</i>

835
01:00:02,507 --> 01:00:06,107
<i>Fortunately, today, we have with us the
West Ham legend, Mr. Frank McAvennie...</i>

836
01:00:06,427 --> 01:00:08,827
<i>...and chairman for our sponsors,
Mr. Phil Peters.</i>

837
01:00:09,805 --> 01:00:13,405
<i>As usual, the home team
will be drawn first. Frank?</i>

838
01:00:15,603 --> 01:00:18,123
<i>- Number two.
- Number two.</i>

839
01:00:18,397 --> 01:00:22,117
<i>- Cardiff City will play...
- Number three.</i>

840
01:00:22,443 --> 01:00:24,563
<i>- Number three, Liverpool.
- Yes.</i>

841
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:27,816
<i>Number seven.</i>

842
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:32,790
<i>- Number seven, Sunderland, will play...
- Number six.</i>

843
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,480
<i>Number six, Newcastle United.
Bit of a northeast derby.</i>

844
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:41,572
<i>- Number eight.
- Number eight, West Ham United...</i>

845
01:00:42,883 --> 01:00:44,763
<i>...will play...</i>

846
01:00:45,343 --> 01:00:48,583
<i>- ...number five, Millwall.
- Fucking yes!</i>

847
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:50,489
Yes!

848
01:00:50,723 --> 01:00:53,403
- Yes!
- Come on, you Lions!

849
01:00:55,645 --> 01:00:56,805
Fucking nice.

850
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:02,043
Bov, mate, we got them, mate.

851
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,480
Oi, bruv, this is gonna go off.

852
01:01:07,408 --> 01:01:09,768
<i>You're not gonna believe
who I've seen walk into the Times.</i>

853
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,434
What? Who?

854
01:01:11,828 --> 01:01:13,668
Our little Yank mate.

855
01:01:15,498 --> 01:01:16,938
I fucking knew it.

856
01:01:17,168 --> 01:01:19,608
I knew there was something
dodgy about that little cunt.

857
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:22,058
Yeah, mate, he's sly.

858
01:01:22,423 --> 01:01:24,663
<i>Here, I'll tell you what.
Pick me up after work.</i>

859
01:01:24,924 --> 01:01:26,884
All right. I'll see you
after work. Sweet.

860
01:01:27,301 --> 01:01:29,421
You know your sister's
worried sick about you.

861
01:01:29,722 --> 01:01:32,202
She says you're running around
with some kind of gang.

862
01:01:32,476 --> 01:01:35,276
It's not a gang, Dad.
They're my friends.

863
01:01:36,562 --> 01:01:38,322
Well, are you at least writing about it?

864
01:01:38,564 --> 01:01:41,084
Am I writing about it? No.

865
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:44,722
Hey, Matt, listen.
I want you to come home with me.

866
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:47,181
- What?
- No, look...

867
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,290
...you may not trust me as your father,
but as a journalist...

868
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:52,818
...I'm telling you your reputation
is all you have.

869
01:01:53,081 --> 01:01:55,881
You've gotta get back to Harvard.
You gotta clear your name.

870
01:01:57,753 --> 01:01:59,553
We can... We can fight it together.

871
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:01,355
Oh, forget it, Dad.

872
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:03,729
I'm not going home.

873
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:05,667
Jesus.

874
01:02:08,513 --> 01:02:10,073
Look...

875
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,610
...if it makes you feel better...

876
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:15,023
...I am keeping a journal.

877
01:02:15,771 --> 01:02:17,971
It's one thing you taught me
I held onto.

878
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:20,343
I knew that.

879
01:02:20,776 --> 01:02:22,856
I was just making sure.

880
01:02:26,991 --> 01:02:28,231
Hey, Steve.

881
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:31,615
- How you doing? Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

882
01:02:31,912 --> 01:02:33,072
- Matt.
- Hey.

883
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,530
I'm gonna get changed.
What time's your flight?

884
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:39,511
You take your time. My cab will be here
in about half an hour. So...

885
01:02:39,836 --> 01:02:42,316
I have to say farewell
to my grandson anyway.

886
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,062
I gotta take off, Dad.

887
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,852
Okay, Matt.

888
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,100
Look, I know things have not been...

889
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,140
Great to see you.

890
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,749
- How you doing?
- Good.

891
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:13,101
So you'll be celebrating the draw
with the lads, then?

892
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,973
The draw. Wait, who did we get?

893
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:17,807
- You mean you don't know?
- No.

894
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:21,944
- Oh, come on, Steve. Who?
- Millwall.

895
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,315
At home.

896
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,914
Hello. Hello.

897
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:35,565
Don't we want to play?

898
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,904
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey.

899
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,871
You okay?

900
01:03:44,531 --> 01:03:47,531
Yeah, I was just watching my dad
playing with Ben.

901
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,680
He's already a better grandfather
than he ever was a dad.

902
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:55,218
You know, he seems
like a decent bloke now...

903
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:57,987
...for a bloody journo.

904
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:05,888
So he was an asshole
when you were growing up.

905
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:09,510
I guess that's why neither of you
joined the old man's racket.

906
01:04:09,806 --> 01:04:11,206
What do you mean?

907
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:14,634
You know, following in his footsteps.

908
01:04:14,937 --> 01:04:16,737
What are you talking about? Matt did.

909
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,540
- What do you mean?
- Matt was always a little more fascinated...

910
01:04:20,901 --> 01:04:23,821
...with our absentee father than I was.

911
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:28,579
Shannon, what do you mean, "Matt did"?

912
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:33,035
That's what Matt studied at Harvard.
He was a journalism major.

913
01:04:33,374 --> 01:04:37,614
I just really hope that he gets back to it.

914
01:04:37,962 --> 01:04:40,642
You know, once he gets
your brother out of his system.

915
01:04:50,308 --> 01:04:53,508
So he's a Yank and an undercover journo.

916
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,903
Looks like we'll have to give
the boy two funerals.

917
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:10,831
<i>We hate Millwall
We hate Millwall</i>

918
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,679
<i>We hate Millwall
We hate Millwall</i>

919
01:05:12,956 --> 01:05:15,716
<i>We are the Millwall haters
We hate Millwall</i>

920
01:05:16,001 --> 01:05:18,001
<i>We hate Millwall
We hate Millwall</i>

921
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:19,734
Steve, what are you doing here?

922
01:05:19,964 --> 01:05:21,724
I want a word with you outside.

923
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:25,125
- What happened? Is Shannon okay?
- Yeah, Shannon's fine.

924
01:05:25,428 --> 01:05:27,868
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Steve Dunham just walked in.

925
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:30,299
Why didn't you tell me
you're doing journalism?

926
01:05:30,558 --> 01:05:32,558
I'm not. I quit.
What difference does it make?

927
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:36,010
Well, listen, mate, to some people, yeah,
it makes a huge difference.

928
01:05:36,314 --> 01:05:38,554
Well, what would you know about that?

929
01:05:39,444 --> 01:05:41,084
Listen to me. I like you...

930
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:43,519
...but you have no idea
what you're getting into.

931
01:05:43,779 --> 01:05:46,979
Now, I've got to tell my brother
that his new best mate is a journalist.

932
01:05:47,285 --> 01:05:49,445
So me and you are going outside now.

933
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:52,677
A toast.

934
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,840
Stevie Dunham...

935
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:59,670
...back in the Abbey after
all these years.

936
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:03,652
Welcome home, Major.

937
01:06:03,886 --> 01:06:06,086
- The Major.
- The Major.

938
01:06:06,346 --> 01:06:10,186
<i>Major, Major, Major</i>

939
01:06:10,517 --> 01:06:13,077
<i>GSE, GSE, GSE</i>

940
01:06:13,312 --> 01:06:15,592
<i>GSE, GSE, GSE</i>

941
01:06:23,196 --> 01:06:25,196
All right, hang on.

942
01:06:32,206 --> 01:06:34,486
All right, boys.
What are you lot doing here?

943
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,990
- The Yank here?
- No.

944
01:06:36,211 --> 01:06:39,451
- He's a fucking undercover journo.
- What?

945
01:06:40,507 --> 01:06:41,987
No, bollocks.

946
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:46,176
<i>Straight, mate. I see him down the Times
with all the other journalists, shaking hands.</i>

947
01:06:46,512 --> 01:06:49,512
- I mean, proper pally. What's all that about?
- Think about it.

948
01:06:49,851 --> 01:06:52,931
Drops in out of nowhere.
Never been in a scrap in his life.

949
01:06:53,229 --> 01:06:56,909
Snugs in nice and tight
with a top boy of the firm.

950
01:06:57,232 --> 01:07:00,552
<i>For fuck's sake, Pete,
what else was he doing at the Times?</i>

951
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:03,371
No, that means fuck all.

952
01:07:03,615 --> 01:07:05,815
Could've been any one of 100 reasons
he was there.

953
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:09,356
Yeah, well, this time I'd like to make sure
of that myself.

954
01:07:09,663 --> 01:07:10,943
You sure of this, Bov?

955
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:14,564
Because if you're coming in here like this,
you fucking well better be.

956
01:07:15,294 --> 01:07:17,134
Yeah, watch your back, son.

957
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:28,842
What, this his, is it?

958
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:30,557
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

959
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:33,459
What the fuck is this?

960
01:07:35,648 --> 01:07:38,008
Here, Keith, you know about
all this computer stuff.

961
01:07:38,276 --> 01:07:39,556
Have a look.

962
01:07:45,116 --> 01:07:47,476
- What's this?
- You fuckin...

963
01:07:47,743 --> 01:07:49,143
You fucking cunt.

964
01:07:51,832 --> 01:07:53,152
Here we go.

965
01:07:54,835 --> 01:07:57,955
"First match:
West Ham v. Birmingham. Home.

966
01:07:58,255 --> 01:08:00,895
Pete brought me to
the Brigid Abbey pub on Walsh Road...

967
01:08:01,174 --> 01:08:04,054
...his main hangout,
and introduced me to his gang."

968
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:07,026
Oh, look, we're a fucking gang now.

969
01:08:08,348 --> 01:08:09,588
Here, make it go up.

970
01:08:12,228 --> 01:08:14,508
"Bovver is Pete's thuggish
right-hand man.

971
01:08:15,274 --> 01:08:17,754
Keith is sort of Bovver's enforcer."

972
01:08:18,026 --> 01:08:22,026
- You happy now? We're all in there.
- He didn't say nothing about me.

973
01:08:23,155 --> 01:08:24,395
Wait here.

974
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:26,657
I'll put some clothes on.

975
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:30,959
So you are the Major?

976
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:33,007
I was the Major.

977
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,605
I guess to some I still am.

978
01:08:39,298 --> 01:08:42,618
Now, Terry here was my right-hand man
back in the glory days.

979
01:08:42,927 --> 01:08:44,487
That was a long time ago, mate.

980
01:08:46,681 --> 01:08:48,201
Why'd you get out of it?

981
01:08:50,976 --> 01:08:53,016
I was a crazy bastard back then.

982
01:08:53,272 --> 01:08:54,512
All I fucking cared about...

983
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:57,652
...was my reputation
amongst the firms of England.

984
01:08:57,985 --> 01:09:00,585
I mean, you've heard all the stories
about Millwall, yeah?

985
01:09:02,613 --> 01:09:05,173
Last match I went to
was Millwall, West Ham.

986
01:09:05,493 --> 01:09:07,653
We're talking a good 10 years ago.

987
01:09:07,913 --> 01:09:11,793
I mean, we'd been waiting
for this match all year.

988
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,566
At Millwall. Yeah.

989
01:09:13,834 --> 01:09:16,994
Stepping into their ground.
Completely outnumbered.

990
01:09:17,296 --> 01:09:20,536
We were fucking wired from the start.

991
01:09:20,842 --> 01:09:22,042
Now, Tommy Hatcher...

992
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,580
...he was their main man back then.

993
01:09:25,346 --> 01:09:28,106
He used to bring his 12-year-old boy
to the grounds. Tommy Jr.

994
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:32,630
Always banging on how he brought his kid
up, you know, to be like a little pit bull.

995
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,210
Well, we lost that match.

996
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:39,121
Three-nil.

997
01:09:39,694 --> 01:09:43,174
And those Millwall cunts
started laughing at us.

998
01:09:44,617 --> 01:09:46,897
And I just fucking snapped.

999
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:52,892
I mean, I couldn't let it lie, you know?

1000
01:09:53,711 --> 01:09:56,911
So I assembled all our troops,
and we hunted them down.

1001
01:10:19,446 --> 01:10:22,326
I saw that little lad go down.

1002
01:10:22,615 --> 01:10:25,735
Tommy! No!

1003
01:10:26,075 --> 01:10:31,075
And I saw his skull get crushed
under the boots of the GSE.

1004
01:10:35,754 --> 01:10:38,114
I never went to another match
after that.

1005
01:10:38,423 --> 01:10:42,263
And I left the Major behind.

1006
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:49,330
And that's when I met your sister.

1007
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,460
She was my angel. She really saved me.

1008
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:57,412
Showed me a new life.
Helped me forget all this bollocks.

1009
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,034
And she swore...

1010
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:04,921
...she'd leave me
if I ever returned to it.

1011
01:11:05,369 --> 01:11:06,689
And when it comes back to me...

1012
01:11:06,911 --> 01:11:09,871
...and believe me, mate,
it fucking does, that madness.

1013
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,365
I mean, when I hear, you know, the...

1014
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:16,487
The roar of the stadium on match day, yeah,
all the lads calling me down...

1015
01:11:16,797 --> 01:11:19,637
...to get pissed out of me fucking tree.
When I think of that...

1016
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:21,846
...I think about getting back into it.

1017
01:11:22,386 --> 01:11:25,306
And Shannon and Ben,
they remind me.

1018
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,469
There's more to life than all this.

1019
01:11:31,645 --> 01:11:33,725
Get all those juicy details, mate?

1020
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:37,421
- Writing it all down?
- What?

1021
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:40,334
- You fucking journo cunt!
- Oi!

1022
01:11:41,155 --> 01:11:43,035
Oi! Oi.

1023
01:11:43,282 --> 01:11:45,882
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- He's fucking undercover!

1024
01:11:46,161 --> 01:11:48,881
- Don't tell him nothing!
- I said, are you sure?

1025
01:11:49,164 --> 01:11:51,484
What? You already knew.

1026
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,910
All I know is he studied journalism,
right, at Harvard.

1027
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:56,611
But he's dropped out.

1028
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,760
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.

1029
01:12:00,219 --> 01:12:01,499
That's just a fucking diary.

1030
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:04,719
<i>Ned saw you at the Times
with a couple of journos.</i>

1031
01:12:05,014 --> 01:12:08,094
That was my dad. He's the journalist.
You knew that.

1032
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:11,539
His old man's a fucking journo,
and you knew about it.

1033
01:12:11,814 --> 01:12:14,054
- Look, that don't mean nothing, Bov.
- You what?

1034
01:12:14,316 --> 01:12:16,556
He studies to be a journo.
His old man is a journo.

1035
01:12:16,818 --> 01:12:18,298
What's the fucking difference?

1036
01:12:18,527 --> 01:12:20,327
You let one of them get in with us.

1037
01:12:20,572 --> 01:12:23,052
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You shut the...

1038
01:12:24,201 --> 01:12:26,161
I don't care who he is
or what he's done.

1039
01:12:26,412 --> 01:12:28,572
You don't do someone on the deck.

1040
01:12:30,206 --> 01:12:31,806
What's fucking wrong with you, eh?

1041
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:35,363
He'll bury us all and, what, you just
gonna sit down and watch him do it?

1042
01:12:36,881 --> 01:12:38,241
No.

1043
01:12:38,716 --> 01:12:40,796
No, Steve, you're the Major.

1044
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:42,411
You started this firm.

1045
01:12:42,637 --> 01:12:45,117
I'm speaking for all the boys,
we got the biggest ruck...

1046
01:12:45,389 --> 01:12:49,389
...of our lives coming up and your brother's
too much of a bottle job to lead us.

1047
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:53,540
The GSE is Pete's firm. All right?

1048
01:12:54,274 --> 01:12:55,554
He calls the shots.

1049
01:13:01,573 --> 01:13:02,973
Yeah?

1050
01:13:05,578 --> 01:13:06,898
Well, fuck the lot of you.

1051
01:13:08,872 --> 01:13:10,352
GSE?

1052
01:13:11,752 --> 01:13:13,752
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

1053
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,180
Get yourself cleaned up.

1054
01:13:27,433 --> 01:13:28,913
Tommy.

1055
01:13:30,936 --> 01:13:34,136
This is it, mate. We'll finally get back
at those fucking Hammer cunts.

1056
01:13:37,362 --> 01:13:41,442
<i>Millwall! Millwall! Millwall!</i>

1057
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:46,261
<i>Millwall! Millwall! Millwall!</i>

1058
01:13:46,662 --> 01:13:49,582
<i>Millwall! Millwall!</i>

1059
01:13:49,874 --> 01:13:53,474
- What the fuck's he doing here?
- Martin, sit down, son, sweet.

1060
01:13:54,879 --> 01:13:57,799
- That's it. Do as you're told, you mug.
- Fuck off.

1061
01:13:59,216 --> 01:14:00,696
Bovver.

1062
01:14:01,596 --> 01:14:03,916
You know we're gonna have to stop
meeting like this.

1063
01:14:04,182 --> 01:14:06,102
People are gonna start to talk.

1064
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,975
So, what you doing up so late, anyway,
on a fucking school night?

1065
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:12,071
Shouldn't you be at home
with your pals...

1066
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:14,715
...all shitting at the thought
of us turning you over?

1067
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:17,285
What, did you have a lover's tiff?

1068
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:21,996
Well, what do you want, Bov?

1069
01:14:24,662 --> 01:14:26,702
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.

1070
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:32,276
He's at our boozer now.

1071
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,461
Tommy, you gotta give him the chop.

1072
01:14:34,712 --> 01:14:36,872
He's got them eating
out of the palm of his hand.

1073
01:14:37,132 --> 01:14:39,812
What makes you think I'd want
to sort that out for you, eh?

1074
01:14:42,555 --> 01:14:44,715
Because the Major's there too.

1075
01:14:49,145 --> 01:14:51,185
Stevie Dunham's in there?

1076
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,880
- Oh, thanks, Pete.
- Shut up!

1077
01:15:03,118 --> 01:15:05,998
History student my ass.
Who the fuck are you?

1078
01:15:06,288 --> 01:15:09,208
Look, I'm sorry I lied about
being a history major, but that's it.

1079
01:15:09,499 --> 01:15:12,499
- I'm not a journalist.
- Well, it don't look fucking good, does it?

1080
01:15:12,795 --> 01:15:16,995
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal. I've kept that my entire life.

1081
01:15:17,341 --> 01:15:19,661
<i>Are you working for the Times?</i>

1082
01:15:19,927 --> 01:15:24,087
No. Look, I'm telling you the truth.
You've gotta trust me, Pete.

1083
01:15:35,026 --> 01:15:37,786
Mate, you've put me
right fucking in it.

1084
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:40,918
If I don't convince those boys...

1085
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:45,718
...that the head of their firm was not
just taken by a fucking Yank journo...

1086
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:48,359
...the GSE is done.

1087
01:15:51,502 --> 01:15:52,902
So I'm gonna go out there...

1088
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:55,943
...and I'm gonna tell them
that Bov's got it wrong...

1089
01:15:56,256 --> 01:15:58,296
...and that you're one of us.

1090
01:15:58,842 --> 01:16:02,442
And I had better be fucking right.

1091
01:16:18,406 --> 01:16:19,886
So, Bovver...

1092
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:22,933
...is there anything else
you wanna tell us?

1093
01:16:23,785 --> 01:16:27,145
Listen, Tom, please.
This is how it's gotta go down.

1094
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:31,702
You're the only one going down,
little Bovver.

1095
01:16:32,461 --> 01:16:34,181
Grass.

1096
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:38,187
Fuck.

1097
01:16:38,967 --> 01:16:41,687
This shit with Bovver
could tear this firm apart.

1098
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,980
Mate, I need you.

1099
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,030
Stay with us,
just through Millwall.

1100
01:16:51,147 --> 01:16:53,067
I'm not gonna help you.

1101
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,797
I made a promise
to my wife and kids, all right?

1102
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,470
And I'm sticking to it.

1103
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:02,003
You know, there comes a time...

1104
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:06,324
...when the best reputation you can have
is the one where your family...

1105
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:10,751
- What is it?
- Get down. Get the fuck down.

1106
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:13,098
Hello, boys.

1107
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:17,381
Jesus.

1108
01:17:29,397 --> 01:17:31,837
Pete. Pete, come on, man!

1109
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:36,087
Hello, Terry.

1110
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:39,548
Fuck off!

1111
01:17:43,579 --> 01:17:44,779
Terry.

1112
01:17:46,706 --> 01:17:48,146
Terry.

1113
01:17:48,374 --> 01:17:51,734
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey
after all these years.

1114
01:17:52,045 --> 01:17:54,405
Hello, Tommy.
Tommy, I'm done with all this, mate.

1115
01:17:54,674 --> 01:17:57,514
Retired, did you?
Got yourself a Yank wife, did you?

1116
01:17:57,802 --> 01:17:59,442
Had a son of your own, did you?

1117
01:17:59,677 --> 01:18:00,837
- Listen...
- I had a son once!

1118
01:18:01,053 --> 01:18:02,493
- I'm sorry!
- Do you remember him?

1119
01:18:02,722 --> 01:18:04,162
- You fucking remember?
- I'm sorry!

1120
01:18:04,432 --> 01:18:05,712
It's too late.

1121
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:10,134
- You bastard.
- Ah, fuck.

1122
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:12,401
No, Tommy!

1123
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,109
- You listen to me.
- Tommy...

1124
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:21,168
You die tonight...

1125
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:22,775
...and me and you are even.

1126
01:18:36,049 --> 01:18:38,329
It's done! Let's go!

1127
01:18:52,317 --> 01:18:54,237
Pete! Pete, over here, mate! Quick!

1128
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:56,645
Jesus. The fucking punk.

1129
01:19:08,334 --> 01:19:10,414
Bovver, what the fuck did you do?

1130
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:13,620
Get a fucking car!

1131
01:19:24,643 --> 01:19:27,003
Get him in the fucking...

1132
01:19:32,193 --> 01:19:33,753
Get him the fuck in the car.

1133
01:19:38,323 --> 01:19:40,083
Get in. Go.

1134
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:43,803
Go! Fucking go!
Get out of the way!

1135
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,759
Move! Move!

1136
01:19:58,636 --> 01:20:01,756
Somebody help!
Help us! He's been fucking stabbed!

1137
01:20:02,056 --> 01:20:04,936
- Come on, hurry!
- Get him on the trolley.

1138
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:08,567
- Fucking hurry up!
- Resus.

1139
01:20:08,896 --> 01:20:10,456
Go.

1140
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:14,570
Infuse six units of O-neg.

1141
01:20:40,889 --> 01:20:42,449
What'd he say?

1142
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:44,694
He's hanging on.

1143
01:21:00,242 --> 01:21:01,882
Trusting lads.

1144
01:21:03,495 --> 01:21:07,015
You always said trusting lads
was my problem, Bov.

1145
01:21:08,042 --> 01:21:09,522
I trust lads too much.

1146
01:21:09,794 --> 01:21:11,994
Trust the Yank too much.

1147
01:21:14,508 --> 01:21:16,388
This is how you prove your point?

1148
01:21:18,095 --> 01:21:19,815
Backstabbing me?

1149
01:21:21,098 --> 01:21:25,698
Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher
to kill the Major?

1150
01:21:26,604 --> 01:21:29,204
Kill my fucking brother?

1151
01:21:30,107 --> 01:21:34,347
I'll kill Tommy.
Just say the word, and I'll do it.

1152
01:21:36,113 --> 01:21:38,073
I don't need you for that.

1153
01:21:39,867 --> 01:21:42,747
I don't need you for anything anymore.

1154
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:51,110
Go. Away.

1155
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:55,020
Bruv, please, I fucked up.

1156
01:22:34,258 --> 01:22:36,258
- Shannon. Shannon.
- You asshole. You have to...

1157
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:38,312
Sick! You're so sick!

1158
01:23:26,105 --> 01:23:27,985
I'm so sorry.

1159
01:23:31,902 --> 01:23:33,342
I know.

1160
01:23:49,712 --> 01:23:52,712
The doctor said
that you're gonna be okay.

1161
01:23:53,967 --> 01:23:56,487
He said it's just gonna take
a little time.

1162
01:24:05,102 --> 01:24:07,462
We're leaving tomorrow.

1163
01:24:18,118 --> 01:24:20,198
It's not safe for us here now.

1164
01:24:42,184 --> 01:24:43,624
- You all right, mate?
- How is he?

1165
01:24:43,854 --> 01:24:45,654
He's hanging in.

1166
01:24:46,105 --> 01:24:47,145
So, what now?

1167
01:24:47,773 --> 01:24:49,933
You let Tommy know
I want a straightener.

1168
01:24:50,192 --> 01:24:52,552
- Tomorrow.
- All right.

1169
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,261
We finish this once and for all.

1170
01:24:55,532 --> 01:24:58,492
Somewhere quiet.
Away from old bill.

1171
01:24:58,825 --> 01:25:00,905
Ike, your mate runs security
at Trinity Wharf?

1172
01:25:01,203 --> 01:25:03,483
- Yeah.
- Get hold of him. Set it up.

1173
01:25:03,747 --> 01:25:04,827
Sure.

1174
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:07,742
Come on.

1175
01:25:25,479 --> 01:25:26,999
What's going on?

1176
01:25:27,232 --> 01:25:29,952
Ben and I are on the noon flight
to Boston.

1177
01:25:30,236 --> 01:25:32,876
You can't leave him.
He was trying to protect us.

1178
01:25:33,155 --> 01:25:35,315
- You can't do this to him, Shannon.
- Yes, she can.

1179
01:25:36,449 --> 01:25:38,169
She has to.

1180
01:25:38,743 --> 01:25:40,423
So should you.

1181
01:25:40,662 --> 01:25:42,662
I'm going with you
to that wharf tomorrow.

1182
01:25:43,665 --> 01:25:46,065
Jesus Christ.

1183
01:25:47,253 --> 01:25:48,613
They crash our pub.

1184
01:25:48,837 --> 01:25:51,877
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.

1185
01:25:52,174 --> 01:25:55,054
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.

1186
01:25:55,386 --> 01:25:57,266
Matt, listen to me.

1187
01:25:58,181 --> 01:26:00,101
It's time to go home.

1188
01:26:01,475 --> 01:26:03,915
I don't know where my home is anymore.

1189
01:26:04,728 --> 01:26:06,968
I think we both know where it ain't.

1190
01:26:08,774 --> 01:26:12,414
Mate, this is my fight.
It's my brother in the hospital.

1191
01:26:13,154 --> 01:26:14,834
I'll take care of Tommy.

1192
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,380
Go home, mate.

1193
01:27:07,086 --> 01:27:10,966
<i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i>

1194
01:27:14,008 --> 01:27:17,648
<i>Pretty bubbles in the air</i>

1195
01:27:20,015 --> 01:27:23,015
<i>They fly so high</i>

1196
01:27:23,896 --> 01:27:26,896
<i>They reach the sky</i>

1197
01:27:27,816 --> 01:27:29,776
<i>And like...</i>

1198
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:36,469
You're doing the right thing, Matt.

1199
01:29:38,829 --> 01:29:40,349
Yeah.

1200
01:29:50,299 --> 01:29:53,619
You know that back home,
nobody's gonna care about your rep here.

1201
01:29:53,969 --> 01:29:55,649
You know that, right?

1202
01:30:08,276 --> 01:30:10,156
I'm gonna call a cab.

1203
01:30:22,165 --> 01:30:25,205
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.

1204
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,106
Come on.

1205
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:45,301
<i>This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501,
at Brixton Road.</i>

1206
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,489
<i>Disturbance...</i>

1207
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:05,005
The cab's on its...

1208
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:06,732
...way.

1209
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:09,727
Matt?

1210
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:13,649
Matt?

1211
01:31:17,725 --> 01:31:19,325
Matt?

1212
01:34:52,866 --> 01:34:56,186
Now, at least one of you Dunham cunts
are gonna pay for my fucking boy.

1213
01:35:11,887 --> 01:35:14,847
Me old mate, Bovver.
Never could turn down a good scrap.

1214
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,300
You know me, bruv.

1215
01:35:17,893 --> 01:35:19,333
Get him up.

1216
01:35:34,077 --> 01:35:35,717
Holy shit.

1217
01:35:35,954 --> 01:35:37,074
Shannon!

1218
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:38,569
Shannon, stop!

1219
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:40,230
Shannon, over here!

1220
01:35:44,837 --> 01:35:48,797
Matt, don't be a fucking idiot!
Get her out of here!

1221
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:51,151
Shannon, stop!

1222
01:35:51,387 --> 01:35:53,307
- Matt!
- Shannon, stop!

1223
01:35:53,555 --> 01:35:56,035
- Pete, what're you doing?
- Fucking hell, Tommy.

1224
01:35:56,308 --> 01:35:57,428
It's Steve Dunham's wife.

1225
01:35:57,644 --> 01:36:00,604
If Tommy reaches that car,
do you know what he'll do to her?

1226
01:36:00,898 --> 01:36:02,418
He's a fucking animal.

1227
01:36:02,649 --> 01:36:04,129
Hello, love.

1228
01:36:05,067 --> 01:36:06,267
Matt!

1229
01:36:07,486 --> 01:36:09,246
Come on, let me in the fucking car!

1230
01:36:09,488 --> 01:36:12,408
Let me in, you slag!
I'll smash this fucking window in!

1231
01:36:12,742 --> 01:36:14,542
I'll smash this fucking window!

1232
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:18,799
- Are you okay? Is Ben okay?
- Yeah. Matt!

1233
01:36:23,878 --> 01:36:25,998
You're gonna get it now,
you little Yank.

1234
01:36:28,007 --> 01:36:30,327
Bov, you wanna make up
for what you've done?

1235
01:36:30,594 --> 01:36:32,314
Get my brother's family out of here.

1236
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:48,641
Tommy!

1237
01:36:48,863 --> 01:36:50,863
Don't you want to finish me off, then?

1238
01:36:51,117 --> 01:36:52,837
You're already finished, little Petey.

1239
01:36:53,117 --> 01:36:55,837
The NTO will take care of you
in a minute, you mug.

1240
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,880
We didn't kill your son, Tommy!

1241
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,224
You did!

1242
01:37:00,459 --> 01:37:02,619
You should have protected him, mate!

1243
01:37:02,879 --> 01:37:04,479
He was your son!

1244
01:37:05,964 --> 01:37:09,004
- Don't you talk about my fucking son.
- He was your son, Tommy!

1245
01:37:11,303 --> 01:37:14,903
- Get in the fucking motor! Get in the car!
- Get Pete!

1246
01:37:15,684 --> 01:37:18,124
<i>Only a poor little Hammer!</i>

1247
01:37:18,394 --> 01:37:20,554
<i>His face was all battered and torn!</i>

1248
01:37:21,190 --> 01:37:22,870
<i>He made me feel sick!</i>

1249
01:37:23,149 --> 01:37:24,509
<i>I hit him with a brick!</i>

1250
01:37:24,735 --> 01:37:28,815
<i>Now the cunt's not laughing or singing
No more!</i>

1251
01:37:29,155 --> 01:37:32,035
<i>- He's not laughing or singing...
- No, Tommy, he's had enough!</i>

1252
01:37:35,203 --> 01:37:36,803
I'll get us out of here. Go.

1253
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:38,639
- You can't leave him.
- Pete!

1254
01:37:39,292 --> 01:37:40,252
Pete!

1255
01:37:44,255 --> 01:37:46,775
Fucking help him!

1256
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:11,982
<i>Pete Dunham's life taught me
there's a time to stand your ground.</i>

1257
01:39:12,305 --> 01:39:15,465
<i>His death taught me
there's a time to walk away.</i>

1258
01:39:16,268 --> 01:39:18,708
<i>I would never have
the chance to thank him.</i>

1259
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:22,020
<i>But I could live in a way
that would honor him.</i>

1260
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,280
It's too much.

1261
01:39:55,309 --> 01:39:56,709
Well...

1262
01:39:57,227 --> 01:40:00,067
...congrats on the Epstein
account, Van Holden.

1263
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,560
That should be a nice commish.

1264
01:40:02,817 --> 01:40:06,017
I bet your father's election
had nothing to do with it.

1265
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,680
Fuck you very much, Todd.

1266
01:40:11,741 --> 01:40:14,701
Gentlemen, if you will excuse me...

1267
01:40:14,996 --> 01:40:18,756
...I must partake, once again,
in this restaurant's fine facilities.

1268
01:40:20,335 --> 01:40:22,015
Fucking lucky bastard.

1269
01:41:03,298 --> 01:41:05,338
What the fuck.

1270
01:41:08,093 --> 01:41:10,093
Matt Buckner?

1271
01:41:10,387 --> 01:41:12,107
Is that you?

1272
01:41:14,726 --> 01:41:17,766
Jesus, Matt, you look like shit.

1273
01:41:25,654 --> 01:41:28,054
Hey, Buckner, do you mind?

1274
01:41:28,323 --> 01:41:30,963
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?

1275
01:41:31,244 --> 01:41:34,244
When I took the fall for you at Harvard,
you said you'd hook me up.

1276
01:41:34,538 --> 01:41:36,338
You gotta be kidding me, man.

1277
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:39,801
They were your drugs,
and you said you had more to lose...

1278
01:41:40,085 --> 01:41:42,325
- ...and that you'd hook me up if...
- All right!

1279
01:41:42,589 --> 01:41:45,589
Yes, I said I would hook you up.

1280
01:41:45,926 --> 01:41:47,566
Jesus, Matt, I...

1281
01:41:47,803 --> 01:41:50,003
I'm in a meeting right now.

1282
01:41:50,262 --> 01:41:54,582
Call my office. Talk to Cindy.
She'll make an appointment for you.

1283
01:41:57,145 --> 01:42:01,545
You gotta be joking me,
you spineless shit.

1284
01:42:02,567 --> 01:42:05,767
<i>- That you'd hook me up if...
- All right! Yes, I said I would...</i>

1285
01:42:06,071 --> 01:42:07,791
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, this?

1286
01:42:08,031 --> 01:42:10,351
- It's my ticket back to Harvard.
- Give me that.

1287
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:12,099
I wouldn't do that.

1288
01:42:44,154 --> 01:42:47,154
<i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i>

1289
01:42:47,782 --> 01:42:50,942
<i>Pretty bubbles in the air</i>

1290
01:42:51,244 --> 01:42:55,084
<i>They fly so high
They reach the sky</i>

1291
01:42:55,415 --> 01:42:59,095
<i>And like my dreams
They fade and die</i>

1292
01:42:59,419 --> 01:43:02,579
<i>Fortune's always hiding</i>

1293
01:43:02,881 --> 01:43:05,881
<i>I've looked everywhere</i>

1294
01:43:06,176 --> 01:43:09,176
<i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i>

1295
01:43:09,513 --> 01:43:12,353
<i>Pretty bubbles in the air</i>

1296
01:43:12,642 --> 01:43:14,282
<i>United!</i>

1297
01:43:14,518 --> 01:43:16,718
<i>United!</i>
