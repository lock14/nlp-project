1
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:20,643
Leon St. James
for Anaconda Malt Liquor.

2
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,814
With the delectable combination
of the finest barleys and hops...

3
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,440
...it's the only malt liquor...

4
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,652
...that carries the seal of excellence
from Uncle Sam himself.

5
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:35,326
And when you pop the top,
the panties drop.

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,996
Is that Anaconda Malt Liquor?

7
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:43,292
The only malt liquor to be approved
by the United States government?

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,712
That's right. Anaconda Malt Liquor.

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,018
Anaconda Malt Liquor,
brewed in Piedmont, Georgia.

10
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,884
Gentlemen, every one of you
are the most respected men...

11
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,473
Doing business with me,
you'll find you'll be protected...

12
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:44,895
...and you will be supplied
with as much as you can distribute.

13
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:50,359
However, one of us here
is not who he appears to be.

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,573
Come on, you jive turkeys.

15
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,117
What kind of rundown is this?

16
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,537
Look, man...

17
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:05,498
...I gotta get back to the streets
where I come from, sucker.

18
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,209
Hold it.

19
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:12,423
I told you jive chumps,
I ain't no snitch.

20
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,841
Who said you were?

21
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:34,944
He's dead.

22
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,908
My God, men.

23
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,828
Do you know what this means?

24
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,788
Do you know whose brother...?

25
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:50,836
This ghetto is gonna be turned
upside-down, I tell you, upside-down.

26
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:54,798
The streets are gonna run crimson
with the blood of the men...

27
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,800
...responsible
for his brother's death.

28
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,802
Man I am speaking of
is a veritable one-man army.

29
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,848
And if you get on his bad side,
brother, you're done for.

30
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,308
It's only a matter of time
before he finds out...

31
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,728
...and when he does,
no matter where he is...

32
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:10,146
...get ready, gentlemen,
because hell's a-coming.

33
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:12,691
Coming, coming, coming.

34
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,997
Black Dynamite,
that was the best loving I ever had.

35
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,831
Me too.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,459
That goes triple for me.

37
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,587
Mama, you're gonna waske up
the rest of the bitches.

38
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:39,134
I wanna tell you a story
about a friend I've had.

39
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:42,513
He's a mean motherfucker
and he's super bad.

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,474
So grab on to your seats
and hang on tight...

41
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,686
...while I tell you a story
about Black Dynamite.

42
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,509
Yeah?

43
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,262
Dynamite, baby,
Nipsy still ain't paid up.

44
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,057
Solid. I'm on it, Bee.

45
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,235
Who's there?

46
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,653
I'm looking for Nipsy.

47
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,908
There's no Nipsy here.

48
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,165
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

49
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,834
Where's Nipsy?

50
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,586
Here I am, sucker.

51
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,290
Honeybee,
what's happening, baby?

52
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:36,834
Black Dynamite.
What did you do to Nipsy?

53
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:40,088
Now, word on the street
is that he's gonna be in traction.

54
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,675
You know me. I just talked to him.

55
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,387
Thank you, Black Dynamite.

56
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,096
I'm so happy.

57
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,600
Hey, they mess with you, Mama,
they're messing with me.

58
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,687
Black Dynamite, I wanna thank you
for taking care of us girls...

59
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,314
...while we was down and out
and didn't have no pimp.

60
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,692
Oh, I almost forgot.

61
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,403
Ain't nobody seen Pimpin' Jake
for two days...

62
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,988
...and he ain't been by here
with your money.

63
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,199
- And...
- I knew I forgot something.

64
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,035
Tiny.

65
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,286
Get Pimpin' Jake out of my trunk.

66
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,415
Tell him the rest by Wednesday
or I'll make him stick himself.

67
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,167
I'm sorry. Go on, Bee.

68
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:21,170
They replaced the chain on your
nunchucks and oiled the bearings.

69
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:25,132
They're sitting there on your desk,
next to the dry cleaning.

70
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,860
All right. What's wrong, Honeybee?

71
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:46,862
I've known you too long.

72
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,367
Now, if something's bothering you,
why don't you lay it on me?

73
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:54,036
Black Dynamite,
I got to go to the hospital.

74
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:57,165
It's my little nephew, Bucky.
He OD'd.

75
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,627
Where is Bucky
and what has he had?

76
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,879
It's that new drug on the street.

77
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,882
All the kids are falling prey to it.

78
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,511
What we gonna do,
Black Dynamite?

79
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,889
I know what I'm gonna do.

80
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:15,850
I'm gonna fight.

81
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,894
The only way I know how.

82
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,689
Ever since I was a boy,
all I knew was how to fight.

83
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,483
Fight, fight, fight.

84
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,737
And when I got tired,
I would fight some more.

85
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:30,740
And now that the Man
has got our backs to the wall...

86
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,451
...I ain't gonna let him hurt the kids.

87
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,829
I'm gonna take him down.

88
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,749
I'm gonna take them all down.

89
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,892
Who the hell is interrupting
my kung fu?

90
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,192
- Who the hell is this?
- Black Dynamite, it's your Aunt Billy.

91
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,443
How many times
I told you not to call here...

92
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:50,903
...and interrupt my kung fu?

93
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,490
It's bad news, Dynamite.

94
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,326
It's your only brother, Jimmy.

95
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,828
He's dead, Dynamite.

96
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:00,996
Jimmy's dead.

97
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,211
Scram.

98
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,754
I said split.

99
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,423
Shake the scene, you turkeys.
Get out of my house.

100
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,591
I'll see you all tomorrow.

101
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:15,345
How did it happen, Aunt Billy?

102
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,432
They found him shot full of holes
in an old shipping yard.

103
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,100
Dead as a dog.

104
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,562
Said he had drugs on him.

105
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,565
I guess he was still on that stuff.

106
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:30,025
Now, I thought you promised
your mama on her deathbed...

107
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:33,904
...you wass gonna get him
off that stuff, Black Dynamite.

108
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:36,115
Whoever did this is gonna pay.

109
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,783
I can promise you that.

110
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:40,745
Well, I hope it ain't like
when you promised your mama...

111
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,038
...you wass gonna get him
off of that stuff...

112
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:45,959
...for the rest of his natural life...

113
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:59,639
Black Dynamite,
I want you to promise me...

114
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,600
...that you'll look after your brother...

115
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:08,190
...and make sure
he doesn't end up on drugs...

116
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:10,317
...or dead.

117
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:13,653
I promise.

118
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,116
Jimmy, I am 18-year-old
Black Dynamite...

119
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,577
...and you are my 16... year-old
kid brother...

120
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:24,498
...and you are high
as a kite yet again.

121
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,457
Who gave you the drugs, Jimmy?

122
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,000
Who?

123
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,100
Your mama would turn over
in her grave...

124
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,770
...if she were here to see this.

125
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,106
She loved Jimmy with all her heart.

126
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,818
You promised your mama
on her deathbed...

127
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:57,113
...that you would look after Jimmy.

128
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,783
Now he's dead.

129
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,668
I scoured the crime scene
like you told me to.

130
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,669
Dig what I found.

131
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:19,844
Now, this is some heavy shit.

132
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,219
Freeze, turkeys.

133
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,889
I see you haven't lost your touch,
B.D.

134
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,100
O'Leary?

135
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:14,857
The old "pie on the windowsill" trick.
I can't believe I fell for that.

136
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,611
That was the same trap you used
in Nam to save my ass.

137
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,698
B.D. Took our fatigues
and put them on two dead gooks.

138
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,159
I remember we circled back
and turned the tables.

139
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,995
I guess you forgot about the time
you and Bravo company...

140
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:30,373
...left my black ass for dead, huh?

141
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,667
But I remember.

142
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,128
I remember everything.

143
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,463
I remember Vietnam
like it was yesterday.

144
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:42,552
I remember that village
in Tainan that we cut down.

145
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,513
It was a massacre.

146
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,893
All the dead Chinamen
we left in our tracks.

147
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,897
I remember the faces, the children.

148
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,982
This one child I'll never forget.

149
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:59,860
Poor little bastard was still alive.

150
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:03,030
His little Chinese legs
were blown clean off.

151
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:04,948
Still see his little shins and feet...

152
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,534
...hanging from the ceiling fan
across the hut.

153
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:12,123
He was charred from his head down
to his little Chinese knees.

154
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,210
He tried to get up...

155
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:18,837
...but he fell over when what wass left
of his right leg broke off.

156
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:24,134
As he laid there flat on his face...

157
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:26,471
...he looked up at me.

158
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,432
His little Chinese eyes
burned right into my stomach...

159
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,768
...deep into my soul.

160
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,730
He said something to me
in Chinese, like:

161
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,356
Sounds like some cartoon shit...

162
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:40,610
...but I understood it to be a question
that he was asking me.

163
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,986
And I don't have to know
how to speak Chinese...

164
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,407
...to know what that question was.

165
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,118
"Why, Black Dynamite?

166
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,869
Why?"

167
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,168
We're a long way from Nam.

168
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,378
Look at this place.

169
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,214
It must have an eight-track player
in every room.

170
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:06,260
What's going on today
is a smack problem of epic proportion.

171
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,014
Corruption is running rampant
and we don't know who to trust.

172
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,476
We need you, Black Dynamite,
now more than ever.

173
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:18,815
I know I was the best CIA agent
that the CIA ever had...

174
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:21,317
...but I thought I told you honkies
from the CIA...

175
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,485
...that Black Dynamite
was out of the game.

176
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,740
- You're never out of the game.
- I've known you for a long time.

177
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,159
And there's something
that you're not telling me.

178
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,330
Okay.

179
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,750
We heard about your brother's death.
The last thing we need...

180
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,836
...is you running through the streets
creating a river of blood.

181
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,380
Tell me who did it
and I'll just leave a puddle.

182
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,299
We don't know who killed Jimmy.

183
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,469
But I do know this.

184
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,472
You step out of line, friendship or not,
and I'm gonna take you down.

185
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,767
In case you forgot,
when you left the agency...

186
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,809
...you relinquished
your license to kill.

187
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:57,854
Well, you do what you have to.

188
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,355
Just don't get in my way.

189
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:42,899
Come on, give it up
to Afroditey and the Moonchild.

190
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,485
Give them a nice round of applause,
big round of applause, yeah.

191
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:50,197
Black Dynamite,
you came to see me.

192
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,783
Bitch, no, I gotta go rap a taste
with my man Horn...

193
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:56,245
...but afterwards since I'm here,
maybe I'll throw you one right quick.

194
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,748
Out of sight.

195
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:01,167
I get off in 15 minutes.

196
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,669
You're right about that, sugar.

197
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,254
You're right about that.

198
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,261
Bullhorn, can I get you anything?

199
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:15,682
Yes. I would like some of that ass.

200
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,019
Yes, yes, yes.

201
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:28,110
Man, who dare knock
when I'm planning to plant my...?

202
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,239
Main man Black Dynamite.

203
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:33,115
What it is, Bullhorn?

204
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,783
What you want to eat, man?

205
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:38,495
Sister Betty made some hog maws
and, man, she put her ankle in it.

206
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,292
I ain't here for no food, Horn.

207
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,129
Oh, man.

208
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,088
I can dig it.

209
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:51,592
Sugar, give us a minute.

210
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,143
You know, man...

211
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,312
...I'm really sorry to hear
about what happened to Jimmy.

212
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,482
You know, me and you
been tight for a long time.

213
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,570
- So you know if you need anything...
- Thanks, Horn.

214
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,240
I need to know about the kind of cats
that Jimmy was running with.

215
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,286
You know, he came around here
about a week ago...

216
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:21,788
...with some cats
that I had never seen before.

217
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,790
Man, I mean,
these cats looked mean.

218
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,252
Meaner than two fat motherfuckers
wrestling over pork chops and greens.

219
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,047
Can you dig it?

220
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,468
Yeah. I can dig it.

221
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,933
That little old half-a-player,
Cream Corn, was with them.

222
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,019
You remember Cream Corn.

223
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:50,026
So where is Cream Corn
these days?

224
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:51,527
Yep, that's right.

225
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:52,862
I'm running things.

226
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,951
Cream Corn.
That's why they call me that.

227
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:59,285
Smooth.

228
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:02,079
I got my measure for your pleasure.

229
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,040
Stick with me, baby,
I'll have you farting through silk.

230
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,667
And let a nigga mess with me.

231
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:11,713
I'll jump on him,
all 93 pounds of pure dynamite...

232
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,354
Let me catch my breath,
Black Dynamite.

233
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,064
Shut up, sucker. I need answers.

234
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:13,067
I wanna know who the cats were
that Jimmy was hanging with.

235
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,361
Man, I don't know nothing
but nothing.

236
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:17,613
Okay, all right, all right.

237
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,282
Their leader's name
is Chicago Wind.

238
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,287
They hang out at a place
called the Hip Pocket on Crenshaw.

239
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,288
Now, get me up.

240
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,722
So you must be Black Dynamite.

241
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,978
Cream Corn, you jive mother.

242
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:57,319
Chicago Wind, I presume.

243
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,739
Your presumption is correct, nigga.

244
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,991
If you presume that I killed
your brother then you presume wrong.

245
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,911
Not that it means shit to me.

246
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,455
Either way, shit.

247
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,584
I wish I'd have killed
that nigga myself.

248
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:13,752
Somebody else beat me to it.

249
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,505
Is that so?

250
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,007
Well, Mr. Chicago Wind...

251
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,801
...what do you know about this?

252
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,682
Some heavy shit.

253
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,018
But dig.

254
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:33,522
Let me explain something to you,
supernigga.

255
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,525
I don't answer questions.

256
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,609
I ask them.

257
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,364
Even if I did know who killed
that brother of yours...

258
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,366
...what would make you think
I'm gonna tell you?

259
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,329
Get your black ass out of my joint...

260
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,707
...before we beat you
like a rented mule.

261
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,132
That's right, you jive-ass punk.

262
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,134
Don't be coming to the Hip Pocket
talking that shit, you dig?

263
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:05,596
That's right, nigga.
Don't ever, ever come ba...

264
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:31,307
Go catch Chicago Wind
before he disappears.

265
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:34,309
I'll take care
of this gorilla-eating goon here.

266
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:43,236
Oh, you's a corn-fed fool
with a lot of muscle mass.

267
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:48,490
But it's time for Bullhorn
to get up in that ass.

268
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,498
Motherfucker.

269
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:05,173
Let everybody know
and suckers be warned...

270
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:10,096
...that this is the outcome
when you mess with Bullhorn.

271
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:22,857
Try to catch me now, sucker.

272
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:33,868
Motherfucker.

273
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,878
Now you know why they call me
Chicago Wind, fool.

274
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:48,092
Because I left your ass
blowing in the breeze.

275
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,927
Man, don't you ever, ever...

276
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:05,108
That black son of a bitch,
he killed my best dealer.

277
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:11,490
I want Black Dynamite dead,
and I wasnt him dead now.

278
00:24:11,657 --> 00:24:14,492
Before you support
any of these candidates...

279
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,997
...find out if they're going to rid
our communities...

280
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:20,458
...of the hustlers and pushers.

281
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,961
Or are they gonna destroy all
the programs that help our children...

282
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:29,090
...and give their corporate friends
free reign to exploit our community...

283
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,509
...like Congressman James.

284
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,845
Watch me turn this shit around.

285
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:34,596
Power to the people.

286
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,018
With all due respect
to the young sister here...

287
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,853
...you all know me.

288
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,104
Yes.

289
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:43,855
Now, young lady...

290
00:24:44,023 --> 00:24:47,609
...these fine folks
don't need to be misled.

291
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,819
All they want is a little bit of bread.

292
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,866
And you can't just stick it
to the Man.

293
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,327
You also
got to have yourself a plan.

294
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:04,210
Now, we got to take this
from the jukebox to the ballot box.

295
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,131
We got to go from the poor house
to the White House.

296
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,050
Instead of maligning me...

297
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:16,721
...let's take this land
from sea to shining sea.

298
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,474
Keep the faith, brothers and sisters.

299
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,403
Say, Mama, you're gonna have
to work on your delivery...

300
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:32,822
...if you wanna take on
Congressman James.

301
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,325
The shame is, half these people
don't know what y'all talking about...

302
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:39,119
...but at least they can put his
to a beat.

303
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:41,538
So, what do you do
to make a difference?

304
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:44,375
Do you march? Do you vote?

305
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,792
Oh, let me guess.

306
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,586
You're one of Tom Slick brothers...

307
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:50,673
...think you can get by on good looks,
a wink and a smile, huh?

308
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,842
I don't know about Tom Slick.

309
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,593
But thank you for the compliments.

310
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,636
That's not what I meant.

311
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,763
Not that I think
that you have good look...

312
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,558
I mean, you know these guys
with their...

313
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,854
- Winks and smiles.
- Yeah.

314
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:08,691
What about the smile?

315
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,359
I am smiling.

316
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,762
Right on, right on.

317
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:49,190
Excuse me, brothers.

318
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:51,483
The militants turn, startled.

319
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,692
This is private.

320
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,569
How'd you get in here?

321
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,238
I walked in.

322
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:59,074
So you one of them
sneaky brothers, huh?

323
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:01,326
Or maybe you an undercover pig.

324
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,996
Or maybe you just a federal hit man.

325
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:07,165
If I was,
you cats would already be dead.

326
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,251
Now, let me speak
to the man in charge.

327
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,087
Sarcastically, I'm in charge.

328
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,757
Right on.

329
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,842
If you were in charge...

330
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,761
...the people might as well surrender
to whitey right now...

331
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,597
...because your survival skills
ain't worth a damn.

332
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,892
Black Dynamite.

333
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,269
It has been a long time, my brother.

334
00:27:29,146 --> 00:27:30,605
What it is, Saheed?

335
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:33,317
You know this Uncle Tom?

336
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:35,109
Listen, sucker.

337
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,820
I'm blacker than the ace of spades
and more militant...

338
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,699
...than you and your whole damn army
put together.

339
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,201
And while you're out there...

340
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:44,787
...chanting at rallies
and browbeating politicians...

341
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,498
...I'm taking out any money
front sucker on a humble...

342
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,749
...that gets in my way.

343
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,625
So I'll tell you what.

344
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,087
When your so-called revolution starts,
you call me...

345
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,007
...and I'll be right down front
showing you how it's done...

346
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,468
...but until then,
you need to shut the fuck up...

347
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:01,345
...when grown folks is talking.

348
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,977
I'm sorry.

349
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,439
Yeah, we heard about
what went down at the Hip Pocket.

350
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:14,650
That was righteous.

351
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,859
That was personal, brother.

352
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:21,365
Personal or not, you saved
a lot of brothers and sisters.

353
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:25,035
You need our help, we're here.

354
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,413
I can dig it.

355
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:31,750
What can you tell me about this?

356
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:34,252
Yeah.

357
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,465
I ain't seen one of these in a while.

358
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:44,512
I was gonna fuck him up.

359
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:00,778
There it is.

360
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,990
AR-48.

361
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:05,034
I wish we could get
some shit like this.

362
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,828
That round will go through
a bulletproof vest like it was a pillow.

363
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:11,373
Any idea who would have it?

364
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,960
Whoever it is,
he must work for the Man...

365
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:18,922
...because that right there
is strictly government issue.

366
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,313
You mind telling me
how this was found...

367
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,648
...at the scene
of my brother's death?

368
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,950
Okay, Black Dynamite.

369
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,118
Want me to level with you?

370
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,913
Your brother Jimmy
wasn't a two-bit drug dealer.

371
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,083
- He was one of us.
- What?

372
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,417
He was working undercover.

373
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,921
And he wanted to be just like you.

374
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:07,096
Jimmy, why didn't you tell me?

375
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,058
Vincent Rafelli.

376
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,644
Don of the Carbozi family.

377
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,272
Heads up a shipping company.

378
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,817
We believe he's distributing dope.

379
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:23,444
Jimmy felt that the don
and Congressman James...

380
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,571
...had something up their sleeve.

381
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,782
He didn't quite know what it was.

382
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,951
He died trying to find out.

383
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:34,080
So I don't need to tell you
the importance of this mission.

384
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,165
But I just have one question.

385
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,711
Are you in or are you out?

386
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,172
Because God knows
you're the only one we can trust.

387
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,051
I'm in.

388
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,388
Good.

389
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,143
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

390
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,935
Hope you don't mind.

391
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,646
I took the liberty
of reinstating your license to kill.

392
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,153
You're gonna need this.

393
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,703
Black Dynamite's looking for us.

394
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,372
You said you would handle it.

395
00:31:16,415 --> 00:31:19,835
I'm bringing in
the heavy hitters now.

396
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,009
Somebody broke into
my dead brother Jimmy's apartment.

397
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:23,773
Breathe deeply, baby.

398
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,609
Daddy, you make my heart beat.

399
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:30,196
Yeah, Dr. Dynamite can hear that.

400
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,406
But I think
you're running a temperature.

401
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:37,037
Let me see if I can find
a thermometer for you.

402
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,665
What the...?

403
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,461
I told you urine sample,
Nurse Jenny.

404
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:47,588
Black Dynamite.

405
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,259
I mean, really.

406
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:52,344
You sent her in here
with them titties.

407
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:54,136
What did you expect?

408
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,681
How's my x-ray?

409
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,266
Well, no fragments.

410
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:58,892
In and out.

411
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:00,769
You're lucky, Black Dynamite.

412
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:02,938
Three inches to the left...

413
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:05,606
...and we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

414
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,693
Three inches to the right,
it would've missed my black ass.

415
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,445
Well, you need a new line of work.

416
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,865
This is the second time this year.

417
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,951
I know, I know.

418
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,954
Why do I bother?
There's no helping you.

419
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,958
No, doc, you help me just fine.

420
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,292
See you next time.

421
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:31,549
You hang in there, Leon.
You hear me?

422
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,105
Hey, Mama, what's going down?
That your kid in there?

423
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:46,731
No.

424
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,482
Nephew? Cousin?

425
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,109
I said no.

426
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,403
No relation, he...

427
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,490
He happens to be one of the kids
at the orphanage where I work.

428
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:58,201
He overdosed on smack.
Third one this month.

429
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,996
And why?
What does it matter to you anyway?

430
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:03,498
Whoa, Mama, just trying to help.

431
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,292
Oh, I don't need your kind of help.

432
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,253
Men like you only help
when there's something in it for them.

433
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,672
They can't be bothered.

434
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,967
Too busy chasing their chicks
and their bread and their fancy car.

435
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:16,344
No, Mr. Black Dynamite.

436
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,681
The only help you know
is how to help yourself.

437
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,224
Whoa, Mama, it ain't about me.

438
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,018
It's about that kid in there.

439
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,771
Now do you really want help...

440
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,608
...or are you just trying to prove to the
world you can do it all on your own?

441
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,275
Mama always said:

442
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:34,237
"A helping hand is a helping hand,
clean or dirty."

443
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,199
Guess my hands
ain't clean enough for you.

444
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,577
Wait.

445
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:46,248
These politicians don't give a damn.

446
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:49,251
I mean, look, look at these ads.

447
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,965
Congressman James
made promises to the people.

448
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,342
Then he took away
his drug-awareness programs...

449
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,387
...and allowed his bedfellows
to sell crap to the kids.

450
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,222
He even invested in these products.

451
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,641
Now the dope is everywhere.
It's even...

452
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,266
It's even in the orphanage.

453
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,646
Not the orphanage.

454
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,775
I used to be an orphan.

455
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,152
You ain't got no mommy
and you ain't got no daddy.

456
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,405
You're an orphan.

457
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,617
Orphan, orphan, orphan.

458
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:26,414
No, not the orphans.

459
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,503
I think I need
to show you something.

460
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,425
We've been trying
to reach these children.

461
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,927
But this new smack on the street
is proving too much of a match for us.

462
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,764
The worst thing
about these pushers...

463
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:46,476
...getting these children
addicted to this new smack...

464
00:35:46,643 --> 00:35:50,731
...is that these children are orphans,
and orphans don't have parents.

465
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,608
Ain't nothing in the world
get Black Dynamite more mad...

466
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,362
...than some jive-ass sucker
dealing smack to the kids.

467
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,697
Bobby, stop it.

468
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:01,907
You'll kick soon.

469
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,329
You dealing, brother?

470
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,166
I need my smack, I need it now.

471
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:13,461
Put a few of these honeys on the street
and I'll get you your bread, partner.

472
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,423
I refuse to let this happen to you,
little man.

473
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,469
I will shake this poisonous shit
out of your smacked-up body...

474
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:21,677
...if I have to.

475
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,139
Black Dynamite, stop.
We've tried that, nothing works.

476
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,061
I can't look at these kids no more.

477
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:36,068
This orphanage used to be alive
with laughter, kids playing.

478
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,693
Now look at it, it's sickening.

479
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,864
Whoever's responsible is gonna pay,
if it's the last thing I do.

480
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,949
Black Dynamite,
I wish it was that simple.

481
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,159
But this is much bigger
than you and me.

482
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:46,327
Hey, Little Mama.

483
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:49,164
It may be bigger than you
and it may be bigger than me.

484
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:51,791
But it ain't bigger than you and me.
Can you dig it?

485
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,168
I think so.

486
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,336
I gotta split.

487
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,255
You need me to drop you off
somewhere?

488
00:36:57,422 --> 00:37:00,050
No, I think I'm gonna go down
the street and grab a bite.

489
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:01,842
I'll drive you.

490
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:13,021
Thanks for the ride.

491
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,789
Can I get some hot sauce
for my donut?

492
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,039
Excuse me, lady.

493
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,800
- Oh, my God.
- What is it? What is going on?

494
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:43,802
How did you know?

495
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:47,722
Donuts don't wear alligator shoes.

496
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,206
Damn.

497
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,472
Sorry, Roscoe.

498
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,432
It's cool, man.

499
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,768
Chili and donuts ain't working out
for me no how.

500
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:36,646
Maybe it's time for a change.

501
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,442
What have you gotten me into?

502
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,318
It wasn't me they were after, sugar.

503
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:45,947
You must have pissed off some people
in some pretty high places.

504
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,534
I'm gonna take you somewhere
you'll be safe.

505
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:53,204
Black Dynamite,
you ain't got to worry about Gloria.

506
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:55,456
She gonna be safe up in here.

507
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,626
I been keeping the girls up
on their kung fu like you told me to.

508
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:03,632
Now, they find her up in here,
we will fricassee they honky asses.

509
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,677
You sure about this?
Maybe we should call the police.

510
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:10,889
No, Mama. You can bet
your sweet ass and half a titty...

511
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:14,726
...whoever put that hit on you, already
got the cops in their back pocket.

512
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,769
You be cool, Mama.

513
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,146
Bee here will keep you tight
and out of sight.

514
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,983
I'm gonna shake the tree
from the roots and rake up the fruits...

515
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:26,780
...rip it up out the ground,
find out what's going down.

516
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,574
Don't worry about tomorrow, Mama,
because tonight...

517
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,494
Dynamite's gonna make
everything all right.

518
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,411
Euphoria, shut up.
I know that was you.

519
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:35,664
I ain't even gotta look.

520
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,833
I should send you to Crenshaw Pete
with his hot-ass coat hangers.

521
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,418
Would you like that?

522
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:54,807
Black Dynamite,
I know that we just met...

523
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,351
...but somehow I feel
that I can trust you.

524
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,771
I'll be here waiting
till you come to get me.

525
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,610
Thank you for saving my life.

526
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:08,405
You be cool, Little Mama.

527
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,032
I'll be back before too long.

528
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,925
Order, order, order.

529
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,760
Order, nigga.

530
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,682
The game is at an all-time low.

531
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:42,063
Never in the history of the game
has there been such devastation.

532
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,273
- That's right.
- Yeah.

533
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,943
Tricks running low,
cops pushing harder than ever.

534
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,152
- Yeah.
- That's right.

535
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,155
These little bitches just running wild.

536
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,742
I thought we had
these poop-butt pigs paid off.

537
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,117
- Come to find out.
- Yeah.

538
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,829
They trapping my ho's
every time they hit the track.

539
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,333
I'm spending more bail money
than I'm getting tail money.

540
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,918
Yeah, yeah.
I can dig it, Chocolate, I can dig it.

541
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:07,797
Come on, this has been
my worst physical year ever.

542
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,507
Fiscal, nigga. With a F. Fiscal.

543
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:13,552
Well, it's been the worst one ever.
I can't even afford to get my hair fixed.

544
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,429
Sounds like you're assed out.

545
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:16,889
You know what they say.

546
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,766
The bitch won't sell her ass.

547
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,268
- A pimp will.
- Will.

548
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:22,603
Shut up, Tasty.

549
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,231
I turned you onto the game...

550
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,777
...when you nothing
but a little jailhouse tramp.

551
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,947
Now, listen up.

552
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:38,661
Pimping has been around
since the world started turning.

553
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,791
And it's going to keep right on
turning right along with it...

554
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:47,628
...until this little planet
rotates off its axis...

555
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:54,052
...as a result of its core overheating
and explodes into cosmic dust.

556
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:55,387
Damn.

557
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,514
- Can you dig it?
- It's done, brother.

558
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,139
You know what I'm saying?

559
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:01,809
Now look here.
These times, they come and they go.

560
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:04,353
- Right.
- And if you live long enough...

561
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:07,106
...you'll be around
to see them come again.

562
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:13,153
But what we need to do
is we need to collectivize.

563
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,155
- Yeah.
- Right on, right on.

564
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,949
Now, look here.

565
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:19,119
Listen.

566
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,579
Stop all the bullshit and take a vote.

567
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,666
Yes, O.

568
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,836
All in favor, raise your hand.

569
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,172
Kotex?

570
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,467
- Mo Bitches?
- I can dig it, baby.

571
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,969
Chocolate Giddy-Up?

572
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,512
Chocolate Giddy-Up.

573
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,181
Crenshaw Pete?

574
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:43,016
Captain Kangaroo Pimp?

575
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,730
- Willie?
- I'm with you.

576
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,525
Nigga, even if they don't
knock the broads...

577
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:56,322
...there ain't enough tricks
to go around.

578
00:42:58,032 --> 00:42:59,617
Now, look here.

579
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,161
I don't know about the rest of y'all.

580
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,873
But it looks like I have
to keep selling heroin...

581
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,248
...just to make ends meet.

582
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,543
Then you'll have
a much bigger problem.

583
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,253
Black Dynamite.

584
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,172
What's happening, baby?

585
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:13,505
What it is, Big O?

586
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:17,050
To what do we owe this pleasure?

587
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,221
I just got one thing to lay on you cats
and then I'll split.

588
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,056
That I'm declaring war...

589
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:25,059
...on anybody who sells drugs
in our community.

590
00:43:25,226 --> 00:43:29,481
But, Black Dynamite,
I sell drugs to the community.

591
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,942
Well, be that as it may,
if I catch you...

592
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,235
...I will not consider you
a brother or friend.

593
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:36,905
Now, can you dig it?

594
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,282
Hell no, nigga.

595
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,452
I can't dig it.

596
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,496
- Now who you supposed to be?
- That's Black Dynamite.

597
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,581
I ain't ask you, nigga. Shut up.

598
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,083
I'm gonna tell you like this.

599
00:43:50,251 --> 00:43:53,922
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do.

600
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,925
- Yeah.
- Well, the choice is yours, brother.

601
00:43:58,092 --> 00:44:00,052
But if me and my people
catch you...

602
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,889
...you're gonna have
a lot more to deal with.

603
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:05,474
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Goodbye, Black Dynamite.

604
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,353
Will you stop that?

605
00:44:15,193 --> 00:44:16,318
Hold it right there.

606
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,695
It's me, Black Dynamite.

607
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,449
- What the hell do you wasnt?
- I wanna help you.

608
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,784
Why should I trust you...

609
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,202
...after you dropped dime on me
to Chicago Wind?

610
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,414
Because your brother Jimmy
saved my life.

611
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:31,125
I was supposed to be with him
the night he got killed.

612
00:44:31,751 --> 00:44:34,836
But he called me
and told me to stay at home.

613
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,547
I guess I owe him one.

614
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,929
I'll need a list
of names and locations.

615
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,137
Ain't no thing.

616
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:47,099
Man, everything is gonna be okay.

617
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,643
Bullhorn...

618
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,480
...Cream Corn here says he can
help us find the cats we're looking for.

619
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,398
Now, what do you think?

620
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,985
Man,
I think we should put our ankles in it.

621
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,068
They broke into my home.

622
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,737
They got the ledger.

623
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,905
They got the manifest,
they got everything.

624
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,032
Everything.
Names, dates, schedules.

625
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,659
We even got the shipping routes.

626
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,536
They won't be able to take a shit...

627
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,579
...without us knowing
when or what color.

628
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,416
We cleaned up the streets
and gave them back to the people.

629
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:39,628
Once again, making them a pleasant
place to take an afternoon stroll.

630
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,760
Extra, extra. Hot off the presses.

631
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,429
Black Dynamite
cleans up the street.

632
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,934
It's unbelievable, Black Dynamite.

633
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,103
Everyone looks so happy...

634
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:56,853
...and it's all thanks to you.

635
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:59,190
I'd like to take the credit
but dig, Mama.

636
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,443
There's no I in "revolut..." In "team."

637
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,947
Look, I'm know I'm gonna be rusty,
but I have to try.

638
00:47:07,615 --> 00:47:09,701
Hi, girls. What is your name?

639
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:11,952
I'm Shawanda,
and her name's Brikwilla.

640
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,329
Those are beautiful names.

641
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:16,289
I'm Gloria
and this is Black Dynamite.

642
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,293
My mama said
my daddy's name is Black Dynamite.

643
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,628
So did my mama.

644
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,882
Hush up, little girls.

645
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,342
A lot of cats have that name.

646
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:13,639
Well, that was amazing.

647
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,684
Thank you
for a beautiful day and night.

648
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:23,690
But I think I should be going.

649
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:26,943
I think you'll be safer
if you stay here tonight.

650
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:29,905
Oh, you do, do you?

651
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,034
I hope you don't think you're
gonna get any of this cookie.

652
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,369
Because if I offered you
some of this cookie...

653
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:37,038
...this cookie might kill you.

654
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:39,956
Don't think because
we've been frolicking in the park...

655
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,001
...you got this closed
because it takes...

656
00:48:42,168 --> 00:48:43,543
Yeah, yeah, Mama.

657
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,923
You can hit the sheets or the streets.
It don't make me no never mind.

658
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,384
That's your bag, baby.
You can go or you can come.

659
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,844
Can you dig it?

660
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,128
Yeah.

661
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,336
Black Dynamite.

662
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,422
We read the ledger
and it just don't stop.

663
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,594
There's a trail of paper
that leads all the way to the top.

664
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,387
A big shipment is coming to town...

665
00:50:16,554 --> 00:50:19,181
...and it's right there
where that cracker wrote it down.

666
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,934
Now, we don't know the whens,
but we do know the wheres.

667
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:25,813
And however the fuck the whats,
we'll sure enough be there.

668
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,693
Looks like he's got two warehouses.

669
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,197
One big one,
and one smaller one here.

670
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:38,992
We break into the two units,
we hit the smaller one first...

671
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,621
...then we scale the fence,
enter from the south...

672
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,166
...use an acetylene blowtorch to
breech the warehouse from the back.

673
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,168
That way we avoid the guards.

674
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,713
Man, them honkies gonna be running
for cover when us brothers get...

675
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:53,298
Get... Get...

676
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:58,971
The torch is an issue.

677
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,514
We won't be able to get
an acetylene torch in time.

678
00:51:01,682 --> 00:51:03,476
Think again, brother.

679
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,853
You know somebody that's got one?

680
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,481
I know just the cat.

681
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,916
All right, snowflake.
Where's the dope?

682
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:11,126
Up yours, coon.

683
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,463
It's right over there
in the body bags, jeez.

684
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,014
So how much dope
is in the big warehouse?

685
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:30,021
They're gonna kill me anyway.
I'm not gonna tell you nothing, coon.

686
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,942
Dynamite, I got something
that will make him talk.

687
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,907
I ain't gonna tell you nothing.

688
00:52:43,534 --> 00:52:46,619
Operation Code Kansas.
Can't stop it, too late.

689
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:50,166
Operation Code Kansas
gonna fix all the niggas.

690
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,630
Yeah, you won't be so big
and so bad anymore...

691
00:52:56,797 --> 00:53:00,009
...because Kansas gonna fix you.

692
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,677
Just the niggas.

693
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,389
Just the nig...

694
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,978
Damn, Smoke.

695
00:53:12,146 --> 00:53:14,190
I think you gave him
too much of that shit.

696
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,233
How long till it wears off?

697
00:53:30,831 --> 00:53:31,916
It's malt liquor?

698
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:36,003
It's that new Anaconda Malt Liquor
from the billboards.

699
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,213
It's supposed to give you:

700
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,179
Tastes good too.

701
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,972
I know the drugs
are here somewhere.

702
00:53:47,139 --> 00:53:50,141
We're gonna check every crate
until we find it.

703
00:53:55,856 --> 00:53:57,483
I can't believe it, fellas.

704
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,820
That entire shipment
was just malt liquor.

705
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,530
Don't beat yourself up, Dynamite.

706
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,490
We still kept the 50 keys
we found in that first warehouse...

707
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,159
...from getting on the streets.

708
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,911
I'm gonna go home
and drink the rest of this, man.

709
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,206
Y'all should've grabbed some
of this shit. This shit is incredible.

710
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,713
I tell you, brothers,
it just don't make no damn sense.

711
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,717
The manifest, the shipping log,
the ledgers.

712
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,719
All records are consistent
with that damned beer shipment.

713
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:30,224
If anything else was in there,
it would have to weigh something.

714
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:32,643
They got it out before we got there.

715
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,893
No.

716
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:37,063
Why would they have guards there
if they got the drugs out?

717
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:39,400
No, them crackers
was protecting something.

718
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:43,153
B.D., we checked every single crate,
every stinking bottle.

719
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,239
Man, I'm with you, Dynamite.

720
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,574
That babbling cracker
knew something.

721
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:51,036
What that guard said,
I keep running through my head.

722
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,204
Code Kansas.

723
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,791
"You people
won't be so big anymore."

724
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,751
Code Kansas.

725
00:54:57,918 --> 00:54:59,753
It just don't make no damn sense.

726
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,255
Hey, sweet thing.

727
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:04,425
What don't make no sense is
the service around this motherfucker.

728
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,092
Bitch, do you see us?

729
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:09,637
I'd like two sausage links,
two sausage patties...

730
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,349
...two hot dogs,
split down the middle twice, okay?

731
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:14,059
Baloney, fry that up into a dome.

732
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:16,936
Slice that,
take a spatula, smush fry it.

733
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,438
And one waffle, please.

734
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,940
I can get your waffle...

735
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,358
...but all we got
is the chicken from last night.

736
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,320
Now, I can bring you some of that
if you wasnt some meat.

737
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:28,157
Chicken and waffles?

738
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,824
That's it.

739
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:34,454
Take it easy, brother.
It ain't her fault.

740
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,664
Sorry, sister,
we all just a little uptight.

741
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,251
But if you bring us
some of them good-ass waffles...

742
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:41,461
...everything will be all right.

743
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,965
Man, you guys
ain't had no waffles like these.

744
00:55:45,132 --> 00:55:47,134
These waffles are so good...

745
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,385
...they're like they come
from down South.

746
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,972
These buttery motherfuckers
will melt in your mouth.

747
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:54,974
- Man, you ain't had no waffles...
- Wait.

748
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,603
Bullhorn, what did you just say?

749
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:00,940
You said:

750
00:56:01,106 --> 00:56:03,858
"Melts in your mouth."

751
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,112
Quick.

752
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,657
What else melts in your mouth?

753
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:12,701
- M&M's.
- Exactly.

754
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,496
And not in your hands.

755
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,791
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

756
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,333
And who makes M&M's?

757
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:22,710
Mars Candy Company makes it.

758
00:56:22,878 --> 00:56:24,255
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right.

759
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,173
And Mars is also...

760
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:31,177
- The Roman god of war.
- That's what I'm telling you.

761
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,972
Who is the Greek god of war?

762
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:35,766
- Ares.
- Right on.

763
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:40,896
Now, you take Mars
and spell it backwards, drop the S.

764
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:42,815
- What is it? What did you get?
- R...

765
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,358
Ram. That's right.

766
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:48,862
And ram is the zodialogical sign
for Aries.

767
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,530
- Now dig.
- That right.

768
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:54,367
- Ares's half sister is Athena.
- Now you're getting it.

769
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,288
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Athena, Athens.

770
00:56:57,454 --> 00:57:00,373
Which is the capital of Greece.

771
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:01,833
And as we all know...

772
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:05,295
...zodialogical astronomy
was created by the Greeks in...

773
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,840
785 B.C.

774
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,552
And 785 is the area code of Topeka.
Oh, my God.

775
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:15,806
785 is the area code
to Topeka, Kansas.

776
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,057
Code Kansas.

777
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:21,811
Now you take that,
spell it backwards and drop the S.

778
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,898
Snake doc. Snake doctor, yeah.

779
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,525
- Yes.
- Yeah.

780
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,775
And brothers...

781
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:30,987
...who is the Greek demigod
of medicine...

782
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:34,615
...who believed that snakes' tongues
had mystical healing powers?

783
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,784
Aesculapius, of course.

784
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:40,998
He had a staff with snakes
intertwining all around that bitch.

785
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,166
They called it Aesculapius's staff.

786
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,045
It's a symbol the medical field uses
to this day.

787
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:47,253
I've seen it.

788
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:51,132
Now,
what legend involving snakes...

789
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,344
...is in both Greek and Roman
mythology?

790
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,889
Now, come on.
It involves Aesculapius's own father.

791
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,474
Apollo.

792
00:58:00,684 --> 00:58:01,976
Yeah. Thanks, lady.

793
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:03,186
That's right.

794
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:09,693
Apollo slew the serpent at Delphi
which was a big-ass snake.

795
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,902
That's right.

796
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,280
And what, brothers,
is the biggest snake in the world?

797
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,284
The South American anaconda.

798
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:21,789
- What she said.
- Anaconda Malt Liquor.

799
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:25,626
And what is the slogan
for Anaconda Malt Liquor?

800
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,543
"Anaconda Malt Liquor gives you..."

801
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,670
Gives you what?

802
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,882
And who else is famous for:

803
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:34,635
Little Richard.

804
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,344
- Who?
- Little Richard.

805
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:39,431
So, what they're really saying is...

806
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,811
Anaconda Malt Liquor
gives you Little Richard.

807
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,273
What is another word for Richard?

808
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:54,112
- Gunsmoke. Come on, get up.
- Gunsmoke!

809
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,242
Damn.

810
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:03,329
Anaconda Malt Liquor
gives you a little dick.

811
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,963
Should we kill him?

812
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,092
Man, do you wasnt to live?

813
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,679
I said, do you want to go on?

814
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:33,527
Man, this time these crackers
have gone too far.

815
00:59:35,028 --> 00:59:37,364
- The warehouse.
- The warehouse.

816
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,036
Freeze, you jive-time suckers.

817
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,706
Who's in charge?

818
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,751
Brothers, make these honkies load
this dick-shrinking poison...

819
00:59:49,918 --> 00:59:52,963
...back into the warehouse
so we can burn this mother down.

820
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,047
Waste them if they make a sound.

821
00:59:55,215 --> 00:59:57,842
I'm gonna go inside and find out
who's running this shit.

822
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:02,054
- All right, men, move it.
- Come on, you heard him.

823
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:03,931
Sucker, you drop it right there.

824
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:06,143
- O'Leary?
- That's right.

825
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,603
Go ahead, guys, I got this.

826
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,442
O'Leary, you son of a bitch.
I should have known it was you.

827
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,650
You should have.

828
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:17,528
You were too busy
and trying to lay that orphan mama...

829
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,739
...to not see
what was in front of your face.

830
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,742
You diabolical
dick-shrinking motherfuckers.

831
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,452
You were the leak all the time.

832
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,663
And I bet you were behind
Jimmy's death.

833
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,581
Hey, man,
I was just following orders.

834
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,460
That's what a good soldier does,
follow orders, unlike you.

835
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,920
Everything's gotta be done
the Black Dynamite way.

836
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,255
I gave the order on Jimmy.

837
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:37,423
I gave it to James,
who gave it to the don.

838
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,760
What good's it gonna do you now?

839
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:52,271
The old birthday-candle trick
from Nam.

840
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,025
Just when you think it's out...

841
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,614
O'Leary. O'Leary, where are you?

842
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,532
Yeah, who's this?

843
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:33,771
Fellas, we going on a boat ride
to Kung Fu Island.

844
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,822
Hey, Black Dynamite,
there's the island.

845
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,210
Okay.

846
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,838
Now, here's the plan.

847
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,677
Yeah.

848
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,556
Okay, let's split up.

849
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,829
He's here.

850
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:35,876
We kicked their ass.

851
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,210
Power to the people, brothers.

852
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,713
This is it, brothers.

853
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:44,550
- This is where we stick it to the Man.
- Yeah.

854
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,135
Now, let's go get that lab.

855
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,722
All right, let's go.

856
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:56,021
You know, when we get back home,
I'm gonna retire from the revolution.

857
01:02:56,188 --> 01:02:57,481
Start a family.

858
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,065
Show this picture.

859
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,400
That's Betty Jo.

860
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,693
Yeah, right on, yeah.

861
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,739
Buy a home in the country.
Raise our own fruits and vegetables.

862
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,615
Bake our own bread,
know what I mean?

863
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,117
Bake our own...

864
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,414
Who saw that coming...?
Who saw where that came from?

865
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,041
Let's go.

866
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,115
I should've known you would be
behind this, Fiendish Dr. Wu.

867
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:53,286
Your knowledge of scientific
biological transmogrifications...

868
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,789
...is only out-matched by your zest
for kung-fu treachery.

869
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:04,463
Your kung fu is quite extraordinary,
Black Dynamite.

870
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,132
But no match for mine.

871
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,679
You should have joined us
when you had the chance.

872
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,472
But now you must die.

873
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,726
Man, I'll take this jive-ass turkey.

874
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:23,650
Bullhorn, no.

875
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,903
At long last, our friendship bonded
by the struggle against the Man...

876
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:31,449
...has been brought to an end
by kung-fu treachery.

877
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:35,619
Brother, your death
will not go unavenged.

878
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:40,000
Fiendish Dr. Wu,
you done fucked up now.

879
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,918
Get him.

880
01:04:59,978 --> 01:05:05,025
You must try the Wu family
Red Silk Kung Fu.

881
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,536
Black Dynamite Panther Fist.

882
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,766
What the fuck, huh?

883
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:22,601
Keep your eye on Black Dynamite.

884
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,989
Looking for me?

885
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:43,123
Can you see where I'm coming from,
you jive motherfucker?

886
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:48,295
No rush, huh? Come on, huh?

887
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:52,132
You told him
to keep an eye out for me.

888
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,394
I threw that shit
before I walked in the room.

889
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,864
I wanna know
who's pulling your strings.

890
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,324
Now start talking. Talk.

891
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:22,494
- I said, start talking.
- Okay.

892
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,789
Your government
has been preoccupied...

893
01:07:24,956 --> 01:07:27,208
...with building the bigger penis
for years.

894
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:32,922
What's this green one?

895
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,759
It did exactly opposite
of what it was intended.

896
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:41,264
It made the penis shrivel to the size
of a 2-month-old snapping turtle.

897
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:43,849
This is what you've been putting
in the malt liquor?

898
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,268
I was under orders.

899
01:07:46,978 --> 01:07:48,605
They threatened to fire me.

900
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,273
Speaking of fire.

901
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,112
Suddenly,
I'd like to leave your island.

902
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,197
No! No!

903
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,740
No.

904
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:12,378
You dirty motherfucker.

905
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:20,552
Hey, Black Dynamite,
I found a helicopter.

906
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,221
Quick, give me a hairpin.

907
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,569
What's in the briefcase,
Black Dynamite?

908
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,113
How far does this all go, man?

909
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,573
Cream Corn,
this goes all the way to the top.

910
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:45,744
And when I say top,
I mean the tippety-top.

911
01:08:45,912 --> 01:08:48,872
There it is, Black Dynamite.
The Honky House.

912
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,750
I'm going down.

913
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,918
- This shouldn't take long.
- Whoa, hey...

914
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,505
- Take the controls.
- What are you talking about?

915
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,466
Whoa, hey, hey, man.

916
01:09:01,302 --> 01:09:02,970
Son of a bitch.

917
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:10,936
Cream Corn, no!

918
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,895
I should have known it was you
all the time.

919
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:39,317
I should have asked myself,
"Who's the man so wicked...

920
01:10:39,484 --> 01:10:42,487
...so cruel to serve smack
to the orphanage...

921
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:47,533
...kill my brother Jimmy, and put out
a drug to shrink black men's dicks?"

922
01:10:48,034 --> 01:10:52,204
Only one man,
and that's you, Tricky Dick.

923
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:01,547
So I'm here to deliver you one
presidential ass-whooping.

924
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,135
Black Dynamite.

925
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,054
There is a perfectly...

926
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:13,100
...reasonable explanation for that.

927
01:11:18,731 --> 01:11:21,067
Showtime, motherfucker.

928
01:11:21,234 --> 01:11:23,235
Fucking...

929
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,738
Black Dynamite.

930
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,074
Who the fuck would duck?

931
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,246
Piece of shit.

932
01:11:58,605 --> 01:11:59,939
Don't fuck with me.

933
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,609
Motherfucker.

934
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:29,844
Take your filthy black hands
off the presidential dinnerware...

935
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:31,637
...you moon cricket.

936
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:37,912
And now, Black Dynamite,
you must die.

937
01:13:50,842 --> 01:13:52,635
You had enough, Mr. President?

938
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:56,264
You'll never get away with this.

939
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:58,432
Watch me,
you little insecure cracker.

940
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,393
You think
by shrinking our johnsons...

941
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,603
...it's gonna make your situation
any better?

942
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,106
That's your problem, Tricky Dick.
You are paranoid.

943
01:14:06,274 --> 01:14:08,650
Like sending those two-bit crooks
to Watergate.

944
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,444
For what?

945
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,779
For these?

946
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:15,742
- Look at you.
- What?

947
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:17,909
You lost it all, turkey.

948
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:22,664
- Kill me.
- Say what?

949
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:25,208
- Kill me.
- No.

950
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:26,877
That's the easy way out for you.

951
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,921
Unless you want the rest
of this freaky shit to hit the news...

952
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:32,341
...I suggest you take care
of me and my people.

953
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:33,551
Can you dig it?

954
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:36,429
I said, can you dig it?

955
01:14:36,596 --> 01:14:37,971
Yes, I can dig it.

956
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,224
Thought you could.

957
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:13,800
First Lady, I'm sorry I pimp-slapped
you into that china cabinet.

958
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:16,386
I used excessive force.

959
01:15:16,552 --> 01:15:18,637
Oftentimes, I cross the line...

960
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:21,640
...but I try to do so
in the name of what's right.

961
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:24,726
Most of the time,
the ends justifies the means.

962
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:29,189
But in this case, I feel like I betrayed
my own code of ethics...

963
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,234
...and for that, sugar, I apologize.

964
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,654
But I shot at you.

965
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:37,155
I tried to kill you, Black Dynamite.

966
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,701
This is true,
but you did not connect.

967
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:42,161
You shot a plate.

968
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:45,247
Had you connected,
maybe pimp-slapping you into that...

969
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,250
...might have been justified.

970
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,543
But I feel I crossed the line.

971
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,505
And for that,
please accept my apology.

972
01:15:53,256 --> 01:15:54,340
I do.

973
01:15:54,507 --> 01:15:55,966
I do, it's just...

974
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:59,679
Oh, Black Dynamite,
you're so righteous.

975
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:02,055
This is also true.

976
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,015
Because
whenever there's injustice...

977
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,018
...wrongs to be...

978
01:16:06,185 --> 01:16:08,563
Oh, Black Dynamite.

979
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,774
Go on, honey.

980
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:17,863
Because wherever there's injustice,
wrongs to be righted...

981
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:21,199
...innocents to be defended,
Black Dynamite will be there...

982
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,703
...delivering ass-whoopings.

983
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,872
And I will not hesitate to lay
the hammer down on any clown...

984
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:28,373
...that comes around.

985
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:32,377
Because if they wanna fight,
they best come see me...

986
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:35,172
...because I'm Black Dynamite.

987
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:38,355
How you doing
with that midget girl you sent out?

988
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:41,067
Man, she keeps coming up short.

989
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:57,166
And better no nigga
mess with me, neither.

990
01:19:57,333 --> 01:20:01,002
I would jump on him,
all 93 pounds of dynamite.

991
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:03,005
That's right.

992
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:19,979
So I says, "Bitch, you look like
you need a pimp in your life."

993
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,815
She said, "I got a pimp."

994
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:24,694
I said,
"Shit, that nigga ain't no pimp.

995
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:27,238
He a valet for ho's."

996
01:20:36,664 --> 01:20:38,582
It's called the
Mo Bitches Variety Pack.

997
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,792
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

998
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,671
I send out a big ho, a little ho,
a skinny ho, and one Navajo.

999
01:20:43,963 --> 01:20:46,590
- Is that right?
- That's right.

1000
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:14,659
Take that, you cracker-ass cracker.

1001
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:18,497
All right, girls, let's take them down.

1002
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,480
I only do two things well
in this world.

1003
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:49,194
I take money from bitches
and I sell drugs to the community.

1004
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,713
I had to send your ho back
the other day.

1005
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:10,131
- No?
- Yeah, man.

1006
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:14,011
She reckless eyeballing
and carrying on.

1007
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:18,265
She fine, but I said,
"Hey, your man is bona fide."

1008
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:20,559
See? You're a righteous pimp.

1009
01:22:20,726 --> 01:22:23,020
Shit, the real pimping lives here.

1010
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,438
It ain't ego.

1011
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:27,106
That's how we go. You like that?

1012
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,761
You gotta cross the lines sometimes.

1013
01:22:56,762 --> 01:23:01,307
Sometimes to do the right thing,
you got to do the ugly thing.

1014
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:07,021
You know people, they don't want
to see the cow killed...

1015
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:09,065
...they just want their steak
on a plate.

1016
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,568
Can you dig it?

1017
01:23:32,673 --> 01:23:34,632
Good evening, gentlemen.

1018
01:23:36,176 --> 01:23:38,261
Who let that nigga in my house?
