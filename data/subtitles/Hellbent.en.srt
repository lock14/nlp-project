{16253}{16278}Well, I hope you

{16492}{16549}The killer cut off their heads.
{16552}{16595}He cut off their heads,|and he took em.

{19512}{19557}- Come on.|- No, sit down.
{19560}{19596}- Kiss me.|- No. Okay, okay. Funny.
{19634}{19695}- Come on!|- If youre gonna make out in my booth,
{19698}{19739}you need to order something, guys.

{23043}{23082}Yeah, lm positive.

{23188}{23232}Chaz loaned it to me.

{23544}{23620}but I need him to give it to me.
{23623}{23674}I have to get it tonight too.

{24993}{25057}- You dick.|- Lighten up. I was joking.
{25115}{25170}It does look kind of good, though.
{25221}{25303}- We are going out, and we're doing it.|- Yes, we are.
{25306}{25356}This is the one night of the year,|Halloween,
{25359}{25434}when you get to indulge your most|perverse and twisted fantasies,
{25437}{25473}and nobody cares.
{25476}{25499}Jared Reynolds.
{25503}{25569}- Thats all I want.|- That has some potential.
{25572}{25640}- Hand me my costume back there, will ya?|- All right.
{25643}{25670}So what about you, Chaz?
{25673}{25765}You know me, man.|Life is meant for living.
{25768}{25833}- Hey, pass me the pants, too, yeah?|- Okay.
{25836}{25865}- No wait.|- Tobey, grab the wheel.
{25868}{25897}Yup.
{25928}{25954}Okay.
{25957}{26001}- Oh, good Lord.|- Jesus.
{26004}{26087}- Gotta go commando if you wanna rodeo.|- Oh, come on.
{26091}{26201}Whatre you looking to get,|all dolled up in that dress and cheap wig?
{26203}{26239}No, this wig is not cheap.
{26242}{26273}You looking to get laid?
{26276}{26355}No, no, no, we are not cruising|the trannie bars tonight, all right?
{26358}{26402}No, were not,|and I'll tell you why.
{26405}{26460}Because I spent $300|getting this pretty tonight,
{26464}{26512}and nothing, nobody is passing|through these lips,
{26515}{26556}no matter how big.
{26559}{26627}Okay? I am officially|removing myself from the race.
{26629}{26679}Oh, please.
{26683}{26741}You and you and you|can all thank me in the morning.
{26745}{26767}Dont worry about me.
{26803}{26865}Guys, check out this guy|on the bike here.
{26867}{26896}Oh, Jesus.
{27270}{27297}We're here.
{27300}{27371}Are you kidding me? You can't|park any closer than this?
{27373}{27398}Why are we here?
{27403}{27470}Eddie knows why we're here.
{27473}{27512}This is where it happened.
{27515}{27555}Less than 18 hours ago,
{27559}{27637}two gay guys were murdered|on this spot.
{27640}{27690}You're gonna make us|walk through the woods
{27692}{27723}to go to the carnival
{27727}{27770}because a couple of queens|got killed here?
{27772}{27798}It's Halloween.
{27802}{27836}That's a two-block hike.
{27840}{27867}Wuss.
{27871}{27909}I don't see you wearing heels.
{27912}{27977}You know, I saw|the crime scene photos.
{27979}{28020}- No way.|- Shut up.
{28022}{28068}What did they look like?
{28071}{28135}Two guys, just like us...|you know, 23, 22.
{28139}{28171}Yeah? Were they hot?
{28174}{28216}I don't know.
{28220}{28270}They didn't have their heads.
{28345}{28396}One of the guys|was hanging outside the door.
{28399}{28481}There was blood dripping|all over the handle.
{28484}{28518}The other guy,
{28521}{28578}I guess they thought he'd be safe|underneath their car,
{28580}{28654}so he curled up into a little ball|behind the tire.
{28658}{28694}When the coroner pulled him out,
{28697}{28766}he had to break his fingers|to get them off the axle.
{28769}{28803}That's kind of sweet, though.
{28806}{28834}Yeah. I don't know.
{28837}{28883}Whoever done it must have|been really strong
{28885}{28955}because their heads|were cut off so cleanly
{28959}{29005}that none of the tubes,|the veins,
{29009}{29042}the arteries, the wind pipe,
{29046}{29109}they weren't crushed at all.
{29111}{29154}They were wide open.
{29183}{29253}Speaking of air, can I|crack a fucking window?
{29255}{29308}Eddie used up|all the goddamn oxygen.
{29310}{29353}Nice story, Eddie.
{29355}{29380}You're a man with brains.
{29419}{29467}What makes people kill like that?
{29471}{29518}Probably some 40-year-old|gay guy
{29521}{29560}that just came out|of the closet.
{29564}{29608}He's probably jealous|of all the nice hot guys
{29610}{29637}like us walking around.
{29640}{29669}Shit. I mean, think about it.
{29673}{29719}Wouldn't you want to kill us?
{29722}{29765}We're fucking fabulous.
{29768}{29827}No. It's got to be|about his mother.
{29829}{29872}It always is.
{29875}{29909}The real motive doesn't matter,
{29911}{29977}because we're never gonna find out|what it is anyway.
{29979}{30023}If there's one thing|I'm sure of,
{30027}{30058}it's that guy got on a train
{30060}{30092}and took it back|to Louisiana or Oklahoma
{30096}{30158}or whatever backwater swamp|his ass was spawned in.
{30160}{30193}He didn't stick around.
{30234}{30275}God, shit!
{30278}{30304}Damn it!
{30350}{30393}Get out of the fucking car.
{30396}{30471}- Damn it, get out of the car.|- I got you.
{30473}{30534}I'm gonna beat your ass.|Get out of the fucking car.
{30537}{30565}Come here.
{30567}{30633}Get out of there.|What the fuck is wrong with you?
{30635}{30706}Jesus. You scared|the shit out of me.
{30733}{30765}That was hysterical.
{30768}{30840}Hey, come on, guys. I know|a back way to the carnival.
{30842}{30887}Fuck.
{30891}{30943}So why do you take|somebody's head?
{30946}{30985}Killers like trophies.
{30988}{31025}Maybe he couldn't get head|any other way.
{31028}{31059}Oh, man.
{31061}{31109}I was just saying|what you guys were thinking.
{31111}{31143}Maybe he does sleep with them.
{31146}{31198}Jesus, Joey,|where's your goddamn brain?
{31202}{31269}You know the brain's|actually the largest sex organ?
{31272}{31315}Speak for yourself, dude.
{31317}{31365}Gentlemen, last time|to take a piss
{31368}{31400}before the port-a-potties.
{31403}{31442}- All right.|- Find a tree.
{32434}{32468}Joey.
{32471}{32516}Joey, come here.
{32519}{32590}Leave me alone. I can't pee|if you're talking to me.
{32592}{32644}Eddie, do you ever|stop nagging?
{32647}{32694}- Shut up. Come here.|- What?
{32746}{32844}There's someone|in the bushes right there.
{32847}{32890}What am I supposed to see?
{32892}{32928}Joey.
{32962}{32997}Joey, get back here|right now. Come on.
{33000}{33029}What?
{33119}{33178}- There's someone in the bushes?|- Yeah.
{33180}{33236}Holy shit. He was right by me.
{33240}{33349}He's cruising us.|He is totally cruising us.
{33353}{33393}What does he look like?
{33396}{33432}I don't know.|He's wearing a mask.
{33435}{33486}Probably|for a very good reason.
{33513}{33553}Poor guy.
{33555}{33609}Halloween's probably|the only night of the year
{33612}{33647}where he gets any action.
{33650}{33696}Good luck to you,|creepy cruiser.
{33698}{33730}I hope you get some.
{33734}{33766}Yeah, big boy.
{33838}{33871}Damn!
{33873}{33903}Oh, man.
{33906}{33963}Devil Daddy's got|some serious drag on.
{33966}{34016}Damn, what's he doing?
{34019}{34049}Oh, man, he's whipping it out.
{34053}{34118}Yeah, show us, Big Daddy.|Come on.
{34122}{34182}Here it comes.
{34222}{34273}What's he got there?
{34313}{34359}That's a knife.
{34362}{34444}He's got a fucking knife,|the kinky bastard.
{34447}{34505}You are deranged, sir,|and I love it!
{34509}{34560}Is that all you got?|Give us some more.
{34563}{34642}Is your knife serrated?|You're making me hot, Big Daddy.
{34646}{34679}You guys are sick.
{34682}{34769}You want to see some? Come on,|big boy. You want to play?
{34772}{34797}Let's play.
