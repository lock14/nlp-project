{1}{72}/
{3647}{3700}Your son's on that roof again.
{3713}{3738}If he did what I told him
{3741}{3797}he wouldn't make|a very good preacher's kid, now would he?
{3799}{3881}Daddy, they're here,|and momma says you'd better behave.
{3968}{3992}Showtime.
{4266}{4334}It's a privilege and an honor,|as mayor of this great city,
{4346}{4440}to do my part in linking arms|with people from all walks of life.
{4451}{4548}{y:i}The city needs strategic partnerships with|{y:i}churches like Second Chance and The Rock,
{4558}{4609}and we need strong advocates|for the inner city,
{4611}{4690}- like my friend Reverend Jenkins here.|- And how do you know Reverend Jenkins?
{4693}{4752}I first met Jerry at an integrated jail cell.
{4755}{4839}We were both arrested in 1960|at a lunch counter sit-in.
{4850}{4938}Now when I want a restaurant shut down,|I just call the health department.
{5082}{5146}- Two scoop.|- Sorry, I was told to give one.
{5149}{5222}- Jake always give me two scoop.|- Tiki, you bothering the help?
{5246}{5277}It's cool.
{5287}{5348}So, I hear you're getting groomed|to take the old man's place.
{5350}{5398}Yep. When the time comes.
{5421}{5494}You got the shoes for it.|What are those, Gucci?
{5501}{5537}Come on, folks. Keep it moving.
{5543}{5567}Oops.
{5570}{5648}- Sorry about that.|- My lucky tie. It's ruined.
{5658}{5732}I'm sorry. Look, there's more napkins|down by the silverware, okay?
{5734}{5816}And I've got a job interview today.|I might as well not even go now.
{5902}{5928}{y:i}Here.
{5962}{6015}Take mine. Take it.
{6063}{6110}Hey, it better be lucky.
{6123}{6194}Have time to answer a few questions|before we pack up?
{6196}{6264}- Hey, Jake can you cover me?|- Got you covered.
{6269}{6292}{y:i}Yes, ma'am.
{6294}{6368}{y:i}I know your suburban church|{y:i}is pouring resources into this area,
{6370}{6433}yet crime and unemployment remain high.
{6437}{6471}{y:i}Well, like my friend the mayor said,
{6474}{6538}{y:i}our partnership with the inner city|{y:i}is for the long haul.
{6541}{6607}{y:i}You know, I'm proud|{y:i}of what we've accomplished so far.
{6610}{6680}{y:i}But if you want an insider's perspective,
{6716}{6788}- Pastor Jake's the man.|- Pastor, care to comment?
{6793}{6846}Are you talking about|helping-rich-white-folks-sleep-at-night
{6849}{6878}kind of difference?
{6881}{6929}That's what these cameras are for, right?
{6931}{7001}Meanwhile, our mayor's idea|of urban renewal
{7003}{7093}is building baseball stadiums|so poor people can sell the peanuts.
{7108}{7181}Maybe if he went back to kissing babies|instead of kissing corporations
{7184}{7221}on their big, fat self-serving...
{7223}{7289}As far as crime and unemployment|are concerned,
{7291}{7326}the statistics are showing improvement.
{7328}{7415}But the real bottom line for us|is meeting people's needs.
{7418}{7476}- Isn't that right, honey?|- That's right, honey.
{7861}{7908}The Second Chance video runs|during the choir number.
{7910}{7967}After that you got two minutes, max,|for the pledge cards.
{7970}{8027}- You cannot go overtime again.|- Pastor Ethan.
{8076}{8108}- Good morning, Parker.|- Hey.
{8110}{8150}Hey, how's it going?
{8233}{8266}Here you go.
{8270}{8324}Okay, let me see a pledge card.
{8399}{8442}Let's let Pastor Jake make the pitch, okay?
{8445}{8516}Personally I'd love to, but|I got a lot of board members complaining
{8518}{8564}we're already spending too much money|down there, so...
{8566}{8661}- I think he'd be more effective.|- Ethan, this is television, all right?
{8665}{8729}The guy's a loose cannon.|We got him on the platform.
{8731}{8765}We don't need him in the pulpit.
{8842}{8953}{y:i}You are the source of my strength
{9006}{9124}{y:i}You are the strength of my life
{9169}{9289}{y:i}I lift my hands in total
{9311}{9392}{y:i}Praise to you
{9417}{9498}{y:i}Amen
{9500}{9574}{y:i}Amen
{9582}{9661}{y:i}Amen
{9664}{9736}{y:i}Amen
{9745}{9825}{y:i}Amen
{9827}{9905}{y:i}Amen
{9910}{9990}{y:i}Amen
{9993}{10070}{y:i}Amen
{10704}{10784}{y:i}Who says church has to be boring? Amen?
{10787}{10817}Amen!
{10925}{10969}- I love you.|- Love you.
{11078}{11113}{y:i}Thank you, Dad.
{11208}{11306}{y:i}Yesterday my eyes were opened|{y:i}to what goes on at our sister church.
{11310}{11394}{y:i}Many of you all know my dad pastored|{y:i}Second Chance when I was a little kid.
{11397}{11472}{y:i}But I hadn't been down there|{y:i}in nearly 20 years.
{11474}{11543}{y:i}I could barely recognize|{y:i}the old neighborhood.
{11546}{11646}{y:i}Wasn't all hugs and smiles.|{y:i}It was hard work, some grim reality.
{11681}{11783}{y:i}I still think I got a little gravy on my loafers,|{y:i}right where the penny used to go.
{11835}{11879}{y:i}Well, it's a tough gig down there.
{11882}{11944}{y:i}I got to see Jake in action last night,
{11946}{12014}{y:i}and I'm here to tell you|{y:i}he is the right man for the job.
{12027}{12101}{y:i}You're going to get a chance to meet|{y:i}Jake and Amanda after the service,
{12104}{12181}{y:i}but right now,|{y:i}let's give them a round of applause
{12184}{12252}{y:i}for all the hard work they're doing|{y:i}in the worst part of town.
{12604}{12671}{y:i}Jake, we got all these pledge cards here.
{12674}{12747}{y:i}Why don't you come up here and tell us|{y:i}what we're investing in.
{12908}{12955}{y:i}Thank you, Brother Ethan.
{13038}{13111}{y:i}I've got a Q-tip in the car|{y:i}if you want to clean those loafers.
{13190}{13292}{y:i}This morning I was stuck at a stoplight|{y:i}in my 'hood,
{13318}{13382}{y:i}that would be neighborhood to you, sir.
{13422}{13509}{y:i}This woman comes up holding|{y:i}what looks like a baby wrapped in a blanket.
{13538}{13625}{y:i}She's tapping at my window|{y:i}asking for money,
{13644}{13751}{y:i}and I know that baby is a plastic doll,|{y:i}but she keeps tapping.
{13778}{13860}{y:i}So finally, I give her a dollar|{y:i}just to get rid of her.
{13876}{13965}{y:i}James, Chapter 1, teaches us
{13968}{14068}{y:i}to be doers of the word|{y:i}and not hearers only.
{14093}{14210}{y:i}Every year I feel like we come here|{y:i}tapping on your window,
{14230}{14272}{y:i}but our baby's real.
{14301}{14348}{y:i}I'm not asking for your money.
{14373}{14438}{y:i}I've got gifted children in my community
{14451}{14514}{y:i}who need some hands-on guidance.
{14542}{14624}{y:i}My wife needs tutors to help women
{14626}{14696}{y:i}trying to escape the bonds of prostitution.
{14718}{14828}{y:i}We need after-school supervisors,|{y:i}Bible school teachers.
{14997}{15042}{y:i}Hold these up so I can see them.
{15127}{15191}{y:i}This is how we fix problems in America.
{15210}{15324}{y:i}We roll down our windows,|{y:i}toss out some money, and drive away.
{15347}{15431}{y:i}So my message to you|{y:i}on Second Chance Sunday is this,
{15457}{15547}{y:i}if you aren't willing to come down|{y:i}and get a little gravy on your shoes,
{15628}{15677}{y:i}just keep your damn money.
{15795}{15834}Nice work, Ethan.
{16030}{16133}{y:i}It's good to know|{y:i}what's going on in our other areas.
{16154}{16210}{y:i}And now if our ushers would come forward,
{16213}{16280}{y:i}allowing us an opportunity for our giving.
{16392}{16437}- This guy stuck his finger in our face.|- Let me...
{16439}{16488}- Let me finish.|- Where does he get off lecturing us?
{16490}{16573}All he is saying is that we need|to stop pretending and start participating.
{16576}{16636}We've been participating|for nearly $2 million
{16638}{16682}for the last 15 years and I'm tired of it.
{16685}{16725}All right, maybe|we should all take a breather.
{16727}{16773}Look, this is not about|repaving the parking lot.
{16775}{16850}- We're on the front page here.|- We all read the paper, Mike.
{16856}{16894}Look, what if we run a full-page ad?
{16897}{16979}Reprint the headline at the top|and then beneath it in big letters:
{16992}{17026}"Fine, We Will."
{17069}{17133}- I think Mike's going to pay for that ad.|- Yeah.
{17160}{17242}Look, the point is we all want to|be good stewards of God's money.
{17245}{17311}And we're too big a church|to be defined by any one ministry.
{17314}{17380}But Second Chance isn't just any ministry.
{17384}{17500}It's our roots, and we probably haven't|paid them as much attention as we should.
{17503}{17586}Jeremiah, it's Ethan's fault|for giving him the pulpit.
{17594}{17685}Look, this keeps happening every Sunday.|He changes things around.
{17687}{17740}- It's driving the TV crew nuts.|- All right, slow down, Mike.
{17742}{17807}Yes, we are getting complaints|about Ethan's style,
{17810}{17837}about the music he chooses.
{17840}{17898}Let him play his music. He's a rock star.
{17900}{17957}But senior pastor? Not on my watch.
{17959}{18052}Hold on. So what if he is unconventional?|My family likes that.
{18054}{18135}I'm Ethan's biggest fan.|But, Jerry, you have got a global vision.
{18143}{18208}And it totally depends on grooming|a successor
{18210}{18257}that this whole church can get behind.
{18259}{18345}If Ethan's our man, he has got to learn|discipline and accountability.
{18361}{18396}Starting now.
{18435}{18473}I'll talk to him.
{18499}{18598}He needs more than a sermon, Jerry.|He needs his wings clipped.
{18662}{18717}And if you don't do it, we will.
{18833}{18892}Jerry brought me here|on our first anniversary.
{18908}{18956}Some traditions die hard.
{18970}{19037}- I haven't seen Green Goddess in a while.|- I know.
{19052}{19136}- How's the house coming?|- Slow. They're still painting.
{19148}{19241}It's a little spooky staying there by myself,|but it's easier to supervise.
{19254}{19308}I just want it all done by the wedding.
{19311}{19359}Yeah. I think we need to hear|what Jake's saying, Dad.
{19362}{19418}I mean, get our hands dirty down there.
{19421}{19485}Send our high-schoolers|on a summer work project.
{19492}{19568}Well, it would be good|to have more of our staff involved.
{19570}{19653}Yeah. You know what,|send Aaron, the junior out pastor.
{19657}{19704}I hear he speaks Ebonics.
{19796}{19872}Wait a minute. You want me to go?|Is this a joke?
{19878}{19905}You can't be serious.
{19907}{19963}I'm the associate pastor, Dad,|I'm not a social worker.
{19966}{20055}- It'll be a good ministry experience.|- Jake's not going to listen to me.
{20063}{20129}You're not going there to fix anything, son.
{20131}{20174}I just want you to observe and to learn.
{20177}{20209}Look, I've been busting it for two years
{20211}{20252}to move this church into the 21st century.
{20254}{20323}Attendance is up, giving is up,|we've got the best music in town.
{20326}{20397}- None of that is going to change.|- My book just came out, Dad.
{20400}{20480}- Happy birthday, Mrs. Jenkins.|- Thank you, that's beautiful.
{20482}{20574}- Are you still working on that steak, Pastor?|- No, I think I'm finished.
{20577}{20655}- Was it well-done enough for you?|- It was delicious.
{20758}{20865}Son, you're blessed|with charisma, musical gifts.
{20878}{20933}You're a natural at the pulpit.
{20936}{21009}But there's more to being a pastor|than Sunday morning.
{21019}{21100}Yeah? Before you send me off|to be a glorified intern,
{21102}{21162}I think you better check with the board first.
{21208}{21258}The board met this morning.
{21416}{21503}- Happy birthday, Mom.|- Happy birthday, Claudia.
{21510}{21541}Thank you.
{21663}{21741}- Well, you weren't very delicate.|- I was honest with him.
{21743}{21802}Oh, right, and the steak was delicious?
{21842}{21871}Make your wish.
{22281}{22360}Hey, baby! You want some action, baby?
{22367}{22466}- We got some money if you got the honey.|- Come take a ride with us, baby, come on!
{22799}{22858}{y:i}"And they grumbled against the boss,
{22861}{22949}{y:i}"'These men who were hired last,|{y:i}worked only one hour,
{22966}{23031}"'and you have made them equal to us
{23034}{23090}"'who have borne the burden of the work.'
{23226}{23264}"But he answered,
{23267}{23354}"'Friend, I am not being unfair to you.
{23370}{23433}"'Didn't you agree to work for a dollar?
{23450}{23543}"'Are you envious|because I am generous? So...
{23642}{23751}"'So the first will be last|and the last will be first."'
{23814}{23882}Gentlemen, do you understand|what this means?
{23891}{23991}You may have lost some years to addictions.|You may have lost some years in prison.
{23994}{24041}You all know I did some time myself.
{24043}{24134}But the Word of God teaches us|that time can be redeemed.
{24155}{24217}Yeah, tell that to the chump who took|one look at my record
{24220}{24268}and said he wasn't hiring.
{24274}{24345}- All right, what did Jonesy just do?|- Blame the Man.
{24347}{24399}That's right. Blame the Man all day,
{24402}{24484}but what are you doing to show|that you're trustworthy and eager to work?
{24490}{24576}Tell us about this chump, Jonesy.|Did you shake his hand when you met him?
{24578}{24653}- He didn't give it.|- Did you look him in the eye?
{24694}{24723}Stand up, Jonesy.
{24805}{24840}Shake my hand.
{24917}{25019}Man, I got a wet sandwich here.|Come on. Look me in the eye.
{25030}{25075}Squeeze my hand, Jonesy.
{25078}{25114}You call that a squeeze?
{25351}{25384}I'm sorry, Pastor.
{25386}{25466}- Javier, you know what time it is?|- Yes, sir.
{25470}{25545}You come in half-dressed and late again.|What's the excuse this time?
{25548}{25620}- 'Cause the job was on the line?|- No excuses, Pastor.
{25624}{25697}I gave you three strikes.|I can't give you four.
{25709}{25753}{y:i}Hasta mañana, brother.
{25892}{25972}Hey, Javier, wait a minute, man.|Let me walk you out.
{26002}{26050}- She took the kids.|- She did what?
{26053}{26092}She took the kids.
{26346}{26437}"Javier, I take the kids|and go back to El Paso.
{26457}{26517}"You make too many broken promises."
{26541}{26587}You want me to keep going?
{26609}{26701}She took the money we saved|and left me with nothing to follow.
{26718}{26789}My boys, they need their father.
{27034}{27070}It's all right.
{27094}{27139}It's gonna be all right, brother.
{27206}{27251}You looking for Amanda?
{27295}{27345}They're meeting downstairs.
{27678}{27741}I thought tonight was about job interviews.
{27762}{27824}But I believe God would have us|put our plans aside
{27827}{27886}and walk with our brother.
{27898}{27927}Hold on.
{28025}{28062}We need to talk.
{28158}{28197}Wait in my office.
{28346}{28409}Let's gather around our brother|and pray for him.
{28556}{28605}Do we need him in the room?
{28634}{28749}I'm sorry, gentlemen. This is Pastor Ethan,|visiting with us from The Rock.
{28785}{28827}I thought they already did that.
{28866}{28960}Pastor Ethan, we'd be privileged|to have you lead us in prayer.
{28995}{29022}Sure.
{29170}{29201}Let's pray.
{29219}{29309}"Father, I want to thank you|for the new start that only you can give.
{29322}{29366}"And for this group of men|who have come together
{29369}{29425}"who want to serve you with their lives.
{29428}{29481}"I especially want to lift up our brother..."
{29515}{29551}Our brother...
{29559}{29583}Javier.
{29586}{29653}Our brother Gabriel.
{29681}{29733}"Lord, You know us|better than we know ourselves."
{29758}{29797}Back, back!
{29847}{29889}- Green light.|- Red light!
{29902}{29941}Back.
{29962}{29989}- Green light!|- Red light!
{29991}{30065}- Back!|- Brownies, brownies, brownies, everybody.
{30106}{30149}Payton, one brownie.
{30208}{30254}Something I could do for you, honey?
{30281}{30360}- You let your kids play with them?|- Sure. They love it here.
{30390}{30499}- I got a kid. A girl.|- Well, you bring her. You're both welcome.
{30504}{30559}No, I ain't seen her in a while.
{30593}{30681}- Well, what's her name?|- Kenya, like the country.
{30705}{30737}Beautiful.
{30747}{30825}- What's your name?|- You know, I'm gonna get her back.
{30880}{30978}A child should be with her mother.|You want a cup of tea?
{30982}{31095}- No, I just need some money.|- We don't give out cash, honey.
{31098}{31125}A smart girl like you knows that.
{31128}{31215}Yeah, well, you can't buy gas without it.|Smart woman like you knows that.
{31255}{31308}- Amen.|- Strengthen our brother, Lord.
{31310}{31343}Amen.
{31347}{31391}- Empower him, Lord.|- Yes.
{31402}{31481}Lord, we all need a helping hand|from time to time,
{31507}{31554}and I want Javier to know,
{31557}{31618}I'm claiming this Powerball number|in your name.
{31642}{31717}8-10-11-18-25-40.
{31744}{31848}You sprinkle your power on that number,|Lord, and I'm giving you 15%.
{31866}{31933}Now, I know the Bible says 10,|but it's a big pot,
{31948}{32015}and I'm going to use it to fly Javier|to El Paso so he...
{32018}{32050}- Amen.|- Amen.
{32111}{32167}We'll see most of you all at the Habitat build
{32170}{32228}and if anybody wants coffee,|Jonesy's buying.
{32232}{32256}Huh?
{32258}{32285}You got enough money for Powerball,
{32288}{32366}you got enough money|to buy your friends some coffee.
{32390}{32432}All right, all right.
{32478}{32516}Payton, get down.
{32550}{32581}I told you.
{32590}{32645}How far along are you?
{32718}{32812}- He's gonna kill me.|- We have a room here for you.
{32841}{32932}- Nah, I can't.|- Come on, let me make you that cup of tea.
{32970}{33002}Come on.
{33223}{33283}You got away pretty quick|after Sunday service.
{33286}{33344}Big building.|Didn't want to get lost in the crowd.
{33346}{33401}Oh, I would have been happy to tell you|where to go.
{33403}{33435}Exit's that way.
{33513}{33617}Look, I gave you my pulpit time televised|and you use it to start a fight.
{33639}{33681}Now I got the whole church mad at me
{33684}{33760}like I'm the one who wrote|your "get whitey" speech.
{33777}{33843}They called a board meeting, Jake.|I wasn't invited.
{33872}{33922}That makes two of us.
{33976}{34055}Hey, hold up. This isn't funny.
{34070}{34119}Your little rant could have cost me my job.
{34122}{34211}Oh. So it's about the job.|Well, cheer up, Gucci,
{34231}{34305}I hear you're in pretty tight with the pastor.
{34355}{34459}You're pretty cocky for a guy whose salary|gets approved by the same board.
{34483}{34530}Are you listening to me?
{34578}{34604}Are you listening to me?
{34606}{34640}Yours to keep, man.
{34657}{34740}- Hey, I'm talking to you!|- Oh, is that your preacher voice?
{34770}{34811}I think he's coming.
{34879}{34994}- Listen, Jake. Hey, I'm on your side, okay?|- Look, Gucci, what do you want from me?
{35027}{35094}Well, you know what,|you could start by saying "I'm sorry."
{35153}{35183}All right.
{35242}{35334}I'm sorry for associate pastors|who got this all figured out
{35337}{35401}'cause they spent an hour down here|slinging potatoes.
{35408}{35446}I'm sorry for rock stars who think
{35449}{35494}they've lived|the African-American experience
{35497}{35540}riding a tour bus with Tina Turner.
{35542}{35624}And I'm sorry for "whiteys"|who try and get their conscience fixed
{35626}{35650}by coming down here
{35653}{35729}and hanging with their homeboys|in the ghetto once a year.
{35751}{35784}How's that?
{35878}{35922}You're the most self-righteous...
{36042}{36086}I'll see you tomorrow.
{36174}{36265}What do you mean, "see you tomorrow"?|What do you mean, "see you tomorrow"?
{36474}{36532}Self-righteous? Self-righteous.
{36599}{36664}- Who's your friend?|- This is Julius.
{36741}{36781}You gonna read that?
{36836}{36904}What you looking at him for?|He ain't gonna read it for you.
{36930}{36965}He wants out.
{37054}{37105}Did you tell him how you got out?
{37137}{37227}- He doesn't have family out of town.|- No parents, grandparents?
{37253}{37348}- My brother's the only family I got.|- Maybe he'll bend the rules for you.
{37353}{37433}He didn't bend them when I got in.|They beat the hell out of me.
{37461}{37552}It's a free-for-all, Jake. And it's worse|going out then it is coming in.
{37567}{37649}Your brother's got it all jacked up, kid.|Ain't even a real game.
{37658}{37690}Where do they come up with this stuff?
{37693}{37757}Man, last year two of my crew got dumped|at the hospital.
{37760}{37841}- One came out in a Ziploc.|- You preached the funeral.
{37902}{37938}Yeah, I did.
{38008}{38057}I don't want to be preaching another.
{38161}{38237}My momma brought me to hear|Dr. Martin Luther King
{38240}{38305}speak in this very church in 1967.
{38315}{38357}I was nine years old.
{38360}{38419}And I'll never forget what he did,|right here on this very spot,
{38422}{38485}when I held my hand out to him|after the service.
{38490}{38557}Here, put out your hand like you're me.
{38579}{38645}He shook it just like that.
{38682}{38749}Toilet in the men's room is running.|Might be the chain.
{38752}{38805}Costing us money. Got to fix that.
{38809}{38847}Good man, Sonny.
{38894}{38938}How many "I's" in traveling?
{38979}{39065}- Looks right to me.|- Nah, I think it's only one.
{39069}{39113}Maybe it's one of those words|spelled both ways.
{39117}{39158}- It can't be.|- Look it up.
{39162}{39205}Don't have to look it up.
{39268}{39353}So. Got a call from Jeremiah this morning.
{39355}{39407}Says you're here for a while|to observe and learn.
{39410}{39441}Yeah, whatever that means.
{39443}{39515}Hey, look, this is just as awkward for me|as it is for you, okay?
{39518}{39572}- Since we both got bosses, just...|- No, I got a boss.
{39574}{39643}- You got a daddy.|- Just show me to my office.
{39646}{39684}You want to see your office?
{39815}{39847}Follow me.
{40444}{40516}So I just imagined your raised eyebrow|when I locked my car?
{40518}{40553}Projection, my man.
{40555}{40613}But if you got a guilty conscience,|why you driving it?
{40616}{40673}I don't have a guilty conscience.
{40760}{40830}We got some sack lunches|at the park at noon.
{40927}{40968}What are you doing?
{41191}{41222}The last thing you want to do is
{41225}{41278}make people feel like|you're talking down to them.
{41281}{41345}Which is why we ask the staff|to voluntarily avoid
{41347}{41423}- displays of conspicuous consumption.|- Like my car.
{41426}{41477}Look, if you want me to take the bus,|just say it, okay?
{41479}{41547}Easy, Gucci.|You the one that brought this up.
{41550}{41575}Drive what you want.
{41578}{41655}You ain't gonna be here long enough|to learn the bus schedules, now are you?
{41721}{41759}A little help here, Hobart.
{42242}{42332}- What's going on up there? Is that a fire?|- No, no.
{42482}{42544}They're at it again, Pastor. You smell that?
{42550}{42643}I got a call from social services.|There's a duplex coming up next week.
{42669}{42752}Oh, Ethan, this is Tamela.|Tamela, this is a white man.
{42769}{42832}- Is this hazelnut?|- Don't be changing the subject.
{42835}{42867}You got to stop them up there.
{42870}{42964}Between my chemicals and their campfires,|we could all blow up.
{43006}{43037}All right.
{43126}{43160}We're going in.
{43357}{43412}Hope we don't catch|one of them back drafts.
{43630}{43658}Fire marshal.
{43736}{43765}Open up.
{43903}{43949}Honey, will you let me in?
{44051}{44092}Thank you, sweetie.
{44268}{44313}Kali, you barbecuing again?
{44334}{44405}How many times I tell you,|there's no ventilation in here.
{44414}{44458}Use the stove.
{44464}{44522}- Goat no good on stove.|- Goat?
{44550}{44605}Where did you find goat around here?
{44635}{44690}They gonna burn this place down.
{44798}{44852}Ask your daddy why he's not at work.
{45038}{45101}He said no good job for a professor.
{45159}{45197}Did you hear that?
{45233}{45334}Well, you tell the professor that|unless he's got a better offer from Harvard,
{45337}{45429}he needs to get back down to Wal-Mart|and start wrangling those shopping carts.
{45461}{45490}Tell him.
{45519}{45544}Is that you?
{45546}{45574}Tell him.
{45778}{45816}Oh, very pretty.
{45840}{45918}The soldiers come. They shoot us.
{45939}{46032}You got to make him understand, Kali.|The well's gonna run dry.
{46482}{46565}Bags too heavy? Arms getting tired?
{46586}{46638}- I got them.|- Then how about a smile, huh?
{46641}{46729}God loves a cheerful giver.|Tiki, where you going? Got your lunch.
{46734}{46793}I'm full, man. Salisbury steak.
{46842}{46880}That's our spot.
{46900}{46960}Been here every Wednesday for eight years.
{46991}{47014}I'm...
{47026}{47085}needing some money|to pick up my stomach medicine.
{47090}{47140}I'll pay you back on Friday.
{47400}{47432}Would you like something to eat?
{47434}{47525}Just set your belongings over there|and join us for a hot meal, okay?
{47534}{47609}You see, Sister, we brought|these sandwiches from the church...
{47612}{47644}Sandwiches.
{47680}{47759}- I see everyone get a bag.|- Sister, those are...
{47784}{47813}Never mind.
{47899}{47944}They've even got music.
{47965}{48014}I'm needing some real food.
{48666}{48731}Are you aware that family|almost got murdered in Africa?
{48735}{48799}Escaped with the clothes on their back.
{48826}{48850}And you'd really kick them out
{48853}{48904}because the dad doesn't want to collect|shopping carts.
{48906}{48931}Yep.
{48964}{49036}The guys like Tiki get a free meal|any time they show up?
{49110}{49200}Well, it's nice they can count on you|to feed them once they're on the street.
{49218}{49278}- I'll have the usual.|- What do you get here?
{49306}{49340}Make it two.
{49517}{49540}Is that...
{49546}{49582}Is that you?
{49585}{49661}- You played pro ball?|- Yeah.
{49673}{49776}Lasted two playoff-free seasons.|Till coach started making us pee in cups.
{49822}{49886}Hey, Gucci, you ever see an Eskimo pee?
{49966}{50040}Yeah, that's when I did|my eight months for possession.
{50063}{50153}- I didn't know any L.A. Lawyers.|- Oh, come on, Jake.
{50169}{50244}Maybe I didn't do hard time|but I didn't get off.
{50247}{50284}Everyone thinks court-ordered rehab
{50287}{50360}is like going to a resort|to hang out with celebrities.
{50362}{50397}But it's not.
{50801}{50920}So, I hear your dad's franchising himself|all over these days.
{50955}{51022}Nairobi, Bombay.
{51042}{51109}What, has The Rock finally gotten|too small for him?
{51111}{51149}What's that supposed to mean?
{51158}{51256}It's just that he's always flying off|to preach somewhere.
{51329}{51402}- You're missing the vitamins.|- I believe it's called the Great Commission.
{51405}{51465}Do you know how many converts|we've had in Africa alone?
{51468}{51525}It ain't a ball game, Gucci.|Nobody's keeping score.
{51528}{51577}We're sending ministry teams|all around the world.
{51580}{51637}- Doctors, teachers...|- It's all good.
{51641}{51715}I just think the home front|should take priority. That's all.
{51718}{51765}You mean your home front.
{51839}{51901}Back when your dad first hired me|as youth pastor,
{51914}{51981}we were more than a team. We were family.
{51998}{52066}Then he goes off to the suburbs|to preach to...
{52090}{52158}The rich white people|without a care in the world, right?
{52303}{52340}Try some bread.
{52580}{52609}Eskimo pee.
{52746}{52830}Yeah, I was born here, but man,|it's like night and day.
{52839}{52916}30% unemployment. Babies having babies.
{52927}{52988}Half these kids won't graduate|from high school.
{52990}{53019}What up, holmes?
{53056}{53097}- All right, who's getting it today?|- Me, me, me.
{53100}{53164}- Come on, PJ. Keep it going.|- Yeah, that's it. Keep it going.
{53166}{53232}Come on. Come on. Keep it going.|Keep it going. That's it. That's it.
{53234}{53292}Pass it on, pass it on. Take it. Take it.
{53299}{53369}- Come on, Coach.|- Pass it on. Pass it on.
{53531}{53584}Hey, Julius.
{53746}{53781}Hey, Julius.
{53854}{53890}Hey, Julius.
{53935}{53991}- What's up?|- Hey, I got to go, Pastor.
{54053}{54093}Hey! Wait!
{54530}{54581}Jamal, you keeping things proper?
{54634}{54701}Julius, tell your brother|I asked him a question.
{54752}{54777}Yeah.
{54793}{54876}- Julius tell you he wants out?|- He know how to get out.
{54890}{54916}Yeah.
{54930}{54992}He tell you I'm through|burying your ex-mules?
{55057}{55116}Gangster, I'm talking to you.
{55171}{55260}Man, look, my 'hood, my rules,
{55310}{55334}my nigga.
{55454}{55483}Back up.
{55491}{55552}You see that cross|over on top of that church steeple?
{55554}{55596}- You see it?|- I see it.
{55598}{55652}You look good,|'cause anywhere in this neighborhood
{55654}{55697}you see that cross is my 'hood.
{55700}{55789}- And my rules say slavery is over.|- You can't bend rules for family.
{55791}{55854}Yeah, then how about I bend your arm|over your head?
{55864}{55924}Jake, you're going to break his arm.
{56036}{56061}Now,
{56102}{56174}I'm going to give you some time|to pray about this.
{56202}{56248}And if I don't like your answer,
{56250}{56340}then I'm gonna open up a can|of the wrath of God all over your sorry ass.
{56766}{56845}What was that?|And what's this wrath of God stuff?
{56853}{56893}Ever hear of "What would Jesus do?"
{56896}{56932}Tell me again why you're here.
{56934}{56999}Jake, you just can't go around threatening|one guy
{57002}{57089}and then throwing a drunk back his bottle.|I mean, it's not consistent.
{57092}{57155}Answer the question. Why are you here?
{57203}{57234}To observe and learn.
{57237}{57299}Do you always observe|with your mouth open?
{57335}{57406}- All right. You made your point.|- No, I don't think I have.
{57419}{57475}Sit. Sit.
{57798}{57845}Back when I was on lock,
{57855}{57939}every day on my way to the yard,|I walked by the chapel.
{57943}{58012}Comfortable chairs, coffee pot,
{58034}{58088}and there sat the chapel|waiting for customers.
{58105}{58144}I never went once.
{58159}{58214}Then along came your dad|and his prison ministry.
{58217}{58300}Met me on my turf.|Wanted to know my story.
{58317}{58366}Gave me a chance after I got out.
{58383}{58452}He couldn't have done that preaching|from a stadium or on TV
{58454}{58532}or even from the pulpit|of a rundown old sanctuary.
{58539}{58615}He did that by walking the streets|and listening.
{58830}{58859}That's my car.
{59343}{59397}- Is there a switch inside?|- It's locked, Jake.
{59430}{59468}Not anymore.
{59726}{59794}You see who did this?|You see who did this?
{59915}{59952}Yeah, I want to report a crime.
{59954}{60020}Yeah, my brown leather jacket,|my golf clubs.
{60022}{60075}- Jake, where are we?|- You calling 911?
{60078}{60117}Tell her where we are.
{60174}{60199}What are you doing?
{60202}{60257}Man, your insurance check will get here|before the cops.
{60259}{60342}- Let me get you a cup of coffee.|- What am I supposed to do with my car?
{60368}{60409}Do you sell windows?
{60445}{60512}- I'm calling the auto club.|- Suit yourself.
{60518}{60589}Watch the man's car till the truck gets here.
{60614}{60638}What?
{60659}{60750}- You know what, you're crazy.|- You're right. You figure it out.
{60895}{60970}I don't care who bought it, I don't care|what your classmates are wearing,
{60973}{61015}I don't care|if everybody came to school naked.
{61018}{61083}- You ain't going out dressed like that.|- I'll wear what I want.
{61086}{61129}Excuse me,|you take yourself back up to your room
{61132}{61161}and you put something over that.
{61164}{61213}I didn't wear nothing|you didn't used to wear.
{61216}{61264}I am your mother, don't talk to me like that.
{61266}{61326}I ain't had a mother my whole life.
{61514}{61541}Trina?
{61713}{61780}Trina, why are you here?
{61806}{61835}My baby.
{61850}{61905}Judge got to give me back my baby.
{61908}{61935}Well, then, you got to be ready
{61938}{62032}'cause it's going to be a whole lot tougher|getting back your daughter's respect.
{62208}{62286}Mommy, I want to do that again.|I can do it better.
{62328}{62362}- Next time.|- Okay.
{62365}{62424}Everybody, let's just take a break.
{62452}{62481}Come on.
{62566}{62629}No, I want to pick out the china pattern|with you.
{62632}{62669}I just don't know how long|this is gonna take
{62672}{62732}and I'm probably going to need to get|a rental car.
{62786}{62849}Did you hear that? Did you hear that?
{62859}{62908}No, I think it was gunfire.
{62911}{62979}And forget china,|I want to pick out a flak jacket.
{63006}{63053}Honey, it's just a joke.
{63069}{63133}Look, I'll call you|when the truck gets here, okay?
{63136}{63185}All right. Love you, too.
{63282}{63317}You like that one?
{63369}{63436}So they were cooking goat?|You ever try goat?
{63447}{63534}- It's like eating rubber bands.|- How would you know?
{63559}{63632}- Ethan, I raised them when I was a kid.|- Oh, yeah, that's right.
{63634}{63691}This is called "Butterfly Garden."
{63694}{63741}- It's a little too busy.|- Yes.
{63783}{63828}I want you to be safe down there.
{63856}{63919}It's not that bad. It's just really different.
{63922}{64004}Royal Cambridge has just come out|with this coronation re-issue.
{64006}{64046}Quite beautiful, isn't it?
{64098}{64136}- No.|- No.
{64154}{64222}This is a sample that just came in Monday.
{64226}{64277}Hand-painted in Budapest.
{64286}{64369}- Absolutely exquisite.|- That's lovely.
{64372}{64437}- How much?|- $350 per setting.
{64499}{64559}We got to let our rich friends|buy us something.
{64582}{64646}- Sorry.|- That's okay. Can I see the other pieces?
{64649}{64681}Absolutely.
{64734}{64780}Think about this in our dining room.
{64782}{64843}Do you still have those paint chips|in your wallet?
{64985}{65017}What's that?
{65094}{65125}Here we are.
{65190}{65233}I think we're gonna keep looking.
{65244}{65286}- Really.|- Thanks for your help.
{65289}{65337}- Of course.|- I'll pull the car up.
{65340}{65397}- I'm sorry. Thank you.|- Good luck.
{65413}{65441}Ethan?
{66535}{66605}I need one coffee and a glazed donut.
{66952}{66992}And I'll take one lottery ticket.
{67044}{67076}Thank you.
{67226}{67293}Hey, guys.|Remember me from the men's group?
{67305}{67400}- I know who you are.|- You're Jonesy, you're Javier.
{67461}{67516}Oh, good donut.
{67535}{67567}You make this?
{67759}{67801}Hey, see you later, buddy.
{67824}{67925}Javier, hang on.|Look, I know about your situation.
{67938}{67977}I'd like to help you out.
{68006}{68065}Look, I want you to take this.
{68083}{68154}I want you to use this to get your family|back from El Paso.
{68157}{68225}Take it. Your kids need their dad.
{68255}{68328}- Take it, please.|{y:i}- Gracias.
{68335}{68358}Bless you.
{68559}{68602}Hey, I don't know|if that was such a good idea.
{68605}{68634}Why not?
{68637}{68714}Well, you don't want to give junkies|a wad of cash.
{68779}{68893}- You mean he's doing?|- He's been clean six months, I think.
{69014}{69110}- Coffee's hot.|- Hey, maybe it's a test from God, huh?
{69206}{69279}Look. I bought you this.
{69373}{69423}- I thought you was a pastor.|- I am.
{69448}{69543}- I just want you to have it.|- Pastor Jake know about this?
{69639}{69728}It'll be our secret.|You let me know if you hit the jackpot.
{69812}{69908}You know, I got myself|a job interview today.
{69937}{69974}I just don't want to jinx it.
{70245}{70316}Right. All right, Kali,|remember to follow through, okay?
{70474}{70526}Someone want to tell me what's so funny?
{70587}{70624}I want 10 laps.
{70670}{70742}Yo, Globetrotter, count them down|and lock up, will you?
{70758}{70814}Let's go, 10 laps. Let's go!
{70842}{70915}Kali, you don't need to run the laps, okay?
{70990}{71033}Nine more, let's go!
{71053}{71110}Let's go, guys. Come on, keep it up.
{71150}{71188}Keep going. Nine more!
{71199}{71227}Kali, wait up.
{71292}{71373}Hey, wait up. Hey, look,|hey, you didn't do anything wrong.
{71404}{71478}How's your family?|Is your dad still working at Wal-Mart?
{71488}{71529}Has he got a new job?
{71636}{71663}Hey, Kali.
{71736}{71763}Never mind.
{72318}{72367}Well? What do you think?
{72408}{72457}Nice images. It's colorful.
{72473}{72505}It just doesn't...
{72553}{72610}It makes us look like a country club.
{72613}{72672}I mean, there's no mention|of our inner-city ministries,
{72675}{72748}- nothing about what we're doing overseas.|- Go on.
{72757}{72814}You know what, maybe it's because|I've been gone for two weeks,
{72817}{72871}but it's just... It's not real.
{72878}{72914}And why aren't you in it?
{72917}{72970}Parker thought|it shouldn't be personality driven.
{72973}{73027}Well, Parker's wrong, as usual.
{73060}{73158}Open up the Africa bin|and pull up that shot with dad and the kids.
{73227}{73316}You see this? You're a personality, Dad.
{73332}{73373}God uses personalities.
{73376}{73424}Name one preacher|who isn't bigger than life,
{73426}{73468}who doesn't have a little rock star in him.
{73470}{73532}Jake's sure got it. He learned it from you.
{73615}{73702}Hey, pull up that shot of Jake and me|at the homeless lunch.
{73762}{73796}Yeah, go back.
{73811}{73858}Yeah, slow it down about 50%.
{73886}{73916}Go back, yeah.
{74050}{74074}Yeah.
{74116}{74168}Got to go, Dad. Late for work.
{74691}{74755}Well, I figure we're gonna need|a couple of blocks on the other side
{74758}{74793}- for a cloverleaf.|- Look at that.
{74795}{74851}They're practically on church property.
{74870}{74955}This area needs a clean sweep.|It's like Baltimore, right?
{74958}{75013}Camden Yard goes up, crime goes down.
{75016}{75069}And the Orioles still can't win.
{75322}{75417}Hey, just in time.|I need 20 bucks to get my medicine.
{75440}{75487}I saved you the last roast beef, all right?
{75490}{75527}I'm not giving you cash.
{75530}{75600}You need medicine,|I'll walk you to the drugstore.
{75633}{75661}I like you.
{75663}{75773}First time I saw you I thought you|were a chump loser. You're all right.
{75860}{75906}I'm still not giving you cash.
{76021}{76091}Well, I think I'm going to need|a couple more weeks
{76094}{76174}- to sell this to my board.|- What? This is a favor, Parker.
{76177}{76242}A favor to you and your church.|If it's going to be controversial...
{76245}{76338}- No, no, no. I'm just building consensus.|- Consensus, my ass.
{76341}{76386}I've got councilmen pushing alternate sites.
{76389}{76453}You guaranteed me a no-hassle transition.
{76476}{76517}May I help you gentlemen?
{76558}{76636}- Hey! Ethan, right?|- Mayor Long, good to see you.
{76638}{76702}Yeah, good to see you.|What have you got there?
{76715}{76793}Well, I got a little bologna, deviled ham...
{76819}{76873}I'm hearing good stuff|about what you're doing down here.
{76875}{76913}Really. From who?
{76986}{77036}So, how are you getting along with Jake?
{77038}{77107}Well, he's got his basketball clinic going on.
{77110}{77156}Want to suit up, Parker?|A little one-on-one?
{77158}{77208}No, no, no. You guys are out of my league.
{77210}{77246}Hey, good to see you.
{77534}{77601}Trina! Trina, you need to slow down.
{77614}{77659}Trina, let's talk about this.
{77675}{77729}Why are you in my face? I am not your kid!
{77731}{77786}You need to think about|what you're doing here.
{77789}{77841}But he's taking me shopping, all right?|He's even buying lunch.
{77844}{77899}The only reason that Buster is here|is to buy your abortion
{77902}{77949}and put you back on the street.
{77952}{78007}Hey, we are having a conversation!
{78030}{78054}Trina!
{78189}{78265}Trina. Trina, he is lying to you!
{78489}{78531}I don't know how you do it.
{78564}{78600}One girl at a time.
{78618}{78691}Yeah, but how many really turn around?
{78813}{78850}You're looking at one.
{78942}{79023}Watch your opponent.|Find his weakness and exploit it.
{79154}{79226}- It looks easy.|- That's the way I could be going.
{79290}{79365}Wear your opponent down|with aggressive moves.
{79476}{79561}Now, why'd I go for the lay-up?|Why not the slam-dunk?
{79564}{79635}- 'Cause it ain't showbiz.|- That's right. It ain't showbiz.
{79638}{79683}Your team's counting on you|to sink the points.
{79686}{79753}You don't get any extra points|by being a showoff.
{79799}{79849}Don't let him drive to the basket.
{79929}{80007}- Larry Bird.|- Larry Bird.
{80054}{80112}Now, when your opponent has the ball,|where's your focus?
{80114}{80150}- The ball?|- Wrong. Where's your focus?
{80152}{80240}- His hands.|- Wrong again. His eyes. You lock eyes.
{80242}{80306}Eyes will tell you everything|you need to know.
{80365}{80401}Hey!
{80571}{80622}All right, that's enough for today.
{80780}{80813}New shoes, Kali?
{81021}{81088}- Something you want to tell me?|- What do you mean?
{81097}{81155}- Did you give him money?|- No. Why would you even say that?
{81158}{81197}I know about Javier.
{81241}{81293}- Look, I was just trying to help, okay?|- Yeah?
{81296}{81374}Well, nobody's seen him for over a week,|including his boss.
{81382}{81421}Well, how do you know he's not in El Paso?
{81423}{81503}How do you know he's not strung out|under a bridge somewhere?
{81583}{81612}Let's get you a coat.
{81630}{81696}{y:i}I'll point you to Jesus
{81698}{81769}{y:i}I'll point you to Jesus
{81771}{81841}{y:i}I'll point you to Jesus
{81843}{81919}{y:i}I'll point you to Jesus
{81922}{81994}{y:i}I'll point you to Jesus
{81997}{82069}{y:i}To turn your darkness
{82072}{82125}{y:i}Into day
{82128}{82170}Good!
{82218}{82270}Can I help you, Pastor Ethan?
{82279}{82315}I'm just listening.
{82318}{82406}We have plenty of empty seats up here.|Isn't that right, choir?
{82460}{82522}Come on over here, Pastor Ethan. Come on.
{82595}{82656}You know,|I remember when he was a little boy,
{82662}{82704}he used to sit at this piano
{82706}{82745}and in between services|he would play songs.
{82748}{82825}- Do you still play piano, Pastor Ethan?|- Little bit.
{82833}{82873}Well, praise the Lord!
{82876}{82973}Come on over here and play for us|so I can conduct proper.
{82981}{83004}Come on.
{83030}{83073}Come on. Thank you.
{83110}{83179}What is wrong with you all?|Come on now, get with it.
{83258}{83303}Pastor, do you know {y:i}Follow Me?
{83314}{83338}Yeah.
{83355}{83443}Well, I would like to do it up-tempo.|Can you set the tempo, please?
{83521}{83548}Go ahead.
{84026}{84112}{y:i}I have a friend indeed
{84142}{84237}{y:i}One who supplies my every need
{84266}{84358}{y:i}Follow me, I'll show you the way
{84385}{84481}{y:i}To turn your darkness into day
{84513}{84601}{y:i}He'll turn your darkness into day
{84619}{84675}I just don't know about this cat, baby.
{84689}{84735}He's not doing anything wrong.
{84738}{84805}He's shown up every day for work|for two weeks.
{84808}{84853}He's done everything we asked him.
{84877}{84977}Now if I could learn to stop cursing,|surely you could learn to use a computer.
{84979}{85065}Yeah, well, you let me know when that|happens and I might let you buy me one.
{85067}{85093}Keep going.
{85096}{85171}It's just that he's always got his eye|on the audience.
{85177}{85236}Whether he's giving away his necktie
{85238}{85331}or letting somebody walk off with his jacket,|I just feel like he's waiting for applause.
{85334}{85400}Honey, he's a musician.|He's used to applause.
{85402}{85456}Well, we both know|he ain't gonna get it down here.
{85458}{85537}Soon as he figures that out,|like father, like son.
{85582}{85611}You hear that?
{85652}{85693}What's going on out there?
{85701}{85742}Sounds like music.
{85872}{85931}{y:i}- Follow me|{y:i}- Follow me
{85934}{85993}{y:i}- Follow me|{y:i}- Follow me
{85995}{86058}{y:i}- Follow me|{y:i}- Follow me

{86241}{86294}{y:i}- I'll point you to Jesus|{y:i}- And we'll go there

{86986}{87034}{y:i}Yeah
{87073}{87124}{y:i}Yes, he will
{87127}{87176}{y:i}Yes, yeah!
{87421}{87483}That's a real gift you got there,|Pastor Ethan.
{87486}{87552}- Isn't that right, Pastor Jake?|- Yes, ma'am!
{87558}{87619}The Music Man has come to River City.
{87626}{87671}See everybody on Sunday.
{87674}{87745}Enjoy him while you can, Miss Burdoe,|he's just on loan.
{87747}{87791}Could be a fine match.
{87797}{87867}- Amen to that.|- Ask him.
{87886}{87979}What are your future plans, Ethan?|Gonna be with us for a while?
{87982}{88059}'Cause we sure have seen enough|of those ghetto tourists down here.
{88062}{88096}Haven't we, honey?
{88098}{88189}Hanging around just long enough|to be able to tell their congregation,
{88197}{88239}"I've been there."
{88242}{88308}Miss Burdoe, let me walk you to your car.
{88366}{88392}You behave.
{88458}{88537}Now, Pastor Jake,|don't be messing with my piano man.
{88671}{88725}Is that how they teach teamwork|in the pros?
{88727}{88769}Humiliate your teammates?
{88789}{88812}Are you on my team?
{88815}{88857}What do you think|I've been doing down here?
{88860}{88961}- Passing out sandwiches, being ball boy?|- That's right. It's all good.
{88979}{89074}But you've got the look of a man|that's serving time. Are you on my team?
{89125}{89207}I don't have the patience or the heart|to invest in you, Ethan.
{89219}{89309}'Cause I know you're gonna walk out on us.|Just like your old man did.
{89381}{89423}Maybe it's time to go home.
{89933}{89990}- He should have been here by now.|- Relax.
{90042}{90111}- Man, he ain't supposed to bring the crew.|- It's cool.
{90131}{90206}- I got a bad feeling about this.|- I'm gonna be okay, man.
{90212}{90260}Your brother and I got history.
{90274}{90357}You made your decision.|He's just gonna have to respect it.
{90501}{90524}Tony.
{90534}{90597}Just stay out of sight, man. And pray.
{91662}{91689}Pastor Jake!
{91735}{91793}- Where's Pastor Jake?|- He's not here. What's up?
{91796}{91830}I think they killed him.
{92174}{92197}Tony.
{92386}{92475}{y:i}Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.|{y:i}Dr. Bruce, telephone.
{92702}{92761}{y:i}Here at PayDay, we understand|{y:i}how hard it is when there's an...
{92950}{92992}No, you didn't.
{93042}{93080}You son of a...
{93552}{93578}I'm coming.
{93711}{93739}Hey.
{93753}{93797}- What's going on?|- I'm okay.
{93800}{93864}Hey, what's going...|Hey, what you got on your shirt?
{93866}{93917}- I'm okay.|- Ethan!
{94049}{94104}The doctor wanted him in overnight.
{94107}{94192}And there was no way he wanted to go fight|those kids again.
{94264}{94360}I mean, what 19-year-old do we know|who would take someone else's beating?
{94399}{94424}Sorry.
{94450}{94486}What's that cash doing there?
{94489}{94545}It's $500 left over from the painters.
{94548}{94612}- Can you re-deposit it for me?|- Write a check.
{94652}{94692}Write a check next time.
{95067}{95120}Do you like it? It was going to be...
{95122}{95172}Do we really need all this stuff?
{95183}{95226}It was gonna be a surprise.
{95625}{95701}Ethan, you picked this neighborhood.
{95720}{95760}You designed this house.
{95793}{95868}I told you from the beginning|I didn't need any of this.
{95990}{96021}What's going on?
{96085}{96130}He would've died for that kid.
{96186}{96220}I couldn't do that.
{96486}{96521}I think you could.
{97129}{97187}You and me taking the kids camping again.
{97207}{97236}That's right.
{97323}{97403}- You gonna go to the doctor?|- I've been to the doctor, Sonny.
{97426}{97481}Well, maybe you should go back.
{97580}{97652}- Oh, sorry. Does it hurt?|- Yes, it hurts, Sonny.
{97665}{97714}Hurts like hell, all right?
{97717}{97768}God doesn't like it when you swear.
{97790}{97861}Let's go. Anybody seen Julius?
{98007}{98071}Hey, hey.|Start with the trash along the fence.
{98090}{98120}Julius!
{98127}{98188}Hey, man,|why you climbing in the backyard?
{98190}{98254}Don't you know we can come around|the front now?
{98277}{98339}Guess you like doing things|the hard way, huh?
{98366}{98394}Young blood.
{98398}{98422}What's up?
{98454}{98517}Gonna get you|some of that great outdoors, huh?
{98621}{98710}...they got canoeing|and horseback riding
{98713}{98818}and all kinds of games you can play,|and we can go for a hike or two.
{98843}{98884}You should've called me.
{98890}{98932}Well, he's out.
{98974}{99033}Everybody's in. Let's go.
{99542}{99582}All right, let's roll out!
{99659}{99682}Let's go.
{100985}{101008}Kali.
{101231}{101278}- What you got in your pocket?|- Nothing.
{101281}{101306}Let's see.
{101469}{101503}Let me see the bag.
{101606}{101652}Man, you been busy.
{101742}{101769}What's this?
{101827}{101865}Business is picking up.
{102229}{102254}Follow me.
{102277}{102352}All right, guys, pack it up,|go to the church, right now.
{102632}{102679}Tell him how old you are, Kali.
{102719}{102743}Go ahead.
{102761}{102789}Seven.
{102812}{102860}What else you going to tell him?
{102878}{102947}Remember? You're going to tell him,|"I quit."
{102955}{102985}I quit.
{102988}{103050}I don't think he heard you above the traffic.
{103069}{103100}I quit.
{103112}{103148}Get on back.
{103264}{103327}- Yo, I want my ends.|- Your ends?
{103330}{103380}You just made a contribution to feed
{103382}{103457}about 80 of your less-privileged|brothers and sisters...
{103460}{103483}Dude!
{103486}{103532}Dude, why you always in my business, man?
{103534}{103573}You don't know nothing about me
{103576}{103629}and you don't know nothing|about these streets.
{103690}{103760}- Give him the money, Jake.|- Yo, the bridge is closed.
{103777}{103832}Come on, Jake. Give him the money.
{103838}{103935}That's right, shoot the white man|on the bridge during rush hour. Go ahead.
{104055}{104084}Check it out,
{104133}{104157}$500.
{104160}{104207}Beat it, Gucci.|There ain't no cameras up here.
{104210}{104255}$500. Just let him go.
{104311}{104344}Check it out.
{104730}{104802}Oh, Jake. Are you all right?|Let me help you up.
{104825}{104869}- Let me help you up.|- Take it!
{104948}{105024}- Let me help you.|- I said take it! Take the money.
{105094}{105177}You don't want my help?|You can keep your money.
{105357}{105425}Albania and the Ukraine|will be operational in six months.
{105428}{105521}Nairobi will be in expansion of|our existing compound, same with Bombay.
{105530}{105569}Seems like a lot to bite off.
{105572}{105634}Well, to me|it seems like an answer to prayer.
{105638}{105719}With the infusion of capital|that comes with the city's generous offer,
{105722}{105782}we can fund these outreach centers|for five full years
{105785}{105849}without touching|our regular operational budget.
{105860}{105909}Can't we take a few more days|to pray about it?
{105912}{105980}Well, we can take the rest of the year,|but unless the city has our yes
{105982}{106074}by 10:00 a.m. Tomorrow, they're gonna|move that stadium site across the river.
{106077}{106136}Gentlemen, we knew this deadline|was coming.
{106152}{106184}Now, I know this is difficult,
{106186}{106246}but we are not here|to make decisions based on emotion.
{106248}{106320}"To whom much is given, much is required."
{106322}{106416}And good stewardship requires us|to think about God's greater plan.
{106446}{106526}Now, if there's no more questions,|I move we bring this to a vote.
{106529}{106592}- Second.|- How can we even think of voting
{106594}{106649}when the people this affects most|are not even here?
{106652}{106689}This is not their decision to make.
{106692}{106747}Well, they're going to find out about it|sooner or later.
{106750}{106789}You think they're just gonna stand by
{106791}{106840}and let the city take|a wrecking ball to their church?
{106842}{106878}The city has eminent domain.
{106881}{106929}They can do what they want,|with or without any of us.
{106932}{106995}This way everyone benefits.|Including Second Chance.
{106998}{107068}- So let them at least participate.|- Okay, look, look.
{107072}{107115}I am with Parker on this, Todd.
{107118}{107185}There is no sense in stirring anything up.
{107197}{107246}We don't need any more headlines.
{107335}{107364}All in favor?
{107762}{107791}Opposed?
{107903}{107950}One opposed, two abstentions.
{107957}{108013}I don't abstain. I quit.
{108536}{108593}Hey, Julius. It's a new day.
{108599}{108659}- Thanks for everything.|- You got it.
{108750}{108792}- Bye, Julius.|- Bye, Julius.
{109562}{109641}Yesterday, Sonny told me that he had|something on his heart
{109644}{109698}he wanted to share at staff devotions.
{109735}{109762}You ready?
{110006}{110038}I've been reading,
{110070}{110121}reading in my Bible
{110131}{110202}where Jesus did something special|for his friends,
{110227}{110261}his best friends...
{110306}{110330}Go on.
{110714}{110765}Sonny, what are you doing?
{110767}{110841}- I need to ask forgiveness.|- What are you talking about?
{110846}{110923}Remember when you said it hurt like hell
{110945}{111025}- and I said God don't like it when we swear?|- Yeah.
{111033}{111092}I was more worried about you saying "hell"
{111095}{111131}than about how you was feeling.
{111134}{111208}- Well, I shouldn't have said that, Sonny.|- I judged you.
{111211}{111289}And I ain't ever been beat up like that.
{111567}{111599}I love you, Tony.
{111638}{111676}I love you too, Sonny.
{111710}{111749}You're my best friend.
{114011}{114066}- You pay for that?|- Huh?
{114107}{114143}Did you pay for that?
{114630}{114696}Hey, give me that backpack.
{114910}{114945}You late for school.
{115391}{115479}Hey, and I want to start seeing|some rent money from your sorry ass.
{115785}{115820}You're not hungry this morning, Jake?
{115822}{115888}- No, just wondering why we're here.|- Honey.
{115942}{115975}Well, Jake,
{116006}{116059}over the past few years we've seen|the hand of God
{116062}{116133}do some amazing things|at Second Chance and...
{116158}{116215}Well, right now, if you'll all follow me,
{116226}{116337}I would just like to share with you|an exciting new vision for your ministry.
{116430}{116473}We've doubled the seating capacity.
{116475}{116513}We doubled the number of classrooms.
{116516}{116601}We got the new dorms for your women's|outreach with entirely separate entrances...
{116604}{116633}Where is the church?
{116636}{116695}- Well, the sanctuary's here.|- No. Where's our church?
{116698}{116741}This is a brand new campus, Jake.
{116744}{116828}It's on a piece of property|five miles north of our current structure.
{116831}{116861}Check this out, Mrs. Sanders.
{116863}{116921}Right here in the center|of the educational wing,
{116924}{116970}state-of-the-art kitchen. And we've got
{116973}{117053}two new mini-buses|to shuttle people up from the old 'hood.
{117076}{117144}Gentlemen, we appreciate the effort|that you put into this,
{117146}{117201}but our church|is the backbone of our community.
{117203}{117265}Well, without landmark status|the building is,
{117268}{117332}it's really just become|too expensive to maintain, I mean,
{117334}{117391}to restore it would cost|twice the price tag of all this.
{117394}{117454}I'm sorry for all the work|you've put into this,
{117457}{117522}but I'm afraid we're going|to have to vote no.
{117525}{117605}Jake, the board's already made its decision.
{117654}{117731}Parker, what are you putting here?|Hotel, parking lot?
{117754}{117805}I see the Mayor's baseball stadium.
{117821}{117913}This is a necessary step in rebuilding|our city's urban core.
{117916}{117964}- I'm not going to apologize...|- It's an off-ramp.
{117967}{118050}They're tearing down our church|for a bigger off-ramp. Unbelievable.
{118053}{118117}That baseball stadium|is going to provide economic stimulus...
{118119}{118144}For my people!
{118146}{118200}My people are lining up to sell hotdogs!
{118202}{118243}Pastor, you started Second Chance.
{118247}{118284}It's the right time, Amanda.
{118286}{118349}God's gonna use|ministries like these everywhere
{118352}{118385}to help more needy people.
{118388}{118435}Is that how you justify selling us out?
{118438}{118486}For what it's worth,|he was outvoted on this by the board.
{118489}{118576}For what it's worth, we didn't even|have a say when he ran off to the suburbs.
{118578}{118670}I plant churches, Jake. I planted yours.
{118673}{118785}And all that good that you see|going on there, I see it at The Rock.
{118789}{118846}And I want to see more of it|all over the world.
{118849}{118929}It's a global vision, Jake.|We're just trying to be good stewards.
{118932}{118984}This isn't about stewardship.
{119002}{119049}It's about money and power.
{119065}{119119}And I don't believe|Jesus spoke highly of either.
{119122}{119164}Well, what about arrogance?
{119267}{119341}I guess these things happen|when we keep our damn money.
{119381}{119443}You know what makes me crazy|about the Bible?
{119638}{119678}It says I gotta love you.
{119951}{119981}And right now,
{120039}{120101}all I want to do is beat the hell out of you.
{120393}{120439}You don't want to lose that, Pastor.
{123068}{123165}When I was a young boy of 13...
{123485}{123587}When I was a young boy,|I took my pocketknife
{123626}{123683}and carved into my bunk bed
{123699}{123749}the words of Malcolm X.
{123789}{123841}"We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
{123879}{123964}"Plymouth Rock landed on us."
{124074}{124186}Those words are still ringing|in my ears today,
{124233}{124318}because soon this sanctuary
{124341}{124405}will become smashed-up rubble.
{124458}{124539}Once again the crushing rock of injustice
{124562}{124672}leaves us with a dry, gritty taste|in our mouths.
{125121}{125158}Brothers and sisters,
{125242}{125282}I'm here to tell you
{125361}{125426}that I've traded in Plymouth Rock.
{125510}{125549}I've traded it in
{125590}{125651}for a Rock that builds me up.
{125729}{125807}I've traded it in for a Rock|that gives me dignity,
{125849}{125917}courage, and compassion.
{126074}{126173}I traded in Plymouth Rock|for the Rock of Ages.
{126382}{126448}And when we stand on the Rock of Ages,
{126494}{126590}we are required to stand tall|in the face of adversity.
{126761}{126798}When we stand
{126840}{126875}on the Rock of Ages,
{126966}{126996}we are asked...
{127085}{127108}We are...
{127183}{127213}We're commanded
{127299}{127350}- to love our enemies.|- Amen.
{128519}{128609}There's a song I learned in this place,|when I was a boy.
{128702}{128749}{y:i}On Christ the solid
{128786}{128821}{y:i}Rock I stand
{128866}{128911}{y:i}All other ground is
{128949}{128980}{y:i}Sinking sand
{129036}{129117}{y:i}All other ground is sinking sand
{129280}{129316}Most of you all know
{129341}{129403}that I didn't come to Second Chance|by choice.
{129484}{129543}I'd spent a lot of years in sinking sand,
{129583}{129623}then God called me home.
{129673}{129713}And I wanted to serve Him
{129743}{129795}as long as I could stay comfortable,
{129798}{129839}stay where it's safe.
{129899}{129957}Brothers and sisters, I want to thank you
{129990}{130021}for teaching me
{130081}{130125}that comfort is sinking sand.
{130171}{130256}Safety is sinking sand.
{130315}{130364}And even this beautiful sanctuary
{130400}{130437}wasn't built to last.
{130524}{130577}The building isn't the church, is it?
{130640}{130694}Jonesy, you're the church.
{130730}{130810}Charday, you're the church.
{130887}{130937}Sonny, Amanda,
{130985}{131008}Tony,
{131077}{131133}you all have shown me the love of Jesus
{131169}{131204}by being His church.
{131320}{131343}And Jake,
{131455}{131495}if you'll allow us,
{131516}{131591}my future wife Val and I|would love to move into this community
{131594}{131634}and be a part of your team
{131664}{131728}in whatever way you and the Lord see fit.
{132104}{132169}{y:i}My hope is built
{132172}{132244}{y:i}On nothing less
{132247}{132327}{y:i}Than Jesus' blood
{132330}{132408}{y:i}And righteousness
{132410}{132490}{y:i}I dare not trust
{132493}{132568}{y:i}The sweetest frame
{132570}{132648}{y:i}But wholly lean
{132650}{132728}{y:i}On Jesus' name
{132730}{132847}{y:i}On Christ the solid Rock
{132850}{132885}{y:i}I stand
{132888}{132966}{y:i}All other ground
{132969}{133049}{y:i}Is sinking sand
{133051}{133124}{y:i}All other ground
{133127}{133224}{y:i}Is sinking sand
{135030}{135097}- Beautiful old church.|- Yes, it is.
{135117}{135178}I wish we could've at least saved|the windows.
{135199}{135228}It's a shame.
{135840}{135871}Hey, Tony!
{135907}{135944}Some dude on the roof.
{135974}{136000}Up there.
{136149}{136199}What the hell's he doing up there?
{136326}{136368}Hey! Hey!
{136395}{136445}- Somebody's up there.|- Off the fence, boy.
{136448}{136514}- Somebody's up there.|- Get down off of this fence right now!
{136517}{136592}- Get down off the fence.|- There's somebody up there.
{136594}{136670}- Dad?|- There's somebody up there.
{136737}{136789}- You need to calm down.|- I didn't see you.
{136792}{136845}You need to calm down|before I have you restrained.
{136848}{136872}No. No.
{136984}{137014}Are you coming?
{137321}{137386}Hold up, now. You better stay down here.
{137478}{137542}You know your momma's gonna|kill us both, right?
{137736}{137778}You need to get here. Okay.
{137793}{137823}Can you open up?
{137826}{137859}- Mr. Mayor...|- Yes.
{137862}{137926}- Who's in charge here?|- I think he is.
{138059}{138085}Whoa!
{138107}{138159}Time to get some shoes|with better traction, Gucci.
{138162}{138193}- Yeah.|- Got it?
{138195}{138218}Got it.
{138338}{138367}Yeah, he's a good man.
{138422}{138478}I guess something just happened to him.
{138515}{138592}Hey, Chief. We got a situation.
{138791}{138814}Pastor!
{138837}{138884}Don't get up. Don't get up.
{138933}{139003}Dad, what are you doing?
{139038}{139093}Studying for next Sunday's sermon.
{139155}{139194}So why are you studying up here?
{139197}{139301}If I'm not studying here,|this church is coming down.
{139339}{139379}I remember you.
{139407}{139469}{y:i}This is city property.
{139472}{139556}{y:i}You are required|{y:i}to vacate the rooftop, immediately.
{139711}{139740}Okay.
{139770}{139837}Do something.|Just get these people out of here right now.
{139848}{139884}This is turning into a sideshow.
{139887}{139939}{y:i}I need all of you to leave the area.
{140012}{140124}{y:i}I repeat, you are required|{y:i}to leave the area at once.
{140290}{140325}What is she doing?
{140345}{140380}They sitting down?
{140392}{140463}No, no, no, no.
{140530}{140596}Jake, you remember the last time|we were up here?
{140677}{140723}We needed a new lightning rod.
{140731}{140776}But we didn't have any money,
{140803}{140845}so we wired up that cross.
{140873}{140953}I want to remember what it's like|to be that lightning rod.
{140974}{141077}To fear absolutely nothing|but God Almighty.
{141077}{141177}
