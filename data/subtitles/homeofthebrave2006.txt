1
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,876
Pass. Here.

2
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:52,092
Almost done.

3
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,096
I have to do this.

4
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:56,931
Excuse me, sir.

5
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,016
- Can you help out here?
- Yes, sir.

6
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,019
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

7
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,855
Have you heard the news, sir?

8
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,566
- What news is that?
- It's official.

9
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:09,735
We're headed out in two weeks, sir.

10
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,196
- No extension?
- Not this time, sir.

11
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:14,949
You hear that?

12
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:18,370
I'm going home.

13
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,458
Shebooya!

14
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,543
Just like home.

15
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,211
See what you got? Come on, Tom.

16
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:28,672
Where you going? Where you going?

17
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:32,718
Yeah, baby.

18
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,177
Yeah.

19
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,348
Bullshit.
You all run the same bullshit play.

20
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:40,184
Hey, you know the first thing
I'm gonna do when I get home?

21
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,686
Go get that herpes treated, right?

22
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:44,397
I'm gonna get some from your mama.
Then get my herpes treated.

23
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:46,065
Hey, what about Keisha?

24
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:48,443
Come over here
and sit on Daddy's anaconda.

25
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:51,738
- Play with the anaconda...
- I'll kick your white asses.

26
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:54,240
- All right, here we go. Here we go.
- He said he'd give me...

27
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:55,992
This is for Keisha.

28
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:00,122
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- I got it! I got it! Oh, shit!

29
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:03,417
Deep, deep!
He's wide open, he's wide open!

30
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:05,085
Touchdown, baby!

31
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,796
- There you are.
- So easy, so free.

32
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:09,214
Hey, Tommy.

33
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:10,758
What about you, Daydream?

34
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,217
- What're you gonna do?
- I don't know.

35
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:14,094
Maybe go rock climbing on Boulder Beach.

36
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,055
- Smoke a bowl.
- Maybe that, too.

37
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,348
I don't know, man.

38
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:20,101
Maybe buy a house, fix it up.
Something good.

39
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,729
- Now he gonna fix some shit.
- He's been fixing shit his entire life.

40
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:24,481
You know what? Fuck you.

41
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,024
Okay. Hey! Oh, hey, come on. Come on.

42
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:35,367
It's gonna be a couple of weeks
for demobilization

43
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,952
back Stateside and all, but...

44
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:38,453
No, it's for real.

45
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:43,042
No, Mom, I said, I said...

46
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,543
What're you doing?

47
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:46,796
What are you feeding him?

48
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:50,967
Mom, come on, something healthy.
I mean, a carrot or something.

49
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,802
Can you just put Ray on?

50
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:55,471
Hey, sweetheart.

51
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,640
Yeah, I'm coming home.

52
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,813
What else do you got?

53
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,857
All right. You got two boxes?
Put them in the back.

54
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:15,325
Hey, Jamal.
Let's load this bad boy up.

55
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:19,705
- What the hell is this?
- Fell off the truck this morning.

56
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,499
Wrestled it off of three guys.

57
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:25,128
My mom's Honda has better fucking doors
than this piece of shit.

58
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:29,007
No! No, no fucking way. No!

59
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:31,509
Hey, everybody's got one now.
It's the only way they're gonna learn.

60
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,303
No, no, no. Not this guy. He's bad news.

61
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:35,763
He was in the Fallujah run in July.
He was with Mendocino and Shirley.

62
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:38,349
- You know that!
- Hey, we get what we get, bitch.

63
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:39,475
Let's load up.

64
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:42,396
Motherfucker, you're as useless as an
ashtray on a motorcycle, you know that?

65
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,064
Hey! Hey, Owens!

66
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:46,442
Hey, guys, gather around, gather around.

67
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,110
- Change of plans for today.
- Change of plans?

68
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:49,862
What? No recon?

69
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:51,697
Negative, supply run.

70
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:53,407
Humanitarian.

71
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,953
We're escorting a convoy of
medical supplies and a doctor to Al Hayy.

72
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:00,539
- What the fuck's Jefferson doing?
- Yeah. Where the fuck is he going?

73
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,499
Security run to Al-Najaf.

74
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,752
Oh, come on, Sarge.

75
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:05,003
Yeah, regular army
gets all the good shit.

76
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:06,838
It's all bullshit.
- Hey!

77
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,674
This is some
good hearts and minds shit, men.

78
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:15,347
We'll be providing medical supplies
and good will to the Iraqi people

79
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:18,683
on behalf of the United States military
and its citizens.

80
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:20,477
Shut the fuck up and look at the map!

81
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,020
Where're we going, Sarge?

82
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,083
What kind of clinic is it, sir?

83
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,251
It's probably just physicals.

84
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:47,255
The Iraqis need them for work, the army.

85
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:48,882
Whatever.

86
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,721
It's your first time
outside the wire, Specialist?

87
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,139
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,225
You'll be all right.

89
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:15,159
I can't wait to get home.
I can't wait to see Ray.

90
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:18,871
Yeah, well.
And your son's gotten bigger, huh?

91
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:21,040
Oh, my God. I've missed so much.

92
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:31,552
Attention, all vehicles,
Al Hayy, 15 klicks over the ridge, Over,

93
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:33,012
Roger that.

94
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:35,055
Hey, Al Hayy's up ahead, boys.

95
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,599
We drive through
and we're 10K from supply drop.

96
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,268
Al Hayy ahead!

97
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,394
Copy that!

98
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,981
Al Hayy was the center of 1956 uprising.

99
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,358
Holy shit, the haji speaks?

100
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:48,570
Hear that, Tommy? He speaks English.

101
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,448
You do good out there today,
you get 10 minutes

102
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:52,741
in the latrine with us, all right?

103
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:55,702
Hey, hey. Let's stay focused.
Come on, no sleeping.

104
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:56,953
It's the other way!
- Right there.

105
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:58,705
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- It's the other way.

106
00:07:58,788 --> 00:07:59,914
Hey, hey, right there. Right there.

107
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,833
Be ready! Be ready! Be ready!

108
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:05,128
Turn around. Keep going.

109
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:06,588
Why you pushing?
Why you pushing?

110
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:08,715
Leave it alone.

111
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:14,013
I'm on a mission here.

112
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:15,723
What's wrong,
what's wrong with you?

113
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:24,523
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

114
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,068
Pull that up, please.

115
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:30,112
I have to make sure
you don't have any weapons.

116
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:36,787
Ten miles an hour
is plenty, You got time to...

117
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:50,634
Keep your air holes, Don't bunch up,

118
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:04,107
These humanitarian runs, man.
I don't like them.

119
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,694
I'll tell you what,
always putting ourselves in danger.

120
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:09,946
No, I think we're all right.

121
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:23,627
Son of a bitch!
That's all we need. Give him room.

122
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,214
Give him room, Don't butt up on him,

123
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:31,802
Damn it.

124
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:34,556
All right, convoy, halt, Convoy, halt,

125
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:37,767
- Gunners, stay watching dismounts,
- Shit!

126
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,019
Hey, move!

127
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:41,313
Get this truck out of the way,

128
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:42,814
Get the fuck out of the way!

129
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:44,065
Get this truck out of here,

130
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,233
I said move.

131
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:46,276
Move!

132
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,572
It's not good.

133
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:53,325
Hey. On your right.

134
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:55,453

135
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:58,748
- Move the truck!

- Move!
- Let's go! Move! Move!

138
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,255
Where's the interpreter?

139
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,341
Come on, let's go, We don't have all day,

140
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,385

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,180
- Move! Move! Move!
- Come on, Kamal, get going.

Get down!

147
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,786
- Jesus Christ! Shit!
- Did one of the gunners get shot?

148
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,289
Come on, get out, get out, get out!

149
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:46,005
- Jordan!
- Here!

150
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:49,676
Oh, my God!

151
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:55,723
Holy shit!

152
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,102
- It's okay! Back up! Back up! Back up!
- I'm trying!

153
00:10:58,227 --> 00:10:59,228
Let's get out of here!

00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,688

Let's go.

165
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:40,313

00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:02,502
Hallway left! Hallway left!

175
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:03,712
Clear.

176
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,176
Grenade!

177
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:10,969
Move it!

178
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,102
- Son of a bitch.

179
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:20,771
- Yeah.
- One weekend a month, my ass.

180
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:22,273
Yeah. Free beer and haji hookers, right?

181
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:24,067
Bravo team, secure the next building,

182
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,360

- Let's move!

185
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:29,489
Casualties!

00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,324
Casualties! Shit!

187
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:33,117
Duck! Duck!

188
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,959
- Fucking road isn't even marked here.
- It's gotta be!

189
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:42,920
We've got to get back to the main road.

190
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,630
Looks like if we hang a right
500 meters up

191
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,923
- we're gonna be okay.
- Okay.

192
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,467
It'll take us right back to the access road
and we can get out of here.

193
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,760
Okay.

194
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,431
Take deep breaths. Take deep breaths.

195
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,516
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,601
- You gonna puke?
- No, sir.

197
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,312
Bravo team! Let's move.

198
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,023
- Get going! Somebody else on top!
- Go, go, go!

199
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,151
Check the roof! Check the roof!

00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:07,988
Doorway! Let's move!

201
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:11,032

Jamal, you all right?

208
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:28,259
Hey, come on, man. Stay with us.
We gotta stay together.

209
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:30,970
- Tom...
- Let's go, Jordan! Let's go, come on!

210
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:34,015
Up the stairs. Up the stairs. Let's move.

00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:36,017
Clear.

212
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:37,810
Door on left. Door on left.

213
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:39,395
Jamal, cover back.

214
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:40,521
One up!

215
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:41,814
Oh, shit!

Let's go, Jordan, over here left!
Left! Left! Left!

258
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,495
Get back. Get back.

259
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,416
Around the corner. Around the corner.

260
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,085
- Let's move! Let's move!

Go! Go! Go, Jamal, go! Jordan, go!

263
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,349
My back.

264
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,976
Jamal! Jamal, you all right? You hit?

265
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:17,269
My back.

Let's go. Come on.

268
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,777
Fuck you and die!

269
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,528
Where'd they go?

270
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,823
Big pot of shit, man.
The more you stir it, the more it smells.

271
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,075
Bravo 4.

272
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,494
Yeah, Alpha 5, we got a man down.
Send up a medic.

273
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,997
One block west from your location. Over.

274
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,500
Delta team's on its way, with medic.

275
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,294
Requesting additional backup
for pursuit. Over.

276
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,088
There's no backup for pursuit,

277
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:45,507
Proceed with Delta team
to casualty-collection point.

278
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:46,967
- Over!
- Roger that.

279
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:49,511
There's no backup.

280
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:51,012
Don't want any.

281
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:52,472
The medic's on its way.

282
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:55,643
Let's go. Let's get these fuckers.
Let's move. Come on.

283
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,019
Tommy!

284
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:58,396
I've been hit.

285
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:01,482
- You all right?
- Yeah, move.

286
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:04,485
- Go! Go!
- Medevac's coming. I'll be right back.

287
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:08,239
Shit.

288
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,252
All right. I'm going after him.

289
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:21,545
I'll cover you.

290
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,354
I think I got him!

291
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:40,940
Hey, Tommy, I think I got him!

292
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:04,506
Jordan!

293
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:07,801
No!

294
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:12,514
You're good.

295
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:15,309
No! No!

296
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:18,437
Sarge, we need a Medevac right away!

297
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,398
Jordan's down! He's been shot!

298
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:22,942
Two hundred meters
west of your position.

299
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,152
Stay with me.

300
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:26,196
Medevac is en route,
Medevac is en route, ETA is one minute,

301
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,031
That's one minute, Over,

302
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,867
Sergeant, hurry the fuck up!

303
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,621
They're already on their way, soldier,
They're on their way, Tommy,

304
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:36,039
Hang in there, Over,

305
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,707
Come back. Come back.

306
00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:53,391
Stay with me.

307
00:18:58,062 --> 00:19:00,523
Stay with me. They're almost here.

308
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,111
We're gonna get you home.

309
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,280
I'll get you home. Stay with me.

310
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:07,594
Daddy's here! Daddy's here!

311
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,597
There's Daddy! There's Daddy!

312
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:15,727
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Dede!

313
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:24,778
Hey, babe.

314
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,418
Welcome home.

315
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:46,635
- Thank you, sir. Thanks.
- God bless.

316
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,012
Here you go.

317
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:08,908
Look what I have.

318
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,494
Not too rare, Will.
- I remember.

319
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,831
You want the one with cheese, honey?

320
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:16,666
Baby, how about you help
Mommy cut up the fruit?

321
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,585
- I wanna stay with Daddy.
- Daddy's busy right now.

322
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,713
- Come on, honey.
- Where's Billy?

323
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:23,339
I think he went out.

324
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:28,846
Went to counsel four years ago,
but...

325
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:31,515
And there was such a backlog
they forgot all about it.

326
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:34,518
So they finally put it down
and it's a two-way, not a four-way.

327
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:36,186
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

328
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,438
Do those people know
what they're doing down there?

329
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:38,522
They don't.

330
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:41,191
Is that baby kicking yet?
- Oh, yes, he is.

331
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:42,818
When he's hungry.

332
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,863
- Dad, how's the food?
- It's lovely.

333
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,410
- We're gonna cut into that cake soon.
- Yeah, looks great. I'll have some.

334
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:52,996
Not yet. Not yet.

335
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:57,834
I'm going inside for a minute.
Anybody need anything?

336
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,336
- No, I'm great, thanks.
- No, thanks.

337
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:04,007
- So.
- Just back this morning, huh?

338
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,550
Yeah, four hours ago.

339
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:06,885
He looks great.

340
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:56,083
Attention!

341
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,711
Present!

342
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:36,124
Attention!

343
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:14,957
- Hi.
- Hey.

344
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:16,834
It's good to see you.

345
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:56,417
We'll be inside.

346
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:00,338
Hey, what's up?

347
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:04,426
Hey, Tom.

348
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:21,818
Hey.

349
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:24,030
Hi.

350
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:26,032
Where's Molly?

351
00:26:26,157 --> 00:26:27,575
We're not together.

352
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:30,828
Dear John letter.

353
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:32,538
You know how that goes.

354
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:48,514
You look different.

355
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:52,768
- Older?
- Your eyes. They...

356
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:56,397
It's like they're looking over my shoulder,
you know?

357
00:26:57,231 --> 00:26:58,732
Sadder, maybe.

358
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:02,361
Sorry.

359
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:05,615
Was he a hero, Tommy?

360
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,037
He died defending his country.

361
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:13,373
That doesn't answer my question.

362
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:15,208
- It's the truth.
- Stop it.

363
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:17,210
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

364
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:19,587
He was doing his job.

365
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:21,881
And he was damn good at it.

366
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:24,217
Sorry.

367
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:34,311
He's cute.

368
00:27:34,603 --> 00:27:36,439
When's he coming to see you?

369
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,444
- I don't know.
- What?

370
00:27:41,652 --> 00:27:44,447
He is fine. If you don't want him,

371
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:46,407
then send him my way.

372
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,578
Are you ready for therapy?

373
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:52,831
Do I have a choice?

374
00:27:52,956 --> 00:27:54,958
Not if you wanna get out of here.

375
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:01,214
Everything's gonna be okay.

376
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,727
They'll page me when you're done.
Good luck.

377
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:05,115
Jordan had this stuff sent to me.

378
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:07,617
I'm not sure why, but...

379
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,662
Well, you were his buddy.

380
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:12,540
He loved you, too, right?

381
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,459
Right.

382
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,009
God.

383
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:25,136
I always hated this picture.

384
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,138
He carried that with him
everywhere he went.

385
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:28,264
God.

386
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:32,060
What's this?

387
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:34,312
This is called a God's eye.

388
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,940
Some kid in Baghdad gave it to him.

389
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,985
- An Iraqi kid?
- Yeah.

390
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,154
I thought they all hated us.

391
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:43,822
Not all of them.

392
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,369
What's this one?

393
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:51,705
It's the Combat Infantry Badge.

394
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:54,375
These other two right here,

395
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,588
they're from letters of recommendation
but this is the CIB.

396
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,883
It's one all the soldiers wanted.

397
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,593
Means you fought hard.

398
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,231
I gave this to him.

399
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,348
There she is.

400
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,310
Vanessa!

401
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:07,410
Hi, honey.

402
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,079
You look so grown up.

403
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,081
Can you say "Hi" to Mommy?

404
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,875
Yeah? Can you say "Hi" to Mommy?

405
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,508
You look so thin.

406
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:23,927
Hey.

407
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:25,303
You look great.

408
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:26,847
Yeah, Ray, right.

409
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:39,902
Crackers are coming.

410
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:41,279
What is the matter, Ray?

411
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:43,072
How's it going?
Has everybody got everything?

412
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:44,115
Ray, crackers.

413
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:45,241
Yeah, the crackers.
Yes, they are right here.

414
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:46,325
I'm sorry about that.

415
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:20,257
Dede, that's really good
how you stay inside the lines now.

416
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,175
- Thank you, Daddy.
I'm out.

417
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:23,511
You're gonna be late.

418
00:33:23,594 --> 00:33:26,222
Davis is picking me up. I'll eat in the car.

419
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:29,308
Seahawks have a game
against the Patriots Sunday night.

420
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:31,102
Perhaps you two should go.

421
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,687
Both of them suck this year.

422
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,189
Well, then maybe Dr. Benton
won't be using his tickets.

423
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:38,234
We can get the same ones
we had last year, 10 rows up, 50-yard line,

424
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,528
- spend the night in the city.
- I'm busy.

425
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:41,988
Busy doing what?

426
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:43,865
Thought you liked football.

427
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:46,952
Did you read that in
one of your brochures or something?

428
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:49,371
"Invite your child on favorite activities,

429
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:51,457
"and re-establish familiar bonds."

430
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,542
- Billy, what's gotten into you?
- Mom!

431
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:54,877
Give me a break.

432
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:58,047
You guys are so obvious.

433
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:00,549
I'm out.

434
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:04,511
- Dede, go get your knapsack.
- But I want Daddy to get it.

435
00:34:04,636 --> 00:34:05,972
Now, sweetheart.

436
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:11,061
You all right?

437
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:12,354
Yeah, sure.

438
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:13,938
Did you sleep at all?

439
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:15,648
Yeah.

440
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:18,610
No, honestly, I did.

441
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:24,824
- See you later.
- Okay.

442
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,146
The faculty wanted to do something,
but we weren't really sure...

443
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,606
It's okay, really.

444
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:57,067
You sure you're ready for this?

445
00:34:58,402 --> 00:34:59,778
Yes, sir, I'm ready.

446
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:01,613
Well, good luck.

447
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:42,489
You were gone a while, Tommy.

448
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:45,200
- Like a year.
- Fifteen months, actually.

449
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:48,370
There's kind of a law that says
you have to hold my job until I get back.

450
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:49,913
But I hired someone else.

451
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:51,958
I had to. You were full-time.

452
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,420
That's the point, Zander.
This was my full-time job.

453
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,672
You knew I was coming back eventually.

454
00:35:57,797 --> 00:36:00,091
I guess. I hoped so.

455
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:03,303
You know what I mean.

456
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,347
- Yeah.
- Look, Tommy,

457
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,307
I only have four employees.

458
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,309
You know that.
What did you think I was gonna do?

459
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:10,852
Look, I'll put a word in
with Tyson over at REl.

460
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,521
No, don't worry about it.

461
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:16,275
I need to find something
closer to home anyway.

462
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,944
Since I'm not gonna
be crashing at Molly's anymore.

463
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:22,281
I'm real sorry, man.

464
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:24,408
Yeah, it's cool.

465
00:36:25,242 --> 00:36:26,494
You sure, now?

466
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:29,789
'Cause I don't want you going
all psycho on me or anything.

467
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:34,044
So how was it? You shoot anybody?

468
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:38,090
Yeah, I did.

469
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,967
Did you kill anybody?

470
00:36:42,844 --> 00:36:45,972
I don't know, Zander.
I didn't stick around to find out.

471
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:47,683
It's war.

472
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:51,478
- Look, man, I gotta...
- Sure.

473
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:54,232
Look, you come back whenever, okay?

474
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,234
10% off. Military discount.

475
00:36:57,985 --> 00:36:59,028
10%.

476
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:01,197
Brock's Gun Shop. This is Zander.

477
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:05,451
No. No, I'm sorry. We're all out of those.
I can get them for you next week.

478
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,000
Take any of the brochures now or you
can come down to the recruitment center

479
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:17,506
as we'd love to have you
in the Army family.

480
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,059
Shit!

481
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:33,397
Hey, let me give you a hand.

482
00:37:33,522 --> 00:37:35,984
- It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.
- I got it. It's all right.

483
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:37,360
Just some mud on there.

484
00:37:37,485 --> 00:37:38,945
It's okay. It's okay.

485
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:41,406
You must be Vanessa Price.

486
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:44,367
Well, what gave that away?

487
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:46,244
I'm Cary Wilkens.

488
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:50,290
I teach boys' P.E., but I've been teaching
your girls the last eight weeks.

489
00:37:53,418 --> 00:37:54,502
Long day?

490
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:57,882
Yeah. Takes some getting used to.

491
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,551
So, you wanna grab a cup of coffee
or something?

492
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:02,970
I could fill you in on your students...

493
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:05,097
- I don't think so. But thanks.
- You sure?

494
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:06,891
- Yeah. No, I'm sure.
- You know, some kids are mean...

495
00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:08,893
Okay.

496
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:11,729
I got it. I got this.

497
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:16,108
- Just trying to help.
- I know, but I got it.

498
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:18,737
It's nice to meet you, Vanessa.

499
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:26,495
Fuck!

500
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:53,648
Will?

501
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,735
Scott Martinez hit a homerun
in the 15th inning, won the game.

502
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,074
Five hours. Unbelievable.

503
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:04,910
Come back to bed, baby.

504
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,079
Can't sleep.

505
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:09,623
Don't you have surgery
tomorrow morning?

506
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:15,045
Will, what happened over there?

507
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:18,799
I don't really remember.
You know, it's like a dream.

508
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:21,010
Hazy dream.

509
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:23,304
Then tell me.

510
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:27,392
I wanna know.

511
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,936
Do you?

512
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:33,648
Wanna know
what a blast wound looks like?

513
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:37,277
What an OR in the desert smells like?

514
00:39:38,695 --> 00:39:40,196
What really happens to them?

515
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,782
How they die?

516
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:44,785
You really wanna know?

517
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:49,331
You want us to come back
like nothing ever happened.

518
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:53,044
You don't want to get your hands dirty
with the details.

519
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:55,713
That's not fair at all.

520
00:39:56,047 --> 00:39:58,132
Do you really think I don't care?

521
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:01,469
If you wanna tell me, then tell me.
And maybe you're right.

522
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:04,890
Maybe I don't wanna hear about
what happened to the rest of them.

523
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:07,267
But I would like to know
what happened to you.

524
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,005
Two tickets. Here you go.

525
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,298
There you go,

526
00:40:39,842 --> 00:40:41,302
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you?

527
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:42,762
Good, thanks.

528
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:46,266
Two adults and one child for
Forever Lulu at 1:30.

529
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,643
All right.

530
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,104
Okay, That is $20,50,

531
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:52,147
Okay.

532
00:40:57,444 --> 00:41:00,406
Out of $21. There you go.

533
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:02,533
I know you.

534
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,327
181st?

535
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:07,831
Bravo Company,

536
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:09,916
First of the 161st,

537
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:12,877
951st Maintenance Company.

538
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:15,338
Hua,

539
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:17,882
Hua.

540
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:20,510
You wanna go in
and I'll be there in just a minute?

541
00:41:20,635 --> 00:41:22,679
I'll go... I'll be in right after you. Okay.

542
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:28,185
Don't worry.
I checked for snipers a couple hours ago.

543
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,812
Jesus.

544
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:32,189
- Cute kid.
- Thanks.

545
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,900
One day he acts up
like you wouldn't believe

546
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,611
and then the next he won't let me
out of his sight.

547
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,949
So how you doing?

548
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,744
Okay.

549
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,163
I lost my best friend over there.

550
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:50,125
- God, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

551
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:52,377
It's been pretty tough since...

552
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:54,880
Fuck.

553
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:58,884
They changed up my medication.
It makes me all weepy.

554
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,012
- Zoloft?
- Lexapro.

555
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:05,348
- Really? That makes me way too anxious.
- Really?

556
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:07,559
I had that problem with Risperdal.

557
00:42:07,684 --> 00:42:09,812
- Vicodin?
- Every now and again.

558
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:12,732
But I was actually on Resperidone,
but then I got moved to Celexa.

559
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:14,567
Now I take Ambien for sleeping.

560
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:17,111
Ambien? Now come on.
Trazodone all the way.

561
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:20,490
Would you listen to us?

562
00:42:20,615 --> 00:42:22,742
We sound like a couple of junkies.

563
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,790
You know,
sometimes I can't sleep at night.

564
00:42:28,915 --> 00:42:31,627
- Yeah.
- So I flip it over to The History Channel.

565
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:33,212
I love The History Channel.

566
00:42:33,295 --> 00:42:35,172
- You watch The History Channel?
- Yeah.

567
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,799
The other night, it was like 4:00 a.m.,

568
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:39,426
and they had this special
on D-day and Normandy, okay?

569
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:43,055
And it was like, about these small towns,
Caen and Bayeux,

570
00:42:43,138 --> 00:42:46,725
and how they loved Americans
and they loved Allied soldiers.

571
00:42:47,017 --> 00:42:49,436
And they have statues of Eisenhower

572
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:51,689
and plaques thanking the Americans.

573
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,901
I don't know, I just started thinking that...

574
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:58,863
I mean, what if like 10, 15 years from now,
we go back...

575
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:01,866
Do you think that they'll
have statues thanking us

576
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,326
and plaques and...

577
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,994
'Cause we saved them, we liberated them.

578
00:43:05,078 --> 00:43:06,246
Right.

579
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:10,458
I don't know.

580
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,793
Yeah.

581
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:13,546
I don't know, either.

582
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:18,259
You know,
I work at this fucking movie theater

583
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:21,554
and sell these stupid tickets
for these stupid movies.

584
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:25,516
But I don't ever go see any of them.

585
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:27,935
Just seems all so unimportant, you know?

586
00:43:28,018 --> 00:43:29,937
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

587
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,234
I mean, I see all these people
driving these gas-guzzling SUVs,

588
00:43:34,317 --> 00:43:37,279
getting their Frappuccinos from Starbucks.

589
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:39,281
Doing all this crap with their normal lives,

590
00:43:39,406 --> 00:43:41,783
and they don't give a shit
what's going on over there.

591
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,662
Yeah. I gotta tell you it makes me wanna
go back there so goddamn bad.

592
00:43:46,288 --> 00:43:48,081
I know what you mean.

593
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:51,293
I mean, I barely know you.

594
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:53,503
But I'm sitting here with you

595
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:56,716
and I feel like I've known you
my entire life.

596
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,884
Yeah.

597
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:00,595
And then there's all those people
that I actually do really know.

598
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:02,638
And now, I just don't feel
like I know them at all.

599
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:04,474
I feel the exact same way.

600
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:07,435
It's like nothing makes any sense
anymore, does it?

601
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:08,561
Yeah.

602
00:44:09,979 --> 00:44:12,565
On D-Day,
behind Bradley's first army,

603
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:14,442
another army is sent,

604
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:15,903
Patton's third,

605
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,489
He told them to get mad and stay mad,

606
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,366
They listened,

607
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,285
Giving credit, instilling pride,

608
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,746
urging men to even greater deeds,

609
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,956
Then, the green light,

610
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,598
Kidding me.
Watch where you're fucking going!

611
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,398
Fuck with me.

612
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,738
Get the fuck out of the way!

613
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:40,950
You fucking turn?

614
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,875
Who is this guy?

615
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:57,091
Oh, Jesus.

616
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:58,718
Shit.

617
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,593
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- What's up?

618
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:20,262
- Hey.
- Nice uniform.

619
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:21,555
At least I won't get shot at.

620
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,515
Depends on the movie theater.

621
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:25,101
- He's in back.
- Back.

622
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,148
Damn it.

623
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,066
I'll take a look.

624
00:47:32,191 --> 00:47:33,568
Hey, old man.

625
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:35,445
Hey, Mike Falcone call you?

626
00:47:35,528 --> 00:47:37,321
Yeah. Said there's another exam
a week from Saturday.

627
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:39,449
And than I take the physical
when my leg gets better.

628
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:41,033
That sounds good, Tommy.

629
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,953
- We'll see, I guess.
- Look. Come on. Police is a good job.

630
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:46,040
Did me right for 25 years.

631
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,084
- Serving popcorn is no career.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

632
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:50,419
Look, you stay on top of it.

633
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:52,296
$15,000 saved up
isn't going to last forever.

634
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:55,632
Hey, Pop, I'm doing it. All right? Relax.

635
00:47:58,802 --> 00:48:02,723
Your mother comes into your room
sometimes at night and you're not there.

636
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:04,308
I like to drive around.

637
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:06,811
- In the middle of the night?
- Yeah.

638
00:48:10,106 --> 00:48:11,441
You know, I...

639
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,985
I've been thinking about
going and talking to someone.

640
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,279
About what? Your feelings?

641
00:48:17,072 --> 00:48:19,949
- You sound like your mother.
- No! No, I just think of a lot of shit...

642
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:22,327
Why don't you wait
until you get the police job?

643
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,661
Because they'll find out.

644
00:48:23,745 --> 00:48:26,081
And you don't want them
thinking you're a pussy.

645
00:48:26,164 --> 00:48:29,001
What are you saying?
'Cause I'm not a pussy.

646
00:48:56,071 --> 00:48:57,406
Hey, buddy.

647
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,325
What do you got?

648
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:03,036
What is that? Hi. Hi. Hi.

649
00:49:05,997 --> 00:49:08,166
- Hey.
- Hi.

650
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:12,505
- Hey, babe. How're you doing?
- Hey. Good.

651
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:15,216
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

652
00:49:15,758 --> 00:49:16,926
Not bad, huh?

653
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,220
Ray's staying for dinner.

654
00:49:20,054 --> 00:49:22,348
No, tonight's not a good night, actually.

655
00:49:23,182 --> 00:49:25,518
I'm just... I'm really tired.

656
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:28,896
So, if we can just do it another time.

657
00:49:30,064 --> 00:49:31,859
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

658
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:33,610
Sure.

659
00:49:36,196 --> 00:49:38,198
I'm gonna give you a call later,
though, okay?

660
00:49:38,282 --> 00:49:39,241
- Yeah.
- Okay.

661
00:49:40,868 --> 00:49:42,369
Thanks, Alice.

662
00:49:43,787 --> 00:49:45,205
See you, kid.

663
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:36,134
Mommy.

664
00:50:36,426 --> 00:50:37,969
Get out of here, Oliver.

665
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:39,513
But it's Ray.

666
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,015
Tell him I'll call him back.

667
00:50:54,445 --> 00:50:56,280
We turned the. 50 cals on him.

668
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:57,949
And he doesn't stop.

669
00:50:58,032 --> 00:51:00,284
He's coming right at us.

670
00:51:01,702 --> 00:51:04,205
He could have a bomb. We don't know.

671
00:51:05,581 --> 00:51:07,375
There's no way to know.

672
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:11,254
But he doesn't stop.

673
00:51:14,465 --> 00:51:15,968
So I open fire.

674
00:51:17,761 --> 00:51:19,346
I have no choice.

675
00:51:19,972 --> 00:51:21,432
I tear him up.

676
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,145
It's him or us, right?

677
00:51:27,396 --> 00:51:30,983
Then we drove by fast as hell
and I looked back to see if I got him.

678
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:33,736
Then we were gone.

679
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:38,074
And you still think about it?
- Yeah.

680
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:43,204
Whether I really saw
a woman, a girl and a baby all shot up...

681
00:51:43,288 --> 00:51:45,957
- So what's your problem then?
- What do you mean?

682
00:51:46,082 --> 00:51:47,959
You did what was right.

683
00:51:48,251 --> 00:51:50,295
The rules of war were followed.
There was an imminent threat.

684
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:52,338
Haji didn't get the memo. Get over it.

685
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:54,549
It's not always that simple.

686
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,176
This is bullshit, man.

687
00:51:56,301 --> 00:51:58,637
They told me this was a class.
I want information.

688
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:00,806
I need my discharge paperwork
and help with that,

689
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:02,933
my disability applications
and help with that.

690
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,436
Some people think this is helpful.

691
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:08,564
Whatever.

692
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,150
You've got everything under control,
right, son?

693
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:13,235
When did you serve, Gettysburg?

694
00:52:14,528 --> 00:52:15,696
Saigon.

695
00:52:15,821 --> 00:52:16,947
Jesus.

696
00:52:18,617 --> 00:52:19,993
Thirty years out?

697
00:52:20,744 --> 00:52:22,954
No way in hell
I'm gonna be coming back here.

698
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:24,915
You're obviously angry, Jamal.

699
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:28,085
- Do you wanna tell us why?
- No, why don't you tell me why.

700
00:52:28,752 --> 00:52:30,003
Why what?

701
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:32,631
Why I get these headaches
and I still can't sleep right.

702
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:35,592
Why I can't walk right
because my back's still fucked up.

703
00:52:35,675 --> 00:52:38,762
Why Keisha wouldn't kiss me
the first two months I was home?

704
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:41,849
Why it takes the army six weeks
to set the medical for my discharge

705
00:52:41,974 --> 00:52:44,852
and they canceled it and they
rescheduled it and then canceled it again?

706
00:52:44,977 --> 00:52:47,814
Why I can't look at you right now
without wanting to kick your face in?

707
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:50,066
- Especially you, Doc.
- Hey, Jamal, Jamal.

708
00:52:50,191 --> 00:52:51,150
What the hell happened to you, man?

709
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,485
What, you want to
pile some shit on me, too, Tommy?

710
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:53,736
No, I'm not trying to pile anything on you.

711
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:55,405
What the hell are you doing here?

712
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,198
Tommy Daydream, ladies and gentlemen.

713
00:52:57,323 --> 00:52:59,700
Movie-star looks and a future so bright.

714
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:01,829
- You two know each other?
- Tell him.

715
00:53:02,287 --> 00:53:04,415
Tell him. Tommy takes one in the leg.

716
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,625
His buddy gets a dozen in the chest.

717
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,169
Well, God smiles down
on Tommy Daydream.

718
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,967
Fuck you, Jamal. Fuck you.

719
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:17,803
Fuck me? No, fuck you.

720
00:53:17,886 --> 00:53:19,680
Yeah, go ahead. Get out.

721
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:21,348
Get the fuck out.

722
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:24,018
Get your own goddamn group.

723
00:53:24,227 --> 00:53:25,937
This is my goddamn group.

724
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:31,359
Nobody else ain't got nothing else
they wanna say?

725
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,368
How's that?

726
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:42,078
That hurts.

727
00:53:42,328 --> 00:53:44,331
I'm having pain all the time.

728
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:46,417
- Pain or discomfort?
- Pain.

729
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:49,044
Because discomfort
is nothing to worry about.

730
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,716
Right there.

731
00:53:55,468 --> 00:53:57,845
All right. It's probably the prosthesis.

732
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,680
We can try and adjust it.

733
00:54:00,097 --> 00:54:01,348
Thank you.

734
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:05,228
And I can prescribe some medication
to help with these phantom pains.

735
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:07,105
No more medication.

736
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:10,275
It's up to you.

737
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:14,279
These just came in.
You wanna take a look at that?

738
00:54:17,032 --> 00:54:19,367
I'll recommend
some more therapy as well.

739
00:54:24,122 --> 00:54:25,708
What the hell is this?

740
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,710
Take a look at the last one.

741
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:29,337
Fishing attachment?

742
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:31,756
$21,000?

743
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:34,092
Don't worry about it.
The army will pay for it.

744
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:35,760
As many as you need.

745
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:40,181
Might be something that you and your
boyfriend or husband can do together.

746
00:54:40,598 --> 00:54:42,100
Help you pass the time.

747
00:54:45,603 --> 00:54:49,108
Do you think they have one
where you can give people the finger?

748
00:54:49,942 --> 00:54:52,694
Or, maybe a flat palm with a spike in it?

749
00:54:54,238 --> 00:54:56,573
You know,
for when I smack my kid around.

750
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:58,867
Because when I really
put my shoulder into this,

751
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:01,078
this thing just goes flying across the room.

752
00:55:01,203 --> 00:55:03,580
It's kind of getting to be
a little bit of a problem, Doc, you know?

753
00:55:03,705 --> 00:55:06,166
Because if I could just keep my kid in line,

754
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:08,294
and not have to go digging for this thing

755
00:55:08,336 --> 00:55:12,424
then maybe, just maybe, I'd have
a little bit more time for some fly-fishing.

756
00:55:13,758 --> 00:55:15,385
Thank you. No, thank you.

757
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,763
It's your choice.

758
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:31,193
Vanessa! Hey!

759
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:33,779
Ray, what are you doing here?

760
00:55:33,904 --> 00:55:35,281
Your mom told me where you were.

761
00:55:35,364 --> 00:55:37,825
- Vanessa, this is crazy.
- I just gotta go.

762
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:40,911
Why don't you return my calls?

763
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:43,497
Ray, you know why.

764
00:55:43,622 --> 00:55:44,999
No, I don't.

765
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:46,625
I really don't.

766
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:50,005
Wait a minute.

767
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:52,340
Please, don't just walk away.

768
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:54,050
It's over, Ray.

769
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,720
- It's over. Don't you get it?
- What did I do?

770
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,889
At least tell me that. What did I do?

771
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:01,391
It's not about you, it's about me.

772
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:05,103
Okay. You wanna be alone? Fine.

773
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,939
I've tried comforting you,
I've tried giving you space.

774
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:11,611
But you are just so damn determined
to be pissed off at the world!

775
00:56:13,654 --> 00:56:16,699
I guess it only takes
one good hand to push people away.

776
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:19,494
Take care of yourself, Vanessa.

777
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:29,337
Levels are good, steady.

778
00:56:29,462 --> 00:56:30,923
- Knife.
- Doctor.

779
00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:35,344
Retraction.

780
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:39,348
- Are you feeling all right, Doctor?
- Respiration's steady.

781
00:56:39,431 --> 00:56:42,643
I am feeling a bit under the weather.

782
00:56:43,602 --> 00:56:44,853
Dr. Breeder,
would you finish for me, please?

783
00:56:44,937 --> 00:56:46,438
- Yes, certainly.
- Thank you.

784
00:57:19,682 --> 00:57:20,933
Dr. Marsh?

785
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:23,227
There's a Vanessa Price here to see you.

786
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:25,896
- Who?
- She says she knows you from Iraq.

787
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:35,866
Oh, my God!

788
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:37,951
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

789
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:39,411
- Come in.
- You, too. Thanks.

790
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:44,541
Thank you.

791
00:57:46,084 --> 00:57:48,044
How are you? Are you all right?

792
00:57:48,128 --> 00:57:50,088
Yeah, everything's fine.

793
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:52,424
I had an appointment
at the V.A. Hospital this morning,

794
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,760
and one of the nurses there
gave me your address.

795
00:57:54,885 --> 00:57:57,597
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

796
00:57:57,722 --> 00:58:02,685
I just... I thought about you, and I realized
that you were in the neighborhood.

797
00:58:03,352 --> 00:58:04,687
So I took the day off of work and thought,

798
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:07,273
"Well, you know,
today I'm gonna do doctors."

799
00:58:08,191 --> 00:58:09,442
So,

800
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:12,737
they couldn't save it, then.

801
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:15,490
No. No. FST took it off.

802
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:19,912
I spent the night in Baghdad,
and then went over to Landstuhl.

803
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,831
I mean, I don't remember it. It's just...
It's just what they told me.

804
00:58:22,915 --> 00:58:25,084
- Then to Walter Reed?
- Yup.

805
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:27,211
Walter Reed for a month,

806
00:58:27,294 --> 00:58:29,379
fitted, and then back home.

807
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:31,215
Walter Reed. Right?

808
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,509
You wanna see some tough Americans.

809
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:35,427
- Yeah, I can imagine.
- Yeah.

810
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,764
But I mean, I'm one of the lucky ones.

811
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,642
I got my legs, I got most of my arms...

812
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,269
I can hold my kid and I...

813
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,355
And I really try to remember that.

814
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,565
You must've seen a lot
while you were there.

815
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,275
Yeah, I saw a lot.

816
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,364
You really look good.

817
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,949
Thanks.

818
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,746
You know, at Walter Reed,
they took us on these outings

819
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,541
to help us, you know,
kind of, get used to it.

820
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:07,211
And people would thank us,
and then, you know, they would stare,

821
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,088
and that would make me really,
really angry.

822
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:12,633
And then they would ignore me
and it would make me really angry.

823
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:16,929
- I just... I don't know...
- Do you need anything?

824
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,391
Prescription?

825
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:22,060
Jesus, everybody's just trying to drug me.

826
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:24,396
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
Look, I just thought maybe...

827
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:26,314
I'm... I'm really not here for that.

828
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:31,820
I just, you know,
I really just wanted to see your face again.

829
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,575
You're a hero. At least to me.

830
00:59:39,453 --> 00:59:40,788
Thank you.

831
00:59:42,874 --> 00:59:44,459
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

832
00:59:45,376 --> 00:59:46,669
Dr. Marsh.

833
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:49,297
What?

834
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:53,342
Is he there now?

835
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:57,513
Okay. All right, I'll be right over.

836
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:03,270
I'm sorry, I have to go.

837
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,398
It's good to see you.

838
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:07,816
Thanks. You, too.

839
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,320
If you're ever in the neighborhood again,
you need anything,

840
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,655
you know, call me, stop by.

841
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:15,240
Thank you.

842
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,495
The conduct policy's very clear.

843
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:22,665
No baseball caps, no cell phones,

844
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:24,584
no clothing with
offensive pictures or slogans.

845
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:25,919
No clothing with
offensive pictures or slogans.

846
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,213
Show them.

847
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:32,133
Where did you get that?

848
01:00:32,175 --> 01:00:34,010
The mall. What's the big deal?

849
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:37,680
We have teachers here who have friends
and loved ones who've served in Iraq.

850
01:00:37,764 --> 01:00:40,433
They were quite upset.
We can't have this here.

851
01:00:40,517 --> 01:00:42,560
- Well, actually, my husband's...
- Can't have what, opposition?

852
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:44,480
The garment is offensive, Dr. Marsh.

853
01:00:44,563 --> 01:00:46,232
Of course it is. That's the point.

854
01:00:46,398 --> 01:00:49,610
If you want to raise your children
to oppose American institutions,

855
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:51,529
I guess that's entirely your right.

856
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:54,490
But this is a public school
and we have rules.

857
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,700
Okay, so why don't we have him
take it off right now,

858
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:58,869
you call an assembly and you can burn it,

859
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:01,414
along with some books from the library
and today's newspaper.

860
01:01:01,539 --> 01:01:02,706
- Will...
- And while we're at it,

861
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:05,001
let's get a list of all the students
who are opposed to the war,

862
01:01:05,085 --> 01:01:08,046
make them come to school on Saturday
and take patriotism classes

863
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,132
and monitor their e-mails
and their cell-phone calls.

864
01:01:10,257 --> 01:01:11,216
Dr. Marsh!

865
01:01:11,341 --> 01:01:12,634
Buck Fush?

866
01:01:14,052 --> 01:01:16,179
Buck you, you son of a bitch.

867
01:01:16,263 --> 01:01:18,223
- Will!
- Let's go. Come on.

868
01:01:18,932 --> 01:01:19,933
Come on.

869
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,277
Hey, that was really cool, Dad.

870
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,612
Yeah, well, you're grounded for a month.

871
01:01:31,696 --> 01:01:32,780
What?

872
01:01:33,406 --> 01:01:35,408
We'll talk about it when we get home.

873
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:37,493
So you're against the war, huh?

874
01:01:37,577 --> 01:01:39,620
You don't know a damn thing about it.

875
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:42,457
It's not a war, it's an occupation.
They hate us.

876
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,625
They're trying to build a country.

877
01:01:44,709 --> 01:01:46,920
We did the same thing here
a couple of hundred years ago.

878
01:01:47,045 --> 01:01:48,964
- It's not easy.
- Yeah. Right.

879
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:50,716
And we're doing a good job at it.

880
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,886
Maybe if we flushed a couple more
Korans down a toilet in Guantnamo,

881
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:55,554
it'd help them speed things up.

882
01:01:55,637 --> 01:01:58,056
So you think we should just leave, huh?

883
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:00,559
Let them rip each other to pieces?

884
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:03,520
It's not an easy decision, is it?

885
01:02:03,604 --> 01:02:05,063
Some bad guys over there, Billy.

886
01:02:05,147 --> 01:02:07,232
Dad, what bad guys?
What is this, a Schwarzenegger movie?

887
01:02:07,317 --> 01:02:09,068
- Hey.
- Why don't you just admit it,

888
01:02:09,194 --> 01:02:11,946
we went over there for oil
and everything else is just bullshit.

889
01:02:11,988 --> 01:02:14,491
- Watch your mouth.
- That's the problem with you people.

890
01:02:14,574 --> 01:02:16,201
You're never wrong, are you?

891
01:02:16,284 --> 01:02:17,869
We're not wrong.

892
01:02:18,078 --> 01:02:19,579
Since when did our country decide
it was our job

893
01:02:19,704 --> 01:02:21,748
to just piss everybody else off?

894
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:25,668
You don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

895
01:02:25,752 --> 01:02:27,337
- Will.
- You should read a history book.

896
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,464
I will,

897
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:29,715
when you go read a newspaper!

898
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:32,093
I don't have to. I was there!

899
01:02:38,516 --> 01:02:39,934
Let's go now.

900
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:44,271
No, you're walking.

901
01:02:44,355 --> 01:02:45,940
- What?
- Fine!

902
01:03:11,884 --> 01:03:13,928
Keisha. Where's Keisha?

903
01:03:15,263 --> 01:03:16,389
Keisha.

904
01:03:18,307 --> 01:03:19,350
- There you go.
- Thanks.

905
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:22,019
Keisha, I wanna talk to you
for just a minute.

906
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:23,396
Jamal, I'm working.

907
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:25,356
I know you're working.
I just need to talk to you for a minute.

908
01:03:25,481 --> 01:03:28,151
- I promise I won't get upset.
- Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

909
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:45,627
The handle broke off
the kitchen cabinet again.

910
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,796
Can you take a look at it after dinner?

911
01:03:47,963 --> 01:03:49,047
Sure.

912
01:03:49,673 --> 01:03:51,049
Where's Dede?

913
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,470
She's eating at Jenna's.

914
01:03:53,636 --> 01:03:55,221
You don't know her.

915
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:57,056
Can you get this, honey?

916
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:05,440
Thank you.

917
01:04:05,565 --> 01:04:09,027
You know if you cut the brake lines
on the car, I can't fix that.

918
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:10,737
What're you talking about?

919
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:15,993
I don't think it was good for you
defending Billy in there today.

920
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:18,704
Half the kids in that school can't read,

921
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:21,207
and they're worried about
what's written on some damn T-shirt.

922
01:04:21,332 --> 01:04:22,958
I'm worried about our son.

923
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:24,752
Don't. He hates me.

924
01:04:25,002 --> 01:04:27,213
He hates that you're in the military.

925
01:04:27,671 --> 01:04:30,216
All 15-year-olds hate their parents.

926
01:04:30,508 --> 01:04:33,886
I guarantee, if I was a pacifist
he'd be in Fallujah by now.

927
01:04:34,011 --> 01:04:35,806
You're driving me crazy.

928
01:04:35,889 --> 01:04:38,141
You need to stop breaking stuff
around the house.

929
01:04:38,225 --> 01:04:40,060
- I know what you're doing.
- I'm trying to get through to you.

930
01:04:40,185 --> 01:04:41,520
You're not helping me, Pen.

931
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:44,064
You're making me feel
like a mental patient.

932
01:04:44,272 --> 01:04:46,858
- Now there's an idea.
- Very funny.

933
01:04:47,526 --> 01:04:49,528
You smelled like a bar at Billy's school.

934
01:04:49,694 --> 01:04:50,862
Do your patients know?

935
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:53,532
I am handling it.

936
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:57,578
- Now leave me alone.
- No, I will not leave you alone. I'm sorry.

937
01:04:57,703 --> 01:05:00,456
Do you think you're the only one
who's had it rough?

938
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,708
I was the one
who got up every single morning

939
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,794
and went online
to check that casualty list.

940
01:05:04,877 --> 01:05:06,754
And I was the one
who got sick to my stomach

941
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:09,048
every time I heard about
another roadside bomb.

942
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:11,259
And who do you think
told our daughter every night

943
01:05:11,384 --> 01:05:13,845
that Daddy wasn't coming home
tomorrow or the next day,

944
01:05:13,928 --> 01:05:16,097
or the day after that,
but that he still loved her

945
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,391
and me?

946
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,477
Now I understand you feel compelled
to serve and I supported that.

947
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:22,104
Hell, I left my job and got another one

948
01:05:22,229 --> 01:05:25,357
just so one of us would be home
some of the time with our daughter!

949
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:28,235
And when you asked to extend
your deployment, I supported that, too.

950
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,530
Because I think what you did
was right and noble.

951
01:05:31,613 --> 01:05:34,950
But I did not spend the last eight months
of my life in sheer hell

952
01:05:35,033 --> 01:05:37,745
for you to come home and be an asshole!

953
01:05:56,097 --> 01:05:58,391
This is the third time
I've been back and forth here.

954
01:05:58,517 --> 01:06:01,312
I got a problem with my back, okay?
I don't get around good.

955
01:06:01,395 --> 01:06:03,022
I'm going back and forth,

956
01:06:03,105 --> 01:06:05,232
downtown, back here,
downtown, back here,

957
01:06:05,357 --> 01:06:07,318
and I sit here
and come talk to you people.

958
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:09,028
And you sit here looking at me
like you don't understand

959
01:06:09,111 --> 01:06:10,237
what the fuck I'm talking about!

960
01:06:10,362 --> 01:06:11,405
Somebody here got to have information.

961
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:14,700
Don't tell me this is the first
damn discharge papers you've seen!

962
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:17,411
And you're sitting there like you don't
understand what the fuck I'm saying!

963
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:19,748
Somebody better tell me something
in this motherfucking...

964
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:24,544
Hey, Doc.

965
01:06:25,212 --> 01:06:26,797
Hey, how you doing?

966
01:06:26,922 --> 01:06:28,924
Hey, I'm good. I'm good. You?

967
01:06:29,424 --> 01:06:30,592
I'm great.

968
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:32,177
Hey, you remember me?

969
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:34,137
You helped wash out my leg.

970
01:06:34,387 --> 01:06:36,098
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

971
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:39,309
- Good to see you.
- Yeah. You okay?

972
01:06:39,434 --> 01:06:40,770
Yeah, yeah.

973
01:06:41,062 --> 01:06:42,313
I'm supposed to meet a patient here.

974
01:06:42,438 --> 01:06:45,233
Actually, pick up a prescription
for a patient.

975
01:06:45,942 --> 01:06:47,819
They don't really hand that shit out.

976
01:06:47,944 --> 01:06:50,363
Yeah, well. It's more of a consult.
I can't really talk about it.

977
01:06:50,446 --> 01:06:51,656
Right, right.

978
01:06:51,906 --> 01:06:53,783
There's some good people there.

979
01:06:53,866 --> 01:06:56,869
I'm sure whoever needs a consult,
that'll really help.

980
01:06:57,954 --> 01:06:59,038
Yeah.

981
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:02,167
- Good to see you.
- It was good seeing you, too.

982
01:07:58,768 --> 01:07:59,894
Fight!

983
01:08:01,312 --> 01:08:02,480
Hey, you!

984
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:03,689
Hey.

985
01:08:04,523 --> 01:08:06,610
All right, enough.
Stop it. Break it up right, you two!

986
01:08:06,693 --> 01:08:07,652
Right now! Stop it!

987
01:08:07,819 --> 01:08:10,238
Hey! Hey! That's it! That's it!

988
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:12,866
Move! Move!

989
01:08:15,494 --> 01:08:16,995
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

990
01:08:17,078 --> 01:08:19,331
- Come on, let's go.
- I said I'm fine.

991
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,503
- Let's go back to class! Come on.
- Okay, it's over. Just go back to class.

992
01:08:24,628 --> 01:08:25,587
Go.

993
01:09:14,472 --> 01:09:16,641
- Damn it, Oliver!
- I'm sorry, Mommy.

994
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,564
I'm sorry. Come here. Come here.

995
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:24,065
Why are you crying?

996
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,777
Mommy just gets
a little bit sad sometimes.

997
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:30,072
- You mad at me?
- I didn't mean to yell.

998
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:32,032
But I love you.

999
01:09:34,243 --> 01:09:36,203
I love you so much, baby.

1000
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:17,330
- Hello,
- Hi.

1001
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,623
Is Cary there, please?

1002
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:20,750
Yeah, this is Cary, Who's calling?

1003
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:23,669
Oh, hi. This is Vanessa Price.

1004
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:27,548
- I'm really sorry to be calling this late.
- No, No, it's all right,

1005
01:10:27,632 --> 01:10:30,426
It's just... I could really use your help.

1006
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,098
Well, yes, sure, You wanna talk?

1007
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:35,933
Yeah.

1008
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,894
How about tomorrow before school?
We can grab some coffee or something,

1009
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:40,604
Great. Great, thank you.

1010
01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:48,946
Hello.

1011
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:52,282
What?

1012
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:54,494
Where is he?

1013
01:10:54,994 --> 01:10:56,287
All right.

1014
01:11:10,176 --> 01:11:12,595
Been in there for about an hour.
Kept asking for you.

1015
01:11:12,762 --> 01:11:14,306
You guys work together or something?

1016
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:16,392
Yeah. Yeah, we worked together.

1017
01:11:17,852 --> 01:11:19,687
You don't have to go in there
if you don't want to.

1018
01:11:19,812 --> 01:11:21,313
It's all right.

1019
01:11:36,913 --> 01:11:37,998
Jamal!

1020
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:42,335
- What's up, man?
- I'm coming in, all right?

1021
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:03,608
What're you doing, man?

1022
01:12:04,233 --> 01:12:07,987
I don't know, boss.
Just like the job, this wasn't working out.

1023
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:10,323
What job is that?

1024
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:12,617
The job at this dealership, man.
You know about that.

1025
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,410
Right. Right.

1026
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,710
She wouldn't see me.

1027
01:12:22,377 --> 01:12:24,087
Who wouldn't see you?

1028
01:12:24,213 --> 01:12:25,339
Keisha.

1029
01:12:26,381 --> 01:12:27,883
She wouldn't see me,

1030
01:12:27,966 --> 01:12:31,053
so I had to make her see me.
You know what I'm saying?

1031
01:12:31,178 --> 01:12:32,221
Yeah.

1032
01:12:35,974 --> 01:12:38,061
Thought she was one of them, Tommy.

1033
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:43,191
Like I turned and wasn't no time.

1034
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:46,152
They don't give you no time.

1035
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,655
Right.

1036
01:12:52,867 --> 01:12:56,996
Jamal, what do you say
we go back to the center,

1037
01:12:58,373 --> 01:13:00,793
and we'll talk to someone, get some help.

1038
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,962
- You come with me?
- Yeah.

1039
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,256
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

1040
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:08,384
First you gotta give me that gun.

1041
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,221
I like my gun.

1042
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,057
I know you like your gun.

1043
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,853
But come on, man,
you don't wanna do this.

1044
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,231
I'll come with you.

1045
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,781
Anything for you, Daydream.

1046
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,244
Oh, shit.

1047
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,455
Got movement.

1048
01:13:43,838 --> 01:13:45,256
- Shit!
- Jamal!

1049
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:49,218
Jamal! God damn it!

1050
01:13:50,094 --> 01:13:51,220
Jamal!

1051
01:13:56,684 --> 01:13:57,643
Fuck!

1052
01:14:03,859 --> 01:14:05,027
Damn it!

1053
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:09,072
Jamal.

1054
01:14:18,749 --> 01:14:20,042
Go! Go! Go!

1055
01:15:34,495 --> 01:15:36,414
Mike Falcone called me.

1056
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:40,585
He said you never showed up
for your appointment at the Academy.

1057
01:15:40,668 --> 01:15:43,838
Yeah. I thought it was, like, a possible...

1058
01:15:43,921 --> 01:15:45,631
He was holding a spot for you.

1059
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:47,801
- Jesus, Tommy!
- So maybe I'm not ready yet,

1060
01:15:47,885 --> 01:15:49,219
even if you want me to be ready.

1061
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:51,847
What I want you to stop watching
Band of Brothers, smoking dope

1062
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:54,892
- and playing video games all day!
- Fine. Maybe I should just re-enlist, huh?

1063
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,728
Maybe that's all I'm really fucking good at
is fucking killing people!

1064
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:00,397
- Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
- Fuck you!

1065
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:02,441
You don't know
what it's fucking like over there!

1066
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,067
You don't know
what the fuck I went through!

1067
01:16:04,193 --> 01:16:06,320
Fuck you! Stay the fuck away from me.

1068
01:16:06,445 --> 01:16:08,656
- Damn!
- Stop!

1069
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:23,004
- It's okay.
- I couldn't get to him...

1070
01:16:23,087 --> 01:16:26,800
It's okay. Don't. Don't.

1071
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:29,512
It's okay.

1072
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:32,973
I couldn't save... Couldn't save him.

1073
01:16:33,682 --> 01:16:38,687
It's okay. It's okay, Tommy.
It's all right, Tommy.

1074
01:16:43,067 --> 01:16:45,861
- You all right, Dede?
- We're gonna wait for your father.

1075
01:17:34,621 --> 01:17:36,081
What the hell?

1076
01:17:36,582 --> 01:17:38,500
Can't work on a holiday.

1077
01:17:52,556 --> 01:17:53,516
Think I ate too much.

1078
01:17:55,101 --> 01:17:57,604
Penelope, hello.
Come on, come on, come on.

1079
01:17:57,729 --> 01:17:59,397
Will, where have you been?

1080
01:18:00,607 --> 01:18:04,152
Look, this is Hector,
Rodrigo and... I forget.

1081
01:18:04,235 --> 01:18:07,280
But they were working on Thanksgiving

1082
01:18:07,405 --> 01:18:09,199
so I invited them to our house for dinner.

1083
01:18:09,282 --> 01:18:11,201
Baby, we have guests. My father...

1084
01:18:11,701 --> 01:18:13,286
- Carl, hey!
- Will.

1085
01:18:13,578 --> 01:18:15,247
- How're you doing, man?
- Baby, go lie down.

1086
01:18:15,372 --> 01:18:18,083
No, no, no. It's Thanksgiving.
You don't lay down on Thanksgiving.

1087
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:20,628
Come on, come on, guys.
Come on, let's eat.

1088
01:18:20,753 --> 01:18:23,130
Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.

1089
01:18:23,464 --> 01:18:24,924
You know what?

1090
01:18:25,549 --> 01:18:27,551
Since it's Thanksgiving,
I think I should say a few words.

1091
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:28,928
Don't worry. Hold on, hold on.

1092
01:18:30,763 --> 01:18:32,765
I know, you're all thinking,

1093
01:18:32,848 --> 01:18:36,019
"Is he gonna do
or say something crazy? What?

1094
01:18:37,437 --> 01:18:39,815
"The drunk, violent fool

1095
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,192
"back from a year in the desert."

1096
01:18:42,275 --> 01:18:44,402
Yeah, but don't worry. Don't worry.

1097
01:18:45,529 --> 01:18:47,239
I'm not going to do anything like that.

1098
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,116
I know I get drunk,

1099
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,953
and I get angry
and it can get to be a bit much.

1100
01:18:53,411 --> 01:18:55,914
But that's how I'm dealing with it.

1101
01:18:56,749 --> 01:19:00,336
If that impacts on your life in a bad way,
then I'm sorry.

1102
01:19:00,962 --> 01:19:03,047
And I'm gonna make it right. I promise.

1103
01:19:03,131 --> 01:19:05,466
But we're not gonna talk about that.

1104
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:08,553
Let's talk about what we're thankful for.

1105
01:19:08,636 --> 01:19:11,013
And I'm thankful for my family

1106
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:14,809
and my friends. And my new friends.

1107
01:19:14,976 --> 01:19:16,894
And I'm also thankful

1108
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:19,815
that I live in a country

1109
01:19:19,982 --> 01:19:25,154
where I can eat till I'm full
three times a day, seven days a week.

1110
01:19:26,989 --> 01:19:28,657
And I'm thankful for

1111
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:31,118
two-ration beef with mushroom sauce,

1112
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:34,329
and heat and dust and roadblocks

1113
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:36,790
and Haji Pepsi,

1114
01:19:36,874 --> 01:19:39,294
and kids who run up and hug you,

1115
01:19:39,836 --> 01:19:41,838
and kids who spit at you,

1116
01:19:41,963 --> 01:19:45,633
and mothers having babies faster
so they can grow up to kill you.

1117
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,262
And the boys,

1118
01:19:50,388 --> 01:19:54,392
who are young and brave and scared,

1119
01:19:55,727 --> 01:19:57,270
and the Kevlar

1120
01:19:57,979 --> 01:20:02,818
propped against upside-down M-16s
with boots next to them,

1121
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:09,325
Boys with wives and fiances and babies

1122
01:20:09,533 --> 01:20:11,202
and mothers and fathers.

1123
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:14,872
Boys who just wanna come home.

1124
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:19,668
And they do come home,

1125
01:20:20,377 --> 01:20:23,507
maimed and haunted and fucked up,

1126
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:26,760
if they come home at all.

1127
01:20:31,223 --> 01:20:33,266
But, hey, hey, it's Thanksgiving.

1128
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,268
Let's eat, enjoy ourselves.

1129
01:20:35,393 --> 01:20:37,437
- Carl, you saved me that drumstick?
- Of course, Will.

1130
01:20:37,562 --> 01:20:41,358
All right. Come on, come on, guys.
Let's get something to eat now. Come on.

1131
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,156
Grab some of these good comidas,
Mi casa es su casa,

1132
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,701
Come on. This is great.
Thanksgiving. All right.

1133
01:20:51,202 --> 01:20:53,663
Hey, what is that? What the fuck is that?

1134
01:20:53,746 --> 01:20:55,998
- Dad, what're you doing?
- What is that!

1135
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:01,671
Back off me!

1136
01:21:04,341 --> 01:21:06,343
- Get over here, boy.
- I'm... I'm...

1137
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:08,554
- Get away from me!
- What's with you?

1138
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:12,224
It's okay, baby.

1139
01:21:12,641 --> 01:21:14,601
- He pulled it out.
- My God.

1140
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:23,318
Will.

1141
01:21:28,074 --> 01:21:29,367
Put it down.

1142
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:34,038
We'll get you help.

1143
01:21:34,747 --> 01:21:36,458
Think about me and Dede.

1144
01:23:12,475 --> 01:23:14,394
We all grew up together,

1145
01:23:15,311 --> 01:23:17,772
Me and Jordan,
we lived on the same block,

1146
01:23:19,023 --> 01:23:21,693
He and I used to play football, basketball,

1147
01:23:23,444 --> 01:23:24,654
Anyway...

1148
01:23:32,121 --> 01:23:33,664
He died in Al Hayy.

1149
01:23:35,499 --> 01:23:37,835
We just got word we were coming home.

1150
01:23:39,378 --> 01:23:42,673
We were all pretty excited, you know?
Yeah.

1151
01:23:47,178 --> 01:23:49,013
He was my buddy, you know?

1152
01:23:52,267 --> 01:23:54,269
And I didn't get to him in time,

1153
01:23:56,897 --> 01:23:58,231
And when,

1154
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:02,527
when I was holding him,

1155
01:24:03,278 --> 01:24:05,238
when I was holding him,

1156
01:24:06,531 --> 01:24:10,702
it wasn't like I saw his eyes close
or you know, anything like that.

1157
01:24:14,165 --> 01:24:17,585
I just felt this... Just felt this vibration

1158
01:24:19,712 --> 01:24:21,297
and he was gone.

1159
01:24:22,799 --> 01:24:24,091
And now,

1160
01:24:26,427 --> 01:24:28,012
now I've been back for, you know,

1161
01:24:28,095 --> 01:24:30,348
some time now,
trying to make sense of all the shit.

1162
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:37,981
What I do know is,

1163
01:24:41,902 --> 01:24:43,695
I don't belong here anymore.

1164
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,785
Shit.

1165
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,669
Right here, Rudy. Over the top.

1166
01:24:58,086 --> 01:25:00,296
We don't have to talk
about the war today,

1167
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:01,923
We've made some good progress,

1168
01:25:02,048 --> 01:25:03,883
Even coming in here was a good first step,

1169
01:25:06,344 --> 01:25:08,888
It's not like they gave me a choice, Doctor.

1170
01:25:10,056 --> 01:25:11,516
No, it's okay.

1171
01:25:12,475 --> 01:25:14,227
I wanna tell it, actually.

1172
01:25:20,109 --> 01:25:22,111
I'd been in Balad about a month.

1173
01:25:23,988 --> 01:25:27,366
Was 130 degrees, sand was in everything.

1174
01:25:28,242 --> 01:25:29,577
It was awful.

1175
01:25:31,453 --> 01:25:34,206
We heard mortars all the time,

1176
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:36,918
but we never got anything serious.

1177
01:25:38,962 --> 01:25:41,089
I'd just finished a 12-hour shift.

1178
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:44,801
I was exhausted, ready to go to sleep.

1179
01:25:46,219 --> 01:25:47,637
When all hell broke loose.

1180
01:25:57,356 --> 01:25:58,774
Look alive, people!

1181
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:01,569
Heads up! Let's hit it! Let's go!

1182
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:11,287
Incoming CASEVAC! MASSCAL situation!
What's your name, son?

1183
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:13,539
Pulse 120. Let's get a tie-off here.

1184
01:26:13,623 --> 01:26:16,209
I need two units of plasma
to this soldier right away!

1185
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:17,877
How you doing, soldier?

1186
01:26:19,254 --> 01:26:22,466
Pulse rapid and thready!
Let's get some QuickCIot over here now!

1187
01:26:23,592 --> 01:26:24,968
Hold your head up, son.

1188
01:26:25,302 --> 01:26:27,513
Come on, help me! I'm hit!
Radio for help!

1189
01:26:29,389 --> 01:26:32,184
Okay, you'll be okay.
Go outside. Go outside. Go.

1190
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:34,311
You guys, you can't be in here.

1191
01:26:34,436 --> 01:26:36,271
I need that blood back here now!

1192
01:26:36,396 --> 01:26:37,606
Medevac's on its way from Taji.

1193
01:26:37,689 --> 01:26:38,941
- ETA?
- One minute.

1194
01:26:39,067 --> 01:26:41,236
- Somebody alert the chaplain.
- Okay.

1195
01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:42,570
- Please get off me!
- All right.

1196
01:26:42,654 --> 01:26:43,738
I need you guys to wait outside.

1197
01:26:43,822 --> 01:26:45,573
No, no, no! We're not fucking waiting!

1198
01:26:45,657 --> 01:26:48,618
You all got to fix him.
Do something. Fix him, Doc!

1199
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:51,871
I will do that, but I need you to go outside.

1200
01:26:51,955 --> 01:26:54,207
- Motherfucker, you fix him...
- Just calm down.

1201
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:56,042
What are you doing?

1202
01:27:00,589 --> 01:27:03,676
- Blood pressure's dropping.
- I need that QuickCIot now!

1203
01:27:03,884 --> 01:27:06,011
Starting chest compressions. Go!

1204
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,161
Elevate. Elevate. Put his legs up.

1205
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:35,792
I amputated six arms and legs
in three hours.

1206
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,504
Four soldiers died on the table,

1207
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,506
all under the age of 20.

1208
01:27:43,885 --> 01:27:47,305
I mean, I saw all that...

1209
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:50,266
And I'll always have that.

1210
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,270
But there's that...

1211
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:59,400
that moment when you realize
you can't help someone,

1212
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:03,197
and you feel heartbreak.

1213
01:28:05,407 --> 01:28:07,868
And then the shame

1214
01:28:09,536 --> 01:28:11,914
because you couldn't do your job.

1215
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,878
It was an unusual situation.

1216
01:28:18,545 --> 01:28:19,796
A crisis.

1217
01:28:21,089 --> 01:28:22,132
During war...

1218
01:28:22,257 --> 01:28:24,844
Doctor, I know all that,
but it's not about that.

1219
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:26,554
It's...

1220
01:28:32,936 --> 01:28:34,729
I don't feel anything.

1221
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:37,690
I'm supposed to feel something, right?

1222
01:28:37,857 --> 01:28:41,361
When you treat a patient
you're supposed to feel something.

1223
01:28:45,616 --> 01:28:47,368
Well, I don't feel anything.

1224
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,833
I didn't even know their names.

1225
01:29:29,412 --> 01:29:32,081
You know, I was kind of surprised
you called me, actually.

1226
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:35,084
After what you were like that first day...

1227
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:37,545
- Really?
- You don't remember this?

1228
01:29:37,628 --> 01:29:41,257
You don't remember this? That first day
when I'm helping you out at the car.

1229
01:29:41,883 --> 01:29:44,760
You were like, "I'm fine. I'm fine.
Leave me alone."

1230
01:29:45,303 --> 01:29:47,930
- I kind of remember that. Yeah.
- You remember that?

1231
01:29:48,765 --> 01:29:49,766
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1232
01:29:49,892 --> 01:29:51,268
I'm just giving you a hard time.

1233
01:29:51,351 --> 01:29:53,479
I know, but that's really
kind of inexcusable.

1234
01:29:53,604 --> 01:29:54,605
No.

1235
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:57,441
I just have a really hard time
trusting people.

1236
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:01,987
- You haven't been seeing anybody?
- You mean like a shrink?

1237
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:06,492
No, no. I meant, have you had
a boyfriend since you got back?

1238
01:30:07,284 --> 01:30:08,535
No.

1239
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:14,209
I was seeing somebody before I left,
but that just didn't work out.

1240
01:30:18,922 --> 01:30:20,673
What happened to your hand?

1241
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:34,855
We were in this city, in Al Hayy,

1242
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:38,567
and I was part of a convoy of trucks.

1243
01:30:38,651 --> 01:30:41,946
We were driving into the city.

1244
01:30:43,447 --> 01:30:45,115
It was hot as hell,

1245
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:48,160
and dusty and horrible and...

1246
01:30:50,162 --> 01:30:53,375
Just driving into the center of the city

1247
01:30:53,959 --> 01:30:58,505
and something started to go really weird.
And the truck in front of us...

1248
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:01,633
The trucks in front of us,
they got ambushed.

1249
01:31:02,384 --> 01:31:04,302
So the rest of us,

1250
01:31:06,638 --> 01:31:10,809
we took another road

1251
01:31:10,934 --> 01:31:14,272
to try to get back around to the main road
that we were on.

1252
01:31:15,314 --> 01:31:18,860
And I saw this little kid,

1253
01:31:20,069 --> 01:31:23,322
with a Tootsie Pop or something.
I don't know what he had.

1254
01:31:23,447 --> 01:31:25,408
I just remember this kid.

1255
01:31:26,576 --> 01:31:31,289
And we turned this corner
and we just drove and...

1256
01:31:34,293 --> 01:31:35,586
Explosion.

1257
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:37,921
Just a big explosion.

1258
01:31:39,673 --> 01:31:41,008
And it was a...

1259
01:31:42,176 --> 01:31:45,304
It was just a bomb on the road,
on the side of the road.

1260
01:31:49,349 --> 01:31:51,351
I don't remember anything.

1261
01:31:54,313 --> 01:31:56,065
Just that I was told I was...

1262
01:31:57,484 --> 01:31:59,027
I was very lucky.

1263
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:14,709
I have a confession to make.

1264
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:19,507
I wasn't helping you that day
because of your hand.

1265
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,845
It's 'cause I thought you were...

1266
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:29,225
'Cause I thought you were so beautiful.

1267
01:32:32,895 --> 01:32:34,188
- Beautiful?
- Mmm.

1268
01:32:36,273 --> 01:32:37,359
What?

1269
01:32:37,859 --> 01:32:38,902
What.

1270
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:41,988
I don't know. Beautiful?

1271
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:44,908
And divorced at 24

1272
01:32:45,075 --> 01:32:47,828
and one kid and one hand.

1273
01:32:47,911 --> 01:32:49,913
Especially with one kid and one hand.

1274
01:32:51,998 --> 01:32:52,999
Hey.

1275
01:33:18,151 --> 01:33:21,113
- Hi.
- Hi.

1276
01:33:26,618 --> 01:33:28,120
You all right?

1277
01:33:30,664 --> 01:33:32,916
Let's just take it slow, okay?

1278
01:33:33,584 --> 01:33:34,585
Yeah.

1279
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,493
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's all right.

1280
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:13,542
Hold on.

1281
01:34:13,792 --> 01:34:15,002
All right.

1282
01:34:16,128 --> 01:34:17,963
- Do you wanna get that?
- I'll get that.

1283
01:34:18,631 --> 01:34:20,090
I'll get this.

1284
01:34:26,348 --> 01:34:29,059
- All right, now what?
- Just that...

1285
01:34:29,309 --> 01:34:31,603
- Just pull that.
- It's stuck. I'm trying to pull it.

1286
01:34:31,686 --> 01:34:33,522
It's definitely stuck.

1287
01:34:35,148 --> 01:34:36,483
How do you do this?

1288
01:34:36,608 --> 01:34:39,361
I don't know, I've never done this before.

1289
01:34:42,447 --> 01:34:43,658
Fuck it.

1290
01:34:47,954 --> 01:34:49,580
Stop laughing.

1291
01:34:54,418 --> 01:34:55,962
This is serious.

1292
01:35:13,313 --> 01:35:15,482
I was thinking maybe we could talk.

1293
01:35:18,735 --> 01:35:19,903
Okay.

1294
01:35:20,654 --> 01:35:23,574
I'll talk and you can just listen.

1295
01:35:27,203 --> 01:35:29,289
I'm sorry about what I did.

1296
01:35:29,831 --> 01:35:31,207
I was wrong.

1297
01:35:32,834 --> 01:35:36,254
I've got some issues.

1298
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,048
And I'm getting some help with that.

1299
01:35:39,507 --> 01:35:42,135
In fact, your mom and I are
seeing someone

1300
01:35:42,218 --> 01:35:44,762
and we think that
at some point down the road

1301
01:35:45,054 --> 01:35:48,559
it'd be good if you went with us
maybe once or twice.

1302
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:50,394
Dede, too.

1303
01:35:51,437 --> 01:35:55,524
But you can make up your mind
about that when the time comes.

1304
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:04,533
I know you're against the war.

1305
01:36:05,201 --> 01:36:06,870
And I can respect that.

1306
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:13,585
But are you against the war in principle
or because I was part of it?

1307
01:36:19,382 --> 01:36:20,467
Both.

1308
01:36:45,409 --> 01:36:48,079
- Well, I talked to him.
- Good.

1309
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:54,711
- So what you doing?
- Paying bills. Nothing important.

1310
01:37:02,135 --> 01:37:03,428
I love you.

1311
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,646
I love you, too.

1312
01:37:14,148 --> 01:37:16,359
Can you look at me when you say that?

1313
01:37:26,452 --> 01:37:27,745
I love you.

1314
01:37:29,622 --> 01:37:31,667
I love you very, very much.

1315
01:37:35,004 --> 01:37:36,255
Thank you.

1316
01:38:34,107 --> 01:38:35,067
Bye.

1317
01:38:45,828 --> 01:38:47,538
Dear Mom and Dad,

1318
01:38:48,288 --> 01:38:51,166
I know you don't understand
why I re-enlisted,

1319
01:38:52,084 --> 01:38:54,753
It's confusing and scary for all of us,

1320
01:38:54,837 --> 01:38:56,214
I know that,

1321
01:38:56,756 --> 01:38:58,633
But I have to go back,

1322
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,178
I don't wanna die
and Jordan didn't wanna die, either,

1323
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:03,930
And maybe when we went over there
the first time

1324
01:39:04,013 --> 01:39:06,391
we didn't know
what we were getting into,

1325
01:39:06,808 --> 01:39:10,270
Maybe the leaders of our country didn't
know what they were getting into,

1326
01:39:10,353 --> 01:39:11,771
Maybe the people don't want us there,

1327
01:39:11,813 --> 01:39:14,524
Maybe this whole thing
is just making it worse,

1328
01:39:15,985 --> 01:39:17,486
But even after all that,

1329
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:19,530
I can't stay behind
knowing there are soldiers over there

1330
01:39:19,655 --> 01:39:22,157
getting attacked every day
and dying every day,

1331
01:39:23,659 --> 01:39:25,035
I don't feel like it's wrong of me

1332
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,830
for wanting to go back over there
and help them,

1333
01:39:33,752 --> 01:39:35,504
It's a hard job being a soldier,

1334
01:39:35,588 --> 01:39:39,009
Not just for people like me,
but for the people we leave behind,

1335
01:39:39,217 --> 01:39:43,597
The both of you, girlfriends,
kids, husbands and wives,

1336
01:39:44,055 --> 01:39:46,057
We all carry scars of war,

1337
01:39:46,224 --> 01:39:49,227
But I know that if I do my part
then maybe we'll all get out of there

1338
01:39:49,352 --> 01:39:51,813
and get home to the people
who love us just a little bit quicker,

1339
01:39:51,897 --> 01:39:53,648
- This is my wife, Penelope.
- Hello.

1340
01:39:53,732 --> 01:39:55,025
- Daughter, Dede...
- Hello.

1341
01:39:55,108 --> 01:39:57,360
...and that's Billy.
- Nice to meet you.

1342
01:39:57,527 --> 01:40:00,698
- How you doing? Great game today.
- Thank you.

1343
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,701
We're going to get something to eat now.

1344
01:40:03,826 --> 01:40:05,870
- You guys wanna go?
- Sounds good.

1345
01:40:06,037 --> 01:40:08,122
I hope this can
make sense to you,

1346
01:40:08,623 --> 01:40:10,875
Because it makes perfect sense to me,

1347
01:40:11,959 --> 01:40:14,420
These are my guys and I need them

1348
01:40:14,962 --> 01:40:17,131
just as much as they need me,

1349
01:40:22,596 --> 01:40:25,224
I'm not trying to be noble or brave,

1350
01:40:25,933 --> 01:40:28,852
But I feel, if I don't go
then I'd fail Jordan, Jamal,

1351
01:40:28,936 --> 01:40:32,231
and all those who went over with me
and sacrificed so much,

1352
01:40:32,648 --> 01:40:35,442
And that'd be worse
than never coming home at all,

1353
01:40:36,401 --> 01:40:38,362
I know you aren't happy with this,

1354
01:40:38,529 --> 01:40:40,615
but I also know that you love me,

1355
01:40:41,032 --> 01:40:42,492
I'm going back,

1356
01:40:42,951 --> 01:40:45,745
And I'm going back to do
the best job I know how,

1357
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:48,331
And get back to you as soon as I can,

1358
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,876
Pray for me,
