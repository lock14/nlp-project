00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:30,876
Dear Wendy, I'm writing to tell you
the story about the two of us-

3
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:37,716
- as I saw it, but never had the
nerve to tell you face to face.

4
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:42,262
Maybe things would have gone
differently if I had told you then.

5
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:48,713
And maybe things would not
have to end this way.

6
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:54,149
I've lived in Electric Park Square
all my life.

7
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,779
And all my life the wheel from
the elevator tower was creaking.

8
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,200
We called it the Ferris wheel.

9
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:09,873
But now, as I write this
I can't see the square, -

10
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:13,961
- and I can't hear the creaking.

11
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:21,456
And worst of all
I do not have you next to me.

12
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,311
OK, Susan...

13
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:36,692
Here are your round-nosed
full metal jackets.

14
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:44,733
Freddie, these are yours.
I got hollow-point expanders. 32s.

15
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:46,846
I was stubborn as a child.

16
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:52,894
My dad thought it was a forgone
conclusion I'd work in the mine.

17
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:56,481
I think a week went by
with the same ritual.

18
00:02:56,482 --> 00:03:02,682
Down in the morning
with him hot-tempered as usual.

19
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:12,956
Then up again, because
I refused to get off the elevator.

20
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:21,542
And up to Clarabelle, who'd be
waiting every day to take me home.

21
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:29,639
Clarabelle was our maid. She battled
Dad's decisions tooth and nail.

22
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,104
She'd say her little boy was
far too sensitive for the mine.

23
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:42,354
Too weak
with those skinny arms of his.

24
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:51,119
He had an imagination. And one day
his ideas would save the world.

25
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,414
She had no doubt about that.

26
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:59,323
Dicky!

27
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:06,384
...with that rifle he pulls the
trigger on a pair of underwear.

28
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:12,835
- No!
- Thought he had about a 10 point...

29
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:20,607
- Hey there...
- Dick.

30
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,362
Richard.
Hey, honey, how you doin'?

31
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:28,490
Two chocolate donuts, please.

32
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:32,786
We bought an Aunt Maple's
chocolate muffin every morning.

33
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:37,040
"That's the one
you like the best, Dicky."

34
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,878
Aunt Maple's
special chocolate muffin.

35
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,256
- I'm passionate about 'em.
- So did Sheriff Krugsby.

36
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:48,552
Thank you for my bag, Mr Salomon.
Good day, Sheriff.

37
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:51,889
Good day, Clarabelle. Richard...

38
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:59,764
All right, Howard. A bag
for my early-morning lollipop.

39
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:07,071
Dad gave in after a week.
I escaped the clutches of the mine.

40
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:11,533
But before you ask why
I keep talking about Clarabelle...

41
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:17,206
Well
she's the reason we met, Wendy.

42
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:22,586
Clarabelle got me a job at Salomon's.
That it was better for my fantasy, -

43
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:26,966
- or helped to inspire me to save
the world was difficult to see.

44
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:30,886
I stocked shelves with a
strange fellow named Stevie.

45
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:35,432
He never said a word, and
he didn't work in the mine either.

46
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:38,561
He claimed he was too tall.

47
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:44,358
Mr Salomon owned the supermarket.
He always looked very worried.

48
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:49,155
He was afraid of armed robbery
and spoke often of the gangs, -

49
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:52,575
- but I'd never seen them.

50
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:57,697
I'm hyperventilating.

51
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:03,961
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

52
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:09,592
Sorry.
Don't worry, I'll ring these up.

53
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:15,139
Go to your room, put on your white
shirt. Mind you don't wrinkle it.

54
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,478
And your tie. You're going to
Sebastian's birthday party.

55
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,063
I don't want to.

56
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:25,358
Sebastian was
exceptionally irritating.

57
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,986
Why Clarabelle made me go
was a mystery.

58
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:32,865
He did a particularly annoying
thing with his eyebrows.

59
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:36,536
- Go and get him a nice present.
- Why?

60
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:42,458
- Because you'll make new friends.
- I have friends.

61
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:48,256
Who is your friends?

62
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:53,674
- Come here, Dicky.
- I'm not going.

63
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:59,392
Come on now...

64
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:02,478
Come on, put your arms around me.

65
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,193
There was no fighting Clarabelle.
I had to get the idiot a present.

66
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,904
Hey, D! Over here!

67
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:16,826
Huey got his leg braces that day.
He lived behind the square.

68
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:20,330
He had virtually no legs.
You got them?

69
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:23,249
Yeah, I did.

70
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,880
Now Freddie won't get beaten up for
having a brother in a wheelchair.

71
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,926
- They cost 7000 bucks.
- Freddie! 700.

72
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:36,471
Freddie always exaggerated tenfold.

73
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:43,019
By the way, he got beat up more
once his brother used the braces.

74
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,982
Anyway, I had to buy a present
for that brat Sebastian.

75
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:51,403
- Catch you later.
- See you, Dick.

76
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,949
- Why tell everyone I got beat up?
- They already know.

77
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,494
No one knows.

78
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:04,747
It looks like you got
a crutch up your ass.

79
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:26,897
- What do you want?
- To buy something.

80
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:30,067
What?

81
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:34,441
A present.

82
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:38,116
- Who is it for?
- An idiot.

83
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,870
- A guy or a girl?
- A guy.

84
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:47,125
Her name was Susan. She smelled
just like her mom's lousy store.

85
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:52,422
We'd gone to the same school.

86
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:56,718
Susan had never gotten breasts
like the other girls at school.

87
00:08:56,719 --> 00:09:02,850
- What about the toy gun?
- It's been there for a century.

88
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,644
So what?

89
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,565
I think it's kind of pretty.

90
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:16,811
- Can I see it?
- Yeah... I suppose.

91
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:26,123
Such a shitty present would serve
Sebastian right. It wasn't even new.

92
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:30,377
It had a burn mark
on the side of the stock.

93
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:37,006
He would hate this present.
I couldn't wait to give it to him.

94
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:43,933
That's a nice present for Sebastian.
He always pretends he's shooting.

95
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:49,688
- He's gonna love it.
- You think so?

96
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:55,152
I began to wonder about the present.
There were too many weapons.

97
00:09:55,153 --> 00:09:59,407
Besides, I was a pacifist.
How could I forget that?

98
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:04,787
It would be wrong to give a boy a
gun. What would he grow up into?

99
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:07,415
Keep your tie on!

100
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:13,212
So I decided to give Sebastian a
book: "The Picture of Dorian Gray".

101
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:17,758
Abridged, since someone had torn
out the last 20 pages. No matter.

102
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,803
I'd gotten it cheap.

103
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:27,727
But Sebastian didn't open it
so I didn't see his disappointment.

104
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:33,858
He didn't like the toy gun.
Can I have my money back?

105
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:38,863
We don't do returns.

106
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:44,365
Oh... OK.

107
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:56,422
- Bye.
- Bye.

108
00:10:56,423 --> 00:11:02,512
I wanted to throw the toy gun away
immediately, but I didn't.

109
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:08,845
It felt smooth and nice
in my pocket.

110
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:38,298
Some years later my dad died after
a temper tantrum in the mine.

111
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:44,334
I didn't mind too much
since I never really knew him.

112
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:55,774
Richard, I'm really sorry.

113
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:03,067
You're going to be all right.
We'll all keep an eye out on you.

114
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:17,379
With Mom having died years ago
I was alone for real.

115
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,384
I was a real loser, like everyone
else who didn't work in the mine.

116
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:26,972
I stayed in Electric Park
with what my father left me.

117
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:31,393
Mostly loose doorframes
after his door-slamming.

118
00:12:31,394 --> 00:12:37,649
And Clarabelle quit.
She was really quite old now.

119
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:43,572
While I was tidying up
I came across the toy gun again.

120
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:50,818
And that was it, Wendy.
That was where it all started.

121
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:18,357
I thought you said
you were a pacifist?

122
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:24,738
Perhaps I did
but it's just an old toy gun.

123
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:28,284
It's not a toy.

124
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:34,829
It's a 6.65 mm
double action revolver.

125
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:44,789
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

126
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:16,236
Who is it?

127
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:30,259
Hi, Stevie. Nice to see you.

128
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:36,519
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

129
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,223
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.

130
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:53,119
So...
Is everything all right?

131
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,372
Yeah. Uhm...

132
00:14:56,373 --> 00:15:03,037
- I need to show you something.
- OK.

133
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:16,392
This is a 7.63 mm
model 1896 broom-handle -

134
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:20,355
- from the battle of El Alamein.

135
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:24,359
It belonged to one of
Rommel's tank commanders, -

136
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,444
- but it didn't serve him well.

137
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:33,034
When the allies attacked, he tried
to rally petrified Italian deserters.

138
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:37,914
He wanted to set an example
and execute the Italian sergeant.

139
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:43,086
But it misfired. Didn't shoot.

140
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:47,883
So they locked him in a destroyed
tank and left him in the sun.

141
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:53,388
My grandfather found the
baked body two weeks later, -

142
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:59,472
- the treacherous gun
still in his hands.

143
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:08,987
Really?

144
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:14,951
- That's really something, huh?
- I got something for you, too.

145
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:19,943
What is it?

146
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:29,883
It's for your gun. I made it myself.
I found an old casing.

147
00:16:29,884 --> 00:16:38,090
I thought maybe you'd want to try
shooting your gun. Just for fun.

148
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:45,482
OK.

149
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:49,820
- Come on then.
- Now?

150
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:54,729
All right.

151
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:02,624
Hey, I'm a pacifist too.
I'd never dream of shooting anyone.

152
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:08,494
Of course not.

153
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,960
- This way. To the old mine.
- OK.

154
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:35,407
I followed Stevie through
the closed-down part of the mine.

155
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:39,453
It was dangerous there.

156
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:43,541
But we went down to
some old, forgotten shaft.

157
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:49,576
You have to be really quiet.

158
00:17:57,222 --> 00:18:00,266
- Down there?
- Straight down.

159
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:06,218
- Is it all right?
- Totally safe.

160
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:15,114
- Haven't you been here before?
- No.

161
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:19,869
I'm not crazy about the mines.

162
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,289
You don't go out much, do you?

163
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:28,377
Never do that! Always
keep your firearm pointed down.

164
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:32,131
- Pointed down?
- At all times.

165
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:35,676
What I'm gonna do now, -

166
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:42,100
- I'll pull this lever and open up
the chamber. There it is.

167
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:49,476
I'm going to take the cartridge
and place it right there...

168
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:10,784
Wow! OK...

169
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:19,387
A bull's eye.
On your very first shot.

170
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:24,476
I couldn't even do that
with Bad Steel.

171
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,811
What did you say?

172
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:31,858
Bad Steel.
That's what I call it.

173
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:39,816
General Patton named his revolver.
I thought it was kind of cool.

174
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:44,704
God, yours is so tiny!
It's like a little lady's gun.

175
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:51,285
- You're right.
- You should give it a girl's name.

176
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:03,140
Wendy.

177
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:08,807
I'll call it Wendy.

178
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:15,689
It's perfect.

179
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:23,285
Suddenly, I was one of
those people with guns.

180
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:28,707
With a scary, bad conscience
I touched the gun that night.

181
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:35,923
Guns made the world an evil place.
But I couldn't get rid of it.

182
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:40,302
Not even back when I thought
it wasn't dangerous.

183
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:43,680
And now you were mine.

184
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:47,226
Because it is you I'm referring to.

185
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:52,481
It was as though you, a gun
were trying to tell me something.

186
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:56,735
Something I did not yet understand.

187
00:20:56,736 --> 00:21:03,325
One thing was sure, Wendy.
I had found a new friend.

188
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:09,694
And it was you.

189
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,919
Dear Wendy
it's your sensitive friend again, -

190
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,923
- who, in his ecstasy of meeting
you, has dug out his old music.

191
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:22,832
The Zombies.

192
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:28,267
Well, no one told me about her

193
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:31,729
the way she lied

194
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:38,444
no one told me about her
how many people cried

195
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:42,239
but it's too late
to say you're sorry

196
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,452
how would I know
why should I care?

197
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:52,833
Please don't bother trying
to find her, she's not there

198
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:59,340
let me tell you about the way she
looks, the way she acts

199
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:02,718
her voice is soft and cool
her eyes are clear and bright

200
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:07,515
but she's not there

201
00:22:07,516 --> 00:22:11,269
- Stevie! They could set dogs on us.
- No, relax.

202
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,647
We should keep a safe distance
to avoid stuff like that.

203
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:20,232
It's not a problem.
Let's just shoot.

204
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:25,741
Stevie and I had found each other
in this dark, secret passion.

205
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:30,037
He was a technical genius.
And we kept reading.

206
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:33,583
Stevie about the metal
me about the shooting.

207
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:39,380
Like why an exit wound
says everything about a shot, -

208
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:44,260
- and about a weapon
and its potential. Or its "soul".

209
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:47,055
Stevie and I actually started
talking a little bit.

210
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:51,392
Good velocity.
Causes immediate incapacitation.

211
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:57,106
And luckily I had you now, Wendy.
Every second of the day.

212
00:22:57,107 --> 00:23:02,237
We started carrying. You and
Bad Steel lay in our pockets.

213
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:05,365
It felt important and reassuring.

214
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:13,322
The two of you made us grow.
Even Mr Salomon was impressed.

215
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:20,213
I can't take it anymore...

216
00:23:20,214 --> 00:23:24,634
It's all...

217
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:29,472
They say gangs are completely
out of hand in town.

218
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:34,643
And...

219
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:45,530
Maybe I'm overreacting.
I don't know.

220
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:51,317
What do you think, Dick?

221
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:58,794
I must say Clarabelle guessed right.
You've really come around.

222
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:06,968
You walk with confidence, you look
folks in the eye at the checkout.

223
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:12,808
I like that. It breeds respect.
More maybe than a gun would.

224
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:19,606
He made me assistant manager
and would have given me a raise.

225
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:25,904
Stevie was a better man, too.
He took a loan and bought a van.

226
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:30,450
He had his own company and could
look people in the eye too.

227
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:34,538
Stevie. Congratulations.

228
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:40,040
- You finally got it.
- Thanks, Dick.

229
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:46,091
We'd stopped sneaking along when
the real men came up from the mine.

230
00:24:46,092 --> 00:24:49,386
We were just as good as them.

231
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:55,726
Electric Park Square was just as
much ours. All the zones we named:

232
00:24:55,727 --> 00:25:00,522
The Slope Corner, The Shack
Way Out, East Side, -

233
00:25:00,523 --> 00:25:04,276
- Center Pole, Shopside
The Swamp, -

234
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:09,031
- where the water always rose
from the drains. Slong Island.

235
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:17,701
And Salomon's. It was all just
as much ours now. If not more.

236
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:48,147
I need this slice from you.

237
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,357
In a way it's a shame
we're keeping this to ourselves.

238
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:26,984
What do you mean?

239
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:31,155
Pacifists with guns is
such a great idea, -

240
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:35,284
- it's practically our duty
to share it with others.

241
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:42,000
- Like who?
- Like the people who need it.

242
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,960
OK...

243
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:51,050
We were losers.
Maybe not right now, but we were.

244
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:56,639
That's right. We were not the
only losers in Electric Park.

245
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,352
Exactly.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

246
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:09,861
- You need some help?
- No, I'm OK.

247
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:14,532
- When is it?
- Five o'clock, old mine building.

248
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:20,485
- You're gonna be there, right?
- Yeah.

249
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:26,836
I'd have to ask permission
to get out of the store.

250
00:27:26,837 --> 00:27:31,716
Hey! It's over here! Right here!

251
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:36,429
Stevie
let's find something they can sit on.

252
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:42,310
It wasn't easy to get them out of
their shells, but there they were.

253
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:48,149
By the old mine we had a meeting.
The losers from Electric Park.

254
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,612
Susan!
Glad you could join us here.

255
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:54,990
Hi, Freddie!

256
00:27:54,991 --> 00:28:03,446
Look at it as an experiment to help
you become what you really are.

257
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:15,052
What's that?

258
00:28:15,053 --> 00:28:20,968
A whole lot happier, I expect.

259
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:25,270
You guys in, or...?

260
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:29,858
I think it's a good idea.
I mean, there's pacifichism...

261
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:35,364
- It's good we don't shoot anybody.
- You mean pacifism.

262
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:38,617
The Dandies was
the name I came up with.

263
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:43,905
It had the cheerfulness
I was hoping for.

264
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:56,593
Hey, guys!
Freddie found a hole.

265
00:28:56,594 --> 00:29:00,389
- Found a what?
- A trapdoor.

266
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,351
I think it goes down to the mine.
Come on!

267
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:08,897
- Looks good.
- Great.

268
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:12,443
- They're coming!
- Are they coming?

269
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:19,158
It's deep! Damn, it's deep! I think
it leads through all the mines.

270
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,036
Come on, hurry!

271
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:26,999
- Oh, my God, it's huge!
- What are we talking about here?

272
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,253
The disused mine building became
what we later called The Temple.

273
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:36,509
Freddie knew lots of other
abandoned mine shafts.

274
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,806
One of them emerged in what
would become our living room.

275
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:45,976
- Don't make too much noise.
- This is exactly 15 feet.

276
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:51,524
- Where are you?
- I could get you down with the rope.

277
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:55,444
- Where is he?
- I'm over here.

278
00:29:55,445 --> 00:30:03,818
- Careful.
- Is the flash on?

279
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:16,090
Everyone brought
something to The Temple.

280
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:21,929
Before long Huey and Susan brought
guns they'd dug out from somewhere.

281
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,807
I hope it still works.

282
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:27,518
Stevie?

283
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,773
We have a new addition over here.

284
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:36,194
Can you come help look at it?

285
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:41,616
Wow! You got yourself
a hand cannon there, Huey.

286
00:30:41,617 --> 00:30:44,285
Let me take a look.

287
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:48,122
I believe this is a 52 caliber.

288
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:55,505
Which means the bullets are that big.
It's what we call a front loader.

289
00:30:55,506 --> 00:31:00,927
Huey had picked an older model.
Nobody could say it wasn't dandy, -

290
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:03,388
- as we soon began to say.

291
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,974
Extremely dandy.

292
00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:10,061
Good sport. What's its name?
Is it a he, or a she?

293
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:17,235
- Oh, it's a he.
- Thought so.

294
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:20,947
I think his name should be Lyndon.

295
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:25,201
And everything revolved around
you and I, Wendy.

296
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:28,705
And we kept listening to
The Zombies.

297
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:32,542
This one's Lee?
Can I hold them?

298
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:34,085
Yes.

299
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:41,134
Susan stuck to American history. We
didn't like modern, vulgar weapons.

300
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:47,182
They were not dandy. She even had
a nice little revolver for Freddie -

301
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:52,437
- which was later christened Emily.

302
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:55,482
- Are you sure, Freddie?
- I'm sure.

303
00:31:55,483 --> 00:32:01,446
But he declined. He had a crush on
a gun he'd spotted in a gun store.

304
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:05,409
$800, said Freddie
which of course meant 80.

305
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:11,248
None of us had that kind of money.
It was hard on Emily.

306
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:16,750
But then again, she was no beauty.

307
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:24,344
We had poetry readings.
And the Dandies made a secret sign.

308
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:29,716
- You guys want to hear it?
- Yeah.

309
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:35,355
Lee is cold as ice
Grant is hot as hell.

310
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:39,067
I think they're both real nice, -

311
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:45,898
- and I hope it all ends well.

312
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:57,211
Can you teach me to write like that?

313
00:32:57,212 --> 00:32:59,713
Then we had our inauguration.

314
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:04,760
Drinking Offley's Invalid Port
the most dandy I could get.

315
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:08,722
It was terrible, but soon became
part of the rituals.

316
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:13,936
Stevie suggested appointing me
chief, but I insisted on a vote.

317
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:18,983
A vote where everyone had a say.
Stevie, Huey, Freddie and Susan.

318
00:33:18,984 --> 00:33:22,361
But even more important
you, Wendy.

319
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:28,701
Stevie's Bad Steel, Susan's Lee
and Grant, and Huey's Lyndon.

320
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:34,165
- Hi, Lyndon.
- Hello, Wendy.

321
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:38,502
Since you brought it up
what about you?

322
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:40,921
You.

323
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:45,342
- And Bad Steel?
- You too.

324
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:49,055
- No doubt about it. You, Dick.
- You.

325
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:54,343
And Lyndon?

326
00:33:56,438 --> 00:34:01,317
I don't get it.
I can't really say anything.

327
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:05,905
Just pick him, Huey.
You just ruined the whole thing.

328
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:11,410
OK, OK... Uhm.
You, too.

329
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:13,830
- Are you sure?
- Real sure.

330
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:17,917
- That makes 80 votes.
- Bravo.

331
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,673
OK... the regulations. The most
important thing for a Dandy is-

332
00:34:23,674 --> 00:34:29,178
- never to show off his partner.
Whatever the provocation.

333
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,100
We carry them as moral supports.

334
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:37,228
That's the most important thing.

335
00:34:37,229 --> 00:34:43,318
They may be carried
but never brandished.

336
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:47,071
Not one of us were in doubt
about the most important thing.

337
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:52,869
The reason why our partners could
never be exposed to full light-

338
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:56,581
- and thereby woken up.
Once awoken, -

339
00:34:56,582 --> 00:35:00,877
- nothing could stop them
from killing.

340
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:06,132
It was so forbidden to say that word
that we called it "loving".

341
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:12,013
And loving could never ever happen.
That would be the end of it all.

342
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:15,600
- Hear.
- Hear.

343
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:19,521
I'm Patrick Besant-Matthews
a forensic pathologist-

344
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:22,941
- with a special interest
in firearms injuries.

345
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:29,948
We're going to discuss how
firearms injuries appear in the body.

346
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:34,703
The entrance site intersected this
junction between two skull bones...

347
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:38,331
Maybe he shot from close range.

348
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:42,252
It has to be close range.

349
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:46,840
...the base of the
22 rim fire cartridge...

350
00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:52,053
Do you see that? See how fast
it slides straight through?

351
00:35:52,054 --> 00:35:56,766
This one coming out
is my favorite.

352
00:35:56,767 --> 00:36:01,688
...someone shoots him
with a military rifle...

353
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:05,734
It really didn't feel like much.
Much less than a punch.

354
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:12,157
They'd cut themselves, then tied
leather straps around their balls.

355
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:19,373
The pain made them stronger.
They would hide in the forest, -

356
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:24,336
- and then go up to the American
soldiers and cut their heads off.

357
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:28,548
These warriors would become
practically unstoppable.

358
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:32,511
That's their testicles
and that's the penis.

359
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:37,391
Susan, cover your eyes. I don't
know if you've seen a penis before.

360
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:40,060
I'm sorry I had to show you that.

361
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:46,442
He being an old Vietnam vet
obviously has the. 45 service pistol.

362
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:49,945
Everyone loved "guess the gun".

363
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:55,576
She killed her perpetrator
with a. 44 revolver.

364
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:59,580
He's gonna go with
the service revolver.

365
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:01,332
It's a treacherous gun.

366
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:05,419
Because he's a military man
he'll have the all automatic.

367
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,172
Only this will fit in
her glove compartment.

368
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:13,135
The L1808 polymer appeals to
a more dubious kind of character.

369
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:18,265
Everyone except Freddie
who watched from the sidelines, -

370
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:20,935
- fired and fired, and got better.

371
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:27,896
Everyone carried and nobody knew.
And we all grew.

372
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:33,155
It was your idea, Wendy, that
I should fire you from the hip.

373
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:39,370
As aiming was your business
it worked like a dream.

374
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:40,913
Slow down, Calamity Jane.

375
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:45,710
Susan had a revelation too. She
made up a new way of shooting-

376
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:49,588
- called indirect.
She aimed at a hard surface -

377
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:52,591
- and make the
bullet ricochet to the target.

378
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:57,596
It was so much her.
Shy but clever.

379
00:37:57,597 --> 00:38:02,518
Finally, when everyone had
given up hope, her mother died.

380
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:08,107
Susan cried, but I told her now
she could redecorate the store.

381
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:12,278
I said she was the Dandy
that had grown the most.

382
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:16,949
- Walk straight.
- Without any eyes?

383
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,077
Come in.

384
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:26,528
We should probably shut the door.

385
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:34,509
The smell's gone.
It smells nice.

386
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:40,974
- Come back here.
- Right here? OK.

387
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:47,105
- I can't wait to show you.
- What are you doing?

388
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:52,110
- Ehm, what are you...?
- They've grown.

389
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:58,491
My breasts have grown. You
always talk at The Temple about-

390
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:03,079
- how everybody's growing
and getting better and better.

391
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,959
And I didn't really understand
but I just...

392
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,173
It's like the mind and body
have worked together.

393
00:39:13,174 --> 00:39:18,303
When I carry Lee and Grant, I feel
so powerful. I feel myself growing.

394
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:22,390
That was not what I had meant
but she was happy.

395
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:26,895
Huey too was sleeping with a girl.
There was no stopping him now.

396
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:32,233
He hit on anything that moved.
Only Freddie still got beaten up.

397
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:37,989
But we expected it to stop when
he could afford to start carrying.

398
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:42,369
- Maybe we could hang out later?
- Sure.

399
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:47,207
Yeah? We'll go out. I'll see you
when you get out of school.

400
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,918
All right.

401
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:55,705
Did you see that?
That's right.

402
00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:04,891
It's the time of the season

403
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:08,061
when love runs high

404
00:40:08,062 --> 00:40:13,775
in this time give it to me easy

405
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:18,155
and let me try
with pleasured hands

406
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:22,409
to take you in the sun
to promised lands

407
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,703
to show you every one

408
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:34,251
it's the time of the season
for loving

409
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:41,011
When we were in the mood for it
we had a parade.

410
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:45,682
We wore our Dandy parade uniforms
showing off our true selves-

411
00:40:45,683 --> 00:40:51,932
- without fear of
what others may think.

412
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:15,546
And under all those colors
was the seriousness of it all.

413
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:20,551
For me anyway.

414
00:41:20,552 --> 00:41:24,305
And you, Wendy.

415
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:28,309
I was so happy you were my friend.

416
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:33,514
My confidante.

417
00:42:35,794 --> 00:42:40,832
You did it!

418
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:48,840
Firing blind. It's incredible.

419
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:57,815
- Congratulations, Dick.
- Thank you.

420
00:42:57,816 --> 00:43:01,194
And they gave me a Dandy's
greatest accolade.

421
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:05,114
Co-co-co-congratulations
D- d-dick!

422
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:11,454
They congratulated me with the
special Brideshead stutter.

423
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:18,701
Wendy thanks you, too.
We did this together.

424
00:43:18,713 --> 00:43:22,674
I felt as though you could have
hit that target without me.

425
00:43:22,675 --> 00:43:29,139
One thing's for sure.
I couldn't have done it without you.

426
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,602
But I suppose
that's what friends are for.

427
00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:37,230
To complement each other.

428
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:43,349
We were one, Wendy.

429
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,378
- Officer Krugsby.
- Hey there, Richard.

430
00:44:00,379 --> 00:44:05,217
- Mind if I come in?
- No, of course not. Please.

431
00:44:05,218 --> 00:44:10,681
Our procession last night may have
been a little provoking. Sorry...

432
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:16,311
No, no problem. You're a good kid
I've known that for ages.

433
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:22,776
Guys who like Aunt Mable's chocolate
muffins can't be all that bad.

434
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:28,699
But I brought this guy with me.
He would like to talk with you.

435
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,995
He's down the hall. Would you give
him a moment of your time?

436
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:35,289
Sure.

437
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:42,004
Son... Come here, son.

438
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:47,050
- What's up, Dick?
- Who is this?

439
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:52,598
I understood you were old pals.
This is Clarabelle's grandson.

440
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:55,976
Sebastian!

441
00:44:55,977 --> 00:45:02,983
- I think we ought to sit down.
- Go ahead. Take a seat.

442
00:45:02,984 --> 00:45:06,946
You see, young Sebastian here...

443
00:45:06,947 --> 00:45:10,366
Can you not touch that?

444
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:13,702
Son! All right...

445
00:45:13,703 --> 00:45:20,830
Get over there. The other chair.

446
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:31,470
Young Sebastian here has got
himself into some nasty trouble.

447
00:45:31,471 --> 00:45:35,558
You understand what I'm saying
don't you? Go on!

448
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:42,189
I blew a guy away.
It wasn't necessarily... my fault.

449
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,360
I understand. We understand.
Nuff said.

450
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:52,241
He did, and he's in a
probation program now.

451
00:45:52,242 --> 00:45:58,414
He needs somebody his own age
who an be a positive influence.

452
00:45:58,415 --> 00:46:03,794
So I figured he needed a kind of
probation officer, you know?

453
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:10,718
So that he stays away from weapons.
And he wants that person to be you.

454
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,472
- Yeah.
- And I could only agree.

455
00:46:14,473 --> 00:46:19,685
- You're a good kid.
- I can't be a probation officer.

456
00:46:19,686 --> 00:46:23,147
I'm not talking about paper work.

457
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:28,820
You just got to keep an eye on him.
We have to look out for each other.

458
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:34,242
And Sebastian here
has been a fucking idiot.

459
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:39,789
I understand you've been friends
and now he's in the program.

460
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:45,253
- He's been saying you're a moral...
- Moral role model.

461
00:46:45,254 --> 00:46:50,049
- Ever since I was real little.
- What if I can't control him?

462
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,803
What if something got out of hand?

463
00:46:53,804 --> 00:46:57,390
I'm a good person...
I'm good.

464
00:46:57,391 --> 00:47:03,771
- I read the book that you gave me.
- Shut the fuck up!

465
00:47:03,772 --> 00:47:08,359
One word from you
and it's back to jail with him.

466
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,947
- And he will do exactly as I say?
- Of course.

467
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:18,119
Why else
would I need a probation officer?

468
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,249
- You gotta trust the little guy.
- I don't understand what he means.

469
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:29,589
But I think we have an agreement.
Why don't we just...

470
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:37,381
I think we've worked it out.
You're a good boy.

471
00:47:52,989 --> 00:48:00,704
Krugsby's plan was that Sebastian
checked in with me once a week.

472
00:48:00,705 --> 00:48:04,708
I decided to trust him
and save him.

473
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:10,088
For Clarabelle, for Krugsby
for my belief in the little guy?

474
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:16,553
Maybe just to prove that
I could make a Dandy out of him.

475
00:48:16,554 --> 00:48:23,052
A pacifist out of a murderer.

476
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:30,441
Hello!

477
00:48:53,717 --> 00:48:58,754
Sebastian?

478
00:48:59,472 --> 00:49:05,388
You're here. Come on in.

479
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:07,813
Well...

480
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:12,109
- They're waiting in the library.
- The library?

481
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,864
- You don't like reading?
- I got a book once.

482
00:49:16,865 --> 00:49:22,983
It's right down there.

483
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:29,960
- They're doing the floret.
- Try and get a little more direct.

484
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:34,869
Floret?

485
00:49:39,554 --> 00:49:47,645
OK, that's good. Maybe we
should try the first bit again.

486
00:49:47,646 --> 00:49:52,274
- And... one. That's better.
- Ahem.

487
00:49:52,275 --> 00:49:55,403
Excuse me.

488
00:49:55,404 --> 00:49:59,782
Hi, Sebastian.
Welcome to The Temple.

489
00:49:59,783 --> 00:50:05,997
You caught me in the middle of a
rehearsal. Come and meet the others.

490
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:12,920
This is Stevie Dandelion. He's
working on a piece of ammunition.

491
00:50:12,921 --> 00:50:18,634
This particular gun
is named Bad Steel.

492
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:22,388
It's got a shady past.

493
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:25,683
It refused to fire
at a really dumb moment.

494
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:30,104
Only because no one ever
looked after it properly.

495
00:50:30,105 --> 00:50:33,608
That's very true.

496
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:36,778
Is there a problem?

497
00:50:36,779 --> 00:50:41,491
- You're wearing a turban.
- And?

498
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:43,493
Nothing.

499
00:50:43,494 --> 00:50:47,747
Come on, let's meet the others.

500
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:52,460
- Take care, Sebastian.
- You too, buddy.

501
00:50:52,461 --> 00:51:00,051
Hey, Freddie! Tell Sebastian about
the trick of the Moro warriors.

502
00:51:00,052 --> 00:51:04,514
They tied leather straps around their
testicles before going into battle.

503
00:51:04,515 --> 00:51:09,394
The pain used to make them
unstoppable by practically any gun.

504
00:51:09,395 --> 00:51:13,314
They fought 1000 percent.

505
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:17,318
- That's some percentage.
- They were tough guys, Sebastian.

506
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:23,116
Take a seat, please.

507
00:51:23,117 --> 00:51:29,282
- I came to check in.
- Yeah...

508
00:51:29,832 --> 00:51:32,250
Here I am.

509
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:37,339
Your probation officer has nothing
special to tell you at this time.

510
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:43,374
I just gotta ask if you stayed
away from firearms.

511
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:51,269
- Yes, I have.
- That's good. Guns are bad news.

512
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:56,441
- Yeah, they're bad news.
- Well, what do you think?

513
00:51:56,442 --> 00:52:01,279
- You guys are completely nuts.
- That's one way of looking at it.

514
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,867
But it's what we've chosen
to spend our time on.

515
00:52:05,868 --> 00:52:11,915
I actually brought you here to
ask you if you'd like to join us.

516
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:16,378
Might like to join you guys?

517
00:52:16,379 --> 00:52:21,717
- If I would like to join you?
- That's what I said.

518
00:52:21,718 --> 00:52:25,137
Let me think about it.

519
00:52:25,138 --> 00:52:32,596
- Like hell I would.
- Not even if you could have a gun?

520
00:52:35,607 --> 00:52:39,485
Your job is to make sure
that I don't get one.

521
00:52:39,486 --> 00:52:42,154
If you learn to be a Dandy-

522
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:48,077
- and you're good enough, I'll make
sure you get the gun you want.

523
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:53,874
But it will only be here.
And we'll do it our way.

524
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:57,336
Just show up here every week.

525
00:52:57,337 --> 00:53:01,590
When we all think your attitude
is decent, you'll get that gun.

526
00:53:01,591 --> 00:53:05,719
Is shooting guys in the head decent?
No?

527
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,141
Doing it isn't. Not doing it is what
makes us stronger and better.

528
00:53:11,142 --> 00:53:13,936
Can I go now?

529
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:18,315
Your visit has been satisfactory.
I'll tell Krugsby.

530
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:21,569
I'll see you here every Tuesday.

531
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:26,691
Let me take a look at that.

532
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:34,486
Small but no weakling.
She's one cute chick, man.

533
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:42,165
More dangerous
than she looks, though.

534
00:53:44,676 --> 00:53:51,015
Doesn't she ever get tired
of your goofing around?

535
00:53:51,016 --> 00:54:00,230
Or with you? I'll bet you're way
too nice for her. See you Tuesday.

536
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:19,752
I stood there for a moment
unable to speak.

537
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:24,924
That self-assured way he held you.
And you enjoyed it.

538
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:30,805
Just lying there in his hand.
I could see that. Cute girl.

539
00:54:30,806 --> 00:54:35,893
I decided that you would never
lay in his palm again.

540
00:54:35,894 --> 00:54:41,983
He was coarse and far from our
sophisticated image of a Dandy.

541
00:54:41,984 --> 00:54:48,865
"If I'd been a Dandy, I'd be dead,"
he said. Not the guy he shot.

542
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:54,367
If he hadn't drawn his gun.

543
00:54:55,122 --> 00:54:59,250
He was up all night
so it's no wonder he's sleepy.

544
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:03,296
- But he's real cute.
- He's cute?

545
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:07,342
Cute? What do you mean?

546
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:14,307
- Susan? I think I'm real cute.
- Kind of gorgeous.

547
00:55:14,308 --> 00:55:19,104
He's tough. And sexy.

548
00:55:19,105 --> 00:55:21,356
OK. So...

549
00:55:21,357 --> 00:55:27,112
Gorgeous. I'd always had trouble
seeing whether a man was gorgeous.

550
00:55:27,113 --> 00:55:34,903
I could see that he was strong.
And brown.

551
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:40,750
I wondered if you had the
same experience as Susan.

552
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:46,882
That you had shared a flirt.
You and Sebastian.

553
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:51,344
You have a particular taste
in guys, I can see that.

554
00:55:51,345 --> 00:55:56,266
You like guys with big schlongs.
And I know he has a big schlongs.

555
00:55:56,267 --> 00:56:01,354
You deserve to have your mouth
washed out with soap.

556
00:56:01,355 --> 00:56:04,858
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Christmas comes early.

557
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:10,530
Open it, it's for you.
Go ahead, don't be shy.

558
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:13,825
A little Christmas gift for you.

559
00:56:13,826 --> 00:56:17,454
- There you go, man.
- Whoa!

560
00:56:17,455 --> 00:56:22,334
There you go.
It's what they had in the window.

561
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:25,254
I'm a nice guy, you know.

562
00:56:25,255 --> 00:56:28,173
It's the nicest thing
anybody could ever do.

563
00:56:28,174 --> 00:56:35,097
No more talk about that gun down
town. Is that it? It was real cheap.

564
00:56:35,098 --> 00:56:41,678
- The 7.65 mm model 1900 automatic.
- Hey, hey, hey!

565
00:56:42,856 --> 00:56:48,110
I was tired of seeing Freddie being
beat up. Dandies don't get beat up.

566
00:56:48,111 --> 00:56:54,116
- Ain't that right, Dicky?
- Yeah, I guess so.

567
00:56:54,117 --> 00:56:59,163
That's the nicest thing. I can't
even believe these other guns.

568
00:56:59,164 --> 00:57:01,040
That's how I do it, girl.

569
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:05,628
Do you, Freddie Dandelion
take this firearm -

570
00:57:05,629 --> 00:57:10,174
- in respect and honor
till death do you part?

571
00:57:10,175 --> 00:57:16,886
- I do.
- Perform the ritual.

572
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:34,156
With these guns as witnesses, I hereby
wed thee, Freddie Dandelion, -

573
00:57:34,157 --> 00:57:39,694
- to this firearm.

574
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:48,379
Co-co-co-congratulations
F- f-f-freddie!

575
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,548
And...

576
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:58,470
- Woman. Her name is Woman.
- Wo-wo-wo-woman!

577
00:58:27,044 --> 00:58:34,217
Dear Wendy
Sebastian was a hero.

578
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:39,847
During the ceremony for Freddie and
Woman I couldn't take it anymore.

579
00:58:39,848 --> 00:58:43,935
I had to fight him.
But in a Dandy way.

580
00:58:43,936 --> 00:58:50,149
Sebastian hadn't been in the target
shaft. He had never seen us shoot.

581
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:52,902
He'd never seen me shoot.

582
00:58:52,903 --> 00:58:56,573
That would be the perfect
Dandy way to show him-

583
00:58:56,574 --> 00:59:02,075
- who had the upper hand.

584
00:59:20,097 --> 00:59:24,225
All I had to do was to get up there
in front of the targets, -

585
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:28,855
- pick you up from the partners'
waiting area with its blue velvet, -

586
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:33,235
- and show off a few rounds
of relaxed hip shooting.

587
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:38,523
And Sebastian would be blown away.

588
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:45,831
Sebastian! What are you doing?

589
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:53,836
Never touch another Dandy's gun.
That's rule number one.

590
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:01,847
- My fault, boss.
- Why don't you just go?

591
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:06,560
We don't want you here!
You come here and ruin everything!

592
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:10,856
- At least he can aim.
- I don't care!

593
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,526
- Susan, give me a scarf.
- Dick...

594
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:21,274
I really think this is a bad idea.

595
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:32,211
It's not nice to Wendy.

596
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:36,715
Could I hear you, Wendy?

597
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:40,803
Maybe I did sense some doubt
about our connection.

598
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:45,766
But now it's time.

599
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:52,430
It's you, Wendy... and me.

600
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:30,872
- Hi.
- Hi again, Dick. How are you?

601
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:37,003
I'm working on an idea that
would be right up Bad Steel's street.

602
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:41,716
I came back to ask you to
perform a repair.

603
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:46,095
- It's the sight.
- Does it need adjusting?

604
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:49,891
You don't use the sight
you fire from the hip.

605
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:54,771
That's exactly why I want it removed.

606
01:02:54,772 --> 01:03:00,485
I don't get it.
That's a very radical alteration.

607
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:05,698
The sight is a major part of the
personality. You said so yourself.

608
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:11,579
I've wanted it removed
for a long time.

609
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:17,502
But if you don't use the sight
why should you care?

610
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:22,382
- Only because others might use it.
- What are you talking about?

611
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:26,928
This has got nothing to do
with Sebastian.

612
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:34,969
- I didn't mention Sebastian.
- No. Are you gonna do it, or not?

613
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:22,347
Wendy's my gun.

614
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:43,797
I exchanged you for Emily.

615
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:46,717
I closed myself up in the library, -

616
01:04:46,718 --> 01:04:50,429
- pretending to study my favorite
handbook on exit wounds.

617
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:54,516
And not one of the Dandies
came up to comfort me.

618
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:59,271
Until one did.
And as surprising as it sounds, -

619
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:04,726
- it was Sebastian.

620
01:05:13,662 --> 01:05:18,997
Come on down, man.

621
01:05:25,423 --> 01:05:28,759
We're all worried about you.

622
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:35,340
I've never liked you, Sebastian.

623
01:05:37,644 --> 01:05:42,606
What do you have
that I don't have?

624
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:48,237
Maybe you're not
very good at understanding women.

625
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:55,151
Or little lady revolvers
for that matter.

626
01:05:55,537 --> 01:06:02,835
In my experience, women may like
words, but they quickly forget them.

627
01:06:02,836 --> 01:06:07,924
- They want a bit of action.
- It's obvious that you'd say that.

628
01:06:07,925 --> 01:06:12,595
This pacifist stuff is real fancy
but it's easy too.

629
01:06:12,596 --> 01:06:16,641
I don't see it that way.
The others don't, either.

630
01:06:16,642 --> 01:06:23,856
Shut up. You might as well say
"I'm scared, I'll carry a gun."

631
01:06:23,857 --> 01:06:27,568
- I'm not scared.
- You sure as hell are.

632
01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:31,781
So am I. So is everybody else.

633
01:06:31,782 --> 01:06:35,743
The kids downstairs are scared too.

634
01:06:35,744 --> 01:06:40,581
Clara... Clarabelle is scared.

635
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:44,252
Clarabelle?

636
01:06:44,253 --> 01:06:48,381
Clarabelle, as in your grandma?

637
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:54,762
She suddenly got real old.
She can't remember a damn thing.

638
01:06:54,763 --> 01:06:59,309
She doesn't even dare to
go outside her door anymore.

639
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:04,981
The last few years she's only been
out on one single day a year.

640
01:07:04,982 --> 01:07:11,571
One day.
On Cynthia's birthday.

641
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:15,492
But she doesn't dare, this year.

642
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:24,280
She thinks these gangs will kill her
steal her coffee, rob her...

643
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:30,340
Which is obviously a delusion.
She lost it, man.

644
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:34,844
Dear Wendy
An idea for a plan appeared to me.

645
01:07:34,845 --> 01:07:39,891
A plan that would prove that the
Dandies were not just about words.

646
01:07:39,892 --> 01:07:47,220
Proof. For them.
And for you, Wendy.

647
01:07:53,906 --> 01:07:59,573
Hi. Please come in.

648
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:10,797
We're going to have an exercise.
An important exercise.

649
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:16,970
Sebastian told me there's an
old woman living on the square.

650
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:21,516
She wants to visit her cousin
but is too scared.

651
01:08:21,517 --> 01:08:30,067
We're going to prove to that the
strength of the Dandies exists...

652
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:35,572
...and is completely intact.

653
01:08:35,573 --> 01:08:42,538
Through our presence, the old lady
who is Sebastian's grandmother...

654
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,958
- Really?
- Yeah.

655
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:49,503
She will have the courage to
cross the square.

656
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:55,676
Our strength will rub off on her.

657
01:08:55,677 --> 01:09:04,101
And after this exercise I think we'll
believe in everything a lot more.

658
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:11,150
And besides
it'll be a good deed.

659
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:15,029
Your granny?
The lady with the giant purse?

660
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:19,992
- Huge purse.
- How awful. Not daring to go out.

661
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:23,913
- It's terrible.
- Will our partners be with us?

662
01:09:23,914 --> 01:09:28,959
They will come along
as our moral support.

663
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:35,466
- So what's our strategy?
- Well, I have a few ideas.

664
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:41,055
We're here.
Opposite here is Susan's store, -

665
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:44,392
- the new mine and the old mine.

666
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:50,523
Clarabelle lives here. It's simple.
We'll take her through the Swamp, -

667
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:56,696
- through East Side, Slope Corner
and the Shack to Cynthia's here.

668
01:09:56,697 --> 01:10:02,910
Freddie and Woman will stand here
for Clarabelle's safe arrival.

669
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:07,874
Susan's Lee and Grant can keep
a sharp lookout down the street.

670
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:12,503
Huey and Lyndon can create
peace and stability in East Side, -

671
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:17,383
- Stevie and Bad Steel can cover
the long corners from Center Pole.

672
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:20,803
Come here. Take a look.

673
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:24,974
Sebastian, you're going to be
with me at Clarabelle's.

674
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:29,270
Huey, you'll be in Zone 6
in front of the Swamp.

675
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:33,107
Stevie, you can take Zone 8.

676
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:38,029
They all looked at Electric Park
which they knew so well, -

677
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:43,409
- and saw the square in a new light
as their square again.

678
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:48,122
And it made us Dandies once more.
And together.

679
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:54,917
So that's the plan.
Is everyone agreed?

680
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:14,315
Cynthia had the coffee pot and the
cake ready for Clarabelle's visit.

681
01:11:14,316 --> 01:11:20,989
Down on the square, the Dandies
were ready to ensure her safety.

682
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:27,618
So there was no need to worry.
This was an absolutely normal day.

683
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:33,835
- Hi. We're ready downstairs.
- It's Dick!

684
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:39,341
Hi, Clarabelle.
Do you remember me? Dicky?

685
01:11:39,342 --> 01:11:44,805
- I don't remember a damn thing!
- Should we go?

686
01:11:44,806 --> 01:11:48,058
- We should go.
- OK.

687
01:11:48,059 --> 01:11:52,896
The Imperial coffee.
It's a beautiful day outside too.

688
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:57,651
Don't worry, Clarabelle.
Nothing is going to happen.

689
01:11:57,652 --> 01:12:01,530
Don't forget the keys, man.

690
01:12:01,531 --> 01:12:06,451
Let's go, Mommy.

691
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:12,040
- All right... watch your step.
- Oh!

692
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:17,910
It's gonna be all right.

693
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:20,507
Oh dear...

694
01:12:20,508 --> 01:12:23,677
You're doing good, Clarabelle.

695
01:12:23,678 --> 01:12:29,381
See the window? It's right there.

696
01:12:35,982 --> 01:12:42,100
- My bag.
- Nobody is going to touch your bag.

697
01:12:44,741 --> 01:12:49,150
Look, it's Cynthia.

698
01:12:51,206 --> 01:12:55,876
I got my bag...

699
01:12:55,877 --> 01:12:59,004
- Oh!
- Hey!

700
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:05,420
Ma'am! Let me help you get up.

701
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,640
- Leave me alone!
- I'm just trying to help.

702
01:13:09,641 --> 01:13:14,430
Stop, stop, stop!

703
01:13:30,203 --> 01:13:34,874
Dear Wendy
this was a huge fuck-up.

704
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:38,294
I know Clarabelle never
claimed to be a Dandy, -

705
01:13:38,295 --> 01:13:42,506
- and she clearly
wasn't exactly a pacifist.

706
01:13:42,507 --> 01:13:46,010
But this was far from
what I had ever imagined.

707
01:13:46,011 --> 01:13:53,007
This is a mistake, Krugsby!
A big misunderstanding.

708
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,772
Shit!

709
01:13:57,773 --> 01:14:02,276
What are you running around
shooting people for?

710
01:14:02,277 --> 01:14:06,322
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, Huey.

711
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:10,284
I'm gonna get the door, don't worry.

712
01:14:10,285 --> 01:14:16,404
All right, I got it.
Everybody good?

713
01:14:27,511 --> 01:14:31,306
I talked to Krugsby.
It's all arranged.

714
01:14:31,307 --> 01:14:37,258
If he can have Clarabelle
we can keep our guns.

715
01:14:43,819 --> 01:14:46,863
We're good.

716
01:14:46,864 --> 01:14:50,491
Freddie had a
secret talk to Krugsby.

717
01:14:50,492 --> 01:14:55,830
They decided to stop the whole thing
before it got out of hand.

718
01:14:55,831 --> 01:15:00,543
Krugsby would pick up Clarabelle
so he could put her in a home.

719
01:15:00,544 --> 01:15:09,842
And nothing would happen to us.
I was a good guy, Krugsby said.

720
01:15:23,651 --> 01:15:27,320
Hey there, Richard.

721
01:15:27,321 --> 01:15:32,492
We got ourselves a heck of
a mess, haven't we? Don't worry, -

722
01:15:32,493 --> 01:15:36,079
- I'm gonna deal with it.

723
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:43,538
I just have to ask you
to give me over granny there.

724
01:15:46,132 --> 01:15:51,219
I know you, Richard.
You're a good kid.

725
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:55,390
We're not all that different.

726
01:15:55,391 --> 01:16:02,434
You're the kind of boys
this country was built on.

727
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:12,199
Clarabelle, I'm really sorry.

728
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,285
Things have just turned out this way.

729
01:16:15,286 --> 01:16:18,247
Hey, Krugsby!

730
01:16:18,248 --> 01:16:25,629
I want to thank you so much for
saying that we can keep our guns.

731
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:33,554
They mean a lot to us. A lot of
people wouldn't appreciate it.

732
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:40,769
But I can see you have a
real special gun yourself.

733
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:44,606
Don't you?

734
01:16:44,607 --> 01:16:48,861
I do. It's a 08 polymer.

735
01:16:48,862 --> 01:16:53,866
Never trust a man with a
smart-ass L 1808 polymer.

736
01:16:53,867 --> 01:17:01,081
This here has been and will be
with me right to the end of the line.

737
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:07,960
- It's just the way I am.
- That's a treacherous gun.

738
01:17:09,174 --> 01:17:15,971
And I am fine with it.
Hell, I'd be happy to join myself.

739
01:17:15,972 --> 01:17:19,975
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

740
01:17:19,976 --> 01:17:22,686
Unit!

741
01:17:22,687 --> 01:17:29,814
Regroup!
Catch them, all right!

742
01:17:32,155 --> 01:17:38,119
- Come on, move!
- Get her in here.

743
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:43,823
- Turn the light off!
- Shhh!

744
01:17:47,879 --> 01:17:54,010
We made it back. But it didn't sound
like they were in a better mood.

745
01:17:54,011 --> 01:18:00,639
- They're destroying the Temple.
- Shhh!

746
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:17,450
We were still there
the next morning.

747
01:18:17,451 --> 01:18:23,247
I got Stevie to check
if you were still on the wall.

748
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:30,338
But you were gone. By now you'd
be in some stupid cop's pocket.

749
01:18:30,339 --> 01:18:37,584
I'd failed to protect you, but I
don't suppose you were surprised.

750
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:55,530
Being holed up down here
it's ridiculous.

751
01:18:55,531 --> 01:19:03,156
Spending my life in the mine was
precisely what I didn't want to do.

752
01:19:04,457 --> 01:19:12,047
Things are pretty fucked up.
And this is in nobody's interest.

753
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:21,345
Listen. I think everyone here
should do what they want to do.

754
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:28,438
But I intend to deliver that coffee.

755
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:35,195
- What are you gonna do?
- What a decent American should do.

756
01:19:35,196 --> 01:19:40,575
I'm gonna escort Clarabelle
to her cousin's.

757
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:46,706
And...
and let them become aroused?

758
01:19:46,707 --> 01:19:51,663
Yeah.

759
01:19:51,879 --> 01:19:57,843
Or alternatively, leave our
partners with the authorities-

760
01:19:57,844 --> 01:20:03,760
- and forget about the Dandies.

761
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:15,736
OK, I'm not one of you guys
and you guys know that.

762
01:20:15,737 --> 01:20:23,118
You guys are crazy
and you're going to get killed.

763
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:28,707
But I'll back you up, as long as I don't
have to take two in the back -

764
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:34,494
- and sacrifice myself
for some cause.

765
01:20:44,015 --> 01:20:49,395
The rest of them gave in to this
fateful logic. They were scared.

766
01:20:49,396 --> 01:20:55,401
But they agreed to do like the tribe
Freddie always talked about.

767
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:59,196
The one that prepared for battle
by cutting themselves.

768
01:20:59,197 --> 01:21:05,494
Their fear of being hit disappeared.
They crossed the barrier themselves.

769
01:21:05,495 --> 01:21:09,373
On three. One, two, three.

770
01:21:09,374 --> 01:21:13,419
Give me some more shells.

771
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:19,123
- We're all going up together.
- Can't go that way.

772
01:21:22,554 --> 01:21:27,808
So, dear Wendy...

773
01:21:27,809 --> 01:21:33,397
This is the time of year that I
first picked you up in the toy store.

774
01:21:33,398 --> 01:21:38,486
And now it's time to say goodbye.

775
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:43,574
I miss you.
And what is about to happen-

776
01:21:43,575 --> 01:21:47,995
- would have been more proper
with you by my side.

777
01:21:47,996 --> 01:21:54,168
But that's the way it is. No matter
how much we'd like it to be, -

778
01:21:54,169 --> 01:21:57,838
- not everything can be dandy.

779
01:21:57,839 --> 01:22:06,425
Eternally yours
Dick Dandelion.

780
01:22:07,015 --> 01:22:12,270
Here is a little extra note, Wendy.

781
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:16,774
I'm going out now, and I fear
the bullets from those guns.

782
01:22:16,775 --> 01:22:20,027
It is ironic.

783
01:22:20,028 --> 01:22:27,869
Because if it had been yours
I would have met them gratefully.

784
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:33,875
I always dreamed that if anyone
should make an exit wound in me, -

785
01:22:33,876 --> 01:22:38,004
- it should be you.

786
01:22:38,005 --> 01:22:42,926
The one that made me feel strong.

787
01:22:42,927 --> 01:22:49,390
I fear the other bullets.
But not yours, Wendy.

788
01:22:49,391 --> 01:22:58,060
And now: It's the time
of the season for loving.

789
01:23:04,156 --> 01:23:09,828
It's the time of the season

790
01:23:09,829 --> 01:23:14,833
when love runs high
in this time

791
01:23:14,834 --> 01:23:18,336
give it to me easy

792
01:23:18,337 --> 01:23:23,174
and let me try
with pleasured hands

793
01:23:23,175 --> 01:23:27,470
to take you in the sun
to promised lands

794
01:23:27,471 --> 01:23:29,681
to show you everyone

795
01:23:29,682 --> 01:23:37,856
it's the time of the season
for loving

796
01:23:37,857 --> 01:23:41,902
Dick?
You said it was up to each of us.

797
01:23:41,903 --> 01:23:47,908
- I want to go first.
- It's best if we stay together.

798
01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:53,410
After all, that was the plan.

799
01:23:54,665 --> 01:24:01,546
I'm done with being a loser, Dick.

800
01:24:01,547 --> 01:24:04,299
OK.

801
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:08,345
Huey and Lyndon go first.
Clear Zone 9.

802
01:24:08,346 --> 01:24:15,175
We follow after them. Let's go.

803
01:24:39,169 --> 01:24:45,466
- It's Krugsby.
- We won't need any reinforcements.

804
01:24:45,467 --> 01:24:51,305
I can bring these rodents to
their senses in three seconds flat.

805
01:24:51,306 --> 01:24:55,476
Absolutely, sir...

806
01:24:55,477 --> 01:24:59,772
- There he goes.
- What?

807
01:24:59,773 --> 01:25:06,195
- Marshall Walker is on his way here.
- The Marshall Walker?

808
01:25:06,196 --> 01:25:09,941
Yeah.

809
01:25:52,951 --> 01:25:57,610
Easy, boys.

810
01:26:01,668 --> 01:26:07,256
Easy, boys. Easy.

811
01:26:07,257 --> 01:26:10,426
Hi, everybody.

812
01:26:10,427 --> 01:26:19,429
I just want to say that
we don't want any trouble.

813
01:26:19,812 --> 01:26:25,233
We're not interested in shooting
anybody. So don't make us.

814
01:26:25,234 --> 01:26:33,523
We're gonna deliver some coffee
and take our guns home.

815
01:26:35,327 --> 01:26:41,291
Son, what are you doing
squaring off with us?

816
01:26:41,292 --> 01:26:46,254
I've had enough of this
trigger-happy bullshit, all right?

817
01:26:46,255 --> 01:26:53,216
You drop that pathetic gun
right this minute!

818
01:26:55,347 --> 01:27:00,018
Beautiful...

819
01:27:00,019 --> 01:27:03,980
- Marshall, we got a situation.
- Stand down.

820
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:11,273
Take it easy, boys.
I'll handle this.

821
01:27:32,635 --> 01:27:36,096
Now, son...

822
01:27:36,097 --> 01:27:44,184
I'm going to give you
a piece of advice.

823
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:51,278
Listen to me! Drop that
pathetic gun right this minute!

824
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:55,855
Wake up, Lyndon.

825
01:27:57,243 --> 01:28:02,039
Step back, step back.

826
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:07,794
Officer do-do-down, I'm afraid.

827
01:28:07,795 --> 01:28:12,507
Let's move forward. Freddie, take
Zone 4, Susan, you follow me,

828
01:28:12,508 --> 01:28:17,464
Stevie too.

829
01:28:20,099 --> 01:28:25,600
Here I come, Krugsby!

830
01:28:26,731 --> 01:28:31,058
Fire!

831
01:28:31,945 --> 01:28:38,145
Clarabelle got hit in the leg!

832
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:45,040
Hey! I can walk.

833
01:28:45,041 --> 01:28:49,378
Guys!

834
01:28:49,379 --> 01:28:54,633
Guys! Look, I can walk.

835
01:28:54,634 --> 01:28:59,210
Fire!

836
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:18,278
Can you see anything?

837
01:29:45,185 --> 01:29:49,563
Jesus Christ!

838
01:29:49,564 --> 01:29:52,900
Regroup!

839
01:29:52,901 --> 01:29:58,984
Hey! The Ferris wheel stopped.

840
01:30:01,952 --> 01:30:07,821
There's a sniper.

841
01:30:12,504 --> 01:30:18,718
132 yards, and there's a light wind
from the northwest.

842
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:21,846
Holy shit!
Stevie, we gotta get moving.

843
01:30:21,847 --> 01:30:28,676
I'll use a 7.63 mm with extra weight.
It should fall about three feet.

844
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:35,068
All set? Cock it.

845
01:30:35,069 --> 01:30:41,020
OK... on my count of three.

846
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:47,872
Wake up, Bad Steel.

847
01:30:47,873 --> 01:30:53,244
Did you get him?
Stevie got him!

848
01:31:08,894 --> 01:31:13,356
Stay low, everybody.
Stay low, stay low.

849
01:31:13,357 --> 01:31:17,527
They're over there in the corner.

850
01:31:17,528 --> 01:31:20,905
- What do you see?
- Over there by Shopside.

851
01:31:20,906 --> 01:31:26,657
We gotta go through Slope Corner.
Stay low.

852
01:31:27,788 --> 01:31:31,374
- Freddie, come here.
- Get down, buddy.

853
01:31:31,375 --> 01:31:35,086
We gotta get under cover
behind the Shack.

854
01:31:35,087 --> 01:31:40,175
Everybody ready?
On my count...

855
01:31:40,176 --> 01:31:43,845
One, two, three.

856
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:48,255
Take them out!

857
01:31:59,612 --> 01:32:02,614
- Hey, Stevie, Stevie...
- We still got a cup.

858
01:32:02,615 --> 01:32:09,496
Susan, they're in your store.
And they smashed the window.

859
01:32:09,497 --> 01:32:14,585
You'd just finished making it look
so nice. Go get them, Susan.

860
01:32:14,586 --> 01:32:20,205
- Stay low, baby!
- Get 'em, Susan.

861
01:32:28,099 --> 01:32:33,470
Wake up, Lee. Wake up, Grant.

862
01:32:41,571 --> 01:32:47,025
- Got two of them.
- Look out!

863
01:32:58,838 --> 01:33:02,383
Stevie! Whoa! Steve, get down!

864
01:33:02,384 --> 01:33:06,675
Wake up, Bad Steel.

865
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:22,441
What happened?

866
01:33:45,677 --> 01:33:51,463
Stevie's out.
We move to position three.

867
01:34:02,027 --> 01:34:07,279
Ah! My leg!

868
01:34:12,204 --> 01:34:15,373
Is she all right?

869
01:34:15,374 --> 01:34:20,670
- My leg!
- Everybody all right?

870
01:34:20,671 --> 01:34:25,958
Everybody all right?

871
01:34:31,181 --> 01:34:36,102
Dick, what's going on?
Can you see them?

872
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:41,557
Oh! It's tight down there.

873
01:34:41,734 --> 01:34:45,403
- Jesus Christ! Oh, fuck!
- What's wrong? You got hit?

874
01:34:45,404 --> 01:34:51,024
Yeah, it's my turn.

875
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:58,541
Woman, wake up!

876
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:03,368
Shit!

877
01:35:13,766 --> 01:35:18,722
He's down.

878
01:35:43,713 --> 01:35:50,385
He's all right.
Come on, we have to cross now.

879
01:35:50,386 --> 01:35:55,424
- He's up!
- Come on, Freddie!

880
01:36:36,766 --> 01:36:40,547
Come on, baby.

881
01:36:56,202 --> 01:37:01,081
No visual on suspect.

882
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:08,659
- There's only a coffee pot.
- Roger. Stand by.

883
01:37:10,258 --> 01:37:17,669
- Y'all regroup now.
- Let's go. One, two! Let's go!

884
01:37:21,019 --> 01:37:25,761
Watch out to the left.

885
01:37:31,947 --> 01:37:36,938
Wendy!

886
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:43,369
Shit, I'm out of here.

887
01:37:57,806 --> 01:38:01,642
Dear Wendy, I always dreamed-

888
01:38:01,643 --> 01:38:06,189
- that if anyone should make
that one final exit wound in me, -

889
01:38:06,190 --> 01:38:13,268
- it should be you. My savior.

890
01:38:17,451 --> 01:38:22,276
Stupid, stupid...

891
01:38:24,917 --> 01:38:32,465
...the way I feel inside
my heart for you

892
01:38:32,466 --> 01:38:36,511
would you say that you

893
01:38:36,512 --> 01:38:40,265
would try to love me too

894
01:38:40,266 --> 01:38:46,354
in your mind, would you ever be
really close to me?

895
01:38:46,355 --> 01:38:49,983
I can tell the way you smile

896
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:54,654
if I feel
that I could be certain then

897
01:38:54,655 --> 01:39:01,153
I would say the things
I want to say tonight

898
01:39:02,329 --> 01:39:05,790
- Pacifichism...
- Pacifism.

899
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:13,962
I'm a forensic pathologist with
a special interest in firearms.

900
01:39:23,476 --> 01:39:29,641
That's a nice gun
you got for Sebastian.

901
01:39:42,161 --> 01:39:44,994
Wendy...

902
01:39:45,305 --> 01:39:51,433
