During your presidency,
there was a lot of social unrest.



So if you could go back in time,
what would you change?



Try and think. Perhaps all the people
who died during the protests?



Yes, l... l don't know.



l see you!



l've got you!



Our proposaI wiII give BoIivia
a brighter future.



l know that it will be hard,



but together we will triumph.



His commercial is horrible.
lt's technically embarrassing.



Basically, he doesn't relate
to the Bolivian people.



ln my opinion,
it's totally wrong.



lt is unacceptable
that our natural resources



continue to be looted
and exploited illegally.



This is something
l am determined to stop.



They cannot keep
stealing from us.



My priority is jobs,



which l believe is
the priority of all Bolivians.



Jobs, jobs, jobs.



Jobs building roads
and building schools,



which the Bolivian people
desperately need.



l'm sure that
my esteemed opponents



could argue all night long...



Once again, indigenous
protestors paralyze the capital,



demanding constitutional reforms



that would give them
adequate representation.



And that's why l'm here today:
to say that we have a plan



to combat this crisis,



to overcome this crisis.



That's why l'm asking
all of you to join me



in this fight.



For Bolivia,



with Castillo!



We are rich in petroleum.
We have lithium.



We have compressed natural gas.



What l'm saying is,
Bolivia is an immensely rich country.



Raise your hand if you speak English.



Explain it to the others, please.



Children are a blessing from God,
and l have been doubly blessed.



A father wants his children
to be proud of him.



That's why l promise the Bolivian people
that l will run a positive campaign.



As deputy of Potos√≠,



Victor Rivera used taxpayers' money
to buy twenty-seven SUVs.



But he took enough of your money
to buy thirty and a half.



Where did the rest of your money go?



ls Victor Rivera helping you?



Or is he helping himself?



Death to the Yankees!



What's up, buddy?



Those are the Americans
that work for Castillo.



l've seen them before.



They're the enemy and you bring them here?



She's the one who gave me the steak sauce.



Next time, tell her to give us
the fucking steak.



Who's winning?



You're a fucking suck-up.



You don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know anything about politics.



You're fucking lame.



Only an idiot would trust Castillo.



What did you say?



-You heard me.
-Fuck, you're talking about your father.



Shut your mouth, have more respect.



-You heard me.
-Shut up.



The invisible hand.



Yes, hairy balls, delicious.



Thank you, my beloved Bolivian family.
Thank you for receiving me here today.



A president must be sensitive.



A president must travel the whole country,
listening to his people.



That's why l'm starting this journey
today: to listen to those in need,



to those who hope for a better future.



l spoke to a boy the other day,
seven years old....



l promise you
that when l am president of Bolivia,



this will not happen.



l want this boy to go to school
and have a future.



l want to dedicate this song



to my beloved Bolivian people.



Some say love,



lt is a river



We're done.



Let's go, thank you.



Some say love,



lt is a hunger



What's going on?



l was just about to cry!



Good afternoon, ladies.



l came to tell you that
we have a crisis in Bolivia.



A big crisis: social,
economic, and political.



This is a socioeconomic crisis.



We need action



and not empty words!



What do you think?



This is a crisis of corruption,



corruption that's becoming
hyper-corruption.



l'm here



to fight against the corruption.



Pedro lgnacio Castillo,



he's been our president before,
and today he's a new man.



We need action



and not empty words.



But fighting together side by side,



we can save Bolivia from this crisis.



l know you don't
want to talk about this,



but just to make it clear
to the audience,



are you a member of
the Cult of the Cosmic Wind?



No, l am not a member.



And you don't think you can fly?



lf you look at the polls,
you'll see l can't fly.



ls your son a member of this church?



Yes.



l know you don't want
to go into this topic,



but let's start with this:



Why don't you want
to talk about your son?



l believe that when you're in politics,



you're an easy target.



But not all of the people
who are close to you



want to be participants.



And that's why l think that



they shouldn't be involved
in campaigns.



My son has his private life



with highs and lows.



Difficulties with drugs?



Yes.



But...



He's a very private person, and...



l don't want to...
l don't want to talk about this.



Are you close to your son?



Not as much as l'd like to be, no.



Ladies and gentlemen,



the next president of Bolivia!



We have come a long way
in a short time,



but we still have
so much further to go.



With you, the people
of Bolivia, behind me,



l know that no one can stop us!



l never knew Klaus Barbie.



They are desperate because
we're climbing in the polls,



and we won't stop
until we pass fifty percent.



One more thing, polls show



you've dropped
another three points.



Please calm down.
Stop throwing rocks



because you've already
broken my windshield.



Why are you protesting?



We're asking
for constitutional reform



so that our people have--



We have the same jacket.



--adequate representation.



Then talk to me, please.
l want to listen.



Are you thinking about



bringing in the lnternational
Monetary Fund



like President Lozada did?



Well, that's a question of--



lf you truly believe in democracy,



then practice it here with
my people, ask questions.



But l do want to listen!
l want to listen!



l've learned from Lozada.



l won't bring in the lMF
without a referendum first.



Because if you defend democracy,
you are the voice of the people.



lf l win the election, l promise--



The people will be watching.



We'd like to pass
through with our bus now.



Go ahead, continue.
This is a free country.



Thank you very much.



For freedom and democracy,
long live Bolivia!



-We're going to be watching.
-Thank you very much.



And that jacket, l tell you,
is very nice.



ls there any coffee left?



Are you okay?



The U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia
spoke today about Salvador Velasco.



l was going to vote for Rivera,



but they're trying to tell me
what to do,



and now l'm voting for Velasco.



Maybe l should hire him to be
my campaign manager.



lf he keeps talking like that,
l'll be more than happy.



Let me tell you one thing:



With age comes wisdom.



To run a country like this,
with all its problems,



with all its complexities,



to put this country in the
hands of the inexperienced,



it's a fatal error.



What you see here
this evening is, indeed,



what you always see
in the course of this campaign:



candidates who are more interested
in fighting with each other



instead of fighting the crisis
that is destroying our country.



A great man once said,



"lt may be possible to hold
power based on guns,



but it is far better to win
the heart of a nation."



Election day has arrived,



and record voter turnout
is expected.



l'm voting for Castillo,
no matter what my family says.



Good afternoon, sir!



Excuse me.



ls the Senator in?



The President-elect is in a meeting.



l have this little gift.



You can leave it with me.



l'd like to wait.



l can just wait there quietly.



-What do we want?
-Change!



-When do we want it?
-Now!
