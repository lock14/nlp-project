1
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:57,255
I am announcing today my candidacy

2
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,125
for the presidency
of the United States.

3
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:05,360
I do not run for the presidency
merely to oppose any man,

4
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,697
but to propose new policies.

5
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,568
<i>I run because I am convinced</i>

6
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,596
<i>that this country is
on a perilous course</i>

7
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:17,407
<i>and because I have
such strong feelings</i>

8
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,141
<i>about what must be done,</i>

9
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,241
<i>and I feel that I'm obliged</i>

10
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:24,774
<i>to do all that I can.</i>

11
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:28,482
Hell, no, we
won't go! Hell, no, we won't go!

12
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:32,083
<i>There's a time when</i>

13
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>the operation of the machine
becomes so odious...</i>

14
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,459
<i>I shall not seek</i>

15
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,489
<i>and I will not accept</i>

16
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,229
<i>the nomination of my party
for another term</i>

17
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,294
<i>as your president.</i>

18
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,239
<i>Some very sad news for all of you,</i>

19
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,904
<i>and, I think, uh, sad news
for all of our fellow citizens</i>

20
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,574
<i>and people who love peace</i>

21
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,709
<i>all over the world,
and that is that, uh,</i>

22
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,480
<i>Martin Luther King was shot</i>

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,580
<i>and was killed tonight
in Memphis, Tennessee.</i>

24
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,420
<i>We're gonna say to the whole</i>

25
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,720
<i>damn government:
"Stick 'em up, mother. "</i>

26
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,126
Bobby Kennedy's the only
white man in America I trust.

27
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,924
<i>If I have reason to believe</i>

28
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,800
<i>that there's gonna be a riot
started, and somebody tells me</i>

29
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,805
<i>that there's gonna be trouble
if you don't stop them,</i>

30
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,965
then it's my duty to stop them.

31
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:21,632
Then you go out and arrest them?

32
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,699
Oh, absolutely.

33
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,903
How can you go arrest somebody

34
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,241
if they haven't violated the law?

35
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,576
They're ready to violate the law.

36
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,206
In other words...

37
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:31,218
<i>Could I suggest
in the luncheon period of time</i>

38
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,311
<i>that the sheriff
and the district attorney</i>

39
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,515
<i>read the Constitution
of the United States?</i>

40
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,991
<i>I don't want to be part
of the United States,</i>

41
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,993
<i>I don't want to be part
of the American people,</i>

42
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,393
<i>and have them write of us</i>

43
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,262
<i>as they wrote of Rome:
"They made a desert,</i>

44
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,460
<i>and they called it peace. "</i>

45
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,863
<i>Your generation, this generation,</i>

46
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:57,844
<i>cannot afford to waste
its substance and its hope</i>

47
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,846
<i>in the struggles of the past.</i>

48
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,542
<i>For beyond these walls</i>

49
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,643
<i>is a world to be helped and improved</i>

50
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,349
<i>and made safe
for the welfare of mankind.</i>

51
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,692
Do we know anything yet?

52
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,963
We got men on the sixth floor

53
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,834
going from room to room.
You the manager?

54
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,136
Paul Ebbers.
And the bungalows?

55
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,198
We're checking them now.

56
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,210
5574.

57
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,643
Roger that.

58
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,579
- It's a false alarm.
- False alarm.

59
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,442
I wouldn't want to be you today.

60
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:42,182
Occupational hazard.
We'll open the cafe.

61
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,214
You or your men want
coffee, a hot breakfast,

62
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,452
- it's on the house.
- Thanks.

63
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,221
It'll take us a little while
to wrap this up,

64
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,523
but I'll let the boys know.

65
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,156
We're gonna need to
open a lane here for traffic.

66
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,790
False alarm.

67
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,357
Yeah. I didn't know
you were in this early.

68
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,425
Are you kidding?

69
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,596
Have you seen my schedule for today?

70
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,936
Hey, Paul.

71
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,339
What the heck's going on here?

72
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,070
There's a hook and ladder keeping me

73
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,203
from my first cup of coffee
and crosswords.

74
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,941
Don't you have a home, John?

75
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,108
Well, this is my home, you know that.

76
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,741
Retirement doesn't suit you, does it?

77
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:11,842
No, sir.

78
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,877
This is not the muscle tone
of a retired man.

79
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,549
If it were up to me,
John, you'd still be

80
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,887
in uniform, still at that door.

81
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,655
Oh, that's great. Hold it.

82
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:24,095
Okay, one more.

83
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,964
Everybody smile.

84
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,127
Thank you.

85
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,329
Thank you.

86
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:34,068
You guys can put out my fire anytime.

87
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,210
And how are you, my baby?

88
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,476
We're gonna go back up
to bed, aren't we?

89
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,846
Ladies and gentlemen,

90
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,181
if I may have your attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen.

91
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,516
We are very sorry.

92
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,145
This has been a false alarm.

93
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,122
Yes. Uh...

94
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,557
you are free to return
to your rooms at this time

95
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:56,393
or join us in one of our cafes
for a complimentary breakfast.

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,624
And once again, on behalf of the...

97
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:58,962
Jack?

98
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,933
Welcome to Los Angeles.

99
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,936
Sir.

100
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,234
The polls are open
in South Dakota, fellas.

101
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,570
Let's go.

102
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,873
How long has it been
since you've slept?

103
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,379
How long has it been
since you've slept?

104
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,041
We bring home California,

105
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,516
we'll all sleep
a hell of a lot better.

106
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,165
Timmons.

107
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,732
Damn it. Damn it.

108
00:05:57,558 --> 00:06:00,083
- Good morning, my brown brother.
- Hey.

109
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,357
You know you're working
a double, right?

110
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,626
How come everybody knows but me?

111
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,690
And that's the third time this week.

112
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,759
For once, I'd like to
be asked, "Hey, Jose,

113
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,202
would you mind working
a double shift today?"

114
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,172
- That'll never happen.
- Why not?

115
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,072
Because you're Mexican, that's why.

116
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,339
I'm Latino.

117
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,039
Latino?

118
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,876
Jose, you're a fuckin' Mexican, okay?

119
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,245
Call yourself what you will;

120
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,079
You're no different
than the rest of us.

121
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,449
If you don't like the double shift,

122
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,510
there's a hundred guys

123
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,418
out there on the other side
of that door

124
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,082
that'll take your place like this.

125
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,957
And if it makes you feel any better...

126
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,461
I'm working a double shift, too, so...

127
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:38,294
we'll both be here until midnight.

128
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,268
I got tickets to see Drysdale pitch

129
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,067
against Pittsburgh tonight.

130
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,507
- Is that right?
- He's on a streak.

131
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,568
You know?

132
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,110
Field level.

133
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:00,279
These are good tickets.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,447
I was gonna take my dad.

135
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,252
He's never been to a game.

136
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,692
Well, he ain't going to one tonight.

137
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,720
So, if I were you,
I'd sell those tickets.

138
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,891
I can help you with that.

139
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,298
Son of a bitch.

140
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:18,168
Timmons, he doesn't show me
the decency of the respect.

141
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,298
- Yeah, you know why?
- Why?

142
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,932
Because you're Mexican.

143
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,842
And a busboy.

144
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,778
Hey, we're the new niggers, brother.

145
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:27,940
Get used to it.

146
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,811
Shit.

147
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,444
"Latino."

148
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,336
Well...

149
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,100
I missed all the excitement, I see.

150
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,768
Oh, it's not much to speak of.

151
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,800
Well, it's the Ambassador Hotel.

152
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,437
People coming, people going.

153
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,505
Nothing ever happens.

154
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,778
<i>Grand Hotel.</i>

155
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,114
What about it?

156
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,849
<i>It's a line from the old
Greta Garbo movie, Grand Hotel.</i>

157
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,356
Okay, John.

158
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,483
<i>Ever seen Grand Hotel, Henry?</i>

159
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,858
- No, I haven't, Mr. Casey.
- No, of course you didn't.

160
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,624
<i>I have seen Bonnie and Clyde, though.</i>

161
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,062
Ah, that's a good film.

162
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,532
<i>Have you seen
Bonnie and Clyde, Nelson?</i>

163
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,262
I saw it with you.

164
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,469
Thank you, Henry.
Have a good day.

165
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,669
Thank you, Mr. Casey.

166
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,440
You know, I stood at that door
from the first day

167
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,413
the Ambassador opened back in 1921,

168
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:37,144
and I greeted everyone:
FDR, Truman, Eisenhower,

169
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,778
Jack Kennedy, Johnson,
Premier Khrushchev,

170
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,347
the Shah of Iran,
King of Sweden, all of them.

171
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,826
Madame Chiang Kai-Shek... she
rented the entire fifth floor.

172
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,318
I personally delivered the
Oriental furniture to her suite.

173
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,195
It was antiques, mostly.

174
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,597
Oh, yes, and one night, I, uh,

175
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,124
I caught Will Rogers having a pee.

176
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,193
He was taking a piss
in the greenhouse.

177
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,070
He tried to convince me
it was good for the plants.

178
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,768
He said, "Good
for the shrubbery, boy."

179
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,708
I said, "Don't do it again,
sir."

180
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,304
And I also danced at the Grove
when I was off duty

181
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,712
with, uh, Barbara Stanwyck,
believe it or not,

182
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,410
and Dolores del Rio and Rita Hayworth.

183
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,576
I was quite a dancer.

184
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,848
She was a beautiful woman, mind you.

185
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,913
And I heard Bing Crosby
sing at the Grove, too.

186
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:20,688
Yeah, and Sinatra, too,
of course, and Rudy Vallee.

187
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,319
Sophie Tucker, Ruby Keeler.

188
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,920
Yeah, and Cab Calloway, I think.

189
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:28,365
Yes, sir. All good
things in this hotel.

190
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,801
Yeah.

191
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:33,602
Can I see the sports section?

192
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,081
Her boobs.
I read about it somewhere.

193
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:42,945
Anne Bancroft is not

194
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,176
gonna show her breasts in a film.

195
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,514
She's a good-looking lady, Coop.

196
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,315
I'm not saying she's not
a good-looking lady.

197
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,083
Oh, like you wouldn't,
if you had the chance?

198
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:52,091
Anne Bancroft has too much class
to show her breasts in a film.

199
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,353
That's it.
That's the facts.

200
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,258
It's not just a film, Coop.

201
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,523
<i>It's The Graduate.</i>

202
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,292
Mm, I love that movie.

203
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,892
- More coffee?
- Yes, please.

204
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,425
Okay, so I have a question for you.

205
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,438
What do you think,
Bancroft or body double?

206
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,133
- The nude scenes?
- Mm-hmm.

207
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,698
Flashes.
They're not even scenes.

208
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,266
Body double.
For sure.

209
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,175
Wait. You know this for a fact?

210
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,975
Well, no, but it's what I would do.

211
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,879
That is, if I ever actually got hired

212
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,544
- for a movie I auditioned for.
- You will. You will.

213
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,280
Plus, you're my favorite ingenue.

214
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,845
And you got a great smile,
and you're nice to us,

215
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,447
and you know
how to pour coffee so well.

216
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,788
You know what?
He actually thinks

217
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,726
he knows what he's doing
with that thing.

218
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,092
I do know what I'm doing
with this thing.

219
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,619
- No, you don't.
- You look like a movie star.

220
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,961
Really? Who put it on 13 frames?

221
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,660
- There you go.
- Well, say a prayer for me,

222
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,761
'cause tomorrow
I'm interviewing for Schwab's.

223
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,998
Oh, wow, good for you.

224
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,667
Schwabs, is that a director
or producer or something?

225
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,300
No, moron, Schwab's on Sunset.

226
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,208
Lana Turner was discovered there.

227
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,303
Oh, Schwab's.

228
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,711
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, every

229
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,215
out-of-work actress
in Hollywood is trying

230
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,876
to get a gig there
waiting the lunch counter.

231
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,441
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

232
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,286
Hey, I guarantee you,
if Hitchcock asked her

233
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,225
to show her tits in a film,
she'd do it in a heartbeat.

234
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,659
Daryl.

235
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,689
I'll call you back.

236
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,428
I do everything I can
to make sure that

237
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,959
the employees of this hotel
are treated equally and fairly.

238
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,164
I'm getting complaints
that you're not allowing

239
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,106
the kitchen staff off work
to vote today.

240
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,541
We're understaffed this week.

241
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,168
I've got six workers with the flu.

242
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,769
I've had to deny sick leave, too.

243
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,644
Did you tell them they couldn't leave?

244
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,775
This is no small thing
we're doing tonight.

245
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,580
I need every staffer
with a pulse on duty.

246
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,849
Did you tell them that they
couldn't leave to vote?

247
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,947
They're not gonna vote.

248
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,390
Half of them are illegal;
They can't vote.

249
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:33,893
Why give them the time off

250
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,124
for something they can't do anyway?

251
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:46,001
You'll post a memo informing
all employees of their right

252
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,232
to vote.

253
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,902
They can't put two words
of English together.

254
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,844
Put up a memo
in English and in Spanish

255
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,541
informing all employees
of their right to vote

256
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,914
and allowing them
the privilege to do so.

257
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:01,045
Additionally, you will inform
them that they will be paid

258
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,318
for their time off for this privilege.

259
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,550
And...

260
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,355
because I'm an equal-opportunity
kind of guy,

261
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,259
you've got till the end of the week

262
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,093
to clear out your desk and leave.

263
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,463
You're fired, Daryl.

264
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:21,868
Good morning. Ambassador Hotel.
How may I direct your call?

265
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,344
Please hold.

266
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,902
Good morning.
Ambassador Hotel.

267
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,313
How may I connect your call?

268
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,680
Please hold.

269
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,981
One moment, please.

270
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,350
Good morning.
Ambassador Hotel.

271
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,752
Good morning. Ambassador Hotel.

272
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:36,983
How may I direct your call?

273
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,991
I'm sorry, but I can't
give out that information.

274
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,492
Please hold for the reservation desk.

275
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:44,657
It's the policy of the hotel.

276
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,723
Yes, it is.

277
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,398
Well, if you are his wife,
then you should have

278
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,905
his room number, now, shouldn't you?

279
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,304
What a bitch.

280
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,603
Husband's playing around,

281
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,405
and she wants to take it out on me.

282
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,706
No, no, no. Not today.

283
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,007
No, thank you.

284
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,046
- Speaking of...
- Don't start.

285
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,142
Ambassador Hotel.
How may I direct your call?

286
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,948
It's gonna bring you
nothing but trouble,

287
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,385
Angela, you don't end that.

288
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,548
Hey, do you have plans tonight?

289
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,956
Yeah. I got a hot date
with my Magnavox.

290
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,357
Do you want to go
to the party with me?

291
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,953
For Kennedy?

292
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,965
I didn't think employees were
allowed at hotel functions.

293
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,365
Well, screwing the boss
does have its advantages.

294
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,629
Oh, God.

295
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,637
Look, I know it ain't easy.

296
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,902
I know it's damn near impossible
to find a good man out there.

297
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,910
Seems like
all the good ones are taken.

298
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,411
But a married one?

299
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,744
I'm not good at being alone.

300
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,080
You stay with a married man
who ain't gonna leave his wife,

301
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,983
and you're looking at a lifetime
of being alone.

302
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,351
Honey, don't kid yourself.

303
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,451
Ambassador Hotel.
How may I connect you?

304
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,724
America was a great force in the world

305
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,736
with immense prestige

306
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,501
long before we became
a great military power.

307
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,237
And that power has come to us,
and we cannot renounce it.

308
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,677
But neither can we afford to forget

309
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,546
that the real constructive force
in this world

310
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,110
comes not from tanks or not from bombs

311
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:16,452
but from the imaginative ideas,
the warm sympathies

312
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,719
and the generous spirit of a people.

313
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,803
One thing is clear
in this year of 1968,

314
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:34,500
I believe, in this country
as I've traveled across,

315
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,773
and that is that the American
people want no more Vietnam.

316
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,381
California can make the difference.

317
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,351
Test one, two. Test one, two.

318
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,713
Miss, uh, Jan... Jana...

319
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:52,918
Janacek.

320
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,087
Yes. Perhaps I need to
remind you, Miss, uh...?

321
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,619
- Janacek.
- Exactly.

322
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,632
That there is a law against loitering.

323
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,793
I've been in this lobby
for the past two days

324
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,030
waiting for my interview
with Senator Kennedy.

325
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,765
Miss...

326
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,864
there are no rooms available
at the hotel,

327
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,569
and no records of your credentials

328
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,305
with regards to the senator's
press corps.

329
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,835
What does this look like?

330
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,405
I write for an
international publication.

331
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:22,117
<i>Rude Pravo.</i>

332
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:26,785
<i>Well, it's not exactly
the Washington Post, now, is it?</i>

333
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,211
Excuse me.

334
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:58,986
Hi, um, I have an appointment
for a manicure-pedicure.

335
00:15:59,025 --> 00:15:59,992
Oh.

336
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,587
Yup. And you are...

337
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,860
our lovely bride-to-be.

338
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,230
Yes, ma'am.

339
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,700
Well, let me see 'em.

340
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,032
Excuse me?

341
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,035
Oh.

342
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,632
Oh...

343
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,912
You know he's gonna
break it tonight, man.

344
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,447
What?

345
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,677
Drysdale, consecutive shutouts,
it's gonna happen tonight.

346
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,549
Yeah, maybe.

347
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,918
You don't know
how important this is, Miguel.

348
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,820
Jose, it's one baseball game.

349
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,324
You can buy tickets to another night.

350
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,690
What?!

351
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,457
No, no, no, no.
It's not just a game, okay?

352
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,260
Don Drysdale has pitched
five consecutive shutouts.

353
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,529
That's a record
that has stood since 1904

354
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,593
by Doc White of the Chicago White Sox.

355
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,103
He's gonna break it tonight, man.

356
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,662
I know he is.

357
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,539
Who, Drysdale?

358
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,168
Yeah.

359
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,975
You got money on the game, Jose?

360
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,277
No, I'm-I'm just a fan.

361
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,515
Well, then, go Dodgers.

362
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,284
Yeah.

363
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,916
I need to see you in my office.

364
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,153
I'm supposed to tell the staff

365
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,354
to go to their polling place
today and vote.

366
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:13,025
I'm not old enough to vote.

367
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,863
I'm a felon.

368
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,332
You're a felon?

369
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,708
Nah, I'm just kidding, brother.

370
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,235
'Course I'm gonna vote today.

371
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,111
Now, listen, a lot of people,

372
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,745
a lot of people are
gonna be intimidated

373
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,483
by this thing because it's new,
all right?

374
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,718
So I'm counting on all of you

375
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,249
to reassure them
that it's perfectly legitimate,

376
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,591
it's easy...

377
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,426
Just-just for one minute,
please.

378
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:48,230
It's easy, and it makes voting
simpler and quicker, all right?

379
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,828
All you have to do is
turn the plastic pages.

380
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,805
Names and offices appear on the left.

381
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,537
Simply make your choice and push
down firmly in the proper place

382
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,910
with the steel stylus
attached to the vote recorder.

383
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,915
All right? Now, when
you're finished with that,

384
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,315
take out the paper ballot.

385
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,785
And I want you all to check,
check the back of it,

386
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,721
all right, to make sure
that there are no stray bits

387
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,658
of punched-out paper called
"card-hole-aggregate debris."

388
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,160
Or what the, uh, what the folks

389
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,822
down at IBM
like to call "chads."

390
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,195
If I'd have worked
this hard in school,

391
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,494
I'd be on the honor roll.

392
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,763
Hey, you think your brother
will loan us his car again?

393
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:23,928
Ah, I don't know.

394
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,561
He was cool with it
the first couple times,

395
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,765
but now, I don't know.

396
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,501
I can't do another day
on this awful bus, Coop.

397
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,270
- Me neither.
- I hate it.

398
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,937
Maybe if I was stoned.

399
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,138
Well, yeah, stoned would be good
whether we're on the bus or not.

400
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,875
- Fellas.
- Wade. -Wade.

401
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,542
You guys are on
the Glendale-Pasadena bus today.

402
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,846
Well, no, uh, we were actually

403
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,116
gonna come over here to tell you,

404
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,350
we got a car today, Wade.

405
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,584
Uh, Coop's brother
comes through again.

406
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,253
Really?

407
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,194
Um, just think of
the number of elderly

408
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,255
we can help get
to the polls with a car.

409
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,129
I think we're much more
valuable on our own.

410
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,134
Yeah.

411
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,430
Well, that's great.

412
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,130
Maybe you can persuade them
to go along with you.

413
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,138
Every little bit counts, right?

414
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,141
Uh, what precincts
are you guys covering?

415
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,200
Actually, Dwayne and I
won't be in the field today.

416
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,643
We're gonna stay here
at campaign headquarters.

417
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,112
That way, we can take care
of any problems that come up.

418
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,342
Yeah, we already received a call

419
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,850
about stolen voting machines
down in Precinct 180.

420
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,876
I'm not familiar with that area.

421
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,388
It's a black neighborhood.

422
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,390
Oh, is it?

423
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,550
Yeah, I guess busing

424
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,184
doesn't really agree
with you fellas, huh?

425
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,355
I guess we got more in
common than you think.

426
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,232
Good luck.

427
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
if we could get...

428
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,706
Now all we have to do
is actually get a car.

429
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,833
Well, first things first.

430
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,274
First things first.

431
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,868
Mr. Buckley.

432
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,607
Please, Mr. Buckley.

433
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:41,773
Mr. Buckley, please.

434
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,281
Yes, Miss...?

435
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,147
- Janacek.
- Yes, Miss Janacek.

436
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,380
You told me on Sunday
that I would have my interview

437
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,081
with Senator Kennedy,
but no interview.

438
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,056
Then you said Monday.
Monday, no interview.

439
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,580
Five minutes, Mr. Buckley,
that's all I'm asking...

440
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,092
Miss Janacek, I believe
I also told you

441
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,719
that you have to call
his press secretary.

442
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,787
I left 20 messages
for Mr. Mankiewicz.

443
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,821
Well, perhaps you'd like to
join the volunteers today,

444
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,458
hop on one of the buses.

445
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,299
The only thing I want is five minutes

446
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,770
with Senator Kennedy.

447
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,739
Does he have any idea what's happening

448
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,105
in Czechoslovakia right now?

449
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,440
The censorship law has been repealed.

450
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,138
The people are energized.

451
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,977
Bobby Kennedy is an inspiration
to the Czech people.

452
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,505
Miss Janacek, you are
a Communist writer

453
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,074
for a Communist paper in a country

454
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,086
that is an ally of the Soviet Union.

455
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,850
I mean... do you have any idea

456
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,949
how that would look for the senator?

457
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,260
"Be informed."

458
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,531
<i>"Informados importante. "</i>

459
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,266
<i>"Informados...</i>

460
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,002
<i>importante. "</i>

461
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,571
<i>"Importante. "</i>

462
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,844
It's almost like you just add an "E"

463
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,146
to the end of every
English word. Huh.

464
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,676
Almost.

465
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:57,656
All right, let's keep going here.

466
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,251
"Employees must be informed
of their right to vote."

467
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,488
<i>"Los empleados deben estar</i>

468
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,086
<i>informados
de derecho de votar. "</i>

469
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,065
I might need some help spelling that.

470
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,228
L-O-S...

471
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,598
Love or money?

472
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:16,631
Pardon me?

473
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,665
The reason you're getting married.

474
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,905
Love or money?

475
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:22,875
I'm saving a life,

476
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:26,180
marrying a boy from my school.

477
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,210
There's a lot of that
going on these days.

478
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:33,749
The government sends a check
to the spouse for $135 a month.

479
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,817
Mm.

480
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,761
It's definitely not for money.

481
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,924
Well, I married for love.

482
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,627
He was

483
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:45,502
the most handsome man I had ever seen.

484
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,904
He looked like a movie star.

485
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,967
He could have had any woman
he wanted, and he picked me.

486
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,206
You picked him, too.

487
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,772
Yeah.

488
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,149
Suppose I did.

489
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,685
What color is your dress?

490
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,124
Lavender.

491
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,253
Maybe a bit lighter.

492
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:13,459
We have polish to match
that, if you like.

493
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,466
Sure.

494
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,196
Yeah?

495
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,534
Big wedding?

496
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,062
No.

497
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,667
No, my father refuses to go.

498
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,975
He calls the shots.

499
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,743
My father's a veteran.

500
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,342
Uh, he thinks William, my groom,

501
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:35,650
should take whatever tour
they give him.

502
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,249
You see, if he's married,
he goes to Germany.

503
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,852
If not, then, um,

504
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:45,261
he's more likely to go
straight to the front lines.

505
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,766
My father thinks he's a coward.

506
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,498
What do you think?

507
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,529
You know, more and more

508
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:58,635
young men keep coming back
in body bags.

509
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:02,136
Two last week
from my graduating class.

510
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,478
And if I could've married them

511
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,381
and kept them from getting
killed, then I would've.

512
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,690
So, until someone in charge tells me

513
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,591
why it is that we're over there,

514
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:18,119
then...

515
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,132
I don't know.

516
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:25,127
You are gonna be the prettiest

517
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:28,163
June bride in this hotel today, dear.

518
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,545
English and Spanish.

519
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,547
Great.

520
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,811
I've given six years
of my life to this place.

521
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,181
It means everything to me.

522
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,810
I'll give you a fine recommendation.

523
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:44,084
You're not gonna have any
problems finding another job.

524
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,455
I don't want
another goddamn job, Paul.

525
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,656
<i>Hello.</i>

526
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,163
<i>I don't know if I have</i>

527
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,324
that portfolio with me.

528
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:56,233
You know, we're three hours
behind you.

529
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,497
Say again.

530
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,437
No, I'm saying

531
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:02,407
we're three hours in time
behind New York.

532
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,909
I can't say for sure.

533
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,036
Oh, damn.

534
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,045
What is it?

535
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,273
It's nothing.

536
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,838
- What is...?
- It's stupid.

537
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,543
No, no, I'm listening.

538
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,573
You know those black shoes?

539
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,585
What?

540
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,109
I told you it was stupid.

541
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,520
Let me call you back.

542
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,516
I bought this dress to go with

543
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,961
the black shoes I forgot to pack.

544
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,591
I did pack six other pair,
none of them black.

545
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,828
And I have two pair of tennis shoes,

546
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,564
so if you're up
for a little game later...

547
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,970
You see, women have to pack
for every occasion,

548
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:37,339
making it virtually impossible
to travel light.

549
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,310
Like tonight, it's a formal event,

550
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,438
so I brought formal wear.

551
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,780
But... God has a sense of humor.

552
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,546
So I... I bring backup.

553
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,721
However, I'm doubly screwed.

554
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,918
Two dresses, both black,
and no black shoes.

555
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,256
I know you're probably thinking,

556
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,591
"Who the hell cares what
color shoes she's wearing?"

557
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:59,120
Believe me, Jack, women notice.

558
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:05,065
So, basically, you're saying
you need to go shopping.

559
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,368
For shoes.

560
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,771
Black shoes.

561
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,410
At least I don't have to get up

562
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,606
three times a night to go have a pee.

563
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,582
Well, at least I get
out of bed to have one.

564
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,650
Checkmate.

565
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,215
See, when you make a move
out of frustration or anger,

566
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,558
it always ends in catastrophe.

567
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,462
Ah, to beat you just once, Casey.

568
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,728
I'd like to die knowing
that I've beaten you just once.

569
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,756
It's all I pray for, Lord.

570
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,428
Keep praying.

571
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,437
Hey, Paul.

572
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:39,529
Gentlemen.

573
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,199
Would you like to replace
an elderly gentleman

574
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,367
while he goes off to
take his afternoon nap?

575
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,066
Nelson, if I may...

576
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,808
you could have held
your rook in reserve,

577
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:49,974
given up one of your pawns

578
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,845
and turned this game
back around in your favor.

579
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:52,976
Now you tell me.

580
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,316
Hey, Mr. Fallon.

581
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,844
Hey, puppy, come here.

582
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:57,878
Beautiful girl.

583
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,482
Come here.

584
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,356
She's a beautiful
little thing. Oh, yeah.

585
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,383
How's your wife?

586
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,486
She's perfect.

587
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,791
- We're a sold-out show tonight.
- Yeah?

588
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,819
You and Mrs. Fallon getting

589
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,059
everything you need from my staff?

590
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,191
We are, Paul, thank you.

591
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,225
Jefferson once said
about the United States

592
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,533
that we were the last best hope
for mankind.

593
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,540
That's what I want
the United States to be.

594
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,099
This is a generous
and compassionate country.

595
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,168
That's what I want
this country to stand for.

596
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:22,703
Not violence, not lawlessness,
not disorder,

597
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,308
but compassion and love and peace.

598
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,943
That's what this country
should stand for.

599
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,216
And that's what I intend to do,
if I'm elected president.

600
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,088
"And that's what I intend to do
if I'm elected president."

601
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,163
- Hey.
- Hey.

602
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,866
Yes?

603
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,534
We were here yesterday.

604
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:54,335
Yes?

605
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,508
We...

606
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,711
We purchased some, uh...

607
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:00,844
Goods.

608
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,581
Goods from you yesterday.

609
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,928
Floor?

610
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,597
Um... four.

611
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,938
Mm. That's where I'm going.

612
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,500
I know you, right?

613
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,445
You, uh, you work here, don't you?

614
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,346
Uh, switchboard.

615
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,510
And you?

616
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,382
Kitchen.
Food and beverage.

617
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,388
Huh. That's got
to beat the pants off

618
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,447
of sitting at the switchboard all day.

619
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,549
Not that I'm complaining.

620
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:41,389
It's just got to be
more stimulating than:

621
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:42,792
"Good morning.
Ambassador Hotel.

622
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,056
How may I direct
your call?"

623
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,290
Grass is always greener.

624
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,300
Your job certainly sounds
more exciting than mine.

625
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,132
Well, be my guest.

626
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,400
Today, our brilliant general
manager wants me to let

627
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:56,169
all the wetbacks know they
can have time off to go vote.

628
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,046
After you.

629
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,240
See you around.

630
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,272
Sure.

631
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:16,856
Mm...

632
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:17,920
Anybody see you?

633
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:18,952
No.

634
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,045
What are you fellas looking for?

635
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,913
We just wanted to get
another joint from you. Um...

636
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,553
Well, what are you...
looking for?

637
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,647
Uh...

638
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,248
Oh, that's my camera.

639
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,589
Uh...

640
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,059
Just what I said, just another joint.

641
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:50,153
No, no, no.

642
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:52,323
No, no, no, no, no.

643
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,592
- Oh, okay.
- No.

644
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,395
- No.
- Maybe we should split, man...

645
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,560
We could come back tomorr...

646
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,695
What are you looking for?

647
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,264
Um...

648
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,275
I don't...

649
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:04,674
I don't understand.

650
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,109
You don't understand

651
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,079
because you're not
listening to the words.

652
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,342
You're not listening to the words

653
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:13,147
in the question, my friend.

654
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,018
Well... if we could just
get our, uh, the joint...

655
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,682
- Okay, why, why?
- Then we could I...

656
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,917
Why?

657
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:19,925
Why...?

658
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,119
Why do you want a joint?

659
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,320
Why do I want a joint?

660
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,726
- To-to get stoned, man.
- To get stoned.

661
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:24,923
What's with all your questions?

662
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,659
- Um...
- Okay, okay, okay.

663
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,758
Now...

664
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,826
why do you want to get stoned?

665
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,599
We want to get stoned
because it feels good, man.

666
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:33,605
Because it feels good?

667
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,199
Bingo! Because it feels good.

668
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:38,039
Right.

669
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,307
You want to get stoned
because it feels good!

670
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:41,745
- Right?! Right!
- Right.

671
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:42,941
- Right.
- Wrong!

672
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,813
W-What?

673
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,716
Wh... Wr...
Why is that wrong?

674
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,482
Because it's a cop-out, man.

675
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:53,458
Okay, then can you explain to us
why, for what other reason

676
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,154
than the fact that it feels good
do we want to get stoned, man?

677
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,321
Because...

678
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,730
it's our way...

679
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,360
of getting closer...

680
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,393
to God.

681
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:13,402
And that is what you're looking for.

682
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:14,844
Except for you didn't know it...

683
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,847
Yeah.

684
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,849
Until this moment.

685
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,817
I had no idea.

686
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:20,819
Well, I knew.

687
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:22,911
Thank God for me, huh?

688
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,152
Absolutely.

689
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:29,992
So, if we could
just get the joint and...

690
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:34,828
Are you fellas familiar with
lysergic acid diethylamide?

691
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,639
Hey.

692
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:49,875
William.

693
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:50,904
I couldn't sleep last night

694
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,542
and I had to get out of the house.

695
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,416
My folks are driving me nuts.

696
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,784
You gonna invite me in?

697
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,981
Of course.

698
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,655
That dress looks great on you.

699
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,355
You know it's bad luck.

700
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,623
What is?

701
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,927
Well, for the groom to see
the bride in her dress

702
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:07,933
before the wedding.

703
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,958
Oh. Is that better?

704
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,697
You silly.

705
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,939
Any chance of getting this in earlier?

706
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,967
9:00.

707
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,535
Seems late for a wedding.

708
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,012
Chapel sure is busy for a Tuesday.

709
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,843
It's summertime... June brides.

710
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:29,150
You didn't have to get me
this room, by the way.

711
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,953
My brother...

712
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:36,689
my family really appreciates
what you're doing, Diane.

713
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:39,698
It means a lot to all of us.

714
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,222
To me.

715
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,001
You know, I always thought
my wedding would be

716
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:51,508
the most exciting day of my life.

717
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:55,502
Every little girl's fantasy.

718
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:59,176
A white dress, cake taller than me,

719
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:01,311
hundreds of guests.

720
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:09,188
It's just a certificate, Diane.

721
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,560
You can still have all of that.

722
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,290
Yeah.

723
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,964
If marrying you tonight
keeps you from going to Vietnam,

724
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:21,164
then it's worth it.

725
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,676
Yeah.

726
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,555
Chef's Special, Edward?

727
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,422
Miguel, you know if I could, I would.

728
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,360
Bullshit, man.

729
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,226
I see you serving the brothers
the good stuff.

730
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,494
White folks, too.

731
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,467
You don't see them
eating this dog food.

732
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,729
Lord, today.

733
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,236
Do we have to do this
every day, Miguel?

734
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,762
Every day you keep putting
the brown man down, Edward.

735
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,536
Keeping the brown man down.

736
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,167
I'm putting the brown man down.

737
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,303
That's right.
Let's keep the brown man down.

738
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,906
Let's send the brown man
back across the border

739
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,540
to his sweet senoritas
and his refried beans.

740
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,074
First of all, we didn't
cross the border.

741
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,450
The border crossed us.

742
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,954
And our senoritas are better than

743
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,753
your fried-chicken-eating mama
with the big backyard.

744
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,460
Hey, you smell that?

745
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,124
Look at that... my very own

746
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,657
special berry cobbler,
fresh out of the oven.

747
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,136
But since you had to put
my mama in it, excuse me.

748
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,298
Here you go, Jose, enjoy.

749
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:31,965
Come on, man.

750
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:32,975
"Come on, man."

751
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,172
You Mexican boys
can't play the dozens.

752
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,807
I don't know why you keep on, Miguel.

753
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,511
Yeah, man.

754
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,644
Man, what do you know
about the dozens?

755
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:45,145
I know that I got some
cobbler and you don't.

756
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,886
You're a sellout, man.

757
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,291
- You know.
- Hey.

758
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,727
It's good, ain't it, Jose?

759
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:51,991
Mm-hmm.

760
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,522
That recipe was handed down
by my great-grandmother.

761
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,794
Mm...

762
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,859
Hey, let me have some of that.
Come on, brother.

763
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,838
We ain't brothers, amigo.

764
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,374
And we ain't amigos,
"bruh-thuh."

765
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:08,538
Go ahead.

766
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,174
- You, um...
- Mm...

767
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,946
You working a double shift
like the rest of us?

768
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,613
I most certainly am not.

769
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:17,952
You must be the only one.

770
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,957
Yeah, and you know why.

771
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:19,956
Why?

772
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,287
Too good-looking for that mess.

773
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:23,961
You ain't working a double

774
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,963
'cause whitey's afraid
of your black ass, man.

775
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,156
They're afraid you're gonna go

776
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,634
all Huey Newton on them, all violent.

777
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,762
See, they ain't afraid
of us yet, Jose.

778
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:35,239
Not yet, man, but one day,
one day they will be, man.

779
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,969
We're gonna get the respect
that we deserve.

780
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,168
We're gonna take back California,

781
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,871
take back our land, man.

782
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,847
I want you to park that anger
in my kitchen, young man.

783
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,247
I want you to get your hand
off my shoulder, Negro.

784
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:53,821
All right, keep it up.

785
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:58,819
See, the first few times,
I tried to make this dessert,

786
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:02,391
couldn't get it right.

787
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,870
Too much sugar one time,
not enough sugar the next time,

788
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,395
couldn't find the balance.

789
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,410
I realized I was forcing it.

790
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,775
You know, trying to make it taste

791
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,780
like my mama's or her mama's.

792
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,578
Mine didn't have any poetry,
didn't have any light.

793
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:23,054
And then I realized
I was trying to force it

794
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,147
to taste like my mother's,
taste like her mother's.

795
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,384
Mm-hmm.

796
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,586
See, it had to be Edward's creation.

797
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,060
Mm-hmm.

798
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:32,427
It had to come from me.

799
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:37,265
Now, you, Miguel,
you've got... shit to offer.

800
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,930
You've got no poetry.
You've got no light.

801
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,736
You've got no one
looking at you and saying,

802
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,298
"Damn.

803
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,573
"Look at that Miguel.

804
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:50,070
I want some of what he's got."

805
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:52,879
All you got is your anger.

806
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,386
I ain't angry.

807
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,388
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

808
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,219
- Come on. Speak up...
- I said I'm not angry!

809
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,755
All right.

810
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,422
You know, I used to be just like you.

811
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,955
I had anger.

812
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,197
And then, after Dr. King
was killed...

813
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:20,672
well, anger like you
can't even imagine.

814
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:23,704
White folks ain't trying
to keep you down, Miguel.

815
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:26,741
White folks just don't like
to be pushed into a corner.

816
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:30,186
They'll come around.

817
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:32,713
You just got to make it
look like it was their idea,

818
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,453
like they're the ones
that thought of it.

819
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:38,259
They need to feel like
they're the great emancipators.

820
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:43,166
Like it was theirs to give
in the first place.

821
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,170
Let 'em have it.

822
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:49,140
I mean, if that's all it takes,
let them have it.

823
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:52,075
Can you dig it?

824
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:56,706
I know my man Jose
can dig it, can't you?

825
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,272
Yeah.

826
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,614
Hmm.

827
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,915
Edward.

828
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,854
Is that your famous cobbler
I'm smelling down in my office?

829
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,118
Yes, sir, Mr. Timmons.

830
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,625
I just pulled a fresh batch
out of the oven.

831
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,921
I'll make sure some gets
to your office

832
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:11,429
directly, sir.

833
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:17,200
"I'll get some sent
to your office directly, sir."

834
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,632
Step-and-fetch-it motherfucker.

835
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,937
Hey.

836
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:27,467
I'm not working a double shift
today, though, am I... amigo?

837
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:35,953
LSD was first discovered in 1938.

838
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,786
She can be beautiful.

839
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,520
She can be terrifying.

840
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:48,157
The difference between
a good trip and a bad trip

841
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,431
is completely contingent upon
your willingness to let go.

842
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,866
Turn yourself over to her completely.

843
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,342
Are you ready to have

844
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,715
a personal relationship with God?

845
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,214
Very well. Open.

846
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,848
Under the tongue.

847
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,032
You figure out what to do
with those Dodger tickets?

848
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,009
I know a few guys
might like to buy them.

849
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,636
I'm not selling them, Miguel.

850
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,772
How many times I got to tell you that?

851
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:10,907
Hey, what's the face value?

852
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,543
I don't know...
$4.50 apiece.

853
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,918
$4.50? I can get you
ten bucks easy.

854
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,252
I'm not selling them.

855
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,724
I want this whole place
filled with balloons.

856
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,590
I want people having to fight
their way through the balloons

857
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:23,889
just to get in here.

858
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,489
Balloons don't translate
into more votes, Wade.

859
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,930
But they look better on TV.

860
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,524
McCarthy's not going to want to give

861
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:31,297
a concession speech after
the big win in Oregon.

862
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,462
They're gonna turn those cameras on

863
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,335
before the polls close,
so we got to look

864
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,601
like we got the thing already won.

865
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,766
It sends a stronger message.

866
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,776
Why are we still standing here?
Let's go!

867
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,370
Dwayne, we need you
upstairs right away.

868
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:45,541
Socialist.

869
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:46,608
What's that?

870
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:47,777
You said I write

871
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,582
for a Communist paper
in a Communist country.

872
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,111
It's a Socialist paper

873
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:52,316
in a Socialist country.

874
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,824
Red is red, Miss Janacek.

875
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,121
The reforms in my country

876
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,254
are working to put a human face
on Socialism.

877
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:02,391
See the room we're
standing in right now?

878
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,334
In a few hours,
it's going to be filled

879
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,927
with hundreds of people who are here

880
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,132
either to celebrate a victory
or lament a defeat

881
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,697
because of something
that we have in America

882
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,140
called the democratic process.

883
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,576
Now, if you can tell me
the last time that happened

884
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:15,375
in your country, I'll give
you your five minutes

885
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:16,540
with the senator.

886
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,819
Damn right I'm threatening you!

887
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,514
We're not just talking
about a few stolen

888
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,817
voting machines this time!

889
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:27,984
Do we understand each other?!

890
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,128
Damn it.

891
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:34,530
What is it?

892
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,466
There's a police checkpoint

893
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,834
outside of a polling place in Watts.

894
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:43,068
The system's not working
for us... again.

895
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,252
I was watching
the local news yesterday...

896
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,891
and what-what I saw happen
on that motorcade

897
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,425
just gave me hope.

898
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,566
I mean, it's Negroes and Mexicans

899
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:19,168
by the tens of thousands just
leaping in front of his car,

900
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:22,874
tearing at his clothes,
ripping at his shoes.

901
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,848
They loved him.

902
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:35,492
Now that Dr. King is gone...
no one left but Bobby.

903
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,199
No one.

904
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,129
<i>And how did it seem to you</i>

905
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,899
<i>when the senator came
through Prestonsburg?</i>

906
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,202
<i>Oh, it, uh, it's one</i>

907
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,937
of the greatest days
we've ever had in this town...

908
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,411
especially the young people.

909
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:55,936
They're all crazy about him.

910
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:59,144
<i>Do you feel any
differently after seeing him?</i>

911
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:03,314
<i>I feel a little prouder
being an American.</i>

912
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,913
<i>Did you get to see the senator?.</i>

913
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,287
<i>Yes, sir, I did.</i>

914
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,586
How did you feel about it?

915
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,753
Whew. I was very pleased.

916
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,092
I'd just loved to have got
to laid my hand on him.

917
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,961
<i>Senator, you've just about completed</i>

918
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:14,964
<i>the second day now.</i>

919
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:15,965
<i>Is there anything significant</i>

920
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,159
<i>that you've learned on this trip?</i>

921
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,966
Well, people, uh, are still having

922
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:22,269
a very, very difficult time.

923
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:25,674
There is hunger, considerable hunger

924
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,972
in this part of the country.

925
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,239
There's no real hope for the future

926
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:32,409
amongst many of these people
who, uh, worked hard

927
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:36,352
in the coal mines, and now
that the coal mines shut down,

928
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,686
uh, they have no place to go.

929
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,122
<i>There's no hope for the future.</i>

930
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,557
<i>There's no industry moving in.</i>

931
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:43,720
<i>The men are trained
in government programs</i>

932
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,992
<i>and there's no jobs at the end
of the training program</i>

933
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,361
<i>because of the cutback,</i>

934
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,765
<i>because of the demands
on our federal budget</i>

935
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,962
<i>in Washington and the war
in Vietnam there...</i>

936
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,994
<i>even these training programs
are being cut back,</i>

937
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:57,336
<i>and so people are being cut off
and they have no place to turn,</i>

938
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,003
<i>and so they're, uh, desperate and...</i>

939
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,841
<i>and filled with despair.</i>

940
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,178
<i>It seems to me that, uh, this country,</i>

941
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:07,946
as wealthy as we are, that
this is an intolerable condition

942
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:09,645
that reflects on all of us.

943
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,952
<i>We can do things
all over the rest of the world,</i>

944
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:13,888
<i>but I think we should do
something for our people here</i>

945
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,415
<i>in our own country.</i>

946
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:27,129
It's over.

947
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,663
You okay?

948
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:33,171
You want to talk about it?

949
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,974
Not really.

950
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,570
Sometimes it helps.

951
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,742
Not right now, not this time.

952
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,252
Good afternoon.
Ambassador Hotel.

953
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,084
How may I direct your call?

954
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,453
Connecting to his room, sir.

955
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,889
Have a nice day.

956
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:48,392
Good afternoon.
Ambassador Hotel.

957
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,087
How may I direct your call?

958
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,527
Please hold.

959
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,869
Come on, girl.
Come on.

960
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,213
It's our summer clearance sale.

961
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,656
Everything must go!
Everything!

962
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:24,628
That shit, this shit for...
this shit, for sure.

963
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:35,439
Hey, man, it's okay.

964
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:36,735
I want you to look at me.

965
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:37,867
I am.

966
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:38,898
Through my eyes.

967
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,911
No.

968
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:52,447
This is painful.

969
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,390
Shut up.

970
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,451
You shut up.

971
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:59,861
No, you shut up.

972
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,866
See, it comes and it goes.

973
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,924
I can't see.

974
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,023
Okay.

975
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,937
Okay.

976
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,773
What were you saying?

977
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,480
Hi.

978
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:35,925
Hi.

979
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,797
I realized I hadn't prayed
in a long time.

980
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:46,895
Thought it might be
a good idea, you know?

981
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:50,567
Well, what are we praying for?

982
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:54,100
I suppose, whatever you like:

983
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:59,742
World peace, sick grandparent,
better job.

984
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:04,517
Do you really believe that
our prayers get answered?

985
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:06,080
Some do.

986
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:09,924
I prayed for my brother to come
back from Vietnam in one piece,

987
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:11,895
and he did.

988
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,660
I guess when a prayer is answered,

989
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:17,930
it's called a miracle.

990
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:21,301
Well, in that case, I'm going to pray

991
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,102
that my mother and father
show up tonight.

992
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,167
Now, that would be a miracle.

993
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:28,406
Mm-hmm.

994
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:42,290
I remember you saying something

995
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:43,726
something about a friendly game, John.

996
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:47,253
Yeah, well, I think that, uh,
chess is a little bit like life.

997
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:48,925
It scares people, intimidates them,

998
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,264
and that's why they invented checkers.

999
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,495
Hm.

1000
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:52,628
You're still in check.

1001
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,570
Story of my life.

1002
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:59,265
What exactly is that story, sir?

1003
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,108
Well, it's not what you read
in the gossip mags,

1004
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:03,340
that's for sure.

1005
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,906
Mm. Well,
I'm glad of that, then.

1006
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,110
I mean, we have our moments,

1007
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:11,679
like any married couple,
but, you know...

1008
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,588
Mm-hmm.

1009
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,923
But you stay, huh?

1010
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,552
Real men stay.

1011
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:22,464
They-they fight the good fight.
They don't leave.

1012
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,732
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1013
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:27,795
Your wife?

1014
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,238
Oh, she's gone.

1015
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:31,640
She died last year.

1016
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,143
Any regrets?

1017
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:36,806
Well, I suppose I could've
spent more time with my kids.

1018
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:38,941
I've got three of them
and eight grandchildren,

1019
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,449
and, um...

1020
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:43,181
I suppose I missed out quite a bit,

1021
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:44,950
being here all the time, working here,

1022
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,422
I mean.

1023
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,721
You know, it has to be said,

1024
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,318
in those days, your job was your life

1025
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:52,352
because your-your life
depended on it.

1026
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:53,955
I remember my wife said to me once,

1027
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:56,262
she said, "You know, John,
I think you-you love that hotel

1028
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:57,359
more than you love me."

1029
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:59,165
Perhaps she was right.

1030
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:00,397
And you're still in check.

1031
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:11,582
Oh, hi.

1032
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,381
-I think, after five years,

1033
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:19,583
the entire staff knows
we're married, Paul.

1034
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,489
-I guess.

1035
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:24,051
So it would probably be safe
to steal a little kiss

1036
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,926
now and then.

1037
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:28,762
And you have to eat lunch
more than once every two weeks.

1038
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,529
Salad?

1039
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:31,694
Is that all I get?

1040
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,135
Yes.

1041
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:34,934
Well, you had a heck of a morning.

1042
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:36,463
Which you slept through.

1043
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:40,443
Hey! My name tag
does not say "manager" on it.

1044
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,742
Hey, I'll switch with you.

1045
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,476
I'll be the stylist of the stars.

1046
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:46,710
Oh!

1047
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,652
And you can start
with Virginia Fallon.

1048
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:52,520
-Okay.

1049
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:56,220
-So sad...

1050
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,852
-That woman.

1051
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,161
-Tonight's her last show.

1052
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,964
She's not booked here
at the Grove until next fall.

1053
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:07,264
Can we go on vacation that week?

1054
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:09,170
Hey, did you vote?

1055
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,370
I tried, but the line was too long.

1056
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,106
I've got some, um...

1057
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:18,081
it's "yes" on Proposition 1.

1058
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,344
That's the Veterans' Bond Act.

1059
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:20,646
"No" on 2.

1060
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,585
Mills for supervisor, not Hahn.

1061
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,417
Cranston, Sheinbaum.

1062
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,923
Of course Bobby.

1063
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,791
Also, on the, um...

1064
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,192
What?

1065
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:35,358
What? What is it?

1066
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,528
Your hair, your suit...

1067
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,003
you know, it might say 1968,

1068
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:44,336
but your attitude is pure 1920.

1069
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:49,709
Well, look,
if they don't close the deal

1070
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:52,011
by the end of the day,
then we're out...

1071
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,142
Uh, he just came in.

1072
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:55,880
Aw, you're the best.

1073
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,353
Thank you.

1074
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,413
Good afternoon, Mr. Fallon.

1075
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:00,788
Afternoon, Mario.

1076
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:01,951
Tim, did you know

1077
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:04,154
that Mario's family's from Portofino?

1078
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,823
We spent two weeks there last summer.

1079
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,422
Tim simply adores it.

1080
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:09,455
He adores...

1081
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,127
I had to drag him off the beaches

1082
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,103
to go to work.

1083
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,968
Can I get you anything
else, Mrs. Fallon?

1084
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,939
No, we're fine, Mario.
Thank you.

1085
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:18,236
Oh, Tim, can you give Mario...?

1086
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,176
Very well.
Have a nice night

1087
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,202
and a wonderful show,
Mrs. Fallon.

1088
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,237
Thank you, Mario.

1089
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:25,476
Hello, Tim.

1090
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:26,778
Phil.

1091
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:28,649
Virginia woke up, couldn't find you.

1092
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:30,381
We were nervous.

1093
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,752
We were, huh?

1094
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,916
Phil has lots to tell you
about Vegas next month, baby.

1095
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:34,982
- That's right.
- Oh, yeah?

1096
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:37,527
Has it changed since
the last time we were there?

1097
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:38,893
Lots of hotels and casinos

1098
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,989
in the middle of the desert,
as I remember it.

1099
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,327
What, they get rid of gambling?

1100
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,993
We booked the Flamingo, Tim.

1101
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:46,333
Four weeks in July!

1102
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:50,170
I booked the Flamingo.

1103
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,177
Guys, four weeks in Vegas
in the middle of summer?

1104
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,372
That's not a booking.
That's a sentence, Phil.

1105
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:56,641
Tim, come on.

1106
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,012
No, no, no, you come on.

1107
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:00,710
Who the hell wants to spend
four weeks in Vegas in July?

1108
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,048
I'll tell you who: nobody.

1109
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,953
What happened to that picture
that you promised us?

1110
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:06,319
Things are slow at the studios, Tim.

1111
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,756
The Vegas deal is a good deal.

1112
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,953
Good for who?

1113
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:11,892
Tim, give it a rest.

1114
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:15,365
It's not like you have to perform.

1115
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:21,532
What the hell is this, Virginia?

1116
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:24,666
Well, from the looks of it,

1117
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:29,305
a very fine single malt Scotch, Tim.

1118
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:32,976
Thought we had an agreement.

1119
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:36,077
I haven't had a drink all day.

1120
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,087
You've been sleeping all day.

1121
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:38,315
Tim, there is a time and a place...

1122
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:39,687
Hey, you know,
believe it or not, Virginia,

1123
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:41,817
people do eat food
every now and again.

1124
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:46,660
Take your fucking judgment
and check it at the door.

1125
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:49,165
I don't need you to babysit.

1126
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,724
You don't want to go to Vegas?

1127
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:51,894
It's too hot?

1128
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:53,528
Well, then, get out.

1129
00:52:57,074 --> 00:53:01,875
I'm the reason we have all this,
not you.

1130
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:04,746
- Nobody's saying that you...
- Phil, shut the fuck up!

1131
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:12,145
People come to see me.

1132
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:16,490
People love me.

1133
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,394
They love me.

1134
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:23,662
So if I want to have
one fucking drink,

1135
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:27,637
I'm going to have one fucking drink,

1136
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:32,132
because I deserve it.

1137
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:34,974
That's the new agreement, sweetheart.

1138
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:44,212
You have a 5:00
hair appointment.

1139
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:47,952
You're on stage at 9:00 sharp.

1140
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:49,755
You'll have a 45-minute break,

1141
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:53,787
then you're introducing Senator
Kennedy in the Embassy Ballroom.

1142
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,196
Try and stay sober enough

1143
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,929
to not embarrass us
in front of the next president.

1144
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,198
I've heard a rumor
that someone's trying to unload

1145
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,268
tickets for tonight's Dodgers game.

1146
00:54:26,864 --> 00:54:30,425
It's Drysdale's night.

1147
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:32,095
Tell me about it.

1148
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:33,831
Six consecutive.

1149
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:36,362
He's gonna do it tonight.

1150
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:39,740
Not since 1904... 64 years.

1151
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,736
Yeah, I know.

1152
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,319
They're yours, man.

1153
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,090
But we haven't discussed a price.

1154
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:01,394
There is no price.

1155
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:06,226
Enjoy the game.

1156
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:18,379
You could've just gone, Jose.

1157
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:23,717
And tomorrow... then what?

1158
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:27,815
I would've been out on the
street looking for another job.

1159
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:51,740
That's you.

1160
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,443
Little man...

1161
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:57,420
that's you.

1162
00:55:57,455 --> 00:55:59,286
The story of King Arthur.

1163
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:01,018
Knights of the Round Table,
Merlin the magician.

1164
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:02,116
You have heard of it, of course.

1165
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,457
Yeah.

1166
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:07,157
We read the stories in school.

1167
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:11,157
Then you know that Arthur
wasn't always a king.

1168
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:14,035
He was a young man once, like you.

1169
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:19,065
You, Jose, are a young king.

1170
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:23,547
Kind, caring, humble.

1171
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:26,744
Eager for adventure.

1172
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:31,312
And so... I thank you, humbly,

1173
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:36,884
for these tickets, my young
brother, my young king.

1174
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,395
A chivalrous act.

1175
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,796
Chivalrous act, indeed.

1176
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,533
Hey, Edward.

1177
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:56,377
Hey, save a... save a ticket
stub for me, okay?

1178
00:56:56,414 --> 00:57:00,748
You bet I will.

1179
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:02,844
Go, Dodgers.

1180
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,515
Yeah.

1181
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:08,354
Go, Dodgers.

1182
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,106
Ah...

1183
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:31,376
Nice shot.

1184
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:32,609
It's 40-love.

1185
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:33,878
All right.

1186
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:36,614
How come we only play tennis
when we come to Los Angeles?

1187
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,518
That was... that was...

1188
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:43,527
I'm s... Bring it in.
We-We gotta discuss.

1189
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:45,051
- Let's talk. Okay.
- We gotta talk.

1190
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,962
How long does this stuff last?

1191
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:48,965
I don't know, man.

1192
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:50,933
I am freakin' out right now.

1193
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,265
Me, too.

1194
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:53,770
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1195
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,396
Play-Play tennis.

1196
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,270
14-love.

1197
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:03,077
What's wrong?

1198
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,742
Good.

1199
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:20,893
What's the matter, Nelson?

1200
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:26,360
I don't know if it's because of my age

1201
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:29,634
or that I simply can't remember.

1202
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:34,406
I, uh... I keep
losing track of things...

1203
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:39,212
my keys, my cane, my socks.

1204
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,151
I don't even know in
what drawer I put my underwear.

1205
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:47,055
I got lost on the way home today.

1206
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:50,117
That's never happened to me before.

1207
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,253
No.

1208
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:55,288
Well...

1209
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:57,892
You know, perhaps it's just a phase.

1210
00:58:57,935 --> 00:58:59,960
No.

1211
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,061
This is no phase, Casey.

1212
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:06,543
It's about growing old.

1213
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:11,913
Old bones, old face, old man.

1214
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,917
I hate it.

1215
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:15,849
I hate retirement.

1216
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,649
Yeah.

1217
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:20,714
Makes me... feel useless.

1218
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:22,817
Yeah.

1219
00:59:25,496 --> 00:59:28,795
Hey, how 'bout a nice cup of tea?

1220
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:30,823
Tea?

1221
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:32,495
Yeah.

1222
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:38,800
Tea is a drink for old white folks.

1223
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:42,134
How 'bout a Scotch?

1224
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,669
Well, a Scotch.

1225
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:44,942
I don't know; could be arranged.

1226
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,880
Make it a double.

1227
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:49,385
On the rocks.

1228
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:03,951
30% of the precincts in South Dakota

1229
01:00:04,027 --> 01:00:07,190
have McCarthy and
Senator Kennedy in a dead heat.

1230
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:14,126
Large gallery,
including several FBI agents...

1231
01:00:14,171 --> 01:00:16,105
How long has it been
since you've slept?

1232
01:00:16,139 --> 01:00:17,970
How long has it been
since you've slept?

1233
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:20,671
I'm tellin' you, man,

1234
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:23,202
there better be some Cabinet
positions in this for us.

1235
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:25,942
I got dibs on Secretary of State.

1236
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,883
Hey, you can have it.

1237
01:00:27,918 --> 01:00:30,079
I want something with
a little lower profile.

1238
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,351
Like Secretary of Transportation.

1239
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,722
Sounds a little boring,

1240
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:38,785
but if that's what you want,
you can ask the man yourself.

1241
01:00:38,829 --> 01:00:41,627
Okay, I will.

1242
01:00:41,665 --> 01:00:44,930
He specifically asked to meet you.

1243
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:47,960
He wants to thank you for all
your help on the campaign.

1244
01:00:49,006 --> 01:00:51,372
You're... kidding, right?

1245
01:00:51,408 --> 01:00:54,138
He sent word with the advance team.

1246
01:00:54,177 --> 01:00:56,839
He asked to meet you.

1247
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:06,050
Yeah, you're okay.

1248
01:01:06,156 --> 01:01:08,181
Robert Kennedy and some people

1249
01:01:08,258 --> 01:01:10,317
who aren't registered this year.

1250
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,729
In ten years,
these Americans will inherit

1251
01:01:14,765 --> 01:01:17,632
the problems we don't solve today.

1252
01:01:17,668 --> 01:01:19,329
It's suggested that, in
the next several decades,

1253
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:22,167
that people are gonna start
having to wear gas masks

1254
01:01:22,205 --> 01:01:25,333
in New York City because, uh,
the air's becoming so polluted.

1255
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:30,438
750 pounds of refuse, uh,
you breathe every year.

1256
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,880
And the same thing is true,
to a lesser degree, in cities

1257
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:33,974
all across the United States.

1258
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:35,642
That will spread
to the rural areas, as well,

1259
01:01:35,686 --> 01:01:36,744
unless we stop it.

1260
01:01:36,787 --> 01:01:38,914
There are things
we can do about automobiles;

1261
01:01:38,955 --> 01:01:42,254
There are laws that we can pass
about, uh, dumping

1262
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:44,556
and, uh, throwing refuse
in lakes and streams,

1263
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:45,993
and into the air.

1264
01:01:46,063 --> 01:01:48,930
Industry must do something,
and then individual citizens.

1265
01:01:48,965 --> 01:01:50,125
And then the demand,

1266
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:52,533
the interest that all of you
might take in it.

1267
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:54,002
And I think that's
what's going to make

1268
01:01:54,037 --> 01:01:55,527
the difference in this country.

1269
01:02:04,514 --> 01:02:06,141
Mm. I look fat.

1270
01:02:06,183 --> 01:02:07,946
You're not fat, I'm fat.

1271
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:09,076
Well, I feel fat.

1272
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,610
Maybe it's your swimsuit.

1273
01:02:11,655 --> 01:02:13,555
So you do think I look fat.

1274
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,818
I didn't say that.

1275
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:15,916
You're being
passive-aggressive.

1276
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:16,948
Please don't do that.

1277
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,618
- Don't do what?
- I mean it.

1278
01:02:18,662 --> 01:02:20,960
All that headshrinker gibberish.

1279
01:02:20,997 --> 01:02:24,296
I never thought you needed to be
fixed in the first place.

1280
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:25,824
It was your idea for me to go.

1281
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:27,063
Because you were sad.

1282
01:02:27,104 --> 01:02:28,765
It's called depression, Sam.

1283
01:02:28,805 --> 01:02:30,238
Would you keep
your voice down, please.

1284
01:02:30,273 --> 01:02:32,138
It's called depression.

1285
01:02:32,175 --> 01:02:36,908
I don't understand what you
have to be depressed about.

1286
01:02:36,947 --> 01:02:39,882
What do you talk about
in there, anyway?

1287
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:42,476
Well, most of the time, my depression.

1288
01:02:44,488 --> 01:02:46,422
Is it me?

1289
01:02:46,456 --> 01:02:49,755
Samantha, sweetheart, no.

1290
01:02:49,793 --> 01:02:53,229
It's me.

1291
01:02:59,202 --> 01:03:02,694
How's your personal relationship
with God comin' along?

1292
01:03:02,739 --> 01:03:04,764
It's beautiful.

1293
01:03:04,808 --> 01:03:06,867
You?

1294
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,879
Me and the Big G
are solid, my brother.

1295
01:03:09,913 --> 01:03:11,244
We have to get more of this stuff.

1296
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:12,407
I know.

1297
01:03:12,449 --> 01:03:16,180
<i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

1298
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:19,612
<i>Planet of the Apes
on acid would be cool.</i>

1299
01:03:26,696 --> 01:03:29,324
Look...

1300
01:03:29,366 --> 01:03:33,962
I'm having trouble with...

1301
01:03:34,037 --> 01:03:36,733
I'm not sure about this.

1302
01:03:36,773 --> 01:03:40,539
About what we're doing.

1303
01:03:40,577 --> 01:03:42,374
William.

1304
01:03:42,412 --> 01:03:44,380
No, l-I can't help feeling

1305
01:03:44,414 --> 01:03:47,645
that I'm taking
something away from you.

1306
01:03:47,684 --> 01:03:50,482
Something sacred.

1307
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,718
I mean, you should only get
married once, like our parents.

1308
01:03:54,758 --> 01:03:55,952
It's not frivolous.

1309
01:03:55,992 --> 01:03:56,959
It's not disposable.

1310
01:03:56,993 --> 01:03:59,518
Look, I'm okay with this.

1311
01:03:59,563 --> 01:04:04,091
I'm okay with it
in my heart and in my head.

1312
01:04:04,134 --> 01:04:06,398
And you're not taking
anything away from me.

1313
01:04:06,436 --> 01:04:08,404
This is my choice, William.

1314
01:04:08,438 --> 01:04:10,133
Christ, Diane,
l-I created a rift

1315
01:04:10,173 --> 01:04:11,231
between you and your father.

1316
01:04:11,274 --> 01:04:13,936
My father has a problem
with you, not with me.

1317
01:04:13,977 --> 01:04:15,604
Well, that makes me feel better.

1318
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:18,136
He's a stubborn man.

1319
01:04:22,419 --> 01:04:25,855
Well, look on the bright side...

1320
01:04:25,889 --> 01:04:28,824
be getting 135 bucks a month
until the annulment.

1321
01:04:32,562 --> 01:04:35,326
What if I don't want an annulment?

1322
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:39,258
What?

1323
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:28,949
Excuse me, miss.

1324
01:05:30,754 --> 01:05:33,951
We do have 24-hour room service.

1325
01:05:38,028 --> 01:05:39,825
So where are you from?

1326
01:05:39,863 --> 01:05:41,694
Czechoslovakia.

1327
01:05:43,733 --> 01:05:45,667
That's near the Soviet Union, right?

1328
01:05:45,702 --> 01:05:47,727
Have you got a map?

1329
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:49,864
This is a kitchen, not a library.

1330
01:05:49,906 --> 01:05:53,535
Man, when was the last time
you had something to eat?

1331
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:55,703
I don't remember.

1332
01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:57,144
Slow down.

1333
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,306
You're making me nervous.

1334
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:03,319
Czechoslovakia, that's a, um...

1335
01:06:03,353 --> 01:06:04,911
Communist country, right?

1336
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:06,784
Socialist.

1337
01:06:06,823 --> 01:06:08,688
Socialist, Communist.

1338
01:06:08,725 --> 01:06:10,283
I really don't know too
much about that stuff.

1339
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:12,295
Maybe you should pick up
a newspaper sometime,

1340
01:06:12,329 --> 01:06:15,628
you wouldn't need a map
to find Czechoslovakia.

1341
01:06:15,665 --> 01:06:19,157
Well, wherever it is...

1342
01:06:19,202 --> 01:06:22,399
I don't understand why you kill
so many of your own people.

1343
01:06:22,439 --> 01:06:24,566
Really?

1344
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:27,599
So, what do you think
you are doing in Vietnam?

1345
01:06:33,016 --> 01:06:34,950
So, you want the same as last night,

1346
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:38,179
or something a little special
for the senator?

1347
01:06:38,221 --> 01:06:42,954
Ah, you know, I don't care, as
long as it stays out of my face.

1348
01:06:43,059 --> 01:06:44,287
Okay.

1349
01:06:44,327 --> 01:06:47,057
I have something in mind.

1350
01:06:49,432 --> 01:06:54,028
I suppose you're past
getting nervous for a show.

1351
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:04,208
You know, the only thing
that I get nervous about...

1352
01:07:04,247 --> 01:07:06,909
is whether anybody's
gonna show up or not.

1353
01:07:07,017 --> 01:07:08,917
You're Virginia Fallon.

1354
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:11,146
Of course they'll show.

1355
01:07:11,187 --> 01:07:14,213
Yeah, but, you know,
I'm getting older...

1356
01:07:14,257 --> 01:07:17,158
and...

1357
01:07:17,193 --> 01:07:22,187
people don't care about you
as much when you get older.

1358
01:07:22,232 --> 01:07:25,030
Look at you.
You look terrific.

1359
01:07:25,068 --> 01:07:27,059
Yeah.

1360
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:33,104
But you know how they call women

1361
01:07:33,143 --> 01:07:37,307
"tootsie" or...

1362
01:07:37,347 --> 01:07:38,974
"cupcake"?

1363
01:07:41,017 --> 01:07:43,952
Anyone ever call you "Twinkie"?

1364
01:07:44,054 --> 01:07:46,045
No.

1365
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:49,918
That's right.

1366
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:51,620
And I guarantee you

1367
01:07:51,661 --> 01:07:54,152
no one will ever call you Twinkie.

1368
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:59,294
You know why?

1369
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:02,168
Because we don't have

1370
01:08:02,205 --> 01:08:06,767
the same shelf life as a Twinkie.

1371
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:10,507
We're like melting...

1372
01:08:10,547 --> 01:08:13,573
ice cream cones.

1373
01:08:13,616 --> 01:08:15,015
You know what?

1374
01:08:15,051 --> 01:08:17,417
I was wondering, like, exactly,
I was thinking,

1375
01:08:17,454 --> 01:08:23,393
"When did I grow
that flat spot on my ass?"

1376
01:08:29,766 --> 01:08:32,257
Very nice, fellas.

1377
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:33,360
Hey, you want to sit in,
Mr. Fallon?

1378
01:08:33,403 --> 01:08:35,667
No, no, no.
I don't play anymore.

1379
01:08:35,705 --> 01:08:38,401
Come on, once a drummer...
Come play some music with us.

1380
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:41,103
- Come on up, Tim.
- Come on, man. Go with it, man.

1381
01:08:41,144 --> 01:08:44,307
- Come on. Let's hear it.
- Get up here.

1382
01:08:44,347 --> 01:08:46,144
What do the guys got up?

1383
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:48,946
I think we have, uh,
"Don't Jive Me Now."

1384
01:08:48,985 --> 01:08:50,612
I know that one.

1385
01:08:50,653 --> 01:08:52,211
All right!

1386
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:55,624
A-one, two, three, four.

1387
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,571
So you can listen to the game tonight.

1388
01:09:19,616 --> 01:09:22,608
Oh-ho...

1389
01:09:22,652 --> 01:09:24,210
Miguel.

1390
01:09:24,254 --> 01:09:26,722
Eh, just don't let Timmons
catch you with it, all right?

1391
01:09:26,756 --> 01:09:28,155
Thank you.

1392
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,522
Thank you, man.

1393
01:09:29,559 --> 01:09:31,618
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

1394
01:09:42,105 --> 01:09:46,906
You know, I never could sing.

1395
01:09:46,943 --> 01:09:50,242
- Couldn't carry a tune.
- Ah...

1396
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,908
Not even a Christmas carol.

1397
01:09:52,949 --> 01:09:54,940
That's fantastic.

1398
01:09:55,051 --> 01:09:59,283
My husband was always
trying to get me to sing.

1399
01:09:59,322 --> 01:10:01,187
Make a little joke.

1400
01:10:01,224 --> 01:10:03,055
Mm-hmm.

1401
01:10:03,092 --> 01:10:05,959
At my expense, I suppose.

1402
01:10:06,029 --> 01:10:09,624
You know, we're all whores.

1403
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,729
All of us.

1404
01:10:12,769 --> 01:10:17,103
Just some of us get paid.

1405
01:10:31,187 --> 01:10:33,280
I'm sorry.

1406
01:10:33,323 --> 01:10:34,984
It's okay.

1407
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:37,821
No, that wasn't very nice.

1408
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,851
That's fine.

1409
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:48,262
Yeah.

1410
01:10:48,304 --> 01:10:50,829
I'm a drunk.

1411
01:10:50,873 --> 01:10:53,068
I'm an awful drunk.

1412
01:10:59,382 --> 01:11:01,373
I really am.

1413
01:11:03,186 --> 01:11:06,883
And I'm an awful person sometimes.

1414
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:11,753
And you seem like a really...

1415
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:16,390
You seem like a really nice lady.

1416
01:11:16,432 --> 01:11:19,799
You know, you've been
really nice to me, too.

1417
01:11:21,137 --> 01:11:23,867
You have, you've been
really nice with me.

1418
01:11:26,009 --> 01:11:27,977
And I'm sorry.

1419
01:11:28,011 --> 01:11:30,707
You don't deserve that.

1420
01:11:32,448 --> 01:11:34,473
Hey.

1421
01:11:47,463 --> 01:11:49,488
I try to do better.

1422
01:11:49,532 --> 01:11:52,524
I do.
I try to do better, and...

1423
01:11:52,568 --> 01:11:56,698
somehow I just don't do better.

1424
01:11:56,739 --> 01:11:59,765
Tonight's a big night.
I'm introducing the senator.

1425
01:12:01,811 --> 01:12:04,041
Tim's very excited about that.

1426
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,447
That I'm introducing the senator.

1427
01:12:20,797 --> 01:12:22,594
-I can't decide.

1428
01:12:22,632 --> 01:12:24,964
Those shoes are beautiful,
sir, and they fit her well.

1429
01:12:25,068 --> 01:12:28,469
Fine. I'll take those.

1430
01:12:28,504 --> 01:12:31,769
Do you want to put 'em on first,
walk around a little bit?

1431
01:12:31,808 --> 01:12:33,605
You don't need to know how they feel?

1432
01:12:33,643 --> 01:12:36,373
It's not about how they feel,
Jack, it's about how they look.

1433
01:12:36,412 --> 01:12:38,471
And they look fabulous.

1434
01:12:40,183 --> 01:12:41,275
Okay.

1435
01:12:41,317 --> 01:12:43,512
I'll ring 'em up, sir.

1436
01:12:49,959 --> 01:12:52,519
What have we done?

1437
01:12:52,562 --> 01:12:55,156
What do you mean?

1438
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:59,726
What if Dwayne
is right and Kennedy loses?

1439
01:12:59,769 --> 01:13:01,737
We can all forget it, man.

1440
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:04,501
I'm 19, Jimmy.
I don't want to go to Vietnam.

1441
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,940
Do you?

1442
01:13:08,411 --> 01:13:09,935
No.

1443
01:13:10,012 --> 01:13:12,207
I mean, 'cause we fucked off
today, Jim.

1444
01:13:12,248 --> 01:13:13,510
You know, we fucked off.

1445
01:13:13,549 --> 01:13:15,380
We should've done
what we were supposed to do.

1446
01:13:15,418 --> 01:13:16,544
Coop, it's okay.

1447
01:13:16,586 --> 01:13:18,281
It's just two guys knocking on doors.

1448
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:20,289
No, it isn't.
McCarthy in New Hampshire

1449
01:13:20,323 --> 01:13:21,950
came within 230 votes of Johnson.

1450
01:13:22,058 --> 01:13:23,457
230 votes.

1451
01:13:23,493 --> 01:13:25,484
We could've knocked
on 230 doors today.

1452
01:13:25,528 --> 01:13:28,122
I've knocked on well over
a hundred by myself!

1453
01:13:28,164 --> 01:13:29,961
Okay. You know what,
if it makes you feel better,

1454
01:13:30,032 --> 01:13:31,966
we can go out, and the polls
will be open for...

1455
01:13:32,068 --> 01:13:33,865
It's too late now.
It's too goddamn late.

1456
01:13:33,903 --> 01:13:35,302
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1457
01:13:35,338 --> 01:13:37,704
We can't do anything
anymore. It's too late!

1458
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,765
I feel like we should personally
apologize to the man.

1459
01:13:39,809 --> 01:13:41,367
We should apologize
for not doing our part.

1460
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:42,969
What if we cost him
the election, man?!

1461
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:45,411
Calm down, man.
You're freakin' me out.

1462
01:13:46,449 --> 01:13:50,078
- He's fine.
- I'm sorry.

1463
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:52,986
I'm sorry.

1464
01:13:53,022 --> 01:13:54,546
Are you still high from the acid?

1465
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:57,821
No.

1466
01:14:00,696 --> 01:14:03,028
Maybe a little.

1467
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:05,158
We didn't order this.

1468
01:14:05,201 --> 01:14:07,032
You guys got to eat something.

1469
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:09,230
Why's that?

1470
01:14:12,308 --> 01:14:15,937
Is this the first
time you two have turned on?

1471
01:14:19,649 --> 01:14:23,813
Oh, come on, fellas,
your pupils are like saucers.

1472
01:14:26,155 --> 01:14:29,249
Wh-What do you know?
You're from Iowa.

1473
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:31,385
Ohio.

1474
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:34,760
What, you think California's
the only place people drop acid?

1475
01:14:40,937 --> 01:14:44,737
Was I that obvious?

1476
01:14:44,841 --> 01:14:46,240
Got to break her in.

1477
01:14:46,275 --> 01:14:48,266
Okay.

1478
01:14:53,983 --> 01:14:56,508
Daryl.

1479
01:14:56,552 --> 01:14:58,611
What can I do for you?

1480
01:14:58,654 --> 01:15:00,986
Kennedy says
if he doesn't win California,

1481
01:15:01,023 --> 01:15:02,923
he will drop out of the race
for president.

1482
01:15:02,959 --> 01:15:04,722
Oregon voters have given...

1483
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,125
Jack?

1484
01:15:06,162 --> 01:15:07,459
What?

1485
01:15:07,497 --> 01:15:11,331
Do you think I'm more
Jackie or more Ethel?

1486
01:15:11,367 --> 01:15:12,732
What do you mean?

1487
01:15:12,768 --> 01:15:13,928
If you had to pick one,

1488
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:15,801
who would I be more
like, style-wise:

1489
01:15:15,838 --> 01:15:17,669
Jackie Bouvier or Ethel?

1490
01:15:17,707 --> 01:15:18,799
Are you serious?

1491
01:15:18,841 --> 01:15:20,468
Play along.
And you have to pick one.

1492
01:15:23,312 --> 01:15:25,803
Samantha.

1493
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:29,442
What?

1494
01:15:29,485 --> 01:15:32,852
When do you feel like Samantha?

1495
01:15:32,889 --> 01:15:35,858
Oh, I don't know.

1496
01:15:39,328 --> 01:15:41,888
Oh, Jack, it was just a little game.

1497
01:15:41,931 --> 01:15:43,922
Come on, it was a game.

1498
01:15:46,102 --> 01:15:47,228
What?

1499
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:48,498
Can't keep track.

1500
01:15:48,538 --> 01:15:49,505
Of what?

1501
01:15:49,539 --> 01:15:50,972
I can't keep track of you.

1502
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,235
I'm right here.

1503
01:15:57,179 --> 01:15:59,170
You are now.

1504
01:16:02,051 --> 01:16:03,177
Samantha.

1505
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:07,747
You're more than the shoes
on your feet

1506
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:12,090
or the designer dress on your back.

1507
01:16:12,128 --> 01:16:15,655
You're more than the purse you carry

1508
01:16:15,698 --> 01:16:18,394
or the money inside.

1509
01:16:18,434 --> 01:16:21,870
You and I are more

1510
01:16:21,904 --> 01:16:26,671
than the stuff, more than
the things in our lives.

1511
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:30,645
Somewhere between our things
and our stuff is us.

1512
01:16:32,915 --> 01:16:35,406
I don't want to lose us.

1513
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:42,516
I don't want to lose us either.

1514
01:16:54,637 --> 01:16:57,629
Knock, knock, knock.

1515
01:16:57,673 --> 01:16:59,265
Hello.

1516
01:16:59,308 --> 01:17:02,300
So do you work here, young lady?

1517
01:17:02,345 --> 01:17:04,506
Well, somebody has to
bring home the bacon.

1518
01:17:04,547 --> 01:17:07,710
Aha! You finally admit it.

1519
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:11,117
I am underpaid and undervalued.

1520
01:17:11,153 --> 01:17:13,451
Gilliam even with the bag at third.

1521
01:17:13,489 --> 01:17:14,922
Parker doing a little housecleaning

1522
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:16,049
down there at first base.

1523
01:17:16,092 --> 01:17:17,855
And Drysdale looks in to Haller.

1524
01:17:17,893 --> 01:17:19,918
Don into his windup,
the pitch to Pena.

1525
01:17:19,996 --> 01:17:20,928
Bunt attempt is missed.

1526
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:22,156
Oh and one.

1527
01:17:23,332 --> 01:17:25,323
Shit.

1528
01:17:28,471 --> 01:17:31,406
Larry Jackson on deck.

1529
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,738
No balls and one strike,
the count to Roberto Pena.

1530
01:17:37,546 --> 01:17:38,774
Don working quickly.

1531
01:17:38,814 --> 01:17:40,281
What inning?

1532
01:17:40,316 --> 01:17:41,340
And the strike one pitch.

1533
01:17:41,384 --> 01:17:42,578
Breaking ball over the outside...

1534
01:17:42,618 --> 01:17:43,585
Bottom of the fourth.

1535
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:45,348
No hits for Pittsburgh so far.

1536
01:17:46,956 --> 01:17:49,447
It took so long
to come to this moment.

1537
01:17:49,492 --> 01:17:52,950
May 14: a rather uneventful
one-to-nothing score.

1538
01:17:52,995 --> 01:17:55,190
May 18: a one-to-nothing score.

1539
01:17:55,231 --> 01:17:58,632
May 22: people started to talk;
A two-to-nothing score.

1540
01:17:58,668 --> 01:18:01,102
May 26: they began
to think about it seriously.

1541
01:18:01,137 --> 01:18:03,867
And there's a ground ball up
along the first-base line, foul.

1542
01:18:03,906 --> 01:18:05,066
Still oh and...

1543
01:18:12,214 --> 01:18:14,682
Did you fire Daryl Timmons today?

1544
01:18:14,717 --> 01:18:17,811
Yep. He's a racist,
among other things.

1545
01:18:25,061 --> 01:18:27,928
What's she like, Paul?

1546
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:31,625
Pardon me?

1547
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:35,262
The woman that you're sleeping with.

1548
01:18:35,304 --> 01:18:36,931
What's she like?

1549
01:18:36,972 --> 01:18:39,907
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1550
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:51,242
We don't do this.

1551
01:18:54,323 --> 01:18:58,020
Other people do this, Paul,
but we don't do this.

1552
01:19:15,644 --> 01:19:18,135
You know, people tell me all the time

1553
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:22,173
how... lucky I am
to be married to you.

1554
01:19:25,421 --> 01:19:27,412
How wonderful you are.

1555
01:19:31,527 --> 01:19:34,087
And I agree.

1556
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:37,258
I say, "Yes...

1557
01:19:37,299 --> 01:19:41,099
"he's wonderful.

1558
01:19:41,137 --> 01:19:43,128
"Yes...

1559
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:49,068
I am lucky."

1560
01:19:49,111 --> 01:19:51,102
Not because I have to.

1561
01:19:56,886 --> 01:20:00,049
Because I want to.

1562
01:20:00,089 --> 01:20:03,923
'Cause you are wonderful.

1563
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:05,483
And...

1564
01:20:05,528 --> 01:20:07,052
And so much more.

1565
01:20:07,096 --> 01:20:10,259
You're...

1566
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:13,132
You're...

1567
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,165
You're strong.

1568
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:23,975
You're a wonderful
father to those kids.

1569
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:25,512
Oh, God.

1570
01:20:55,177 --> 01:20:56,235
- Oh, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa!

1571
01:20:56,278 --> 01:20:57,802
- Ebbers, you son of a bitch!
- Come on.

1572
01:20:57,847 --> 01:20:58,905
- Put 'em up!
- Calm down!

1573
01:20:58,948 --> 01:21:00,745
Stop it.

1574
01:21:00,783 --> 01:21:02,546
You don't have to wait
till the end of the week!

1575
01:21:02,585 --> 01:21:04,212
I wasn't planning on it!

1576
01:21:04,253 --> 01:21:06,551
- All right.
- All right.

1577
01:21:06,589 --> 01:21:07,954
Easy. Easy!

1578
01:21:08,023 --> 01:21:08,955
Calm down.

1579
01:21:12,962 --> 01:21:16,398
All right, back to work.

1580
01:21:22,338 --> 01:21:23,771
<i>I wish I could stay.</i>

1581
01:21:23,806 --> 01:21:27,173
No, you cherish the fact
there's still someone at home

1582
01:21:27,209 --> 01:21:30,542
who worries about you
and, uh, cares about you.

1583
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:32,604
- Cheers for the Scotch.
- Oh, good.

1584
01:21:32,648 --> 01:21:33,842
We'll do that more often.

1585
01:21:33,883 --> 01:21:34,850
Yeah.

1586
01:21:34,884 --> 01:21:36,715
Makes me feel like
I still have a pair.

1587
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:39,517
Of course, our game is another matter.

1588
01:21:39,555 --> 01:21:42,388
Yeah, well, you know,
perhaps tomorrow will be

1589
01:21:42,424 --> 01:21:44,585
more forgiving.

1590
01:21:44,627 --> 01:21:46,561
You've always...

1591
01:21:46,595 --> 01:21:48,495
always beat me at chess, John,

1592
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:49,997
- Yeah.
- And you always will.

1593
01:21:50,065 --> 01:21:51,396
That's why you play me.

1594
01:21:51,433 --> 01:21:52,400
Perhaps you're right.

1595
01:21:52,434 --> 01:21:55,870
And tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow.

1596
01:21:55,905 --> 01:21:56,872
Good night.

1597
01:21:56,906 --> 01:21:57,873
Sleep well.

1598
01:21:57,907 --> 01:21:58,999
Say hello to Dorothy.

1599
01:21:59,074 --> 01:22:00,200
Yes, I will.

1600
01:22:00,242 --> 01:22:01,573
Good night.

1601
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:02,941
Evening, Mr. Casey.

1602
01:22:03,045 --> 01:22:05,809
Hey, Morris, how 'bout a coffee
and a bite to eat in the cafe?

1603
01:22:05,848 --> 01:22:07,713
Ah, I've-I've got
cats to feed.

1604
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,217
Don't you have a home to go to, John?

1605
01:22:10,419 --> 01:22:11,716
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

1606
01:22:20,029 --> 01:22:21,690
- He stepped out.
- Get a picture right there.

1607
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,823
- I got it. I got it.
- He's there?

1608
01:22:23,866 --> 01:22:25,959
- Senator Kennedy?
- Senator! Senator!

1609
01:22:26,001 --> 01:22:28,231
- Senator Kennedy, this way.
- Please, stand back.

1610
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:30,761
- Oh, that's him!
- Hello, sir.

1611
01:22:30,806 --> 01:22:31,830
Nice to meet you.

1612
01:22:37,446 --> 01:22:38,879
Senator Kennedy.

1613
01:22:38,914 --> 01:22:40,347
Welcome to the Ambassador Hotel, sir.

1614
01:22:40,382 --> 01:22:41,815
Thank you very much.

1615
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:44,080
- Senator, this way!
- Please, right this way, sir!

1616
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:46,110
Follow us, sir.

1617
01:22:46,155 --> 01:22:48,123
Right this way.

1618
01:22:50,292 --> 01:22:53,090
- Sir...
- Senator, this way.

1619
01:22:53,128 --> 01:22:55,995
This is a CBS News special report

1620
01:22:56,065 --> 01:22:57,896
on the California primary.

1621
01:22:57,933 --> 01:22:59,491
Here is Walter Cronkite.

1622
01:22:59,535 --> 01:23:00,968
Well, as we said a moment ago,

1623
01:23:01,003 --> 01:23:03,801
the count may be rather slow
from California tonight.

1624
01:23:03,839 --> 01:23:06,501
The voting out there
offers unusual complexities,

1625
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:08,510
not only in the manner
of counting this year

1626
01:23:08,544 --> 01:23:12,071
for the first time, but in
the very process of balloting.

1627
01:23:12,114 --> 01:23:14,947
CBS News correspondent Mike
Wallace, at our studios here,

1628
01:23:15,017 --> 01:23:17,417
can perhaps give us
a little explanation

1629
01:23:17,453 --> 01:23:19,785
of that voting and the way
it's being tallied. Mike?

1630
01:23:19,822 --> 01:23:21,756
The actual, uh,
vote tabulation, Walter,

1631
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:24,156
is going to be extremely slow,
tonight, in California.

1632
01:23:24,193 --> 01:23:25,683
A large part of the state,

1633
01:23:25,728 --> 01:23:28,959
including the 7,000 precincts
in Los Angeles County

1634
01:23:28,998 --> 01:23:31,466
are using new automated
voting equipment,

1635
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,263
where the ballots
are counted by computers.

1636
01:23:33,302 --> 01:23:34,860
Now, although on the face of it,

1637
01:23:34,903 --> 01:23:36,962
that would seem to indicate
a faster count,

1638
01:23:37,006 --> 01:23:39,941
the fact is that the new voting
system is going to be slower

1639
01:23:39,975 --> 01:23:41,067
in the count.

1640
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:44,546
Hello, David.

1641
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:45,569
Hey, Wade.

1642
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:49,983
So, Dwayne...

1643
01:23:50,085 --> 01:23:52,178
you ready to meet the next
President of the United States?

1644
01:23:54,089 --> 01:23:57,149
Come on, he's not gonna bite ya.

1645
01:23:57,192 --> 01:23:59,285
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1646
01:24:02,464 --> 01:24:04,591
Okay.

1647
01:24:04,633 --> 01:24:06,100
Go get him.
You'll be fine.

1648
01:24:06,135 --> 01:24:08,228
Sample of 89 precincts,

1649
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,737
which, together, represent closely

1650
01:24:09,772 --> 01:24:11,603
to where the state votes and polls.

1651
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,302
As soon as returns are
available from those 89...

1652
01:24:14,343 --> 01:24:16,174
Ladies and gentlemen,

1653
01:24:16,211 --> 01:24:17,405
the Coconut Grove

1654
01:24:17,446 --> 01:24:19,607
proudly presents the lovely,

1655
01:24:19,648 --> 01:24:23,550
the talented, the incomparable
Virginia Fallon.

1656
01:24:36,098 --> 01:24:38,862
Thank you. Thank you.

1657
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:50,601
Oh, yeah.

1658
01:27:02,477 --> 01:27:04,308
Swung on, a ground ball wide of third.

1659
01:27:04,346 --> 01:27:05,745
It's Blair, has the chance.

1660
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:08,272
-He's done it!

1661
01:27:44,419 --> 01:27:47,354
Spring, 1946.

1662
01:27:47,389 --> 01:27:49,050
The last free election in my country.

1663
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:50,956
And yet the Communists
still took power.

1664
01:27:50,993 --> 01:27:53,393
That's not what
you asked, Mr. Buckley!

1665
01:27:53,428 --> 01:27:55,123
The Iron Curtain is coming down.

1666
01:27:55,163 --> 01:27:57,631
Dubcek favors greater relations
with the West.

1667
01:27:57,666 --> 01:27:59,861
He's the man of the people,
like Senator Kennedy.

1668
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:02,392
I am not going to write
a propaganda piece.

1669
01:28:07,876 --> 01:28:10,470
After the senator's speech
in the Embassy Ballroom,

1670
01:28:10,512 --> 01:28:12,605
there will be a private press
conference in the Colonial Room.

1671
01:28:12,648 --> 01:28:14,741
I will see to it that you
have the proper credentials.

1672
01:28:16,184 --> 01:28:17,811
You have your five
minutes, Miss Janacek.

1673
01:28:17,853 --> 01:28:19,445
Thank you.

1674
01:28:20,589 --> 01:28:22,682
Thank you, Mr. Buckley!
Thank you so much!

1675
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:27,388
Please slow down.

1676
01:28:27,429 --> 01:28:30,421
I can barely walk
in these silly shoes.

1677
01:28:30,465 --> 01:28:32,956
But they look fabulous.

1678
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:44,677
I don't know your birthday.

1679
01:28:44,713 --> 01:28:46,840
August 3.

1680
01:28:48,517 --> 01:28:51,247
I don't know a lot about you, Diane.

1681
01:28:51,286 --> 01:28:54,687
Your favorite food,
your favorite color.

1682
01:28:54,723 --> 01:28:57,624
I don't know
your favorite book or movie.

1683
01:28:57,659 --> 01:29:00,184
I don't even know if your belly button

1684
01:29:00,228 --> 01:29:02,059
is an innie or an outie.

1685
01:29:02,097 --> 01:29:04,895
An innie.

1686
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:07,628
But I'm surprised
you didn't know that.

1687
01:29:13,575 --> 01:29:15,202
<i>-Whew!
- Apurate! Apurate!</i>

1688
01:29:15,243 --> 01:29:17,234
<i>-Man!
- Chingale, man, you think</i>

1689
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:19,474
they could use the same
glasses more than once?

1690
01:29:19,514 --> 01:29:20,913
It is packed in there.

1691
01:29:21,016 --> 01:29:22,916
There's got to be over
a thousand people.

1692
01:29:23,018 --> 01:29:24,110
<i>Rapido, rapido!</i>

1693
01:29:26,188 --> 01:29:28,679
Gentlemen.
How was it out there?

1694
01:29:28,724 --> 01:29:30,055
It was fantastic.

1695
01:29:30,092 --> 01:29:32,458
Yeah, we dropped acid
and went to the movies.

1696
01:29:32,494 --> 01:29:34,257
<i>Planet of the Apes on acid?</i>

1697
01:29:34,296 --> 01:29:36,526
You got to try it, it's...

1698
01:29:42,637 --> 01:29:45,731
Tidings of great joy.

1699
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:50,374
Test one, two. Test one, two.

1700
01:29:51,847 --> 01:29:54,941
Ladies and gentlemen, could
I have your attention, please?

1701
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:57,746
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention?

1702
01:29:57,786 --> 01:30:00,482
We have an announcement
that we would like to make.

1703
01:30:00,522 --> 01:30:04,515
With 16% of precincts now reporting...

1704
01:30:04,559 --> 01:30:07,960
Why don't you go ahead and read this?

1705
01:30:07,996 --> 01:30:09,623
Future Secretary of Transportation,

1706
01:30:09,664 --> 01:30:12,292
Dwayne Clark, ladies and gentlemen.

1707
01:30:16,638 --> 01:30:20,631
With over 16% of the precincts
now reporting...

1708
01:30:20,675 --> 01:30:22,302
I recognize his voice.

1709
01:30:22,344 --> 01:30:23,572
He's cute.

1710
01:30:23,612 --> 01:30:27,844
Hey... my love life is the one
that needs some attention.

1711
01:30:27,883 --> 01:30:29,180
Of the United States,

1712
01:30:29,217 --> 01:30:31,481
Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

1713
01:30:35,557 --> 01:30:37,684
You look wonderful.

1714
01:30:37,726 --> 01:30:39,626
Thank you.

1715
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:42,095
Let's see 'em.

1716
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:44,724
- Good girl.
- Thanks.

1717
01:30:44,766 --> 01:30:47,667
This must be the...
the lucky man.

1718
01:30:47,702 --> 01:30:51,263
Miriam, meet my husband, William.

1719
01:30:51,306 --> 01:30:53,365
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1720
01:30:53,408 --> 01:30:55,569
Sorry. Excuse me.

1721
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:57,373
Excuse me.

1722
01:30:57,412 --> 01:30:59,710
Excuse me...

1723
01:30:59,748 --> 01:31:01,716
Excuse me.

1724
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:04,344
Aren't you a little young to be
Secretary of Transportation?

1725
01:31:04,386 --> 01:31:07,355
I'm gonna strangle him.

1726
01:31:07,389 --> 01:31:09,482
I recognize your voice.

1727
01:31:11,026 --> 01:31:13,119
Really.
Do you work for the FBI?

1728
01:31:13,161 --> 01:31:14,685
You're the young brother

1729
01:31:14,729 --> 01:31:19,189
from 506 that's always
yelling and always angry.

1730
01:31:19,234 --> 01:31:20,895
I'd recognize it anywhere.

1731
01:31:20,936 --> 01:31:23,803
So you do work for the FBI.

1732
01:31:23,839 --> 01:31:26,433
I'm a switchboard operator
for the hotel.

1733
01:31:26,475 --> 01:31:28,409
Patricia.

1734
01:31:28,443 --> 01:31:30,911
What's your name, angry young brother?

1735
01:31:30,946 --> 01:31:32,743
Dwayne.

1736
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:34,646
I'm not always angry.

1737
01:31:34,683 --> 01:31:36,981
I need another box.

1738
01:31:37,085 --> 01:31:38,643
Jose, come on with the box.

1739
01:31:38,687 --> 01:31:39,779
I'm-I'm coming.

1740
01:31:39,821 --> 01:31:41,379
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm coming.

1741
01:31:41,423 --> 01:31:42,981
How in the hell
are we supposed to work

1742
01:31:43,091 --> 01:31:44,251
with all these people here?

1743
01:31:44,292 --> 01:31:45,691
I don't know, but I ain't never seen

1744
01:31:45,727 --> 01:31:47,217
so many white people
in the kitchen before.

1745
01:31:48,263 --> 01:31:49,992
- Hey, Susan.
- Hey.

1746
01:31:50,031 --> 01:31:51,726
How are my little drug addicts?

1747
01:31:51,766 --> 01:31:54,826
I don't think I have ever
seen you out of your uniform.

1748
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:57,202
But we've both fantasized
about it before.

1749
01:31:57,239 --> 01:31:59,707
He's still high.

1750
01:31:59,741 --> 01:32:00,799
- He's still high.
- No, I'm not.

1751
01:32:00,842 --> 01:32:01,809
Yes, you are.

1752
01:32:01,843 --> 01:32:02,810
You're the one who's still high.

1753
01:32:02,844 --> 01:32:04,539
I'm a stockbroker.

1754
01:32:04,579 --> 01:32:05,603
I'm an artist.

1755
01:32:05,647 --> 01:32:07,410
As well as a patron of the arts.

1756
01:32:07,449 --> 01:32:09,679
She bought a painting
of a can of soup last month.

1757
01:32:09,718 --> 01:32:11,413
A can of soup.

1758
01:32:11,453 --> 01:32:13,819
Mm-hmm. I think it
was Campbell's tomato.

1759
01:32:13,855 --> 01:32:14,844
- Yes.
- No, onion.

1760
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:16,084
Tomato.

1761
01:32:16,124 --> 01:32:17,455
She says tomato, I say onion.

1762
01:32:17,492 --> 01:32:19,187
It's an original Warhol.

1763
01:32:19,227 --> 01:32:20,785
Do you know he was shot yesterday?

1764
01:32:20,829 --> 01:32:22,797
And probably by someone
who sobered up and realized

1765
01:32:22,831 --> 01:32:25,061
they paid a fortune for
a picture of a can of soup.

1766
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,829
You're terrible.

1767
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:31,302
May I ask you a personal question?

1768
01:32:31,339 --> 01:32:35,275
How personal you want to get?

1769
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:38,245
I'm not asking to embarrass you
or anything, but...

1770
01:32:40,582 --> 01:32:42,015
how much do you make a week?

1771
01:32:44,553 --> 01:32:47,681
These folks ain't interested
in eating.

1772
01:32:47,722 --> 01:32:50,782
Besides, they gonna
throw it away anyway.

1773
01:32:50,825 --> 01:32:52,793
Yeah.

1774
01:32:52,827 --> 01:32:54,317
I'm not proud, Dwayne.

1775
01:32:54,362 --> 01:32:56,887
I'm just another sister
trying to survive in the world.

1776
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:02,859
No, you're much more than that.

1777
01:33:07,509 --> 01:33:09,739
This one looks pretty good.

1778
01:33:17,052 --> 01:33:18,883
The board behind me shows

1779
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,480
the story from
the California primary tonight.

1780
01:33:21,523 --> 01:33:24,117
There's still just
a scattering of votes in,

1781
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,287
but our vote-profile
analysis of, uh,

1782
01:33:27,329 --> 01:33:30,526
key precincts through the state,
representative "key-cincts"...

1783
01:33:30,565 --> 01:33:32,533
precincts... indicate
that Senator Kennedy

1784
01:33:32,567 --> 01:33:34,967
is going to come out with a wide lead,

1785
01:33:35,003 --> 01:33:39,303
probably 52 to 38 percent
over Senator McCarthy.

1786
01:33:42,243 --> 01:33:43,972
RFK! RFK!

1787
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:47,879
RFK! RFK! RFK! RFK!

1788
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:49,440
Ladies and gentlemen...

1789
01:33:49,484 --> 01:33:51,315
RFK! RFK!

1790
01:33:53,121 --> 01:33:56,386
Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

1791
01:33:56,424 --> 01:34:03,557
RFK! RFK! RFK! RFK! RFK!

1792
01:34:03,598 --> 01:34:06,761
We want Kennedy!
We want Kennedy!

1793
01:34:06,801 --> 01:34:10,931
We want Kennedy!
We want Kennedy!

1794
01:34:10,972 --> 01:34:12,633
We want Kennedy!

1795
01:34:12,674 --> 01:34:16,542
We want Kennedy!
We want Kennedy!

1796
01:34:16,578 --> 01:34:18,773
I want to, uh, first, uh,

1797
01:34:18,813 --> 01:34:22,305
express my, uh, high regard
to, uh, Don Drysdale...

1798
01:34:27,288 --> 01:34:31,054
who pitched his, uh,
sixth straight shutout tonight.

1799
01:34:34,796 --> 01:34:37,822
And I hope that we have his
good fortune in our campaign.

1800
01:36:43,858 --> 01:36:45,951
What I think is quite clear

1801
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:49,188
is that we can work together,
in the last analysis,

1802
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:51,425
and that what has been going on
within the United States

1803
01:36:51,466 --> 01:36:53,866
over the period
of the last three years...

1804
01:36:53,902 --> 01:36:58,737
the divisions, the violence, the
disenchantment with our society,

1805
01:36:58,773 --> 01:37:00,866
the divisions, whether it's
between blacks and whites,

1806
01:37:00,909 --> 01:37:03,901
between the poor and the more
affluent or between age groups

1807
01:37:03,978 --> 01:37:07,209
or on the war in Vietnam... that
we can start to work together.

1808
01:37:07,248 --> 01:37:09,443
We are a great country,
and a selfless country,

1809
01:37:09,484 --> 01:37:11,315
and a compassionate country.

1810
01:37:11,352 --> 01:37:13,820
And I intend to make that
my basis for running,

1811
01:37:13,855 --> 01:37:15,322
then, over the period
of the next few months.

1812
01:37:21,696 --> 01:37:25,325
Bobby! Yeah!

1813
01:37:25,366 --> 01:37:28,392
So, uh, my thanks to all of you.

1814
01:37:28,436 --> 01:37:31,200
And now it's on to Chicago
and let's win there.

1815
01:37:31,239 --> 01:37:32,831
Thank you very much.

1816
01:37:32,874 --> 01:37:34,432
Whoo!

1817
01:37:39,681 --> 01:37:41,308
It's impossible to hear tonight.

1818
01:37:41,349 --> 01:37:43,943
Robert Kennedy's victory is
setting up a possible showdown

1819
01:37:44,052 --> 01:37:46,543
in the general election
with Richard Nixon,

1820
01:37:46,588 --> 01:37:49,250
who his brother defeated
eight years ago.

1821
01:37:52,694 --> 01:37:57,154
We want Bobby!
We want Bobby! We want Bobby!

1822
01:37:59,434 --> 01:38:00,958
- Bobby!
- Bobby!

1823
01:38:01,002 --> 01:38:02,299
Bobby!

1824
01:38:02,337 --> 01:38:06,296
We want Bobby.
We want Bobby. We want Bobby.

1825
01:38:06,341 --> 01:38:08,809
- Hey, Bobby!
- Bobby!

1826
01:38:08,843 --> 01:38:10,105
- Bobby! Bobby!
- Where you going?

1827
01:38:10,144 --> 01:38:11,668
I wanna shake his hand.

1828
01:38:11,713 --> 01:38:13,146
You don't wanna shake his hand?

1829
01:38:13,181 --> 01:38:15,547
Bobby!

1830
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:17,278
Senator, this way,
through the kitchen.

1831
01:38:17,318 --> 01:38:19,047
Senator, follow me.

1832
01:38:19,087 --> 01:38:20,554
No, no, wait, Senator.

1833
01:38:20,588 --> 01:38:23,056
- Bobby!
- Hey!

1834
01:38:23,091 --> 01:38:24,718
William! William!
-Hey!

1835
01:38:24,759 --> 01:38:29,321
We want Bobby.
We want Bobby. We want Bobby.

1836
01:38:29,364 --> 01:38:30,592
Please, right this way, sir.

1837
01:38:30,632 --> 01:38:31,929
Follow us, sir.

1838
01:38:31,966 --> 01:38:33,399
This way.

1839
01:38:33,434 --> 01:38:35,265
This way, through the kitchen.

1840
01:38:45,413 --> 01:38:47,381
Bobby! Bobby!

1841
01:38:47,415 --> 01:38:50,077
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

1842
01:38:50,118 --> 01:38:51,949
Bobby!

1843
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,580
Bobby! Bobby!

1844
01:39:14,142 --> 01:39:15,473
Bobby!

1845
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:17,000
- Bobby!
- Bobby!

1846
01:39:27,956 --> 01:39:30,356
Kennedy, you son of a bitch.

1847
01:39:39,867 --> 01:39:42,358
Get the gun.
Get the gun. Get the gun.

1848
01:39:42,403 --> 01:39:45,895
Stay away from the gun.

1849
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:48,238
- Stay away from the gun.
- Get a doctor!

1850
01:39:48,276 --> 01:39:51,302
Keep them out!
Keep them out!

1851
01:39:51,346 --> 01:39:53,940
His hand is frozen.

1852
01:39:54,015 --> 01:39:55,642
Take ahold of his thumb
and break it if you have to!

1853
01:39:55,683 --> 01:39:57,548
Get his thumb!

1854
01:39:57,585 --> 01:39:58,916
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1855
01:39:58,953 --> 01:40:01,421
Hold him! Hold him! Hold him!

1856
01:40:01,456 --> 01:40:02,650
Get a doctor for the senator!

1857
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:03,952
We don't want another Oswald!

1858
01:40:06,094 --> 01:40:07,527
Senator!

1859
01:40:07,562 --> 01:40:08,722
Wade! Wade! Excuse me, Wade!

1860
01:40:08,763 --> 01:40:10,856
Excuse me! Sir, move!

1861
01:40:13,601 --> 01:40:16,092
He's been shot!
-What?! What?!

1862
01:40:16,137 --> 01:40:17,263
Excuse me.

1863
01:40:17,305 --> 01:40:18,932
Wade! What happened?

1864
01:40:21,109 --> 01:40:23,839
-Someone shot him!
What?

1865
01:40:23,878 --> 01:40:25,869
Excuse me!

1866
01:40:25,913 --> 01:40:27,938
Excuse me! I'm with...

1867
01:40:27,982 --> 01:40:30,542
Ladies and gentlemen, could I
have your attention please?

1868
01:40:30,585 --> 01:40:32,883
Ladies and gentlemen, can I
ask you please to be calm?

1869
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:35,821
We need a doctor to come
to the podium right now.

1870
01:40:35,857 --> 01:40:37,484
- Please, everybody...
- Bobby's shot?

1871
01:40:37,525 --> 01:40:38,924
- Bobby's shot?
- Please, just be calm.

1872
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,155
And if you can,
please leave the ballroom.

1873
01:40:41,195 --> 01:40:44,130
We need a doctor to the podium
right now!

1874
01:40:44,165 --> 01:40:46,998
Please. Is there a doctor
in the house? We need you...

1875
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:49,661
<i>It is not a day for politics.</i>

1876
01:40:49,704 --> 01:40:52,195
<i>I have saved this one opportunity...</i>

1877
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:53,502
I've been shot!

1878
01:40:53,541 --> 01:40:55,441
<i>My only event of today...</i>

1879
01:40:55,476 --> 01:40:56,568
I've been shot!

1880
01:40:56,611 --> 01:40:58,579
<i>To speak briefly to you</i>

1881
01:40:58,613 --> 01:41:03,050
<i>about the mindless menace
of violence in America,</i>

1882
01:41:03,084 --> 01:41:06,178
<i>- which again stains our land
-Can you help me?!</i>

1883
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:11,248
<i>- and every one of our lives.
-Can you help me? Please.</i>

1884
01:41:11,292 --> 01:41:15,456
<i>It is not the concern of any one race.</i>

1885
01:41:15,496 --> 01:41:17,259
<i>-Doctor! Anyone!
- The victims of the violence</i>

1886
01:41:17,298 --> 01:41:22,201
<i>are black and white, rich and poor,</i>

1887
01:41:22,236 --> 01:41:27,936
<i>young and old, famous and unknown.</i>

1888
01:41:27,975 --> 01:41:32,309
<i>They are, most important
of all, human beings</i>

1889
01:41:32,346 --> 01:41:36,749
<i>whom other human beings
loved and needed.</i>

1890
01:41:36,784 --> 01:41:38,911
- What happened, do you know?
- Somebody said he's been shot.

1891
01:41:38,953 --> 01:41:42,650
<i>No one, no matter where he lives</i>

1892
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:45,682
<i>- or what he does...
-Get a doctor, please!</i>

1893
01:41:45,726 --> 01:41:47,990
<i>Can be certain who next will suffer</i>

1894
01:41:48,029 --> 01:41:54,798
<i>from some senseless act of bloodshed.</i>

1895
01:41:54,836 --> 01:42:00,968
<i>And yet it goes on and on
and on in this country of ours.</i>

1896
01:42:01,008 --> 01:42:03,306
It's okay. It's okay. Plea...!

1897
01:42:03,344 --> 01:42:05,403
<i>Why?
-You'll be okay.</i>

1898
01:42:05,446 --> 01:42:08,074
<i>What has violence ever accomplished?</i>

1899
01:42:08,116 --> 01:42:09,947
<i>What has it ever created?</i>

1900
01:42:10,051 --> 01:42:12,383
Oh! Oh. Oh, my God!

1901
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:13,944
Dear.

1902
01:42:14,021 --> 01:42:15,488
Help!

1903
01:42:15,523 --> 01:42:18,048
<i>Whenever any American's life</i>

1904
01:42:18,092 --> 01:42:21,289
<i>is taken by another American
unnecessarily...</i>

1905
01:42:21,329 --> 01:42:22,796
William, come on!

1906
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:26,095
<i>Whether it is done
in the name of the law</i>

1907
01:42:26,134 --> 01:42:32,266
<i>or in defiance of the law,
by one man or by a gang,</i>

1908
01:42:32,306 --> 01:42:36,470
<i>in cold blood or in passion...</i>

1909
01:42:36,511 --> 01:42:37,808
I've been shot.

1910
01:42:37,845 --> 01:42:39,813
<i>In an attack of violence</i>

1911
01:42:39,847 --> 01:42:43,180
<i>or in response to violence,</i>

1912
01:42:43,217 --> 01:42:47,483
<i>whenever we tear at the fabric
of our lives</i>

1913
01:42:47,522 --> 01:42:50,491
<i>which another man has painfully
and clumsily</i>

1914
01:42:50,525 --> 01:42:54,222
<i>woven for himself and his children,</i>

1915
01:42:54,262 --> 01:43:00,223
<i>whenever we do this, then
the whole nation is degraded.</i>

1916
01:43:02,036 --> 01:43:06,939
<i>Yet we seemingly tolerate
a rising level of violence</i>

1917
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:10,375
<i>that ignores our common humanity</i>

1918
01:43:10,411 --> 01:43:13,869
<i>and our claims to civilization alike.</i>

1919
01:43:13,915 --> 01:43:16,611
Hey, Donny, what the heck's going on?

1920
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:18,642
Senator Kennedy's been shot.

1921
01:43:30,264 --> 01:43:34,064
<i>Too often, we honor swagger</i>

1922
01:43:34,101 --> 01:43:37,969
<i>and bluster and the wielders of force.</i>

1923
01:43:38,072 --> 01:43:40,836
<i>Too often, we excuse those</i>

1924
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:44,276
<i>who are willing
to build their own lives</i>

1925
01:43:44,312 --> 01:43:50,717
<i>on the shattered dreams
of other human beings.</i>

1926
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:54,786
<i>But this much is clear:</i>

1927
01:43:54,822 --> 01:43:57,188
<i>Violence breeds violence,</i>

1928
01:43:57,225 --> 01:44:00,717
<i>repression breeds retaliation,</i>

1929
01:44:00,761 --> 01:44:04,925
<i>and only a cleansing
of our whole society</i>

1930
01:44:04,999 --> 01:44:09,493
<i>can remove this sickness
from our souls.</i>

1931
01:44:15,476 --> 01:44:20,937
<i>For when you teach a man to
hate and to fear his brother,</i>

1932
01:44:21,048 --> 01:44:24,347
<i>when you teach that he is a lesser man</i>

1933
01:44:24,385 --> 01:44:27,718
<i>because of his color or his beliefs</i>

1934
01:44:27,755 --> 01:44:29,950
<i>or the policies that he pursues...</i>

1935
01:44:31,492 --> 01:44:34,552
<i>when you teach
that those who differ from you</i>

1936
01:44:34,595 --> 01:44:38,122
<i>threaten your freedom or your job</i>

1937
01:44:38,165 --> 01:44:41,396
<i>or your home or your family,</i>

1938
01:44:41,435 --> 01:44:44,871
<i>then you also learn
to confront others,</i>

1939
01:44:44,905 --> 01:44:48,068
<i>-All right, Captain...
- Not as fellow citizens,</i>

1940
01:44:48,109 --> 01:44:50,236
<i>but as enemies.</i>

1941
01:44:50,278 --> 01:44:55,375
<i>To be met not with cooperation,
but with conquest.</i>

1942
01:44:55,416 --> 01:44:59,944
<i>To be subjugated and to be mastered.</i>

1943
01:44:59,987 --> 01:45:05,391
<i>We learn, at the last, to look
at our brothers as aliens.</i>

1944
01:45:05,426 --> 01:45:11,729
<i>Alien men with whom we share
a city, but not a community.</i>

1945
01:45:11,766 --> 01:45:15,600
<i>Men bound to us in common dwelling,</i>

1946
01:45:15,636 --> 01:45:17,934
<i>but not in a common effort.</i>

1947
01:45:18,039 --> 01:45:20,940
Is impossible to believe...

1948
01:45:21,042 --> 01:45:24,273
<i>We learn to share only a common fear,</i>

1949
01:45:24,312 --> 01:45:30,308
<i>only a common desire
to retreat from each other.</i>

1950
01:45:30,351 --> 01:45:37,951
<i>Only a common impulse to meet
disagreement with force.</i>

1951
01:45:44,165 --> 01:45:46,633
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, baby.

1952
01:45:48,869 --> 01:45:51,235
You're gonna be okay.
Do you hear me?

1953
01:45:51,272 --> 01:45:53,331
You're gonna be okay, sweetie.

1954
01:45:53,374 --> 01:45:54,841
<i>Our lives on this planet</i>

1955
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:56,968
<i>- are too short.
-Jimmy! Look at me.</i>

1956
01:45:57,044 --> 01:45:58,443
<i>- The work to be done
-Cooper!</i>

1957
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:04,816
<i>Is too great
to let this spirit flourish</i>

1958
01:46:04,852 --> 01:46:08,344
<i>any longer in this land of ours.</i>

1959
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:20,028
<i>Of course, we cannot
banish it with a program</i>

1960
01:46:20,067 --> 01:46:22,934
<i>nor with a resolution...</i>

1961
01:46:24,972 --> 01:46:30,274
<i>but we can perhaps remember,
if only for a time,</i>

1962
01:46:30,311 --> 01:46:34,577
<i>that those who live with us
are our brothers,</i>

1963
01:46:34,615 --> 01:46:39,575
<i>that they share with us
the same short moment of life,</i>

1964
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:43,852
<i>that they seek, as do we,</i>

1965
01:46:43,891 --> 01:46:47,759
<i>nothing but the chance
to live out their lives</i>

1966
01:46:47,795 --> 01:46:51,231
<i>in purpose and in happiness,</i>

1967
01:46:51,265 --> 01:46:58,364
<i>winning what satisfaction
and fulfillment that they can.</i>

1968
01:47:14,088 --> 01:47:19,025
<i>Surely, this bond of common fate,</i>

1969
01:47:19,059 --> 01:47:22,927
<i>surely, this bond of common goals</i>

1970
01:47:22,963 --> 01:47:25,898
<i>can begin to teach us something.</i>

1971
01:47:27,935 --> 01:47:30,927
<i>Surely, we can learn, at the least,</i>

1972
01:47:31,005 --> 01:47:36,602
<i>to look around at those of us,
of our fellow men,</i>

1973
01:47:36,644 --> 01:47:39,772
<i>and surely, we can begin
to work a little harder</i>

1974
01:47:39,814 --> 01:47:44,751
<i>to bind up the wounds among us
and to become, in our hearts,</i>

1975
01:47:44,785 --> 01:47:48,949
<i>brothers and countrymen once again.</i>
