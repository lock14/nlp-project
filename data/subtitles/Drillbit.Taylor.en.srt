1
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:18,231
Please enjoy the music
while your party is reached.

2
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,105
- Hello?
- So what do you think?

3
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:32,268
- About what?
- About tomorrow.

4
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:33,825
It's our first day of high school.

5
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:37,183
If we want to be popular,
we just have to be proactive.

6
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:39,064
Calm your proactive ass down.

7
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:42,423
Saying you want to be popular
guarantees it isn't gonna happen.

8
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:44,986
I'm gonna get a girlfriend.
You think that's possible?

9
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,989
Anything's possible, Wade.

10
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:48,067
Just don't be needy.

11
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:50,547
You got to let it come to you.
And one more thing.

12
00:00:50,712 --> 00:00:54,261
From now on,
I don't want you calling me Ryan.

13
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:56,911
Call me T-Dog.

14
00:00:57,872 --> 00:00:59,271
- T-Dog?
- Yep.

15
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:02,472
- What does the "T" stand for?
- I don't know.

16
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:04,548
- But it sounds better than R-Dog.
- Yeah.

17
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:07,140
You know, like, if a hot girl
went up to you, and she goes,

18
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:11,106
"Hey, have you met T-Dog?
Man, did you see what T-Dog did today?

19
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:13,700
"Man, that T-Dog is crazy!"

20
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:16,266
That sounds like a guy
every woman would want to know.

21
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:20,146
- Hey, do I need a nickname?
- You have one. Skeletor.

22
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:23,025
That was last year.
I look good now. I'm filling out.

23
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:25,347
All right, name one part of your body
that filled out, Wade.

24
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:27,861
Name one part of your body
that isn't filled out, huh?

25
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:29,345
I'm not trying to offend you.

26
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:31,861
I'm just saying you shot up too fast
and you're freakishly skinny.

27
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,108
Oh, yeah? Well, you're too fat
and that's equally unattractive.

28
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:35,904
- You wanna go there?
- I'm sorry.

29
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:38,705
It's just, I want things to go well,
you know?

30
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,300
- Sorry I said you're freakishly skinny.
- It's okay.

31
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:42,660
You just are.

32
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:45,832
Hey, go to sleep!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

33
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:46,907
- What are you, crazy?
- Sorry.

34
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:47,987
- Is that your stepdad?
- No one.

35
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,067
- Give me that phone! Give it!
- It's...

36
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,501
You're in high school now.
Don't take his...

37
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:52,826
Go to sleep.

38
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,908
How about some
chicks on the walls in here?

39
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,829
It's like a nerd paradise.

40
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,866
Time to make the donuts.

41
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:30,860
Hoo-rah!

42
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:34,507
Touchdown!

43
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:37,346
We won! We won the game!
And Wade loses again!

44
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:39,349
- Get out of my room!
- Dad said get up.

45
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:40,825
He's not my dad. He's your dad.

46
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,829
Fine, the guy who does your mom
says get up.

47
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:44,704
- Just leave!
- Loser!

48
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:51,380
Morning, sunshine. First day of school.

49
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:53,743
- Mom!
- Oh, my God!

50
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,624
Since when did you start
sleeping naked?

51
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:58,391
I'm in high school now,
don't you remember?

52
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,231
I don't like elastic squeezing
on my ass when I sleep!

53
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:02,307
Okay.

54
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:06,222
Hey! What are you doing
in this shower?

55
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,344
Dawn? Rachel, that's right.
Nice to see you.

56
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,587
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

57
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:15,272
I'm the best white rapper
you've ever seen

58
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:18,941
A hair!

59
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,785
- Oh, my God!
- Look at that.

60
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:29,470
Thank you, ladies!

61
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,149
What's up, winners? You stoked?
Pedal to the metal?

62
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,261
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:38,381
All right. Who's a winner?

64
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:39,467
- I am!
- I am!

65
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:40,547
Morning!

66
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,267
- Look at you, with your magic stick.
- What do you think?

67
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,871
Magic is stupid.

68
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,106
No, no, honey.

69
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:49,506
- Mom!
- What?

70
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,270
You forgot the sausages!

71
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:55,142
- L'll get the sausages.
- Come on. I'm hungry.

72
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:56,830
All right, l'll get the sausages.

73
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,027
Out of the road!

74
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:59,665
Excuse me, listen,
I'm really sorry to bother you.

75
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,989
My family and I, we just ran out of gas
and we're trying to get to Disneyland.

76
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:06,309
We're on our way to church.
Maybe that's where you ought to go.

77
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:08,229
Thank you. Have a great day.

78
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:10,428
- Can you help out a veteran?
- Not today.

79
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:12,429
- Get away from the car.
- Honey, roll up the window.

80
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,541
Get away!

81
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:15,310
- What's your name?
- Drillbit.

82
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:17,184
Listen, Drillbit, I wasn't born yesterday.

83
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:21,271
I don't want you using this on
any marijuana or rye whiskey, okay?

84
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,826
- You got my word on it.
- You know what?

85
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,667
- I'm gonna write "not for pot" on there.
- You don't have to write.

86
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,783
Yeah. "Not for pot."

87
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:32,665
You're gonna feel pretty silly if you try
to buy weed with that, won't you?

88
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:35,390
Remember, put your best foot forward.

89
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:38,390
People decide what they think about you
in the first five seconds.

90
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,503
You know, you should hit the weights
with the boys and me.

91
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:42,623
- L'll pass.
- We'll get you in the gym.

92
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,585
We'll beef you up. Look at these guys.
Show them. Give him a gun shot.

93
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,191
Give him a crab.

94
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:49,705
Worship the sun.

95
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,348
- Yeah, look at these guys.
- They're freaks.

96
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,269
Not in my house!

97
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,429
- Have a great day.
- Okay, I love you, Dad.

98
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:59,510
I love you, too.
Have fun at school, Ryan. Bye.

99
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,743
- So what'd your dad say?
- He told me to have fun.

100
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,100
Wow, great parenting.

101
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,507
I don't know how
we're surviving without him.

102
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:12,702
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

103
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:16,144
- He's a piece of shit, anyway.
- Thank you, honey.

104
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,589
- Enchanté.
- Light... Light changed. Okay.

105
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:24,991
I love you!

106
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:28,745
- You're late today.
- Hey, get a job!

107
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:32,103
- You get a job.
- I already got one, giving money to you.

108
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,462
- How're you doing, Mrs Lampanelli?
- All right.

109
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:38,062
- You look beautiful today.
- You're a liar. But it works for me.

110
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:39,864
- Go on, get out of here, you nut!
- You earned it.

111
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:42,460
And don't spend it on food. Porn only!

112
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:49,623
First day of high school.

113
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:53,223
- It's kind of scary.
- Yeah, it sucks taking the bus.

114
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:57,506
Sure, last year we were the oldest
so we got to sit in the back of the bus,

115
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:01,386
but now we'll probably have to sit
in the front with the losers.

116
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,345
We'll be all right.

117
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:08,670
You have to have a proactive attitude
if you wanna be popular in high school.

118
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:12,148
People decide what they think of you
in the first five seconds.

119
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:18,470
I think you're a dork.

120
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,540
Oh, Wade.

121
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,025
- Oh, no.
- This is uncool.

122
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:24,870
We can't start high school like this.

123
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:27,267
You got to be shitting me. Come on.

124
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,383
- Please, am I dreaming here?
- No.

125
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:31,548
We're never allowed
to buy the same shirt again!

126
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:33,105
Whoever sees it first gets to buy it.

127
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,746
You guys should wear
red ribbons in your hair, too.

128
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:37,749
See? We both look like dorks.
Go change.

129
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,102
No! I'm the one who was
planning on wearing this.

130
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:43,668
Wade, I run the mile in 21 minutes!

131
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,262
How fast do you think I can go?

132
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,147
- Go! Hurry!
- I'm going!

133
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:54,386
Wade, bus!

134
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:56,425
- Perfect!
- Come on!

135
00:06:57,552 --> 00:06:59,702
What a way to start high school, huh?

136
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:05,542
Let me guess.
Two-for-one sale at Hot Topic?

137
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:08,027
- Losers!
- Dorks!

138
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:09,380
We're dead.

139
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:18,947
First day of our high school careers.

140
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:24,061
All right, let's light this fuse
and see what happens.

141
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:26,024
- Let's go, man.
- All right.

142
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:29,427
Are you guys part of a bowling team?

143
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:38,588
Last one.

144
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:40,623
Hey, at least it'll be easy
to find each other.

145
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,550
Yeah. L'll just look
for the kid with the same shirt.

146
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:50,902
- Come on!
- No, you have to spin it a few times first

147
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:52,226
to get it to work.

148
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:55,907
Thank you.

149
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,425
No, wait! Wait!

150
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,788
- What are you guys doing? Guys!
- Now, shut it. Move!

151
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:06,186
- No, thanks.
- Guys!

152
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:07,791
- Get out of the way!
- Man!

153
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:10,187
- Here we go.
- But that... That's not for me.

154
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:11,631
- That's for my books!
- Okay, here we go.

155
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:12,741
- In there.
- I am not a book!

156
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:14,510
- Get in there!
- This is bad.

157
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:17,146
- This isn't my locker! Please!
- No, this is good.

158
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:19,263
At least we know we're not
the biggest dorks in school.

159
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:20,871
- Please, please, please!
- Maybe we should say something.

160
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,141
It's survival of the fittest.

161
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:24,502
I've got to say something.
I got to. I have to.

162
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:27,385
Say something? It's hilarious.
The kid fits in the locker. Come on.

163
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:28,991
- That's not funny.
- Somebody, help!

164
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:30,340
This is the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

165
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:32,588
- Help! Please!
- Stop!

166
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:44,745
- I mean, you don't have to, but...
- Harry Potter.

167
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,544
You need to keep your big mouth shut.

168
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:50,186
Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to tell him.

169
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:55,142
- Hey!
- Run! Everybody run! It's not safe here!

170
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:58,070
Hey, check this out.
Matching shirt geeks.

171
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:59,261
Oh, my God.

172
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:01,303
Yo, Ron, these bitches
really wanna wear the same shirt.

173
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:02,660
Let's make them
wear the same shirt, huh?

174
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,464
Sounds good. Yeah.

175
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:08,668
The fat one here, the skinny one there,
it's just like...

176
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:11,987
There.

177
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:15,231
You better keep that shit on,

178
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:17,388
'cause if I see you trying to take it off,
you're dead.

179
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:19,662
And you know what happens
if one of you dies? Both of you dies.

180
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,181
'Cause you're Siamese queers, bitches!

181
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,027
That's very cute.

182
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,950
You look like those Velcro monkeys
who hug each other.

183
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,791
How was school, Wade?

184
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:39,346
We made so many friends,
I can't even remember all their names.

185
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:42,145
- Great! You got to be in it to win it.
- I am in it!

186
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:43,227
Great.

187
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:45,107
Yeah!

188
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:48,300
- Yeah.
- So school went well, huh?

189
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:50,946
Oh, it was great.
It couldn't have gone better.

190
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:54,223
It was the shirt, right?
L'll have to get you more of those.

191
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:58,025
Hey! What are you doing?
That's my stuff!

192
00:09:58,152 --> 00:09:59,141
This is city property.

193
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:01,024
Nobody's supposed to be
camping out here.

194
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,665
Your stuffs in the dumpster
around the corner.

195
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,908
In a dumpster? Come on!

196
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:08,388
- My taxes pay for your salary.
- You don't pay taxes.

197
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:11,026
- You don't even have a job.
- What else you wanna remind me of?

198
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,701
That I don't have good health care?
That I don't belong to a good gym?

199
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:17,141
- Go back to the Village People!
- Back up!

200
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:18,227
Damn!

201
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:22,863
All right, today is the first day
of our high school careers.

202
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:24,666
Yes, it is.

203
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:33,386
There she is.

204
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:36,026
That's the girl who came up to me
at my locker.

205
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:41,305
- Well, make your move.
- What move? I don't have a move.

206
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,024
All right, thanks for signing up.

207
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:59,347
How're you doing?

208
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,303
Is this your first time signing up
for the Heritage Club?

209
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:04,344
- Yeah, it is. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

210
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:10,189
What'd you sign up for?

211
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:14,590
- Photography and Asian Heritage.
- Asian Heritage, huh?

212
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:16,145
- I like your commitment.
- Yeah.

213
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:18,661
- I like it a lot.
- Hey, buddies! Remember me?

214
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:22,186
- Hi.
- Oh, Jesus H.

215
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,701
Oh, God.

216
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:27,981
Guys, why aren't you wearing them?

217
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:31,229
- Why are you talking to us?
- I just wanted to say thank you

218
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:32,865
for helping me out yesterday and all.

219
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,506
You guys are definitely the type of
people I'm gonna want to hang out with.

220
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:37,623
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Emmit Oosterhaus, by the way.

221
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:39,788
- Hi.
- Wade. That's T-Dog.

222
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:42,790
T-Dog? Dude,
that's a really cool nickname.

223
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,948
Hey, can you guys give me a nickname?

224
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,983
We need to ditch this guy.
He's like a stray cat.

225
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,784
Once you feed him,
he'll never go away, okay?

226
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:50,504
Hey, no secrets, T-Dog.

227
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:51,781
I'm off to U.S. History.

228
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:52,981
- U.S. History.
- Hey, look!

229
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,580
The Siamese queers had a baby.

230
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:57,748
I guess that makes them triplets,
now doesn't it?

231
00:11:57,872 --> 00:12:00,545
Well, actually,
we still wouldn't be triplets, see.

232
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:03,102
You see, they'd be my parents,
and I'd be the baby.

233
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:04,267
Don't get smart with me.

234
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:08,021
I said you're triplets and I think that
you guys need to get into his shirt

235
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:09,824
- and be triplets.
- We can do that.

236
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:12,420
You know what? Emmit, shut up.

237
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:15,350
Look, you really have to
do this crap, guys?

238
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:18,191
Come on, give us a break.
It's the second day of school.

239
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:20,542
Hey, I like this kid. Yeah.

240
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,547
Double Stufs got an attitude.

241
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,543
Yeah. We have to do this shit
because it's hilarious.

242
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,466
This school is boring.

243
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,301
Watching you freak out amuses me.

244
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:39,781
And, yeah, it's just the second day
of school. So guess what?

245
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:45,032
It's gonna keep coming
and coming and coming!

246
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:50,627
Party time!

247
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:53,627
- Stop peeing on me!
- Wait! Wait! No!

248
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,150
He pissed himself. What a loser.

249
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,147
Help.

250
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:14,987
Help me!

251
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,823
- Is that Mario Lopez, dude?
- Whoever he is, he's cute!

252
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:26,029
Take his pants off! Pants off!

253
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:46,422
- Up, down, up...
- Write your name!

254
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:55,666
No! Please, don't! No! Don't!

255
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:03,067
Bernie?

256
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,588
- Come on, give me one match, here.
- That's funny.

257
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:09,986
- All I need is one.
- Yeah, I like it.

258
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:12,467
- Will you just give up?
- Damn it! Look at that.

259
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:16,062
God, I can't even get one card!
Not one thing!

260
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:19,309
State of California just robbed me, Don.
You saw it.

261
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:24,545
You'd think... Where's my quarter?
Did you see my...

262
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:26,503
- You're always looking at me.
- Is the pill bottle... I forget,

263
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,624
- is that the castle or is that a rook?
- Don, did you just take my quarter?

264
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:32,027
No, I didn't take your quarter, Drillbit.

265
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:34,029
Not my fault you can't keep track
of your finances.

266
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:36,382
I don't know why you're spending all
your money on this dumb stuff, anyway.

267
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:38,980
You're unbelievable.
I got to get out of here.

268
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,262
You know,
I can't take this any more, man.

269
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:43,952
Rich people don't like us,

270
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:45,630
and the tourists are scared of us.

271
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,107
- When they see Bernie, they're terrified.
- Terrified.

272
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,826
They're not scared of me, I'm sexy.

273
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:52,431
- Sanitiser?
- Yeah.

274
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,391
Yeah. Thanks, man.

275
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:58,541
I just get... I'm like a bird.
I just wanna fly north. I want to...

276
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:01,429
I'd like to go to Canada.

277
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:03,430
What was it last year? I think it was,

278
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,224
- "I was gonna go to Iceland."
- Reykjavik.

279
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:06,307
- No, no.
- Where's that?

280
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:09,230
Yeah, but the thing about Canada,
if you go high enough north...

281
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:10,751
- That's right.
...the government pays you

282
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:12,191
- to take the land.
- That's the truth.

283
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,826
Yeah. Lookit, man,
the beer's twice as strong.

284
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,625
They don't lock the doors,
that should appeal to a man like you.

285
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,822
And what about
a British Columbian girl?

286
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,102
Does that sound like
a pretty potent mix?

287
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:24,223
Yeah, that's not too bad.
I kind of like that.

288
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:25,705
Okay, now, man, check this out.

289
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:28,585
One-way flight to Canada, $287.

290
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,987
You got to throw in 50 bucks for bribing,
what're they called,

291
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:32,830
- the Federales, the...
- Mounties.

292
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,465
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Mounties.

293
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:38,028
Another...
I want a good winter jacket, 80 bucks.

294
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:42,703
So we're talking $387 and it's a new
life for your old hombre, Drillbit.

295
00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:45,471
I dig it, man. Follow the dream.
Chase that thing.

296
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:47,264
How you gonna come up
with that kind of money, though?

297
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:48,427
Get a job.

298
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:50,907
I was an Army Ranger.
There are a lot of people dying for that.

299
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:53,626
Watch this kid play Hendrix.
He really jams. Look at him.

300
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,151
Oh, yeah, there he goes.

301
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:57,183
Yeah, I like how he looks
a little bit like Hendrix.

302
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,386
Yeah! I'm gonna give him a buck.

303
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:04,231
- L'll give him a couple bucks.
- A buck? Give him a compliment, man!

304
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,307
Give me a buck!

305
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,265
Why is he in my house?

306
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:26,304
Are we trying to attract
after-school bullies?

307
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,627
I'm here because
Wade invited me to be here.

308
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:30,743
Because I'm your friend now.

309
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:34,749
This fantasy land you live in,
Emmit, are there rides?

310
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:37,340
Stop picking on him, all right?
This is our guy.

311
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:38,871
I don't want him to be our guy.

312
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:42,621
Well, the good news is, I think I found
a solution to our problems.

313
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:45,343
- Kill Emmit?
- No, bear with me.

314
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,066
This might sound stupid,
but I was on the Internet last night

315
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:51,901
and there's a bunch of sites where
we can hire a professional bodyguard.

316
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:55,308
- What do you mean by bodyguard?
- Like he beats up kids that bother us.

317
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:59,186
A bodyguard? Wade,
that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

318
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:01,428
We should just be men
and fight these kids!

319
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:02,826
Are you serious?

320
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:06,791
Of course not. I've never been in a fight.

321
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:10,265
Have you seen those
high school fights on YouTube?

322
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:11,272
Kids are brutal.

323
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:11,863
Kids are brutal.

324
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,904
He gave us an earthquake
when we were peeing in the urinal.

325
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:17,987
He shoved me in a locker.

326
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:21,661
And he put my head in his shirt
and called us Siamese queers.

327
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:26,705
How's that funny?

328
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:29,505
It's not funny. It's just, it's rare that,

329
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,304
you know,
kids say things that surprise me.

330
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:34,185
Siamese queers.
I'd never heard that one.

331
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:40,142
- What would you like me to do?
- We really just want it to stop.

332
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,308
So are they pretty much free to say
whatever they want?

333
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,627
Or am I allowed to defend myself?

334
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,744
Oh, no. Principal Doppler,
I thought this was gonna be anonymous.

335
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:53,865
In this country, we give the accused
the chance to face his accusers.

336
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:55,425
Terry, come over here for a second,
will you?

337
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:58,191
Now we've known each other for...
Yeah, have a seat.

338
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:01,384
- What's your take on this?
- Hey, guys, hey. How's it going?

339
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,427
Be polite! There you go.

340
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,861
- Wade.
- Hi.

341
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:07,710
Hey, T-Dog. Give me a pound.

342
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:12,060
Yeah. Principal Doppler, sir,
I was really excited

343
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,025
about starting this new school year.
I'm not gonna lie.

344
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:18,822
Who knows?
I, maybe, was hazing them a little bit,

345
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,231
but I'm sorry.

346
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:23,540
I really am.

347
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:26,425
You know, I appreciate you taking
responsibility. It's refreshing.

348
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:28,668
- He doesn't mean it!
- We need to call his parents in.

349
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,942
- Now.
- He doesn't have any parents.

350
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:33,870
Well, not in this country, anyway.
They live in Hong Kong.

351
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:36,665
- He's an emancipated minor.
- What does that mean?

352
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,942
It means he's legally an adult.

353
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:40,990
He answers to no one.

354
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:43,664
He's above the law.

355
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:47,149
- What a nightmare, huh?
- Yeah.

356
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:49,907
Oh, crap.

357
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:52,107
Oh, no.

358
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:54,661
- Run.
- Go! Go!

359
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,549
- Run! Go, go!
- Hurry.

360
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,230
Wait for me!

361
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,145
Let's go, let's go!

362
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:39,345
Have you guys lost your mind?
Come on, let's go!

363
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:41,346
Go, go, come on!

364
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,510
- Come on.
- Oh, no!

365
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,943
- Run! Run!
- Go!

366
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,505
Get them, baby!

367
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:56,865
There! The garage!

368
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:20,591
You gonna rat on me, boys?

369
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:23,351
Try to get my parents involved
in this situation?

370
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:27,707
Now I have to make it my mission
to destroy you punks!

371
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:31,063
Hey! You kids get the hell off
my property!

372
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:34,184
I'm gonna give you three seconds,
then I'm getting my shotgun!

373
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:36,348
- No!
- You better get out of here right now!

374
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:38,622
- Please don't!
- No! Please!

375
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,867
One! Two! Three!

376
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,785
- Go! Go!
- And stay out, you gang bangers!

377
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,548
Charles, chai latte up.

378
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:04,983
- Hey! Get off my computer!
- Keep your shirt on.

379
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:06,067
Come on.

380
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,427
If this doesn't work,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

381
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,986
When it works,
you're going to kiss my ass.

382
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:15,945
How are we gonna know
which one's the bodyguard?

383
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,868
Have you ever done
this kind of thing before?

384
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:31,426
I worked for the hardest gangstas
in the world.

385
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:33,508
Kee Lo-Lo, Chenobee.

386
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:36,905
Hell, I still work for Tupac,
even though he dead.

387
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:41,148
I am Israeli Military Secret Service
Antiterrorist Squad.

388
00:21:41,872 --> 00:21:45,069
So when I kill this kid,
do you want me to do it quickly,

389
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:47,581
- or do you want him to suffer?
- Suffer.

390
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,582
If you hire Tiger's Protection Services,

391
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,464
not only do you get the Tiger,

392
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:56,470
but you get the protection
of his entire pride.

393
00:21:58,872 --> 00:21:59,907
Do you like hip-hop?

394
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:01,545
What the hell you implying
I like hip-hop for?

395
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:04,232
'Cause I'm dressed this way?
I like country. You like country?

396
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:07,344
That's the kind of music I like. Alabama.
Gimme some of that.

397
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:10,509
Some Brooks and Dunn.
The Dixie Chicks, bitch.

398
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:15,507
Kids hiring a bodyguard
to take care of a bully?

399
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:17,065
Stupidest thing I ever heard.

400
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:20,548
Back in my day, if a kid was getting
beat up, it was called childhood.

401
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,630
Pick somebody, anybody.
L'll go beat their ass

402
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:27,631
right here, right now, and then you can
ask them for a goddamned reference.

403
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:29,860
How about you, lady?

404
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:33,029
L'll kick your ass right now!
Close. Closed.

405
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:36,188
- Yeah!
- This is very disturbing.

406
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:38,348
You want an ass kicking?

407
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,943
What do you do
when you're not body guarding?

408
00:22:47,072 --> 00:22:49,188
I work at Raging Waters.

409
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:53,385
I sense great hesitation.
Wait one moment. Excuse me.

410
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,544
I'm going to borrow this.

411
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:58,740
- Please don't do that.
- Oh, God damn!

412
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,587
- $2,100 a week.
- $10,000 a week.

413
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:05,624
We're hoping you'd say, like,
around $100.

414
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:09,030
- Not interested.
- I hate kids like you.

415
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:11,302
I can't help you. No one can help you!

416
00:23:18,472 --> 00:23:21,225
- Susan, your double espresso's up.
- I'm Susan.

417
00:23:35,512 --> 00:23:37,070
I'm Drillbit Taylor.

418
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:46,550
U.S. Army Ranger, black ops operative,
decorated marksman,

419
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:50,426
- improvised weapons expert.
- Are you still in the military?

420
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:53,545
I was discharged.
Unauthorised heroism.

421
00:23:56,632 --> 00:24:00,420
Yeah. They call it an army of one
in the ads, but they don't mean it.

422
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:05,462
Unless they mean the whole army
working together as one.

423
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:07,822
But they certainly don't want one man
out there kicking ass

424
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:10,944
like an army of one,
which is the way I took it.

425
00:24:11,912 --> 00:24:14,870
As a bodyguard
I protected three Vice Presidents,

426
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:19,148
Bobby Brown, Sylvester Stallone...
Not as tough as he looks.

427
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:22,346
So what's the story?
Who do you guys need protection from?

428
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:25,623
It should be easy for you.
Just a high school bully.

429
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:28,425
Yeah. Run into a few of those in my life.

430
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:32,711
- What'd you do to provoke him?
- Well, he's fat, and he's a dork,

431
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:35,062
- and I'm awesome.
- Shut up, Wade.

432
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:38,184
By "awesome" do you mean
scared, skinny and Ionely?

433
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,747
Yeah.

434
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:42,947
Yeah.

435
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:47,711
- So how do we know you're legit?
- Come here. Go on, come here.

436
00:24:47,832 --> 00:24:49,424
I'm not gonna bite.

437
00:24:51,912 --> 00:24:53,709
I want you to look at my eyes.

438
00:24:54,552 --> 00:24:56,065
Take a good look.

439
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:01,226
Come here! What do you see?
You looking?

440
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,030
- What the hell have you seen?
- You want some?

441
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:11,071
These eyes have seen
unspeakable horror.

442
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:13,540
That's my evidence.

443
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:18,109
That's how you know if a guy's legit.
You need some evidence, too?

444
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:20,389
I've seen things you wouldn't believe.

445
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:23,902
I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark
near the Tannhauser Gate.

446
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:26,263
Isn't that Blade Runner?

447
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,460
Look closely 'cause it's all in there.

448
00:25:31,752 --> 00:25:32,707
Boo!

449
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:39,103
So, how much do you charge?

450
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:42,743
$387 a week.

451
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:45,390
- One second.
- I say yes.

452
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:47,310
I'm not even sure if I'm available.

453
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:49,707
- He's good.
- No! No! He's weird.

454
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:52,266
You know, we might be able
to work up to that.

455
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:54,862
But right now, we've only got $83.

456
00:25:57,592 --> 00:26:01,221
Okay, well, give me that now
and we'll figure out the rest later.

457
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,669
You know what this is?

458
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:07,945
It's a wing.

459
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:12,865
And you're under it.
All three of you, right there.

460
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:14,831
Okay, here's the mission plan.

461
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:18,991
Using my expertise at stealthy
and covert ops, l'll infiltrate the school

462
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:22,741
where I will watch over you
like the Lord Almighty himself.

463
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,430
Careful.

464
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:27,542
Like the Good Lord,
I'm gonna use some mysterious ways,

465
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:30,027
so you're not always gonna see me,
but l'll be there.

466
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:31,710
Especially when you don't see me.

467
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:33,629
But first, I'm gonna need some supplies.

468
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:35,185
- I want to go in and get...
- Like nunchucks?

469
00:26:35,312 --> 00:26:36,347
Maybe.

470
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:39,191
But a lot of stuff, l'll just get from
just what's laying around the house.

471
00:26:39,312 --> 00:26:40,267
You'd be surprised.

472
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:43,145
Anything can be turned into
a weapon of mayhem or destruction.

473
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,422
- Even a puppy?
- Especially a puppy.

474
00:26:45,552 --> 00:26:49,704
Germans used them in World War I.
Da Hunden Stormen. Lightning Dog.

475
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:53,989
They'd attach dynamite to them.
Rommel did it. Jerry bastard.

476
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:57,191
- Now, listen. One thing that...
- This is my house.

477
00:26:57,472 --> 00:26:58,825
Wow.

478
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:03,787
- We can go in. Nobody's home.
- Let's hit it. Deploy, soldiers.

479
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:07,587
- Soldiers? Cool. You hear that, T-Dog?
- Beeline, front door! Single file!

480
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:08,861
Officers first!

481
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:14,590
You, get me a bowl of cereal.
Go on. Scram.

482
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:26,311
- Okay, this I'm gonna need. Right here.
- What for?

483
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:28,024
You take that,
my mom'll rip my head off!

484
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:29,710
At ease, Casper!

485
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:32,062
Silver alloy,
one of the strongest ever constructed.

486
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,025
Probably stop an armour-piercing bullet
at point-blank range.

487
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,461
You don't really think
it could come to that.

488
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:38,661
You tell me.

489
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:42,223
Filkins is a whack job.
He almost ran over us with his car!

490
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:46,106
- He's a menace.
- Yeah, I was my dad's favourite, too.

491
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,268
He once cut a kid's arm off
with a samurai sword.

492
00:27:48,392 --> 00:27:50,064
- Bladed weaponry?
- Yeah.

493
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:53,822
Okay. I'm not gonna take any chances.
You're now on orange alert.

494
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:57,544
Okay, now this will be good
for video surveillance.

495
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,311
This is good.

496
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:01,707
You take the guts out of this
and use it for wiretapping.

497
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:05,142
I think we can use this as a...
I don't know, as a timekeeping device.

498
00:28:05,272 --> 00:28:06,944
I think l'll wear it on my wrist, possibly.

499
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:09,188
Testing, one, two. Mister Taylor?

500
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,780
- Testing, one, two.
- Can you come back now?

501
00:28:11,912 --> 00:28:14,107
Guys, you got to go far back!
I can hear you!

502
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:16,792
Testing, testing, one, two.
Can you hear me now?

503
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,029
- They work pretty good.
- These are great.

504
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:21,141
- Yeah.
- These are invaluable.

505
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:22,421
- They get a little staticky, though...
- Yeah.

506
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:23,985
...I think, some places in the house.

507
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:25,261
Why you need all this stuff for?

508
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:27,024
I thought we were gonna give
Filkins a beat down.

509
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:28,187
I am gonna beat him down,

510
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:30,462
but sometimes
after that first beat down,

511
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,469
then they get a little, you know...
They want a little payback.

512
00:28:32,592 --> 00:28:34,822
I'm home!
Who wants grilled-cheese sandwiches?

513
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:36,271
- Go! Go! Mom! Mom!
- Okay.

514
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:38,348
- Exit! Exit!
- Go, out the back, out the back, go.

515
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:39,951
Just 'cause you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

516
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:43,508
- Shut the door.
- Act natural. Hey, Mom.

517
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:45,031
- Hey, Barbara, how you doing?
- Hi, boys.

518
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:46,665
- Who's your new little friend? Hi.
- Hi.

519
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,305
- Hi. Emmit Oosterhaus.
- Hi, Emmit Oosterhaus.

520
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:50,104
- He's not our friend.
- Yeah, he is.

521
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:51,221
He's like our hamster.

522
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:52,910
Smell like something?

523
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:57,505
- Ryan? You washing?
- Yeah. You?

524
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:00,383
It's a funny smell. It's all right.
Grilled-cheese sandwiches.

525
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:03,227
Hey, come on! Buzz us in!

526
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:05,827
You're gonna wanna see this!

527
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,021
Big money coming in!

528
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:09,461
This ain't a bunch of
aluminium cans here.

529
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:10,661
Where do you want it?
Priceless treasures.

530
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,066
Go set them down there.

531
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:14,623
So you don't think those kids
are gonna miss this stuff?

532
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,549
No. They got two of everything.

533
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,381
They got the iPod, the iPod Nano.
And I don't care if they do,

534
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,629
'cause after this little transaction,

535
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:26,983
well, the old Drillbit's taking his act
to the Great White North.

536
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:29,182
- What?
- Yeah, I'm going to Canada.

537
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,667
Well, that's stupid.
You're gonna cut out now?

538
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,829
- I'm going...
- These kids are a cash cow, Drillbit.

539
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:37,068
You need to hang in there.
You don't cut and run.

540
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,308
You got to get in there and milk this.

541
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:40,785
Okay, come on back.

542
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:45,390
All right, l'll tell you what.
I give you $125 for the whole lot.

543
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:46,467
What?

544
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:49,231
I just heard you say
you took it from some kids.

545
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:51,502
So? Don't get all righteous on me.

546
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:54,192
Half this store you guys got
from crackheads and thieves.

547
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:56,382
Hey. Who the hell
do you think you are, man?

548
00:29:56,512 --> 00:29:58,104
Let me tell you something.
Those people are our customers!

549
00:29:58,232 --> 00:30:00,268
We're not that harsh on them,
so you shouldn't be!

550
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:02,223
How would you like it
if we called you a crackhead?

551
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,626
You have called me one.

552
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:06,027
- Have we? Have we?
- I think I might have.

553
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:08,423
- Drillbit? Drillbit? Come in.
- What is that?

554
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:11,942
I'm sorry, hold it just a second.
D.B. One-four-niner-eight, come in.

555
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:13,551
- Just take this.
- We just wanted you to know

556
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:15,503
that Emmit was holding out
on some bar mitzvah money.

557
00:30:15,632 --> 00:30:19,022
Emmit, I don't care how many times you
get bar mitzvahed, you're not a man.

558
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,141
- I am a man.
- No, you're not.

559
00:30:20,272 --> 00:30:22,467
- Drillbit! Milk it, milk it.
- So we'll have another 50 bucks for you

560
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,583
- on Monday.
- Grab the udder and milk it.

561
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:26,987
Ten-four, good buddy.
I will see you tomorrow.

562
00:30:27,112 --> 00:30:30,661
Commence radio silence in three, two...

563
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:35,186
Today's the official start
of our high school careers.

564
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:38,509
Last week's history.
Nothing good came out of last week.

565
00:30:38,632 --> 00:30:41,829
- We became best friends.
- Nothing good came out of last week.

566
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:44,227
There's the sword. Man, we're so dead.

567
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:47,469
- Where's Drillbit, Wade?
- Hey. Calvary's here.

568
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:49,548
- Please, where have you been?
- Yes. What's up, man?

569
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:52,027
Where's my money?
Where's my money?

570
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:56,104
We got 40 bucks we promised,
plus we got an extra 17.

571
00:30:56,232 --> 00:30:57,221
I sold my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

572
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:58,501
Look, guys, this is gonna be sweet.

573
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:00,384
I can't wait to watch
you kick Filkins' ass.

574
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:03,470
- Yeah. What, is he here?
- Yeah, over there on his car.

575
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:04,741
I want you to be
the last face he ever sees.

576
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:05,861
What are you gonna do?

577
00:31:05,992 --> 00:31:07,471
- What am I gonna do?
- Come on.

578
00:31:07,592 --> 00:31:09,822
I want you to gnaw on his skull.

579
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:11,909
Okay. Come here for a second.
Come here.

580
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:13,750
- Before I gnaw on his skull, come here.
- What are you doing?

581
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,544
Come over here. Come here.
Gather around.

582
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:17,981
This is serious. I thought
you were gonna go kick his ass.

583
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:20,262
Look at Tommy Trigger Finger.
You want the blood and the guts.

584
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:21,711
Well, it doesn't work that way.

585
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:23,345
I can't just kick his ass.

586
00:31:23,472 --> 00:31:27,226
Physically, I can,
but if you kick a bully's ass,

587
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,468
then maybe you guys live till lunchtime.

588
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:30,991
And then what?

589
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:34,707
"Teach those victims how to kick
the bully's ass and they live forever."

590
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:35,981
Steven Seagal.

591
00:31:36,272 --> 00:31:38,103
So you're gonna teach us
how to beat him up?

592
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:41,463
- Like train us?
- So we're gonna beat up Filkins?

593
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,267
What I'm about to show you are
top-secret black ops fighting moves.

594
00:31:46,392 --> 00:31:48,189
And it's all about technique.

595
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:49,631
I don't care if you're talking about

596
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:54,587
karate, tai chi, kung fu, praying mantis,

597
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,510
kung pao, Panda Express.

598
00:31:57,632 --> 00:32:00,704
It's all about technique.
I want you to watch my technique.

599
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:03,586
It's pretty flawless.
Come on, Ryan, charge me.

600
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:05,384
I'm serious. Try to kill me.

601
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:08,151
Come on. You ready?
Go! Yeah. Come on.

602
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:09,864
I got ya!

603
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,788
I got ya! I got ya!

604
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:17,500
Damn it!

605
00:32:17,632 --> 00:32:21,989
Okay. Tripped right there.
That was the bear hug.

606
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:25,071
Okay. Wade. Come on!

607
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:27,311
Here you go! Watch the elbows!

608
00:32:27,432 --> 00:32:28,865
Don't! Stop!

609
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:32,382
Okay. Last but not least. Charge me.

610
00:32:36,392 --> 00:32:37,950
Everyone, up! Circle me!

611
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:40,267
Come on.
Let me see some fight from you.

612
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,025
Okay, you guys ready for the blizzard?

613
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:44,985
- Go get him, boys!
- Yeah. Go, get it, all three of you!

614
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:49,790
I call truce! Truce! Back up! Three's
too many. Three's too many. Stop.

615
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:53,587
Wow, one of you
really charley-horsed me.

616
00:32:53,712 --> 00:32:57,068
Okay.
Now it isn't all oriental martial arts.

617
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,752
Sometimes you give
a little Mexican judo as in

618
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:01,351
"Ju don't know who
you're messing with, homes."

619
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:05,181
Come on, Ryan, one more. Last one!
Show me your mettle. Come on! Olé!

620
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,107
Wow!

621
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,141
Ryan!

622
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:11,064
Man down!

623
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:13,827
Ryan!

624
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:17,031
Was that my fault?

625
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:21,025
Hey! Check this out.

626
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,427
Dude! You fell like 60 feet.

627
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:25,750
Jeez, that was crazy.

628
00:33:26,952 --> 00:33:27,941
What is this?

629
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,391
This is a strategic outpost.

630
00:33:29,512 --> 00:33:31,389
I got these posted all over the city.

631
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:32,740
Don't even look at it, okay?

632
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:34,703
Now let's get back up there
and get to work.

633
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:37,505
What's this for?
To wash your balls in the morning?

634
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:41,382
No. Look like a squeegee to you?

635
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:43,503
Or does it look like a weapon
with a straight edge

636
00:33:43,632 --> 00:33:45,827
and a little mop to clean up the blood?

637
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:49,064
T-Dog, Emmit, this way.

638
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:50,784
- Where's Drillbit?
- I don't know.

639
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:52,868
- Wait up.
- Should be right up here.

640
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:00,826
Man down!

641
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:03,545
Take this.

642
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:04,392
- Take a swing at my head.
- Oh, no.

643
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:04,949
- Take a swing at my head.
- Oh, no.

644
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:06,790
Wade, come on. Just hit me.

645
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,550
- But it'll hurt.
- Wade, hit me.

646
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,344
- L'll do it.
- Shut up.

647
00:34:14,392 --> 00:34:18,271
I feel no pain,
'cause I have a trained mind.

648
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:19,381
- Go!
- Come on.

649
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:21,787
- Let's beat it.
- Come on, come on, come on, let's go.

650
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:26,824
- Hey, Drillbit. We could make s'mores!
- No.

651
00:34:26,952 --> 00:34:29,671
- How much does a Hug Me Bear cost?
- No.

652
00:34:30,232 --> 00:34:33,588
- Where'd you get the kids, Drillbit?
- I won them in a poker game.

653
00:34:34,232 --> 00:34:35,221
Order up!

654
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:37,741
- How's this part of the training?
- It's called bulking up.

655
00:34:37,872 --> 00:34:40,340
- I'm already fat.
- Hey. You're not fat.

656
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:41,981
I don't want to hear you say you're fat.

657
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:47,391
Words like lard ass, fat pig, butterball,
landslide, mudslide.

658
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:50,151
I don't want to hear that.
What are you tipping the scales at?

659
00:34:50,272 --> 00:34:51,625
180.

660
00:34:51,752 --> 00:34:52,821
What?

661
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:55,707
Whenever you're ready, boys.

662
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:56,901
Okay, one of you guys
got to pick this up,

663
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:57,987
'cause I'm still on the clock.

664
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:02,105
Filkins. Filkins.

665
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:04,462
Avoidance technique!
Avoidance technique!

666
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:09,351
Come out here, Capone!
You want to fight?

667
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:10,985
You want to fight,
you and me, right here?

668
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:12,591
This is very important. See that?

669
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:14,430
What's the matter? Afraid to
come out from behind your men?

670
00:35:14,552 --> 00:35:16,110
- He has a holdback guy.
- Afraid to stand up for yourself?

671
00:35:16,232 --> 00:35:18,223
Now that allows people to think
that you want to fight

672
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:19,626
when really he doesn't want to fight.

673
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:21,504
You got nothing in court.
You don't got the bookkeeper.

674
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:22,985
When I'm here I'm your holdback guy.

675
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:24,943
So now you can act crazy.

676
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:26,750
No, hey, hey, calm down.

677
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:31,627
I'm gonna kill you!

678
00:35:31,752 --> 00:35:34,141
Hey, stop! Stop!

679
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,591
Calm down.

680
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:36,747
- Hoo-rah.
- Hoo-rah.

681
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:39,584
Get under the wing.

682
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:43,985
Put all the bills facing
the same direction.

683
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:46,307
Yeah, don't worry about it, Don.

684
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:48,468
I thought these kids were loaded.

685
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:51,585
It's like all you read about are how
14-year-olds rule the marketplace,

686
00:35:51,712 --> 00:35:52,986
and look at this.

687
00:35:53,112 --> 00:35:56,343
Hardly got anything. You think this is
gonna get me to the Great White North?

688
00:35:56,472 --> 00:35:58,508
Allow me to make a point real quick.

689
00:35:58,752 --> 00:35:59,821
Hello, delicious.

690
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:03,149
Drillbit? Do you know
why we come here every day?

691
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:07,270
It's because these businessmen
can't eat all their food.

692
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:09,463
They have more than they need.

693
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:12,106
These kids are a lot like
these businessmen, okay?

694
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:14,268
They have way more than they need.

695
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:17,623
It's our job to go into their houses
and take all their excess.

696
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:19,743
I get a kick out of these kids.

697
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:23,111
I told you that little fat one
says some funny shit.

698
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:24,665
I like these kids, too, man.

699
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:27,704
I mean, from what I gather,
they're some pretty cool dudes.

700
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:30,300
But if you like them,
you should think about helping them.

701
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:32,388
- Lf you care about them.
- What do you mean?

702
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:33,740
Steal their TV.

703
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,064
Maybe they'll read a book.

704
00:36:36,192 --> 00:36:40,071
Steal their iPod. Heck, I don't know.
Maybe they'll learn to play the piano.

705
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:42,505
They don't need all this crap.

706
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:44,190
You think Mozart had a Game Boy?

707
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:47,941
I didn't have it. Didn't hurt me.
I was outside playing, climbing trees.

708
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:51,701
Yeah, man, me, too.
I'm still outside hanging around in trees.

709
00:36:52,592 --> 00:36:55,743
And the parents are never around.
There's no one there in the daytime.

710
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:57,988
One big hit. It's all we need.

711
00:37:02,232 --> 00:37:04,143
Now, listen.
We're about 10% done with training.

712
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,261
- Next...
- 10%?

713
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:08,111
Are you high?
We can't sit in the woods any more.

714
00:37:08,232 --> 00:37:10,951
- We got to go back to school.
- Yeah, and I can't forge any more notes.

715
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:13,267
How many diseases can a kid have?

716
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:21,827
You guys think you're ready?

717
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:25,507
You know,
I am really scared to go back.

718
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:28,625
Look. If you're not ready to fight,
there is another alternative.

719
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:29,741
But I got to be honest with you,

720
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,023
only the strongest of warriors
can pull this one off.

721
00:37:34,392 --> 00:37:38,783
It's so difficult that most men
tremble at its mere thought.

722
00:37:39,432 --> 00:37:40,706
What is it?

723
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:42,663
What the hell is it?

724
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:46,781
Love him.

725
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:49,029
- What?
- Love him.

726
00:37:49,152 --> 00:37:51,268
You know, I don't know
what's going through your head, Drillbit,

727
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:53,348
but I'm not gonna bang him.

728
00:37:53,712 --> 00:37:55,270
When I'm talking about love,
I mean compassion.

729
00:37:55,392 --> 00:37:58,145
- I'm not going to...
- Shut up. And understanding.

730
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:00,906
Find your commonality.

731
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:04,069
Let him know you're more alike
than different.

732
00:38:04,912 --> 00:38:06,868
Maybe that'll put out his fuse.

733
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:09,821
And remember, guys,

734
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:12,705
just because you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

735
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,541
L'll be there like a silent,
deadly poltergeist.

736
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:17,707
- Thanks.
- Okay.

737
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:18,947
All right, see you later, Drillbit.

738
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:20,664
Remember, you're under my wing.

739
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:25,547
Oh, no.

740
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:28,027
There he is. Should we hide?

741
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:30,825
No. We've been running
and hiding all week.

742
00:38:30,952 --> 00:38:33,910
This is what Drillbit's been
talking about, finding commonalities.

743
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:37,707
He's rapping. You love to rap!
You can do this!

744
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:38,947
No, I can't.

745
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:40,983
Yes, you can. It's just like in 8 Mile.
He'll respect you.

746
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:42,750
No, man, I'm afraid of him. I can't!

747
00:38:42,872 --> 00:38:45,181
- You're crazy! Don't do it.
- You can do it, Ryan.

748
00:38:45,312 --> 00:38:46,950
- I believe in you.
- Don't.

749
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:50,983
All right. I can do it. I can do it.

750
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,746
- Whassup, whassup?
- Whassup?

751
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:59,552
I wanna rap with you.
Hey, flip the script, Ronnie.

752
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:00,821
Hit that beat.

753
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,381
- Yo, this cool, Fil?
- Sure, whatever.

754
00:39:05,192 --> 00:39:06,944
Yo, call me whatever you want

755
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:09,461
but you know I gets busy I'm so badass

756
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:12,060
I'm the king of Vice City
Like the Buddha, I'm Zen

757
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:14,308
Like Beckham, I bend, I tell suckers

758
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,309
"Say hello to my little friend"

759
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:18,426
Snap! This guy!

760
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:23,901
Hey, meatball, where's your spaghetti?
Your rapping's like a nightmare

761
00:39:24,032 --> 00:39:25,545
But I don't see Freddy
You best

762
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:28,266
not even try to spit rhymes, dude
'Cause when you spit

763
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:30,781
all I ever see is chewed-up food

764
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:32,705
Yeah, that's how we roll!
That's how we do!

765
00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:33,821
Hold on!

766
00:39:33,952 --> 00:39:35,180
I know you didn't just go there

767
00:39:35,312 --> 00:39:38,190
I got more skills than you
in my one and only nut hair

768
00:39:38,472 --> 00:39:39,746
Nice, man, nice.

769
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:42,872
So you better step off
before you insult me and mine

770
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:45,506
'Cause if you decide to step on, see
I'm like a land mine

771
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:46,860
Boom!

772
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:51,912
Oh, my God, look
it's a punkass rapping

773
00:39:52,112 --> 00:39:54,421
He say one more word
I'm gonna have to bitch-slap him

774
00:39:54,552 --> 00:39:57,066
So surprised you're moving
ass is so damn fat

775
00:39:57,192 --> 00:40:00,309
You're lucky I don't hit you
with my Wiffle, Wiffle Ball bat

776
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,744
Can't hurt my head with a bat
I'm the Incredible Hulk

777
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:07,103
I'm like Costco
I'm serving ass kickings in bulk

778
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:09,792
You don't like my words
Mister King of the School?

779
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:12,904
Well, guess what?
You can suck on my family's jewels

780
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:14,300
Bitch!

781
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:24,708
That was awesome.

782
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,060
What have I just done?

783
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:27,671
Hey, that was amazing. I mean,

784
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,191
telling him to suck on
your two family jewels

785
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:30,950
was in questionable taste, but still...

786
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:33,222
I know, I got caught up
in the moment, okay?

787
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:35,343
Keep walking.
I don't want to get shot like Tupac.

788
00:40:35,472 --> 00:40:38,270
You know, most of those people
were cheering for you.

789
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:41,270
Really? That could be good.
Maybe Drillbit was right.

790
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:46,790
Think you're so funny?

791
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,824
Good. 'Cause you're not gonna laugh
when you're dead.

792
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:53,024
You're gonna get it now,
worse than ever.

793
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,301
All of you.

794
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:57,506
Ryan, holdback technique.

795
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,108
You don't like the fact that
he's better than you, Filkins!

796
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:02,621
You better back the hell off before I...

797
00:41:06,352 --> 00:41:11,221
- Thanks for holding him for me.
- Holy crap, you guys are retarded!

798
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,583
How did he do so much damage
with one punch?

799
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:18,828
It's like his fist is the size
of your whole face.

800
00:41:18,952 --> 00:41:20,704
I guess it's true.

801
00:41:20,832 --> 00:41:21,981
Rap really does promote violence.

802
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,421
Yeah, but the question is, where was
Drillbit when we needed him?

803
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:26,065
Maybe he got called to the black ops.

804
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,864
Wade, come on.
You really believe that garbage?

805
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:29,948
There's my little soldiers.

806
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:33,349
There are my pooper troopers.

807
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:37,181
Hey, sorry I missed that walkie-talkie
call. I had something come...

808
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:41,869
- What the hell happened to you?
- Filkins punched me.

809
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,862
- Filkins did that to you?
- Yeah.

810
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:46,061
Where were you?

811
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:48,262
- With one punch?
- Where were you?

812
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:52,224
- Oh, crap. I'm sorry.
- Stop.

813
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:54,468
- No, just let me get the blood off.
- No. Stop.

814
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:56,583
Man. Here, sit down for a second.

815
00:41:56,712 --> 00:41:59,306
- Crap. It looks painful.
- Yeah, it is.

816
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,384
- Here, let me put a little pressure on it.
- No.

817
00:42:01,512 --> 00:42:03,025
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

818
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:04,744
Ryan had a rap off with Filkins.

819
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:07,466
- You had a rap off?
- You said to find common ground.

820
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:10,629
He said he was like Costco,
serving up ass kickings in bulk.

821
00:42:10,752 --> 00:42:12,708
That's what you said?
That's not common ground.

822
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:14,470
Even though it's funny.

823
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:16,708
That's not exactly what I meant
when I said common ground.

824
00:42:16,832 --> 00:42:19,471
Why didn't you get punched?
Why'd he slug you?

825
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:21,503
'Cause of your brilliant
holdback technique.

826
00:42:21,632 --> 00:42:24,226
The holdback technique?
You really tried that?

827
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:27,788
Yeah. Bottom line is
your advice backfired.

828
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,425
Now we're more screwed than ever.

829
00:42:29,552 --> 00:42:31,588
All because you wanted to protect
the hobbit over here.

830
00:42:31,712 --> 00:42:33,192
- Hey, let's just stop for a second.
- I am not a hobbit.

831
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:34,984
- You're a damn hobbit, okay?
- I am not!

832
00:42:35,112 --> 00:42:38,582
Hold it! Hey.
Emmit's not a hobbit, I don't think.

833
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:41,065
Problem isn't the holdback technique,

834
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:44,184
although I don't think you guys
had it perfected enough to try.

835
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,825
The problem is Randy
starts rapping insults.

836
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:48,705
It's not Randy! Okay? It's Ryan!

837
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:52,950
And all this talk about you being there
when you're not there, it's bull! Okay?

838
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:55,229
I'm tired of your nonsense! You're fired!

839
00:42:55,352 --> 00:42:59,345
Hey! Sit down here.
Sit down here for a second.

840
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:03,909
All of you, sit down. You take the bass
out of your voice when you talk to me.

841
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:06,429
Now, we just completed phase one.

842
00:43:06,552 --> 00:43:09,066
See if this guy has any mettle.
And guess what we found out?

843
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:12,628
Filkins does have some mettle.
So now we move to phase two.

844
00:43:12,752 --> 00:43:16,028
Know what phase two is?
Direct contact.

845
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:19,628
That's where I come in.
Because I will not let this happen again,

846
00:43:19,752 --> 00:43:21,549
if I can help it.

847
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:23,264
So what's the plan?

848
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,791
- The plan?
- Yeah.

849
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:30,303
How early do you guys
have to get up for school?

850
00:43:30,432 --> 00:43:31,387
- 7:00.
- 7:00.

851
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:35,710
Oh, God. Okay.
Tomorrow, we all go in together.

852
00:43:42,632 --> 00:43:45,510
Hey, Wade, what's up?

853
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:47,946
Where'd you get the shiner?

854
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:50,108
Come in here, boy. Talk to me.

855
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:55,547
I was protecting this one kid
in my school

856
00:43:55,672 --> 00:43:58,425
from a bunch of bullies
and one of them punched me.

857
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,510
What? Why would you protect
the kid from a bully?

858
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:04,550
So he doesn't get beat up.

859
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:07,380
Then you're interfering
with the natural order.

860
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,623
When I was a kid, I was kind of a bully.

861
00:44:10,752 --> 00:44:13,744
But it's not a bad thing. There was
this kid. I don't know what it was.

862
00:44:13,872 --> 00:44:17,660
Maybe it was his stupid face.
But he'd just really get under my skin.

863
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:20,590
So I pushed him around a little bit,
called him some hurtful names,

864
00:44:20,712 --> 00:44:23,909
and I honestly think, if I met him today,
he'd thank me for it.

865
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:26,751
I prepared him for the harshness
of the real world.

866
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:29,180
Thanks, Jim.

867
00:44:29,312 --> 00:44:32,429
I'm a resource, Wade.
You should use me more often.

868
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:42,067
...if I remember how to do this.
It really is strong enough for a man.

869
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:54,552
Did your dad leave any socks behind?

870
00:44:55,512 --> 00:44:58,788
How many tardies can you have
before they give you a detention?

871
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:02,782
Emmit, you're drying my eyeballs.

872
00:45:06,032 --> 00:45:09,786
All right, here's our class schedules
and a detailed map of the school.

873
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:12,710
We have the first class together,
so just meet us by the Life Skills room

874
00:45:12,832 --> 00:45:13,867
so you can walk us to our lockers.

875
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:15,664
Okay, now, remember,
I'm not just gonna walk in there

876
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:17,942
and start kicking ass, okay?
I got to protect you guys,

877
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:20,381
but I need to blend in and lay low.

878
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:24,744
I'm gonna be visible to you guys,
but invisible to everyone else.

879
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:35,870
That's a look that says,
"I have no idea what I'm doing here."

880
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:40,990
All first-time subs have it.
Welcome to McKinley!

881
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:45,823
- Thanks. Was it that obvious?
- Well, yeah, a little bit.

882
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,021
Whoa!

883
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,588
Not you kids. Please, go to class.
Go, go, go. Get away from me.

884
00:45:52,432 --> 00:45:55,105
You, second floor, teachers' lounge.

885
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,223
They'll give you your assignment
up there. It's right over there.

886
00:45:57,352 --> 00:45:59,866
- I'm gonna head up there. Okay.
- Yep? You got it.

887
00:46:08,312 --> 00:46:09,745
How're you doing?

888
00:46:11,632 --> 00:46:14,783
Teachers' lounge. They're all the same.

889
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,831
Put your names on the food. Smart.

890
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:21,501
Sneaky.

891
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:25,500
- See Grey's Anatomy last night?
- Yeah.

892
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,141
- Hey, Lis.
- Hi.

893
00:46:28,272 --> 00:46:30,024
Got half an orange with your name on it.

894
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:31,551
Oh, no, thanks.

895
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:48,910
- Can I help you?
- No. With what?

896
00:46:49,592 --> 00:46:52,106
- Are you lost?
- No. Why?

897
00:46:52,632 --> 00:46:56,022
- You look like a lost parent.
- No.

898
00:46:56,152 --> 00:46:58,950
No. I'm a substitute.

899
00:47:00,832 --> 00:47:04,871
- For what?
- For whatever needs substituting.

900
00:47:06,512 --> 00:47:10,425
Yeah, they'll just plug me in.
I think I'm just gonna wait here until,

901
00:47:10,552 --> 00:47:13,510
you know, if they need me in
French, then that's where l'll go.

902
00:47:13,632 --> 00:47:16,192
- You know French?
- A little bit. Yeah.

903
00:47:16,312 --> 00:47:19,782
Enough to get by,
or enough to teach these animals.

904
00:47:21,752 --> 00:47:23,868
- What do you teach?
- English.

905
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:25,906
My native tongue.

906
00:47:29,552 --> 00:47:31,031
I'm Lisa Zachey.

907
00:47:32,752 --> 00:47:35,141
Now is that Miss or Missus Zachey?

908
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:40,392
- Miss.
- Miss. It had to be. Enchanté.

909
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,223
And who are you?

910
00:47:44,432 --> 00:47:46,821
Drill... Dr Illbit.

911
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:48,661
Oh.

912
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:49,941
- Yeah.
- A doctor.

913
00:47:50,072 --> 00:47:53,587
Teacher. Teacher and a doctor.
Just want to help.

914
00:47:53,712 --> 00:47:57,546
People don't care how I do it.
Just give me a chance to help.

915
00:47:57,872 --> 00:48:01,501
- You want some hot coffee?
- Only in the worst way.

916
00:48:03,952 --> 00:48:06,386
Who can give me
another name for gonorrhoea?

917
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:10,625
That's a little hint.

918
00:48:10,752 --> 00:48:14,950
That's right, the clap. Or the drip.

919
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:17,229
All right, Dane? Get the lights.

920
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:21,630
In the male, the bacteria of gonorrhoea
usually enters by way of the urethra.

921
00:48:21,752 --> 00:48:25,142
From two to five days later,
the guy feels a painful burning,

922
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:26,910
particularly when he urinates...

923
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,182
They make these things to scare us.
I'm not scared of this.

924
00:48:29,312 --> 00:48:32,145
...looks like this.

925
00:48:32,392 --> 00:48:36,544
- I really like your suit.
- Yeah. I really like your everything.

926
00:48:36,672 --> 00:48:38,105
Now what do we do?

927
00:48:38,232 --> 00:48:40,587
Not many teachers
can afford a suit like that.

928
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:42,543
- Yeah?
- Lf he wants to eat.

929
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:45,822
Well, I mainly eat out of a dumpster.

930
00:48:47,912 --> 00:48:49,823
I should try that.
I need some new dresses.

931
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:53,740
Don't. Or if you do, stay away from
the one at Ocean and Wilshire.

932
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:57,467
That's mine. Seriously, stay out of it.

933
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:01,141
- What are we doing? Let's go.
- I don't know.

934
00:49:01,712 --> 00:49:03,464
You're a bad boy.

935
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:07,148
- Maybe I need a detention.
- You're funny.

936
00:49:08,272 --> 00:49:10,945
- I'm not joking.
- Me, either.

937
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:19,707
Look, I want nothing more
than to spend the rest of the day

938
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,982
sitting on this couch with you,

939
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:25,627
but I got to get to class because
my students need me. Okay?

940
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:29,347
No. You still have five minutes
before the next class.

941
00:49:29,672 --> 00:49:30,627
We do?

942
00:49:30,752 --> 00:49:34,745
And you seem like someone who could
accomplish a lot in five minutes.

943
00:49:35,112 --> 00:49:36,830
I hope so.

944
00:49:36,952 --> 00:49:39,910
Although five minutes
might be four too many.

945
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:44,950
Let's go, let's go!

946
00:49:45,072 --> 00:49:47,540
We really like Life Skills.
Can we just stay in the room, maybe?

947
00:49:47,672 --> 00:49:49,708
Why don't you practise
some life skills out here in the hallway?

948
00:49:49,832 --> 00:49:51,345
It's just as important.

949
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:53,181
Okay, where is he?

950
00:49:53,312 --> 00:49:56,031
This is bull. Maybe I should
just beat the crap out of you two.

951
00:49:56,152 --> 00:49:57,904
There's Brooke!

952
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:04,151
Oh, no. There he is.

953
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:11,741
I think I'd better get...

954
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:13,271
When are you free? I want to see you.

955
00:50:13,392 --> 00:50:15,428
- I have sixth period free.
- Sixth period? Okay.

956
00:50:15,552 --> 00:50:17,144
I think I have that period free, also.

957
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:18,990
Why don't we meet back here? Okay?

958
00:50:19,112 --> 00:50:20,545
- Okay.
- Meet me right here?

959
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:22,071
L'll keep the couch warm.

960
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:25,025
We better check the tags to make sure
this couch is flame retardant.

961
00:50:25,152 --> 00:50:26,346
- I will.
- You know?

962
00:50:26,512 --> 00:50:28,230
You know what I mean?
Flame retardant?

963
00:50:28,352 --> 00:50:29,831
- Yes.
- 'Cause you're hot.

964
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:33,820
Where is Life Skills?

965
00:50:36,192 --> 00:50:38,308
Drillbit, come in, please!
Where are you?

966
00:50:38,432 --> 00:50:39,387
Drillbit, come in!

967
00:50:39,512 --> 00:50:41,901
I don't know!
I can't understand Emmit's map!

968
00:50:42,392 --> 00:50:45,350
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, Emmit. Come on.

969
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:48,710
- Crap!
- I knew Drillbit was a fraud.

970
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:50,788
- I told you!
- He's gonna be here!

971
00:50:50,912 --> 00:50:52,061
Life Skills!

972
00:50:52,232 --> 00:50:54,700
I need Life Skills!

973
00:50:55,272 --> 00:50:56,591
Out of my way!

974
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:06,260
Open the door!

975
00:51:06,392 --> 00:51:07,666
How is that up to code?

976
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:09,592
Excuse me!
Mordor Castle coming through!

977
00:51:09,592 --> 00:51:09,990
Excuse me!
Mordor Castle coming through!

978
00:51:12,912 --> 00:51:15,472
Excuse me!
Mordor Castle coming through!

979
00:51:26,952 --> 00:51:28,908
This is real! This is not a drill.

980
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:30,784
Everybody, clear the hall!

981
00:51:30,912 --> 00:51:33,551
That means you! Let's go!
Clear the hall!

982
00:51:35,952 --> 00:51:38,102
The freak actually came through, huh?

983
00:51:39,392 --> 00:51:40,507
Awesome!

984
00:51:47,632 --> 00:51:49,304
- Hoo-rah.
- Hoo-rah.

985
00:51:51,352 --> 00:51:52,341
All right.

986
00:52:01,272 --> 00:52:03,228
Mister Filkins!
Why don't you just come up

987
00:52:03,352 --> 00:52:05,946
to the front of the class and read from

988
00:52:06,072 --> 00:52:08,461
The Collected Works
of the Romantic Poets?

989
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:15,387
"I like kissing this and that of you

990
00:52:15,512 --> 00:52:20,267
"I like slowly stroking the shocking fuzz"

991
00:52:24,232 --> 00:52:27,542
Hey, aren't you the guy that
kicked Filkins' butt freestyling?

992
00:52:28,352 --> 00:52:30,741
You better believe it.
They call me T-Dog.

993
00:52:30,912 --> 00:52:34,222
- Wow, that's cool.
- He is so cute!

994
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:35,387
Wow.

995
00:52:35,512 --> 00:52:37,628
Wade, this is Drillbit. Come in. Wade?

996
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:40,826
- Yeah?
- Filkins is heading east down the stairs.

997
00:52:40,952 --> 00:52:43,386
The first stairwell. He's coming
down now. Watch your ass.

998
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:44,945
Read you. Copy. Roger.

999
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:47,825
F.Y.I., I just heard this pack of girls
yapping, and your girl, Brooke,

1000
00:52:47,952 --> 00:52:51,547
just got cast in Romeo and Juliet.
You might want to check that out.

1001
00:52:51,992 --> 00:52:55,871
Madam, madam, your lady mother
is coming to your chamber!

1002
00:52:56,792 --> 00:52:59,352
The day is broke, be wary, look about.

1003
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:05,623
Come on! You're dogging it!
Faster! Faster!

1004
00:53:05,752 --> 00:53:07,629
Go! I want to see some more!

1005
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:12,701
Go! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go! One more!

1006
00:53:12,872 --> 00:53:14,624
And you guys!
I don't want you just watching!

1007
00:53:14,752 --> 00:53:17,186
Do some bass fishing! Then reel it in!

1008
00:53:17,312 --> 00:53:18,301
Come on!

1009
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:20,821
Let's go, keep going!
Work some thumbs!

1010
00:53:20,952 --> 00:53:22,544
For texting!

1011
00:53:24,232 --> 00:53:25,381
Look out, huh?

1012
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:29,461
- How was school, Professor?
- It is great.

1013
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:33,667
And as long as you got a coffee cup
in your hand, nobody says anything.

1014
00:53:36,312 --> 00:53:37,984
I was thinking
about writing a paper on...

1015
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:39,545
Hey! What the...

1016
00:53:39,672 --> 00:53:40,627
Coffee cup.

1017
00:53:40,752 --> 00:53:43,346
Now, Castro,
he knew that he was not gonna get

1018
00:53:43,472 --> 00:53:45,144
any action with Marilyn Monroe.

1019
00:53:45,272 --> 00:53:47,547
And that is why John F. Kennedy
was shot.

1020
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:54,943
- Don!
- Hello, fellow teacher.

1021
00:54:00,552 --> 00:54:02,588
Come on, guys, hit the showers!

1022
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:07,906
Look, my rope's too short.
I can't get down.

1023
00:54:08,032 --> 00:54:10,865
Where you going? Get back here!

1024
00:54:11,672 --> 00:54:14,027
Yo, hold on! What is this?

1025
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:16,268
Ronnie, let yourself down.

1026
00:54:27,072 --> 00:54:31,702
Happy birthday, Dr Illbit

1027
00:54:31,832 --> 00:54:36,667
Happy birthday to you

1028
00:55:23,432 --> 00:55:26,742
Hey, T-Dog. You've got to admit
hiring Drillbit was a good idea.

1029
00:55:27,272 --> 00:55:28,864
- Okay, you're right.
- See?

1030
00:55:29,032 --> 00:55:32,263
The freak's actually worth all the money
we're spending on him, I guess.

1031
00:55:32,392 --> 00:55:33,791
Good morning.

1032
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:37,462
- Great coffee this morning, Dr Illbit.
- Enjoy it.

1033
00:55:37,992 --> 00:55:40,267
- You know, I really like it here.
- You're doing a great job, Drillbit.

1034
00:55:40,392 --> 00:55:41,461
I know I am.

1035
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:43,430
Come here, come here, come here.

1036
00:55:43,952 --> 00:55:45,943
Okay, quick. Pop quiz. You like a girl.

1037
00:55:46,072 --> 00:55:47,664
You're completely shocked
that she likes you.

1038
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:50,670
Things are already just crazy hot,
just loco.

1039
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:52,703
But now you'd like to ask her out.

1040
00:55:52,832 --> 00:55:55,869
And you're not sure if
she's just in it for the sex.

1041
00:55:55,992 --> 00:55:58,028
And you haven't been
on a date in forever.

1042
00:55:58,152 --> 00:55:59,585
And you're a little bit afraid,

1043
00:55:59,712 --> 00:56:01,430
and you don't know
what the hell you're doing, anyway.

1044
00:56:01,552 --> 00:56:02,985
Well, I can't really relate to that,

1045
00:56:03,112 --> 00:56:05,501
but what I would do is just
join every club she's in

1046
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:08,066
and eventually work up
the nerve to talk to her.

1047
00:56:08,192 --> 00:56:10,547
- And how's that working for you?
- Not at all.

1048
00:56:10,672 --> 00:56:12,981
Okay, look. Why don't you
do the opposite?

1049
00:56:13,112 --> 00:56:14,670
- Yeah, probably.
- Okay.

1050
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:18,866
Congratulations, you just passed.
Hey, scram. Scram. Crotch blocker.

1051
00:56:21,952 --> 00:56:23,021
- Hey.
- Hey.

1052
00:56:23,152 --> 00:56:25,541
- Look, you look pretty.
- Thank you.

1053
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:27,550
You know,
I haven't been on a lot of dates,

1054
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:30,266
and I really don't know the way
this is supposed to work,

1055
00:56:30,392 --> 00:56:31,791
because we kind of skipped that part.

1056
00:56:31,912 --> 00:56:36,064
But would you ever want to get together
after school and maybe hang out?

1057
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,671
I'd love to.

1058
00:56:40,352 --> 00:56:42,547
- L'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

1059
00:56:43,512 --> 00:56:46,390
The Battle of Sekigahara

1060
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:51,350
when Kanetsugu mocked
Tokunaga's abuses,

1061
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:54,909
which only infuriated Tokunaga

1062
00:56:55,632 --> 00:57:01,946
who then summoned Toyotomi
and united Japan.

1063
00:57:02,472 --> 00:57:04,827
And kept the local feudal lords
from warring.

1064
00:57:04,952 --> 00:57:07,625
Hey. What are you doing in this club?

1065
00:57:07,752 --> 00:57:09,105
I'm Asian.

1066
00:57:09,232 --> 00:57:10,631
He died. Then...

1067
00:57:10,752 --> 00:57:13,027
- No, you aren't.
- Yeah. A little bit.

1068
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:14,627
Really?

1069
00:57:16,272 --> 00:57:19,184
- You don't even look a little Asian.
- Yeah, I know.

1070
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:21,903
The West attacked first.

1071
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:25,869
So how come I see you in, like,
so many activities I'm in?

1072
00:57:27,312 --> 00:57:30,941
Just... I joined some of the clubs
you were in because

1073
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,869
I wanted to have a chance to talk to you.

1074
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:38,066
Wakisaka, 990 men.
Ankokuji, 1,800 men.

1075
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:41,425
So you're not Asian.

1076
00:57:41,552 --> 00:57:42,507
No.

1077
00:57:44,032 --> 00:57:46,751
Well, maybe somewhere way back.

1078
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:51,662
Chosokabe, 6,600 men.
This is exciting, don't you think?

1079
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:53,111
All these men.

1080
00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:55,109
Well, you can't quit now.

1081
00:57:55,232 --> 00:57:57,188
I'm gonna make you come
to all our meetings.

1082
00:57:57,312 --> 00:57:59,303
Membership is way down this year.

1083
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:01,024
Okay. I can do that.

1084
00:58:02,072 --> 00:58:05,951
- Is everything okay at school?
- Yeah. Everything's fine. I'm busy.

1085
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:09,951
Honey, I know there's a lot of pressure
on kids once they get to high school.

1086
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:11,585
And there are kids who are gonna
want to be your friend,

1087
00:58:11,712 --> 00:58:14,180
but they'll also want you
to take their drugs.

1088
00:58:14,872 --> 00:58:17,181
I just noticed that you seem
to be out of money a lot lately,

1089
00:58:17,312 --> 00:58:19,542
and I want to make sure
you're not spending your money on that.

1090
00:58:19,672 --> 00:58:22,140
No! I'm not doing drugs, Mom.
I promise.

1091
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:24,342
Coach says drugs are for losers.

1092
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:27,470
You sure you're not high?

1093
00:58:28,192 --> 00:58:29,181
No!

1094
00:58:29,312 --> 00:58:31,030
Well, I notice you're really going
at your food.

1095
00:58:31,152 --> 00:58:34,269
- Got the munchies?
- Anyways, we just worry about you.

1096
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:35,787
I understand that.

1097
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:39,222
Also, I'm missing a silver platter
that was in the living room.

1098
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:41,104
- Have you seen it?
- I'm taking Home Ec.

1099
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:43,302
We needed serving trays
for appetisers. Sorry.

1100
00:58:43,432 --> 00:58:44,990
Yeah, well, come to think of it,
I'm missing a watch.

1101
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:46,830
You didn't take that to Home Ec, too,
did you?

1102
00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:48,908
Oh, yeah.
We're making watch cupcakes, Jim.

1103
00:58:49,032 --> 00:58:50,385
Watch it, wise guy.

1104
00:58:56,072 --> 00:58:57,471
Hey.

1105
00:58:58,712 --> 00:59:01,545
Careful, Wade. You don't sneak up
on somebody like that.

1106
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:02,821
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1107
00:59:02,952 --> 00:59:04,749
But I could have jumped up
and killed you in two moves,

1108
00:59:04,872 --> 00:59:07,386
and then, I don't know, I'd feel guilty.

1109
00:59:07,512 --> 00:59:10,026
- I talked to Brooke.
- Really? Have a seat.

1110
00:59:10,152 --> 00:59:12,063
- I think she might like me.
- Yeah?

1111
00:59:12,192 --> 00:59:13,910
Yeah. At least a little bit.

1112
00:59:14,032 --> 00:59:15,863
That's all you need.
Get your foot in the door.

1113
00:59:15,992 --> 00:59:18,347
I don't think I would have had
the confidence to have tried without you.

1114
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,700
- I mean...
- Come on.

1115
00:59:19,832 --> 00:59:21,948
It's been great having someone
around who, like, likes me

1116
00:59:22,072 --> 00:59:24,142
and isn't making fun of me
or telling me to join the football team

1117
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:25,591
like my stepdad.

1118
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:28,624
Just do your best. Be all you can be.
What's the Army always say?

1119
00:59:28,752 --> 00:59:30,265
"Have it your way."

1120
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:34,067
I think that's Burger King.

1121
00:59:36,312 --> 00:59:38,382
Where do you think they got it from?

1122
00:59:41,232 --> 00:59:43,666
Men talking about women.

1123
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:45,703
- What else is there?
- Here.

1124
00:59:47,072 --> 00:59:49,540
We made this for you.

1125
00:59:49,872 --> 00:59:51,146
An army of four.

1126
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:55,669
I don't know if you understand,

1127
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:59,102
but before we met you, we thought
our lives were gonna suck forever.

1128
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:01,020
At least I did.

1129
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:08,181
Well, you're right. I don't understand
because of how hardened I am.

1130
01:00:09,312 --> 01:00:12,304
Tough thing about what I do
is I can't let my guard down.

1131
01:00:14,192 --> 01:00:16,467
Well, for what it's worth,

1132
01:00:16,592 --> 01:00:19,948
I hope after all this is done,
you'll still be my friend.

1133
01:00:20,072 --> 01:00:21,027
Bye.

1134
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:31,190
And here I was all worried that
you were gonna take me

1135
01:00:31,312 --> 01:00:33,701
to some hip dance club or something.

1136
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,947
That's definitely not me.

1137
01:00:37,512 --> 01:00:39,230
But, no, I'm actually more of

1138
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:41,866
a kind of simple,
just down to earth outdoorsman.

1139
01:00:42,112 --> 01:00:44,342
I like that you don't try too hard.

1140
01:00:44,992 --> 01:00:48,302
The truth is,
this is me trying really, really hard.

1141
01:00:48,832 --> 01:00:50,151
That's cute.

1142
01:00:52,992 --> 01:00:55,301
Look, I want to talk to you. I mean...

1143
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:01,869
There's some things
I want you to know about me.

1144
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,823
I want us to look each other in the eye,

1145
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,510
and I want us to get it out on the table,

1146
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:08,590
and we just, you know,
we listen, and there's no judgement.

1147
01:01:08,712 --> 01:01:13,832
God. You're just so great. You're really
just like the perfect guy for me.

1148
01:01:14,272 --> 01:01:16,502
- Really?
- I'm serious.

1149
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:20,784
You're just beautiful,
and you're nice to me, and it's so great.

1150
01:01:21,392 --> 01:01:25,271
'Cause I'm really just always attracted
to just such dirtbag guys.

1151
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,387
They're out there.

1152
01:01:26,512 --> 01:01:29,982
I'm a real loser magnet.
It's, like, on some unconscious level,

1153
01:01:30,112 --> 01:01:35,027
I just need to be with a guy who has
absolutely nothing going for him.

1154
01:01:35,152 --> 01:01:38,906
You know, just some loser,
some bum lying pig.

1155
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:40,226
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- You know, just...

1156
01:01:40,352 --> 01:01:41,341
Stop it.

1157
01:01:41,472 --> 01:01:45,181
I get it. You made some bad choices,
and who hasn't?

1158
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,147
It's just you were starting
to rant a little bit.

1159
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:49,591
It's just I'm happy to be
with somebody...

1160
01:01:49,712 --> 01:01:50,701
I know.

1161
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,551
You're with a doctor now.

1162
01:01:54,272 --> 01:01:56,627
Yeah. Thank God.

1163
01:01:58,312 --> 01:01:59,950
Let's just kiss.

1164
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:14,386
Did you do that?

1165
01:02:15,072 --> 01:02:17,540
Kid just jumped out of the bushes
and started jamming. That's weird.

1166
01:02:19,232 --> 01:02:20,904
I got nothing to do with it.

1167
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:45,942
- That naked guy's my teacher!
- What?

1168
01:02:46,272 --> 01:02:47,785
- Yeah!
- He ain't your teacher!

1169
01:02:47,912 --> 01:02:50,870
Every day he's at the off-ramp.
I give him some change.

1170
01:02:51,072 --> 01:02:52,824
What do you mean? Like a bum?

1171
01:02:52,952 --> 01:02:56,149
What are you talking about?
He's not a bum! Less fortunate!

1172
01:02:58,032 --> 01:02:59,511
Yeah, or get out of the way.

1173
01:02:59,632 --> 01:03:00,701
How're you doing?

1174
01:03:00,832 --> 01:03:02,390
- Hey, how's it going, Drillbit?
- Hey, Drillbit.

1175
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,070
So, listen,
you know the thing we talked about?

1176
01:03:04,192 --> 01:03:05,261
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1177
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:06,541
- Plan's off.
- What?

1178
01:03:06,672 --> 01:03:09,311
- Drillbit! Drillbit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1179
01:03:09,632 --> 01:03:10,826
What do you mean the plan's off?

1180
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:13,546
It's not off. I just mean let's...
Let's postpone it.

1181
01:03:13,672 --> 01:03:15,230
'Cause I don't think we need
to get their belongings now.

1182
01:03:15,352 --> 01:03:17,229
These kids,
they kind of look at me like I'm a hero,

1183
01:03:17,352 --> 01:03:18,831
and, I don't know,
let's run with that for a little bit.

1184
01:03:18,952 --> 01:03:20,067
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1185
01:03:20,232 --> 01:03:22,268
You're really getting into this whole
teacher thing here, huh?

1186
01:03:22,392 --> 01:03:24,144
With the sweaters and the loafers.

1187
01:03:24,272 --> 01:03:26,991
- They're wingtips.
- You look like you teach Fagonometry.

1188
01:03:27,112 --> 01:03:29,068
What the hell is this? Who are you?

1189
01:03:29,192 --> 01:03:32,502
I got an old saying for you, Drillbit,
"You can't polish a turd."

1190
01:03:32,872 --> 01:03:34,942
Hey, Don, first of all,
that's not an old saying.

1191
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:36,061
You stole that from me.

1192
01:03:36,192 --> 01:03:38,547
I say it all the time.
Secondly, I'm insulted.

1193
01:03:38,672 --> 01:03:41,106
Well, you should be. Drillbit, I know you.

1194
01:03:41,352 --> 01:03:43,502
And the real you
would do this deal, man.

1195
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:47,181
There's a lot of heads that want to feed
off of this, man. Don't let us down.

1196
01:03:47,312 --> 01:03:48,711
No! No, that's just it.

1197
01:03:48,832 --> 01:03:50,743
For the first time,
I'm not letting everybody down.

1198
01:03:50,872 --> 01:03:53,386
- And now you're not making any sense!
- Yeah.

1199
01:03:53,512 --> 01:03:57,425
That guy's a fraud!
He's a bum in a Mister Rogers sweater!

1200
01:04:01,352 --> 01:04:03,104
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Okay, check it out, check it out.

1201
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:04,267
I just saw the new substitute...

1202
01:04:04,392 --> 01:04:06,223
Delta-four-niner,
this is Yu-Gi-Oh-seven.

1203
01:04:06,352 --> 01:04:07,990
On the highway to the danger zone.

1204
01:04:08,112 --> 01:04:09,670
Repeat, on the highway, over.

1205
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:11,544
Oh, shitballs!

1206
01:04:11,672 --> 01:04:13,742
Yu-Gi-Oh-four-seven,
you are not clear to cross.

1207
01:04:13,872 --> 01:04:15,863
Repeat, you got a bogie northbound.

1208
01:04:15,992 --> 01:04:17,266
- Oh, crap.
- Guys, hold your position.

1209
01:04:17,392 --> 01:04:18,381
I'm en route.

1210
01:04:18,512 --> 01:04:20,104
Guys, hold your position!

1211
01:04:21,832 --> 01:04:23,424
Come here, you little rat turds!

1212
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:25,031
No! Come on!

1213
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,426
Yo, so what'd you do, huh?

1214
01:04:26,552 --> 01:04:28,782
What, did you give the substitute
teacher some spare change

1215
01:04:28,912 --> 01:04:30,789
- so he'd give us a hard time?
- Get them!

1216
01:04:30,912 --> 01:04:32,106
Mister Filkins?

1217
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:33,745
Excuse me. I need you to get to class.

1218
01:04:33,872 --> 01:04:36,022
And you three,
I want you out of here, too!

1219
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:37,426
- Go on!
- Hey.

1220
01:04:37,552 --> 01:04:39,429
Get out of my face, you bum!

1221
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:42,066
Maybe I will
if you stop hassling these kids.

1222
01:04:42,192 --> 01:04:43,511
But until you're ready to do that,

1223
01:04:43,632 --> 01:04:45,748
I'm gonna give you
some detentions to think about it.

1224
01:04:45,872 --> 01:04:47,863
Please, just don't,
don't give me detention.

1225
01:04:47,992 --> 01:04:50,711
Yeah. That's my power,
and I will exercise it.

1226
01:04:50,832 --> 01:04:52,902
And then what? Huh? You gonna make
us shower on the beach

1227
01:04:53,032 --> 01:04:54,385
with you and the rest of the bums?

1228
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:56,628
- Yeah, we're on to you, buddy.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1229
01:04:56,752 --> 01:05:00,381
What a freak. You got some
weird little fantasies there, kid.

1230
01:05:00,512 --> 01:05:03,151
Okay, here's the deal.
Let me make it real simple.

1231
01:05:03,272 --> 01:05:05,024
I'm a faculty...

1232
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,830
Punk-ass!

1233
01:05:08,232 --> 01:05:11,144
- He got me right in the ear!
- Run! Run!

1234
01:05:11,272 --> 01:05:13,786
- Yeah! Run! Save yourself!
- Run!

1235
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:14,907
Medic!

1236
01:05:15,872 --> 01:05:17,305
Medic!

1237
01:05:17,672 --> 01:05:19,549
I got hit right in the nose!

1238
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:21,668
Followed up by a shot to the ear!

1239
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:24,741
Oh, man. Okay.

1240
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:29,544
Oh, that doesn't work at all.

1241
01:05:30,872 --> 01:05:33,705
- This whole time he's a bum!
- Hey! Hey, you guys, hold it! Wait up!

1242
01:05:33,832 --> 01:05:36,551
- Guys, let me explain!
- Explain what, huh?

1243
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:39,623
Filkins is just gonna come after us
harder than ever!

1244
01:05:39,752 --> 01:05:40,741
What was that about showering
on the beach?

1245
01:05:40,872 --> 01:05:41,861
You guys, hold it.

1246
01:05:41,992 --> 01:05:42,947
Why would you shower on the beach?

1247
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,027
Why don't we all just shower
on the beach?

1248
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:45,187
It's part of my morning fitness regimen!

1249
01:05:45,312 --> 01:05:47,223
I jog on the beach five miles,
then I swim ten miles.

1250
01:05:47,352 --> 01:05:49,502
That's what I do to stay in shape.
Then I shower.

1251
01:05:49,632 --> 01:05:51,190
So, why didn't you defend yourself?

1252
01:05:51,312 --> 01:05:53,621
'Cause I got sucker punched!
Look at this!

1253
01:05:55,472 --> 01:05:56,825
Then I got hit in the ear,

1254
01:05:56,952 --> 01:06:00,024
which you probably can't even see,
'cause it's so deep in the ear canal.

1255
01:06:00,152 --> 01:06:01,141
I didn't really get hurt,

1256
01:06:01,272 --> 01:06:04,184
but I just kind of went down
to give you guys a chance to get away.

1257
01:06:04,312 --> 01:06:05,745
We paid you to beat him up!

1258
01:06:05,872 --> 01:06:08,864
How am I gonna beat him up
with all these kids around?

1259
01:06:08,992 --> 01:06:11,790
Okay, then the principal comes
and maybe some cops.

1260
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:13,868
They'll find out I'm not a real teacher.

1261
01:06:13,992 --> 01:06:16,301
What good am I
if I'm sitting there in jail?

1262
01:06:16,432 --> 01:06:18,741
Look, I took a bullet for you guys today.

1263
01:06:19,272 --> 01:06:20,864
You guys got off scot-free!

1264
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:22,630
- Did you get hurt?
- No.

1265
01:06:22,752 --> 01:06:24,390
- Did you get hurt?
- No.

1266
01:06:24,832 --> 01:06:27,505
I'm like one of those guys
jumping in front of the President.

1267
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:30,271
And, look, I'm not expecting a thank you.
That's my job.

1268
01:06:30,392 --> 01:06:31,950
But maybe give me a bonus
or something.

1269
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:34,666
Sly used to throw in a car
every now and then.

1270
01:06:37,512 --> 01:06:39,309
I'm so sorry, Drillbit.

1271
01:06:42,152 --> 01:06:44,541
What am I gonna do with you guys?

1272
01:06:45,912 --> 01:06:47,550
You want some cereal?

1273
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:50,140
- You got any Cap'n Crunch?
- Yeah.

1274
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:51,427
Let's go.

1275
01:06:55,486 --> 01:06:56,475
- Drillbit!
- What are you doing?

1276
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:57,959
- What the hell?
- No, don't, stop. Come on.

1277
01:06:58,086 --> 01:06:59,485
- Put that stuff down!
- Hey, no way, man!

1278
01:06:59,606 --> 01:07:01,039
- Drillbit, why you yelling?
- Drillbit, back off, man!

1279
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:03,475
- You know these guys?
- No, I don't know these people!

1280
01:07:03,606 --> 01:07:04,675
We're almost done here, all right?

1281
01:07:04,806 --> 01:07:06,876
- I am freaking out!
- My parents are gonna kill me!

1282
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:08,325
- What the hell's going on?
- Everything's fine!

1283
01:07:08,446 --> 01:07:09,595
- Screw this, man! I'm out of here!
- Wait a second!

1284
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:10,761
- Why are you all yelling?
- Don?

1285
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:13,002
- Not like this! What are you doing?
- Take it easy!

1286
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:15,117
- Just take it easy, man.
- This isn't the plan.

1287
01:07:15,246 --> 01:07:17,157
- Relax.
- All the shit's gone in your house.

1288
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:18,480
You came to me as a man,
I came to you as a man.

1289
01:07:18,606 --> 01:07:20,005
All the shit is gone in my house!

1290
01:07:20,126 --> 01:07:21,479
- Are you...
- Don't you touch me!

1291
01:07:21,606 --> 01:07:23,562
Don't make me Billy Jack your ass.

1292
01:07:25,446 --> 01:07:26,481
Watch out!

1293
01:07:36,646 --> 01:07:38,716
That's how you Billy Jack
somebody's ass.

1294
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:39,915
Come on, Bernie, let's go!

1295
01:07:40,046 --> 01:07:41,764
Let's go!
Go on, get out of the way, man!

1296
01:07:41,886 --> 01:07:43,399
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1297
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,721
You'd better run! I saw your faces!

1298
01:07:45,846 --> 01:07:48,076
I got a photogenic memory!

1299
01:07:48,246 --> 01:07:50,362
Get out of my house, you asshole!

1300
01:07:50,486 --> 01:07:53,080
What? There's another one?
L'll kill the asshole!

1301
01:07:53,206 --> 01:07:56,118
No! You, asshole! Get out of my house,
now! Look at what you've done!

1302
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:57,884
I didn't do anything!

1303
01:07:58,046 --> 01:07:59,923
I'm trying to help you guys! Look at me!

1304
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:01,764
Wade, I think one of them peed
in your kitchen.

1305
01:08:01,886 --> 01:08:03,877
- Great!
- Should I call the police?

1306
01:08:04,006 --> 01:08:06,042
No, don't call the police! Just stop.

1307
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,918
Drillbit, just tell us the truth.

1308
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:11,197
You can't handle the truth! I can't...
What do you want to hear?

1309
01:08:11,326 --> 01:08:13,203
That I was raised in an orphanage?

1310
01:08:13,326 --> 01:08:15,965
That I... That no one wanted me?
You don't want to hear that!

1311
01:08:16,086 --> 01:08:17,724
'Cause that's a lie, too!

1312
01:08:20,286 --> 01:08:23,483
Fine. Maybe I wasn't completely straight
with you guys about who I am.

1313
01:08:23,606 --> 01:08:25,517
So you lied about being in the military?

1314
01:08:25,646 --> 01:08:28,922
No! That's true. I was trained
by the United States Army.

1315
01:08:29,046 --> 01:08:31,765
Then why could a teenager beat you up
with so little effort?

1316
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:35,242
Because I don't like violence.
I wasn't cut out to be a soldier.

1317
01:08:35,526 --> 01:08:37,881
- Boo-hoo.
- I like the parts with the repelling

1318
01:08:38,006 --> 01:08:41,282
and the crawling through the mud
and the swinging on the monkey bars

1319
01:08:41,406 --> 01:08:44,523
and the helping the wounded,
but I don't like confrontation.

1320
01:08:44,966 --> 01:08:48,322
Even this, with you three ganging up
on me, is not... I don't...

1321
01:08:48,846 --> 01:08:50,882
- It's really... I'm sorry.
- Shit!

1322
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:54,124
You were in the military, huh?
Tell me where you served.

1323
01:08:54,646 --> 01:08:58,639
My company was in the Middle East,
and I was there for like half a day.

1324
01:08:58,766 --> 01:09:03,282
I saw some camels and heard some,

1325
01:09:03,886 --> 01:09:06,400
I think, were some explosions,
I don't know.

1326
01:09:07,126 --> 01:09:11,039
And it was...
It was so hot over there. It was...

1327
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:15,083
I just climbed in the wheel well of a
cargo plane, and I flew back to the U.S.

1328
01:09:15,206 --> 01:09:17,481
I went AWOL. It was...

1329
01:09:17,606 --> 01:09:19,278
Is your name even Drillbit?

1330
01:09:19,926 --> 01:09:21,041
Is my...

1331
01:09:22,086 --> 01:09:24,042
What? How can you ask me that?

1332
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,281
Is it?

1333
01:09:26,566 --> 01:09:30,479
No, it's... It's Alamo Taylor.

1334
01:09:33,926 --> 01:09:35,723
No. That's a lie, too.

1335
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:39,639
There I go, trying to impress
a bunch of kids again.

1336
01:09:41,726 --> 01:09:43,398
When are you gonna grow up?

1337
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:45,956
My real name is Bob Taylor.

1338
01:09:46,406 --> 01:09:48,442
Not Robert, just Bob.

1339
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,678
There, you satisfied?
And I didn't kill anyone with a drill bit.

1340
01:09:52,806 --> 01:09:54,478
Although when I was in high school,

1341
01:09:54,606 --> 01:09:56,961
I did puncture my pinky with a drill bit.

1342
01:09:57,246 --> 01:10:00,079
And everyone started calling me Drillbit,
making fun of me.

1343
01:10:00,206 --> 01:10:01,924
- Okay? And you can see the scar...
- No, get away.

1344
01:10:02,046 --> 01:10:03,638
...if you look closely right there.
Can you see?

1345
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:07,315
Look, Ryan, look, you can see it.
It's real. Look.

1346
01:10:07,446 --> 01:10:08,435
Can you see it in the light?

1347
01:10:08,566 --> 01:10:13,162
So you were just using us to take
our money and everything in my house?

1348
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:22,716
That's kind of an oversimplification.

1349
01:10:24,246 --> 01:10:26,043
I thought you cared about us.

1350
01:10:26,606 --> 01:10:28,881
I do. I just...

1351
01:10:30,086 --> 01:10:32,236
I thought you were my friend.

1352
01:10:33,406 --> 01:10:36,000
Get out, Drillbit,
and don't ever come back.

1353
01:10:41,286 --> 01:10:42,480
Leave!

1354
01:10:44,486 --> 01:10:45,521
I'm sorry.

1355
01:10:53,566 --> 01:10:54,555
Hello?

1356
01:10:54,686 --> 01:10:55,835
Hey. Yeah, look, I know...

1357
01:10:55,966 --> 01:10:57,558
I'm sorry, I know
I was supposed to meet you,

1358
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,961
but I'm just having a real terrible day.

1359
01:11:00,406 --> 01:11:01,555
Where are you?

1360
01:11:02,406 --> 01:11:06,194
Remember you said you had
that real self-destructive pattern

1361
01:11:06,326 --> 01:11:11,116
of always going out with guys
that were just real losers, just dirtbags?

1362
01:11:11,246 --> 01:11:13,077
Total zeros.

1363
01:11:13,206 --> 01:11:14,844
- Yes.
- Well.

1364
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:17,526
You might not be
out of the woods yet with that.

1365
01:11:17,726 --> 01:11:22,675
No, you said you were a doctor.
You're a doctor. You're not a doctor?

1366
01:11:22,806 --> 01:11:24,205
No, I'm not a doctor.

1367
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:27,682
I'm a homeless U.S. Army deserter.
I was...

1368
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:30,684
I'm not a teacher, but I'm at the school.
I'm trying to protect these kids.

1369
01:11:30,806 --> 01:11:33,400
What? What did you say
about homeless?

1370
01:11:34,246 --> 01:11:38,364
Like, metaphorically speaking
or in a box?

1371
01:11:41,406 --> 01:11:43,397
You got to let it out.

1372
01:11:43,726 --> 01:11:47,514
You got to just let it out. Just...

1373
01:11:52,966 --> 01:11:54,194
That's not it.

1374
01:11:54,406 --> 01:11:57,876
Drillbit? I mean, Bob. It's us, the guys.

1375
01:11:58,486 --> 01:12:01,398
- Pick up, Bob.
- Yeah, pick up, Drillbit.

1376
01:12:02,246 --> 01:12:03,201
Boys?

1377
01:12:03,326 --> 01:12:05,681
We just called to say
we're calling the cops on you,

1378
01:12:05,806 --> 01:12:09,355
and we hope you spend the rest
of your pathetic life in prison!

1379
01:12:09,486 --> 01:12:13,001
Now I see why people call you Drillbit.
Because you screw people!

1380
01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:15,879
You're a jackass and a dirtbag.

1381
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:18,476
And I want my bar mitzvah money back.

1382
01:12:18,606 --> 01:12:21,723
Oh, yeah,
and I'd like my walkie-talkie back. Over.

1383
01:12:27,766 --> 01:12:29,882
I tell you what,
l'll give you 1,500 for everything.

1384
01:12:30,006 --> 01:12:31,200
1,500? Come on, man.

1385
01:12:31,326 --> 01:12:33,282
This stuff holds
a lot of sentimental value.

1386
01:12:33,406 --> 01:12:35,636
- To who?
- To the people I stole it from.

1387
01:12:36,006 --> 01:12:37,325
I don't care about them. 1,500.

1388
01:12:37,446 --> 01:12:39,801
All right. Deal. What do I do?
Just back this thing up?

1389
01:12:39,926 --> 01:12:41,917
- Yeah, back it right up.
- All right.

1390
01:12:45,846 --> 01:12:47,404
How're you doing, Don?

1391
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:53,078
You got a real stupid laugh,
you know that, Don?

1392
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,078
How about you go ahead
and hop on out of that van here,

1393
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:57,844
so I can kick your ass again?

1394
01:12:57,966 --> 01:13:00,560
Sorry, but this haul's getting
returned to sender.

1395
01:13:00,686 --> 01:13:02,199
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it is, Don.

1396
01:13:02,326 --> 01:13:03,600
And l'll tell you another thing
that's gonna happen.

1397
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:05,239
This left foot is gonna go
on the right side

1398
01:13:05,366 --> 01:13:06,685
- of your face!
- Oh, give me a break, Drillbit.

1399
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:10,321
I know you and the Drillbit I know
isn't capable of really doing it!

1400
01:13:14,526 --> 01:13:15,481
Hoo-rah!

1401
01:13:16,886 --> 01:13:19,764
I'm giving you one more chance
to save this friendship!

1402
01:13:23,046 --> 01:13:25,514
Damn it! You ready for this, Don?

1403
01:13:26,846 --> 01:13:29,485
- No!
- Yeah!

1404
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:36,760
Polish that turd, Don!

1405
01:13:37,806 --> 01:13:38,795
Of course it was your fault!

1406
01:13:38,926 --> 01:13:40,359
You were home!
You should have stopped them!

1407
01:13:40,486 --> 01:13:43,125
Bear with me.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1408
01:13:43,246 --> 01:13:44,201
Oh, God.

1409
01:13:44,766 --> 01:13:46,643
Please don't scream.

1410
01:13:48,366 --> 01:13:49,765
What the hell?
I thought we were robbed!

1411
01:13:49,886 --> 01:13:50,841
We were!

1412
01:13:51,206 --> 01:13:53,674
We didn't get robbed!
We got rearranged!

1413
01:13:54,206 --> 01:13:56,162
You and your weirdo friends
have a marijuana party?

1414
01:13:56,286 --> 01:13:57,685
- No!
- Oh, honey.

1415
01:13:57,806 --> 01:14:00,081
- Punish him, Dad.
- Yeah, don't let him get away with this.

1416
01:14:00,206 --> 01:14:02,845
- Are you smoking pot?
- No. I'm really confused.

1417
01:14:02,966 --> 01:14:05,480
No, no, Wade.
Drillbit must have done it.

1418
01:14:06,126 --> 01:14:07,320
Who's Drillbit?

1419
01:14:07,806 --> 01:14:08,921
You tell me what's going on now, Wade.

1420
01:14:10,006 --> 01:14:12,122
Oh, God.
Who knows what might have happened?

1421
01:14:12,246 --> 01:14:14,885
This guy's a veteran!
How many people might he have killed?

1422
01:14:15,006 --> 01:14:16,724
Did anybody see "To Catch a Predator"
on Dateline?

1423
01:14:16,846 --> 01:14:18,359
- I watched that!
- I saw that, yeah.

1424
01:14:18,486 --> 01:14:20,477
It's where they set the booby trap
for the paedophiles.

1425
01:14:20,606 --> 01:14:22,278
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- A grandfather, a priest...

1426
01:14:22,406 --> 01:14:24,237
I mean, could you imagine it?
You think you're on a date,

1427
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:25,845
and then all of a sudden,
police are everywhere.

1428
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:27,319
- Yeah.
- My God, this guy knows where we live.

1429
01:14:27,446 --> 01:14:28,435
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1430
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:32,718
I think you'll be glad to know I gave
security camera footage of this Drillbit

1431
01:14:32,846 --> 01:14:35,440
to the police and they said
they'd be watching for him.

1432
01:14:35,566 --> 01:14:37,636
No, what the hell's the matter
with you guys?

1433
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:39,916
Are you mentally defective
or something?

1434
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:42,202
You got to understand,
Drillbit was around because

1435
01:14:42,326 --> 01:14:44,078
this psychopath over here
was gonna murder us!

1436
01:14:44,206 --> 01:14:46,401
I mean, Filkins is the real criminal!

1437
01:14:46,526 --> 01:14:47,754
Yes! He has a samurai sword

1438
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:49,444
- he has used on his other victims!
- All right...

1439
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:55,321
Sit down!

1440
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:58,439
Sit down!

1441
01:14:59,006 --> 01:15:00,234
Thank you very much.

1442
01:15:00,366 --> 01:15:01,481
Now, Terry.

1443
01:15:02,366 --> 01:15:04,561
Is there any truth to this?

1444
01:15:05,406 --> 01:15:06,326
Oh, yeah. All of it.

1445
01:15:06,326 --> 01:15:07,281
Oh, yeah. All of it.

1446
01:15:08,686 --> 01:15:12,565
I'm really a samurai warrior from
the 14th century sent to kill them.

1447
01:15:16,686 --> 01:15:18,039
He's cute.

1448
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:20,885
Okay, I hope I speak for everyone here

1449
01:15:21,006 --> 01:15:24,237
in saying that I feel
this issue is resolved.

1450
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:25,321
- Thank you. Okay, okay.
- All right?

1451
01:15:25,446 --> 01:15:26,959
Very good.
Thank you for coming in, folks.

1452
01:15:27,086 --> 01:15:28,883
- Thank you.
- All right, yeah.

1453
01:15:29,006 --> 01:15:30,962
- Hey, wasn't that fun?
- Hell, yeah.

1454
01:15:31,086 --> 01:15:32,235
- Oh, my goodness!
- Great.

1455
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:33,355
- You feel better now, honey?
- Terry, honey.

1456
01:15:33,486 --> 01:15:34,839
I did not know you were all alone.

1457
01:15:34,966 --> 01:15:36,957
We want to have you over to the house
for dinner, okay?

1458
01:15:37,086 --> 01:15:40,158
- That would be wonderful!
- Wade could use more friends.

1459
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:48,485
Give me one, please.

1460
01:15:52,286 --> 01:15:55,596
You're kind of a born loser. It's funny.

1461
01:15:56,286 --> 01:15:57,480
It's not funny.

1462
01:15:58,006 --> 01:15:59,405
It's funny to me.

1463
01:15:59,926 --> 01:16:02,599
Come on, don't jinx me. Don't jinx me.

1464
01:16:04,406 --> 01:16:07,284
500! Yes! Yes! I did it!

1465
01:16:07,406 --> 01:16:08,725
- I got it, man!
- Dude!

1466
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:10,040
Look at that! Yes!

1467
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:11,281
You got a ticket to Canada!

1468
01:16:11,406 --> 01:16:13,522
You better believe it! Come on, man!

1469
01:16:13,646 --> 01:16:15,762
Finally! Finally, I get one!

1470
01:16:15,926 --> 01:16:19,123
Come here, you!
This candy's on me! Put it down!

1471
01:16:19,446 --> 01:16:22,836
You got it! Well, maybe just get
one of them. Here. Here you go!

1472
01:16:35,486 --> 01:16:37,204
Okay, keep your eyes peeled.

1473
01:16:40,486 --> 01:16:43,000
- Do you see Filkins?
- No, but I see Brooke.

1474
01:16:43,646 --> 01:16:46,114
Gonna go for it. I'm gonna ask her out.

1475
01:16:46,886 --> 01:16:48,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

1476
01:16:48,446 --> 01:16:51,119
- You waited all this time. Why now?
- Why not?

1477
01:16:51,526 --> 01:16:53,835
My life sucks so badly,
even if she says no,

1478
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:55,922
it's not like l'll have very far to fall.

1479
01:17:01,006 --> 01:17:02,155
I don't know.

1480
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:06,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

1481
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:08,082
Look, I don't know how to do this.

1482
01:17:09,006 --> 01:17:12,078
In fact, I've been wanting to do this
for a while. I just didn't know

1483
01:17:12,206 --> 01:17:13,685
when would be a good time. I don't...

1484
01:17:13,806 --> 01:17:17,845
I didn't know if it would ever be
a good time. I mean, if I'd ever think...

1485
01:17:21,046 --> 01:17:22,320
It's okay, Brooke.

1486
01:17:24,846 --> 01:17:27,918
Yo, bro, I swear to God
those ain't my sodas,

1487
01:17:28,046 --> 01:17:30,799
but if you wanted to, say, hire me
or something, like a bodyguard,

1488
01:17:30,926 --> 01:17:34,635
I think maybe I could dedicate my life
to finding the real culprit.

1489
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:40,039
Wade, come on.
I'm okay with this, so let's just go.

1490
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,963
What'd you say, ho?

1491
01:17:42,326 --> 01:17:43,805
Okay, you know what?
What is your problem?

1492
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:45,837
Why don't you just leave them alone?

1493
01:17:45,966 --> 01:17:48,605
What are you gonna do, bro?
What are you gonna do?

1494
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:53,995
You aren't gonna do anything,
because you don't have any balls.

1495
01:17:55,326 --> 01:17:57,521
- Leave him alone!
- It's just not in you.

1496
01:18:02,526 --> 01:18:04,676
You see? Look at that.

1497
01:18:05,606 --> 01:18:06,561
Sackless!

1498
01:18:11,446 --> 01:18:14,882
Why do you even waste my time?
You're pathetic.

1499
01:18:20,246 --> 01:18:21,884
You all right, Wade?

1500
01:18:22,286 --> 01:18:24,197
- Don't worry about that guy.
- He's just insecure inside.

1501
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:26,556
- Get up. Let's get out of here.
- Wade?

1502
01:18:26,686 --> 01:18:28,085
Where are you going?

1503
01:18:28,206 --> 01:18:30,515
- T-Dog! Stop him!
- Fight! Fight!

1504
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,155
Come on, Wade!

1505
01:18:34,286 --> 01:18:36,561
L'll kick the crap out of you right now.
You know why?

1506
01:18:36,686 --> 01:18:39,405
Half because
everyone is sick of your garbage

1507
01:18:39,646 --> 01:18:42,080
and half because
of what you said to Brooke!

1508
01:18:43,806 --> 01:18:45,285
Do you think I'm dumb?

1509
01:18:46,446 --> 01:18:48,482
Trying to trick me
into getting myself in trouble?

1510
01:18:48,606 --> 01:18:51,245
Fine. Then we'll beat your face in
somewhere else.

1511
01:18:51,566 --> 01:18:53,477
- Anywhere. Go ahead. You name it.
- Okay, good.

1512
01:18:53,606 --> 01:18:57,963
Everybody! Everybody! I'm gonna kick
their asses tonight at my house!

1513
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:01,324
Everybody should come!
It's gonna be hilarious!

1514
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:03,278
Ultimate Geek Fighting!

1515
01:19:03,646 --> 01:19:07,764
Once you step on my property,
you're freaking trespassing, brother,

1516
01:19:07,886 --> 01:19:09,558
and I can do anything I want.

1517
01:19:09,686 --> 01:19:11,438
You're nothing but a pathetic wimp,

1518
01:19:11,566 --> 01:19:14,524
and everyone's gonna know
by the end of tonight, brother!

1519
01:19:14,646 --> 01:19:16,238
And I will see you there!

1520
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:24,998
What have I just done?

1521
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:26,964
That was awesome, man.

1522
01:19:27,366 --> 01:19:30,756
- Me and Emmit are gonna back you up.
- Oh, now it's "me and Emmit."

1523
01:19:30,886 --> 01:19:33,446
You've never been nice to me, Ryan,
and I've only been kind to you.

1524
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:35,682
And I've tried so hard
to make this friendship work,

1525
01:19:35,806 --> 01:19:38,923
but I am not going to die
for someone who won't die for me!

1526
01:19:39,126 --> 01:19:42,596
"Survival technique."
I renounce violence.

1527
01:19:43,046 --> 01:19:45,082
I have a future!

1528
01:19:46,206 --> 01:19:47,798
What do we do next?

1529
01:19:48,686 --> 01:19:50,802
Guess we'd better learn how to fight.

1530
01:19:52,646 --> 01:19:54,602
- Jump left, jump left.
- Get him, Bruce Lee.

1531
01:19:54,726 --> 01:19:55,954
- That's what I'm talking about!
- No, no, no, no.

1532
01:19:56,086 --> 01:19:57,565
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Come on!

1533
01:19:57,686 --> 01:19:58,801
Come on! Yes!

1534
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:00,877
This PowerBar's really working.

1535
01:20:01,246 --> 01:20:02,474
I feel stronger.

1536
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:04,840
I feel fatter.

1537
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,718
Well, what do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?

1538
01:20:06,846 --> 01:20:08,962
Come on. Do me this one favour.

1539
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,564
That was perfect!

1540
01:20:13,966 --> 01:20:16,526
All right. We need to learn
how to take a punch.

1541
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,077
You ready? Let me go first.

1542
01:20:20,006 --> 01:20:21,359
- All right?
- Okay.

1543
01:20:34,286 --> 01:20:36,038
Block out the pain.

1544
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,634
Remember what that douche bag
Drillbit taught us?

1545
01:20:38,766 --> 01:20:41,041
- Mind over pain!
- Okay.

1546
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:43,839
All right. Hit me in the chest.

1547
01:20:46,486 --> 01:20:47,441
Jeez!

1548
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:50,918
- Your knuckles are all bone!
- All right.

1549
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:52,843
We get to call how hard
the other guy hits.

1550
01:20:52,966 --> 01:20:56,356
All right. Ten being the hardest,
how hard do you want it?

1551
01:20:56,486 --> 01:20:59,000
Five. In the back. In the back.

1552
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:04,515
Oh, God!

1553
01:21:04,646 --> 01:21:08,161
Wonder what it feels like getting hit
in the middle of the forehead.

1554
01:21:10,806 --> 01:21:11,761
Jeez!

1555
01:21:13,526 --> 01:21:15,244
- All right, new rules!
- Okay.

1556
01:21:15,366 --> 01:21:16,515
I'm not gonna tell you
where I'm gonna hit you.

1557
01:21:16,646 --> 01:21:17,681
- No, I don't like that rule.
- No, it's good.

1558
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,558
- No, it's not good.
- It's good. It simulates a real fight.

1559
01:21:19,686 --> 01:21:21,358
- Trust me.
- All right, fine.

1560
01:21:25,846 --> 01:21:27,074
I can't see this coming.

1561
01:21:27,206 --> 01:21:28,764
There's no way Wade can hurt me.

1562
01:21:31,206 --> 01:21:32,195
Not balls!

1563
01:21:33,286 --> 01:21:34,765
You hit me in the nuts!

1564
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:39,718
Dear Mom, if you're reading this,

1565
01:21:40,526 --> 01:21:42,482
it's very possible that I'm dead.

1566
01:21:45,886 --> 01:21:49,799
If I don't survive, you should definitely
sue Emmit's family.

1567
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:53,636
P.S. Sorry I let your silver platter
get stolen.

1568
01:21:53,846 --> 01:21:56,041
My raps and rhymes will become
more valuable now.

1569
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:57,884
You're free to sell them
to Ghostface Killah.

1570
01:22:02,966 --> 01:22:05,355
Remember the plan.
Strike first and strike hard.

1571
01:22:05,486 --> 01:22:08,046
You go for the head. L'll go for the nuts.

1572
01:22:48,646 --> 01:22:51,399
It actually looks like a pretty cool party.

1573
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:55,440
Oh! Hey, guys.

1574
01:22:55,606 --> 01:23:00,122
So, how does it feel to know
that death is just a few moments away?

1575
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:03,081
- Where's Filkins?
- In the kitchen.

1576
01:23:05,926 --> 01:23:07,564
In case we don't make it,

1577
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:11,841
- I don't want to have any regrets.
- Yeah.

1578
01:23:13,526 --> 01:23:14,515
Face!

1579
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:20,036
I've already got the first hit
out of the way.

1580
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:21,315
Let's get some.

1581
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:38,916
Hey! Hey, hey. Everybody, everybody!

1582
01:23:39,246 --> 01:23:40,725
These kids actually came!

1583
01:23:40,846 --> 01:23:43,686
These are the Siamese queers
I've been telling you about!

1584
01:23:44,566 --> 01:23:47,126
They showed up!
They really are that dumb!

1585
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:48,885
I hate when he calls me that.

1586
01:23:49,006 --> 01:23:51,566
So we're gonna have a good time!
Because they...

1587
01:23:59,926 --> 01:24:00,915
It worked.

1588
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:04,157
- It's over!
- That was easy.

1589
01:24:04,326 --> 01:24:06,317
- We did it, we did it!
- We did.

1590
01:24:06,446 --> 01:24:10,405
Everybody, from ninth grade
to twelfth grade,

1591
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:13,319
I promise you,
his reign of tyranny is over!

1592
01:24:14,006 --> 01:24:17,157
I proclaim it!
He will never bother us again!

1593
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:20,525
And he's getting up!

1594
01:24:22,206 --> 01:24:23,639
You're dead.

1595
01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:25,324
And I'm in big trouble!

1596
01:24:38,806 --> 01:24:42,162
Catch me off guard?
You broke my stairs?

1597
01:24:42,806 --> 01:24:44,762
My father loved those stairs!

1598
01:24:49,366 --> 01:24:50,719
You blocking out the pain?

1599
01:24:50,846 --> 01:24:52,996
I thought I was for a second,
but I'm totally not.

1600
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:54,639
You want to play?

1601
01:24:55,446 --> 01:24:56,515
Let's play.

1602
01:25:12,366 --> 01:25:15,358
Get up, get up, get up! Come on, Ryan.

1603
01:25:17,286 --> 01:25:18,355
Hey, boys!

1604
01:25:22,606 --> 01:25:24,801
Yo, Jay, give me some murder music.

1605
01:25:25,766 --> 01:25:28,485
This just gets better and better.

1606
01:25:35,446 --> 01:25:36,765
All right!

1607
01:25:38,686 --> 01:25:40,517
Hey, yo, yo. Back off.

1608
01:25:40,686 --> 01:25:42,722
I want to fight both these bitches.

1609
01:25:42,966 --> 01:25:46,754
They're yours, Filk!
They're yours, baby! Here we go.

1610
01:25:46,886 --> 01:25:48,683
- You're the bitch!
- Huh?

1611
01:25:53,766 --> 01:25:55,119
That's right!

1612
01:25:56,646 --> 01:25:57,681
What the...

1613
01:25:59,726 --> 01:26:01,956
- Emmit's got game!
- Oh, yeah!

1614
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,917
- Good one, Ron!
- Come on!

1615
01:26:08,646 --> 01:26:10,477
Bear hug!

1616
01:26:10,606 --> 01:26:11,755
- Come on!
- Oh!

1617
01:26:21,886 --> 01:26:25,083
I have reach! I have reach!

1618
01:26:27,006 --> 01:26:30,282
Come on, Wade!
You're like Rocky! Get back out there!

1619
01:26:32,006 --> 01:26:35,555
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
- You're not gonna hurt me any more?

1620
01:26:35,846 --> 01:26:38,838
I won't hurt you! You should let go!
I can't breathe, Ryan, can't breathe!

1621
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:42,276
L'll let you go.
Not gonna hurt me any more, are...

1622
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:46,485
- I have reach!
- No! Wade!

1623
01:26:48,886 --> 01:26:50,683
Hey! Hey, there. Hey...

1624
01:26:52,446 --> 01:26:53,799
- Didn't hurt!
- Really?

1625
01:26:53,926 --> 01:26:54,915
Yeah.

1626
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:56,764
Okay, that did.

1627
01:26:59,286 --> 01:27:00,765
Let that kid go.

1628
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:08,523
Private Drillbit Taylor reporting for duty!

1629
01:27:09,046 --> 01:27:10,877
- Hoo-rah.
- You came back?

1630
01:27:11,046 --> 01:27:13,606
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you even doing here?

1631
01:27:14,566 --> 01:27:16,557
What, you need more money
from these geeks?

1632
01:27:16,686 --> 01:27:19,439
No. But this fight is over!

1633
01:27:20,086 --> 01:27:22,236
You hear me? Abierto!

1634
01:27:24,446 --> 01:27:25,401
Done.

1635
01:27:27,006 --> 01:27:29,839
It's over, people! Pack it up! Go home!

1636
01:27:30,126 --> 01:27:35,519
Look. You're a young man. You got...
You got a crazy look in your eye.

1637
01:27:36,886 --> 01:27:38,877
And it's really freaking me out right now.

1638
01:27:43,086 --> 01:27:44,201
Nice punch.

1639
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:48,357
I try to be reasonable,
but I got to tell you,

1640
01:27:48,606 --> 01:27:53,680
these boys hired me as their bodyguard
and I will protect them!

1641
01:27:58,046 --> 01:27:59,479
Want to hear something crazy?

1642
01:27:59,606 --> 01:28:01,915
Deep inside you,
I know there's a good kid.

1643
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:07,882
God damn it,
I'm sick of getting hit by this kid.

1644
01:28:08,086 --> 01:28:09,644
Come on, Drillbit. Kick his ass.

1645
01:28:09,766 --> 01:28:13,475
- I can't! He's a minor!
- No, he's not. He's 18.

1646
01:28:14,446 --> 01:28:16,277
You're 18?

1647
01:28:22,126 --> 01:28:23,718
That's it.

1648
01:28:32,926 --> 01:28:33,881
Drillbit!

1649
01:28:35,486 --> 01:28:36,680
How old are you?

1650
01:28:36,806 --> 01:28:39,445
Okay! All right, I'm 17. I'm a minor.

1651
01:28:39,566 --> 01:28:40,601
- My mom drives me to school.
- Come on!

1652
01:28:40,726 --> 01:28:41,920
I swear to God!

1653
01:28:42,406 --> 01:28:43,634
That was awesome.

1654
01:28:43,766 --> 01:28:46,121
Man, Drillbit, you're badass.

1655
01:28:46,766 --> 01:28:48,802
I don't think I could do that again.

1656
01:28:49,086 --> 01:28:50,804
It's weird. I guess it's like

1657
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:53,759
when a mother
lifts an automobile off a child.

1658
01:28:53,886 --> 01:28:55,478
- Yeah.
- You just get that burst of strength.

1659
01:28:55,606 --> 01:28:57,085
That's the only way I can explain it.

1660
01:28:57,206 --> 01:28:59,959
Adrenaline. That's the word for it.

1661
01:29:00,086 --> 01:29:03,158
My hands are...
My hands are still shaking.

1662
01:29:03,726 --> 01:29:06,524
- Thanks for coming back.
- You kidding me? I had to do it.

1663
01:29:06,646 --> 01:29:08,477
I'm not gonna go AWOL on you boys.

1664
01:29:08,606 --> 01:29:10,278
I made that mistake one...

1665
01:29:10,526 --> 01:29:14,121
Crap on a shit sandwich!
I'm out of here, boys! Adiós!

1666
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:16,160
Bye, Drillbit!

1667
01:29:16,366 --> 01:29:17,401
Hey, fags!

1668
01:29:19,406 --> 01:29:21,044
This ain't over!

1669
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:33,363
- He feels no pain.
- Whoa.

1670
01:29:37,046 --> 01:29:38,399
Was that my pinky?

1671
01:29:42,046 --> 01:29:44,321
- Are you okay?
- My finger!

1672
01:29:44,446 --> 01:29:45,435
You okay?

1673
01:29:45,566 --> 01:29:47,158
- I'm so sorry.
- Why did I catch a sword?

1674
01:29:47,286 --> 01:29:48,639
- I lost it. No, no.
- Let me see it. Let me see it.

1675
01:29:48,766 --> 01:29:52,042
- I lost it.
- Let me see it. Let me see it.

1676
01:29:52,206 --> 01:29:53,924
No, it's okay. I'm blocking the pain.

1677
01:29:54,046 --> 01:29:56,321
I can't block this pain.
Get some ice for me.

1678
01:29:56,446 --> 01:29:57,765
It's not bad. Here, help me find it

1679
01:29:57,886 --> 01:29:59,035
- before the ants get it.
- Where'd you last see it?

1680
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:00,963
- Look in the grass.
- My dad, yo, just don't tell my dad!

1681
01:30:01,086 --> 01:30:02,235
Help me, guys!
Find it before a rat gets it!

1682
01:30:02,366 --> 01:30:03,515
See it? Look over there.

1683
01:30:03,646 --> 01:30:04,715
- Is that it?
- Where?

1684
01:30:04,846 --> 01:30:06,564
Hey, guys, I found it!

1685
01:30:08,606 --> 01:30:09,800
No!

1686
01:30:10,726 --> 01:30:11,795
We found it.

1687
01:30:13,486 --> 01:30:14,441
Get me some ice.

1688
01:30:14,566 --> 01:30:15,555
- Ice!
- Ice!

1689
01:30:15,686 --> 01:30:16,675
Margarita all right?

1690
01:30:16,806 --> 01:30:18,444
Oh, my God.

1691
01:30:18,566 --> 01:30:19,555
Bro!

1692
01:30:19,686 --> 01:30:21,039
Come on, buddy.
We got to get you to a hospital.

1693
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,361
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go.

1694
01:30:23,486 --> 01:30:25,124
It's gonna be okay.

1695
01:30:25,246 --> 01:30:28,397
Congratulations, boys.
You just caught the great Bob Taylor.

1696
01:30:28,526 --> 01:30:30,562
Fantastic. No alcohol in the car, sir.

1697
01:30:30,686 --> 01:30:34,076
Oh, yeah.
Well, let me get the finger out. Yeah.

1698
01:30:36,246 --> 01:30:37,395
Hoo-rah.

1699
01:30:39,886 --> 01:30:42,002
- Yo, dudes, that was awesome!
- Thanks, man.

1700
01:30:42,126 --> 01:30:44,082
Man, you have no idea how long kids
have been waiting to do that.

1701
01:30:44,206 --> 01:30:45,525
- Thanks.
- Dude, this is gonna be blogged,

1702
01:30:45,646 --> 01:30:46,635
for sure!

1703
01:30:46,766 --> 01:30:49,326
I am so glad
I did not go to my sister's birthday party!

1704
01:30:50,246 --> 01:30:51,201
Hey.

1705
01:30:51,326 --> 01:30:52,759
He was amazing.

1706
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:55,038
You know,
Terry's just always been crazy.

1707
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:57,122
You know, he's threatened me
with his sword all the time.

1708
01:30:57,246 --> 01:30:58,964
I'm just tired of being scared, you know?

1709
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:01,441
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1710
01:31:04,286 --> 01:31:07,915
When the adrenaline rush passes,
I'm gonna be in a lot more pain.

1711
01:31:09,566 --> 01:31:12,319
I don't want you to think I'm the kind of
guy who tries to impress girls

1712
01:31:12,446 --> 01:31:15,324
with violence,
but that was kind of for you.

1713
01:31:16,926 --> 01:31:19,440
That was very brave of you.

1714
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:32,238
You know, Emmit,
I can't believe I'm saying this...

1715
01:31:33,686 --> 01:31:37,599
You, my friend, are one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

1716
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:39,682
You have no idea how scared I was.

1717
01:31:39,806 --> 01:31:42,878
All right. Now, let's go get
something to eat. I'm starving.

1718
01:31:46,606 --> 01:31:49,643
Dear Wade, Ryan and little, tiny Emmit.

1719
01:31:49,766 --> 01:31:52,041
Thanks for sending the Cap'n Crunch.

1720
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:54,117
Suddenly, I'm very popular in here.

1721
01:31:54,246 --> 01:31:58,603
Hey, Bob. Give me some of that Cap'n
Crunch or l'll stab you in the shower.

1722
01:32:00,646 --> 01:32:01,761
Just kidding.

1723
01:32:04,206 --> 01:32:06,720
I was glad to read
in your last correspondence

1724
01:32:06,846 --> 01:32:10,077
that Filkins was shipped off
back to Hong Kong

1725
01:32:10,206 --> 01:32:13,676
to be with his parents for breaking
so many underage drinking laws.

1726
01:32:14,206 --> 01:32:14,406
Now maybe high school can be
what you want it to be

1727
01:32:14,406 --> 01:32:17,478
Now maybe high school can be
what you want it to be

1728
01:32:17,606 --> 01:32:19,403
- instead of sucking rat nads.
- Oh, yeah.

1729
01:32:20,526 --> 01:32:21,595
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1730
01:32:22,246 --> 01:32:25,443
As for me, every time I look
at where my pinky used to be,

1731
01:32:25,686 --> 01:32:28,519
I think of you boys
and our battles together.

1732
01:32:28,966 --> 01:32:30,240
It's kind of cool.

1733
01:32:30,686 --> 01:32:32,677
Luckily, they have
a work release programme,

1734
01:32:32,806 --> 01:32:35,001
and they say I should
be able to land a job,

1735
01:32:35,126 --> 01:32:36,844
which excites me a great deal.

1736
01:32:36,966 --> 01:32:39,161
And speaking of exciting me
a great deal,

1737
01:32:39,286 --> 01:32:41,436
Miss Zachey and I
have been in contact.

1738
01:32:41,606 --> 01:32:45,281
I don't know why women dig
guys in prison, but they really do.

1739
01:32:45,406 --> 01:32:49,115
On top of that, all I can say is,
I miss you guys

1740
01:32:49,246 --> 01:32:50,884
and will see you when I get out.

1741
01:32:51,006 --> 01:32:54,681
Which, thanks to the currently lenient
nature of the United States Army

1742
01:32:54,806 --> 01:32:57,274
deserting laws is in two days from now,

1743
01:32:57,446 --> 01:33:00,518
officially satisfying
my three-week sentence.

1744
01:33:00,966 --> 01:33:03,036
- Your brother, Bob Taylor.
- See you, Drillbit.

1745
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:05,839
- AKA Drillbit.
- Later, bro.

1746
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:08,998
AKA, Alamo Taylor.

1747
01:33:09,526 --> 01:33:11,801
I still like the sound of that.

1748
01:33:14,566 --> 01:33:16,284
There you are!

1749
01:33:17,366 --> 01:33:18,799
- Drillbit!
- Come on.

1750
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,154
- There he is.
- He's a free man.

1751
01:33:20,286 --> 01:33:21,958
Come on, get in here!
Come here! Fall in!

1752
01:33:22,086 --> 01:33:24,281
- He's a free man!
- Give me a hug!

1753
01:33:24,406 --> 01:33:26,158
- God.
- Give me a hug. Yeah.

1754
01:33:26,486 --> 01:33:28,795
Well, that's gonna keep me smiling
all day, huh?

1755
01:33:28,926 --> 01:33:30,359
Yeah, that's my buddy, Drillbit.

1756
01:33:30,486 --> 01:33:31,965
He's a cool guy.
We're in a fight right now.

1757
01:33:32,086 --> 01:33:33,439
This has been the longest
three weeks of my life.

1758
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:34,885
I missed you, too.

1759
01:33:35,566 --> 01:33:37,284
- Feels good.
- You get shanked in jail?

1760
01:33:37,406 --> 01:33:38,246
- It wasn't that bad.
- Come on, let's go.

1761
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:39,201
- It wasn't that bad.
- Come on, let's go.

1762
01:33:39,326 --> 01:33:41,886
You know, the guy in the next cell taught
me some Spanish.

1763
01:33:42,006 --> 01:33:45,123
Did you know abierto means "open"?
