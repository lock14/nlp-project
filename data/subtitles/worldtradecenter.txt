00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,668
To be honest, l miss the bus terminal.

Excuse me.

79
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,680
Hey, something´s up.

80
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,650
<i>We have unconfirmed reports
this morning</i>

81
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:26,120
<i>that a plane has crashed into one of
the towers of the World Trade Center.</i>

82
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,554
<i>-CNN Center right now...
-Holy shit.</i>

83
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:30,455
<i>...work on this story, calling our sources</i>

84
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,256
<i>and trying to figure out
exactly what happened, but, clearly,</i>

85
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:36,457
<i>something relatively devastating
happening this morning there.</i>

86
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:39,729
<i>We´re going to join
another one of our New York affiliates</i>

87
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:40,996
<i>for their live coverage.</i>

88
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:46,303
<i>Here at the top of this tower, there´s
a huge, gaping hole, flames still inside.</i>

89
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,671
Can you believe this?

90
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:50,871
What schmuck would fly a plane
into the Trade Center?

91
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:54,179
Maybe they ran out of gas or something.

92
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:57,185
Yeah, Colovito. Right.

93
00:09:57,287 --> 00:10:00,381
Maybe some jerk-off forgot
which lever to pull on his twin-engine.

94
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,424
That´s not a small plane.

95
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:05,153
Hell, no.

96
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,389
All right, listen up!

97
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,189
Let me have your attention here!

98
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,035
They´re telling us it´s a commuter plane.

99
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:16,670
Tower One is being evacuated
as a precaution.

100
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:19,505
They´ve asked us to send
a team down to assist.

101
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:20,598
Sergeant McLoughlin.

102
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,268

<i>Command post on the air?
Command post.</i>

117
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:58,173
<i>Field command post. Are there any
injuries going to any particular hospital?</i>

118
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:02,576
<i>Chief on the air. Go ahead.</i>

119
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:06,789
Come on, everybody. Off the bus.
Get off the bus. Step this way.

120
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:10,289
l´m gonna cut across
Bleecker to Seventh. Stay close.

121
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:11,485
You got it.

<i>Central. Mobilization point

123
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:22,165
<i>That was to evacuate One Police Plaza</i>

124
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:25,833
<i>at the Gracie Mansion, the Municipal
Building, and any potential targets.</i>

125
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,705
<i>Who is advising this?</i>

126
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,506
<i>Central units, the mobilization point
is now South and Pike.</i>

127
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,548
Yeah. No, no, l got it.

128
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,914
Hey, guys, you won´t believe this!

129
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:42,514
My wife says the other one got hit,
the other tower.

130
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,388
How the hell did the other tower get hit?

131
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,655
<i>She was listening to HOT 97
and they said it.</i>

132
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:50,062
<i>What? Who gets their news
from HOT 97?</i>

133
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,194
-l told you it was no damn private plane.
-No, l got it.

134
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:57,639
What special equipment
we got down there?

135
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:02,070
-What?
-We´re prepared for everything.

136
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:06,945
Car bombs, chemical, biological,
an attack from the top.

137
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:12,078
But not this. Not for something this sie.

138
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:14,813
There´s no plan. We didn´t make it.

139
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:17,620
<i>Only emergency transmissions
on this frequency.</i>

140
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,119
<i>All right, all emergency personnel</i>

141

<i>respond to Vesey and West.</i>

142
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:26,259
<i>All emergency service units,
please go to Vesey and West.</i>

143
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:29,365
There could be 50,
60,000 people in there.

144
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:45,518
<i>Units on West Street to use caution.</i>

145
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:48,056
<i>Debris is falling from the building
on West Street.</i>

146
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,988
Hey! Looks like
Tower Two did take a hit.

147
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:52,928
What did l tell you?

148
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:56,355
No, no, that´s the smoke blowing over
from Tower One.

149
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:59,492
All right, that´s enough.
Everybody sit down. Now!

150
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,270
Yo, Dom, let me see your phone
for a sec, yeah?

151
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,665
Hey, let me see your phone.
l got to call Allison.

152
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,072
lt´s not working!

153
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,242
Nothing´s going through.

154
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:16,346
<i>Emergency service vehicles
are also responding.</i>

155
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:21,386
Hey, take it easy, will you? Jesus!

156
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:25,586
-This is gonna be a bitch.
-Relax.

157
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:27,663
Well, l´m just saying
that it looks like it´s gonna...

158
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,891
You think they´re bringing you
down there to scratch your ass?

159
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,591
McLoughlin will tell you what to do.

160
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:32,725
Why the Sarge?

161
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:34,700
He was Emergency Services
at the Trade Tower.

162
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:37,500
<i>He´s one of the guys who came up
with a plan after the attack in ´93.</i>

163
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,768
Anybody knows what to do down there,
it´s him.

164
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:41,537
<i>Command to Division One.</i>

165
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:44,369
<i>Does anyone over
in Tower One hear me?</i>

166
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:47,310
<i>Okay, make the turn on Broadway.</i>

167
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,977
<i>Go down West Broadway.
We´ll meet you outside Five.</i>

168
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:51,417
You got it.

<i>Send everything you got
to the World Trade Center now.</i>

170
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,761
We got to get that building evacuated!

171
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,197
<i>Which tower?
Which tower are we responding to?</i>

172
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:41,759
-l got to get a team to go up!
-l´ll check in with headquarters.

173
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:44,965
<i>Roll every available ambulance you got
to this position.</i>

174
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:50,672
<i>Fire out on the north side.</i>

175
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,645
<i>They´re now coming out
of the west side</i>

176
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:53,716
<i>of the World Trade Center.</i>

177
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,816
All right, everybody stay here. l´m gonna
find out what the hell´s going on.

178
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:33,889
Yes, sir.

179
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:49,770
Oh, my God.

180
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:02,975
Nothing´s gonna help them.

181
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,576
No, we´ll get up there.

182
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,985
How are you gonna save people
that high up? lt´s impossible.

183
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,614
We got to try.

184
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:09,850
Sarge!

185
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,259
Officer? Officer?

186
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,997
The daycare center.
There´s kids there. Over there.

187
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:21,832
Hey, Sarge! There´s kids in the...

188
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:25,305
Yeah, at the daycare at Five.
l know, they got them out.

189
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,470
-Okay, listen up. Where´s Kassimatis?
-He´s looking for you, Sarge.

190
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,444
We got to evacuate the Tower.

191
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:35,579
Who knows how to use a Scott Pak?
And don´t give me any PBA bullshit.

192
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:38,620
Hey, Sarge, to tell you the truth,
l haven´t used one in like four years.

193
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,416
Look, what did l just say?

194
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:42,421
Who´s coming?

195
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,026
Step forward.

196
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:50,525
l got it, Sarge.

197
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,060
l´ll go.

198
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,407
l´m with you, Sarge.

199
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:05,273
All right.

200
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:07,374
All right, we got a team.

201
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:10,714
We´re headed into Building Five.
The rest of you wait for Kassimatis.

202
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,617
Follow me. Stay together.

203
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,499
-Jimeno.
-Sarge.

204
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:29,230
Take everyone´s memo books,
nightsticks, hats. They´re useless here.

205
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,436
Put them in the Suburban.
lt´s over on Church and Vesey.

206
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,272
And meet us back at the police desk
in the lobby of Five. You got it?

207
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:36,970
Which one´s Five?

208
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:38,779
There´s two towers.

209
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:42,416
North tower is One. South tower is Two.

210
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:45,282
Right behind it, there´s Five,
right in front of us,

211
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:46,685
which is where the police desk is.

212
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,757
Take the alley. Hurry up. Hey!

213
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,356
Let´s go.

214
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:02,530
They´re all dying!

215
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,869
They´re all dying!

216
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,317
Grab those bottles.

217
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:21,616
Get the helmets.

218
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,625
<i>People trapped at 87th and 89th floors.</i>

219
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:27,855
<i>10-4. They´re getting a TVpicture
with numerous injuries.</i>

220
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:29,727
<i>Numerous injuries out there.</i>

221
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:33,331
Okay, turn them on.
Double check. Test them.

222
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,971
Massi? Anything more here?
Helmets? Scott Paks?

223
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:41,271
No, Sarge. Try the E room
near the truck docks in the basement.

224
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:42,708
Jimmy Lynch is down there.

225
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:46,542
Thanks.

226
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,044
Okay, there´s more stuff down on B-1 ,
the truck docks.

227
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:52,654
We´ll drop down to the Concourse,
go around One to Two,

228
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:54,655
and there´s some stairs there.

229
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:58,255
Keep your eyes open. Follow me.
Don´t get separated, okay?

230
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,419
Well, Sarge, we got plenty here.

231
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:01,155
Hundred and ten floors. Fire with fuel.

232
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:03,858
We´re gonna be using up bottles.
We need them.

233
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,067
Sarge, you won´t believe this.

234
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,870
Your Suburban on Church? lt´s gone.
Roof smashed in.

235
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:18,075
Stay together and stay focused.

236
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,807
-Yo, Dom, where we going?
-Sarge wants more stuff.

237
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,076
-What?
-Don´t worry about it.

238
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:23,879
He knows what he´s doing.

239
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:25,678
What the...

240
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:27,187
Don´t think. Keep moving.

241
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,882
Jesus, Sarge, we got to get up there.

242
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:31,789
You aren´t rescuing anybody
if you can´t breathe, Rodrigues.

243
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,327
Stay focused.

244
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,204
This way.

245
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,136
Where´s the fire?

246
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,783
Now you´re talking.
Got the BT dogs up in here.

247
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:38,724
What´s up, Sarge?
Sarge, l´m telling you we got to get up.

248
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:40,318
There´s a ton of people stuck up there.

249
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,920
-We´re going up.
-Yeah? l gotta go with you.

250
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,966
-Sure, Chris. We can use you.
-Yeah?

251
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,399
We need more equipment.
Get a tank on.

252
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:48,663
A-Rod!

253
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:50,299
Yo, what´s up, Chris?

254
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:53,500
Yo, what happened to your eye, man?
What happened to your eye?

255
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:54,598
l was carrying this woman out,

256
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,200
something whacked me
in the freaking head.

257
00:20:56,312 --> 00:20:58,405
-She okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, l got her clear.

258
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:01,950
Hey, hey, Sarge, we ain´t gonna find
any equipment left in One.

259
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:05,251
-Coming through. Coming through.
-Excuse us. Thanks a lot.

260
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:08,789
Lynch has got gear down
at the B-1 truck docks next to Two.

261
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:11,052
There´s a staircase right over there
at Ben & Jerry´s.

262
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,128
l heard they were
evacuating Two, Sarge.

263
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:15,220
Must have caught fire from One.

264
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:17,322
l heard Two got hit,
that there was a second plane.

265
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:20,834
No, Fields just said one plane,
Tower One. Now, stay together.

266
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:25,838
You see the TV?
There´s a big fire up there.

267
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:27,465
There ain´t no TVs down here.

268
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:30,943
You guys hear about the Pentagon?
lt got hit. A missile or something.

269
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:33,014
lsrael? lt´s gone. lt´s nuked.

00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:37,044
-Yo, Chris.
-Yeah.

272
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:39,553
-Nice timing on that transfer.
-Yeah, no kidding, right?

273
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,020
-Jimeno?
-Yeah.

l don´t think l´m hurt, but l can´t move.

343
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,037
l got some movement here.

344
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:46,046
8-13!

345
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:48,786
PAPD!

346
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:52,352
Officers Jimeno, Peulo

347
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:55,059
and McLoughlin are down.

348
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,729
We´re trapped on the Concourse level

349
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:02,195
between Towers One and Two.

350
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:05,869
We´re trapped near
freight elevator Five.

351
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:09,309
-Oh, thank God.
-lt goes down to the B-1 truck dock.

352
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:11,402
Yeah, here you go. Get some air.

353
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:13,981
Get some air. Some fresh air.

354
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:18,720
You´re okay, Willy. You´re okay.

355
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:20,015
Got any radio?

356
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:21,789
Here you go.

357
00:28:22,257 --> 00:28:25,784
No, mine´s smashed. lt´s not working.

358
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:30,658
All my stuff on the left side is buried.
The mike´s gone.

359
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,869
You got to get this...
You got to get this off of me.

360
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:41,537
lt´s good to see you, Dom.

361
00:28:43,178 --> 00:28:44,770
Good to see you, Willy.

362
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:48,312
-You okay? You good?
-Yeah, l´m good.

363
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,815
l´m going to get you out.
Don´t worry about it.

364
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,012
l´m gonna get you out, Willy.

365
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:54,588
lt´s working, Sarge!

366
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:57,720
Dom´s got us covered!

367
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,385
Good. That´s good.

368
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:04,799
How´d you know to run in here, Sarge?

369
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:09,333
The elevator shaft´s
the strongest part of the building.

370
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:11,172
Oh, Jesus.

371
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:14,772
How did this happen, Willy?

372
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:21,649
l´m gonna take care of you.

373
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,917
l´m gonna get you out, buddy.

374
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:34,725
Looks like there´s light! Maybe some air!

375
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:38,291
l´d say about 20 feet up!

376
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,134
Hey!

377
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:43,070
8-13!

378
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:45,130
Officers down!

379
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:48,309
Hey!

380
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,316
-You ready?
-Come on.

381
00:30:06,228 --> 00:30:07,525
Come on, Dom!

382
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,193
Oh, Jesus.

383
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:17,232
l can´t get this off him by myself, Sarge.

384
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:21,539
Maybe l should go up and get some help
and then come back for you guys.

385
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:25,238
No! No! You´re gonna get him out!

386
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,412
You´re gonna get him out!

387
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,487
All right.

388
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:41,260
Here we go, Willy.

389
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:43,188
Come on!

390
00:30:55,544 --> 00:30:57,307
l can´t get you out, Willy.

391
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:00,240
Come on, Dom.

392
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:04,341
Don´t leave us here.

393
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:08,719
Do me a favor.

394
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:13,527
You can do it. l know you can do it.

395
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:23,797
All right.

396
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:26,772
l´m going to get you out, Willy. All right?

397
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:31,873
l´ll get you out. Yeah, l´ll get you out.
All right.

398
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:30,234
Dom?

399
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:33,771
Dom?

400
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:40,178
l´m hurt.

401
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:48,288
Dom, it´s me, Willy.

402
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,088
Look at me.

403
00:32:52,727 --> 00:32:54,092
Stay awake.

404
00:32:57,232 --> 00:32:59,029
Can l get a 3-8, Sarge?

405
00:33:01,837 --> 00:33:04,806
Yeah, Dom. You take a break.

406
00:33:09,377 --> 00:33:11,174
l´m dying, Willy.

407
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:15,408
No. No, you´re not. Dom, stop this.

408
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:21,217
Don´t forget
l really tried to save you guys.

409
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:34,328
l love you, Willy.

410
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:38,402
l love you, too, Dom.

411
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:02,594
Dom´s gone.

412
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:09,160
Dom´s gone!

413
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:11,802
l know.

414
00:34:22,484 --> 00:34:23,781
Jimeno,

415
00:34:25,086 --> 00:34:26,755
can you still see the light?

416
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:27,187
can you still see the light?

417
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,148
Yeah.

418
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,785
Yeah!

419
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:34,925
How far up?

420
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:40,928
l don´t know. Maybe 20 feet up.
There´s still stuff in the way.

421
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:43,864
What else do you see?

422
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:47,475
Beams. Plaster. Nothing.

423
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,578
<i>lt is with deep sadness and regret</i>

424
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:31,652
<i>that l have to advise you
that two hijacked planes</i>

425
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:34,287
<i>have crashed into the Twin Towers
of the World Trade Center...</i>

426
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:36,914
<i>...from what remains
of the World Trade Center for 9:00.</i>

427
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,960
<i>One airplane crashed into
World Trade Center Two.</i>

428
00:35:40,061 --> 00:35:42,962
<i>About 1 5 minutes later, an airplane
crashed into the second one.</i>

429
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:45,794
<i>About an hour later,
both of them collapsed.</i>

430
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:20,434
<i>Associated Press is reporting
that a plane or helicopter</i>

431
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:24,528
<i>crashed at the Pentagon,
and the Pentagon is being evacuated.</i>

432
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,599
<i>Whether that fire is in the building itself
or outside, we have not yet confirmed.</i>

433
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:32,173
<i>This is a live picture of the Pentagon</i>

434
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,683
<i>and an Associated Press reporter says
he could see the tail of a large airliner</i>

435
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:38,753
<i>as it plowed into the Pentagon.</i>

436
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:40,718
<i>And that fire there in Washington
continues to burn.</i>

437
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:41,948
Bastards!

438
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:49,394
<i>...just a few minutes after that,
it wasn´t very long,</i>

439
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:54,561
<i>you will see, it happened again.
The second tower came tumbling down.</i>

440
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,003
<i>That was the first tower collapse
that we just saw.</i>

441
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,672
<i>This is the collapse
of the second tower.</i>

442
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:06,236
<i>And so now, as we stand here,
both towers...</i>

443
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:09,181
<i>The tops of both towers are gone.</i>

444
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:10,308
Allison, let´s sit outside.

445
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:14,855
<i>Behind somewhere that plume of smoke
that continues to rise over the...</i>

446
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:17,056
He´s probably still at the bus terminal.

447
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:21,356
<i>What is left of those buildings,
we cannot tell you.</i>

448
00:37:22,564 --> 00:37:23,553
<i>We cannot tell you.</i>

449
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:25,826
<i>-Allison.
-Jerry.</i>

450
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:29,065
Al, l´m looking at the Tunnel.

451
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,498
There´s no one there.

452
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,633
<i>No Port Authorities there.</i>

453
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:38,244
Al, l don´t...

454
00:37:40,782 --> 00:37:42,579
l guess they got called in.

455
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,711
<i>Can you get someone to drive you?</i>

456
00:37:48,823 --> 00:37:51,348
<i>-Allison?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

457
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:56,496
<i>Okay, l´ll see you at home
in half an hour.</i>

458
00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:59,126
l´ll call Mom and Dad.

459
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:03,704
Okay.

460
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:07,168
We got to pick up Bianca.

461
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:11,410
<i>Both towers came down,
trapping thousands</i>

462
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:13,538
<i>and thousands of people inside.</i>

463
00:38:13,648 --> 00:38:15,445
<i>We do not know the numbers yet,</i>

464
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,953
<i>but we do know thousands of people
work inside those buildings.</i>

465
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:22,181
<i>That... The buildings are gone.</i>

466
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,225
<i>There are reports
that hundreds and hundreds</i>

467
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:28,352
<i>of fire and police and rescue crews</i>

468
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,190
<i>are missing or unaccounted for.</i>

469
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:35,565
<i>Officials seem simply stunned
by the scale of the losses...</i>

470
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,730
They keep showing the same thing
over and over and over.

471
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,068
Jay´s there.

472
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:43,144
They must have called in
every company in the city.

473
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:45,041
He would have been there early.

474
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:47,114
Yeah, John, too, probably.

475
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:49,875
He knows those buildings so well.

476
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:53,314
<i>They´ve seen something
no one has ever seen before.</i>

477
00:38:53,421 --> 00:38:54,945
<i>One man who came by said</i>

478
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:56,887
<i>he had seen this building come down.</i>

479
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:59,459
<i>lt looked as though it was imploding.</i>

480
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:04,726
<i>This was complete chaos and utter hell
that has come to Lower Manhattan.</i>

481
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:08,232
Oh, my God.

482
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:12,336
Judy. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look.

483
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:16,702
They evacuated those buildings.
All right?

484
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:20,275
l´m sure most everybody got out.
They´re fine.

485
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:24,213
<i>ln the ´93 attack,
John said everybody got out real quick.</i>

486
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,981
<i>God. ln ´93,
the buildings didn´t fall down.</i>

487
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,950
All right, well,
l´m going to call everybody and cancel.

488
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:36,019
A Den Mothers meeting right now
sounds pretty dumb, right?

489
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:45,039
l keep looking for John.

490
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:47,736
There´s so many policemen
running around.

491
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,537
Maybe l´ll see him.

492
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:01,616
-Judy.
-Yeah?

493
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:21,876
Judy...

494
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,678
-They´re here to tell us they´re dead.
-No.

495
00:40:26,247 --> 00:40:28,374
No, they´re not. They´re not.

496
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:44,722
-Hey, Judy. Jay...
-No. No.

497
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:47,357
Look, we know he´s alive. All right?

498
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:51,228
They know where he is.
They´re communicating with him.

499
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:52,967
He´s alive?

500
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:55,872
Yes. Yeah, we´re gonna go
down there now and help out.

501
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,604
-Oh, thank God.
-Yes!

502
00:40:59,747 --> 00:41:01,305
There you go.

503
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,179
-Thank God. Oh, my God.
-There you go.

504
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:04,808
Oh, that´s good.

505
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,118
-That´s good.
-Thank you, God.

506
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,127
PAPD.

507
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:16,193
8-13.

508
00:41:18,466 --> 00:41:20,866
Officers Jimeno and McLoughlin.

509
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:27,229
We´re trapped near
the FE Five vestibule.

510
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:32,375
Will you please work?

511
00:41:36,851 --> 00:41:38,478
l´m so thirsty.

512
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:41,088
You´re not kidding.

513
00:41:41,656 --> 00:41:43,715
My mouth feels like a beach.

514
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:51,089
-How´s your pain?
-Comes in waves.

515
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,598
Every 20, 30 minutes.

516
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:59,636
Every wave, l feel the pain less.

517
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:02,976
But l´m more numb.

518
00:42:04,379 --> 00:42:08,110
The number l get
the more l want to sleep.

519
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,877
What´s wrong with sleep?

520
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,488
l wish l could
so this pain would go away.

521
00:42:16,691 --> 00:42:18,556
You´re bleeding inside, Will.

522
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:21,891
You sleep, you don´t know
if you´re coming back.

523
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:25,697
Awake, at least you got a shot.

524
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:29,969
Your brain, maybe, keeps you alive.

525
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:33,374
That´s what l think, anyway.

526
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,208
<i>You know that movie, G.l. Jane?</i>

527
00:42:40,415 --> 00:42:42,042
What´s-her-name?

528
00:42:43,718 --> 00:42:46,346
-Yeah, Demi Moore.
-Yeah.

529
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:50,951
You know the part where
the drill sergeant says,

530
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:55,955
´´Pain is good. Pain is your friend.
lf you´re feeling pain you´re still alive´´?

531
00:42:57,865 --> 00:42:59,833
l didn´t see the movie.

532
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:03,270
l keep thinking of that line.

533
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:06,606
Pain is your friend.

534
00:43:07,108 --> 00:43:08,700
lt means you´re alive.

535
00:43:10,578 --> 00:43:12,205
We´ll make it, Will.

536
00:43:13,181 --> 00:43:14,978
Just don´t go to sleep.

537
00:43:22,123 --> 00:43:24,091
Sarge, l got a fire here!

538
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:27,385
Sarge!

539
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:29,829
There´s nothing l can do here!

540
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:34,360
Sarge!

541
00:43:43,277 --> 00:43:45,575
l´m burning! l´m burning!

542
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,127
Please God.

543
00:44:00,228 --> 00:44:03,061
Where´d that wind come from
all of a sudden, Sarge?

544
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,530
l don´t know.

545
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:09,699
The fire just goes out like that, Sarge?

546
00:44:11,572 --> 00:44:12,937
Why´s that?

547
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:15,337
l don´t know.

548
00:44:16,644 --> 00:44:18,703
You´re not a big talker, are you?

549
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:21,007
No.

550
00:44:21,149 --> 00:44:23,276
Well, see, you got to talk to me ´cause...

551
00:44:30,224 --> 00:44:33,682
l can´t,
´cause my knees are crushed together!

552
00:44:33,928 --> 00:44:35,896
That´s why l can´t fucking talk!

553
00:44:35,997 --> 00:44:37,794
Oh, God!

554
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh, God. Oh, God.

555
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,369
Holy shit!

556
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:56,407
Dom´s gun is cooking off!

557
00:44:57,718 --> 00:44:58,776
Will!

558
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:09,361
Will! Will, that´s it!
All the rounds got to be done, Will.

559
00:45:09,897 --> 00:45:12,388
l can´t believe this is happening!

560
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,527
-Not in my whole goddamn life!
-Breathe, Will.

561
00:45:14,635 --> 00:45:15,966
Come on, breathe.

562
00:45:17,805 --> 00:45:19,272
Get your mind right!

563
00:45:32,386 --> 00:45:33,876
<i>Mrs. Jimeno, please hold.</i>

564
00:45:34,255 --> 00:45:37,691
<i>...Pennsylvania. This is where
the United Airlines flight,</i>

565
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:40,090
<i>l believe it is 1 76...</i>

566
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:44,221
<i>l´m sorry, l´m correcting...
United Airlines 93...</i>

567
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:47,199
<i>l´m sorry, Mrs. Jimeno, we can´t make
that kind of assessment yet.</i>

568
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:48,563
-We just...
-ls that Allison Jimeno?

569
00:45:48,669 --> 00:45:51,001
We grew up together.
Let me talk to her.

570
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:53,604
Al, it´s Brian. l just got in.

571
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,608
<i>-Hi, Brian.
-Allison,</i>

572
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:59,377
listen, they sent Will down on a bus
with a bunch of the guys.

573
00:46:00,314 --> 00:46:03,340
<i>-So he did go down there?
-Yeah.</i>

574
00:46:04,185 --> 00:46:09,054
And did he go in the buildings?

575
00:46:10,558 --> 00:46:11,855
We don´t know.

576
00:46:13,327 --> 00:46:16,455
Brian, did he go in the buildings
or did he not go in the buildings?

577
00:46:16,564 --> 00:46:18,293
<i>We´re trying to find that out.</i>

578
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:22,802
lt´s very basic.
Did he go in or did he not go in?

579
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:25,438
<i>Allison, l´ll call you
as soon as we know.</i>

580
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,835
Bianca? Sweetie, l´m sorry.

581
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:32,276
Brian, l... Brian, why don´t you
tell me what´s going on?

582
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,438
-l´ll take Bianca to my place.
-No.

583
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:34,878
-l´ll keep her here. l wanna...
-My parents are there.

584
00:46:34,982 --> 00:46:38,440
They´ll take care of her. Okay?
She´ll be five houses away.

585
00:46:39,053 --> 00:46:40,520
Want to go play?

586
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:42,656
<i>...shards of metal coming past...</i>

587
00:46:42,757 --> 00:46:43,815
Brian?

588
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:47,359
<i>President Bush was in Florida
when the attacks began.</i>

589
00:46:47,495 --> 00:46:51,192
<i>He spoke a short time ago
from an Air Force base in Louisiana.</i>

590
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:52,789
<i>Here´s some of what the President said.</i>

591
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,997
<i>The resolve of our great nation
is being tested.</i>

592
00:46:58,506 --> 00:47:03,375
<i>But make no mistake, we will show
the world that we will pass this test.</i>

593
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:04,871
<i>God bless.</i>

594
00:47:04,979 --> 00:47:07,470
<i>We´re told the President´s plane
has flown on,</i>

595
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:09,048
<i>but for security reasons,</i>

596
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:13,018
<i>the government will not say where
Mr. Bush is going or for how long.</i>

597
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,612
l don´t know if you guys know it yet,
but this country´s at war.

598
00:47:45,386 --> 00:47:47,684
Pastor, l gotta go down there.

599
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:49,886
-Where?
-New York.

600
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:57,896
You can´t. Only emergency responders
are being allowed in.

601
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:05,371
l´ve spent my best years
with the Marines.

602
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:10,538
God gave me a gift
to be able to help people,

603
00:48:10,644 --> 00:48:12,339
to defend our country.

604
00:48:14,382 --> 00:48:17,681
And l feel him calling on me now
for this mission.

605
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:21,887
Then find a way to listen, Dave.

606
00:48:31,437 --> 00:48:34,099
<i>l´ll leave that to you
to determine just how widespread</i>

607
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:38,475
<i>the human loss will be
in New York City alone.</i>

608
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:44,343
<i>America has changed today.
This is a dark day in this country.</i>

609
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,977
<i>lt´s in bold print in future history books</i>

610
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:51,682
<i>about how America was attacked
within its continental borders</i>

611
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,224
<i>to devastating effect by terrorists</i>

612
00:48:54,326 --> 00:48:58,695
<i>in a coordinated assault
using hijacked civilian airliners.</i>

613
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,859
-Hey, Mom?
-Yes, sweetie.

614
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:04,697
Dad knows it´s
my birthday party Saturday, right?

615
00:49:05,504 --> 00:49:07,870
Your birthday, are you cray?
Of course he does.

616
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:09,065
He´s just...

617
00:49:09,174 --> 00:49:12,666
He´s still working to help people
at the disaster at the Trade Center.

618
00:49:12,778 --> 00:49:16,145
But they keep saying a lot
of those people aren´t coming back.

619
00:49:19,285 --> 00:49:21,651
l´m not supposed to tell you this, okay?

620
00:49:22,154 --> 00:49:25,021
But he told me that he was gonna
take you to the playoffs next month.

621
00:49:25,124 --> 00:49:28,025
-The playoffs? Are you serious?
-l´m serious.

622
00:49:28,127 --> 00:49:30,721
Yes! The Yankee playoffs? l knew it.
l knew he was going to.

623
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:32,797
Mom, you better come here.

624
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:47,071
Stay here, okay?

625
00:49:48,314 --> 00:49:49,576
What´s wrong?

626
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:51,747
Dad and Uncle Pat have a deal.

627
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,616
lf anything happens to one of them,
they go and tell the other family.

628
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,054
Are you here to tell me something?

629
00:50:04,964 --> 00:50:07,956
Don´t come in here, Pat. l mean it.
Don´t you come into this house.

630
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:09,466
Donna, he´s not.

631
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:11,363
We don´t know. We don´t know.

632
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,904
They´ve declared him as missing,
that´s all. He´s just missing.

633
00:50:14,006 --> 00:50:16,440
l know. l know. l´m with you. Come here.

634
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:18,503
l know.

635
00:50:22,214 --> 00:50:24,910
We got confirmation. John went in.

636
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:42,093
Oh, Dad.

637
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:47,334
lt´s okay, baby.

638
00:50:48,007 --> 00:50:50,237
lt´s okay. lt´s gonna be okay.

639
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:53,812
Hey. Hey.

640
00:50:55,948 --> 00:50:59,247
Will´s a tough nut. He´s gonna make it.

641
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:01,446
-l know it, honey.
-Dad.

642
00:51:01,553 --> 00:51:03,077
-l just know it. Come on.
-Dad.

643
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,678
-Dad.
-Your mom´s out there.

644
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,451
-l´ll clean you up.
-Dad.

645
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:08,687
What?

646
00:51:10,229 --> 00:51:11,526
How...

647
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:18,362
How would l tell Bianca
her father´s dead?

648
00:51:22,908 --> 00:51:25,775
Missing means missing, Ma.
lt doesn´t mean dead.

649
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,369
She´s very strong.
She´s gonna be all right.

650
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:30,180
-Jer.
-Yeah.

651
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:34,580
We´ve got to call a doctor.
Give her something fast.

652
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,648
-Why?
-She could lose it.

653
00:51:37,856 --> 00:51:39,756
What is happening to this world?

654
00:51:40,025 --> 00:51:43,654
<i>...of this horrible and vicious
act of terrorism, acts of terrorism.</i>

655
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:48,756
<i>And our focus now has to be
on saving as many lives as possible.</i>

656
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:51,358
<i>Do we know the number of casualties
at this point?</i>

657
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,769
<i>l don´t think we really want
to speculate about that.</i>

658
00:51:55,307 --> 00:52:01,007
<i>The number of casualties will be more
than any of us can bear, ultimately.</i>

659
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,045
Sounded like a truck bomb.

660
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:07,647
<i>Like in ´93.</i>

661
00:52:08,287 --> 00:52:12,348
Blasted out the lobby.
Pushed everything in here.

662
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:15,425
Concourse must have collapsed.

663
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:21,699
You never answered, Sarge.

664
00:52:23,135 --> 00:52:24,602
What have we got?

665
00:52:25,737 --> 00:52:29,833
How long does this
internal bleeding take?

666
00:52:30,909 --> 00:52:33,878
l don´t know. l´m not a doctor.

667
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:38,543
Twenty-four hours
is the most l´ve heard of. Maybe 1 4,

668
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:40,948
16.

669
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:42,818
Just don´t sleep.

670
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:50,523
So we´ve been in six, seven hours.
What does that mean?

671
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,858
Another seven, eight hours from now?

672
00:52:59,738 --> 00:53:05,005
You remember that earthquake?
Where was it? Turkey?

673
00:53:05,744 --> 00:53:07,644
There was a little girl there.

674
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:11,305
She lived four days
buried in the rubble like this.

675
00:53:12,384 --> 00:53:14,852
She was, like,
three years old or something.

676
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:19,285
lf she could make it, we can make it.

677
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:25,096
Maybe we ain´t bleeding so bad inside.

678
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,206
-Sarge?
-Yeah, Will.

679
00:53:37,643 --> 00:53:39,270
You got any kids?

680
00:53:40,546 --> 00:53:42,810
Four. l got four.

681
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,410
-That´s a lot of kids.
-Yeah.

682
00:53:50,055 --> 00:53:52,285
lt´s a lot of work for my wife.

683
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:55,519
What are their names?

684
00:53:55,661 --> 00:53:58,061
Steven. He´s the oldest.

685
00:53:58,797 --> 00:54:00,264
He´s 15.

686
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:07,163
Caitlin´s 12. Peanut.

687
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:12,338
JJ, he´s 10.

688
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:17,682
We got a little girl.

689
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:20,248
Erin.

690
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,347
She´s four.

691
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:27,624
We had her late.

692
00:54:29,494 --> 00:54:33,123
lt wasn´t planned. lt just... lt happened.

693
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:38,197
l don´t know.

694
00:54:50,549 --> 00:54:53,279
-What´s that?
-What´s what?

695
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:55,379
That sound.

696
00:54:56,021 --> 00:54:57,818
l got a pipe here.

697
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:01,625
Keep doing that!

698
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,188
What about JJ´s tuition?

699
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:35,321
-lt´s not easy.
-Right.

700
00:55:36,695 --> 00:55:38,424
Did you vomit yesterday?

701
00:55:39,598 --> 00:55:41,930
Yeah. Yeah, yesterday and today.

702
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:44,195
-And today?
-Yeah.

703
00:55:45,737 --> 00:55:48,035
You know what?
l probably just have the flu, hon.

704
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,471
Yeah? Okay.

705
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:53,971
So, wait...

706
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,912
Yeah, there´s supposed to be a stripe.

707
00:55:57,015 --> 00:55:59,415
-A stripe? lt´s a stripe.
-Yeah.

708
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:01,145
Yeah, it´s a stripe.

709
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:05,653
That´s good.

710
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,282
lt´s good. lt´s good. lt´s good. lt´s good.

711
00:56:08,393 --> 00:56:10,156
Yeah, it´s good. Yeah.

712
00:56:12,564 --> 00:56:13,656
lt´s good.

713
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:17,132
<i>...seems just like a ghost town
in the financial district. Very eerie.</i>

714
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:19,703
<i>You saw people being wheeled
on gurneys</i>

715
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:22,032
<i>away from the site of the explosions.</i>

716
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,404
<i>People were coming out
with masks over their face,</i>

717
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:25,976
<i>anything they could put over their face</i>

718
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:28,273
<i>because the air was
still very thick with debris.</i>

719
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,349
<i>The ash on the ground
is at least two inches thick.</i>

720
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,747
<i>lt´s more like snow cover.</i>

721
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:34,182
Mom, listen.

722
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:37,913
<i>Officials are saying that as many</i>

723
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:41,925
<i>as 400 police, fire and rescue teams
entered the towers,</i>

724
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:45,861
<i>and there are fears that half of them
are missing and feared lost.</i>

725
00:56:45,964 --> 00:56:48,489
<i>We are waiting for more
on the survivors.</i>

726
00:56:48,934 --> 00:56:51,164
<i>There are no clear estimates
yet on numbers,</i>

727
00:56:51,269 --> 00:56:54,636
<i>but it is clear that many
of New York´s finest</i>

728
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,605
<i>have been lost on this day.</i>

729
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,609
<i>These are the so-called
first responders.</i>

730
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:01,076
Oh, my God.

731
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:05,410
That´s so many.
What are we going to do?

732
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:07,909
Mom, let´s go get him.

733
00:57:09,421 --> 00:57:11,753
Can we just go to the city and find Dad?

734
00:57:11,857 --> 00:57:14,519
-We don´t even know where he is.
-You´re gonna go drive and get him?

735
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:16,890
-Can´t you call someone?
-The phones don´t work.

736
00:57:16,995 --> 00:57:18,656
Come on, JJ,
there´s really nothing we could do.

737
00:57:18,764 --> 00:57:21,597
-You´re just worried about your birthday.
-No, Caitlin, stop it.

738
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,964
He needs us. l know if we just go
down there, we can find him.

739
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:25,434
Dad doesn´t need you to go find him.

740
00:57:25,537 --> 00:57:26,561
Come on, Mom, please.

741
00:57:26,671 --> 00:57:29,731
JJ, would you just stop it?
Stop it for a minute. Okay?

742
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:31,433
They´ll call when they know something.

743
00:57:31,543 --> 00:57:34,444
Lay off your ma, please. This is tough
enough on everybody. Come on.

744
00:57:36,348 --> 00:57:37,975
You don´t really care, do you?

745
00:57:43,622 --> 00:57:45,249
l´ll go talk to him.

746
00:57:45,624 --> 00:57:48,388
Hey, JJ, come on.
Come back here, kid. Let´s go.

747
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,721
He´s scared. He´s just a kid.

748
00:57:50,862 --> 00:57:51,829
Yeah.

749
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:55,526
He´s right, you know?

750
00:57:57,235 --> 00:58:00,033
l don´t even remember
the last thing l said to John.

751
00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:08,642
Excuse me.

752
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,279
This is it.

753
00:58:19,391 --> 00:58:24,021
l´m sorry. No, sir.
Nobody gets by here. Nobody gets by.

754
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:25,289
United States Marines.

755
00:58:25,397 --> 00:58:28,560
-Sure thing. ls your unit down there?
-Yes, sir.

756
00:58:59,197 --> 00:59:01,324
l´m gonna take a 3-8, Sarge.

757
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:04,461
Okay.

758
00:59:07,706 --> 00:59:09,606
Just don´t go to sleep.

759
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:15,706
´´Let me get that.´´

760
00:59:17,082 --> 00:59:18,208
What?

761
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:21,609
That´s what he said to me.

762
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:23,651
Antonio.

763
00:59:24,756 --> 00:59:26,485
´´Will, let me get that.´´

764
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,318
The cart.

765
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,228
lf he hadn´t switched places with me...

766
00:59:36,601 --> 00:59:38,068
And Dom.

767
00:59:40,505 --> 00:59:41,972
l made him stay and help me.

768
00:59:43,408 --> 00:59:45,103
l told him to stay.

769
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:48,141
Yeah, l begged him.

770
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:53,041
´´Don´t leave me, Dom.
Please don´t leave me.´´ And he stayed.

771
00:59:53,652 --> 00:59:55,950
You know, there was time.
He could have gotten out.

772
00:59:56,788 --> 01:00:00,849
And Chris. After being cut so bad,
he didn´t have to go in.

773
01:00:04,262 --> 01:00:05,729
You tell them.

774
01:00:10,335 --> 01:00:11,825
You tell them.

775
01:00:16,441 --> 01:00:17,965
l took them in.

776
01:00:20,178 --> 01:00:21,440
For what?

777
01:00:24,382 --> 01:00:26,145
What good did we do?

778
01:00:26,851 --> 01:00:28,580
We wanted to go in.

779
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:30,479
Kassimatis said you were the best.

780
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,887
You were the guy
who knew everything down here.

781
01:00:33,525 --> 01:00:38,053
Dom, Antonio and Chris, nothing was
gonna stop them from trying to help.

782
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:41,725
We figured
we might as well follow the best guy in.

783
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:44,227
The best?

784
01:00:44,402 --> 01:00:46,802
They did what they had to do, Sarge.

785
01:00:47,205 --> 01:00:50,470
They couldn´t have lived
with themselves if they hadn´t gone in.

786
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:52,242
That´s who they were.

787
01:00:54,245 --> 01:00:55,371
Okay.

788
01:00:57,582 --> 01:00:59,140
Thank you, Will.

789
01:01:11,262 --> 01:01:12,388
Will?

790
01:01:13,098 --> 01:01:18,058
lf this is it,
l am gonna see you someplace better.

791
01:01:19,537 --> 01:01:21,903
Sarge, l don´t know you too good...

792
01:01:22,007 --> 01:01:23,235
Our Father...

793
01:01:23,341 --> 01:01:24,501
...but l love you!

794
01:01:24,609 --> 01:01:26,076
...who art in heaven...

795
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:28,039
-Goodbye, John!
-...hallowed be thy name.

796
01:01:28,346 --> 01:01:31,645
Give us this day our daily bread...

797
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:35,044
Thank you, God, Allison and Bianca,

798
01:01:35,587 --> 01:01:37,384
who needs a daddy.

799
01:01:37,922 --> 01:01:40,720
Oh, God! Forgive us

800
01:01:41,593 --> 01:01:44,653
our trespasses as we...

801
01:01:44,763 --> 01:01:46,390
Let her know l love her!

802
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:48,963
...forgive those
who trespass against us!

803
01:02:42,087 --> 01:02:43,213
John?

804
01:02:45,256 --> 01:02:46,553
You there?

805
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:54,160
Yeah, Will.

806
01:02:57,035 --> 01:02:58,297
l´m here.

807
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:01,996
l´m still here.

808
01:03:06,845 --> 01:03:09,814
<i>About 20 minutes ago,
we were reporting on another building</i>

809
01:03:09,914 --> 01:03:11,848
<i>at the site of the World Trade Center</i>

810
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:14,578
<i>that they referred to as Building Seven.</i>

811
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:17,985
<i>Officials were watching
very closely because</i>

812
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:21,058
<i>it was on fire
and in danger of collapsing.</i>

813
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:23,917
<i>Well, moments ago, it did collapse.</i>

814
01:03:24,329 --> 01:03:27,298
<i>So that would be the third building
in the World Trade Center complex</i>

815
01:03:27,398 --> 01:03:29,332
<i>that has collapsed today.</i>

816
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,062
<i>There are no reports yet
of additional casualties...</i>

817
01:03:36,908 --> 01:03:38,307
<i>Rescue officials in the area</i>

818
01:03:38,409 --> 01:03:40,274
<i>have suspended
the search for survivors.</i>

819
01:03:43,348 --> 01:03:47,284
<i>No word yet on when rescue teams
might get back to trying to find anyone...</i>

820
01:03:47,385 --> 01:03:49,444
That´s a lot of guys not with him.

821
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:54,319
Port Authority Police.
Sergeant King speaking.

822
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:31,820
l got cars cooking off.
l got rounds flying all over the place.

823
01:04:32,263 --> 01:04:36,825
l´ve got guns all over the place.
Now back off. lt´s getting dark out.

824
01:04:36,935 --> 01:04:39,403
Chief, you got to let us in.
My whole battalion´s in here, Chief.

825
01:04:39,504 --> 01:04:41,972
-There´s still guys in there.
-l know it, boys. Not tonight.

826
01:04:42,073 --> 01:04:45,509
Tomorrow´s another day.
lt´ll be dark in a half an hour, man!

827
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:50,377
God bless their souls,
but l´m not letting you join them!

828
01:05:11,169 --> 01:05:13,535
Everybody report to the station there.

829
01:05:26,084 --> 01:05:28,052
What´s the status here?

830
01:05:28,653 --> 01:05:30,382
The search has been called off.

831
01:05:30,488 --> 01:05:34,219
They say the Marriott´s gonna go, too,
and until it´s more stable, we´re out.

832
01:05:36,661 --> 01:05:38,891
This whole thing is crap, man.

833
01:05:38,997 --> 01:05:41,693
Our guys are in there.
They´re dying in there.

834
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:47,605
lt´s like God made a curtain
with the smoke,

835
01:05:48,373 --> 01:05:51,570
shielding us
from what we´re not yet ready to see.

836
01:05:55,146 --> 01:05:56,875
All right, nut bag.

837
01:06:50,068 --> 01:06:52,036
Didn´t even finish them.

838
01:07:09,921 --> 01:07:12,549
<i>...a 45-degree angle.</i>

839
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:15,124
See? Okay?

840
01:07:15,226 --> 01:07:19,094
You put the plywood here.
Put the saw here. Nice and easy.

841
01:07:19,263 --> 01:07:21,754
Don´t force anything. All right?

842
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:24,494
Want to try again? Okay.

843
01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:32,002
Don´t force it. There you go.

844
01:07:47,825 --> 01:07:51,317
Sarge? You never told me
your wife´s name.

845
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:55,196
lt´s Donna.

846
01:07:56,434 --> 01:07:59,130
Donna? That´s a good name.

847
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:02,266
lt´s real American, you know?

848
01:08:03,574 --> 01:08:05,007
Mine´s Allison.

849
01:08:05,643 --> 01:08:08,203
She´s ltalian and some German.

850
01:08:09,647 --> 01:08:11,274
Don´t get her mad.

851
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,311
Yeah. She´s a wild one.

852
01:08:14,886 --> 01:08:19,346
Donna can get mad, too.
She wants a new kitchen.

853
01:08:20,658 --> 01:08:24,287
l´m okay carpenter, so

854
01:08:25,396 --> 01:08:27,193
l´m building her one.

855
01:08:28,299 --> 01:08:30,563
There´s no cabinets right now.

856
01:08:31,636 --> 01:08:33,103
She´s pissed.

857
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:36,165
So

Yeah, l know.

01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:54,819
Me, too.

863
01:08:55,726 --> 01:08:57,694
Tell me about your wife.

864
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,020
Well, she´s

865
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,400
five months pregnant now.

866
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:08,705
lt´s gonna be a girl.

867
01:09:11,042 --> 01:09:13,476
l already got one. Bianca.

868
01:09:14,045 --> 01:09:15,410
She´s four.

869
01:09:51,249 --> 01:09:53,149
You got to name Bianca.

870
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:56,517
You love that name Bianca.

871
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:59,317
No. l love the name, but you picked it.

872
01:10:00,525 --> 01:10:01,651
So?

873
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,928
So l get to choose the name this time.

874
01:10:06,197 --> 01:10:07,494
Alyssa.

875
01:10:08,432 --> 01:10:09,899
Alyssa?

876
01:10:10,468 --> 01:10:14,427
Kids are gonna love that name.
´´Alyssa the pisser.´´

877
01:10:15,173 --> 01:10:17,164
Look, l like Olivia.

878
01:10:17,808 --> 01:10:21,244
Olivia? Olivia sounds like Olive Oyl.

879
01:10:21,345 --> 01:10:22,642
-Will.
-What?

880
01:10:23,414 --> 01:10:24,745
Olivia.

881
01:10:26,317 --> 01:10:28,012
Olivia Jimeno.

882
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:06,014
l´m naming the baby Alyssa.

883
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:08,718
lt´s what Will wanted.

884
01:11:13,264 --> 01:11:14,561
What?

885
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:18,094
-l´m gonna pick up that prescription.
-What prescription?

886
01:11:18,603 --> 01:11:21,504
The doc called in
a prescription for you, honey.

887
01:11:21,606 --> 01:11:23,073
You know, for the baby.

888
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:26,475
Said we got to have it on hand,
just in case.

889
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:28,471
ln case what?

890
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:31,940
ln case you need it, honey. You know?

891
01:11:34,919 --> 01:11:36,944
-l´ll go with Jerry.
-No, Allison...

892
01:11:37,054 --> 01:11:40,820
l´m not sitting here waiting for a call
that Will´s dead.

893
01:11:41,425 --> 01:11:42,983
-Allison...
-l´m coming, too.

894
01:11:55,706 --> 01:11:56,730
What am l doing here?

895
01:11:56,841 --> 01:11:58,832
-Al, you all right?
-Yeah.

896
01:11:59,143 --> 01:12:00,804
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

897
01:12:01,145 --> 01:12:04,945
Will could be never coming home.

898
01:12:05,983 --> 01:12:09,180
l´m walking around CVS
like there´s nothing wrong.

899
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:09,720
You said
you wanted to get out of the house.

900
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,085
You said
you wanted to get out of the house.

901
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:13,418
You have your cell phone?

902
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,291
l left it.

903
01:12:17,928 --> 01:12:19,259
Karen, you have your cell phone?

904
01:12:19,363 --> 01:12:20,455
Karen.

905
01:12:24,568 --> 01:12:25,660
l forgot it.

906
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:28,969
We left the house with no phone?

907
01:12:54,565 --> 01:12:56,089
Al, what are you doing?

908
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,169
Got to get home.
This stupid light is taking forever!

909
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:00,567
Come on!

910
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:05,175
-Allison!
-Al.

911
01:13:05,409 --> 01:13:09,641
Allison! Would you get back
in the goddamn car?

912
01:13:10,047 --> 01:13:11,344
We´re going home.

913
01:13:19,256 --> 01:13:20,689
Did he call?

914
01:13:36,407 --> 01:13:37,499
Sarge?

915
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:41,104
l don´t think
l´m gonna make it to the morning.

916
01:13:44,215 --> 01:13:45,807
-l feel like...
-Will.

917
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,412
-Like...
-Will.

918
01:13:49,053 --> 01:13:52,614
You die, l´m gonna die.

919
01:13:53,924 --> 01:13:55,323
Okay?

920
01:13:55,993 --> 01:13:57,187
You die,

921
01:13:58,829 --> 01:14:00,694
l´m just gonna die.

922
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:05,194
Well, you can´t die, either.

923
01:14:06,537 --> 01:14:07,936
Sounds good.

924
01:14:09,273 --> 01:14:10,900
But in case...

925
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,372
You think you could do me a favor?

926
01:14:15,212 --> 01:14:16,679
What´s that?

927
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:19,375
Could you put it out over the radio

928
01:14:21,051 --> 01:14:22,541
that l request

929
01:14:24,088 --> 01:14:27,057
my daughter to be named Olivia?

930
01:14:29,193 --> 01:14:30,490
And tell them

931
01:14:31,796 --> 01:14:33,923
to tell Allison that l love her,

932
01:14:35,132 --> 01:14:37,896
and that she should name
my daughter Olivia.

933
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,842
8-13.

934
01:14:52,216 --> 01:14:53,979
This is McLoughlin

935
01:14:55,052 --> 01:14:56,144
PAPD.

936
01:14:57,121 --> 01:15:01,820
Officer Jimeno requests
his daughter be named

937
01:15:02,793 --> 01:15:03,987
Olivia.

938
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:07,321
Officer Jimeno

939
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:12,827
would like his wife, Allison,

940
01:15:13,671 --> 01:15:16,299
to know he loves her.

941
01:15:21,312 --> 01:15:23,109
Further to that,

942
01:15:26,851 --> 01:15:28,648
please tell

943
01:15:29,753 --> 01:15:31,220
my family

944
01:15:32,656 --> 01:15:34,954
l love them

945
01:15:39,396 --> 01:15:40,727
very much.

946
01:16:56,507 --> 01:16:58,031
Jee Louise.

947
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:08,843
JJ!

948
01:17:08,953 --> 01:17:11,114
<i>...psychologically across the country.</i>

949
01:17:11,355 --> 01:17:13,084
<i>lt´s had such an enormous...</i>

950
01:17:21,665 --> 01:17:23,690
JJ, what are you doing?

951
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:25,428
l told you before.

952
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:33,006
-Sweetie, get out of the car.
-No.

953
01:17:34,578 --> 01:17:36,978
-JJ, get out of this car. Now!
-No.

954
01:17:37,114 --> 01:17:39,014
-Don´t say no to me.
-What´s wrong with you?

955
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:41,277
-Don´t you want to find him?
-Yes, l want to find him.

956
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:43,615
-What if he´s dying?
-There´s nothing that we can do.

957
01:17:43,721 --> 01:17:45,279
What if we never see him again?

958
01:17:56,033 --> 01:17:57,500
All right, l´ll go. Get out.

959
01:17:58,235 --> 01:18:00,465
l said l´m going. Now, come on.

960
01:18:03,907 --> 01:18:05,932
You want some tuna without the bread?

961
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:07,970
No, Mom, l´m not hungry.

962
01:18:13,283 --> 01:18:15,080
You have to eat something.

963
01:18:15,986 --> 01:18:17,749
The baby´s going through this,
too, honey.

964
01:18:19,857 --> 01:18:20,949
How about a waffle?

965
01:18:21,058 --> 01:18:23,356
Forget it, Patricia. She´d throw it up.

966
01:18:38,942 --> 01:18:41,172
l could cook up some macaroni.

967
01:18:41,879 --> 01:18:46,782
No, that´s okay, Ma.
l´m going to put Bianca to bed.

968
01:18:51,255 --> 01:18:53,655
<i>lt´s also a great test for us all,</i>

969
01:18:53,757 --> 01:18:56,920
<i>wherever we live, whatever our age,
whatever our beliefs.</i>

970
01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:01,830
<i>Just look at that scene
and think about what happened today.</i>

971
01:19:03,467 --> 01:19:07,699
<i>Rescue officials predict that hundreds,
if not thousands...</i>

972
01:19:46,076 --> 01:19:48,101
-Mommy!
-Hey, baby.

973
01:19:59,156 --> 01:20:01,090
ls Daddy coming home?

974
01:20:08,665 --> 01:20:09,757
Honey,

975
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:14,870
l don´t know.

976
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:50,606
United States Marines!
lf anyone can hear me, yell or tap!

977
01:20:55,879 --> 01:20:59,576
United States Marines.
lf anyone can hear me, yell or tap!

978
01:21:03,253 --> 01:21:04,880
United States Marine?

979
01:21:11,495 --> 01:21:13,622
Are you heading in, too, Devil Dog?

980
01:21:15,132 --> 01:21:17,930
l´ve reconned the area, Sergeant.

981
01:21:20,204 --> 01:21:22,866
Our best shot is going up.

982
01:21:24,608 --> 01:21:25,905
All right.

983
01:21:31,481 --> 01:21:33,381
Someone says stop, you don´t stop.

984
01:21:33,483 --> 01:21:36,281
You don´t hear them.
There´s no going back.

985
01:21:37,688 --> 01:21:38,985
Let´s go.

986
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:41,387
Thomas.

987
01:21:45,262 --> 01:21:46,456
Karnes.

988
01:21:54,605 --> 01:21:58,063
United States Marines.
lf you can hear me, yell or tap.

989
01:22:40,217 --> 01:22:41,514
Sarge?

990
01:22:43,287 --> 01:22:44,379
John.

991
01:22:46,823 --> 01:22:47,949
Yeah.

992
01:22:50,193 --> 01:22:52,661
The most amaing thing just happened.

993
01:22:54,131 --> 01:22:55,655
l saw Jesus.

994
01:22:58,869 --> 01:23:00,336
And you know what?

995
01:23:02,306 --> 01:23:04,297
He had a bottle of water.

996
01:23:05,609 --> 01:23:09,306
And l could have drunk it, you know?

997
01:23:10,347 --> 01:23:12,144
But l didn´t drink it.

998
01:23:14,451 --> 01:23:16,749
He´s telling us something, Sarge.

999
01:23:18,355 --> 01:23:20,482
He´s telling us to come home.

1000
01:23:24,394 --> 01:23:26,259
Don´t sleep on me, John.

1001
01:23:27,864 --> 01:23:29,161
No.

1002
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,430
The pain´s keeping me alive.

1003
01:23:34,471 --> 01:23:35,938
Keep talking.

1004
01:23:39,609 --> 01:23:41,839
<i>You remember Starsky and Hutch?</i>

1005
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,105
When l was a kid, it was on TV.

1006
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:49,748
l remember the theme song.

1007
01:23:56,393 --> 01:23:57,860
When that would come on,

1008
01:23:57,961 --> 01:24:01,328
l´d run around the house
and arrest my sister, Karen.

1009
01:24:05,469 --> 01:24:07,699
Took me six years to be a cop.

1010
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,940
The only thing
l ever wanted to be was a cop.

1011
01:24:14,878 --> 01:24:16,505
How long you been in?

1012
01:24:17,681 --> 01:24:20,411
Twenty-one years.

1013
01:24:21,151 --> 01:24:22,778
Boy, that´s a lifetime.

1014
01:24:25,555 --> 01:24:27,682
You´re one tough guy, Sergeant.

1015
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,159
l don´t smile a lot.

1016
01:24:38,402 --> 01:24:40,461
That´s why l´m not

1017
01:24:42,072 --> 01:24:43,562
lieutenant.

1018
01:24:44,608 --> 01:24:45,905
People

1019
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:49,644
don´t like me ´cause

1020
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,706
l don´t smile a lot.

1021
01:25:03,827 --> 01:25:05,954
Yeah, that´s it. You got it.

1022
01:25:06,763 --> 01:25:09,061
We got Frank Sinatra over here.

1023
01:25:24,514 --> 01:25:27,005
lf you can hear me, yell or tap!

1024
01:25:55,879 --> 01:25:57,176
John.

1025
01:25:58,348 --> 01:25:59,975
John.

1026
01:26:01,184 --> 01:26:02,981
Remember what you said?

1027
01:26:04,054 --> 01:26:06,545
You sleep, you ain´t coming back.

1028
01:26:07,257 --> 01:26:10,124
You got to come back,
´cause we´re getting out of here.

1029
01:26:20,537 --> 01:26:21,834
Sarge!

1030
01:26:25,108 --> 01:26:26,735
John McLoughlin!

1031
01:26:28,211 --> 01:26:30,907
lf you can hear me, yell or tap!

1032
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:33,208
Can you hear me?

1033
01:26:35,552 --> 01:26:36,849
Are you sleeping?

1034
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:41,752
Sarge!

1035
01:26:45,328 --> 01:26:46,522
Will?

1036
01:26:50,167 --> 01:26:51,634
Where are we?

1037
01:26:53,303 --> 01:26:54,600
ln hell.

1038
01:26:57,474 --> 01:26:59,237
We´re alive in hell.

1039
01:26:59,543 --> 01:27:01,170
How about that, John?

1040
01:27:03,647 --> 01:27:04,944
Pipe.

1041
01:27:06,783 --> 01:27:07,977
Keep trying.

1042
01:27:09,386 --> 01:27:10,717
Try the pipe.

1043
01:27:23,867 --> 01:27:24,891
Good.

1044
01:27:25,936 --> 01:27:27,403
Keep doing it.

1045
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:39,208
We could circle back.

1046
01:27:44,754 --> 01:27:46,381
Never mind.

1047
01:27:51,461 --> 01:27:52,587
Yeah.

1048
01:28:00,103 --> 01:28:01,400
We hear you!

1049
01:28:02,539 --> 01:28:04,166
We hear you!

1050
01:28:08,278 --> 01:28:09,575
-Go!
-Keep yelling!

1051
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,677
8-13! PAPD down!

1052
01:28:14,184 --> 01:28:16,516
-Who´s down there?
-PAPD.

1053
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:18,247
McLoughlin and Jimeno.

1054
01:28:19,856 --> 01:28:21,824
-Hello?
-Here!

1055
01:28:22,792 --> 01:28:24,089
l don´t see you!

1056
01:28:24,361 --> 01:28:25,828
You got to be kidding me.

1057
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,327
Here!

1058
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,394
Gotcha.

1059
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:32,798
Gotcha!

1060
01:28:37,407 --> 01:28:39,739
Just hang on! Just hang on, okay?

1061
01:28:40,377 --> 01:28:42,777
Don´t leave us.
We´ve been here a long time.

1062
01:28:42,879 --> 01:28:47,043
We´re not leaving you, buddy.
We´re Marines. You are our mission.

1063
01:28:48,952 --> 01:28:51,750
That´s great! Oh, that´s great!

1064
01:28:56,626 --> 01:28:58,423
The Marines, John!

1065
01:28:59,629 --> 01:29:01,597
Can you believe that?

1066
01:29:07,137 --> 01:29:09,332
Sergeant, if we leave this spot,
we might never make it back.

1067
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:10,906
That´s what l´m thinking.

1068
01:29:13,109 --> 01:29:14,974
-lt´s overloaded?
-Yeah.

1069
01:29:18,381 --> 01:29:20,349
My sister in Pittsburgh.

1070
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:24,518
<i>Hello?</i>

1071
01:29:24,821 --> 01:29:26,789
lt´s me. l´m at the Trade Center.

1072
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:28,589
Yeah. Emergency Command.

1073
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,087
You got an exact location on that?

1074
01:29:36,966 --> 01:29:38,126
Great. Yeah.

1075
01:29:38,234 --> 01:29:41,670
Guys, l got two Port Authority cops
found in the middle of the rubble.

1076
01:29:41,805 --> 01:29:43,329
They´re still alive.

1077
01:29:53,283 --> 01:29:54,580
l got it.

1078
01:29:58,788 --> 01:30:00,415
Thank God!

1079
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:03,184
They found him, Donna!
You hear that? They got him.

1080
01:30:03,293 --> 01:30:05,727
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. All right.

1081
01:30:06,296 --> 01:30:08,764
All right. All right. Thank you.
We´re on our way.

1082
01:30:10,033 --> 01:30:12,797
He´s okay! The son of a bitch
walked right out onto Liberty Street.

1083
01:30:12,902 --> 01:30:15,166
They want us to meet him
at the bus terminal.

1084
01:30:15,271 --> 01:30:17,603
l am going to kick his ass
when l see him!

1085
01:30:19,275 --> 01:30:21,243
He just walked right out.

1086
01:30:22,245 --> 01:30:23,872
He just walked right out.

1087
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:35,749
-Allison, he´s alive.
-What?

1088
01:30:35,859 --> 01:30:38,327
He´s alive. They couldn´t kill him.
They couldn´t kill him.

1089
01:30:38,428 --> 01:30:39,395
They found him.

1090
01:30:39,796 --> 01:30:41,855
He´s trapped,
but they´re digging him out right now.

1091
01:30:41,965 --> 01:30:45,264
He´s the toughest son of a gun l know.
He´s made of rocks, is he not?

1092
01:30:46,069 --> 01:30:47,866
-He´s coming home.
-Come on. Let´s go.

1093
01:30:49,105 --> 01:30:53,064
Have you been working out?
l can´t keep up to you here.

1094
01:31:02,118 --> 01:31:04,177
l told you. Didn´t l tell you?

1095
01:31:04,287 --> 01:31:06,414
So where are we supposed
to pick him up?

1096
01:31:06,823 --> 01:31:08,791
Where are we supposed to pick him up?

1097
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:11,957
No one asked?

1098
01:31:12,128 --> 01:31:14,255
Jerry! What´re you doing?

1099
01:31:26,876 --> 01:31:28,503
-You´re the Marine?
-Yeah.

1100
01:31:28,611 --> 01:31:31,239
Scott Strauss, Emergency Service Unit.

1101
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:36,580
What do we got? How many
are down there? Two down there?

1102
01:31:36,686 --> 01:31:38,813
They´re Port Authority cops.

1103
01:31:39,289 --> 01:31:41,985
The first one´s down about 20 feet,
in pretty bad shape.

1104
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:43,752
The second one´s even deeper.

1105
01:31:44,027 --> 01:31:48,327
lt´s a tough hole to get down,
but they´re in there, and they´re alive.

1106
01:31:48,631 --> 01:31:50,428
We got to hold them off, Paddy.

1107
01:31:50,967 --> 01:31:52,264
All right, listen up.

1108
01:31:53,236 --> 01:31:54,863
No one make any sudden moves.
All right?

1109
01:31:54,971 --> 01:31:57,872
This whole thing´s
like a pile of pick-up sticks.

1110
01:31:58,341 --> 01:32:00,832
-ls there any F.D. up here?
-Any F.D. up here?

1111
01:32:00,944 --> 01:32:02,309
-Ed! Ed.
-Yeah.

1112
01:32:02,412 --> 01:32:04,972
Go back to Church.
Get the fire department up here.

1113
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:06,139
Got it.

1114
01:32:06,249 --> 01:32:08,513
ls Captain Yee on the radio?
Captain Yee on the air?

1115
01:32:08,618 --> 01:32:09,744
<i>On the air.</i>

1116
01:32:09,853 --> 01:32:12,515
<i>-Captain. Captain, it´s Scott Strauss.
-Go ahead.</i>

1117
01:32:12,622 --> 01:32:14,817
l got two cops here buried in the rubble.

1118
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:19,250
Right in the pile near the globe.
l need equipment and manpower.

1119
01:32:19,596 --> 01:32:22,224
Also get F.D. up here forthwith.
We´re gonna burn.

1120
01:32:22,332 --> 01:32:23,629
<i>Got it, Scotty. Stay safe.</i>

1121
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,268
l need a paramedic!
Who here´s a medic?

1122
01:32:26,503 --> 01:32:27,800
l used to be.

1123
01:32:27,971 --> 01:32:32,408
Used to be? Jesus Christ. Come on!
l need a paramedic here.

1124
01:32:32,775 --> 01:32:34,743
My license lapsed.

1125
01:32:35,945 --> 01:32:37,810
l had a few bad years.

1126
01:32:38,915 --> 01:32:41,315
But l know what l´m doing.

1127
01:32:42,352 --> 01:32:43,614
l´m good.

1128
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:47,087
You know this whole thing
could collapse on our heads and kill us?

1129
01:32:47,991 --> 01:32:49,288
Yeah.

1130
01:32:50,894 --> 01:32:52,191
What´s your name?

1131
01:32:52,695 --> 01:32:54,185
Chuck Sereika.

1132
01:32:54,531 --> 01:32:56,761
l´m Scott. Come on. All right.

1133
01:32:58,268 --> 01:32:59,257
Hey.

1134
01:32:59,369 --> 01:33:02,304
-Seen the way to one of them.
-All right, Paddy. Call it.

1135
01:33:02,605 --> 01:33:04,402
lt´s real tight, Scotty.

1136
01:33:05,608 --> 01:33:06,575
Hey.

1137
01:33:06,776 --> 01:33:09,244
You´re never gonna get down there
with all that gear, buddy.

1138
01:33:09,345 --> 01:33:12,473
Try this, Marine KBAR.
Best knife ever made.

1139
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:15,881
Thanks. You got a name, Marine?

1140
01:33:16,119 --> 01:33:17,609
Staff Sergeant Karnes.

1141
01:33:18,187 --> 01:33:20,155
l mean, something a little shorter.

1142
01:33:21,491 --> 01:33:23,015
Staff Sergeant.

1143
01:33:25,228 --> 01:33:27,025
-Okay.
-You all right?

1144
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:28,097
Yeah.

1145
01:33:29,566 --> 01:33:30,897
Okay.

1146
01:33:38,975 --> 01:33:40,875
My wife is Pat Strauss.

1147
01:33:41,611 --> 01:33:44,546
You tell her and my kids
that l love them, okay?

1148
01:33:49,252 --> 01:33:50,719
You ready?

1149
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,817
-Let´s go.
-All right.

1150
01:34:02,098 --> 01:34:04,089
Hi. Where´s John McLoughlin?

1151
01:34:04,567 --> 01:34:06,262
-Mrs. McLoughlin?
-Yes.

1152
01:34:07,704 --> 01:34:10,901
He´s alive,
but l´m afraid there´s been a mistake.

1153
01:34:12,241 --> 01:34:13,299
Mistake?

1154
01:34:13,409 --> 01:34:15,639
When they called me,
they really thought John walked out.

1155
01:34:15,745 --> 01:34:19,203
He didn´t. He´s still trapped,
but they´re working on him.

1156
01:34:21,117 --> 01:34:22,641
ls he hurt bad?

1157
01:34:22,752 --> 01:34:23,719
Oh, my God.

1158
01:34:27,724 --> 01:34:29,954
Oh, this is not right.

1159
01:34:30,059 --> 01:34:31,686
This is not right!

1160
01:34:32,395 --> 01:34:34,329
He gave you everything,
years of his life!

1161
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:36,421
And you can´t even get this right?

1162
01:34:43,506 --> 01:34:45,940
Where is he? l´m going down there.

1163
01:34:46,476 --> 01:34:49,070
l´m sorry, Mrs. McLoughlin.
lt´s too dangerous.

1164
01:34:51,848 --> 01:34:53,816
Where are they taking him?

1165
01:34:54,317 --> 01:34:55,614
Bellevue.

1166
01:34:57,153 --> 01:34:58,586
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1167
01:35:07,463 --> 01:35:09,522
Where do we take him
when we get him out?

1168
01:35:09,632 --> 01:35:11,065
Triage at One Liberty.

1169
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:12,964
And what´s the status of McLoughlin?

1170
01:35:13,069 --> 01:35:14,798
He´s further down.
We´re still working on him.

1171
01:35:19,409 --> 01:35:21,206
Easy, easy.

1172
01:35:22,045 --> 01:35:24,240
We need more length! Kink it!

1173
01:35:29,452 --> 01:35:30,919
What the hell?

1174
01:35:32,422 --> 01:35:33,719
-103!
-Yeah.

1175
01:35:34,757 --> 01:35:36,626
We need a line down here fast.

1176
01:35:52,241 --> 01:35:55,335
Okay, breathe this. Breathe. Okay.

1177
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:01,974
Chuck, how´s he doing?

1178
01:36:02,618 --> 01:36:05,416
Blood pressure´s holding. He´s stable.

1179
01:36:06,389 --> 01:36:08,857
But he´s swelling,
and he´s getting colder.

1180
01:36:09,058 --> 01:36:10,355
Paddy!

1181
01:36:11,094 --> 01:36:13,062
Get something to cover him, will you?

1182
01:36:14,163 --> 01:36:15,528
Hey, Willy.

1183
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:29,209
Brother, take a blow. Take the blow.
We got fresh guys up there.

1184
01:36:29,312 --> 01:36:30,370
All right.

1185
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,108
l got to get down below you.
We got a guy down below you.

1186
01:36:43,059 --> 01:36:44,651
l´m sorry, Will.

1187
01:36:46,629 --> 01:36:49,063
Why can´t l ever get a female cop?

1188
01:36:49,232 --> 01:36:50,859
At least somebody skinny.

1189
01:36:51,534 --> 01:36:53,934
What do you want?
My wife´s a great cook.

1190
01:36:55,171 --> 01:36:56,763
She´d better be,

1191
01:36:57,340 --> 01:37:00,138
´cause l´m bringing 20 people
to that barbecue you´re giving for me.

1192
01:37:00,243 --> 01:37:03,178
Scotty! They say
they can´t control the fires.

1193
01:37:03,446 --> 01:37:05,812
Building Four and Five
might come down.

1194
01:37:06,215 --> 01:37:08,183
Nothing like a little pressure, right?

1195
01:37:27,837 --> 01:37:30,328
God damn it. lt´s not working.

1196
01:37:30,606 --> 01:37:32,233
Try more cribbing.

1197
01:37:36,045 --> 01:37:37,512
Chuck. Paddy.

1198
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,247
Just get out of here.

1199
01:37:39,482 --> 01:37:41,450
This whole damn thing
could come down on us.

1200
01:37:41,784 --> 01:37:43,718
There´s no sense in all of us
getting killed.

1201
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:46,516
You gonna pry up that slab
and get him out of here yourself?

1202
01:37:47,957 --> 01:37:49,686
l´ve been in and out of rehab for years.

1203
01:37:49,792 --> 01:37:53,057
Finally figured out the only thing
l´ve ever been good at is helping people.

1204
01:37:53,162 --> 01:37:54,629
We´re doing this together.

1205
01:37:55,298 --> 01:37:56,526
l ain´t leaving.

1206
01:37:56,632 --> 01:37:58,896
l don´t mean to break up the moment,

1207
01:37:59,001 --> 01:38:01,162
but we´re all
getting out of here together.

1208
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:07,609
ls someone there? You got water?

1209
01:38:08,544 --> 01:38:09,841
Who the hell´s that?

1210
01:38:10,279 --> 01:38:12,611
l told you. That was my partner.

1211
01:38:13,382 --> 01:38:15,850
-Hey, John!
-l thought he was your partner.

1212
01:38:16,219 --> 01:38:18,084
l´m almost out, okay?

1213
01:38:18,721 --> 01:38:20,712
They´re coming soon. l promise.

1214
01:38:21,524 --> 01:38:23,617
-Okay, Will.
-Who´s that?

1215
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,725
McLoughlin.

1216
01:38:26,028 --> 01:38:29,156
Scott Strauss, ESU. How you doing?

1217
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:32,725
l´m okay. Need water.

1218
01:38:33,202 --> 01:38:36,933
We hear you. When we get Will out,
we´re coming for you.

1219
01:38:37,707 --> 01:38:40,335
We can´t get anything to you
down there right now, John.

1220
01:38:40,443 --> 01:38:42,070
There´s just no room.

1221
01:38:46,215 --> 01:38:47,477
This guy.

1222
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:50,848
He´s gonna die
if you don´t get him out soon.

1223
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:55,022
And the only thing in the way is my leg.
l want you to cut it off.

1224
01:38:56,559 --> 01:38:58,754
Just cut it off. l can live without a leg.

1225
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:03,257
Okay.

1226
01:39:06,769 --> 01:39:09,397
l´m not cutting your leg off. l can´t.

1227
01:39:10,206 --> 01:39:12,936
You´re coming out in one piece,
you hear me?

1228
01:39:13,042 --> 01:39:14,509
You gotta...

1229
01:39:14,877 --> 01:39:18,506
Look, it´s my leg.
Just juice me up and cut it off.

1230
01:39:18,948 --> 01:39:21,644
lf he dies, l die. That´s just the way it is.

1231
01:39:21,884 --> 01:39:25,285
Look, Will,
your partner must be 20 feet deeper.

1232
01:39:25,421 --> 01:39:27,651
Probably more compacted than you.

1233
01:39:28,024 --> 01:39:31,983
Even if l cut your leg off, he´s not gonna
get out of there for hours.

1234
01:39:32,695 --> 01:39:35,323
l´m sorry, man. Now, let me do my work.

1235
01:39:35,698 --> 01:39:37,495
We´re going again!

1236
01:39:41,604 --> 01:39:42,832
Hi.

1237
01:39:44,707 --> 01:39:48,609
Ma´am, this is Allison Jimeno.
She´s Will Jimeno´s wife.

1238
01:39:48,711 --> 01:39:50,804
l´m his sister.
We were told he was coming here.

1239
01:39:50,913 --> 01:39:54,280
We´re asking all the family members
to please wait in the cafeteria.

1240
01:39:54,383 --> 01:39:55,975
lt´s over there through the doors.

1241
01:39:59,588 --> 01:40:00,953
l can´t go in there.

1242
01:40:01,057 --> 01:40:03,855
Come on.
We´ll find someplace else, honey.

1243
01:40:12,635 --> 01:40:13,795
Hand it over here, boss.

1244
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:15,367
Hey, John!

1245
01:40:15,705 --> 01:40:18,833
They´re coming!
You hang in there! Okay?

1246
01:40:21,544 --> 01:40:23,205
l love you, John!

1247
01:40:23,879 --> 01:40:25,642
l´m waiting for you!

1248
01:40:30,219 --> 01:40:31,982
Don´t give up, okay?

1249
01:40:35,391 --> 01:40:36,688
Will.

1250
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,657
Tell them

1251
01:40:39,862 --> 01:40:43,320
l´m coming, too.

1252
01:40:45,301 --> 01:40:46,768
You tell them.

1253
01:40:47,169 --> 01:40:48,636
lt´s great up here!

1254
01:40:49,372 --> 01:40:51,340
lt´s just so great!

1255
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,568
Hey, where did the buildings go?

1256
01:41:20,803 --> 01:41:22,430
Hey, where did the buildings go?

1257
01:41:22,772 --> 01:41:25,104
They´re gone, kid. They´re gone.

1258
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:27,005
You´re going home.

1259
01:41:39,288 --> 01:41:40,949
You done it, Will.

1260
01:41:43,459 --> 01:41:44,858
You done it.

1261
01:41:47,363 --> 01:41:49,024
Go to your family.

1262
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:08,847
Who´s there?

1263
01:42:12,555 --> 01:42:15,115
No, not yet.

1264
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:29,137
Can you hear me?

1265
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:35,638
Not yet.

1266
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,342
John?

1267
01:42:43,486 --> 01:42:45,954
John, can you hear me?

1268
01:42:46,055 --> 01:42:47,522
-John!
-Easy, Scott.

1269
01:42:47,623 --> 01:42:48,749
Scotty?

1270
01:42:48,858 --> 01:42:51,452
-Down here.
-Coming to you. l´m good.

1271
01:42:52,495 --> 01:42:55,623
-l´m coming.
-lt´s tight.

1272
01:42:55,731 --> 01:42:58,529
l think l see him, Lou. l got him.

1273
01:42:58,767 --> 01:43:00,826
-ls he awake?
-Semi.

1274
01:43:01,837 --> 01:43:04,431
John? John, can you hear me?

1275
01:43:06,041 --> 01:43:09,533
John! l´m Scott, from ESU 5.
Man, l´m not gonna leave you.

1276
01:43:09,645 --> 01:43:12,478
l´m gonna do whatever l can
to get you out of here. All right?

1277
01:43:12,581 --> 01:43:14,139
-lt´s tight, Lou.
-All right.

1278
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:15,615
-Just send it back.
-All right.

1279
01:43:15,718 --> 01:43:18,016
Find a place to put debris.

1280
01:43:18,554 --> 01:43:20,818
Louie, bring it back.
l got an elevator shaft here.

1281
01:43:20,923 --> 01:43:22,220
You´re gonna be all right, John.

1282
01:43:22,324 --> 01:43:24,258
-We´re not leaving you.
-Bring the Sawall down.

1283
01:43:33,335 --> 01:43:35,599
Hang in there, John. Come on.
You´ll be all right.

1284
01:43:35,704 --> 01:43:39,003
Stay with us, John. Come on.
We got you.

1285
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:48,842
<i>We´re transporting Jimeno to Bellevue.
Have a trauma team standing by.</i>

1286
01:43:48,951 --> 01:43:54,116
<i>Respiration´s 26, B.P. is 90 over 58.
Got him on 15 liters O2.</i>

1287
01:43:54,456 --> 01:43:56,924
Room´s prepped.
Take him all the way down to the end.

1288
01:43:58,894 --> 01:44:02,125
Hey, they brought him in the back.
Come on.

1289
01:44:07,002 --> 01:44:08,196
This way.

1290
01:44:10,706 --> 01:44:12,003
Over here.

1291
01:44:24,086 --> 01:44:25,713
Oh, my God.

1292
01:44:26,855 --> 01:44:28,823
He´s breathing out rocks.

1293
01:44:30,059 --> 01:44:32,892
Will? Can you hear me?

1294
01:44:33,596 --> 01:44:34,893
Hey, baby.

1295
01:44:35,297 --> 01:44:37,891
Oh, baby, are you okay?

1296
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,197
We´re taking him to the O.R. now.

1297
01:44:40,336 --> 01:44:42,827
They said your leg was broke.

1298
01:44:44,673 --> 01:44:46,300
Will, baby?

1299
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:49,337
They told me you were all right.

1300
01:44:56,652 --> 01:44:58,882
l want you to name her Olivia.

1301
01:45:02,891 --> 01:45:04,825
No, l want Alyssa.

1302
01:45:05,761 --> 01:45:07,058
For you.

1303
01:45:09,465 --> 01:45:10,830
Olivia.

1304
01:45:11,166 --> 01:45:13,691
Ma´am, we´re gonna have to
take him up to O.R.

1305
01:45:13,802 --> 01:45:16,066
lt´ll be better for him
if you come with us, ma´am.

1306
01:45:16,505 --> 01:45:17,472
Will.

1307
01:45:19,875 --> 01:45:21,433
He´ll be okay, right?

1308
01:45:22,044 --> 01:45:23,443
There are some complications,

1309
01:45:23,545 --> 01:45:25,570
-but we´ve given him good...
-Will?

1310
01:45:26,448 --> 01:45:29,645
l´m going to name her Olivia, okay?

1311
01:45:30,619 --> 01:45:31,916
Okay.

1312
01:45:37,159 --> 01:45:39,889
John? You got two big slabs
on your chest.

1313
01:45:39,995 --> 01:45:41,826
lt´s the only way we´re gonna
get you out of here, all right?

1314
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:44,091
l got the big one, you got the little one.

1315
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:49,169
Pull it off.

1316
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:53,498
All right. John. We got one more.

1317
01:45:53,609 --> 01:45:55,543
One more, brother,
and we got your chest clear.

1318
01:45:55,644 --> 01:45:57,271
We got a good start.

1319
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,414
-Joe-Joe?
-Yeah?

1320
01:46:01,116 --> 01:46:03,311
Tell Lieutenant
to get a paramedic down here.

1321
01:46:03,419 --> 01:46:06,183
-We got to get an lV in him now.
-All right.

1322
01:46:07,022 --> 01:46:09,149
We´re gonna need a paramedic
down here now!

1323
01:46:10,459 --> 01:46:11,949
Come on, John. We´re almost there.

1324
01:46:12,061 --> 01:46:13,323
McLoughlin.

1325
01:46:14,763 --> 01:46:17,493
You´re in good hands, John.
You´re getting out of here.

1326
01:46:17,599 --> 01:46:20,864
That´s it, John. That´s it.
Hang in there, brother.

1327
01:46:21,403 --> 01:46:24,167
That´s it. Hang in there, John.
Don´t give up.

1328
01:46:24,273 --> 01:46:27,208
Don´t give up. We didn´t give up.
Don´t you give up.

1329
01:46:28,510 --> 01:46:30,273
John, can you hear me?

1330
01:46:30,646 --> 01:46:31,840
John, wake up.

1331
01:46:31,947 --> 01:46:36,247
That´s it, John, wake up. Stay with us.
Don´t go nowhere.

1332
01:46:40,923 --> 01:46:43,118
Come on, John. Come on, John.

1333
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:48,892
Stay with us, John. Don´t give up.
Come on, brother. Hang in there.

1334
01:46:49,064 --> 01:46:50,361
-John.
-Come on, John.

1335
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,668
Hang in there, brother.
Hang in there. Come on.

1336
01:46:54,036 --> 01:46:57,836
We´re almost home.
We´re almost home, man.

1337
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:58,907
Come on.

1338
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:02,837
Stay with us, brother.

1339
01:47:13,722 --> 01:47:15,212
l let you down.

1340
01:47:18,827 --> 01:47:21,694
All these years, l´ve been so careful.

1341
01:47:23,298 --> 01:47:24,822
Now l screw up.

1342
01:47:26,402 --> 01:47:28,029
l´m sorry.

1343
01:47:37,646 --> 01:47:40,513
Did l ever love you enough, honey?

1344
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:43,448
l mean,

1345
01:47:44,686 --> 01:47:49,020
did l love you good
like l was supposed to?

1346
01:47:53,962 --> 01:47:56,260
What the hell happened?

1347
01:47:58,967 --> 01:48:00,696
<i>l think we had it, John.</i>

1348
01:48:03,639 --> 01:48:05,504
lt was in the moments.

1349
01:48:09,178 --> 01:48:11,271
Happens to most people, l guess.

1350
01:48:11,814 --> 01:48:14,612
Me with the kids,
and you with the department.

1351
01:48:16,885 --> 01:48:18,853
Somewhere along the way

1352
01:48:20,689 --> 01:48:23,658
l guess we kind of stopped looking
at each other.

1353
01:48:27,796 --> 01:48:29,593
Come home, honey.

1354
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:32,026
The kids need you.

1355
01:48:34,837 --> 01:48:35,963
No.

1356
01:48:39,408 --> 01:48:40,773
l need you.

1357
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:43,109
Donna.

1358
01:48:43,812 --> 01:48:45,040
l can´t.

1359
01:48:46,348 --> 01:48:48,111
l can´t get out of here.

1360
01:48:48,817 --> 01:48:51,615
Honey, the kitchen´s
not even finished yet.

1361
01:48:52,988 --> 01:48:56,116
Okay. Would you get off the kitchen?

1362
01:48:57,459 --> 01:48:59,393
ls this necessary?

1363
01:49:00,062 --> 01:49:02,997
-l´m stuck.
-Then get unstuck.

1364
01:49:03,732 --> 01:49:05,632
Get off your ass, John.

1365
01:49:06,535 --> 01:49:09,265
Just get up and come home.

1366
01:49:10,038 --> 01:49:12,472
Donna, l can´t. l...

1367
01:49:17,713 --> 01:49:19,180
<i>You can do it.</i>

1368
01:49:21,717 --> 01:49:23,014
John?

1369
01:49:25,654 --> 01:49:28,316
What´s taking so long? Hey, you guys!

1370
01:49:57,553 --> 01:50:01,489
<i>One thing he said,
of all the images we´ve seen,</i>

1371
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:04,759
<i>it is a scene of New Yorkers calmly</i>

1372
01:50:05,694 --> 01:50:07,093
<i>evacuating...</i>

1373
01:50:07,195 --> 01:50:08,253
Great.

1374
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:10,398
lt´s not working. Don´t bother.

1375
01:50:14,703 --> 01:50:16,694
Waiting´s shit, isn´t it?

1376
01:50:17,906 --> 01:50:20,067
lf it´s gonna be bad,
you just want to know it. No bullshit.

1377
01:50:20,175 --> 01:50:21,506
That´s right.

1378
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:24,272
They´re digging my husband out.
They found him in the rubble.

1379
01:50:25,213 --> 01:50:26,612
That´s good.

1380
01:50:29,718 --> 01:50:31,948
My son´s down there. Lawrence.

1381
01:50:33,855 --> 01:50:37,484
He´s the elevator operator
in the South Tower. A good boy.

1382
01:50:41,363 --> 01:50:44,730
When l saw that building going down
like a pancake...

1383
01:50:50,872 --> 01:50:53,170
Damn thing is, l yelled at him.

1384
01:50:55,177 --> 01:50:57,304
Last time, l...

1385
01:51:00,048 --> 01:51:01,845
l made dinner.

1386
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:07,550
He got held up at work.
Food went to waste.

1387
01:51:10,359 --> 01:51:11,826
And l yelled.

1388
01:51:14,529 --> 01:51:16,656
Now all l want to do is hold him.

Way to go. Way to go, guy.

1412

John?

1413
01:54:08,236 --> 01:54:09,965
-Hi.
-Donna.

1414
01:54:10,071 --> 01:54:11,299
Hi, baby.

1415
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:14,440
John.

1416
01:54:15,443 --> 01:54:18,412
You kept me

1417
01:54:19,681 --> 01:54:21,308
alive.

1418
01:55:41,796 --> 01:55:43,525
You guys come
all the way from Wisconsin?

1419
01:55:43,632 --> 01:55:45,998
Yeah, those bastards.
We had to do something.

1420
01:55:47,168 --> 01:55:48,396
You want a brat?

1421
01:55:48,503 --> 01:55:49,902
Finest brat you´ll get in the whole world.

1422
01:55:50,005 --> 01:55:51,802
That´s a guarantee you can take
to the bank, mister.

1423
01:55:51,907 --> 01:55:53,204
Yeah, sure.

1424
01:55:54,109 --> 01:55:55,736
What are you doing down here?

1425
01:55:58,446 --> 01:56:00,744
-Paramedic.
-Atta way.

1426
01:56:09,958 --> 01:56:12,085
No, l´m not coming in today.

1427
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:16,327
l don´t know.

1428
01:56:18,633 --> 01:56:23,332
They´re going to need some good men
out there to avenge this.

1429
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:27,938
We´ll see.

1430
01:56:33,682 --> 01:56:36,947
Jimeno just got out.
McLoughlin´s still in surgery.

1431
01:56:37,385 --> 01:56:38,750
We´re still missing 1 4.

1432
01:56:38,853 --> 01:56:40,980
Jesus. What do we do?

1433
01:56:42,691 --> 01:56:46,388
Thousands of people in there, Paddy.
Where the hell are they?

1434
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:26,590
<i>9/1 1 showed us
what human beings are capable of.</i>

1435
01:58:27,429 --> 01:58:29,727
<i>The evil, yeah, sure.</i>

1436
01:58:30,665 --> 01:58:34,226
<i>But it also brought out a goodness
we forgot could exist.</i>

1437
01:58:37,539 --> 01:58:39,871
<i>People taking care of each other</i>

1438
01:58:42,143 --> 01:58:43,542
<i>for no other reason</i>

1439
01:58:45,013 --> 01:58:47,140
<i>than it was the right thing to do.</i>

1440
01:58:47,882 --> 01:58:50,851
-That´s my son, JJ.
-JJ, l´m Tim.

1441
01:58:51,386 --> 01:58:54,913
<i>lt´s important for us
to talk about that good, to remember.</i>

1442
01:58:55,323 --> 01:58:56,915
lf she wasn´t here, l wouldn´t be here.

1443
01:58:57,025 --> 01:58:59,493
Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Hi.

1444
01:59:00,795 --> 01:59:02,592
<i>´Cause l saw a lot of it that day.</i>
