1
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,466
<i>I remember the first time
I saw someone move</i>

2
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,978
<i>like they were
from another planet.</i>

3
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,810
<i>I couldn't keep my eyes away.</i>

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,310
<i>When I was little my mom
took me to watch a jam session</i>

5
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,648
in the neighborhood.

6
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,656
<i>It started out small,
but word spread.</i>

7
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,386
<i>Soon, some of the best dancers
around were showing up</i>

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,759
<i>to compete in something
they eventually called, "The Streets."</i>

9
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,165
<i>It became the hub, and
I got a front row seat to history.</i>

10
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:13,569
<i>I wanted to glide and spin
and fly like they did.</i>

11
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,108
<i>But it didn't come easy.</i>

12
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:20,840
<i>My mom would tell me,
"Don't give up, just be you,</i>

13
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,212
<i>'cause life's too short
to be anybody else."</i>

14
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,976
<i>She was right.</i>

15
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,250
<i>When I was 16,
my mom got sick.</i>

16
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,223
<i>Within a couple of months,
she was gone.</i>

17
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,624
<i>And everything changed...</i>

18
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,194
<i>... including The Streets.</i>

19
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,955
Shh. Shh.

20
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,224
Suspects jammed it.

21
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,236
- They went up the stairs.
- Sir, are you OK?

22
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,291
Yo, the Four-one-oh
killed it again, man.

23
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,520
That was sick, son.

24
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,960
Thank you very much.
I'm a genius.

25
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,396
If you do say so yourself.
Girl, get out of here.

26
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,400
Get that mask off.

27
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,766
Yo, we gonna get some
serious YouTube play, son.

28
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,828
Come on, let's go.
We gotta get to the spot

29
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,532
before everybody gets there.

30
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,838
Oh, man, we struck gold
with this. Look at that, D.

31
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,309
This is off the chain.

32
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,711
Boards are gonna go crazy
over this one.

33
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,045
- Yo, let's upload this stat. Not it.
- Not it.

34
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,108
Aye. Why it gotta be me?

35
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,450
- 'Cause you're the youngest.
- And, obviously, the slowest.

36
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,987
Girl, stop slinging
that Spanish at me, Telemundo.

37
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,825
- Aquí-quí-quí-quí-quí-quí-quí.
- Aquí-quí-hell!

38
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,660
- Gotcha.
- Oh, Jesus, Tuck!

39
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,963
Oh, man, wish you could see
the look on your faces.

40
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,334
- Can the jokes, son.
- So what did you guys think?

41
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,895
On the real?

42
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,305
- We killed that!
- Oh!

43
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,933
Oh, yes!

44
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,136
Lucky, lucky!

45
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,577
Streets ain't gonna be ready
for us this year.

46
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,081
- Finally.
- Let me see that. Let me see that.

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,517
- Give us my camera back. Give me here.
- Go, go, go, go.

48
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,687
So what's up?
We going out tonight?

49
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,129
I don't know. It's just...

50
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,396
It's been a crazy time,
at home with Sarah and all.

51
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,767
- Yeah, I heard that before.
- Yo, Tuck!

52
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,533
Come on, man, we bouncing.

53
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,631
- We gotta go. You're lagging.
- All right.

54
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,768
- I'll see you at rehearsal.
- OK.

55
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,836
<i>This video, posted
on the Internet just hours ago</i>

56
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,609

<i>and sources

65
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,103
- Not so fast, Andie. Get in here.
- Andie!

66
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,839
We've got to talk.
I can't believe you.

67
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,974
- Dinner was an hour ago.
- Sorry, Sarah, bus was late.

68
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,541
I'm here, so just chill out.

69
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,610
Baby, you go on upstairs
and go to bed.

70
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,178
OK.

71
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,655
I know where you been.
It's all over the news.

72
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,559
So don't stand here
and lie to my face.

73
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,654
You realize you could
have been arrested?

74
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,892
It wasn't a big deal.
You have no idea.

75
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,128
You've got to take
responsibility for your life.

76
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,067
You can't follow
the Four-one-oh forever.

77
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,073
Those people are criminals.
I'm putting my foot down.

78
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,608
This has got to stop. Now.

79
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,111
No! No, the Four-one-oh
is the only family I have left.

80
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,079
Who are you to tell me
how to live my life?

81
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,945
Your mother was my best friend!

82
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,280
I told her that
I would be your guardian.

83
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,411
I promised her that
I would take care of you

84
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,455
so you wouldn't have
to leave your life here.

85
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,956
But you won't let me.

86
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,993
Instead, you skip school.
You're out all night.

87
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,051
God only knows what you're doing.

88
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,790
I can't do this.

89
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,765
Your Aunt Alice and I
have been talking.

90
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,497
- You can't live here anymore.
- You're sending me to Texas?

91
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,768
Like I haven't lost enough already?

92
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,433
You can't do this to me!

93
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,637
Your mother never would've let you
get away with half the things I have.

94
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:31,342
No, you have no idea
what my mother would have done.

95
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,536
Felicia, where are you?

96
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,505
I don't know what to do.
I'm going crazy.

97
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,735
I'm done with her.
Please, I need a place to crash.

98
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,972
I'm not staying there anymore.
Call me. I'm heading to the Dragon.

99
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,213
What's poppin'?
I'm the man, DJ Sand.

100
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,377
Tonight it's all about
the Benjamins, baby.

101
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,614
We taking it to The Streets for green.

102
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,283
You got money? No, you don't.
We gonna get it started.

103
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,986
Brand new music. Listen to this one.

104
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,896
Yo, Meazy. What's going on?

105
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,065
- Yo, D. What it is.
- How are ya?

106
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,938
- You out to do some damage tonight?
- You want to take my bag?

107
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,137
Yes, yes, got it, got it.
It's crazy out there.

108
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,077
- I know. It is.
- About to do your thing?

109
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,116
- Oh, I will. You know.
- Go school them fools.

110
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,024
Look who's all grown up now.

111
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,464
Ty, what are you doing?
Oh, my God.

112
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,866
- What's up, little one?
- Oh. I thought you were

113
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,403
- in New York with Nora.
- I am.

114
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,029
I came back to get
the rest of my stuff.

115
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,437
- Guess what.
- What?

116
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,975
- Me and Nora are going on tour.
- What?

117
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,534
Oh, that is unreal.
You better remember me

118
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,170
when you get all famous and stuff.

119
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,374
Are you kidding me?
I remember you when you were

120
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,441
running around in diapers.
You were a pain in my ass.

121
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,077
That's really embarrassing.

122
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,179
Seriously, what's going on
with you and Sarah?

123
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,918
- She called you.
- No, she didn't call me.

124
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,324
I came by to see you,
and she told me you took off.

125
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,363
She's flipping out.

126
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,193
Did she tell you
she's sending me away?

127
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,028
She don't know what else
to do with you.

128
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,533
She's trying to look out for you,

129
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,832
like your mom and everyone else
looked out for me.

130
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,202
- So, you're siding with her.
- No, I'm not.

131
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,173
I don't even need to explain this.
I'm out.

132
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,267
Whoa, whoa, come on. Chill out.

133
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,438
Maybe you'll realize there are
some less dramatic options.

134
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,106
Really, like what?

135
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,412
- MSA.
- OK.

136
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,044
- Maryland School of the Arts.
- Yeah, I know what it is.

137
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,113
Are you crazy? Do I look like
some princess prima ballerina?

138
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,456
Andie, what other options
do you have? Hmm?

139
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,923
Let me break it down for you.

140
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,366
Sarah will give you one more shot.

141
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,633
But MSA's no joke.

142
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,072
You gotta go to class, you can't
skip school, you got to study.

143
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,268
No chance, no way.

144
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,677
OK, fine, I'll battle you for it.
Right now.

145
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,578
You win, I never saw you here tonight.

146
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,140
I win, you get your ass back home
and you're at MSA

147
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,651
first thing in the morning.

148
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,813
If you're scared, say you're scared.

149
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,083
I wouldn't want to battle me
if I was a girl.

150
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,495
No smile?

151
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,088
What, you scared? You down?

152
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,395
Hold it, hold it.
Hold up, hold it.

153
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,268
We got royalty in the house.
Tyler Gage is in the building.

154
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,135
Oh, man.

155
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,675
You know we gotta
do something special, right?

156
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,301
Clear the dance floor. Back up!

157
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,537
Brand new music.

158
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,351
Oh, man,
are those trampolines?

159
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:59,285
Use 'em or lose 'em.
Here we go. Cool, y'all.

160
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,654
Dre, you want to get this?
I'll break my neck.

161
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,629
No, I got it.

162
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,393
Is she talking crazy?

163
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,093
You still dance like a little girl?

164
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,118
Let her know
what's good, Tyler.

165
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,344
Come on, I want to show you.

166
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,618
Oh, wow! He's killing you!

167
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,019
Whoo!

168
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,295
She punched it on you.
Whatcha gonna do?

169
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,302
Did she stick you?
She stuck it on you.

170
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,863
What you gonna do? He's not...

171
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:54,038
Oh, no!
He's coming out of his clothes!

172
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,598
It's over. It's over.

173
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:02,039
Come on, y'all. It's all good, Andie.
Next time, baby.

174
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,717
It's all right. You're good, ma.

175
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,418
Oh. Hey.

176
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,952
Don't sweat it. Everybody's
hatin' on you 'cause you're dope.

177
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,605
Are you running off again?

178
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,837
- No.
- No?

179
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,574
- I'm just trying to look out for you.
- Yeah, whatever.

180
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,583
Yeah, whatever.
Don't give me "whatever."

181
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,623
Let's get you out of here.
I've got to get you home,

182
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,526
plus we've got to sell Sarah
on the idea.

183
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:54,260
- I thought she agreed.
- Just let me do the talking.

184
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,632
No. I'm sending her
to Texas, that's final.

185
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,671
She's already on probation at school.

186
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,935
This is the one shot she needs
to take all that anger she's got

187
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,703
and be able to put it into a structure.

188
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,210
She's not going to school now.

189
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,179
What makes you think
she's gonna go to this school?

190
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:18,151
- Piece of cake.
- No way.

191
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,659
- That's the thanks for saving your ass?
- She's down?

192
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,355
Believe it or not, she thinks
I set a good example for you.

193
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,057
- What?
- I don't know.

194
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,463
My work here is done.
I'm going home.

195
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,398
Now, all you have to do is get in.

196
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,966
I thought you said
you took care of everything.

197
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,942
I didn't say I'd get you in.
I said I'd get you an audition.

198
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,241
So, go show 'em what you got, all right?

199
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,577
Go hard, make me proud. Promise?

200
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,550
- Promise.
- OK.

201
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,546
Stay out of trouble, all right?

202
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:03,268
Holy hell. I cannot believe
you're about to do this.

203
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:08,296
Well, it is this or Texas,
so... take your pick.

204
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,070
Don't blow it.
No pressure or anything, girl.

205
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,376
- Wait a minute.
- Check that out.

206
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,245
It can't be that bad, going here.

207
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,717
- She's hot.
- Missy, shut up.

208
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,380
- What?
- Just stop talking.

209
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,754
- I guess.
- Look, go in there and kill it.

210
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,020
We'll see you at rehearsal afterwards.

211
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,654
- Come on, Missy.
- Good luck, D. Later.

212
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,927
He was cute. You're mad
'cause he wasn't looking at you.

213
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,401
He wasn't looking at you
or your chapped lips.

214
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,133
Boring. It's a bunch of clones.

215
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,433
Just because they do turns
with their feet and not on their heads?

216
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:16,407
Very funny. Wake me up
when they're all done.

217
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,276
I think we'd all agree that talent comes
from mastering technique.

218
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:24,010
I was brought here because
I can turn amateurs into professionals.

219
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,880
Nailed it.

220
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,454
Music, please.

221
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,093
- Thank you.
- Do you have your paperwork?

222
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,561
Yep.

223
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,927
- Hi.
- Hi.

224
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:35,846
Thank you, Miss, uh... West.

225
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,288
- Mm-hmm.
- Well.

226
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,423
Well, she was different.

227
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,230
Kidding? That was the best dance
today. The girl's amazing.

228
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,736
She's just a street dancer.

229
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:55,866
Blake, I thought you could
turn anyone into a professional.

230
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,113
Hold that.

231
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,847
So what happened?

232
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,788
- You guys, I choked.
- What do you mean?

233
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,951
I tried to get it back
but I just freaked out.

234
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,120
Sarah gonna have her
in Texas before we know it.

235
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,824
- Hello?
- Yo? Who you talking to?

236
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:22,197
- Oh, here he comes.
- I gotta take this real quick.

237
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,498
Man, what y'all doing? Come on.

238
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,903
- How'd she mess up?
- I hope she didn't.

239
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,167
Yo, Rap.

240
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,338
- Looks like I'm staying.
- Oh!

241
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,382
- You are!
- Goodness, girl.

242
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,043
I knew you would.
How were you not gonna make it?

243
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,553
Yo, we need a family meeting.

244
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,646
Yo, we got this gig
at the Dragon coming up,

245
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,816
and we're not even close to being ready.

246
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,621
The Four-one-oh is a unit.

247
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:51,095
We're only as strong as
our weakest link. With the way

248
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,826
our new members are slacking,
we have to step it up.

249
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,461
Which means,
rehearsal every day, 4:00 p.m.

250
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:02,031
No excuses, no being late,
and no cell phones.

251
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,632
Are we clear?

252
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,678
- Crystal.
- We're clear.

253
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,844
You're in my seat.

254
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,976
I'm kidding.

255
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,450
This is my seat, but I'll give you
a pass for today.

256
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:25,186
Nice. Nice. Nice shirt,
Napoleon Dynamite. Nice.

257
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,954
You look fantastic today,
by the way. Nice hair.

258
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,790
What's up?

259
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,389
I'm Robert Alexander, III.
You can call me Moose.

260
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,195
What's up. I'm Andie.

261
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:36,963
It's like this. Give me your hand.

262
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,766
You got to blow it up.
Blow it up, right. Blow it up.

263
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,837
Go by like that. Aye! Yeah?

264
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,311
It's mine, so... Shh.

265
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,888
- You're not eating?
- You call this food?

266
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,931
Tofu dogs are both
nutritious and delicious.

267
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,626
This is good.

268
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,166
Mmm.

269
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:16,106
<i># Tastes like candy canes
at Christmas #</i>

270
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,510
- What?
- You've got crap on your face.

271
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,443
Oh. I knew we could
help each other out.

272
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,318
Oh, what makes you think I need help?

273
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,154
What makes you think I need...

274
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:34,750
Trust me. I have what you need.

275
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,888
I have the inside on everything.
Who's dating, who's hating.

276
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,559
And who's hooking up.
What's up, Dan? What's up, Gator?

277
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,795
- Who's that?
- See you guys later.

278
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,304
That's the music room.
This is the art room

279
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,806
where some of the greatest
Baltimore artists...

280
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,344
I'm dead serious.

281
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,907
Sorry.

282
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,584
Oh!

283
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,555
You OK?

284
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,785
Hey.

285
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,193
Thank you.

286
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,459
We gotta stop meeting like this,
you know.

287
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,258
It's Andie, right?

288
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,204
I'm Chase. Welcome to MSA.
I'm glad you made it in.

289
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:22,468
Well, here I am.

290
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,339
You're an amazing little dancer.

291
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,776
- What?
- You're an amazing little dancer.

292
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,212
Little? Really?

293
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,716
Well, you know, I wouldn't call
my dancing "little."

294
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,651
- I definitely was not trying to say...
- Andie!

295
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,315
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

296
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,988
- Chase.
- Hey.

297
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,426
- How you doing?
- Great. You guys are friends?

298
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,798
- Yeah, we go way back.
- Good.

299
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,961
We're actually late
for a little something, so...

300
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,732
We are?

301
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,773
- Yeah.
- What?

302
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,207
- That thing you told me?
- I didn't tell you anything.

303
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,608
Yes, you did. We're gonna go.

304
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,171
- Remember that thing?
- What?

305
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,309
- That thing you wanted to do?
- What are you talking about?

306
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:09,184
I can't believe
you know Chase Collins.

307
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,746
That's extremely vital
information to withhold.

308
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,349
- I don't know him.
- He's Mr. Popular.

309
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,157
Like a legacy. His parents,
like, founded this school.

310
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,164
And his brother is legendary.

311
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,996
- Dr. Collins is his brother?
- Yeah.

312
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,401
He used to go here, then moved to
London to dance with the Royal Ballet.

313
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,462
Oh, my God. That's him?

314
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,407
Yeah. It's hard to believe,
right, with all those feathers.

315
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,137
So why'd he come back?

316
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,679
Good question.

317
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,945
Sources say he has some sweet deal
to make MSA the next Juilliard.

318
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,543
Which he's been trying to do.
Maybe he's just burned out.

319
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,986
One thing's for sure.

320
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,956
There's a lot of changes
going down that nobody likes.

321
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,458
Here.

322
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,356
Anyway, the Collins
are like flippin' MSA royalty.

323
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,922
Chase, he's a ladies' man.

324
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,491
- He's a player?
- Like an all-star.

325
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,562
He's only recently taken the jersey
out of retirement. So be warned.

326
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,936
Oh, and that's Cyborg Sophie.

327
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,878
She's an MSA machine
and Collins' crowning achievement.

328
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,711
She's a triple threat.
She acts, sings and dances.

329
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,217
She won every competition out there.

330
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,777
But she just lost
the biggest battle of them all,

331
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,982
the one for Chase's heart.

332
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,787
<i>It's like I've landed
in an episode of The Hills.</i>

333
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,387
He broke up with her a few weeks ago,
but they'll end up together.

334
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,024
Just in time
for the season finale, huh?

335
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,831
See? I knew you'd come around.

336
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,801
Hello, everyone.
I'm Director Collins.

337
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,966
I hope you've all stretched
this morning,

338
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,704
'cause we have
a lot of work to do today.

339
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,679
I'm sure that everyone
has heard of our plans

340
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:45,444
to move MSA into a new
state-of-the-art facility.

341
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:49,045
Well, to encourage the donors,
we're throwing a fundraiser,

342
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,611
where you will perform

343
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,625
to demonstrate what
a good investment you are.

344
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,217
It should be a wonderful event.

345
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:59,025
You are all required to participate
in one way or another.

346
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:02,090
So, let's begin with some improv,
shall we?

347
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,534
Jimmy, you're up.

348
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:18,312
You're late. Not being on time
won't fly in the real world.

349
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,045
Already with that stuff, Blake?

350
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,351
- That's Director Collins.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

351
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:28,122
Chase, show us what you got.

352
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,485
Not great. Could do better.

353
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,829
OK. Andie, you're up.

354
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,838
Are you serious?

355
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,240
Listen and interpret.

356
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:29,048
Andie. Andie!
You're all over the place.

357
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:32,090
Again, from the top,
listen and interpret.

358
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:55,076
Stop. Stop! Can I have
a word with you in private?

359
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,308
And bring your bags.

360
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,155
You understand you've been
given an opportunity

361
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:03,780
You understand you've been
given an opportunity

362
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,619
that others couldn't even dream of?

363
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,921
I put my name on the line for you,

364
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,292
and I'm beginning to wonder
if I made a mistake.

365
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,490
You clearly have
some catching up to do.

366
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:16,262
Starting tomorrow I'm assigning you
to attend after school sessions with me.

367
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,565
Well, I can't. I gotta be somewhere.

368
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,435
Consider this an opportunity.

369
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,104
What?

370
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:26,702
Made a mistake
and kissed a snake

371
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,579
How many doctors did it take?

372
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,142
One, two, three, four

373
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,453
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

374
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,789
Just breathe.
First day's always the worst.

375
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,224
- I was just...
- That's OK.

376
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,526
I come out to the front steps
and meditate, too.

377
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,260
What? It's not meditating.

378
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,494
It's just, you know,

379
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,763
you had some pretty
serious balls today in class.

380
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,998
- I was impressed.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

381
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,473
- You're welcome.
- So what's your deal?

382
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,975
Boy bands making a comeback?

383
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,239
Yeah. They have a course on it here.

384
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,876
I'm getting straight A's.

385
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,939
That wouldn't surprise me.

386
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:10,422
Look, it's been interesting
bonding with you, but I'm late.

387
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:13,424
- Late for what?
- Just this rehearsal thing.

388
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:17,485
- Rehearsal for what?
- Rehearsal with some friends.

389
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,293
- Like a crew?
- What would you know about that?

390
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,891
Knew it. Saw you at the Dragon.
You're with Four-one-oh.

391
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,368
- I don't know what...
- I've always wanted to compete,

392
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,838
I've just never had an in.
Can you hook me up?

393
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:31,308
Hey, Chase, we're working
on the routine for the fundraiser.

394
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,401
Are you coming?

395
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,207
Yeah, I'll be right there.

396
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,211
Sophie, I'll meet you in the rehearsal.

397
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:40,547
OK.

398
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,119
Look.

399
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:48,654
The Streets is about where you're from.

400
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,753
It's not some school talent show.

401
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,993
There's no spring floors.
There's no spotlights.

402
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,057
You use what you got and...

403
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,159
What makes you think you got it?

404
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,705
Weren't you late for something, Andie?

405
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,900
All dressed in yella

406
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,533
Went upstairs to kiss a fella

407
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,578
One, two, three, four

408
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,977
five, six, seven, eight,

409
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,845
- Bye, Andie West.
- nine, ten, 11, 12,

410
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,384
13, 14, 15, 16...

411
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,716
...five, six, seven, eight.
Again.

412
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:20,191
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

413
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,286
One, two, three, four.
Whoa, wait, oh, wait.

414
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,457
You did that different.
Can you do that from three four?

415
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,932
Let me go figure this out.

416
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,992
Y'all just chill here for a second.

417
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,470
Where have you been?
I been texting you all day.

418
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,906
I know, I'm sorry.
The school thing is crazy.

419
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,534
Will you cover for me with Tuck?

420
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,772
Don't I always cover for you? Yeah.

421
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,814
Yo, D, let me holler at you.

422
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,719
Yo, where you been?

423
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,379
I had to take care of some stuff.

424
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,652
- Yeah, with who?
- Charlie.

425
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:55,626
Sarah asked me to take care of him
while she was at work.

426
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,662
You still coming over tonight or what?

427
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,257
Yeah, yeah. Gonna take care
of some stuff and I'll be there.

428
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,096
All right.

429
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,304
Yo! Start from the beginning.

430
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,670
OK, now, point your toe.

431
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:11,871
You see, you're sickling.

432
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,344
There should be no curve
disrupting the line from the knee

433
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:21,410
all the way down to the tip of your toe.

434
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:23,979
- Ow! Ow!
- There you go. That's it.

435
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:26,287
- There. That's it.
- Ow. Pointing hurts.

436
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,621
Yeah, it's supposed to.

437
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,571
Pull in your stomach.
Flatten, flatten, flatten.

438
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:51,810
Now, tuck your butt.

439
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:54,079
Keep this leg turned out.

440
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,212
Turned out. Turned out!

441
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:57,620
Oh, my God.

442
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:12,632
<i>Balancé, balancé,
chassé, pas de bourrée,</i>

443
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,572
turn, turn, down, finish.

444
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,040
Turn, turn, spot, spot!

445
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:27,245
Ready, and feet in front, feet back,

446
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,117
feet front, feet back. Come on.

447
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:33,591
And back and back
and back and back

448
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,059
and back and back and back
and back and back and back and back.

449
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:38,689
Good! That's it.

450
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,198
Andie? There's dinner down here.

451
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:04,284
<i>Yo, where D at?</i>

452
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:09,458
She left me a message.
Sarah got her on lockdown again.

453
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,094
Guess she's missing out... again.

454
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,897
Guess so.

455
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:20,302
And then I was like,
"Damn, your breath stinks."

456
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,772
Why would you say that?

457
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:24,674
- I thought it would be cool.
- Well, it wasn't.

458
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:30,780
- It's my mom.
- Oh, my gosh.

459
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,114
- What?
- That is not your ringtone.

460
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,849
Why? It's the coolest thing ever.

461
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,051
OK, fine. Listen.

462
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:48,959
Here we go.
Watch me, watch me, watch.

463
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:33,438
I don't even know him.

464
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:37,142
You were so sick.
I had no idea you could dance.

465
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,150
- Whatever.
- What are you talking about?

466
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,947
Why don't you dance here?

467
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,147
I can freestyle all right. Right?

468
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,622
But I didn't get in here for dance.

469
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,319
I didn't think I could do choreography.

470
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,328
But now I'm all about lighting design.

471
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:06,705
The end's not working.

472
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,043
Mixing those moves just feels wrong.

473
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:11,913
- Come on, man.
- Let me show you something.

474
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:15,545
If you put this here into a canon,
and then swing through to fifth,

475
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,954
then bring it down. Step, step, stag.

476
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:23,052
<i>Soutenu, double tour to the knee.</i>

477
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,029
Nice, Jimmy.

478
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,737
Looks like someone's in a good mood.

479
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:35,740
Must be hard living in the shadow
of a legend, huh?

480
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,072
Wow, that coming
from the MSA charity case?

481
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:44,807
I was kidding. You're right,
he's an ass. I'm out of here.

482
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:04,100
Look, I never called you an ass.

483
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:07,499
She just said that for dramatic effect.

484
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:17,406
If you're trying to win her over,

485
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,451
you probably shouldn't
treat her like that.

486
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,612
I'm not trying to win her over.

487
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:27,757
Then don't lead her on.

488
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:34,857
Andie.

489
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:36,424
- Hey.
- What's going on?

490
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,300
I wanted to apologize
for earlier today.

491
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:40,805
It wasn't anything personal.

492
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:44,434
I had a really rough day
and I was joking.

493
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,604
Oh, please.
It's not like I sit up at night

494
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,444
and think about what
you do or don't say to me,

495
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,677
but thanks.

496
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:54,777
- I feel better now.
- Let me give you a ride.

497
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,515
Make it up to you.

498
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:00,685
I can just take the bus.

499
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,729
No, come on. My car's
gotta smell better than the bus.

500
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:33,819
- There she is.
- She come when we're done.

501
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:35,690
She missed
the whole rehearsal.

502
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,955
Hey, guys.

503
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:40,692
Miss thing girl. Where you been at?
What's the deal?

504
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,893
Thank you for gracing us
with your presence.

505
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:46,802
- Rehearsal's done.
- Hey, hey, come on.

506
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,864
I got here as soon as I could.
You know what's been going on.

507
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,877
No, I don't, but I'll tell you
what's been going on.

508
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:56,381
Everybody's been asking,
"Have you talked to D? Where's D at?"

509
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:59,316
I'm looking like an ass
making stuff up for you,

510
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,683
so you can go dance around
your fancy new school.

511
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:04,188
- What is your problem?
- What's going on here?

512
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:06,588
- Ask her.
- What was that?

513
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,160
I said, "Ask her."

514
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,219
D, you gotta tell me something?

515
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:16,525
Yeah, the reason I've been late
and haven't been around much

516
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,263
is because...

517
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,369
...l've been going to school at MSA.

518
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:26,172
So you've been lying to me
and the crew for what?

519
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,645
- Those ballet boys?
- I don't have a choice.

520
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:31,911
No, that's messed up, D. We're family.

521
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:34,612
I thought you said
you understood that.

522
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:37,212
The Four-one-oh
don't come second to nobody.

523
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:40,452
- You out.
- No, please, Tuck, come on.

524
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:43,188
It's just been a crazy time.

525
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,594
It's always been a crazy time with you.

526
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,131
Yo, let's go.

527
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:18,057
- Oh!
- Hey, watch yourself, huh?

528
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,224
God...

529
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,496
Morning, sunshine.

530
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:28,968
The good times just keep on
coming, don't they?

531
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:30,441
Ouch.

532
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:33,674
- What got into you today?
- What?

533
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:36,772
As opposed to my winning charm
every other day?

534
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:38,783
Fair enough. Two points to the new girl.

535
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:47,322
You want to talk about it?

536
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:54,765
- I got kicked out of my crew.
- What for?

537
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,325
For being here.

538
00:38:57,403 --> 00:39:00,804
I can't believe I messed this up.

539
00:39:00,873 --> 00:39:04,206
They're the ones that messed up.
They lost an amazing dancer.

540
00:39:05,878 --> 00:39:07,505
You should just start your own crew.

541
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,844
No, you can't just start your own crew.

542
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:12,942
- Why not?
- Because you can't.

543
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:17,879
- Besides, who would be in it? Me and...
- Me.

544
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:21,554
- Us.
- OK. We'll just start our own crew.

545
00:39:23,596 --> 00:39:25,223
What else you gonna do?

546
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:28,062
Nobody here is gonna step out
of their perfect world.

547
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:31,228
Not the Sophie Donovans, but
there's a lot going on under the radar.

548
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:32,965
Really?

549
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,064
There's this guy we call Hair.

550
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:37,609
He's this half hippy,
half rhythmic rebel

551
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:39,508
and he makes the sickest beats.

552
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,308
Teachers don't know
what to do with him.

553
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:45,181
Can't put him in a class, gets bored,
makes up his own steps.

554
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,686
There's Kido. She's this
foreign exchange student

555
00:39:49,756 --> 00:39:51,724
obsessed with old-school
American hip hop.

556
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:54,885
And, trust me, she doesn't need
English to speak our language.

557
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,160
Fly's the quiet one,
but not when the music's on.

558
00:40:03,236 --> 00:40:07,036
She's too tall to partner, but when
you're that good, who needs a partner?

559
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:14,303
Which brings us to Monster,
our resident stunt double.

560
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,314
He flips, he slides, he falls.

561
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:19,351
Whatever you need to make
an action sequence work onstage.

562
00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:21,881
But he never gets the spotlight.

563
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:31,355
Most know my boy, Cable,
as the video yearbook editor.

564
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,762
But little do they know,

565
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:35,767
he's one of the best freestyle dancers
I've seen in my life.

566
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,768
And, finally, Smiles.
Nicest guy you'll ever meet.

567
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:44,901
Dopest dancer on the dance floor.

568
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:47,445
Unfortunately, MSA only sees
what it wants to see.

569
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:53,946
- Don't forget Moose.
- Moose?

570
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,319
- Yeah, trust me on this one.
- Come on.

571
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,018
But what makes you
think they'll do it?

572
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:01,855
They all have nothing to lose.

573
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:03,418
No!

574
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:05,361
You guys, listen up. Check it out.

575
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:09,360
Now, I know each and every one
of you knows what it's like

576
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:13,235
to be forced to conform
and become an MSA robot, right?

577
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:15,774
Yeah, they wanted me to cut my hair.

578
00:41:15,842 --> 00:41:16,968
Yeah, and fix my teeth.

579
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:18,806
- I like your teeth.
- Thank you.

580
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:20,539
I like your accent.

581
00:41:20,613 --> 00:41:22,012
What kind of accent?

582
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:24,106
The accent you have.
You have an accent.

583
00:41:24,183 --> 00:41:25,946
- I have no accent.
- It's really strong.

584
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:27,349
That's my point.

585
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,184
I know that each one of you guys
has an amazing talent

586
00:41:30,256 --> 00:41:32,281
that this school doesn't know
what to do with.

587
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:34,952
I think it's time we do
something with that talent.

588
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:36,688
- Like what?
- Like form a crew

589
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:38,161
and compete at The Streets.

590
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:40,495
- No, no!
- I heard it's dangerous.

591
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:43,433
Forget about what you heard.

592
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:46,836
The Streets is about the best dance crew
showing off what they got.

593
00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:49,306
- We don't stand a chance.
- What are you talking about?

594
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,366
I've seen you do stunts
in the school play.

595
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:53,105
There's a reason
they call you Monster.

596
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,168
Like this?

597
00:41:55,381 --> 00:41:57,849
- That was hot.
- That's crazy.

598
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,715
Kido, you went crazy at the showcase
after-party last year.

599
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:02,219
Oh, that was fun.

600
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:05,920
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey.

601
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:08,426
- Get it, Kido.
- She won't... She won't stop.

602
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:10,985
She won't stop, she won't.
You need to stop.

603
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:13,156
- So when is it?
- That's the thing.

604
00:42:13,232 --> 00:42:16,690
Nobody knows when or where
until a text message of the night of.

605
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,828
So we have got to be ready.

606
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:22,170
Sounds good. Director Collins'd
never let us rehearse here.

607
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:25,540
- No way.
- Who said Director Collins has to know?

608
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:27,875
- Wow.
- He's got the keys.

609
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:29,244
Borrowed and copied.

610
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:32,250
MSA after hours. I like it.

611
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:38,942
Yeah! Oh, man, we did good.

612
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:45,209
What do you say we go
and check out our competition?

613
00:44:46,886 --> 00:44:49,218
All right,
let's get it started right now!

614
00:44:49,288 --> 00:44:52,689
Whoo! Oh, man! Put your hands up.

615
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:55,958
Put your hands up. I see you, baby!

616
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:58,053
Want your mama again?

617
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,564
Hey, yo, Leesh.
Leesh, look, look, look, look.

618
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:01,998
- Andie's here.
- Where?

619
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:03,399
Right there.

620
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:06,536
She shouldn't be.

621
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,538
Yo, what you doing here, man?

622
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:17,013
Oh, please don't tell me
that's your new crew.

623
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:19,313
- No.
- Yeah, we're her crew.

624
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:21,410
Getting ready to battle at The Streets.

625
00:45:21,487 --> 00:45:23,352
What street, Sesame Street?

626
00:45:23,422 --> 00:45:26,220
- What do you know about The Streets?
- Why don't you back off?

627
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:28,157
We're just here
to check a few things out.

628
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:32,857
This is how you've been wasting
your time, with these losers?

629
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:35,400
Why don't you do your thing?
We're gonna do ours.

630
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:37,402
You got a thing that you do?

631
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,563
Why don't you show us now, homeboy?

632
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:43,364
- All right, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

633
00:45:46,612 --> 00:45:49,775
Hey, yo, DJ Sand!
Drop that beat, homey.

634
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,010
Looks like we've got new fish in town.

635
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:55,542
Let's clear the dance floor.
See what they talking about.

636
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:58,852
Now, you come into my house,
you recognize what's going on.

637
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:01,256
Don't step in that circle
if you ain't got it.

638
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,234
When do we start?

639
00:46:10,302 --> 00:46:12,270
Five. Start on five when I start.

640
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:16,707
The music's playing already.
Dance to the music.

641
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,180
That's not how we do it here.

642
00:46:27,253 --> 00:46:29,118
<i>This ain't High School Musical.</i>

643
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:33,658
That's how you dance?
Your mama taught you that?

644
00:46:33,726 --> 00:46:35,193
We don't dance like that.

645
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:37,559
That's what you learned
at your special school?

646
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,894
Boo! Quit it!

647
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,762
That's atrocious.

648
00:46:41,834 --> 00:46:43,927
That's it. No more.

649
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:47,700
No more.
What in the hell was that?

650
00:46:48,941 --> 00:46:50,806
That's how you dance?
I'll tell you what.

651
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,844
We gonna show you
how we really get down.

652
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:54,777
Y'all pick up a keychain
on the way out.

653
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:57,577
Tell your mama not to be late
picking you up from work.

654
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,618
You guys are garbage!

655
00:46:59,685 --> 00:47:03,018
Lets get it. Four-one-oh,
can we get it started?

656
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:04,919
Let's get it started. Here we go.

657
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,481
Four-one-oh, forget them.
Let's get it.

658
00:47:23,442 --> 00:47:26,036
That's what I'm talking about.

659
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:28,170
See how they entertaining?

660
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,507
That's how we do it.

661
00:48:01,147 --> 00:48:03,342
You can't learn that in school!

662
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,646
Let's just...
Let's just regroup tomorrow.

663
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:08,686
Come on.

664
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:11,892
Guys, come on.
This is one performance.

665
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,122
Guys, come on.
This is one performance.

666
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:15,593
You can't let it get you down.

667
00:48:15,662 --> 00:48:18,222
We didn't work
this hard to just give up.

668
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:20,789
Shouldn't have
went there in the first place.

669
00:48:20,867 --> 00:48:22,095
We looked like idiots.

670
00:48:22,168 --> 00:48:25,069
Chase, the choreography
wasn't right for this.

671
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:27,163
No, it wasn't.

672
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,229
I'm telling you.

673
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:34,880
- Hey.
- It's cool. I know her.

674
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:40,109
What are you doing here?

675
00:48:40,186 --> 00:48:41,744
Things got out of hand last night.

676
00:48:41,821 --> 00:48:43,618
Yeah. Thanks for your support.

677
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,453
Look, I'm sorry.

678
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:47,425
What they did to you was wrong.

679
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:50,122
- But you should know that I quit.
- What?

680
00:48:50,196 --> 00:48:53,222
Yeah. They're on such
a power trip. I refuse.

681
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,564
I thought we were supposed
to be about family.

682
00:48:55,635 --> 00:48:57,933
And it just wasn't
the same without you.

683
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:03,075
But, look, I miss you.
I haven't seen you in that long.

684
00:49:03,143 --> 00:49:05,304
My family's having
a barbeque this Saturday.

685
00:49:05,378 --> 00:49:06,743
Why don't you come through?

686
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:10,249
- So that's why you came by?
- Yeah.

687
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,287
You know, Felicia is going to
trip if she knows you're here.

688
00:49:16,356 --> 00:49:19,086
Felicia should be the last
of your worries right now.

689
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,061
I swear, we're really not that bad.

690
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:24,596
Really. Come on.

691
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:32,732
Hey, you guys,
this is my girl, Missy.

692
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:36,708
She's here to, uh... help us out.

693
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:39,506
Help us out?
We bombed last night.

694
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:41,604
Our respect
went out the window.

695
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:43,774
Sure did.

696
00:49:49,756 --> 00:49:51,883
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

697
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,791
What are y'all talking about,
respect went out the window?

698
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:57,557
Like respect is going?
You can always get it back.

699
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,461
What are you all thinking
for The Prank?

700
00:49:59,532 --> 00:50:01,500
What's The Prank?

701
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:05,527
Yo, D, you ain't tell them
about The Prank?

702
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:08,870
The Prank is what the crews do to show
they're competing for The Streets.

703
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:12,105
It's a public declaration
saying that you're bringing it.

704
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:13,543
The crazier it is, the better.

705
00:50:13,613 --> 00:50:16,013
For proof you gotta record it
and post it online.

706
00:50:16,082 --> 00:50:18,175
Then it spreads like wildfire.

707
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:22,915
And if you guys hit it like I know
you can, y'all get your respect back.

708
00:50:24,524 --> 00:50:26,185
I got an idea.

709
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:29,888
Watch this, watch this! Oh-ho!

710
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:32,261
Been runnin' that ball
on him all day, son.

711
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:34,266
That's what I'm talkin' about.

712
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:35,995
- Yo, man.
- Yo!

713
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:39,197
Why's my crib smell like Funyuns,
broccoli and ball sweat?

714
00:50:39,272 --> 00:50:42,298
It's your boy, Crumbs.
He's been letting it loose all day.

715
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,899
It's the coffee, bro.

716
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,714
Yo, Tuck, come see this.
You gotta come see this, bro.

717
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:42,418
Oh, dang!

718
00:52:42,495 --> 00:52:44,827
- Relax, relax.
- That's my computer, man!

719
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,268
Man, clean this fish up!

720
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:22,724
Moose, what are you doing?

721
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:25,669
Maybe we should put you back
in that grandma suit, huh?

722
00:53:25,738 --> 00:53:27,501
Who's we?

723
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:41,012
Hey, what are you guys doing?

724
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:44,147
- Hi, Sophie. What's up?
- Rehearsing for the fundraiser.

725
00:53:45,158 --> 00:53:46,648
Why are you here on a Saturday?

726
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:49,559
We were gonna do the same thing,
but it's locked.

727
00:53:49,629 --> 00:53:52,427
- We gotta roll, so we'll see y'all.
- Where are we going?

728
00:53:52,498 --> 00:53:55,331
To my house. My family's
having a barbecue, remember?

729
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:57,801
- Yeah, yeah, barbecue.
- Why you standing there?

730
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:58,859
Let's be out.

731
00:54:03,276 --> 00:54:04,607
Are you going with them?

732
00:54:05,612 --> 00:54:09,139
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'd say you should go, but...

733
00:54:09,215 --> 00:54:11,149
But I'm not really sure
it's your scene.

734
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:13,778
I'd love to.

735
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:16,447
All right.

745
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:56,390
I can't believe I'm doing this.

746
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:58,453
What's wrong with what I had before?

747
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:01,364
Latin men like their girls
to look like women, not boys.

748
00:55:01,434 --> 00:55:03,834
A fact you'll appreciate
when you meet my cousin.

749
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:05,461
You are not setting me up.

750
00:55:05,538 --> 00:55:08,006
Alejandro's nice. Plus he just got here.

751
00:55:08,074 --> 00:55:10,338
You're pimping me out
so that your cousin

752
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,604
can get a green card?

753
00:55:11,678 --> 00:55:13,373
He's from Florida.

754
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:16,643
Trust me, if he was not my cousin,
you would not be standing there.

755
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:19,276
- You're sick.
- Hmm.

756
00:55:19,352 --> 00:55:21,252
And I'm hungry,
so are we done here?

757
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:22,583
I guess.

758
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:25,886
Ooh, Miss Thing, you got titties?

759
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:28,620
Why you trying to look
better than me at my party?

760
00:55:37,003 --> 00:55:38,595
- Hey, cuz.
- Hey, mama.

761
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:40,798
How you doing?
This is my friend, Andie.

762
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:42,534
Andie, my cousin, Alejandro.

763
00:55:42,608 --> 00:55:44,769
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

764
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:46,903
I'm just gonna sit down
while you guys talk.

765
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:49,311
- You want to dance a real dance?
- I'd love to.

766
00:55:49,382 --> 00:55:50,508
Come on, mama.

767
00:56:13,906 --> 00:56:17,535
- May I borrow your boyfriend?
- Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

768
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,579
It doesn't matter. It's just a dance.

769
00:56:20,646 --> 00:56:21,977
It's just a dance.

770
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:10,058
Andie, come here.

771
00:57:10,129 --> 00:57:11,824
You should really wait your turn.

772
00:57:11,898 --> 00:57:15,061
- Ooh.
- I couldn't.

773
00:57:15,134 --> 00:57:17,102
I didn't know you could salsa.

774
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,831
There's a lot you don't know about me.

775
00:57:18,905 --> 00:57:22,204
Which is surprising, considering
how much you talk about yourself.

776
00:57:22,275 --> 00:57:23,264
Ooh.

777
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:26,699
What's going on over here?

778
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:46,715
My goodness, Aunt Maria.
It has been emotional.

779
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:49,386
I'll hit you up on MySpace sometime.

780
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:51,396
Thank you. You are charming.

781
00:58:51,464 --> 00:58:53,728
- Thank you so much.
- I had a good time.

782
00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:56,097
Me, too. Don't tell
your husband about us, now.

783
00:58:56,168 --> 00:58:59,865
- Bye.
- Hey.

784
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:05,506
God?

785
00:59:05,578 --> 00:59:08,547
You want to fly up here and give me
a hand with these lights?

786
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:12,274
Sophie, what's up, girl?
Let me find out.

787
00:59:12,351 --> 00:59:15,514
<i>You got a lot of stuff going.
A lot of sofrito up in you.</i>

788
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:17,920
Thank you.
You're not so bad yourself.

789
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,687
<i>Gracias, gracias.
Moose, help me with these lights.</i>

790
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:23,422
Mom's gonna kill me. Hurry up.

791
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:26,761
- Hurry up!
- Hold this. I'm coming.

792
00:59:28,668 --> 00:59:30,158
Sophie, I'll do it, I'll do it.

793
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:32,704
I'll do it. You're welcome.

794
00:59:33,906 --> 00:59:36,431
- There we go.
- This is really high.

795
00:59:36,509 --> 00:59:38,773
No, it's not that bad.

796
00:59:40,212 --> 00:59:43,943
- Yes, it is.
- No, we're good.

797
00:59:44,016 --> 00:59:47,884
All right. Tree climber.

798
00:59:50,323 --> 00:59:53,019
All right, this is gonna
sound cheesy, but...

799
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:59,927
...for what it's worth,
I'm really glad you're at MSA.

800
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:04,192
I think you were doing
just fine before I got there.

801
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:07,398
That's just the thing.
I mean, I've been trained to dance

802
01:00:07,473 --> 01:00:09,805
since I first learned to walk.

803
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:14,335
But it's always been about
doing it their way and it's just not me.

804
01:00:14,413 --> 01:00:19,350
But, ever since you came,
I feel more like myself.

805
01:00:23,222 --> 01:00:25,554
Oh, geez.

806
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:30,295
Well, I know what you mean.

807
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:35,428
My mom always used to tell me,
"Just be yourself."

808
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,233
When I was little
that sounded strange,

809
01:00:39,305 --> 01:00:41,773
'cause I was like,
"How could I be anyone else?"

810
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:46,567
- I bet you miss her.
- Yeah.

811
01:00:51,851 --> 01:00:56,185
When she got cancer, it was like
the floor fell from underneath.

812
01:00:56,255 --> 01:00:58,883
I've just been running ever since.

813
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:01,358
But now I can't find my way back.

814
01:01:04,997 --> 01:01:08,489
Well, maybe it's not about going back.

815
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:11,695
Maybe it's about being
right where you are.

816
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:49,037
I heard you was
dancing it up in there.

817
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:51,235
What, you not joking now?

818
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:54,411
Come on, guys,
I'm just trying to get home.

819
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,711
You thought it was real funny,
what you did the other day.

820
01:01:57,783 --> 01:02:00,274
- Tuck, it's a joke.
- Look here.

821
01:02:00,352 --> 01:02:03,446
Just 'cause you hang out with D
don't mean you got what it takes.

822
01:02:03,522 --> 01:02:05,353
She don't know where she came from.

823
01:02:05,424 --> 01:02:07,517
You don't know anything about her.

824
01:02:09,028 --> 01:02:11,553
So now you defending her?

825
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,757
Yes, I am.
I'll see you at The Streets.

826
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:16,631
At The Streets?
You in the streets now.

827
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:23,802
Unless you want some more of us,

828
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:25,867
I suggest you stay away
from The Streets.

829
01:02:25,945 --> 01:02:29,108
And stay farther away from Andie.
Drop this fool.

830
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:34,613
Come on, get up, fool.

831
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:35,984
Get up!

832
01:02:36,055 --> 01:02:37,920
Yeah. Ha.

833
01:02:37,991 --> 01:02:39,788
You're not so funny now,

834
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:41,053
are you, clown?

835
01:02:41,127 --> 01:02:43,288
Hey, yo, Tuck.

836
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:05,483
Hey.

837
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:08,418
- Chase, what's going on?
- Hey.

838
01:03:09,255 --> 01:03:10,483
- Hi.
- Hi.

839
01:03:10,556 --> 01:03:14,549
How you doing? Is everything OK?

840
01:03:15,561 --> 01:03:18,428
Yes, everything's OK.
Why wouldn't everything be OK?

841
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,901
- Oh, my God. What happened to you?
- Nothing. Nothing.

842
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,336
Don't worry. Listen,
I've got to get to class.

843
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:29,341
That is not nothing.
Who did this to you?

844
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:32,867
Just forget about it. Let it go.

845
01:03:54,734 --> 01:03:55,996
Who did this?

846
01:04:30,169 --> 01:04:33,002
Does anybody know
who is responsible for this?

847
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:41,244
This school will not be associated
with these competitions.

848
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:43,179
Any future involvement

849
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:45,945
by our students in The Streets
will lead to expulsion.

850
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:51,719
And anyone with any information
is expected to come forward.

851
01:04:53,092 --> 01:04:54,923
Get this place cleaned up.

852
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:04,026
Man, I can't believe
they trashed the studio.

853
01:05:04,103 --> 01:05:05,968
Now we have Director Collins
on our back.

854
01:05:06,038 --> 01:05:08,836
- Glass is all over the floor.
- Somebody broke the stereo.

855
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:10,466
I don't understand.

856
01:05:10,543 --> 01:05:12,067
These guys are no joke.

857
01:05:12,145 --> 01:05:13,703
Collins was pissed.

858
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,374
- Graffiti was everywhere.
- What are we gonna do?

859
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:19,111
- We could get expelled.
- My parents would kill me

860
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:20,174
if I got expelled.

861
01:05:20,253 --> 01:05:23,017
I'd have to go to a regular school
with regular kids.

862
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:25,284
Hey, guys.

863
01:05:27,126 --> 01:05:29,390
This has gotten way out of hand.

864
01:05:30,897 --> 01:05:33,058
I'm really sorry
that I got you all into this.

865
01:05:33,132 --> 01:05:35,123
Andie, don't say that.

866
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:37,465
I put everything you guys
worked for at risk.

867
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:39,402
And it's not fair.

868
01:05:39,472 --> 01:05:42,908
- We're all in on this together.
- Yeah, yeah.

869
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:45,034
No, it's over.

870
01:05:47,346 --> 01:05:51,680
The crew's done. I don't know
what we were thinking.

871
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:54,379
Andie West, Director Collins
would like to see you.

872
01:06:17,543 --> 01:06:20,239
By being involved in this
you've brought delinquent

873
01:06:20,313 --> 01:06:22,975
behavior into my school
and put my students at risk.

874
01:06:23,049 --> 01:06:25,517
And now the studio
has been vandalized.

875
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,178
It wasn't exactly like that.

876
01:06:30,189 --> 01:06:32,248
I thought I could train you,

877
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:34,953
turn you into the dancer
that you could be.

878
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:38,187
But I was wrong.

879
01:06:38,264 --> 01:06:40,391
There's nothing
that we can do for someone

880
01:06:40,466 --> 01:06:42,957
who doesn't appreciate
what's in front of them.

881
01:06:44,403 --> 01:06:45,665
I understand.

882
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:53,269
You know, I really did try.

883
01:06:58,584 --> 01:06:59,812
I'm not done.

884
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:05,056
Was there anyone else involved
from this school?

885
01:07:07,093 --> 01:07:08,219
No.

886
01:07:10,363 --> 01:07:12,797
No one else. Just me.

887
01:07:12,865 --> 01:07:15,163
Then I have no choice
but to expel you.

888
01:07:15,234 --> 01:07:17,395
- But I didn't...
- I'm sorry.

889
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:20,200
That's it. I'm finished. Please leave.

890
01:07:31,017 --> 01:07:32,848
Andie.

891
01:07:32,919 --> 01:07:35,319
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

892
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:38,414
- What are we gonna do?
- It's done.

893
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:39,981
Everything's done.

894
01:07:41,527 --> 01:07:44,394
I think it's pretty clear that
none of this was meant to be.

895
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:46,655
Whoa, Andie.

896
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:49,027
Don't do this.

897
01:07:52,405 --> 01:07:54,430
Please just... Just let it go.

898
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:07,016
- You got that?
- Mm-hmm

899
01:08:07,086 --> 01:08:09,077
You're my big strong boy, huh?

900
01:08:09,155 --> 01:08:11,146
I am your big strong boy.

901
01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:24,961
Your school called.

902
01:08:25,037 --> 01:08:27,062
I know I said things
would be different...

903
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:28,197
I know what happened.

904
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:31,300
No more excuses, Andie.
I'm sick and tired of this.

905
01:08:31,377 --> 01:08:35,677
You're going to your aunt's
in Texas, and that's final.

906
01:08:40,987 --> 01:08:42,921
It was my idea.

907
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:45,649
- Your idea for what?
- To compete in The Streets.

908
01:08:45,725 --> 01:08:48,922
If you're gonna throw someone out
it should have been me.

909
01:08:48,995 --> 01:08:51,361
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not throwing you out.

910
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:52,988
How would that make me look?

911
01:08:53,065 --> 01:08:55,090
I'm not gonna let her
take the fall for this.

912
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,759
I should never have let her in.

913
01:08:56,836 --> 01:08:59,464
It didn't benefit us in any way.

914
01:08:59,538 --> 01:09:01,938
Not everything we do has to benefit us.

915
01:09:02,008 --> 01:09:06,001
Some people, Andie in particular,
do what they love just because.

916
01:09:06,078 --> 01:09:08,444
Isn't that why we started dancing
in the first place?

917
01:09:08,514 --> 01:09:11,847
Look, I have a lot to do
for the fundraiser.

918
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,282
And so do you.

919
01:09:13,352 --> 01:09:17,311
My decision about Andie is final.
We're done here.

920
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,127
Oh, Peggy Beckham.

921
01:12:34,186 --> 01:12:36,313
See, this is our new building.

922
01:12:36,388 --> 01:12:38,720
Made of glass
with state-of-the-art studios.

923
01:13:36,282 --> 01:13:37,442
Hey. Is Andie here?

924
01:13:39,052 --> 01:13:40,883
Andie?

925
01:13:40,954 --> 01:13:42,387
It's for you.

926
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,228
- What are you guys doing here?
- Andie, we're going.

927
01:13:50,296 --> 01:13:53,356
Eighth and Main, The Streets.
We need you.

928
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:55,264
No, but what about the fundraiser?

929
01:13:55,335 --> 01:13:57,769
- You could all be expelled.
- Forget the fundraiser.

930
01:13:57,837 --> 01:14:00,533
- We don't want the school to move.
- It's time we took a stand.

931
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,734
- Like you did.
- If MSA doesn't want you...

932
01:14:02,809 --> 01:14:05,710
- Then we don't want you.
- What are you talking about?

933
01:14:05,778 --> 01:14:09,270
We do want Andie.
We want Andie in, yes, right?

934
01:14:09,349 --> 01:14:12,250
- Yes.
- Look, you brought us together

935
01:14:12,318 --> 01:14:15,185
and took the fall for us
when we should have all done more.

936
01:14:15,255 --> 01:14:17,189
Andie, that's why we're here.

937
01:14:17,257 --> 01:14:20,192
We've all made a lot of mistakes,
but now's our time.

938
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,888
We can go all the way.
If we don't try, it was all for nothing.

939
01:14:22,962 --> 01:14:24,623
Come on, are you in?

940
01:14:25,665 --> 01:14:27,360
- I can't.
- Why?

941
01:14:27,433 --> 01:14:29,833
I promised Sarah
I'd finish packing tonight.

942
01:14:29,902 --> 01:14:31,301
Andie?

943
01:14:33,072 --> 01:14:34,266
Can we talk a minute?

944
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:38,276
Yeah. I'll be right back.

945
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:47,549
I made a promise to your mom
to take care of you.

946
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,678
I want to keep it.

947
01:14:49,856 --> 01:14:51,881
I know.

948
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:55,155
I understand that
and I am done fighting.

949
01:14:56,963 --> 01:14:59,761
You know, you remind me
so much of your mother.

950
01:14:59,832 --> 01:15:02,300
You have her passion.

951
01:15:02,368 --> 01:15:05,667
She was a really good friend
to me, Andie.

952
01:15:05,738 --> 01:15:08,935
Just like you are to them.

953
01:15:09,008 --> 01:15:12,307
I just feel like I finally found
this place where I belong.

954
01:15:14,447 --> 01:15:16,244
I found people who believe in me.

955
01:15:16,316 --> 01:15:19,342
I believe in you, too.

956
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:21,819
I've seen a change in you.

957
01:15:25,358 --> 01:15:26,950
You should go tonight.

958
01:15:29,929 --> 01:15:31,157
Really?

959
01:15:33,266 --> 01:15:34,790
She'd want you to.

960
01:15:39,605 --> 01:15:43,063
Let's do this.

961
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,748
Baltimore, y'all ready?

962
01:15:52,919 --> 01:15:55,615
We gonna get down to it,
see who has the hottest skills.

963
01:15:55,688 --> 01:15:58,486
The dopest squad.
You ready to get it started?

964
01:15:58,558 --> 01:16:00,492
It's The Streets, baby.

965
01:16:04,764 --> 01:16:06,994
- Take a left.
- And slow down.

966
01:16:07,066 --> 01:16:09,534
Faster, faster! I love America!

967
01:16:13,539 --> 01:16:14,733
Whoo!

968
01:16:32,492 --> 01:16:35,359
It's your man, DJ Sand,
and it's the battle of the year.

969
01:16:35,428 --> 01:16:37,692
We're getting ready to get
really banoodles out here.

970
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:39,356
Can y'all handle that?

971
01:16:40,867 --> 01:16:43,768
Come on, let's get wild, man.

972
01:16:43,836 --> 01:16:45,463
Yo, man, you see this?

973
01:16:49,142 --> 01:16:52,839
- Are you coming?
- Good luck. Good luck.

974
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:05,815
What part of "You don't belong here"
do you not understand?

975
01:17:05,892 --> 01:17:07,359
Why don't you chill?

976
01:17:07,427 --> 01:17:09,861
We're just trying to perform here
like everyone else.

977
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:11,726
Yo, homey, this is how it is.

978
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:15,063
You're not invited.
This is a closed event.

979
01:17:15,134 --> 01:17:17,034
For locals only.

980
01:17:17,103 --> 01:17:19,765
Besides, that jazz funk
that y'all pulled at the Dragon

981
01:17:19,839 --> 01:17:21,033
ain't gonna cut it here.

982
01:17:21,107 --> 01:17:23,974
Neither will those moves
you've been doing the past five years.

983
01:17:24,043 --> 01:17:26,068
And by the way,
I really liked your place,

984
01:17:26,145 --> 01:17:28,545
but I think that fish
made it smell better.

985
01:17:28,614 --> 01:17:31,139
Watch your face.
I'll knock you out, you hear?

986
01:17:31,217 --> 01:17:34,118
- Don't disrespect me in my place.
- You boys fighting in my house now?

987
01:17:34,187 --> 01:17:35,882
You're think you're funny?

988
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:38,822
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

989
01:17:38,891 --> 01:17:40,586
They're at The Streets.

990
01:17:41,861 --> 01:17:43,123
The Streets?

991
01:17:44,697 --> 01:17:46,460
- I have to stop this.
- Wait.

992
01:17:48,701 --> 01:17:51,636
You always tell us that dance
is about having something to say.

993
01:17:51,704 --> 01:17:52,966
I never meant for anyone...

994
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:56,099
I think that a lot of people
are finally speaking up.

995
01:17:56,175 --> 01:17:59,667
Can't allow my students
to participate in something illegal.

996
01:17:59,745 --> 01:18:02,213
Well, there's a reason
they're there and not here.

997
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,518
You should take a look.
I think you'd be surprised.

998
01:18:06,586 --> 01:18:09,316
- And you are?
- Robert Alexander, III.

999
01:18:09,388 --> 01:18:12,016
But you can call me Moose.
I dance with their crew.

1000
01:18:12,091 --> 01:18:13,251
You dance?

1001
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:17,486
Damn right, I dance.
I can take you to where they are.

1002
01:18:17,563 --> 01:18:19,258
OK, Goose, let's go.

1003
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:21,664
- No, it's Moose.
- Whatever.

1004
01:18:21,734 --> 01:18:23,099
Wait. I'm coming with you.

1005
01:18:23,169 --> 01:18:25,729
It's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1006
01:18:25,805 --> 01:18:29,764
At this time, let me introduce
the five time reigning champ.

1007
01:18:29,842 --> 01:18:35,178
Give it up, make some noise,
for the Four-one-oh!

1008
01:18:48,728 --> 01:18:51,128
Get it, Four-one-oh, let's go!

1009
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:21,814
Let's go!

1010
01:21:12,672 --> 01:21:13,506
Check it out, baby!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

1011
01:21:13,506 --> 01:21:15,701
Check it out, baby!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

1012
01:21:15,775 --> 01:21:18,369
Give it up to the Four-one-oh!

1013
01:21:18,444 --> 01:21:20,309
All right, you've seen 'em all.

1014
01:21:20,379 --> 01:21:22,973
Tell me who the hottest crew
in Baltimore is.

1015
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:25,984
That's what you think? I don't know,
the Four-one-oh killed it.

1016
01:21:26,052 --> 01:21:28,850
- All right, y'all, let's hit it.
- Yo, baby.

1017
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:31,822
No, B, we're from the hood.

1018
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:34,917
Yo, this is a neighborhood battle.

1019
01:21:34,994 --> 01:21:38,725
You're out of luck.
Now, go home. Leave.

1020
01:21:38,798 --> 01:21:40,026
That's mad wack, B.

1021
01:21:40,099 --> 01:21:43,125
We're gonna get to it,
figure it out after this.

1022
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:48,533
Andie!

1023
01:21:52,445 --> 01:21:55,141
Hey, yo, it's not done yet.
We've got one more for you.

1024
01:21:55,214 --> 01:21:58,377
- My crew's back there. We want a shot.
- We're done. Doesn't matter.

1025
01:21:58,451 --> 01:22:00,316
Not from around here,
but we want a shot.

1026
01:22:00,386 --> 01:22:02,013
Hey!

1027
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:04,852
- Yo!
- Boo!

1028
01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:06,824
Look.

1029
01:22:06,892 --> 01:22:09,383
We're all here because...

1030
01:22:09,462 --> 01:22:13,694
All right, all right.
Yo. Some of you guys think...

1031
01:22:13,766 --> 01:22:16,166
Some of you guys think
that we don't belong here.

1032
01:22:16,235 --> 01:22:19,068
- What is she doing?
- It doesn't matter where we're from.

1033
01:22:19,138 --> 01:22:21,333
You are not the valedictorian.

1034
01:22:21,407 --> 01:22:23,705
All right, all right.

1035
01:22:23,776 --> 01:22:26,006
Let me just say something.

1036
01:22:26,078 --> 01:22:30,208
The Streets are supposed to be about
different people coming together.

1037
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:34,643
We call this a battle,
but what are we fighting for?

1038
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,587
We're all here because we have
this thing we do. We dance.

1039
01:22:37,656 --> 01:22:39,248
Right?

1040
01:22:39,325 --> 01:22:42,726
Being a part of The Street
used to mean more than turf or power.

1041
01:22:42,795 --> 01:22:45,491
It was about bringing
something new to the floor.

1042
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:50,057
And it shouldn't matter what we wear,

1043
01:22:50,136 --> 01:22:52,400
what school
or what neighborhood we're from.

1044
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:56,373
Because the best part of The Streets
is, it's not about what you've got.

1045
01:22:56,442 --> 01:22:58,774
It's what you make of what you've got.

1046
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:07,043
So, if the Four-one-oh is too scared
to defend their title against us,

1047
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:11,078
then, hell, we'll be outside doing
our thing where The Streets started.

1048
01:23:13,726 --> 01:23:15,557
We'll accept that.

1049
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:36,842
I'm sure we've got something
that will work.

1050
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:38,611
- La-da!
- Ooh!

1051
01:23:40,219 --> 01:23:42,050
Hit it, hit it, hit it.

1052
01:27:23,242 --> 01:27:24,675
Go, go, go!

1053
01:28:32,311 --> 01:28:34,142
Yeah, we did it, baby.

1054
01:28:34,213 --> 01:28:36,044
Whoo-hoo!

1055
01:28:39,151 --> 01:28:41,813
All right! Whoo!

1056
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:56,635
Well. That was different.

1057
01:28:56,702 --> 01:28:59,967
Yes, sorry about
the whole toe-pointing thing.

1058
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:02,599
Yeah. I guess that
didn't stick too well.

1059
01:29:02,675 --> 01:29:04,006
I'll keep working on that.

1060
01:29:04,076 --> 01:29:07,307
Yeah, you will, in my class.
At school on Monday.

1061
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,779
Oh, my God!

1062
01:29:08,848 --> 01:29:11,612
Whoa. Hey, Moose!

1063
01:29:11,684 --> 01:29:13,515
Yeah, you.

1064
01:29:13,586 --> 01:29:16,987
I think you might be
in the wrong department.

1065
01:29:17,957 --> 01:29:19,857
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1066
01:29:19,925 --> 01:29:22,689
I have a little explaining to do
at a fundraiser.

1067
01:29:22,762 --> 01:29:24,093
Oh, yeah.

1068
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:29,433
So, see, I told you
we could help each other out.

1069
01:29:29,502 --> 01:29:31,493
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

1070
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:33,333
Whatever.

1071
01:29:36,676 --> 01:29:38,439
Blow it up.

1072
01:29:38,511 --> 01:29:42,174
- Moose, hey.
- Hey, Soph.

1073
01:29:42,248 --> 01:29:43,840
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1074
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:45,611
- Did you see us?
- That was great.

1075
01:29:45,685 --> 01:29:48,552
Sliding and flipping.
My hat trick was amazing.

1076
01:29:48,621 --> 01:29:52,113
I was just doing it,
like it was amazing.

1077
01:29:56,762 --> 01:29:58,730
That's what I thought.

1078
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:08,035
Andie! Andie!

1079
01:30:08,107 --> 01:30:09,369
Hey!

1080
01:30:09,442 --> 01:30:11,307
Happy birthday.
Open your present.

1081
01:30:11,377 --> 01:30:12,503
Blow out your candles.

1082
01:30:12,578 --> 01:30:14,409
You did so good.
I'm so proud of you.

1083
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,972
- Andie, I love you.
- I love you.

1084
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:21,451
I gotta go.
I gotta pump. I gotta pump.

1085
01:30:36,469 --> 01:30:38,835
I thought you said we couldn't
start our own crew.

1086
01:30:38,904 --> 01:30:41,429
I thought you said
my dancing was little.

1087
01:30:42,842 --> 01:30:45,307
Look around. You brought
all these people out here.
