1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,580
I remember it was a very small picture
the size of a postage stamp

2
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,153
and it fascinated me, it drew me in.

3
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,290
I wanted to get closer
and closer and closer to it

4
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:28,223
like underwear catalogs when I was a child,
you know?

5
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,795
All the photographs of himself

6
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,429
were shot by him.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,068
He was the model,
he was the photographer.

8
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,794
But again they're mesmerizing.

9
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,574
You can get lost in them.
And I'm not a groupie.

10
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:46,309
There was something about him that delivered,
came through on screen.

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,142
The Prince Valiant haircut,
the bandana around the neck.

12
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:54,275
There were films that were unabashedly
openly gay porno films

13
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,151
that he was the star in
and you hadn't seen stuff like this before.

14
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,816
There were two that I'm aware of:
<i>Nights In Black Leather</i> and <i>That Boy.</i>

15
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,188
Always skin-tight pants and
they weren't jeans or anything.

16
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,358
They were like a cotton that left
absolutely nothing to the imagination.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,665
He really was not afraid
to let his sexuality shine through

18
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,740
and that was huge for me,

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,602
to see that someone could be comfortable
with his sexuality.

20
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,612
You wanted to be with him,
you wanted to be touched by him,

21
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,216
you wanted to have
an experience with him.

22
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,653
He rarely appears.

23
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,554
It takes now decision making

24
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:37,856
when I decide it's time again
to get into that character,

25
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,790
to play my part.

26
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,500
Because mostly
I am not Peter Berlin

27
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,161
but I am Armin.

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,832
Baron Armin Hagen
von Hoyningen-Huene.

29
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,610
What a beautiful name.

30
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,512
Just hinting that I'm not
coming out of the gutter.

31
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:02,120
I like to be in the gutter by choice.

32
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,316
And there are a lot of
people I met in the gutter

33
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,585
famous, famous people,

34
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,260
all in the gutter.

35
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,239
Peter Berlin was an iconic

36
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:09,145
gay sex figure
of the 1970s.

37
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,654
A guy who created
a sort of image

38
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,851
that he lived,
as near as I can tell,

39
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,627
24 hours a day

40
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,888
for the enjoyment
of the rest of us.

41
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,665
Peter Berlin was
a great porn star

42
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,667
...but even porn star...
I think he was a great
exhibitionist basically

43
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,271
that wore a
signature haircut

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,704
that looked like
the Dutch Boy
on the paint can

45
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,736
and leather outfits

46
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:36,313
and a crotch that when you first saw it
you thought it was like a joke.

47
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,542
It looked like that he had stuffed 50 rags in there.

48
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,416
He didn't seem to have a lot of irony about it.
That was kind of the amazing thing.

49
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,955
He wasn't campy.

50
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,624
I didn't see him at art events.
I didn't see him at <i>The Cockettes</i>

51
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,389
or any of the hip bars or anything.

52
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,588
I saw him

53
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,563
always in a sexual setting of some way

54
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,204
even if it was in the
middle of the day downtown

55
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,239
walking around on Market Street or
getting on a bus or something.

56
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,611
And he always was dressed...
with this incredible crotch

57
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,374
that was like how you think of
Jayne Mansfield walking down the street

58
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,745
in <i>The Girl Can't Help It</i>
when the ice man looks up

59
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,548
and all the ice melts on the truck

60
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,055
and she's holding two milk bottles.
It was similar to that.

61
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,626
He took an erotic fantasy
and stylized it

62
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,227
almost as a
choreographer

63
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,694
would with a
ballet dancer.
For example,

64
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,823
if I play a Western character in a film

65
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,026
I put on the cowboy hat and the jeans

66
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,105
and the chaps and the stuff.

67
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,935
He played a Western character,

68
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,966
it would be a half a vest
with his chest exposed

69
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,642
with a stylized leather
kind of a chap.

70
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,943
It was always one step further

71
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,879
so that you weren't supposed to accept this guy
as somebody that was "home on the range."

72
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,614
It was a guy that was an extreme fantasy

73
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,419
that you might find in a surrealistic dream

74
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,528
or sometimes a nightmare.

75
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,427
He really stood out because
his attire was very different

76
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,435
than the typical clone look of the time

77
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,871
sort of a plaid shirt,
denim pants type look.

78
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,708
Peter's clothing was very
theatrical by comparison.

79
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,940
How could I talk about Peter?
I never said a word to him.

80
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,087
I fucked with him
but I never even
spoke to him.

81
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,515
I can tell you
how good
the sex was.

82
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,986
There's no one like him,
there's never been
anyone like him.

83
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,661
He's as strange
as Garbo.

84
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,061
And in many ways
to many people

85
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,327
as interesting as Garbo

86
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,959
without having been on the world stage
in the same way.

87
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,073
He still has enormous fame

88
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,334
and luster.

89
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,570
Just very lustrous.

90
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,614
I just never was politically correct.

91
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,275
I said "I go all the way."

92
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:59,381
I include the cock into the picture.

93
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,560
But then you become a pornographer

94
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,664
and you are put on the lowest level

95
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:10,599
of that what society has provided
for you to be, you know?

96
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,589
Oh, the first time I saw Peter

97
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,739
Oh, the first time I saw Peter

98
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,107
was the first time I was
arriving in San Francisco

99
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,110
but unfortunately I was with my parents.

100
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,711
We were arriving in town
for my brother's wedding

101
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,010
and for some reason we
were driving up Third Street.

102
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,779
We probably drove right past The Tool Box,

103
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,786
the very famous leather bar,

104
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,916
which is probably where
Peter was strolling from.

105
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,552
He was coming up Third towards
Market and we passed him

106
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,564
and all heads swiveled to look out the window

107
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,760
and my mother absolutely gasped,

108
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,664
utter shock,
and said, "What's he selling?"

109
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,076
And it just popped out of my mouth,

110
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,042
"Himself."

111
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:58,516
I saw Peter as a shining example

112
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,152
of self-creation and self-identity

113
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,422
and all the potential
that a gay person could be.

114
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,720
And I was also totally unaware of
hustlers at the time,

115
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,557
which is probably what my mother saw.

116
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,698
So when she said "What's he selling?"

117
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,696
she saw a monetary event occurring

118
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,428
whereas I saw the selling of identity.

119
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,834
When people tell me,

120
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,135
"Oh, Peter, you're so great, you look so good."

121
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:28,607
I say "Yeah, I know...
Tell me something what I don't know."

122
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,713
"What?..

123
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:35,110
"How can you say about yourself
that you are good looking?"

124
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,745
I say "Yeah," and I look and I say
"I like it, okay, big deal."

125
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,422
it's obvious.
Don't give me the obvious.

126
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,656
Excite me. Amuse me.

127
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,128
Do something. But
please don't bore me.

128
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,763
I saw images of
Peter Berlin in
<i>After Dark</i> magazine

129
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,237
and they were the
most arresting
gay male images

130
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,065
that I had ever seen.

131
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,973
And Peter Berlin is what I expected

132
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,873
gay males to be like,

133
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,644
What I expected once
I went into this community

134
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,448
is that I would find this roomful
of men looking like Peter Berlin.

135
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,591
And boy, was I surprised.

136
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,457
In a sense

137
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,687
Peter Berlin's photographs

138
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,731
are more like paintings
than they are photographs

139
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,027
because the character is so embellished.

140
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,069
You can't really, at least I can't,

141
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,739
approach it as
typical pornography at all.

142
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,272
I think he's an especially fine photographer.

143
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,003
For one thing his subject matter is rare.

144
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:40,642
There are certainly photographers who
fetishize the male image.

145
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,584
None of them are fetishizing their own image,

146
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,690
so there's a double whammy in that.

147
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,157
But in creating the set and the look,

148
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,888
in sewing the clothes he's wearing

149
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,827
and in staging the photo-

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,231
it's a real one-man show
that's rather impressive.

151
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,595
I was a product of my time

152
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,605
and he was an extension of the time.

153
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,212
I reflected a great deal of what was
going on at that time.

154
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,209
He pushed the envelope.

155
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,283
And it made me then wonder
what brought him to that.

156
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,646
He invented this persona.

157
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,283
My question that I don't know is

158
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,924
how he made peace with that persona
and if he ever did.

159
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:27,031
I don't know if he was an escort or not,
but I would imagine...

160
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,532
He was not ever?

161
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,137
He never had ads where you could
come take his picture?

162
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,900
You couldn't even take his picture?
So he had no money he made from that.

163
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,203
Well, was there a drug issue?
I mean did he have it downfall?

164
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,280
Did he have a bad life? I don't know.

165
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:46,051
Did he have a regular job ever?
I mean did he go... was he like Clark Kent?

166
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,710
Would he put on that outfit and then
go by day and be a bank clerk

167
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,413
and then be Peter Berlin by night?

168
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,091
I still can walk and talk

169
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,320
and even people recognize
me still as Peter Berlin,

170
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,929
what is sort of nice because

171
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,199
if you can as a 60-year-old man

172
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,205
get a compliment from a
stranger <i>en passant</i>

173
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,343
on the street calling to you,

174
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,646
"You look cute."
I never will forget that.

175
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:19,046
Now, who in the hell at
60 years old can look cute?

176
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:24,212
I said "My God, Peter,
you are really good...

177
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,222
...in sort of making people not
see a 60-year-old man."

178
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,726
Because actually I feel like 90.

179
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,957
And there's nothing good about old.

180
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,657
Old is old.

181
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,598
- Nothing good?
- No.

182
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,835
I first saw Peter...

183
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,136
I was in a bar in Berlin

184
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:53,282
on the Ku'dam and the bar

185
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,716
was called the K.C.

186
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,780
and this Dutch boy walked in.

187
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,291
Anyway that's what I used to call him

188
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,793
because he looked like a Dutch boy.

189
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,898
He looked like a little painter, you know?

190
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,297
And he had all this equipment with him.

191
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,204
The face, the body,

192
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,933
the tools, the jewels.

193
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,112
And I didn't know who
Peter Berlin was at the time.

194
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,838
I just thought,

195
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:27,079
"He's somebody. He's one of a kind."

196
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,915
I remember I moved
to San Francisco in 1986.

197
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,685
One day I was in a
café or something

198
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,452
and all of a sudden Peter Berlin walked by.

199
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,388
My eyes bugged out of my head because

200
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,962
here was basically like a cartoon character

201
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,930
walking in front of you.

202
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:48,733
And I just remember-I don't
even think I paid the check

203
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,400
- I just ran out of the café
and just stared at him and looked at him

204
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,207
and I remember-the first time especially
- I remember calling up someone

205
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,848
and I said, "Oh my God, I just saw Peter Berlin!"

206
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,747
The people I worked for
bought the building I live in

207
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,284
and I moved in

208
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,686
and all of a sudden
one day in the stairs

209
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,485
there he was.

210
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,820
I mean it was Peter Berlin because
he still looks like Peter Berlin

211
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,965
with the same hair and
the same pants nearly.

212
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,170
So I started talking to him.

213
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,167
I had to, being the manager of the building.

214
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,308
And it turned out he lived right below me,
in the apartment right below me.

215
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:28,209
And I talked to him, not even mentioning
that I knew who he was.

216
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,178
You know, it's funny. I was thinking
about that the other day

217
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,808
when exactly did I tell him "I know who you are."

218
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,649
And it must have been the day

219
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,722
that he said "Well, let's have coffee"

220
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:42,554
and I went over to his place and of course

221
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,854
you can't not know who he is
when you walk into his apartment.

222
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:50,468
For one thing it was for me like
going back to the '70s and the '80s

223
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:55,206
because the whole place looks
very much like back in the hippie days

224
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,537
with lots and lots of stuff all over the place

225
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,278
and all of his pictures everywhere.

226
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,847
So I acknowledged that I knew who he was

227
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,417
and I guess the more I got to talk to him,
the more he started telling me

228
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,851
and the more I realized

229
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,287
that he really wanted to tell his story.

230
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,427
Whatever happened to him?

231
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,892
He is still not out there.

232
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,123
Anyway, we take this.

233
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,092
No, no, no, no.
This is very valuable.

234
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,569
Am I still- How-

235
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,933
No, let the world decide.
Should he have a lifting or

236
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,278
shouldn't he? Now look at the difference,

237
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,539
it's just very little.
This has to go.

238
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,114
That is an Italian magazine I guess.

239
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:53,158
Because you see, I was this
internationally famous person, you know?

240
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:58,536
If one thinks about. It's true...
and I was the first one who was amazed at

241
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,969
how little one has to do in order

242
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,507
to be picked up by the press

243
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:09,747
because I mean basically
the world is quite boring.

244
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,575
So that little "of the edge"

245
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:17,821
is what people want to hear
about and read about.

246
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,083
Let me see if I find something I can...

247
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,057
That picture here, I know my friend James

248
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,394
carried in his wallet.

249
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:34,938
That's sort of a self-portrait what I...
Like everything is a self-portrait,

250
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,200
but that was you know,

251
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,543
when I was just young... or younger.

252
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,008
Well, I was at least 32.
Looks younger, no?

253
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,311
I always looked younger than I am.

254
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,353
So he carried that. Now I carry it.

255
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,184
And here I found...

256
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,157
"James loves Peter."

257
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,523
You know, that little note I found.

258
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,258
So I kept all those
little mementos, you know?

259
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,098
That is a Merry Christmas card

260
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,208
that Tom of Finland sent to me.

261
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,480
I remember I approached
Tom of Finland a long time ago.

262
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:21,251
I commissioned five drawings
from my photographs

263
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,253
and I remember, I paid $300 each.

264
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,414
That was a lot of money for me

265
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,287
but that was his rate.

266
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,656
So he worked on them and
sent them to me at some point.

267
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,059
Such a nice man.

268
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,202
Once when I talked to him again,

269
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,098
I told him that it would be
really interesting to film him

270
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,175
while he was drawing

271
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,475
and he said no, no, no.

272
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,206
When I draw, I'm all by myself.

273
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,947
And I knew what he meant.

274
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:57,350
If somebody would have liked to film me
when I was taking my photographs

275
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,423
I would have declined, too,

276
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,185
because it's such a private matter.

277
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,228
I needed for that work complete silence,

278
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,692
complete intimacy.

279
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,497
So then I did this whole series of
double exposures

280
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,109
where I exposed the negative twice.

281
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,475
I put marks on the floor and on the wall

282
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,582
and sometimes you can see it in the picture

283
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,052
so I would know where to stand.

284
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,450
I did quite a good job because
people would ask me

285
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,283
if I had a twin brother

286
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:37,157
and I always thought my God,
it would be interesting to have had a twin brother

287
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,126
but I just didn't have one.

288
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,691
Sometimes I would underexpose
a whole role of film

289
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:48,097
so I got very inferior prints

290
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,468
and in order not to throw
them away I used oil color

291
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,975
or pencils to make them look good

292
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,171
and I did a good job.

293
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,216
I think they look sort of romantic
and of course erotic.

294
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,287
You asked me and I told you

295
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,252
that I wanted to do my own documentary

296
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,554
because I see myself as a filmmaker,

297
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,166
in some capacity, because I made two of them.

298
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,734
But am I a filmmaker?

299
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,732
In 40 years I made two films.

300
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,332
More of my time I watch television

301
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,106
so I'm more a television watcher
than filmmaker, right?

302
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,616
So since I didn't do anything

303
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,550
for 30 years,

304
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,053
you come along and you said. "Oh, Peter,

305
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,657
"it might be a good idea because
you are so interesting

306
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,093
"and people want to know about it."
So I said. "OK, do it"

307
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,291
because I have proven to myself
I haven't done it.

308
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,135
I did an interview with him and later I did

309
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,541
a rather monumental size drawing of him,

310
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,048
which is in three parts. It's a triptych.

311
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,709
We did an interview on a
Sunday afternoon in Soho.

312
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:13,790
At that time Soho was
just a mass of warehouses.

313
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,117
There was nothing commercial
here at all.

314
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,654
It was in a vast loft,
a sparsely furnished loft.

315
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,234
I had never seen a space like it-

316
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,860
so raw and big.

317
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,869
And by the time he started talking,

318
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,405
I knew that one word or two words from me

319
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,205
were all that was necessary.

320
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,574
I didn't have to have questions.

321
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:41,742
I just had to have a good sense
of where he wanted to go

322
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,514
and to just give him that energy.

323
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,215
Of all the interviews that I've done

324
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,226
and I've done dozens and dozens
of interviews with porn stars

325
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,885
it's still my favorite

326
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,190
because it's the most individual

327
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,568
and it's the craziest.

328
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:04,437
And I'm using <i>crazy</i> in every
sense of that word.

329
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,276
You know, it's just plain crazy

330
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,279
or it's wonderfully crazy,

331
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,110
Whatever. Crazy.

332
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:19,353
There was just one philosophical idea
after another in it,

333
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,619
all very vain

334
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,354
but at the same time very human

335
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,295
in its vanity

336
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,491
because he was also presenting ideas

337
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,028
like young, beautiful men shouldn't go to war.

338
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,299
Only men over 40 should go to war

339
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,568
because after all,
they're finished anyway.

340
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,682
People think you have
to deal with punishment,

341
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:49,477
deal with weapons, dealing with
pushing and shoving, forcing,

342
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,618
and that's where this
idiot male comes in.

343
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,490
He goes to war and kills,

344
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,352
and why?

345
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,522
I don't feel I owe anyone to say

346
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,295
I'm living now in freedom
because somebody died.

347
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,664
What bullshit.

348
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,569
What an insult,
what an insult to humanity.

349
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,445
I wish they would all refuse to go to war.

350
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,945
I certainly never would do it.

351
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,843
They would have to kill me
before I'd kill someone.

352
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,924
Did you set out to be famous
in the beginning?

353
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,461
No, no. You don't set out to be famous.

354
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,566
You are setting out to be loved and wanted.

355
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,429
That's what we all want.

356
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,401
That's what is called looking for love.

357
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,267
I wanted to be loved

358
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,875
and I achieved it by just making
the best of me, using whatever I had

359
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,606
and sure enough, it worked quite well.

360
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,447
Well, I think what makes it unique
is its sexuality,

361
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,923
the up-frontness of it.

362
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,990
I mean, the thrusting basket,

363
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,321
the bare chest, the silky hair.

364
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,933
The Peter Berlin type to me

365
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,931
is very comfortable with his sexuality,

366
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,264
extremely sensual, somewhat androgynous

367
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,534
but more on the masculine side.

368
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,473
The hairdo and stuff, he wasn't -

369
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,705
He didn't try to be like that macho.

370
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,611
It was confusing.
You didn't know what it was going to be.

371
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,582
It was like Dinah Shore
with a hard on with the hair.

372
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:32,246
You didn't quite know what it was
but he did look good in a way.

373
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,621
He did look great in a way.

374
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,591
I mean I get that he was
a turn-on to people.

375
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,221
I don't know if he was
a turn-on to me or not,

376
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,596
but I couldn't stop looking.
I liked seeing him

377
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,929
and I marveled at this

378
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,799
especially just when I would be
getting off a bus.

379
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,534
I mean... I used to think, "Jesus... you know,
he goes out like that everyday?"

380
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,579
I give him great respect
for living that extreme a lifestyle

381
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,273
and in San Francisco
it is possible to live like that.

382
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,942
And it wasn't an image you forgot very quickly

383
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,923
because it was so specific
and almost cartoon like.

384
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,856
Peter had a European image I would say,

385
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:16,558
a kind of a mix of a French sailor
and a German rent boy

386
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,768
and a little bit of everything thrown in.

387
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,461
He would head out into the streets

388
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,540
in one of his incredible getups.

389
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,802
I mean they're beyond fashion

390
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,777
and I also think in many ways
they've been an influence on fashion.

391
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,349
You know, this kind of bold
display which we now see.

392
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,352
I think that he's got a hand in it
in the same way that Tom of Finland

393
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,917
is almost as influential as
Chanel you know, because

394
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,358
Tom of Finland taught gay men
how they wanted to look.

395
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,488
They had no idea. They were wearing little
suits and holding a martini, you know.

396
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,931
Peter Berlin was expressionistic.

397
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,502
What he was doing was an art form.

398
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,868
He was being defined as...

399
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,374
as a sculpture. Whereas
that wasn't true with me at all.

400
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,377
I was hired to be the guy that you knew,

401
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,777
the guy that lived around the corner,

402
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,080
or was somebody's big brother or
you saw in school or something.

403
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,447
I would have a hard time in all my images

404
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:17,561
to find the one and
sometimes I fantasize about.

405
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:22,098
"Now, what would be the image look
like what I want to see,

406
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,597
"that expresses that what
I want to see in a man?"

407
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,504
I disappointed a lot of people

408
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:33,407
who saw me as a
caricature what I created.

409
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,412
You know, Marilyn Monroe was one thing,

410
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,050
but Norma Jean was a whole other story.

411
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,026
Being born into a blue-blood family,

412
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,560
With my grandmother's side

413
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,563
of philosophers and attachés

414
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:59,170
and then my other side were
artists and photographers

415
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,435
You know, there's one very famous,

416
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,507
George von Hoyningen-Huene,

417
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:08,612
who was a photographer of Hollywood.

418
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,806
And so that's where my roots
are coming from.

419
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,783
I was born with the pigs and the horses

420
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,421
and with land.

421
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,491
But my father was killed in the war,
just at the end of the war,

422
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,722
so I never got to know him.

423
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:28,024
But he was beautiful and sensitive.

424
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,533
I have nice letters what
he wrote to my mother.

425
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:36,163
These boys, like my father,
didn't have the slightest idea

426
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,900
what Hitler was doing,

427
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,511
but then he was killed by trying

428
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,047
to get a comrade out of a minefield...

429
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,549
so he was dead

430
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,689
and my mother then with three
children, young children,

431
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,520
was fleeing from the Baltics down to Berlin

432
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,026
where my grandfather and
grandmother were living.

433
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,097
So we lost everything.
I grew up very poor

434
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:05,259
and I'm so thankful for it because
everything else was gravy.

435
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,698
And I'm even amazed
how well I did

436
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,674
because my life was always
outside the norm.

437
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,744
It was never like anyone else's.

438
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,882
As long as the gay issue is
sort of somewhere else

439
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,281
then people either reject it
or don't mind,

440
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:27,115
but if it hits home... I can see
my mother still crying and crying

441
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,728
and in my heart I knew

442
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:34,957
that not only don't I do
anything what I couldn't live with

443
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,158
but that there's no way that anybody

444
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,260
could talk me out of it.

445
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,835
The result of that situation was

446
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,102
that I basically had to leave

447
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,113
and so I lived for the first time by myself

448
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,547
and loved it from Day One...

449
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,585
to be completely free...

450
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,521
like not having to tell anybody
where you go tonight

451
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,717
and when do you come home.

452
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:07,763
I think I was about 18 maybe,

453
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:13,838
so I learned very quickly that
there was a lot of action

454
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,673
out in the streets, in the parks,

455
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,634
train stations

456
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:25,742
and all those underground places.

457
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,285
I had the greatest time with
everybody else who was there.

458
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,648
But it was sort of the thing that
people didn't talk about.

459
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:37,693
It was just not what was accepted in

460
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,358
the gay community.

461
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,167
They all had those double standards.

462
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,964
You know, on one hand being
prissy and dressing up,

463
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,038
and on the other hand sucking dick

464
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,600
under a tree in a park.

465
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,747
Right? So these nights,
these warm summer nights

466
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,681
and there were the...

467
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,820
...what is it?
It's called <i>der lindenbaum.</i>

468
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:08,258
It's one of those big trees that bloom
in the spring or somewhere

469
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,657
and they are so heavily perfumed

470
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,699
that you had that beautiful
fragrance in the air

471
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:20,304
and the moonshine and the people.

472
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,923
I mean it was magical.

473
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,173
I mean it was magical.

474
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:27,611
The first sexual feelings
I had with another man

475
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,408
that was I think what I mentioned

476
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,079
the 13th of August, 1961.

477
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:38,154
I remember the date because of
that very historical happening

478
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,349
of the building of the Berlin Wall.

479
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,719
And one of those East German
boys picked me up,

480
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,899
took me over to the East.

481
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,896
I spent the night.

482
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,061
It was sort of good but I remember -

483
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,207
in my mind... I already -

484
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,669
I was looking for something specific.

485
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,676
My obsession 'til today...

486
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,013
I never have met anyone

487
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,714
who shared my obsession

488
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,884
from his doings.

489
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,357
The obsession would be
if someone does something

490
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:26,426
on his own to get me going.

491
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,105
Now usually because of my attire

492
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,415
of my way of dressing
and way of behaving,

493
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,774
I did that to people...

494
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,387
in person and on picture.

495
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:50,352
So my obsession would be to have
a person approach me

496
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,257
looking like me...

497
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,092
and forget the face.

498
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,299
It could be black or blue or white,

499
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:06,507
could be any given attractive man.

500
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,911
So it's not that I'm looking for myself

501
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,216
but someone like me.

502
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,818
That would be heaven for me.

503
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,081
It never, never, never happened.

504
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,748
I always had to do the work

505
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,794
because whenever people wanted to
take me on their hand

506
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,263
going where they wanted to go

507
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,301
and I tell you where most
people want to go.

508
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,098
Three things.

509
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,366
They want to

510
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,406
get fucked,

511
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,935
the second thing is get fucked,

512
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,071
the third thing, get fucked,

513
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,043
and then the fourth thing is

514
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,347
sucking cock.

515
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,457
Right?

516
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,023
That is in itself nothing
wrong with it, you know.

517
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,426
But that's not my obsession.

518
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,793
I can go without fucking,

519
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,332
without sucking,

520
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,027
without kissing...

521
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,769
and I wish I would

522
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,139
just want to kiss you

523
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,336
and I would feel all that what
people seem to feel.

524
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,781
When I see a kiss on the screen

525
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,939
it's like

526
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,214
looking at a nice pork chop in
a butcher's display.

527
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,822
It just doesn't get me. Right?

528
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,959
And yet in your films...

529
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,752
It's a lie.

530
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:41,061
I don't know exactly on what alley
or what park

531
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,070
I met Sal Mineo.

532
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,306
I only remember that
I liked his looks.

533
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,375
He was beautiful.

534
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,281
I met him and I went to his hotel

535
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,444
and I think it was in Paris

536
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,388
and I mean we had a good time

537
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:03,084
and he let me know that
he just loved, loved

538
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,259
white Jockey shorts.

539
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,297
You know, I like the idea.
I mean I have my own fetish

540
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,162
and white underwear

541
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,566
sort of fits very much into it.

542
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,341
I love to just take the naked body

543
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,201
and with all our refinement...

544
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,006
very late in my life,

545
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,215
I did my job

546
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,445
by using

547
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,148
the pantyhose

548
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,349
where you not only cover your body

549
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,461
but your ass and your crotch.

550
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,929
His thing was he wanted people
to want to have sex with him.

551
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,627
Whether he ever did or not didn't seem
to be part of the equation

552
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,232
of his success.

553
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,405
During the interview he described to me

554
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:55,043
a typical night of Peter Berlin cruising...

555
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,976
getting himself done

556
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,513
and hitting the street

557
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,174
and sort of choosing someone

558
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,321
and luring that person deeper
and deeper and deeper

559
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,687
into his world of standing in doorways

560
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,894
just long enough to make the person
feel he could approach him

561
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,328
and then skittering away
and going to another doorway

562
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,630
and knowing the person would follow him.
And this could go on for hours,

563
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:26,203
kind of luring and frustrating
this person at the same time

564
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,504
and then just suddenly it was over.

565
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,211
You know, there was no human contact
beyond the visual

566
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:40,483
and I suppose that he could probably be defined
as being a great visual artist

567
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,089
because of his look

568
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:47,129
and the fact that he had
boiled sex down

569
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,563
to a visual trip.

570
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:55,035
You know, that he turned people he came
into contact with into voyeurs...

571
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,168
when all they were looking for
was a little sex, you know,

572
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,246
a little hands-on stuff.
I don't think they ever got that.

573
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,549
Foreplay starts

574
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,744
the second you lay eyes on someone

575
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,318
and of course out of experience

576
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,722
I realized the longer you
draw out the time of talking,

577
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,391
that's where you are better off

578
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:23,022
shutting your mouth and you
just observe from a distance.

579
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,332
If you get close

580
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,165
and if one talks,

581
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,698
everything can be destroyed.

582
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,303
So rare, you know,

583
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,173
that it will enhance.

584
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,240
My experience is that silence
is very exciting.

585
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:54,554
Drugs became very much a part
of my sex game.

586
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,659
When I came to America,

587
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,235
the first night in New York,

588
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,670
I was introduced to drugs and
I stayed with them

589
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,332
and I wish people would realize

590
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:10,379
that it is much healthier than
for instance drinking and smoking.

591
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,540
Of course if you go
off the wagon with heroin

592
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,083
and then shooting up, you know,

593
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:21,123
then you are as badly
in the position like a drunk

594
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,283
who just can't stop

595
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:27,661
with some nice glasses
of wine or a good cocktail.

596
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,503
Jochen Labriola...

597
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,708
lived in Wiesbaden at the time

598
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:46,282
where I was working as a
manager of a movie theater.

599
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,716
And while I was putting these posters

600
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,755
for the coming attractions in my theater,

601
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,253
he said:

602
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,793
"Oh, you know, I see you
sometime with a camera.

603
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,099
"You know, I have a camera,
I have a Hasselblad

604
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,732
"and I don't know, can you maybe

605
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,668
"explain certain things about the
camera to me?" I said, "Of course, yes."

606
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,508
So I went up to his room there...
he had a room in that hotel...

607
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,582
and I explained the Hasselblad to him

608
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,113
and then I realized

609
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,187
he was not interested in the
Hasselblad explanation but...

610
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,316
in me.

611
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,792
At that time I was about 20 something.

612
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:36,833
I was always in need like I think
everyone in that age,

613
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,166
of admiration

614
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,599
and, you know, attention.

615
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:48,173
So he wanted one thing, you know.
Like all men want one thing,

616
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,845
And I gave it to him.
And we became good friends.

617
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,845
And then,

618
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,521
he offered me to go with me

619
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,420
to live in Rome.

620
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,118
And I said "I don't have any money."

621
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:07,263
"Oh, money is no object, you know.

622
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,830
"Just come with me."

623
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,536
So we lived in Rome
for about a year

624
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,669
and he became my best friend

625
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,377
for the rest of his life

626
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:25,710
and for my life 'til he died in 1988.

627
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,678
And he got me out of that

628
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,816
German <i>kleine carrieux,</i>
you say in German.

629
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,654
like small checkered view,

630
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,195
you know, with a small German horizon.

631
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:45,665
He became a painter after we broke up...

632
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:49,897
successful painter because he had
something what I've never had,

633
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:54,678
a good sense of selling yourself.

634
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,848
That was such a good time in Europe.

635
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,986
At that time in the 1960's
Paris was so exciting.

636
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,422
So I lived there for a while
with my friend Jochen

637
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,758
and I remember
the whole program of the day

638
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,623
was to go to have a coffee
in the Café Flore.

639
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,955
And if you didn't find a place there,

640
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,563
you went to the Deux Magots

641
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,431
and then there was a kiosk where
you had newspapers

642
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,666
so everybody pretended to read
while sitting there with their coffee.

643
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,470
And people were just cruising,

644
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:31,741
seeing and being seen. That was
the only thing what people were doing.

645
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,912
I always lived so very well
if I think back at that time...

646
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,848
like a millionaire,

647
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,719
not having a penny in my pocket,

648
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,225
but because of the friends I had,
especially Jochen,

649
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,991
it opened up a beautiful world
of great horizons.

650
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,660
Oh, yeah, then we went to Acapulco one day

651
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:59,005
and I made a stop in New York and I liked
New York and I stayed in New York.

652
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,278
That's how I came to America...
just loving it.

653
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,974
From New York then... after a couple
of years, I stayed there...

654
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:12,548
I sort of got to California...
to San Francisco.

655
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,623
In San Francisco then

656
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,319
I started then to
become Peter Berlin.

657
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,930
No, I saw him around first and then

658
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,658
I heard about <i>Nights In Black Leather.</i>

659
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:27,031
<i>That Boy,</i> I don't remember,

660
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,607
I don't recollect seeing in the theater.
Of course you know, that was the '70s

661
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,505
and the '70s is like

662
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,703
a big fog in my mind.

663
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,982
San Francisco in the '70s

664
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,450
was an incredibly exhilarating epicenter of

665
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:56,893
a social, political, economic,
artistic whirlwind.

666
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,495
You could walk from O'Farrell to Jackson

667
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:03,064
and there would be guys in
every doorway of every storefront

668
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,359
either giving it away or selling it

669
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,698
and it was truly like something out of Genet.

670
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,003
<i>The first evening</i>

671
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,009
<i>I decided to have a look</i>
<i>at the nightlife of San Francisco's Broadway.</i>

672
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,776
I<i>t was a thrill to watch all</i>
<i>different kinds of people...</i>

673
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:21,145
<i>prostitutes, hustlers, drunks and dope dealers...</i>

674
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,420
<i>all made up the picture of a Barbary Coast</i>

675
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,819
<i>that can have little faded from</i>
<i>its days of past glory.</i>

676
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:32,052
Peter Berlin was really just one in a long line

677
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,754
of interesting street personas

678
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,696
that have been invented here in
San Francisco ever since the early days

679
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,031
when the Emperor Norton was
walking around with his little dog

680
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,070
in his full regalia on

681
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,141
or earlier in the '70's there was
a guy named Jesus Christ Satan.

682
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,002
He knew that he'd invented
a personality

683
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,045
that was rather compelling

684
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,083
and he was very much
a part of the landscape.

685
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,812
It's always happened here really.
I don't know that

686
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,184
it was a special thing...
that it was exclusive to the '70's,

687
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:05,689
although certainly the air of freedom
made it easier for him to do what he did.

688
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,464
I started my film in '72

689
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,967
and that was exactly when
I was 30 years old.

690
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,730
So I started my career...

691
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:19,899
even that people would say
my God, the career's already over.

692
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,541
Peter Berlin was never young.

693
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:27,447
Yes, I mean he never was

694
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,212
But that image, thank God

695
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,751
it's there and I can die now
and it's there.

696
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,051
You know, it will be hovering

697
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:40,721
in the annals of gay pornography

698
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,627
and will be there forever

699
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,064
and I can sort of gracefully get old.

700
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,059
I met a friend

701
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:51,766
like in 1970 when I came to America

702
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:56,470
who happened to go to
the Art Institute here

703
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,949
and was making his Master's in filmmaking.

704
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,883
He showed me

705
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,115
his piece for the judges,

706
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:11,022
I guess whatever they have
to submit to get their degree.

707
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:15,996
I told him you can show that to
some friends and your mother

708
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,500
and they all will
like it, but it's a bore

709
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,797
so why don't we make a porno film?

710
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,767
I always felt like

711
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,944
I wanted to present
myself in that fashion.

712
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:36,675
There was always sort of the thrill
of that exhibition element.

713
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:42,315
So we started to shoot when
the sun was shining.

714
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,595
There was never a script and
never a big idea.

715
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,688
He edited the film,

716
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,994
he was doing the sound

717
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,898
and I had nothing to do

718
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,701
with the making of the film.

719
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:02,710
I just was in front of it and
telling him what to do

720
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,178
so I sort of gave him the idea,

721
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,749
do this shot here or make it all.

722
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,684
He went to Los Angeles
to show it to a distributor.

723
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:15,723
They liked it, what was
very good to hear

724
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:20,688
because I thought it was not
a great piece of art there.

725
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:25,926
<i>All I need to do is lie on the grass</i>
<i>and just ignore the people.</i>

726
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,738
<i>Last week I met quite a few</i>

727
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,271
<i>and you know how it goes.</i>

728
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,703
<i>Conversation.</i>

729
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,607
<i>Hello, what's your name? Peter?</i>

730
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,579
<i>You have a nice accent,</i>
<i>where do you come from?</i>

731
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,238
<i>Germany?</i>

732
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,317
<i>Oh, how long you have been here?</i>

733
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,517
<i>Do you like it?</i>

734
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,117
<i>And after I go through this 20 times,</i>

735
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,349
<i>even the faces look all the same.</i>

736
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,390
<i>I naturally get tired of it</i>

737
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,220
<i>because I know exactly what</i>
<i>they really are interested in.</i>

738
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,258
<i>And it all happened in San Francisco.</i>

739
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:01,271
The porn at the time was
almost <i>cinema verite</i>

740
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:04,236
in the way it depicted gay men's lives

741
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,036
and the explosion of our sexual culture.

742
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:10,237
And Peter's movie is right in line
with that sort of filmmaking.

743
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,406
It does depict the lives

744
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,314
of gay men and certainly the locations

745
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,549
and the look with great truthfulness.

746
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,624
<i>You like this ring?</i>

747
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,424
<i>Yeah, it's real neat.</i>

748
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,761
<i>I bought it in town, you know.</i>

749
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,929
<i>I think it's very nice</i>
<i>these things here,</i>

750
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,301
<i>It looks good on you...</i>

751
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,965
<i>... why don't you have one, huh?</i>
<i>- I don't know. I've never seen one before.</i>

752
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,105
<i>You must take it off from</i>
<i>your boots, you know.</i>

753
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,446
<i>Or must buy some.</i>

754
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,284
They're nice.

755
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,347
<i>You like leather?</i>

756
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,713
<i>Sure, what do you think?</i>

757
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,817
<i>I don't know. I was just asking, you know.</i>

758
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,427
<i>I have a leather jacket.</i>

759
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,860
<i>Is that all?</i>

760
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,931
<i>No, I have some very nice leather jeans.</i>

761
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,692
<i>You really should see them.</i>

762
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,902
<i>You know, the kind with</i>
<i>a punch in front, you know.</i>

763
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,334
<i>With a punch?</i>

764
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:14,410
<i>I don't know how do you call it.</i>
<i>My English is not so good.</i>

765
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,077
<i>A pouch?</i>

766
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,873
<i>Oh, a pouch!</i>

767
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,710
<i>Yes. No, you know, I mean, really it's...</i>

768
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,283
<i>Why are you laughing?</i>

769
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,982
<i>I think my English is pretty good.</i>

770
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,844
You know, the dates for Warhol's movies

771
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:33,433
You know, the dates for Warhol's movies

772
00:45:33,468 --> 00:45:35,987
are definitely '60s and later '60s,

773
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:40,796
the Warhol anti-narrative movies
someone once called it.

774
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,963
So that sort of filmmaking
was definitely in the air

775
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,371
when Peter's first movie came along.

776
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:50,206
But in its casual approach to narrative,

777
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,247
in its almost refusal
of having narrative

778
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,443
while it documents a long cruise

779
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,511
or the boring party

780
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,517
or just the elements of street life

781
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:05,056
that focused Peter's seemingly
aimless existence,

782
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,129
his drift through society,

783
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,129
there's many elements of

784
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,766
the Warhol non-event,
of the documentary feeling.

785
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,730
At one point-this really got to me

786
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,239
they go to a party

787
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,939
and unlike any other porn movie

788
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,775
where they try to have a
good time at a party

789
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,283
and give the drag queen
a couple of witty lines,

790
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,479
Peter announces as the scene starts
like this was an exercise in Brecht.

791
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,417
<i>Most of them turn out to be so boring</i>

792
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,024
<i>and this one was no exception.</i>

793
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:42,529
He tells you before you even arrive that
it's going to be a boring event

794
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:46,302
and in truth it is. It's very Warhol.

795
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,268
They sit on a sofa, they pass a joint,

796
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,839
you see too many beer cans
in front of them,

797
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,239
nobody's saying anything witty,

798
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,903
the drag queen tries to have banter
with one of the cuter fellows

799
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,207
and it's really tedious.

800
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,443
And you're kind of glad when,
after only seven minutes

801
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,985
that seem like much longer,
Peter leaves.

802
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,488
Although it really disrupts
the sex, I really liked it

803
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,387
because it's as truthful as
the rest of the movie is.

804
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,532
If Peter is setting up a fictional character,

805
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:20,260
they've really very cleverly shored it up.

806
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,168
They don't take you to a fictional party.
They take you to a real party.

807
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,366
They're very literary, his movies.

808
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,067
That's where they're different from mine.

809
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,610
I had no sound in mine.

810
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,141
I only had music.

811
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,249
Peter has a lot of talking in his movies.

812
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,614
It's usually he's writing a letter
and so it's a voiceover

813
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,819
or he's telling a story to somebody.

814
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:43,086
<i>I just met a young boy as</i>
<i>I was wearing my leather outfit</i>

815
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,488
<i>who took me to his place,</i>

816
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,925
<i>dressed himself up all in leather,</i>

817
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,827
<i>put on a swastika armband and an iron cross</i>

818
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,259
<i>and we stood in the corner of his room</i>

819
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,132
<i>which he had hung with</i>
<i>floor to ceiling mirrors</i>

820
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:59,036
<i>and told me, "We are both</i>
<i>strong, we are equals,</i>

821
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,268
<i>"the world will bow before us."</i>

822
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,512
I did not dare to tell him

823
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,013
that I voted for the socialists
in the last German elections.

824
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,318
Peter's character... just
walking through these scenes

825
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,149
like oh, this is what happens
every day in San Francisco

826
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,655
if you happen to be standing
around as a sexual icon.

827
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,851
His whole body is a sexual thing.

828
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,327
He's a full-body genital
is what he is.

829
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:26,166
And then there's Peter
narrating the soundtrack

830
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:30,864
and what does he say? "That was a pleasant
diversion for a restless night."

831
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:35,304
Actually, the main thing that really

832
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,113
put me on the map was

833
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,016
the advertisement in <i>The Advocate...</i>

834
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:45,916
full page for weeks and
weeks and weeks.

835
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:50,221
And that sort of,

836
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:55,223
that poster what I designed
created a buzz

837
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:59,028
and then the film came out and
the film did very good business.

838
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,633
It got my name known.

839
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:07,967
I already started to call myself Peter.

840
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,504
When I was asked many times:

841
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,149
"What's your name?"

842
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,213
I said, "Armin."
"What?" I said, "Armin."

843
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,616
And I got sick and tired of this and
one day somebody said,

844
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,924
"What's your name?"
I said, "Peter."

845
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,627
When I made the ad,

846
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:25,494
When I made the ad,

847
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:29,192
I first called myself Burian

848
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,132
and then I got a big letter
from a lawyer

849
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,161
accusing me of stealing someone's name.

850
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,571
I said I don't need that name
and I changed it to Peter Berlin.

851
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,706
I realized then when the film
made a lot of money

852
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,415
that of course the people who
were supposed to give it to us

853
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,383
put it in their pocket.

854
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,955
I always, all my life, I worked
without lawyers

855
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,086
and I never cared for money too much,

856
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,758
but if you don't care for money
too much, then you don't get it.

857
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:04,090
But I didn't mind. I had a good time.

858
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,963
And my friend was very disappointed

859
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:11,471
with the financial outcome,

860
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,339
so he was not interested in
making another film.

861
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,505
So the second film I made
I did all my own.

862
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:25,043
I edited it and I was shooting it

863
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:29,486
and I was putting it together
with the sound

864
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,560
and I never did anything.

865
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:36,459
I just sort of picked it up
by looking at it

866
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,568
and it's not a big secret
how to put something together.

867
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,328
As a filmmaker,

868
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,405
I would say that

869
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,307
Peter probably is closer to
my style of making films

870
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,447
than anyone else that
made films in my period.

871
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,646
And that's why I liked
his films, I guess,

872
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,753
because they had some
sense behind them,

873
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,079
they had some sensitivity
behind them.

874
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:04,155
Of course again,
the primary thing is the ego.

875
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,488
I mean it's a Peter Berlin film.

876
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,689
It's - You saw a film to see Peter.

877
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,391
You didn't see it to see him
have sex with somebody else.

878
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,431
That was like dessert.

879
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,733
When he undoes his jeans
and then he has on shorts

880
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,807
and he undoes the shorts
and he has on something else

881
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:25,376
and then he undoes that
and he has something else

882
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,110
and he gets down-
I think he's got five layers.

883
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,947
You see it had a sense of humor there

884
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,715
It has a little levity in
there to ease, you know,

885
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,416
the heaviness of the situation

886
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,322
and also to make it more palatable.

887
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,827
So I think again, that's who he is.

888
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,257
He's someone who

889
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,125
has that lightness in him

890
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,794
and all this darkness and all this ego
and all this other stuff.

891
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,303
There's still that little levity that's there.

892
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:55,241
I was now knowing, okay,
don't give it to some distributors,

893
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,505
so I gave it to a friend of mine

894
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,309
who happened to be a distributor

895
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:01,884
in New York

896
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,187
and the same thing happened.

897
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:05,685
That friend or not friend...

898
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:10,418
people just are not very good or
very honest with money.

899
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:15,420
And I became very, very

900
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,524
famous. I was even surprised

901
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:23,332
that I got the fan mail.

902
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,271
Suddenly Peter Berlin...
everybody has - I mean

903
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,412
I was always part of the talk.

904
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,474
Oh, and I heard stories about me,

905
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,240
lies, lies, lies because... -

906
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,885
Like what? What kind of lies?

907
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:41,416
People, first of all that they, oh,

908
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,526
yeah, I got fucked by Peter Berlin.

909
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:48,790
I know. I mean... I already stopped
fucking in the what, in the '60s.

910
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,830
When I came to New York,

911
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,499
when I came to America

912
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,366
there's not one person in America
who got fucked by Peter Berlin.

913
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,532
Okay, now the stories were oh, yeah, I got -

914
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,143
And I listened to this. So it's sort of-

915
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:03,438
I mean I don't mind.

916
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,309
I always was a very private person

917
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:10,817
and that means people even if they
would have liked to get in contact

918
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,887
would have been very difficult.

919
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:18,186
And somehow... I got offers

920
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,194
and I got inquiries.

921
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:25,892
I never would have been
able to do it with someone else.

922
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,869
I think if- I don't know,

923
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,506
Alfred Hitchcock would have come to me,

924
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,736
I probably would have said okay,
maybe there's something.

925
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:39,575
So I decided to not do any more.

926
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:42,217
But I didn't decide it immediately.

927
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,910
I said okay, maybe next year
I'll make another one

928
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:49,589
and then I said okay, next year and
the year passed and then another year.

929
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:52,956
So it went on and on and on

930
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,499
and then I just said to myself okay, Peter,

931
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,658
you just don't make another film anymore.

932
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:05,372
But I started to sell my
film in parts and mail order

933
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:08,511
and I made some money with that.

934
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:14,446
I got bored with the whole thing
and just stopped doing it.

935
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:17,815
But I kept on photographing myself

936
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,853
and then when the video came into fashion

937
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,991
I videotaped myself-

938
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,424
usually, exclusively by myself- because

939
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,799
I'm still a very shy person and
I never could perform

940
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:37,802
like the porn stars do.

941
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,726
He had the definite potential
to be huge, you know,

942
00:54:39,761 --> 00:54:42,519
He had the definite potential
to be huge, you know,

943
00:54:42,554 --> 00:54:45,277
to be as big as a Calvin Klein ad
or as big as a -

944
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,578
I mean he could be mainstream now.

945
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,310
He told me one day

946
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:55,584
that a spokesperson for
Jean Paul Gaultier called him

947
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:59,627
and they said we'd like for you
to be the spokesmodel for our line Gibo,

948
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,664
which is the moderate priced clothing.

949
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,801
And Peter Berlin answered
the phone and said

950
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,871
"Ah, Peter is not here, I am the maid

951
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,338
"and he will be out of town for 8 months."

952
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,808
And that's what he used to do

953
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,676
and I looked at him and
I said "Why did you do that?"

954
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:23,546
I said. "Why would you not
want to be in these ads

955
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,585
for Jean Paul Gaultier?"

956
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,918
He goes "Oh, because then
I have to call them back

957
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,026
"and they have to call me back

958
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,828
"and they have to come here,

959
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,464
"and I have to do the photo shoot and..."

960
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,563
And that's the way he lived his life.

961
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,761
You know, he just could not be bothered.

962
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,304
He's like the Greta Garbo of porn.

963
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,975
<i>Hey man, can't you do anything else</i>
<i>with your cock besides show it off?</i>

964
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,779
<i>Oh, I can.</i>

965
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,778
<i>So let's go fuck.</i>

966
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,543
<i>I don't want to.</i>

967
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,118
<i>What do you want?</i>

968
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,082
<i>If you don't mind, man,</i>

969
00:55:58,421 --> 00:55:59,649
<i>I like being by myself.</i>

970
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,754
And when I lived in New York
with my friend Jochen

971
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,087
who had a big beautiful loft there

972
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,896
and everything was provided for...

973
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,929
I didn't have to work.

974
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,432
So I went to the 54...

975
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,095
I went to all the clubs

976
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:20,603
and sure enough, Andy Warhol
was always there.

977
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:24,008
And since he now knew me

978
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,944
because I became known
as Peter Berlin,

979
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,982
he greeted me and I greeted him.

980
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,146
One day my friend Koos,

981
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,083
who is a designer in New York,

982
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,520
had an invitation

983
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:43,063
to one of his tea parties.

984
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,561
So I walked in

985
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,965
and then I heard him saying

986
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,038
"Oh, Peter, I like your pants."

987
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,767
So I had these incredible intricate things,

988
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,501
you know, crotch and ass,

989
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,473
and he asked me polite as he is

990
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:01,674
"Oh, may I take a picture of your pants?"

991
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,478
And I said "Yes."

992
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,019
And the picture... I will never forget...

993
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,783
I was sort of leaning against the table

994
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:13,985
sticking out my ass with the leather pants

995
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:18,567
and Andy with this little Instamatic or whatever,

996
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,828
you know, little camera,

997
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,734
snapped the picture. "Thank you, thank you."

998
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,398
But Andy turned to me and said
"Peter, I'm so glad that you come

999
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:30,569
"and I think what you are doing is really great."

1000
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,607
And you know, it sometimes makes
a difference who gives you a compliment.

1001
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,850
He offered me to,

1002
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,985
to use his staff,

1003
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:47,789
to use his studio.

1004
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,922
You know, he had the equipment

1005
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,660
and he said. "Peter, I think it would
be very interesting

1006
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:56,772
"for people to see how you do it.

1007
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,566
"So please,

1008
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,536
"I offer you to use it

1009
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,579
"and I will be helpful, you
know, if you need me."

1010
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,909
And I said, "Oh, thank you very much."

1011
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:11,748
Now do you think I picked up on that?

1012
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:12,986
Never.

1013
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:19,127
I spent a lot of time on Fire Island.

1014
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:23,822
Now the reason I got to
Fire Island in the first place

1015
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,992
was because I met Robert Mapplethorpe...

1016
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,832
where did I meet him?

1017
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,776
I can't remember if that was sort
of in a dungeon somewhere

1018
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:38,539
because that was Mapplethorpe's world.

1019
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:41,980
I mean our worlds collided quite often.

1020
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,708
So he told me

1021
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,115
that they rented this house on Fire Island

1022
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:51,488
and if I have nothing to do-
and I never had really anything to do-

1023
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,861
I'm welcome to stay in that house.

1024
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,890
I got there for the weekend

1025
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:01,036
and the poor people like my friend Robert

1026
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,071
on Monday

1027
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,231
had to work

1028
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:09,534
and I was sort of residing in
that house by myself you know.

1029
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,613
So I was on that bunk bed

1030
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:17,212
with that big window and you just
could look out on the beach,

1031
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,545
you know, people cruising.

1032
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,690
And I mean, fabulous, fabulous.

1033
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:27,559
At that time Robert was not
the big Robert Mapplethorpe.

1034
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:32,758
He just was sort of
starting to be recognized.

1035
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,194
But Robert was

1036
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:39,068
a very down-to-earth person

1037
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:44,910
and driven to have success
and mingling, you know.

1038
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:49,814
In this business it's not just
the photo or the painting what you do.

1039
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,913
It's the people you hang out with-

1040
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,250
that means the people with the money,

1041
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,355
going to the dinner parties.

1042
00:59:57,694 --> 01:00:00,788
And then when they dragged me to
those dinner parties, you know...

1043
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,296
I couldn't wait 'til it was over

1044
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,762
and then going in the underworld again.

1045
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:11,603
Like everybody else
I had seen Peter
on the street,

1046
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,140
so I was rather excited when
I heard that he was going

1047
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:18,076
to be a guest of the party that was
being thrown by a Pacific Heights hostess.

1048
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,707
Among the few other guests who were there

1049
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:23,818
were Peter Berlin and Robert Mapplethorpe

1050
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:27,684
and five or six of us had a
lovely dinner table conversation

1051
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:31,156
and I found him to
be an interesting man

1052
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:35,627
who had a lot of interests beyond
what I might have imagined.

1053
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,900
And I liked him very much.

1054
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,261
But three days later I
was out at Land's End-

1055
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:45,373
the sort of cruising
meat market of The City

1056
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,874
and there was Peter

1057
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,138
sort of posed in the crook
of a weathered tree,

1058
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,282
creating this sort of tableau, really.

1059
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,917
And without thinking I just walked up to him

1060
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:58,053
and said, "Hi, Peter, it's Armistead."

1061
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,121
And there was no
response whatsoever.

1062
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:03,258
I had committed the cardinal sin
of breaking that wall.

1063
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,821
It was kind of like, I don't know,

1064
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:10,227
like walking up to
Minnie Mouse at Disneyland

1065
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,336
and saying, "Hi, Suzanne," because
you know the person inside the suit.

1066
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,229
I had broken the spell,

1067
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:20,467
so I walked away rather sheepishly
and let him continue with the tableau.

1068
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:25,208
Robert curated a show in New York

1069
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,872
where he asked me to be part of it

1070
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,417
and there were five
or six photographers.

1071
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,380
And then he photographed me-

1072
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:37,716
one of the very few people
who I felt comfortable

1073
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:41,261
or actually obliged to say okay,

1074
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,921
if you want to take a photo,
take a photo.

1075
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,693
So he made a photo, several photos,

1076
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:49,730
one on Fire Island and
several in his studio.

1077
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:54,342
But I only can remember now that
one what is still hanging on my wall

1078
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,870
that was done on the boardwalk
somewhere on the island.

1079
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,950
And then there was another
photo what he shot

1080
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,310
in his studio

1081
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:07,923
and I remember when I lived
in San Francisco then,

1082
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,322
it was hanging in the hall somewhere

1083
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,192
and my friend James

1084
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:18,059
just had a fight I think with someone

1085
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,032
and everything was flying

1086
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,037
including that framed photo of Robert's.

1087
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,505
So I only have that one other photograph

1088
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,075
what's still hanging on my wall

1089
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,343
because no other fight erupted

1090
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,244
and it didn't end up
on the floor, you know.

1091
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,318
That was my friend Robert.

1092
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,751
And then of course he got sick-

1093
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,789
after my friend Jochen got sick...

1094
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,984
all my friends got sick.

1095
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,261
They all acquired the virus.

1096
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,200
And I was one of those people

1097
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:56,395
who didn't acquire the virus

1098
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,870
and I'm still negative.

1099
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:03,378
I just meant at the beginning when
all of your friends were dying,

1100
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,343
I mean you must have felt,

1101
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:08,211
"God, I'm not dying and they're all dying."

1102
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:10,852
And I'll bet a lot of people out there

1103
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,681
think or thought at one point, you know,

1104
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:15,052
"He was a porn star in the '70s..."

1105
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:18,193
Oh, yeah. No, that wouldn't
have been a surprise

1106
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,154
to have heard that Peter Berlin had it,

1107
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:25,357
of course, the way he lived and
the way his conduct was,

1108
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,503
people wouldn't be surprised.

1109
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,327
What they, of course, didn't know

1110
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,531
is that by the virtue of

1111
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,900
conducting my sexual life

1112
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:37,545
basically as a safe sex proposition...

1113
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,274
so I was spared that

1114
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:43,009
and I can see it as being lucky.

1115
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:47,555
On the other hand I have seen
all my friends go away

1116
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,849
and I ask myself now,

1117
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:53,723
who in the hell is the lucky one?

1118
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,497
In 1976, I was going to a nightclub

1119
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:10,070
and somebody came to me
and asked me to dance

1120
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,441
and I never, I'm not a dancer.

1121
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,449
So I rebuffed him

1122
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,609
and then I was outside
sitting in the car.

1123
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,047
It was sort of already cool

1124
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,123
and then that boy came,

1125
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,291
saw me in the car and
approached me again

1126
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,123
and I said, "Sit down in the car

1127
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,063
"because it's so cold
out there, you know."

1128
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,572
So we started talking and
I took him home.

1129
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,100
That was James,

1130
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,999
my friend James.

1131
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,440
He had problems with a roommate

1132
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,042
and then I said. "Well, then stay
here with me" and-

1133
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:50,117
I lived in a studio apartment-

1134
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:51,913
and he never moved out.

1135
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,485
So he just stayed

1136
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:57,490
and we had one bed

1137
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,491
and he slept in my bed.

1138
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,452
And at that time

1139
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:05,431
I was doing a lot of

1140
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,501
shooting myself with photos

1141
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,333
so I said. "I want to take
some pictures of you."

1142
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,600
And he became a little strange.

1143
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,245
I said, "What's wrong?"

1144
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:22,610
And then he said, "Yeah, I don't
know, but you know I have,

1145
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,948
"I had polio as a child

1146
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,521
"and I have a deformed leg."

1147
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,594
So we did pictures by just hiding that

1148
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,899
and even the videos,
what you can see, you'd never know.

1149
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,431
When we went to the beach

1150
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,469
he knew how to have a towel there

1151
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:47,268
and so he did a great job and
most people didn't even know.

1152
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:51,603
It was such

1153
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,472
an awful thing in his head,

1154
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:57,915
he never got to accept it.

1155
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:02,557
I remember even before he died,

1156
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,023
he just looked at his leg,

1157
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,924
"I hate this leg, I hate this leg."

1158
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:11,123
And that was part of my way to trying,

1159
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,665
when he moved in

1160
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,300
to give him a little support and you know,

1161
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:18,668
to not, you know, because of
that I wouldn't like him.

1162
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:21,203
Those things don't bother me.

1163
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,670
I stayed with him

1164
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,740
about 20 years.

1165
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,609
He said one day,

1166
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:33,220
"You know what is today?"
I said, "No."

1167
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,049
"It's our 20th anniversary."

1168
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:41,185
So then when he got sick
and battled along...

1169
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,661
he was sort of a person who loved living

1170
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:49,131
and that's why I like him.
He had the spirit of exuberance

1171
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:54,036
and liked to buy stuff and give stuff.

1172
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,610
You know, at some point
he got paralyzed

1173
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,976
and I had to wheel him in
the wheelchair...

1174
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,379
had to go to the hospitals...

1175
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:06,220
but then he got these infections
again and again

1176
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,686
and one day he said,

1177
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:11,255
"I will not take any..."

1178
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:17,592
I remember the day when
we went to his doctor.

1179
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,394
She said,

1180
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,468
"OK, James...

1181
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,299
"then we just will snow you out."

1182
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,572
I don't know how long after that,

1183
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,677
maybe in that week,

1184
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,314
one morning then he said

1185
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,777
"Can you make me a pudding?"

1186
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,679
And I knew what that meant,

1187
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,381
because he told me...

1188
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,220
"I will kill myself one day."

1189
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,530
And I never believed it

1190
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,632
because they all say,
"Oh, I'll kill myself." but then... you know.

1191
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,826
But he made his decision

1192
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,730
and he talked about
already having saved,

1193
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,502
I think we had two
bottles of morphine.

1194
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,161
I was going in the kitchen

1195
01:08:02,196 --> 01:08:03,611
I was going in the kitchen

1196
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,740
and doing the cooking
of the pudding,

1197
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,246
because I never believed
in the instant stuff

1198
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,216
so I was cooking there.

1199
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,083
And I was so stunned, you know.

1200
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,190
He was in his little room

1201
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,792
waiting for me to bring
him the pudding.

1202
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,764
And I made a vanilla pudding

1203
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,363
and a chocolate pudding
because he liked...

1204
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:30,369
he called it the swirlie... he liked the mixed
thing with the chocolate and vanilla.

1205
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:35,735
I brought him the thing

1206
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,770
and he took that bottle-

1207
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,111
and I was sitting there
and he was sitting up

1208
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,515
and he started to eat it.

1209
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,755
I watched him and
I already saw him

1210
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:58,162
sort of responding
to that overdose.

1211
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,233
So I said,

1212
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,597
"Scoot down a little bit,
you know, get comfortable."

1213
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:04,898
And his last words were,

1214
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:10,840
"You always have to
tell me what to do."

1215
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,612
Scoot down and fell asleep...

1216
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:18,319
and slept.

1217
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:21,516
I called a friend of his actually.

1218
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,451
I said, "Come on, can you come over?"

1219
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,219
So she came over

1220
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,522
and I was sitting in the living room

1221
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:31,188
and he was snoring actually...

1222
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,699
it was this open mouth snoring.

1223
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,628
And we heard him sleep

1224
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:40,206
and we talked and he slept for hours

1225
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,640
and then slowly

1226
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:48,348
we could hear the snoring
getting weaker and weaker

1227
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,619
'til it was only breathing.

1228
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,784
And at some point

1229
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,290
I told her...

1230
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,657
I wouldn't even go in the room.

1231
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,593
You know, like some people say

1232
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,234
somebody died in my arms,

1233
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,462
for me death is

1234
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,903
sort of... all ready... it has
nothing to do with the person.

1235
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:15,301
It's gone.

1236
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,310
So she went in and said,
"He's already cold..."

1237
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,688
But for 20 years... I mean...

1238
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:30,882
we lived together.

1239
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,592
We had fights.

1240
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,958
I know one day he was
sitting in the closet

1241
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,357
and crying because unfortunately

1242
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,827
he had a big drug problem.

1243
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,733
So I guess if he wouldn't
have died of that,

1244
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:48,268
he would have died of drugs, you know?

1245
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,638
And James...

1246
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,808
I know he got a dog...

1247
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,455
he wanted a little dog
- a little Shih-Tzu

1248
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:04,017
and I always said, "It's a
living thing already... plants,

1249
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,385
you know, you have to water,

1250
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,588
but you know, a dog you have to go and...

1251
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,562
And sure enough when
we had him, he got sick

1252
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,259
and I had to take care of him, you know

1253
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,370
and then he said,

1254
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:19,196
"So you have something...

1255
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,899
"to love,"

1256
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,739
when he's gone.

1257
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:44,321
So I'm still poor and now old,
so what's left for me?

1258
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,934
Do you think you were
a fashion influence?

1259
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,732
No, no, no. Maybe
one or two boys,

1260
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:54,842
they dared to imitate me.

1261
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,808
The main thing what
I would like to have achieved

1262
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:02,383
is being in the class of a Calvin Klein

1263
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:03,745
or Armani

1264
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,987
and would have given
that what in France

1265
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,292
that Gaultier has done.

1266
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,961
Am I coming across as
very bitter about that?

1267
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,997
Maybe. And the inability

1268
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,064
of me to have given

1269
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:23,729
some kind of

1270
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:28,976
an inspiration

1271
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:33,046
to a young beautiful man

1272
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:34,683
to just say okay,

1273
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:38,684
"I have a dick and I have an ass.

1274
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,079
"I don't think I should
necessarily hide it."

1275
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:45,450
I don't mean that he should
display it in a naked fashion.

1276
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,857
I think that's as boring

1277
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,530
as being dressed badly.

1278
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,328
But you know, there is a way of

1279
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:58,136
using fashion and using fabric

1280
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:02,069
to sort of enhance your personality.

1281
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,468
And if you look good,

1282
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,114
then you shouldn't hide it.
I think it's even a crime.

1283
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:09,849
Oh, I remember porn stars
before him,

1284
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,046
but there weren't that many
that you knew their names.

1285
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,879
There weren't that many
that had a persona, you know,

1286
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:18,788
that was so extreme
and so really defined.

1287
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,087
That was the thing.

1288
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,829
You didn't ever hope he would
do something else

1289
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,865
because you knew he would not.

1290
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:27,162
Was he the first porno star?
I don't know.

1291
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,767
I think the first one that would
come to mind for me

1292
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:31,462
would be Casey Donovan.

1293
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,072
They're equally memorable.

1294
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:37,974
I mean porn stars now have what?

1295
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,671
A 15-minute shelf life...
or is it 14 minutes?

1296
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:45,916
And he has endured for
all this time as have a handful.

1297
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,450
I mean there's Casey Donovan,

1298
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,883
Al Parker.

1299
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:55,828
These people made a place
in gay men's hearts,

1300
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,058
you know, and they meant
something. They were icons.

1301
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:01,998
And Peter Berlin, who made fewer films

1302
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,530
than any of the aforementioned,

1303
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,971
is very powerful in that group.

1304
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:12,045
He is one of the enduring
stars of this genre

1305
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:14,108
and I think that's amazing

1306
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:20,279
because decades have passed
and he's still remembered.

1307
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,849
He was really thought of as an artist.

1308
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,721
I was thought of as an actor

1309
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,727
and they weren't quite
sure about that.

1310
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,827
Well, watching <i>Nights in Black Leather</i>

1311
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,697
gave me such a strong feeling for Peter

1312
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:40,107
that I strongly felt he should be

1313
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:43,642
a grand marshal in the Gay Parade.

1314
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:47,009
So I think he's certainly worthy of honor.

1315
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,184
I don't think he'd enjoy that, would he?

1316
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,521
That would be the last thing
what I would do.

1317
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:57,682
I don't know if he ever had more than
one pair of those tight pants.

1318
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,125
It's interesting...

1319
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,229
And those should definitely
go into a museum

1320
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,456
with Jackie's pink suit, believe me.

1321
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:07,527
'Cause many, many people have
fantasized about those pants.

1322
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,297
He <i>should</i> make a new movie...
for gerontophiliacs.

1323
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,269
I mean however old he is,
there are people,

1324
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:13,602
wrinkle queens, that like them older.

1325
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,710
If you would tell me

1326
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,243
I could

1327
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,277
redo my life...

1328
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:26,880
I would do it in a split second.

1329
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:30,686
Just a repeat, I would do the loop...

1330
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:34,827
without any... because the pain
what I suffered...

1331
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,626
even the loss, you know.

1332
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:47,334
I mean I wish only what I could
redo is the happiness

1333
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,937
and well-being of others in my life...
I would like to have changed,

1334
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:54,810
But me? My God, what a blast I had.

1335
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:57,975
What, what a - my God.

1336
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:05,986
The day I experienced sexuality.

1337
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:11,758
My God... what a creator there is

1338
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:15,961
to have that put in my life.

1339
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:02,223
You think these pants
make my ass look fat?
