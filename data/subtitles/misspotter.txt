1
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:10,050
<i>There's something delicious about</i>
<i>writing the first words of a story.</i>

2
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:14,347
<i>You can never quite tell</i>
<i>where they'll take you.</i>

3
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:17,391
<i>Mine took me here.</i>

4
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,318
<i>Looking back, the city and I</i>
<i>never much liked each other.</i>

5
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,823
<i>An unmarried woman, after all,</i>
<i>was expected to behave in</i>

6
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:33,740
<i>very particular ways.</i>

7
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:37,245
<i>Which did not include traipsing</i>
<i>from publisher to publisher</i>

8
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,122
<i>with a gaggle of friends.</i>

9
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:48,463
Now, listen to me,
you must not be afraid.

10
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:51,300
And don't talk too much.

11
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:59,808
<i>Friends who, sadly, others were</i>
<i>not so keen to meet.</i>

12
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:12,030
I've been selling my drawings
for greeting cards, place cards,

13
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,532
etcetera for seven years.

14
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:43,144
Bunnies in jackets
with brass buttons.

15
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,937
How ever do you imagine
such things?

16
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,146
I don't imagine them.

17
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,149
They're quite real.
They're my friends.

18
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:51,819
Are you based the animal
characters on your friends?

19
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:54,447
No, the animals are my friends.

20
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:57,408
Before Peter Rabbit there was
Benjamin Bunny,

21
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,701
and then Sir Isaac the Newt.

22
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,620
I have their drawings as well,
if you'd like to see them.

23
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:03,997
That won't be necessary.
Unfortunately, Miss Potter.

24
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:08,627
It is 'Miss' Potter, is it not?
Yes. Of course. Silly of me.

25
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:10,420
Unfortunately, the market for
children's books...

26
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:12,632
Yes, of course.
I completely understand.

27
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:15,134
It was silly of me,
with no experience of these...

28
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:19,221
F. Warne and Company would like to
publish your little book, Miss Potter.

29
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,516
But best not to get overly hopeful.

30
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:24,853
I know publishing your book will
not sell a great number of copies,

31
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:27,730
but I think we can turn
a small profit.

32
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:35,112
My dear Mr Warne, well,
I'm pleased. Very pleased indeed.

33
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:38,824
I shall do everything possible to
ensure that you've not made a mistake.

34
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:42,704
Miss Wiggin, I believe we can go.

35
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,124
Thank you very much indeed.
Messrs Warne, for your time.

36
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:51,629
Our pleasure. My brother always
knows what he's doing.

37
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,137
Oh, I'm quite particular about
book size and price,

38
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:02,557
and I'd like to avoid that
dreadful Gothic typeface

39
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:05,100
your children's books usually have.

40
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,394
I'm sure everything will be
to your satisfaction.

41
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:10,398
Miss Potter.

42
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:12,817
Your...

43
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:16,112
Of course.

44
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:18,531
My portfolio.

45
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:22,242
Come along, Peter.

46
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:36,466
- Sir Isaac, the newt!
- You can't be serious, Fruing.

47
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:38,718
- That book won't sell ten copies.
- Of course not!

48
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:43,723
- However, the thought did occur to me...
- Norman!

49
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:46,100
We promised our little brother
a project.

50
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,644
If he makes a muck of it,
what will it matter?

51
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:52,524
I think Miss Potter may turn out
to be a Godsend.

52
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,233
Home, Miss Potter?

53
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:59,238
No, Saunders.
Drive me through the park.

54
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:00,447
Through all the parks.

55
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:03,535
- I beg your pardon, Miss Potter?
- Drive!

56
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:05,536
Walk on.

57
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:08,665
We did it!

58
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,793
Did you hear my heart?
It was a kettle drum.

59
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,711
You see? We cannot stay
home all our lives.

60
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:17,423
We must present ourselves
to the world.

61
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:20,425
And we must look upon it
as an adventure.

62
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,653
Faster, Saunders!

63
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:44,908
- Faster, Saunders, if you please!
- No, Miss Beatrix. No!

64
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,202
- Fast as you can, old boy.
- Go on!

65
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,836
Oh, I say!

66
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:14,646
Saunders.

67
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:27,535
Beatrix, where have you been?
It's after four o'clock.

68
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,329
I'm not a child. I can do things
without my mother's permission.

69
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:32,706
I was hoping to use the carriage
myself this afternoon.

70
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:33,832
Where were you?

71
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:37,044
I took a drive.
With my friends.

72
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:04,322
You don't have any friends.

73
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:08,243
Yes, I do, Mother.
Every time I draw.

74
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:14,331
Some of your paintings are
quite pretty, Beatrix,

75
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:17,460
but I'm not going to deceive you
as your father does

76
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:19,754
and call them great art.

77
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,017
Well, my friend,
when I am a published author

78
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,936
then we shall see.

79
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:54,956
Beatrix, Bertram,
time for good nights.

80
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:57,417
- I haven't finished yet.
- Come on, hurry up.

81
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:00,794
- Bertram.
- There! I got him.

82
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:03,715
- Bertram, you're barbaric.
- Come on, you two.

83
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,716
Hurry up. Down you go.

84
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:08,720
Slowly!

85
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:15,726
Hurry, Rupert! It won't do t
be late to the 'Hydes'.

86
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:18,020
Doesn't Mama look beautiful,
Beatrix?

87
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:20,648
Being in a temper puts such
a rose into her cheeks.

88
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:22,942
When you grow up, Beatrix,
and have to run a household,

89
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,820
plan parties, keep a social calendar
and put up with a man

90
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:27,654
who's never been introduced to a clock,

91
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,033
your cheeks will glow too.

92
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,118
Look at this ribbon.

93
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:35,330
That's unsightly.
Change her into something decent.

94
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:36,413
And give this nightdress away.

95
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:38,540
Oh, this will never do.
I'm just all fingers and thumbs!

96
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:42,211
You're impossible, Rupert!
We are so late.

97
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:44,004
What have you drawn today, Beatrix?

98
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:46,633
Benjamin Bunny having a rest.

99
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,134
His ears are getting
better and better.

100
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:53,222
This shading here is very good,
Beatrix.

101
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:55,850
Say your good nights now, children.

102
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:58,519
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Beatrix.

103
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:00,730
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Beatrix.

104
00:11:00,897 --> 00:11:02,856
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Bertram.

105
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:03,899
Good night, Father.

106
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,025
Now, hurry upstairs.

107
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,695
- Come on, mustn't make Mama and Papa.
- Later than they are.

108
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,822
- Oh, children.
- What now?

109
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:13,033
On my way home, I happened to
walke down Piccadilly.

110
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:15,202
And what do you think
jumped into my pockets?

111
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,624
Something very special for
the young entomologist.

112
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,543
And something very suitable for
the young lady

113
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:25,421
who's very soon to grow up
to run a fine home,

114
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:26,630
just like her mother.

115
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:29,634
- We'll open them upstairs. Come on.
- Thank you, Father.

116
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:32,720
- Thank you, Father.
- Come on.

117
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:42,522
- Late, late late!
- We are not late.

118
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,399
We will never be invited
to the Hydes' again.

119
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,900
Heaven's sake, Helen,
it's polite to be a little late.

120
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,027
Now get in the carriage.

121
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:51,405
This isn't polite late,
this is late, late.

122
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:56,827
Right, wee ones,
one story and then bed.

123
00:11:56,952 --> 00:12:01,249
I want Beatrix to tell a story.
Hers are funny.

124
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:04,418
Indeed they are, and I know exactly
what it'll be about.

125
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:05,919
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.

126
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:10,341
Precisely. Tom, Hunker,
are you ready to play in a story?

127
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:12,217
Oh, yes. We're excellent actors.

128
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:15,596
Well, we shall see about that.
This will be your test.

129
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:17,014
Over there.

130
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:24,438
Once upon a time, those two excellent
housekeepers, Lucinda and Jane,

131
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:27,734
bought some shiny new porcelain
food which they set out

132
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:30,528
on their perfectly appointed
dining room table.

133
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:32,947
Then, they decided to go for a walk.

134
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:38,119
Suddenly, there came a scuffling
noise from the kitchen.

135
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:41,538
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker crept out.

136
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:45,418
The two mice saw that
the dining table was set for dinner.

137
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:48,004
Tom Thumb leapt up and
took a big bite

138
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:51,716
from the first plate
and broke his tooth.

139
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:54,134
Who we expecting someone?

140
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:56,011
That's my publishers.

141
00:12:56,846 --> 00:13:00,933
It's not a social call.
In fact, I'm rather dreading it.

142
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:03,727
I wish you wouldn't invite
trades people in to the house.

143
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:05,230
They carry dust.

144
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:09,024
Well, next time,
I shall go to their office.

145
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:14,947
Mr Norman Warne.

146
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,158
Miss Potter.

147
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,495
I hope you will forgive my intrusion
into your daily routine.

148
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:21,620
I was expecting one of the...

149
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:24,706
Ah, yes,
I am Harold and Fruing's brother.

150
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:27,000
I've recently joined the firm
and they have done me

151
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,629
the great honour of assigning
your book to me.

152
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:34,716
Thank you. It was most gracious
of you to invite me to...

153
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:36,427
- Tea.
- Yes, I would love some.

154
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:38,721
Yes, thank you.
Lemon.

155
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,639
Thank you.

156
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,647
Extraordinary!

157
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,149
Funny!

158
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,903
Delightful and magical and
so beautifully drawn.

159
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,697
I am utterly, utterly speechless.

160
00:13:57,447 --> 00:14:00,534
Perhaps we should discuss
our business, Mr Warne.

161
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,328
I put your drawings aside with
the greatest reluctance.

162
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:07,708
Your brother's letter makes
two proposals

163
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,044
which I find quite unacceptable.

164
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:14,340
First, they'd like the drawings
to be in colour.

165
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,717
I'm adamant they be
in black and white.

166
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:19,052
But Peter Rabbit's blue jacket
and the red radishes,

167
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:22,222
Surely you would like your enchanting
drawings reproduced as they are?

168
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:26,311
Well, of course I would prefer colour,
but colour will make the book cost

169
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:29,898
far more than little rabbits
can afford. I'm adamant.

170
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:32,734
Which brings us to
your brother's second point.

171
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:36,403
They wish to reduce the number
of drawings by nearly a third.

172
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,239
Totally unacceptable.

173
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:40,825
Let me explain.
The idea of reducing the number

174
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,119
of drawings was not my brother's
but my own.

175
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:46,038
If we can reduce the number
to 31 precisely,

176
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:48,415
then the illustrations for
the entire book could be printed

177
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:51,836
on a single sheet of paper using
what we call the three-colour process,

178
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:57,299
that you desire, and at a relatively
low level of cost. Yes?

179
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:02,596
I've given your book a great deal
of attention, truly.

180
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,807
I would like it to look
colourful on the shelf

181
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:07,936
so that it stands out
from ordinary books.

182
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:09,937
You have given it some thought.

183
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:13,316
Which other books have you
supervised, Mr Warne?

184
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:13,942
Personally?

185
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,610
- Yes.
- This will be my first.

186
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,658
Miss Potter, I have recently
informed my brothers and my mother

187
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:26,037
that I am no longer content to
stay at home and play nursemaid

188
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,455
solely because I am the youngest son.

189
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,793
No. I would like a properjob,
working for my family's firm

190
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,919
and they have assigned me you.

191
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:36,798
Does that make things clearer?

192
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:41,427
In other words,
you have no experience whatsoever,

193
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:44,221
but because you've made
a nuisance of yourself,

194
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:48,017
demanding a chance,
they've fobbed you off on me.

195
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:51,729
Miss Potter, I know all too well
what my brothers intended,

196
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:55,524
giving me your, your 'bunny book',
as they call it,

197
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:59,445
but I find your book quite
enchanting, delightful,

198
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:04,325
and if they intended to fob me off,
as you say, then we shall show them.

199
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,120
We shall give them a bunny book
to conjure with,

200
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:10,123
In colours, mixed to your
satisfaction in front of

201
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:12,332
your very eyes at the printer.

202
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:13,710
At the printer?

203
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,211
Oh, I could never.

204
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:17,504
I will escort you there myself.

205
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:20,424
If you will allow me the the honour.

206
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:22,134
Why would I never?

207
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,345
Of course I'll go.
I'm a grown woman.

208
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,929
Miss Wiggin will be there.

209
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:30,018
I see absolutely no reason why
an artist shouldn't visit her printer.

210
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:31,852
Excellent, Miss Potter.

211
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,938
Jolly good. Thank you.

212
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:38,109
I shall make all the arrangements,
and I am, in every way,

213
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:40,611
my dear lady, at your service.

214
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:45,908
You and rabbits, extraordinary.
Excuse me.

215
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,539
Johnson, come and get
the charms, would you?

216
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:55,751
- Slowly, slowly. Put it there.
- I will be careful, ma'am.

217
00:16:56,753 --> 00:17:00,923
One, two, three... ten.

218
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:05,345
<i>When I was ten, my mother badgered</i>
<i>my father into spending the summer</i>

219
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,932
<i>in the Lake District,</i>
<i>as did other fashionable families.</i>

220
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:13,894
<i>Like an animal released from its cage,</i>
<i>I fell under its spell.</i>

221
00:17:16,064 --> 00:17:19,526
Mind your frocks now.
Come here!

222
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:23,403
The woods are full of fairies
and little folk that look for

223
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,531
children that get their
clothes dirty.

224
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:29,826
And when they find them,
they send the fairy beasts at night,

225
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:32,955
with sharp teeth and a ready
appetite for young flesh.

226
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,415
- I'm coming to get you, Bea!
- No

227
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:54,018
Yes!

228
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,942
Bertram. Bertram!

229
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:06,114
Don't! They're farmers' children.
Their hands. Germs. Come on.

230
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,740
Bertram! Bertram!

231
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:28,635
Catch him, Bea!

232
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,432
There he is!

233
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:34,726
Oh, yes!

234
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:40,940
Out of the way!

235
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:46,738
There!

236
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:54,703
There he is.

237
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:16,226
I don't think a thrashing
will be necessary.

238
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:19,229
I'll just leave the window
in the nursery unlatched tonight.

239
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:21,230
The fairy beasts will
take care of the rest.

240
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:23,148
No! I'll stay clean!

241
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:24,400
Bertram.

242
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:28,695
Really, Beatrix, What young man
is ever going to marry a girl

243
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,114
with a faceful of mud?

244
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,824
Well, I shan't marry,
so it doesn't matter.

245
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,409
Of course you shall marry.

246
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:37,121
All girls marry. I did.
Your grandmother did.

247
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,832
Even Fiona will one day.

248
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,920
- Well, I shan't. I shall draw.
- Oh, those silly drawings.

249
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:45,337
Then who will love you?

250
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:49,133
My art and my animals.
I won't need more love than that.

251
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:53,346
Perhaps not at 11, but let's see
if you still feel the same way at 18.

252
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,057
I drew Mama when we first met
and she married me.

253
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:59,394
And, Fiona, doesn't mud wash off?

254
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,019
Bertram, come along.

255
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,609
Die, you little devil!

256
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:10,821
Right. Prince Charming himself
couldn't resist

257
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,240
such a bonny, wee girl.

258
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:15,535
Not when he meets my brother,
Vlad the lmpaler.

259
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,913
- Got you!
- Bedtime my young reprobates.

260
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:22,916
Now, shall I leave a window
open, or?

261
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:25,420
No! I don't like fairy beasts.

262
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:28,463
Well, it is a well-known fact that
fairy beasts never eat a child

263
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:30,592
when he's tucked up in his own bed.

264
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:34,429
The fairies have been
in the north country

265
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:37,598
for hundreds of years,
and have had many adventures.

266
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,518
I told you about you
a changingly child?

267
00:20:40,643 --> 00:20:41,310
No.

268
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:43,313
Yes, several times.

269
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:45,606
I want to hear it.

270
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:48,942
Oh, go ahead, Fiona.
I'll tell myself a story.

271
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,236
Right.

272
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:55,240
Once upon a time,
there was a king and a queen.

273
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:58,744
Once upon a time,
there were four little rabbits.

274
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:02,749
Their names were...
Flopsy, Mopsy...

275
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:05,335
Cotton-tail and Peter.

276
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,796
'Now, my dears,
said old Mrs Rabbit one morning,

277
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:11,715
<i>'you may go into the fields</i>
<i>or down the lane,</i>

278
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,220
<i>'but don't go into</i>
<i>Mr McGregor's garden.'</i>

279
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:16,637
"'Why not, Mother?'

280
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:20,642
'Because your father had
an accident there.

281
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:24,645
He was put in a pie
by Mrs McGregor.'

282
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:30,151
<i>Peter, who was very naughty,</i>
<i>ran straightaway to</i>

283
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:31,443
<i>Mr McGregor's garden,</i>

284
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:34,239
and squeezed under the gate.

285
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,657
I like it.

286
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:52,131
<i>But round the end of</i>
<i>the cucumber frame,</i>

287
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:55,926
<i>whom should he meet,</i>
<i>but Mr McGregor!</i>

288
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,429
<i>Peter was out of breath and</i>
<i>trembling with fright,</i>

289
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,640
<i>and he had not the least idea</i>
<i>which way to go.</i>

290
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:03,226
- It's muddy, actually.
- One more, Mr Mortimer.

291
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:04,227
Lighten it up.

292
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:06,520
<i>Mr McGregor caught sight of him</i>
<i>at the corner,</i>

293
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:08,230
<i>but Peter did not care.</i>

294
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:11,817
<i>He slipped underneath the gate</i>
<i>and was safe at last</i>

295
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:13,611
<i>in the wood outside.</i>

296
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:19,116
Not quite. See here?
It's still a bit...

297
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:28,835
<i>When Peter came home</i>
<i>his mother put him to bed</i>

298
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,712
<i>with a tablespoonful of camomile tea.</i>

299
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,050
<i>But Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail</i>
<i>had bread and milk</i>

300
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:39,345
<i>and blackberries for supper.</i>

301
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:48,313
This book, it's changed things
for me, Mr Warne.

302
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:49,605
How so?

303
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,903
For one thing, it's given me
the chance to prove to my mother

304
00:22:56,069 --> 00:23:01,534
that an unmarried woman of 32 can
do more than attend tea parties

305
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:05,121
- and smile at dull conversations.
- Yes, indeed.

306
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:08,415
You know, my family never wanted me
to get into publishing either.

307
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,835
We do make rather a good team,
don't you think?

308
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:16,758
Provided, of course,
we prove them wrong.

309
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:30,730
Mother, this is Miss Potter.

310
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,402
At last, we poor forgotten folk
in Bedford Square get to share

311
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:38,238
some of Norman's excitement.

312
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:41,031
Mrs Warne, it's so kind of you
to invite me.

313
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:44,743
Nonsense. It was the desperate
act of a woman who was beginning

314
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:46,119
to forget what her son looked like.

315
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:48,539
Mother!
And this is my sister, Amelia.

316
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:49,665
Hello.

317
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,792
Norman allowed us a peek at
Peter Rabbit, Miss Potter.

318
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,503
We found it utterly charming.
So we wheedled, cajoled,

319
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:57,714
and absolutely insisted that
Norman bring you round for tea.

320
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,926
I have decided that you and I
are going to be friends.

321
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:02,804
Have you?

322
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:07,432
Well, Norman tells me that
you're unmarried, as am I,

323
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:08,934
and that you're not
unhappy about it.

324
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,936
And I can't tell you how much
that pleases me.

325
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,647
Why can't you talk about
the weather like other girls?

326
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:16,442
Well, all the other unmarried
daughters in our circle,

327
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,152
and, believe me, there are many
they sit around all day,

328
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:21,154
gossiping and unaccountably
bursting into tears.

329
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,909
But you have done something.
You've written a book.

330
00:24:25,535 --> 00:24:28,829
I warn you, I am prepared to
like you very much.

331
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:31,499
Well, in that case, I shall have
to like you too, Miss Warne.

332
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:33,917
Call me Millie, and that's to be
the last of Miss Potter too,

333
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:34,419
I'm afraid.

334
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:36,921
Absolutely. Beatrix, by all means.

335
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:39,715
Thank goodness, the tea!
I'm beginning to feel quite ill

336
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:41,134
with all this bonhomie.

337
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:42,634
Oh, do let's have tea
in the garden, Mother.

338
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,846
It's too beautiful a day
in every way not to share it

339
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,346
with the flowers.

340
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:51,352
Well, I love to garden.
Mother disapproves,

341
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:53,855
but I can't help myself.
I love flowers shockingly.

342
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,023
That's why you have
the hands of a greengrocer.

343
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:57,232
I do not!

344
00:24:57,357 --> 00:25:00,819
Thank heavens Norman sometimes
deigns to read to me.

345
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:02,696
If I had to rely on you
for companionship,

346
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:04,615
I should expire of loneliness.

347
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,910
My mother's taste in books,
Miss Potter, and, I'm afraid,

348
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:09,621
in life, runs to the er...
melodramatic.

349
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:11,413
Oh, nonsense.

350
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,917
I like good English biographies
and you know it.

351
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:18,337
I loathe silly romances, such as
the ones your brothers publish.

352
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:20,048
My brothers and I, Mother.

353
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:22,133
I am part of the firm now too,
you know.

354
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:25,636
A sweet-natured boy like you
does not need to work.

355
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,846
Your brothers provide quite well
for all of us,

356
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:30,349
and I need your smile here.

357
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:33,310
But then, no-one listens to
a crotchety old lady

358
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:34,103
in a wheelchair.

359
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:35,813
Indeed they don't, Mother.

360
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,440
My mother may be crotchety,
Miss Potter,

361
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:39,526
but she does have an eye
for beautiful things.

362
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,818
She was fascinated by your drawings.

363
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:45,323
Utterly unique.

364
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:50,744
Well, when I see something unusual,
I'm not contentjust to look at it.

365
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:52,913
I must capture it.

366
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:56,334
Last summer, in the farmyard,
I was drawing something

367
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:58,961
that was quite lovely in the sun,

368
00:25:59,086 --> 00:26:03,258
and suddenly, I realised I was
drawing the pigs' swill bucket.

369
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,593
I had to laugh at myself.

370
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:09,931
I feel a bit of a chill, Norman.
Can you take me inside?

371
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:11,516
- Of course.
- Please excuse me.

372
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:14,018
It was delightful meeting you,
Miss Potter.

373
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:14,935
And you.

374
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,606
Do stay longer, and teach
Millie how to behave.

375
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,943
I think that means she likes you.

376
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:27,448
Did she say she likes to
draw swill buckets?

377
00:26:27,574 --> 00:26:31,243
Indeed she did, Mother.
Indeed she did.

378
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:35,330
I think by Wednesday, you could
hang the lace curtains upstairs.

379
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:39,626
- Then at least it will look like summer,
even if it doesn't feel like it. -Yes, Madam

380
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:42,797
Oh, Beatrix. What is this stain
on your blouse?

381
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:45,008
Jane says it won't wash out,
and she's tried everything.

382
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:47,218
- Oh, it's ink.
- Ink?

383
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:50,137
I must have brushed against
something at the printers'.

384
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:53,016
Jane, I'm very sorry for causing
you extra work.

385
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:56,144
Jane, take the blouse away.
Give it to the poor.

386
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:59,230
This behaviour shows scant
regard for your father's money.

387
00:26:59,355 --> 00:27:03,442
Well, one day, I shall make enough
money to buy my own clothes.

388
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:06,445
I'm far too old to be living off
the generosity of my father.

389
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,030
You're too old to be
spending so much time

390
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:10,616
in the company of a man
who takes you to printers!

391
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:13,994
Your father does not approve,
and neither do I.

392
00:27:14,162 --> 00:27:16,413
Mr Warne is publishing my book.

393
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:21,211
Oh, that book! I can hardly wait
till it's finished and forgotten.

394
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:23,128
I don't understand you, Beatrix.

395
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:26,215
Your father and I have introduced
you to so many suitable young men

396
00:27:26,382 --> 00:27:30,010
of your class, young men of fortune,
and impeccably good family.

397
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:34,516
Oh, certainly, like that charming
fellow, Lionel Stokely.

398
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:38,435
Lionel is a particular favourite
of his uncle, the earl,

399
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,230
whom we visit every summer
at Stokely Court.

400
00:27:41,396 --> 00:27:45,108
Oh, and I do regret terribly that
I didn't accept Harry Haddon-Bell.

401
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:47,319
Harry's great-grandfather
went to Sandhurst.

402
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,197
Harry's grandfather
went to Sandhurst.

403
00:27:49,364 --> 00:27:51,324
Harry's father
went to Sandhurst.

404
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:54,326
And so I went to Sandhurst.

405
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:58,830
Father and I and the gamekeeper often
go out riding in the morning...

406
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,125
Ashton's a crack shot.

407
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,546
But no, you're just
a pig-headed girl.

408
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:07,131
Mr Warne is asking for you
at the door, Miss.

409
00:28:07,257 --> 00:28:10,551
Mr Warne? He's not expected.

410
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:13,136
Unannounced. Perfection!

411
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:34,241
Come on, here.

412
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:41,624
Two sold while we were
at the booksellers.

413
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,042
That amounts to 40 in a week.

414
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,128
- Which is 160 in a month.
- Good gracious!

415
00:28:46,296 --> 00:28:49,048
I'm trying to remember
my twelve-times table.

416
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,010
1,920 in a year.

417
00:28:53,552 --> 00:28:56,013
- I can't breathe.
- That's just in one shop.

418
00:28:56,138 --> 00:28:58,932
My dear Miss Potter,
you are an author.

419
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:00,934
We have achieved
what we set out to do.

420
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,104
We have created a book.

421
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:05,440
Yes.

422
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:07,608
What's the matter?

423
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:10,612
A cloud just passed across your face.

424
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:15,950
You've been very generous
with your time, Mr Warne,

425
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:19,746
Shown me things that
I never would have seen.

426
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:21,455
Printing houses!

427
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:26,502
- I shall miss your company.
- Are you losing my company?

428
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,423
It just occurred to me
that the book is out

429
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:33,926
and our association is
coming to an end.

430
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:35,220
Miss Potter.

431
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:41,017
I had hoped that you might
have other stories.

432
00:29:41,183 --> 00:29:42,309
Really?

433
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:44,436
Really?

434
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,234
Do you know, I recently remembered
one I thought I had forgotten it.

435
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,528
About a duck...

436
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:55,155
a very stupid duck.

437
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,950
Based on one of your friends?

438
00:29:57,366 --> 00:30:00,118
It's based on myself, I think

439
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:02,622
It's a story I told a friend once.

440
00:30:04,374 --> 00:30:07,710
My family summers in the Lake District,
and there was someone there,

441
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:11,713
the grounds man's son, who was
always interested in my stories.

442
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:19,931
Miss Beatrix. Are you skulking?

443
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:24,727
No such thing, Willie Heelis. No.
I was drying off my sketch book.

444
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:31,817
Not bad, Miss Beatrix.

445
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:35,113
Do you have any animal
stories for me today?

446
00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:37,906
I don't. Sorry. Nothing new.

447
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:43,246
That's Jemima.
She doesn't have a story yet.

448
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:44,830
Not a proper one.

449
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:48,125
- Jemima Duck?
- Jemima Puddle-Duck.

450
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,253
And a stupider duck
the world has never seen.

451
00:30:52,255 --> 00:30:55,048
She goes looking for a safe
place to lay her eggs

452
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:57,719
and meets a charming gentleman
with a long bushy tail

453
00:30:57,885 --> 00:31:00,137
and very sharp teeth.

454
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:03,724
Precisely.

455
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:07,604
The gentlemen offers her his shed
and Jemima is surprised to find

456
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,521
that there are so many feathers in it.

457
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:13,233
But then, as I told you,
she is a very stupid duck.

458
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:14,903
I like it.

459
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:20,115
I'd love to paint every view
in this valley,

460
00:31:20,282 --> 00:31:22,535
but I'm not very good at landscapes.

461
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,413
Wait too long and it won't be
here to paint, Miss Beatrix.

462
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:28,833
- Really, that's ridiculous.
- No, I'm serious.

463
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:32,420
The large farms are being broken up
into small plots and sold off.

464
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,839
Well, you can't stand
in the way of progress.

465
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:37,258
So they say.

466
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:41,804
But I say beauty's
worth preserving.

467
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:43,306
I know you do, Willie.

468
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:46,226
But nobody could disagree
with you about that.

469
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:49,938
Well, I'll see you soon, then.

470
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:53,732
Perhaps not, Miss Beatrix.
I'm leaving for Manchester next week.

471
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,943
To study the law?

472
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:59,113
Yes, indeed. I have to better
myself somehow.

473
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:02,450
- Good luck.
- Send me some drawings.

474
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:03,742
I will.

475
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:09,624
<i>He encouraged me to take</i>
<i>my writing seriously.</i>

476
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,000
We must get started on
the new story straight away.

477
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:14,711
Jemima Puddle-Duck.
I think the public should like that,

478
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:17,339
and Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.
What do you think?

479
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:18,799
Well, if you, if you think.

480
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:21,009
Your book has been very
important in my life.

481
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:23,429
You have been very
important in my life.

482
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:24,931
And you in mine, Mr Warne.

483
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:28,142
- And we must do it again and again.
- And again!

484
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:30,811
I promise you,
I intend to be a nuisance.

485
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:56,211
When did you decide
you wouldn't marry?

486
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,923
Just before my 20th birthday.

487
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:02,634
Mother came to my room and
announced that Lionel Stokely

488
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,930
was to marry Gwendolyn Alcott and
they were to live at Stokely Court,

489
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:08,849
which Lionel had just
inherited from the earl.

490
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:13,354
And I knew right then that
she would bring me no more suitors

491
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,355
and that I would never marry.

492
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:17,901
And that shocked me.

493
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,320
But I felt relieved.

494
00:33:22,238 --> 00:33:23,906
And that shocked me.

495
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,037
So I went into the garden and filled
an entire notebook with sketches.

496
00:33:29,578 --> 00:33:30,704
Men are bores.

497
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:32,707
They're useful for only
two things in life

498
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:35,417
financial support and procreation.

499
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:39,422
Millie!
You say outrageous things!

500
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,927
- Ah, but the price.
- What price?

501
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:49,723
Domestic enslavement.
Childbirth. Terrifying.

502
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:51,808
No, unmarried women have
a better life.

503
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,728
I swear it's true.

504
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:58,398
No houses, no babies, no husbands
demanding things all the time.

505
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:01,109
As long as one's lucky enough
in life to have a good friend.

506
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:04,029
I'm so glad Norman found you, Beatrix.

507
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:06,615
I was missing something
I didn't even know.

508
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:22,840
<i>Dear Miss Potter,</i>
<i>I enclose with great pleasure</i>

509
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:26,010
<i>the latest in what I hope</i>
<i>will be a long line of tales.</i>

510
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:28,221
<i>Yours affably, Norman Warne.</i>

511
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:29,722
Mr Warne.

512
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:32,891
Would you and Millie like to
come to a Christmas party?

513
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:34,601
My parents hold one every year,

514
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:38,021
and I think it's high time
that I invited someone.

515
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:42,235
Yes, we'd be delighted to attend.
Thrilled, in fact.

516
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,918
Be still, little imps!

517
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:01,128
Peter, you naughty boy!

518
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:03,422
Look what an example you're setting.

519
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:10,429
That's better. Any more of that
and I'll paint you out.

520
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:14,309
Your father is home.

521
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:22,150
How was your day at the club, Father?

522
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:24,735
Interesting, as always.

523
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,739
Rupert, we seem to have a situation.
We need your resolution.

524
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:30,909
I want to invite Norman Warne and
his sister to our Christmas party.

525
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:33,619
With Lady Armitage?
With Sir Nigel and Sybil?

526
00:35:33,744 --> 00:35:36,789
A tradesman, Rupert!
How will anyone have fun?

527
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:39,918
He's the gentleman
who publishes my books, Father.

528
00:35:42,461 --> 00:35:45,340
- Rupert.
- I have something here, Beatrix.

529
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:51,221
I went into Hatchards bookshop and
I purchased this with good money.

530
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:54,641
Hugh Whitteford bearded me in
the club and rattled on for hours.

531
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,809
You know old Hugh, jowls all aflutter.

532
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:58,353
Wife's bought three of
your girls' books

533
00:35:58,478 --> 00:35:59,728
for her granddaughter's nursery.

534
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,940
Sending more by ship
to chums in Bombay.

535
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:04,692
Very soon, the whole club was
telling me of some purchase

536
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:07,820
that they had made of
our daughter's creation.

537
00:36:07,945 --> 00:36:09,697
So I thought it was time
that I bought one.

538
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:13,201
So I went straight into Hatchards,
put my shilling onto the counter.

539
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:14,327
I would have given you one.

540
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:18,039
But I wanted to buy one
like everyone else.

541
00:36:18,748 --> 00:36:21,251
Now, I owe you an apology, Beatrix.

542
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:25,128
When you showed me your books,
all I saw was my little girl

543
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:28,423
bringing me clever drawings
for me to comment on.

544
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:33,221
You're not a little girl anymore.
You're an artist.

545
00:36:33,387 --> 00:36:35,056
The genuine article.

546
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:39,309
I would have been proud to use
that word about myself,

547
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:42,021
and now, I'm proud of you, Beatrix.

548
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:43,523
Thank you, Father.

549
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:47,735
So I don't see any reason why
we cannot make a little social effort

550
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,407
to welcome the gentleman responsible
for this blessing into our home.

551
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:54,032
Thank you, Father.

552
00:36:56,077 --> 00:36:57,244
Thank you.

553
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:01,039
I think it will be good
for all of us.

554
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,547
Merry Christmas, Rupert.

555
00:37:14,344 --> 00:37:17,306
Glenys, don't serve Sir Nigel
the punch with brandy

556
00:37:17,472 --> 00:37:19,016
- unless he demands it.
- Yes, madam.

557
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:21,436
And after dinner, he'll take port.

558
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:24,938
Come and give me a little signal
after he's had four glasses.

559
00:37:26,148 --> 00:37:29,735
The house shimmers, my darling.
You've done it again.

560
00:37:31,987 --> 00:37:33,739
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

561
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:37,911
- Mr Warne, Millie,
- how wonderful!

562
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:39,244
Thank you, Jane.

563
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:41,623
Thank you. Thank you.

564
00:37:46,335 --> 00:37:49,338
Mother, Father,
I would like you to meet

565
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:53,009
Miss Amelia and Mr Norman Warne.

566
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:56,304
How charming of you
to be so punctual!

567
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:18,617
Go on, one wouldn't hurt.

568
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:23,831
I think Wiggin is under strict
orders never to leave our side.

569
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:25,500
How festive!

570
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,530
Such scintillating conversation.

571
00:38:56,655 --> 00:39:00,326
Oh, mine as well! The weather
in Amsterdam in July.

572
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:03,496
Could I interest you ladies
in an after dinner coffee?

573
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:06,206
Some of the gentlemen would like
to play a few hands of cards,

574
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:07,833
but they're short of a fourth.

575
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,710
I don't suppose you play whist,
Mr Warne?

576
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:12,045
I'm afraid I've never had
much aptitude for cards.

577
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,840
- Oh, that is a pity.
- I play.

578
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:16,842
This is to play with Sir Nigel,
Miss Warne.

579
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,927
Sir Nigel takes his whist
very seriously.

580
00:39:19,094 --> 00:39:21,054
I play rather well, actually.

581
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:22,724
Do you, Millie?

582
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:27,228
Well, I'm sure you two have
plenty to talk about without me,

583
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:29,396
and if they can't play
without a fourth...

584
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:32,233
Come along, Miss Warne.

585
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:37,030
Carols in the music room, my dears.

586
00:39:39,364 --> 00:39:42,327
Perhaps I could show you
your Christmas present.

587
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:43,452
Yes.

588
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:45,246
It's upstairs.

589
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:46,831
I will bring the coffee.

590
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,434
- Mrs Wiggin.
- Miss.

591
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,603
Miss Wiggin. I have taken
the liberty of adding

592
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:11,021
a splash of brandy to our coffees.

593
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:12,731
Well, it is Christmas.

594
00:40:14,483 --> 00:40:16,735
Is this where you paint, Miss Potter?

595
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,032
Yes, and it's where we shall
find your Christmas present.

596
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:26,329
Oh, my!

597
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:29,331
I think, other than Bertram and Father,
you are the first man ever

598
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:30,333
to set foot in this room.

599
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,126
- Would you like me to leave?
- No, no, no. Wiggin is here.

600
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:36,213
And if this is the best I can do
for scandal at my age,

601
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:39,425
I'm hardly worthy of my reputation
for creativity.

602
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,635
Here.

603
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:45,639
My, but it's beautiful!

604
00:40:46,682 --> 00:40:48,016
Is it the new story?

605
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,811
Miss Potter, is it the new story?

606
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:53,146
- Is it?
- I'm not going to tell you.

607
00:40:54,273 --> 00:40:55,440
Come over here.

608
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:58,318
That's Jemima Puddle-Duck.

609
00:40:58,485 --> 00:41:03,032
It's the first drawing I ever did
of Jemima. I was eight, I think.

610
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,826
Jemima, stop that!

611
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:07,494
Stop what?

612
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:09,121
Just some silliness.

613
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,503
- And what's this?
- Oh, it's a music box.

614
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,130
My father gave it to me
for my sixth birthday.

615
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:19,632
He did the painting himself.

616
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:21,425
So your father is an artist too?

617
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,429
No. He always wanted to be an artist,
but the family disapproved.

618
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:26,222
So, he took up law.

619
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:30,226
The joke is I've never once
heard him discuss a case.

620
00:41:30,393 --> 00:41:33,938
He goes to his club every day,
and never his office.

621
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:35,856
So, I don't really know
what he does.

622
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:40,612
- Oh, dear.
- Wiggin is fallible.

623
00:41:40,737 --> 00:41:44,615
I'm afraid, Miss Potter, your
reputation is now officially dented.

624
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:48,827
'Let me teach you how to dance'.
Do you dance, Miss Potter?

625
00:41:48,952 --> 00:41:51,206
No. Well, not well.

626
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:52,916
I make a terrible hash of it too
when I try,

627
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:54,541
but the words are very sweet.

628
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:57,628
You know the words?
Will you sing the words?

629
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,423
Well, er...

630
00:42:02,175 --> 00:42:05,637
<i>@ Let me teach you how to dance</i>

631
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:10,682
<i>@ Let me lead you to the floor</i>

632
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,396
<i>@ Simply place your hand in mine</i>

633
00:42:15,938 --> 00:42:20,527
<i>@ And then think of nothing more.</i>

634
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:25,197
<i>@ Let the music cast its spell</i>

635
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:30,244
<i>@ Give the atmosphere a chance.</i>

636
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:35,041
<i>@ Simply follow where I lead</i>

637
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:40,420
<i>@ Let me teach you how to dance.</i>

638
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,427
Miss Potter.

639
00:42:48,054 --> 00:42:50,306
I know you have decided not to marry.

640
00:42:51,056 --> 00:42:52,934
All my life, I thought that
I would not marry either

641
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:55,728
but something has happened that
has caused me to change my mind.

642
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,730
No, please, let me go on,
for if I do not say

643
00:42:57,856 --> 00:43:00,023
what I have to say it now,
I fear I never will.

644
00:43:01,775 --> 00:43:05,530
Miss Potter,
I would like you to consider...

645
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:06,530
Mr Warne.

646
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:10,242
Doing me the honour, and I do not
expect an immediate answer.

647
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,536
Beatrix?

648
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:16,123
I was just showing Mr Warne
his Christmas present.

649
00:43:18,168 --> 00:43:20,628
I'm an impeccably genteel,
unmarried lady, Mother.

650
00:43:20,753 --> 00:43:23,005
I haven't begun to invite
men to my room.

651
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:24,298
Mr Warne?

652
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:37,436
Wiggin!

653
00:43:49,574 --> 00:43:51,701
What is the picture, Beatrix?

654
00:43:55,454 --> 00:43:59,000
I've written and drawn
little children's books,

655
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,001
which have been published.

656
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:05,923
The man who published them is here.
Mr Norman Warne.

657
00:44:06,048 --> 00:44:10,219
To thank him for his assistance
and generosity...

658
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:13,014
Well... I'm...

659
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:15,432
I'm writing him a Christmas story.

660
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:19,646
- Can we hear it?
- It isn't finished, so...

661
00:44:19,771 --> 00:44:21,146
Oh, go on.

662
00:44:23,398 --> 00:44:26,110
I suppose, before we part
for the evening,

663
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:33,034
I could share a glimpse of
the unfinished tale of

664
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,411
'The Rabbits' Christmas Party'.

665
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:44,920
One particularly snowy Christmas Eve,
a young rabbit and

666
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:50,342
his fearsome older brothers
and fiercely brave sister

667
00:44:50,467 --> 00:44:54,012
set out on a journey they make
every year to celebrate

668
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:55,849
with their friends.

669
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:59,101
Now, rabbits are highly sociable
creatures, and legend has it that

670
00:44:59,268 --> 00:45:01,813
wherever they find themselves
on Christmas Eve,

671
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:05,817
they get together and
throw a jolly party!

672
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:10,612
Now, I know such a legend exists
because I made it up.

673
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:16,244
The rabbits travel through
the woods to the well-appointed

674
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:21,916
burrow of their cousins where
a warm fire is waiting for them.

675
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:27,838
They take off their frosty coats
and the party begins!

676
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:30,925
Now, I know on this night
that they will eat and talk

677
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:36,014
and dance and laugh and
roast apples on the fire!

678
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:40,518
But I'm not certain
how the story ends,

679
00:45:40,643 --> 00:45:44,606
because I haven't made
that part up yet.

680
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:49,943
But, in any case, Mr Warne will
have to read it first,

681
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:52,947
as he is my strict censor,

682
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:55,617
and, well, it is his present.

683
00:45:55,782 --> 00:45:57,534
Merry Christmas, Mr Warne.

684
00:45:58,494 --> 00:46:00,621
Thank you, Miss Potter.
It's so beautiful.

685
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:05,793
There'll be no problem with presents
for the grandchildren next year,

686
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,130
- I dare say.
- You must be very proud, Helen.

687
00:46:09,255 --> 00:46:11,798
It's just a children's story.

688
00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:14,510
Outstanding!

689
00:46:14,677 --> 00:46:17,222
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course.

690
00:46:22,768 --> 00:46:24,436
What is it?
Is there something wrong?

691
00:46:24,561 --> 00:46:27,106
No. As my confidante.

692
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:30,943
You have something to confide?
How delicious!

693
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:35,532
Your brother has asked me
to marry him,

694
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:40,619
and I feel, quite irrationally,
that I may say, 'yes'.

695
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:44,331
I'd like your approval.

696
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:48,210
My approval?

697
00:46:49,753 --> 00:46:53,298
Beatrix, don't be a fool.

698
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,717
Marry him.

699
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,639
Tomorrow. Don't waste a moment.
How could you hesitate?

700
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:02,141
You're not upset?

701
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:03,934
Well, why would I be upset?

702
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:08,731
Well, both Norman and I.
You'll be alone.

703
00:47:08,898 --> 00:47:12,318
You have a chance for happiness,
and you're worrying about me?

704
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:15,112
I wouldn't worry about you if,
if someone came along

705
00:47:15,237 --> 00:47:18,532
who loved me and whom I loved,
I would trample my mother.

706
00:47:19,742 --> 00:47:21,744
- Do you love Norman?
- Yes.

707
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:26,416
Then marry him. Don't you dare
think about anyone else.

708
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,835
But what about all
the blessings of being alone?

709
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,918
Hogwash.

710
00:47:30,085 --> 00:47:32,422
What else is a woman on her own
supposed to say?

711
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:37,719
You have a chance to be loved.
Take it.

712
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,637
And leave me happy,

713
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:42,931
knowing that the two people
that I love are happy.

714
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:46,393
That is the most thought
you should ever have for me.

715
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:49,813
There you are, Beatrix!
The guests.

716
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:51,231
Yes, Mother.

717
00:47:52,442 --> 00:47:53,610
Millie...

718
00:47:58,155 --> 00:47:59,324
Go.

719
00:48:01,951 --> 00:48:04,036
What is going on tonight?

720
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:08,416
Why do I feel like a stranger
in my own home?

721
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:11,335
You have a clever daughter, Rupert.
You must be very proud.

722
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,547
- Of Beatrix? Yes, we are.
- To write and draw like that!

723
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:18,425
Beatrix should meet my niece, Anne.
She makes pots.

724
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,012
- Ceramics, Nigel.
- Look like pots to me.

725
00:48:23,764 --> 00:48:28,603
As for you, madam,
I suggest you take up knitting.

726
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:30,021
Merry Christmas.

727
00:48:35,777 --> 00:48:37,110
What was all that about?

728
00:48:37,277 --> 00:48:39,112
Sir Nigel disapproves of the way
I play whist.

729
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,740
I'm afraid I won two guineas from him.

730
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:43,034
Mr Warne!

731
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:47,746
- Your painting.
- Oh, yes. My Christmas present.

732
00:48:52,835 --> 00:48:54,003
Yes.

733
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:04,304
- Goodbye, Mr Warne.
- Goodbye, Mr Warne.

734
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:07,034
Sir?

735
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,038
I have an appointment to see
Mr Rupert Potter in the Eagleton Room.

736
00:50:10,163 --> 00:50:12,414
- He's expecting you, sir.
- Thank you.

737
00:50:25,594 --> 00:50:27,931
Come along, Norman,
it's only her father.

738
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:32,226
Come in.

739
00:50:40,943 --> 00:50:42,945
Thank you very much, Mr Potter,
for taking the time

740
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,614
out of your very busy day.

741
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,240
Goodbye, Mr Warne.

742
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:52,621
If you will not accept our advice
in this decision,

743
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:54,414
then we will have to impose
that advice.

744
00:50:54,581 --> 00:50:57,835
Respect our knowledge and
the worth of our opinions, Beatrix.

745
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,425
Oi! Get over there!

746
00:51:07,637 --> 00:51:10,014
I said that I'll do it and I will.

747
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:12,724
Norman Warne is a tradesman, Beatrix.
No Potter can marry into trade,

748
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:14,726
- and that's final.
- And what are we?

749
00:51:14,853 --> 00:51:17,313
Father's money comes from
Grandfather's printing works

750
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,440
in Lancashire.
A trade, Mother.

751
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:22,527
And if Grandfather hadn't
run for parliament,

752
00:51:22,652 --> 00:51:25,612
we'd still be living
in the shadow of his factories.

753
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,826
Your legacy came from Grandfather
Leech's cotton trade.

754
00:51:29,992 --> 00:51:32,244
When did we become
so high and mighty?

755
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:35,914
We're parvenus, Mother.
Social climbers.

756
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:39,293
Your father and I We will not
allow this marriage for your own good,

757
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,920
and there is no reason to
become insulting!

758
00:51:41,045 --> 00:51:43,590
It's not an insult!
It's the truth!

759
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:47,010
Our lives are pretension and
social aspiration.

760
00:51:47,177 --> 00:51:49,137
Sir this and Lady that!

761
00:51:49,262 --> 00:51:52,431
Norman Warne is a gentleman
of comfortable means,

762
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:57,811
and not one bit beneath us,
and I intend to marry him.

763
00:51:57,978 --> 00:52:01,148
Not if you expect to take
one penny of your inheritance!

764
00:52:01,273 --> 00:52:03,318
You haven't disinherited Bertram
for running off

765
00:52:03,483 --> 00:52:05,737
with a wine merchant's daughter.

766
00:52:05,862 --> 00:52:09,032
Happily, I am a published author.
I have means of my own.

767
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,992
This discussion is over.

768
00:52:24,255 --> 00:52:25,632
Come in, Father.

769
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:31,637
Why is it that after any difficult
situation, she always sends you?

770
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:33,431
Mama didn't send me.

771
00:52:35,057 --> 00:52:39,728
I don't like tension in my home.
I want to resolve this matter.

772
00:52:39,896 --> 00:52:42,356
Well, you can't.
I've made my decision.

773
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:45,902
Your mother wants what is
best for you, as do I, Beatrix.

774
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:48,195
An impulsive and inappropriate
marriage is something that

775
00:52:48,362 --> 00:52:50,114
you would ultimately regret.

776
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:52,534
You can't allow me to
marry and leave.

777
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:54,702
With Bertram moved away,
who would take care of you?

778
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:56,913
You surely do not think
we would deny you happiness

779
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:59,414
just simply because we needed
a nursemaid?

780
00:52:59,581 --> 00:53:00,416
That is a knife in my heart.

781
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,626
Well, then, what is it, Father,
because I cannot understand.

782
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:04,711
You cannot make us the villains,
Beatrix.

783
00:53:04,878 --> 00:53:08,632
Your mother trotted out countless
suitors all of them acceptable.

784
00:53:08,757 --> 00:53:11,427
- You rejected every one of them.
- I know that, Father.

785
00:53:11,594 --> 00:53:14,556
I didn't want to be a silly woman
marrying a man simply

786
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:18,809
because he was acceptable,
or rich enough to take care of me.

787
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:22,396
But does that mean that
I'm never to be loved?

788
00:53:24,148 --> 00:53:25,315
Father?

789
00:53:29,778 --> 00:53:32,407
Wiggin, wait here, please.

790
00:53:37,286 --> 00:53:41,541
I'd like to enquire about my
royalty earnings, Mr Copperthwaite.

791
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:48,922
And whether I might, at some stage,
afford a house of my own

792
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,592
in the country.

793
00:53:50,757 --> 00:53:55,221
You have enough to buy an estate.
Several estates, and a house in town.

794
00:53:55,346 --> 00:53:58,016
You're quite a wealthy woman,
Miss Potter.

795
00:53:59,474 --> 00:54:01,018
Am I truly?

796
00:54:01,143 --> 00:54:05,815
Yes, the income has become
quite regular.

797
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:09,610
If your fortune continues to grow,
you should have no financial worries

798
00:54:09,777 --> 00:54:11,737
for the rest of your life.

799
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:16,826
Extraordinary.

800
00:54:32,342 --> 00:54:33,510
Beatrix.

801
00:54:34,052 --> 00:54:36,304
Beatrix, come and sit with us,
please.

802
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:40,141
- I'd rather not, Father.
- We have something to discuss.

803
00:54:40,266 --> 00:54:40,934
A proposition.

804
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:44,603
And, for heaven's sake, Beatrix.
Let the servants carry your dishes.

805
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:51,360
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

806
00:54:51,485 --> 00:54:54,030
Nonsense. You always take tea.

807
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:57,242
Contrary to what you think and
what you have so vehemently

808
00:54:57,367 --> 00:55:01,411
expressed, your mama and I
want you to be happy.

809
00:55:01,538 --> 00:55:04,916
We simply doubt that
this marriage will do the trick.

810
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:08,001
Helen, please.
Sit down, Beatrix.

811
00:55:10,255 --> 00:55:12,715
What we don't want is for you
to rush into something

812
00:55:12,882 --> 00:55:15,217
which you may later wish
to reconsider.

813
00:55:15,385 --> 00:55:16,635
I won't want to reconsider.

814
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,514
- We are not convinced.
- Helen, please.

815
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:25,519
We are not convinced.
Yet, neither have we hearts of stone.

816
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:29,148
Therefore, this is what we propose.

817
00:55:30,483 --> 00:55:32,902
You may accept Mr. Warne,

818
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:37,407
but it must remain a complete
secret even from his own family.

819
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:40,117
Now, this summer, yourself,
Mama and I will go,

820
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:42,327
as always, to the Lake District.

821
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:47,500
If, at the end of the summer,
you still wish to proceed,

822
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:50,836
then we will announce
your engagement

823
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:54,840
and you can marry with
our blessing and our love.

824
00:55:57,177 --> 00:55:58,844
Why must no one know?

825
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:01,014
So there'll be no public
embarrassment when you change.

826
00:56:01,181 --> 00:56:05,018
- If, If you change your mind.
- Lf.

827
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:09,021
Now, Beatrix, if you care for
this man as much as you say you do,

828
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:12,900
then in a few months the ardour
will still be there.

829
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:19,032
If your mother, and I, are correct,
and this emotion cools with time,

830
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:24,204
then we will have protected you
against humiliation and unhappiness.

831
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:27,539
- It will not cool.
- Beatrix, listen to me.

832
00:56:27,664 --> 00:56:29,626
A woman at your age must
consider very carefully...

833
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:34,213
Mother, the only thing true
at my age is that at my age,

834
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,548
every day matters.

835
00:56:41,762 --> 00:56:46,601
Very well, Mother, Father,
I accept your terms.

836
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:49,938
Norman and I may decide to
wait in any case.

837
00:56:52,648 --> 00:56:54,108
But make plans.

838
00:56:54,275 --> 00:56:57,237
There will be a wedding
in this house by October.

839
00:57:59,173 --> 00:58:00,340
They're beautiful.

840
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:40,715
Which carriage, Rupert?

841
00:58:41,548 --> 00:58:42,717
Saunders?

842
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:48,431
Four carriages down.
This way.

843
00:58:59,275 --> 00:59:00,400
Well...

844
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,030
- This is the Potters' for Windermere.
- Right you are, sir.

845
00:59:06,865 --> 00:59:08,826
Here and those two.

846
00:59:12,956 --> 00:59:14,248
Beatrix!

847
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:24,092
Mr. Warne!

848
00:59:26,635 --> 00:59:28,221
Oh, I do apologise.

849
00:59:41,985 --> 00:59:44,320
- Miss Potter!
- Mr. Warne!

850
00:59:44,445 --> 00:59:46,822
I was beginning to fear
you wouldn't come.

851
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:47,614
You're soaked.

852
00:59:47,782 --> 00:59:49,032
It wasn't raining
when I left the office.

853
00:59:49,157 --> 00:59:51,244
I brought you the proof of
the new book for your trip.

854
00:59:51,369 --> 00:59:55,248
- Oh, you'll catch cold.
- I couldn't miss seeing you off.

855
00:59:55,373 --> 00:59:57,250
You know nothing would stop me.

856
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,418
This is going to be the longest
summer I've ever spent.

857
00:59:59,543 --> 01:00:02,005
- It's only the summer. That's all.
- Yes.

858
01:00:02,172 --> 01:00:04,632
And this time is not for us.
It's for your parents.

859
01:00:04,757 --> 01:00:07,427
How can they know what we're feeling?
They've never felt it.

860
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:09,721
We can afford them
this three months.

861
01:00:10,262 --> 01:00:11,722
I suppose.

862
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:15,309
This is not how I wish
to say goodbye to you.

863
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:37,289
Goodbye, Miss Potter.
I look forward to your speedy return.

864
01:00:37,456 --> 01:00:39,833
As do I, Mr. Warne.

865
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,835
Quickly. Here.

866
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,719
Goodbye, Miss Potter.

867
01:00:51,846 --> 01:00:53,639
Goodbye, Mr. Warne.

868
01:00:55,766 --> 01:00:58,143
Goodbye, Norman.

869
01:01:27,882 --> 01:01:30,217
<i>My dear, dear Norman,</i>

870
01:01:30,385 --> 01:01:33,929
<i>this absurd forced separation</i>
<i>is surely a kind of madness,</i>

871
01:01:34,097 --> 01:01:39,601
<i>most notably, that of my mother,</i>
<i>but you are here, my dear, for me.</i>

872
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:42,230
<i>The beauty of this place seems</i>
<i>magnified somehow,</i>

873
01:01:42,355 --> 01:01:44,231
<i>with you in my mind.</i>

874
01:01:44,356 --> 01:01:48,527
<i>In my occasional lonely moments,</i>
<i>I imagine conversations between us,</i>

875
01:01:48,652 --> 01:01:53,115
<i>and yesterday startled a duck with</i>
<i>my declaration of love for you.</i>

876
01:01:53,574 --> 01:01:56,119
<i>All of my thoughts are with you,</i>
<i>my darling.</i>

877
01:01:56,286 --> 01:01:59,539
<i>I know that you find Harold</i>
<i>and Fruing terribly boring,</i>

878
01:01:59,664 --> 01:02:01,623
<i>but, in fact, I'm having</i>
<i>what I could almost describe</i>

879
01:02:01,748 --> 01:02:03,918
<i>as wild enjoyment working</i>
<i>with them.</i>

880
01:02:04,085 --> 01:02:06,045
<i>You may wake up, one day,</i>
<i>to find yourself married</i>

881
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,630
<i>to a businessman.</i>

882
01:02:08,172 --> 01:02:11,717
<i>Praise the day when I can wake up</i>
<i>to find you beside me.</i>

883
01:02:13,927 --> 01:02:16,514
<i>I took one of the boats out</i>
<i>onto the lake at sunset</i>

884
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:19,224
<i>to watch the water hens feeding.</i>

885
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:21,811
<i>They made noises like kissing.</i>

886
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:24,438
<i>I closed my eyes and pictured you.</i>

887
01:02:24,563 --> 01:02:26,940
<i>I find I love my heart more now,</i>

888
01:02:27,065 --> 01:02:29,735
<i>because that is where I know</i>
<i>I can find you.</i>

889
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,405
<i>Amelia sends her fond love and</i>
<i>wishes for us all</i>

890
01:02:32,572 --> 01:02:33,822
<i>to be together again,</i>

891
01:02:33,947 --> 01:02:36,951
<i>as do I, multiplied a hundredfold.</i>

892
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:46,628
Sir... Hill Top Farm.

893
01:02:46,753 --> 01:02:49,213
May I ask,
is it a working farm?

894
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:55,302
Aye. Another great one falls,
but this one breaks your heart.

895
01:02:55,469 --> 01:02:57,222
Really? Why?

896
01:02:58,764 --> 01:02:59,932
Now, miss, a body would have to

897
01:03:00,057 --> 01:03:03,101
be a poet, which I certainly am not.

898
01:03:05,063 --> 01:03:07,606
Excuse me, but I'd swear you
were someone I once knew.

899
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:09,650
Good heavens, Willie Heelis!

900
01:03:09,775 --> 01:03:10,818
Miss Beatrix! Miss Potter!

901
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:13,153
- Is that you?
- How good to see you!

902
01:03:13,278 --> 01:03:14,947
Well, hello!

903
01:03:15,364 --> 01:03:17,824
I see you've given up on the law.

904
01:03:17,951 --> 01:03:19,994
Have you decided to make
an honest living?

905
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:23,331
Ah, yes, the law.
Well, not exactly. No, no.

906
01:03:23,456 --> 01:03:28,126
A country solicitor needs to
be proficient in many skills.

907
01:03:28,253 --> 01:03:31,213
And it suits me to be out of
the office now and again.

908
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:35,717
Now, I could show you Hill Top,
if you have the time.

909
01:03:37,554 --> 01:03:40,931
Yes. Yes.
Time is exactly what I have.

910
01:03:41,056 --> 01:03:42,224
Good.

911
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:56,114
- Not a bad outlook, Miss Potter.
- It's sublime.

912
01:03:57,865 --> 01:03:59,909
<i>By chance, I met an old friend</i>
<i>today who showed me</i>

913
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:02,411
<i>a beautiful farm that's for sale.</i>

914
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:05,706
<i>It would be a perfect country home,</i>
<i>and though I know we'll live</i>

915
01:04:05,873 --> 01:04:07,208
<i>mainly in the city</i>

916
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:10,545
<i>I'm very keen to share</i>
<i>my favourite places with you.</i>

917
01:04:24,934 --> 01:04:29,898
The post has arrived and, once again,
no letter from your Mr. Warne.

918
01:04:30,063 --> 01:04:33,108
Is it time for me to start getting
just a little hopeful?

919
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:36,403
He did mention he might take
a few days' holiday.

920
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:38,822
The post is no doubt slow
from wherever he's gone.

921
01:04:38,947 --> 01:04:40,115
Indeed.

922
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,619
But there is something that
appears to be from

923
01:04:43,744 --> 01:04:45,621
that interesting sister of his.

924
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:48,625
Millie? How delightful!

925
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:52,628
Excuse me.

926
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,239
Norman is ill.

927
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:52,230
- I'm Beatrix Potter.
- Please come in, miss.

928
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:57,527
- Ah, Miss Potter.
- Hello.

929
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:01,030
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

930
01:06:01,864 --> 01:06:05,492
- I came as soon as I heard.
- Yes. It's very kind of you.

931
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:07,411
Very, very kind indeed.

932
01:06:08,246 --> 01:06:09,414
How is he?

933
01:06:10,831 --> 01:06:12,000
Beatrix.

934
01:06:15,253 --> 01:06:16,420
Millie?

935
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:19,923
Millie?

936
01:06:27,347 --> 01:06:28,641
I'm too late.

937
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:40,612
He was so happy.

938
01:06:42,447 --> 01:06:44,407
He sang songs.

939
01:06:44,532 --> 01:06:47,034
He made me dance with him
in the parlour.

940
01:06:48,244 --> 01:06:51,331
He laughed all the time,
everyone noticed the change in him.

941
01:06:51,456 --> 01:06:53,123
Only I knew the reason.

942
01:06:54,958 --> 01:07:00,715
But all summer, he had a cough,
and then the cough got worse,

943
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:04,552
and in one night, he was gone.

944
01:07:04,677 --> 01:07:08,847
It was so sudden. I keep thinking
that it hasn't happened.

945
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:11,016
I keep expecting to see him
in the garden.

946
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:13,811
When's the funeral?

947
01:07:14,853 --> 01:07:16,105
It was yesterday.

948
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,400
It was only the immediate family,
and I...

949
01:07:20,568 --> 01:07:23,320
Well, I couldn't think of a reason
to ask them to delay it for you.

950
01:07:29,577 --> 01:07:33,248
It was considerate of you to come
and pay your respects, Miss Potter.

951
01:07:33,373 --> 01:07:36,751
Our mother is particularly moved,
and is sorry she isn't well enough

952
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:39,253
to come down to greet you.

953
01:07:39,378 --> 01:07:42,840
I'll be taking over our late brother's
business affairs, Miss Potter.

954
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:45,717
Fine.

955
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:48,721
I want to assure you that F Warne
and company will do everything

956
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:52,891
in its power to ensure that
our tragic loss causes you

957
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:55,103
the least possible inconvenience.

958
01:07:55,769 --> 01:07:59,940
Please accept the gratitude
of the entire family.

959
01:08:10,284 --> 01:08:13,621
- They want me to go.
- I'm sorry.

960
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,021
Miss Beatrix!
What are you doing in London?

961
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:41,524
- Is something wrong?
- A friend died.

962
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:43,025
I'm sorry, miss.

963
01:08:43,775 --> 01:08:45,528
Was she a close friend?

964
01:09:22,064 --> 01:09:23,524
Miss Beatrix?

965
01:09:25,734 --> 01:09:27,194
Miss Beatrix?

966
01:09:30,364 --> 01:09:33,618
I'll leave your dinner outside
the door, then, miss.

967
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:58,518
Saunders is here, Miss Potter,
to take you to the station.

968
01:09:59,351 --> 01:10:01,813
I shan't be going back to the Lakes.

969
01:10:01,938 --> 01:10:03,730
Can I get you anything, then?

970
01:10:05,358 --> 01:10:07,025
Nothing, Hilda.

971
01:10:08,235 --> 01:10:09,904
Very well, Miss Potter.

972
01:11:54,759 --> 01:11:56,511
Beatrix, it's Millie.

973
01:11:59,346 --> 01:12:02,809
Look, I know I'm unannounced,
but they sent back all my messages.

974
01:12:04,476 --> 01:12:06,645
Please, please, please, let me in.

975
01:12:30,252 --> 01:12:34,423
We've got to get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.

976
01:12:34,548 --> 01:12:37,135
Let's get you washed and dressed
and out of this room.

977
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,927
Go and find something to wear.

978
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,015
I can't.

979
01:12:47,353 --> 01:12:48,520
Millie!

980
01:12:49,564 --> 01:12:50,814
I can't!

981
01:13:05,747 --> 01:13:07,916
I've been torturing myself.

982
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,918
I should never have encouraged
you with Norman.

983
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:13,630
I'd have saved you all
this terrible grief.

984
01:13:15,088 --> 01:13:16,341
I loved him.

985
01:13:18,551 --> 01:13:20,011
I loved him too.

986
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:23,096
But he's gone.

987
01:13:30,063 --> 01:13:31,814
I must leave this house.

988
01:13:36,778 --> 01:13:38,529
I will leave this house.

989
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:00,926
Congratulations, Miss Potter.

990
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:03,846
You are now the proud owner
of Hill Top Farm.

991
01:14:04,055 --> 01:14:05,305
Thank you, George.

992
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:09,226
Well, I'm sure you'll be
very happy at Hill Top.

993
01:14:09,351 --> 01:14:11,020
I spent some time there
as a child.

994
01:14:11,145 --> 01:14:15,817
Is that so? I did have other
plans for it, but...

995
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:18,735
I'm sure that I will love it
in any case.

996
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:22,448
Yes. If you need any other
assistance or help...

997
01:14:22,573 --> 01:14:24,617
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

998
01:14:24,742 --> 01:14:26,118
Good day.

999
01:14:26,243 --> 01:14:27,494
Good day, Miss Potter.

1000
01:14:42,051 --> 01:14:45,345
What I don't understand, Beatrix,
is how you're going to pay

1001
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:46,430
for this farm.

1002
01:14:46,555 --> 01:14:49,225
I'm a writer, Mother.
People buy my work.

1003
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:51,226
Our daughter is famous, Helen.

1004
01:14:51,351 --> 01:14:53,645
You are the only person
who doesn't know it.

1005
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:02,613
What I don't understand is
why you find it necessary

1006
01:15:02,738 --> 01:15:04,323
to leave your home.

1007
01:15:04,448 --> 01:15:06,618
It is not a choice, Father.

1008
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:10,204
Beatrix, if I could undo anything...

1009
01:15:10,371 --> 01:15:12,039
There's nothing to undo.

1010
01:15:12,164 --> 01:15:15,042
This has nothing to do
with you or Mother.

1011
01:15:16,461 --> 01:15:18,505
I must make my own way.

1012
01:15:21,548 --> 01:15:23,051
So you must.

1013
01:15:24,469 --> 01:15:26,011
So you must.

1014
01:15:53,456 --> 01:15:54,748
Everybody out.

1015
01:15:56,876 --> 01:15:58,127
You see?

1016
01:15:58,252 --> 01:16:01,631
I told you we could not know
where ourjourney would lead.

1017
01:16:01,756 --> 01:16:03,341
It has led us here.

1018
01:16:04,341 --> 01:16:06,219
This is your new home.

1019
01:16:17,063 --> 01:16:18,523
No tears!

1020
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:12,345
Miss.

1021
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,849
Millie!

1022
01:18:19,143 --> 01:18:21,395
It's wonderful to see you!

1023
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:23,814
Oh, this place is perfect.

1024
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:25,108
Millie!

1025
01:18:26,734 --> 01:18:28,819
What have you brought?

1026
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:33,533
I thought it best not to
bring this, but then...

1027
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:36,118
itjumped into my hand
as I walked out the door.

1028
01:18:47,588 --> 01:18:48,715
I'm sorry.

1029
01:18:55,262 --> 01:18:56,389
Thank you.

1030
01:19:01,853 --> 01:19:03,395
It's getting easier.

1031
01:19:04,646 --> 01:19:06,440
- It's getting etasier for me too.
- Good

1032
01:19:08,775 --> 01:19:10,444
I'm painting again.

1033
01:19:10,944 --> 01:19:16,242
My mind's going mad with the story.
I've got pigs running amuck up there.

1034
01:19:18,869 --> 01:19:20,829
Well, it's this place, isn't it?

1035
01:19:21,581 --> 01:19:24,208
Who'd want to be cooped up in London
when they could be up here?

1036
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:27,212
- I'm so glad you came.
- Me too.

1037
01:19:28,546 --> 01:19:32,091
I've been so lucky with visitors.
First, my brother Bertram,

1038
01:19:32,257 --> 01:19:33,635
then my mother.

1039
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,637
You think that's lucky?
Your mother is a monster!

1040
01:19:37,055 --> 01:19:41,016
No, its fine. My mother and I have
come to an understanding.

1041
01:19:41,141 --> 01:19:44,604
We've agreed to not
understand each other.

1042
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:12,422
Look, if some city slicker wants to
offer me a half-decent price

1043
01:20:12,548 --> 01:20:17,427
for a derelict property and then
pay me and my lads good money

1044
01:20:17,554 --> 01:20:19,639
to knock the damn place down.

1045
01:20:20,556 --> 01:20:22,432
Let him build what he likes.

1046
01:20:22,559 --> 01:20:25,728
If we allow these city developers
to buy up our land,

1047
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,646
there'll be no more farming.

1048
01:20:27,771 --> 01:20:32,694
And all you're left with is
a ruined landscape and no community.

1049
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:38,408
Miss Potter!

1050
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,618
Ah, Mr Heelis.

1051
01:20:42,453 --> 01:20:44,413
I see you've found me.

1052
01:20:46,457 --> 01:20:51,337
I played here so often as a child.
I know your farm very well.

1053
01:20:52,462 --> 01:20:54,841
I swam in the stream,
played hide and seek in the woods

1054
01:20:54,966 --> 01:20:56,634
with Cousin Charles.

1055
01:20:57,676 --> 01:20:59,429
I brought you the executed deed
for the farm.

1056
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:02,556
At last.
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

1057
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:05,018
- Busy.
- Yes.

1058
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:10,189
Yes, I've asked Mr Canon to stay on
and run Hill Top as a working farm.

1059
01:21:10,355 --> 01:21:12,233
I'm learning a great deal.

1060
01:21:12,358 --> 01:21:15,110
I wish everyone who bought
land up here could be so...

1061
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:17,029
enlightened.

1062
01:21:17,738 --> 01:21:19,615
You've bought a farm,
you've kept the workers on,

1063
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:22,618
you're working the land and
you're preserving this place.

1064
01:21:23,368 --> 01:21:25,913
Yes. It makes me happy.

1065
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:31,211
Mr Cannon says the two farms
adjoining mine are for sale.

1066
01:21:31,377 --> 01:21:33,837
I'd hate to see the developers
get hold of them.

1067
01:21:33,962 --> 01:21:35,923
Do you know anything about them?

1068
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:41,011
- Morning, Mr Canon.
- Miss Potter.

1069
01:21:44,265 --> 01:21:45,725
My, they've grown!

1070
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:49,103
- Handsome lot, wouldn't you say?
- Yes.

1071
01:21:50,063 --> 01:21:51,605
Have you named them?

1072
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:53,733
We don't often give them names,
Miss Potter.

1073
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:56,402
Makes it a bit hard,
come slaughtering time.

1074
01:21:57,153 --> 01:21:58,529
Hello, Miss Potter!

1075
01:21:59,572 --> 01:22:04,618
Hello yourself, Mr Heelis.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

1076
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:07,121
I've come with a message.
Mr Hubbard is ill

1077
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:09,748
and will be unable to show you
the neighbouring farms today.

1078
01:22:09,873 --> 01:22:13,795
- Oh, dear. It's not serious, I hope?
- Chronic illness, I'm afraid.

1079
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:15,712
Recurs several times a month.

1080
01:22:15,838 --> 01:22:18,716
Usually after a night
at the Rose And Crown.

1081
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:20,717
I see.

1082
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:24,012
Mr Hubbard wondered if I might
show you the properties instead.

1083
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:28,434
I'd be pleased to have
so knowledgeable a guide.

1084
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:31,020
I'll just get my shawl.

1085
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:33,021
Well, it's prime land.

1086
01:22:33,146 --> 01:22:35,233
There's a lot of profit
in building houses on it.

1087
01:22:35,358 --> 01:22:37,944
But more value as
a working farm, surely?

1088
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:40,320
Spoken like a true
Lakes woman, Miss Potter.

1089
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,323
Indeed, Mr Heelis.

1090
01:22:42,489 --> 01:22:44,617
You do realise I've never
been to an auction.

1091
01:22:44,742 --> 01:22:45,909
It's simple enough.

1092
01:22:46,034 --> 01:22:48,997
Don't bid too early and
stick to your limit.

1093
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:51,498
I know my limit, Mr Heelis.

1094
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:54,418
Craven's Mill Farm,

1095
01:22:54,543 --> 01:22:58,213
40 acres of splendour.
Ł 1,100 anywhere?

1096
01:22:58,338 --> 01:23:00,216
Ł 1,100 I'm bid.

1097
01:23:00,341 --> 01:23:03,802
Ł 1,150?
Come along, gentlemen.

1098
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:06,639
Splendid little farm, this.
Lots of development potential.

1099
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:10,518
Ł 1,150.
Ł 1,200 anywhere?

1100
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,729
Ł 1,200.
Ł 1,300 anywhere?

1101
01:23:13,854 --> 01:23:16,440
Bidding, madam?
Ł 1,300.

1102
01:23:16,565 --> 01:23:18,902
Seated at Ł 1,300.

1103
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,112
Ł 1,400.

1104
01:23:21,237 --> 01:23:22,697
Ł 1,500.

1105
01:23:22,863 --> 01:23:24,615
Ł 1,600.

1106
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:27,034
Seven hundred.
Eight hundred.

1107
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:29,037
Ł 1,900.

1108
01:23:29,162 --> 01:23:33,917
At Ł 1,900.
Ł 2,000 at the back. Ł 2,000

1109
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:37,628
Any more at Ł 2,000.

1110
01:23:37,753 --> 01:23:39,546
Ł 2,300.

1111
01:23:39,671 --> 01:23:43,551
- Rich Bastard!
- Thank you, sir. Ł 2,300.

1112
01:23:43,676 --> 01:23:46,054
At Ł 2,300.

1113
01:23:46,179 --> 01:23:50,140
Any more, then, at Ł 2,300?

1114
01:23:50,265 --> 01:23:52,519
Ł 2,500.

1115
01:23:52,644 --> 01:23:54,311
The lady at Ł 2,500.

1116
01:23:54,436 --> 01:23:57,731
Against you, sir,
at Ł 2,500. Ł 2,800.

1117
01:23:57,856 --> 01:24:00,609
Miss Potter, you've bid more
than that farm is worth.

1118
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:07,199
Ł3,000, at Ł3,000 seated,
with the lady. Against you, sir.

1119
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:10,828
Are we all done at Ł3,000?

1120
01:24:10,953 --> 01:24:12,121
Going once,

1121
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:14,414
Going twice,

1122
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:16,708
Sold to the lady, Ł3,000.

1123
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:22,631
Sir, you should control your client.

1124
01:24:22,756 --> 01:24:25,510
She has allowed her emotions
to get the better of her.

1125
01:24:25,635 --> 01:24:26,010
Really?

1126
01:24:26,135 --> 01:24:29,430
She has squandered any possibility
of profit from that farm.

1127
01:24:29,555 --> 01:24:31,099
It was prime development land.

1128
01:24:31,265 --> 01:24:33,893
This place, this community
is an inspiration.

1129
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,604
It should be conserved for
future generations,

1130
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:38,898
and not destroyed.
It deserves protection.

1131
01:24:39,064 --> 01:24:40,817
Madam, your observations are
woefully inadequate...

1132
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:44,820
Please, sir. I am no longer
in the habit of being lectured to,

1133
01:24:44,945 --> 01:24:49,533
and, thankfully, I do not require
your approval or anyone else's.

1134
01:24:49,658 --> 01:24:53,453
So, if you'll excuse us?
Mr Heelis?

1135
01:25:01,962 --> 01:25:05,007
I hope you're not going to make
a habit of this, Miss Potter.

1136
01:25:05,132 --> 01:25:08,511
Do you know, Mr Heelis,
I think I might.

1137
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:12,097
Now, will you have time tomorrow
to show me those other farms?

1138
01:25:12,265 --> 01:25:14,934
- I certainly will.
- Excellent!

1139
01:25:26,863 --> 01:25:27,947
Come in.

1140
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:33,286
Oh, my!

1141
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:36,122
Goodness me!

1142
01:25:36,247 --> 01:25:37,707
I'll be just a moment.

1143
01:26:02,689 --> 01:26:07,194
Now then young man, how are you
taking to your new home?

1144
01:26:08,654 --> 01:26:10,405
I know it's not London,

1145
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:13,033
but Hill Top might suit
a young rabbit better.

1146
01:26:15,453 --> 01:26:17,204
He seems to be taking
to the place.

1147
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:19,832
As am I, Mr Heelis.

1148
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,627
- Now, the road.
- Oh, yes.

1149
01:26:22,752 --> 01:26:24,420
Yes, of course, Miss Potter.

1150
01:26:29,676 --> 01:26:31,135
How would you feel about
calling me William

1151
01:26:31,261 --> 01:26:35,222
instead of this infernal Mr Heelis?
I sound like an undertaker.

1152
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,516
Of course, William.

1153
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:41,895
And I believe Beatrix might be
perfectly appropriate as well.

1154
01:27:00,372 --> 01:27:05,043
<i>There's something delicious about</i>
<i>writing the first few words of a story.</i>

1155
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:08,213
<i>You can never quite tell</i>
<i>where they're take you.</i>

1156
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:15,012
<i>Mine took me here.</i>
<i>Where I belong.</i>
