00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,588
Michael Pollan: The way we eat
has changed more in the last 50 years

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,631
than in the previous 10,000.

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,553
But the image that's used
to sell the food,

5
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,474
it is still the imagery
of agrarian America.

6
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,318
You go into the supermarket
and you see pictures of farmers,

7
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,113
the picket fence, the silo,

8
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,324
the '30s farmhouse
and the green grass.

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,120
It's the spinning
of this pastoral fantasy.

10
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,006
The modern American
supermarket

11
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,009
has on average
47,000 products.

12
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,066
There are no seasons
in the American supermarket.

13
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,151
Now there are tomatoes
all year round,

14
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,071
grown halfway around the world,
picked when it was green,

15
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,698
and ripened
with ethylene gas.

16
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,037
Although it looks
like a tomato,

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,039
it's kind of
a notional tomato.

18
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,416
I mean, it's the idea
of a tomato.

19
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,481
In the meat aisle,
there are no bones anymore.

20
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,155
Eric Schlosser:
There is this deliberate veil,

21
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,282
this curtain,
that's dropped between us

22
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,784
and where our food
is coming from.

23
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,704
The industry doesn't want
you to know the truth

24
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,247
about what you're eating,

25
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,250
because if you knew,
you might not want to eat it.

26
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,505
Pollan: If you follow
the food chain back

27
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,883
from those shrink-wrapped
packages of meat,

28
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,218
you find a very
different reality.

29
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,137
The reality is a factory.

30
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,264
It's not a farm.
It's a factory.

31
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,266
That meat is
being processed

32
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,394
by huge multinational
corporations

33
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,439
that have very little to do
with ranches and farmers.

34
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:14,818
Schlosser: Now our food is coming
from enormous assembly lines

35
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,697
where the animals and the workers are
being abused.

36
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,492
And the food has become
much more dangerous

37
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,996
in ways that are being
deliberately hidden from us.

38
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,499
Troy Roush: You've got a small group
of multinational corporations

39
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,419
who control
the entire food system.

40
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,380
From seed
to the supermarket,

41
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,424
they're gaining
control of food.

42
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,054
Schlosser:
This isn't just about what we're eating.

43
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,681
This is about what
we're allowed to say,

44
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,808
what we're allowed
to know.

45
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,228
It's not just our health
that's at risk.

46
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,940
Carole Morison: The companies don't
want farmers talking.

47
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,318
They don't want
this story told.

48
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,674
How about a nice chicken club sandwich
made with fresh cooked chicken?

49
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,385
You know,
that's a nice idea,

50
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,387
but I think what
I'd really like

51
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,098
- is a burger.
- All right.

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,520
Schlosser's voice:
My favorite meal to this day

53
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,855
remains a hamburger
and french fries.

54
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,903
I had no idea that
a handful of companies

55
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,864
had changed what we eat
and how we make our food.

56
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,161
I've been eating
this food all my life

57
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,247
without having any idea
where it comes from,

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,292
any idea how powerful
this industry is.

59
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,335
And it was the idea

60
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,256
of this world deliberately
hidden from us.

61
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,258
I think that's one
of the reasons why

62
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,260
I became
an investigative reporter,

63
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,179
was to take the veil--
lift the veil away

64
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,975
from important subjects
that are being hidden.

65
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,979
(film projector clicking)

66
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,981
Schlosser:
The whole industrial food system

67
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,358
really began
with fast food.

68
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,652
In the 1930s,

69
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,404
a new form
of restaurant arose

70
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,448
and it was called
the drive-in.

71
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,329
The McDonald brothers had
a very successful drive-in,

72
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,541
but they decided
to cut costs and simplify.

73
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,793
So they fired
all their carhops,

74
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,129
they got rid of most
of the things on the menu

75
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,715
and they created
a revolutionary idea

76
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,633
to how to run
a restaurant.

77
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,178
They basically brought
the factory system

78
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,764
to the back
of the restaurant kitchen.

79
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,187
They trained each worker
to just do one thing

80
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,689
again and again
and again.

81
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,153
By having workers
who only had to do one thing,

82
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,322
they could pay them
a low wage

83
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,742
and it was very easy
to find someone to replace them.

84
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,662
It was inexpensive food,
it tasted good

85
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,957
and this McDonald's
fast food restaurant

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,502
was a huge
huge success.

87
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,716
That mentality
of uniformity,

88
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,718
conformity
and cheapness

89
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,179
applied widely
and on a large scale

90
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,140
has all kinds of
unintended consequences.

91
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,393
(mooing)

92
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,272
When McDonald's is
the largest purchaser

93
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,733
of ground beef
in the United States

94
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,735
and they want
their hamburgers

95
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,113
to taste, everywhere,
exactly the same,

96
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,032
they change how
ground beef is produced.

97
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,163
The McDonald's corporation

98
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,582
is the largest purchaser
of potatoes

99
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,502
and one of the largest
purchasers of pork,

100
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,256
chicken, tomatoes,
lettuce, even apples.

101
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,467
These big big
fast food chains

102
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,469
want big suppliers.

103
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,389
And now there are essentially
a handful of companies

104
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,224
controlling
our food system.

105
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,026
In the 1970s,
the top five beef-packers

106
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,988
controlled only
about 25% of the market.

107
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,866
Today, the top four

108
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,535
control more than 80%
of the market.

109
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,498
You see the same thing
happening now in pork.

110
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,211
Even if you don't eat
at a fast food restaurant,

111
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,590
you're now eating meat
that's being produced

112
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,259
by this system.

113
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,556
You look at the labels

114
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,391
and you see Farmer this,
Farmer that--

115
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,603
it's really just
three or four companies

116
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,439
that are controlling
the meat.

117
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,650
We've never had
food companies this big

118
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,195
and this powerful
in our history.

119
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,197
Tyson, for example,

120
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,909
is the biggest meat-packing company
in the history of the world.

121
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,621
The industry changed the entire way that
chicken are raised.

122
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,750
Birds are now raised
and slaughtered

123
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,336
in half the time
they were 50 years ago,

124
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,087
but now they're
twice as big.

125
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,632
People like to eat
white meat,

126
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,092
so they redesigned
the chicken

127
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,136
to have large breasts.

128
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,933
- (cheeping)
- They not only changed the chicken,

129
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,893
they changed the farmer.

130
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,147
Today, chicken farmers
no longer control their birds.

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,649
(thudding)

132
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,984
A company like Tyson

133
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,820
owns the birds from
the day they're dropped off

134
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,822
until the day that
they're slaughtered.

135
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,366
(buzzes)

136
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,660
Let me go to the top.

137
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,287
- Man: This is the Chicken--
- National Chicken Council.

138
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,290
The chicken industry
has really set a model

139
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,043
for the integration
of production, processing

140
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,628
and marketing
of the products

141
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,297
that other industries
are now following

142
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,342
because they see that we have achieved
tremendous economies.

143
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,182
In a way, we're not
producing chickens;

144
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,934
we're producing food.

145
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,812
It's all highly mechanized.

146
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,189
So all the birds
coming off those farms

147
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,567
have to be almost
exactly the same size.

148
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,990
What the system of intensive
production accomplishes

149
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,785
is to produce
a lot of food

150
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,162
on a small amount of land

151
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,748
at a very affordable price.

152
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,126
Now somebody explain to me
what's wrong with that.

153
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,022
(sniffs)
Smells like money to me.

154
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,400
(chuckles)

155
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,655
16 chicken houses
sit here.

156
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,701
And Chuck's son has
four over the top of this hill.

157
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,371
The chicken industry
came in here

158
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,499
and it's helped
this whole community out.

159
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,175
Here's my chicken
houses here.

160
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,888
I have about
300,000 chickens.

161
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,393
(barks)

162
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,520
- What do you want?
- (barks)

163
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,359
We have a contract
with Tyson.

164
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,820
They've been growing chickens
for many many years.

165
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,657
It's all a science.
They got it figured out.

166
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,077
If you can grow
a chicken in 49 days,

167
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,454
why would you want one you gotta grow
in three months?

168
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,832
More money
in your pocket.

169
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,378
(chickens clucking)

170
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,426
These chickens
never see sunlight.

171
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,721
They're pretty much
in the dark all the time.

172
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,827
Man: So you think they just
want to keep us out?

173
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,870
I don't know.

174
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,206
If I knew,
I'd tell you.

175
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,043
It would be nice if y'all could see
what we really do,

176
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,171
but as far
as y'all going in,

177
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,424
we can't let you
do that.

178
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,276
I understand why farmers
don't want to talk--

179
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,737
because the company can
do what it wants to do

180
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,865
as far as pay goes
since they control everything.

181
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,743
But it's just gotten
to the point

182
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,829
that it's not right
what's going on

183
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,831
and I've just
made up my mind.

184
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,458
I'm gonna say
what I have to say.

185
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,877
I understand why others
don't want to do it.

186
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,129
And I'm just to a point

187
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,756
that it doesn't
matter anymore.

188
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,091
Something has
to be said.

189
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,353
(loud clucking)

190
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,982
It is nasty in here.

191
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,401
There's dust
flying everywhere.

192
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,111
There's feces
everywhere.

193
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,572
This isn't farming.

194
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,449
This is just
mass production,

195
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,826
like an assembly line
in a factory.

196
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,454
(fans whirring)

197
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,456
When they grow
from a chick

198
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,292
and in seven weeks you've
got a five-and-a-half- pound chicken,

199
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,795
their bones
and their internal organs

200
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,797
can't keep up
with the rapid growth.

201
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,550
A lot of these chickens here,
they can take a few steps

202
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,637
and then they plop down.
It's because they can't

203
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,056
keep up all the weight
that they're carrying.

204
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,770
(wheezes)

205
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,596
That's normal.

206
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,561
There's antibiotics
that's put into the feed

207
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,896
and of course that passes
through the chicken.

208
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,108
The bacteria
builds up a resistance,

209
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,735
so antibiotics
aren't working anymore.

210
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,738
I have become allergic
to all antibiotics

211
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,448
and can't take 'em.

212
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,833
(clucking)

213
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,002
Morison:
When it's dark inside the houses,

214
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,213
the chickens lay down.
It's less resistance

215
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,007
when they're
being caught.

216
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,222
Traditionally, it's been
African-American men.

217
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,895
Now we're seeing more
and more Latino catchers--

218
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,356
undocumented workers.

219
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,359
From their point of view,
they don't have any rights

220
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,111
and they're just not
gonna complain.

221
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,822
The companies like
these kind of workers.

222
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,951
It doesn't matter
if the chickens get sick.

223
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,953
All of the chickens
will go to the plant

224
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,914
for processing.

225
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,728
The companies keep
the farmers under their thumb

226
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,939
because of the debt
that the farmers have.

227
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,567
To build one poultry house

228
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,322
is anywhere from $280,000
to $300,000 per house.

229
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,742
And once you make
your initial investment,

230
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,744
the companies
constantly come back

231
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,454
with demands
of upgrades

232
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,456
for new equipment,

233
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,458
and the grower
has no choice.

234
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,126
They have to do it

235
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,587
or you're threatened
with loss of a contract.

236
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,301
This is how they keep
the farmers under control.

237
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,762
It's how they keep them
spending money,

238
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,764
going to the bank
and borrowing more money.

239
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,058
The debt just
keeps building.

240
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,896
To have no say
in your business,

241
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,898
it's degrading.

242
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,151
It's like being
a slave to the company.

243
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,661
Pollan: The idea that you would
need to write a book

244
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,663
telling people
where their food came from

245
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,623
is just a sign of how far removed
we've become.

246
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,836
It seems to me that we're entitled
to know about our food--

247
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,881
"Who owns it?
How are they making it?

248
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,799
Can I have a look
in the kitchen?"

249
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,598
When I wanted to understand
the industrial food system,

250
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,476
what I set about doing
was very simple.

251
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,436
I wanted to trace
the source of my food.

252
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,440
When you go through
the supermarket,

253
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,611
what looks like this cornucopia
of variety and choice is not.

254
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,279
There is an illusion
of diversity.

255
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,364
There are only
a few companies involved

256
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,908
and there're
only a few crops involved.

257
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,037
What really
surprised me most

258
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,748
as I followed that food
back to its source,

259
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,917
I kept ending up
in the same place,

260
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,002
and that was
a cornfield in Iowa.

261
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,547
So much of our
industrial food

262
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,051
turns out to be clever
rearrangements of corn.

263
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,352
Corn has conquered the world
in a lot of ways.

264
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,189
It is a remarkable plant.

265
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,067
100 years ago,
a farmer in America

266
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,278
could grow maybe 20 bushels of corn
on an acre.

267
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,824
Today, 200 bushels
is no problem.

268
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,368
That's an astonishing
achievement

269
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,370
for which breeders
deserve credit,

270
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,872
for which fertilizer
makers deserve credit,

271
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,500
for which pesticide makers
all deserve credit.

272
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,633
Roush:
In the United States today,

273
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,761
30% of our land base
is being planted to corn.

274
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,766
That's largely driven
by government policy,

275
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,768
government policy that,
in effect,

276
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,272
allows us to produce corn
below the cost of production.

277
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,484
The truth of the matter is
we're paid to overproduce,

278
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,486
and it was caused by

279
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,655
these large
multinational interests.

280
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,950
The reason our government's
promoting corn--

281
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,996
the Cargills, the ADMs,
Tyson, Smithfield--

282
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,957
they have an interest in purchasing corn
below the cost of production.

283
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,796
They use that interest and that
extensive amount of money they have

284
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,341
to lobby Congress to give us the kind
of farm bills we now have.

285
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,760
Pollan:
A "farm bill,"

286
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,679
which should really be
called a "food bill,"

287
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,516
codifies the rules
of the entire food economy.

288
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,728
Farm policy is always focused
on these commodity crops

289
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,606
because you can
store them.

290
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,819
We encourage farmers to grow
as much corn as they can grow,

291
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,198
to get big,
to consolidate.

292
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,201
We subsidize farmers
by the bushel.

293
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,121
Roush:
We produced a lot of corn

294
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,165
and they came up
with uses for it.

295
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,338
Larry Johnson:
We are now engineering our foods.

296
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,340
We know where to turn to
for certain traits

297
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,217
like mouth feel and flavor.

298
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,344
And we bring all of these
pieces together

299
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,263
and engineer new foods

300
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,599
that don't stale
in the refrigerator,

301
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,018
don't develop rancidity.

302
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,647
Of course the biggest advance
in recent years

303
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,273
was high-fructose
corn syrup.

304
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,360
You know,
I would venture to guess

305
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,862
if you go and look
on the supermarket shelf,

306
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,864
I'll bet you 90% of them

307
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,867
would contain either
a corn or soybean ingredient,

308
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,370
and most of the time
will contain both.

309
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,555
Pollan:
Corn is the great raw material.

310
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,517
You get that big fat
kernel of starch

311
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,103
and you can break that down
and reassemble it.

312
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,105
You can make
high-fructose corn syrup.

313
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,731
You can make maltodextrin

314
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,567
and diglycerides
and xanthan gum

315
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,569
and ascorbic acid.

316
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,072
All those obscure ingredients
on the processed food--

317
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,242
it's remarkable how many of them can be
made from corn.

318
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,202
Plus, you can feed it
to animals.

319
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:32,623
Roush: Corn is the main component
in feed ingredients

320
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,794
whether it's chicken,
hogs, cattle-- you name it.

321
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,046
Pollan: Increasingly, we're feeding
the corn to the fish

322
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,757
whether we're eating the tilapia
or the farmed salmon.

323
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,801
We're teaching fish
how to eat corn.

324
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,433
The fact that we had
so much cheap corn

325
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,729
really allowed us to drive
down the price of meat.

326
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,815
I mean, the average American
is eating over 200 lbs

327
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,109
of meat per person
per year.

328
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,111
That wouldn't
be possible

329
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,155
had we not fed them
this diet of cheap grain.

330
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,329
Since you're selling corn
at below the price of production,

331
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,874
the feedlot operator
can buy corn

332
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,876
at a fraction
of what it costs to grow,

333
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,129
so that all the animals
are sucked off

334
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,173
of all the farms
in the Midwest.

335
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,386
There is a spiderweb

336
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,014
of roads
and train tracks

337
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,224
all around the country
moving corn

338
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,894
from where it's being grown
to these CAFOs.

339
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,487
Cows are not designed
by evolution to eat corn.

340
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,947
They're designed
by evolution to eat grass.

341
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,700
And the only reason
we feed them corn

342
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,327
is because corn is
really cheap

343
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,621
and corn makes them
fat quickly.

344
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,292
(cow moos)

345
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,175
Man:
Where are you putting your hand?

346
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,595
I'm actually
inside the rumen--

347
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,390
that first compartment
of the stomach.

348
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,227
And it's--

349
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,229
it's not--

350
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,147
it's kind of hard to see.

351
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,192
You can see
the liquid part here.

352
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,778
Man: Wow.

353
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,863
- Does that hurt the cow?
- No.

354
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,950
There's microorganisms--

355
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,244
bacteria in the rumen,
millions of 'em.

356
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,955
The animals evolved

357
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,457
on consuming grass.

358
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,459
There's some research
that indicates

359
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,712
that a high-corn diet
results in

360
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,591
E. coli that are
acid-resistant.

361
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,928
And these would be
the more harmful E. coli.

362
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,643
Pollan:
So you feed corn to cattle

363
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,730
and E. coli, which is a very
common bug, evolves,

364
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,067
a certain
mutation occurs

365
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,238
and a strain called
the "E. coli 0157:h7"

366
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,074
appears on
the world stage.

367
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,744
And it's a product of the diet
we're feeding cattle on feedlots

368
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,122
and it's a product
of feedlot life.

369
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,084
The animals
stand ankle deep

370
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,296
in their manure
all day long.

371
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,298
So if one cow has it,

372
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,883
the other cows
will get it.

373
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,595
When they get
to the slaughterhouse,

374
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,930
their hides are
caked with manure.

375
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,308
And if the slaughterhouse
is slaughtering

376
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,018
400 animals an hour,

377
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,687
how do you keep
that manure

378
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,647
from getting
onto those carcasses?

379
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,484
And that's how the manure
gets in the meat.

380
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,862
And now this thing
that wasn't in the world

381
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,489
is in the food system.

382
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,835
A fast-food nightmare
may be getting worse.

383
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,879
A two-year-old child died
today in Seattle.

384
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,216
And the killer? Tainted meat from
Jack In The Box hamburgers.

385
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,842
A nationwide recall today

386
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,470
for more than 140 tons
of ground beef.

387
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,805
Man:
A half a million pounds of ground beef--

388
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,059
Man #2: Today, nationwide recalls
of Con Agra ground beef.

389
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,145
Schlosser:
E. coli isn't just in ground beef now--

390
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,981
it's been found
in spinach, apple juice--

391
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:30,819
and this is really because of the runoff
from our factory farms.

392
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,489
90 confirmed cases
of E. coli poisoning.

393
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,824
Central to it all--
raw, bagged spinach.

394
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,661
Man #3: This is the 20th
E. coli outbreak with leafy greens

395
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,329
in just the last decade.

396
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,998
Schlosser: For years during
the Bush administration,

397
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,042
the chief of staff
at the USDA

398
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,503
was the former
chief lobbyist

399
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,547
to the beef industry
in Washington;

400
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,676
the head of the F.D.A. was
the former executive vice president

401
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,679
of the National
Food Processors Association.

402
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,597
These regulatory agencies

403
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,933
are being controlled
by the very companies

404
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,685
that they're supposed
to be scrutinizing.

405
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,354
Woman: ConAgra, which recently
recalled peanut butter

406
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,106
contaminated
with salmonella,

407
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,317
was aware of problems
in its plant two years ago.

408
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,330
Schlosser:
There's always been food poisoning.

409
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,958
As more and more
technology

410
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,002
is being applied
to the production of food,

411
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,004
you would think
it would be getting safer,

412
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,547
not more contaminated.

413
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,508
But the processing plants
have gotten bigger and bigger.

414
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,512
it's just perfect
for taking bad pathogens

415
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,806
and spreading them
far and wide.

416
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,684
Woman: The recall of frozen
hamburger now includes

417
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,394
22 million pounds.

418
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,938
Enough meat to make
a fast-food hamburger

419
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,609
for every adult in America
is being recalled.

420
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,611
Schlosser: In the 1970s,
there were literally thousands

421
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,113
of slaughterhouses
in the United States.

422
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,033
Today we have
13 slaughterhouses

423
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,202
that process
the majority of beef

424
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,413
that is sold
in the United States.

425
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,540
The hamburger of today,

426
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,419
it has pieces of thousands
of different cattle

427
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,713
ground up in that
one hamburger patty.

428
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:17,134
The odds increase exponentially
that one of those animals

429
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,803
was carrying
a dangerous pathogen.

430
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,349
It's remarkable
how toothless

431
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:27,227
our regulatory agencies are
when you look closely at it,

432
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,146
and that's how
the industry wants it.

433
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:42,117
Patricia Buck: This is the USDA
building up here.

434
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,579
Did Josh say how much time
he thought we'd get?

435
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,289
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes.

436
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,709
Well, maybe as much as 15.
Got to be on time for that meeting.

437
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,920
- It starts a 4:00.
- Okay.

438
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,798
So if I start
going like that

439
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,176
- or start shuffling papers, it's time.
- I know, it's time.

440
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,054
Thank you!
Thank you.

441
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,684
Kowalcyk:
I'm a registered Republican.

442
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,436
I've always been
fairly conservative.

443
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,272
I never thought
I would be doing this

444
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,274
and I certainly never
thought I would be

445
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,276
working so closely
with my mom.

446
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,404
- We go this way? Okay.
- Yes, we go this way.

447
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,073
Made a mistake--
I think that's the way we want to go.

448
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,826
Kowalcyk: My mom and I,
our relationship has

449
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,453
taken on
a whole new dimension.

450
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,872
2421? 2421.

451
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,666
Here we are.

452
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,549
- Hi.
- Hello.

453
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,634
- How are you?
- I'm Pat.

454
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,803
- Hi, Pat.
- Barb Kowalcyk.

455
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,223
- Hi, Barb.
- DeGette: After the first big push

456
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:50,102
to establish food standards,
people just got complacent.

457
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,397
We reduced funding
for the FDA.

458
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,649
We've relied increasingly

459
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,485
on self-policing for all
of these industries.

460
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,572
And now
we just have, really,

461
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:05,033
lost our system.

462
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,495
You're really one
of the champions on the hill

463
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,664
for food safety and it's a very
important cause.

464
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,501
It's very personal
to me and my family.

465
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,672
Our food safety advocacy
work started six years ago

466
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,508
when my two-and-
a-half-year-old son Kevin

467
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,596
was stricken
with E. coli 0157:h7

468
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,974
and went from being
a perfectly healthy

469
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,101
beautiful little boy--

470
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,437
and I have a small picture
with me today

471
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,315
that was taken two weeks
before he got sick.

472
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,068
He went from that
to being dead in 12 days.

473
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,909
In July 2001,

474
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,286
our family took
a vacation.

475
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,997
Had we known what was
in store for us,

476
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,916
we would have
never gone home.

477
00:29:56,252 --> 00:30:00,214
We ended up eating three hamburgers
before he got sick.

478
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:05,886
We started to see blood
in Kevin's diarrhea,

479
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,223
so we took him
to the emergency room.

480
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,600
And they said,
"We've gotten

481
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,603
the culture back
from Kevin's stool,

482
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,898
and he has
hemorrhagic E. coli."

483
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,569
They came in
and informed us

484
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,905
that Kevin's kidneys were
starting to fail.

485
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,618
Kevin received
his first dialysis treatment.

486
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,164
He was not allowed
to really drink water.

487
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,459
We had these
little sponges

488
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,671
and we were allowed to dip that
into a cup of water

489
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,923
and then give him that.

490
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:50,556
He bit the head off
of one of them.

491
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,475
You've never seen
someone beg.

492
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,187
He begged for water.
It was all he could talk about.

493
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,607
They wouldn't let anybody
bring any beverage into the room

494
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,735
because-- I mean, it was
all he would talk about,

495
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,822
was... water.

496
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,866
(waves lapping)

497
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,620
I don't know if he knew
what was happening to him...

498
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,208
and I hope--
I don't know.

499
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,754
To watch
this beautiful child go

500
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:26,049
from being perfectly healthy
to dead in 12 days--

501
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,302
it was just unbelievable

502
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:32,306
that this could happen
from eating food.

503
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,727
What was kind of adding
more insult to injury--

504
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,229
it took us almost
two or three years

505
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,981
and hiring
a private attorney

506
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,150
to actually find out that
we matched a meat recall.

507
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,653
On August 1st, my son was already
in the hospital.

508
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,115
They did an E. coli test
at the plant that was positive.

509
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,034
They didn't end up
recalling that meat

510
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,953
until August 27th,

511
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,497
16 days after he died.

512
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,542
If we have some more hearings--
which I'm sure we will--

513
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,669
I'd love to have
you come and testify.

514
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,714
- Keep fighting.
- Thank you. You too.

515
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,216
Kowalcyk: You never get over
the death of your child.

516
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,678
You find a new normal.

517
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,263
- Buck: This way?
- Yes.

518
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,474
- We're going this way?
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,267
Kowalcyk:
We put faith in our government

520
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,811
to protect us,

521
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,189
and we're not
being protected

522
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,066
at a most basic level.

523
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,365
In 1998, the USDA implemented
microbial testing

524
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:35,285
for salmonella
and E. coli 0157:h7.

525
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,209
The idea was that if a plant
repeatedly failed these tests,

526
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,961
that the USDA would
shut the plant down

527
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,297
because they obviously had an ongoing
contamination problem.

528
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,550
The meat
and poultry associations

529
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,844
immediately took
the USDA to court.

530
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,098
The courts
basically said

531
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,016
the USDA didn't have
the authority

532
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,060
to shut down the plants.

533
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,062
What it meant was that

534
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,315
you could have a pound
of meat or poultry products

535
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,777
that is a petri dish
of salmonella

536
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,780
and the USDA
really can't do anything about it.

537
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:18,286
A new law was introduced
in direct response

538
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,581
and this law became known
as Kevin's Law.

539
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,931
It seems like such a clear-cut,
common sense type thing.

540
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,933
- How are things going?
- Fine fine.

541
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,685
Kowalcyk:
We've been working for six years

542
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,770
and it still
hasn't passed.

543
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,189
I sense that
there may be

544
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,483
an opportunity--
an enhanced opportunity--

545
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,444
to get this signed
into law this time.

546
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,113
I think that from the standpoint
of the consumer,

547
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,407
a lot of people would
support the idea

548
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,452
of paying a little more
if they could be guaranteed

549
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,038
a higher standard
of safety.

550
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,248
- Kowalcyk: Yeah.
- But I also know

551
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,916
that there are
other players

552
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,794
- in the food production chain...
- Kowalcyk: We know.

553
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,255
...that tend
to worry about that,

554
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,008
because it's gonna be seen as an add-on
to their costs.

555
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,343
I think
the advantage here is--

556
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,471
Kowalcyk:
Sometimes it does feel like

557
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,640
industry was more protected
than my son.

558
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:24,770
That's what motivated me
to become an advocate.

559
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,189
In the past year alone,
there have been

560
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,191
a multitude of food-borne
illness outbreaks

561
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,651
which have resulted
in significant losses.

562
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,820
Clearly
our current approach

563
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,572
to food oversight
and protection

564
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,075
is not meeting the needs
of American families.

565
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,917
It's really hard for me
to tell Kevin's story.

566
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,922
But the only way
I'm going to be able

567
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,799
to prevent it from happening
to other people

568
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:57,677
is to go out there
and speak about it.

569
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,475
Yeah.

570
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,857
Six are elementary school students,
one is a sibling,

571
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,692
and there's another one
in another county

572
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,402
in Kentucky, so...

573
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,700
Kowalcyk:
It will be seven years

574
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,078
since my son died.

575
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,998
All I wanted
the company to do

576
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,959
was say "We're sorry.

577
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,044
We produced
this defective product

578
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,296
that killed your child,
and this is what

579
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,091
we're going to do to make sure
it doesn't happen again."

580
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,760
That's all we wanted,

581
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,971
and they couldn't
give us that.

582
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,525
Pollan: The industrial food system
is always looking

583
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,820
for greater efficiency,
but each new step in efficiency

584
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,072
leads to problems.

585
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,868
If you take feedlot cattle off
of their corn diet,

586
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,911
give them grass
for five days,

587
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,831
they will shed 80% of the E. coli
in their gut.

588
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,708
But of course that's not what
the industry does.

589
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,168
The industry's approach is--

590
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,587
when it has a systematic
problem like that--

591
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,673
is not to go back and see
what's wrong with the system,

592
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:20,135
it's to come up some high-tech fixes
that allow the system to survive.

593
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,730
Man:
The 5x5 product surge tank--

594
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,732
low level. Low level.

595
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,401
(man speaks
over radio)

596
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,236
Eldon Roth:
This is our operations center.

597
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,488
We control all
of our plants from here.

598
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,449
Where's Chicago?
Here's Chicago,

599
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,951
Georgia, Utah, Kansas,

600
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,371
Nebraska,
Texas, L.A., Ohio.

601
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,459
We control all levels
of the gearboxes,

602
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,127
the speed of motors--

603
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,213
we can change
those all from here.

604
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,348
We built something that--

605
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,183
from a food-safety
standpoint,

606
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,477
we think we're
ahead of everybody.

607
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,980
We think we can lessen
the incidents

608
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,358
of E. coli 0157:h7.

609
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,360
(beeps)

610
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,487
But I just started
working with ammonia

611
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,239
and ammonia hydroxide.

612
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,992
Ammonia kills bacteria,

613
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,162
so it became
a processing tool.

614
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,009
I'm really a mechanic.

615
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,886
That's really what I am.

616
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,514
We design
our own machinery.

617
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,904
(whirring)

618
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,498
Roth:
This is our finished product.

619
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,304
Man: Is your meat in most
of the hamburgers in the country?

620
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,306
Roth: 70%.

621
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,934
In five years,
we think we'll be in 100%.

622
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,936
We do have
some competitors.

623
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,230
I think
we're gonna beat them.

624
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,608
- (buzzes)
- Roth: Again, it's a marriage

625
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,569
of science
and technology.

626
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,612
(man speaking
over radio)

627
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,545
I want dollar meal--

628
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,174
- five rodeo cheeseburgers...
- Woman: Five rodeos. Okay.

629
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,426
...two chicken sandwich.

630
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,345
- Woman: Anything else?
- Man: Two small drinks,

631
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,597
and give me
a large Dr. Pepper.

632
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,724
- $11.48.
- Thank you.

633
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,768
First window.
Thank you.

634
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,441
Maria Gonzalez: We didn't
even think about healthy eating

635
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,526
because we used to think
everything was healthy.

636
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,737
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

637
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,989
- Have a nice day.
- You too. Thank you very much.

638
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,368
Maria:
Now that I know that the food is

639
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,370
really unhealthy for us,

640
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,539
I feel guilty
giving it to my kids.

641
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:40,251
But we don't have time to cook
because we leave at 6:00.

642
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,671
We don't get home
until 9:00, 10:00 at night.

643
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,758
When you have only
a dollar to spend

644
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,760
and you have
two kids to feed,

645
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,012
either you go
to the market

646
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,889
and try to find
something that's cheap

647
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,933
or just go straight
through a drive-thru

648
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,268
and get two small
hamburgers for them

649
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,229
and "Okay, here.
Eat them."

650
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,189
This is what's
gonna fill her up,

651
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,067
not that one single item
at the market.

652
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,699
Look at the broccoli.

653
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,660
It's too expensive, man.

654
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,958
- What do you want to eat then?
- Mama.

655
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,253
First check to see how many are there
for a pound.

656
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,301
- Uh, we're not getting it.
- Why not?

657
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,011
You'd only get
two or three.

658
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:35,056
- No. Come on.
- Aww!

659
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,231
Maria: We can find candy
that's cheaper.

660
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,191
We can find chips
that are cheaper.

661
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,110
The sodas are
really cheap.

662
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,237
Sometimes you look
at a vegetable and say

663
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,781
"Okay, we can get
two hamburgers over here

664
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,324
for the same amount
of price."

665
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,494
Pollan:
Why is it that you can buy

666
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,955
a double-cheeseburger
at McDonald's for 99¢,

667
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,916
and you can't even get
a head of broccoli for 99¢?

668
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,794
- You want the small one?
- We've skewed our food system

669
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,880
to the bad calories

670
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,674
and it's not
an accident.

671
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,303
I mean, the reasons that those calories
are cheaper is

672
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,972
because those are the ones
we're heavily subsidizing.

673
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,019
And this is directly tied
to the kind of agriculture

674
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,520
that we're practicing

675
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,647
and the kind
of farm policies we have.

676
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,941
All those
snack-food calories are

677
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,611
the ones that come
from the commodity crops--

678
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,446
from the wheat,
from the corn

679
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,156
and from the soybeans.

680
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,575
By making those calories
really cheap,

681
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,453
that's one of the reasons
that the biggest predictor

682
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,121
of obesity is
income level.

683
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,457
Over the course
of human history,

684
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,292
we were struggling
to make sure we had

685
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,461
enough food
and enough calories

686
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,838
for a sizable percentage
of the human race.

687
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,882
Now the problem is
too many calories.

688
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,510
The industry
blames obesity

689
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,637
on a crisis of personal
responsibility.

690
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,264
But when you're
engineering foods

691
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,975
you are pressing
our evolutionary buttons.

692
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,686
The fact is
we're hardwired

693
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,064
to go for three tastes--

694
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,816
salt, fat and sugar.

695
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,652
These things are
very rare in nature

696
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,571
Now sugar is
available 24/7

697
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,323
in tremendous quantities.

698
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,493
We're eating hundreds of pounds
of the stuff a year.

699
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,662
This diet
of high-fructose corn syrup

700
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,455
and refined carbohydrates

701
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,499
leads to these spikes
of insulin

702
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,627
and, gradually, a wearing down
of the system

703
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,963
by which our body
metabolizes sugar.

704
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,470
Maria:
My husband's diabetic.

705
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,597
One of my main concerns is

706
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,849
he could lose his sight.

707
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:46,271
He does get into--
sometimes he's shaking,

708
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,649
so I'm afraid that he's gonna start
not being able to drive,

709
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,818
'cause that's what
he does for a profession.

710
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,737
We have to consider
his medicine.

711
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,739
What is it, $70?

712
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,701
50 pills costs me
about $130.

713
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,452
Maria: But he's on two
different types of pills.

714
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,162
$100-and-something
for one pill

715
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,123
and then $100-
and-something for another.

716
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,166
That takes a lot
of our income away.

717
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,420
We're really tight
from either

718
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,547
paying for his medicine
to be healthy

719
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,217
or buying vegetables
to be healthy.

720
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,344
So which one
should we do?

721
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,641
It's hard to see my dad
suffer with diabetes

722
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,143
and stuff like that.

723
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,271
And it's really sad to see
that my sister might have it.

724
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,356
There's something
that's going on

725
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,483
in the way
that we live our lives,

726
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,569
where we play,
where we buy our food

727
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,487
and the types of food
that we're able to buy

728
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,990
that is causing
this epidemic.

729
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,700
It's not just
our community.

730
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,577
It's not just Baldwin Park.
It's everywhere.

731
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,829
How many of us
know one person

732
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,873
in our family
with diabetes?

733
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,002
How about two?

734
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,671
Three?
Keep your hand--

735
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,215
It used to be that
type 2 diabetes

736
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,092
only affected adults.

737
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,721
And now it's affecting children
at epidemic proportions.

738
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,391
(kids laughing)

739
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,115
(birds chirping)

740
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,877
(chickens clucking)

741
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,320
Joel Salatin:
Everything we've done

742
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,114
in modern industrial
agriculture

743
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,784
is to grow it faster,
fatter, bigger, cheaper.

744
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,621
Nobody's thinking
about E. coli,

745
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,916
type 2 diabetes
and the ecological health

746
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,085
of the whole system.

747
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,504
We're outsourcing

748
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,383
autonomous farmer
decision making--

749
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,510
we're outsourcing that
to corporate boardrooms

750
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,805
in big cities
1,000 miles away

751
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,849
where people make decisions
and don't live

752
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,268
with the consequences
of those decisions.

753
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,311
(cows mooing)

754
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,289
Everything is
grass based.

755
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:55,209
You know, they don't eat
corn, dead cows

756
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,379
or chicken manure like they feed
right here in the valley--

757
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,964
or dead chickens.

758
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:04,135
They actually eat
grass, forage--

759
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,262
you know, clover,
grass, herbs.

760
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,847
They're herbivores.

761
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,267
If they were eating corn,

762
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,270
you're gonna have to harvest that corn,
transport that corn,

763
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,982
then you're gonna have to haul
all that manure somewhere

764
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,568
that comes out
the back end.

765
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,529
Here... it's--

766
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,949
there-- there is
the whole thing.

767
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,702
I mean the cow is--
she's fertilizing.

768
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,788
She's mowing. We don't have to
spread any manure.

769
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,040
We don't have to harvest it--
she's harvesting it.

770
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:37,585
It's all real time--
real solar dollars.

771
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,422
The industrial food system

772
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,842
gradually became
so noisy, smelly,

773
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,178
not a person-friendly place,

774
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,639
that the people
who operate those plants

775
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,307
don't want anybody
to go there,

776
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,684
because then people would
see the ugly truth.

777
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,854
When that occurred,

778
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,315
then we lost
all the integrity

779
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,568
and all the accountability
in the food system.

780
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,030
If we put glass walls

781
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,200
on all the megaprocessing
facilities,

782
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,328
we would have a different food system
in this country.

783
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,871
(knife zinging)

784
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,835
- (clucking)
- (people chatting)

785
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,318
Salatin:
We have allowed ourselves

786
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,321
to become so disconnected
and ignorant

787
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:51,742
- about something that is as intimate...
- (whirring)

788
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,953
- ...as the food that we eat.
- (bubbling)

789
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,999
What a difference
this is to be out here

790
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,876
in the fresh air,
sunshine,

791
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,752
birds singing
in the trees, you know?

792
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,714
But you see,
according to the U.S.D.A,

793
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,173
this is unsanitary

794
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,134
because it's open
to the air.

795
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,594
They tried
to close us down.

796
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:12,013
One of the biggest
showdowns we had was

797
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,723
when they tried
to close us down

798
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,058
because this was
unsanitary.

799
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,894
Can you imagine?

800
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,480
So we had them cultured
at a local microbiology lab.

801
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,446
Ours averaged
133 C.F.U.

802
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,823
and the ones
from the store

803
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,117
averaged 3600.

804
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,871
Of course, those have been through
40 trillion baths.

805
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,498
Ours haven't seen
any chlorine.

806
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,461
A lot of people wonder
"Is this real?

807
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,630
I mean, can you really
feed the world?"

808
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:49,091
That whole thing is
such a specious argument

809
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:53,220
because, yes,

810
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,639
we're every bit
as efficient,

811
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,099
especially
if you plug in

812
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,019
all of the inefficiencies
of the industrial system.

813
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,898
I've had people come up
at farmer's markets

814
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,277
and say "What?
$3 a dozen for eggs?"

815
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,864
And they're drinking
a 75¢ can of soda.

816
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,372
Hey, pig.
Hey, piggles.

817
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,666
(snorting)

818
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,417
Hey, pigs.

819
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:29,674
I'm always struck by how successful
we have been

820
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,593
at hitting the bull's-eye
of the wrong target.

821
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,847
I mean we have learned--
for example,

822
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,226
in cattle we have
learned how to--

823
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:43,646
how to plant,

824
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,773
fertilize
and harvest corn

825
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,651
using global positioning
satellite technology,

826
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,029
and nobody sits back
and asks

827
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,865
"But should we be
feeding cows corn?"

828
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,869
We've become
a culture of technicians.

829
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,913
We're all into--

830
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,541
we're all
into the how of it

831
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,835
and nobody's
stepping back

832
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,753
and saying "But why?"

833
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,339
(laughs)

834
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,550
I mean, a culture
that just views a pig

835
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,219
as a pile of protoplasmic
inanimate structure

836
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,888
to be manipulated
by whatever creative design

837
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,850
that humans can foist
on that critter

838
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,102
will probably view

839
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,187
individuals
within its community

840
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,357
and other cultures in the community
of nations

841
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,609
with the same type
of disdain,

842
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,486
disrespect

843
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,905
and controlling-type
mentality.

844
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,594
(snorting)

845
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,975
Eduardo Peña:
The town where the plant is located

846
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,227
is a small town
called Tar Heel

847
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,606
in the middle of a very
economically-depressed area.

848
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,153
Smithfield has mastered

849
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,614
the art of picking
and choosing

850
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,116
a workforce
that they can exploit,

851
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,286
initially from
the local workforce--

852
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,873
the poor whites,
the poor black.

853
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,876
They went through
that workforce very quickly.

854
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,838
Now they have to
bus their workers

855
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:36,008
all the way from Dentsville,
South Carolina,

856
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,968
to Clinton,
North Carolina.

857
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:42,306
You have to draw a circle 100 miles
in diameter,

858
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,643
and that's where all of your workers
are coming from.

859
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:49,772
(people chatting)

860
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,820
Man: They have the same
mentality towards workers

861
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,321
as they do towards the hogs.

862
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,449
(squealing)

863
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:04,787
Man: You know, the hog, they don't
really have to worry about their comfort

864
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,914
because they're temporary.
They're gonna be killed.

865
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,460
And they have the same viewpoint
to the worker.

866
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,629
You're not worried about the longevity
of the worker

867
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,465
because, to them,
everything has an end.

868
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,475
- (clicks, whirring)
- (squealing)

869
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,406
Man: When you've got 2000 hogs
an hour going through

870
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,951
employees, because they're handling
these guts so much,

871
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,412
they get infections in
their fingernails and all.

872
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,247
All their fingernails
separate from their fingers.

873
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,543
Man #2: You're covered
with blood, feces, urine.

874
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,378
It's easy
to get hurt down there.

875
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,338
Man: You're doing
that same movement

876
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,007
for that same piece
of the hog

877
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,176
and it's nonstop,
you know.

878
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:03,220
Basically you're treated
as a human machine.

879
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,806
Man #3:
You get people that can't afford

880
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,892
to leave from out there,
and Smithfield knows this.

881
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,519
And that's what
they hold over you.

882
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,736
Schlosser:
100 years ago

883
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,863
when Upton Sinclair wrote
"The Jungle"

884
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,616
there was a beef trust
that wielded enormous power.

885
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,579
Immigrants from Eastern Europe
were being abused

886
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,832
in the absence of any kind of
government regulation

887
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,169
There were horrible
disfiguring injuries

888
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,837
and even deaths.

889
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,177
Pollan: Things got better.
They slowly got better.

890
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,097
Schlosser:
Teddy Roosevelt took on the beef trust.

891
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,769
Labor unions slowly organized
meatpacking workers

892
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,939
and turned it into one of the best
industrial jobs

893
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,649
in the United States.

894
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:01,111
By the 1950s
to be a meatpacking worker

895
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,364
was like being
an auto worker

896
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:07,493
who has a good wage,
good benefits, pension.

897
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,079
And then what happened?

898
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,373
Well, the meat-packing
companies got bigger

899
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,292
in order to serve the needs
of the fast-food industry,

900
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,461
which was
its biggest customer.

901
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,130
Some of the meat-packing
companies like IBP

902
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,716
borrowed the same sort
of labor practices

903
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,301
from the fast food
industry--

904
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,471
cutting wages, making sure there
were no unions,

905
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,139
speeding up production,

906
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,433
and having the worker
do the same task

907
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,644
again and again
and again.

908
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,938
And meat-packing is now

909
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,899
one of the most dangerous jobs
in the United States.

910
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,320
The meat-packing industry
also recruited

911
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,864
a new set of immigrants--
illegal immigrants

912
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,325
and recent immigrants
from Mexico.

913
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,330
Many of the illegal immigrants
coming to America

914
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,000
were corn farmers
in Mexico.

915
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:59,670
NAFTA led to a flooding
of the Mexican market

916
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,131
with cheap American corn.

917
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:06,677
It's put more than a million and a half
Mexican farmers out of work.

918
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,388
They couldn't compete with this
cheap corn coming from America.

919
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,348
(yelling)

920
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,768
Pollan: So what happens to those million
and a half Mexican farmers?

921
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,896
Schlosser:
Meat packers like IBP,

922
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,690
National Beef
and Monfort

923
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,526
began actively recruiting
in Mexico.

924
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,113
Companies advertised
on the radio

925
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,573
and in newspapers.

926
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,868
IBP set up
a bus service

927
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,038
in Mexico to bring workers
into the United States.

928
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,917
For years the government
turned a blind eye

929
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,419
to the recruitment
of immigrants

930
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,254
by the meat-packing industry.

931
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,882
But now, when there's
an anti-immigrant movement,

932
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,508
they're cracking down
all of a sudden,

933
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,761
but they're not cracking down
on these companies.

934
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,513
The government's cracking down
on the workers.

935
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,942
(clears throat)

936
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,119
Peña: Immigration agents are
arresting Smithfield workers

937
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,122
- at this trailer park.
- (people chatting)

938
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,957
Peña:
This is an agreement

939
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,251
between Smithfield
and Immigrations authorities.

940
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,921
They get rid
of 15 workers per day,

941
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,256
but you don't see
any massive raids.

942
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,759
That way it doesn't affect
the production line.

943
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,803
- (door closes)
- (engine starts)

944
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:41,313
- (Peña speaking Spanish)
- (car honking)

945
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,650
- Sir, we are trying--
- She asked me a question.

946
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,527
She is asking us
questions, not you.

947
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,865
I don't see anybody arresting
no Smithfield managers.

948
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,159
Nobody in the plant
that had anything to do

949
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,828
with the fact that
those workers were hired

950
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,287
is being arrested.

951
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,790
What we see today
is workers

952
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,834
who were producing for
this company and working hard--

953
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,877
those are the people
who get arrested.

954
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,716
(man yelling
in Spanish)

955
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,563
Peña: We want to pay
the cheapest price for our food.

956
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,190
We don't understand that
that comes at a price.

957
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:30,320
These workers, they've been
here for 10, 15 years

958
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:34,616
processing your bacon,
your holiday ham

959
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,703
and now they're getting picked up
like they're criminals.

960
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,121
(car starts)

961
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,249
And these companies are
making billions of dollars.

962
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,614
Salatin:
Is cheapness everything that there is?

963
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,241
Who wants to buy
the cheapest car?

964
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,744
We're willing
to subsidize

965
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,580
the food system
to create the "mystique"

966
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,540
of cheap food,

967
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,752
when actually
it's very expensive food

968
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,671
when you add up
the environmental costs

969
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,758
societal costs,
health costs.

970
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,429
The industrial food
is not honest food.

971
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,140
It's not priced honestly.
It's not produced honestly.

972
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,767
It's not processed honestly.

973
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,811
There's nothing honest
about that food.

974
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:50,234
I can't think of a better use
for a Smithfield box.

975
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,821
Man:
It was about a five-hour drive

976
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,949
maybe 300, 400 miles.

977
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,034
So yeah.

978
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,827
It's worth it.

979
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,833
Salatin: I have no desire
to scale up or get bigger.

980
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:11,004
My desire is to produce
the best food in the world

981
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,048
and heal.

982
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,509
And if in doing so

983
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:20,138
more people come to our corner
and want stuff,

984
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:23,475
then heaven help me figure out
how to meet the need

985
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,310
without compromising
the integrity.

986
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,853
That-- that's where I am.

987
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:30,732
I have
absolutely no desire

988
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,068
to be at Wal-Mart.

989
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:37,698
As soon as you grasp
for that growth,

990
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,367
you're gonna view
your customer differently,

991
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,160
you're gonna view
your product differently,

992
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,246
you're gonna view
your business differently.

993
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:48,250
You're gonna view everything that is
the most important--

994
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,085
you're gonna view
that differently.

995
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,129
(snorting)

996
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,551
(people chatting)

997
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,061
This is our new
organic line of popcorn.

998
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,980
This is Vitasoy soy milk,

999
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,732
the best soy milk
in the entire world.

1000
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,444
This entire show
when it first started

1001
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,446
was the size
of this column right here.

1002
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,780
Man:
Uh-huh.

1003
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,907
Several of us were sleeping
in our booths.

1004
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,576
We couldn't afford
hotel rooms.

1005
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,580
Organic's been growing
over 20% annually.

1006
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:30,542
It's one of the fastest-growing segments
in the food industry.

1007
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,044
My God! Ah!

1008
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,629
We're not gonna
get rid of capitalism.

1009
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,547
Certainly we're not
gonna get rid of it

1010
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,634
in the time that we need
to arrest global warming

1011
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,886
and reverse
the toxification

1012
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,929
of our air,
our food and our water.

1013
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,848
We need to be
much more urgent.

1014
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,393
If we attempt to make perfect
the enemy of the good

1015
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,145
and say we're only
going to buy food

1016
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,731
from the most-perfect system

1017
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,609
within 100 miles of us,
we're never gonna get there.

1018
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,699
As an environmentalist,
it was pretty clear to me

1019
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,868
that business was the source of all
the pollution,

1020
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,496
business was the source of basically
all the things

1021
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,706
that were
destroying this world.

1022
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:16,254
In college I came across
this little institute

1023
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,798
called New Alchemy
Institute,

1024
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,926
which was a group
of renegade biologists.

1025
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:22,928
My hope is
to give you--

1026
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,932
Hirshberg: We were preaching a kind
of a new religion,

1027
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:30,602
trying to develop food
and waste-treatment alternatives,

1028
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,688
but we were preaching
to the convinced.

1029
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:37,025
We were depending on sources of support
that were dried up

1030
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,111
and we weren't
reaching the audience

1031
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,405
that really needed
these messages.

1032
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:45,659
I realized we need
to not be David

1033
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,495
up against Goliath.
We need to be Goliath.

1034
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,541
(clacking)

1035
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:03,260
Hirshberg: When we started out,
we were a seven-cow farm.

1036
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:07,973
We wanted to prove that business
could be part of the solution

1037
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,933
to the globe's
environmental problems.

1038
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,893
At the same time
we had to prove

1039
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,812
that we could be
highly profitable.

1040
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,067
Today in 2008,
not only are

1041
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,778
we the #3 yogurt brand
in America,

1042
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,822
but we're among
the most profitable.

1043
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,585
See, this is
the interesting thing.

1044
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,545
A little company
like this is now Kraft,

1045
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,589
but you don't have
any idea that it's Kraft.

1046
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:43,675
This is now Pepsi.
That's now Kellogg's.

1047
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,094
- Man: Kashi is Kellogg's?
- Yeah.

1048
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,097
- This is Colgate now.
- Oh, is it?

1049
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,476
Yeah, this is one of those companies
that started like us.

1050
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,272
- Well, it's--
- Make them different?

1051
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,274
Make them successful,
basically.

1052
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:03,487
The jury is out.
I have to put it that way.

1053
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,365
Hirshberg: These large companies
don't grow organically.

1054
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,701
They grow by acquisition.

1055
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,329
Coke, Pepsi, Kellogg's,
General Mills--

1056
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,997
all of them are running,

1057
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,082
not walking, into the organic
food business.

1058
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,302
Hirshberg: For me, when a Wal-Mart
enters the organic space,

1059
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,888
I'm thrilled. It's absolutely one of
the most exciting things.

1060
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,015
I have dreamed
of the day

1061
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,017
when I could sit
with corporate titans

1062
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,186
and have conversations

1063
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,188
about organics
and sustainability.

1064
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,899
- This is Amanda. This is Rand.
- Hi Amanda. I'm Rand.

1065
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,109
- Rand, nice to meet you.
- Tony.

1066
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,694
- Tony. Great.
- Nice to meet you.

1067
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,988
Okay, help me
figure out where--

1068
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,407
- We both work for Wal-Mart.
- You're with Wal-Mart.

1069
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,575
Yup.

1070
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,118
Do you know that we don't go
to Wal-Mart?

1071
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,995
- We've never been.
- Rand: Oh yeah.

1072
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:56,873
- Isn't that amazing?
- So we had to come to you.

1073
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,792
Yeah, we've never been.

1074
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,502
We just started boycotting
a long time ago

1075
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,171
and we just kept
riding on that.

1076
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,882
Hirshberg:
Wal-Mart is terribly sensitive

1077
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,384
to their reputation.

1078
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,886
They've obviously
been vilified,

1079
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,013
probably more
than any retailer

1080
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,015
in our current economy.

1081
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,393
Actually, it's a pretty
easy decision

1082
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:19,938
to try to support things like organic,
or whatever it might be,

1083
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,357
based on what
the customer wants.

1084
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,401
We see that
and react to it.

1085
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,112
So if it's clear
the customer wants it,

1086
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,573
it's really easy
to get behind it,

1087
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,324
to push forward and try to make
that happen.

1088
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,537
Hirshberg: When I run into
my old environmental friends,

1089
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,248
many are
initially horrified

1090
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:42,168
by the kinds of company
that I'm keeping these days.

1091
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,921
But when I then
go on to explain

1092
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,924
what the impact of one purchase order
from Wal-Mart is,

1093
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,094
in terms of not pounds
but tons of pesticide,

1094
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,847
tons of herbicide,
tons of chemical fertilizer,

1095
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,058
the discussion--
we get away from the emotion

1096
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,102
and we get down
to the facts.

1097
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,314
This is really key, though,
what you guys are doing here.

1098
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,278
I have no illusions
about this.

1099
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,113
I don't believe that
Wal-Mart has come here

1100
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:13,158
because they've suddenly had
a moral enlightenment.

1101
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,785
It's because
of economics.

1102
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,747
I can debate with my radical friends
all day long,

1103
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,999
but nobody can
challenge the fact

1104
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,793
that a sale of another
million dollars to Wal-Mart

1105
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,587
helps to save
the world.

1106
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,598
Pollan: Back around the turn
of the last century,

1107
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,184
the average farmer could
feed six or eight people.

1108
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,813
Now the average
American farmer

1109
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,983
can feed
126 people, okay?

1110
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,986
These are the most productive humans
that have ever lived.

1111
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:54,074
The changes down
on the farm have been

1112
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,451
momentous and radical but invisible
to most of us,

1113
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,119
'cause who knows
a farmer anymore?

1114
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,872
But their way of life

1115
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,833
has been revolutionized.

1116
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,525
Roush:
10,000 years ago,

1117
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,235
farmers started saving
their best seeds

1118
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,404
and planted again
in the following year.

1119
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,656
That's how seeds
have been developed.

1120
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,282
That's how corn
was developed

1121
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,702
from a useless grass
for the most part

1122
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,371
to the extremely
productive plant it is today.

1123
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:45,291
Pollan: The idea that any corporation
could own a food crop

1124
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,461
is a very new idea.
It wasn't until the 1980s

1125
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,214
that the Supreme Court said
you could patent life.

1126
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,632
And that opened
the floodgates--

1127
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,385
efforts to patent the most valuable
parts of life,

1128
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,929
which is to say the crops
on which we depend.

1129
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,558
Roush:
Monsanto is a chemical company.

1130
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,645
They produced DDT,
Agent Orange in Vietnam,

1131
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,023
and then they developed
a product called "Roundup."

1132
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:14,154
We started hearing rumblings
about genetically-engineered soybeans

1133
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,906
that could resist
the application of Roundup.

1134
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,950
When the Roundup was
sprayed over top of it,

1135
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,368
it killed
every weed out there

1136
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,662
except for this
Roundup Ready soybean.

1137
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,973
Roush: I can remember
when the first prohibition

1138
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,184
against seed saving
came into being.

1139
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,394
Most farmers were just

1140
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:50,023
absolutely disgusted
with the whole concept.

1141
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,358
It's been interesting
over the course

1142
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,861
of 11 years
to watch us go

1143
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,863
from utter contempt
for the notion

1144
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,907
that we can't save
our own seed

1145
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,742
to acceptance.

1146
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,119
Man:
What happens if a farmer

1147
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,371
saves the seeds?

1148
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,999
(chuckles)

1149
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,376
Well, you know,
really there's

1150
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,378
only one company involved
in this now

1151
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,255
and that's Monsanto.

1152
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,302
Monsanto is...

1153
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,269
They've got a team
of private investigators

1154
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,146
that kind of roam
the country

1155
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,232
and they've got
a little 1-800 hotline

1156
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,693
they take calls on.
If they get a call

1157
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,154
and somebody alleges
that somebody saved seed,

1158
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:41,533
they'll send an investigator out
to look into the matter.

1159
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,872
If you save your own seed,
you're gonna get a call

1160
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,666
from somebody
from Monsanto.

1161
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,940
David Runyon:
Two men drove in my driveway

1162
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,567
at 7:00,
7:30 at night,

1163
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,235
presented
a black card to me

1164
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,405
and they never told me
that they were from Monsanto.

1165
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:23,825
Man: They said that they had
had a surveillance team,

1166
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,702
caught me
cleaning beans.

1167
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,455
Moe Parr:
I found it necessary to get up

1168
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,124
at 3:00 and 4:00
in the morning

1169
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:35,795
before the investigators are
on the road following me.

1170
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,547
Runyon:
They were--

1171
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,508
I'm gonna say maybe ex-military
or ex-police.

1172
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,303
They were large
and they were intimidating.

1173
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:46,556
Man: I don't know whether they had
their surveillance team

1174
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:50,143
or whether it was my neighbor that
turned me in. I don't know.

1175
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,145
Now as I turned to walk in the house,
one of them said--

1176
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,439
I could hear in the back--
"He's guilty."

1177
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:27,722
Runyon: It's a real ingenious device
designed back in the 1800s,

1178
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:31,392
and Monsanto's gonna
close all of them out.

1179
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,985
So how many seed cleaners
are out there

1180
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:42,445
in the country
do you think?

1181
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,156
In the state of Indiana,
there may be six.

1182
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,033
Maybe.
I'm not aware of--

1183
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:50,536
- How many there used to be?
- Oh my golly. Every county had three.

1184
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,372
Have they all been
put out of business?

1185
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,915
There's nobody left.

1186
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,884
Runyon: When Monsanto soybeans
first came on the market,

1187
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,970
I just never
really switched over.

1188
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,764
I was getting
pretty good yield

1189
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,349
with the conventional
soybeans I'd been using,

1190
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,102
so I thought "Well,
I'll just stay where I'm at."

1191
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,861
My neighbors
all around me are all GMOs.

1192
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:26,823
If the pollen goes in,
if the seed moves in,

1193
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:29,534
I am still held
accountable.

1194
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:40,044
Pollan: When you genetically
modify a crop, you own it.

1195
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:42,630
We've never had this
in agriculture.

1196
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,969
Roush: Used to be that your
land-grant universities,

1197
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,430
they developed what
was called public seed.

1198
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,016
The vast majority
of the plant breeding

1199
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,143
was actually done
in these public institutions

1200
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:58,062
Pollan:
Monsanto is very much like Microsoft.

1201
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,732
The same way Microsoft owns
the intellectual property

1202
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:03,109
behind most computers
in America,

1203
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,653
they set out to own
the intellectual property

1204
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:08,072
behind most of the food
in America.

1205
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:11,075
Roush: Public plant breeding is
a thing of the past.

1206
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:14,162
There virtually are
no public seeds anymore.

1207
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,167
Runyon:
There's only like four or five varieties

1208
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:20,918
that I can actually plant.

1209
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,754
Now I have some
of the last soybeans

1210
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:24,630
coming out
of the state of Illinois--

1211
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,633
- That are not GMO.
- Public variety. Public variety.

1212
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,721
When it comes to the point that I can't
buy any more certified seed,

1213
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,557
what do I do?
What are my options?

1214
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,688
I acquired this list
that was mailed to me.

1215
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:44,942
The black list here is Monsanto's
unauthorized growers list.

1216
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:46,152
Wow.

1217
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,654
Either farmers that have
judgments against them,

1218
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,032
or businesses,
or else it's--

1219
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,743
or it's farmers that have not submitted
their paperwork,

1220
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,703
will not turn over
their records.

1221
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,538
For my case,
that's why I'm on there--

1222
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,957
'cause I would not
turn over my records.

1223
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,794
- Am I on this list?
- Yes, you are.

1224
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,796
Wow.

1225
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:07,507
I see two of the farmers
that I work for on here.

1226
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,093
This list-- now it comes down
to the point

1227
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:12,804
where I cannot buy
Monsanto products, okay?

1228
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,180
Right.

1229
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,682
So it's coming down to
"What can I plant?"

1230
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:22,063
Parr: Monsanto is suing me
on the basis

1231
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:25,441
that I'm encouraging the farmer
to break the patent law

1232
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,652
by cleaning
their own seed.

1233
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:37,662
I haven't been
in a courtroom yet

1234
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:40,748
and my bill is
already $25,000.

1235
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,752
People that were
friends of mine

1236
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,255
now are reticent
to even talk with me.

1237
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,177
We've been friends
for 50 years,

1238
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,513
and now we can hardly be
seen together.

1239
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,848
Right.

1240
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:03,312
I don't think
I'm really guilty,

1241
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:06,190
but it was cheaper
to pay the fine

1242
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,526
than it was
to try to fight it.

1243
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,486
- It gnaws at you...
- Parr: Sure.

1244
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,030
...because if you think
you're right at something,

1245
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,241
but yet you admit
you're wrong.

1246
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,376
Roush: Monsanto falsely accused us
of violating their patent

1247
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:27,420
and breach of contract.

1248
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,547
None of it was true.

1249
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,884
You go into a market,
you find a dominant farmer

1250
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:36,137
and if you can ruin them, you scare
the rest of them to following the line.

1251
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,474
My family spent $400,000

1252
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:41,851
fighting the battle, pretrial.

1253
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,811
And we were told
it would take another million

1254
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,396
to take the thing to trial.

1255
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,900
We settled out of court.

1256
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:51,569
The way the system appeared
to work to me was

1257
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,696
Lady Justice had
the scales

1258
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,907
and you piled cash
on the scales

1259
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:58,826
and the one that piled
the most cash on the scales,

1260
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,370
hired the most experts
and was most willing

1261
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:04,373
to tell the biggest lies,
that was the winner.

1262
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,502
That seems to be how our justice system
functions now.

1263
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,086
It's terrible.
It's terrible.

1264
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:11,088
How can a farmer
defend himself against

1265
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:13,049
a multinational corporation
like Monsanto?

1266
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:17,011
I talked to a young man
just three days ago.

1267
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,055
They'd been
to his farm, you know?

1268
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:22,433
And this poor kid,
he's just starting out.

1269
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,852
His fiancée was there.
I talked to her

1270
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,938
and tried to give them
the best advice I could.

1271
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,856
Unfortunately the best advice
I could give them was

1272
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:33,444
"Try to get out of this thing
with your skin intact.

1273
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,821
Don't fight 'em.
You've got to roll over

1274
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,491
and give them what they want,
'cause you can't defend yourself."

1275
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,620
In the case of Monsanto,
their control is so dominant.

1276
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,957
If you want to be
in production agriculture,

1277
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:47,959
you're gonna be
in bed with Monsanto.

1278
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:51,128
They own the soybean.

1279
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:54,298
They are going to
control that product

1280
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,634
from seed
to the supermarket.

1281
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,844
They are, in effect,
gaining control of food.

1282
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,030
Pollan: There has been
this revolving door

1283
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,741
between Monsanto's
corporate offices

1284
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,743
and the various regulatory

1285
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:25,162
and judicial bodies that
have made the key decisions.

1286
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:29,458
Roush: Justice Clarence Thomas
was a Monsanto attorney.

1287
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:32,003
That wouldn't be
such a big deal

1288
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,671
if it weren't
for one court case

1289
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:36,424
that really decided
this whole seed-saving issue.

1290
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:39,510
Justice Clarence Thomas
wrote the majority opinion

1291
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:42,179
in a case that allowed
these companies

1292
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:45,224
to prevent farmers
from saving their own seed.

1293
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,019
Pollan:
Monsanto had very close ties

1294
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:49,854
to the Bush administration...

1295
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,191
and the Clinton administration.

1296
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:59,030
This goes to why we haven't had
much political debate

1297
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:01,866
over this radical change
to our food system.

1298
01:17:07,247 --> 01:17:09,665
Pollan: For the last 25 years,
our government

1299
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,543
has been dominated
by the industries

1300
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,712
that it was meant
to be regulating.

1301
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,927
Schlosser: The challenge is as soon
as you have people

1302
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,764
with expertise in industry, they may
turn out to be very good regulators.

1303
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,103
It's really about what interests
they decide to represent.

1304
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,696
You're talking about power--

1305
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,074
centralized power

1306
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:44,784
and that power
is being used

1307
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,620
against the people who are
really producing the food

1308
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,913
like the farmers.

1309
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:50,831
It's being used
against the workers

1310
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,416
who work
for these companies

1311
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:55,002
and it's being used
against consumers

1312
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,672
who are deliberately
being kept in the dark

1313
01:17:57,714 --> 01:18:00,591
about what they're eating,
where it comes from

1314
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,259
and what it's doing
to their bodies.

1315
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:04,679
(kids laughing)

1316
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:08,849
Woman: Good afternoon,
Madame Chair and members.

1317
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:12,937
SB-63 is a consumer
right-to-know measure.

1318
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:16,440
It simply requires that
all foods that are cloned

1319
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,734
must be labeled
as cloned foods.

1320
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:21,028
These cloned animals are

1321
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,823
a fundamentally
new thing.

1322
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,450
But I find it incredible
that the FDA

1323
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:30,329
not only wants to allow the sale of meat
from cloned animals

1324
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,123
without further research,

1325
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:34,917
but also wants to allow
the sale of this meat

1326
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,836
without any labeling.

1327
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,004
How many witnesses
in opposition, please?

1328
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,549
Noelle Cremers
with California Farm Bureau.

1329
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,008
And if I can point out--

1330
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:45,761
the reason that we are
concerned with labeling

1331
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:49,098
is it creates unnecessary fear
in a consumer's mind.

1332
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,808
Until the industry
has an opportunity

1333
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:52,810
to educate why we want
to use this technology

1334
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,353
and the value
of the technology,

1335
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,731
we don't feel that
consumers just having

1336
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:58,691
a warning label
will help them.

1337
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,360
(chatting)

1338
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,783
Pollan: These companies fight
tooth and nail

1339
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,577
against labeling.

1340
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,621
The fast food industry
fought against

1341
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,498
giving you
the calorie information.

1342
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:16,500
They fought against
telling you

1343
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,169
if there's trans fat
in their food.

1344
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:20,921
The meat packing industry
for years prevented

1345
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,257
country-of-origin labeling.

1346
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,344
They fought not to label
genetically modified foods,

1347
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:30,848
and now 78% of the processed food
in the supermarket

1348
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:34,560
has some genetically-
modified ingredient.

1349
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,188
I think it's one
of the most important battles

1350
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,231
for consumers to fight--

1351
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,942
is the right to know what's
in their food and how it was grown.

1352
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,070
Not only
do they not want

1353
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,490
you to know
what's in it,

1354
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,909
they have managed
to make it against the law

1355
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,661
to criticize
their products.

1356
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,249
Man: Can you tell me how
you've changed how you eat?

1357
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,251
Yeah, we--

1358
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:02,004
you'll probably have to
talk to an attorney

1359
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,422
before you would
put this in there.

1360
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,299
What? You can say this is--
we've stopped--

1361
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:07,009
I know, but--

1362
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,969
I could have the meat
and poultry industry

1363
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,679
coming after me
and I really--

1364
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:13,516
Seriously? For saying--
that it's so--

1365
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:15,559
It depends
on the context.

1366
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,436
You're not saying
"Someone else don't eat it."

1367
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,938
Yeah, I'm sorry,
Robbie,

1368
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,232
but I get asked this
all the time.

1369
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:24,318
Initially,
my reaction was

1370
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,612
"I don't care.
Let them sue me.

1371
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,781
Let them try
and sue the mother

1372
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,367
of a dead child
and see."

1373
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:34,370
It's pretty amazing
that you can't say

1374
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:37,289
- how you and your family have changed--
- The veggie libel laws...

1375
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,333
(stammers)

1376
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,336
are different.

1377
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,383
The food industry has
different protections

1378
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,802
than other industries do.

1379
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,305
We have a lot of questions
about this mad cow disease.

1380
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,392
Kowalcyk: If you recall the case
where Oprah was sued

1381
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:58,561
by the meat industry

1382
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:01,230
for something
she said on her show.

1383
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,440
It has just
stopped me cold

1384
01:21:03,483 --> 01:21:05,359
from eating
another burger.

1385
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,376
- Man: Good morning, Oprah.
- Good morning, y'all.

1386
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,628
Man #2: Are you glad to see
it's finally winding down?

1387
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:28,132
Well, I think
I can say that, right?

1388
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:31,844
I can say that, yeah.
I can see the end in sight.

1389
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,306
Schlosser:
In Colorado it's a felony

1390
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:37,808
if you're convicted
under a veggie libel law.

1391
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:39,310
So you could
go to prison

1392
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:41,186
for criticizing
the ground beef

1393
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,480
that's being produced
in the state of Colorado.

1394
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:46,775
There is an effort
in several farm states

1395
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:48,777
to make it illegal
to publish

1396
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,448
a photo of any
industrial food operation,

1397
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:55,326
any feedlot operation.

1398
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:57,328
Schlosser:
At the same time, they've also gotten

1399
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:01,707
bills passed that are
called cheeseburger bills

1400
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,626
that make it very
very difficult

1401
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,586
for you to sue them.

1402
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,380
These companies have
legions of attorneys

1403
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,884
and they may sue even though they know
they can't win

1404
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:14,261
just to send a message.

1405
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:29,193
Man: We are on record
for the deposition of Maurice Parr

1406
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:31,028
in the matter
of Monsanto Company

1407
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,905
and Monsanto Technology
versus Maurice Parr.

1408
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:37,284
Man #2: Mr. Parr, we subpoenaed
your bank records

1409
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:38,953
in this case.
Do you know that?

1410
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,585
Parr: I'll tell you, what really
scared me the most today

1411
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:51,256
was the fact that they have every check
that I have written

1412
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:54,093
from every bank account
that I've used

1413
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,595
in the last 10 years.

1414
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,639
Man #2: Do you own any land,
Mr. Parr?

1415
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,808
- Yes.
- Man #2: How many acres do you own?

1416
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:01,892
Three.

1417
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:04,103
Man #2: How long have you had
this Dell computer?

1418
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:07,815
Which ones are soybean seed
cleaning customers?

1419
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,817
- Mr. Kaufman?
- Beans only.

1420
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:12,361
Parr:
These people are not just customers,

1421
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,446
they're personal friends.

1422
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:18,075
It's extremely
heart-wrenching for me

1423
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:21,620
to know that this list is
in the possession of Monsanto.

1424
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,497
Harold Sinn?

1425
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,542
Beans only.

1426
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,544
Stephen Pennell:
This is the first case

1427
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:31,505
in which
a seed company is suing

1428
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,507
the person who does
the cleaning of the seed.

1429
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,677
So if Monsanto's claims
are upheld in this case,

1430
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,387
that would not only put
Moe out of business,

1431
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,598
but it would prohibit
every grower in the country

1432
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:44,977
from doing what
Moe does as a precedent in future cases.

1433
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,896
Man #2:
Have any of these customers specifically

1434
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,898
told you that
they are not going to use

1435
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:52,943
- your seed-cleaning services anymore?
- Ron Merrill.

1436
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,904
Parr's voice: This essentially puts me
out of business.

1437
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:58,657
- Max Lowe.
- Parr's voice: I'm finished.

1438
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,744
Jerry Kaufman.
Bill Zeering.

1439
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:04,246
Robert Duvall.

1440
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:24,141
Pollan: We've had a food system
that's been dedicated

1441
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,268
to the single virtue
of efficiency,

1442
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,813
so we grow a very small
number of crops,

1443
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,774
a very small number
of varieties,

1444
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:33,859
a very small
number of companies.

1445
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,320
And even though
you achieve efficiencies,

1446
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,822
the system gets
more and more precarious.

1447
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:41,033
You will have
a breakdown eventually.

1448
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,035
And where the breakdown
comes in the system

1449
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,787
we don't always know.

1450
01:24:46,706 --> 01:24:49,583
Roush: Modern production agriculture
is highly dependent

1451
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:52,628
on large amounts
of petroleum.

1452
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,506
Our farm,
we're going to use

1453
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:58,550
about 40,000 gallons
of diesel fuel a year.

1454
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,136
Pollan:
We eat a lot of oil without knowing it.

1455
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,639
To bring
a steer to slaughter,

1456
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:05,974
it's 75 gallons of oil.

1457
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:08,560
So what we're seeing is

1458
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,146
that this
highly-efficient machine

1459
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:15,400
does not have the resilience
to deal with shocks

1460
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:18,237
such as the spike
in oil prices.

1461
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:21,782
Food prices
last month were 3.9% higher

1462
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,700
than they were
a year ago.

1463
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:25,702
Take corn, another basic
source of food,

1464
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:27,412
up to a 12-year high.

1465
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,082
Pollan:
For a while, we could sell grains

1466
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,708
so cheaply
anywhere in the world,

1467
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:34,837
farmers in other countries
who aren't being subsidized

1468
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:36,880
could not
compete with us.

1469
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:39,424
So their capacity
to grow food

1470
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,426
for themselves
was compromised.

1471
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,554
Roush:
The world's running out of food

1472
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:46,306
and nobody's talking about it.
We have no reserves.

1473
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:48,517
Man: There have been protests
around the world.

1474
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,062
The food crisis has already
brought down one government.

1475
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:54,606
Pollan:
A month doesn't go by

1476
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:56,775
where there isn't
a story in the news

1477
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:59,111
that peels back
the curtain

1478
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,779
on how that
industrial food is made.

1479
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,447
(mooing pitifully)

1480
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,409
Man:
Downer cows-- too ill or lame to walk--

1481
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:08,370
being brutalized to get them
to their feet for slaughter.

1482
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,331
Woman: Millions of gallons
of concentrated hog manure

1483
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:13,959
flushing their contents downriver.

1484
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,794
Woman #2:
Government's food czar reported

1485
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,046
that there are no tools
in place to track

1486
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:21,258
the origin of the latest
salmonella outbreak.

1487
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:24,761
Pollan: Every time one of these
stories comes out,

1488
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:26,889
America learns
a little bit more--

1489
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:29,892
what's going on in the kitchen
where their food is being prepared.

1490
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:34,313
And every time
they turn away in revulsion

1491
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,523
and start looking
for alternatives.

1492
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:46,325
Hirshberg: The irony is that
the average consumer

1493
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,368
does not feel
very powerful.

1494
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:50,787
They think
they are the recipients

1495
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:53,081
of whatever industry
has put out there

1496
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:54,666
for them to consume.

1497
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,543
Trust me,
it's the exact opposite.

1498
01:26:57,712 --> 01:27:00,214
When we run an item past
the supermarket scanner,

1499
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:03,675
we're voting for local
or not, organic or not.

1500
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:07,137
At Wal-Mart, we made
a decision about a year ago

1501
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:10,474
to go through a process of becoming
rBST-free in our milk supply.

1502
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:12,976
We made that decision based
on customer preference.

1503
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:15,312
Hirshberg:
Individual consumers

1504
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,439
changed the biggest
company on earth

1505
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,233
and in so doing,

1506
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,860
probably put the last nail
in the coffin

1507
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,487
for synthetic
growth hormone.

1508
01:27:25,114 --> 01:27:27,282
Pollan: To eat well
in this country costs more

1509
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:30,577
than to eat badly.
It will take more money

1510
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,287
and some people simply
don't have it.

1511
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,914
And that's one
of the reasons

1512
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,874
that we need changes
at the policy level,

1513
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,877
so that the carrots are
a better deal than the chips.

1514
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:43,090
Schlosser: People think
"These companies are so big

1515
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:45,884
and so powerful, how are we ever going
to change things?"

1516
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,761
But look at
the tobacco industry.

1517
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:51,014
It had huge control
over public policy

1518
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:53,308
and that control
was broken.

1519
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,770
The battle against tobacco
is a perfect model

1520
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:00,315
of how an industry's
irresponsible behavior

1521
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,276
can be changed.

1522
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:04,611
(people talking)

1523
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:08,240
Salatin: Imagine what it would be if,
as a national policy,

1524
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,410
we said we would be
only successful

1525
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:14,538
if we had
fewer people going

1526
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:17,457
to the hospital
next year than last year.

1527
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,460
How about that
for success?

1528
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:22,504
The idea then
would be to have

1529
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,131
such nutritionally dense

1530
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:25,632
unadulterated food

1531
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:29,219
that people who ate it
actually felt better,

1532
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,138
had more energy,

1533
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,849
and weren't sick as much.

1534
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:36,184
Now see,
that's a noble goal.

1535
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:39,604
Kowalcyk: I can't change the fact
that Kevin's dead.

1536
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:43,817
When you tell somebody
you've lost a child,

1537
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,236
I really don't like
that look of pity

1538
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,113
that comes
into their eyes,

1539
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,907
that they feel
sorry for me.

1540
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:53,368
I can have a pity party
all by myself very well,

1541
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:56,621
thank you.
I don't need it from other people.

1542
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,582
What I need
them to do is listen

1543
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,542
and help me
effect a change.

1544
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,755
Roush: You have to understand
that we farmers,

1545
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:08,800
we're gonna deliver to the marketplace
what the marketplace demands.

1546
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:11,094
If you want
to buy $2 milk,

1547
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:15,098
you're gonna get a feedlot
in the backyard. It's that simple.

1548
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:17,517
People have got
to start demanding

1549
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,936
good, wholesome
food of us.

1550
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:21,605
And we'll deliver.
I promise you.

1551
01:29:21,647 --> 01:29:24,524
We're very ingenious people.
We'll deliver.

1552
01:29:24,567 --> 01:29:27,027
That's all
I had to say.
