1
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:40,210
Stop.

2
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,249
This is coming down.

3
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:45,749
What? Why?

4
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:50,314
No, I love the idea of the mirror
on the ceiling, but that's just ugly.

5
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:53,177
But the thing is,
you look beautiful in it.

6
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:57,791
Now, see, if we're gonna take it down,
we gotta at least try it out...

7
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,786
...christen the new house.

8
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,554
And what do you suggest we use
for a bed?

9
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:07,734
We don't need a bed, because we got
this fine carpet right here.

10
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:13,567
So I guess we'll have fine carpet
tattoos all over our asses.

11
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:16,051
Wait, baby,
don't you have to go to work?

12
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,068
I don't want any 30-second nookie.

13
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:23,165
I told them I'd be late. Now what?

14
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,813
- What about the movers?
- The movers?

15
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:27,679
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be here in an hour.

16
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:30,557
Which is just enough time.

17
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,554
Derek. You are so bad.

18
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,532
Like that isn't why you married me?

19
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:39,916
What about Kyle?

20
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,398
He'll be all right.
That boy will sleep through anything.

21
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:37,313
Gage Bendix?

22
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:39,823
Excuse me?

23
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:43,330
I couldn't help but notice
we were both going to 22.

24
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:46,602
Gage Bendix, yeah. I work there.

25
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,204
I thought that you might.

26
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:53,978
You have an appointment with us?

27
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:55,938
Why, do I look like a client?

28
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:58,798
Actually, you do.

29
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:02,560
Well, well, I hate to shatter the illusion,
but I'm a temp.

30
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,564
You're a temp?

31
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,513
Girl's gotta pay the rent.

32
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,718
I would've never guessed a temp.

33
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,110
Let me help you out.

34
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,853
There you go.

35
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,390
Thanks. I owe you one.

36
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,277
- Good morning.
- Morning.

37
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:51,366
Are you following me?

38
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,807
No, I'm taking these files
to Mr. Charles's office.

39
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,622
- Derek Charles?
- Yeah, I guess you probably know him.

40
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,216
Yeah, I know who he is
and he's an asshole.

41
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,602
Takes himself way too seriously.
But don't tell him I said that, okay?

42
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,229
- I could get you in trouble?
- Oh, yeah. Big trouble.

43
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:07,454
My lips are sealed.

44
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:11,170
- Patrick.
- Good morning, Derek.

45
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,171
How is the new house?

46
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:16,170
Chaos, man, chaos. I got out
just as the movers showed up.

47
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:17,548
Sharon must have loved that.

48
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:19,856
Yeah, if she calls mad,
you tell her I'm in a meeting.

49
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,774
Hey. Remember who used to sit
at this desk, huh?

50
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:23,976
She'll know I'm lying.

51
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,142
Can I help you?

52
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:29,031
That's Derek Charles?

53
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,569
Yes.

54
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,397
Better watch out, girl, he's married.

55
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,599
- The good ones are always married.
- Right. Or straight.

56
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,632
Did you talk to our German friend,
Herr Ganz?

57
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,905
Actually, I just got off the phone
with him.

58
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,856
- And?
- He doesn't like the way...

59
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:50,299
...the stock market's gyrating, thinks
the hedge-fund wave is about to crest.

60
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,728
- You think he's right?
- No, no. I don't think he's right.

61
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:55,343
He's wrong. You know Ganz.

62
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:57,708
He gets paranoid when
anything goes mainstream.

63
00:07:58,332 --> 00:07:59,404
So he makes a lot of noise...

64
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,557
...but I managed to talk him
into a private-equity portfolio instead.

65
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,389
To the tune of 155 million.

66
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,669
Ben, I want you to throw Derek
your support on this one.

67
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:14,463
I am just honoured
to exist in Derek's world.

68
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:15,638
Whose legs are those?

69
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,991
- Never seen them before.
- I think she's a new temp.

70
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:19,682
I think you mean temptress.

71
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:22,335
Always nice to have a girl
around the office, isn't it Boys?

72
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:26,008
Derek married the last eye candy
we had, took her off the market.

73
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,761
Yes, sir.
Miss us a little Sharon around here.

74
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:30,917
I don't think you do.

75
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,611
- Patrick, forward my calls.
- Will do.

76
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:37,398
- Okay. Good night, Marge.
- Bye, Derek.

77
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:42,728
D, you cutting out early? I grabbed us
a couple tickets to the Lakers tonight.

78
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,898
You're killing me. I'm in a midlle of a moving man.

79
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,420
- I gotta get home.
- So?

80
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,439
So do I look like a man
who wants to get a divorce?

81
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:50,531
Why don't I call her and say
we got a work emergency?

82
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:51,532
Come on!

83
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,357
- No, thanks, I'll stay married.
- Coward.

84
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:54,240
Yeah.

85
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:58,975
Goodbye, Mr. Charles.

86
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:05,273
- You punked me.
- I'm sorry, but you set me up.

87
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:08,503
I'll get my revenge.
You might like to know...

88
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:11,192
...that everybody disagrees with you.
- About what?

89
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,214
About Derek Charles
being an asshole.

90
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,895
They say he's the nicest guy
in the firm.

91
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:17,554
Yeah, well, I've got them fooled.

92
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:19,714
I'm Lisa, by the way.

93
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,595
Hey Lisa By the way
Good luck at your next job.

94
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:27,157
Hold the door, please.

95
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:29,740
They're keeping me on
for a few more days...

96
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:31,904
...so I might see you on Monday.

97
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:01,619
Sharon!

98
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:03,665
Your turn.

99
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,181
No, I think it's your turn!

100
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:08,232
Don't even try it.
It's definitely your turn.

101
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:10,016
Looks like I'm stuck, huh?

102
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:11,275
Huh, Kyle?

103
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:13,388
Come here.

104
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,990
Oh, my God.
What is your mom feeding you?

105
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,750
What do you think about giving
that magic mirror another test drive?

106
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,023
Sharon, you're so bad.

107
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,407
Like that's not why you married me.

108
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,897
- Morning, Marge.
- Morning, Derek.

109
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:21,069
Hi.

110
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:23,793
Remember me?

111
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:29,043
Lisa By The Way, right?

112
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:30,573
Very good, I'm impressed.

113
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:36,690
Hey, Marge, where's Patrick?

114
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:38,349
Out with the flu.

115
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:40,335
I did some trading
with the other temps...

116
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,715
...and I wrangled your desk.

117
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,137
I hope that's okay.

118
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:49,296
No, that's fine. Why don't you
grab a pad and a pen, follow me?

119
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,954
Here's a memo
for the Christmas party this Friday.

120
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:04,091
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

121
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,408
Sit down.

122
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,052
So why don't they invite spouses?

123
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:19,428
What?

124
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,228
To the party. It says no spouses.

125
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:27,821
Yeah, it's Joe Gage's rule. Actually,
it's like that at a lot of companies.

126
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:30,550
I guess they figure you're not gonna
kick back and let loose...

127
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:34,161
...if your spouse is there.
The reason of having the party, right?

128
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:37,090
- So does this party get pretty wild?
- Oh, not usually.

129
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,170
Well, that's no fun.

130
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,230
I called Patrick. He said that
you like it black with two sugars.

131
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:46,599
If it's cold, I can go nuke it
in the kitchen.

132
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:49,456
No, actually, it's perfect. Thank you
very much. Let's get started.

133
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,625
- Ready when you are.
- It's Monday.

134
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:53,129
- First things first.
- Took care of that.

135
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,775
Took care of what?

136
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:58,165
On Mondays
you always send your wife flowers.

137
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:01,206
This week you sent her
a dozen long-stemmed red roses.

138
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,453
I called to confirm
they've been delivered.

139
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,542
Thank you.

140
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:10,762
So how long have you two
been married?

141
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:13,235
Three years in March.

142
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:16,367
And you still send her flowers
every week. Lucky girl.

143
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,215
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition.

144
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,709
Patrick said that you started back
when she was your assistant.

145
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,427
sounds you and Patrick had quite
a conversation.

146
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:26,598
- Let's run some calls.
- Fire away.

147
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,948
Why don't we start
with Phil Trendle?

148
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:31,326
See if you can get a lunch
appointment next week...

149
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:34,127
...but push for The Water Grill.
I like the fish.

150
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:35,521
- The Water Grill's fantastic.
- Terry Mills.

151
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:38,223
- Am I going too fast?
- I'm just waiting on you.

152
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:42,946
Are you always this efficient?

153
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:44,161
Does that surprise you?

154
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:47,293
Yeah. Yeah, most of the temps
we get here, they're like...

155
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:49,277
I think you'll find
I'm not your typical temp.

156
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,219
We were at the grocery store,
I look over...

157
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,975
...and Kyle is flirting
with the checkout girl.

158
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:01,717
<i>She's about 16, and he's 2.</i>

159
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:05,926
<i>He was giving her the same look
you give when you see a pretty girl.</i>

160
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:09,953
I think you've been teaching my baby
how to flirt. Like father, like son.

161
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,419
<i>So, anyway, on the way home,
I stopped by campus today...</i>

162
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,363
<i>... and I pick ed up a catalogue
for next semester's curriculum.</i>

163
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,847
<i>Let me tell you, I cannot wait.</i>

164
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:22,804
Do you need me?

165
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,979
<i>I'm gonna show it to you tonight.
I need your opinion on my courses.</i>

166
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,435
Are you listening to me?

167
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:38,638
Baby.

168
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:43,160
If I bundle Managerial Economics
and Operations Management...

169
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,607
...then I won't take Management
Information Systems...

170
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:46,986
...until next semester, right?

171
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:48,694
School?

172
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,580
- Derek.
- It's like an online degree?

173
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:54,734
Come on, baby, not tonight.
You know this is important to me.

174
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,575
Well, it's important to me too...

175
00:14:56,792 --> 00:15:00,418
...but I was kind of hoping you liked
being a mom, staying home with Kyle.

176
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,144
You know I love being a mom.

177
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:07,907
We got all this room. I make
enough money for you and I to...

178
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:09,036
It's not about the money.

179
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:10,930
We had an agreement.

180
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:14,595
You said that you'd work hard, I'd have
the baby, you'd get your promotion.

181
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:15,940
Then I'd get my degree.

182
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:17,357
- I said that?
- Yes, you did.

183
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:20,460
You have something to talk about
when you get home.

184
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:21,794
I need some things to talk about it too.

185
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:24,690
- So Kyle's gonna be an only child?
- Let's get him a puppy.

186
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:28,178
A female that looks
like your side of the family...

187
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:30,989
...and tell him it's his sister.
- Can we call her Little Sharon?

188
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,742
Hey, Little Sharon. Come here.

189
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:34,500
You know exactly
who I'm talking about.

190
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:38,524
You know what, I wanna see you
say that in front of her face.

191
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:46,227
D? Why didn't you
call me back today?

192
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:48,708
- What time did you call?
- Around 4.

193
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,237
- You should leave a message.
- I did leave a message.

194
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:56,100
Oh, Patrick was sick,
and, you know, the temp...

195
00:15:56,503 --> 00:15:57,366
We had a temp and she said...

196
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,827
...Shannon called
but didn't leave a number.

197
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:04,645
She? I thought we had an agreement,
no female assistants.

198
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,784
Baby, I don't control
temp availability.

199
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:08,482
Is she pretty?

200
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:10,175
Pretty plain.

201
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:13,808
Actually, you know what,
she did a better job than Patrick.

202
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:16,452
Except for messing up
your message.

203
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:18,926
- I want her fired immediately.
- Immediately.

204
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,700
- I'm serious.
- I promise.

205
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,113
Good night, Shannon.

206
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,766
I hope i'm not intrupting anything

207
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,200
No, no, it's a treat to have you here.

208
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:39,113
I'm taking Kyle to The Grove today
to see Santa.

209
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:42,628
You wanna come?
Get your picture taken on Santa's lap?

210
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:44,975
No, I would, but I'm swamped.

211
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,667
You need me back in the office,
don't you?

212
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,145
Excuse me.
Here's your coffee, freshly nuked.

213
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,814
Hey, Lisa.

214
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:56,702
This is my wife, Sharon. Sharon,
this is Lisa. She's temping for Patrick.

215
00:16:57,821 --> 00:17:00,582
It is such a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Charles.

216
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,722
- Hi.
- Hi. And this must be Kyle.

217
00:17:04,035 --> 00:17:05,837
I can already tell
he's gonna be a heartbreaker.

218
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,160
Hi, Kyle. I'm Lisa.

219
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,365
Say hi, Kyle.

220
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:14,045
Oh, he can say hello. He's usually
not this shy around strangers.

221
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:17,709
What a handsome boy.
He looks just like you.

222
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:18,732
You think so?

223
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:22,012
Most people think he looks
like the beautiful Sharon.

224
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:23,992
Talk about the perfect family.

225
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,646
The three of you should be
on the cover of a magazine.

226
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,631
It's a good thing you won't be here
too long.

227
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:31,784
I know my husband
can be very demanding.

228
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,679
Actually, I'm learning a lot
from your husband.

229
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,657
I bet you are.

230
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,126
Joe Gage needs to see you
when you have a moment.

231
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:42,763
Great.

232
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:46,079
It's nice to meet you, Sharon.

233
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,354
You too, Liz.

234
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,401
- It's Lisa.
- Excuse me?

235
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:52,111
It's Lisa. You said Liz.

236
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,007
Sorry. Lisa.

237
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:03,430
- Sharon.
- Wasn't me. Blame Shannon.

238
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,934
- What's the deal with her?
- What do you mean?

239
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,998
"Looks just like you, Derek."

240
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,239
But he is kind of handsome like me.

241
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:12,750
You said she was plain.

242
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:15,258
That girl may be a lot,
but she ain't plain.

243
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:18,453
I wouldn't know.
I only have eyes for you.

244
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,866
And you really think
that's gonna work?

245
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:21,437
Come on.

246
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:25,301
Take you around the office.
You can see the old gang.

247
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:26,396
I know that you must miss it.

248
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,401
- When is Patrick coming back?
- Tomorrow.

249
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,208
You better hope so.

250
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:26,526
Crudo.

251
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:51,369
Wow, look at the tree.

252
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:53,806
Christmas already.

253
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,174
- Hey, Stan.
- Good morning, Mr. Charles.

254
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:00,307
- I'm back.
- Patrick.

255
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,967
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, thanks.

256
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:05,900
You know it's gonna take a lot more
than some stomach bug...

257
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,228
...to keep me away
from that Christmas party.

258
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:09,523
Yeah.

259
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:11,988
Not sure we can say the same
for Marge.

260
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,503
Wow, you get around, don't you?

261
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:21,368
Poor girl called in sick
with the stomach bug.

262
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:22,680
She caught it from Patrick.

263
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,211
That's what she gets
for using my lip gloss.

264
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,346
All right, girls.
Behave yourselves out here.

265
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,774
So how many times did you get busted
listening in on Derek's calls?

266
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,091
As if you don't.

267
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,511
I'm way too smooth
to ever get caught.

268
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:44,062
- I bet you are.
- How long have you been here?

269
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:46,438
- Ten years in April.
- I bet you know more...

270
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,828
...about what happens
behind these doors than anybody.

271
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:50,976
Sweetie, you have no idea.

272
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,825
My nickname around here is 411.

273
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:57,149
411. Well, maybe we can grab
a cocktail after work sometime.

274
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,074
You can catch me up with girl talk.

275
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:02,348
If you think you can pump me for
information with a couple of Cosmos...

276
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,449
...you're right.

277
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,018
I'm sorry, I thought everyone
was at lunch.

278
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:30,136
- I should go.
- No.

279
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:33,121
You stay. Okay?

280
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:36,834
I'm gonna just grab my lunch and...

281
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,162
...head on back to my office.

282
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:42,327
Okay?

283
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,275
- You okay? You wanna talk about it?
- It's nothing.

284
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:55,951
Nothing?

285
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:02,728
You know, most people I know
don't cry over nothing.

286
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:04,953
You think I'm crying?

287
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:07,994
This is just allergies.

288
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:10,161
Oh, allergies, okay.
What are you allergic to?

289
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,856
Men, apparently.

290
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:16,835
Can I sit down?

291
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:20,441
Yeah.

292
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,849
You having boyfriend troubles
right now?

293
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,295
I'm beginning to think
there's something wrong with me.

294
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,066
There's nothing wrong with you.

295
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,364
I wish I could believe that.

296
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,536
Maybe you haven't met
the right guy yet.

297
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,385
I'm beginning to think
all the good ones are taken.

298
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:52,661
I'm no expert, but, you know,
if it didn't work out...

299
00:22:52,808 --> 00:22:54,145
...then maybe it wasn't meant to be.

300
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:57,508
Maybe.

301
00:22:57,945 --> 00:22:59,699
And then, you know,
you're gonna meet the right guy...

302
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:02,363
...you'll know immediately.

303
00:23:02,743 --> 00:23:04,618
Is that how it was
with you and Sharon?

304
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:07,591
Yeah. Yeah, it does happen.

305
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,223
- Great. Now I'm jealous.
- Why?

306
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,737
She has everything.

307
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:17,622
Perfect husband, perfect child,
perfect marriage.

308
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:20,628
No. No, nothing's perfect.

309
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,520
You know, there are problems
in every relationship.

310
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,598
The most important thing
is to move forward.

311
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:27,372
You gotta keep moving forward,
you know?

312
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:32,151
Hey, Lisa, look, don't beat yourself up
over this guy.

313
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,051
Look at you, you're a bright,
attractive woman.

314
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,622
Any man would be lucky
to have you.

315
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,060
Yeah, right.

316
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:43,340
No. Honestly, if I were single...

317
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,851
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

318
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,843
Is it working?

319
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:49,183
Yes.

320
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:51,644
Good.

321
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,266
You hang in there, okay?

322
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,059
It's gonna be just fine.

323
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,643
Thanks, Derek.

324
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:03,735
Mister... Mr. Charles.

325
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:11,035
I'm sorry, excuse me.

326
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:13,582
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

327
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:18,304
What was that all about?

328
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:21,537
Oh, man, her boyfriend dumped her
and I was being nice.

329
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,884
I'll take up that slack.
That is one smoking hot piece of ass.

330
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,144
- Stop it, Ben.
- Come on. Like you haven't noticed.

331
00:24:27,326 --> 00:24:29,169
No, dude,
I'm not in the game anymore.

332
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:31,298
I'm retired and coaching, as are you.

333
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,776
I'm still in the game. I'm just
on the bench, waiting to play again.

334
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:37,652
Careful, D.
It's not like the old days...

335
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:40,815
...where you could get away with
office nookie and not get nailed for it.

336
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:42,163
Careful, D?

337
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,187
You went and married yours,
that's all.

338
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:45,877
If you're thinking of that girl...

339
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:47,797
- You saw her first.
- You are a fool.

340
00:24:48,382 --> 00:24:51,585
Sadly, I don't think I'm her type.
Now, you, on the other hand...

341
00:24:53,678 --> 00:24:55,362
All I'm saying
is that these single gals...

342
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,463
...see the workplace
as their hunting ground.

343
00:24:58,302 --> 00:25:02,745
And I think this one has got you
in her cross hairs.

344
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:18,589
Sharon. Hey.

345
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:23,187
I just put him to sleep, baby.

346
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:27,221
Red? Blue?

347
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:28,814
- Red? Blue?
- The red one.

348
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,179
- What you doing tonight?
- The usual. Formula, oatmeal.

349
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,511
How do I look?

350
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,153
- You look all right.
- I look all right.

351
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:46,057
Remember the last time you went
to that party and got drunk.

352
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:49,480
Kyle.

353
00:26:50,403 --> 00:26:51,596
Eat something.

354
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:55,389
I will. I'm gonna grab a burger
at Jake's.

355
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,716
- Okay. I love you.
- Okay. I love you too.

356
00:27:00,522 --> 00:27:04,123
Fourth quarter, Derek Charles
puts it up, three seconds to go.

357
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:09,925
- I love you, baby.
- Bye. Eat something, baby.

358
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,371
- This seat taken?
- Yeah.

359
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,208
No, I'm kidding.

360
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:46,540
Be my guest.

361
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:53,053
- Look at you.
- It's a Christmas party.

362
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,162
Oh, yeah. You look great.

363
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:57,692
Thank you.
You grabbing a bite before?

364
00:27:58,173 --> 00:27:59,211
Yeah. You too?

365
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:01,192
Brilliant minds think alike.

366
00:28:01,386 --> 00:28:03,469
Thank you, John.
Still the best burger in town.

367
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:04,786
Really?

368
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:07,715
Hey, John? John?

369
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:09,718
John.

370
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:14,085
- Can I have one too?
- Fix her up. The special.

371
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:23,170
- That was delicious.
- I told you.

372
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:27,732
You know, we used to come back here
after a hard day's work and cut loose.

373
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:29,720
- Work hard, play hard?
- Yeah.

374
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,798
Back in the day,
I would throw them back too.

375
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,480
Hey, how's your boyfriend trouble?

376
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:38,559
- Keep moving forward, right?
- Exactly.

377
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,078
- All right.
- So, what's the grand plan, Derek?

378
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,682
Run the company by 35...

379
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:50,069
...jet by 40, retire on my private island
and own the Lakers by 50.

380
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:52,173
- I'm a Sixers fan.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

381
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,801
I'll bring you around to my team,
okay?

382
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:57,876
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

383
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,406
Can...? Can I please have
a dirty martini?

384
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:01,437
Sure.

385
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:03,657
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

386
00:29:05,198 --> 00:29:07,552
Oh, come on. Big talker.

387
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:08,794
No, thanks.

388
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,135
- It's Christmas time. Work's dead.
- John, no.

389
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,371
- Bring one for my friend.
- How dirty do you want it?

390
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:19,293
Make it filthy.

391
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:23,730
This is for you.

392
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:34,091
Patrick? Patrick. Patrick.

393
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:37,562
Once again, great job as the head
of the decoration committee.

394
00:29:37,827 --> 00:29:40,878
- You're like Santa's Little Helper.
- Well, I wouldn't let your people do it.

395
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:45,749
Hey, don't try this at home, huh?
You'll hurt yourself.

396
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:55,542
What's up?

397
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,475
What's going on?
You look beautiful.

398
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,170
I'll be right back.

399
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:02,926
I'm coming for you, Derek.

400
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,227
- I'm coming for you.
- No. I don't dance.

401
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,566
No, come on, you don't wanna
with me. Okay, okay.

402
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:10,366
Yeah. All right.

403
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:18,568
- Is this you, Marge?
- That's me.

404
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,516
- Didn't know you could move like that.
- Because I'm stuck behind a desk.

405
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:25,351
- Okay, you do have legs under there.
- Oh, yes, I do.

406
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:34,380
- All right. You are smooth.
- Smooth, baby, real smooth.

407
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,127
- Really smooth.
- I'm coming in Marge.

408
00:30:36,754 --> 00:30:38,305
All righty, baby. He's all yours.

409
00:30:40,686 --> 00:30:43,662
- Hey, Office Asshole.
- That's Mr. Office Asshole to you.

410
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:44,567
Tequila?

411
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:49,597
Beer, three martinis, and tequila?
No, I don't think so.

412
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:50,664
Coward.

413
00:30:58,929 --> 00:30:59,739
Bring it on.

414
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,257
You've got the moves.

415
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:04,122
That's Soul Train for you, baby.

416
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,435
- What you got?
- Wanna see what I got?

417
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:09,401
- Let's go, let's go.
- Bring it.

418
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:13,089
You got some moves. Okay, temp.

419
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:16,627
- Nasty, nasty.
- Hey.

420
00:31:17,517 --> 00:31:19,011
You know,
I wasn't gonna come tonight.

421
00:31:19,482 --> 00:31:19,703
Why not?

422
00:31:21,537 --> 00:31:23,052
I haven't been here that long and...

423
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:28,554
I'm sure everybody here is happy
that you showed up.

424
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:31,760
Even you?

425
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:35,804
What do you mean, "even me"?
I'm your biggest supporter here.

426
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:45,823
You wanna put one on the cheek?

427
00:31:49,352 --> 00:31:51,978
If you don't, people will
really think something's going on.

428
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:56,976
Well, we're gonna have
to take that chance then, huh?

429
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:02,820
Whoa, where you going?

430
00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:06,379
This evening's just getting started.
Sally Sloane. We got Sally Sloane.

431
00:32:06,696 --> 00:32:08,941
You remember her?
She gave us lap dances!

432
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:10,306
- Sally.
- Derek has singles!

433
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:13,130
- He has singles!
- I gotta go home, sober up.

434
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:15,074
You wanna get out of here
and go find trouble?

435
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:18,677
- No, thank you. No, thank you.
- Where is your holiday spirit?

436
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:20,512
With my wife and kid.

437
00:32:21,076 --> 00:32:23,361
Gotta take a leak, then I'm sneaking
out of here, all right?

438
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:26,993
You're no fun, D. No fun at all.

439
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,019
Lisa, Lisa.

440
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,430
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop.

441
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,911
Come on, stop, no.

442
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:49,626
<i>Fuck.</i>

443
00:32:58,015 --> 00:32:59,352
<i>You need to stop it.</i>

444
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:04,405
Who's there?

445
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,294
Stop. Okay. Okay.

446
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:13,457
Lisa, Lisa.

447
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:19,317
Oh, God, Lisa, Lisa. Stop. Stop.
Don't do that. Don't...

448
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:24,262
Stop, stop.

449
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:35,753
Lisa, stop.

450
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,642
Stop.

451
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:49,889
Stop.

452
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:55,060
- What? Derek.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

453
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,818
What's wrong? Derek!

454
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,399
Cab vouchers for anybody
who can't drive. Don't want you hurt.

455
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:14,693
Come on, don't be shy.

456
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:23,834
Freak.

457
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:31,752
Well, well, well.
Living dangerously, aren't we?

458
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:34,942
Patrick, you silly old queen.

459
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:37,687
Dance with me.

460
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:41,516
Dance with me.

461
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,042
How was it?

462
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,572
The usual, baby.

463
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:12,338
Anything interesting happen?

464
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:16,356
No.

465
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:36,683
Good morning.

466
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:38,692
Hey. Morning.

467
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:41,854
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

468
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,282
Man, you should've stayed.

469
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,311
Roger from Acquisitions tossed
his cookies on the Christmas tree.

470
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:48,874
Sorry I missed that.

471
00:36:58,741 --> 00:36:59,868
Bad time?

472
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,935
No.

473
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:07,053
Joe wants to know when you'll
be done with the Ganz portfolio.

474
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,254
Tell him I'll have it to him
by the end of the day.

475
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:13,950
Thanks.

476
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:16,804
Sure.

477
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:25,331
Joe really likes the ladies, huh?

478
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,161
I wouldn't know.

479
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:49,240
Hey. All right if I take off?

480
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:51,884
- Yeah. Go home.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

481
00:37:52,122 --> 00:37:52,729
Okay.

482
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:55,146
Hey, Lisa.

483
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:35,547
Hey.

484
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:42,047
I owe you an apology
for the Christmas party.

485
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:46,285
I think that I sort of took you
by surprise.

486
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:50,941
Yeah, you know,
we both had a few drinks.

487
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:54,031
So let's just forget about it.

488
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,010
What if I can't?

489
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:08,104
Lisa, nothing happened.

490
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,982
All right, have it your way.
Nothing happened.

491
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:19,216
All right, get out of my car.

492
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:21,897
Get out of my car right now.

493
00:39:24,415 --> 00:39:25,540
Get out of my car.

494
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:26,964
Relax.

495
00:39:27,722 --> 00:39:30,349
- Derek, relax.
- Come on. Out of my car.

496
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:33,145
- Get out of here.
- No one's around to see us.

497
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,551
God. I almost went insane today.
Having to pretend...

498
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,587
...like I was concentrating on work,
when all I could think about...

499
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:43,379
Lisa! Get out of my car now!

500
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,391
Derek, what's wrong?

501
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:48,132
- What did I do?
- Hey, hey.

502
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:51,055
I don't know what's wrong,
whether you're dense or what...

503
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:55,161
...but let me tell you something.
There's nothing going on between us.

504
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:59,022
Nothing! Okay? I wouldn't jeopardise
my job. For chrissakes, I work here.

505
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:01,106
Stop! Don't touch me. Just get out.

506
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:02,135
Get out.

507
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:03,310
Get out.

508
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:08,175
- Get out! Come on!
- God!

509
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:12,963
- Maybe you are an asshole.
- Yeah, all right. Get out.

510
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,303
Sharon?

511
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:55,172
Something I need to tell you.

512
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:03,136
What's wrong?

513
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:06,303
I spent the last hour and a half
talking my sister off the ledge.

514
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:08,279
- Sheila?
- Can you believe Tim's been having...

515
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:11,693
...an affair with some random
woman at work for a year and a half?

516
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:16,292
- How did she find out?
- Tim just blurted it out.

517
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:19,840
He said he was leaving her.
With three kids.

518
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:23,733
- Yeah, that's tough.
- It's a disaster. If it were me...

519
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:26,643
No, that would never be you,
because I would never cheat on you.

520
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:28,341
I know.

521
00:41:31,437 --> 00:41:32,653
Tim is an asshole.

522
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:35,409
Tell me about it.

523
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:41,302
So, what were you gonna tell me?

524
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:42,628
What?

525
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:45,725
You said you had something
to tell me. What is it?

526
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:48,458
No.

527
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,712
Just a problem at work.
Nothing I can't handle.

528
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,409
Why didn't you tell me?

529
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,886
Honestly, there was nothing to tell.

530
00:42:01,337 --> 00:42:04,286
She grabbed your package,
flashed you in your car.

531
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:06,631
Come on.
I thought we were best friends.

532
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:08,937
I cannot believe
you didn't tell me sooner.

533
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:11,332
- Ben, you think this is funny?
- Yes, I do.

534
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:14,638
I kind of thought maybe she was
into you a little. I just never figured...

535
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:16,244
I don't get it. You know, I...

536
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:18,853
Honestly, Ben.

537
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:22,434
"Hey, how are you?" I didn't...
I was just being nice.

538
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,679
That's all.

539
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,428
You sure you didn't lead her on?
Just a little?

540
00:42:27,734 --> 00:42:30,606
- No. Not a goddamn thing. Honestly.
- That girl is hot.

541
00:42:31,835 --> 00:42:34,421
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Report it to Human Resources.

542
00:42:35,494 --> 00:42:36,801
You're gonna get her fired?

543
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:40,603
- I don't have a choice.
- Let's just be careful about this.

544
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:43,748
What if she says
that you came onto her?

545
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,537
No way.

546
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:47,200
We're talking history
of behaviour here, Derek.

547
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:50,367
When's the last time you had
a female assistant at your desk, huh?

548
00:42:50,888 --> 00:42:51,906
People are gonna wonder.

549
00:43:04,728 --> 00:43:06,436
- Morning, Mr. Charles.
- Hey.

550
00:43:06,844 --> 00:43:07,685
- Hank back there?
- Go right in.

551
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,857
- Hey, Hank.
- Derek, hey.

552
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:12,144
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

553
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:21,160
I have... I have a personal matter
I gotta talk to you about.

554
00:43:22,253 --> 00:43:23,720
You know Lisa Sheridan, the temp?

555
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:25,778
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She worked your desk for a while.

556
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:28,866
Yeah, that's right. She did.

557
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:33,457
Hank, this is awkward, okay?

558
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,033
If you're here to file a complaint
about her performance...

559
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:38,342
...you can save your breath.

560
00:43:38,737 --> 00:43:40,085
Her agency called,
said she's not coming back in.

561
00:43:40,814 --> 00:43:41,729
They already sent a replacement.

562
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:44,761
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

563
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:49,012
They say why?

564
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:51,466
No.

565
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:56,367
Why, was there some sort
of problem?

566
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:57,877
Problem?

567
00:43:58,524 --> 00:44:02,647
No. No problem. No problem.

568
00:44:03,926 --> 00:44:08,766
I just thought she was way in
over her head, that's all.

569
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,342
- But if she already quit, then...
- She beat you to it.

570
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:12,986
Yeah.

571
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:19,401
Yeah.

572
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:25,708
- Was there anything else?
- No. Guess not.

573
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,265
- How's the new house?
- You know, couldn't be better.

574
00:44:28,658 --> 00:44:30,291
- Tell Sharon I said hi.
- I will.

575
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:33,378
Actually, you guys should come by
once we settle down. Come by.

576
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,106
- That sounds great.
- All right.

577
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,871
- See you, Hank.
- Bye-bye.

578
00:44:42,817 --> 00:44:44,649
- So?
- She quit.

579
00:44:44,904 --> 00:44:45,815
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

580
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,730
Do you have a horseshoe
up your ass?

581
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:49,165
You are the luckiest bastard I know.

582
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:51,139
Looks that way.

583
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,172
Not a bad early Christmas present.

584
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:53,874
All right.

585
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:22,615
Thank you.

586
00:45:22,903 --> 00:45:25,643
Thank you. I'm getting
all these gifts. Look at this.

587
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:32,564
Friedrich?

588
00:45:34,009 --> 00:45:35,140
Hey, it's Derek Charles.

589
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:39,665
Hey. How was your Christmas?

590
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:44,710
No, mine was great.
I had a great time with my family.

591
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,508
No, I'm in the office working
for you right now.

592
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:51,914
Absolutely. That's what we do.
That's what we do.

593
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:54,592
Hey, you take a look
at that prospectus for me?

594
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:58,627
I told you.

595
00:46:00,472 --> 00:46:01,648
I told you.

596
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:06,515
Yeah. No, I think we're gonna have
a great New Year.

597
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:16,659
Baby, it's after 3?

598
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:19,411
That's the last time I'm celebrating out
on New Years.

599
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:24,976
Next year, we'll celebrate at home.
Just you, me, and Kyle.

600
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,599
Aren't you gonna get that?

601
00:46:34,163 --> 00:46:36,415
No. It'll wait till the morning.

602
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:38,199
What if it's Ganz with the approval?

603
00:46:38,726 --> 00:46:41,595
It's noon in Munich. Go on, lazy.

604
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:53,477
Ganz?

605
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:55,344
No.

606
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:16,281
What was that?

607
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:19,959
Nothing. I just gotta get a
new spam blocker.

608
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:10,475
And then Joe was like:

609
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:13,767
"Oh, we're not drinking. This is a
retreat. We're gonna stay sober.

610
00:48:15,027 --> 00:48:15,986
Do some bonding."

611
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:19,575
If Joe said that, he must've
been drunk at the time.

612
00:48:19,745 --> 00:48:22,940
Right? So I'll call you later
and check on you and Kyle.

613
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:23,763
Okay.

614
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:32,932
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lap dance. Lap
dance. Who brought up lap dance?

615
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:35,497
This is... This is a business retreat.
This is work.

616
00:48:36,602 --> 00:48:39,337
We are clocked in.
Unless it was Joe's idea.

617
00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:41,572
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
so it must've been mine.

618
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,745
All righty. Well, then,
let's see a show of hands...

619
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,765
...of who wants to see
some hot, oily breasts...

620
00:48:49,053 --> 00:48:51,256
...being jammed into their faces?
Derek, are you in?

621
00:48:51,988 --> 00:48:53,228
I'm a married man.

622
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,300
- I don't have to pay for it.
- You're paying.

623
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,142
- You just don't know it yet.
- Hear, hear.

624
00:48:57,754 --> 00:48:59,505
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's this?

625
00:49:00,283 --> 00:49:01,408
A dirty martini.

626
00:49:01,794 --> 00:49:04,399
- No, I didn't...
- It's from the lady at the bar.

627
00:49:05,399 --> 00:49:07,869
I do have to say I'm kind of a fan
of the waitress staff around here.

628
00:49:08,503 --> 00:49:10,176
We should hit one of those clubs.

629
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:12,076
Derek, are you okay?

630
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:15,875
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought I saw
somebody I know.

631
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:18,450
Somebody you know,
or somebody you'd like to know?

632
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:20,780
He can't be tempted.

633
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:22,992
Can't blame him.
Too scared of Sharon.

634
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:26,531
Speaking of Sharon, I said
I'd call her. I'll be right back.

635
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:31,346
Hey. Hey, babe.

636
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:34,419
<i>How's the male bonding?</i>

637
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,889
As you can guess,
everybody's wasted.

638
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:40,970
In about half an hour, I'll be able...

639
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:44,016
<i>Derek, are you there?</i>

640
00:49:45,017 --> 00:49:46,743
<i>Wait, I think Kyle wants
to say good night.</i>

641
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,644
<i>Derek, are you still there?</i>

642
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:53,139
- Babe, I gotta call you right back.
- It'll just tak e a second.

643
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:55,804
<i>- Say good night to Daddy.
- They're calling for me to come back.</i>

644
00:49:56,192 --> 00:49:58,036
<i>- Honey, I'm gonna call you right back.
- Derek?</i>

645
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,048
Derek?

646
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:02,380
Was that Sharon?

647
00:50:02,932 --> 00:50:05,248
I can always tell from
the pained look on your face...

648
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:06,920
...when you've been talking to her.

649
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,372
How did you know I'd be here?

650
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,258
What's wrong? You don't look happy
to see me.

651
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:15,745
I'm not happy to see you.

652
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:16,639
What are you doing here?

653
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,224
You said that you would
never jeopardise your job.

654
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,718
That's why I quit,
so that we could be together.

655
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:26,081
You misunderstood me.

656
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:31,386
I'm married, happily married.
There will never be us...

657
00:50:31,872 --> 00:50:33,920
...together, ever.

658
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:37,123
You're worried what Joe and Ben
might think.

659
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:38,918
I'll tell you what they'll think.

660
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:41,963
They'll think that we arranged it
and we did.

661
00:50:44,063 --> 00:50:45,056
What are you talking about?

662
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:48,434
I see what you're doing.

663
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:52,708
One of us has to take charge,
and I guess that's gonna be me.

664
00:50:52,937 --> 00:50:57,403
So you go back and you say your
good nights to the boys, and...

665
00:50:57,948 --> 00:50:59,379
...l'll be waiting in my room, 610.

666
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,890
I'm not coming to your room.

667
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,959
- You want me to come to yours?
- You're sick.

668
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:07,036
- You need help.
- I know.

669
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,511
Help me, Derek.

670
00:51:11,314 --> 00:51:12,668
You stay away from me.

671
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:18,768
<i>- Sharon?
- Sharon?</i>

672
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:21,303
<i>It's Ben.
Dude, you done for the night?</i>

673
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:23,798
No. I'm coming back.

674
00:51:28,738 --> 00:51:29,800
<i>Hey, come on, D, it's early.</i>

675
00:51:30,328 --> 00:51:32,285
<i>Let's hit my room, plunder the minibar,
charge it to Joe.</i>

676
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,562
<i>No, I, I can't. That last drink
totally kicked my ass, man.</i>

677
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:42,103
<i>All right, drunky. Don't forget,
9 a.m. tomorrow, Tiffany Room.</i>

678
00:51:42,554 --> 00:51:44,773
<i>Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.</i>

679
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:47,064
<i>Yeah, 9 a.m.</i>

680
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:48,472
<i>Lightweight.</i>

681
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:32,030
Out.

682
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:34,491
Baby.

683
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:38,752
No.

684
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,106
Does that feel good?

685
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:48,787
No.

686
00:52:52,743 --> 00:52:56,243
Hush, baby.

687
00:53:16,052 --> 00:53:17,822
No, please, stop.

688
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:28,860
Does that feel good?

689
00:53:44,752 --> 00:53:46,195
Housekeeping.

690
00:53:46,721 --> 00:53:48,212
- Sharon?
- Oh, sorry.

691
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:53,263
Oh, God.

692
00:54:01,797 --> 00:54:03,434
Oh, shit.

693
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,886
Of course,
we here at Gage Bendix...

694
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,016
...have a couple advantages
over the competition...

695
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:13,788
...not the least of which is the fact
that we are privately held.

696
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:17,237
So we don't worry about the transparency
required of public companies.

697
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:20,564
Will will will, Thank God, I was thinking
of sending out a search party.

698
00:54:20,914 --> 00:54:23,145
I'm sorry. I overslept.

699
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:24,909
You overslept.

700
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:27,569
The second great advantage is most of our
clients...

701
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:30,268
...are high-net-worth individuals
more concerned...

702
00:54:30,427 --> 00:54:33,396
...with preservation of capital than in
outsized gains in any single year...

703
00:54:33,922 --> 00:54:36,607
You all know
how to read a bar chart.

704
00:54:37,214 --> 00:54:40,019
What is important here
is putting your clients at ease.

705
00:54:40,743 --> 00:54:43,492
One of the things I suggest
going forward in this difficult time...

706
00:54:43,898 --> 00:54:46,053
...the credit crunch,
whatever you want to call it...

707
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:48,963
...is that they understand
that America is on sale.

708
00:54:49,428 --> 00:54:50,892
Excuse me, sir, your wife is here.

709
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:57,078
- It's Sharon.
- What about her?

710
00:54:57,762 --> 00:54:58,934
She's here.

711
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,726
Excuse me, Joe.

712
00:55:03,108 --> 00:55:06,416
At any rate, I want to make sure that
you can go with confidence and say...

713
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:24,879
Here's your wife, sir.

714
00:55:26,854 --> 00:55:29,352
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you woke up. I went to the spa.

715
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:30,662
What are you doing?

716
00:55:31,258 --> 00:55:32,816
I thought you'd need an excuse
to get out of there.

717
00:55:33,348 --> 00:55:34,781
- You wanna get some lunch?
- Lunch?

718
00:55:34,972 --> 00:55:37,517
Yeah, it's gorgeous outside.
I made a reservation...

719
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:37,999
Hey.

720
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:41,068
What do you think this is?

721
00:55:42,086 --> 00:55:43,166
The morning after.

722
00:55:44,301 --> 00:55:45,958
We didn't do anything last night.

723
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:48,619
You don't remember?

724
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,020
- Last night was perfect.
- Nothing happened!

725
00:55:52,326 --> 00:55:55,074
Baby, not so loud.
It'll cause a scene.

726
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,123
A scene?

727
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:59,026
Right. That's exactly what we need.

728
00:55:59,432 --> 00:56:01,509
- What are you doing?
- I wanna give you a scene.

729
00:56:02,153 --> 00:56:03,998
I'll take you into Joe and the rest
so you can tell them all that...

730
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:07,292
- Why ruin this?
- There is no "this."

731
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:08,587
Don't say that.

732
00:56:09,316 --> 00:56:10,642
Goddamn it, come here.

733
00:56:16,643 --> 00:56:18,310
What's wrong with you?

734
00:56:19,826 --> 00:56:21,736
Why are you acting like a stranger?

735
00:56:21,918 --> 00:56:25,927
That is exactly what I am to you, a
stranger, somebody you do not know.

736
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,544
Now either you go in there...

737
00:56:28,157 --> 00:56:31,318
...and you tell them your lies,
or you leave me the hell alone.

738
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:36,503
Don't you put this all on me, Derek.

739
00:56:36,954 --> 00:56:39,363
We both knew what we were getting
into from the very beginning.

740
00:56:39,785 --> 00:56:40,277
What?

741
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:42,482
The first time we met in the elevator.

742
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:45,079
Our dirty martini.

743
00:56:47,018 --> 00:56:48,252
The Christmas party.

744
00:56:48,813 --> 00:56:52,404
You said that you wished you were
single so that we could be together.

745
00:56:52,594 --> 00:56:53,413
No. No, I did not.

746
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:55,409
- You did! You said it!
- No! I did not!

747
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,296
Derek, you said it.

748
00:56:57,787 --> 00:56:58,632
You said it.

749
00:57:05,371 --> 00:57:08,038
If I go in that room and tell them,
it'll be the truth.

750
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,739
Is that what you want?

751
00:57:11,673 --> 00:57:14,188
You want me to tell them the truth?

752
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:19,204
Ready when you are.

753
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:21,072
Hey, hey.

754
00:57:23,966 --> 00:57:25,028
Listen to me!

755
00:57:26,752 --> 00:57:27,417
What are you doing?

756
00:57:27,946 --> 00:57:31,562
Hit me. You can do
anything you want to me.

757
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:35,702
You know what?

758
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:40,500
It doesn't matter what you do or what
you say or what goes on in that brain...

759
00:57:40,872 --> 00:57:43,807
...because there's never gonna be
anything between us, never.

760
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:45,940
Okay, Lisa?

761
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:46,574
Derek.

762
00:57:53,496 --> 00:57:54,093
Derek?

763
00:57:57,843 --> 00:57:58,726
Derek?

764
00:58:10,752 --> 00:58:12,345
I realise we went a little long.

765
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:14,888
I thought some of the questions you
raised were worth going over...

766
00:58:15,088 --> 00:58:16,927
...and I apologise for the length of it.

767
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:20,484
Those of you with tee times, and I
have one myself, we will still make...

768
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:22,962
Everything okay?

769
00:58:35,763 --> 00:58:37,713
- Top you off.
- Thank you.

770
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:40,633
- D?
- Oh, no, no, thanks.

771
00:58:40,954 --> 00:58:42,038
You're not drinking?

772
00:58:42,421 --> 00:58:44,983
No, not this evening, man.
I'm sticking to the iced tea.

773
00:58:48,534 --> 00:58:48,873
That's a first.

774
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:53,199
- You feeling all right?
- Yeah.

775
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:55,096
He's just growing up.

776
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:19,669
No goddamn way. Come on.
No. Hey. Hey, get up.

777
00:59:20,399 --> 00:59:21,613
Hey. Lisa.

778
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:25,308
Come on, get up, get up.
You can't stay here, come on

779
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:27,110
I will drag you out of this...

780
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,105
No. No, no, no.

781
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,441
I need a paramedic up here at 583.
I have a woman in the room.

782
00:59:41,608 --> 00:59:43,541
I think she's overdosed on some sort
of prescription pills.

783
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:45,858
Yeah, yeah. Hurry! Now, please!

784
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:46,882
Okay.

785
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:50,926
Breathe. Breathe.

786
00:59:52,643 --> 00:59:53,913
Bitch, breathe.

787
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,266
- Derek. What's going on?
- I'll call you.

788
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:22,738
Hello?

789
01:00:23,674 --> 01:00:25,169
Hi, Ben. It's Sharon.

790
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,771
Hi, Sharon, hi.

791
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,236
<i>I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>

792
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:32,323
I was trying to reach Derek,
and he usually calls me by now.

793
01:00:32,597 --> 01:00:33,661
I can't reach him on his cell phone.

794
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,930
I was hoping he might be with you?

795
01:00:40,895 --> 01:00:44,492
Yeah, there... There was
a kind of incident.

796
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:46,092
Is he all right?

797
01:00:49,337 --> 01:00:49,873
Ben?

798
01:00:51,019 --> 01:00:53,604
I think he should tell you himself.

799
01:00:55,137 --> 01:00:58,499
Ben, you're scaring me now.
Where is he?

800
01:01:04,645 --> 01:01:06,160
Excuse me. Is she okay?

801
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:08,051
The doctors are still working on her.

802
01:01:10,693 --> 01:01:14,628
Derek. Oh, my God. I've been worried
out of my mind. Are you okay?

803
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,734
What are you doing here? It's okay,
it's okay. I'm good, I'm good.

804
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:20,242
- Where's Kyle?
- Julie from the next door is watching him.

805
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:21,315
- What happened?
- Sharon.

806
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:23,486
Mr. Charles. How you doing?

807
01:01:23,652 --> 01:01:25,976
My name is Monica Reese.
I'm the investigating detective.

808
01:01:26,605 --> 01:01:28,956
- Detective?
- Yeah. This is my wife, Sharon.

809
01:01:29,172 --> 01:01:31,493
- She just got here.
- So you haven't told her?

810
01:01:31,535 --> 01:01:34,015
- Told me what?
- Would you prefer to talk in private?

811
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,965
- In private? What's happening, Derek?
- It's okay. Please, we can talk.

812
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:42,085
I've gone over the initial statement
you gave to the police on the scene.

813
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,449
I just need to clarify a few things,
okay?

814
01:01:45,189 --> 01:01:45,781
Let's sit down.

815
01:01:50,734 --> 01:01:54,820
Detective Reese, 0300 hours,
January 15th.

816
01:01:57,657 --> 01:02:00,603
This young woman, Lisa Sheridan,
she works in your office?

817
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:03,023
Lisa the temp?
What happened to her?

818
01:02:03,171 --> 01:02:04,452
Yeah, she tried to hurt herself.

819
01:02:04,623 --> 01:02:06,783
Why? What? Well, what did she do?

820
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:08,209
Mrs. Charles, I'm sorry.

821
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:11,096
I need to get the story
in your husband's own words.

822
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:13,223
Apparently, so do I.

823
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,274
Mr. Charles, this Lisa Sheridan...

824
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:18,044
Yeah, she worked with us
two weeks.

825
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,543
What, you've only known her
for two weeks?

826
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:22,659
Approximately two weeks.

827
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,296
Long enough for her to fantasize
that you two were having an affair?

828
01:02:26,188 --> 01:02:27,830
- What?
- No. No.

829
01:02:29,348 --> 01:02:31,546
She came on to me
at the Christmas party...

830
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:35,091
...and then in the parking garage.

831
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,883
And then she showed up
at the retreat...

832
01:02:39,598 --> 01:02:41,396
...at my hotel, and I rejected her.

833
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:43,812
And when... Excuse me.
And when you rejected her...

834
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:48,161
...she tried to commit suicide, naked,
in your bed, in your hotel room.

835
01:02:48,695 --> 01:02:52,282
Wait, wait, wait. She was naked
in your bed, Derek?

836
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,018
- Mrs. Charles.
- She was naked in your hotel room?

837
01:02:55,203 --> 01:02:55,866
Please.

838
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:59,364
- Mr. Charles, Would you say this affair was...
- There was no affair, Okay.

839
01:02:59,591 --> 01:03:00,675
There was no affair.

840
01:03:01,103 --> 01:03:04,131
You're saying she made the thing up
in her head with no help from you?

841
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:05,495
That is exactly what I'm saying.

842
01:03:06,638 --> 01:03:07,732
Why do you think she'd pick you?

843
01:03:08,857 --> 01:03:12,817
I don't know. Maybe I said something
that she took the wrong way.

844
01:03:13,184 --> 01:03:14,566
- Baby, come on.
- Like what? Like what?

845
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,044
What exactly did you say
that she took the wrong way, Derek?

846
01:03:18,306 --> 01:03:20,497
- I'm gonna have to ask you to le...
- No, no, she's not going anywhere.

847
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:24,797
I didn't say anything to her.
I did not lead her on.

848
01:03:25,494 --> 01:03:26,894
You had no idea she'd be
at the hotel?

849
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:28,774
I don't know how she got
in my room.

850
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,920
She told the hotel clerk she was your
wife and she wanted to surprise you.

851
01:03:33,857 --> 01:03:35,438
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Stop, Sharon.

852
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:36,927
- Did you have sex with her?
- No, I did not...

853
01:03:38,865 --> 01:03:40,004
...have sex with her.

854
01:03:41,713 --> 01:03:44,528
Sharon, come on. I need for you and I
not to fall apart right now.

855
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:46,033
- Mr. Charles. Please.
- Hold on.

856
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:51,658
Just stay here.
Please just stay here.

857
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:59,105
Look, I don't care if you're doing
this girl or not.

858
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:02,381
I'm not doing this girl, okay?
Never have.

859
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:03,784
- Okay.
- Okay.

860
01:04:06,629 --> 01:04:07,510
Detective?

861
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:09,643
It's the doctor. I'll be right back.

862
01:04:11,273 --> 01:04:11,767
Sharon.

863
01:04:12,857 --> 01:04:15,442
I swear to God
this is just a misunderstanding.

864
01:04:15,576 --> 01:04:16,363
A misunderstanding.

865
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,386
A girl tries to kill herself because of
you, it's just a misunderstanding?

866
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:22,789
Do you really think that
i'm gonna believe that bullshit?

867
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:24,439
- Do you believe me?
- No, I don't believe you!

868
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,604
- You didn't even call your son back...
- Sharon, listen.

869
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:29,089
Seems they pumped her out in time.

870
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:32,645
Probably tomorrow they'll take her
out of the ICU...

871
01:04:33,027 --> 01:04:36,066
...and take her up to the fifth floor
for psychiatric evaluation.

872
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:38,067
That's great news. Okay, thank you.

873
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:43,229
She was lucid enough to give a name
to the doctor in case of emergencies.

874
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:52,972
You still wanna stick to your story?

875
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,523
Sharon. Sharon,
you gonna talk to me?

876
01:05:52,909 --> 01:05:55,077
Thanks, Julie. I'll call you tomorrow.

877
01:05:55,812 --> 01:05:56,785
Sharon, is everything okay?

878
01:05:57,117 --> 01:05:59,007
Julie. Hey, thank you.

879
01:05:59,543 --> 01:05:59,890
Sharon.

880
01:06:03,863 --> 01:06:04,387
Sharon.

881
01:06:05,974 --> 01:06:06,507
Hey.

882
01:06:07,932 --> 01:06:08,725
Sharon.

883
01:06:10,598 --> 01:06:11,464
Can we talk?

884
01:06:13,191 --> 01:06:15,715
Sharon, I just... Now listen,
Sharon, all I wanna do...

885
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:19,319
What, what, what, Derek? What?
What do you want?

886
01:06:19,485 --> 01:06:21,469
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Now you wanna talk.

887
01:06:21,817 --> 01:06:24,002
- Sharon, you know me.
- No, I don't know you.

888
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:26,953
I don't know you. I know the Derek
that told me everything.

889
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:30,610
- Oh, come on.
- But you? I have no idea who you are.

890
01:06:30,762 --> 01:06:31,463
Sharon, I was wrong.

891
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:34,535
If I hadn't gone to the ER,
if I hadn't called Ben...

892
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:36,078
...would you have even told me about this?

893
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:37,661
What are you, crazy?
Of course I would have told you.

894
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:40,366
Oh! Yeah Like you told me
about the Christmas party, huh?

895
01:06:40,941 --> 01:06:42,665
Or what about the parking garage?

896
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:45,836
Yes, you told me about you being
in a parking garage with this woman.

897
01:06:46,391 --> 01:06:48,020
What else haven't you told me,
Derek?

898
01:06:48,377 --> 01:06:50,276
All I'm hearing
are things you haven't told me.

899
01:06:50,492 --> 01:06:52,205
I was wrong. I should've told you
the truth from the...

900
01:06:53,102 --> 01:06:54,670
You should have! Why didn't you?

901
01:06:54,946 --> 01:06:57,970
Because I didn't think
it was a big deal in the first place...

902
01:06:58,125 --> 01:06:59,581
...and then I was embarrassed.

903
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,800
- How do I say it without looking...?
- Guilty? Guilty?

904
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:08,069
I'm your wife, Derek. You're supposed
to trust me. You let this happen.

905
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:10,231
You think I encouraged this?

906
01:07:10,577 --> 01:07:14,919
Don't give me that innocent bullshit.
I was there at your desk. I saw you.

907
01:07:15,128 --> 01:07:17,587
I saw how you played games
and you played those girls...

908
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:20,034
...but you never did that to me.
Until now.

909
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:24,992
What is this? Is this about me
wanting to go to school?

910
01:07:25,525 --> 01:07:27,113
God, Sharon, it is not like that.

911
01:07:27,606 --> 01:07:29,955
This woman is sick, okay?
Nothing happened between...

912
01:07:30,392 --> 01:07:32,500
Do I ever ask you for anything?
I don't ask you for anything.

913
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:34,351
All I asked you was to be honest with me.

914
01:07:34,562 --> 01:07:36,010
- I told you the truth!
- No you didn't.

915
01:07:36,232 --> 01:07:37,385
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

916
01:07:38,992 --> 01:07:41,407
- I told you the truth.
- No, you didn't. You lied.

917
01:07:42,403 --> 01:07:44,007
We made a vow
on our wedding day...

918
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,279
...that we would tell each other
everything.

919
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:51,384
No matter how ugly
or uncomfortable it might be.

920
01:07:53,705 --> 01:07:56,257
I specifically asked you,
"Did anything happen at that party?"

921
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:57,923
And what did you tell me?

922
01:07:58,494 --> 01:07:59,709
- You said no.
- I know.

923
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:02,511
- I don't know what to believe right now.
- Okay.

924
01:08:03,006 --> 01:08:03,492
Hey, hey, hey.

925
01:08:03,678 --> 01:08:06,859
I think I need to be alone.
I think I need to be alone.

926
01:08:07,122 --> 01:08:08,723
Stop, stop, stop. Okay?

927
01:08:08,962 --> 01:08:10,605
Come on. Sharon. Please?

928
01:08:11,936 --> 01:08:14,071
- Sharon, come on.
- Get out of my house!

929
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,198
This is crazy, Sharon!
Don't you see what's happening?

930
01:08:17,347 --> 01:08:19,184
Get out of my house.

931
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:27,890
Nothing happened with this...

932
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:32,773
Okay. You know what?

933
01:08:33,446 --> 01:08:36,764
You just tell me what you want me
to do and that's what I'll do!

934
01:08:37,418 --> 01:08:38,963
Well, first, I suggest you pack
your toothbrush.

935
01:08:39,696 --> 01:08:42,706
Then I want you to get your socks,
your shaving kit, your underwear...

936
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:45,055
...your prophylactics, if
you need them, and get your ass out!

937
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:47,058
- And go where, Sharon?
- To hell.

938
01:08:48,837 --> 01:08:51,301
But until then,
I suggest maybe the Four Seasons.

939
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:58,461
Sharon!

940
01:09:13,558 --> 01:09:14,386
Miss Sheridan?

941
01:09:16,074 --> 01:09:18,865
Hey, I'm Monica Reese.
I'm a detective assigned to your case.

942
01:09:19,665 --> 01:09:21,051
- Come in.
- Thanks.

943
01:09:24,283 --> 01:09:25,521
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

944
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:28,327
They won't let me take a shower
or wash my hair.

945
01:09:29,549 --> 01:09:31,426
Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.

946
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:36,977
So you feel like talking
about the other night?

947
01:09:39,063 --> 01:09:40,383
Have you spoken to Derek?

948
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:41,198
Yeah.

949
01:09:42,363 --> 01:09:43,648
And he's all right?

950
01:09:44,365 --> 01:09:45,803
Relatively speaking.

951
01:09:46,647 --> 01:09:47,956
When can I see him?

952
01:09:48,692 --> 01:09:51,138
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

953
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:53,922
- Why?
- Miss, I don't mean to upset you...

954
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:57,561
...but I don't think Mr. Charles
wants to speak to you...

955
01:09:57,771 --> 01:10:00,544
...or continue any kind of contact.

956
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,529
Then why did he send me these?

957
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,427
He sent you flowers?

958
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:12,297
Lilies. My favourite.

959
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:13,871
Beautiful.

960
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,140
Yeah

961
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:26,602
Miss Sheridan, could you tell me
what happened at the hotel?

962
01:10:27,249 --> 01:10:29,128
- Why you were there?
- Didn't Derek tell you?

963
01:10:29,307 --> 01:10:32,299
Yeah, but I'd really like
to get your version.

964
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:35,228
Well, there's not much to tell.

965
01:10:37,021 --> 01:10:40,166
He asked me to meet him
at the hotel.

966
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:41,424
And you agreed?

967
01:10:42,258 --> 01:10:43,460
Of course.

968
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:45,485
And then what happened?

969
01:10:46,383 --> 01:10:48,851
I think you can guess what we did.

970
01:10:49,758 --> 01:10:51,896
Yeah. You... You slept together.

971
01:10:52,113 --> 01:10:53,238
Yes.

972
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:56,101
Well, Derek denies it, so...

973
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:00,329
He's just trying to protect me.

974
01:11:01,297 --> 01:11:02,434
He's being a gentleman.

975
01:11:03,265 --> 01:11:03,771
Right.

976
01:11:04,716 --> 01:11:09,841
The next day, he told me that his wife
wouldn't give him a divorce.

977
01:11:10,814 --> 01:11:12,537
You know the kind of woman
that will never let go?

978
01:11:12,691 --> 01:11:12,951
Yeah.

979
01:11:14,696 --> 01:11:16,649
Then he said
that we couldn't see each other.

980
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,318
I overreacted.

981
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:23,505
I didn't realise at the time
that he was just being noble.

982
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,869
Noble? What do you mean, "noble"?

983
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:30,141
He was thinking about his little boy,
Kyle.

984
01:11:31,138 --> 01:11:32,580
What the break-up would do to him.

985
01:11:35,178 --> 01:11:37,552
Lisa. Can I call you Lisa?

986
01:11:38,396 --> 01:11:39,218
Yeah.

987
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:42,201
How would you, you know...

988
01:11:42,547 --> 01:11:45,688
...characterise your relationship
with Derek?

989
01:11:46,912 --> 01:11:48,626
- Lovers.
- Yeah, I got that.

990
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:53,327
But I mean, do you really believe
he's in love with you?

991
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:55,359
I'm not a home wrecker.

992
01:11:57,525 --> 01:12:01,417
Monica, I'm not stealing him away.
Their marriage is over.

993
01:12:04,832 --> 01:12:07,933
I do feel bad about his wife, though.

994
01:12:08,566 --> 01:12:09,749
Well, how so?

995
01:12:10,513 --> 01:12:11,905
Well, it can't be easy...

996
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,430
...to find out that your husband's
in love with someone else.

997
01:12:15,835 --> 01:12:16,645
Right.

998
01:12:18,558 --> 01:12:20,856
I just hope that she doesn't do
something stupid.

999
01:12:23,587 --> 01:12:26,261
I don't have to tell you the impact
this could have on the company.

1000
01:12:26,436 --> 01:12:29,441
- Even a whiff of impropriety.
- Impropriety. There is no impropriety!

1001
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:32,561
This is just a sick fantasy
from a very disturbed girl.

1002
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:35,361
Who might retaliate
with a sexual harassment lawsuit.

1003
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:37,466
I was the one
who was sexually harassed.

1004
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:40,715
I can't believe this is happening
to me. This is like a nightmare.

1005
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:42,448
By now you're probably wishing
you had banged her.

1006
01:12:43,368 --> 01:12:44,862
Goddamn it, Joe!

1007
01:12:46,944 --> 01:12:51,032
Derek, calm down. I believe you,
and I'll back you all the way on this.

1008
01:12:51,197 --> 01:12:52,674
If we find out
there was something going on...

1009
01:12:53,073 --> 01:12:55,026
That's not gonna happen.
There's nothing to find out.

1010
01:12:55,192 --> 01:12:57,518
Good. Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

1011
01:12:59,538 --> 01:13:02,527
- I'm putting Ben on the Ganz account.
- No. Ganz is my client...

1012
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:03,930
- Look...
- No, Joe.

1013
01:13:04,216 --> 01:13:05,394
I'm not losing my client over this.

1014
01:13:06,026 --> 01:13:08,943
Take a little time off, just until
this blows over. Focus on Sharon.

1015
01:13:12,895 --> 01:13:13,922
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1016
01:13:14,441 --> 01:13:16,098
Derek, there's a Detective Reese here
to see you.

1017
01:13:18,523 --> 01:13:20,776
<i>Come on.
You think I sent her flowers?</i>

1018
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:24,755
My assistant has all my personal
information in his computer.

1019
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:28,218
She must have accessed them
when she temped for me.

1020
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:35,335
This is Lisa's journal.
It's a sort of diary, I guess...

1021
01:13:35,863 --> 01:13:37,589
...that she was keeping.
- Okay.

1022
01:13:37,915 --> 01:13:40,480
It's a rather graphic
and detailed account...

1023
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,138
...of your various sexual liaisons
together.

1024
01:13:44,325 --> 01:13:46,101
- My what?
- I have to warn you, it's...

1025
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:54,620
"We..."

1026
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:03,045
This is bullshit.

1027
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:06,352
None of this happened.
I've never been to her apartment.

1028
01:14:06,695 --> 01:14:08,156
I've never touched her.
none of that happened.

1029
01:14:08,363 --> 01:14:12,271
Well, according to these entries,
you are quite the accomplished lover.

1030
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:15,524
Oh, and apparently,
you made some promises to her.

1031
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:17,975
promises to divorce your wife...

1032
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:19,041
Okay, detective.

1033
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:21,942
You seem smart.

1034
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:25,061
You can't possibly believe that.

1035
01:14:25,321 --> 01:14:28,323
Look, the only thing that matters
is that she believes this.

1036
01:14:29,091 --> 01:14:32,663
So there has to be something I can do
to protect myself, right? My family?

1037
01:14:32,828 --> 01:14:34,924
Sure.
You could file a restraining order.

1038
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:35,985
Let's do that.

1039
01:14:36,618 --> 01:14:38,540
- But that might not be necessary.
- Why not?

1040
01:14:38,747 --> 01:14:41,376
Because Lisa's sister flew down
from San Francisco...

1041
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:43,192
...and took Lisa back with her
earlier today.

1042
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:50,636
I can't say I'm unhappy to hear that.

1043
01:14:52,074 --> 01:14:53,897
Maybe now she'll get the help
that she needs.

1044
01:16:40,431 --> 01:16:42,498
You ready? Let's go for it.

1045
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:47,472
- Hey.
- Kyle. Hey, baby.

1046
01:17:05,811 --> 01:17:07,292
It's my birthday next week.

1047
01:17:09,602 --> 01:17:11,098
Happy birthday.

1048
01:17:13,594 --> 01:17:15,637
Sharon, are you gonna make me
spend my birthday alone?

1049
01:17:22,307 --> 01:17:23,829
Have dinner with me?

1050
01:17:26,985 --> 01:17:28,363
Come on, Sharon.

1051
01:17:31,132 --> 01:17:32,918
Move your foot, Derek.

1052
01:18:03,251 --> 01:18:04,644
What do you think?

1053
01:18:05,984 --> 01:18:06,782
Be honest.

1054
01:18:13,176 --> 01:18:15,628
Derek, your menu. Your menu.

1055
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:17,279
- Oh, my menu, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1056
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:24,672
Sharon, this means a lot to me.

1057
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:28,314
I missed you.

1058
01:18:28,494 --> 01:18:32,289
And, I don't know, there's just so much
I wanna tell you.

1059
01:18:32,634 --> 01:18:34,428
It's your party, birthday boy.

1060
01:18:40,231 --> 01:18:41,813
You look beautiful.

1061
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:44,862
I love you.

1062
01:18:45,993 --> 01:18:47,839
Sharon, I just wanna be home.

1063
01:18:48,898 --> 01:18:50,544
Okay, it's been three months.

1064
01:18:50,821 --> 01:18:56,097
And I'll do whatever it takes to fix this,
to make us work again...

1065
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:58,778
...your studies, you and Kyle,
I mean...

1066
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:01,245
...you name it, I'll do it.

1067
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,377
I got you something.

1068
01:19:15,058 --> 01:19:16,493
- Should I just...?
- No.

1069
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:20,257
Let's see how
the rest of the evening goes.

1070
01:19:22,247 --> 01:19:24,492
<i>And welcome to "Fact or Fiction."</i>

1071
01:19:26,309 --> 01:19:30,427
<i>I'm your host, Rod Bak er.</i>

1072
01:19:32,118 --> 01:19:39,483
<i>And on today's show, let's welcome
back our champion, Bunny!</i>

1073
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,944
Hi. I'm Sharon's friend, Kate.

1074
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,958
You're...?

1075
01:19:53,336 --> 01:19:56,222
Samantha. Mrs. Charles is at dinner.

1076
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:59,149
Sharon told me to drop by.
I have this present for Kyle.

1077
01:19:59,702 --> 01:20:00,955
I'm just gonna run it up to him.

1078
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:02,746
Oh, you can't, he's sleeping.

1079
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:03,967
I won't wake him.

1080
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,811
Maybe you should come back
another time.

1081
01:20:05,986 --> 01:20:07,000
But I'm here now.

1082
01:20:07,612 --> 01:20:08,886
I...

1083
01:20:10,128 --> 01:20:12,472
I get it, you're just doing your job.
Good.

1084
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:15,566
Do you need me to call Sharon?

1085
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:17,161
Yeah.

1086
01:20:17,735 --> 01:20:18,578
Okay.

1087
01:20:27,335 --> 01:20:29,720
Sharon. Hey, it's Kate.

1088
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:33,656
Where am I? I'm at your house,
of course. You told me to drop by.

1089
01:20:35,074 --> 01:20:36,324
She forgot.

1090
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,320
No, Samantha just wanted me
to give you a call.

1091
01:20:39,507 --> 01:20:41,136
She was a little bit concerned.

1092
01:20:41,631 --> 01:20:44,900
No. No, no, no.
Don't be upset with her.

1093
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:48,392
No, God, come on,
she was just doing her job.

1094
01:20:49,939 --> 01:20:52,755
Great. All right, have an
amazing dinner. Tell Derek I said hi.

1095
01:20:53,469 --> 01:20:54,672
Oh, Sharon, hold on.

1096
01:20:55,115 --> 01:20:56,698
Do you need to talk to her?

1097
01:20:56,887 --> 01:20:58,383
No, no, I'm fine.

1098
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:02,198
All right, I'll catch up with you
in the morning. Bye, honey.

1099
01:21:03,306 --> 01:21:04,829
I'll be back in a sec.

1100
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:06,767
Yeah.

1101
01:21:25,221 --> 01:21:29,225
Sharon, you know,
I miss you and I love you...

1102
01:21:29,415 --> 01:21:31,739
...and I know that you miss me too.

1103
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:37,546
I do miss you, but I don't know
if that's enough.

1104
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:46,764
We're not talking about divorce,
right?

1105
01:21:47,112 --> 01:21:49,193
I don't come from a family of divorce.

1106
01:21:49,794 --> 01:21:52,878
Mom and Dad'll be celebrating their
30th anniversary in three months.

1107
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:56,024
I look at them and I wonder
if that can ever be us.

1108
01:21:56,302 --> 01:21:59,035
It is us. It can be us, will be us.

1109
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,308
I need you to understand
that nothing happened with that girl.

1110
01:22:15,992 --> 01:22:19,418
I know I should've been honest
with you from the beginning...

1111
01:22:20,588 --> 01:22:21,792
...and I wasn't.

1112
01:22:23,426 --> 01:22:25,186
And that will never happen again.

1113
01:22:26,403 --> 01:22:27,605
But I love you.

1114
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:31,632
I mean, I love you with all my heart,
and I love my son too.

1115
01:22:38,707 --> 01:22:40,272
I guess Kyle does miss his daddy.

1116
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:43,592
Does Sharon... miss Daddy?

1117
01:22:45,758 --> 01:22:47,663
I will do anything, anything.

1118
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:51,595
- Anything?
- You name it.

1119
01:22:55,021 --> 01:22:57,566
Oh, I guess the evening's
going good.

1120
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:03,150
What about the Benz?

1121
01:23:04,956 --> 01:23:06,940
- The Benz.
- My Benz?

1122
01:23:07,138 --> 01:23:10,317
I just... Oh, yes.
I got that key right here.

1123
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,270
You know, it's...

1124
01:23:18,106 --> 01:23:19,383
Missed you.

1125
01:23:34,839 --> 01:23:35,834
See you later!

1126
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:37,470
You too!

1127
01:23:53,269 --> 01:23:54,679
Okay, it works, it works.

1128
01:23:54,951 --> 01:23:56,385
Welcome home, baby.

1129
01:23:58,205 --> 01:23:59,458
You driving my car.

1130
01:23:59,642 --> 01:24:01,786
- You guys got back so fast.
- Hey.

1131
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:03,517
Any trouble with Kyle?

1132
01:24:03,716 --> 01:24:06,507
No, he was a doll.
But you just missed your friend.

1133
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:09,194
- What friend?
- You know, your friend Kate?

1134
01:24:09,367 --> 01:24:10,203
I don't know a Kate.

1135
01:24:10,382 --> 01:24:12,237
She was here.
She had something for Kyle.

1136
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:13,823
Oh, my God! Where's Kyle?

1137
01:24:14,118 --> 01:24:15,805
- His crib.
- Somebody was inside the house?

1138
01:24:15,982 --> 01:24:17,593
- Yeah.
- How long were they here for?

1139
01:24:17,755 --> 01:24:21,714
Just a few minutes. What's wrong?
You said it was okay!

1140
01:24:21,894 --> 01:24:22,857
Kyle?

1141
01:24:24,797 --> 01:24:25,785
She took my baby.

1142
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:28,275
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1143
01:24:29,917 --> 01:24:30,782
What happened
tell me what happened?

1144
01:24:30,928 --> 01:24:32,885
She said she had something for Kyle
and then she left.

1145
01:24:33,743 --> 01:24:35,248
She left? Kyle's not in his room!

1146
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:37,829
Call 911! Now!

1147
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:39,560
Kyle?

1148
01:24:48,965 --> 01:24:49,349
Kyle?

1149
01:24:51,103 --> 01:24:53,328
Kyle? Son?

1150
01:24:58,465 --> 01:24:59,322
Kyle!

1151
01:25:12,985 --> 01:25:14,348
Kyle, oh.

1152
01:25:16,773 --> 01:25:19,923
She couldn't have got far.
She couldn't have got far.

1153
01:25:32,514 --> 01:25:34,511
We'll wait for the blood work.
It appears he's completely fine.

1154
01:25:34,824 --> 01:25:36,940
I don't see any reason why you can't
take him home in a couple of hours.

1155
01:25:37,362 --> 01:25:38,730
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

1156
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:43,917
Hey.

1157
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,203
How's he doing?

1158
01:25:46,735 --> 01:25:48,039
Doctor says he's fine.

1159
01:25:48,387 --> 01:25:52,006
Well, I'm not fine.
She was in our house.

1160
01:25:52,626 --> 01:25:54,714
And now our son
is in a hospital bed.

1161
01:25:55,069 --> 01:25:57,321
I thought you said she was in San Francisco.
Why is she back?

1162
01:25:57,516 --> 01:25:58,810
And how did she even know
we'd be out?

1163
01:25:59,215 --> 01:26:00,967
Obviously she was watching
your house.

1164
01:26:01,452 --> 01:26:02,298
We need you to find her.

1165
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:04,782
I will do everything in my power
to find her.

1166
01:26:05,233 --> 01:26:07,094
One of you better do something
about this woman.

1167
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,826
Or I will.

1168
01:26:14,139 --> 01:26:15,348
So, what am I supposed to do now?

1169
01:26:15,819 --> 01:26:16,623
- Buy a gun?
- Please.

1170
01:26:17,426 --> 01:26:18,664
We'll have our unit tracking her.

1171
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:21,473
In the meantime, you better beef up
your security system.

1172
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:24,657
She could have hurt my son.
My son.

1173
01:26:46,471 --> 01:26:47,739
Okay. You don't wanna go to sleep?

1174
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,416
- Kyle. It's okay, baby.
- It's okay.

1175
01:26:53,281 --> 01:26:54,876
Oh, no.

1176
01:26:55,846 --> 01:26:58,629
Oh, no. God.

1177
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:02,683
This psycho.

1178
01:27:03,993 --> 01:27:05,366
She never left.

1179
01:27:17,547 --> 01:27:20,123
Yeah, I need to speak
to Detective Reese immediately.

1180
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:22,875
My name, Derek Charles.

1181
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:24,394
Yeah, she knows me.

1182
01:27:25,493 --> 01:27:27,457
This is an emergency.
I need to speak to her.

1183
01:27:27,661 --> 01:27:31,525
<i>Hi, it's Lisa, sorry you missed me.
Leave me a message after the beep.</i>

1184
01:27:33,354 --> 01:27:36,688
You listen to me.
You know exactly who this is.

1185
01:27:37,716 --> 01:27:41,366
You came into my house,
you touched my child...

1186
01:27:42,525 --> 01:27:44,088
...and you think you're crazy?

1187
01:27:44,933 --> 01:27:46,723
I'll show you crazy.

1188
01:27:47,486 --> 01:27:49,627
Just try me, bitch!

1189
01:27:53,276 --> 01:27:56,281
You're set. You ready for me
to show you how the system works?

1190
01:27:56,491 --> 01:27:57,690
Definitely.

1191
01:28:01,793 --> 01:28:02,218
Simple.

1192
01:28:02,832 --> 01:28:04,891
You just punch in your code,
now it's armed.

1193
01:28:06,306 --> 01:28:09,091
Case of an emergency,
this is the panic button.

1194
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,564
You touch this,
the police are knocking at your door.

1195
01:28:13,176 --> 01:28:14,421
There's also one in your master.

1196
01:29:34,803 --> 01:29:36,035
Okay, so you packed everything?

1197
01:29:36,842 --> 01:29:37,669
What time you taking off?

1198
01:29:38,155 --> 01:29:40,507
This afternoon after I pick Kyle up
from my sister's.

1199
01:29:42,528 --> 01:29:44,316
- Okay, well, drive safely.
- Okay.

1200
01:29:44,478 --> 01:29:45,952
- I'll be there in the morning.
- All right.

1201
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:48,199
- Set the alarm.
- You don't have to tell me.

1202
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:49,661
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1203
01:29:51,739 --> 01:29:52,309
Bye.

1204
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:02,566
Derek Charles's office.

1205
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:03,853
<i>Patrick.</i>

1206
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:07,202
Lisa? Oh, my God, it's been forever.

1207
01:30:07,754 --> 01:30:09,163
What, like six months?

1208
01:30:09,502 --> 01:30:11,951
<i>I know. We've got a lot of gossip
to catch up on.</i>

1209
01:30:12,748 --> 01:30:15,712
Well, I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I could get fired.

1210
01:30:16,832 --> 01:30:18,464
<i>Trust me, you're not getting fired.</i>

1211
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:20,383
What do you mean?

1212
01:30:20,589 --> 01:30:21,951
<i>Derek didn't tell you.</i>

1213
01:30:23,385 --> 01:30:24,388
Tell me what?

1214
01:30:25,232 --> 01:30:27,132
<i>He's leaving Sharon.
They're getting a divorce.</i>

1215
01:30:27,064 --> 01:30:29,528
<i>- A divorce?
- Lik e that's a surprise.</i>

1216
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:33,013
Look, that's not gonna happen, Lisa.

1217
01:30:33,402 --> 01:30:35,597
<i>Patrick, come on.
I know what I'm talking about.</i>

1218
01:30:35,866 --> 01:30:39,650
Then why are they driving to San
Diego for her parents 33 anniversary?

1219
01:30:40,231 --> 01:30:41,366
<i>Derek's not going.</i>

1220
01:30:41,878 --> 01:30:43,669
Yeah, actually, he is.

1221
01:30:44,145 --> 01:30:47,740
Sharon's leaving this afternoon,
Derek's driving down in the morning.

1222
01:30:49,539 --> 01:30:51,604
Lisa? Did you hear me?

1223
01:30:51,861 --> 01:30:52,764
<i>Patrick, I have to go.</i>

1224
01:30:52,941 --> 01:30:54,364
No, you just called.

1225
01:31:30,042 --> 01:31:30,760
My purse.

1226
01:32:38,971 --> 01:32:40,355
Joe needs these by 5.

1227
01:32:41,535 --> 01:32:43,472
- Yeah. Sharon's on one.
- Okay.

1228
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:49,433
- Hey.
- Hey, baby, I just left the house.

1229
01:32:50,015 --> 01:32:52,191
- Okay, good. You set the alarm?
- The ala...

1230
01:32:52,983 --> 01:32:54,482
Oh, God, I forgot.

1231
01:32:55,055 --> 01:32:57,205
Don't worry. I'm gonna get out soon.
I'll do it.

1232
01:32:57,391 --> 01:33:01,163
No. I'm just down the hill. I'll swing
back around, and I'll call you after.

1233
01:33:01,355 --> 01:33:03,360
Hey. Call me back.

1234
01:35:07,015 --> 01:35:08,550
Did you not get my message?

1235
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:12,421
I'm so sorry. We didn't want you
to find out this way.

1236
01:35:14,374 --> 01:35:15,630
I knew it would come to this.

1237
01:35:16,135 --> 01:35:20,501
I know how hard it must be to have
someone fall out of love with you.

1238
01:35:21,962 --> 01:35:22,875
I know.

1239
01:35:26,035 --> 01:35:28,019
You are completely delusional.

1240
01:35:29,408 --> 01:35:31,399
I'm gonna have the cops
deal with your crazy ass.

1241
01:35:31,913 --> 01:35:33,874
- Wait, it doesn't...
- Don't touch me.

1242
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:39,511
- We can talk.
- I told you, don't touch me!

1243
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:48,753
Crazy!

1244
01:35:49,824 --> 01:35:51,746
Get off of me!

1245
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:19,465
<i>You have reached the Charles Residence
please wait for the beep.</i>

1246
01:36:19,842 --> 01:36:20,497
Sharon.

1247
01:36:21,648 --> 01:36:22,411
Are you there?

1248
01:36:27,476 --> 01:36:28,653
- Derek.
- Lisa?

1249
01:36:28,836 --> 01:36:30,297
<i>What are you doing in my house?</i>

1250
01:36:31,844 --> 01:36:33,396
Sharon.

1251
01:36:34,056 --> 01:36:34,906
Sharon?

1252
01:36:37,095 --> 01:36:39,466
Derek, I'm gonna call you back.

1253
01:36:47,223 --> 01:36:49,776
I need to speak to Detective
Reese, right now, please.

1254
01:36:49,955 --> 01:36:51,804
Yeah. No, it's an emergency.

1255
01:36:53,698 --> 01:36:54,918
Come here, bitch.

1256
01:36:56,530 --> 01:36:58,363
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with your little skinny ass.

1257
01:36:59,121 --> 01:37:01,719
Oh, you want to hold on?
You screaming now, huh?

1258
01:37:09,856 --> 01:37:11,055
Come here!

1259
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:13,600
Didn't I tell you not
to come to my house?

1260
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:16,672
Nobody touches my child.

1261
01:37:53,438 --> 01:37:54,812
Come on. Come here!

1262
01:40:13,277 --> 01:40:14,401
Come on, this what you want?

1263
01:40:15,057 --> 01:40:15,657
Come on.

1264
01:40:30,999 --> 01:40:32,105
Come a little closer.

1265
01:40:34,326 --> 01:40:35,194
You almost got it, come on.

1266
01:40:36,077 --> 01:40:37,131
Come on.

1267
01:40:45,801 --> 01:40:47,497
You want some of me?
You almost got me.

1268
01:40:53,308 --> 01:40:54,538
Come on, bitch.

1269
01:41:25,782 --> 01:41:26,589
Take my hand.

1270
01:41:27,294 --> 01:41:28,537
Come on, take my hand.

1271
01:41:31,588 --> 01:41:32,538
I got you.

1272
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:40,541
Come on, come on.

1273
01:41:44,909 --> 01:41:46,452
Crazy bitch.

1274
01:42:03,598 --> 01:42:04,732
Get off of me.

1275
01:42:39,969 --> 01:42:41,557
Oh, God.

1276
01:43:10,115 --> 01:43:11,729
Oh, God.

1277
01:44:00,678 --> 01:44:02,032
Sharon? You all right?

1278
01:44:04,419 --> 01:44:05,502
What happened here?

1279
01:44:06,016 --> 01:44:07,615
I think you know what happened.

1280
01:44:09,721 --> 01:44:10,990
Stay here.

1281
01:44:13,211 --> 01:44:15,269
- Oh, baby.
- You okay?

1282
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:19,110
- It's over.
- It's over.
