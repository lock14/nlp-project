Hi Mom!
Oh hi! Oh I missed you!

Take it off. I'll fix it.
There you go, put that on.

Ok, sit down, sit down right here.
The light is perfect, sit down.
Ok now, smile.
Just like that.
No, not like that - like that.
You... are so handsome when you smile.
- So how's everything?
- Great.
Good... Better
What's this? No, no, that is, Joanna,
I appreciate it, but thank you.
Come on, John.
Don't leave me hurt you.
No, you guys have done enough already.
- John, take it. Take it. Ok.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
(TV: We come to the lines across the eyes...)
Mary, look who's here.
- Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Oh gosh... Hi!
- Look at that, it's so beautiful.
- No, it's not.
It's only my, uhm, my third television class:
I'm learning portraits.
- Well it's beautiful.
- Thank you. - You're welcome.
- Thank you for taking care of my baby.
- Well of course. You know I thought
about keeping him, but I think he, uh,... 
got sick of me
catching all the fish, huh?
Besides, I think you would have missed him. 
- Yeah.
You have to go?
- I do. I do, yeah, I've got that 4 o'clock
meeting... - I'll Say goodbye.
- I can make you that sandwich. 
It's a very important meeting.
- Take that off.
- Or maybe you want to come back.
- Oh no Honey, I wish I could but I really can't.
I've got a 7 o'clock flight,
so I probably should hit the road. 
Oh yeah, 'cause we could visit...
- I'd love the visits.
Are you ok? 
- I'm fine.
- Ok. ok.
Do you want me to make you 
something for the road?
- Oh no, I'm fine.
I didn't realise she'd called you guys again.
Let me go and talk to her. Sorry guys...
It's still happening, isn't it?
The doctors have her on new medication.
She's getting better.
Go to bed.
I made Chris meatloaf sandwiches for 
tomorrow. He loves meatloaf sandwiches.
Did they check for footprints 
underneath the window.
Yes, they checked.
You are sure... no footprints.
Yes, I am sure there's no footprints.
Ok.
- So're you glad you're back?
- Yeah, but there's fish everywhere in Alaska.
And you're not going to believe 
what we use for bait. - What?
- Fish eggs. They smell nasty. 
- Not as bad as that squid we used.
- Worse: my cousin Ally got scared, 
so she threw it away. 
- Oh my gosh!
Hu-huh! Hey, I've got to tell you something.
Your shoe's untied.
Got ya! No, seriously, your shoe's are untied.
Hey, I'll see ya at lunch, man. 
- Ok, see ya!
Sorry! I didn't mean to startle you.
Bye, Honey! 
They were just working on the brakes and it 
all messed up! I love you Honey Bear. Bye!
Parents!
What's with the friggin Mamba music?  
It ain't Mamba, it's Rigatone.
If you don't like it, get your own radio.
- Hoya Johnny! 
- Oh yea Hector! 
What do you think, bro?
What?! The boat or the house?
- Both, you dopey bastard!
- Beautiful! Congratulations!
Thank you! Thank you! I just got it. 
I'm putting a dock in, right where
you're standing. It's going to be great! 
Oh yep! I'm inviting you and your whole 
family out for the housewarming.
- It's going to be granendo party!
- You bet!
How's Mary?
Actually, I want to talk 
to you about that.
Remember the thing we talked about last
month? Wondered if I could get that?
Mary's doctor's bills are piling up and...
...a few dollars more a week could really
bail us out. - I know, I know, the interest 
rates are really killing me.
Give me a couple a weeks: I'm gonna move some
things around: and I'm gonna take care of it.
Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of it.
Johnny! You're my best guy!
Whoo! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Right in the ear!
Hey you want to play some b-ball after school?
- Er, sure.
Where's my baby?!
Where's my son?! 
Hughh! Chris! Hi, Honey, are you ok? 
Are you ok, Honey? Are you ok?
- I'm fine! - Are you sure? 
- Yeah! - Ok, my baby.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Ok... Chris, wait.
- You're ok really.
- I'm fine, ok!
- I was worried about you.
- I'm O-O-K!
I was worried you might not come home.
Chris, Chris. Wait.
I was just worried. 
- Want more gravy?
- No.
- Can I ride my bike to school tomorrow?
- Ha! In this heat? - Dad!
- Mommy worries a lot.
- Why don't you drop him off.
- On your way to work.
- Well yeah, sure: I'll take you.
Hey, there's a boatshow this weekend.  
Maybe we can all go, ok? 
- Why don't you take Chris?
- Oh! Er, I was hoping the way you love boats...
...maybe we could all go. ...Ok?
Hold on.
Where're you going, man? 
Hi! Need a ride?
Come on, get in.
Come on!
- You can drop me off here.
- Is this your house?
- No, it's some ways to walk, but it's fine.
- It's alright, where is it?
- It's ok, really.
- Don't be silly! Which one?
That one.
There you go.
- Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome. 
- Bye, Chris. - Bye.
- Hi. How was school?
- Fine. What are you doing?
I fixed your shirt.
See: I used another shirt to cover the hole.
- But Mom, that was my favourite shirt!
- It's ok Chris. It's not bad.
- It doesn't always have to... match.
- Yes it does. It looks weird!
- Ok, I'll fix it. Is that what you want?
- Just forget it, it's ruined. 
No, then let me ask you this...
- If she had a heart attack or breast cancer,
- I don't! - ...you'd cover that, no problem.  
And if she had Dean Martin's liver, then what?
What would you do then? 
- What would you, er... send over 
- A Martini set. - A Martini set.
It's an illness. A mental illness.
- No it's not.
- She has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
- Stop telling them that!
Physical, mental: what's the difference?
- Then tell me why?
- Because I'm not crazy, that's why.
No, you tell me why.
- Why her illness is not covered on my HMO.
- I'm fine, I'm fine, I don't know how many
times a day, I have to tell you I'm fine.
I don't need medicine.
- No, no, I'm not talking about...
- I don't know why you're telling them
I need any medicine. I don't want it, 
I don't need it, ok? 
Yeah. Fine.
Why do you do that? Why do you dou...
I don't care. I don't like you calling people in
the Government and telling them all kinds of
things about me or the FBI to know my business...
- Don't answer it!
- What? Who? 
Oh Sam, hi, sorry, yes...
- Err , Chris! Phone!
- I got it!
- Dad, hey Dad. - Yeah.
- Sam says I can sleep over. Can I go?
- Yeah, sure. - Thanks.
Come here, come here. Come here.
- Yeah. - Come here. 
When're you gonna go, tonight? 
- Yeah.
- Who else is gonna be there? 
- Uhmm, Sam's parents.
No, no. Now maybe you should stay home with
me tonight. I'll make cookies. - Mom...
- Chris, maybe Mommy's right.
- But I want to go.
- Don't you have homework to do? 
- I did it already. Seriously.
- Chris, just maybe you should stay home.
- Why?!
Because, it's not safe for you to go over
there, that's why: it's not safe, not safe,
tell him it's not safe!
- But you promised. It's Friday night.
- Drop it!
I hate you! I wish I never came home!
- It's ok. What we're doing is right!
- Now take it easy, ok.
Honey. - It's not safe over there! 
- He's not going.
No, no, you don't.
Go away.
Just go away.
Please, get out of the rain. Mary, Honey,
please get out of the rain. It's ok.
- I want to leave. I want to go
 away to the other Florida.
- There's only one Florida, Mary.
Right, come on, get in the house.
It's too wet for you. Get in the 
house, Honey. 
Why don't you take your medication?
- Argh, I don't need the medicine!
Chris, back in the house.
No, no. You are going to jail.
You are!
I'm not going to jail! You are!
I'm not going to do that.
- I don't want to go to my room!!
- Mary, don't you... don't...
- I'm not doing anything.
- No, you're not... I know you're not.
Do you hear what they say? 
Do you hear it? 
The hook-up is...
- No... stay here.
The hook-up is out here..
- I will not do that.
You'll be safe in the house.
Inside the house it's safe.
- I don't want to do this.
- Let's get you in there.
- I'm not going to. - I know.
- It's not safe. I'm not going to.
Mary! What are you doing?!
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Mary!! - I don't want to lay down, 
I want to fight it! That's what I 
want to do. I don't want to stop it.
- What?! What?! What?!
- They're listening. They've wired
the house! Argh!
- What're you doing?!
- Leave me alone!
You're one of them!
You're one of them!
No... I won't go with you.
- Mary! Just...
Liar! Liar!
Liars! You're all liars!
- Mary! Mary! Stop this...
Mary! Stop it! STOP IT!!
- Leave me! Leave me alone!
- You're ok! It's ok!
No, no, I'm not going with you.
I don't wanna go! No!
- Put it down! Put it down! 
Please! Stop it! 
Give it to me!
- Stop it, Mo-om!
- Put the knife down!
What's wrong with you?!
What's wrong with you?!
WHAT!!
- Police out here: open up!
No! Don't let them get me!
Are you alright?
Oh God! Where did she go?
No! Go away! Tell them to go away.
Please God, no! I don't wanna go away!
- Please John, let me speak to her. 
She was doing fine... Oh God please!
- Mrs. Marino, open the door!
- What's that? What are you doing?! 
Oh please don't do this! Don't cause...
- She's a danger to herself and others...
Look at what she did to your son. - No, she's...
not a danger: it was an accident! No, I don't 
want to do this! - We're going to use the
Baker Act. We're taking her down the hospital.
- What's the Baker Act?
I don't want to do this!
- This is not your decision to make.
- But no, Mary, Mary, no! No! Please!
Just cooperate with them.
Don't put her on the bed like that!
I don't want to go there. No! John!
Help me! No, no! I don't want to go!
Hey, Christopher! I'm going to go with
Mommy. We'll be back soon.
- John! Stay with the kid!
Tell me what you hear.
Listen... Do you hear the ocean?
- Huh-huh!
So do I.
Why can't she come home?
The doctors want to keep an eye on her 
and make sure she takes her medicine.
- Why don't she take it?
- I don't know.
- How long is she going to be here?
- I don't know.
I'll wait here.
No, no, Mom...
Mom's looking forward to seeing you.
Come on.
I brought your paints.
Your brushes.
Paint and brushes...
We have to leave with the nurse. 
The doctor doesn't know... uhm...
I was thinking maybe he should fly
back - stay with you for a while.
It's... just a semester.
It's, It's tough on him and I think it,
for a while, I just think it might be 
better, that's all.
Who were you talking to on the phone?
Aunt Joanne...
I had to mention what 
happened and...  
she said that if,... 
if you thought it was a good idea,
you could... go back to Alaska 
until things calm down.     
It's just an option.
Here.
Wait, Chris.
- It's ok.
You've got to eat, take it.
Get your bike.
Dad, what's going on? ...DAD!
- Yeah?
What are you doing?
- D-do me a favour: get me those screws
over there. That old tin thing.
- What are you doing? You going to work?
- Er yeah. No.
I'm taking some sick time..
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't you have to go to school?
- Yeah. - Well you better get ready.
Go ahead! Go ahead! Go! - Ok.
Don't forget to make your lunch.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Where do you go? - What?
- When you skip class, where do you go?
- The beach.
- Well, what do you do?
- I don't know: fish, hang out.
It's quiet.
- Is it true that your mom's in
that mental hospital? 
- No.
- Well, I got to go.
- Say! Nice shirt! Where d'you get it?
- Ugh? Oh! I made it.
- Really? Cool.
Well, can you make me one?
- Yeah, alright! 
- No, really, it's cool!
- Uhm, sure, get me an old shirt.
- Ok, wait.
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.
- It was for gym, I don't need it.
- Ok.
- Ok, cool. Bye.
- Bye.
- Mmm! With the ladies...
- Shut up!
- Dad, do we have any milk?
- Yeah, I bought some last night.
- Wh-where is it?
- It's in the fridge.
I left it in the truck.
Hi Chris. It's Mom.
- How are you? 
- Fine.
- Are you having fun with your dad? 
- I guess.
- He's building something.
- Is that Mom? That's supposed to be
a surprise.
Here's Dad. Bye.
- I love you.
- Hey, Mare, Hi!
- What are you building?
- Well, it was supposed to be a
surprise for you.
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.
Yeah, I know the feeling. But you're getting
a lot of rest, right? So are you painting?
- No.
- Well you should, Mary. 
Give you something to do.
I want to come home.
I want to get out of here.
Er... Honey, we want you home, too.
I want to go back to the real Florida.
There's only one Florida, Mary,
and we're in it.
- Ok. I love you.
- I love you, too, Hon.
Mary, you know you're not supposed to
smoke that in here. Give that to me.
Here's your medication.
Get it swallowed.
- I took it.
- Yes, I know. Let me get this.
There you go.
Let me see you take it.
Take it.
Let me see.
Swallow, Mary.
Let me see.
Good girl.
That thing's where? I put it down.
Where the heck did it...?
- Chris, are you there, Chris.
Did you see the extention cord? 
- No.
I've got your pay check.
Sorry it's late again.
Friggin accountants!
- Er, no worries. Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Oh yeah, uhm, how's Mary doing?
- Ugh, she's fine, she's resting.  
She'll be home soon.
- Good! Good!
- What about you: how're you doing?
- Good.
Yeah, you said you needed a couple
of sick days, but, it's been a week.
Oh yeah, well, last time I checked, 
I caught 42 sick days.
You want me back at work, you give me
the raise you promised. I'm making 
the same money staying here.
And I've got 42 days, plus vacation,
and that's what, 5 into 40...
- I'll see you in 8 and a half weeks.
- Come now, you're killing me!
- Dad, do you have my extention cord?
- Hey Chris, how's it going? - Ok.
Listen. I'm missing deadlines,
and the crew's falling behind. 
What are doing here?
- I'm building a sailboat. 
- 
  A sailboat, in your driveway?
- Well, seeing that it won't fit in the house...
- Come on Johnny! - Just a moment.
Chrissy, take this and put it on the
kitchen table and don't lose it. 
- Ok.
Look at me. It's our money.
How many years have I known you?  
I will give you a piece of advice.
Don't waste your money on this crazy thing.
You're already up to your neck in bills 
with Mary and the...
I'll see you at work tomorrow.
Does that mean you gave me a raise?
What are you doing back there?
Bear claw, lion claw, my claw.
Lost her to a barracuda.
Nasty fish.
Ah! Can I help you out?
- Oh hi! I'm going to take this.
Do you have any old sails lying around? 
I'm building a sailboat.
Er, sailboat, hhum... What size?
- 24 feet.
Phew, ambitious! 
Not many people know what it takes. 
I had this old number here.
Urggh! Should fit.
- How much?
Oh... Take it! Er, darn thing 
is loaded with holes and, er...
I was going to throw it away anyway.
- That's nice, thank you.
Oh! Hold on a minute! Hold on...
Let me look for something, I can never
find the darn thing...
Every captain needs a mate, and every
boat needs a piece of good luck.
Take it!
Nail it to the front of the boat.
- Can't be too careful when
you're building a sailboat.
- That's great, thank you!
What do you think?
First mate needs his hat.
I don't wear hats much. 
With the sun glaring down on your
face, you're going to need a hat.
We can take her down the North Lake
when we get her in the water.
- North Lake?
It's where I met your mom.
How do I look?
- What's that? 
- Don't ask!
Looks like a boat... 
Ha! Sweet!
- What the hell is that?!
- A boat.
Hi, Mr. Marino!
- Hi, boys.
- A boat? Yeah, right!
What a freak!
Get out of here!
Why doesn't he just buy a boat?
Ha! Ha! Ha! 
- Crap! - What?
- It's from school.
- I told you to stop skippin'.
- See you later, man! - Ok.
Detail 'A' shows configuration
frame assembly.
- Detail 'B'...
- Dad?
- Where's detail 'B'?
- I got to talk to you.
Can it wait?
Just let me finish this,
before it gets dark.
Detail 'A' shows the configuration of
frame a...
- Chris, don't mess with that!
- I was thinking of going fishing: wanna go?
- No, I, I, I ...I can't.
- When?
What did I just tell you?!
What's so important about this boat?
Everybody's talking about us.
- It's nobody's business!
- They say you're crazy, too!
Is this my shirt?
- I can make another one.
- No, it's beautiful! Thanks Chris!
- Where did you get this?
- Chris made it.
- Wow! You made this? 
Will you make me one?
- Sure.
- How much?
- Twenty bucks. And he needs an old shirt.
I've got five bucks now in here.
I'll give you the rest later.
I'm in here.
- What's all this?
- I'm just making a couple of shirts.
- A couple... When did you start this?
- What?!
Sewing.
What d'you want?
Look, the doctor says we can take Mom
out to the Thanksgiving dinner, but she...
she might be a little nervous, so let's,
let's try and make her feel comfortable, ok?
- Ok.
- Thank you for my Thanksgiving corsage.
- You're welcome.
You guys look so handsome!
Especially you...
I see you decided to keep
the patch, after all. 
- Do you like my tie?
- I do. But I like your patch better.
- What do you say we get some turkey?
- I want stuffing. - Good stuff!
- Yeah, me too! Let's go!
- Do you like my painting?
- Yeah.
So this is where we always walked.
I'm so hungry.
- It's going to be about another hour.
- Another hour? Tell me though, wait, wait,
excuse me, I'm sorry, an hour we're waiting.
It's Thanksgiving. I made the reservation a
week ago. No, no, I'll tell you what... 
I'm sorry. Everyone has a reservation here.
- I'm starving!
Tell ya what, I'm gonna make your life easy. 
Just give me the pumpkin pie, to go, I'll
pay for it and we'll be out of your life, ok?
- Because I've been waiting... 
Hey, we're gonna go, ok kid?
- Good! I wanna go. I'm hungry, I'm hungry!
Is that mine?! Can I have it?!
Please, pumpkin pie? Ok.
- Now this is a tap, a tap...
- We've run out of pumkin pie.
Will you take an apple pie, please?
- What do you mean you don't have any
pumpkin pie? On Thanksgiving?
- There, we have apple.
- You like apple. 
- No, we don't want apple pie. Why don't
you have any pumpkin pie, did you run out? 
- No, but wait a minute. How come you could
run out of pumpkin pie, on Thanksgiving?
I mean, really!
Pumpkin pie! That's what you have for
Thaksgiving. Pumpkin pie! Not apple pie!
Pumpkin pie! That's what we want!
My boy wants pumpkin pie! Ok?   
That's what we've been waiting for! 
We've been waiting in this restaurant,
to have a nice turkey dinner, and some
stuffing, and some pumpkin pie, ok?
We've all been sitting in here and waiting
and waiting and waiting...
- Fine, you want pumpkin pie!
- I don't want to eat cafeteria foods.
I want to eat a pumpkin pie!
- Sir?!
- Everyone is eating and I'm hungry!
I don't want cafeteria food.
- Here, take it. Let's go! 
Let's go Chris! Let's go Chris! Let's go!
- That's what I want. Come on Chris, let's get
out of here. ...It should be a bigger piece.
- You happy, Mary? You got your pumpkin pie. 
- I'm ever happy. - Good. You got apple pie,
you got pumkin pie. - I don't want any!
- You know, next time, I'm gonna have to
call the cops.
- Thank you! Happy Thanksgiving!
But-but you said this medication would work.
John, Schizophrenia is... is a difficult
disease to treat. 
What works for one person may not work
for another.
My wife's been sick for 18 months.
Her doctor said the medicine
would make her better.
Now she's here with the state,
you said this medicine would make her better. 
I... I mean, what about the stuff
I read about?
It hasn't been released yet. 
It's still experimental.
When do I get my wife back? 
Well, we could... we could try
some short visits to start.
Maybe in the future, a weekend.
I just have to make sure she's stable.
How about you, Chris?
How are you holding up? How are things?  
- Well everybody...
He's fine. We're fine.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Chris, what's wrong?
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what? I don't hear anything.
- Stop it!
- Stop what?
- No, stop it!
- Stop what? I don't hear anything, Chris.
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!...
That's a really nice boat you've got here.
What kind is it?
The floating kind.
Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm with the City Building Department. 
- Yeah, I kind of noticed that.
Yeah, unfortunately, there seems 
to be a complaint.
Complaint, huh?
I've done a lot of projects here before,
and I've never had a problem.
Well you've got a problem now.
Now look, buddy...
Personally, I don't care, but they've got this
city ordinance against construction like this.
I mean, if you want to build the friggin
Eiffel Tower, it's ok by me.
You just can't build it here...
I'm sorry.
- I'm going fishing, Dad. I'll see you later.
- Ok. Catch us something big.
- Do you think I'm weird?
- Ha, yeah!
I'm serious. Do you think I'm weird?
- Weird, as in what? 
- You know, like crazy?
- No. Why?
- No reason.
- So you're gonna ask Dawn out?
- No.
- She likes you!
- Whatever! Whatever!
- What will I say?
- Ok, it's your birthday soon, right?
Ok. Well, we'll have my parents
drive us to the Arcade...
and then... invite her, too!  
Uhmm... Get her on the roller-rink,
and just do what you do, I guess!  
You know what I'm saying?!
Something like that.
- Come on!
Guess the boat's dead.
See you man! - Yeah!
I thought you couldn't build it.
- I couldn't build it in the driveway.
I found a loophole.
I'm waiting.
Yes, I'm right here.
- They're not coming, Donna.
- I packed what you said!
- Donna, nobody's coming. Same...
- But I already told the nurse.
- Are you going home?
- Yes, my parents are coming to pick me up.
She waits at that door every day.
- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.
It's for my son.
Here.
Take it.
Go crazy.
When you paint, they go away.
- Who?
- The voices.
- So, we gonna turn this over, or what?
- So how many does this thing hold?
- Four. - Any animals?
- Animals! - Yeah, two monkeys!
Ha! Look! It's Noah's Ark.
- Tony? Two of your mouths 
wouldn't fit on this boat.
- Alright comedians! Keep it down!
Alright, fellas, on the count of three.
Be careful, it's heavy. 1, 2, 3...
Got it? Right. Easy. Be careful!
Easy! I got it! I got it!...
- Watch yourselves.

- Alright, go!. Go! Go! - There you go!

- Alright, come to me, come to me!

- Good! Easy, easy! We got it!
Easy! There she goes!
- Good! Excellent! Alright, beers are in
the cooler, boys, 'cause I ain't paying ya!
Good work guys! Thanks for everything!
Miss Finkel, she turned around and farted 
right in the kids' faces.
It was the funniest thing ever!
There she is, man. Go! - No. 
- Go for it, man! - No.
- Come on! Are you scared? - No. 
- Are you scared? - No.
- Well then go! - No!
- Hey, Dawn! 
- Hi, Chris, what's up?
- Nothing much. How about you?
Mm, this weekend, I went on a boat ride.
It was fun.
Mm, that's nice. Uhmm, would you, er,
like to come to the...
Hey, Chris! How's it going?
Did you finish my new shirts?
Oh, wow! They're fabulous.
Thanks! I love'em!
- I love this shirt!
Do you get those in South Beach? 
- No! He made them. Aren't they awesome?
- You made these? - Yeah.
- How much? - Forty bucks...
And an old shirt. - Wow! Ok. Cool!
Oh! These patches are so cool.
Did you want to ask me something?
Yeah, I was just, uhmm...
Some friends of mine are going to the
Arcade on my birthday...
and if you want, maybe you could come?
- Your birthday?
- Ok. Sure!
- Oh really? Ok. Well... Bye!
I have a surprise for you.
Ok guys! And I've got pizza (da-da-dun!).
Happy birthday! 
Sit down, sit down over here.
- It's material, for your shirts.
- Thanks!
- Yes, you're welcome!
- I missed you.
What's that?
That. What's that?
- What's what?
That, right outside.
Honey, you're seeing things again.
- You're crazy.
- I'm crazy!
You're crazy. Mia bella pazza.
- Bella what?
- Bella pazza is crazy.
A crazy, beautiful nut.
Come on, let's eat.
What about Sam. - Huh?
You said I could eat with him.
Oh! You're right, I did.
- Where?
- The Arcade, remember?
Oh! You're right, I forgot. Mare, I forgot. 
I don't know.
- It's ok, it's ok. I know, I got an idea.
How about we all sit down together... 
and we have food, and we have time to eat 
like a family, and then...
I will make you a beautiful, beautiful
birthday cake...
and then you can play with your friends.
What do you think? - Ok.
Look at me. 
Alright, go ahead and eat.
And you can tell me about that... 
thing, in the backyard.
I don't like you having Diet Coke, I'm sorry.
- Water. Cows drink water, just like milk.
- You want one...
- No, I'm not here, but... really, cheers.
- What's her name? - Dad!
- What about this? - Dad!
Mm, looks good on me..
One second.
Try this.
- What is this?
- It's cologne.
- I got to go.
- Wait, wait. Let me talk to Sam's parents.
Wait! Wait! Wait!
The cake's ready.
- I hope I don't fall.
- You probably will. 
See, skate at your own risk. It's the risk 
you take. It's fun dude, don't worry.
- Who invited them?
- Not me. Who cares, man.
We should have fun. 
It's your birthday.
Here you go. And here you go.
- Hey! Look at this one!
- Happy birthday!
Cool! Thanks!
- My mom says a good fisherman
can always use some hooks.
- Yeah, I know. Chris is always losing 'em. 
- What's a 'Gucky'?
- Oh! It's like a purse. My mom has one.
- Gucci. He's a famous clothing designer 
from Italy.
Maybe you'll be one, too! 
- You're not going to design purses
for a living.
If you're lucky, I'll make you a skirt!
That's his mom!
This birthday is the one...
Here! Blow out your candles.
Happy birthday!
I just couldn't stand the idea of not
being here for your birthday.
I brought, uhm, hats, everybody!
Pass them around, and I've got
noisemakers. - Mom!
- And I've brought... here, pass them
around. And a hat for all the kids and
we can play games... - Stop it, Mom!
- Stop it, Mom!
- But, Chris, I just... made a cake.
Blow your candles out!
Go away! Leave!
Excuse me.
- I'm going to tuck you in.
- I'm not a baby.
You're going to sleep on top
of the covers like this?
Do you remember me before?
... - Before?
Before. When you were little.
Remember? ...At all?
We used to go to the beach and...
whenever a big wave came,
you would come... running to me.
Laughing, always laughing.
Do you remember?
Why can't you act normal?
You're a big boy, now. 
You're a young man, now.
There's something wrong with me.
But I think it's treatable... Ok?
I'm sorry I messed up your birthday. 
I'm... sorry.
Did you brush your teeth, Honey?
- Yeah. - Ok.
- Do say it.
- A bella pazza.
Say it again.
A bella pazza. Ducie ma bella pazza.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
- No, no, no, don't take it off!
- Why?
- I don't want my skin to show.
- I love your skin.
- Please, John.
I heard something.
Ok, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
Don't get mad.
Are you... are you mad?
...- No.
- Hey! Do you want a birthday cake?
- How about some Frrruity Pebbles.
- No, no, see I go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, me.
- 
He's such a fag!
Wait! He might go crazy on your ass!
- Just ignore 'em, man.
- Chris! Why's your dad building that boat? 
- See! Now I don't know who's crazy:
your mom or your dad.
- What's wrong, man? Can't you take a joke?
- Hey, hey! I'm sorry! I'm just curious.
Does your mom wear a straight-jacket
when she goes to bed?
Let me see.
I appreciate your help.
I appreciate you coming in.
Chris, Mr. Marino.
Please have a seat.
Hey, get back here!
Hey! I'm not done with you. Chris!
Of all the kids, you had to pick on
my... my boss' son!
- You weren't there. You don't understand.
- I understand. I understand everything.
I understand that you've been cutting class.
I understand you're getting into fights.
I've got enough on my hands with your mother.
I don't need this right now.
Now you're grounded. Get in your room!
Hey! Did you hear what I said?!
Get in that bedroom! - No!
- What the hell's gotten in to you?
- It's just a boat!
Just a stupid friggin boat!
You pay more attention to this stupid
piece of wood than you do me.
What do you want from me?!
What do you want?!
You want me to take you to the movies?
You want to go fishing?
Would that make it better?
You want your mommy back.
Well, I want my wife back.
I want her back to normal. I want her 
whole, the way she was. The way she was
when I met her.
The woman I fell in love with.
What do you think? I miss her, too.
I'm sorry, I... 
I'm sorry.
Maybe she'll get better.
- No, stop it! 
Stop it! Stop it!
Mom's never getting better!
She's crazy and so are you!
- Chris. Look, I know things are rough
right now...
- No! You don't know anything!
You don't know what it's like to see
your mother act crazy.
You don't know what it's like to have
your friends laugh at you.
I hate it here!
I don't want to live here anymore.
I'm calling Aunt Jo and
I'm never coming back!
When I was little, I always wondered
what was on the other side.
I'm sorry about the fight.
- I guess everyone knows about my mom now.
- Your mom's nice.
My mom's weird. I mean, she's always smoking
funny cigarettes...
and playing really weird music.
She says it keeps evil spirits away. 
Your mom was just trying to make
your birthday fun.
Africa.
That's what's on the other side.
- How's it going?
- He's ok. He's ok.
- Oh no. What! Don't do this. Don't do this.
- I just... I just...
I just can't keep you on any longer.
- Oh, you got to be kidding! - I'm sorry.
- You're going to fire me?
Why? 'Cause our kids got into a fight,
Because I took sick pay,
which was mine to take?
No, it has nothing to do with that. It's...
Things have been rough, that's all. We lost
that account in Kendall... 
And the economy...
This is not easy for me to do,
because you are my friend.
I'm your friend?
I'm your friend.
You have the sauce to come to my house,
in your fancy car, and fire me...
and tell me you're having it rough?
Come on. I busted my back, 20 years for
your family.
Your father first, now you. While you go out
and buy your new house, your new boat.
Would it ha' killed you to give me an extra
100 bucks a week, so I could ha' taken care
of my family. My wife's doctor's bills...
Friend!
You were never my friend.
- This is why Chris has a problem.
- Excuse me?
Chris is a good boy.
He's a kind boy.
But you wouldn't understand kindness.
I love him. I'd do anything for him.
But you wouldn't understand that, either.
So go ahead, actor, take your car, you
spoiled brat and go and play on your
fancy boat.
How's that eye doing?
Is it my fault you got fired?
No. It has nothing to do with you.
Don't even think that.
I should have known this was
going to happen a long time ago. 
So what are we going to do now?
We're going to Vegas.
- Really?
- No, no, not really!
We're broke!
Er, Dad, you going
to work on the boat today?
...- No. ...You were right. 
Your old man's crazy.
I'll break it down and take it
out of here. It was a stupid idea.
Another postcard from your Aunt Jo.
Aunt Jo the Eskimo.
It's friggin cold in Alaska.
You think maybe, you can make one of
those shirts for your old man?
Sure, for forty bucks.
Forty bucks? Don't you have
a friends of the family discount?
For you, I'll do it for cost.
I patched the hole.
I think we should finish it.
Come on! We can build it. I mean,
I can help you. We have most of
the wooden supplies, right?
Let's build it.
Here you go. - Thank you.
Have a great day!
Put on on your hood.
So... what are you gonna do
over the Summer?
- I'm gonna stay with my aunt in Alaska.
- Alaska?
Yeah, she lives on a lake. It's cool.
When are you coming back?
- I don't think I am coming back.
- Why?
- Do... do your parents know?
- My dad does.
You know it's cold in Alaska.
Yeah, I know.
- I'll race you to the lighthouse.
- Ok!
I beat ya.
Bye, I got to go.
- Have y'thought of a name for the boat yet?
- How about, "Pain In The Butt"?
So you want me to name it after you?
When did you first kiss Mom?
- What does that have to do with sailing?
- Just asking!
When did I first kiss Mom?
No way was it easy, I'll tell you that.
I had to earn that privilege.
I think it was like...
it was our third date.
But it was definitely in a sailboat.  
- Is that the boat in the pictures?
- Ah, yeah, our family album? Yeah.
I'll tell you something else.
If it weren't for that boat...
you wouldn't be sitting there.
- Why?
When I'd had it for five years...
let's just say the Marino charm
was too much for her to handle.
Mammy named you after St. Christopher,
...patron saint of travellers?
But old St. Chris,...
he loved sailors.
Just like Mom is going to love this boat.
The three of us are going
to have a great time.
School let's out next month.
And if I'm going to Aunt Jo's...
Well, We'll just have to finish it
before then, won't we? - Yeah.
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
Keep going, Chris, at the wrench.
I think I'll... hold onto this.
First time! First time.
Hey dad?...
How are we going to get this out of the yard? 
Who's laughing?
Stop it!
Please, stop it!
Mary? She's finished. Start packing.
We're picking you up first thing
in the morning, for the weekend.
The doctor ok'd it.
I just... I don't think it's such
a good idea right now, I...
Maybe next time... You an...
You and Chris go.
- Why?
Is everthing ok?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
I don't want to ruin all the fun.
- You'll make it fun.
Ok, I've got to go. You guys have a really,
really, really fun time. Ok-bye.
Yeah, no, no, he's right here.
No, he misses you, too
Alright. Yeah, we love you. Bye.
She's not coming, is she?
No, she's got therapy, group something...
But we're gonna go.
Let's christen this sucker!
I want to get up bright and early.
We got to make sure she works
before Mom gets home. - Ok.
You ready? - Yeah.
Let's go.
Find your seatbelt.
You ready? - Yeah.
There she goes!
- It floats! 
- Yeah, it floats!
- I know how to swim.
- It'll just make me feel better, ok Chris.
Here, sit down.
Here we go!
- What do we call it?
- The tiller.
- And what does the tiller do?
- It steers the boat.
Excellent. Now hold onto it tight, alright?
I want you to steer it.
Do you see the arrow up there?
I want you to steer it into the wind,
where the arrow is pointing.
Because I won't be able to pull up the sails.
Alright? I want you to take hold of the
tiller and hold on to it tight.
Alright, now listen. If you go this way,
the boat goes that way.
You go this way, the boat goes that way.
So everything's the opposite. You got it?
- Yeah. - Good.
That's it. Good boy.
Into the wind.
Go left. Left. Look at the arrow.
Point it into the direction of the arrow.
Got it? You're doing a good job.
Another guy in a motor boat.
Wait! Let this guy get in front of ya.
Ok, always wave...
with a smile: they'll never know
we hate them.
Don't worry about the yacht, Chris.
It's in the wind. Hear it?
It's in the wind.
That's good.
That a boy!
That's it.
Turn it! Turn it, turn it,
to the right, to the right...
What's happening?
Ha! Ha! We're sailing.
We're raising the jib.
...Pull! Pull!
As hard as you can! Hard as you can!
Now tie her up.
Those paintings look great up there!
Feel?
So free!
- Wow! - Yeah!
- You ready to come about?
- Sure.
Hoist it! Tharaboy! Harder! Y'got it?!
Now we'll tie her off.
Feel that, Chrissie?
Oh, we've got a good wind now.
Oh yea, Hector! Gepaso?! (How are you?!)
Run out of gas?!
Ahoy, First Mate!
- You did pretty good out there.
- I almost wrecked it.
Yes you did. But,...
we're still floating.
See that school over there? - Yeah.
That's where I met Mommy. - Really?
She loved to sail off.
And we were taking lessons, and it was at 
that point where, the instructor paired
us off in 2 and sent us on out on our own.
Well, I thought I'd dazzle her
with my... nautical skills.
And that's when I almost capsized the boat.
She was so beautiful.
- She still is.
- I know.
- I'm sorry she couldn't come.
- Some day.
- You think?
- Yeah!
So about Alaska...
I hear it gets pretty cold there.
