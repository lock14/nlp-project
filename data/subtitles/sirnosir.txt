<i>The following program
is in living colours</i>

2
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:19,096
<i>and has been rated "X" by the Vietnam
academy of maggots.</i>

3
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:24,342
<i>This is Radio First Termer operating on
Dave Rabbit's on its own frequency</i>

4
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:27,523
<i>at 69 MHz on your FM dial.</i>

5
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:32,073
<i>The purpose of this program
is to bring vital news, information</i>

6
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:36,764
<i>and hard acid rock music
to the first termers and non-re-enlistees</i>

7
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:38,754
<i>in the Republic of Vietnam.</i>

8
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:44,241
<i>Radio First Termer operates under
no Air Force regulations or manuals.</i>

9
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:50,082
<i>In the event of a vice squad raid this
program will automatically self-destruct.</i>

10
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:59,754
# Soldier boy

11
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:04,862
# Oh my little soldier boy

12
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:12,969
# I'll be true to you

13
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,683
<i>Don't misunderstand.
I liked being in the Marine Corps.</i>

14
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:20,654
I thought it was good.

15
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,926
<i>When I did go into the military,
I went in there gung-ho.</i>

16
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:27,152
In basic training you have
these 500 points that you score.

17
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:29,658
I scored like 501 or something.

18
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:32,207
I was really ready.

19
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:35,436
<i>I was certain that every male
member of my family</i>

20
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:38,113
<i>had their war, and that
there'd be a war from me.</i>

21
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:42,823
And I would go off and be a hero,
and fight a good fight for this country.

22
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:47,670
<i>I've tried to spend my whole life
having people live a better life,</i>

23
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:51,312
and basically feel better.
That's what nurses do, right?

24
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,599
<i>You know, it took us almost
three weeks to cross the Pacific</i>

25
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:57,438
<i>and there wasn't too much to do
on a troopship.</i>

26
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,914
<i>So we'd sit up on the deck
at night and have raps.</i>

27
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:03,231
A lot of times we'd get to
what we were going to,

28
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:04,815
whether it was right or wrong.

29
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:07,730
And we'd go back and forth,
back and forth,

30
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:10,239
and we'd always end up concluding,

31
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:11,744
"Well, let's hope we're
doing the right thing

32
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:13,377
"because that's where we're going".

33
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:21,284
In the early 1960s,

34
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:25,748
the US Government began sending
combat troops to South Vietnam.

35
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:30,455
<i>I was really proud of what
I thought I was doing.</i>

36
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:36,464
<i>The problem I had was realising
that what I was doing was not good.</i>

37
00:02:37,228 --> 00:02:40,317
I was doing it right,
but I wasn't doing right.

38
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,115
I was asked to train Green Beret people,
Special Forces men.

39
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:47,866
Why were they training
these guys in dermatology?

40
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:50,997
They were training them to do
dermatology in Vietnam

41
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:55,336
because they knew that if they were
able to offer a few simple remedies,

42
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:59,405
<i>and help cure a few children
of some simple bacterial infections,</i>

43
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:04,424
<i>that that would ingratiate themselves
to the Vietnamese community.</i>

44
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:07,879
You remember the phrase, "winning
the hearts and the minds of the people".

45
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:11,721
So this was how you were going to win
the hearts and minds of the people.

46
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:14,128
And while they were offering
the band aids

47
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,148
and helping to cure a few cases
of impetigo

48
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:19,515
they were bombing the hell
out of the villages.

49
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:28,067
I was out on a patrol
near Hipwa,

50
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,532
and we took a couple of prisoners,
whether they were combatants or not,

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,993
<i>who knows.</i>

52
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:42,848
<i>The patrol was led by Americans but
there were Vietnamese ARVN there,</i>

53
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:45,343
<i>and they were turned over to ARVN</i>

54
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,314
<i>and ARVN used the old-fashioned
methods of interrogation:</i>

55
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:53,848
<i>force, torture...
that was pretty common practice.</i>

56
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,494
I tell you as bad as that treatment was,
the cynicism that attached to it,

57
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:03,542
was the part that was really sickening,
I thought,

58
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:05,357
anathema to
everything I'd been taught,

59
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,612
everything I'd learned,
everything I grew up with,

60
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,524
this is just not the way
you treat human beings.

61
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:15,097
It was all done for the
good of the cause, I guess.

62
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>I got out of the military in 1966.</i>

63
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:22,703
<i>I got out because of the things
I saw, the things I was doing,</i>

64
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:26,341
<i>and the reasons we were given
for doing them.</i>

65
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:27,939
It was a personal protest.

66
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:30,107
It was just me getting
out of the service.

67
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:32,905
There was no movement to join.

68
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:36,788
I found the war in Vietnam
more and more repulsive.

69
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:39,562
And I felt that I just couldn't be
a part of it.

70
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:43,437
<i>Eventually I said, "Look.
I'm not training you, guys, anymore.</i>

71
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,765
<i>"I don't agree with what you're doing.
I think it's immoral.</i>

72
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,457
<i>"I think it's medically unethical".
And I just stopped.</i>

73
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,191
Threw them out of the clinic.

74
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:55,080
It took a few weeks for the Army
to catch up with that,

75
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:58,632
and when they did, they invited me
into the Commanding Officer's office

76
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,225
and said,
"Look. What are you doing, here?"

77
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,843
And I told him exactly what I was doing.
I said, "I'm not training them".

78
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:06,159
And they said, "Well, you should know
the consequences of that".

79
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:08,252
And I said, "I'm perfectly aware
of the consequences.

80
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,644
"So I'm not training them".

81
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:13,263
<i>At that point it was obvious that
I was going to be court-martialled,</i>

82
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:16,102
<i>and a few days later I got
the court-martial notice.</i>

83
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,113
Howard Levy spent
three years in prison.

84
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:25,513
Along with him, three GIs at Fort Hood
who refused orders to Vietnam

85
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:29,175
and received five years hard labour
and a dishonourable discharge.

86
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,291
Army Lieutenant Henry Howe,

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,885
who carried a sign at
a demonstration reading

88
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:36,857
"End Johnson's fascist aggression
in Vietnam"

89
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,748
was sentenced to 2 years.

90
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:42,774
And two marines,
William Harvey and George Daniel,

91
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,175
received 6 to 10 years sentences

92
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:49,347
for organising a meeting about whether
black people should fight in Vietnam.

93
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:55,213
And on March 3rd, 1966,
former Green Beret, Donald Duncan

94
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:59,389
was the featured speaker at an anti-war
meeting at the town hall in Manhattan.

95
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:03,509
I just wanted to tell
what I knew about it,

96
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:08,480
and let people judge for themselves.

97
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,961
<i>I think the most startling thing to me
occurred however,</i>

98
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:17,735
<i>as the court-martial began.
What would happened was,</i>

99
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:20,741
<i>we would walk from the parking lot</i>

100
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:24,332
<i>to the building where the
cour-martial was being held,</i>

101
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:30,107
<i>and it was the most remarkable thing
when hundreds, hundreds of GIs,</i>

102
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:34,172
<i>would hang out of windows out of
the barracks and give me the V sign,</i>

103
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,191
<i>or give me the clenched fist.</i>

104
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,430
<i>This was mingboggling to me.
This was a revelation.</i>

105
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:43,823
And at that point,
it really became crystal clear to me

106
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,651
that something had changed here.

107
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:49,285
That something very, very important
was happening.

108
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:52,799
<i>How many people in the Army</i>

109
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:57,746
<i>would you think feel the same way
perhaps as you do, are against the war?</i>

110
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:04,146
I really don't know how many,
but I know how many I met,

111
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:08,528
and that was a majority of the men
that I met in the service were opposed

112
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:12,287
but really didn't know how to
voice their opinion.

113
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,049
1968 was the turning point,

114
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:18,742
by then America had over half a million
troops in South Vietnam.

115
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,928
But during the Lunar New Year
Holiday called Têt,

116
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:26,457
the enemy, the North Vietnamese
and National Liberation Front Armies,

117
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,346
launched an offensive that overran
the entire country

118
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,944
before being pushed back.

119
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,977
The Têt offensive
revealed that the enemy

120
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:36,037
had widspread support
from the Vietnamese people.

121
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,928
And America was mired in a war
that couldn't win.

122
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:45,054
And with soldiers beginning to question
the war in the wake of the Têt offensive,

123
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:48,594
thousands began going AWOL,
or Absent WithOut Leave.

124
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,764
Many found their way to San Francisco

125
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:56,784
where a series of events brought
the emerging GI antiwar movement

126
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,612
onto the national stage.

127
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:02,165
<i>Have you given much thought
to the penalty of being an AWOL?</i>

128
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,255
Yes.

129
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:06,840
<i>Can we see your chains, please?</i>

130
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,741
<i>We joined together in July, 1968.</i>

131
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:15,856
We took sanctuary in a church
and chained ourselves to ministers.

132
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,859
We essentially called the press
and said to them,

133
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,961
"We're not going to Vietnam.
We're refusing our orders".

134
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:27,594
"And in fact we're resinging
from the military.

135
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:28,986
<i>"Come and get us".</i>

136
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:32,479
<i>The fact that it took
them three days</i>

137
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,802
<i>to decide how to deal
with this tactically,</i>

138
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,385
<i>that was great.</i>

139
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,340
<i>We had nothing to lose.</i>

140
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:42,171
And we had no idea what was gonna come.

141
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,982
And that's a free place.

142
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:46,137
It's a really free place, you know.

143
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:48,858
You don't know what's gonna happen,
you don't know where you're going,

144
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,373
but you know what you're doing.

145
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:04,767
And that was my introduction to the
San Francisco Presidio stockade.

146
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:14,125
<i>The population fluctuated usually
upwards.</i>

147
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,743
<i>It was built, I think,
could hold like maybe 60,</i>

148
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:20,826
<i>and there was sometimes
double that in there.</i>

149
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:27,048
Overcrowded, toilets backed up,
food was short, guards were mean.

150
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:29,068
It wasn't any fun.

151
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:35,640
With the "9 for peace"
held in military prisons,

152
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,465
soldiers throughout the Bay Area

153
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:41,167
began planning for the first
anti-war demonstration in the country

154
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:43,756
organised by GIs and veterans.

155
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,787
<i>I was a member of the Medical Committee
for human rights.</i>

156
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:49,080
<i>We got together a number of times</i>

157
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:53,073
and talked about how we were
going to organise active duty GIs

158
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:54,980
to go to the peace demonstration.

159
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,711
<i>And then I remember also
hearing about the B-52 bombers</i>

160
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:03,485
<i>that were dropping leaflets on Vietnam
urging the Vietnamese to defect.</i>

161
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:08,111
And I thought, "Well, if
they can do it overseas,

162
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:14,272
"then we can hire a small private plane,
load it up with leaflets,

163
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,037
<i>"and drop the leaflets on military bases
in the San Francisco Bay area".</i>

164
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,809
<i>Thousands and thousands of leaflets.</i>

165
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:27,628
<i>At one point I know we were a little
concerned about getting shot down,</i>

166
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,493
<i>but nothing happened.</i>

167
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:33,166
Evidently they landed pretty accurately,

168
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:35,577
that's what they testified
at the court-martial.

169
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:42,486
And on my way driving
into the demonstration

170
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,378
I decided I was going to wear
my naval uniform.

171
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:50,403
<i>My opinion was fairly straighforward.</i>

172
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:53,697
<i>It was, if Westmoreland could
wear his uniform</i>

173
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:56,839
<i>being for the war
and talking in front of Congress,</i>

174
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,463
<i>then as an active duty person,</i>

175
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,908
<i>I certainly had the
same rights that he did.</i>

176
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,659
And I could wear my uniform

177
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:07,581
protesting the US'
involvement in Vietnam.

178
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,802
Susan Schnall was court-martialled

179
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,620
for making a political
statement while in uniform.

180
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:17,450
And following the GI and veterans
march for peace,

181
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:21,833
4 AWOL GIs turned themselves in
to the Presidio Army Stockade,

182
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,979
which was about to reach
a breaking point.

183
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:27,280
<i>The moment of my epiphany,
or the thing that came to me was,</i>

184
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:32,088
working in a military hospital
up at Fort Lewis,

185
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:36,382
in a neurology floor and
it was all head and neck injuries.

186
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:39,101
Guys who were so paralysed
that couldn't turn the page of a book,

187
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:41,446
and they couldn't even
take a poop by themselves,

188
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,709
and they couldn't kill themselves.

189
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:46,753
And every day we'd come in as
the medics to take care of them

190
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:48,916
and they would beg us every day
to kill them,

191
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:50,595
because they couldn't kill themselves.

192
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,738
And it was such a horror,

193
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,372
it caused me to think to myself...

194
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:58,989
'cause I grew up
in a military family.

195
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:02,080
My grandfather was a career officer
and my father was a career officer,

196
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:04,322
and I had no reason at all
going into the military,

197
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:06,572
to think there was anything wrong
with the Vietnam War.

198
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:09,729
Or anything wrong with
America, the beautiful.

199
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,671
And then there I was,
faced with this situation

200
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,881
where guys every day were
asking me to kill them.

201
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:17,115
And it was so horrible I had to...

202
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:20,669
at a certain point I just
made a vow to myself that

203
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:24,655
I would never put somebody else
into the hospital on those circumstances.

204
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:26,768
That I wouldn't be the guy
who'd squeeze the trigger

205
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:31,414
that caused some human being
to be in that dreadful situation.

206
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,502
The other thing that bothered me
was that those guys who could talk,

207
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,675
the ones that would
beg you to kill them,

208
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,342
the ones that couldn't
turn the page of the book,

209
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:40,459
they couldn't wiggle anything
from their chin down,

210
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:45,538
none of them felt that they'd made
the sacrifice for a good reason.

211
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:51,020
They all told stories of brutalising
the Vietnamese people,

212
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,409
of being the thugs.

213
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:58,125
And not a single one of them felt like
his sacrifice was for a good cause.

214
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:01,037
<i>For 19-year-old, Private Michael Bunch,</i>

215
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:04,975
life in the Army had been a little
more than a series of AWOL violations.

216
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:07,732
His last stop was here,
the Presidio Stockade,

217
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:12,132
where he was fatally shot last Friday
while trying to escape from a work detail.

218
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:16,447
So I'd been assigned by the Movement
people to go into the Stockade

219
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:17,804
and find out what was going on,

220
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:20,345
'cause they'd shot this prisoner
and killed him.

221
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,402
<i>The guards shot and killed him,</i>

222
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,035
<i>you know, point blank.</i>

223
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,349
<i>And his only crime was
not wanting to be there,</i>

224
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:32,285
and going AWOL.

225
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:37,921
And he was cut down at
a really young age for no good reason.

226
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:41,569
Not unlike a lot of his brothers
in Vietnam.

227
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,853
So we reacted...
viscerally.

228
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:53,788
And with anger and disgust
and outrage.

229
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:58,856
<i>And we tore that jail apart.
We ripped the wires out of the walls,</i>

230
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,852
<i>ripped the squawk box off the wall.</i>

231
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:05,496
And then things started to calm down,
because we started to plan.

232
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:08,462
<i>We came to a decision that
the best thing we could do</i>

233
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:10,394
<i>was to have some kind
of a demonstration.</i>

234
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:13,139
<i>And it was at the roll call
formation, we had a signal.</i>

235
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:14,576
That when we were
supposed to break ranks,

236
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,865
and we did and then we walked
over here and sat down.

237
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,246
<i>At a certain point, Commandant
came out and read us the Mutiny Act,</i>

238
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:24,683
and we just kept singing louder and,
you know, kind of linked arms and sang.

239
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:26,763
<i>We were scared, man.
I tell you.</i>

240
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:28,492
<i>We were really scared.</i>

241
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,118
<i>We had them right where
we wanted them,</i>

242
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:32,299
<i>they were finally listening to us.</i>

243
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:36,558
That's the first time I can ever
remember anybody listening to us

244
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,182
<i>while I was in the military.</i>

245
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:42,721
<i>The Commanding General of the
Sixth Army, which was the jurisdiction,</i>

246
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,525
<i>he said that they thought that
the revolution was about to start.</i>

247
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:48,714
And they really had to set
an example.

248
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,703
You know, come down hard,
and we were the guys

249
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:52,943
<i>that they decided to do that with.</i>

250
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:55,648
<i>And they did. I mean, we were
on trial for our life.</i>

251
00:14:56,118 --> 00:15:00,401
I came in as an AWOL and within
two days of being in the Stockade

252
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:02,865
I was facing a death sentence

253
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:04,993
for singing "We Shall Overcome".

254
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,811
Initially sentenced to 16 years
for mutiny,

255
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:14,806
the Presidio 27 spent up
to two years in federal prison.

256
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:20,242
And facing decades in jail for both
the "9 for peace" and "Presidio Sitdown",

257
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:24,474
Keith Mather escaped from the Presidio
Stockade and made his way to Canada,

258
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:27,782
where he spent the next 18 years
living in exile.

259
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,385
But in the summer of '68,

260
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:35,698
as thousands of supporters protested
the jailing of the Presidio 27,

261
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,603
the GI Movement had arrived.

262
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:44,744
My background is Puerto Rican.

263
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,823
I was born in New York City.

264
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,770
<i>When I was 17 years old,</i>

265
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:52,037
<i>I entered the US Military
Academy at West Point.</i>

266
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,387
I graduated with honours

267
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:57,920
and the Army sent me to graduate
school at Harvard University.

268
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:00,481
To the Kennedy School of Government.

269
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:05,605
I was there for 1,5 years,
at which point I wrote to the Army

270
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,703
and said that I would refuse
to serve in the Vietnam War.

271
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:11,031
<i>I came to believe it was
a war of aggression</i>

272
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:13,270
<i>by the US against the Vietnamese.</i>

273
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:16,168
It was really a troubling decision.

274
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:20,506
Because I knew that my career
would be over,

275
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:22,962
and I didn't know what the future
would bring.

276
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,780
<i>At the time, the press said that
I was the first West Point graduate</i>

277
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:30,137
<i>to refuse to serve in a war
in the history of West Point.</i>

278
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:33,525
I remember calling my parents
and they were in tears,

279
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:38,207
totally in tears, thinking that
I would end up in prison

280
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:41,111
instead of getting a master's
degree from Harvard.

281
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,549
But I told them,
I remember in that conversation,

282
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:46,711
I said, "You always taught me
to do what is just,

283
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,396
"to do what is right".

284
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:55,146
And I really felt that
I was doing the right thing.

285
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:57,656
And I believe that to this day.

286
00:16:57,721 --> 00:17:00,034
34 years later.

287
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:02,132
I know I did the right thing.

288
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:12,183
<i>I was wounded three times
while I was out in the bush.</i>

289
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:16,224
<i>The third time I was wounded
on December 20th, 1967,</i>

290
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:19,431
and we got overrun by
North-Vietnamese irregulars.

291
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:21,642
<i>They started like a
human wave attack.</i>

292
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:25,775
And a guy came up behind our hole
and stuck his rifle in the hole.

293
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:30,330
<i>And I saw the front side
of an AK-47 and a muzzle flash.</i>

294
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:32,387
<i>I had my M-16 pointed up,</i>

295
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:36,652
<i>and I pulled my trigger
when I saw the AK site.</i>

296
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:40,035
And the bullet hit me in the knee
and I blacked out.

297
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,397
I came to a few minutes later

298
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:45,952
and my gun was jammed
and my knee was shattered.

299
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:52,368
they carried me over to this
guy who had shot me.

300
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:54,911
And he was sitting up against
a tree stump,

301
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:58,134
and he was dead. He had three
bullets holes up his chest

302
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,757
and he had his AK
lying across his lap.

303
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,786
<i>And the Seargent said,
"Here's this gook you killed.</i>

304
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>"You did a good job".</i>

305
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,022
And I seen this guy and
he was about my age,

306
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:12,449
and I said, thinking,
"Why is he dead and I'm alive?"

307
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:16,082
It was just a matter of pure luck.
Then I started thinking,

308
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,040
<i>I wonder if he had a girlfriend</i>

309
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:21,194
<i>and how his mother is going to
find out and things like that.</i>

310
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:25,365
<i>When you just went through
an experience of that nature,</i>

311
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:27,121
<i>and you find out that it's all lies</i>

312
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,238
<i>and that they're just
lying to the American people,</i>

313
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:34,043
<i>and your silence means that
you're part of keeping that lie going,</i>

314
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:36,704
I couldn't stop,
I couldn't be silent.

315
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:40,107
I felt that I had a responsibility
to my friends,

316
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:42,366
and to the country in general,

317
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:44,989
and to the Vietnamese.
The last guy who I shot,

318
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:47,842
and I don't consider he was the first
guy I shot,

319
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:49,177
but he was the first guy I shot

320
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:51,855
where I was shooting it up
barrel to barrel with him,

321
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,364
and looked him in the face afterwards,

322
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:57,276
and I felt a certain amount of
responsibility to him.

323
00:18:57,325 --> 00:19:00,580
To make that his life...
his death not be in vain,

324
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:05,910
meant that I had to try and advocate
for the justness that he was fighting for.

325
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:08,204
Because I believed that he was
fighting for his country.

326
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:10,718
<i>So I became involved
in the movement.</i>

327
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:21,757
With more and more soldiers
turning against the war

328
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:26,046
a handful of peace activists opened
the first of what would become a network

329
00:19:26,086 --> 00:19:28,854
of dozens of anti-war GI coffeehouses

330
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:32,133
located in the towns
that hovered near military bases.

331
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:36,876
The dusty Texas town of Killeen,
just outside Fort Hood,

332
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:39,348
which housed over 30,000 troops,

333
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:44,378
became the home of the GI coffee
house known as The Oleo Strut.

334
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:48,797
Being in the Army I can get over here
and I can sit down and write poetry

335
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:50,979
and I can stay here and listen,

336
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,556
and I can forget I'm in the Army

337
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,410
for about 15 minutes to an hour
or something like this.

338
00:19:55,459 --> 00:20:00,256
<i>We have three very simple rules here,
three very simple rules and that's all.</i>

339
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,876
One: We got no
holding in the place.

340
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,807
If you're holding,
this is a bad place to be.

341
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:08,351
The sign over there says the Man
is welcome.

342
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,518
So always remember the
Man is welcome here.

343
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:13,220
Not so much that he is welcome,
it's that he's just here.

344
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:20,675
<i>The name "Oleo Strut" came from
a shock absober on a helicopter.</i>

345
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:23,724
<i>So that's what the Oleo Strut was,
it was a place where</i>

346
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:28,219
<i>you go there and they sold sodas
and they had a record player,</i>

347
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:32,272
and all the latest rock records,
and underground papers and such.

348
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:37,685
<i>Fort Hood was both a combination
of guys going to Vietnam</i>

349
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,136
<i>and guys who'd been to Vietnam
and came back.</i>

350
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,592
And as time went on, the guys who'd
been to Vietnam

351
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:47,602
played a subversive role to the
guys who were going.

352
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:51,076
And they go out on ambushes.
Like for a one-month period,

353
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:53,860
we go out on ambushes and
we kill over 50 people

354
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,078
in the early hours of the morning

355
00:20:56,133 --> 00:21:00,050
and you start looking at bodies, because
they've got to get their body count.

356
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,623
And who's there?
A majority were women and children.

357
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,300
And what were they doing?
What was their crime?

358
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:06,673
They were carrying food...

359
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:10,961
They were carrying food
to their friends up in the hills.

360
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:16,727
and hopefully be a clerk typist
and not have to see any of that

361
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,245
he's making a mistake
because he's supporting the war.

362
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:24,167
<i>Body Count = how the US measured
success in Vietnam</i>

363
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:29,212
<i>I remember, probably one of
our campaings that was</i>

364
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:32,209
<i>a pretty good effort was
the Tyrrell's boycott.</i>

365
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:41,468
<i>Tyrrell's was a jewelry store that had a
number of bases throughout the country.</i>

366
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:45,174
<i>And they used to have
these guys standing out</i>

367
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:47,213
<i>on the sidewalk soliciting you.</i>

368
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:49,120
<i>GIs would come into
town and they'd say,</i>

369
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,140
<i>"Hey, why don't you buy
your mother a ring?</i>

370
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:53,307
<i>"Why don't you buy your
girlfriend a ring?"</i>

371
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:54,874
And particularly they were trying to get

372
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:56,689
the guys who were
going to go to Vietnam:

373
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,492
"Better buy something
for your mother.

374
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:01,261
"You might not get to see her again.
Something to remember you".

375
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:02,918
They'd be out there hustling.

376
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:07,413
And they knew all the different raps
to pull on a lonely GI's heart strings.

377
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:08,786
And then they used to have this deal

378
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:13,231
where if you bought the ring
and you were killed in Vietnam,

379
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:14,861
any payments were suspended.

380
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:17,000
The ring was paid off at that point.

381
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:21,050
And they put your name in the window
on Tyrrell's Roll Call of Honor.

382
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,365
<i>Which was outrageous
because it was like,</i>

383
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,227
<i>"Oh, you owe us money,
and you got killed,</i>

384
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,501
"so we're going to put your name in the
window to get some other guy to do it".

385
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:33,647
<i>So we decided to do a boycott
at the store in Killeem.</i>

386
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,985
<i>And we began picket lines
in front of the Tyrrell's place.</i>

387
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:41,940
<i>They arrested picketers several times.
We tried to maintain the picket lines.</i>

388
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:46,672
<i>started spreading to other
bases around the country,</i>

389
00:22:46,718 --> 00:22:49,524
<i>because word of our protest
started spreading.</i>

390
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,755
<i>There were GI activist groups all
over the country by this point.</i>

391
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:14,176
But along with the growth of the
Movement came the attacks.

392
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:18,024
The Shelter Half Coffeehouse
near Ft. Louis in Washington

393
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:20,686
was declared off limits
by the military.

394
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:23,278
And in Columbia, South Carolina,

395
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:26,284
the staff of the UFO
Coffeehouse was arrested

396
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:29,485
and charged with maintaining
a public nuisance.

397
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:32,412
Night Riders shot into a Movement

398
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:35,535
center near Camp Pendleton
Marine Base in California,

399
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,775
seriously wounding one marine.

400
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,619
And in Mountain Home, Idaho,

401
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:43,775
the Covered Wagon Coffeehouse was
firebombed and burned to the ground.

402
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:47,180
In the little town of
Muldraugh, Kentucky,

403
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:51,933
home of Fort Knox, a scene
worthy of Franz Kafka emerged.

404
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:59,423
And they did things like put up
pictures of Che Guevara.

405
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:03,619
They put up one whole wall was an
American flag painted upside-down.

406
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:05,581
The stars part of it was a toilet seat.

407
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:10,930
And if you lifted the toilet seat up,
there was Lyndon Johnson's picture.

408
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:14,823
And when the police officer who
came to examine the place saw that,

409
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:16,745
he just hit the roof.

410
00:24:16,814 --> 00:24:20,887
<i>I got sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky,
to protect the nation's gold supply.</i>

411
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:23,466
I got to Knox at a time
when their coffeehouse

412
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,279
was experiencing a lot of repression.

413
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:29,725
I spent 13 days in this little
jail that still had a trap door

414
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,462
from when they did lynchings
before the Civil War.

415
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:33,927
There was a hook up on the wall.

416
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:36,777
<i>What they were trying to
do was drive us out of town.</i>

417
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,384
But we weren't going away.

418
00:24:39,418 --> 00:24:43,022
<i>They indicted six
people for two offenses:</i>

419
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:49,902
one was maintaining a place visited
by idle and evil disposed people.

420
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:52,261
We always thought,
"idle and evil-disposed people".

421
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:53,756
You mean, like soldiers?

422
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:58,135
<i>The whole emphasis of the coffeehouse
in giving us an off-base center</i>

423
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:00,909
to congregate and meet
was a good thing.

424
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:05,249
But in defending those centers to exist,
it pulled us off the base,

425
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:09,484
which was where we were
effective and powerful.

426
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:11,170
When you put us in a coffeehouse,

427
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:13,925
we were just like a bunch of other
young people in a coffeehouse.

428
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:18,805
Put us in a barracks with a stack of
papers and half a dozen guys around us,

429
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:20,761
and we were fucking Atlas.

430
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,379
A new phenomenon has cropped up
at several army bases these days:

431
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:27,276
a so-called Underground GI Press,

432
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,815
which consists largely
of anti-war newspapers.

433
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:32,658
Military authorities are clamping
down hard on the papers.

434
00:25:33,188 --> 00:25:36,130
<i>There was an underground
newspaper laying on the bed,</i>

435
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:38,335
<i>and it was called the LAST HARASS.</i>

436
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:41,089
They freaked out, man.
They were freaking out.

437
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:45,649
This is unauthorized material,
and this is subversive material.

438
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,351
You're not allowed to have any copies
of this inside the barracks.

439
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:49,947
Go and turn this in immediately.

440
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:53,403
That night, then, the paper went
around in the barracks.

441
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:55,556
<i>Everyone is reading it,
two or three guys at a time,</i>

442
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:58,274
<i>sitting around on a bed, around
guys' beds and stuff like that,</i>

443
00:25:58,304 --> 00:25:59,465
<i>checking out this paper.</i>

444
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:02,722
<i>What I liked about it was the fact
that the officers hated it.</i>

445
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:05,425
To me, it had to be good.

446
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:07,964
There had to be something
about this that was good.

447
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:14,104
Typed, mimeographed, printed,
the G.I. Underground Press exploded.

448
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,924
<i>Fort Knox, Kentucky.
Fun, Travel, Adventure.</i>

449
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:19,516
<i>Fort Gordon, Georgia. The Last Harrass.
Fort Lewis, Washington. Fed up!</i>

450
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:20,811
<i>For Benning, Georgia. Rap!</i>

451
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,826
<i>Chanute Air Force Base.
Four Year Bummer.</i>

452
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,257
<i>Fort Dix, New Jersey. Shakedown.</i>

453
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:25,291
<i>Fort Worth, Texas.</i>

454
00:26:25,363 --> 00:26:28,127
<i>Fatigue Press is published
by a group of radical soldiers</i>

455
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:29,632
<i>stationed at this army base.</i>

456
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:33,172
And we used to distribute it
clandestinely on base.

457
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:36,408
We'd go around and leave bunches
of them in barrackses.

458
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:39,118
<i>We'd go through a barracks at night
and leave them in footlockers.</i>

459
00:26:39,153 --> 00:26:41,968
<i>If you were caught
distributing literature on base,</i>

460
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:47,389
Shortly after the first issue
was published,

461
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:50,741
the GI who founded the Fatigue Press,
Gypsy Peterson,

462
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,834
was pulled over by Fort Hood police.

463
00:26:52,864 --> 00:26:54,907
<i>And they vacuumed out his car,</i>

464
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:57,777
and claimed to find
remnants of marijuana.

465
00:26:57,837 --> 00:27:00,567
And arrested him for
possession of marijuana

466
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,577
in an attempt to suppress his movement.

467
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,381
Following a two-day
trial in a Texas court,

468
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,494
Gypsy Peterson was sentenced
to eight years in prison.

469
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,811
Despite the military's best efforts,

470
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:16,663
the Underground Press became
the lifeblood of the GI Movement.

471
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:21,099
And the Army's own recruiting slogan,
"Fun, Travel and Adventure,"

472
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:25,796
turned into the popular GI expression:
FUCK THE ARMY.

473
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,904
<i>There were close to
300 anti-war newspapers,</i>

474
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:33,217
<i>written, produced and published
on bases all throughout the world.</i>

475
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:37,296
Wherever there were
American GIs in the world.

476
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,091
Linking soldiers around the world,

477
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:43,714
the GI Press also inspired
many outside the military.

478
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:48,150
<i>I grew up believing that if our flag
was flying over a battlefield,</i>

479
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:49,477
that we were on the side of the angels.

480
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,158
My father fought in the
Second World War.

481
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:56,574
He won awards and medals.
And I grew up during the "good" wars.

482
00:27:56,623 --> 00:28:02,583
<i>Here's this woman who steps out
on the world stage as a famous actress,</i>

483
00:28:02,652 --> 00:28:05,618
<i>comes from one of the ruling class
families in Hollywood,</i>

484
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:09,628
<i>and makes a political decision
to change sides.</i>

485
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:13,392
She steps on to the side of the people,
particularly the Vietnamese people.

486
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:17,151
She stands with the GIs.
And she stands with the GI Movement.

487
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:19,413
And she says,
"I'm going to stand with this.

488
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:22,105
"I'm going to give vent. I'm going
to help support it and build it".

489
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,334
You know, etcetera, like that.
And the FTA Show --

490
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:27,281
Mr. President, there's a terrible
demonstration going on outside.

491
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,237
Oh, there's always a demonstration
going on outside, Pat.

492
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:32,290
But Richard, this one is
completely out of control.

493
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,050
What are they asking for this time?

494
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:36,237
Free Angela Davis
and all political prisoners,

495
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:39,330
OUT OF VIETNAM NOW,
and DRAFT ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

496
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:41,122
We have people to take care of that.

497
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:44,416
They'll do their job, you do your job,
and I'll do my job.

498
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:46,437
But Richard, you don't understand...
they're storming the White House.

499
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,981
Oh, in that case I better
call out the Third Marines.

500
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,246
- You can't, Richard.
- Why not?

501
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:50,825
It is the Third Marines!

502
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:55,552
For years, pro-war comedian Bob Hope

503
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:58,499
had toured Vietnam
entertaining American troops.

504
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:03,514
But soon the cheers turned to jeers,
and a new kind of entertainment emerged.

505
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:10,487
<i>Howard Levy, himself a celebrity
within the GI Movement,</i>

506
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:13,997
<i>he met with Donald Sutherland
and me and he said,</i>

507
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:19,197
"What if we put
together an anti-war show

508
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:24,691
"that's the opposite side of the
coin from the Bob Hope Show?"

509
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:29,188
# I went down to that base,
they took one look at my face,

510
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:32,345
# and read out an order to Barbie.

511
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:38,678
# I said Foxtrot, Tango, Alpha,
FREE THE ARMY!

512
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,994
"F" the Army.
We always said, "Free the Army,"

513
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:45,441
or "Fun, Travel and Adventure".

514
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:47,848
But it really meant, "F[uck] the Army".

515
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:50,825
# So we said "Foxtrot, Tango, Alpha,

516
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:56,782
# "FUCK THE ARMY AND
THE NAVY AND THE MARINES!"

517
00:29:56,832 --> 00:30:00,980
Here was a way that I could
combine my profession, my acting,

518
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:03,631
with my desire
to end the war.

519
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:05,660
It just seemed like a perfect fit.

520
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:09,676
<i>The show, the show that
we bring to these bases,</i>

521
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,441
<i>is not trying to tell the people on
the bases anything that they don't know.</i>

522
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:15,863
<i>We are coming in response
to what is probably</i>

523
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,065
<i>the most powerful Movement
going on in this country,</i>

524
00:30:18,104 --> 00:30:21,264
<i>the movement of the men inside
the military and the women</i>

525
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,694
<i>who are beginning to understand
how they are being used,</i>

526
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,288
<i>and what the nature of
American foreign policy is.</i>

527
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:28,769
<i>And we come there because
they have asked us to.</i>

528
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:32,155
<i>We come there because for the last year
we have read in the newspapers</i>

529
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:36,097
<i>from Vietnam, from West Germany,
from Okinawa, from the Philippines,</i>

530
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,902
<i>from Japan,
what we want is entertainment.</i>

531
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:41,143
<i>We want people who
speak to how we feel.</i>

532
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,657
<i>And the majority of us don't know
why we're going over there.</i>

533
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:45,085
<i>We don't know why
we're being shot at.</i>

534
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,667
<i>We don't know why our buddies
are being killed.</i>

535
00:30:46,682 --> 00:30:49,050
<i>We don't know why
we're killing those people.</i>

536
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:53,620
<i>If it had been another time and place,
and another war,</i>

537
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:55,802
<i>I might have actually
been a very good soldier,</i>

538
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:59,621
<i>because there is part of the military
life that I really liked.</i>

539
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,195
This replaced my dogtags.

540
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,176
This little tear-drop peace sign
became my official dogtag for myself.

541
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:13,421
I went through my whole tour in Vietnam
without a set of dogtags.

542
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:19,444
Anything but thinking about
where you were.

543
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:21,770
When you started thinking
about where you were,

544
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:23,363
that's when you started
getting in trouble.

545
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:25,103
And that's when I started
getting in trouble.

546
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:32,813
It was when I started really seeing,

547
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:44,482
stuff like I'm seeing right now.

548
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:03,477
You know, the way we judged
our success was through body count.

549
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:11,978
And most of the time, even though
I was part of the command structure,

550
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:16,115
being first a squad leader
and then a platoon sergeant,

551
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:28,652
to do things like check the bodies.

552
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,445
But I never wanted to do that.

553
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:41,992
That's not what I want to do,
or understand I was doing.

554
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:46,062
I was brought into the Company office

555
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:52,095
and I was told by a major
that I would be brought up on charges

556
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:57,476
of leading and conspiring to mutiny
against the United States government,

557
00:32:57,548 --> 00:33:01,959
because there were three of us who
were refusing to go on combat operations.

558
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,833
And so I walked out of there
in shock thinking,

559
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:13,885
well, I'm going to jail
for a long time.

560
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,539
<i>I didn't know there was
a GI Movement.</i>

561
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:21,717
<i>I just had this strong moral sense
of something not being right.</i>

562
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:27,286
Then they sent me to see
the "Company Shrink".

563
00:33:27,335 --> 00:33:28,969
He said, "Well, what are you really
concerned about?"

564
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:31,234
And I said, "I don't care
about prison time,

565
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:39,320
"I just want to have some
connection with my home".

566
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,312
I didn't want to be ostracized
from American culture and society.

567
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:46,486
And he said, "Well, let me
show you something".

568
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:50,284
And he reached into
some drawer that he had,

569
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:55,118
<i>and he pulled out this New York Times
newspaper and there was a full page ad</i>

570
00:33:55,156 --> 00:34:00,169
that had many signatures of all these
people who were opposed to the war.

571
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:07,861
<i>It was a full page advertisement
signed by 1,400 active duty soldiers,</i>

572
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:11,771
denouncing the war and supporting
the November 15th demonstration,

573
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:14,314
<i>the November 15th moratorium
demonstration.</i>

574
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:18,470
<i>The discussion started going, saying,
"Man, why don't we do something?</i>

575
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,869
"On this day, November 15th, we're
all going to wear these black armbands

576
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,620
as a form of symbolic solidarity with
the protesting in the United States.

577
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,702
<i>We were up all night long just talking
about this, and I couldn't sleep.</i>

578
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:35,143
<i>There was no way.
I was so excited by this point.</i>

579
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:39,407
So we go out in the morning formation,
all our guys had black shoestrings on.

580
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:43,176
We get over to the combat engineers,
now, though, there was a different story.

581
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,741
The Company commander had grabbed,
had some guy by the collar,

582
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:50,050
and had his .45 pistol up to his head.

583
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,927
You could vaguely hear
him threatening this guy

584
00:34:52,986 --> 00:34:56,437
to summarily
execute him on the spot,

585
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:58,255
because he's inciting a mutiny.

586
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,562
<i>I've seen Charlie, Luke the Gook,
whatever you want to call him, NVA,</i>

587
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:05,772
<i>right there laying
down as I walked by.</i>

588
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:08,600
I looked at him, he looks at me.
I keep going about my business.

589
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,458
This man isn't doing me nothing.
He ain't hurting me in no type of way.

590
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:13,529
He ain't hurtin' none of my black people,
none of my families.

591
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:15,120
So why should I shoot him?

592
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,773
I feel all black men should be exempt
from military duty anyway,

593
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:24,493
because the only place
a Black man should fight

594
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:26,714
is where he is being oppressed.

595
00:35:26,763 --> 00:35:28,139
I'm not being oppressed in Japan.

596
00:35:28,188 --> 00:35:31,904
I'm not being oppressed in Vietnam.
And I'm not being oppressed in Pakistan.

597
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:34,311
<i>Guys were coming from
all over the country,</i>

598
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:36,649
so you getting people coming
in with different information

599
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:41,056
about black power struggle at that time,
and black unity,

600
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,473
<i>and feeling real good about yourself.</i>

601
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:46,291
<i>You had to really question
what you were doing in Vietnam.</i>

602
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,090
I remember one day this 1st Sergeant
was talking about gooks.

603
00:35:57,115 --> 00:36:00,699
To show you how naive I was,
I didn't know that gook was a racial slur.

604
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:02,595
I didn't really understand that.

605
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:05,928
And one day he was talking
about gooks and I remember,

606
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,420
a light went off in my head, and I said,

607
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:09,916
"Wow! A gook is the
same thing as a nigger".

608
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:16,974
<i>During my whole tour in Vietnam,
when you met a black soldier,</i>

609
00:36:20,196 --> 00:36:22,470
You got to the point
where you could even tell

610
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:25,073
what part of the country he was from,

611
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:28,701
because everybody had their
distinctive dap, or handshake.

612
00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:30,647
<i>You definitely could tell
if he wasn't in your Company,</i>

613
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:33,172
<i>because everybody had
their little nuance.</i>

614
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:36,380
This is the greeting.
This is the greeting of my brother.

615
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,537
I'm glad to see him.
I don't have to know his name.

616
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,900
Just the fact that he is
black is good enough for me.

617
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,408
You know, we got a common ground.

618
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:55,130
They slap this way, this way,
then fist, fist, then high,

619
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,287
and then down this way like this.

620
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:58,987
Oh, let's do this one again.
I like it.

621
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,732
You come down, you grab...

622
00:37:03,884 --> 00:37:05,640
There you go! That's it!

623
00:37:06,112 --> 00:37:09,744
Like in the Marine Corp., the bloods,
especially on the bases,

624
00:37:09,798 --> 00:37:13,726
they been going to jail for doing
the dap, the power, the handshake.

625
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:15,349
This is the way we greet each other.

626
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:19,266
They been going to jail for doing it.
Just for doing it.

627
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:26,614
<i>Long Binh Jail was the stockade
in Long Binh, Vietnam.</i>

628
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:31,078
<i>It was pretty much just like
jails in America: 99.9% black.</i>

629
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:33,458
<i>There was a lot of violence
in this prison.</i>

630
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:36,306
<i>A lot of stuff going on.
People were angry.</i>

631
00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:38,629
<i>It was a pretty dire situation.</i>

632
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:41,720
<i>A group of inmates got together</i>

633
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,741
<i>and we decided that we were
going to escape from this place.</i>

634
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:51,854
And what happened was that as a result,
there was a Long Binh rebellion,

635
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:55,873
<i>where a lot of GIs accosted guards.</i>

636
00:37:55,927 --> 00:38:00,726
<i>And they burnt down the jail.
And there was just mayhem.</i>

637
00:38:02,302 --> 00:38:06,716
I'm a survivor, so I was going
to survive no matter what.

638
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,706
<i>During the Vietnam war,</i>

639
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:19,666
<i>the Pentagon documented 503,926
"incidents of desertion".</i>

640
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:26,905
<i>The President shook my hand,
and pinned a medal on me.</i>

641
00:38:26,965 --> 00:38:31,275
You can say that that was one
of the most proudest moments of my life.

642
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:35,420
<i>How did you come
to the decision to desert?</i>

643
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,468
You know, when you land on your back,

644
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:40,130
and you can't move
for day in and day out,

645
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:42,541
you have a lot of time to think.

646
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:48,529
So you think about what you did,
what you've done,

647
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:52,103
the thing that you've gone through,
people that you've killed,

648
00:38:53,046 --> 00:38:55,200
the people that have died.

649
00:38:55,605 --> 00:39:01,263
I mean, there's always something
that reminds you of the thing

650
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:05,102
that you've done in Vietnam,
the things that you've seen.

651
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:12,704
Then you actually see what I saw,
what was going on in the States,

652
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,702
dudes are running down the streets

653
00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:20,125
and wearing the same kind
of uniform that I got.

654
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:25,843
<i>They're in Memphis.
They were beating up on people.</i>

655
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:31,760
<i>Wait a minute! We're over here
beating up on people over here,</i>

656
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:37,720
and then you're beating up
on black people,

657
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,065
dogs are running everywhere,
tanks are on the streets...

658
00:39:42,027 --> 00:39:44,201
In the summer of 1968,

659
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:47,410
Army and National Guard troops
were sent into American cities

660
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:49,495
as thousands of black people rioted

661
00:39:49,537 --> 00:39:52,263
following the assassination
of Martin Luther King.

662
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:55,453
That Spring, troops were used

663
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:58,138
against anti-war
demonstrators at the Pentagon.

664
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:03,861
Then in August, soldiers at Fort Hood
were told they would be sent to Chicago

665
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:06,234
where anti-war
demonstrations were planned

666
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:08,809
for the Democratic Party's
national convention.

667
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,566
<i>We had just come back from
fighting the Vietnamese.</i>

668
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:13,960
<i>Now they want us to
fight the Americans.</i>

669
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:17,807
The night before the troops
were supposed to leave,

670
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:22,490
there was a meeting of black GIs
that gathered up in a parking lot

671
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,814
<i>in the First Armored Division section.</i>

672
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,467
<i>And they were out there all night
in the parking lot talking,</i>

673
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:29,869
<i>and you know, they were having
like a rap session or rally,</i>

674
00:40:29,932 --> 00:40:33,492
why they were opposed
to going to Chicago.

675
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,521
We were making it clear that it was a
genocidal thing that was going to go on.

676
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:41,782
And how can I go and commit genocide
on my people, shoot my people?

677
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:45,149
<i>There were hundreds of
black GIs out in that field.</i>

678
00:40:45,203 --> 00:40:48,473
<i>Brothers came up and really
started pouring it on then</i>

679
00:40:48,526 --> 00:40:52,166
about discrimination
and unfair treatment,

680
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:54,112
<i>not getting the rank they needed,</i>

681
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:57,440
<i>and about what was
happening with the war.</i>

682
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,347
As the meeting stretched
into the night,

683
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:04,058
Fort Hood's commanding general
showed up to talk to the GIs.

684
00:41:04,137 --> 00:41:07,568
"You see, I'm just a two-star general.
Let me go talk to my boss,

685
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:09,651
and I'll have an answer
for you in the morning".

686
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:12,578
So we just relaxed,
you know, went to sleep.

687
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:15,786
All of a sudden,
crack up side the head.

688
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:19,089
They cracked me upside
the head, you know.

689
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,594
What the hell is going on?
MPs all around us, man.

690
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:24,624
They came at us with bayonets.

691
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:27,869
I got cut. I got hit right
here with a bayonet.

692
00:41:27,938 --> 00:41:33,276
And then every now and then
they opened this formation up,

693
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:37,237
and a group of MPs come
in and grab a brother

694
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,251
and take him back in the back,
and beat the shit out of him.

695
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:45,889
He was screaming in the back.
Damn!

696
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:48,985
<i>And they were court-martialed,</i>

697
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,378
<i>brought up on various
court-martial charges.</i>

698
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:53,883
<i>But it scared the
hell out of the military.</i>

699
00:41:56,376 --> 00:42:00,934
and went through the roster of all
the units who were supposed to go,

700
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:04,921
and took off who they considered
"subversive".

701
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,916
So a number of people, myself included,
were not sent to Chicago.

702
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:13,184
In one of the most infamous
events of the 1960s,

703
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:16,201
Chicago police brutally
attacked the demonstrators

704
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:18,290
in front of the Democratic Convention.

705
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,125
Although the Army had
sent a contingent

706
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:27,312
of riot control troops
to Chicago from Ft. Hood,

707
00:42:27,365 --> 00:42:28,915
they kept them off the streets.

708
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:32,522
It was no longer certain which
side the GIs were on.

709
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:35,566
The military had a problem on its hands

710
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:38,321
and it was about to
go from bad to worse.

711
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:42,778
We were in the
breakfast line, I believe.

712
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:44,532
It was a long line.

713
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:46,164
<i>All of a sudden,
we see this commotion</i>

714
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:47,924
<i>kind of start at the
beginning of the line,</i>

715
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:50,135
<i>and then start
to come up towards us.</i>

716
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:51,485
<i>And we could see people,</i>

717
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,780
<i>like one guy would turn
to the guy behind him</i>

718
00:42:53,814 --> 00:42:56,103
and there would be
this excited conversation,

719
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:58,422
and then that guy would turn
to the guy behind him.

720
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:02,200
<i>And finally the guy in
front of me got the news,</i>

721
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:04,396
and he turns around
and he says to me,

722
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:07,328
"They are killing women
and children in Vietnam".

723
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:10,540
And I said, "Who's killing women
and children? The Vietcong?"

724
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:12,729
And he said, "No, we are".

725
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:18,659
March 16, 1968, the soldiers
of Charlie Company,

726
00:43:18,707 --> 00:43:23,076
11th Brigade, Americal Division,
entered the village of My Lai.

727
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:28,723
24 hours later over 500 villagers,
men, women and children,

728
00:43:28,777 --> 00:43:32,521
lay dead, brutally and wantonly
murdered in cold blood.

729
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:35,159
Around the world,
the My Lai massacre

730
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:38,164
would become the touchstone
event of the Vietnam War.

731
00:43:38,231 --> 00:43:43,154
For over a year, the American military
covered up the My Lai massacre,

732
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:45,894
claiming only enemy
soldiers were killed.

733
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:49,683
And when the truth was finally
brought to light by journalists,

734
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:52,197
the highest ranking
officer tried and convicted

735
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:54,835
was William Calley, a lieutenant.

736
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,391
In a cramped, Detroit hotel,
a new organization,

737
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,812
Vietnam Veterans Against the War,

738
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:09,587
held an unprecedented investigation
that exposed a much deeper truth.

739
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,950
I think the Winter Soldier Investigation
was to try to point out,

740
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:14,778
it wasn't really in defense of Calley

741
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:20,372
but it was going after the notion
that the policies of the U.S. Military

742
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:23,063
created things like My Lai.
Okay?

743
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:24,426
That it was a policy.

744
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:26,877
It was both a written and
an unwritten policy.

745
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,015
And the truth has to be told.
You can't duck away from the truth.

746
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,485
You can't lie and put up
a smokescreen and say, "Oh"

747
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,304
- this was the words
they used back then -

748
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:37,852
"an isolated instance
of aberrant behavior".

749
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:40,156
You weren't just coming home saying,
"I'm against the war".

750
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,093
You're saying,
"This is what we did.

751
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,319
"This is how we did it.
This was a crime.

752
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:45,481
"This was wrong".

753
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,206
It helped people to
really cross the bridge,

754
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,334
and to see us in a way that I think

755
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:53,172
the anti-war movement had
not seen GIs before.

756
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:57,951
America went through a choke, okay,

757
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:02,020
because they didn't want
to believe that these things occurred

758
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,321
in the name
of the American people

759
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,498
supposedly supporting
freedom and liberation

760
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:09,194
and democracy
throughout the world.

761
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:13,502
And there was this terrible slaughter.
This terrible, inane slaughter.

762
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:15,423
<i>So I think the question was,</i>

763
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:19,365
"Why are they going after Calley
where Calley was doing precisely

764
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:22,759
"what we were all told to
do when we were in Vietnam, essentially,

765
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:26,100
"which is kill
them all, and sort it out later".

766
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:31,324
<i>In Quang Tri City, I had a friend
who was an adviser with an ARVN group,</i>

767
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:34,618
<i>and one time he asked me if I would like
to accompany him into a village</i>

768
00:45:34,676 --> 00:45:37,422
<i>that I was familiar
with to see how they act.</i>

769
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:38,982
So I went with him,

770
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,605
and they didn't find any enemy,
but they found a woman with bandages.

771
00:45:42,672 --> 00:45:46,884
So she was questioned by six ARVNs.

772
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:51,460
And the way they questioned her,
since she had bandages, they shot her.

773
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,951
She was hit about twenty times.

774
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,310
After she was questioned,
and of course dead,

775
00:45:56,378 --> 00:46:01,695
this guy came over,
who was a former major,

776
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:03,126
been in the service
for twenty years,

777
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,317
and he got hungry
again and came back over

778
00:46:05,386 --> 00:46:09,400
working with USAID,
Aid International Development.

779
00:46:09,456 --> 00:46:15,992
He went over there, ripped her
clothes off and took a knife and cut,

780
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:20,319
from her vagina all the way up,
just about up to her breasts,

781
00:46:20,387 --> 00:46:23,594
and pulled her organs out,
completely out of her cavity,

782
00:46:23,638 --> 00:46:24,956
and threw them out.

783
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:26,673
Then he stopped and knelt over

784
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:29,581
and commenced to peel every
bit of skin off her body,

785
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:33,081
and left her there as a sign
for something or other.

786
00:46:33,145 --> 00:46:36,737
And so I gave other testimony,
the one about the rabbit lesson,

787
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,923
which I thought was very important,
and I still think it is.

788
00:46:38,977 --> 00:46:41,795
And that was at the end
of staging battalion

789
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:44,919
at the Camp Pendleton
base in California

790
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:46,546
for the marines before
you went to Vietnam ...

791
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:49,030
<i>... where the staff NCO comes out
and he has a rabbit.</i>

792
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:52,134
<i>And he's talking to you about escape
and evasion and survival in the jungle,</i>

793
00:46:52,183 --> 00:46:53,752
and he has this rabbit.

794
00:46:53,796 --> 00:46:55,128
And in a couple of seconds,

795
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:57,682
after everyone practically
falls in love with it -

796
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,677
not falls in love with it,
but they're humane -

797
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:04,600
he cracks its neck, skins it,
disembowels it,

798
00:47:04,644 --> 00:47:07,845
just like I testified that this
happened to the woman.

799
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,389
He does this to a rabbit, and they
throw the guts out into the audience..."

800
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:14,026
... and takes the skin of the rabbit
and turns it inside out

801
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:17,933
and makes a little bootie
for his foot, and says,

802
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:22,531
or you're separated from your unit".

803
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,075
And I thought, the subtext
of that little lesson

804
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:28,713
was to completely brutalize people.

805
00:47:28,786 --> 00:47:30,233
You can get anything
out of that you want,

806
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:33,880
but that's your last lesson you catch in
the US before you leave for Vietnam.

807
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,130
And I went and listened to
the three days of testimony,

808
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,155
and absolutely came away from it
emotionally drained and floored by it.

809
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:44,570
I never grasped,
even up to that point,

810
00:47:44,634 --> 00:47:51,281
how powerful was the
genocidal plans and strategy

811
00:47:51,345 --> 00:47:53,252
<i>of the U.S. towards
the Vietnamese people.</i>

812
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:57,434
On every level, whether
it was Agent Orange,

813
00:47:57,512 --> 00:48:00,978
and Dow Chemical, we configure it.

814
00:48:01,022 --> 00:48:05,537
The Napalm, because the Napalm wasn't
sticking to the Vietnamese skin enough.

815
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:10,748
<i>All of this just added
to the overwhelming sense

816
00:48:10,816 --> 00:48:13,389
<i>of the criminality of the United States.</i>

817
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:18,373
Claiming to have a secret
plan to end the war,

818
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,982
Richard Nixon had been
elected President in 1968.

819
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:25,349
But in 1970, he expanded the war,

820
00:48:25,418 --> 00:48:29,443
ordering an invasion of
Cambodia, Vietnam's neighbor.

821
00:48:35,182 --> 00:48:39,888
and during that time
Nixon invaded Cambodia,

822
00:48:39,952 --> 00:48:44,132
<i>four students were killed at Kent State,
two were killed at Jackson State.</i>

823
00:48:44,181 --> 00:48:46,905
I mean, it was something.

824
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,989
As anger over the invasion
and killings exploded,

825
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:52,190
the GI Movement entered a new era.

826
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:55,622
This was Armed Forces Day,
and in many cities across the country

827
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,312
there were the usual
parades, displays and bands.

828
00:48:58,381 --> 00:49:01,426
But the recent surge of protest
over the war in Indochina

829
00:49:01,489 --> 00:49:03,921
cast a shadow over today's activities.

830
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:06,073
This was even true at
some military bases,

831
00:49:06,137 --> 00:49:08,107
where the presence of
anti-war demonstrators

832
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:10,940
led to the cancellation
of planned observances.

833
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:15,107
<i>A thousand GIs marched
the first year right outside the base.</i>

834
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,505
<i>And they told people it was off limits.</i>

835
00:49:17,543 --> 00:49:20,470
<i>And they told people if you went there,
you were going to get arrested.</i>

836
00:49:20,528 --> 00:49:25,392
The store owners downtown were putting
up plywood coverings on their windows,

837
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:28,656
<i>because the cops told them it
was going to turn into a riot.</i>

838
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:32,093
But then people decided to change it
to Armed Farces Day because, you know,

839
00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:37,010
<i>we thought making fun of your enemy
was as valuable as yelling at them.</i>

840
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,319
<i>And in Killeen we had three demands.</i>

841
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:43,191
We had some pretty extremist slogans:

842
00:49:43,235 --> 00:49:48,559
AVENGE THE KENT STATE AND
JACKSON STATE KILLINGS, END THE WAR.

843
00:49:48,642 --> 00:49:52,941
The third slogan, I think, had to do
with the political prisoners going,

844
00:49:54,398 --> 00:49:58,966
the Black Panther Party was
starting to gain some strength,

845
00:49:59,025 --> 00:50:00,916
and there was repression against them.

846
00:50:00,991 --> 00:50:07,579
<i>The second year, 1971, there had to be
3,000-4,000 on the streets.</i>

847
00:50:30,901 --> 00:50:37,197
<i>I had quite a few letters recently
concerning some of the different items</i>

848
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:41,597
<i>that Radio First Termer
has to offer its followers.</i>

849
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:47,553
<i>And one of the biggest things is
the Official Dave Rabbit Sweatshirt.</i>

850
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,407
<i>For those of you who are unaware</i>

851
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:53,735
<i>of what a Dave Rabbit
Sweatshirt is, I'll tell you.</i>

852
00:50:53,814 --> 00:50:57,667
<i>It's a white sweatshirt.</i>

853
00:50:58,811 --> 00:51:03,623
<i>On the front of it it
has a large white rabbit,</i>

854
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:07,813
<i>and the rabbit's dick
is completely hard.</i>

855
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:13,128
<i>The rabbit is carrying a sign.
On the sign it reads,</i>

856
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:17,735
<i>"Fuck it before it fucks you".</i>

857
00:51:18,963 --> 00:51:23,929
<i>By every conceivable indicator,
our Army that now remains in Vietnam</i>

858
00:51:23,983 --> 00:51:26,463
<i>is in a state approaching collapse</i>

859
00:51:26,502 --> 00:51:31,066
<i>with individual units avoiding
or having refused combat,</i>

860
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:34,521
<i>murdering their officers and
non-commissioned officers,</i>

861
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,831
<i>drug-ridden and dispirited
where not near mutinous.</i>

862
00:51:40,022 --> 00:51:45,137
In the face of a determined enemy,
an unprecedented anti-war movement,

863
00:51:45,193 --> 00:51:47,293
and a military near collapse,

864
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,693
the Nixon administration announced
the policy of Vietnamization,

865
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:56,660
an effort to shift the burden of combat
to the South Vietnamese Army

866
00:51:56,709 --> 00:52:01,179
while American jets bombarded
North Vietnam from the skies.

867
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:03,944
Nixon promised that
American ground troops

868
00:52:04,012 --> 00:52:06,743
would no longer be involved
in offensive combat.

869
00:52:08,694 --> 00:52:11,707
<i>This is Richard Boyle,
Fire Base Pace,</i>

870
00:52:11,776 --> 00:52:14,472
<i>about two kilometers
from the Cambodian border.</i>

871
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:18,399
<i>I'm sitting in a bunker with about
a dozen grunts of the 1st Cav. Division...</i>

872
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:20,423
<i>A lot of people were kind of wondering</i>

873
00:52:20,478 --> 00:52:23,468
<i>if anybody back in the world
knows that we're out here.</i>

874
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:29,125
<i>Like they say that only two batteries
of artillery are supposed to be here,</i>

875
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:30,595
<i>and no grunts are here.</i>

876
00:52:30,654 --> 00:52:34,384
<i>We don't even exist. We're just meat.</i>

877
00:52:34,453 --> 00:52:36,635
American troops were
not supposed to be in combat.

878
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:40,523
That's why the American Army
denied that they were there.

879
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:43,401
As far as the briefers in Saigon,

880
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,377
there were no American
troops along the border.

881
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,278
<i>Does anybody know
what we're fighting for?</i>

882
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,394
<i>Do you believe we're fighting
for democracy here?</i>

883
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:53,151
<i>Actually, I'll tell you, the only thing
you're fighting for is your own life.</i>

884
00:52:53,228 --> 00:52:54,666
<i>You're fighting to go back home.</i>

885
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:57,385
<i>The North Vietnamese,
they had two regiments,</i>

886
00:52:57,459 --> 00:53:00,695
<i>two crack regiments,
totally surrounding the fire base.</i>

887
00:53:00,757 --> 00:53:03,219
<i>And it's plain suicide going out there
in the middle of the night.</i>

888
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:05,627
<i>There's a thing about
giving an order,</i>

889
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,627
<i>and there's a thing about
using your head, too.</i>

890
00:53:07,676 --> 00:53:10,834
<i>It's always the higher-highers, man.
They don't have to go out there.</i>

891
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:12,570
<i>They can send us out there.</i>

892
00:53:12,638 --> 00:53:16,339
<i>As soon as we start going out there,
we'll be sitting ducks.</i>

893
00:53:16,397 --> 00:53:21,148
The Captain ordered six men
to go out on a night ambush,

894
00:53:21,195 --> 00:53:23,133
which is basically a suicide mission

895
00:53:23,206 --> 00:53:25,737
if you send six guys out
against two regiments.

896
00:53:25,815 --> 00:53:29,480
And they said, "We ain't going
to do it. We ain't going to go".

897
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:32,842
And the only option was to get
word out to the outside world.

898
00:53:32,886 --> 00:53:34,383
And they wrote a petition.

899
00:53:34,431 --> 00:53:39,337
<i>At this writing we are under
siege in Fire Base Pace.</i>

900
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:44,028
<i>We are faced daily with a decision
of whether to take a court-martial</i>

901
00:53:44,082 --> 00:53:46,675
<i>or participate in offensive action.</i>

902
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:49,763
<i>In the event of mass
prosecution of our unit,</i>

903
00:53:49,808 --> 00:53:53,857
<i>our only hope would be
public opinion and your voice.</i>

904
00:53:57,678 --> 00:54:01,334
<i>Nixon was so afraid,
that he ordered that company pulled out.</i>

905
00:54:01,398 --> 00:54:03,261
They sent in another company.

906
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:07,133
They had heard about
the refusal of Alpha Company.

907
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:09,859
The other company
also refused to fight.

908
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:13,927
And after that, no company, no troops
in Vietnam were willing to fight.

909
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:16,028
They said, "Look, we're not going
to fight anymore".

910
00:54:16,094 --> 00:54:19,488
There are more problems to
winding down the Vietnam War

911
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:21,385
than just holding the enemy at bay,

912
00:54:21,444 --> 00:54:24,062
and moving South Vietnamese
troops into the line.

913
00:54:24,131 --> 00:54:27,969
One unforeseen problem
is trying to keep up the morale of GIs

914
00:54:28,038 --> 00:54:30,478
who know they're going home,
but not soon enough.

915
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:32,934
It has produced
flagrant insubordination,

916
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:37,608
shooting of officers by their own men,
and a deadly practice called "fragging".

917
00:54:37,668 --> 00:54:43,775
The purpose in my mind was either
to get me or intimidate myself

918
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,314
and all others in authority in
the company and the battalion.

919
00:54:48,393 --> 00:54:49,943
Sergeant Gene Tingly is saying

920
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,511
that some of his own men
tried to maim or kill him.

921
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,428
But it's not an isolated incident.

922
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:58,246
Since then, one officer has been killed,
and another wounded at this base.

923
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,858
And there have been dozens of similar
incidents all across South Vietnam.

924
00:55:01,942 --> 00:55:04,992
I've seen more than
one big group meeting

925
00:55:05,045 --> 00:55:10,147
where actually all they talk about
is fragging, as we call them, "pigs".

926
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:14,765
By "pigs," you're talking about your
senior enlisted men and your officers?

927
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:17,971
That's correct. That's one of
our most common terms.

928
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,448
Because the fragmentation
grenade is often the weapon used,

929
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:24,795
the violent attacks on authority
have come to be known as "fragging".

930
00:55:24,874 --> 00:55:29,497
And many GIs talk openly about fragging
and the military counter-measures.

931
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,819
<i>A fragmentation grenade was thrown into</i>

932
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:44,456
the quarters of
some officers, two killed.

933
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:51,261
<i>Billy was almost immediately
placed under arrest.</i>

934
00:55:51,353 --> 00:55:53,373
<i>Things just developed from there.</i>

935
00:55:53,445 --> 00:55:59,035
I was chosen for the trial because
I was an outspoken critic of the war.

936
00:55:59,098 --> 00:56:00,945
He would speak his peace,
you know,

937
00:56:00,988 --> 00:56:02,880
if I don't like someone
I'll tell you about it.

938
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,469
This war wasn't meant for me.
It wasn't meant for us.

939
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:08,744
I mean, black men,
because we're not your slave.

940
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,875
And he would let them know:
I don't care to do everything you say.

941
00:56:12,944 --> 00:56:16,381
And they had some vendetta
against him for speaking his mind.

942
00:56:16,468 --> 00:56:19,283
<i>The irony of why he got
selected for prosecution,</i>

943
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,268
<i>you could almost
say a comedy of errors,</i>

944
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:26,516
<i>his commanding officer decided that
he must have been the target because</i>

945
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:29,118
he was planning to send Billy home.

946
00:56:29,196 --> 00:56:33,858
Now, to us, that was absolutely absurd.

947
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:37,133
If Billy thought he was being
sent home, he would have swam home.

948
00:56:37,182 --> 00:56:41,270
None of the original evidence
pointed to Billy at all.

949
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,863
Eyewitness descriptions
did not match Billy.

950
00:56:43,936 --> 00:56:48,295
And as it turned out later,
he was off some place getting high.

951
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:51,932
<i>The case was really a
milestone in many ways</i>

952
00:56:51,996 --> 00:56:56,637
<i>because it was the case that
surfaced the issue of fragging.</i>

953
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:04,838
The message did get out among
the soldiers what was going on

954
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:07,131
and how we needed their support...

955
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,587
<i>And in our wildest dreams
we would have never realized</i>

956
00:57:09,647 --> 00:57:12,774
<i>people cared that much about
the Movement and what was going on.</i>

957
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:18,558
<i>A lot of Vietnam veterans came to
the trial and were there to show support.</i>

958
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:23,573
<i>It crystallized a lot of issues,
and racism not least.</i>

959
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:29,607
May I say that our system of military
justice is still riddled with injustice.

960
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:33,299
"Prosecution witness confesses
Army made him lie".

961
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:36,024
<i>I mean, that would happen
all through the trial.</i>

962
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:39,215
<i>The whole thing was just bizarre
from start to finish.</i>

963
00:57:39,273 --> 00:57:40,852
And of course, before it was over,

964
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:42,877
the Army would try to
manufacture evidence

965
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:47,308
with these grenade pins that
they said that they could match.

966
00:57:47,387 --> 00:57:49,635
<i>And it turned out that
it was impossible.</i>

967
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:51,904
<i>There was no such science at all.</i>

968
00:57:51,996 --> 00:57:55,684
No matter how hard they tried,
the case just wouldn't hold together.

969
00:57:55,752 --> 00:58:00,934
It is clear that the Army
had no evidence of my guilt.

970
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,307
Smiling Billy Dean Smith
Was Acquitted Today.

971
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:11,660
When the verdict was read,
I mean it was like pandemonium.

972
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:15,035
Everybody, the cameras, everything,
we piled out the door.

973
00:58:15,118 --> 00:58:18,368
It was one of the best days of my life.

974
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:22,564
I was simply singled out as
a scapegoat for the fraggings

975
00:58:22,637 --> 00:58:26,545
which had occurred in the
last four years in Vietnam,

976
00:58:26,613 --> 00:58:30,653
and which reflects a low state
of morale among enlisted men.

977
00:58:33,568 --> 00:58:36,050
<i>Billy was, in my impression
of him anyway,</i>

978
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,108
<i>he was a gentle person.</i>

979
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:43,270
He was drafted, and in a matter
of months was in the killing fields.

980
00:58:43,343 --> 00:58:45,897
That in itself was a trauma.

981
00:58:45,985 --> 00:58:49,746
Then once he was arrested for
this crime he didn't commit,

982
00:58:49,804 --> 00:58:51,236
they put him in isolation.

983
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:55,225
22 months, and he was only
out one hour a day out of 24.

984
00:58:55,318 --> 00:58:56,404
Solitary.

985
00:58:56,457 --> 00:58:59,463
You sitting up there that long,
you're going to automatically go crazy

986
00:58:59,532 --> 00:59:03,087
looking at yourself, and your hands,
and fingers, and toes, and that's it.

987
00:59:03,145 --> 00:59:07,654
And he got back to the United States,
but his health has been destroyed.

988
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:09,342
His mind has been destroyed.

989
00:59:09,411 --> 00:59:14,053
Periodically he gets medicated.
Periodically he's been hospitalized.

990
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,209
But without pretty constant supervision,

991
00:59:17,273 --> 00:59:24,039
he stops taking the medication,
and then reverts to the terrors.

992
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:30,108
<i>In 2004, Billy Dean Smith was
living on the streets of Los Angeles.</i>

993
00:59:30,157 --> 00:59:34,730
<i>He is currently serving 10 years
in a California State Prison.</i>

994
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:36,803
<i>His family is fighting for his release.</i>

995
00:59:36,837 --> 00:59:39,458
While Billy Dean Smith
was in solitary confinement,

996
00:59:39,524 --> 00:59:43,026
the House Internal Security Committee
of the United States Congress

997
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:45,637
held a series of hearings
on the GI Movement.

998
00:59:45,705 --> 00:59:48,716
The Congressmen declared
there was no Movement,

999
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:53,437
only a handful of what they called
militant extremists of the far left.

1000
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,246
But the hearings, spanning nine months,
produced thousands of pages of testimony

1001
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:02,159
illustrating how broadly and deeply
the GI Movement had spread.

1002
01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:06,315
Many of us were very convinced
Nixon had to go to an air war

1003
01:00:06,384 --> 01:00:08,259
because he couldn't
trust us on the ground.

1004
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:10,039
And for good reason:
we were shooting his officers

1005
01:00:10,093 --> 01:00:14,162
and refusing direct orders to go
into combat where we could.

1006
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:17,436
And he had to go to an air war
where there is no relationship,

1007
01:00:17,505 --> 01:00:19,952
it's totally impersonal, you know.

1008
01:00:20,012 --> 01:00:22,643
The pilots fly from Guam
1,000 miles away.

1009
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,942
They drop several tons, how many
tons of bombs, and they fly back again.

1010
01:00:26,986 --> 01:00:28,099
<i>They don't see the damage.</i>

1011
01:00:28,144 --> 01:00:31,531
<i>There is no relationship to what
they do, their job, to people's lives.</i>

1012
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,922
<i>I still wanted to fly.</i>

1013
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,600
I was getting the impression
that the war was wrong,

1014
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:40,447
I was going to be part of it,
I wasn't going to be carrying a gun,

1015
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:43,315
I wasn't going to be physically
shooting these people...

1016
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:45,613
it was rationalization on my part.

1017
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,382
But I still wanted to fly.

1018
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:50,799
I still wanted to have
that experience.

1019
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:52,236
<i>During basic training,</i>

1020
01:00:52,302 --> 01:00:56,396
<i>I got the opportunity of half a day off
of training if I took the language test.</i>

1021
01:00:56,475 --> 01:00:57,946
So I took the language test,

1022
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:00,534
and little did I know that
was the end of that story.

1023
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:04,799
I was taught Vietnamese,
taught radio intercept,

1024
01:01:04,853 --> 01:01:07,216
and went immediately
to Southeast Asia.

1025
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:17,582
Bomb Damage Assessments:
We would be given advance notification

1026
01:01:17,626 --> 01:01:20,131
of where air strikes
were going to take place.

1027
01:01:20,195 --> 01:01:22,769
<i>Part of our job was to monitor</i>

1028
01:01:22,841 --> 01:01:28,795
the actual North Vietnamese assessment
of the damage of that air strike.

1029
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:30,551
<i>Primarily what we had there was</i>

1030
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:35,658
<i>really sophisticated electronic
eavesdropping devices,</i>

1031
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:39,687
<i>so we could eavesdrop on
communications that were taking place</i>

1032
01:01:39,731 --> 01:01:43,128
<i>between Vietnamese
units and their commands.</i>

1033
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:49,694
We would receive information
which was then analyzed,

1034
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:53,195
and that became intelligence,

1035
01:01:53,244 --> 01:01:56,725
<i>and then that was picked
through and became product</i>

1036
01:01:56,794 --> 01:01:59,317
<i>for the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, President.</i>

1037
01:01:59,392 --> 01:02:02,087
<i>One of the main things
about me that changed my mind</i>

1038
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:06,744
was that I knew what was
happening in-country was not

1039
01:02:06,808 --> 01:02:09,661
what was being told to the
people of the United States.

1040
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:31,553
<i>The bombing of populated areas,
civilian areas, the bombing of hospitals,</i>

1041
01:02:31,612 --> 01:02:37,244
<i>things that the U.S. denied over and
over again that we were engaged in,</i>

1042
01:02:37,322 --> 01:02:40,803
those are things that
we were engaged in.

1043
01:02:40,877 --> 01:02:43,278
And we had access to that information.

1044
01:02:43,338 --> 01:02:47,764
And the lies were so stark, you know,
it challenged your own dignity.

1045
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,612
It challenged your own loyalty.
It challenged your own humanity.

1046
01:02:55,094 --> 01:03:00,542
Given the very job that we did,
which was listen to the Vietnamese,

1047
01:03:00,616 --> 01:03:04,646
is that we were allowed
to enter their minds.

1048
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,640
<i>And we were allowed to enter
their hearts, their feelings.</i>

1049
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:12,576
People began to develop
relationships, mental relationships,

1050
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:15,763
<i>with the people that they
were listening to every day.</i>

1051
01:03:15,821 --> 01:03:18,826
<i>That was a real conscientious
contention there.</i>

1052
01:03:18,899 --> 01:03:22,684
Also, a dichotomy.
That if we did our job right,

1053
01:03:22,738 --> 01:03:24,758
we would save the lives of Americans.

1054
01:03:24,832 --> 01:03:26,439
If we did our job right,

1055
01:03:26,499 --> 01:03:31,311
we would cost the lives of
tens of thousands of Vietnamese.

1056
01:03:33,258 --> 01:03:36,242
So it put us in that
position where we had to,

1057
01:03:36,307 --> 01:03:39,232
there was no way we could win.

1058
01:03:39,306 --> 01:03:40,455
I had to do something.

1059
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,618
And that's the point of what
that is, we did something.

1060
01:03:42,662 --> 01:03:45,633
We had to do something.
We went to VVAW,

1061
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:50,259
we went to as many
groups as we could find,

1062
01:03:50,308 --> 01:03:52,162
and told them what
we were going to do.

1063
01:03:52,216 --> 01:03:55,517
We were basically going to go back to
NKP and do what we could

1064
01:03:55,518 --> 01:03:57,218
to stop the war.

1065
01:03:57,281 --> 01:03:59,273
And I think that we made the decision

1066
01:03:59,322 --> 01:04:02,406
on that leave that we
were going to do the paper.

1067
01:04:02,455 --> 01:04:04,318
<i>We were going to do as much as we could</i>

1068
01:04:04,357 --> 01:04:07,406
<i>during this last year of our
service to stop what was going on.</i>

1069
01:04:07,475 --> 01:04:12,032
Yeah, we did everything that
we could legally to get their goat.

1070
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:14,297
And that's kind of how
the Worms got started.

1071
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:16,120
And we began to have parties.

1072
01:04:16,164 --> 01:04:19,326
And then we started talking about
what was the lowest thing on the earth,

1073
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:23,125
and somebody said "Worms,"
and there was the acronym "Worms,"

1074
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:26,233
<i>which stands for
We Openly Resist Military Stupidity.</i>

1075
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:28,077
<i>"We don't write Worms
Eye View to convince,</i>

1076
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:30,155
<i>"we write Worms Eye View
to communicate.</i>

1077
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:32,366
"We don't need money,
we need each other.

1078
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:36,219
"We Openly Resist Military Stupidity.
We openly love each other".

1079
01:04:37,691 --> 01:04:39,566
<i>We had a big party one night.</i>

1080
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,698
<i>I remember, we had taken an
effigy of our commanding officer,</i>

1081
01:04:44,763 --> 01:04:47,480
and after we burned our
commanding officer in effigy,

1082
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:49,042
I looked around and there was

1083
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:53,669
a large group of people on the
perimeter that had circled us.

1084
01:04:53,743 --> 01:04:58,915
And it was the security police.
And they were starting to close in on us.

1085
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,693
And they had dogs. And
once they got close enough

1086
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,923
to figure out what we were doing,
they joined us.

1087
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,888
With the air assault coming
mainly from aircraft carriers,

1088
01:05:11,946 --> 01:05:15,270
sailors and airmen became
the center of the GI Movement.

1089
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:17,220
On the U.S.S. Coral Sea,

1090
01:05:17,275 --> 01:05:20,780
1,200 signed a petition
demanding their ship stay home.

1091
01:05:20,848 --> 01:05:25,799
And San Diego, California, home of the
carriers Constellation and Kitty Hawk,

1092
01:05:25,862 --> 01:05:30,029
spawned a group led by navy
officers and enlisted men.

1093
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:33,421
<i>We truly believed what
would stop that war</i>

1094
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,034
<i>was when the soldiers
stopped fighting it.</i>

1095
01:05:36,093 --> 01:05:39,592
I was still an active officer,
as were all these other guys,

1096
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:43,981
and sailors and enlisted people,
as we sat around and brainstormed

1097
01:05:44,035 --> 01:05:46,798
<i>about what kind of a non-violent action</i>

1098
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:51,015
<i>can we take that can
actually touch sailors.</i>

1099
01:05:51,088 --> 01:05:54,464
<i>So we looked around and
we saw the aircraft carrier,</i>

1100
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:56,580
<i>which was the biggest
ship in San Diego Harbor,</i>

1101
01:05:56,635 --> 01:05:59,302
<i>it's the most impressive
symbol of American power.</i>

1102
01:05:59,346 --> 01:06:05,096
<i>It's hard for people to realize this but
that ship is not a naval ship anymore,</i>

1103
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:09,013
<i>it's really part of airpower
that we use to attack peasants.</i>

1104
01:06:09,081 --> 01:06:12,081
<i>It's the weapon of a bully.
It's the weapon of aggression.</i>

1105
01:06:16,926 --> 01:06:20,298
<i>The original concept came,
well, let's do something</i>

1106
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:24,959
<i>where we allow the people
on board that ship to cast a ballot,</i>

1107
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,983
as to whether or not they think
they should go back to Vietnam.

1108
01:06:29,063 --> 01:06:30,890
<i>Let's just hear their voice.
Then we said,</i>

1109
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,405
<i>"No, this election should be held</i>

1110
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:35,090
<i>"in every shopping center
in San Diego County.</i>

1111
01:06:35,163 --> 01:06:38,203
<i>"And every Safeway store ought
to have a little polling booth outside,</i>

1112
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:40,229
"and we ought to see how many
ballots we can collect.

1113
01:06:40,284 --> 01:06:42,504
<i>"And we're going
to point toward a day".</i>

1114
01:06:46,198 --> 01:06:55,868
Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay.
Stay. Stay. Stay.

1115
01:06:55,946 --> 01:07:00,148
<i>Heck, I was a carrier
qualified aviator,</i>

1116
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:04,019
<i>and that gave me a lot of credibility
with people, earned or not earned.</i>

1117
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:06,451
And even though
I hadn't been in combat,

1118
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:10,249
people would give you a certain
amount of credence, of course,

1119
01:07:10,288 --> 01:07:13,318
<i>because I knew a whole lot about
how the military functioned.</i>

1120
01:07:13,387 --> 01:07:17,723
I used to be a lieutenant
in the Navy, U.S.N. And I've flown --

1121
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:20,458
- You're kidding me.
- I'm not kidding. I can prove it to you.

1122
01:07:20,498 --> 01:07:23,042
I'm a retired Master Sergeant
from the Air Force.

1123
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:28,456
My only question is, "Why do you
people have to look so weird?"

1124
01:07:28,485 --> 01:07:32,908
Like this one here. Can't you just
look normal like everybody else?

1125
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:34,163
<i>Don't I look normal?</i>

1126
01:07:35,712 --> 01:07:39,317
<i>There was nobody from the Captain
of that ship to the mayor of the city</i>

1127
01:07:39,371 --> 01:07:42,371
<i>who did not hold a press
conference about this project.</i>

1128
01:07:42,424 --> 01:07:46,150
Everybody was commenting on it.
U.S. senators were commenting on it.

1129
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:51,420
"Even if the City votes for that ship
to stay, we're still going!"

1130
01:07:51,473 --> 01:07:55,130
Well, I guess so.
The Captain of the ship says,

1131
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:57,964
<i>"Well, I know there are a lot of people
on the ship who don't want to go,</i>

1132
01:07:57,965 --> 01:08:02,965
"but military is full of malcontents,"
he said.

1133
01:08:08,564 --> 01:08:12,653
We believe that peace is at hand.

1134
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,820
<i>You know, the peace that was at hand</i>

1135
01:08:14,888 --> 01:08:17,836
quickly disappeared
after the re-election.

1136
01:08:17,883 --> 01:08:23,693
<i>And of course, given the vantage point
of everybody working in a NSA unit,</i>

1137
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:25,952
you know, we knew what was coming up.

1138
01:08:25,953 --> 01:08:28,497
<i>***</i>

1139
01:08:28,597 --> 01:08:33,517
<i>A decision by the President of
the US and by Henry Kissinger</i>

1140
01:08:33,586 --> 01:08:37,209
<i>to bomb North Vietnam
back into the Stone Age</i>

1141
01:08:37,266 --> 01:08:42,317
<i>as their last message to the
Vietnamese before we withdrew entirely.</i>

1142
01:08:43,343 --> 01:08:46,510
<i>I think everybody that was
involved in our operations</i>

1143
01:08:46,584 --> 01:08:50,962
<i>was faced with the stark reality
of participating in something</i>

1144
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:54,032
<i>which bordered on what
we considered to be</i>

1145
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:57,533
<i>criminal, genocidal, and unprecedented.</i>

1146
01:08:57,611 --> 01:09:02,077
<i>So we felt very much in solidarity
with other GIs</i>

1147
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:04,361
<i>who were
refusing to participate,</i>

1148
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:09,488
<i>particularly people refusing
to fly B-52s over the North.</i>

1149
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:14,516
<i>People stopped producing
the intelligence product</i>

1150
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:16,923
<i>that we were supposed to be producing</i>

1151
01:09:16,972 --> 01:09:20,448
<i>by monitoring North
Vietnamese communications.</i>

1152
01:09:21,306 --> 01:09:23,846
<i>When you're not interpreting
what you're hearing,</i>

1153
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:28,984
<i>and you're not passing along the
intelligence that you're receiving,</i>

1154
01:09:29,018 --> 01:09:30,979
<i>the people who are supposed
to be getting the information</i>

1155
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,665
<i>don't get any information.</i>

1156
01:09:34,194 --> 01:09:40,539
<i>The Air Force was no longer a reliable
instrument for carrying out the war.</i>

1157
01:09:44,032 --> 01:09:47,973
The Vietnam War ended
on April 30, 1975.

1158
01:09:48,037 --> 01:09:52,438
As North Vietnamese and National
Liberation Front troops entered Saigon,

1159
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:57,125
and even as the last remaining
Americans were returning home,

1160
01:09:57,194 --> 01:10:02,575
the memory and reality of the GI
anti-war movement was being rewritten.

1161
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:12,393
They love everybody back there.
Cats, dogs, niggers, spics.

1162
01:10:12,438 --> 01:10:16,389
<i>They're real fond of the gook back home,
if you all can believe that.</i>

1163
01:10:16,457 --> 01:10:19,011
They love everybody but you.

1164
01:10:20,825 --> 01:10:28,588
The typical story of a spat-upon vet is
his arriving at the San Francisco Airport,

1165
01:10:28,627 --> 01:10:33,922
where he is met by demonstrators,
and he says,

1166
01:10:33,961 --> 01:10:35,113
<i>"THE FIRST THING
THAT HAPPENED</i>

1167
01:10:35,114 --> 01:10:37,814
<i>WHEN I GOT OFF THE PLANE
IN SAN FRANCISCO,

1168
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,463
<i>A GIRL IN LOVE-BEADS
AND A HEADBAND</i>

1169
01:10:40,464 --> 01:10:43,464
<i>SPAT IN MY FACE
AND CALLED ME A BABY-KILLER".

1170
01:10:43,508 --> 01:10:48,074
<i>That version of the story has been told
over and over and over again.</i>

1171
01:10:48,128 --> 01:10:50,638
Being a Vietnam vet,
and having come home

1172
01:10:50,639 --> 01:10:53,139
and worked with the anti-war movement,

1173
01:10:53,187 --> 01:10:56,427
<i>these just didn't
resonate as true to me.</i>

1174
01:10:56,447 --> 01:11:00,491
So I began to get interested in: then
where did these stories come from?

1175
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:04,441
And how long had they been around?
Who had begun telling them?

1176
01:11:04,475 --> 01:11:08,769
<i>I went back to the point in time
in the late 60's, early 1970's</i>

1177
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:12,146
<i>to see whether there's any
reports in newspaper stories</i>

1178
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:15,868
<i>that activists were
spitting on Vietnam vets.</i>

1179
01:11:15,936 --> 01:11:17,730
No. I didn't find anything.

1180
01:11:17,784 --> 01:11:23,127
<i>I looked at some National Lawyer's Guild
observation projects of demonstrations</i>

1181
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,877
<i>to see whether there was anything
in their archives about this.</i>

1182
01:11:25,926 --> 01:11:27,637
No. Nothing there.

1183
01:11:27,685 --> 01:11:30,514
<i>Were any Vietnam vets claiming
that they were being spat on,</i>

1184
01:11:30,548 --> 01:11:34,867
<i>or were any pro-war people then claiming
that Vietnam vets were being spat on?</i>

1185
01:11:34,896 --> 01:11:36,106
No.

1186
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,517
So I thought this is getting
really interesting.

1187
01:11:39,566 --> 01:11:42,582
<i>I was telling a friend of
mine who's a psychologist,</i>

1188
01:11:42,651 --> 01:11:45,781
<i>she also teaches in women's studies,
and I was telling her that I was working</i>

1189
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:49,315
<i>on a book about Vietnam vets
having been spat on, and she said,</i>

1190
01:11:49,354 --> 01:11:52,399
<i>"That's really interesting.
Who supposedly did the spitting?"</i>

1191
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:53,937
And I said, "What do you mean?"

1192
01:11:53,952 --> 01:11:56,847
She said, "Well, the demographics
of the spitters".

1193
01:11:56,897 --> 01:12:03,573
And I said, "Young women,
protesters, hippies,"

1194
01:12:03,637 --> 01:12:06,593
and she broke out in
this big smile and says,

1195
01:12:06,648 --> 01:12:08,330
"Got to be a myth, huh?"

1196
01:12:08,397 --> 01:12:10,846
And I knew what was coming next,

1197
01:12:10,895 --> 01:12:15,767
I knew what she was going to say
next which is "Girls don't spit".

1198
01:12:15,817 --> 01:12:17,381
Now, whether girls spit or not,

1199
01:12:17,425 --> 01:12:20,625
I've had some other
conversations about that,

1200
01:12:20,689 --> 01:12:24,977
<i>but it seems pretty unlikely that
these spitting incidents occurred.</i>

1201
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:27,703
A lot of these stories again begin with,

1202
01:12:27,737 --> 01:12:30,222
"Well, we arrived at the
San Francisco airport".

1203
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:34,593
No, you didn't arrive at the
San Francisco airport. Nobody did.

1204
01:12:34,633 --> 01:12:37,936
You maybe arrived at Travis
Airbase near San Francisco

1205
01:12:37,994 --> 01:12:42,313
and then you were discharged
or you were processed out,

1206
01:12:42,357 --> 01:12:46,965
and you went to the San Francisco
airport, that's possible,

1207
01:12:47,019 --> 01:12:50,192
but that's not the way
the stories are told.

1208
01:12:50,231 --> 01:12:54,951
"We were met on the Tarmac
at San Francisco Airport".

1209
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:57,188
Too many guys got off at
the San Francisco airport.

1210
01:12:57,228 --> 01:12:59,249
Somebody's making something up here.

1211
01:12:59,276 --> 01:13:05,410
And certainly if it was at
military Air Force bases,

1212
01:13:05,457 --> 01:13:08,557
there couldn't have been
protesters on the base,

1213
01:13:08,621 --> 01:13:15,396
much less on the Tarmac or
at gateside to meet people.

1214
01:13:15,449 --> 01:13:21,419
There are many stories of wounded
Vietnam vets being unloaded,

1215
01:13:21,457 --> 01:13:24,796
people on stretchers being
carried from the plane,

1216
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:30,885
and they are spat on by protesters
who are lining the walkways.

1217
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:34,169
Some of those stories
really defy common sense,

1218
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:42,483
but these stories are picked up and
they are used very authoritatively.

1219
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:44,561
And I come back to the world,

1220
01:13:44,615 --> 01:13:48,252
and I see all those maggots
at the airport protesting me,

1221
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:51,536
spitting, calling me a baby
killer and all kinds of vile crap!

1222
01:13:52,403 --> 01:13:54,329
Who are they to protest me, huh?

1223
01:13:54,373 --> 01:14:00,112
If you went back and looked at the
front pages of newspapers in 1969, 1970,

1224
01:14:00,157 --> 01:14:02,941
what you were going to see on
the front pages of newspapers

1225
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:04,642
<i>about Vietnam vet?

1226
01:14:04,715 --> 01:14:07,486
<i>They were in the streets.
They were political activists.</i>

1227
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:11,035
<i>They're on the Capitol Mall, and giving
the Nixon Administration fits.</i>

1228
01:14:12,108 --> 01:14:15,770
This is stuff that was in
living rooms all over America.

1229
01:14:15,795 --> 01:14:19,982
So people knew this, and this is
an important piece for talking about,

1230
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:27,821
<i>how memory about the war has been
rewritten, has been reconstructed.</i>

1231
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:30,975
<i>This is gone.
This has been erased.</i>

1232
01:14:31,018 --> 01:14:32,661
<i>This has been displaced.</i>

1233
01:14:34,681 --> 01:14:39,090
You mention the war in Vietnam to
a lot of people, and they'll say,

1234
01:14:39,138 --> 01:14:42,545
"Yeah, and what happened to those guys
when they came home was sure a shame".

1235
01:14:43,495 --> 01:14:47,789
You ask them about any of
the major events of the war,

1236
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:50,823
and it's like people have no clue.

1237
01:14:55,539 --> 01:14:59,339
# I don't want nobody over me

1238
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,236
# And I don't want nobody under me.

1239
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,554
# Insubordination.

1240
01:15:08,211 --> 01:15:12,790
In the Spring of 1971,
the FTA Show toured Asia.

1241
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,590
Despite being banned from
military bases worldwide,

1242
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:20,481
the show performed in Japan,
Okinawa and the Philippines

1243
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,932
for over 60,000 soldiers.

1244
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:26,917
And at every stop,
GIs took the stage with them.

1245
01:15:26,966 --> 01:15:30,873
<i>We can no longer remain silent
about the atrocities and injustice</i>

1246
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:35,310
being perpetrated by the United States
Military on peoples of other nations.

1247
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,819
Nor of the petty harassment
that service men and women

1248
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,114
are made to endure day after day.

1249
01:15:40,173 --> 01:15:42,688
We demand an end to all
discriminating policies

1250
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,712
against persons because of their race.

1251
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:48,226
We demand an end to all
discrimination against persons

1252
01:15:48,262 --> 01:15:52,781
such as anti-war GIs because they
do not agree with U.S. policies.

1253
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:58,000
We demand an immediate
and total withdrawal

1254
01:15:58,014 --> 01:16:00,843
of all air and ground
troops and CIA from Vietnam,

1255
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:05,881
as well as from Korea, Guam, Okinawa,
Japan, the Philippines, Israel,

1256
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:11,390
Cambodia, Thailand, Germany, England,
Panama, Guantanamo Bay ...

1257
01:16:13,205 --> 01:16:16,395
I mean, it seems unthinkable now
that we could have done this.

1258
01:16:17,163 --> 01:16:23,030
And that you could have a hall full
of guys with their fists in the air

1259
01:16:23,072 --> 01:16:30,914
<i>so happy that we had come
to acknowledge their reality.</i>

1260
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:35,585
# I read that you took a stand

1261
01:16:35,665 --> 01:16:40,070
# and refused to kill in Vietnam.

1262
01:16:40,372 --> 01:16:45,331
# You said no man was your enemy,

1263
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:49,662
# what he's fighting for is to be free.

1264
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:53,590
<i>I used to love to watch the faces
of the GIs when she sang that.</i>

1265
01:16:53,633 --> 01:16:57,487
<i>It was like this shell
of tension would drop away</i>

1266
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:01,340
<i>and you would see the
youth and the innocence</i>

1267
01:17:01,364 --> 01:17:03,305
<i>and the vulnerability underneath.</i>

1268
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:06,665
# But soldier we love you.

1269
01:17:06,718 --> 01:17:10,929
# Yeah, soldier we love you.

1270
01:17:12,968 --> 01:17:18,207
# Standing strong 'cause it's hard to do

1271
01:17:18,241 --> 01:17:20,423
# what you know you must do

1272
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,499
# 'cause it's true, yes it's true.

1273
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,930
# They locked you up in the stockades,

1274
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,887
# yeah they locked you up

1275
01:17:31,965 --> 01:17:34,236
# 'cause they're afraid,

1276
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:38,645
# that you would rap
and spread the word,

1277
01:17:38,705 --> 01:17:42,738
# but you can't jail truth,
it will be heard.

1278
01:17:42,793 --> 01:17:50,147
# Oh, ain't it hard to smile sometimes?

1279
01:17:50,524 --> 01:17:52,540
In April of 1971,

1280
01:17:52,592 --> 01:17:57,080
just five years after Howard Levy and
Donald Duncan's lone acts of protest,

1281
01:17:57,062 --> 01:18:01,725
thousands of Vietnam veterans against
the war converged on Washington, D.C.

1282
01:18:01,784 --> 01:18:04,881
and threw their medals
onto the Capitol steps.

1283
01:18:05,845 --> 01:18:08,790
We don't want to fight anymore,
but if we have to fight again,

1284
01:18:08,824 --> 01:18:10,775
it will be to take these steps.

1285
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:15,424
You know, it's kind of
a unique opportunity.

1286
01:18:15,473 --> 01:18:18,592
It's very rare, I think,
in anybody's life

1287
01:18:18,645 --> 01:18:22,396
that you have an opportunity to really
think that you are changing history,

1288
01:18:22,455 --> 01:18:24,240
that you're a part of history.

1289
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,975
I mean, the reality is that at
first they couldn't believe that GIs

1290
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:31,544
were protesting the war.
That blew their minds.

1291
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:37,622
When we had 1,000 GIs in 1970, they
didn't know how to react to that

1292
01:18:37,666 --> 01:18:40,127
because they thought, "Yeah,
a bunch of them go down there

1293
01:18:40,156 --> 01:18:43,771
and they're all just probably talking,
but how many of them are there?"

1294
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:45,772
<i>They tried to turn me into a killer.</i>

1295
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:48,877
<i>They tried to turn me into somebody
who would take another life.</i>

1296
01:18:48,926 --> 01:18:52,440
If there is one thing in my life
that I feel I have accomplished,

1297
01:18:52,506 --> 01:18:55,304
is that I didn't allow that to happen.

1298
01:18:55,357 --> 01:18:59,378
I really learned so much, you know,
just spending day after day after day,

1299
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:03,442
you know, people just talking
about what it's all about,

1300
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:04,816
and how are we going
to deal with this stuff,

1301
01:19:04,871 --> 01:19:07,784
and how are we really going to move
it forward and change the world --

1302
01:19:07,819 --> 01:19:10,294
that's what everybody wanted to do,
of course, we wanted to change the world.

1303
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:11,872
We were pretty sure that this sucked,

1304
01:19:11,911 --> 01:19:14,308
and we were pretty sure that
none of us deserved to be here,

1305
01:19:14,343 --> 01:19:16,850
and so that didn't leave much
room but to change the world.

1306
01:19:16,905 --> 01:19:18,512
You know, people say,
"Well, you keep going back.

1307
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:19,939
"Why are you going back to Vietnam?"

1308
01:19:19,973 --> 01:19:21,443
You have to keep going back to Vietnam,

1309
01:19:21,478 --> 01:19:23,395
because I'll tell you what,
the other side does.

1310
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,640
They're always going back.
And they have to go back,

1311
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:29,660
the hawks, you know, the patriarchs.

1312
01:19:29,709 --> 01:19:34,710
They have to go back, and they
have to revise the going back,

1313
01:19:34,759 --> 01:19:40,773
because they can't allow us to know
what the back there really was.

1314
01:19:40,845 --> 01:19:44,738
And then you think about
this shit, man, then you say,

1315
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:54,798
"God damn, did I do that?
Did I actually live in that shit?

1316
01:19:54,822 --> 01:19:59,249
"Did this government
push me into this shit?"

1317
01:20:00,252 --> 01:20:03,325
What's the pride in
saying you're a veteran

1318
01:20:03,344 --> 01:20:07,114
if what you're a veteran
of is something wrong?

1319
01:20:08,427 --> 01:20:16,771
It's like being a veteran of the massacre
at some place or another, you know.

1320
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,150
There's no pride to that.

1321
01:20:22,188 --> 01:20:27,030
And so don't talk about it.
Go away. Don't talk about it.

1322
01:20:27,071 --> 01:20:33,091
So it's amazing to me that as many
GIs that were actually in Vietnam,

1323
01:20:33,154 --> 01:20:38,017
actually there,
then spoke out against it

1324
01:20:38,056 --> 01:20:41,091
and demonstrated against
it after they got back,

1325
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:43,841
I just thought that was amazing.

1326
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:48,990
If there had been 100
I would have been amazed,

1327
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,972
that there were thousands is just...

1328
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:58,726
incredible. Incredible.
Brave people.
