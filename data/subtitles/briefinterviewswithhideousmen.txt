1
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:46,477
So...

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,351
I have this thing.

3
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,081
It's a...

4
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,918
well, it's this...

5
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:08,558
Well, it's cost me every
sexual relationship I ever had.

6
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,096
And I don't know why I do it.

7
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,368
It's... I'm not a political person.

8
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,374
I don't consider myself...

9
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,536
I mean, I'm not one
of these "America first,"

10
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,443
read-the-newspaper,

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,313
will-Hillary-get-the-nod people.

12
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,752
I'll be doing it with some girl.
It doesn't matter who.

13
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:35,421
It's when I start to climax
that it happens.

14
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,588
I'm not a Democrat.

15
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,153
I don't even vote.

16
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,792
I freaked out about it once,
and I called a radio show,

17
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,359
a doctor on the radio,
anonymously.

18
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,531
And he diagnosed it as

19
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,940
the uncontrolled yelling

20
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,945
of involuntary words
or phrases,

21
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,142
frequently insulting
or scatological.

22
00:01:56,182 --> 00:02:00,050
"Coprolalia"
is the official term.

23
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,816
What is it that you say?

24
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,724
"Victory for the forces
of democratic freedom."

25
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,460
Only way louder,
as in, really shouting it.

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,298
"Victory for the forces
of democratic freedom!"

27
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,239
Only louder than that.

28
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,470
It wouldn't be so embarrassing

29
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,536
if it weren't so totally
fucking weird,

30
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,675
if I had any clue
what it was about.

31
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,709
You know?

32
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,973
Well, I'm very surprised
to see you here.

33
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,136
Oh?

34
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,145
Well yeah, I mean, your...

35
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,238
your record on attending
these academic events

36
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,407
has been somewhat spotty.

37
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,541
I know.
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,347
I was just finishing up
grading those papers.

39
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,750
I should have them
to you tomorrow.

40
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,754
Yeah, and you?

41
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,312
Will we have you
in class tomorrow?

42
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,323
Yes.

43
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,791
And, Professor, I know I've been
a little distracted,

44
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:47,793
and I'm sorry.

45
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,591
Look, I know you're allergic
to these events,

46
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,858
these parties and whatnot.

47
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,991
But believe it or not,
I actually look forward to them.

48
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,160
Now, I think we can talk
about this at some other time,

49
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,397
and you need
to give yourself a break.

50
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,405
All right?

51
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,407
And look, as long as you're out,

52
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,671
you might as well
have a good time.

53
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,380
Pretty nice, huh?

54
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,614
- What's that?
- Pretty nice?

55
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:20,820
Yeah, glamorous.

56
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,953
You been doing this all day?

57
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,157
Yeah, a few people before you.

58
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,723
Do you mind if I turn this on?

59
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,734
No.

60
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,735
Great.
Thanks.

61
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,138
Sure.

62
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:37,506
Sometimes it's like,
I think,

63
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,443
"Hey, what if I can't?"

64
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,242
And then I think,
"Oh, shit, don't think that,"

65
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,044
you know, 'cause thinking
can make it happen.

66
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,540
Not that it happens that often,
but I get scared about it.

67
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,985
We all do.

68
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,818
Anybody tells you different
is full of shit.

69
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,915
You can tell 'em I said so.

70
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,987
It's like, I always think,
you know,

71
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,487
"I wouldn't even be worried
about it if she wasn't here."

72
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:04,162
It's like she's expecting
something.

73
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:11,006
You know, that if she wasn't
lying there, expecting it,

74
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,606
wondering, like, evaluating,

75
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,707
it wouldn't even occur to me.

76
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,480
You know, and then I get
kind of pissed off.

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,919
I get so pissed off,

78
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,445
I don't give a shit anymore,
"Can I, or can I not?"

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,890
I just want to show her up.

80
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,951
You know, and then it's like,
"All right.

81
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,223
"You asked for it.

82
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,560
"Here we go, bitch.

83
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:36,625
Here we go!"

84
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,799
What does today's woman want?

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,932
That's the big one.

86
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,134
I totally agree.

87
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,508
It's the... what do you call...

88
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,978
Or put another way,

89
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,844
what do today's women
think they want,

90
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,213
versus what do they really
deep-down want?

91
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,740
How about this?

92
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,117
What do they think
they're supposed to want?

93
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,382
From a male.

94
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,753
From a guy.

95
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,020
Whether it sounds
Neanderthal or not,

96
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,050
I'm still gonna argue
it's the big one,

97
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:06,327
because the whole question's
become such a mess.

98
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,065
Looks like someone
needs to refuel.

99
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,076
Hey, Jeff.

100
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,010
No, thank you.

101
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,741
These bathroom waits
can sometimes take forever,

102
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,045
so it's best to hydrate.

103
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,415
Well it's not
that wine rehydrates.

104
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,420
It's more...

105
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,978
you get it.

106
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,188
So how are you?

107
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,594
I'm doing really well.

108
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,120
Thank you.

109
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,530
Yeah?

110
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,533
Yeah?

111
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,594
Good, because I heard...
I mean, but that's great.

112
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,629
I mean, that's really...

113
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,731
that's really great.

114
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,872
You know, I almost asked you out
our first year.

115
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,904
You're kidding.

116
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,041
It's true.

117
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,711
I should have.

118
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,083
Right?

119
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,315
I was just too intimidated.

120
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,323
Oh?

121
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,449
Why is that?

122
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,685
Why?

123
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,818
Why?

124
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,521
Well, it's not just that
you're beautiful.

125
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,427
I mean, but you are.

126
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,659
It's just, you're so darn smart.

127
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,996
There.

128
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,058
That's why.

129
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,162
Beautiful people
are a dime a dozen.

130
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,935
And not...
hey, let's face it,

131
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:26,775
genuinely smart people are rare
of either sex.

132
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,871
You know that.

133
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,247
But for me, I think, for me,

134
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,879
it's your smartness
more than anything else.

135
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,888
My smartness, Jeff?

136
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,889
Are you drunk?

137
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,652
Because your grammar's
starting to suffer.

138
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,749
Perhaps.

139
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:44,024
I suppose,
from your point of view.

140
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,054
Uh...

141
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,656
Except, think about it
for a minute.

142
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,763
Would that possibility
have even occurred to a...

143
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,171
a not-so-smart girl?

144
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,008
Would a dumb girl have the sense
to suspect that?

145
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,273
Hmm.

146
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,110
I suppose you're right.

147
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,206
See?

148
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,341
See?

149
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:10,447
So you proved my point
and that I mean what I say,

150
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,890
and you're not gonna blow it off
as just something, you know...

151
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,758
some kind of come-on
or something like that.

152
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,784
Right?

153
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,093
'Cause that's not
what I'm doing.

154
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,257
Oh.

155
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,266
Go ahead, go ahead.

156
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,460
I don't even have to go, really.

157
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,469
I'm just...

158
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,731
Okay.

159
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,737
You know...

160
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,467
Okay, Jeff, well,
have a good night.

161
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,907
Have a good night.

162
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,536
- I'm sure I'll see you around.
- Good night.

163
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,909
- Good night.
- Good night.

164
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,106
The modern woman has

165
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,637
an unprecedented amount

166
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,740
of contradictory stuff
laid on her

167
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,115
about what she's
supposed to want

168
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,245
and how she's expected
to conduct herself.

169
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,654
The modern woman's a mess
of contradiction.

170
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,055
And they lay it on themselves.

171
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,116
It drives 'em nuts.

172
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,592
That's what makes it
so difficult

173
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,528
to know what they want.

174
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,531
Yeah, you can say that again.

175
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:57,559
Difficult but not impossible.

176
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,697
Baby, come on.

177
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,198
Open the door.

178
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,210
Come on, baby.

179
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,336
Let me in.

180
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,346
Hey.

181
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,249
How you doin'?

182
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,252
Baby, come on.

183
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,778
Open the door.

184
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:17,789
What?

185
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,790
Don't be ridiculous.

186
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,485
That was the super.

187
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,149
Women?

188
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,753
I love women.

189
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,230
I really do.

190
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,632
Oh, I love everything
about them.

191
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,828
I can't even describe it.

192
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,396
Short ones, tall ones,
fat ones, thin,

193
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,706
from drop-dead to plain.

194
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:17,581
To me, hey, you know,
all women are beautiful.

195
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,485
I can't get enough of 'em.

196
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,353
Some of my best friends
are women.

197
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,917
As a child, I watched
a great deal of television.

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,623
And the show I most preferred
to watch was <i>Bewitched.</i>

199
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,962
It was as a child,
while watching <i>Bewitched,</i>

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,403
that I had my first
erotic sensations.

201
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,873
Elizabeth Montgomery

202
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:46,537
would perform a circular motion
with her hand

203
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,946
accompanied by the sound
of a zither or harp

204
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,280
and produce
a supernatural effect

205
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,310
in which all motion ceased

206
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,582
and all the other characters

207
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,216
were suddenly frozen
in mid-gesture.

208
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,692
So it is of little wonder

209
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:06,187
that my fantasy also involves
supernatural powers

210
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,359
over the women of my choosing.

211
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,804
For some reason, my fantasy
always takes place at a gym,

212
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:18,743
the gym my mother
religiously attended.

213
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:19,745
So.

214
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,076
Right.

215
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,080
In my fantasy,

216
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:26,517
I envision myself
looking out across the floor

217
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,383
of vigorous exercises.

218
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,515
And my gaze falls upon

219
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,789
a beautiful, sensual,
and athletic woman.

220
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,524
And she,

221
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:42,159
looking up from her exercise
equipment, sees me.

222
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,693
I beckon her to me
using only my eyes,

223
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,707
or perhaps a slight circular
motion with just one finger.

224
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:54,680
And she, overpowered with erotic
attraction, comes towards me.

225
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:59,174
We meet on an exercise mat
at the room's exact center,

226
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,585
she, removing the straps
of her heavy clothing

227
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,283
in a frenzy of sexual mania

228
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,224
while my schoolboy's uniform
is removed

229
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,422
with a more controlled
and amused deliberation,

230
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:16,060
forcing her to wait
in an agony of erotic need.

231
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:22,940
And then there is copulation
in varied and distinct ways

232
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:27,776
among the many other petrified,
unseeing figures,

233
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:32,841
for whom I have stopped time
with my hand's great power!

234
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,682
Yeah, Sara, by the way,
I think you look fantastic.

235
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,691
Well, thank you, Harry.

236
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,714
Wow.

237
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,727
No, it's true.

238
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,285
It seems that single life
has just kind of

239
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,388
kicked the sweet little
Miss Cardigan right out of you.

240
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,398
What?
No, no, I like it.

241
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,399
This whole Urban Outfitters,

242
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,025
Edie Sedgwick thing works,
you know?

243
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,093
It's kind of, like,
it's edgy, but it's distinctive.

244
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,104
That's great.

245
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,503
That's exactly what
I was going for.

246
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,733
You look good, Sara.

247
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,071
- Thanks, Sam.
- Really.

248
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,097
Good for you.

249
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,872
Thank you.

250
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,936
Okay, all right, where was I?

251
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,947
Big.

252
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:02,948
Oh, right, okay.

253
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,847
So, I'm out with this girl,

254
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,977
and this big, big guy,
he comes over to us.

255
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,044
Who was it?

256
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,521
Nicki.

257
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,523
Nicki?

258
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,524
Wow.

259
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,525
No, Nicole.

260
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,548
Okay, whatever.

261
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,085
So he comes over there
and he says,

262
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,622
"You boys nowadays
are all the same."

263
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,828
"Excuse me?"

264
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:24,995
He said,

265
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,369
"All you smoothie type fellows
go around thinking you are

266
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,102
the Lord's own gift
to the female species."

267
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,167
Was he black?

268
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,645
Yeah, actually.

269
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,375
Mm, racist, that's racist.

270
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,541
- What?
- That's how he talked.

271
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,641
Finish your story.

272
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,345
But you want to know
how to really be great,

273
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,345
how a great lover
really pleases a lady?

274
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,688
Now, most of these fellas
haven't got the first damn clue.

275
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,692
Not really.

276
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,956
You know, a lot of them
don't even care,

277
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,155
to tell you the truth.

278
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,562
Now, that's your first type,

279
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,828
right, your Joe Six-Pack cracker
type fella.

280
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,199
Yeah, and he's like
your basic pig, right?

281
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,636
The type that rolls on,
has at her,

282
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,537
and the minute he's done, right,

283
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,974
he rolls off again
and then commences to snoring.

284
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,170
But you see,
these fellas are just animals.

285
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,702
They're not even in the same
type of game

286
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,145
that we're talking about here.

287
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,443
No, what we're talking
about here

288
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,416
is your basic secondary
type of fella,

289
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,942
the fella that thinks
he's a great lover,

290
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,217
your sensitive
male smoothie type.

291
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,884
Now, what they're into
is a woman's pleasure.

292
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,793
And giving the woman pleasure,
that's this type's whole trip.

293
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,320
And I'm guessing from looking
at you over here right now

294
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,595
that you've been up against
a smoothie a time or two,

295
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,192
who runs down
to Barnes and Noble's

296
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,569
for all the latest female
sexuality-type books,

297
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,903
huh, right?

298
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,875
With the pheromone aftershave
and holding and touching,

299
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,437
and you know, about the earlobe
and the back side of the knee

300
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,879
and, and all that,

301
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,816
with the strawberry oil
and the hand massages.

302
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:50,151
But, but, will he let
the little lady replicate?

303
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,213
Hmm?

304
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,817
Will he allow her to give him
so much as a backrub?

305
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,326
No, sir, he will not,

306
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,387
Because this type's whole trip
is that he's got to be the one

307
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,419
giving the pleasure here.

308
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,796
Thank you very much, ma'am.

309
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,826
And this, this is what gives me
contempt for these guys

310
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,703
that go around thinking that
they're the Lord's own gift

311
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,298
to the female species.

312
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,536
And watching them in bed
is like watching

313
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,067
when the mechanics
in the white suits

314
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,409
workin' on a Porsche.

315
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,279
They're all swelled up
on their own expertise.

316
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,978
They think they're
a great lover.

317
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,544
They think they're being
generous in bed.

318
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,488
What they don't understand

319
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,787
is that their type
is an even worse drag

320
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,019
for the lady with any sense

321
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,960
than the on-and-off pig
ever was,

322
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:35,365
because how'd you like to just
lay there and be worked on, huh,

323
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,663
like a Porsche?

324
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,102
You see, that's where
your smoothie types

325
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,730
always lose the game.

326
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,970
They want to be the only
great lover in bed.

327
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,207
Now, you want my opinion, huh?

328
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:52,843
You want know how
to be really great, hmm?

329
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:58,016
There's only one in a thousand
fellas that's figured it out.

330
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,150
The secret is, you've got to...

331
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,387
I disagree.

332
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,395
What?

333
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,363
I disagree that's it's
impossible to determine

334
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,264
what it is they really want.

335
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,097
I don't think I said
"impossible."

336
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,569
Though I do agree that
in today's postfeminist era

337
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,039
it's unprecedentedly difficult

338
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,543
and takes some serious deductive
firepower and imagination.

339
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,704
I mean, if it was
literally impossible,

340
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,441
then where would we be
as a species?

341
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,279
And I do agree that you can't
necessarily go

342
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,978
just by what they say they want.

343
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,213
'Cause they're only saying it

344
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,948
'cause they think
they're supposed to.

345
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,115
The media perpetuates it.

346
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,249
My position is that actually
most of the time

347
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,522
you can figure out
what they want,

348
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,324
I mean, logically deduce it,

349
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,490
if you're willing to make
the effort to understand them

350
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,694
and to understand the impossible
situation they're in.

351
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,136
Schizophrenic media discourse,

352
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,198
exemplified by, like,
for example, <i>Cosmo.</i>

353
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,607
On one hand, get liberated.

354
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,077
On the other hand,
make sure you find a husband.

355
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,638
Who wouldn't be nuts
with that mess

356
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,515
laid on them all the time
in today's media culture?

357
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:04,011
The most important thing
is to understand her,

358
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,457
understand the paradox.

359
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,018
Damned either way.

360
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,290
Yup.

361
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,264
Mars and Venus.

362
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:17,064
I love, love, love them.

363
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,297
Yeah, I love to watch them move,

364
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:25,937
and I love how different
they all are.

365
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:30,347
I love to hear them giggle,

366
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,316
you know, the different
little sounds.

367
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,545
Yeah.

368
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:38,022
I love how you can
never understand them

369
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,390
and the way that you just can't
keep them from shopping,

370
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,519
no matter what you do.

371
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,961
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

372
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,197
Today we are going
to be concluding part two

373
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,694
of the very riveting
<i>Nanook of the North.</i>

374
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,970
Yes, yes, groan, groan, I know.

375
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,637
It actually will
be a fascinating example

376
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,145
of scientific hubris.

377
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,411
Pay close attention
to the documenter

378
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,940
rather than the documented.

379
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,713
In all the sciences

380
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,221
the essential question is,
"Why?"

381
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,155
All right?

382
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,215
Shall we do this?

383
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,691
Ready?

384
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:19,060
Hit the lights, please.

385
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,360
# Don't go changin' #

386
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,366
Yikes.

387
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,594
- I'm not playing that.
- Come on.

388
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,601
No, I'm not gonna...

389
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,602
- You figure it out.
- No.

390
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,331
You know you want to.

391
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,973
# Don't go changin' #

392
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,208
# To try and please me #

393
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:40,878
# You never let me down before #

394
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,819
# Mm-hmm-hmm mm-mm #

395
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,913
You forgot that.

396
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,255
# And don't imagine #

397
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,784
# You're too familiar #

398
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:58,463
# And I don't see you anymore #

399
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,871
# I would not leave you #

400
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,707
# In times of trouble #

401
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:10,681
# Never could've gone this far #

402
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,116
# Mm-hmm-hmm mm-mm #

403
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,519
# I took the good times #

404
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:21,083
# I'll take the bad times #

405
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,727
Hey, Daniel.

406
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,058
- Good to see you.
- Hey, Miss Quinn.

407
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,120
Hello, Daniel.

408
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,029
I stopped by your office hours
earlier this week.

409
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,032
You must've been...

410
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,829
I'm sorry, I had
a personal conflict, Daniel.

411
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:30,926
- I couldn't make it.
- Okay.

412
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:35,030
Well, I'd love to know
what you thought of my paper.

413
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,633
Yeah, the papers
will be finished tomorrow

414
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,439
outside my office first thing
in the morning.

415
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,445
Okay.

416
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,142
Well, enjoy.

417
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,915
It's the arm.

418
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:58,259
I can see you being all polite,
not wanting to look at it.

419
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,524
Go ahead.

420
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,227
Look at it.

421
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,894
I don't mind.

422
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,903
You want to touch?

423
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,098
I'm just kiddin'.

424
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,903
No, but really, that's one
of the stages of the thing,

425
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,173
of using the Asset.

426
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,737
There's always a lot of girls
around, you know,

427
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,681
back there at the foundry there,
at the...

428
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,411
on the lanes.

429
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,715
And Jackpot...
that's my best friend.

430
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,051
Jackpot and Kenny Kirk,

431
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,216
they're what you would call,
you know,

432
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,726
"good-looking" guys,
you know,

433
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,024
"normal-looking," you know,

434
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,032
"do well with the ladies,"
if you know what I mean, huh?

435
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,499
And what I do is,

436
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,970
I go back there, and I talk
to this one and that one,

437
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,666
and eventually,
I get around to the story

438
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,165
of how I got the name
Johnny One.

439
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,701
That's one of the stages
of the thing.

440
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,374
We're back at her place now,
you know?

441
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,042
Just hangin' back, you know,

442
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,984
in her kitchenette,
some such.

443
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,648
And usually what I'll do is,

444
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,123
I'll go,
"Oh, it's so hot in here.

445
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,149
"I feel like taking my shirt
off, but I don't want to

446
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,492
on account of
I'm so ashamed of the arm."

447
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,621
Like that.

448
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,926
Because, you know,
at this point,

449
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,899
I'm starting to get
that I'm coming off

450
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,196
as kind of creepy,
you know.

451
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,226
I'm starting to understand
that she's seeing me

452
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,708
as maybe some kind of a loser,
but they can't back out.

453
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,403
You know why?

454
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,343
Because they've already said
all this nice shit

455
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,280
about how I shouldn't be ashamed
of the arm, right,

456
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,079
and how it couldn't possibly
be that bad.

457
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,246
So now you're getting into
your critical type stage, right,

458
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,620
where I actually
show them the arm.

459
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,682
Every time, sooner or later,

460
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,558
within inside, like,
five minutes of the thing,

461
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,995
they up and they start crying.

462
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,123
Right.

463
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,396
Here I am, right,
going up to them,

464
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,993
where they're sittin',

465
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,200
and now I'm holding them
with the good side.

466
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,232
They're breaking down crying,
and I'm next to them,

467
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,609
holding them with the good arm
going, "It's okay.

468
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,738
"Hey, it's okay.

469
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,271
"Don't cry.

470
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,183
"Don't be sad.

471
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:06,487
"Trusting you has made me
feel so very, very special.

472
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,753
"And now with your help,

473
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:12,787
I can go out there and not
be ashamed of this arm."

474
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,889
And so on.

475
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,696
Oh, more pussy
than a toilet seat, man.

476
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,168
I shit you not.

477
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,693
Go 'head and ask Jackpot
and Kenny Kirk.

478
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:20,705
They'll tell you.

479
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,037
Kenny Kirk's the one
that named it the Asset.

480
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,235
Go ahead and ask him.

481
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,676
More pussy than a toilet seat.

482
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:28,902
No, I know.

483
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:29,914
I know.

484
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,473
Hey, hang on a second.

485
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,109
Hey, no, I know.

486
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,746
You think I don't know
that I can be moody sometimes?

487
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,585
Think I don't...

488
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,389
No, and I know that I can be
withdrawn at other times,

489
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,952
and that I can be hard
to be in this with, okay?

490
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,930
But I just...

491
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,694
No, I'm not saying
that this is reassuring.

492
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,760
What I'm saying is that
I'm trying to get you to see

493
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:55,864
that sometimes things
ebb and flow, okay?

494
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,067
And that's...

495
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,738
and sometimes people are more
into it than other times,

496
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,714
and that's just how it is.

497
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,718
But you, you can't stand that.

498
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,276
I feel like...

499
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,551
I feel like no ebb's allowed.

500
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,823
And that breaks my heart.

501
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:21,822
That just breaks my heart.

502
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:26,827
Maybe if I cared about you
a little less,

503
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,330
maybe if I loved you
a little less

504
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,899
then I could take it.

505
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,570
But I...

506
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,877
What?

507
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,314
Yeah, that's what the bags
are for.

508
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,317
I'm leaving.

509
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,318
No!

510
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,480
Well, I don't think that you
understand.

511
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,387
Wait, hey, listen.

512
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,324
Just try to listen for one sec.

513
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,419
Try to absorb what I'm gonna
say to you, okay?

514
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,397
My leaving is not a confirmation
of your fears.

515
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,956
It isn't.

516
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,490
It is because of them.

517
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,400
And I know that you're totally
hating me for this,

518
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,837
and I have spent a lot of time
getting ready to the place

519
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,931
where I can face you
totally hating me for this.

520
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:07,911
And if you could see
the look on your face...

521
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,436
I can.

522
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,506
I can see it right now.

523
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,882
That look on your face,

524
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,443
if anybody could see it,

525
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:20,515
they'd understand
why I'm leaving.

526
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,098
Because this isn't exactly
easy for me, either.

527
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,296
Okay?

528
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,805
Leaving you like this,

529
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,300
seeing your face,

530
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,075
like this is my last
mental picture of you...

531
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,849
Can you see that I might be
pretty torn up about it too?

532
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,789
Yeah.

533
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,384
Can you?

534
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,019
And...

535
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:02,591
oh, I love it when they
bat their eyes or pout,

536
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,933
you know, when they give you
that little look.

537
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:13,633
The way they look in heels,

538
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,580
those teeny red bumps
that people get

539
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,311
when they're shaving
their legs...

540
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,945
that women get
when they're shaving their legs.

541
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,724
I'm sorry.

542
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,316
I was asking if you were using
this chair.

543
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,327
No.
Go ahead.

544
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,350
Thanks so much.

545
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,987
- So...
- Right.

546
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,292
I meet her at the airport.

547
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,298
Right, well wait.

548
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,594
Let me go back for a second.

549
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,534
So I'm last off again, as usual,

550
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,503
and all that business
like that there.

551
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,803
Yes, just wait and relax
in your seat, be the last off.

552
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,867
Why everybody right away
all the time has got to stand up

553
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,970
as soon as it comes to a stop
and cram into the aisles

554
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,173
so you just stand there...

555
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,613
Wait. Just wait.
Just wait.

556
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,014
So finally, coming out
into baggage

557
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,847
and the whole transportation
shit show there...

558
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,045
Yeah, still always depressing

559
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,644
to come out in baggage
on these cold calls

560
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,918
and see everybody getting met
with the squeals and the hugs

561
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,221
and the limo guys with the names
on the cardboard...

562
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,248
Just stop.

563
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,319
Shut it for one fucking second,
will you, please?

564
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:09,664
Because, it's mostly emptied out
by the time I get out there.

565
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,866
Except for over by...

566
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,067
there's this one girl left.

567
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,632
She's peering through
the glass doors

568
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,770
down the Jetway thing.

569
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,747
Our eyes meet and all
that business like that there.

570
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,411
And what... she... she up
and goes down on her knees.

571
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,419
She drops,

572
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,011
crying, slapping the carpet,

573
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,115
bent over so you can, you know,
just about see her tits,

574
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,251
totally hysterical,

575
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,456
with the waterworks and all
that business like that there.

576
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,690
Another cheery welcome

577
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,427
to Dayton for your fucking
cold calls.

578
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,163
"Hey, we'd like to welcome
you to Dayton."

579
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,170
No!

580
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,172
It's a story, a story.

581
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,403
It turns out when I, you know,
go over to say, "Are you okay?

582
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,535
Is anything the matter?"

583
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,010
And like that.

584
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,138
And get a better shot of,
I got to tell you,

585
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,012
some pretty fuckin'
incredible tits.

586
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,073
Wait.

587
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,210
She's all down and bent over.

588
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,710
She says,
"I'm in love with this guy."

589
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,747
And he said that he was
in love with her too,

590
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,588
except he was already engaged
from priorly.

591
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,720
So already there's all this
back and forth

592
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,855
and storm and drag.

593
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,728
And I'm lending the ear to her,
you know.

594
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,960
Right, right

595
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:20,768
And she says, but finally,
the guy gets off the fence.

596
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:25,242
And he says he's gonna surrender
to his love

597
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,743
for this girl here
with the tits

598
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,767
and that he's gonna go back

599
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,143
and tell this other girl
in Tulsa,

600
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,114
where he's from,
break it off,

601
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,017
and commit to this
hysterical girl with the tits,

602
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,146
who feels like finally,
for chrissakes,

603
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,587
after all
the one-track shitheels

604
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:39,817
she'd got
the runaround from,

605
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,326
finally here at last she's met
a guy she can trust

606
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,988
and love and merge souls with

607
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,761
and the whole sort of violins,
hearts, flowers...

608
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,199
And blah, blah, blah.

609
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,202
And blah.

610
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,603
So, off the guy goes
flying back to Tulsa.

611
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,698
Then he puts his hand
over his heart

612
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,265
and swears he's
coming back to her,

613
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,800
and he'll be on that plane there
with the flight number and time.

614
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:05,680
And she swears she'll be there
with the tits, to meet him.

615
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,082
Yeah.

616
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,882
We can't see that one coming.

617
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,684
And she says how
he even called her.

618
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,690
It rings.

619
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,191
It's this guy.

620
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,683
There's all this static and hiss
on the phone.

621
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,130
He says he's calling her
from the sky,

622
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,999
is how romantically he puts it.

623
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,526
Calling her in flight on one
of the little phone thing there.

624
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,595
Hey, you know what?

625
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,607
The markup on those things
goes six bucks a minute.

626
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,074
- It's a racket.
- That's not the point.

627
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,269
Do you want to hear this or not?

628
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,141
That's not the point.

629
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,943
This girl says how
she gets there early

630
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,005
in the baggage area

631
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,641
and already with some
of the waterworks

632
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,379
from love and violins.

633
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,852
And it gets in finally,
the flight.

634
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,548
And they... we...

635
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,217
all in the big
rush out the Jetway thing.

636
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,055
He's not in the first wave out.

637
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,357
He's not in the second wave out,
how they come out.

638
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,833
Jesus, I ought to...

639
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,496
the amount of fucking time
I spend in baggage.

640
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,835
And says like a pathetic,
a total fool,

641
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,172
her faith never faltering,

642
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,201
she just kept peering

643
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,406
during all the hugging
and everybody meeting

644
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,314
and every time
expecting this guy.

645
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,317
Waiting.

646
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:17,048
Poor little muttski.

647
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,079
But then at the end there,
I come off.

648
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:24,892
Last off, as usual.

649
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,421
That bastard even must have
faked the phone call.

650
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,525
The static,
if you run your Remington,

651
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,035
it'll make static.

652
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,504
And I am telling you,

653
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,566
you have never seen anybody
so the word "heartbroken."

654
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,100
You think it's just words,
blah, blah.

655
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,703
But then you see this girl
with this hand

656
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,180
knocking herself in the head
for being such a fool,

657
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,944
crying so hard
she can't mostly breathe

658
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,884
and all that business like that.

659
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,047
And how men are shits,
and don't even trust 'em.

660
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,023
Men are mostly shits.

661
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,024
It's true.

662
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,320
It's true.

663
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,351
Most guys are shit.

664
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,886
My heart...

665
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,727
My heart's going out
to this poor girl.

666
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,931
Heh, heh.

667
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,913
"Heh, heh"?

668
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,625
You got to ask?

669
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,025
You shitheel.

670
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,221
What?

671
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,524
- What am I gonna do?
- You bastard.

672
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:33,531
You know.

673
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,033
You shitheel.

674
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,736
click!

675
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,305
Hence, the timeless importance
of passion.

676
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,010
Women want to be both
irresponsible and passionate.

677
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,075
No.

678
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,779
What they want is to experience
a passion

679
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,380
that is so powerful
and irresistible

680
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,789
that it obliterates any guilt
or tension that they may have

681
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,850
about betraying their
perceived responsibilities.

682
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:03,918
And deep down,

683
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,361
they all want
to be irresponsible.

684
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,023
Deep down, they want a man

685
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,863
who's gonna be so passionate
and powerful

686
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,028
that they have no choice.

687
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,436
This thing is bigger
than both of them.

688
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,167
You shitheel!

689
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,043
The hell with it, right?

690
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:27,450
For science, right?

691
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,646
I'm sorry, that is what this is,
right, science?

692
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,154
It'll be used for...

693
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,180
oh, never mind, never mind.

694
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,282
You know what you're doing.

695
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,265
Hey.

696
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,425
You cut your hair.

697
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,397
It looks good.

698
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,496
Sweetie, we need to talk.

699
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,700
We've needed to for a while.

700
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,708
I have.

701
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,734
I mean, I feel like...

702
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,543
Can you sit?

703
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:43,049
Sweetie, my relationship record
indicates a guy who's bad news.

704
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:48,361
You see, I have a history,
a pattern, so to speak

705
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,629
of coming on very fast and hard

706
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,398
in the beginning
of a relationship,

707
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,771
of saying "I love you"
very early on.

708
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,673
It's not as if how many of them
I've said it to

709
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,178
is not an understandable
question or concern,

710
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,476
but if it's all right,
it's just...

711
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,816
it's just not what I'm trying
to talk to you about.

712
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,048
So I want to hold off on things
like names or numbers

713
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,419
and just try to be honest
with you

714
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,050
about what my concerns are,

715
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,923
'cause I care about you
a great deal.

716
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,086
I'm not explaining this well.

717
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,254
I'm not getting through.

718
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,854
I'm really starting
to freak out.

719
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,764
And I know it's insecure,

720
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,927
but it's very important to me

721
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,527
that you believe
that I have meant it

722
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,131
absolutely every time I told you
that I loved you,

723
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,367
every time.

724
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,898
And I know I should've told you

725
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,070
some of all this
about me sooner,

726
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,773
before you moved
all the way out here,

727
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:39,374
which, believe me, meant so...

728
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,681
it made me feel
you really cared about this,

729
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,243
especially because your moving
out here

730
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,686
was something I lobbied
so hard for.

731
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:45,689
School,

732
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,588
your apartment,

733
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,354
having to get rid of your cat,

734
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,361
Stitches,

735
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,384
Snookers,

736
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,794
Mr. Fluffy.

737
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,888
And I know... I know a better guy

738
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,330
probably would've
told you about this

739
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,526
before we even slept together.

740
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,661
And despite how
incredibly magical

741
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,934
and ecstatic
and right it was...

742
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:06,773
Can you imagine what it takes
to tell you this,

743
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,403
that I'm terrified,

744
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,244
that it's even possible
that the pattern of sending out

745
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,476
mixed signals and pulling away

746
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,485
is just another way
of pulling away?

747
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,487
Maybe deep down,
I'm such a coward

748
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,682
that I can't pull away myself,

749
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,453
so I somehow force you
into doing it.

750
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,857
Those are valid,

751
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,487
totally understandable
questions, sweetie.

752
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,259
There's just one more thing
I feel like

753
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,266
I have to tell you about first,
though.

754
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,100
God, I am terrified to tell you,
but I'm gonna tell you.

755
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,469
Can you do me a favor
and sort of brace yourself

756
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,598
and promise not to react

757
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,074
for a few seconds
after I tell you?

758
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,406
Can you promise?

759
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,843
Can you promise?

760
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,072
Can you promise?

761
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,105
Can you promise?

762
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:56,388
Maybe we should talk later.

763
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,328
I've got a rehearsal
for this thing,

764
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:03,663
and think I have a break
for a couple hours

765
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,864
if you wanted to...

766
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:07,871
you know what?

767
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,341
I'll call you.

768
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:15,709
I'm here if you need me.

769
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,010
Okay?

770
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:24,483
Why?

771
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,218
Why did you do it?

772
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:31,024
How could you do it?

773
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,897
That's all I ever get,
is this face,

774
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,798
this remorseful face of yours.

775
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,234
You had the same face
when you left.

776
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,229
You just stood there
with this look.

777
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,739
What?

778
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:54,581
You fucking coward.

779
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:59,215
You are all cowards.

780
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,090
You say you were unfaithful.

781
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,823
You say you're sorry.

782
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:09,162
You say you can't imagine
how much it must hurt.

783
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,167
And I can't.

784
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:14,797
Try.

785
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,136
Try.

786
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,806
Well, call him and see
if he'II, you know,

787
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,834
set up something.

788
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:26,509
But it needs to be soon,
I would think, right?

789
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,418
Yeah.

790
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,818
Okay.

791
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,847
Bye.

792
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,419
Professor?

793
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,759
Oh, Sara.

794
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,162
Hi.

795
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,598
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

796
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:43,600
No, no, no.

797
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,623
Please, come in.

798
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,603
Just grab the door.

799
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:54,711
This okay?

800
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:55,769
Yeah.
How are you?

801
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,576
- Fine, thanks.
- I was just... that was my wife.

802
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,607
She's... her mother's kind of
going through a little...

803
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,380
anyway,
it's kind of hard on her.

804
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,379
That's... gosh, I'm so sorry.

805
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,391
Oh, no, no, no, no.

806
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,585
I don't mean to make
a big deal...

807
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,615
No, no, it's okay.

808
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,958
I mean, it's gonna be fine.

809
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,988
No, my wife,
she's an extraordinary woman.

810
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,021
Yeah.

811
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:20,128
She's... I've been married
for 21 years,

812
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:24,335
and my wife
is just so beautiful,

813
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,070
just a beautiful woman.

814
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,509
How'd you meet her?

815
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,512
That's funny.

816
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,446
I was just thinking about that,
the day I met her.

817
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,450
Yeah, I was thinking
about this moment,

818
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:36,578
and, it was such
a long time ago,

819
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,316
you know,
and I was so young.

820
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,789
And I was thinking...

821
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,258
and this was a big reason
for marrying her...

822
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,091
thinking that I was likely
not gonna do better than this,

823
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,687
you know, because of the way
she looked.

824
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,063
I mean she was so beautiful,
that just...

825
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,261
even after she had a kid,
by the way.

826
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,099
So and I thought,

827
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,331
"God, you know,"...

828
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,636
'cause I had always had
this major dread when I was,

829
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,438
you know, before I got married
that, you know,

830
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,069
that I'd marry some
amazing woman,

831
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,443
beautiful woman
and everything,

832
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,313
and then she'd change, you know,
that she would get pregnant.

833
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,011
And then it would
change her and, you know...

834
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,280
And I'd have to convince myself,

835
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,844
"No, no, this is who
you signed up with.

836
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,152
"This is who you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with.

837
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,920
"This is who you're
gonna be with

838
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,326
for the whole
rest of your life."

839
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:23,800
God, this just sounds terrible,

840
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:24,801
so shallow.

841
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,735
Doesn't it?

842
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,331
But I looked at her,
and she was beautiful,

843
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,635
and she was a mother.

844
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:34,873
And, you know,
I remember thinking,

845
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:39,349
"This is amazing,
because it's like she's already,

846
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:43,786
you know, pretested."

847
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,788
Yeah, pretested.

848
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,724
And, I thought...
I actually thought about that.

849
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:49,726
I thought that.

850
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,287
And I...

851
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,821
Is it shallow?

852
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,298
Does it sound shallow?

853
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,303
Or do you think the truth
behind this kind of thing

854
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,933
will always sound shallow,

855
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:08,638
you know,
everybody's real reasons?

856
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,311
Crab cake?

857
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,014
Hey, Miss Quinn.

858
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,022
I stopped by your office hours
earlier this week.

859
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,856
You must've been...

860
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:28,126
but I'd love to know what you
thought of my paper.

861
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,156
All right, listen,
that's just ridiculous.

862
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,190
Well, I'm sorry, Harry,

863
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,896
but that is my opinion
you're stepping on.

864
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,734
Well, the holidays are
a chance to have fun.

865
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,296
You know, this whole moral
oppression thing

866
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,329
is fuckin' lame.

867
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,967
- Harry.
- What?

868
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:39,998
I don't need to be guilted

869
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,636
into analyzing
my whole year's actions.

870
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,805
Wow.

871
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,576
You know, I'll change
when I want to change.

872
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,242
It doesn't have to be
in December, you know?

873
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,341
It just feels forced.

874
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,353
Okay, and you got all this
from a kid's show?

875
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,877
But it's television,
for God's sake.

876
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:51,945
You know?

877
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,390
I want to watch people revel
and be merry, you know?

878
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,656
I want to watch
pretty things and, like,

879
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,663
funny things
and, like, singy things.

880
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,789
Oh.

881
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,798
Singy things?

882
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,528
No, hey, I want to learn
how to revel.

883
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,001
Please, sign me up.
Which hall?

884
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,503
Where're we...
where're we doing that?

885
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,563
- What's the argument?
- It's nothing.

886
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,801
No, it's not nothing.

887
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,365
No, I'm probably just tired.

888
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,399
Tired or depressed.

889
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,968
I'm not depressed.
I'm not depressed.

890
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:15,979
Not clinically.

891
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,002
Are you okay?

892
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,207
I'm fine.

893
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,513
It's just, the holidays
are always weird for me.

894
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,576
Well, the holidays
in general, or...

895
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,611
Okay, you know, is it weird
to get so depressed

896
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,350
watching a children's
Christmas special...

897
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,187
Oh, wait, I shouldn't say that.

898
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,556
I mean, that's not a good word.

899
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,084
It's not just "sadness,"

900
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:36,361
the way one feels sad
at a film or a funeral.

901
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,301
It's more of
a plummeting quality.

902
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,497
Or the way, you know,

903
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:47,705
the way that light gets
in winter just before dusk,

904
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:54,082
or the way she is with me.

905
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,145
All right, at the height
of lovemaking,

906
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:02,148
you know, the very height,
when she's starting to climax,

907
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,128
and she's really responding
to you now,

908
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,323
you know, her eyes widening
in that way

909
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,731
that's both, you know,
surprise and recognition,

910
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,362
which not a woman alive
could fake or feign

911
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,669
if you really look intently
at her, really see her.

912
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,299
And I don't know,

913
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:26,841
this moment has
this piercing sadness to it,

914
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:31,184
of the loss of her in her eyes.

915
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:36,182
And as her eyes, you know,
widen to their widest point

916
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:42,928
and as she begins to climax
and arch her back, they close.

917
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,434
You know, shut, the eyes do.

918
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:50,202
And I can tell that she's closed
her eyes to shut me out.

919
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,768
You know,
I become like an intruder.

920
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,247
And behind those closed lids,
you know,

921
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,181
her eyes are now
rolled all the way around

922
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,741
and staring intently inward
into some void

923
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:06,222
where I, who sent them,
can't follow.

924
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:12,662
It's the ones that act
all understanding,

925
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,720
like they don't care,

926
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,459
and it's okay,
and they understand,

927
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,957
and it doesn't matter,
that embarrass me the most,

928
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,868
because it is so fucking weird
to yell,

929
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,839
"Victory for the forces
of democratic freedom,"

930
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,862
when you're shooting off

931
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:27,036
that I can tell
they're totally freaked out

932
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,773
and just condescending
down to me

933
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,747
and pretending they understand.

934
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:32,771
And it's those...

935
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,249
those are the ones
where actually...

936
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,516
I actually end up
almost getting pissed off

937
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,955
and don't even feel embarrassed
not calling them

938
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,925
or totally avoiding them...

939
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,565
The ones that say,

940
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,693
"I think I could love you
anyway."

941
00:42:56,307 --> 00:43:02,041
Imagine not existing
until a man needs you...

942
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:10,111
Being there and yet not there.

943
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,180
The face he wore
in the men's room,

944
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:16,386
he couldn't take it off.

945
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,830
Six days a week, he stood there,

946
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:24,664
Saturdays a double shift.

947
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,068
The sounds.

948
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,766
How do you forget
the unmistakable sounds

949
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:35,302
of urine into water,

950
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:39,840
the rustle of newspapers
in the stalls,

951
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:46,846
the rumble
of the toilet paper dispensers?

952
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:52,260
All sounds magnified,
reverberating slightly.

953
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:59,258
This was
my father's environment.

954
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,205
Top-rated historical hotel
in the state.

955
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,732
The finest lobby,

956
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:11,441
the single finest men's room
between the two coasts, surely:

957
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,677
marble shipped from Italy,

958
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:17,346
stall doors of seasoned cherry,

959
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,381
scalloped basins,
opulent and echoing,

960
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,518
all sounds amplified

961
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,553
by the tile
and Florentine stone.

962
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,031
The odors,

963
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,092
all the odors,

964
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:36,402
odors as environment, all day,

965
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,135
nine hours a day,

966
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,372
standing there
in Good Humor white.

967
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,642
It's what he stands in.

968
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,774
Sonic center,

969
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,979
The place where the shine stand
used to be,

970
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,422
the place designed
for him to stand.

971
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,891
Just outside
of the large mirror's frame

972
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:58,087
by the sink,

973
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:01,427
a continuous sink of marble,

974
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,901
leaves of gold foil
around the fixtures

975
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:07,267
and mirrors.

976
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,205
This is his occupation.

977
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,366
This is his career.

978
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,502
He takes their briefcase
and their topcoats,

979
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:19,141
guards them, remembers without
asking whose is whose,

980
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:25,918
speaking as little as possible
in all those acoustics,

981
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:31,053
appearing at men's elbows
to hand them a towel.

982
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:35,327
This is my father's career.

983
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,923
Why this?

984
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,902
Why this tradition?

985
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:43,839
Large opulent room
for men of business,

986
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,342
substantial men,

987
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:50,073
men with places to go
and people to see.

988
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,274
Men of substance

989
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,113
who flush the toilet
with their feet,

990
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,450
men who will touch fixtures
only with tissue,

991
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,946
men who blow their nose
in the sinks

992
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,824
and walks off without rinsing.

993
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:07,729
The door tells
the whole story.

994
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,199
"Men."

995
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:14,466
The task is to stand there
as if you are not there.

996
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,938
Not really.

997
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:16,940
There's a trick.

998
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,499
You hear everything,

999
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,841
some tapping, some humming,

1000
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,870
some speaking aloud
to themselves,

1001
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,712
forgetting they are not alone.

1002
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,378
Imagine to attend,

1003
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:33,947
to see men of substance
at their most elemental.

1004
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:37,688
This is his career,
a career man.

1005
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:42,028
And, yes,
do I admire the fortitude

1006
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:46,764
of this humblest of working men,
stoicism,

1007
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,534
the old-world grit,

1008
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:53,703
standing there all these years,
never a day sick,

1009
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:57,236
serving?

1010
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:01,581
Or do I despise him?

1011
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,882
You're wondering.

1012
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,617
Feel disgust?

1013
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,354
Men who tip,
men who do not tip,

1014
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:13,693
millionaires who don't
wash their hands,

1015
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,096
heirs who steal towels,

1016
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:19,296
tycoons who pick their noses
with their thumb,

1017
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,931
philanthropists who throw
cigar butts on the floor,

1018
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:26,272
self-made men
who spit in the sink.

1019
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,905
Plain white shirt
and white pants

1020
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,279
and white shoes
he'd have to throw out

1021
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:36,309
if so much as a spot...

1022
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,049
He bleached his work clothes
himself

1023
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,249
and ironed them.

1024
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:45,250
Never a word of complaint.

1025
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:51,894
Food on the table, a roof,

1026
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,870
children to educate.

1027
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,897
A double shift, if I could.

1028
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:07,216
His arches would swell
from the standing.

1029
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:12,883
He showered three times daily,
scrubbed himself raw.

1030
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:17,257
But the job still followed him.

1031
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:21,492
Never a word.

1032
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:25,865
Every morning up at 6:00.

1033
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,134
Kiss you all good-bye.

1034
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:35,111
A piece of toast for the bus.

1035
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:43,916
He stands there
when it's empty too.

1036
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:50,454
I haven't seen my father
since 1978.

1037
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:56,922
And I know he's still there,
all in white,

1038
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,528
standing,

1039
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:08,568
averting his eyes
to preserve their dignity.

1040
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,549
I wear nothing white,

1041
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:22,923
not one white thing.

1042
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:31,891
I eliminate in silence
or not at all.

1043
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:37,168
I tip.

1044
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,199
I never forget someone is there.

1045
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,291
Hi.

1046
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,292
Hello, Daniel.

1047
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,816
Is there something
I can help you with?

1048
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:00,193
Yeah, well,
I finally got my paper back.

1049
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,858
I was wondering whether
we could talk about it.

1050
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,423
Well, Daniel,
right now I'm actually

1051
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,833
in the middle
of my own research.

1052
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,632
What didn't you like?

1053
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,729
I'm sorry?

1054
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,138
Which parts didn't you like?

1055
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,766
Daniel, it's not that
I didn't like it.

1056
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,107
My comments are based
more on your presentation.

1057
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,670
What does that mean,
my presentation?

1058
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,841
Did it upset you?

1059
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:20,850
Did it what?

1060
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,545
No, it didn't upset me.

1061
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:27,182
It certainly was provocative,
but that's never bad.

1062
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,489
And certain points
you made were...

1063
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,427
Which was your favorite?

1064
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,657
My favorite?

1065
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,325
Well, I think it's important
for me to know

1066
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,392
which parts of the paper
pushed the limits.

1067
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,097
I don't want to be accused
of doing something

1068
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,435
just for shock value.

1069
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,967
Okay.

1070
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,879
"Who are we to say getting
incested or abused or violated

1071
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,579
"or any of those things
can't also have

1072
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,386
their positive aspects
in the long run?"

1073
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:05,157
Now, that's shocking,
especially as a woman.

1074
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:08,858
See, you... you misunderstood
what I was saying.

1075
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,332
Look, I guess all
I was trying to say is,

1076
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:13,666
you have to be careful
of taking a knee-jerk attitude.

1077
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,694
I think a knee-jerk attitude
to anything is a mistake,

1078
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,400
especially in the case of women,

1079
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:20,877
where it adds up to this very
limited and condescending thing

1080
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,708
of saying they're fragile,

1081
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,010
breakable things
that can be destroyed easily.

1082
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:29,781
Everybody gets hurt and violated
and broken sometimes.

1083
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,516
Why are women so special?

1084
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,854
Not that anybody ever
ought to be raped or abused.

1085
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:35,880
Nobody's saying that.

1086
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:41,125
But that's while it's going on.

1087
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:44,725
What about afterwards?

1088
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,735
All I'm saying is,

1089
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:49,068
there are certain cases
where it can enlarge you

1090
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,937
or make you more
of a complete human being,

1091
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,168
like Victor Frankl.

1092
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,176
What?

1093
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,507
Well think about
the Holocaust.

1094
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:55,511
Daniel, that's...

1095
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,035
Was the Holocaust
a good thing? No way.

1096
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,105
Does anybody think that
it was good that it happened?

1097
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,138
No, of course not.

1098
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,014
But did you read Victor Frankl,

1099
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,747
Victor Frankl's
<i>Man's Search For Meaning?</i>

1100
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,982
It's a great, great book.

1101
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,582
But it comes out
of his experience.

1102
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:13,653
It's about his experience
in the human dark side.

1103
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:16,359
Now, think about it.

1104
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,867
If there was no Holocaust,

1105
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,996
there'd be no
<i>Man's Search For Meaning.</i>

1106
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:28,342
Why don't we talk about this
at office hours?

1107
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:33,947
- Hi, Miss Quinn...
- Daniel, I'm...

1108
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,542
You said to meet
at office hours.

1109
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:36,574
I'm in the middle of work.

1110
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,110
You can't just walk
right into the room.

1111
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,589
I just want to know why
you hate it so much.

1112
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,591
Fine.

1113
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:42,614
I thought it was easy.

1114
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,957
I thought your claims about
women were wild and incendiary,

1115
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,020
and I think you absolutely
wrote it for shock value.

1116
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:48,030
And quite frankly,

1117
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,157
I'm not interested
in discussing any further

1118
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,566
some paper that exemplifies
some pent-up,

1119
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,162
overdeveloped teen angst.

1120
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,730
I'm impressed my paper
got to you like that.

1121
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,708
Daniel, I don't think
you understand.

1122
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:01,176
There is no point.

1123
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,178
No one cares.

1124
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,646
Careful.

1125
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,875
That's not true.

1126
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,611
Think about it.

1127
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,618
Think about what?

1128
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,846
About being degraded
and brought

1129
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,410
to within an inch of your life,
for example.

1130
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,718
No one's gonna say
the sick bastards that did it

1131
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:14,815
shouldn't be put in jail.

1132
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,122
But let's put two things
into perspective here.

1133
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,560
One is, afterwards, she knows
something about herself

1134
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,893
that she never knew before.

1135
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,057
All I'm saying is,

1136
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,589
there are certain cases
where it can enlarge you.

1137
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:27,296
What she knows is that
the most totally terrible,

1138
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,770
terrifying thing
that she could ever

1139
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:32,935
have imagined happening to her
has now happened.

1140
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,068
And she survived.

1141
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,236
She's still here.

1142
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,007
Make you more
of a complete human being,

1143
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,139
like Victor Frankl.

1144
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,911
And now she knows something.

1145
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,977
I mean, she really,
really knows.

1146
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,820
Now, that's shocking,
especially as a woman.

1147
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:48,824
No.

1148
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,689
See, I'm disappointed in you.

1149
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,525
That's what I'm talking about,
the knee-jerk attitude,

1150
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,121
Taking everything I say
and filtering it

1151
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,655
through your narrow view
of the world.

1152
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,429
Look, totally terrible
things happen.

1153
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,902
Now, you want my opinion?

1154
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,371
Existence and life
break people in all kinds

1155
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,306
of awful fucking ways
all the time.

1156
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,331
Trust me, I know.

1157
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:07,434
I've been there.

1158
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,308
And this is the big difference,
you and me here,

1159
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,904
because this isn't
about politics

1160
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,471
or feminism or whatever.

1161
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,880
For you, this is just ideas.

1162
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,282
You've never been there.

1163
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:16,285
Sara.

1164
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,446
Can I talk to you a sec?

1165
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,754
I'm not saying nothing bad
has ever happened to you.

1166
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,523
You're not bad-looking.

1167
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,861
I'm sure there's been some sort
of degradation or whatever

1168
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:29,887
come your way in life.

1169
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,922
But I'm talking

1170
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,798
Victor Frankl's
<i>Man's Search For Meaning type</i>

1171
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:35,100
violation and terror
and suffering here,

1172
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,231
the real dark side.

1173
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,639
Daniel came
into my office today.

1174
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,609
Professor, let me explain...

1175
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:43,875
He said that he was looking
to talk to you about his paper.

1176
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:51,251
I can tell from just looking
at you, you never.

1177
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,348
Wouldn't even wear
what you're wearing.

1178
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,551
Trust me.

1179
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,924
Listen, I just wanted you to
know that I'm taking care of it.

1180
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,759
I basically told him to,
you know, give it another shot.

1181
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,355
I know how persistent he can be.

1182
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:06,130
Miss Quinn.

1183
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,137
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

1184
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,263
There's just one more thing

1185
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,467
I feel like I have to tell you
about first, though.

1186
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,776
What if I told you it was
my own sister that was raped?

1187
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,410
What if I told you
a little story

1188
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:25,615
about a 16-year-old girl
who went to the wrong party

1189
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,350
with the wrong guy

1190
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:32,123
and four of his buddies
that ended up doing to her

1191
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,687
just about everything
four guys could do to you

1192
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,130
in terms of violation.

1193
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,633
"Here we go, bitch.

1194
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,134
Here we go!"

1195
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,400
But if you could ask her

1196
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:46,375
if she could go into her head
and, and forget it or, like,

1197
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,741
erase the tape of it happening
in her memory,

1198
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,975
what do you think she'd say?

1199
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,414
Are you so sure what she'd say?

1200
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,886
That's while it's going on.

1201
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,217
What about afterwards?

1202
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,017
What if she said
that even after that,

1203
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,751
totally negative
as what happened was,

1204
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,851
at least now she understood
it was possible.

1205
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,293
People can.

1206
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,523
Can what?

1207
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:10,192
Can see you as a thing,

1208
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,463
that people can see you
as a thing.

1209
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,799
Do you know what that means?

1210
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,236
Men are mostly shits.

1211
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,238
It's true.

1212
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,763
Because if you can really just
see somebody as a thing,

1213
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:19,968
you can do anything to him.

1214
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,374
And I know,
I know a better guy

1215
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,605
probably would've
told you about this

1216
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,203
before we even slept together.

1217
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:26,943
What would it be like
to be able to be like that?

1218
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,450
You see, you think you can
imagine it,

1219
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,747
but you can't.

1220
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:30,912
But she can.

1221
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,615
And now she knows something.

1222
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,659
Sorry.

1223
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,354
I tried calling earlier.

1224
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,990
I mean she really,
really knows.

1225
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:46,468
You cut your hair.

1226
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,697
It looks good.

1227
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,999
This is what you wanted
to hear.

1228
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,835
You wanted to hear
about four drunk guys

1229
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,399
who knee jerked you in the balls
to make you bend over

1230
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,775
that you didn't even know,
that you never saw before,

1231
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,077
that you never did anything to,
that don't even know your name,

1232
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,242
that don't even know your name,

1233
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:04,014
to find out you have to choose
to have a fucking name.

1234
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,782
You have no fucking idea!

1235
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,757
And what if I said
that happened to me?

1236
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:17,391
Would that make a difference?

1237
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,934
Why don't we talk about this
at office hours?

1238
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,270
Okay.

1239
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,037
Office hours this week?

1240
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,805
Yes.

1241
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:33,043
Good luck.

1242
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,220
What does today's woman want?

1243
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,861
They want to be autonomous.

1244
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:53,063
Basically, it's all still
an elaborate semiotic code.

1245
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,865
And the only way not
to get lost in the code

1246
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:58,067
is to approach the whole issue
logically.

1247
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:02,476
They want you to understand
the bind that they're in.

1248
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,479
Wait.

1249
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:04,571
I want to...

1250
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:09,176
I don't mean any of this in just
another Neanderthal male

1251
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,585
trying to put women down
'cause he's too insecure.

1252
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,145
And I'd go to the wall

1253
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,783
to defend them
against any scorn

1254
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,190
or culpability for a situation

1255
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,558
which is clearly
not their fault.

1256
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,062
You can go nuts
trying to figure out

1257
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:21,085
which tack to take.

1258
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,598
I mean, they might go for it.
They might not.

1259
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,225
Today's woman is a total mess.

1260
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,532
I don't suppose you know where
the little wranglers' room is

1261
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,764
in this place, do you?

1262
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,069
The solution is to understand
today's woman.

1263
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,598
I mean, 'cause it's getting
time to answer Nature's page,

1264
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,543
if you know what I mean.

1265
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,670
The solution is to realize

1266
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,807
that today's woman is in
an impossible situation

1267
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,077
and wants what
any human being

1268
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,381
faced with two conflicting sets
of responsibilities

1269
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,887
is gonna want:
a way out.

1270
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:51,326
An escape hatch.

1271
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,194
A passionate male.

1272
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:59,566
They want to be overwhelmed
with passion.

1273
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,591
When they say,

1274
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,332
"I am responsible
for my own sexuality;

1275
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,464
"I am my own person;

1276
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,703
I don't need a man,"

1277
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:10,440
what they really
are telling you is

1278
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,419
what they want you
to make them forget, which is...

1279
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:17,419
what they're telling you

1280
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,216
is what they want you
to make them forget.

1281
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,722
They want...

1282
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:25,626
Thank you.

1283
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:52,380
Hey.

1284
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:56,085
I decided to get help.

1285
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,253
I got in touch with the fact
that the problem

1286
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:03,629
had nothing to do with her.

1287
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,327
I saw that she would forever

1288
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,097
go on playing victim
to my villain.

1289
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,764
I was...

1290
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:14,300
I was powerless to change her.

1291
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,778
Mind if I turn this on?

1292
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:17,780
No.

1293
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:18,781
Great. Thanks.

1294
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,376
Sure.

1295
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:25,683
My own father was,
you might say,

1296
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:30,682
a man who was,
by natural proclivity,

1297
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:35,221
not a good man
but who nevertheless

1298
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,358
tried diligently
to be a good man,

1299
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,167
temper and so forth.

1300
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:49,976
My father's proclivity for rage
grew over a period of time.

1301
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:54,109
And eventually,

1302
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:58,109
he resorted, after periods
of unsuccessful counseling,

1303
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,054
to the practice

1304
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:05,026
of handcuffing his own wrists
behind his back

1305
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:10,897
whenever he would lose
his temper with any of us.

1306
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:16,064
This self-restraint

1307
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:21,941
eventually progressed
over a period of years,

1308
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:26,210
such that the more enraged
he might become with any of us,

1309
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:30,481
the more coercively he began
to restrain himself.

1310
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,853
Often the day would end
with the poor man

1311
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,755
hogtied
on the living room floor,

1312
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:41,230
screaming furiously at us,

1313
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:46,998
trying to get the gag in
without getting bitten.

1314
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,937
Whatever possible use
that piece of history might be

1315
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:55,035
to anyone not privileged
to have been there.

1316
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,375
And now I look at her,

1317
01:01:56,412 --> 01:02:00,348
and I promised myself as a kid...

1318
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:04,012
I told myself
I would love my woman.

1319
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,682
And even now...
and I try so hard.

1320
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:16,530
And she's the one... she...

1321
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:21,026
she always says
that she can save me.

1322
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,972
And I think,
"There's no excuse."

1323
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:28,636
I know that.

1324
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:34,207
I think, "I have promised myself
to this woman.

1325
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:40,985
I have promised to love her."

1326
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,787
But whatever.

1327
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:47,728
Now we can explain
my proclivities

1328
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,924
and trace their origins

1329
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:53,061
and have it all tied up all nice
and tight and tidy for you.

1330
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,069
Can't we?

1331
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,504
No, wait.

1332
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,532
I know it may sound ridiculous,
but I know that she can.

1333
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,237
Can what?

1334
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,472
Save you.

1335
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:09,718
You don't know what I've done.

1336
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,320
Do you want me
to start it for you?

1337
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,988
It was a large outdoor concert
community festival thing.

1338
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,496
- Stop.
- And then you saw her there...

1339
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:22,498
Stop!

1340
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,500
Sitting on a blanket
with her amused expression.

1341
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:25,796
- Stop.
- And then you fucked her.

1342
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,302
- Stop!
- I got all of that.

1343
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:28,735
But there has to be
something more.

1344
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,706
I don't understand.

1345
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:38,509
How could you do it?

1346
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:39,606
We were in love.

1347
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,641
No, we weren't.

1348
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:59,100
Look, Sara, I know you.

1349
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:03,329
I'm aware of how all this sounds
and can well imagine

1350
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,532
the judgments you're forming.

1351
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,771
But if I'm really
to explain this to you

1352
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:12,747
then I have no choice
but to be candid.

1353
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,549
Yes, it was a pickup.

1354
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:18,918
Plain and simple.

1355
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:24,791
And she was what one might call
a granola cruncher, a hippie.

1356
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:27,159
And she was straight
out of central casting:

1357
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:30,962
the sandals,
flamboyantly long hair,

1358
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,696
financial support from parents
she reviled,

1359
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:35,033
and some professed membership

1360
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,234
in a apostrophe-heavy
Eastern religion

1361
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:42,938
that I would defy anyone
to pronounce correctly.

1362
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,675
Look, I'll just bite
the political bullet

1363
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,046
and confess
that I classified her

1364
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,948
as a strictly
one-night objective,

1365
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,782
and that my interest in her

1366
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,618
was due almost entirely
to the fact that, yes,

1367
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,021
she was pretty.

1368
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,285
She was sexually attractive.

1369
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,850
She was sexy.

1370
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,888
And it was really nothing more
complicated or noble than that.

1371
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,560
And having had
some prior dealings

1372
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:06,625
with the cruncher genus,

1373
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,660
I think the one-night proviso
was due

1374
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:10,638
mostly to the grim
unimaginability

1375
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:12,937
of having to talk with her
for more than one night.

1376
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,637
Whether or not you approve,

1377
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:19,409
I think we can assume
you understand.

1378
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:20,779
And there's something
in the way,

1379
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:24,912
I mean, a near contempt
in the way that you can

1380
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,787
casually saunter over
to her blanket

1381
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,154
and create the sense
of connection

1382
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,659
that will allow you
to pick her up.

1383
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:36,393
And you almost resent the fact
that it's so goddamn easy.

1384
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:40,528
I mean, how exploitative
you feel that it is so easy

1385
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:46,064
to get this type to regard you
as a kindred soul.

1386
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,008
I mean, you almost know what's
going to be said

1387
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,638
before she even opens her mouth.

1388
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,343
Okay.

1389
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,011
So now, there we are
in my apartment,

1390
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,920
and she begins going on
about her religious views,

1391
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,949
her obscure denomination's views
on energy fields

1392
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,223
and connections between souls

1393
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,890
via what she kept calling
"focus."

1394
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,798
And in response to some sort
of prompt or association,

1395
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,302
she begins to relate
this anecdote.

1396
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:20,003
And in the anecdote,
there she is, hitchhiking.

1397
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,438
Well, she said she knew
she made a mistake

1398
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,040
the moment she got in the car.

1399
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,745
Her explanation was
that she didn't actually feel

1400
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,776
any energy field until she
had shut the car's door

1401
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,846
and they were moving,

1402
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,584
at which point it was too late.

1403
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:37,182
And she wasn't melodramatic
about it,

1404
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:38,352
but she described herself

1405
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,693
as literally paralyzed
with terror.

1406
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:45,132
It was something
about his eyes.

1407
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,432
She said she knew instantly
in the depths of her soul

1408
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,872
that this man's intentions were
to brutally rape,

1409
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,876
torture, and kill her

1410
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,775
and that by the time
the psychotic

1411
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,370
had exited into a secluded area

1412
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,712
and actually said
what his true intentions were,

1413
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,115
she wasn't the least bit
surprised,

1414
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,379
because she knew

1415
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:06,286
that she was going to be just
another grisly discovery

1416
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:09,849
for some amateur botanist
or scout troop a few days later,

1417
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:14,591
unless she could focus her way
into a soul connection

1418
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:18,794
that would prevent this man
from murdering her.

1419
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,962
I mean, to focus intently
on this psychotic

1420
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,995
as an ensouled and beautiful,

1421
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,634
albeit tormented person,
in his own right

1422
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,508
rather than merely
as a threat to her.

1423
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,877
And I'm well aware that what
she is about describe

1424
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:32,881
is nothing more

1425
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:36,282
than a variant of the stale old
"love will conquer all."

1426
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,478
But for the moment,

1427
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,455
just bracket your contempt
and try to see

1428
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,855
what she actually has
the courage and conviction

1429
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,326
to really attempt here,

1430
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,761
because imagine what it
must have felt like for her,

1431
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:50,163
for anyone.

1432
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,167
Contemplate just how

1433
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:54,260
little-kid-level scared
you'd be...

1434
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:58,706
that this psychotic
could bring you to this point

1435
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,299
simply by wishing it.

1436
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,207
And now here she is, in the car.

1437
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:05,111
And she's realizing that she's
in for the biggest struggle

1438
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,273
of her spiritual life.

1439
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:09,375
She stares directly
into the psychopath's right eye

1440
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,750
and wills herself to keep
her gaze on him

1441
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,254
directly at all times.

1442
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,780
And the effects of her focus,

1443
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,692
she says that when she was able
to hold her focus,

1444
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:22,254
the psychopath behind the wheel
would gradually stop ranting

1445
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,232
and become tensely silent.

1446
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,258
And she wills herself
not to weep or plead

1447
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:32,639
but merely to use focus
as an opportunity to empathize.

1448
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,336
And this was my first hint
of sadness

1449
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,276
in listening to the anecdote,

1450
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:40,442
'cause I found myself admiring
certain qualities in her story

1451
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,815
that were the same qualities
I had been contemptuous of

1452
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:45,412
when I first picked her up
in the park.

1453
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:49,584
And then he asks her
to get out of the car

1454
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,650
and lie prone on the ground.

1455
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:54,891
And she doesn't hesitate or beg.

1456
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:57,364
She was experiencing
a whole new depth of focus.

1457
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:02,029
She said she could hear the tick
of the cooling car, bees, birds.

1458
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:04,232
Imagine the temptation
to despair

1459
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,206
in the sound
of carefree birds

1460
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,938
only yards from where you lay
breathing in the weeds.

1461
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,138
And in this heightened state,

1462
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:12,511
she said she could feel
the psychotic realizing

1463
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:15,642
the truth of the situation
at the same time she did.

1464
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:19,211
When he came over to her
and turned her over,

1465
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:21,621
he was crying.

1466
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,750
And she claimed it took
no effort of will

1467
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,659
to hold him as he wept

1468
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:30,495
as he raped her.

1469
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:35,493
She just stared into his eyes
lovingly the entire time.

1470
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:38,302
She stayed where he left her
all day in the gravel,

1471
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:42,276
weeping and giving thanks
to her religious principles.

1472
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:47,510
She wept out of gratitude,
she says.

1473
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,744
Well, I don't mind telling you.

1474
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:51,878
I had begun to cry
at the story's climax.

1475
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,185
Not loudly, but I did.

1476
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:57,522
She had learned more about love
that day with the sex offender

1477
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,894
than in any other stage
of her spiritual journey.

1478
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,455
And I realized in that moment

1479
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:06,332
that I had never loved
anyone before.

1480
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,826
She had addressed
the psychotic's core weakness,

1481
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,999
the terror of a soul-exposing
connection

1482
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,602
with another human being.

1483
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,909
Nor is any of this
all that different

1484
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,544
than a man sizing up
an attractive girl at a concert

1485
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,417
and pushing all the right
buttons to induce her

1486
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:27,615
to come home with him
and lighting her cigarettes

1487
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,591
and engaging in an hour
of post-coital chitchat,

1488
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,060
seemingly very content
and close.

1489
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,426
But what he really wants to do

1490
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,761
is give her a special
disconnected telephone number

1491
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,699
and never contact her again.

1492
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,828
And that the reason for this
cold and victimizing behavior

1493
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,634
is that the very connection
that he had worked so hard

1494
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:49,542
to make her feel terrifies him.

1495
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:55,877
Do you see how open
I'm being with you here?

1496
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,099
Well, I know I'm not
telling you anything

1497
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,702
that you haven't already decided
that you know.

1498
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,509
I can see you forming judgments,

1499
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:29,574
with that chilly smile.

1500
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,985
You're not the only one who can
read people, you know.

1501
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:33,989
And you know what?

1502
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,285
It's because of her influence

1503
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:39,761
that I am more sad for you
than pissed off,

1504
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,696
because the impact of this story
was profound,

1505
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:45,222
and I'm not even gonna begin
to describe it to you.

1506
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:48,293
Can you imagine how any
of this felt,

1507
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,828
to look at her sandals
across the room on the floor

1508
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,671
and remember what I had thought
of them only hours before?

1509
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,143
And I'd say her name
and she'd say, "What?"

1510
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,510
And I'd say her name again.

1511
01:11:58,547 --> 01:11:59,673
Well, I'm not embarrassed.

1512
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:04,243
I don't care how
this sounds to you now.

1513
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:11,283
I mean, can you see how I could
not just let her go after this?

1514
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:15,127
I just, I grabbed onto her skirt
and I begged her not to leave.

1515
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,859
And then I watched her
gently close the door

1516
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:20,300
and walk off barefoot
down the hall

1517
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:24,864
and never seeing her again.

1518
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,067
That it didn't matter

1519
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,542
that she was fluffy
or not terribly bright...

1520
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:30,545
nothing else mattered.

1521
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:31,705
She had all of my attention.

1522
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:36,150
I had fallen in love with her.

1523
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:41,652
I believed that she
could save me.

1524
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,718
Well, I'm aware of how
all this sounds.

1525
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,059
I can see that look
on your face.

1526
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,031
And I know you.

1527
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:52,761
And I know what you're thinking.

1528
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,359
So ask it.

1529
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,427
Ask it now.

1530
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:57,803
This is your chance.

1531
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,432
"I believe she could save me,"
I said.

1532
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:02,706
Ask it now.

1533
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:06,738
Say something!

1534
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:12,311
I stand here naked before you.

1535
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,346
Judge me, you bitch.

1536
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,290
You happy now?

1537
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:29,202
You all borne out?

1538
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,604
Well, be happy,
because I don't care.

1539
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,766
I knew she could.

1540
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,469
And I knew I loved.

1541
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:38,503
End of story.

1542
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,100
Okay, what do we got?

1543
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,541
I've been looking
in completely the wrong place.

1544
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,545
You've been look...
what do you mean?

1545
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,807
My research

1546
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,077
in studying the effects
of the feminist movement.

1547
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,083
It's redundant.

1548
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,176
Everybody knows
how it affected women.

1549
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,744
I think the real opportunity
to learn something

1550
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,585
is in looking at men.

1551
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,251
Okay, I'll buy that.

1552
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,591
So, I want to set up
interviews.

1553
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,255
I want to get primary research.

1554
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,162
I want to hear it.

1555
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,666
Sara, listen,
you and I both know

1556
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,497
that the review board,
they can be killers

1557
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:36,197
if they find someone's work
to be frivolous or impulsive,

1558
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,069
and everyone's
gonna want to know why.

1559
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,233
Because I don't think
the truth about men

1560
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,505
can be found in a book.

1561
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,136
The real impact is specific.

1562
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,306
And I feel like if I can get
a few of these men

1563
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:47,474
to open up with real stories

1564
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:50,349
about their desires
and their fears,

1565
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,751
then I can begin to get answers.

1566
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,779
Okay, and what is it
you want answers to?

1567
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:55,790
Well...

1568
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,758
No, I don't need to know.

1569
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:58,760
But you do.

1570
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:33,724
# Every man I fall for #

1571
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:39,291
# drinks his coffee black #

1572
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:43,794
# "Love" and "hate" are tattooed
on his knuckles #

1573
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:48,037
# and my name is on his back #

1574
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:08,256
# Every man I fall for #

1575
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:14,361
# works the graveyard shift #

1576
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:20,000
# He kisses me softly
to wake me up #

1577
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:24,138
# and takes my place in bed #

1578
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:34,051
# And I fall #

1579
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:39,356
# I live with one concern #

1580
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:44,923
# It's the law #

1581
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:50,064
# Diminishing returns #

1582
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:55,543
# It's the law #

1583
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:58,978
