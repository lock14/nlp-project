1
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:51,815
Who am I?

2
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:53,952
You sure you want to know?

3
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:56,913
Truth is, I'm a nobody.

4
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:59,249
Actually, I'm worse than a nobody.

5
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,314
I'm this guy.

6
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:04,479
Stop!
Stop the bus!

7
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,105
The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart.

8
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:20,245
Thanks.

9
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:22,443
But, like any story worth telling,

10
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,471
it's all about a girl.

11
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:27,467
Not that girl.

12
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:30,135
- Hey. Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.

13
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,519
No, it's about this girl...

14
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,406
Jill Johnson.

15
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:38,201
Ever since I can remember
I've been in love with her,

16
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,669
but she barely knows I exist.

17
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,757
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!

18
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,455
I got you a seat down here. What's...

19
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:44,854
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.

20
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,494
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.

21
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,363
Dude, I'm so psyched
for this class trip.

22
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,288
We about to see some real
serious cutting-edge shit.

23
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,667
That's what I'm talking about.

24
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,632
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?

25
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,121
Got that new sandwich
from Sony in my backpack.

26
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:59,351
Wi-Fi... mmm!

27
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:03,259
Yo! You got to forget about her, dawg.

28
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,177
Look look.
Let me show you something.

29
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,732
She not even looking at you.

30
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:09,531
If I could just tell her how I feel.

31
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:11,520
Look, Rick, I already told you...

32
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:13,173
you never gonna get
with Jill, all right?

33
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:14,838
Seriously, she hangs out
with the popular crew,

34
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,240
and nobody messes around
outside their group, man.

35
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,510
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.

36
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:21,480
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.

37
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,302
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.

38
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,757
...nerds, emos,

39
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,961
Frodos,

40
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,339
the Scarface society...

41
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,964
...the sexual predators.
- Yeah.

42
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:35,460
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?

43
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,229
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.

44
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:39,856
But you know what?
Who cares?

45
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:41,818
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.

46
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:43,636
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.

47
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,314
- Am I in?
- No.

48
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,352
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.

49
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:49,936
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?

50
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,340
You look good today.
I like your hair.

51
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,946
I'm gonna show you
something nasty I downloaded.

52
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,577
Don't tell nobody.

53
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:57,880
Welcome to Amalgamated.

54
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:59,846
I'm Dr. Strom,
head of the research department...

55
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:02,772
- Come on, man.
- ... where we create the future today.

56
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:06,053
And now I'd like
to show you our crown jewel.

57
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:09,017
The Amalgamated animal genetics lab.

58
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:13,408
Go ahead, explore.

59
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,116
Yo yo. Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.

60
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:18,448
All of our animals are
genetically engineered

61
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,911
and each of them has...

62
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,812
Oh, you're so pretty.

63
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:25,600
Hi, birdie.

64
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:27,919
Hi. Hi.

65
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:32,943
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

66
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:36,425
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her

67
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:38,074
for the school newspaper.

68
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,173
Our only rules: Don't feed the animals

69
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:42,954
and please,
no flash photography.

70
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,419
Some of our genetically-
engineered animals

71
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,370
are a little sensitive to light.

72
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:52,573
It flew away.

73
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,880
Uh... whoo-hoo.

74
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,748
What the F, loser?

75
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:05,392
- Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.

76
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:08,563
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.

77
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:11,285
Is there a problem, Lance?

78
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:14,903
No. No problem, Uncle Lou.

79
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:16,937
Mr. Landers!

80
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:19,417
Students, this is Lou Landers,

81
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,460
visionary scientist
and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.

82
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,120
Well, I'm just a businessman now.

83
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,323
The future of science

84
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,363
belongs to all of you.

85
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:32,318
Please, enjoy the tour.

86
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:41,758
Are you okay?

87
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,837
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.

88
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,421
Rick Riker. You're not Blaine and Julia
Riker's son, are you?

89
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,333
- I am.
- Ah. Good people.

90
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,506
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.

91
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,275
But otherwise okay?

92
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,038
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.

93
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:04,738
Well, you seem
like a real chip off the old block.

94
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:07,004
Let's hope you're not
violently murdered too.

95
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:15,787
That's for making me look stupid.

96
00:07:15,787 --> 00:07:18,022
Next time I hurt you.

97
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:20,931
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.

98
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,272
Our work with these animals
has helped us develop

99
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:29,397
new antibiotics,
advanced pesticides

100
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:33,113
and a powerful new pheromone
which drives animals to mate

101
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:35,449
called compound H2O9.

102
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,947
It's a strong sexual attractant.

103
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,800
A single drop is enough
to arouse any animal.

104
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,417
We plan on using it to breed
endangered species.

105
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:48,037
A special and indeed
often overlooked...

106
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:50,921
Our most-promising research

107
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:53,054
is with these dragonflies.

108
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:55,436
For example,
this dragonfly's skin

109
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:57,738
has a hard,
armor-like exoskeleton

110
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,110
to defend against...

111
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,817
And this species of dragonfly

112
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,046
has enormous strength for its size.

113
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,510
It can lift vast amounts.

114
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,750
More than it's body weight.

115
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:12,215
And here we've injected the DNA
from all three species

116
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,588
into seven new genetically-enhanced

117
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:16,355
super dragonflies.

118
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,168
But there's only six in there.

119
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:22,525
Well, one missing dragonfly
is the least of my concerns.

120
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,796
I lost six tigers alone last month.

121
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:32,270
This area is where
we keep our livestock.

122
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,532
Aren't you going to do something?

123
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:44,175
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.

124
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:55,386
I see. Ye... well,
yes, I understand.

125
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,557
Thank you for the call.

126
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,997
That was the principal.

127
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,236
Rick walked off a class trip.

128
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,186
After all the parenting you've done,

129
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,092
he's still so troubled.

130
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,239
Why do you think that is, Albert?

131
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:12,173
I have no idea, Lucille.

132
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,763
I have taught him everything I know
about being a man.

133
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,000
And a good man you are

134
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,175
after all these years of marriage.

135
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,683
It's like we first met.

136
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:23,025
Sure, you're a little older.

137
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,661
Your hair's grey.

138
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,028
You have crow's feet.

139
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:28,565
It takes you an hour to pee.

140
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:30,736
Your thighs look like cottage cheese

141
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:32,649
someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.

142
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:36,332
And you've always had a tiny penis.

143
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,963
Well... what does it matter
when you're in love?

144
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,934
Oh, Rick.

145
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,190
We were wondering where you were.

146
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,352
It's so late.

147
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,618
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.

148
00:09:55,618 --> 00:09:57,690
You can sleep late in the morning,

149
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,560
but don't forget to feed the fish.

150
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,727
Attaboy.

151
00:10:05,402 --> 00:10:07,337
I don't know.

152
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,237
Something just doesn't seem
quite right with him today.

153
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,972
Teenagers. I'll talk to him.

154
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:19,358
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.

155
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,312
Puberty is a difficult time

156
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,315
in a young man's life.

157
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:26,492
Now this book may explain
what's happening.

158
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:30,118
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention,

159
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,336
and once a month you'll bleed
from your vagina.

160
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,554
This may be the wrong book.

161
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:39,425
What's important is that you're on
the verge of adulthood.

162
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,486
Here... take a drink.

163
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:45,114
Ah, the rituals of manhood.

164
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,848
Today you have your first beer,

165
00:10:46,924 --> 00:10:48,861
and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.

166
00:10:58,464 --> 00:11:01,326
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.

167
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:03,398
Please, sir, if you could just
wait a few minutes...

168
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:05,096
I've waited long enough
for this egomaniac.

169
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:08,961
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.

170
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:12,516
You see, I have a terminal illness.

171
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,621
I've been fighting it for years,

172
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:17,392
but the disease has ravaged my organs.

173
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:20,989
As of this moment,
I have one hour left to live.

174
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:25,638
It was on sale.

175
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,302
Gentlemen, if you're ready,

176
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:31,869
allow me to show you the future.

177
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,751
What the hell is that?

178
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,982
An innovation...
thank you...

179
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:40,914
that will not only save my life

180
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:42,816
but the life of this company.

181
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:46,276
For too long we've scraped out profits
from pills and injections.

182
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:48,919
The real prize is the total cure.

183
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,625
A device that can alter DNA

184
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,528
and restore the body to perfect health.

185
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,236
- You're crazy.
- No.

186
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:59,811
Crazy is hearing voices,
talking to cats,

187
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:01,615
dating Paula Abdul.

188
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:04,599
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!

189
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,505
Sir.
Sir, the machine's

190
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,887
never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...

191
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,179
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.

192
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:18,956
Plasma level is steady.

193
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:21,167
Genetic modification's
at optimum levels!

194
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:23,901
Sir, the core is overheating.

195
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:26,592
We have to abort!

196
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,678
Did it work?

197
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:37,243
I'm so sorry.

198
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:39,721
Well, well, well.

199
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,867
I want you to know
what a joy it will be

200
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,477
running this company
without you in the way.

201
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:50,882
Let go.
Let me go.

202
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:14,741
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made
some personnel changes.

203
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:20,042
No, get away!

204
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,745
Oh. How long was I asleep?

205
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:39,634
Five days.

206
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:49,455
Wait.
Wha...

207
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:00,329
Oh, Dad.

208
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,739
I thought you'd live forever.

209
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,296
Breakfast, Rick!

210
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:02,474
I'll be right down!

211
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,552
If I can have your attention.

212
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,069
We are delighted to have as guest judge

213
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:15,319
the foremost scientist in the world.

214
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:18,615
He's a visiting professor
at Empire City University

215
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,273
where he's working
with the rare element cerillium.

216
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,871
I am so proud to welcome
Dr. Stephen Hawking.

217
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:33,192
Thank you for that warm welcome.

218
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,711
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.

219
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:39,798
I cannot walk and I use
this computer to speak.

220
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:44,330
But I am not depressed,
because I have the gift of knowledge.

221
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,447
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.

222
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:51,639
But you should all be happy
with your lives.

223
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:54,636
You can walk, talk,
wipe your own asses

224
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:56,441
and then there's all the sex.

225
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,358
I haven't had sex in years.

226
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:02,959
My nurse is a lesbian,
and not the hot kind.

227
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:06,508
Hey, anyone want to get high?

228
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:09,144
I've got some hash with me.

229
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,212
White guy in the dreads,

230
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,841
you know what I'm talking about.

231
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:16,357
Anyone? Anyone?

232
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:18,254
Pussies!

233
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:34,488
Watch where you're going
in slo-mo, dipshit.

234
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,495
- Pfft.
- Yeah.

235
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:41,049
Go to her, stupid.

236
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:44,485
Tell her how you feel.

237
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,266
Yow.

238
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,230
Uh... he did it.

239
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,051
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!

240
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:17,229
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!

241
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:19,794
Fight fight fight!

242
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:29,835
Damn!

243
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:47,781
Get... get off me!

244
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,931
Ow ow.

245
00:18:58,062 --> 00:19:00,690
Shit shit shit shit.

246
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:49,210
Stop! Stop! Hey!

247
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,074
Get out of the way!
No brakes!

248
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,156
Get out of the way!

249
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:02,926
Ma'am, look out!

250
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,844
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.

251
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,023
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.

252
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:28,078
I... I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way,

253
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:29,572
she would've die... ah!

254
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,966
You should be really proud of yourself.

255
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,561
You're some kind of hero.

256
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:46,451
If you could excuse me.

257
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,392
There we go. Awfully nice of you
to help me out here, Trey.

258
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:55,262
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...

259
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,124
My God.

260
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,493
How did you do that?

261
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:05,662
Uh, it's easier than it looks.

262
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:11,814
No, I don't think so.

263
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:14,181
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

264
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:17,371
All right. Well,
there is something, okay?

265
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:19,807
But you have to keep it a secret.

266
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:25,446
I think I have...
superpowers.

267
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:27,445
I find that hard to believe.

268
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,090
All right, all right,
how about this?

269
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,649
Go ahead and throw
as many punches as you want.

270
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:33,083
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.

271
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:37,607
Easy money.

272
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,969
What else can you do?

273
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,202
I don't know.
I... I was bitten by a dragonfly.

274
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:45,711
Well, some dragonflies
have armored skin.

275
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:48,275
I wonder if my skin is...

276
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,168
Well, good thing that worked.

277
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,655
So you do have superpowers.

278
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,815
We could be a team!

279
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:59,183
We gonna get fame, money...

280
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:02,309
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame

281
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,443
and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?

282
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:07,574
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.

283
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:09,636
That isn't what
your parents wanted for you.

284
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:12,574
You're not my father.

285
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:14,354
But I love you like your father did.

286
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:16,209
I believe in you like your father did.

287
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:19,383
I had sex with your mother just
like your father did.

288
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:22,317
Huh. You'll never understand me.

289
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:25,725
Never.

290
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,917
That isn't what
your parents wanted for you.

291
00:22:43,636 --> 00:22:45,112
What a great performance.

292
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:46,843
Well, Rick,
did you enjoy the opera?

293
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,938
Son, is something troubling you?

294
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:52,982
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.

295
00:22:53,212 --> 00:22:55,350
I want to change things.

296
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:57,784
And you will.

297
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:00,256
One day, Rick, people will look
to you to be a hero.

298
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,958
When that day comes,
will you be ready?

299
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,713
Give me your wallet.

300
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,683
That too.

301
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,510
Blaine's voice:
People will look to you to be a hero.

302
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,469
When that day comes,
will you be ready?

303
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:18,991
Rick!

304
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,626
Rick, please!

305
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:46,929
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.

306
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:48,672
- No!
- Don't worry.

307
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,271
My brother Albert will take you in.

308
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:53,777
Rick, the money,
it's all yours now.

309
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:57,114
Sell all shares of a small company
called Google.

310
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,213
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.

311
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:04,301
Rick, I have something for you.

312
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,391
Reach into my coat pocket.

313
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:10,617
The other coat pocket.

314
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,245
God!

315
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:15,897
That ring was my father's

316
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:18,132
and his father's before him.

317
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,626
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.

318
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:22,584
Claim your...

319
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:27,878
destiny.

320
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:29,408
Dad!

321
00:24:33,928 --> 00:24:35,761
I'm no superhero.

322
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:38,416
I'm nobody!

323
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:59,047
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?

324
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:02,329
You're nothing but an ugly,
ungrateful little whore!

325
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:04,543
Just like your mother!

326
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,579
- Who was that?
- My mother.

327
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,713
Listen, about what happened
at school this morning, I...

328
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,942
You really freaked us out.

329
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:12,916
I'm really going through
a tough time right now.

330
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,172
Me too. My parents,
they want me to go to college,

331
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:18,831
but I want to be a dancer.

332
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,403
I believe in you.

333
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:23,069
You really do, don't you?

334
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,642
I wish I could say the same for Lance.

335
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:27,386
I don't know.
Is he the right one

336
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:30,046
or am I just dating him
to rebel against my father?

337
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,389
He doesn't want any boy near me.

338
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:34,305
That's why he installed
the electrified fence.

339
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:36,923
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.

340
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:38,918
- Right?
- Right.

341
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:43,928
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.

342
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:47,807
Maybe one day you could take me
for a ride in your car.

343
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:50,878
Uh...

344
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,267
Uh, yeah.

345
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:57,283
Yeah, definitely.

346
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:05,741
Oh. Lovebirds.

347
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:33,377
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.

348
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:37,099
Your powers are growing,
but you can't control it.

349
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:39,800
It's important that you...

350
00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:43,555
become a hero...
train yourself to fly...

351
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:47,341
...in your ass because...

352
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,927
...squatting on a glass table...

353
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:53,451
...two girls...
one cup...

354
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:55,886
You know what to do.

355
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:09,266
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.

356
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:12,762
I've reviewed your request
for a loan, Mr. Riker,

357
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,153
but with no job,
no credit history,

358
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:17,291
I'm afraid I have to say no.

359
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:18,742
But what about this?

360
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,842
That was last month.

361
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:24,826
This new promotion's
proving quite popular.

362
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,683
Look, I need to buy a car.

363
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:29,654
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst
applicant we've ever had.

364
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:32,392
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.

365
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:37,777
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.

366
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,310
Ma'am...

367
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:42,363
rubbing my crotch under the desk
won't change my mind.

368
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:44,234
I'm not rubbing your crotch.

369
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,382
I really need that car.

370
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,206
I don't see how that's my problem.

371
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:51,870
This is a robbery! Nobody move!

372
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:53,962
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!

373
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:55,305
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady! Hurry it up!

374
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:58,105
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!

375
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:03,740
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake
before when I came in.

376
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,198
Thanks.

377
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,724
You idiot! You let him get away
with our money!

378
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:12,630
I don't see how that's my problem.

379
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,085
Let me through.
Let me through.

380
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,615
Oh, thank God. I thought something
terrible had happened.

381
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:34,281
Well, an old guy did
get shot over there.

382
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:41,225
Uncle Albert! Just try to breathe.

383
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:44,779
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.

384
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,279
Oh, sorry.

385
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,615
Rick, listen.

386
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:52,002
With great power comes...

387
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:53,410
Great responsibility?

388
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:55,455
I was gonna stick with bitches,

389
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,364
but if you want to be a virgin
for the rest of your life...

390
00:28:57,364 --> 00:28:58,929
Uncle Albert!

391
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,042
My balls!

392
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:20,806
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!

393
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:34,397
Oh no.

394
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:37,603
Okay.

395
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:40,099
Hide the body. Yeah.

396
00:29:45,938 --> 00:29:48,702
Get in!
Yah! Yah!

397
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,426
Okay, I come back.

398
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:14,084
Jill?

399
00:30:14,827 --> 00:30:16,427
I came as soon as I heard.

400
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:19,518
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.

401
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:21,503
There was nothing you could've done.

402
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:23,270
I could've stopped that guy
before he shot my uncle.

403
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,610
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?

404
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:27,500
Dr. Whitby.
What brought you here today?

405
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,000
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?

406
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,850
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.

407
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:34,709
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to perform a breast exam.

408
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:37,610
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?

409
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:40,886
Well, I'm not a betting man,
but if you want to put some money on it,

410
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:43,080
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!

411
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,689
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction,

412
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:46,756
but this should take
the edge off of it.

413
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:49,613
Here we go.
Nice and easy.

414
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,553
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.

415
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:55,431
First my parents and now this?

416
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:57,965
I'm nothing but a screw-up.

417
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:00,480
Yes, your life has been
a testament to that.

418
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:03,255
But your uncle believed
in you and so do I.

419
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,588
It's never too late to become the person
you're meant to be.

420
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:13,934
Rick.

421
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:17,555
Rick.

422
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,226
Hello, Rick.

423
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:24,767
Who are you and how
do you know my name?

424
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,086
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.

425
00:31:27,198 --> 00:31:30,969
Think of any number
between one and a million

426
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:32,819
and I'll tell you what it is.

427
00:31:33,873 --> 00:31:35,741
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!

428
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:38,350
Follow me...

429
00:31:39,707 --> 00:31:41,642
My name is Professor Xavier,

430
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:43,751
and this is my school.

431
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,619
I started it to help people

432
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,044
with special talents like yours.

433
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:51,123
Our students here learn to harness
their incredible talents.

434
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:54,082
and use them to advance
the common good.

435
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,749
Here we have children
who can walk through walls.

436
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:04,282
We have children who think they can
walk through walls.

437
00:32:04,283 --> 00:32:07,431
Some faces may be familiar,

438
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:10,095
like Wolverine.

439
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,561
Other mutants you probably
didn't know existed,

440
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,034
like Sneezo.

441
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:17,834
Most of our students
are born with their powers.

442
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:21,002
Some, like you,
gain them later in life.

443
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:23,466
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.

444
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:25,474
When he came to this school,

445
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:27,179
he weighed 130 Ibs.

446
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,466
Take enough roids,
you could do anything.

447
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:32,900
Back up off those pills, Barry!

448
00:32:38,098 --> 00:32:41,197
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential

449
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:43,884
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.

450
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,894
Once you understand
the true nature of heroism,

451
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:48,506
you will fly.
But first I must teach you

452
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,582
the secret to becoming a superhero.

453
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,553
Hey, Storm! You look
like you putting on a little weight.

454
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:00,145
So, Professor,
about this secret...

455
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,620
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!

456
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,919
- Aw, shit.
- Well?

457
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,030
You wanna explain
why I found her hiding in your closet?

458
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:08,634
But, pumpkin,
I don't see nobody.

459
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:10,903
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!

460
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:12,598
Invisible Girl?

461
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:14,965
Apparently not invisible enough.

462
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,306
If you knew how to
take care of your man,

463
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:17,427
maybe this wouldn't have happened.

464
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:19,454
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.

465
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,390
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.

466
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:22,787
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?

467
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:24,964
I'm everywhere,
sweet cheeks.

468
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,891
- That all you got?
- Yeah!

469
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,777
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?

470
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:34,998
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.

471
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:38,404
How could you do this
to me? To your kids?

472
00:33:38,404 --> 00:33:40,640
To your newborn baby?

473
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,401
How do I know that baby's even mine?

474
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:44,845
Because he can do this.

475
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:46,233
Shit!

476
00:33:48,246 --> 00:33:49,849
Aw, man.

477
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,686
Now I'm never gonna know the secret
to becoming a superhero.

478
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:55,645
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.

479
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:00,431
Make a costume,
shithead!

480
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:03,809
I swear to God. They get dumber
and dumber every year.

481
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,945
A costume.

482
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:41,850
Rick, you, uh...

483
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:44,369
Oh my God.

484
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:46,805
Damn!

485
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:49,380
Dude, you're like
a real superhero, man!

486
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:51,407
I love the mask.

487
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:52,571
How you breathe in it though?

488
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:56,546
What's that sound?

489
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:59,163
You put some kind
of air intake in the mask.

490
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,966
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming

491
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,400
that the material is
see-through, right?

492
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:05,499
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.

493
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:08,763
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.

494
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,148
Hey, that's my spot.

495
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:23,211
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.

496
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,506
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?

497
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,000
I'm looking seriously out over the city

498
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,547
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,

499
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:30,643
I guess we're gonna have to share.

500
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:31,750
Uh, okay, fine.

501
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,935
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.

502
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:40,061
- What's your name?
- John Storm.

503
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,586
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?

504
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:45,042
What's my power?
Stand back.

505
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:50,049
- Flame on!
- Whoa!

506
00:35:51,243 --> 00:35:53,348
Huh?

507
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:56,100
I'm on fire!

508
00:35:56,108 --> 00:35:58,344
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!

509
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:01,687
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!

510
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:02,999
Ah! No! Ah!

511
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:05,314
God! You idiot, stop!

512
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:07,373
What's wrong with you?

513
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:19,663
Sorry, my bad.

514
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:28,944
Rick, once you understand
the true nature of heroism,

515
00:36:29,057 --> 00:36:30,994
you will fly.

516
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:36,845
Shit.

517
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:58,230
This Dragonfly,
he's not even a hero.

518
00:36:58,178 --> 00:37:01,274
He's not... I have... I have...
I have just a... I have...

519
00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:05,465
He can't...
he can't even fly.

520
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:09,029
The Dragonfly can't even fly!

521
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,885
I can fly, okay?

522
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,669
I can fly.

523
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:19,342
This just in:

524
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,015
Tom Cruise is dead.

525
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:24,100
Strom, do you have my test results?

526
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:27,507
I'm afraid you have to kill each day

527
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:29,408
to live each day.

528
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,056
unless you had some cerillium.

529
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,531
Take a look.

530
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:36,042
Hawking's lab is
in the physics building.

531
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:37,402
I could just walk right in.

532
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:39,016
You're going to steal cerillium?

533
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,586
No, not me.

534
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,000
But perhaps there's someone inside me.

535
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,006
Someone who will,
at any cost, survive!

536
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:51,583
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!

537
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:54,702
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.

538
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:58,342
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.

539
00:37:58,522 --> 00:38:00,428
Push your lids with your fingers.

540
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:02,374
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?

541
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,617
That's it. And roll
your eyeball around.

542
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:06,861
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!

543
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,278
Dig it out with another piece of glass.

544
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,117
Are you fricking insane?

545
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:13,291
I'll get the tweezers.

546
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,807
Read about the Dragonfly,
world's greatest hero.

547
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:17,509
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.

548
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,095
Read all about it.

549
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:32,548
No, you listen to me!

550
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:35,152
I want that story
on my desk or you're fired!

551
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,281
Who the hell are you?

552
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,349
I was wondering if you've
got a job opening for...

553
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:41,699
Job?! How dare you come in here
and ask me for a job?

554
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:44,611
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!

555
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,762
Hamburgers can see the future!

556
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:48,269
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.

557
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,199
We share the building
with a mental hospital.

558
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:53,082
Bad news, boss. We're nowhere on
those Dragonfly photos.

559
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:55,303
Damn. Those were tomorrow's lead.

560
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:57,437
What about these?

561
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:04,806
Wow! it's almost like
you're the Dragonfly.

562
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:06,453
Uh, no no no.
See?

563
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:08,880
Look.

564
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,748
Now that's photography.

565
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,428
Just heard on the scanner, some kind
of police standoff at Empire University.

566
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:16,327
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...

567
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:18,248
Where'd he go?

568
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:26,270
Come on, let's go!

569
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:34,648
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.

570
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:36,336
Come out with your hands up.

571
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,028
What the hell is that?

572
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,493
I am the Hourglass.

573
00:39:57,643 --> 00:40:00,638
And your time is up.

574
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,015
It's useless to resist.

575
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:20,686
I'll fight you to my last breath.

576
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:24,290
Like the sands of time
I am unceasing and relentless.

577
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:26,034
Evil never triumphs,
Hourglass.

578
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:28,725
You'll pay for your crimes
and justice will be...

579
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:30,801
stop!
Stop!

580
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:32,743
Stop!

581
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,259
Are you okay?

582
00:40:35,313 --> 00:40:38,409
No.

583
00:40:41,928 --> 00:40:43,630
Titanium blades.

584
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,062
They cut through diamonds.

585
00:40:45,103 --> 00:40:47,564
I'm not wearing any diamonds.

586
00:40:55,524 --> 00:40:58,326
I wish I could stay longer,
Dragonfly.

587
00:40:58,397 --> 00:41:01,700
But I just don't have the time.

588
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:10,558
Titanium blades. Looks like someone
found your weakness.

589
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:12,072
It's not my weakness.

590
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:15,240
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.

591
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,543
Maybe if you had a partner.

592
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,813
I don't need help.

593
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:25,102
I'm fine all by myself.

594
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,970
She means a lot to you,
doesn't she?

595
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:29,172
What?
Oh, no.

596
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,724
I mean, she's with someone else.

597
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:33,416
Well, maybe that's for the best.

598
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:35,141
After all,
it could be dangerous,

599
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:37,468
you know, being the girlfriend
of the Dragonfly.

600
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:39,405
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.

601
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:41,316
- I love her.
- So be it.

602
00:41:41,316 --> 00:41:43,136
But remember,
to get to you

603
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:46,539
your enemies will attack
the people you care for the most.

604
00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:50,382
Be careful not to hurt
the ones you love.

605
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:56,582
Whoever this Dragonfly is,
he's in over his head.

606
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:58,583
We don't need so-called superheroes.

607
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:00,701
What Empire City needs is more cops.

608
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:02,573
And a Hooters.

609
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:13,323
Jill!

610
00:42:13,386 --> 00:42:14,711
Rick?

611
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,725
I heard you were auditioning
for a part so...

612
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,536
Oh, they're beautiful.

613
00:42:18,593 --> 00:42:20,724
God, you are so supportive.

614
00:42:20,731 --> 00:42:23,669
Why can't Lance be more like you?

615
00:42:26,218 --> 00:42:28,780
There's something you're not
telling me, isn't there?

616
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,118
Something secret.

617
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:32,864
Something locked away deep inside.

618
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:36,628
Well, there is...

619
00:42:37,826 --> 00:42:40,590
Lucille's voice:
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.

620
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:45,286
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!

621
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,659
Once a month
you'll bleed from you vagina.

622
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:52,718
I...

623
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,346
nothing.

624
00:42:56,646 --> 00:42:59,547
Nothing?

625
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:04,178
Well, I should go.

626
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,510
You're a good friend.

627
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:13,637
Hey, check this out.

628
00:43:13,955 --> 00:43:15,790
Oh, shit.

629
00:43:17,088 --> 00:43:19,681
- Let's go.
- Get her.

630
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:01,726
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.

631
00:44:02,692 --> 00:44:05,255
Please stop!
I'm begging you!

632
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:21,801
Wait!

633
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:24,799
- Where are you?
- Behind you.

634
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:29,032
You saved my life.

635
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:32,270
Do I get to thank you?

636
00:45:13,074 --> 00:45:14,888
Go.
Be a hero.

637
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:44,009
It looks like you're planning
a mass murder.

638
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,005
Would you like help?

639
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:07,224
I'm so happy that you
and your boyfriend

640
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:09,201
are spending Thanksgiving with us.

641
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:11,081
Of course, Lucille.

642
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,925
You need support at a time like this.

643
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:16,301
Yes, I miss seeing
my Albert each morning.

644
00:46:16,337 --> 00:46:18,600
You know, 50 years of marriage

645
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,469
creates quite a bond.

646
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:22,211
I wish I knew love like that.

647
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:23,895
Oh, you will, dear.

648
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:26,519
You just have to follow your heart.

649
00:46:26,523 --> 00:46:29,127
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.

650
00:46:29,197 --> 00:46:30,831
Oh, Jill.

651
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:34,220
If you can't trust yourself
who can you trust?

652
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:35,925
I know.

653
00:46:35,944 --> 00:46:37,877
But what if my heart
is telling me to be with someone

654
00:46:37,883 --> 00:46:39,188
I can't be with?

655
00:46:39,223 --> 00:46:40,924
It's not just any guy.
It's the...

656
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:43,167
forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.

657
00:46:43,169 --> 00:46:44,668
No, of course not.

658
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:46,600
You can tell me anything.

659
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:48,606
I'm very good at keeping secrets.

660
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:51,045
You'll think it's ridiculous, but...

661
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:52,850
it's the Drag...

662
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,959
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.

663
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:59,681
Hey, babe.

664
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,834
Oh, I forgot to tell you
I kinda invited my uncle.

665
00:47:02,848 --> 00:47:05,052
- Your uncle?
- What? Set another plate.

666
00:47:05,563 --> 00:47:07,000
Well, okay.
I guess.

667
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:10,522
Miss Johnson. Please,
excuse my nephew's poor manners.

668
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:13,508
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.

669
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:15,504
I hope this isn't
too much of an imposition.

670
00:47:15,555 --> 00:47:18,362
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.

671
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:19,625
Thank you.

672
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:21,727
It's just Thanksgiving is for family.

673
00:47:21,776 --> 00:47:23,648
Lance is the only family I have.

674
00:47:23,701 --> 00:47:25,570
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?

675
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:27,891
Nope, just never met the right woman.

676
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:32,149
Ah, yes, Lance told me
Rick Riker was your neighbor.

677
00:47:32,158 --> 00:47:33,821
Where is Rick?

678
00:47:37,485 --> 00:47:39,417
That's odd.

679
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:41,801
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.

680
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:43,794
Please, you're busy. Allow me.

681
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:46,328
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.

682
00:48:02,185 --> 00:48:04,016
Rick?

683
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:43,305
Sorry I'm late.

684
00:49:43,306 --> 00:49:45,677
Oh, Mr. Landers.

685
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:47,502
Rick.

686
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:49,175
No, you're just on time.

687
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:51,195
Everybody,
take your seat.

688
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:55,891
Not till we say grace.

689
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:57,339
Jesus!

690
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:58,795
Amen.

691
00:49:59,555 --> 00:50:01,153
Please start, everyone.

692
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:03,190
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.

693
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:06,202
We have Rick to thank for it.

694
00:50:06,414 --> 00:50:08,946
Ever since Albert...

695
00:50:09,147 --> 00:50:12,252
Rick has been supporting me
with his new job.

696
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:14,678
New job?
You didn't tell me.

697
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:18,828
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's
unofficial photographer.

698
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:23,366
What happened to your arm?

699
00:50:24,754 --> 00:50:26,422
Uh...

700
00:50:26,515 --> 00:50:28,974
a bike messenger knocked me down.

701
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:32,403
I see your wrist is bandaged.

702
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:35,213
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.

703
00:50:35,214 --> 00:50:37,016
And you have a cut on your lip.

704
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:38,912
Uh...

705
00:50:38,921 --> 00:50:41,584
my crackpipe broke.

706
00:50:42,785 --> 00:50:45,053
You have a scratch on your neck.

707
00:50:45,089 --> 00:50:47,325
Yes, I...

708
00:50:47,363 --> 00:50:50,098
met a girl on Craigslist.

709
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,970
And you have a bruise on your neck.

710
00:50:51,971 --> 00:50:53,843
I...

711
00:50:53,812 --> 00:50:56,077
met a guy on Craigslist.

712
00:50:59,407 --> 00:51:01,904
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.

713
00:51:01,906 --> 00:51:04,342
- Why?
- I...

714
00:51:04,347 --> 00:51:06,310
shat my pants.

715
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:09,660
I'll drive.

716
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,122
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.

717
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:28,146
Poor thing's so tired.

718
00:51:28,163 --> 00:51:30,766
Yeah, well, you know
old folks after a big meal.

719
00:51:30,784 --> 00:51:33,656
So... you know the Dragonfly?

720
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:35,365
Uh...

721
00:51:35,411 --> 00:51:37,012
yeah, I guess.

722
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,263
You could sorta say we're close.

723
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:42,593
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?

724
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:44,525
Um, yeah.

725
00:51:44,564 --> 00:51:47,004
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?

726
00:51:48,387 --> 00:51:50,220
Well, I said...

727
00:51:50,261 --> 00:51:51,321
I told him...

728
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:55,168
I told him, "The thing about Jill is...

729
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:58,605
when you look in her eyes
and she looks back in yours...

730
00:52:01,675 --> 00:52:03,330
you know that you'd do anything

731
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,802
anything to be a better person
than you are.

732
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,403
So that...

733
00:52:09,136 --> 00:52:12,134
if you were ever
lucky enough to be with her,

734
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:15,824
you could earn every second
of her perfect...

735
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:24,433
grace,
and her limitless beauty...

736
00:52:28,923 --> 00:52:30,914
and her unending love.

737
00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:34,618
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

738
00:52:35,163 --> 00:52:37,035
My eyes are burning.

739
00:52:38,204 --> 00:52:39,703
Rick, I want you to know

740
00:52:39,716 --> 00:52:41,348
that was the most beautiful thing

741
00:52:41,423 --> 00:52:43,226
anyone's ever said to me.

742
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:51,673
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.

743
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:56,509
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...

744
00:52:58,015 --> 00:53:00,347
I know exactly what I want.

745
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:21,166
Sorry to drop in uninvited.

746
00:53:21,176 --> 00:53:24,276
It's okay. We were hoping someone
would open a window.

747
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:26,681
It was getting stuffy in here.

748
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:30,153
So this is the lair of the Dragonfly.

749
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:32,994
- How did you...
- No no no,

750
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:35,019
I'm not here to fight you. I've got...

751
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:37,235
thousands of other
people I plan to kill.

752
00:53:37,262 --> 00:53:40,330
This little visit is just to show you

753
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,873
who'll get hurt if you get in my way.

754
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:45,818
Never!

755
00:53:56,356 --> 00:53:59,655
Time to go.

756
00:54:04,802 --> 00:54:07,226
The woman, Lucille Adams
of East Empire City,

757
00:54:07,233 --> 00:54:09,533
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?

758
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,314
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?

759
00:54:11,317 --> 00:54:13,242
All I can tell you is this:

760
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:15,449
he didn't save anyone tonight.

761
00:54:15,874 --> 00:54:18,215
Doctor, how is she?

762
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,561
I'm afraid your aunt's
taken a turn for the worse.

763
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:23,502
She can't speak, she can't walk,
she had no control over her bowels.

764
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:24,850
That's... that's awful.

765
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:27,213
I know. I went ahead and set up
a MySpace page for her

766
00:54:27,287 --> 00:54:29,760
under "crazy shit machine."

767
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:31,330
She already has 40 friends.

768
00:54:31,347 --> 00:54:33,568
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.

769
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:35,751
Your aunt has no problem
with her bowels...

770
00:54:35,756 --> 00:54:37,626
- Oh, thank God.
- ...because she's dead.

771
00:54:37,629 --> 00:54:40,671
I'm truly sorry, Rick,
but there is a silver lining.

772
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:42,924
Your uncle came out
of his coma this morning.

773
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:44,090
He did?

774
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:47,011
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about
your aunt just yet.

775
00:54:47,011 --> 00:54:49,869
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news

776
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,403
could send him spiraling
right back into a coma.

777
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:54,170
I understand.

778
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:58,734
Mr. Adams,
you have a visitor.

779
00:54:58,734 --> 00:55:01,706
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.

780
00:55:01,706 --> 00:55:03,443
It's your nephew Rick.

781
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,602
Remember, no bad news.

782
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,396
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.

783
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:11,784
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you

784
00:55:11,784 --> 00:55:13,590
with one of our sex-change patients,

785
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:15,846
but don't worry,
we didn't remove your penis.

786
00:55:15,851 --> 00:55:17,640
We did cut your
testicles off, but, well,

787
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:18,644
since your wife's dead,

788
00:55:18,699 --> 00:55:20,230
you won't be needing them anyway.

789
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:22,001
You just want to keep his spirits up.

790
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:24,122
He'll land on his feet in no time.

791
00:55:25,943 --> 00:55:28,976
We are gathered today to say goodbye

792
00:55:28,988 --> 00:55:31,723
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!

793
00:55:31,725 --> 00:55:34,326
And now the eulogy.

794
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:36,531
It's tragic to think
this is the last time

795
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,837
that I can look upon my wife's face.

796
00:55:38,892 --> 00:55:41,019
God, Lucille!

797
00:55:41,027 --> 00:55:45,265
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!

798
00:55:46,683 --> 00:55:48,785
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!

799
00:55:48,793 --> 00:55:50,496
I'm sorry, there's been
a terrible mistake.

800
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:53,055
This is your wife.

801
00:55:53,102 --> 00:55:55,230
She is this man's wife.

802
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,648
Give me five minutes.

803
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:05,540
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.

804
00:56:10,384 --> 00:56:12,584
You're one lucky guy.
Now...

805
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,151
where's Lucille?

806
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:17,341
Ah, Lucille!

807
00:56:23,195 --> 00:56:26,130
I do have this coupon for a cremation.

808
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:32,049
Rick?

809
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,690
I am so sorry for your loss.

810
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:37,824
What is it?

811
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,666
I know I said some things,

812
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,642
but now more than ever,
I realize...

813
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,804
we can never be together.

814
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:49,515
I don't believe you.

815
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:54,408
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.

816
00:56:54,415 --> 00:56:57,784
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.

817
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:03,197
I don't love you.

818
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:07,058
You're no longer in my five.

819
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:10,452
How could you?

820
00:57:15,368 --> 00:57:17,097
# When I was young #

821
00:57:17,598 --> 00:57:20,999
# I never needed anyone #

822
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:28,126
# Makin' love was just for fun #

823
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:33,177
# Those days are gone #

824
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:45,000
# All by myself #

825
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:47,700
# Don't wanna be #

826
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,300
# All by myself #

827
00:57:52,316 --> 00:57:54,115
# Anymore #

828
00:57:54,987 --> 00:58:00,289
# All by myself #

829
00:58:01,484 --> 00:58:02,947
# Don't wanna be #

830
00:58:02,998 --> 00:58:05,672
# All by myself. #

831
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:17,285
You can't keep getting lucky, man.

832
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:19,424
You only beat me
by two strokes this time.

833
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:21,761
And the back nine is what killed.

834
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,140
Oh my God!

835
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,390
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?

836
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:28,204
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.

837
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,542
What's the point?

838
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:37,306
Look at you...
eating junk food,

839
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:40,956
wearing fake beards,

840
00:58:41,078 --> 00:58:44,148
and we found your costume
in the garbage outside.

841
00:58:44,266 --> 00:58:46,700
Yeah, well, I'm not
the Dragonfly anymore.

842
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:49,589
But you said the Hourglass
was going to kill thousands of people.

843
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:51,841
I told you I'm no hero.
All right? Aunt Lucille's dead,

844
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,729
I've rejected the only girl
I've ever loved

845
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,107
and I can't even fly.

846
00:58:57,727 --> 00:59:00,929
I wish I'd never been bitten
by that stupid dragonfly.

847
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:04,017
And maybe your father
shouldn't have given you this after all.

848
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:07,488
Look at the words
your ancestors inscribed in that ring.

849
00:59:07,496 --> 00:59:10,533
"Honor, valor, sacrifice,

850
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:12,803
duty, commitment,
bravery, justice,

851
00:59:12,876 --> 00:59:14,610
integrity, brotherhood,

852
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:17,612
self-esteem, low prices,
affordable housing,

853
00:59:17,617 --> 00:59:20,250
loose-fitting pants,
cheap internet porn."

854
00:59:21,068 --> 00:59:23,021
The rest is in Latin.

855
00:59:23,023 --> 00:59:25,209
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.

856
00:59:25,209 --> 00:59:28,745
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters

857
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,753
is that you do it
for the best of reasons.

858
00:59:31,786 --> 00:59:33,709
Helping others, Rick,

859
00:59:33,713 --> 00:59:36,051
that's what makes you a real hero.

860
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:39,378
Maybe you're right,

861
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:42,009
but even if I wanted to stop
the Hourglass,

862
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:44,119
I wouldn't know where to start.

863
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,082
I mean, where's he gonna
find thousands of people in one place?

864
00:59:47,419 --> 00:59:49,002
Look.

865
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:52,340
Reporting here live from the
Empire City convention center

866
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:54,241
where thousands of people
are in one place,

867
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:56,025
but none of them more important

868
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,119
than the attendees
of the World Humanity Awards.

869
00:59:59,602 --> 01:00:02,004
I'll drive.

870
01:00:03,748 --> 01:00:06,062
Well, that shortcut
through the playground...

871
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:07,312
sure saved us some time.

872
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:09,103
You go ahead,

873
01:00:09,195 --> 01:00:11,430
I'll find a place to park.

874
01:00:13,002 --> 01:00:15,003
Mister, please stop!

875
01:00:16,103 --> 01:00:18,490
Each year the World Humanity Awards

876
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:20,681
are held to honor
the greatest achievements

877
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:22,876
on behalf of all humanity.

878
01:00:22,878 --> 01:00:24,844
This gala event is expected to draw

879
01:00:24,848 --> 01:00:27,456
the world's most prestigious
leaders to Empire City.

880
01:00:27,459 --> 01:00:29,629
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."

881
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,670
Damn! Look,
there go Prince Charles.

882
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:34,241
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!

883
01:00:34,352 --> 01:00:36,155
Hey, I was in jail too, man.

884
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:39,927
One of the guests here
is the Hourglass.

885
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:41,768
But which one?

886
01:00:43,762 --> 01:00:45,855
Thank you so much
for inviting us, Mr. Landers.

887
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,865
Well, when you're being
honored by the world,

888
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,398
you want your family with you.

889
01:00:50,754 --> 01:00:54,190
Perhaps one day, you could
be part of our family too.

890
01:00:55,836 --> 01:00:58,336
Ladies and gentlemen,
our first award

891
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,027
is for the medical
breakthrough of the year.

892
01:01:01,027 --> 01:01:03,062
For his company's pioneering work

893
01:01:03,098 --> 01:01:05,403
in the field of feminine hygiene

894
01:01:05,419 --> 01:01:08,253
I award Lou Landers
douchebag of the year.

895
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,848
# Douchebag #

896
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:15,719
# He's the douchebag of the year #

897
01:01:15,721 --> 01:01:18,120
# Now ain't he great, folks? #

898
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:21,266
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #

899
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:29,259
# Douchebag #

900
01:01:29,278 --> 01:01:32,453
# He's Mr. Douchebag of the year #

901
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:35,000
# Look at him smile,
look at him shine #

902
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:38,595
# He's the douchebag of,
the douchebag of the year. #

903
01:01:38,686 --> 01:01:42,218
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.

904
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,676
Stop right there, Landers.

905
01:01:46,766 --> 01:01:49,137
Mr. Riker.
So...

906
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:50,903
you know.

907
01:01:51,164 --> 01:01:53,292
You're damn right I do.

908
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:56,234
Someone in this auditorium
is the Hourglass.

909
01:01:56,274 --> 01:01:59,164
I need your help
to figure out who it is.

910
01:01:59,164 --> 01:02:01,188
Now the Hourglass could be anyone...

911
01:02:01,188 --> 01:02:03,115
a guest of honor...

912
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:04,987
maybe even a stagehand.

913
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:13,788
This may be nothing,
but I did see a man

914
01:02:13,788 --> 01:02:16,252
with what looked like a canister of

915
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:17,488
cerillium.

916
01:02:17,509 --> 01:02:18,999
Who?

917
01:02:18,999 --> 01:02:20,283
This year's lifetime
achievement award...

918
01:02:20,283 --> 01:02:21,283
Him.

919
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:24,470
...goes to one of the world's
greatest souls,

920
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:27,238
His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama.

921
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:35,700
This man isn't who you think
he is, he's the Hourglass.

922
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:37,720
No no,
I'm a man of peace.

923
01:02:37,728 --> 01:02:40,266
Shut up! You're plotting
to kill all these people

924
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:41,936
and I can prove it.
Show the world

925
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:44,637
the armor you're hiding
under these robes.

926
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:47,554
You can't fool me,
Hourglass.

927
01:02:47,554 --> 01:02:50,049
You're packing 10 Ibs
of Cerillium under there.

928
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:51,078
What?

929
01:02:54,448 --> 01:02:56,177
Take him down.

930
01:03:00,003 --> 01:03:01,536
Tutu.

931
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,550
Peace!

932
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:09,302
Pea...

933
01:03:19,009 --> 01:03:21,027
Shit shit shit shit shit.

934
01:03:23,702 --> 01:03:25,031
You!

935
01:03:25,032 --> 01:03:26,729
You're the Hourglass.

936
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,744
Hourglass!

937
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:49,073
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people

938
01:03:49,084 --> 01:03:51,753
who like to dress up
as their favorite heroes and villains.

939
01:03:51,767 --> 01:03:54,363
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!

940
01:04:01,512 --> 01:04:03,836
Hourglass, you'll never
get away with this!

941
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:07,246
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.

942
01:04:08,686 --> 01:04:10,654
Run!

943
01:04:14,378 --> 01:04:16,009
Yeah.

944
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:28,516
Goodbye...

945
01:04:29,197 --> 01:04:30,221
little fly.

946
01:04:33,047 --> 01:04:35,015
Dragonfly!

947
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,738
No!

948
01:04:55,552 --> 01:04:57,047
My eye!

949
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:09,218
Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.

950
01:05:10,593 --> 01:05:12,488
I can't.

951
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:14,366
I can't fly.

952
01:05:14,366 --> 01:05:16,921
If there is one lesson
my life can teach,

953
01:05:16,921 --> 01:05:20,225
it is that the spirit
is stronger than the body.

954
01:05:20,225 --> 01:05:22,340
The hero comes from within.

955
01:05:22,348 --> 01:05:24,342
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.

956
01:05:24,343 --> 01:05:27,340
Whatever.
It's still true.

957
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:29,638
You're right.

958
01:05:36,784 --> 01:05:38,775
It's working.

959
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:42,665
Sorry.

960
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:44,129
Watch, Dragonfly,

961
01:05:44,168 --> 01:05:46,370
as your city dies.

962
01:05:57,381 --> 01:05:59,547
Where... am I?

963
01:05:59,908 --> 01:06:02,078
You're with me,

964
01:06:02,439 --> 01:06:04,842
your lover.

965
01:06:09,736 --> 01:06:11,169
Dragonfly!

966
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:14,642
No.

967
01:06:16,783 --> 01:06:20,480
- No.
- Only now do you understand.

968
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:24,368
Oh, come...

969
01:06:25,459 --> 01:06:26,892
Aha!

970
01:06:28,797 --> 01:06:30,697
I need you to yank this off.

971
01:06:32,138 --> 01:06:33,369
Yeah.

972
01:06:33,371 --> 01:06:34,806
There's not enough time.

973
01:06:36,796 --> 01:06:38,491
Oh fuck.

974
01:06:45,064 --> 01:06:48,063
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!

975
01:06:48,075 --> 01:06:50,037
Jill!

976
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,995
Gotcha.

977
01:06:55,522 --> 01:06:55,800
Rick?

978
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,600
You didn't think I'd let anything happen

979
01:06:57,687 --> 01:06:59,511
to the girl I love, did you?

980
01:06:59,511 --> 01:07:01,141
Well, we're still falling.

981
01:07:01,141 --> 01:07:04,178
Damn it!
If only I could fly.

982
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:06,133
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.

983
01:07:06,133 --> 01:07:09,069
You know, maybe I was meant
to have a normal job... an accountant,

984
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,229
a gym teacher.

985
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:13,418
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!

986
01:07:13,434 --> 01:07:15,311
I don't care what happens anymore.

987
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:17,126
If I die, I die happily in your arms.

988
01:07:17,126 --> 01:07:20,358
You're my hero, Rick Riker,
and I love you.

989
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:28,064
Yes!
Oh, thank God!

990
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,895
We only have 50 stories left.

991
01:07:29,895 --> 01:07:31,659
Hang on.

992
01:07:42,721 --> 01:07:45,220
Thank you, Dragonfly.

993
01:07:45,245 --> 01:07:47,900
Because of you, our city
is safe at last.

994
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,950
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!

995
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:53,016
It's a happy ending for us all.

996
01:07:53,017 --> 01:07:55,649
Let's go get some dinner. I'm buying.

997
01:07:56,314 --> 01:07:58,581
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.

998
01:07:58,689 --> 01:07:59,850
I'm the Dragonfly.

999
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:02,729
And as long as there's
crime and injustice

1000
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:05,777
I will forever be a superhero...

1001
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:12,183
I am the Hourglass!

1002
01:08:12,249 --> 01:08:16,152
# Darkness has found you,
evil surrounds you #

1003
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:20,430
# No one to save you,
we're almost out of time #

1004
01:08:20,461 --> 01:08:23,421
# What do you do when
nothing can be done? #

1005
01:08:24,863 --> 01:08:27,855
# Where do you go
with nowhere left to run? #

1006
01:08:29,296 --> 01:08:33,295
# Where is the one
who stands up and tells you #

1007
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:37,606
# I'm here to save you?
We're almost out of time #

1008
01:08:37,636 --> 01:08:40,664
# Nobody knows just who
he's trying to be #

1009
01:08:42,104 --> 01:08:44,937
# Behind this mask, his wings
and suit of green #

1010
01:08:46,241 --> 01:08:49,774
# Just in time to reach up
for the sky #

1011
01:08:49,817 --> 01:08:54,557
# And fly away #

1012
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:57,879
# Don't worry you're safe #

1013
01:08:59,074 --> 01:09:02,660
# In my arms,
'cause it takes your love #

1014
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,928
# To lift me up,
it's safe to say #

1015
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:09,680
# Jill and I were always meant to be #

1016
01:09:09,682 --> 01:09:14,579
# So I will show you why
I'm here to stay #

1017
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:17,074
# Don't they know that
I'll protect you? #

1018
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:19,198
# Don't they know
they'll have to get through #

1019
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,661
# Me #

1020
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:24,998
# Don't worry yourself... #

1021
01:09:31,447 --> 01:09:33,444
Hourglass: Your time is up!

1022
01:09:33,444 --> 01:09:35,807
# Watch out behind you #

1023
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:37,809
# This is designed to #

1024
01:09:37,809 --> 01:09:39,840
# Quickly remind you #

1025
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,807
# We're almost out of time #

1026
01:09:41,809 --> 01:09:44,750
# Somebody tell me what
he's trying to be #

1027
01:09:47,052 --> 01:09:50,719
# Behind his mask, his wings,
his suit of green #

1028
01:09:51,465 --> 01:09:54,367
# Just in time to reach up
for the sky #

1029
01:09:55,253 --> 01:09:58,594
# And fly away #

1030
01:09:59,394 --> 01:10:01,954
# Don't worry you're safe #

1031
01:10:03,486 --> 01:10:07,153
# In my arms,
'cause it takes your love #

1032
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:10,882
# To lift me up,
it's safe to say #

1033
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,644
# Jill and I were always meant to be #

1034
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:19,603
# So I will show you why
I'm here to stay #

1035
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,184
# Don't you worry,
I'm the one #

1036
01:10:22,255 --> 01:10:24,661
# Who let's them know
that I'll protect you #

1037
01:10:24,733 --> 01:10:28,466
# Don't they know they'll
have to get through me? #

1038
01:10:29,584 --> 01:10:32,212
# Don't worry you're safe... #

1039
01:10:33,378 --> 01:10:36,579
# In my arms so green #

1040
01:10:36,642 --> 01:10:41,280
# It's easy. #

1041
01:17:35,195 --> 01:17:38,361
#I need a hero #

1042
01:17:40,338 --> 01:17:42,966
#I need a hero #

1043
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:48,542
# I'm calling out,
I want you here #

1044
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:51,084
# This is my 911 #

1045
01:17:51,098 --> 01:17:54,425
# I'm sinking down into the fear #

1046
01:17:54,425 --> 01:17:56,424
# That I just can't outrun #

1047
01:17:56,455 --> 01:17:59,553
# To save myself all I can see #

1048
01:17:59,553 --> 01:18:02,189
# Is that I've got no choice #

1049
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,073
# I cry for help and pray you'll be #

1050
01:18:05,075 --> 01:18:07,708
# The one who hears my voice #

1051
01:18:07,843 --> 01:18:09,579
# I need a hero #

1052
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:13,159
# Someone to rescue me
when I'm in a mess #

1053
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:17,651
# Whenever I'm falling,
someone to be my safety net #

1054
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,784
# I need a hero watching over me #

1055
01:18:20,784 --> 01:18:23,537
# I need a hero in my time of need #

1056
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:25,815
