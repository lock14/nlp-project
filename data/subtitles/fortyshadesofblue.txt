they used to take me over
to their part of town

to the jukebox

341
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,200
And I can't even get my players
in the same room so I can see
their eyeballs!

<i>What is that shit
all about?</i>

343
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
(Alan)
How many times have
we been through it?

344
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,880
<i>You may think

[Muffled shouting]

347
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,640
U m, so, you're
from Russia. Where?

348
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,160
Moscow.

349
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,480
And before that, my family
is from further West.
A town called Smolensk.

350
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,680
Is that where you...
you met Dad?

351
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,680
'Cause I know
he was there.

352
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,720
Yes, Moscow.

353
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,240
He was travelling
with a group of
businessmen

354
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,560
for a conference on
the entertainment industry,
over there.

355
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,280
They had discussion groups
and presentations.

356
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,760
That was interesting.

357
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,720
Businessmen would hire me
to help them get around
in the city.

358
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,200
Because...
Because of my English,

359
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:12,000
which might not sound
so good here, but in Russia
they consider me very good.

360
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,840
And so this group engaged me to
facilitate and to make things
go smoothly for the conference.

361
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,720
<i>(waiter)
I'm sorry. Laura, did you
want to go ahead and order</i>

362
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,280

363
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,880
No...

364
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,840
I don't think so.

365
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,440
U h, I guess
we'll wait.

366
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,240

367
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,160

Yes, please.

And Alan says
that you are a writer.

371
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,240
Is that what
you are doing?

372
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,560

That's my living.
My wife is off faculty, too.

373

but you were having
a little trouble walking.

685
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,740
I'm sorry.

686
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,100
I'm sorry.

687
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,380
Michael?

688
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,260
{Y:i}(Michael)
Is he okay?

689
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,820
(Laura)
Yes, he's fine.

690
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,380
{Y:i}When they sleep like that,
they don't wake up
for anything.

691
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,020
He doesn't care
where he is.

692
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,780
How are you doing?

693
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,700
I'm great.

694
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,900
You?

695
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,260
Me, too.

696
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,740
Good.

697
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,420
Can I say
what I think?
Would you mind?

698
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:46,140
I think... you are
a very intelligent person,
very bright.

699
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,660
But you are afraid.

700
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,540
And that's because...

701
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:57,020
Because you feel like
you have to be better
at love than you are.

702
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,420
And you...

703
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,980
came home
to your family...

704
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,100
to test
how good you were...

705
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:15,180
because now, maybe,
you're going to start
one of your own.

706
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,140
You are not listening.

707
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,540
No.

708
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,500

[Chuckles]

709
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,300
Listen, Michael.

710
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,860
I like you.

711
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,620
Very much.

712
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,820
I like the way it is
when we are together.

713
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,940
You know me.

714
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,540
Okay, maybe not.

715
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,500
But you don't judge me.

716
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:06,140
And that's more important
than if you know someone.

717
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,660
U nderstanding someone
is very hard, I think.

718
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,020
And I think I can
understand you
just a little.

719
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:18,020
I don't understand
why he doesn't get to you.

720
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,980
I mean, you just
let it go, and go on
and live your life.

something incredible.

724
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,180
You know?
I don't have
the right to complain.

725
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,460
I don't.

726
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,700
Maybe this is Russian,
you know?

727

To keep going.

728
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,540
I think here
it is different.

729

is so spoiled.

{Y:i}Oh, just
a little while ago.
You was in the shower.

try and make it

I've been thinking
about something...

766
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,980
Just let me speak first
before you get upset
with me, because,

767
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:15,340
for some reason,
we don't see each other
very often, and...

768
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,740
{Y:i}I have to...

769
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,460
{Y:i}take whatever
opportunities I'm given.

770
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,540
I remember back
when you were in school,

771
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,500
where you were
always so good, very...

772
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,500
You liked to make
a good grade,

773
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:39,860
you enjoyed the test,
you liked the challenge.

774
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,300
And you're always
at the top of your class.

775
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,420
Or... near the top.

776
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,500
{Y:i}Year after year,
and I remember that.

777
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,500
{Y:i}And I was so proud
of you.

778
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,500
{Y:i}I still am.

779
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,380
And I've enjoyed
having you here
in the house.

780

I wish you were here
more often.

But, you know...

782

thinking about
that school, I...

783
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,420
I think somehow
you took away from it a...

784
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,420
a wrong lesson...

785
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:27,580
{Y:i}that you could get
ahead in life by doing
what other want you to do

786

{Y:i}instead of doing
for yourself.

787

{Y:i}Because you gotta do
in this world.
