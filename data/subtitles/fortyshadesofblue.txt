It's All Over]
# Outside her window #
# That's where I am
every night and every day #
# And outside her window #
# I cry my life away #
# There's a jukebox playing #
# Just a half a block down #
# Saying,
"I'm going to the river" #
# "Gonna jump right in
and drown #
# But I ain't gonna
do that, girl, no, no #
# I'll just keep on
hanging around #
# Even though
it's all over #
# Can't you hear me?
All over #
# Don't you leave me,
It's all over #
# Oh, now, now, now, now, now,
now, now, now, now, now, now #
# Outside her window #
# A pretty bird
comes to play ##
[song continues over radio]
[Song continues over radio]
I wanna thank...
[mumbles]
- People.
Oh, gee.
[Chuckles]
(boy)
Daddy I
[giggles]
Come here, tiger.
There we go.
[Giggles]
Aarrgh!
[Song continues
over the radio]
(father)
Are you gonna be good?
(boy)
Yes.
[Giggles]
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I didn't hear you.
I know.
Is something wrong?
No. You just look
so pretty.
Did you do
your makeup?
Yes.
It's very easy.
I can show you some time,
if you like.
[Boy imitates car]
Well! Glad you
could join us,
little bunny.
You see how pretty
your mommy looks?
(speaks Russian)
Ooh!
(speaks Russian)
(speaks Russian)
[Boy imitates car]
"...which I don't deserve."
Let's get this show
on the road!
(woman)
It's nice of Michael
to come all this way.
Alan, how long
has it been?
(Alan)
Some time.
Four, five years.
(woman)
Oh, it's been more
than that, don't you think?
Could be.
Why don't you
ask him?
Laura, have you
met Michael?
No.
You met his wife.
What do you think of her?
(Alan)
Oh, she's very nice,
I guess.
She's very
intelligent.
I wouldn't think
he'd pick a stupid
woman for himself.
It just wouldn't
make any sense.
See what I gave
Laura?
Oh, Alan!
[Chuckles]
Whoo!
I was thinking, would
it be nice to bring them
to the lake house?
That's a good idea.
Yeah! It's been a while
since we've done that.
Let's have a party.
[Chuckles]
(woman)
What happened?
They missed the flight!
They take a later one,
they can take a cab.
What?
Are you sure?
Can I have your phone,
please?
Come on, Betty I
(Betty)
Okay, okay!
[Indistinct]
I still think
it's rude not to call,
don't you, Laura?
I don't know.
(Alan)
Hey, Duigan?
[Car horn]
Jeez.
We're on the way.
Got held up
at the airport.
Well, I gotta start
[inaudible].

A Little Bit of Soap]
# A little bit of soap
will wash away #
# The lipstick from my face #
# A little bit of soap
will never #
# Never, never, ever erase #
# The pain in my heart
and my eyes #
# As I go through
the Ionely years #
# A little bit of soap
will never wash #
# Away my tears #
# Have you heard
when love begins to die #
# It leaves someone to cry #
# Night and day #
# Like a bird,
you left your robin's nest #
# And just like all the rest
you flew away #
# A little bit of soap
will never #
# Wash away the memory #
# Of your name
in the night #
# That I call through
the Ionely years #
# A little bit of soap
will never wash #
# A way my tears ##
[cheering, clapping]
(Announcer)
Miss Eva Keeler.
She's from
the Ridgeway School.
Isn't that beautiful to hear?
The young people
with their talent.
Okay, where are we now?
Show your love!
[Ioud clapping]
Yeah.
Let's continue, tonight,
to pay tribute to this giant
that walks among us.
Mr. Alan James!
[ovation]
He can writer,
he can producer,
he can play I
Here is another for you.
I know you know this one.
[Dark End of the Street
starts playing]
# At the dark end
of the street #
[applause]
# That's where
we always meet #
# Hiding in shadows
where we don't belong #
# Living in darkness,
to hide alone #
# You and me #
# At the dark end
of the street #
# You and me ##
First of all,
l... I just want to say
I don't deserve this award
but I sure as hell
ain't gonna give it back.
[Laughter]
I wrote some stuff down here
last night telling everybody
how great they are and
thanking 'bout everybody
in the business,
but seeing, uh, how you
appreciated Jerry over here,
I figured I just didn't know
if y'all deserve it, anyway!
[Laughter]
So to hell with that.
But outside I just made
a few notes, so I'll see
if I can read them.
And, uh...
I hear my mom, Thelma,
saying, "Be nice."
[Chuckles]
I just want to say that
music is still the...
only valid thing to come out
of this whole mess we call
an industry.
It's just a moment in time
that happened in Memphis
that was pure magic.
It's when the music
of the blacks and the whites
came together.
Let me tell you
a little about myself.
You know, my aunt and
uncle had a dance hall
on the edge of town
called The Cotton Ball,
I used to wash dished there.
And I listened to
the white stream bands.
And I... bagged groceries
at Piggly Wiggly
and did yard work,
and some black friends of mine
they used to take me over
to their part of town
and I would listen
to the jukebox
and I heard...
a music that... it still
haunts me, always will.
When my dad came back
from World War I I,
he said, " I've always...
"...lectured you about
your picking the guitar
and playing the piano,
"do something real...
maybe you're on
the right track,
"because I want
to tell you, son,
"that black music...
what we called "race music",
it's not mainstream,
"and hillbilly music...
white folks...
"that is the music
that Europe is going
crazy over.
"I'm talking about
England, France, Germany,
the whole shebang.
"And they say,
' Don't you know
what you got?
"This is American music...
it's the thing,
it's the real deal. "'
I'm just so thankful...
that I was part of it.
And I can't tell you
how much
I love all of you.
Thank you, thank you.
Can't talk anymore.
Okay.
[Ioud applause]
Come on,
let's boogie!
[Laughter]
(Alan)
But you're next.
(man)
Not me. They don't
care about me.
You gotta be
kidding me.
We're gonna stay on air
and I'm gonna remember
everything you said here.
You remember
whatever you'd
like to remember.
I'll remind you of it.
It could be very familiar.
Okay,
let's get together.
We gotta run,
anyway.
Thank you.
(Alan)
Where are we going now?
(man #2)
I don't know.
We need to go to the media.
(Alan)
All right.
[Singing, indistinct]
[Laughter]
[Blues music playing]
(male voice)
Hey, there he is!
There he is!
Who invited you?
Don't come...
don't come in here!
Trying to get
at all my litter?
Get him out!
[Laughter]
Get him out!
(Alan))
I can hear you
all the way down to the bar!
Oh, get up.
My man.
Get the fuck up.
Hey!
Aren't you sweet.
(man)
A triple gin for me.
[Laughter]
What are you
thinking about?
Nothing.
Do I look like
I'm thinking
about something?
Is it coming off?
Ohh! Oh, oh, oh!
Perfect.
We're off
to bed...
[giggles]
What do you say?
I think you need
to light it again.
I've never done this.
Never?
No, I've never done that.
Give me some.
[She giggles]
[Chatter]
(woman)
Let her alone,
Tom. Come on I
Get in the car!
Get in the car.
Can we give you
a ride somewhere?
Excuse me.
You okay?
Hey. Hey,
wait a minute.
Hey, I'm harmless,
lady. I got some
friends over here,
we're just gonna go across
town, and we'll take you
anywhere you wanna go.
Do you wanna
go with us?
Ah? You sure?
Come with us.
Are you waiting
on somebody?
(Tom)
Very good security.
Anybody can just
walk right in.
Cindy?
Get out...
of my way.
Cindy?
I don't think
she's here, babe.
[Liquid pouring]
Ahh...
(Tom)
Is everything okay?
Will you get out
of here?
Well, what am I
gonna do with this?
I don't care.
The case is gone.
What? Okay,
wait a minute!
All right, you're
making your point.
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.
But, you know,
I mean...
for God's sake...
You're pushing people
around, here,
that are being
nice to you.
What...
What was that for,
huh? What's that?
You know you're
a witch!
[Thuds, crashes]
I'm sorry...
[chuckling]
I spilled
some on you.
All right,
okay.
[Door opens]
[Door slams shut]
[Iocks door]
Boo!
Aah!
(maid)
There's pictures.
Where?
There.
Hey, thank you.
[Chuckles]
(Michael)
Can I get a look?
(Alan)
There you go.
Hey! Very nice, Dad.
A w, you didn't
miss anything.
You would've got
a chance to see me
make an ass of myself
in front of a few
hundred people,
that's all.
(Alan)
Look who's here!
I'm Michael.
Yes, I know.
I'm Laura.
Sit, please sit.
Sit.
I'm glad
we finally meet.
Ah, same here.
(Alan)
How you doing?
Fine.
I have to take Sam
to school now.
Is April sleeping?
No, she got held up
with some things
she was doing.
She had to finish some work,
but she's gonna get here
later, right, Michael?
I don't know,
it doesn't matter.
Well, I'm curious.
Well, nice meeting you.
I left some towels for you
on the chair next to your bed.
I found them,
thank you.
Okay, good.
Bye.
(Alan)
Baby?
Why don't you
join us for lunch?
U m, I'll see.
I'm not sure.
Okay.
But try, will you?
I will.
She's a nice lady.
Why don't you get
to know her a little?
She writes lyrics,
you know?
Quite good.
[Scoffs]
What am I
asking you here?
I don't know,
it's you mess, Dad.
Why don't you clean it up?
Stop hogging the paper.
Give me the Sports page,
will you?
(teacher)
We begin laying the rocks
to hold everything in place
to keep it from cracking.
The hole isn't big enough,
we're not going to have
room enough for everything
we have to put in it.
So, we really have to
make sure that everything
is really smooth.
[Whispers]
U h, this way, all the debris
will be carefully removed,
and nothing will be bumpy
or out of place.
Sometimes it can take
several days or weeks
to build a nice foundation
for an excavation site.
She's terrific,
isn't she?
Yes, that's interesting.
You're next.
I'm just teasing,
you know.
I don't mean to harass you,
it's just that I know
the kids will be so interested
to learn about your country.
[Piano playing]
(Alan)
Know this one?
It's familiar.
[Piano and guitar playing]
(woman)
# La, la, la #
# La, la, la, la #
Is this the warm-up?
(man)
Yeah, that's the one,
right there.
Sure we got enough?
(woman)
This got involved.
Michael, you got
everything you need?
U h-huh.
Good. Like I was saying,
I think your dad's
pretty amazing, man.
I really feel privileged
just to be working here.
He's taught me...
I can't tell
what he's taught me.
So many different
levels. Philosophy,
Psychology, History.
Hey! What the hell's
going on in here!
Come on!
Goddammit!
See...
What is he...
Aah!
I want it set up
out here!
(Alan)
Jerry I
(Jerry)
What's up, man?
You see that in there?
That room is 800 square feet.
I didn't build that
for you to hide my fucking
drummer in the closet!
Sorry, Alan.
You just break it down
and get it simplified.
My money in there!
I'll do it, man.
All right, Alan.
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
A stage? I What do you want,
a bicycle? Help him do it I
Look at that I
H undred and fifty thousand
dollar construction!
And I can't even get my players
in the same room so I can see
their eyeballs!
What is that shit
all about?
(Alan)
How many times have
we been through it?
You may think
you know better...
[girls giggle]
[Muffled shouting]
U m, so, you're
from Russia. Where?
Moscow.
And before that, my family
is from further West.
A town called Smolensk.
Is that where you...
you met Dad?
'Cause I know
he was there.
Yes, Moscow.
He was travelling
with a group of
businessmen
for a conference on
the entertainment industry,
over there.
They had discussion groups
and presentations.
That was interesting.
Businessmen would hire me
to help them get around
in the city.
Because...
Because of my English,
which might not sound
so good here, but in Russia
they consider me very good.
And so this group engaged me to
facilitate and to make things
go smoothly for the conference.
(waiter)
I'm sorry. Laura, did you
want to go ahead and order
or do you want to wait
for M r. James?
No...
I don't think so.
U h, I guess
we'll wait.
Yeah.
I'll have another.
You want another
mineral water?
Yes, please.
And Alan says
that you are a writer.
Is that what
you are doing?
I'm a teacher.
That's my living.
My wife is off faculty, too.
How wonderful to be
a teacher.
I n Russia it's above
being a doctor.
It's a very great honor.
I was at the house
last night when
you came home.
U m...
I beg your pardon?
When you came in
with your escort,
or whatever he was,
the idiot.
Maybe you don't remember,
but you were having
a little trouble walking.
Let me put it
this way.
Do you remember Alan
bringing you home
last night?
No.
I do remember.
(man)
If it's Alan James, Jr!
[chuckles]
I'm Ronnie.
Welcome.
Hey, Ronnie.
Hello.
How long are you
home for, now?
I don't know,
a few days.
Why don't you stay around
a little while?
Well, I might,
I just don't know.
Excuse me, Ronnie.
May I pass?
You need anything,
honey?
No, I'm fine.
So, Alan tells me
you're making a big deal
of yourself out there in LA.
Yeah.
(Barry)
If we find the equipment
in reasonable shape,
we'll buy that, if not,
we'll lease it, but...
if everything goes right,
we'll, uh, be up and running
by the end of February.
Terrific.
I tried to get Michael
to go in on it with us,
but, uh, he didn't seem
to think it was glamorous
enough, or something.
He'll maybe help us
with the publicity.
Well, a health club
in that area,
it's full of hardworking
young people, it's a hit I
(Alan)
Won't need publicity.
(Barry)
Hope not.
Sweetie, what are you
doing there?
Come on over here.
Join us.
You know Barry.
Hey, how're
you doing?
Nice to meet you.
(Alan)
Sam asleep?
(Laura)
I hope so. I think so.
Would you like me to check?
No, no,
stay with us.
(Barry)
How old's your boy?
Three and a half.
So soon?
Yes, the 14th.
(Alan)
I know.
(Barry)
Can I get another one?
You want one?
No, I'm good.
I met her before,
you know.
She... she doesn't
remember me, but
she used to be even hotter.
I guess it's that, uh,
mother's milk thing,
you know?
[Chuckles]
Are they married?
U h, not that
I know of.
I mean, that fucking
guy's amazing.
[Chuckles]
H uh, he's got
some stain, pal.
Kinda gives us hope,
don't it?
(Alan)
How you doing?
Pretty good.
You doing alright?
Not bad.
[Chuckles]
Not bad?
Not exactly super, right?
Come on, baby.
That's right.
Beautiful, wonderful
women should always
be in a...
beautiful state.
Right?
Did you have
a nice lunch?
We waited for you.
Okay.
I got held up.
Yeah.
And what should I do
when you get held up?
What do you mean?
Where did you go?
H mm?
I'm not proud of it,
Laura.
I don't expect you
to forgive me.
I felt very ashamed.
I don't blame you.
[Laughs]
[Speaks Russian]
[Speaks Russian]
[The continue
to speak Russian]
[Laughs]
[Knocking on door]
Can I talk to you
for a minute?
My wife is pregnant.
We just found out
a few weeks ago,
so it's...
been awkward.
We really haven't been
getting along that well
lately.
Talking about
splitting up.
So it's just...
I wanted to explain
to you...
I don't know why
I took it out on you.
And I shouldn't have.
I don't even know you.
You should tell
your father.
Isn't that
why you came home?
I came home
for the party,
right?
It will make him happy.
You know it will,
why don't you?
'Course it will
make him happy.
I can see it now.
Just having another
playmate around...
It terrifies me
just thinking
about it.
Sooner or later
he's gonna find out
anyway.
No, it's not for me
to tell him.
And especially
if you don't want me to.
But eventually,
M ichael...
There is a baby.
Yeah, so they say,
eh?
Naw, I just...
I wish I could
feel good about it.
It will come
from time.
It will,
believe me.
M mm! Ha ha!
M mm! Ha ha!
(Alan)
No, she's like a bird with
his wings snipped off.
I got blood in my ears
from all that squeaking.
He ain't no better.
None of 'em.
Ah, they're terrible.
[Chuckles]
They can't find the key.
He can't stay in the key!
[Chuckles]
No, I think
that's their style.
(Michael)
Where do you think
he was going?
(Sam)
That's his snack.
Is that his snack?
(Alan)
Two, three more weeks?
Can you turn
the light on?
(Sam)
Look at you!
[Alan continues
on the phone indistinct]
Thank you.
Big Sam!
Now we can see!
Now we won't
burn our eyes, huh?
(Alan)
I don't know
if it's true.
(Michael)
The dinosaur said, "Would
you like to play with us?"
And what did he say?
"Nol I have to go home."
(Michael)
Good night.
Michael.
I didn't see you there.
I'm just having
a last cigarette.
Sleep well.
You, too.
[Hums]
[Michael chuckles]
(Laura)
It's ready!
Whoa!
This many?
Many!
Many? That many?
You'll beat the whole
cake out?
Oh!
[Laura speaks Russian]
[Sam speaks Russian]
[Chuckles]
M mm!
Today is your day
to be three and a half.
It's very old.
You're an old man.
Blow.
[Sam blows loudly]
[Blows]
[Blows]
[Laughter, clapping]
[Speaks Russian]
(Alan)
How much will you eat?
How many
pieces of cake?
(Sam)
Many. Ohh I
Haven't seen you
in a while. How are you?
(Laura)
I'm fine, hi.
Good.
Shopping for M r. James?
Yeah.
I guess so.
If there's anything you need,
just let me know.
I'm probably
just looking.
Hello.
Hi.
[Muffled music playing]
[Phone ringing]
[Knocking]
What is it?
Telephone for Michael.
Oh.
Do you want me
to take a message?
No, it's okay.
I'll see who it is.
Hello? Hi.
This is Laura.
Oh, hi.
No, I don't think so.
He went out.
Yes, I can tell him.
I'll leave him
a message.
Okay.
Bye.
(Michael)
If you're looking
for stuff about yourself,
it isn't in there, yet.
I'm sorry.
It's just that... I was
thinking how this looks, and
this looks quite beautiful.
I'm sorry.
You're not from
around here, are you?
I'm not sorry,
I'm glad to see you.
She called a moment ago.
Your students love you.
I can tell,
that's true.
What do you teach them?
English.
No, I mean...
How... how do you,
for example.
One thing I do is
I have them bring in
things they like.
U m, they bring in
articles, books,
music.
Mainly rap. And, uh,
we talk about them,
discuss them.
Write my name.
[Chuckles]
Oh, that's beautiful!
[Chuckles]
When I write in English,
it looks like a child.
Wait here.
What, for me?
M mm-hmm.
No!
Yes, don't argue.
Open it.
Please.
All right.
Ohh! Hey!
Look at that!
Do you like it?
H mm?
I do.
U h, I need that.
(maid)
Do you mind if I come in?
Minnie, what's a person
supposed to say to that?
Where did that
come from?
(Michael)
Laura just
got it for me.
(Minnie)
'Bout time you got
something you can wear.
[Michael scoffs]
You shouldn't have.
I just saw it,
and I thought of you.
Thank you.
[Strains]
Ohh!
(Michael)
Aah I
What the hell
was that?
30 - love.
30 - love!
At least I put 'em
through the net.
(woman)
Look at that I
They really are cut
from the same cloth.
Look at the way
they walk!
It's just so striking,
the resemblance,
don't you think?
I disagree.
With what?
I don't think
they look alike.
You sound as though
I'm saying it
as a bad thing.
I know you are not.
I just don't
agree with you.
Well, maybe
you don't know 'em
well enough.
I've know these guys
for 15 years.
I guess...
I don't know what to say.
I just don't agree with you.
[Alan cries out
in pain]
(Michael)
[Indistinct]
(Alan)
Get some crutches,
will you? I
Is it broken,
Dad?
What the fuck
do I know if it's broken?
I'm not a fucking doctor.
Get the fuck
away from me.
I'll put your light out.
Come on,
where's those crutches.
You just jerking me
this way and that.
Let's go.
Hi, sweetie.
Come on.
[Alan mumbles]
What do you mean
you can't get
in touch with her?
She's done 15
events for us.
Well, I didn't know
you developed that sort
of relationship with 'er.
No wonder
she won't talk to you.
Oh, yeah?
I got some advice
for you, mister,
why don't you piss
in your own boot
from now on?
[Hangs up phone]
Duigan says that...
You know what?
You and I should
plan this picnic.
When are we
gonna do it?
[Doorbell rings]
Where are you going?
Hi.
What happened?
Alan hurt himself
at the club
playing tennis.
I'm so sorry.
Is he okay?
He'll be fine.
Anyway, thanks for coming,
I know it was short notice.
I'm so thirsty.
Cindy! Cindy Rah!
Hi, Alan.
How's it going,
baby?
I'm fine.
Where's your boyfriend,
Freddie, is he
coming over?
Why?
Why?! Because
I wanna play some cards
with the sonuvabitch.
He's a funny guy,
not a sourpuss
like you are.
Whoo-ha!
Said and told.
[Coughs]
I think I'll get
to pee in my car,
in my hat.
I'm going to hell.
Alan?
I'll be back later.
Alright, babe.
Will you get
yourself into bed?
Sure.
Go ahead.
You going out?
Yeah.
Is it okay?
Absolutely.
What is it, Cindy?
I'm sorry, Laura,
but I'm not staying here
with Alan like that.
I don't wanna be harsh.
You know I like him,
but when he gets that way
it freaks me out.
Sorry.
Did he say something
to you?
No. It's just, like...
It's very uncomfortable.
I just think
I need to go home.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
(Michael)
Is he okay?
(Laura)
Yes, he's fine.
When they sleep like that,
they don't wake up
for anything.
He doesn't care
where he is.
How are you doing?
I'm great.
You?
Me, too.
Good.
Can I say
what I think?
Would you mind?
I think... you are
a very intelligent person,
very bright.
But you are afraid.
And that's because...
Because you feel like
you have to be better
at love than you are.
And you...
came home
to your family...
to test
how good you were...
because now, maybe,
you're going to start
one of your own.
You are not listening.
No.
Why not?
[Chuckles]
Listen, Michael.
I like you.
Very much.
I like the way it is
when we are together.
You know me.
Okay, maybe not.
But you don't judge me.
And that's more important
than if you know someone.
U nderstanding someone
is very hard, I think.
And I think I can
understand you
just a little.
I don't understand
why he doesn't get to you.
I mean, you just
let it go, and go on
and live your life.
Whereas I turn into
[inaudible].
I live better
than anyone
I have ever known.
This life, it's just
something incredible.
You know?
I don't have
the right to complain.
I don't.
Maybe this is Russian,
you know?
To keep going.
I think here
it is different.
Everyone
is so spoiled.
I don't know.
I have to stop.
Right now.
[Sighs]

(woman)
We're not in right now,
but if you leave a message,
(woman)
We're not in right now,
but if you leave a message,
we'll get back at you
shortly. Thanks.
[Beep]
Hey, it's me.
Are you there?
Alright, just...
wondering how you were.
You can call me
at Dad's.
I hope you're good,
sweetie. Bye.
[Knocking on door]
Come in.
Am I bothering you?
No.
I just wanted
to say goodnight.
How are you?
I'm fine, I'm good.
And you?
Pretty good,
pretty good.
Well...
that's all,
I guess.
See you tomorrow.
Good night.
April called.
I'm sorry?
Michael's wife, April.
I wrote it down.
When did she call?
Oh, just
a little while ago.
You was in the shower.
She says she's gonna
try and make it
to the party.
I'll give it
to him, then.
Whatever you like.
(Alan)
Mickey?
[Chuckling]
I've been thinking
about something...
Just let me speak first
before you get upset
with me, because,
for some reason,
we don't see each other
very often, and...
I have to...
take whatever
opportunities I'm given.
I remember back
when you were in school,
where you were
always so good, very...
You liked to make
a good grade,
you enjoyed the test,
you liked the challenge.
And you're always
at the top of your class.
Or... near the top.
Year after year,
and I remember that.
And I was so proud
of you.
I still am.
And I've enjoyed
having you here
in the house.
I wish you were here
more often.
But, you know...
thinking about
that school, I...
I think somehow
you took away from it a...
a wrong lesson...
that you could get
ahead in life by doing
what other want you to do
instead of doing
for yourself.
Because you gotta do
in this world.
You gotta make a choice...
and you gotta do.
(Alan)
Whatever it is
that makes you happy,
that makes you
fulfilled...
Take it for
what it's worth.
Whoa, look at that I
Ha, look at that I
(Laura)
Sorry I took so long.
Why, you take
as long as you like.
Lonni's at the hotel,
we'll pick her up,
she can wait.
Come on, Michael.
Let's see if we can find
the old members.
Hi, Cindy.
(Cindy)
Hi, Alan.
(Alan)
How's my buddy, Freddy?
(Cindy)
Fine.
(Alan)
Have a good time.
(Alan)
That's where the old
studio used to be.
Sixteen, seventeen years,
that was soul central.
Right over there
was the parking lot,
that's still there.
All the rest
of this is new.
What's the matter
with America?
I mean, this ought
to be preserved.
Ey, Mike, Lonnie's
working on a book.
He's been doing
some for a couple
of years.
Why don't you two
get together and
compare notes?
(Lonnie)
Oh, really?
It's a good idea.
(Alan)
There's a cafe where
after sessions
we used
to hang around:
Joyce. Some tea.
(Lonnie)
Some tea?
Him. Smoke
a little rope.
Do you know
who he reminds me of?
John Lennon.
I don't think so.
John Lennon was
a good businessman.
[Lonnie chuckles]
He never got paid
by the word.
Right, Mike?
Why is he
so pissed off?
[Chuckles]
I don't know.
I don't care.
Why don't you
ask him?
[Ioud electronic music
playing]
(Alan)
Hey! Hi.
You having fun?
M mm-hmm.
Want something
from the bar?
U h-uh,
thank you.
I wish you could
dance with me.
We can't.
[Indistinct]
Move over so you
can make way for
my sweetheart.
Sit down,
darling.
What can l...
What can I get you?
White wine,
please.
[Snaps fingers]
[Trip-hop song playing]
# Through all space and time #
# you've been on my mind #
# Like a sweet red wine,
you flow #
(Lonnie, screaming
over music)
Fuck you!
# Like an ocean rain,
you float me away #
# And I'd like
to let you know ##
Hi, Mick.
How's that beer
you're drinking?
I think it's good,
Duigan.
Real good.
(Duigan)
Right, damn good.
Michael, I wanna
go back to the hotel.
Hear me? I wanna
go back to the hotel.
Did you hear me? I
You know what?
Fuck you!
Oh, whoa!
Easy! Take it easy.
I don't wanna
take it easy,
you take it easy!
I don't wanna take
anything easy.
I'm very angry.
I'm very, very angry,
and I wanna go home
right now!
What the fuck
is wrong with her?
Stop yelling.
[Phony chuckle]
Why?
Do you have
anything to tell me?
It's just a big
misunderstanding.
I'm sorry.
And if you'll sit down,
we'll talk about...
whatever you want.
(Duigan)
Somebody wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?
He's a good,
spoiled boy.
[Chuckles]
Oh, shit.
Let me out of here.
Anybody needs me,
I'll be in my office.
Good luck, mate.
(Michael)
Isn't that you friend
over there?
(guy)
What the fuck
you want, man?
Hey, hey I
Stop them I
[shouting, yelling]
[Struggling, crashing]
(woman)
Somebody give me
a hand, here.
(guy)
I don't know
what you fucking problem is!
(Duigan)
Sit down!
Sit down!
[Inaudible]
(Laura)
I want to go home!
Okay, I gotta see.
What, sweetie?
I want to go home.
Now.
It's only 11: 00.
What's...
Then give me the keys
if you don't want to go.
I want to go home.
Settle down, sugar.
Thank God.
It's locked.
It's open.
No!
[Door unlocks]
[Door unlocks]
Ready?
(Cindy)
Sure.
Let's go.
[Breathing heavily]
[Soft moaning]
[Groaning]
(Alan)
Hi, baby.
Hi.
Where
you've been?
We went... to a movie.
Oh, that's good.
Why didn't
you ask me?
I don't know.
That's alright.
Did you have
a good time?
Yes, it was
interesting.
Sweetie.
Are you still
with us?
I don't know.
[Sobs silently]
Hey!
Hey...
What is it?
I'm not doing
so well right now.
Why not?
[Sighs]
A lot of different
reasons, Alan.
Oh...
Don't do that,
sweetie, stop it.
Why?
Maybe it's good for me.
Okay.
It's, uh...
[sighs]
It's the school,
you know.
They want...
they...
Ask about you.
And, uh, I don't know
what to tell them.
They want you to...
To come in to
Sam's class, and...
I don't know.
I feel...
very stupid.
Because I know
you will never do it.
I'll do it.
A lot of parents
do it, you know.
It's not
a big problem.
I said I'd do it.
It's not all,
is it?
Sweetie,
look at me.
I'm not
a mind reader,
here, you know?
You're gonna have
to pick up the ball
a bit.
Tell me.
It's because
we're not married,
is it?
[Knocking on door]
Yeah!
What is it?
(Michael)
It's me.
Going out.
Can I borrow the car?
(Alan)
Sure, go ahead.
I need the keys.
Where's your keys?
I n the car.
Take Laura's.
The keys
are in the car.
Thanks.
Where do you think
he's going?
Michael?
Who the hell knows?
[Groans]
I'm gonna take
a shower.

not to cry #

falling down, down #
# Falling 40 shades

where I'm bound #

# You pretended

(woman)
Have you been
to St. Petersburg?
No, I haven't.
But I know
it's beautiful.
We were supposed
to go.
We never did.
We have been to London.
I liked it there.
It would have been nicer
in the Spring,
but even when we were
there it was beautiful!
What did you like
about it?
I liked...
the museums
and all the parks.
And we stayed
in a beautiful room.
(Alan)
We stayed at
the Claridge Hotel!
(April)
Very fancy I
(Laura)
When I got back...
when we got back,
I wanted to have
every room like that
at our house,
all with flowers
on the upholstery
and birds.
(Alan)
Isn't that
a great idea?
Laura is the only girl
I've ever had the pleasure
of knowing personally
that can also cook
and take care of the house.
I mean,
not one of my wives
could make gravy,
not even out of a can,
right? Not even
your sweet mother.
(Alan)
But I never gave
a damn about that.
I mean, she could
have a cook
if she wanted to.
[Alan chuckles]
(Michael)
If you hate being here,
why don't you just say so?
I don't hate being here.
You do.
And I came, anyway,
didn't I?
I did it for you.
I don't give
a shit about them.
Come here.
Come here.
(April)
Baby...
Who's your baby?
You're my baby.
Don't worry so much.
We're gonna be fine.
How do you know?
I just do,
that's all.
[Ioud rock and roll music]
[Chattering]
Hey!
Are you okay?
What's going on?
Hello.
Hi, General.
Hi, how you doing,
buddy?
Happy to see you.
Oh, here's
this guy!
Hey, get out
of here!
[Laughter]
(bartender)
Hello.
White wine, please.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Do you have juice?
Two?
[Playing
No Room For a Tramp]
#... whispered to me
so kindly #
# There's no room in here
for a tramp ##
[Alan laughs]
[The rest continue
to play the song]
How you doing,
Laura?
I'm okay.
You?
[Indistinct chatter]
Wanna take
a ride?
[Music continues]
[Jelly Roll Boogie

# If you ever come
to Memphis, Tennessee #
# And you wanna get

Whoo! Hey, hey!
[Music stops]
Thank you!
Come on up here.
I wanna say something.
I got an announcement.
Ohh I I'll be damned,
you all look a mess!
[laughter]
You must be having fun I
(Guests)
Yeah I
Okay. I just wanna say
there's a woman in my life,
and, as you know,
that ain't an easy gig I
She's done real good by me,
she's given me a precious
little boy,
and so, in the eyes of God,
and the state of Tennessee,
I wanna sanctify the joy
she has given me.
Here on this river,
in front of all our friends,
with the exception
of two or three,
[guests laugh]
I'm asking her to marry me,
I pray she says yes.
(guests)
Whoo!
Thank you.
[Clapping, cheering]
(whispers)
What are you doing,
Alan?
Sweetie.
(guests)
Whool Yeah I
[clapping, whistling]
(M C)
Hey, folks,
you remember this one!
[piano starts playing]
(Alan)
Help me out here.
# I let you go #
# Oh, what a fool
I was #
# To hurt you so #
# Oh, but now I know #
# All of the good times,
the big city sights #
# I had enough of
the bright party lights #
# They'll never make up
for my Ionely nights #
# 'Cause I need you ##
[music fades]
[No audio]
[Clapping, cheering]
Hold on, hold on.
Don't go anywhere.
(Michael)
I wanna add
my sentiments, too.
Ah I
Boy, Dad's right.
You all do look a mess.
[Laughter]
Ah. Some of you know
I was supposed
to say something
the other day at...
the, uh, salute to Dad,
and for a variety of reasons,
both reasonable
and unreasonable,
uh, I wasn't there.
So I'd like to say it now.
U h...
Ugh, Dad!
You're a real funny guy.
You've taught me nothing
as a father,
for which I thank God,
because what if you had?
Then I'd be like you, huh?
U h, you're a lousy dad,
but I wanna say
you are a great man...
[pfff]
And, uh...
Heck, as they say,
of all the sons of bitches,
you're one of 'em, huh?
(guests)
Amen.
And congratulations.
Good show, also.
And I really mean that.
Thank you, son.
(guest)
To love,
a toast to love!
[clapping, cheering]
[Jelly Roll Boogie
starts playing]
I don't want this.
Maybe you do.
Maybe you do,
there's nothing wrong
with wanting.
I probably
want it, too.
[Chatter]
[Blues music playing]
[Laughter]
I wanna tell you,
I don't give a shit
about any of this.
All I ever cared about
was the music.
That's my heart!
That's my heart!
And the rest of the world
can go kiss my ass
and throw it over you.
Laugh your
fucking asses off.
[Engine stops]
Do you hate
talking to me?
Yeah.
You like that?
Yes.
[Alan growls playfully]
[Sam giggles]
Hey, whoa,
that's good.
[Sam hums]
All set?
Pretty much.
[Toy xylophone plays]
Sit here,
right here.
Right here?
Okay.
Ha. Here.
[Xylophone plays]
I ironed these shirts
for you. What do you
want me to do with them?
Put them there.
[Footsteps approaching]
(Laura)
I want to speak to you
before you leave.
(Alan)
Sweetie, they're late
for the plane right now.
I want to talk
to your son.
I want
to talk to you.
I want to say
something to you.
Alone.
It'll take only
a minute, please!
[Sam chats]
Do you love her?
Laura,
what do you want?
What do I want?
I'm asking you
what do you want.
What do you want?
You are the one
who doesn't know
what he wants.
You told me so
yourself.
Don't do this
to yourself.
Tell me what
you think of me.
Please tell me,
I want to know.
What's wrong with me?
There is something
wrong with me.
Stop it.
You'll get over it.
It's not the worst thing
that ever happened.
Well, what is?
[Car horn honks]
Taxi's here.
We ready?
(April)
I am.
Let's go.
Bye, Sam.
Come here.
Be a good boy.
(April)
Thanks for
having me, Alan.
Anytime.
Come on.
You don't know anything.
You see only
what you want to see.
They are going
to have a baby.
(Laura)
Hi.
Hey, Laura.
I'll clean up
after he's finished.
(Laura)
Okay, thanks.
Can I ask you a question?
Can you just tell me
if I got the braid right?
Yes.
That's fine.
That looks nice.
It's still loose.
A little.
I though you were
gonna have it
tightened.
I did.
Most of it.
Not done it enough?
Well, why don't
we take it down
to the shop?
They can...
They can do it.
Wanna go down
there tomorrow?
Alright.
I thought...
I could take a piece
of a string and measure
my finger with it
and leave it.
This way they
would know for sure.
That's a good idea.
I got an...
I got an offer
from a bunch of
German businessmen.
Exactly four days
plus a week in a hotel.
All expenses paid
for both of us.
Any idea how much
they offered me?
[Chuckles]
It's positively
obscene.
I told them the last time
I was in Baden Baden
I was a kid in the army
and that's the way
I wanted to remember it.
I don't suppose
that's what they were
expecting, because they...
Ha ha ha!
The line
just went dead.
[Sobs silently]
You want me
to pull over?
No.
[Door closes]
[Weeps silently]
