1
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,223
No.

2
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:42,482
No means no.

3
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,786
Bonjour.

4
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,412
Carl, I know it's you.

5
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:57,289
Oh. Hey, man.

6
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,959
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,420
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send."

8
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:03,795
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,299
Yeah, I did. You never answer
when I don't.

10
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,010
So, what are you doing?

11
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:12,471
Oh, just hanging
out in my apartment.

12
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:15,099
- You did get my text, right?
- What? Text? What?

13
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,683
We're all going out tonight.

14
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:19,478
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

15
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,688
I'm just so jammed up.

16
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:22,689
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

17
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:24,150
No, I don't at all.

18
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,486
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

19
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:30,364
Any other night would've
been great. Darn it to heck.

20
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:31,783
Thing? What thing?

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,450
Thing, you know, just a thing.

22
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:36,537
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

23
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:38,956
- but I know there's a thing.
- A thing.

24
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:42,210
I don't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.

25
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:44,003
No, it says specific things.

26
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,256
Specific things. Like "get in
line at the video store"?

27
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:49,549
What? What are you talking about?

28
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:52,219
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

29
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:55,847
I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.

30
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,811
- That's not me.
- It's not?

31
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:03,688
Oh, I know what's happening. There is
this guy who looks just like me...

32
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:05,900
who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

33
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,692
That's probably who you're seeing.

34
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,902
Wow, that's amazing...

35
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,989
because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

36
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,700
Carl, I know you're
not saying anything.

37
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,122
Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.

38
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,957
- What? All right.
- Carl.

39
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:28,256
- Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

40
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:30,508
- Wow.
- Hi.

41
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,884
- I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

42
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:36,472
Carl Allen. Never thought
I'd see the day, my man.

43
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,432
- Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

44
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:41,561
No, I just got a
lot of stuff going on...

45
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:45,313
some things I gotta do, issues
pending, keep me pretty busy.

46
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,066
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

47
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,694
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

48
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:52,280
because we have
an announcement to make.

49
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:54,365
Honey, show him.

50
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:57,075
Oh! There it is. Deal with it.

51
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,578
We're engaged.

52
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,122
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

53
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,876
- Big step, huh?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

54
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:06,919
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

55
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,420
What has it been, six months?

56
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,423
- No.
- Two years.

57
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,092
Oh, yeah.
That's about right, then.

58
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:17,847
So anyway, we're gonna have an
engagement party on the 21st. Open bar.

59
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,098
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

60
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,268
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

61
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:25,687
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

62
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,439
Oh, God, look who's here.

63
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,234
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

64
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,445
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

65
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,699
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

66
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,786
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

67
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,789
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,628
They're touching each other's
genitals. Isn't that amazing?

69
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:52,924
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

70
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,384
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

71
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,762
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

72
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,556
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

73
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:02,766
Carl. Peter.

74
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:04,310
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

75
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,728
Hey.

76
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:07,979
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

77
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,150
- I don't believe we...
- No, I don't believe we have.

78
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,944
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

79
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,656
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

80
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,406
You just got here, too, Carl.

81
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:22,161
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

82
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,331
Yeah, that's a thing. There's
a thing, and there's no time.

83
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,417
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

84
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:32,254
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

85
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,175
Wow. That didn't sound
quite right. Oh, well.

86
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,927
Whoa!

87
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,605
See you, guys.

88
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:12,336
- Oh! Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

89
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:14,838
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

90
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,132
Gee, that sounds great,
but I can't.

91
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,218
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

92
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,971
How about some toast, huh?

93
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,391
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

94
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,851
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

95
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:30,437
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

96
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:33,189
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

97
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:36,694
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

98
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:38,821
Yeah, bye.

99
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:43,951
Persianwifefinder.com.
No, thank you.

100
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:48,204
Costume party. Yeah, no.

101
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,167
Oh, boy.

102
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,254
Here we go.

103
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:59,341
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

104
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,595
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

105
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:05,514
Norman. Line one.

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,060
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

107
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:12,271
- I'll just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

108
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,439
You're with Norman.

109
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:20,278
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

110
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,781
Okay.

111
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,117
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

112
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,702
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

113
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,954
Tried to fight for you
on the phone there.

114
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,665
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

115
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,752
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

116
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,298
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

117
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,593
Look at it this way:
At least you didn't get shit-canned.

118
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:45,553
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

119
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:49,307
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

120
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,394
No, it's a pretty common expression.

121
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,314
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

122
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,526
This'll cheer you up. I'm having
a little get-together at my place.

123
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:03,656
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

124
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,242
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

125
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,827
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

126
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,161
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

127
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:12,665
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

128
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,209
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

129
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,043
regardless of what I was gonna say.

130
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,838
- Hm.
- Huh.

131
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,923
I admit, business has been slow.

132
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:25,009
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

133
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:27,262
what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

134
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,850
but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

135
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:34,937
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

136
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:36,271
- None.
- And your credit...

137
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,983
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

138
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:42,194
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

139
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:55,875
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

140
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,877
Nick Lane? Hey.

141
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,005
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:06,302
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the nametag.

143
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,512
You must be running
this place by now.

144
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,182
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

145
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,725
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

146
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,560
God.

147
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:18,730
She's good.
What have you been doing?

148
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,067
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

149
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,737
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

150
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,490
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

151
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:30,658
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

152
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:34,078
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

153
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,206
I'm a yes man.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,335
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

155
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:41,253
No, thanks. I'm fine.

156
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,172
"Fine?" I wipe my ass with "fine."

157
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,006
Wow. Okay.

158
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:49,677
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

159
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,679
No, you don't.

160
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:54,557
Why don't you take this rock...

161
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:57,852
throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

162
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,023
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

163
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,024
Do you wanna throw that rock
at the bank?

164
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,777
Yes.

165
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,946
Oh, my God.

166
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,280
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

167
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,783
Stay right there.

168
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,784
- He's gonna break.
- Stop.

169
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:21,293
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

170
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,337
- Whoo!
- Hey, stop. Stop!

171
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:36,642
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

172
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,309
Sorry.

173
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,980
- Hello?
- Stephanie?

174
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,482
- Carl.
- Yeah, it's me.

175
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,778
Just felt like calling you. I was
missing you, I guess. Weird, huh?

176
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:50,697
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

177
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:54,076
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

178
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,287
Good for you. Good for you.

179
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:11,176
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

180
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:21,312
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

181
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,990
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

182
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:37,536
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

183
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,038
You're so full of shit.

184
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:43,875
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

185
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,836
You know what, buddy? You missed
my engagement party tonight.

186
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:50,548
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

187
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,969
- Mm-hm.
- I'm so sorry, man. I totally gapped it.

188
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:56,721
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

189
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,725
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'll go out, swashbuckle.

190
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,269
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

191
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:06,481
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

192
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:09,652
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

193
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,236
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

194
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,490
And I know that you have issues
because of it, but this isn't about you.

195
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:17,033
It's about me.

196
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:20,245
When's the last time you did anything
fun? You always make excuses.

197
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,873
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down."

198
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,250
I mean, do you even know
my fiancée's last name?

199
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,379
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

200
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:32,758
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

201
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,177
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

202
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,846
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

203
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,390
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

204
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:43,268
And guess what.
She doesn't like my best friend.

205
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,938
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

206
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,941
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, I...

207
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:52,235
I don't wanna hear another excuse,
Carl. You do whatever you want.

208
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:55,739
I'm telling you, you don't change
your life, you're gonna end up lonely.

209
00:11:55,907 --> 00:12:01,285
A lonely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

210
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,793
Hey, Carl.

211
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,590
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

212
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,931
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

213
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,643
Nope. No more than usual.

214
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:28,647
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

215
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,318
I guess I never saw him a lot, so it's
hard for me to tell the difference.

216
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,279
Yeah, that's true.

217
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,615
He never did much.

218
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,116
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

219
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,745
Wasn't a good anything.

220
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:46,914
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

221
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:48,917
Now, that's upsetting.

222
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:56,716
What was that?

223
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:43,721
Welcome to yes.
We are about to begin.

224
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:46,557
Please, find a seat.

225
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,062
Carl? Hey, Carl! Psst!

226
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,772
Carl, man, hey.

227
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,066
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

228
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,400
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...?

229
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,736
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

230
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,740
I saw it in your eyes, man. You're gonna
love this. Terrence is a genius.

231
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,953
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

232
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,581
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

233
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,957
That's why you're here.

234
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:15,003
You have got to start saying yes,
my man, and I mean to everything.

235
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,004
It's starting.

236
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,549
Life.

237
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:23,427
We are all living it. Or are we?

238
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,971
Ooh, heavy.

239
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,267
Change is generated
from consciousness...

240
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,562
but where is consciousness
generated from?

241
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,855
From the external.

242
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:38,110
And how do we control the external?
With one word.

243
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,195
And what is that word?

244
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:42,780
- Yes!
- Jeez.

245
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:46,951
Yes.

246
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:48,620
Yes.

247
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:54,293
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

248
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:00,923
- Yes!
- Whoo!

249
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,427
The word is "Yes."

250
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,471
Yes, yes, yes.

251
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,892
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

252
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,768
Say it a million more times.

253
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:15,230
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

254
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:17,524
Yes!

255
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,573
Yes.

256
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:30,745
I want you to invite yes
into your lives...

257
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:35,750
because it will RSVP "yes."

258
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:41,840
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

259
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:48,429
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

260
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:55,354
Before we begin today, I'd like
to welcome our new members.

261
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,649
Who among you is new?

262
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,693
He is. This guy right here.
He's new.

263
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,029
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

264
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:11,452
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

265
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:19,043
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

266
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:24,841
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

267
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:26,217
Uh...

268
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,681
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

269
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:33,225
Thank you.

270
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,477
Back up just a little bit more.

271
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:39,398
- No.
- No man. No man.

272
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,649
No man. No man. No man.

273
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,025
No man. No man.

274
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:44,568
Okay.

275
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:49,240
If the molehill
won't come to Terrence...

276
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:53,662
Terrence will come to the molehill.

277
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:02,879
What's your name?

278
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,090
Carl.

279
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,925
Let me guess, Carl.

280
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,761
Someone talked you into coming
here today, didn't they?

281
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,348
- Yes.
- Yes!

282
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:18,269
And you're not sure about this,
are you?

283
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:19,895
No.

284
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:24,108
No man. No man.
No man. No man.

285
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,943
You're dead, Carl.

286
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:30,031
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

287
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,201
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

288
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:34,744
and to yourself.

289
00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:38,789
You're stuck in the same dead-end
job. You have been for years.

290
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,211
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

291
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,255
And you lost the love of your life...

292
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:48,424
because she couldn't be with
someone who didn't live theirs.

293
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:56,223
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

294
00:17:56,392 --> 00:18:00,561
you can't even summon the
enthusiasm necessary to masturbate.

295
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:03,690
Am I right, Carl?

296
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,818
Um...

297
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:11,573
I have had some trouble.

298
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:21,625
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

299
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:25,252
- Do you want to make a covenant?
- Uh...

300
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,214
The word is "yes," Carl.

301
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:30,842
- Yes!
- Yes.

302
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,510
Yes!

303
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,513
Once you leave this building...

304
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:39,683
every time an opportunity
presents itself...

305
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,686
no matter what it is...

306
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,897
you will say yes.

307
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:47,651
- Yes!
- Yes!

308
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:49,903
- Yes!
- Yes.

309
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,115
What if I...

310
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,034
say...

311
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,993
the other word?

312
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,705
You'll be making
a promise to yourself.

313
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,919
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

314
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:09,381
things can get a little dicey.

315
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,134
What do you say, Carl?

316
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,761
Are you ready to make a covenant?

317
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,721
- Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

318
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,182
- Yes.
- Yes.

319
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:21,476
- Yes!
- Again.

320
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,060
- Yes.
- Yes!

321
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,063
- Say it again.
- Yes!

322
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:30,861
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

323
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:35,740
Yes!

324
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,478
Hey, there he is.

325
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,396
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

326
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:08,940
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

327
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,401
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

328
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:15,029
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

329
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:19,409
That's weird. I didn't realize we just
stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

330
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:24,788
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

331
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,292
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

332
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:31,046
Oh. Uh...

333
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:32,588
Yes!

334
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,300
Sure, he can. Right, Carl?

335
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,676
Uh...

336
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,597
Yeah, why not?

337
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:46,144
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

338
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:56,153
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

339
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,686
Keep going or this'll do,
because it doesn't really matter?

340
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,021
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

341
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,817
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

342
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:36,694
Go ahead.

343
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:39,530
And what did you say?

344
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:46,121
Oh, I'm just right over here.
Okay. Yeah.

345
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,955
What? Hello? Hello?

346
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,835
Oh, shit, man.
Your battery's dead.

347
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:53,670
Oh, great.

348
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,883
- Thanks.
- Well, gracias, amigo.

349
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,511
I mean, it's real nice of you to give
me a ride. Most people just say no.

350
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,348
Course, I have been having a lot of
luck lately outside of that hotel.

351
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:09,184
No problem. Have a good night.

352
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,980
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

353
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:15,400
Okay.

354
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,569
I've come this far.

355
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,198
Yes, you can.

356
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:25,076
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

357
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,251
Sure. It's all yours.

358
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:39,590
God bless you, man.

359
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,446
Oh, come on.

360
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:05,450
Come on, come on.

361
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,122
Perfect.

362
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,626
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give all
your money away to a homeless guy?

363
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,295
Yes, yes, I do.

364
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,005
Letting him
burn out your phone...

365
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:21,465
so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

366
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,134
That sounds like a
fucking great idea!

367
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:27,137
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

368
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:30,642
and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

369
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:49,827
Come on, man.

370
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,791
Yes. Since that's my only
fucking option.

371
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,977
Would you like to carry
a 20-pound container of gas...

372
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:15,769
up a giant hill to your car?

373
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:19,022
Oh, could I? Could I really?

374
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:21,942
That's a good look.

375
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:23,569
Oh.

376
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:27,365
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

377
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,701
Did you just run out of gas?

378
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:32,453
Maybe.

379
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:38,125
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

380
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:41,128
When you were driving out of your way
to drop off a homeless guy...

381
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:44,048
who wore out your battery
so you couldn't call AAA?

382
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:47,050
No. I take it
that's what happened to you.

383
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,596
No. Why would you assume that?

384
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:52,807
He used up your phone?

385
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:56,894
Yeah. Apparently he was the most
popular homeless man on the planet.

386
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:59,689
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

387
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:02,858
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

388
00:25:03,027 --> 00:25:05,653
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

389
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,323
Yeah. And I'm getting
some exercise, which is cool.

390
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,700
Well, do you need a ride?

391
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,327
On that thing?

392
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:26,215
Am I going too fast for you?

393
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:29,259
No. In fact,
I think you should go faster.

394
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:32,180
That way if we crash,
at least I'll die.

395
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:35,098
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

396
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:49,279
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

397
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:55,202
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!

398
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:11,678
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

399
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,140
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

400
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:19,560
Hopefully the color will return
to your face sometime soon.

401
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,730
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

402
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:26,401
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

403
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,155
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

404
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,490
Yeah.

405
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,827
Thanks.

406
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:39,122
So you okay?

407
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,500
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

408
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,169
- What?
- What did you say?

409
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,424
Hey, I...

410
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:57,765
Have a good night.

411
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,959
Yes.

412
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:35,845
"Yes always leads
to something good.

413
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,059
Never avoid opportunities.

414
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,354
They may come in any form."

415
00:27:48,858 --> 00:27:52,069
- Hello?
- Carl, it's your buddy Norman.

416
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,198
Well, and your boss, but more
your buddy than your boss, right?

417
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:57,075
I guess.

418
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:01,244
So, look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

419
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,080
Is there any way you could come in?

420
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,290
Sure.

421
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:08,920
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

422
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:13,340
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

423
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:21,432
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

424
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:23,684
Right.

425
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,936
Like I need that.

426
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:35,153
- Persian wifefinder.
- Hi there. I am Faranoush.

427
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,824
Would you be the man for me?

428
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:40,034
I guess so.

429
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,413
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

430
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,873
And what's your business?

431
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,292
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

432
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,631
- Oh, wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No. It's Bono.

433
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:56,718
Oh. Yeah, right.

434
00:28:56,884 --> 00:28:59,261
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

435
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:01,972
So, what do you think?

436
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:06,853
I think yes.

437
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,651
Inta-maresting.

438
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,611
Cakes, huh?

439
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:19,865
Yeah. I just kind of went
with my gut on it, Norm.

440
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,701
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

441
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:26,413
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

442
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:31,419
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

443
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:33,503
Yeah. Carl's pretty
short already, but...

444
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,839
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

445
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,884
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

446
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,093
What?

447
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,847
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

448
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,602
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of
Demko, or along with Demko...

449
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,188
whichever, or I walk."

450
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,647
Really? What did they say?

451
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:56,527
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

452
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,029
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

453
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:02,700
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

454
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:04,493
And?

455
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,037
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

456
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,954
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

457
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:09,874
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

458
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,875
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

459
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,377
to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

460
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,713
- No.
- How did you know that?

461
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:17,923
He's not here.

462
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,468
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

463
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:23,637
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

464
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:27,307
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

465
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:31,520
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

466
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:34,523
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

467
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:37,401
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

468
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,944
Oh.

469
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:40,488
See what I did there?

470
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:45,951
I joined "bro" with "Joseph."
Broseph. Pretty cool, huh?

471
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:47,953
Very cool, Norm.

472
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:55,044
I have been such
a dick and a douche.

473
00:30:55,461 --> 00:30:57,838
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

474
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:00,799
but I'm sorry. I should have
been there. I mean, really.

475
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,718
You're preaching to the choir, Carl.

476
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:05,637
I'm telling you, man,
things are different.

477
00:31:05,806 --> 00:31:08,348
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

478
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:12,269
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said:
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

479
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:16,481
and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

480
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,609
All right. Look, gets you
out of the house, I'm all for it.

481
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:22,070
Excuse me. Could we get
another round of drinks?

482
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:24,115
And actually,
we're gonna start a tab...

483
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,242
and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

484
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,954
Well, you're okay with that,
right, buddy?

485
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:33,540
Yes. Yes, I am.

486
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,084
Okay.

487
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:43,425
I should be prepping my case for
Monday, but I cannot miss this.

488
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:46,804
Hey, you, another
bump of hot sauce.

489
00:31:48,265 --> 00:31:52,309
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

490
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,231
Argh!

491
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,403
Okay, okay.

492
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:23,840
He did it.

493
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:35,144
Drinks on me.

494
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,188
Crazy, man.

495
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:39,981
Carl, that was so awesome.

496
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,609
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could I...?

497
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:44,612
Absolutely.

498
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:48,990
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

499
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,913
Was I chewing gum before?

500
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,624
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

501
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,460
Easy, easy. It was a little
misunderstanding, okay?

502
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:04,839
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

503
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:08,176
I made a sacred "conevant."

504
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,304
That sounded naughty.

505
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:13,723
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

506
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:17,228
Okay, it's okay.
I got this. I got this.

507
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:20,230
Okay. But if I win...

508
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,276
I get to take that pretty
girl of yours to a ball...

509
00:33:24,443 --> 00:33:26,778
because she deserves that.

510
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:30,407
Every pretty girl deserves
to go to a ball.

511
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,160
That is so nice.

512
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:38,082
Oh, shit.

513
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:44,797
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

514
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:47,590
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

515
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,468
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

516
00:33:49,635 --> 00:33:52,387
- I haven't fighted in a fight since grade 7.
- I know.

517
00:33:52,556 --> 00:33:54,472
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

518
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:58,227
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

519
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:00,645
You want some, huh, more?

520
00:34:00,814 --> 00:34:04,191
Because I am open for business,
okay? Oh, where'd I go?

521
00:34:04,817 --> 00:34:06,443
Oh, where'd I go?

522
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,695
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

523
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:13,284
Did you see The
Legend of Billy Jack?

524
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:16,119
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

525
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:20,041
and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

526
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,793
and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

527
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:27,130
Just don't break
my teeth off on the curb, okay?

528
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:31,135
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

529
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,344
What?

530
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:37,307
First, we have
to establish the ground rules.

531
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:40,853
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

532
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:48,152
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

533
00:34:48,445 --> 00:34:51,072
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

534
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,782
That's why you got punched out...

535
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:56,494
because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

536
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,079
I'm over here, dickhole.

537
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:02,208
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

538
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,501
You're a complete...

539
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:06,836
You all right?

540
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,090
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

541
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:11,007
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

542
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,177
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

543
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,179
I'm glad we had this experience.

544
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:20,768
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

545
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:27,608
- We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

546
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,239
She's never gonna go to a ball.

547
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:36,199
No. No, she's not.

548
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:11,943
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

549
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:13,528
What can I do for you?

550
00:36:13,697 --> 00:36:17,032
Well, I was wondering if you could
help me put up some shelves.

551
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:19,617
Oh, really?

552
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:31,963
Okay. That should just about do it.

553
00:36:32,132 --> 00:36:35,550
- I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

554
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:39,262
Oh, not so fast.

555
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:41,264
Oh. What are you doing?

556
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:46,103
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

557
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,813
I'm getting so forgetful.

558
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:52,067
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

559
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:55,028
I am gonna have to
repay you somehow.

560
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:59,282
Oh, just doing a favor for a
neighbor is good enough for me.

561
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:03,036
You are so handsome.

562
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:07,750
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

563
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:13,588
Well, I'm just... I'm not in
a serious thing, but I am dating.

564
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:16,425
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

565
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:19,427
You know, a sexual release?

566
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,971
Uh...

567
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:26,184
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

568
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:30,021
You just lay back and I will
take care of everything.

569
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,567
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

570
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:36,820
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

571
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:40,240
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

572
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:45,371
And I've got this thing I
gotta do, so I'll be seeing you.

573
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:49,666
In my nightmares.

574
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:53,336
Oh, come on, give me a break.

575
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,507
Terrence said this would happen
if I said no. That's ridiculous.

576
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:02,429
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

577
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,568
Nice dog.

578
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:33,585
Just relax. I'll handle this.

579
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,884
Oh, God!

580
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:45,639
Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...

581
00:38:46,432 --> 00:38:47,557
Wow.

582
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:50,059
That... Oh...

583
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:51,436
Wow.

584
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:53,063
That is a...

585
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,065
How are you doing that? Ay!

favorite Harry Potter character."

587
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:06,492
You got it, Norm.

588
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:55,541
Hi.

589
00:39:57,711 --> 00:40:01,215
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a.m. and 5:30?

Hello. Wondering if you
had a moment...

592
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:10,599
- to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

- Buttercup Girls.
- Buttercup Girls.

00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,481
Yeah. All right.

595

Hey. It's really working. Ah!

596
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:33,079
It's beautiful, man.
It's beautiful.

597
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:36,833
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

598
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,668
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

Homeless. Hm.

608

- Cool.

00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:50,063
It's in Griffith Park and we do
a loop. It's about five miles.

673
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:51,856
It's at 6 a.m.

674
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:56,987
Wow. I haven't been up
at 6 a.m. in, like, never.

675
00:45:57,155 --> 00:46:01,282
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

676
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,077
Okay, so you're in a band...

677
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:07,329
you do the jogging photography,
what else?

678
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:09,666
Whatever I want.

679
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,170
I volunteer at a shelter.
I paint a little bit.

680
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:15,797
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

681
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:18,215
And some nude modeling, FYI.

682
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,596
Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...

683
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:28,351
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

684
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:30,644
I didn't ask you out.

685
00:46:30,813 --> 00:46:33,023
Could have fooled me
with that modeling comment.

686
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,565
You said that.

687
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:37,360
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

688
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:42,282
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

689
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:46,536
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

690
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:47,871
Yeah, I'd love to.

691
00:46:49,456 --> 00:46:53,376
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow...

692
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:56,797
- Carl.
- Allison.

693
00:47:13,606 --> 00:47:14,648
Yeah, Rooney?

694
00:47:14,815 --> 00:47:16,565
Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.

695
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:20,277
Got a case of Red Bull. Gonna
pull an all-nighter. You down?

696
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:22,030
Yeah.

697
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,039
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

698
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,458
- Allison?
- Yeah?

699
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:35,501
Do we need to use a flash?

700
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,503
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

701
00:47:44,971 --> 00:47:49,181
Whoo! Beautiful night, guys. You take
it to the limit, and I respect that.

702
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,143
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

703
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:56,398
Carl, if somebody asked me to
describe tonight, I would just go, "Ow!"

704
00:47:56,565 --> 00:47:59,608
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly
know you, but I feel comfortable.

705
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:03,737
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

706
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:06,532
Allison, I'm here.

707
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:09,369
Allison.

708
00:48:10,746 --> 00:48:13,748
Hey. Who were those guys?

709
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:17,210
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a nurse. I was making fun of him.

710
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:20,297
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

711
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:22,757
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

712
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:26,635
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

713
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,679
I got a new necklace.
Glows in the dark.

714
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:31,224
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

715
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:34,811
That's really something. Doesn't
Red Bull make you crash pretty hard?

716
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,731
No, no, no. No, no.
I don't think so. No.

717
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:40,900
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

718
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:43,485
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

719
00:48:43,653 --> 00:48:45,237
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

720
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:46,530
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

721
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,949
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

722
00:48:48,117 --> 00:48:50,409
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

723
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:52,661
Red Bull.

724
00:48:53,246 --> 00:48:57,918
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

725
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:00,503
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

726
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:04,840
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

727
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,432
Oh, it's a good one.

728
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:16,478
Hold that.

729
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,021
Got it.

730
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:31,201
Hey, Carl, you okay?

731
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:35,914
Hold it right there.

732
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,804
Ohh!

733
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,722
That's good.

734
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:58,978
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

735
00:49:59,355 --> 00:50:01,271
Kind of mysterious.

736
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,565
You know, listen.

737
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:06,193
I like to keep it fresh. I like to
live it up. I like to mix it up.

738
00:50:06,362 --> 00:50:08,697
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this.

739
00:50:08,864 --> 00:50:10,739
I love that.

740
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:14,077
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine.

741
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,329
- Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

742
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:19,916
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

743
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,751
just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

744
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,588
I know. It's so frustrating. I just wanna
grab these people and shake them.

745
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:30,510
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing out
on a little thing called life."

746
00:50:30,677 --> 00:50:32,429
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

747
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:36,349
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

748
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:39,768
It just didn't work out.
It's a long story.

749
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,356
Yeah? Same story
you were singing about last night?

750
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,775
Might be.

751
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:49,653
Closed-off-little-box boy,
tender topic. Probe no further.

752
00:50:49,822 --> 00:50:53,115
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

753
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:56,286
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

754
00:50:56,454 --> 00:51:00,081
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

755
00:51:00,248 --> 00:51:01,623
Gone, never saw him again.

756
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,170
Wow. That's rough. I'm sorry.

757
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,715
Next time you should warn me about
the length of the story, though.

758
00:51:09,884 --> 00:51:10,967
Kind of dragged on.

759
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:13,469
- I'll work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

760
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:17,766
Ooh! Jeez. That was very healthy.

761
00:51:29,445 --> 00:51:31,905
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

762
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:34,532
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

763
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:36,201
She's the complete opposite of me.

764
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:38,661
Carl, could you please
pass the Cholula?

765
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,829
Sure, Faranoush.

766
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:43,166
How did you two meet again?

767
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:47,003
Persianwifefinder.com. It's pretty
cool. You should check it out.

768
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,588
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

769
00:51:49,757 --> 00:51:52,175
Should you talk about
Allison in front of Faranoush?

770
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,177
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

771
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:59,181
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

772
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,766
Oh. Sorry, Faranoush.

773
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:05,188
Anyway, I never would've met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

774
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:07,523
You wouldn't be on a date
with a strange woman.

775
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,068
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

776
00:52:10,235 --> 00:52:13,362
I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

777
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,032
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

778
00:52:20,121 --> 00:52:22,413
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

779
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,708
Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy.

780
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:28,545
- Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

781
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,422
So my friends are
being really lame...

782
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,760
and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

783
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:38,304
Hey, I have an idea.

784
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:41,557
Carl, would you like to throw
Lucy a bridal shower?

785
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:44,811
Yeah. Sure.

786
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:47,230
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

787
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:48,940
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

788
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,235
Uh...

789
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:56,864
- Really?
- Yeah.

790
00:52:57,032 --> 00:53:00,076
Well, thanks, Carl.

791
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:04,496
Thanks, that's really sweet.

792
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:06,791
- That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

793
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:08,960
Thanks, Faranoush.

794
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:12,005
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up
costumes for me and Allison.

795
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:13,422
Costumes for what?

796
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,552
Expelliarmus! Just kidding.

797
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:19,804
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

798
00:53:19,972 --> 00:53:23,766
Oh. Kaching!
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

799
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,518
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

800
00:53:26,686 --> 00:53:29,938
This is Allison and her
wand made from a sequoia.

801
00:53:30,148 --> 00:53:32,233
- Whoo! Hi.
- You must be Norman.

802
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,570
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

803
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:40,574
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

804
00:53:40,742 --> 00:53:42,367
chips, dips...

805
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:45,871
and good people, just like you two.

806
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:47,998
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

807
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:49,918
It's gonna be a crazy night.

808
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,300
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

809
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:01,012
- Good dip, huh, H.P.?
- Mm.

810
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:05,349
Got tons of it at Costco. You see,
I've got an exclusive membership card.

811
00:54:05,516 --> 00:54:08,478
And with that card,
I get access to the whole place.

812
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:12,273
I can buy large quantities of
anything at discount prices.

813
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,817
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

814
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:18,947
No, don't think so. But I can
talk to someone, if you'd like.

815
00:54:19,697 --> 00:54:22,324
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

816
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,954
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

817
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:30,833
"I'm not going home, not really."

818
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,463
Oh, bye.

819
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:43,429
Alrighty, gang. Who wants
to watch Chamber of Secrets?

820
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:55,108
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

821
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:57,818
Good to meet you, too. Thank you.
And hey.

822
00:54:57,987 --> 00:55:01,197
- Oh.
- That's right. Come in. I'll go in.

823
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:05,201
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

824
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,704
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

825
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:10,664
- That's all right.
- Bye-bye.

826
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,918
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

827
00:55:14,085 --> 00:55:16,170
Next stop, Azkaban.

828
00:55:24,596 --> 00:55:25,887
Hey.

829
00:55:26,264 --> 00:55:28,432
Do you wanna drive?

830
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:38,067
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

831
00:55:39,445 --> 00:55:41,737
Whoa. Yep, I got it.

832
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:49,829
I got an idea.

833
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:59,797
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

834
00:56:02,885 --> 00:56:07,262
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

835
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:15,063
- This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

836
00:56:41,047 --> 00:56:43,632
This is unreal.

837
00:56:43,842 --> 00:56:45,967
I couldn't agree more.

838
00:56:56,188 --> 00:56:57,521
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

839
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:08,365
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

840
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,677
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

841
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:32,014
I've never let anyone kiss me on the
stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

842
00:57:56,414 --> 00:57:58,498
Good evening, Los Angeles.

843
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:01,710
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

844
00:58:03,797 --> 00:58:05,172
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

845
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,548
I killed her.

846
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,302
I'm a somebody.

847
00:58:10,512 --> 00:58:12,722
I don't know about that.

848
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,474
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

849
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:18,853
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

850
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:21,731
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

851
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:26,902
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

852
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,489
How many people
can this place even hold?

853
00:58:29,655 --> 00:58:31,239
Like 17,000.

854
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:36,286
So each one of us invites 1,800
of our closest friends.

855
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:39,414
No need. I know our music
isn't that mainstream.

856
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,416
- What?
- I love doing it.

857
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,376
It's like my photography.

858
00:58:43,545 --> 00:58:46,005
I know there isn't that much
demand for photographs...

859
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:47,757
taken while running, but...

860
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:50,092
I wasn't gonna say anything.

861
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,762
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

862
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:55,556
You know that when you're a kid...

863
00:58:55,724 --> 00:58:58,351
but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

864
00:58:59,143 --> 00:59:01,103
I love your music.

865
00:59:01,355 --> 00:59:04,190
Anybody can take a photo
standing still.

866
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,777
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

867
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,612
- Stop.
- Stopping.

868
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,074
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

869
00:59:13,242 --> 00:59:14,617
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

870
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,577
- Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

871
00:59:16,744 --> 00:59:21,164
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- All right. I can't please everyone.

872
00:59:24,335 --> 00:59:25,585
Run!

873
00:59:25,836 --> 00:59:27,547
Hello, everybody.

874
00:59:27,713 --> 00:59:33,135
A little vitamin C. Keep your
strength up. I will be right with you.

875
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:35,471
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

876
00:59:39,893 --> 00:59:42,603
- Lee?
- Hey.

877
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:45,231
What up, my brizzo?

878
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:49,652
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

879
00:59:50,778 --> 00:59:53,155
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

880
00:59:54,574 --> 00:59:56,659
What's going on, Norm?

881
00:59:56,827 --> 00:59:58,661
Something's going down
on a big scale.

882
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:02,789
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

883
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:05,293
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

884
01:00:05,543 --> 01:00:06,626
Ooh.

885
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:09,505
Well, we had a nice run.

886
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,965
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

887
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,302
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

888
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:17,597
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

889
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:20,181
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

890
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:23,018
You were feeling it. You were
in the loan zone, remember?

891
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:24,436
- I was.
- I was watching you.

892
01:00:24,605 --> 01:00:25,855
Yeah, you were.

893
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:29,525
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

894
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:32,862
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

895
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:36,032
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

896
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,034
You may be my last loan.

897
01:00:39,286 --> 01:00:41,746
- Oh.
- It's a Ducati.

898
01:00:41,913 --> 01:00:45,416
I'm thinking it'll get people off
my back about the male-nurse thing.

899
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:50,253
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

900
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,884
See you on the other side, Lee.

901
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:59,387
Carl.

902
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,934
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

903
01:01:05,103 --> 01:01:07,021
Pleasure to meet you.

904
01:01:14,195 --> 01:01:18,865
Every two months, the typical loan
officer approves 35 to 40 loans.

905
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:21,077
You have given out...

906
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:23,788
561.

907
01:01:24,498 --> 01:01:26,039
A little more than average, then.

908
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,583
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

909
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:35,965
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

910
01:01:36,134 --> 01:01:38,094
Have you ever tried that?
It's fun.

911
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,262
Carl, this bank traditionally
has never given out small loans.

912
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,556
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down.

913
01:01:43,724 --> 01:01:46,184
At first I thought
you might be raiding our coffers.

914
01:01:46,394 --> 01:01:49,396
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

915
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:58,864
- But...
- Ha-ha-ha! Oh.

916
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:00,782
But then I looked closer.

917
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:04,244
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

918
01:02:04,413 --> 01:02:07,539
more than 98 percent of them are
following through with payments.

919
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:09,791
And because you've given out
so many of them...

920
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,255
we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-loans, not bad.

921
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,673
See, Car, you worrywart.

922
01:02:16,842 --> 01:02:20,427
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

923
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:22,847
- Corporate?
- Wow.

924
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:25,181
That's great. I would have to say...

925
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:28,184
No, wait.
Before we give our answer...

926
01:02:28,353 --> 01:02:30,521
let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

927
01:02:30,688 --> 01:02:34,608
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with
you, since we're only taking Carl.

928
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,485
Got it. Yep.

929
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,612
We'll have the employment contract
to you by the end of the day.

930
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,324
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

931
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:46,996
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

932
01:02:53,711 --> 01:02:55,170
Oh, this one is nice.

933
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,132
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

934
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,340
- I love it.
- Yeah?

935
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,842
Yeah.

936
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:04,597
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

937
01:03:04,764 --> 01:03:06,514
It's the same as regular bingo...

938
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:10,311
but you just yell embarrassing
facts about the bride, okay?

939
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:12,396
Yeah.

940
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:14,481
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

941
01:03:14,648 --> 01:03:16,233
I don't want anything complicated.

942
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,195
You gotta squeeze every drop of
juice out of this experience.

943
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,822
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

944
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:25,576
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

945
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:30,581
Maybe we should just
go somewhere else.

946
01:03:30,748 --> 01:03:32,958
It's okay. I'll talk to her.

947
01:04:21,842 --> 01:04:22,882
Okay.

948
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:29,097
Okay, bridal bingo
very simple, okay?

949
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:32,684
I can explain to you in
more detail if you want.

950
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,568
What's going on?

951
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,362
I mean, someone's trying
to kill himself.

952
01:04:44,572 --> 01:04:47,240
Oh. Jump.

953
01:04:47,826 --> 01:04:51,202
What the hell are
you looking at? Huh?

954
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:54,914
- Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

955
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,958
Hey, lady, move that dog.

956
01:04:57,585 --> 01:05:00,128
Buddy, can you move over a
little bit, like two feet?

957
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:01,797
Has somebody called the police?

958
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:05,425
Yeah. He'll be dead before they get
here. Somebody needs to talk him down.

959
01:05:05,594 --> 01:05:08,929
- Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

960
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,157
Don't do it.

961
01:05:31,286 --> 01:05:33,161
It can't be that bad.

962
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:36,998
- Hey, buddy.
- Whoa.

963
01:05:37,626 --> 01:05:39,126
Who are you, man?

964
01:05:39,293 --> 01:05:43,005
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill
myself, so don't try to stop me.

965
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:46,090
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

966
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:49,802
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

967
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:52,514
I should say
something to you here.

968
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:54,016
Um...

969
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:55,726
I don't really know what it is.

970
01:05:55,893 --> 01:05:58,019
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

971
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:00,146
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

972
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,985
Wait. I've got it.

973
01:06:08,907 --> 01:06:10,532
Where you going, man?

974
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:12,284
I know it's not
what I think it is.

975
01:06:12,452 --> 01:06:13,494
Just stop.

976
01:06:13,661 --> 01:06:15,204
Oh, man.

977
01:06:20,668 --> 01:06:24,463
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

978
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,215
Patience is a virtue.

979
01:06:30,135 --> 01:06:33,054

Carl.

999
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,583
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

1000
01:08:25,752 --> 01:08:27,836
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

1001
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:31,798
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

1002
01:08:31,966 --> 01:08:36,261
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

1003
01:08:37,305 --> 01:08:41,265
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

1004
01:08:41,434 --> 01:08:44,520
It's just a little life that
needed saving. No big deal.

1005
01:08:44,686 --> 01:08:47,189
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

1006
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,274
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

1007
01:08:49,442 --> 01:08:53,028
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

1008
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:56,489
Keeps it fresh. I'll see you guys.

1009
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:00,743
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

1010
01:09:00,912 --> 01:09:02,621
No.

1011
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:15,967
So I have some carry-on here.

1012
01:09:16,136 --> 01:09:20,555
I'd like two tickets on the
first plane out of here, please.

1013
01:09:20,722 --> 01:09:22,306
We've never done this before.

1014
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:29,523
The next flight available
for boarding...

1015
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,524
is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1016
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:34,528
Okay.

1017
01:09:34,695 --> 01:09:35,737
- Okay.
- Okay.

1018
01:09:35,904 --> 01:09:37,072
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

1019
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,407
Here we come.

1020
01:09:42,328 --> 01:09:44,537
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1021
01:09:44,706 --> 01:09:47,748
Well, clearly we should go there.

1022
01:09:53,547 --> 01:09:55,756
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets...

1023
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,592
weighed over 10 and a half pounds."

1024
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,137
- Hm. Interesting.
- Look at this.

1025
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,100
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

1026
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:06,976
Check out the phone.

1027
01:10:07,145 --> 01:10:10,689
Smaller than I thought they
would be. Hold on, I'm vibrating.

1028
01:10:10,856 --> 01:10:12,774
Hello?

1029
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:20,364
- Nice shot.
- Ha.

1030
01:10:20,658 --> 01:10:24,286
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

1031
01:10:25,162 --> 01:10:27,079
So, what do I do? I just...

1032
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,167
- Take it easy.
- Here you go.

1033
01:10:33,003 --> 01:10:35,046
- Okay.
- You got it.

1034
01:10:35,215 --> 01:10:36,256
Pull?

1035
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:40,176
- Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

1036
01:10:40,345 --> 01:10:43,262
Can I do it again? Can I
do it again? What's wrong?

1037
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,188
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it...

1038
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:55,650
for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.

1039
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,661
Twenty bucks says
Oklahoma kills them.

1040
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,372
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

1041
01:11:08,538 --> 01:11:10,164
What, do you live here now?

1042
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:13,961
Yeah. I asked Carl
and he had to say yes.

1043
01:11:14,127 --> 01:11:16,796
Hey. Is that Carl?

1044
01:11:16,965 --> 01:11:19,091
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

1045
01:11:20,467 --> 01:11:25,721
The energy is palpable here, Chris.
I can't even hear myself think.

1046
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,393
- I guess they're in Nebraska.
- Wow.

1047
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,520
Now, this is the
really interesting part.

1048
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:34,605
If you don't take
the heads off properly...

1049
01:11:34,774 --> 01:11:37,275
then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1050
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:40,444
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

1051
01:11:40,613 --> 01:11:43,364
and you got a lawsuit
on your hands.

1052
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,868
We got a fainter
down in Head Removal.

1053
01:11:51,873 --> 01:11:54,542
I can't believe
I tripped like that.

1054
01:11:55,002 --> 01:11:57,170
Huh. It seemed like you fainted.

1055
01:11:57,337 --> 01:11:59,463
No, I told you my
foot caught a nail.

1056
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:03,217
Okay. Because I thought it was all
the chicken beaks in the bucket.

1057
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:05,261
Don't, please.

1058
01:12:07,055 --> 01:12:09,390
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

1059
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:13,060
Here. I have to protect you.

1060
01:12:13,354 --> 01:12:14,854
Come on.

1061
01:12:15,023 --> 01:12:18,899
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1062
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,735
Come on.

1063
01:12:22,195 --> 01:12:25,782
Get in here. It's okay.
I got you.

1064
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:28,702
Allison, are you okay?

1065
01:12:29,369 --> 01:12:32,663
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?
You're okay?

1066
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:40,505
What?

1067
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:44,134
I don't know. I think I love you.

1068
01:12:45,552 --> 01:12:47,011
Really?

1069
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:51,766
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

1070
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:55,270
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

1071
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:57,146
I love you like...

1072
01:12:57,648 --> 01:13:00,942
I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

1073
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:03,235
I've been thinking...

1074
01:13:03,404 --> 01:13:05,905
and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

1075
01:13:06,073 --> 01:13:10,952
but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1076
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:15,623
Wow. Really?
You've been thinking that?

1077
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,751
What do you think?

1078
01:13:17,918 --> 01:13:22,338
- What do I think? Uh... Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

1079
01:13:22,506 --> 01:13:23,965
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

1080
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:26,134
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1081
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,929
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1082
01:13:29,096 --> 01:13:32,974
Come on, what are you talking
about? Here, ask me again.

1083
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,185
- Do you wanna move...?
- Yes.

1084
01:13:35,353 --> 01:13:39,855
Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you...

1085
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:58,291
- Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

1086
01:14:01,128 --> 01:14:03,921
I'll just be one minute.

1087
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:07,591
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1088
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,594
I'm in.

1089
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,596
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1090
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:16,935
Sir?

1091
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:21,273
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

1092
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,275
We just wanna ask you
a few questions.

1093
01:14:26,904 --> 01:14:29,655
You're hilarious.
Oh, that's great.

1094
01:14:29,823 --> 01:14:32,617
Oh, beautiful.
Are you in on this too?

1095
01:14:32,784 --> 01:14:34,953
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1096
01:14:35,121 --> 01:14:37,956
There's a crazy man in
the terminal. Whoo! Red alert.

1097
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,710
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

1098
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:43,502
Come on, lady.

1099
01:14:45,213 --> 01:14:48,507
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

1100
01:14:48,676 --> 01:14:52,845
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

1101
01:14:53,014 --> 01:14:54,972
Then why are you
plotting to attack it?

1102
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,141
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

1103
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:59,144
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

1104
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:01,479
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

1105
01:15:01,646 --> 01:15:03,189
We know what you're planning.

1106
01:15:03,356 --> 01:15:05,233
This is insane.
Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1107
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,235
Why did you purchase these
plane tickets at the last minute?

1108
01:15:08,404 --> 01:15:10,488
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1109
01:15:10,655 --> 01:15:12,573
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

1110
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:16,036
how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1111
01:15:16,203 --> 01:15:20,332
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder.com?

1112
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:23,585
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

1113
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,880
Faranoush. It was nothing.
I can explain. I can explain.

1114
01:15:27,047 --> 01:15:28,088
Explain this, jackhole.

1115
01:15:28,256 --> 01:15:30,800
As Chief Loan Officer at
Brea Federal Savings and Loan...

1116
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:33,511
you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

1117
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,180
- For what, bombs?
- No.

1118
01:15:35,347 --> 01:15:37,556
Have you recently
started taking flying lessons?

1119
01:15:37,725 --> 01:15:40,268
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

1120
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:42,811
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

1121
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:45,564
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

1122
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:47,859
- You were married?
- Yes.

1123
01:15:48,027 --> 01:15:51,029
Oh! That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

1124
01:15:51,197 --> 01:15:53,823
I was gonna tell her.
I just never...

1125
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:56,952
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

1126
01:15:58,078 --> 01:16:02,122
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1127
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:05,292
His name was Marx.

1128
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:11,216
I need to speak to my attorney.

1129
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:19,056
Several months ago, my client
attended a self-empowerment seminar...

1130
01:16:19,225 --> 01:16:24,061
that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1131
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:26,314
All of the activity
that appears suspicious...

1132
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:29,609
the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1133
01:16:29,777 --> 01:16:32,487
it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

1134
01:16:33,738 --> 01:16:35,990
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

1135
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,076
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

1136
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:39,828
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

1137
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:43,081
I'm wondering if there's a better
setting for this back-and-forth.

1138
01:16:43,248 --> 01:16:46,208
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

1139
01:16:49,005 --> 01:16:52,172
- Whew. That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

1140
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,341
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

1141
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:57,345
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1142
01:16:57,887 --> 01:16:59,930
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

1143
01:17:00,099 --> 01:17:03,851
I thought you lied all the time, but
it's just sometimes. That's excellent.

1144
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,729
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

1145
01:17:05,895 --> 01:17:09,274
you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1146
01:17:09,442 --> 01:17:11,275
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

1147
01:17:11,444 --> 01:17:13,444
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

1148
01:17:13,613 --> 01:17:16,030
that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

1149
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,867
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

1150
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,368
like an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

1151
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:22,703
You paused.

1152
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:25,539
You wanted to say no but you
couldn't. You had to say yes.

1153
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:29,877
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

1154
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:34,215
was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

1155
01:17:41,849 --> 01:17:43,099
Allison.

1156
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,269
Bye, Carl.

1157
01:18:00,533 --> 01:18:04,703
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1158
01:18:04,872 --> 01:18:06,456
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

1159
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:09,833
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

1160
01:18:10,002 --> 01:18:12,002
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

1161
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:15,131
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

1162
01:18:15,298 --> 01:18:16,925
Ever think things got screwed up...

1163
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,970
because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

1164
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:23,097
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1165
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:25,766
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

1166
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:29,479
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

1167
01:18:29,646 --> 01:18:31,105
a.k.a. what normal people do.

1168
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:34,067
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1169
01:18:34,234 --> 01:18:35,359
Or not.

1170
01:18:35,528 --> 01:18:37,444
Allison, please,
can't we talk for a sec?

1171
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:39,113
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

1172
01:18:39,907 --> 01:18:41,240
- Farther.
- Yeah.

1173
01:18:43,202 --> 01:18:44,618
Carl.

1174
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:49,957
Bye, Carl.

1175
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:53,627
- Oh, I just love good food.
- So do I.

1176
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:55,630
- Do you?
- Uh-huh.

1177
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,756
You know you and
I are a lot alike?

1178
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,301
My mother likes good food.

1179
01:19:02,179 --> 01:19:04,805
She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food...

1180
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:06,932
than bad food any old day
of the week."

1181
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,643
Hey.

1182
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:10,811
It's me again.

1183
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:13,480
Specifically I'm talking
about 15 to 20 percent.

1184
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:16,609
The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the...

1185
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:35,336
Okay, I'm totally
off the controls.

1186
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:38,840
You're officially
flying by yourself.

1187
01:19:40,426 --> 01:19:41,926
Cool.

1188
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:45,387
There's no greater feeling
in the world, is there?

1189
01:19:48,641 --> 01:19:54,104
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1190
01:19:54,273 --> 01:19:56,106
I'd like to thank you
all for coming...

1191
01:19:56,274 --> 01:19:59,402
for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

1192
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:03,238
In an unrelated note, everyone
else can go jump off a bridge.

1193
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:17,002
Aah!

1194
01:20:34,688 --> 01:20:35,854
Allison?

1195
01:20:36,023 --> 01:20:40,150
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1196
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:45,405
- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
- Okay, okay. Just checking in.

1197
01:20:45,573 --> 01:20:47,408
Seeing how Corporate's
treating you.

1198
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,786
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

1199
01:20:49,953 --> 01:20:51,412
I never really
thought of them as...

1200
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:53,872
Hang on, hang on, hang on,
just a second.

1201
01:20:56,252 --> 01:20:59,378
Wes? Can you hear me?

1202
01:20:59,546 --> 01:21:00,796
Go get the ball!

1203
01:21:00,965 --> 01:21:02,715
So, listen, I got a job for you.

1204
01:21:02,882 --> 01:21:04,551
We're shutting down
a bunch of branches...

1205
01:21:04,717 --> 01:21:07,761
- and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

1206
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,390
- Mm-hm.
- Which ones?

1207
01:21:12,059 --> 01:21:14,685
We are Sparta!

1208
01:21:18,439 --> 01:21:19,858
Hi, Norm.

1209
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,382
You have three messages.

1210
01:21:45,551 --> 01:21:48,302
Hi, Car, this is your
answer phone speaking.

1211
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:51,305
No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder
about the party tonight.

1212
01:21:51,472 --> 01:21:54,559
I'll see you there,
buddy. Roger, out.

1213
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:57,770
Carl, it's Roons. Thanks for
letting me use your car.

1214
01:21:57,938 --> 01:22:00,480
You might notice the front
bumper missing. Not to worry.

1215
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,443
I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing's being handled.

1216
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:07,988
And I left a pile of laundry in my room.
Don't forget, no starch. Love you.

1217
01:22:08,573 --> 01:22:11,618
It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it...

1218
01:22:11,784 --> 01:22:15,537
but just wanted to make sure Lucy's
shower is still on for tomorrow night.

1219
01:22:15,706 --> 01:22:18,832
Haven't received confirmation
of any sort from you. At all.

1220
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,668
- Shower. Shit.
- It's on.

1221
01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:23,837
Right? Call me.

1222
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,393
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1223
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,104
- What's wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

1224
01:22:40,271 --> 01:22:41,521
What?

1225
01:22:41,689 --> 01:22:44,359
Come on inside.
I'll explain everything.

1226
01:22:49,614 --> 01:22:51,865
Surprise!

1227
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,661
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

1228
01:22:54,828 --> 01:22:56,287
How did you pull this off?

1229
01:22:56,454 --> 01:22:59,122
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

1230
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:02,167
I like it, I like it.

1231
01:23:02,336 --> 01:23:03,752
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

1232
01:23:03,921 --> 01:23:06,046
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

1233
01:23:06,215 --> 01:23:08,382
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

1234
01:23:08,841 --> 01:23:11,677
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1235
01:23:11,845 --> 01:23:14,346
On him, on him.

1236
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,393
Cake?

1237
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,601
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1238
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:24,148
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1239
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,735
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1240
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:39,162
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1241
01:23:39,331 --> 01:23:42,166
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

1242
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:45,211
You know, taking her day by day.

1243
01:23:45,378 --> 01:23:48,213
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1244
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:49,756
Oh.

1245
01:23:54,137 --> 01:23:58,599
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

1246
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:04,814
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

1247
01:24:04,981 --> 01:24:06,024
Do you dance?

1248
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:09,109
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1249
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:12,822
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

1250
01:24:39,099 --> 01:24:44,729
- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so...

1251
01:24:49,025 --> 01:24:50,902
Oh, jeez.

1252
01:24:51,487 --> 01:24:53,613
That's the best
wedding shower ever, man.

1253
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:54,822
Man, you deserve it.

1254
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:56,948
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1255
01:24:57,117 --> 01:25:00,203
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

1256
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:02,913
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1257
01:25:03,082 --> 01:25:07,167
I guess I'll just stick with the
program. Keep saying "Yes" to everything.

1258
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:08,920
I know it sounds silly...

1259
01:25:09,087 --> 01:25:11,671
but maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1260
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,135
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

1261
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,429
You wanna get dinner
tomorrow night?

1262
01:25:18,596 --> 01:25:21,599
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

1263
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:24,393
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1264
01:25:25,354 --> 01:25:28,064
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

1265
01:25:28,231 --> 01:25:30,690
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

1266
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,859
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1267
01:25:38,324 --> 01:25:40,201
Hi there.

1268
01:25:41,161 --> 01:25:42,787
Hello there.

1269
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:46,541
You must be Tillie.

1270
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:52,546
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

1271
01:25:56,051 --> 01:26:02,180
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1272
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:05,309
Come on, let's go.

1273
01:26:15,154 --> 01:26:17,738
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

1274
01:26:18,364 --> 01:26:24,244
- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
- Can you come over?

1275
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:27,247
We had this big fight
and he stormed off.

1276
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:31,293
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1277
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:33,212
I don't know.

1278
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:38,091
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

1279
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:41,929
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

1280
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:46,350
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

1281
01:26:46,518 --> 01:26:50,854
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1282
01:26:51,023 --> 01:26:57,278
Yeah. I'm gonna assume
at this point, it's, well...

1283
01:26:57,445 --> 01:27:00,448
- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph...

1284
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:06,996
Steph...

1285
01:27:07,663 --> 01:27:09,497
I can't.

1286
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:11,833
I'm sorry.

1287
01:27:14,337 --> 01:27:16,296
What are you saying?

1288
01:27:17,925 --> 01:27:20,134
I'm saying no.

1289
01:27:36,609 --> 01:27:38,069
Are you serious?

1290
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:53,626
Oh, Jesus.

1291
01:28:01,092 --> 01:28:03,636
Oh, please.

1292
01:28:04,136 --> 01:28:07,765
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

1293
01:28:07,932 --> 01:28:09,600
Sorry, pal. Can't help you.

1294
01:28:09,768 --> 01:28:12,019
Oh, come on.
Can't you give me a break?

1295
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:16,023
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1296
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:20,360
- No man, no man, no man...
- Not possible!

1297
01:28:22,613 --> 01:28:24,739
Jackoff.

1298
01:28:25,826 --> 01:28:27,993
Chapter 26:

1299
01:28:28,161 --> 01:28:31,372
"Words That Rhyme With Yes."

1300
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:34,166
Guess, mess.

1301
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:40,381
Tess, that's a name.
Less, a word and a name.

1302
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:42,507
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

1303
01:29:07,158 --> 01:29:09,909
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

1304
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:15,041
She was coming in the room. It's
like, "Give me some space, woman."

1305
01:29:15,207 --> 01:29:18,752
Again, I'm pretty sure she was
just here checking on Carl.

1306
01:29:19,046 --> 01:29:20,962
Peter.

1307
01:29:21,715 --> 01:29:23,381
A covenant.

1308
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:25,842
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1309
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:29,430
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

1310
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:33,100
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

1311
01:29:33,268 --> 01:29:34,769
It is nonsense.

1312
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:38,104
It's him.

1313
01:29:39,608 --> 01:29:43,903
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

1314
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:46,863
First of all, what were you doing
in my car?

1315
01:29:47,032 --> 01:29:49,449
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

1316
01:29:49,618 --> 01:29:53,453
There is no covenant. There
never was. I was just riffing.

1317
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:56,748
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

1318
01:29:56,917 --> 01:30:00,586
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1319
01:30:00,753 --> 01:30:03,713
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

1320
01:30:03,881 --> 01:30:05,966
You just don't know how
to use it, that's all.

1321
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:09,052
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1322
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,180
No, that's not the point.

1323
01:30:11,347 --> 01:30:15,141
Well, maybe at first it is, but
that's just to open you up to it...

1324
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,976
to get you started.

1325
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:19,771
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

1326
01:30:19,939 --> 01:30:22,358
not because
a covenant tells you to...

1327
01:30:22,525 --> 01:30:25,485
but because you know in
your heart that you want to.

1328
01:30:26,738 --> 01:30:28,405
Yeah.

1329
01:30:28,989 --> 01:30:30,698
You're right.

1330
01:30:31,451 --> 01:30:34,328
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

1331
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:35,912
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

1332
01:30:36,081 --> 01:30:38,666
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

1333
01:30:39,251 --> 01:30:43,337
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about
the car, and your head there.

1334
01:30:44,131 --> 01:30:48,007
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

1335
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:49,426
Perfect.

1336
01:30:52,221 --> 01:30:54,014
I said that.

1337
01:30:54,181 --> 01:30:55,850
Whatever.

1338
01:30:57,685 --> 01:31:01,229
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

1339
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:07,987
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

1340
01:31:08,154 --> 01:31:10,488
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1341
01:31:13,033 --> 01:31:17,037
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

1342
01:31:17,204 --> 01:31:21,542
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

1343
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:26,171
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1344
01:31:26,797 --> 01:31:28,923
Ducati.

1345
01:31:33,889 --> 01:31:37,307
Have you ever driven one of these
before? They're quite powerful.

1346
01:31:37,475 --> 01:31:40,685
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1347
01:31:40,854 --> 01:31:43,189
No, Carl, this is not the same.

1348
01:31:43,355 --> 01:31:46,358
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

1349
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:49,319
Holy Jesus.

1350
01:31:49,488 --> 01:31:50,738
― torque.

1351
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:05,252
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

1352
01:32:07,087 --> 01:32:08,338
Aah!

1353
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,673
You might wanna get
out of the way.

1354
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:24,354
- Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

1355
01:32:27,442 --> 01:32:28,484
Aah!

1356
01:32:32,363 --> 01:32:33,780
Whoa!

1357
01:33:18,201 --> 01:33:19,993
What an asshole.

1358
01:33:36,176 --> 01:33:37,761
Carl, what are you doing here?

1359
01:33:37,929 --> 01:33:41,849
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't wanna live with you.

1360
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,101
Oh, wow. Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

1361
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:47,770
Okay, people, let's go.

1362
01:33:51,318 --> 01:33:52,400
But I wanna be with you.

1363
01:33:52,569 --> 01:33:54,778
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't know you.

1364
01:33:54,945 --> 01:33:57,530
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1365
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:00,033
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's big.

1366
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:02,786
We shouldn't just jump
into that without thinking.

1367
01:34:02,953 --> 01:34:04,496
Why not? You do
it with everything.

1368
01:34:04,663 --> 01:34:06,914
You say yes to whatever
comes your way.

1369
01:34:07,082 --> 01:34:10,043
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

1370
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:12,755
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you
get that? Your literature?

1371
01:34:12,921 --> 01:34:14,922
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1372
01:34:15,091 --> 01:34:18,886
You think? Hmm.
Seems pretty airtight to me.

1373
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:22,014
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

1374
01:34:22,181 --> 01:34:25,266
Because the old Carl didn't
think he was enough for anybody.

1375
01:34:25,435 --> 01:34:28,479
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

1376
01:34:28,646 --> 01:34:30,980
sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1377
01:34:31,524 --> 01:34:33,984
I didn't think
I had anything to share.

1378
01:34:34,152 --> 01:34:37,363
Now I know that what I have to share
is huge, and I wanna share it with you.

1379
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:40,908
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

1380
01:34:41,076 --> 01:34:43,077
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1381
01:34:43,703 --> 01:34:46,162
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

1382
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:49,667
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

1383
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:52,920
and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1384
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:55,005
You weren't scared of anything.

1385
01:34:55,172 --> 01:34:57,841
You don't think
I'm scared of anything?

1386
01:34:58,009 --> 01:35:01,177
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1387
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:03,764
And I'm scared too.

1388
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:06,015
So let's be scared together.

1389
01:35:07,935 --> 01:35:09,936
I don't know what
you want me to say.

1390
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:12,064
So just say yes...

1391
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:15,024
but only if you really want to.

1392
01:35:15,275 --> 01:35:18,404
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

1393
01:35:19,698 --> 01:35:21,532
Yeah, I noticed that.

1394
01:35:22,074 --> 01:35:23,449
Well?

1395
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,458
- Maybe.
- Come on.

1396
01:35:33,336 --> 01:35:36,963
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

1397
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:45,596
I like maybe.

1398
01:35:45,765 --> 01:35:46,974
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

1399
01:36:13,877 --> 01:36:17,337
Excuse me, but pleats
are kind of out of style.

1400
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:19,672
You got anything
with a flat front?

1401
01:36:19,841 --> 01:36:21,800
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

1402
01:36:24,429 --> 01:36:25,845
Thanks, guys.

1403
01:36:26,014 --> 01:36:28,640
This is the single biggest
donation that we've ever had.

1404
01:36:28,807 --> 01:36:31,350
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1405
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:32,895
You're a good man, Carl.

1406
01:36:33,061 --> 01:36:37,608
No big deal. I know a lot of
people who are willing to give.

1407
01:36:39,068 --> 01:36:44,405
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

1408
01:36:44,573 --> 01:36:49,036
And the word you will have
said 2 million times is:

1409
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:51,537
Yes!

1410
01:36:57,002 --> 01:36:59,171
Good God.

1411
01:38:33,265 --> 01:38:35,391
So anything else we need to know?

1412
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:39,813
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

1413
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,564
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

1414
01:38:41,733 --> 01:38:43,108
Right.

1415
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:45,694
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1416
01:38:45,862 --> 01:38:48,572
I never could have finished
the suits without it.

1417
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,576
Listen, I'm not gonna
think anything less of you...

1418
01:38:52,743 --> 01:38:54,828
- if you don't wanna do this.
- What?

1419
01:38:54,996 --> 01:38:58,122
I mean, I'm still gonna be
attracted to you if you're a chicken.

1420
01:38:58,291 --> 01:39:00,125
What if I'm one of
those chickens...

1421
01:39:00,292 --> 01:39:03,420
whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1422
01:39:03,587 --> 01:39:06,506
I'll see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

1423
01:39:07,257 --> 01:39:10,260
I told you, my foot caught a nail.

1424
01:39:10,427 --> 01:39:11,677
Hiyah!

1425
01:39:58,518 --> 01:40:00,060
I love this.
