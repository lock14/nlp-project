1
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:45,832
<i>I'm just a penny on the train track</i>

2
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,502
<i>Waiting for my judgment day</i>

3
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:52,256
<i>Come on, baby girl,
let me see those legs</i>

4
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:55,050
<i>Before I get
flattened away</i>

5
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:57,260
<i>I wait</i>

6
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,889
<i>Yeah, I wait</i>

7
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:07,104
<i>For something good,
for something great</i>

8
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:12,567
<i>Stopping in somebody's old home town</i>

9
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:15,737
<i>Gotta get that midnight meal</i>

10
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:19,366
<i>If you can't get behind your own life</i>

11
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:22,369
<i>Get behind the driving wheel</i>

12
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:27,457
<i>And go, just go</i>

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,131
<i>Find a place that you don't know</i>

14
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:39,636
<i>Ran into a friend just the other night</i>

15
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:42,264
<i>Got a badge, he's a local cop</i>

16
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:46,309
<i>Haven't seen that boy in over seven years</i>

17
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:49,312
<i>Since out of high school I dropped</i>

18
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:55,026
<i>I see, I see</i>

19
00:01:56,987 --> 00:02:01,742
<i>All the things that I should be</i>

20
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,641
<i>I wait</i>

21
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:28,226
<i>Yeah, I wait</i>

22
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:34,816
<i>For something good, for something great</i>

23
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:39,404
<i>Dude! You're totally missing it!</i>

24
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:43,033
<i>It's fucking crazy here, man! Dude! Kev.</i>

25
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:45,368
<i>I've got an idea.
I want you to drop what you are doing.</i>

26
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:49,998
<i>I want you to come down here
and take a picture of this for the paper!</i>

27
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:53,877
<i> Now that, my friend,
is front page material. Lateski.</i>

28
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:01,134
Hey, Mom!
Gina, Morris and I are gonna leave

29
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:03,053
for Fieldmont right after school today.

30
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:06,348
Honey, I completely forgot about that.
Can you do it next weekend?

31
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:10,143
Derek was gonna take me into the city
tomorrow night for dinner.

32
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:12,354
- God! It's already 7:00?
- We can't.

33
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:15,023
Morris has a scholarship meeting
and we're signed up for the campus tour.

34
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:17,400
- Carter.
- Hi. What's up Ms. B?

35
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:23,448
Dude, she totally threw off my groove!
I was almost at the top level.

36
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:25,325
- Hey, Carter.
- What's up, man?

37
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:27,452
What's up, little people?

38
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:31,414
Running a little bit low.

39
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,375
Kev! Can I ask you a question?

40
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,503
You know that book that Miss Dangle
makes everybody read about the mice?

41
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:39,756
<i>- You mean Of Mice and Men?
- Bingo! That's the one, yeah.</i>

42
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:41,341
So let me get this straight.

43
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:45,845
These two dudes dream of buying
a farm together to raise rabbits?

44
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:48,056
Hmm.

45
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,768
And I'm no expert,
but doesn't that seem a little...

46
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:55,897
I don't know. Kind of G-A-Y?

47
00:03:56,314 --> 00:03:57,774
Dude, I think
you're kind of missing the point.

48
00:03:57,857 --> 00:04:00,777
- We can spell, Carter.
- Yeah, dumb A-S-S.

49
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,530
Dude. Satan's children, I swear.
Spawn of Satan.

50
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:11,454
Right. Come on, guys!
Mrs. Seavers is here. Let's go!

51
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,666
Grab your backpacks.

52
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:23,341
Oh, yeah!

53
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:24,801
All right, see you guys!

54
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:37,480
Would you look at this guy?
Why do we have to hang out with him?

55
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:38,940
- Hey, Morris.
- Hey, guys.

56
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:41,609
Hey, Morris,
what's up with all the geek books?

57
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:43,611
I've got a scholarship interview
in a day, Carter.

58
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:45,780
And my parents are up my ass about it.

59
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,949
Morris, your parents
are always up your ass.

60
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,702
Besides, don't you want to go to some
fancy-shmancy Ivy League school?

61
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:52,787
Guys, come on!
Do we really have to start this early?

62
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,622
Well, apparently,
it's not my choice, Carter.

63
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:56,624
At least Kevin will be there. Right, Kev?

64
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,502
Yep. Hey, did you grab your stuff
so we can split right after school today?

65
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:01,379
Yeah. It's in my...

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,015
Yeah, the technique was a little off,
but the timing was better.

67
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:13,349
And by the way, she's easy,

68
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:17,312
but not in the, like,
I'm-gonna-fuck-Morris kind of way easy.

69
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,564
Come on, Kev, I've got to pee.
I need you to shake it.

70
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:20,774
Carter.

71
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,280
You sure you don't wanna
come with us this weekend, man?

72
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:29,491
What? There's no reason for him to come.

73
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:33,828
You know what, Morris? I think, for the
first time, you and I are on the same page.

74
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:36,247
I don't know.
Campus tours and scholarship interviews,

75
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:37,832
sounds like a real blastie-blast.

76
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,169
But I think
I'd rather sock myself in the nuts.

77
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,545
I mean, seriously, look at this thing.

78
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:45,548
Like, where are all the hotties, you know?
Show some skin.

79
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:47,050
- Hey.
- Hey!

80
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:50,053
- Hey, Gina.
- Hey, Gina.

81
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:53,515
Kevin, really, just...
Listen, don't take this the wrong way.

82
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:56,643
But I need to talk to
your friend outside, alone.

83
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,394
Nice!
Does that mean you're gonna

84
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,022
blow him underneath the bleachers?

85
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,400
Yeah. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

86
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,195
Awesome! You kids have fun! High five!

87
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,658
I got my high five, dude.

88
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:13,159
Does he give you a high five like that?

89
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:14,744
See you...

90
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,121
Here's your brochure, though.
Have a good weekend.

91
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,124
Miami?

92
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,712
- When did you apply there?
- A couple months ago.

93
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:26,381
What about us?

94
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:28,174
I mean, what about our plans to
go to Fieldmont together?

95
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:30,552
And the campus tour this weekend?

96
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:32,470
Just go without me.

97
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:37,475
Look, it's senior year.

98
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:43,398
It's, like, so exciting,
and I wanna party, and I wanna have fun.

99
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:47,277
And you're, like, not fun.

100
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:53,700
Like, so what? So I don't drink very
much, you know. We still have fun.

101
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:55,576
Like our Friday nights at mini golf.

102
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,995
Yeah, they're kind of boring.

103
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,747
Our camping trips, the school carnival,
studying together?

104
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:02,917
Standing around while you're
taking pictures of everything?

105
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,961
- Thrilling!
- Gina...

106
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:06,462
When we were freshmen, it was one thing.

107
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:11,050
But this is our time to really go crazy!
We're supposed to be partying.

108
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:14,304
And you, you're just... You're a loser!

109
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:18,725
Kevin, it's over.

110
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:23,938
College is just around the corner,
and I can't let you ruin my senior year.

111
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,026
That's mine.

112
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:30,820
<i>Okay, so let me get this straight.</i>

113
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:34,699
You didn't get blown under the bleachers?

114
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:38,328
No! Dude, have you been listening to me?
She dumped me!

115
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,455
I was dumped once.

116
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:42,415
Morris, you're such a fucking liar, dude.

117
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:45,293
- You've never even had a girlfriend.
- Shut up, Carter. Yes, I did.

118
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:47,336
Remember, Kev?
You introduced me to her.

119
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,588
- Right.
- She was real.

120
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:52,258
- We went to physics camp together.
- Maybe more like fantasy camp.

121
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,719
Come on, you guys. Do you mind?
I'm having a breakdown here.

122
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:56,179
What am I supposed to do now?

123
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:58,598
It was all set.
First, we'd go to college together,

124
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,934
and then we'd get married,
have a couple kids, one girl, one boy.

125
00:08:02,018 --> 00:08:05,563
Dude, is that the kind of shit
you would say to Gina?

126
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,649
God! No wonder she dumped your ass.
You're fucking lame.

127
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:12,070
- What's up, fellows?
- What's up, Fletcher?

128
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:14,280
What's up with Negative Nancy over here?

129
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,240
Gina dumped him.
He's having a breakdown.

130
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:20,203
Cool. So are you guys going on some sort
of road trip to Fieldmont this weekend?

131
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:22,622
- I don't think I'm going anymore.
- That's too bad.

132
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:25,249
I just went there last weekend
to visit my bro.

133
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:26,417
I almost didn't make it back.

134
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:29,295
"Almost didn't make it back"?
Dude, it's just college.

135
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,631
Yeah, yeah, just college.
Yeah, see, that's what I thought, too.

136
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:34,175
And then I went,
and I'm telling you guys right now,

137
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,595
it is fucking nuts, man. It's retarded.

138
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:40,223
Why? What happened?

139
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,350
You guys want to know?

140
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,311
Basically, this is how it went down.

141
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,979
I didn't sleep for three days, okay?

142
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,439
I don't have any money left
in my bank account.

143
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:49,690
I maxed out my parents' credit card,

144
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,859
which was only supposed
to be used in case of an emergency.

145
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:54,028
I lost my cell phone,
which is actually my dad's cell phone.

146
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:55,738
So he's pissed about that
and the credit card.

147
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:58,991
I tried smoking a tampon,
which I thought was a big fat joint.

148
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,828
Still got high. Stole a car,
got in a bar fight, ate some goldfish.

149
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,455
Played naked Frisbee, did some whip-its,
wet my brother's bed twice.

150
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,540
Shit my pants, once,

151
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08,251
but please don't tell anyone,
'cause I'm kind of embarrassed about that.

152
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:12,088
Saw two girls make out.
With tongue! With tongue!

153
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:14,507
Watched my brother's roommates
eat as many cheeseburgers as they could

154
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,591
until one of them puked.

155
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:17,593
Found a tattoo on my lower back
of a unicorn.

156
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:18,719
Don't remember getting that.

157
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,763
Figure I'll just tell people
it's some sort of killer unicorn.

158
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:22,056
You know? So it doesn't seem so gay.

159
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,725
I laughed. I cried. Fell in love.

160
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:28,771
Yeah, and did I mention earlier
that I got laid?

161
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:31,732
Three times. Different girls, yeah.

162
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:35,903
So all in all, I'd say it was pretty much
the best weekend of my fucking life.

163
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,196
Yeah.

164
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,907
Dude, you should go.

165
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:45,538
What if I could have a weekend like that,
a weekend like Fletcher's?

166
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:49,041
How? No way.
Who knows if he's even telling the truth?

167
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,252
Come on, man. What if he was?
You heard him.

168
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:56,215
All the craziness, the partying, the sex,
the drinking, it sounds incredible.

169
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,427
You know, maybe I'll even get a tattoo.

170
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,263
Wait, you're joking, right?

171
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:07,226
You got me, Kev. That's a good one.
Partying, drinking, sex. Up top.

172
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,272
I'm not kidding, Morris.
You know, maybe Gina's right, I'm no fun.

173
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,733
A weekend like Fletcher's
is exactly what I need.

174
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:17,737
Kev, having some crazy weekend
to get back at Gina is a really bad idea.

175
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,823
Or a really good idea,
and I say go for it.

176
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,369
Bitch.

177
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:27,246
You know what? I'm gonna go for it.

178
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,206
In fact, I'm gonna have a better weekend
than Fletcher.

179
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:30,458
Yes!

180
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:34,462
Dude, I am so going.

181
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:37,840
<i>I gotta move</i>

182
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:42,011
<i>While the streets ahead are sunny</i>

183
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:47,350
<i>Fall in love with some honey
Oh, mama</i>

184
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:51,187
<i>I gotta move</i>

185
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:57,902
<i>It's time I broke out into the open</i>

186
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:00,780
<i>You know I'll settle down again some day</i>

187
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:03,366
Dude, this is definitely better
than the brochure!

188
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:05,242
Yeah, man,
I've got a good feeling about this.

189
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:06,452
Good feeling? What kind of good feeling?

190
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,370
Like your-boy-Carter's-gonna-get-laid
kind of feeling?

191
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,915
'Cause I have that feeling too, and I love it!

192
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,459
I don't know, man, just everything.
I'm ready to have fun.

193
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,087
Yeah, man, good!
Positive vibes. Positive vibes.

194
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:20,633
Okay, Kev, it says here that the campus
tour is at 12:30 tomorrow afternoon.

195
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:24,804
And there's a pre-frosh reception tonight
before dinner in the main...

196
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:27,306
Okay, that's enough!
That is enough. No more.

197
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,432
That's our schedule for the weekend!

198
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:32,019
Dude, Morris, fuck schedules, man!
We're in college now.

199
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:33,896
You know what that means?

200
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:37,733
No parents! No curfew! Free fucking beer!

201
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:40,736
It does not get any better than this!

202
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:44,532
Except for that.
Dude, slow down, slow down.

203
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:46,700
Hey, what's up, ladies?
You on your way to class?

204
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:49,203
No. We just like carrying all these books
around for fun.

205
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:53,249
Right!
A girl's got to read, huh? Awesome.

206
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:56,252
So, look, we're in town for the weekend,
and we were just kind of wondering

207
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:58,671
if you guys could, I mean, I don't know,
show us around?

208
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:01,090
New guys, huh?
What college are you visiting from?

209
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:03,592
No, no, see, we're not in college.

210
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:07,137
- We're actually still in high school.
- What the fuck?

211
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:08,389
- I hate you so much!
- Stop it!

212
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,057
You're crushing my testicles!

213
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,685
- What my friend meant to say was...
- Fuck off!

214
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:15,563
All righty then. I'll see you guys later.

215
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:18,899
Hey, green shirt, if I give you $5 right now,

216
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:21,735
would you fart in a can
and let me just keep it in my bedroom?

217
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:23,612
I'll never open it! I promise.

218
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:29,785
These dorms are whack.
Why do we have to stay here?

219
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,203
You don't have to, Carter.

220
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:34,290
This is where the admissions board
put me and Kevin.

221
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:37,376
Look, I got a cousin who's a legacy
in one of the fraternities.

222
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,378
I'm sure if we go there, they'll hook us up.

223
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:42,339
- Yeah, my parents would love that.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:46,677
Enough, you guys! Look, I don't see
what's so bad about this, Carter.

225
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,144
- What?
- God!

226
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,189
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

227
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:00,441
I'm Morris.

228
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:04,486
I'm Kevin, Kevin Brewer,
prospective freshman.

229
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:07,114
We're supposed to be staying in your room
this weekend.

230
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,657
Right.

231
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:13,996
Look, fellows, I'm gonna need about
20, 30 minutes to finish up here, okay?

232
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,248
So just come back later.

233
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:21,920
Probably just working out.

234
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:24,882
Yeah, he's just working out one of these.

235
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,429
- Disgusting!
- How's that frat house sound, guys?

236
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:31,639
Pretty good? Awesome.

237
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:39,772
Okay, dude, do you actually know
where you're going?

238
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:42,941
Dude, relax! It's right up here, I think.

239
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,902
All right, dude, I'm not perfect, all right?

240
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:46,653
All these Greek letters
look the same to me.

241
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,364
Maybe we should go back
and try the dorm again.

242
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,991
You shut your mouth! Shut your mouth!

243
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:52,326
Or not. That's cool, too.

244
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:02,461
Holy shit. Those chicks
definitely weren't in the brochure.

245
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,171
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

246
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,132
- What's up, college girls?
- Ladies.

247
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:09,843
- I'm Morris.
- Hi, Morris.

248
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:14,390
- She said my name.
- Chicks are smoking hot! Yeah.

249
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:20,145
"Chicks are smoking hot"?
Come on, real smooth, Carter.

250
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:24,066
Yeah. Smooth.

251
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:25,692
Whatever! All you got out was your name.

252
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:27,361
Which she repeated back to me,
I'd like to note.

253
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:28,445
Shut up.

254
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,701
Jesus!

255
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,954
- Nut shot.
- Ten points!

256
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,372
Get some.

257
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,749
Shitty news, dudes.

258
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,546
Dean Chandler has denied our petition,
and we're still on probation.

259
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:46,797
Shit!

260
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:50,884
I guess he's taking that whole
singing thing pretty seriously.

261
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,845
Looking good, Goose.

262
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:56,348
Looks like we got another semester
without any pledges.

263
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,308
This fucking blows, man!

264
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,937
What's the point of college
if you can't have pledges?

265
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:03,230
Shit!

266
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,608
Fuck!

267
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,486
Fuck!

268
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,490
Son of a...

269
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:19,037
That's it.
This just might be the year to graduate.

270
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:20,247
- What?
- What?

271
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,165
- No.
- Yeah, I didn't think it'd come so soon.

272
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,918
You can't graduate. You're Bearcat.

273
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:27,004
- You're an institution.
- I know.

274
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,089
I'm scared to graduate.

275
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:32,426
It seems like torturing pledges,
that's all I'm good at.

276
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:34,803
That's not true, and you know that.

277
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:39,182
You're good at a lot of things.
Cooper, tell him what he's good at.

278
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:44,062
Like... Like the keg toss.

279
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:47,274
And you take the biggest dumps
in the house. Right?

280
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:51,111
Yeah. Nobody beats you at that.
It's like a real gift.

281
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:54,740
It is, isn't it?
Thanks, guys. I feel a lot better.

282
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:57,784
- Hang in there, big guy.
- You're all right.

283
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,453
Hang in there.

284
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,294
We'll figure this whole pledge thing out,
I promise.

285
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:22,476
Hey, man, is this the Beta Phi house?

286
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,811
What? You can't read Greek?

287
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:26,980
My cousin is a legacy here.

288
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:29,399
- Yeah? Who's your cousin?
- Toby Scott.

289
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:31,068
You mean Queef?

290
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:34,112
- What?
- Queef.

291
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:37,366
- What's a queef?
- A pussy fart.

292
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:39,701
It's his pledge name.

293
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:42,329
- Who'd want that name?
- Yeah, he earned it.

294
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:47,250
I'd like to help you guys out, with you
being his cousin and everything, but...

295
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,003
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

296
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:52,673
Come on, man.
Look, we're in high school, you know?

297
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:55,842
We're just up here to party, you know?
Is that too much to ask?

298
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:59,346
You guys are a bunch of high school kids?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,640
No, okay? Go try the dorms.

300
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:07,687
- A legacy, dude?
- Yeah, he's... I...

301
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:10,857
I can't believe they call Toby "Queef."
Toby kicks ass.

302
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,028
What did those guys want?

303
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:19,366
A couple of high school kids
looking to crash here for the weekend.

304
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,327
One of them was Queef's cousin.
Remember him?

305
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:26,623
God, that guy could toss a salad.
That thing he did with his tongue?

306
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:29,793
Sorry. That guy's a loser.

307
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:33,046
So, they're looking
for a place to crash, huh?

308
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:37,759
- Maybe we should let them stay.
- What, are you serious?

309
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:38,885
What the hell
are we gonna do with a bunch

310
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,930
of fucking high school kids
here all weekend?

311
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:47,018
Brothers.
- Do it, man!

312
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,521
- Listen up.
- Boner.

313
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,690
Goose, shut the fuck up.

314
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:56,611
These guys. What's your names?

315
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:59,030
I'm Kevin, and this is Morris and Carter.

316
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:01,741
Okay, whatever. These guys are
our guests for the weekend.

317
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:06,079
Well, see, technically,
we're supposed to stay in the dorms,

318
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:08,206
but our roommate's a little...

319
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,583
Technically, you're a fag!
...preoccupied.

320
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,126
Yeah, he's jerking off.

321
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:13,920
Pussy! Fuck hole!
Did we say you could talk?

322
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:17,841
Bearcat! Relax, big man.
They didn't mean anything by it.

323
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,637
Sorry. He's got anger management issues.

324
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,639
How about I show you guys
where you are staying?

325
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:26,141
Put your stuff away?

326
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:27,934
- Morris, do you like the sound of that?
- Party!

327
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,270
Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

328
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:32,439
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

329
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,566
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

330
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:36,443
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

331
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:38,528
What's up, shit face?

332
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,489
This is usually
where we let our pledges stay.

333
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:46,620
We call this room the dungeon,
but don't let the name scare you.

334
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:50,040
You're gonna love it.

335
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,255
Watch the step.

336
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:16,524
Yeah, this place fucking sucks.

337
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,985
Dude, it beats some guy jerking, all right?

338
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:22,405
Like we said, all of our guest rooms
are taken tonight.

339
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,617
Yeah. We feel really bad
about having to put you guys down here.

340
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,245
- Is that a rat?
- A rat? No. Probably just a shadow.

341
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,955
And don't you guys worry.

342
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,958
We're gonna give you the 411
on all the great parties this weekend.

343
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:38,463
In fact, I think that the Lambdas
are having a kegger tonight.

344
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:41,049
Keggers? We love keggers.
Right, Kev? Keggers, keggers!

345
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:42,550
We are all about keggers.

346
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:45,970
Cool. Well, you guys
are gonna love the Lambdas.

347
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,103
Bearcat!

348
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:57,524
- What the fuck is up with that...
- Are you talking?

349
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:01,194
- No, man. I'm chilling. What?
- Yeah. Shut the fuck up.

350
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:07,033
So excited!

351
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:10,787
All right, guys. This is it. Party time.

352
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,790
Let's do the rundown. Rubbers?

353
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,084
Check.

354
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,877
Breath mints?

355
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,674
Check.

356
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:24,134
Retainers?

357
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:31,057
I was kidding. That's so fucking gross.
Put that away.

358
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:36,813
- So, you guys sure about this?
- Relax, man. It's just a frat party.

359
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:38,857
What?

360
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,359
What? We're here to learn
about college, right?

361
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,736
God, I love the new attitude, Kevin.
It looks good on you, man.

362
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,572
It makes your eyes pop
and your hair shine.

363
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:49,367
It makes your shirt look better.
Good times. Good times. All right, guys.

364
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:53,413
Hold onto your socks,
because this is going to be awesome.

365
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:59,377
Hey, guys! Come on in!
The kegs are full and the Jacuzzi's hot!

366
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:00,587
Yeah!

367
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:02,422
Party!

368
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:04,174
Yeah!

369
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:09,304
What's up? Going on? Ladies?

370
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:15,810
There's a lot of dudes here, right?

371
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:18,354
Yeah. It's a total sausage fest.

372
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,149
Check it out!

373
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:24,777
These guys are so drunk
they're making out with each other.

374
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:26,279
Morris, I don't think they're drunk.

375
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:28,740
Who wants to play
glow-in-the-dark boners now?

376
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:32,493
It's boner tag! It's boner tag!

377
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:43,755
Why would they send us
to an all-gay fraternity? Do we look gay?

378
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:48,176
Maybe they found out how many times
you've been laid and just assumed.

379
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:49,469
Real funny, Carter.

380
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:54,182
Look, my cousin's a legacy. I doubt
they're gonna do that to us on purpose.

381
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:58,895
Don't worry!
That was not full of my piss or anything.

382
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,940
Just Bearcat's.

383
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:03,149
Yeah!

384
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:05,985
Hey, how was the party?
Did you guys find any dates?

385
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:08,029
Yeah, real funny, guys.
We almost got jumped back there.

386
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:11,157
Watch your step, pre-frosh!
This ain't high school!

387
00:22:11,282 --> 00:22:13,993
Welcome to college, boys. Enjoy.

388
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:17,872
Crap.

389
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:22,085
<i>Don't talk about it</i>

390
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,089
<i>Oh, boy, don't talk about it</i>

391
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:30,051
<i>If you do, I'll die</i>

392
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:39,352
Holy shit! This is insane!

393
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:42,188
No, man. This is fucking college.

394
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:48,403
God bless America for such a place!

395
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:51,322
Let's rock this bitch.

396
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:02,583
Hey! Hey! Hey! What's up, fellows?

397
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:07,255
Look, we feel like absolute shit
for what happened earlier.

398
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,759
- Yeah. We think you guys are cool.
- Yeah. It was just a joke.

399
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:15,096
We weren't trying to be
like assholes or anything.

400
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:16,764
Let us make it up to you.

401
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:18,307
We're gonna go do some body shots.

402
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:21,561
And we would love it
if you guys would come with us.

403
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:23,104
Dude, we are so down!

404
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:25,732
Actually, you know what?
I just filled up, so I'm cool.

405
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:28,568
Yeah, I think I'm gonna take a pass, too.

406
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:32,238
Lame and lamer.

407
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:37,368
Just saying, man, I guess Gina was right.

408
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,497
Dude, where's the bathroom?

409
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:45,126
All right. All right, you know what?
Fuck it! I'm in.

410
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:49,589
- Bottle.
- This is awesome.

411
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:56,262
Salt.

412
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:00,641
Limes.

413
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:05,188
And lube.

414
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:08,399
- What the hell is that for?
-  Just in case.

415
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:13,112
We probably won't need it. You guys...
You guys are gonna love this.

416
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,198
Where did the girls go?

417
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:16,282
Unfortunately,

418
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:19,035
the girls had to go home early.

419
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,164
So who are we doing body shots off of?

420
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:26,292
- Great question, Mike.
- Morris.

421
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:29,795
Bearcat was nice enough
to take their place.

422
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,339
Bearcat?

423
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,301
Yeah!

424
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,025
That's right, motherfuckers!

425
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,069
- Okay, we're outta here, let's go.
- Yeah.

426
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:54,362
Where are you guys going?

427
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:58,783
Yeah, we thought you guys were cool.
We thought you wanted to party.

428
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:00,618
Guess we were wrong.

429
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:04,497
Well, have fun back at the dorm,
you fucking pussies.

430
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:00,970
Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

431
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:03,431
- Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

432
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:06,017
- Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

433
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,935
Do that shot!
- Yeah!

434
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,562
Do that shot! Do it!

435
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:14,775
Watch this!

436
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:30,499
You are my best friend!

437
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:33,169
<i>All the girls and the boys
And people making noise</i>

438
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:34,420
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

439
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:36,255
<i>Bring them out
Bring them out</i>

440
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:39,008
Everything's spinning around me.
I'm drunk right now.

441
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:42,595
Doing shots of tequila out of
some guy's ass crack will do that to you.

442
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,181
Whatever, man. You guys
are lightweights. I don't feel shit!

443
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:46,891
Is that a fat joke, you bitch?

444
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:48,893
- Here! Video me!
- Okay.

445
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:53,647
Yeah, wait till Gina sees this! Party!

446
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:00,529
Party!

447
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,704
<i>Pump up your fist
If you twist like this</i>

448
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:09,955
<i>Till the lights go out</i>

449
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,290
<i>Bring them out
Bring them out</i>

450
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,668
<i>Katie</i>

451
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:17,505
<i>I don't know why I even try</i>

452
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,798
<i>'Cause lately</i>

453
00:27:19,924 --> 00:27:22,510
<i>You're always out with other guys</i>

454
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:25,054
<i>Pretty baby</i>

455
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,640
<i>Don't you know I'll treat you right</i>

456
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:30,267
<i>I'll go crazy</i>

457
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:33,646
<i>If you pass me up tonight</i>

458
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:36,315
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

459
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:38,734
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

460
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,278
<i>All this time can't get it off my mind</i>

461
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:42,988
<i>Dance the night away</i>

462
00:27:43,113 --> 00:27:44,073
<i>Keep rocking with me</i>

463
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:46,450
<i>When the grooves all right
Rocking all night</i>

464
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,619
<i>I want to hear you say</i>

465

<i>I'm calling you up
I need a ride</i>

476
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:11,725
<i>We're gonna shake up</i>

477
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,561
<i>So hurry it up, no wasted time</i>

478
00:28:14,687 --> 00:28:17,731
<i>The girls in their makeup
In black and white</i>

479
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:20,067
<i>Exchanging looks tonight</i>

480
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:23,070
<i>I just ran into some other friends of mine</i>

481
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:25,572
<i>Someone's coming round
To pick them up at nine</i>

482
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:28,200
<i>All the girls and the boys

<i>Bring them out

485
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:33,622
Fuck yeah!

486
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,252
Drink!

487
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:56,965
- Sorry. What?
- I made the shot. Now you drink.

488
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,634
Yeah, yeah, right. Cool. All right.

489
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:07,183
- So when do I get a turn?
- When I miss.

490
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:10,645
You kids having fun?

491
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:14,899
What? I can't play?

492
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:21,281
What do you say we wrap up this game
and bring it up to my room?

493
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:23,116
Minus the dickhead.

494
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,285
Yeah. I think I'll pass.

495
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:33,668
Could I get the beer? No?
Later? Well, okay.

496
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,505
- What an a-hole.
- Tell me about it.

497
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:39,841
Anyway, where were we?

498
00:29:42,177 --> 00:29:43,386
Nice.

499
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:48,850
Nitrous in the hizzie!
Who wants a balloon?

500
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:53,688
Granola Bar! Can I have one, please?

501
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:55,982
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The lady needs a balloon.

502
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:57,901
There you go, darling,
that one's just for you.

503
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:00,028
- I'm gonna sit.
- All right.

504
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:07,827
Hey, here you go. Have a balloon.

505
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:10,705
This balloon's for you! Have a balloon!

506
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:13,666
No, no.

507
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:19,464
You have to inhale it.
It makes chicks crazy horny, like her.

508
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,132
Wow.

509
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:26,729
Feel the flow.

510
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:35,321
Hey, I saw a laundry room back there.
You want to go make out or something?

511
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:38,783
- Oh, my God! Are you serious?
- Yeah.

512
00:30:38,908 --> 00:30:42,829
I haven't heard a line like that since,
like, high school. Later.

513
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:45,665
You've got flat tits!

514
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:47,917
Do you mind?

515
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:51,796
What? Yeah, absolutely.
Have a... Have a sip.

516
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:57,677
Or down the whole thing.
That's cool. Whatever.

517
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:09,605
I'm so getting laid.
Excuse me. Excuse me!

518
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:11,566
Excuse me. Excuse me!

519
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:13,276
What's up? How's it going?

520
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:15,778
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

521
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:17,780
You're bigger than me.
Excuse me! Excuse me!

522
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:29,667
This is awesome!

523
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:43,097
Wait. What was that?

524
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:47,560
Shit! I think someone's coming.

525
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:52,065
- No, no, no. The bed, the bed!
- What?

526
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,274
- I'm not gonna fit under there!
- You'll fit!

527
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:56,152
- I will not fit under this bed.
- Get under!

528
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:03,076
Are you sure this room's okay?

529
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:06,788
It's fine. Relax, okay?
Everyone's downstairs.

530
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:09,582
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Positive.

531
00:32:09,957 --> 00:32:13,294
I'm just a little nervous, you know?
I've never really been with a girl before.

532
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:18,257
Don't worry.
I'll be gentle. I promise.

533
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:38,528
Morris, maybe it's because
I'm really high right now,

534
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:40,905
but I will just go for this.

535
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:43,407
Go for what? You want another...

536
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:58,422
Sorry. Your hand is down my pants.

537
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:00,424
I know. Just relax.

538
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:03,094
Sweet!

539
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:07,139
Oh, God! That feels so good!

540
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:11,519
- Your hands are like butter!
- Are like butter.

541
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:16,107
You know, normally,
I'd be doing this to myself,

542
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:19,151
but this is way better.

543
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:22,655
Plus, I don't have to worry
about my mom walking in, and...

544
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:31,789
Heather? Hello?

545
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:36,210
Damn it! So close!

546
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:49,672
Cop!

547
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:52,883
- What's your problem?
- Hey, come on.

548
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:54,719
- Run!
- Who is that?

549
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:59,682
Party's busted! Everybody run!

550
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,646
That sucks.

551
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:15,197
That feels so good.

552
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:18,075
I almost forgot.
- You carry that with you?

553
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,411
They don't call it
a pocket rocket for nothing.

554
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:27,877
You got it?

555
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:31,297
Yeah. I got it. Where were we?

556
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:40,306
I didn't know you were so kinky.

557
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,687
Yeah!

558
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:49,648
Kiss me. Kiss me now.

559
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:51,984
Really?
- Kiss me!

560
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:53,819
Do it!

561
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:56,572
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

562
00:34:56,697 --> 00:34:59,200
Are you sure?
- Yeah. Just relax.

563
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:02,244
What the fuck do you know
about welfare reform?

564
00:35:02,328 --> 00:35:04,830
Come on down and check it out.

565
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:22,056
So, I don't really know what this means,

566
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:27,561
but Amy says that she's under the bed
with your friend Carter.

567
00:35:30,106 --> 00:35:32,441
- Should I be worried?
- Yeah, definitely.

568
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:34,068
Okay.

569
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:37,029
Wait a second.
Why aren't they on top of the bed?

570
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:39,115
That's a good question.

571
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:44,578
So what are you guys? Freshmen?

572
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:49,291
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're freshmen. Yep.

573
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,043
What's your major?

574
00:35:51,126 --> 00:35:53,003
Uh...

575
00:35:53,128 --> 00:35:55,589
- Photography.
- Really?

576
00:35:56,298 --> 00:36:00,803
I love photography.
I really suck, but that's cool.

577
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:02,638
I heard they have
a really great program here.

578
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:05,307
Yeah. It's supposed to be
one of the best in the country.

579
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:08,018
Maybe you can give me
a lesson sometime.

580
00:36:08,143 --> 00:36:09,645
Yeah, sure.

581
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:15,985
That was so hot.

582
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,778
Please tell me you're as horny
as I am right now.

583
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:18,863
- Hornier.
- Good.

584
00:36:18,988 --> 00:36:20,155
What's up, man?

585
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:24,201
Wow, motherfucker,
I can't believe we did that shit last night.

586
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:39,883
What the...

587
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,345
Christmas came early!

588
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:59,153
- Here we are.
- Yep. Here we are.

589
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:03,365
You know, you're different
than most college guys.

590
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,286
Well, you know,
I don't even really feel like a college guy.

591
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:10,998
Yeah. I could tell.
But it's a good thing.

592
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:18,422
- Maybe I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

593
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,675
- I hope so.
- Okay. Bye.

594
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,427
<i>In the night sky</i>

595
00:37:25,054 --> 00:37:28,057
<i>In the night sky</i>

596
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:32,102
<i>In the night sky</i>

597
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:42,154
<i>In the night sky
It used to be home</i>

598
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,034
- Kevin!
- Jesus, what?

599
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:49,578
What do you want?

600
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:24,571
Morris. Wake up, sleepy.

601
00:38:33,288 --> 00:38:35,999
Holy shit. Did we...

602
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,460
Heck, yeah! All night long.

603
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:41,046
Give it to me again, big boy!

604
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,757
This is the greatest day of my life.

605
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:49,513
Hey, Dad. Dad! What are you doing here?

606
00:38:49,638 --> 00:38:54,977
You missed your interview, Morris.
You blew it, the scholarship, Fieldmont,

607
00:38:56,311 --> 00:38:57,771
everything.

608
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:08,907
Shit!

609
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,787
The interview!

610
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:25,799
<i>Give it up</i>

611
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:30,345
<i>Give it up</i>

612
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,892
<i>Give it up</i>

613
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:39,146
<i>Give it up</i>

614
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:48,238
Apparently, Mr. Hooper's a no-show.

615
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,369
Thank God!

616
00:39:55,537 --> 00:39:58,415
You're still here. I'm sorry I'm late.

617
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:08,050
Now, behind me is the bronze statue
of a revolutionary war hero,

618
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:10,385
General W.S. Fieldmont.

619
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,306
It has become one of
the most sacred landmarks of our time.

620
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:20,312
My life is over.
My parents are gonna disown me.

621
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:25,275
- Dude, they probably didn't even notice.
- Didn't notice? Did you see my face?

622
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:29,696
Yeah, dude, I did.
That shit was so funny.

623
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,408
Whatever, dude. Just kiss
the scholarship bye-bye and move on.

624
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:34,910
And where the hell is Kevin, by the way?

625
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:37,496
You know, he should've been here by now.
This is his campus tour.

626
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:41,458
He probably just hooked up last night.
At least someone did.

627
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,544
You don't think
something happened to him, do you?

628
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,256
Dude, it's college.
What could possibly happen to him?

629
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:14,116
Looking good, Kev.
A lot hairier than I thought you'd be.

630
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,165
- Check it out.
- Hey!

631
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,918
- Nice diaper!
- Looking good, buddy!

632
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:31,299
Okay. This is really embarrassing.

633
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:33,802
Yeah, it's not really
the highlight of my day either, Carter.

634
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:35,137
Why would they do this to you?

635
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:40,058
I don't know. Because they can, I guess.
There's some clothes in my car. Try...

636
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,901
Maybe we should just go home.

637
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,736
We're not going anywhere, all right?
Not yet.

638
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,239
Why not? What are you trying to prove?

639
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:57,784
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm just trying to have fun.

640
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:00,579
Amen to that! God, I love the new Kevin!

641
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:02,372
You call this having a good time?

642
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:05,876
I'll get back at them.
It could have been worse.

643
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,837
What could be worse than getting
duct-taped naked to a statue all night?

644
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:12,674
<i>Hey, what's up, Gina?
It's that boring guy you dumped!</i>

645
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:14,509
<i>Fieldmont rocks!</i>

646
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:27,105
Dude, maybe the message
didn't even send.

647
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:29,816
You know what?
Whatever, I'm kind of hoping it did.

648
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:33,361
Really? Well, in that case,
let's do like a whole Kevin party series.

649
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:35,238
- We'll post it online...
- Yeah, dude, don't push it.

650
00:42:35,363 --> 00:42:36,489
Okay.

651
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:42,037
Come on, Morris.
Being stuck here isn't the worst thing.

652
00:42:42,162 --> 00:42:44,664
You know, I mean,
it's probably for the best.

653
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:45,957
How's it for the best?

654
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,460
Because if you went home now,
you know exactly what would happen.

655
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:52,005
Yeah! Your parents would go ape-shit
on your ass for blowing the big interview.

656
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,549
And now at least you could probably talk
to that Dean Chandler guy.

657
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,635
You know, explain what happened.

658
00:42:56,718 --> 00:42:58,428
You really think that would work?

659
00:42:58,553 --> 00:43:00,722
I think it's worth a shot.
What do you have to lose?

660
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:02,015
And you may see that Heather chick again

661
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:04,643
and get more than a half hand job.

662
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:08,730
I think he'll definitely see her again.

663
00:43:12,317 --> 00:43:13,735
Yeah.

664
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:45,266
By the way, I sort of accidentally
told Kendall we were in college last night.

665
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,486
Looks like those high school fuckers
aren't as stupid as we thought.

666
00:44:26,611 --> 00:44:28,530
They got front row seats to nipple city.

667
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,496
Motherfuckers!

668
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:40,041
It's part of the whole
sorority experience.

669
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,712
Fraternities throw parties,
and we have charity events.

670
00:44:43,795 --> 00:44:45,672
Nice! Are any of them naked?

671
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:49,968
All right, bitches, you're up!
This isn't social hour!

672
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:51,845
So I guess you better go, huh?

673
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,888
Yeah, but maybe if you're lucky,

674
00:44:53,972 --> 00:44:56,724
we'll let you guys buy us
a few beers tonight at Bruno's.

675
00:44:56,808 --> 00:44:58,643
- What's that?
- A bar.

676
00:44:59,144 --> 00:45:01,896
Wait. You guys do go to bars, right?

677
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:06,985
- Bars? Yeah. All the time.
- Every day. I'm always at the bar.

678
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:10,029
Just make sure you bring this guy.

679
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,031
- This guy?
- Me?

680
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:13,408
Yeah, you.

681
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:17,120
Last night was the first frat party
I actually enjoyed.

682
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:18,872
Because of me?

683
00:45:19,164 --> 00:45:22,625
- Okay.
- Well, we'll see you guys tonight then.

684
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:27,922
Hey, I was thinking maybe we could,
you know,

685
00:45:28,006 --> 00:45:29,883
finish what we started last night.

686
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:33,219
Maybe.
Just try not to pass out on me this time.

687
00:45:37,056 --> 00:45:38,141
God, that girl fucking rocks.

688
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,062
- Kev?
- Yeah?

689
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:49,235
On a scale of one to ten,
I like boobies at, like, 9,000. Seriously.

690
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,279
What's up, fellows?

691
00:45:51,988 --> 00:45:52,989
Hey, Kevin!

692
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:57,493
Heard you and the General got a
little cozy last night. Jesus Christ!

693
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:00,163
Yeah. Yeah, that was a good one, Teague.

694
00:46:00,246 --> 00:46:04,209
Hey, I don't suppose you know
what happened to my car, do you?

695
00:46:08,296 --> 00:46:10,757
- So that's how it's gonna be, Teague?
- That's right, pre-frosh.

696
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:13,801
In fact, we got a job
for you three douche bags.

697
00:46:13,885 --> 00:46:15,970
What kind of job?

698
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:20,183
Nothing much. We're just gonna need you
to clean the house for our party tonight.

699
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:24,562
Maybe wash my car.
You know how I like to keep my ride clean.

700
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:26,940
Where did I put them keys?

701
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:41,245
- Fuck that! No!
- Am I sensing some hostility?

702
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:42,413
Wait, are you guys serious?

703
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:43,957
Well, you guys didn't think
your room and board

704
00:46:44,082 --> 00:46:45,416
were gonna be free here, did you?

705
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,585
We're not cleaning your house!
No fucking way!

706
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,505
Well, maybe your little girlfriends
over there would like to find out

707
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:52,966
you guys are still in high school.

708
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:54,425
How do you know
we didn't already tell them?

709
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,013
Because if you did, they wouldn't be
giving you the time of day, you little dicks.

710
00:46:59,097 --> 00:47:01,516
Better get to work now, boys!

711
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,309
Pick the keys up.

712
00:47:06,854 --> 00:47:07,981
Boom!

713
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:13,569
And Kevin? Kevy?

714
00:47:15,071 --> 00:47:16,864
Don't waste your time with Kendall.

715
00:47:16,948 --> 00:47:19,242
You don't want my sloppy seconds,
do you?

716
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:22,787
Unless you're into that?
You fucking sicko! Go inside.

717
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,505
Dude, why do we have to clean?
Don't they got pledges to do this shit?

718
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,591
Dude, I think this weekend
we are the pledges.

719
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,691
<i>Don't let them take it all away</i>

720
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,489
<i>I'm down on my luck
I'm out on the streets</i>

721
00:47:58,614 --> 00:48:01,033
<i>I'm at wit's end
I've nearly been beat</i>

722
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:04,120
<i>See they've taken my home
They've taken my wife</i>

723
00:48:04,245 --> 00:48:06,539
<i>They've taken my job
And they've taken my life</i>

724
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:09,292
<i>But there's one thing
That they will not take</i>

725
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:12,128
<i>That I will hold till the end
Until my dying day</i>

726
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:14,839
<i>'Cause it's part of me
And it's time that we say</i>

727
00:48:14,964 --> 00:48:17,967
<i>They will not take it all away!</i>

728
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:35,026
<i>Don't let them take it all away</i>

729
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:40,573
<i>It's getting harder every day</i>

730
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:46,037
<i>Brothers, sisters, hear me say</i>

731
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:53,002
<i>I'm pounding the pavement
Through thick and thin</i>

732
00:48:53,085 --> 00:48:55,463
<i>Good times and bad
I just can't win</i>

733
00:48:55,546 --> 00:48:58,549
<i>I've been beat on, kicked on
Insulted to my face</i>

734
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:00,927
<i>The whole bleeding world thinks
I'm a bleeding disgrace</i>

735
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:04,013
<i>Yeah, they can own my body
But they'll never own my mind</i>

736
00:49:04,096 --> 00:49:06,349
<i>So they better face the facts
'Cause now is the time</i>

737
00:49:06,432 --> 00:49:09,393
<i>Till we all join hands
And all of us say</i>

738
00:49:09,518 --> 00:49:12,355
<i>They will not take it all away</i>

739
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,702
That's really funny.
'Cause I've been cleaning all day,

740
00:49:26,827 --> 00:49:29,247
so you think that it'd be funny
to come in and throw a cup down.

741
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,291
Because I've been working really hard
and you want to ruin that for me.

742
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:36,128
I love that! You're just...
You're so fucking cool, you bitch.

743
00:49:36,254 --> 00:49:39,590
Yeah, get some, you punk-ass bitch!
Come here, you steaming fuck!

744
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:53,562
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
- You want that scholarship, don't you?

745
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:55,898
Go on.

746
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:05,741
Come on, man! You can do it!
I believe in you! You're the coolest, bro!

747
00:50:06,867 --> 00:50:10,287
- Yeah, he's totally fucked. Yep.
- Yeah, totally.

748
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,039
Shit! Run away!

749
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:19,547
Let's just say that this morning was,
well, rather shocking.

750
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:23,092
Heck, I didn't even know
what some of those words meant.

751
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:25,469
I had to search the Internet for them.

752
00:50:25,594 --> 00:50:29,932
But I guess that's what happens
when you choose to stay at a frat house,

753
00:50:30,016 --> 00:50:32,977
rather than the dorm room
we assigned you.

754
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,980
I know, sir. It was a bad choice.

755
00:50:36,063 --> 00:50:41,110
Christ, if I had my way,
I'd kick every fraternity off this campus.

756
00:50:41,235 --> 00:50:46,282
Do you know that those animals
suck nitrous oxide

757
00:50:46,407 --> 00:50:49,577
out of balloons just to get high?

758
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,912
Really? That's just awful!

759
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:59,086
Mr. Hooper, there is no doubt
that you are academically gifted,

760
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:05,468
but the scholarships we give out here
are about much more than just that.

761
00:51:05,593 --> 00:51:07,595
Dean Chandler, that's me.

762
00:51:08,387 --> 00:51:10,473
My family has a long history at Fieldmont,

763
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:13,267
and I'd like to continue that legacy.

764
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,978
Well, you know, son, I guess
you're gonna have to prove it to me.

765
00:51:16,061 --> 00:51:18,022
For, as of right now, Mr. Hooper,

766
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:22,276
you and your scholarship
are hanging by a thread.

767
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:30,618
God! You're so lame!

768
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:32,536
Dude, where have you been? It's go time!

769
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:37,208
Relax! Relax!
I just had to run a little errand.

770
00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:42,046
All my years of hard work
have finally paid off! That's my boy.

771
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:46,467
- Nice.
- What's wrong, Morris?

772
00:51:48,093 --> 00:51:51,347
What's wrong?
I'm having a breakdown, Kevin!

773
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,307
Or have you forgotten what that feels like?

774
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,392
- I understand, man.
- What am I gonna do?

775
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:59,355
Somehow, I have to convince the Dean
that I actually want to go here.

776
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:01,607
Well, look, there's nothing
you can do about it tonight, all right?

777
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:05,528
- So let's just go get our girls. Here.
- This doesn't even look like me.

778
00:52:05,653 --> 00:52:07,655
Whatever, Morris. Just tell the bouncer
you don't photograph well.

779
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,323
Let me see it.

780
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:15,246
Dude, this will totally work!
You guys are both just so ugly.

781
00:52:15,371 --> 00:52:17,498
You're a little uglier, but it'll be good.
Don't worry about it.

782
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:21,252
Laquisha?

783
00:52:21,377 --> 00:52:25,172
Man, you actually expect me
to buy that your name is Laquisha?

784
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:28,509
You know what? I like how you roll, dog.
You in.

785
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:30,844
10 bucks cover tonight, guys.

786
00:52:32,346 --> 00:52:33,555
Shit!

787
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:36,809
- Sorry, guys. No dough, no go.
- Fuck!

788
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:38,727
Let the ladies through.

789
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:41,272
Let the ladies through.
Let the ladies through.

790
00:52:41,355 --> 00:52:45,567
- What was that? They didn't pay.
- Did you see the size of those racks?

791
00:52:47,278 --> 00:52:50,864
- No.
- Yeah, you big, big man.

792
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:53,492
You like that when
I squeeze them together for you?

793
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:54,576
I said no.

794
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:01,041
I cannot believe
those assholes ripped us off.

795
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:03,627
They've done pretty much
everything else to us so far this weekend.

796
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:05,462
Why not that?

797
00:53:05,587 --> 00:53:07,047
Man, do you think this is
what it's going to be like

798
00:53:07,172 --> 00:53:10,134
- when we're really in college?
- Who knows?

799
00:53:10,217 --> 00:53:13,303
Well, we probably won't all be together.
I know that.

800
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:16,015
God, Morris, you're such a fucking baby!
Would you stop being a girl?

801
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,268
- Would you please just shut up?
- What? It's true!

802
00:53:19,393 --> 00:53:22,771
Think about it, guys. This is it!
Senior year.

803
00:53:24,857 --> 00:53:26,900
Man, he's right. This is it.

804
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:29,403
You know, all the more of a reason
to take advantage of being here.

805
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:31,071
All right, I'm not sitting around.
Come on, you guys!

806
00:53:31,155 --> 00:53:32,197
Where are you going?

807
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:34,783
What do you think?
We've got a frat party to go to. Come on!

808
00:53:34,908 --> 00:53:37,286
- What about the girls?
- Shut up.

809
00:53:41,415 --> 00:53:42,499
- It hurts.
- Morris, let's go!

810
00:53:42,624 --> 00:53:44,001
Come on.

811
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:47,087
- Wait for me!
- You're so slow! You're so slow!

812
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:51,008
<i>I was on my way up
She was on her way down</i>

813
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:54,887
<i>And I didn't know I crossed that line</i>

814
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:59,475
<i>Make me sick to my stomach
When I think of that woman</i>

815
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,394
<i>Sitting in this cell of mine</i>

816
00:54:02,811 --> 00:54:06,690
<i>I said, "Goddamn, I'm only a man"</i>

817
00:54:06,815 --> 00:54:09,985
<i>Give me 15 years to life</i>

818
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:12,654
<i>Jailbait</i>

819
00:54:43,393 --> 00:54:45,145
Come on, cowboy.

820
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,815
Yeah!

821
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,860
You guys ready to celebrate?
All right!

822
00:54:55,572 --> 00:54:57,324
Where's my whip?

823
00:54:58,784 --> 00:55:01,161
You want to be my bitch, huh?

824
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:06,875
Pass it on.

825
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:40,701
- Fellows, it's not polite to stare!
- What the fuck, man? What's up?

826
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:45,038
Ladies, I want you to meet
some very special guests.

827
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:46,790
- Hi, boys.
- What's up?

828
00:55:46,915 --> 00:55:50,585
- Hi, cutie.
- Me? Hi.

829
00:55:50,711 --> 00:55:52,963
<i>Wait. You're the Penthouse
Pet of the Year.</i>

830
00:55:53,088 --> 00:55:54,214
Mmm-hmm.

831
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:57,676
<i>- And you're...
- On the cover of Penthouse Letters.</i>

832
00:55:57,801 --> 00:56:00,595
Fellows!
Good for you for staying current.

833
00:56:02,055 --> 00:56:06,268
Where were we? Where were we?
Where were...

834
00:56:09,187 --> 00:56:11,440
Yeah, that's right. Ladies?

835
00:56:11,565 --> 00:56:14,818
These guys were nice enough
to pay for all this.

836
00:56:14,943 --> 00:56:17,446
Wait a second. That's what you did
with our money? You paid for this party?

837
00:56:17,571 --> 00:56:20,449
Hey, kegs aren't cheap these days,
my man.

838
00:56:20,574 --> 00:56:22,576
Neither are the circus animals
we got coming later.

839
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:24,369
Wait! You couldn't have paid for this.

840
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:25,912
We didn't even have
that much money in our wallets.

841
00:56:25,996 --> 00:56:29,624
- Yeah.
- Yeah. What's up with that?

842
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,460
Luckily, you guys had some plastic.

843
00:56:31,585 --> 00:56:33,378
God, my parents gave me that
in case of an emergency.

844
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:35,464
Well, good thing they got
such a high limit!

845
00:56:35,547 --> 00:56:39,134
We almost maxed those puppies out.
Especially on this guy.

846
00:56:39,843 --> 00:56:41,261
Verne Troyer?

847
00:56:41,803 --> 00:56:43,972
- That's Mini-Me.
- Verne!

848
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:50,729
- Why do you keep hitting me? Fuck!
- Shut up, bitch!

849
00:56:51,772 --> 00:56:53,190
Fucking Mini-Me.

850
00:56:53,315 --> 00:56:56,568
It was Bearcat's idea.
God, I love that guy.

851
00:56:58,195 --> 00:57:02,157
Anyhow, we've gotta go be social.

852
00:57:02,282 --> 00:57:05,827
You douche bags have fun. Okay? Okay.

853
00:57:05,952 --> 00:57:07,120
Babies?

854
00:57:10,082 --> 00:57:13,210
That was so weird, but so hot!
Dude, she grabbed my nipple!

855
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:15,295
Dude, she twisted my nipple, dude!

856
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,673
So, basically, this is our party.

857
00:57:18,757 --> 00:57:23,678
- Yeah. In a roundabout way, I guess it is.
- Why don't I like where this is going?

858
00:57:23,762 --> 00:57:25,847
Come on, Morris! I mean, we paid for it.
We may as well enjoy it.

859
00:57:25,972 --> 00:57:28,558
- That's my boy!
- Come on! Who wants to keg stand?

860
00:57:28,683 --> 00:57:31,561
Me! Me! I'm first!
I wanna go first! Please.

861
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:39,027
- Have you ever done one of these before?
- No, but it looks like fun, huh, man?

862
00:57:39,152 --> 00:57:40,362
Yeah. Real fun.

863
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:42,113
All right, here,
make sure you get a good shot.

864
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,616
Wait, I thought you didn't want
to send Gina any more videos.

865
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:46,952
I changed my mind, all right?
Wait till she sees this one.

866
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:49,037
- Nice!
- Kev, come on.

867
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,040
What's happening?
You don't have to do this.

868
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:55,210
Yeah, I do, Morris, all right?
And you should lighten up and do one, too.

869
00:57:55,293 --> 00:57:57,128
Yeah, fuck nugget.

870
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:59,965
Me? No way. That's a bad idea.

871
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:03,218
- I'm already on thin ice with the Dean.
- Whatever!

872
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:08,890
You know what? I think I'm gonna go
and find something non-alcoholic to drink.

873
00:58:08,974 --> 00:58:10,100
You guys have fun puking on yourselves.

874
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:13,562
Okay. We will, buddy. I love you!
Call me later. Be safe.

875
00:58:13,645 --> 00:58:17,065
- All right, whatever. Let's do this thing!
- All right.

876
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:20,068
Yeah. Be careful with him, guys.
He's fragile.

877
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:22,445
Bitches spit, Kev. Bitches spit.

878
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:37,961
- Hey, is there alcohol in there?
- In the punch?

879
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:42,299
No, not at all.

880
00:58:42,424 --> 00:58:46,886
In fact, this is non-alcoholic
for our designated drivers.

881
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:51,600
- Really?
- Big old Bearcat wouldn't lie to you.

882
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:55,061
After last night, I feel like we bonded.

883
00:58:55,145 --> 00:58:59,357
In fact, if you don't believe me,
have a taste.

884
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:03,528
Hey, can I have some punch?

885
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:05,905
Hey, safety first.

886
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:08,742
- Another designated driver.
- Thank you.

887
00:59:12,412 --> 00:59:18,043
- Wow! It's pretty good.
- Drink up, buddy. You look thirsty.

888
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:21,171
Thanks, Bearcat. You're all right.

889
00:59:21,296 --> 00:59:24,049
Listen to me. If anybody,

890
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:28,595
and I mean anybody,
fucks with you tonight, find me.

891
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,180
I got your front.

892
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:33,600
- Don't you mean "back"?
- If that's how you want it.

893
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:37,604
If you feel something
moving in your pants, don't fight it!

894
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:40,148
Who's fucking on my floor?

895
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:47,364
- Heather!
- I know you!

896
00:59:47,447 --> 00:59:49,741
Hey, Teague, who's the blonde?

897
00:59:50,575 --> 00:59:54,621
Hey! Kendall! I'm glad you made it.
Let me get you girls some beers.

898
00:59:54,746 --> 00:59:57,040
No, thanks, Teague. Not now.

899
00:59:57,123 --> 01:00:01,336
If you're looking for who I think
you're looking for, don't bother.

900
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:04,214
He's a loser, him and his little friends.

901
01:00:04,631 --> 01:00:08,259
Are you really that jealous?

902
01:00:08,384 --> 01:00:11,805
You had your chance, Teague,
and thank God you blew it.

903
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:31,651
- Yeah!
- I wanna drink! I wanna drink!

904
01:00:32,652 --> 01:00:36,030
- Fuck, yeah!
- You are so awesome!

905
01:00:36,155 --> 01:00:38,157
- Verne!
- Verne! Hey, Verne!

906
01:00:38,282 --> 01:00:41,202
- Fuck you, prick!
- I love you, too!

907
01:00:41,285 --> 01:00:43,788
- Hey, man, did you get that one?
- Dude, you fucking drained the thing!

908
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:47,750
- Holy shit. Oh, hey, hey! Look, look!
- Ladies!

909
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,211
Hey, Kendall! Kendall, hey!

910
01:00:50,294 --> 01:00:51,546
What's up, ladies?

911
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:53,005
We were hoping you guys would show up.

912
01:00:53,089 --> 01:00:56,467
Yeah, we waited at the bar
tonight for, like, two hours.

913
01:00:56,551 --> 01:00:58,135
Yeah. Way to blow us off.

914
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:02,181
Amy, girl, you know
I'd never blow you off.

915
01:01:02,306 --> 01:01:06,686
Especially last night, you know,
after the lesbian thing.

916
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:09,438
Hey, hey, look, the bouncer
wouldn't let us in, 'cause our IDs sucked.

917
01:01:09,564 --> 01:01:11,524
We got in just fine,
and we don't even have ID.

918
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:15,695
Yeah, but, see, you guys got tits,
and those things are like gold.

919
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:19,031
Hey, but you know what?
You know what we're gonna do?

920
01:01:19,115 --> 01:01:23,494
Let us make it up to you, okay,
'cause you still need those beers, right?

921
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:26,747
- I think you've had plenty.
- Me? Come on! Please!

922
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,668
I'm just getting started.

923
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,422
All right, well,
I'm gonna get you those beers.

924
01:01:34,547 --> 01:01:35,548
We're gonna get you the beers.

925
01:01:35,631 --> 01:01:37,592
- So don't move.
- Let's go!

926
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,970
- Excuse me, boobies! Look out!
- Wait. Where's Morris?

927
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:50,021
- Cocksucking motherfucker!
- Fuck you!

928
01:01:50,104 --> 01:01:52,565
Come on back and fight like a man!

929
01:01:55,568 --> 01:01:57,361
<i>So, let's go</i>

930
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:59,447
<i>And get wasted</i>

931
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:02,825
<i>Let's go
Let's go</i>

932
01:02:02,908 --> 01:02:05,453
<i>And get high</i>

933
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:07,079
<i>Let's go</i>

934
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,169
Look who's here!
Little high school friends.

935
01:02:13,252 --> 01:02:16,422
Hey, come on, don't be a dick, Teague.
Fill us up.

936
01:02:16,964 --> 01:02:19,175
- What'd you say?
- I said fill us up, fucktard.

937
01:02:19,258 --> 01:02:20,801
Or is that too complicated for your small...

938
01:02:20,926 --> 01:02:24,055
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
He meant that in the nicest way possible.

939
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,433
Stop being an asshole, Teague,
and give them our beer.

940
01:02:27,558 --> 01:02:31,395
So you want some beer for your ladies?

941
01:02:32,688 --> 01:02:33,981
All right.

942
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:40,071
You know what? You guys put up with
a lot of shit these past couple of days,

943
01:02:40,196 --> 01:02:42,448
and you deserve this beer.

944
01:02:43,574 --> 01:02:45,618
In fact, hold on.

945
01:02:49,663 --> 01:02:52,124
Hey, everybody, listen up!
I've got a quick announcement to make!

946
01:02:52,249 --> 01:02:56,045
- Lay off, Teague.
- Trust me, Kendall. You're gonna love this.

947
01:02:56,837 --> 01:03:01,300
See these guys right here?
These guys are pre-frosh.

948
01:03:02,885 --> 01:03:06,597
- That's right! They're high school kids!
- High school?

949
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,723
High school?

950
01:03:07,807 --> 01:03:12,895
All right, come on now, once upon a time
we were high school kids, too.

951
01:03:13,896 --> 01:03:16,190
- No way!
- Come on.

952
01:03:16,315 --> 01:03:17,274
Grow up!

953
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,110
All right, shut up!

954
01:03:19,735 --> 01:03:21,445
These guys are cool.

955
01:03:21,862 --> 01:03:25,032
They're good guys
who want a beer and a good time.

956
01:03:26,075 --> 01:03:27,660
Give them one.

957
01:03:27,785 --> 01:03:30,246
Here it is. Your beer.

958
01:03:40,589 --> 01:03:44,802
What the fuck?
Stop peeing on me! What are you doing?

959
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:46,637
Would you fucking stop peeing on me,
you little shit?

960
01:03:46,762 --> 01:03:51,433
Say what?
Nobody talks to my bear kitten like that!

961
01:03:51,517 --> 01:03:54,520
What me and him got,
you'll never understand.

962
01:03:54,645 --> 01:03:55,980
Pick me up, bitch!

963
01:03:56,063 --> 01:03:58,274
Stop calling me bitch! This is my frat.
You're embarrassing me.

964
01:03:58,357 --> 01:03:59,775
And now let's get fucked up!

965
01:04:09,493 --> 01:04:11,954
- Kendall, wait!
- Nice one.

966
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:20,004
- Oh, my word, that was fun.
- That's not dancing.

967
01:04:21,338 --> 01:04:22,923
They can't dance.

968
01:04:23,674 --> 01:04:25,134
Jim! Look out!

969
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:31,849
- Sweet Jesus! That was close!
- Hi! Dean Chandler!

970
01:04:31,974 --> 01:04:34,351
Just the guy I wanted to talk to.

971
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:40,149
Oh, my God!

972
01:04:50,784 --> 01:04:52,453
I'm so dead.

973
01:04:52,578 --> 01:04:56,790
Yeah, well, at least you didn't get
beer poured on you by about 300 people.

974
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:58,667
Yeah, Kendall looked
pretty pissed back there, huh?

975
01:04:58,751 --> 01:04:59,752
Pissed?

976
01:04:59,877 --> 01:05:04,506
Dude, it looked like she was gonna
shoot fucking daggers out of her eyeballs.

977
01:05:07,343 --> 01:05:09,553
Kev? Kev! Where you going?

978
01:05:09,637 --> 01:05:12,473
I'm gonna go apologize.
You coming with me?

979
01:05:24,777 --> 01:05:28,781
Hey! Shut the fuck up!
This is my favorite part! Watch this shit!

980
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:40,709
Dude.

981
01:05:42,378 --> 01:05:44,338
There's Goose! There's Goose!

982
01:05:45,964 --> 01:05:48,467
Shit, that's funny!
Hey, play that shit again!

983
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,094
Play it in slow-mo!

984
01:05:50,219 --> 01:05:53,681
- You guys do this shit for fun?
- All day, every day.

985
01:05:53,806 --> 01:05:56,975
- Butch up, Goose! Stop being a pussy!
- Yeah!

986
01:06:00,145 --> 01:06:04,316
I just saw those high school kids
heading over to the sorority house.

987
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,276
Just saying.

988
01:06:11,156 --> 01:06:12,116
No way.

989
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:17,079
What?

990
01:06:17,162 --> 01:06:21,125
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Why? So you can tell me more lies?

991
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,419
- No, thanks.
- Hey! Wait!

992
01:06:26,755 --> 01:06:30,467
- Come on, I leave tomorrow.
- You know, I thought you were different.

993
01:06:30,592 --> 01:06:34,221
But you're just like the rest of them.
Have a nice drive.

994
01:06:36,849 --> 01:06:38,350
College blows!

995
01:06:39,935 --> 01:06:42,104
You think I'll ever see Heather again?

996
01:06:42,187 --> 01:06:45,190
Probably not, Morris.
I pretty much blew it for all of us.

997
01:06:45,274 --> 01:06:47,276
So that was my last shot
to score with Amy.

998
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,444
All I wanna do is bang
one college chick this weekend.

999
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:51,613
Is that so much to ask?

1000
01:06:51,697 --> 01:06:53,198
What the hell?

1001
01:06:55,951 --> 01:06:57,911
My glasses! My glasses!

1002
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:03,584
Get them in the van! Get them in.

1003
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:05,544
Get them in.

1004
01:07:16,054 --> 01:07:19,516
You pukes are worthless.
- Worthless!

1005
01:07:19,641 --> 01:07:23,437
Nothing but a bunch
of goddamn high school kids!

1006
01:07:23,562 --> 01:07:26,148
Goddamn high school kids!

1007
01:07:31,028 --> 01:07:35,324
I can't believe we're even out here
wasting our time on you.

1008
01:07:35,407 --> 01:07:38,202
Wasting our motherfucking time!

1009
01:07:38,327 --> 01:07:41,038
Dude, what's with the repeating?
It's fucking killing me.

1010
01:07:41,163 --> 01:07:45,542
Sorry! It's stupid. Can I get a hug?

1011
01:07:48,086 --> 01:07:51,465
Just go stand over there
and look fucking mean.

1012
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:52,633
Do the growl thing.

1013
01:07:52,758 --> 01:07:56,553
Come on, man, I'll jeeper creeper
these motherfuckers. Hug me.

1014
01:08:07,105 --> 01:08:11,568
We got beer to drink.
So it's been fun, kind of.

1015
01:08:13,278 --> 01:08:15,072
By the way,

1016
01:08:15,197 --> 01:08:19,409
have you guys ever seen
a pig stampede before?

1017
01:08:19,534 --> 01:08:22,412
- Fucked up. Pig stampede.
- Pig stampede!

1018
01:08:22,496 --> 01:08:24,706
Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1019
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:27,417
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1020
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:30,671
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1021
01:08:40,138 --> 01:08:43,392
Get out of the front seat, bitch!
I called shotgun!

1022
01:08:48,438 --> 01:08:50,190
Shit! Run!

1023
01:08:59,324 --> 01:09:02,202
Keep running, you little sicko pig fuckers!

1024
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:08,709
This sucks.

1025
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:12,254
Yeah, thanks for
stating the obvious, Carter.

1026
01:09:12,337 --> 01:09:17,134
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but I think I actually miss high school.

1027
01:09:19,261 --> 01:09:21,096
- What, Kevin?
- Nothing. Forget it.

1028
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:23,014
Don't forget it. If you have
something to say, fucking say it!

1029
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:25,559
Okay, fine, you want it? Here it is.
You're full of shit, Carter!

1030
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:26,685
I'm full of shit?

1031
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:29,020
Yeah! You're always talking
such a big fucking game, man.

1032
01:09:29,146 --> 01:09:32,441
You know what? Newsflash!
He's never even been laid.

1033
01:09:34,526 --> 01:09:39,823
- So, that's how it's gonna be, huh, Kevin?
- No, no, no. Wait. You're still a virgin?

1034
01:09:39,906 --> 01:09:44,077
- Man! This is great.
- Yeah, whatever, Morris! Shut up!

1035
01:09:44,202 --> 01:09:45,662
You know what, Kev? Stop dumping on us

1036
01:09:45,787 --> 01:09:47,789
'cause the weekend didn't turn out
the way you thought it would!

1037
01:09:47,873 --> 01:09:49,583
Yeah, probably because
I've been listening to you too much.

1038
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:54,087
Yeah, 'cause it was my idea to try
to prove Gina wrong and lie to Kendall!

1039
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:57,007
- That was all you, man!
- Guys, come on. Let's not fight.

1040
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:59,509
You know what? Stay out of it, Morris!
You're not part of this!

1041
01:09:59,593 --> 01:10:00,969
I'm not part of this?

1042
01:10:01,052 --> 01:10:03,054
This was supposed to be yours
and my weekend here.

1043
01:10:03,138 --> 01:10:04,639
Dude, whatever.
I didn't mean it like that.

1044
01:10:04,723 --> 01:10:06,600
No, but while we're comparing
shitty weekends,

1045
01:10:06,725 --> 01:10:07,767
here's one for you.

1046
01:10:07,893 --> 01:10:10,520
My face got written on
before my scholarship interview,

1047
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:12,522
a pig just snacked on my nuts,

1048
01:10:12,647 --> 01:10:14,524
and, oh, yeah,
I almost forgot about this one,

1049
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:16,151
I puked on the Dean's car,

1050
01:10:16,276 --> 01:10:18,570
which pretty much means
that I'm not getting my scholarship!

1051
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:19,988
God, Morris! Ever since you got here

1052
01:10:20,071 --> 01:10:22,199
you whine, whine, whine
about your fucking scholarship.

1053
01:10:22,324 --> 01:10:23,408
You don't even want to go here.

1054
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:26,036
It's not about what I want!
You know how my parents are!

1055
01:10:26,161 --> 01:10:28,538
Yeah, well, then grow some fucking balls
and stand up to them.

1056
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:30,040
It's not that easy.

1057
01:10:30,123 --> 01:10:32,375
Hey, man, what's next?
They're gonna choose what job you take?

1058
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,295
- What girl you marry?
- Dude, lay off, Kev!

1059
01:10:36,129 --> 01:10:37,923
That's a first.
You're sticking up for Morris, man?

1060
01:10:38,048 --> 01:10:40,926
- You bag on him more than anyone.
- That's not true and you fucking know it!

1061
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:42,219
Ha!

1062
01:10:43,178 --> 01:10:45,555
Okay, you know what, Morris? Fuck you!

1063
01:10:45,639 --> 01:10:48,141
That's the last time
I ever have your fucking back!

1064
01:10:48,266 --> 01:10:52,646
You know what? Fuck you, too, Kevin,
for dumping all your bullshit on us.

1065
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,151
All right, fine, Morris.
Yeah, walk away with him.

1066
01:10:58,276 --> 01:11:00,904
Why don't you hold his hand
while you're at it?

1067
01:11:00,987 --> 01:11:05,033
- Fuck you, Kevin.
- Dropping the F-bomb, big man.

1068
01:11:05,116 --> 01:11:07,243
What is that,
the first time you ever used it?

1069
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:09,371
I'm telling your parents!

1070
01:11:10,622 --> 01:11:11,706
Fuck!

1071
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:14,042
<i>We do not know</i>

1072
01:11:17,504 --> 01:11:18,630
<i>How things work</i>

1073
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:19,172
<i>How things work</i>

1074
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,512
<i>We do not know</i>

1075
01:11:29,391 --> 01:11:31,768
<i>Where you go</i>

1076
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:38,733
<i>In the night</i>

1077
01:11:41,486 --> 01:11:43,113
<i>Through the door</i>

1078
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:49,411
<i>Through the door that holds you</i>

1079
01:11:53,164 --> 01:11:57,335
<i>Through the door that holds you</i>

1080
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,257
<i>Out of the blue</i>

1081
01:12:09,347 --> 01:12:12,642
<i>We do not know</i>

1082
01:12:17,272 --> 01:12:21,276
<i>The door that holds you</i>

1083
01:12:24,195 --> 01:12:26,322
<i>Silent as glue</i>

1084
01:12:28,783 --> 01:12:31,077
<i>We stand under it</i>

1085
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,289
<i>But we don't understand it</i>

1086
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:38,793
<i>The door that holds you</i>

1087
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,801
<i>Silent as glue</i>

1088
01:12:49,012 --> 01:12:54,267
<i>And stars fall on</i>

1089
01:12:57,604 --> 01:13:02,734
<i>Stars fall on</i>

1090
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,197
<i>Silent as glue</i>

1091
01:13:27,425 --> 01:13:31,554
- Nice look.
- This? Yeah, thanks.

1092
01:13:34,641 --> 01:13:35,808
So...

1093
01:13:40,605 --> 01:13:42,899
- Look, about what happened...
- Don't even go there.

1094
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:46,736
- Just let me explain.
- I really don't want to hear it, Kevin.

1095
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:48,696
I don't even know who you are.

1096
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,241
Yeah, to be honest,
I'm not even sure I know anymore.

1097
01:13:51,324 --> 01:13:53,868
Maybe it's time you figure that out.

1098
01:13:55,870 --> 01:14:00,750
You know, high school, college,
it wouldn't have mattered to me.

1099
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,127
Yeah, I know. It's so stupid.

1100
01:14:03,253 --> 01:14:07,298
You know, I came down here thinking
I needed to change who I was.

1101
01:14:08,466 --> 01:14:10,551
Lying to you was just part of it.

1102
01:14:10,677 --> 01:14:13,263
I thought you were pretty great.
Why would you want to change that?

1103
01:14:13,388 --> 01:14:14,847
I don't know.

1104
01:14:16,266 --> 01:14:18,226
You don't know?

1105
01:14:18,309 --> 01:14:21,813
Like, I mean,
I kind of liked who I was, or I am.

1106
01:14:21,938 --> 01:14:25,108
You know, a little uptight at times,
responsible.

1107
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:32,240
God, I really screwed up this weekend.

1108
01:14:32,323 --> 01:14:34,826
You know, now Morris and Carter
are pissed at each other.

1109
01:14:34,951 --> 01:14:36,911
They're both pissed at me.

1110
01:14:39,038 --> 01:14:43,001
You just seem like the kind of person
who doesn't make mistakes.

1111
01:14:43,376 --> 01:14:44,419
Ha!

1112
01:14:46,504 --> 01:14:49,507
A couple weeks ago... Brace yourself.

1113
01:14:51,968 --> 01:14:53,886
I hooked up with Teague.

1114
01:14:54,012 --> 01:14:56,597
- Huge mistake.
- Yeah, he kinda told me.

1115
01:14:58,641 --> 01:15:00,977
Why not? He told the whole campus.

1116
01:15:03,563 --> 01:15:06,357
Why'd you do it?
I mean, with a guy like Teague?

1117
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:09,110
- He is so...
- For all the wrong reasons.

1118
01:15:10,862 --> 01:15:13,740
He was good-looking.
He made me feel special,

1119
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:17,952
and since he was a really good liar,

1120
01:15:18,077 --> 01:15:23,750
he made believe that it was
more than just a one-night thing.

1121
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,671
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

1122
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,633
It was kind of why I freaked out tonight.

1123
01:15:34,761 --> 01:15:40,224
I found out that you lied and
I assumed that you were just like Teague.

1124
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:43,478
Oh, God, please, look,
I'm nothing like that guy.

1125
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:48,107
I'm really sorry about everything.

1126
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:52,820
Is this the real Kevin talking?

1127
01:15:52,904 --> 01:15:56,240
Or is this the new and improved
college Kevin talking?

1128
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:57,492
No, this is the real me,

1129
01:15:57,575 --> 01:16:01,162
the uptight, responsible,
un-fun high school one.

1130
01:16:03,414 --> 01:16:06,584
Good. Apology accepted then.

1131
01:16:10,755 --> 01:16:13,966
All right, well,
I gotta go find Carter and Morris.

1132
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:19,722
Before you go,
can I please give you some clothes?

1133
01:16:23,893 --> 01:16:27,730
- Morris? Morris, wake up!
- Kevin?

1134
01:16:29,941 --> 01:16:32,401
- What's with the...
- Where's Carter?

1135
01:16:38,824 --> 01:16:43,329
Look, you guys. I've been thinking
all night. I just want to say I'm sorry

1136
01:16:44,288 --> 01:16:46,040
about everything.

1137
01:16:46,123 --> 01:16:49,210
- You said some harsh things, man.
- Yeah, I know.

1138
01:16:50,294 --> 01:16:54,382
I've realized a lot about myself
this weekend, and you guys.

1139
01:16:54,507 --> 01:16:56,384
I didn't mean what I said.

1140
01:16:56,467 --> 01:16:59,053
I've just been so hung up
on what Gina told me

1141
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:03,599
that I haven't even stopped to think
that, you know, maybe she was wrong.

1142
01:17:05,309 --> 01:17:06,310
You guys are my best friends.

1143
01:17:06,435 --> 01:17:10,106
I'm not gonna let some stupid weekend
at college ruin that.

1144
01:17:11,816 --> 01:17:15,611
Whatever, man. It's cool.
I like the boring Kevin more anyway.

1145
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,863
Thanks, Carter. I think.

1146
01:17:21,325 --> 01:17:22,618
Morris?

1147
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:28,666
We all said some stuff, you know?
No biggie. I'm over it.

1148
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:32,545
Sorry I, like, freaked out and lost my shit.

1149
01:17:38,884 --> 01:17:40,261
You guys,

1150
01:17:42,346 --> 01:17:44,724
that was so gay.

1151
01:17:44,849 --> 01:17:47,852
That was like the third gayest thing
we've done this weekend.

1152
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:51,105
- It's getting out of hand.
- All right, look. Does this mean we're cool?

1153
01:17:51,188 --> 01:17:53,607
Yeah, man. For sure.

1154
01:17:53,691 --> 01:17:56,694
Okay! So now that we're done arguing
like a bunch of chicks,

1155
01:17:56,777 --> 01:18:01,157
- what the hell are we doing out here?
- Go ahead and look for yourselves.

1156
01:18:05,286 --> 01:18:07,496
- Is that all our stuff?
- Yeah.

1157
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:11,917
- They even threw in all our rubbers.
- Those taint-sucking ball junkies.

1158
01:18:13,335 --> 01:18:14,378
Yep.

1159
01:18:31,896 --> 01:18:34,523
- Can we go home now?
- No. Not yet.

1160
01:18:34,648 --> 01:18:37,860
- Dude, why the fuck would we stay?
- The weekend's over, Kevin.

1161
01:18:37,985 --> 01:18:39,570
It's pretty clear
we're not wanted here anymore.

1162
01:18:39,695 --> 01:18:41,530
Come on, you guys.
We've got to stand up for ourselves.

1163
01:18:41,655 --> 01:18:43,824
No, we don't. We need to go home.

1164
01:18:43,908 --> 01:18:45,201
Come on, man.
After all the shit we've been through?

1165
01:18:45,326 --> 01:18:48,037
We can't leave like this, Morris.

1166
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,540
Besides, I can't stand up
to these fraternity assholes on my own.

1167
01:18:51,624 --> 01:18:56,545
All right, fuck it! If I'm not gonna get laid,
I might as well get revenge, right?

1168
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:03,093
Come on, Morris.
We can't do this without you.

1169
01:19:04,678 --> 01:19:08,140
Come on, man. Just think about it.
Who wrote "hairy balls" on your face?

1170
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:09,767
- Fraternity guys.
- Yeah.

1171
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:12,269
Who made you wash their car,
drink out of some dude's belly button

1172
01:19:12,394 --> 01:19:13,896
and puke all over the Dean's car?

1173
01:19:14,021 --> 01:19:15,022
Who stripped you naked

1174
01:19:15,147 --> 01:19:17,274
and made you feel
like a little bitch all weekend long?

1175
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:21,070
- Fraternity guys!
- Yeah, that's right, the fraternity guys.

1176
01:19:21,153 --> 01:19:22,571
Look, man,
you want to stand up to your parents?

1177
01:19:22,696 --> 01:19:25,866
Why don't you start
by taking a stand here first?

1178
01:19:26,367 --> 01:19:28,869
Let's take those motherfuckers down.

1179
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:48,472
Fuck!

1180
01:19:56,522 --> 01:19:58,941
One, two.

1181
01:20:00,776 --> 01:20:03,571
- Four, five...
- Dude, open the door!

1182
01:21:20,564 --> 01:21:22,024
Get over here!

1183
01:21:45,923 --> 01:21:49,510
Five, four, three, two...

1184
01:21:54,932 --> 01:21:59,061
- Dude, are you sure this is going to work?
- Trust me. It's physics.

1185
01:22:24,878 --> 01:22:26,213
Fuck.

1186
01:22:43,355 --> 01:22:45,607
- What the fuck?
- Nothing's happening.

1187
01:22:45,732 --> 01:22:47,192
Maybe the matches blew out.

1188
01:23:06,044 --> 01:23:07,379
What the...

1189
01:23:11,049 --> 01:23:13,135
Shit! Fuck!

1190
01:23:17,264 --> 01:23:18,765
What the fuck?

1191
01:23:36,325 --> 01:23:37,659
Fucking pig!

1192
01:23:39,036 --> 01:23:40,537
Fucking shit!

1193
01:23:47,836 --> 01:23:49,046
Oh, shit!

1194
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:56,011
- What the fuck is happening?
- There's pigs everywhere!

1195
01:24:01,475 --> 01:24:03,727
Fuck me! God damn it!

1196
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,482
What the fuck?

1197
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,693
It's beer!

1198
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,489
It's fucking beer, man!

1199
01:24:34,883 --> 01:24:38,053
Hey, you guys, you got to come outside!

1200
01:24:38,178 --> 01:24:41,181
I think the Beta Chi House is on fire
or something.

1201
01:25:02,619 --> 01:25:04,079
Fuck you, pig!

1202
01:25:08,792 --> 01:25:10,585
Nice hair cut, buddy!

1203
01:25:14,464 --> 01:25:16,049
- Bearcat.
- Wait!

1204
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:22,597
Wait! Can I flush first, guys? Come on!

1205
01:25:22,681 --> 01:25:25,809
You boys are in a world of shit now.
Disturbing the peace,

1206
01:25:25,934 --> 01:25:28,270
destruction of property,
stealing farm animals!

1207
01:25:28,353 --> 01:25:31,523
What the hell are you talking about?
It wasn't us!

1208
01:25:33,733 --> 01:25:38,363
- It was those fuckers right there!
- Officer, we don't even go here.

1209
01:25:38,488 --> 01:25:40,490
No. We're just a bunch
of high school kids.

1210
01:25:40,615 --> 01:25:44,077
You know, Officer, frankly, I'm appalled
at the behavior on this campus.

1211
01:25:44,202 --> 01:25:46,288
Motherfuckers!

1212
01:25:46,413 --> 01:25:47,747
Fuck you!

1213
01:25:47,831 --> 01:25:51,751
Careful there, buddy. You've got a little
cut from a straight razor on your nipple.

1214
01:25:51,835 --> 01:25:53,420
Wait, wait! Wait!

1215
01:25:55,338 --> 01:25:57,215
- Where's my car?
- Plastic pussy stole it!

1216
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,717
Where's my fucking car?

1217
01:26:05,724 --> 01:26:07,642
This was donated by
a group of our alumni.

1218
01:26:07,767 --> 01:26:10,395
This has made a very welcome addition
to our campus.

1219
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:14,107
And I'm sure that your child will embrace
their studies...

1220
01:26:14,232 --> 01:26:17,986
Why don't we go ahead, guys?
Just follow me. Come on, guys.

1221
01:26:24,075 --> 01:26:26,620
So, wait. You're in high school?

1222
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:30,123
Yeah. I just came here to visit
for the weekend, like you guys.

1223
01:26:30,206 --> 01:26:34,544
- But you even drink like a college girl.
- Really? Thanks.

1224
01:26:36,796 --> 01:26:41,968
- So I guess this is it, huh?
- Well, it doesn't have to be.

1225
01:26:44,512 --> 01:26:45,805
Carter!

1226
01:26:48,391 --> 01:26:51,353
Spank me, tiger! Yeah!

1227
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,529
- I guess I better...
- Morris.

1228
01:27:04,949 --> 01:27:07,869
Think you're gonna go here next year?

1229
01:27:07,994 --> 01:27:11,206
After this weekend,
I kind of feel like I already do.

1230
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:14,751
Plus, I already have
a girlfriend lined up, so...

1231
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:16,836
Yeah? And who's that?

1232
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,467
Someone I met.
She plays a mean game of quarters.

1233
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:28,473
So I guess that means I'll be getting
my photography lessons after all.

1234
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:52,080
- So that's everything.
- I guess we should get on the road.

1235
01:27:52,163 --> 01:27:54,374
Wait. You know what? Hang on.

1236
01:28:03,842 --> 01:28:06,094
All right, guys. Let's go home.

1237
01:28:19,858 --> 01:28:21,734
Here comes trouble.

1238
01:28:21,818 --> 01:28:25,572
- Hey, Kevin.
- Hey, Gina.

1239
01:28:25,655 --> 01:28:27,991
So I got your video message.

1240
01:28:28,575 --> 01:28:30,577
Looks like you guys
had a pretty crazy weekend.

1241
01:28:30,702 --> 01:28:32,036
Hell, yeah!

1242
01:28:34,038 --> 01:28:35,790
- Yeah!
- Breath mint.

1243
01:28:38,168 --> 01:28:43,590
Anyway, well,
it kind of made me think a lot

1244
01:28:43,673 --> 01:28:47,552
about you and me and, you know, us.

1245
01:28:49,304 --> 01:28:51,806
Why don't we just forget
this whole break-up thing ever happened?

1246
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,474
What do you say?

1247
01:28:55,268 --> 01:28:56,561
Well...

1248
01:28:59,856 --> 01:29:01,065
You know,

1249
01:29:02,984 --> 01:29:04,611
I don't think so.

1250
01:29:06,571 --> 01:29:09,741
- What?
- Yeah, you see, I've moved on.

1251
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:15,788
Moved on? We've only been
broken up for, like, three days.

1252
01:29:15,914 --> 01:29:18,833
Yeah, well, a lot can happen in three days.

1253
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:25,381
And, Gina, that guy you saw?
Yeah, that's not really me.

1254
01:29:26,591 --> 01:29:28,927
Well, see you around.

1255
01:29:29,052 --> 01:29:32,221
And get a boob job, Gina. Lift.

1256
01:29:33,973 --> 01:29:37,769
Kevin! Wait! Seriously!

1257
01:29:42,523 --> 01:29:45,360
So what do you guys
want to do next weekend?

1258
01:29:45,443 --> 01:29:48,446
Next weekend? Aren't you grounded for,
like, the next six months?

1259
01:29:48,529 --> 01:29:51,532
Fuck that! No problem.
I can just sneak out.

1260
01:29:53,201 --> 01:29:56,704
You know,
I've got a cousin that goes to U of I.

1261
01:30:12,595 --> 01:30:15,640
I'll pay you $5 a sniff,
either one of your farts.

1262
01:30:15,765 --> 01:30:19,394
I just want to cherish
your gaseous fumes.

1263
01:30:19,519 --> 01:30:21,437
It can be a birthday present.
My birthday's coming up!

1264
01:30:21,854 --> 01:30:23,606
Yeah! Lost my shoe.

1265
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:28,277
Dude, you gotta see the shots I got
from last night's game.

1266
01:30:28,403 --> 01:30:30,822
I got one where Stoloff is mid-air
right over the inset...

1267
01:30:30,947 --> 01:30:33,658
Insectercide? Whatever the hell...
What the...

1268
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:39,455
Dean Chandler has denied our petition,
and we're still on probation.

1269
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:41,082
- Shit.
- Yeah.

1270
01:30:41,249 --> 01:30:42,542
<i>Okay, cut!</i>

1271
01:30:44,961 --> 01:30:48,506
Our camping trips? Our... The school...

1272
01:30:48,589 --> 01:30:50,758
Thing that was awesome
that we did together. Remember that?

1273
01:30:50,883 --> 01:30:53,344
It was you and me. What's the line?

1274
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:59,100
Looks like my years of hard work
have finally paid off!

1275
01:31:00,977 --> 01:31:01,936
What's the matter, Morris?

1276
01:31:02,019 --> 01:31:04,397
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1277
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,151
I've taken some whip-its, you know,
the cracker shit.

1278
01:31:12,071 --> 01:31:14,323
Whatever, man.
You guys are lightweights. I don't feel shit.

1279
01:31:14,449 --> 01:31:18,828
- Mom's a lightweight.
- Here... Fuck you, dude!

1280
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:22,456
Well, it doesn't have to be.

1281
01:31:27,378 --> 01:31:28,671
Is that our stuff?

1282
01:31:28,796 --> 01:31:31,632
Yeah. They even threw all our rubbers in.

1283
01:31:32,466 --> 01:31:34,886
Those scrotum-eating baby rapers.

1284
01:31:37,013 --> 01:31:39,390
Those taint-sucking ball junkies.

1285
01:31:45,021 --> 01:31:47,481
Those jizz-guzzling monkey fuckers.

1286
01:31:52,528 --> 01:31:55,114
<i>You sucked in Austin Powers.
Mike Myers carried you.</i>

1287
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:57,200
You didn't even say nothing, bitch.

1288
01:31:57,325 --> 01:31:59,911
Dude, you're doing it wrong, anyway.
You gotta flip it, bitch.

1289
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:01,495
Fucking beat you...

1290
01:32:04,457 --> 01:32:07,376
Dude, this is so much better
than the brochure.

1291
01:32:07,501 --> 01:32:09,295
I know, man.
I've got a good feeling about this.

1292
01:32:09,378 --> 01:32:13,758
- I'm sorry, K.B. just said he had a boner.
- He said he had a boner.

1293
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:15,176
<i>Can we cut? Cut.</i>

1294
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,845
I've got to ask you a favor.

1295
01:32:18,763 --> 01:32:20,348
You know that book about the mice

1296
01:32:20,473 --> 01:32:23,643
that Miss Dangle is asking
everybody to read?

1297
01:32:23,726 --> 01:32:26,312
- That's way too much cereal.
- Swallow.

1298
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:30,733
Twin powers, activate!

1299
01:32:31,984 --> 01:32:36,238
Form of a screaming...
Screaming manimal!

1300
01:32:40,534 --> 01:32:44,622
<i>Bearcat's gay and he wants to do me</i>

1301
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:49,961
<i>I'm gonna punch his face
And then he'll sue me</i>

1302
01:32:51,253 --> 01:32:55,091
<i>I'm going home with
pussy on my pee-pee</i>

1303
01:32:56,300 --> 01:33:03,057
<i>Gonna tell my friends
That college is the shitty, yeah</i>

1304
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,060
<i>Eat that shit</i>

1305
01:33:06,143 --> 01:33:07,395
And cut!
