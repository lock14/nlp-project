1
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,626
Hi, Mr. Quinette.

2
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,994
Whoa!

3
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,229
Come here!

4
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,065
Come on back up!
I got one for you.

5
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,066
Really?

6
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,068
Yeah!

7
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,741
Here.

8
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,109
Thanks.

9
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,111
No problem,<i> hombre.</i>

10
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,317
Nope, still fours.

11
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,852
Pair of kings.

12
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,587
Who knows? And... crap.

13
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,923
Kings bet.

14
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,925
Five.

15
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,734
God, what the fuck are
you doing in this hand?

16
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,002
What?

17
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,103
For the last three hours,

18
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,238
you've been playing
cards like a moron.

19
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,573
Yeah, I know.

20
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,576
Hey, uh... what does
"cotillion" mean?

21
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,878
I don't know.
A flower?

22
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,146
Yeah? I don't know.

23
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,348
Dance, it's
a dance class.

24
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,816
Can we have the
next card, please?

25
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,418
Take it easy,
Randolph.

26
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,190
Twenty.

27
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,192
Call.

28
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,001
Twenty.

29
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,036
Up 20.

30
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,972
Up 20 again.

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,308
Up 60.

32
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,677
Fine.

33
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,114
Full house.
Kings full.

34
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,718
Four fours.

35
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,687
Oh, for fuck's sake!

36
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,056
You should never go
up against her.

37
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,224
She's already got
your new truck.

38
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,658
No, she does not
have my truck.

39
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,659
Well, she's driving it.

40
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,827
All right, cash me.

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,362
She rivered the four,
for fuck's sake!

42
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,497
Yeah.

43
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,765
Well, that is fucking
ridiculous.

44
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,600
I know, I'm not proud of it,
but there it is.

45
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,270
I gotta go.

46
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,505
Oh, great, now she scats.

47
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,774
No, I said I was going
an hour ago.

48
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,511
Okay, thanks for the game,
and thanks for the vocab help.

49
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,046
Play a few more hands
and I'll go with you.

50
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,647
I can't; I got
to go to the city.

51
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,815
Right.
Drive safe.

52
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,816
Yep.

53
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,151
Take care
of my truck.

54
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,153
It's not your truck.

55
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:55,961
Hi, Sal.

56
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:56,962
Hey!

57
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,263
Still open?

58
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,833
Not really, but I'll
get you a beer.

59
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,234
Thanks.

60
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,775
Thanks.

61
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,714
How are things?

62
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,017
Tired.

63
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,651
You going to the city?

64
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,287
Yeah, got a little
ahead of myself.

65
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:45,978
You keep watching us.

66
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,280
Yeah.

67
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,849
You want to play?

68
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,618
What do you
usually play for?

69
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,019
Five bucks a rack.

70
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,024
You know what?

71
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,795
I got to be in the city soon,
so, uh, how about 20 a rack?

72
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,596
And I'll give a lot of weight.

73
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,689
Dad, I got to go
to school early today.

74
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,060
What time is it?

75
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,195
Morning, Gulls.

76
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,397
Morning.
It's like 7:00, but remember,

77
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,866
I told you we have to do
a project in English class?

78
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,101
Yeah.

79
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,435
So, I gotta go.

80
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,470
Okay.

81
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,530
Oh!

82
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,366
Crap, Mom.

83
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,937
Hi, Gulls.

84
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,773
Get off the
sidewalk, will ya?

85
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,742
Yeah, in a couple years,
when you're taller.

86
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,112
But not yet.

87
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,714
What's this?

88
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,449
I just
busted my hand.

89
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:31,850
How'd you do that?

90
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,119
Just fell.

91
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,587
You didn't
write me about it.

92
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,889
It's not a big deal.

93
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,458
What, don't kids
sign casts anymore?

94
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,894
Not really.

95
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,829
And this is what
you have to wear?

96
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,898
Yeah, sixth grade.

97
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,766
Coming down the street, I
thought maybe you'd become

98
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,601
a lawyer
or something.

99
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,205
So, how's sixth grade?

100
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,708
You know, now I'm the youngest
in middle school,

101
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,111
instead of the oldest in lower,
so... you know, it's cool.

102
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,113
You mean, you're
picked on a bit?

103
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,681
Yeah, sometimes.

104
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,117
Is that how you got
your hand busted?

105
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,152
Nuh-uh.
I just fell.

106
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:14,293
Okay, well, uh... don't pick
back too much, okay?

107
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,728
I got a letter for you.

108
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,796
Oh, that's great, Gulls.
You know that I had to

109
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,431
look up "Cotillion"
from your last one.

110
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,766
Yeah? That's horrible.

111
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,303
So, what else... what else
is middle school like?

112
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,705
Well, it's
kind of the same.

113
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,708
It's boring. I have to read
<i>Johnny Tremain.</i>

114
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,844
What's that about?

115
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,712
This kid who makes silver bowls
with Paul Revere

116
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,781
and gets his hand burned.

117
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,817
You like it?

118
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,352
It's okay. Not really.

119
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,687
I can't finish it.

120
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,390
Yeah, and anyway,
silversmithing

121
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,192
will probably get in the
way of your lawyering.

122
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,527
Yeah.

123
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,165
How's your dad and Ellen?

124
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,501
Fine.

125
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,736
Yeah, you like her
any better now?

126
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,238
She's okay.

127
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,572
She's a pretty good cook,

128
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,709
but she gets angry
about the weirdest things.

129
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,444
Like what?

130
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,347
Like sometimes, after
I wash my hands,

131
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,982
she says I leave
the soap dirty.

132
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,250
What does that mean?

133
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,752
I know. It means I'm supposed
to wash the soap

134
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,388
after I wash my hands.

135
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,525
Well...

136
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:24,396
But sometimes when she talks to
her friends, she says things.

137
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,864
Like what?

138
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,934
Like once I heard her say--
about you, I guess--

139
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:33,372
that they wanted you
to get a... annulment?

140
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,940
That who wanted?

141
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,943
I guess Dad and Grandma.

142
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,445
Oh.

143
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,447
And I asked Eric
Muftie what that was,

144
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,349
and he said it was
something dirty.

145
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,350
A sex thing.

146
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,552
Who's Eric Muftie?

147
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,420
A kid in my class.

148
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,522
Well, Eric is wrong.

149
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,024
Good.

150
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,726
It's-It's not a...
it's not a sex thing at all.

151
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,727
Good.

152
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,796
It's sort of like a...

153
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,565
Sort of the same
thing as a divorce.

154
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh.

155
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,769
You already got one.

156
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,040
You don't really need to worry
about it, okay?

157
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,274
Okay.

158
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,110
I promise you,
Eric is wrong.

159
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,111
Good.

160
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,912
It's not a dirty
thing at all.

161
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,981
Okay.

162
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,182
Here's your letter.

163
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,619
Thanks, Gulls.
Got to get going.

164
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,827
Why can't you just
write to me at home?

165
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,295
Why? You don't
like Mr. Quinette?

166
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,731
He's nice, but sometimes
he isn't there.

167
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,299
So I think maybe
I missed one.

168
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,001
No, if there's a
letter, he'll be there.

169
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,736
Okay.

170
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,672
I think it's a pretty cool
system, don't you?

171
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,673
I guess.

172
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,674
A secret system.

173
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,808
Yeah.

174
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,111
Gulls, you got to keep it
a secret, okay?

175
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,446
I know.

176
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,947
And after you read
one of my letters,

177
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,449
make sure to just
throw them away, okay?

178
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,984
I do.

179
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,619
Good.

180
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,853
Okay, tell me more.

181
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,855
Are you on a team?
- Yeah.

182
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,023
Soccer, but B team.

183
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,425
What position?
- Left wing.

184
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,592
Left wing. Really?

185
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,860
That's pretty hard, right?

186
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,730
You got to be kicking
with your left foot a lot.

187
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,098
Yeah.
- How are you?

188
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,934
Okay. I mean, it's B team,
so it's mostly 'tards.

189
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,804
Well, better to be a big
fish in a small pond.

190
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,206
Even if all the other fish
are 'tard fish?

191
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:18,644
Yeah. Even then.

192
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,346
I, uh...

193
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,181
I should stop here.

194
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,383
When are you coming back?

195
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,952
Well, it'll be sooner
than last time.

196
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,320
Probably a couple of weeks.

197
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,588
Two weeks?

198
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,123
Probably three.
- No, four.

199
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,491
No, definitely not four.

200
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,059
But send me
letters, okay?

201
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,627
Okay.

202
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,401
Okay.

203
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,572
Keep your nose
clean, kid.

204
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,574
Okay.

205
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,377
Okay. I love you, Gulls.

206
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,578
Me, too.

207
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,213
Mm. Okay.

208
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,514
Now, go on.

209
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,983
I'll see you soon, okay?

210
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,218
Couple of weeks?

211
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,386
Yeah, a couple.

212
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,720
And try reading that
<i>Johnny</i>, uh,

213
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,856
what's-his-face book
one more time, okay?

214
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,891
I can't, Mom.
I swear, it's horrible.

215
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,228
Forget it. Forget it.

216
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,030
Go on, don't be late.

217
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,098
Okay.

218
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,994
Kailey, Jesus.

219
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,930
Look at you.

220
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,302
I know, I know,
I know.

221
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,137
I've been up for a few days.

222
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,672
I'm not so sure

223
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,241
it's the long
hours hurting you.

224
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,243
Yeah.

225
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,747
Well, I see Gulley
every day.

226
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,782
He looks good.

227
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,418
I saw him
this morning.

228
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,354
His arm's broken.

229
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,989
I saw that.

230
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,157
It's okay.

231
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,192
Yeah. He's
doing great.

232
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,461
He's a good kid.

233
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,066
Is there a game around?

234
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,668
You see anything?

235
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:59,371
Even if there
were, I mean...

236
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,306
you're a mess.

237
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,108
You got enough
for hotel room?

238
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:07,046
Yeah, but, uh, I'd rather
use it to get a game.

239
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,347
Want to sleep here a bit?

240
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,715
You mind?

241
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,216
Go ahead.

242
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,052
Thanks.

243
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,456
Come get me if there's something
I should be awake for, okay?

244
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,525
Got you.

245
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,913
How was that
English project?

246
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,515
The what?

247
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,018
That thing
you had to be in early for.

248
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,953
Oh. It was good.

249
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,955
Yeah? What book
was it on?

250
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,492
Gulley?

251
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,861
It wasn't
a book.

252
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,863
It was...

253
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,632
We had to make
an advertisement.

254
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,900
Oh. For what?

255
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,635
Well, everybody got
different things.

256
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,803
What did you get?

257
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:38,971
Hot chocolate.
- Huh.

258
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,139
In English class?

259
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,473
Why would they do that?

260
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,841
I don't know.

261
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,476
They didn't
give you a reason?

262
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,412
No, they did.

263
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,384
Well, what was it?

264
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,585
Gulls, your dad's
talking to you.

265
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,787
Don't call me Gulls.

266
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:55,888
Hey.

267
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,456
Lose the tone, young man.

268
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,458
Now, what was
the reason?

269
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,761
My teacher says

270
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,565
that poets sometimes make
advertisements for money.

271
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,269
So, instead of writing
a poem, we could do an ad.

272
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,670
Hmm.

273
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,106
Swear to God,
if it was up to me,

274
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,575
you'd be in
public school so fast.

275
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,377
So, how'd you do?

276
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,978
We won.
- You did?

277
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,547
With hot chocolate?
- Yeah.

278
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,415
Well, what
was your ad?

279
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,551
We made a picture
of some mountains

280
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,020
with a cottage and smoke
coming out of the chimney,

281
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,822
and we called it
Jungfrau Hot Chocolate.

282
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,524
Jungfrau. What's that?

283
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,159
It's a mountain in Switzerland.

284
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,495
No, it isn't.

285
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,696
Yes, it is.

286
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,665
Jungfrau?

287
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,966
Yeah.

288
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,945
It's nice you won.

289
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,527
It's not pronounced that way.

290
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,561
But it's real?

291
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,864
But it's pronounced Yung Frow.

292
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,666
But it exists.

293
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,134
Not pronounced that way,
it doesn't.

294
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,812
Hey.

295
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,814
Hi.

296
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,919
Do me a favor, okay?

297
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,421
Sure.

298
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,090
Maybe don't lecture me
on mountains in Switzerland.

299
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,159
I-I didn't think...

300
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,361
You might think you know
everything under the sun,

301
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,595
but trust me, you don't.

302
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,864
I know.

303
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,199
Just don't
lecture me.

304
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,834
Think you can
handle that?

305
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,670
Okay.

306
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,240
Terrific.

307
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,919
Well, good morning.

308
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,454
Hey.

309
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,022
How'd you sleep?
- Terrific.

310
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,128
Place looks a little better.

311
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,463
Oh, yeah.

312
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,298
It's great for
a week night.

313
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,136
There a game here?

314
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,105
Yeah, maybe.

315
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,639
That kid in the
stupid track suit--

316
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,109
he'll play you.

317
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,178
But he only plays
ten dollar racks.

318
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,247
That won't even be gas money.

319
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,784
Who are the guys
playing one pocket?

320
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,953
The older guy

321
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:42,888
is Duncan.

322
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,090
The other fella--
I don't know his name.

323
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,291
He's gonna quit soon.

324
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,660
I ain't never seen him
won a game yet.

325
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,962
Okay. I'll try for Duncan.

326
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,264
That's gonna
be a hard

327
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,699
game to get.

328
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:54,900
He's good.

329
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,936
He'll also try
to negotiate weight.

330
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,506
Should I give him any?

331
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,740
No! He's good.

332
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,075
All right, I'll be

333
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,176
back in an hour.

334
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,811
Keep him here
if he wants a game.

335
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,163
Hey, is Markus there?

336
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,165
You got a number for him?

337
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,703
Okay, well, uh,
maybe if you run into him.

338
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,573
I know, but maybe
if you just happen to see him,

339
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,942
can you tell him
that Kailey's in the city,

340
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,610
and to keep an eye out?

341
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,447
Kailey. K-A-I-L-E-Y.

342
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,516
He'll know.

343
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,657
For Gulls tomorrow.

344
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,568
You Duncan?

345
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,070
I am, yeah.

346
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:40,172
Kailey.

347
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,540
It's nice to meet you.

348
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,475
Want to play
some one pocket?

349
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,910
Maybe. For what?

350
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,346
I don't know.

351
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,214
20 a game.

352
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,117
Okay. Give me two balls.

353
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,486
No. Can't.

354
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,755
Quinn says I can't
give any weight.

355
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,023
He does, huh?

356
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,459
He does, and
he's a fair guy.

357
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,127
Is he staking you?

358
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,530
No.

359
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,532
Okay.

360
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,500
Maybe. But he's wrong.

361
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,135
I don't know.

362
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,404
Seemed to play okay
earlier tonight.

363
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,006
I was playing
against Mike Simms.

364
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,240
Play him every week.

365
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,809
Beat him every week.

366
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,944
He's a degenerate.
He loves to lose.

367
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:20,946
It's no reflection.

368
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,249
How about no weight,

369
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,952
but a guaranteed renegotiation
after five games?

370
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,054
Okay, but we play
for a hundred a rack.

371
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,523
Okay.

372
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,992
Lack for break.

373
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,894
No, I'll give you the break.

374
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,429
I'll take
the right pocket.

375
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,508
Seven ball.

376
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:10,949
Nice games.

377
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,951
Maybe you should be
giving me a ball.

378
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,087
Nope.
- But out, Quinn.

379
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,488
I'll give her a ball.

380
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,790
Nope, she's gonna quit.

381
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,428
What the fuck Quinn?!

382
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:24,329
You pull me off a game
just when the dipshit's

383
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:25,964
about to give me a ball?!

384
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,833
Jesus fucking shit!

385
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,202
He ain't a dipshit.
He still would've took ya.

386
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,804
Fuck you.

387
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,038
Oh, fuck yourself.

388
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:34,907
You're playing like shit, Kai.

389
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,308
I know it. You know it.

390
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:37,376
You're wrong.
- No.

391
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:39,345
I easily had the last game.

392
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,447
You barely got the last game.
I don't know what's

393
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,449
on your mind, but,
you know, you're not

394
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,217
playing half-way decent.

395
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:46,318
Where are you going?

396
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:47,686
To find a fucking game.

397
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:49,988
Well, go get it.

398
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,994
Kai! Kai!

399
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,301
I thought you
hated this city.

400
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,470
More and more
every fucking day.

401
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,704
How are you Markus?

402
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:06,939
I'm all right.

403
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,041
Uh, I'm not really a
running kind of guy, so...

404
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,011
Thank you.

405
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,813
Oh, what are you doing in town?

406
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,415
Trying to get out.

407
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:19,685
Oh, that should be easy enough.
- No.

408
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:21,887
Really out.
Oh.

409
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:24,356
I'm thinking Canada out.

410
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:27,526
Oh.
You could do that, right?

411
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,361
I could, yeah.

412
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:31,363
How much would that be?

413
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:32,531
$10,000, thereabout...

414
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,766
There'll be two of us.

415
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,868
Twenty.

416
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,237
He's a kid.

417
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,773
Oh, that's...
that's different, Kai.

418
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,107
Yeah, I figured.

419
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:44,343
No, I mean, that's
really different.

420
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:46,078
I can get you
a passport,

421
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:48,380
get you into Canada,
no problem, but...

422
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:49,748
traveling with a kid?

423
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:51,750
<i>That is way different.</i>

424
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:54,853
They look hard-- single
adults traveling with kids.

425
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,423
Passport'd have to be
fucking bomb-proof.

426
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,491
Can you still do it?

427
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,996
Maybe, uh...

428
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,397
the price goes up.

429
00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:07,132
How much up?

430
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,233
Fifty, at least.

431
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,541
How long?

432
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,543
Couple of weeks.

433
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,515
Let's do it.

434
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,384
Where are you going?

435
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:27,353
To raise your fucking money.

436
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,188
What about Mexico?

437
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,457
I don't speak Spanish, Markus.

438
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:33,459
Mexico's nice.

439
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,960
Hey, uh...

440
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,561
Jameson neat, water back.

441
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:20,839
Thanks.

442
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:30,849
Four Buds.

443
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:34,119
Are those guys your boyfriends?

444
00:27:35,588 --> 00:27:37,523
What?

445
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,158
Why don't you invite
me on your team?

446
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:41,360
What?

447
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:42,361
Invite me on your team.

448
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:43,629
Why?

449
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:45,230
Because it might
be fun to beat them.

450
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,537
Take my place.

451
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,272
Really?

452
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,941
Yeah. Fucking hate this game.

453
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,978
That guy your boyfriend?

454
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,980
Depends on who you ask.

455
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,049
I suppose I'll ask you.

456
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:06,385
Nope.

457
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,921
Okay, then.

458
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,393
She's playing for Kat.

459
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:15,527
What?

460
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:17,496
She's on my team.
Okay.

461
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:19,298
No, no, who the
fuck is this?

462
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,400
Come on, let's play.
It'd be fun.

463
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,369
Lady, this isn't, uh...

464
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:24,536
like, you know,
an open thing.

465
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:26,705
Come on. It'll be fun.

466
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:29,675
Seriously.
Fuck off.

467
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:31,043
No, Brad.

468
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:33,212
Let her play.

469
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,180
Okay. Here's, uh...

470
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:36,849
hundred dollars.

471
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,183
I'm gonna play you

472
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:40,519
or the both of you.
I'm gonna play with--

473
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:41,720
sorry, what's your name again?
Charlotte.

474
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,489
Charlotte here...
and we'll beat you.

475
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,459
Okay.

476
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,228
But, uh, both
of us play you.

477
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,764
Sure. Do you
have a hundred dollars?

478
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,199
Bitch.

479
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:55,367
Nice talk.

480
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:56,502
Go ahead and break.

481
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,221
Fuck!

482
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:17,723
Do you want to go?

483
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,558
You can.

484
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:20,926
Nah, go for it.

485
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:33,605
Uh, take the three.
Which one?

486
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,174
Just hit it right there,

487
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:37,409
and it'll roll down the side.

488
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,085
Sorry.

489
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,724
Don't fucking choke.

490
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,559
Just sink
a fucking ball.

491
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,365
Oh!

492
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,144
Fuck you!

493
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:47,446
Fuck!

494
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,281
Don't worry.
Just aim for my finger.

495
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,283
Okay.

496
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:57,022
Just aim for my finger.

497
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,034
You're a fucking bitch.

498
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:10,069
Take it easy, man.

499
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:11,970
Get the fuck out of here.

500
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,006
You owe me a hundred dollars.

501
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:18,510
You missed that shot on purpose.

502
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:19,912
Probably.

503
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,915
You still owe me
a hundred dollars.

504
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,650
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

505
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,452
You fucking bitch!

506
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:39,565
Is she here?

507
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:40,799
No, why?

508
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:42,735
Because it was
not mailed.

509
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:45,404
Well, she gave me
that before she left.

510
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:49,241
Oh. Hang around
if you'd like, kiddo.

511
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:53,912
Okay.

512
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,624
What time is it?

513
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:07,126
About 6:00.

514
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:09,194
When?

515
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,196
Wednesday afternoon.

516
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,002
What are you looking at?

517
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,371
I'm just checking you out.

518
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,007
I heard you're
not supposed

519
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,742
to let someone
hit in the head

520
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,611
sleep for very long,
but every time I try

521
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,680
to wake you up,
you take a swing at me.

522
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:28,947
So I thought I'd just...

523
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:32,117
sit here and watch you.

524
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:34,787
To see if I'd just
stop breathing?

525
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:42,461
Don't need any stitches,
but I'd leave

526
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:44,463
the bandage on.

527
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,569
So what was that
about last night?

528
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,572
I just wanted a game.

529
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,274
You win?
- Yup.

530
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:56,642
How much?

531
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,312
You didn't win shit.

532
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,647
Give me a break.

533
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,418
What's that?

534
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,354
About two thou.

535
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:11,557
Enough for you
to get out of here and...

536
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,425
catch a little rest.

537
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,361
You're a mess.

538
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:17,896
I know I'm a mess.

539
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:22,167
I got coldcocked
by some dipshit frat boy.

540
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:24,203
I can't hustle a game
to save my life,

541
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,804
I got blood all over my clothes,

542
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:27,673
and I seem to be
throwing up a lot.

543
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:28,941
I know I'm a mess, Quinn.

544
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,710
What's that throwing up about?

545
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:33,712
Nervous, I guess.

546
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,848
What are you nervous about?

547
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,619
I'm going to get him back.

548
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,256
Kai, you don't even have
visitation rights

549
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:46,225
let alone custody.

550
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:47,393
I know.

551
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,994
It would be kidnapping.

552
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:50,229
I know.

553
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:51,630
Eventually,
they'll come looking for you.

554
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:52,898
Not eventually.

555
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:54,767
I'll be the first person
they come looking for.

556
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,169
I'm his mother.

557
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:01,740
And I have a record.

558
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:03,008
You do?

559
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,678
Yep.
- What for?

560
00:34:05,745 --> 00:34:07,713
Running a card room.

561
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:09,581
They put you in jail for that?

562
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:10,816
180 days.

563
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:12,117
Fuck!

564
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:13,352
Small town.

565
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,688
And one bitch came in
and made a huge racket.

566
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:18,090
Who?

567
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:20,826
Gulley's grandmother, Abigail.

568
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:23,896
I worked in
a town bar,

569
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:27,132
and I, uh...
had a card game in back.

570
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:31,003
One side of town
was a little college

571
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,638
with a bunch of rich kids

572
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:35,374
who couldn't play for shit,
but they could drink.

573
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:38,143
And the other side
was a... seminary

574
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,846
with a few young men
who could do both,

575
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,848
usually pretty well.

576
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:47,720
Gulley's dad was from
the seminary side.

577
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:50,389
You were dating a priest?

578
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:51,924
He got kicked out.

579
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,227
I got pregnant,

580
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:58,497
and he proposed and...

581
00:34:58,565 --> 00:35:01,834
For a couple weeks
it was fantastic.

582
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:06,805
I had this...

583
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:09,508
funny, handsome
19-year-old husband,

584
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:13,212
and I was going to be a mother.

585
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:19,785
Then a shitstorm named
Abigail rolled in.

586
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:21,720
Next thing I know,
David disappears,

587
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,189
I get brought up
on a whole load of charges,

588
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:27,593
and I'm now three months
pregnant.

589
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,799
And Abby made me a deal.

590
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:35,901
Give up the baby,
get a divorce,

591
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:39,872
she'd do whatever she could
to make things easier.

592
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:44,309
I couldn't say no.

593
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:46,745
I mean, I was 25 years old.

594
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,548
I was going to lose the kid
either way.

595
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:55,254
So while I appreciate the cash,
it isn't going to be enough.

596
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:03,862
You can't tell me
anymore about this.

597
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,831
I know.

598
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,839
I own the pool hall,

599
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,908
the rent here is cheap.

600
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:18,711
I'm just too old to start
fucking things up now.

601
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,116
Can you help me
set up some games?

602
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,151
How much you need?

603
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,319
I-I don't know yet.

604
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:29,088
I, uh...

605
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:31,890
thinking around $60,000.

606
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,459
Jesus!

607
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:35,427
You going to offer me
a drink, or what?

608
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:46,572
You can't raise that
by just grabbing games.

609
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,007
Okay.

610
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:49,341
Did you think
you could?

611
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:51,176
I hadn't really
thought that far.

612
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,178
Ah, crap.

613
00:36:57,517 --> 00:37:00,319
What about that guy I you off?

614
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,187
Duncan.

615
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:03,355
Yeah.

616
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:04,723
Maybe him.

617
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,225
Okay.
- Yeah.

618
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,559
Maybe.

619
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:10,963
Listen, I don't want to know
anymore about it.

620
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,667
Okay.

621
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:20,439
Gulley, come set the table.

622
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:21,607
Okay.

623
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:22,808
Use the nice napkins.

624
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:24,109
Your grandma's
coming over.

625
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:26,078
I know.

626
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,581
I'm coming.

627
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:34,119
Abby hasn't seen you for awhile
so maybe put on a nice shirt.

628
00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:35,621
Okay.

629
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:37,823
Remember how I had
to work last weekend?

630
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,526
I don't know.

631
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:42,695
Well, I did
and we couldn't get to mass.

632
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:43,862
Yeah.

633
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,532
Well, Abby may ask,
and let's just...

634
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,701
avoid it, okay?

635
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,736
Sure.

636
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:52,738
Okay.

637
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:56,075
Go help Ellen.

638
00:37:56,142 --> 00:37:58,010
Okay.

639
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:16,195
Ellen, this is good.

640
00:38:16,262 --> 00:38:17,296
What is this?

641
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:18,497
It's called escarole.

642
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:27,373
How's the world
of real estate?

643
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,808
Busy. People always want
to buy new apartments.

644
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:33,912
I wouldn't want people coming
and going through my house.

645
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,115
It feels like snooping.

646
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:37,816
I don't go through
their drawers.

647
00:38:37,884 --> 00:38:38,984
You look in their
closets, I bet.

648
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:40,452
That's not snooping, Mom.

649
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,955
I'm just doing my job.

650
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:49,194
And school for you, Gulley?

651
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:50,696
It's good.

652
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:52,498
Good.

653
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:58,671
He won an English thing the
other day, didn't you, Gulls?

654
00:38:58,738 --> 00:38:59,838
Yeah.

655
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:01,140
Well, I like that school.

656
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:02,541
It's good, yeah.

657
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:04,276
How are your catechism classes?

658
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:05,811
They're fine.

659
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:08,380
You work hard there, too.

660
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:12,785
Remember what your grandfather
used to say?

661
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:16,021
"You got to take the bitter
with the lousy."

662
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,826
Jesus!

663
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:23,462
What a thing to remember.

664
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:26,965
No.

665
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:30,669
"Eternity is a hell
of a long time."

666
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:32,304
Right.

667
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:35,207
Seriously, Gulley,
apply yourself.

668
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:37,676
I do.

669
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:39,778
He could work harder.

670
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:46,819
How was, uh, late
mass last week?

671
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,354
It was fine.

672
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:49,688
Who did the early?

673
00:39:49,756 --> 00:39:51,023
Cavanaugh.

674
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:52,024
Really?

675
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:53,992
We got Smoltz.

676
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,261
Were there guitars?

677
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,663
No.

678
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,932
God, I hate those guitars.

679
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,235
And then they start
singing the Lord's Prayer.

680
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:05,971
I mean, what in hell do these
people think they're doing?

681
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,172
I don't know.

682
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:10,376
Gulley, remember,

683
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:12,878
just because a thing is new

684
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:14,446
it doesn't
make it good.

685
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:15,848
Okay.

686
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,951
It makes my skin crawl to hear
that stupid, damn singing.

687
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,786
I know.

688
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:24,189
So let's all go together
to Cavanaugh on Sunday.

689
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:25,891
Okay.

690
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,727
When the three of you
go on your own,

691
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:32,164
Gulley, do you go by yourself
to get Communion?

692
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:33,532
Of course.

693
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,634
I'm asking Gulley.

694
00:40:35,702 --> 00:40:37,403
Sure. It's not that hard.

695
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:40,239
But it's important.

696
00:40:40,306 --> 00:40:43,075
I know.

697
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:44,777
She's just never
going to let it go.

698
00:40:44,844 --> 00:40:46,111
Snooping? Jesus.

699
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:48,547
She has, it's just her way.

700
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:49,782
Well, it ridiculous.

701
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,216
You left the seminary
12 years ago.

702
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,651
Give it a fucking rest.

703
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,153
It's not that, Ellen.

704
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,121
If there's one thing that
woman adores, it's Gulley,

705
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:57,756
and he wouldn't even
exist if you...

706
00:40:57,824 --> 00:40:58,957
That's not what it is.

707
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,359
Then what, the divorce?
Yes.

708
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:01,927
It's not a big deal.

709
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:04,563
It is to her
and to everybody in there.

710
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,331
It's a big deal.

711
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:08,000
Every time she takes Gulley
for Communion,

712
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,069
and I just stay there
in the pew...

713
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:13,339
it is a big deal, Ellen.

714
00:41:13,406 --> 00:41:14,973
I'm standing there with you.

715
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,809
No, it's different.

716
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:20,579
And don't say
he's the only thing she adores.

717
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:24,316
Really, who's next on the list,
her housecleaner?

718
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:42,101
Who are you writing letters to?

719
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:44,136
What?

720
00:41:44,204 --> 00:41:45,771
I saw a letter
on your desk before.

721
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,339
Who are you writing letters to?

722
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:49,274
It's not a letter.

723
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:50,876
Don't lie to me.

724
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:53,412
So who the hell are you writing
our business to?

725
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,780
"Grandma's coming
for dinner tonight."

726
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:56,849
Uh, "I'm trying to keep
the soap clean."

727
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,150
I mean, what the hell is that?

728
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,852
I said it's not a letter.

729
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:01,387
Gulley...
- It's not.

730
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:03,889
Then what is it?

731
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:05,958
A diary.

732
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,228
A diary?

733
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:10,362
Yeah.

734
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:13,298
Jesus.

735
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:16,869
What are you,
a nine-year-old girl?

736
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:47,333
Hello, Gulley.

737
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,434
How's school?

738
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,535
It's good.

739
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:51,704
Here you go.
- Great. Thanks.

740
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:10,189
Well, holy shit,
where have you been?

741
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:12,157
I got stuck
in the city for a bit.

742
00:43:12,225 --> 00:43:13,525
How was it?

743
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:14,893
It was good.

744
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:16,829
How have things been here?

745
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:18,597
Same ol'.

746
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,165
Game tonight?

747
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:21,300
Sure.

748
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:24,370
Probably go easier
on Randolph though.

749
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:25,738
He still pissed?

750
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:28,340
Just doesn't like
getting rivered is all.

751
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:29,775
No one does.

752
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:31,810
You want a beer?

753
00:43:31,878 --> 00:43:32,978
Uh, yeah.

754
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:34,813
Yeah, and maybe a whiskey.

755
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:36,749
You sure you want to
be double-fisting?

756
00:43:36,816 --> 00:43:38,217
You've looked
better, you know.

757
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:39,718
Yeah, I hear that.

758
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,721
Hi, Abby. It's Ellen.

759
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,024
Um, you probably aren't
back from mass yet,

760
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:46,692
but we couldn't make it.

761
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,994
Um, Gulley had
a fever this morning,

762
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:50,662
so I just put him
back in bed.

763
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,766
But, uh, we'll try and swing by
later this afternoon.

764
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:56,835
Okay? See you soon.

765
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:09,882
Are you feeling
better?

766
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:11,216
I am, yeah.

767
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:13,152
What was it
you think?

768
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:16,021
Just a kid thing.

769
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:17,956
So, not the escarole.

770
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:19,658
No, I don't think so.

771
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:20,693
Well,

772
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,695
you missed Father Cavanaugh.

773
00:44:22,762 --> 00:44:24,697
He was good,

774
00:44:24,764 --> 00:44:26,932
but it was Sunday

775
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,269
so he was playing
to the Sunday only.

776
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:34,306
Lots of Galilee
and "fisher of men."

777
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:38,510
Do you know why Christ
is a fisher of men, Gulley?

778
00:44:38,578 --> 00:44:42,181
'Cause he likes
catching people.

779
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:43,816
Are you being wise?

780
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:45,784
No.

781
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:47,619
I might be wrong
about that school.

782
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:49,955
David!

783
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:51,357
You have a nosebleed.

784
00:44:51,424 --> 00:44:52,858
He's been getting
these sometimes.

785
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:54,026
Here, hon.

786
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:57,396
Thanks.

787
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:59,732
Have you been to a doctor
for God's sake?

788
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:01,734
It's just a bloody nose, Mom.

789
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:03,469
I'm fine.

790
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,894
That was even less than a week.
- I know.

791
00:45:28,962 --> 00:45:30,729
That's better right?
Come on.

792
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:32,231
Got to get
our picture take.

793
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:34,099
Why?
- 'Cause the only one I have of you

794
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,768
you're like two day old
or something.

795
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:36,869
Okay.

796
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:39,338
Oh, uh, I wrote down
what I do everyday.

797
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,340
It's pretty
boring.

798
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:43,342
Thanks, Gulls.
- Sure.

799
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,611
See your grandma
yesterday?

800
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,179
Yeah.
How was that?

801
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:49,214
Okay. It gave me a headache.
- Yeah?

802
00:45:49,282 --> 00:45:51,717
Yeah and dad got
a bloody nose.

803
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:53,752
How?
- I don't know, it just happened.

804
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,088
You sure your grandma
didn't punch him?

805
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:00,993
Do I look like that?

806
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,328
Still look
like a lawyer.

807
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:05,998
Hey, how's
the Paul Revere guy?

808
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:08,000
It's done.
- You finished it?

809
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:10,169
No, but we had the test
already.

810
00:46:10,236 --> 00:46:12,104
How'd it go?
- I don't know yet.

811
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:14,173
I got Eric Mufti
to tell me how it ended,

812
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,774
so that helped.

813
00:46:15,842 --> 00:46:18,310
Well, I can tell this
Mufti guy ain't much of a genius.

814
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:20,446
Yeah, but he's okay.

815
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:22,448
Yeah?
- Yeah.

816
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:27,119
I have to ask you
a question.

817
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,121
Okay.

818
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:31,290
It's not really
a fair question.

819
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:32,958
What do you mean?

820
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:35,394
Uh, I think you're too
young to ask it to.

821
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:38,397
That's okay.

822
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:41,400
How would you like
to come live with me for a bit?

823
00:46:45,605 --> 00:46:47,873
Uh, it'd be very
different, you know.

824
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:49,375
Lots a, a lot
of changes.

825
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:51,210
Yeah.
- I mean different school, different city,

826
00:46:51,277 --> 00:46:53,345
all of that.
- I know.

827
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:55,514
What about missing Eric?

828
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:58,517
I wouldn't miss him
that much.

829
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:01,820
What about missing
your dad?

830
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:08,727
Dad found the letter.

831
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:09,895
Oh.

832
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:12,064
But he didn't know
it was to you.

833
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:14,066
Oh, well, that's
okay then.

834
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:16,735
Yeah, but still,
he was mad about it

835
00:47:16,803 --> 00:47:19,738
and this is going
to make him really, really mad.

836
00:47:19,806 --> 00:47:21,573
Yeah.

837
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:22,741
No, I know it will.

838
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:24,176
And it will make
Abby mad, too,

839
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:25,344
but you know what?

840
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:26,812
You won't be around
to see it

841
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,914
so you don't have to
worry about it, okay?

842
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:30,949
Okay.

843
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:33,986
Okay-Okay you want
to do it?

844
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:36,155
Uh-huh.

845
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:37,856
You gotta make sure

846
00:47:37,924 --> 00:47:39,491
you see Mr. Quinette
every single day, okay.

847
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:40,826
'Cause we can't
see each other.

848
00:47:40,894 --> 00:47:42,828
Yeah.

849
00:47:44,497 --> 00:47:46,432
And listen...

850
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:49,435
if we do this,
where we're going,

851
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:52,871
there might not be any
cotillions or any of that fancy stuff.

852
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:54,873
Is that going
to be okay?

853
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:56,875
Yeah.
- Okay.

854
00:47:56,943 --> 00:47:59,478
Try and keep your
nose clean, okay.

855
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:12,157
How was the trip?
- Good.

856
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:14,159
Coffee?
- Yeah, please.

857
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:15,828
Got any money left?

858
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:17,996
I made a couple hundred
in a card game.

859
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:19,665
Okay!

860
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,668
Come on, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

861
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:26,271
This is Ralph.

862
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:27,439
Uh...

863
00:48:27,507 --> 00:48:28,607
hey, Ralph.

864
00:48:28,675 --> 00:48:30,909
I want you

865
00:48:30,977 --> 00:48:32,911
to play him.

866
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:35,080
Okay, uh, what do you
want to play, Ralph?

867
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:39,785
One pocket.

868
00:48:39,853 --> 00:48:41,787
$100 a rack.

869
00:49:48,755 --> 00:49:50,689
How you doing?

870
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:52,191
Good. I'm up.

871
00:49:52,258 --> 00:49:54,193
How much?
$600.

872
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,195
Out of how many racks?

873
00:49:57,697 --> 00:49:59,665
14.

874
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,033
I got to say the
kid's good,

875
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:02,634
but I'm shooting the
lights out of him.

876
00:50:04,738 --> 00:50:06,839
It was nice meeting
you, ma'am.

877
00:50:06,906 --> 00:50:09,341
You're a good shot.

878
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,343
What the fuck was that?

879
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:13,379
That was an audition.

880
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:15,381
For him or me?

881
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:16,815
For him.

882
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,550
Remember Billy Victor?

883
00:50:18,618 --> 00:50:20,552
California guy.

884
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,721
That's his kid,
Ralphie.

885
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:26,125
I gave him a grand.

886
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:28,127
Out of the two
that I offered you.

887
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:29,361
I told him,

888
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:33,198
"You lose $600 exactly.

889
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:35,200
"Don't tip your hand

890
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:37,336
"and get your best game,

891
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:40,506
you can keep the $400."

892
00:50:40,573 --> 00:50:42,608
That kid was laying down?

893
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:45,544
Bullshit!

894
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:47,112
There's no way that
kid could beat me.

895
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,480
Oh, I don't know
whether he can

896
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:52,184
or he can't, but I do know
that he can lose to you.

897
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:55,187
And that's better
for us.

898
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:57,523
Why?
-'Cause you're not going to get this game

899
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,359
for 60 K all by yourself.

900
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:02,361
You need a stalking horse

901
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:05,497
and I believe we got him.

902
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:07,966
Jesus Christ, Quinn, could you
at least give me a head's up

903
00:51:08,034 --> 00:51:09,635
when you're doing
shit like this?

904
00:51:09,703 --> 00:51:10,969
Why?

905
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:13,439
If he can take
a fall to you,

906
00:51:13,506 --> 00:51:15,007
he can convince
anybody.

907
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:17,009
So give me
my $600 back.

908
00:51:18,611 --> 00:51:20,579
Oh, listen to me,

909
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:23,582
there's no way he could
take you straight up.

910
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:27,186
Controlled losing
is not winning.

911
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:31,957
Hey, see that guy
over there.

912
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:33,125
Is that guy lurking around
for you?

913
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:34,526
Yeah.

914
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:36,161
He's clearly not here
for the pool.

915
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:37,196
He's just

916
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:38,797
drawing attention
to himself.

917
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:40,666
Would you get him
the hell out of here?

918
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:42,668
Yeah.

919
00:51:45,605 --> 00:51:48,774
This is a ridiculous game.

920
00:51:48,842 --> 00:51:50,843
'Cause you suck at it.
- Yeah, I do, I know.

921
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,711
But I mean, it doesn't
even have the appeal

922
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,179
to try to get
better for it.

923
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,448
I mean, it's just,
it's irritating.

924
00:51:56,516 --> 00:51:58,117
That's 'cause
you suck at it.

925
00:51:58,184 --> 00:52:00,119
Come on.

926
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:05,224
<i>Don't get too excited.</i>

927
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,759
It's just the photos.

928
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:07,926
Okay.

929
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,261
I'll have
the money soon.

930
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,596
I'm not worried,
uh, you know.

931
00:52:10,663 --> 00:52:12,231
They'll be ready in
a couple of days.

932
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:14,233
Come here.

933
00:52:15,835 --> 00:52:17,670
What?
- Look, I need you to do something,

934
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:19,672
besides get me
my money.

935
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:22,841
I want you to figure out
where you're going to cross.

936
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:24,076
What do you mean?

937
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:25,944
Well, these are going
to be good.

938
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:28,213
They're going to be as good
as anything you've ever seen.

939
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,616
But, since you've got a kid,

940
00:52:30,684 --> 00:52:32,284
you try to go through
a major airport,

941
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:34,119
like, uh, Toronto
or Vancouver,

942
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:35,354
you're just asking

943
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,256
for trouble.
- We're driving.

944
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:38,924
Yeah, but still, um...

945
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:41,927
like Niagara Falls,
still stupid.

946
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:43,929
Okay.
- Okay.

947
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:45,831
Uh, you taking your own car?

948
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:47,833
No, no, I won it
in a card game.

949
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:49,401
But the guy keeps
holding the paper

950
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:50,803
thinking he can
get it back.

951
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,438
That's a dumb guy.

952
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:53,472
Hey, uh...

953
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,873
Markus...

954
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:56,975
What? What?
- I need one more thing.

955
00:52:57,043 --> 00:52:58,277
A gun.

956
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:01,113
Look,

957
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:04,717
that's not the kind of thing you
say in just like a talky voice.

958
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:06,318
Doesn't have to work.

959
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:07,820
In fact, I don't
even need bullets.

960
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:09,254
But it should look good.
- No.

961
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:11,457
There's reason in the world
you need a pretend gun.

962
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:13,492
You either need a real one
or you don't.

963
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,428
No, I need a real looking
pretend one.

964
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,809
Hey, Quinn!

965
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:07,146
Quinn, get up!

966
00:54:07,213 --> 00:54:09,982
I got breakfast.

967
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,817
Quinn!

968
00:54:11,885 --> 00:54:14,153
...I don't eat
breakfast!

969
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,155
Go away!

970
00:54:16,222 --> 00:54:17,823
Oh, for God's sakes.

971
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:20,159
You have to... oh.
Kailey, don't!

972
00:54:20,226 --> 00:54:22,461
Oh...
- Sorry.

973
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:38,510
Uh...

974
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:39,578
sorry again.

975
00:54:39,646 --> 00:54:40,746
You're making
my retirement

976
00:54:40,814 --> 00:54:43,582
difficult in many, many ways.

977
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,616
It just...

978
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:46,218
What?

979
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:51,256
I don't know, it just...

980
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:53,425
sorry.

981
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:56,428
Why the early morning
enthusiasm?

982
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:58,464
Here.

983
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:00,532
What's this?

984
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,901
Just some things to remember
when people come asking.

985
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,136
People?

986
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:05,604
Police people?

987
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:07,272
Probably.

988
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,274
Okay.

989
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:15,414
"She slept on top of
the table for a few days,

990
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,483
"and then
was gone.

991
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,319
She played
lots of pool."

992
00:55:20,387 --> 00:55:23,489
You could have slipped this
under the door.

993
00:55:23,556 --> 00:55:24,757
I already said I'm sorry.

994
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:26,959
Okay.

995
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:31,163
I need to set up the game soon.

996
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:33,799
Well, all we
can do is try.

997
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,842
Duncan plays this...
this guy Mike Simms every week,

998
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:46,879
and he beats him every week,
without fail.

999
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:48,280
First step,

1000
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:51,784
we got to get rid of
this degenerate Simms,

1001
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:53,686
and get
Duncan to play

1002
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:55,187
Ralphie Victor, and if

1003
00:55:55,255 --> 00:55:57,790
Ralphie does his job
the way we know he can,

1004
00:55:57,857 --> 00:56:00,159
Duncan should have a
good taste in his mouth

1005
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:02,127
when you come around.

1006
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:04,697
Okay. I'll get Markus
to distract Simms for us.

1007
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:06,265
Yeah, but you got

1008
00:56:06,332 --> 00:56:08,000
to keep your eye
on me, because...

1009
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:10,135
if you don't play
him just right,

1010
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:12,871
he'll slip the hook.

1011
00:56:12,939 --> 00:56:14,940
Okay. There's more
on the back. The letter.

1012
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,108
On-On the back.

1013
00:56:27,787 --> 00:56:29,488
"Don't lie for me.

1014
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,857
At all."

1015
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:33,859
You got it.

1016
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,796
It's not a sex thing.
- Yes, it is.

1017
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:39,198
It's not. I asked.

1018
00:56:39,265 --> 00:56:41,033
It is. Your mother
wanted an abortion.

1019
00:56:41,101 --> 00:56:42,234
It's not that.

1020
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:43,836
It's like an annuls.

1021
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:45,904
It's the same thing.
It's not.

1022
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:48,007
It's like a divorce,
but for the church.

1023
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:49,308
A divorce from God?

1024
00:56:49,376 --> 00:56:50,743
I guess.
- That's even worse then.

1025
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,644
Shut up, and she
didn't even get it.

1026
00:56:52,712 --> 00:56:53,479
But she wanted to.
- Shut up!

1027
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:55,374
Nice games.

1028
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:57,376
No more?

1029
00:57:57,444 --> 00:57:59,378
No.

1030
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,551
You want to play again?

1031
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,654
Come on.

1032
00:58:08,722 --> 00:58:09,755
I'll give you the ball

1033
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,223
I offered you before.

1034
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,624
No.

1035
00:58:12,692 --> 00:58:14,126
I'll give you two balls.

1036
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:16,295
What were we
playing before?

1037
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:17,796
A hundred a rack.

1038
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:19,932
Okay.

1039
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,934
Why don't we do five a rack,

1040
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:23,936
and I'll still take the weight.

1041
00:58:25,038 --> 00:58:27,306
Okay.

1042
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:30,175
But I'm not going
to give you the first break.

1043
00:58:30,243 --> 00:58:32,611
So we'll lag.

1044
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:44,623
Nice.

1045
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:27,693
We got to play
straight up.

1046
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:29,194
No more giving you weight.

1047
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:31,764
Okay. Let's go a
thousand a rack.

1048
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:33,766
Sure.

1049
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,601
This can't be
a cash game anymore.

1050
01:00:38,538 --> 01:00:40,472
Hey,

1051
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,208
go down and lock the door.

1052
01:00:57,691 --> 01:00:59,658
I thought you might like this.

1053
01:00:59,726 --> 01:01:01,126
What is it?

1054
01:01:01,194 --> 01:01:04,263
It's a book of poems
by Sherwood Anderson.

1055
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:07,199
He was a poet, but he worked
in advertising first.

1056
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:08,934
Oh.

1057
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:12,371
I just... I thought
you might like it.

1058
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:34,353
That it?

1059
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:37,156
How much am I down?

1060
01:02:37,223 --> 01:02:38,590
How much am I down?

1061
01:02:38,658 --> 01:02:40,059
7500.

1062
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:42,728
That's a lot.

1063
01:02:44,497 --> 01:02:47,466
You should quit.

1064
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:56,208
I'll play you
for $10,000 a rack,

1065
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:58,444
but I need a break first.

1066
01:02:58,511 --> 01:03:00,546
I'll be back in an hour or so.

1067
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:02,548
You be here?

1068
01:03:02,615 --> 01:03:04,383
I'll be here.

1069
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:07,152
It's back to being a cash game
from now on.

1070
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,921
Okay.

1071
01:03:12,759 --> 01:03:14,693
Okay.

1072
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:18,330
Here. Give him
one of these.

1073
01:03:18,398 --> 01:03:19,498
No, no.

1074
01:03:19,566 --> 01:03:21,333
Come on, eat it.
You'll need it.

1075
01:03:21,401 --> 01:03:23,435
And try to get a
rest, will you?

1076
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:24,770
Just stretch
out right here.

1077
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:26,071
What about you?

1078
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:27,506
Well, I'm fine.

1079
01:03:27,574 --> 01:03:30,376
I chewed most the enamel
off my teeth, but I'm fine.

1080
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:31,710
What have you
got there?

1081
01:03:31,778 --> 01:03:33,112
11, five.

1082
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:37,249
Okay. Plus,
that's seven, five he owes.

1083
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,251
This is, uh...

1084
01:03:41,588 --> 01:03:44,923
...25, 600 something.

1085
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:48,060
Shit.

1086
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:49,928
Lose two in a row,
we're through.

1087
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:51,263
What if he doesn't come back?

1088
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:52,564
Oh, he's coming back.

1089
01:03:52,632 --> 01:03:54,500
How do you know?
- Because he wants

1090
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:56,468
to beat your brains in,
that's why.

1091
01:03:56,536 --> 01:03:58,771
It's almost 5:00
in the morning.

1092
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:01,840
Now, listen, you
don't need to win

1093
01:04:01,908 --> 01:04:03,208
six games.

1094
01:04:03,276 --> 01:04:05,444
Win four.

1095
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:09,148
I'll make the
rest up in bets.

1096
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,282
And don't be surprised

1097
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,484
if he don't try
to fuck with you.

1098
01:04:12,552 --> 01:04:15,087
Like how?
- I don't know,

1099
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:19,792
but he'll do something to try
to knock you off your rhythm.

1100
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,180
Ten grand a rack.

1101
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:42,348
Yup.

1102
01:04:42,415 --> 01:04:43,515
Cash.

1103
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:44,650
Quinn's got mine.

1104
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:45,984
And Quinn's
friend has mine.

1105
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:51,990
Your dad would be sick.

1106
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:55,961
And we're playing
nine ball.

1107
01:04:56,029 --> 01:04:57,496
Raise to seven.

1108
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:59,765
What happened to one pocket?

1109
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:02,568
It went away. Problem?

1110
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:09,141
No problem.

1111
01:05:12,779 --> 01:05:14,480
What?

1112
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:17,716
Just seems a chumpy game for us.

1113
01:05:21,654 --> 01:05:23,589
You want to quit me?

1114
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:28,327
No, I'll play you.

1115
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,697
Just think
it's beneath us is all.

1116
01:05:34,734 --> 01:05:38,003
Well... I'll learn
to live with it.

1117
01:05:39,105 --> 01:05:41,040
Lag for the break.

1118
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,201
Nobody's going
to bet on this.

1119
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:10,836
This is his game.

1120
01:06:10,904 --> 01:06:12,871
You'll be lucky
to sink even one nine ball.

1121
01:06:12,939 --> 01:06:14,506
Fuck off, will you?

1122
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:29,074
I need a minute.

1123
01:08:29,142 --> 01:08:30,409
No way.

1124
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:31,744
I need a minute.
- No!

1125
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:33,045
Then it's a forfeit.

1126
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:34,046
The hell you say!

1127
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:35,347
You took a three-hour break
earlier!

1128
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:38,050
That wasn't in the middle
of a fucking game.

1129
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:40,853
She can take a
break at the end.

1130
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,554
She wants a break now,
it's a forfeit.

1131
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:44,223
All right.

1132
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,224
You guys, move.

1133
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:48,027
You okay?

1134
01:08:48,094 --> 01:08:49,028
Yeah.

1135
01:08:49,095 --> 01:08:50,829
You sure?
- Yeah.

1136
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:55,200
Okay.

1137
01:08:58,271 --> 01:09:00,906
And this isn't the middle
of the fucking game.

1138
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,043
Who did that?

1139
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:39,144
It's okay.

1140
01:09:39,212 --> 01:09:40,145
Your dad do that?

1141
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:42,181
No, just a kid at school.

1142
01:09:42,248 --> 01:09:43,816
That Muftie kid?

1143
01:09:43,883 --> 01:09:44,850
Yeah.

1144
01:09:44,918 --> 01:09:47,086
I told you that
kid was bad news.

1145
01:09:47,153 --> 01:09:49,088
Yeah, but you were great.

1146
01:09:49,155 --> 01:09:50,322
Yeah?

1147
01:09:51,424 --> 01:09:54,693
Well... it worked out.

1148
01:09:54,761 --> 01:09:55,928
All right, get out of here.

1149
01:09:55,995 --> 01:09:57,763
Okay?

1150
01:09:57,831 --> 01:09:58,997
Hey, uh, Gulls.

1151
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:02,201
Uh, tomorrow, when
you leave for school,

1152
01:10:02,268 --> 01:10:04,503
uh, pack some extra clothes
in your backpack, okay?

1153
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:08,173
And find some excuse to get
what's-her-face to walk you

1154
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:10,776
and leave the apartment
door unlocked.

1155
01:10:10,844 --> 01:10:11,777
Okay.

1156
01:10:11,845 --> 01:10:13,912
Oh, and meet me here.

1157
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:35,501
That should do you and give
you a little something extra.

1158
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:38,203
You reimburse yourself
a thousand?

1159
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:40,139
It was $400.

1160
01:10:40,206 --> 01:10:42,808
You're going to need
all you can get.

1161
01:10:45,612 --> 01:10:46,679
You should take it.

1162
01:10:46,746 --> 01:10:49,381
Nah.

1163
01:11:13,306 --> 01:11:15,240
Hey.

1164
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:19,144
What are you doing?

1165
01:11:19,212 --> 01:11:20,879
I just want
the broth.

1166
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:22,147
Okay.

1167
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:24,483
It's all in here.

1168
01:11:24,551 --> 01:11:26,685
Thanks.

1169
01:11:26,753 --> 01:11:28,554
There you go.

1170
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:29,555
All right, look.

1171
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:31,457
I took you at your word.

1172
01:11:31,524 --> 01:11:34,126
It's a fake gun,
but it looks real,

1173
01:11:34,194 --> 01:11:36,462
and if you put bullets
in it,

1174
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:39,498
it's going to blow up
in your face.

1175
01:11:39,566 --> 01:11:40,666
Thanks.

1176
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:42,534
And do me a favor, will you?
What's that?

1177
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:46,138
When you get there,
just, uh, you know,

1178
01:11:46,206 --> 01:11:49,575
send me a postcard
of a pool table or something

1179
01:11:49,642 --> 01:11:51,577
just to tell me
that you made it safe.

1180
01:11:52,645 --> 01:11:54,013
Thanks, Markus.

1181
01:11:59,519 --> 01:12:01,453
Okay.

1182
01:12:01,521 --> 01:12:02,454
Take care.

1183
01:12:05,058 --> 01:12:07,893
It's locked, it's locked.

1184
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:18,037
David.

1185
01:12:18,104 --> 01:12:20,906
David?

1186
01:12:20,974 --> 01:12:22,641
David.

1187
01:12:22,709 --> 01:12:23,909
David.

1188
01:12:27,213 --> 01:12:30,082
Kai?

1189
01:12:32,585 --> 01:12:33,619
What are you doing here?

1190
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:36,789
I was in town,
thought I'd say hi.

1191
01:12:36,856 --> 01:12:38,691
How'd you get in?

1192
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,125
Door was open.

1193
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:41,760
You have to buzz.

1194
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:43,762
Just followed
somebody in.

1195
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:44,897
Where's Gulley?

1196
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,868
He's at school.

1197
01:12:51,905 --> 01:12:52,905
Jesus.

1198
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:57,676
What are you doing here, Rings?

1199
01:13:00,814 --> 01:13:02,748
Don't call me that.

1200
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:05,150
Sorry.

1201
01:13:05,218 --> 01:13:07,886
So what are
you doing here?

1202
01:13:07,954 --> 01:13:09,321
Told you,
I was just in town.

1203
01:13:09,389 --> 01:13:10,389
Here,
brought you a coffee.

1204
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:11,390
You what?

1205
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,991
A coffee.

1206
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:19,531
Look at you.

1207
01:13:19,599 --> 01:13:20,666
All grown up.

1208
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:25,904
You want to know
what I've been up to?

1209
01:13:25,972 --> 01:13:28,907
What, like, the last, I don't
know, 11 years have been like?

1210
01:13:28,975 --> 01:13:29,908
No.

1211
01:13:29,976 --> 01:13:32,211
Yeah, you do.

1212
01:13:32,278 --> 01:13:36,582
How's Abby?

1213
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:39,451
Well, give her my best.

1214
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:45,090
He's been writing
to you, hasn't he?

1215
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:46,959
Those letters
were, were to you?

1216
01:13:48,628 --> 01:13:49,561
That lying brat.

1217
01:13:49,629 --> 01:13:50,996
David,
do me a favor.

1218
01:13:51,064 --> 01:13:53,732
C-Can we just,
just sit here for a sec?

1219
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,801
Please.

1220
01:13:58,371 --> 01:14:00,139
He wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

1221
01:14:00,206 --> 01:14:01,407
Yeah?

1222
01:14:01,474 --> 01:14:02,408
Like what?

1223
01:14:02,475 --> 01:14:04,209
Well... for one,

1224
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:07,046
you're making him take dancing
lessons, for God's sakes.

1225
01:14:07,113 --> 01:14:08,447
Give me a break.

1226
01:14:08,515 --> 01:14:10,516
And how he has to lie
about going to church

1227
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,384
and how he gets
into fights.

1228
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:13,652
Every kid gets
into fights.

1229
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,753
Yeah.

1230
01:14:14,821 --> 01:14:17,756
Not every kid has
to lie for his dad.

1231
01:14:19,659 --> 01:14:21,760
How'd he break his hand?

1232
01:14:21,828 --> 01:14:23,729
He fell down.
- How?

1233
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:26,265
Kids fall down-- enough
with the fucking grilling.

1234
01:14:26,332 --> 01:14:27,266
Seriously,
David,

1235
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:28,867
I need you to stay in bed.

1236
01:14:28,935 --> 01:14:30,302
Shut up, Rings, okay?

1237
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:31,537
Where the fuck is my watch?

1238
01:14:31,604 --> 01:14:32,538
David.

1239
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,008
I need you to stay in bed

1240
01:14:36,076 --> 01:14:40,846
and don't call me Rings
even one more goddamn time!

1241
01:14:40,914 --> 01:14:41,914
Lay back down.

1242
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:45,384
Lay back down.

1243
01:14:46,453 --> 01:14:47,453
What are you doing?

1244
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,788
I'm taking him with me.

1245
01:14:49,856 --> 01:14:50,789
Well, he's
not here.

1246
01:14:50,857 --> 01:14:51,790
I know.

1247
01:14:51,858 --> 01:14:53,125
Oh, Jesus.

1248
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:56,562
Now, tell me,
how did he fall down?

1249
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,200
We just bumped
into each other.

1250
01:15:07,374 --> 01:15:09,842
Like I said... he wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

1251
01:15:09,909 --> 01:15:11,110
What do you think
you're doing, Kailey?

1252
01:15:11,177 --> 01:15:12,177
How Abby is the same.

1253
01:15:12,245 --> 01:15:15,214
You know the one thing
I'm gonna miss

1254
01:15:15,281 --> 01:15:17,316
is not being able
to tell her what a true

1255
01:15:17,384 --> 01:15:19,318
and hateful bitch...

1256
01:15:19,386 --> 01:15:21,320
Ow!

1257
01:15:23,623 --> 01:15:25,557
Fuck you.
- Like I said,

1258
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:27,693
he wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

1259
01:15:27,761 --> 01:15:32,398
But the thing in his letters
that's the clearest

1260
01:15:32,465 --> 01:15:33,732
is what he never says.

1261
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,900
Yeah, what's that?

1262
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:37,903
He's scared of you.

1263
01:15:37,971 --> 01:15:40,873
'Cause you're angry all the
time and he doesn't know why.

1264
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:42,474
And so you're taking him?

1265
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:44,643
Right.
So why are you telling me?

1266
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,312
You could have just taken
him without all this.

1267
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,014
'Cause I want you to know
he's going to be okay.

1268
01:15:49,082 --> 01:15:50,449
You're pointing
a gun at me.

1269
01:15:50,517 --> 01:15:51,850
Doesn't inspire
confidence.

1270
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,287
He's going to be fine.

1271
01:15:55,355 --> 01:15:56,922
He's going to be better.

1272
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,992
He might actually have a couple
of fucking friends.

1273
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,394
You can get up now.

1274
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,071
Hey, Rings?

1275
01:16:12,138 --> 01:16:13,706
You don't want to be
doing this, Rings!

1276
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:16,675
It's why you're sick.

1277
01:16:17,777 --> 01:16:19,778
You know
it's wrong.

1278
01:16:19,846 --> 01:16:21,780
Ow!

1279
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:23,449
God!

1280
01:16:23,516 --> 01:16:25,084
I told you to stop
calling me that.

1281
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:28,087
Find yourself a little
nickname for Ellen.

1282
01:16:28,154 --> 01:16:29,088
I don't have one.

1283
01:16:29,155 --> 01:16:30,255
I know.

1284
01:16:30,323 --> 01:16:31,690
I don't know when
she'll be back.

1285
01:16:31,758 --> 01:16:33,759
Hopefully, she'll have a nice,
long breakfast somewhere

1286
01:16:33,827 --> 01:16:35,294
and linger a bit,

1287
01:16:35,362 --> 01:16:39,398
but until then...
just think about how I'm right.

1288
01:16:39,466 --> 01:16:41,300
He can't be
here anymore.

1289
01:16:41,368 --> 01:16:43,035
Something bad
will happen.

1290
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:45,704
Abby will push harder,
you'll drink more,

1291
01:16:45,772 --> 01:16:48,674
something else will get broken.

1292
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:54,580
Just...

1293
01:16:54,647 --> 01:16:57,216
just give me a chance.

1294
01:16:57,283 --> 01:16:58,751
Okay? I'll take
care of him.

1295
01:16:58,818 --> 01:17:00,753
Rings,
you don't

1296
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:01,754
want to do this.

1297
01:17:01,821 --> 01:17:04,023
Rings.

1298
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:09,328
If you feel like you have
to call the police,

1299
01:17:09,396 --> 01:17:12,264
just wait as long as you can.

1300
01:17:35,221 --> 01:17:36,321
You drive a truck?

1301
01:17:36,389 --> 01:17:38,090
That's great.

1302
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:39,858
Come on, Gulls.

1303
01:17:39,926 --> 01:17:41,860
We've got to go.

1304
01:17:45,265 --> 01:17:47,766
But why do this to you?

1305
01:17:47,834 --> 01:17:50,102
She wanted me to know
that he'd be okay.

1306
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,637
What?

1307
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:53,038
She said...

1308
01:17:53,106 --> 01:17:56,775
he'd be better off
with her than with us.

1309
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:02,381
Is she right?

1310
01:18:05,018 --> 01:18:09,154
David? Is she right?

1311
01:18:11,424 --> 01:18:13,425
Call the police.

1312
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:20,366
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1313
01:18:20,433 --> 01:18:21,867
Nope.

1314
01:18:21,935 --> 01:18:23,369
Stay strapped in.

1315
01:18:23,436 --> 01:18:25,804
Okay.

1316
01:18:25,872 --> 01:18:28,774
I could help you drive.

1317
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,743
You know how to
drive standard?

1318
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,444
Yeah.

1319
01:18:32,512 --> 01:18:34,680
No, you don't.

1320
01:18:36,616 --> 01:18:37,883
Did you pack any
other clothes?

1321
01:18:37,951 --> 01:18:39,651
Some, yeah,
but they're in the back.

1322
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:41,620
Okay, well, uh,
stay buckled in,

1323
01:18:41,688 --> 01:18:44,356
but lose the lawyer
outfit, will you?

1324
01:18:44,424 --> 01:18:46,358
Sure.

1325
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:51,096
No, you're not listening--

1326
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:52,765
she doesn't have
visitation rights.

1327
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:54,967
Nobody's seen
that woman in 11 years.

1328
01:18:55,035 --> 01:18:57,202
Not even your grandson?

1329
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,504
Absolutely not him.

1330
01:18:58,571 --> 01:19:00,539
She hasn't seen him
since he was born.

1331
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,874
Where was that?

1332
01:19:01,941 --> 01:19:04,043
Ohio, near Columbus.

1333
01:19:05,145 --> 01:19:08,280
Where was that town?

1334
01:19:08,348 --> 01:19:10,215
David?

1335
01:19:10,283 --> 01:19:14,820
They may have been
writing each other.

1336
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:16,722
Oh, for Christ sake, David!

1337
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:18,691
I only just found out.

1338
01:19:18,758 --> 01:19:20,125
How?

1339
01:19:20,193 --> 01:19:21,460
What do you mean?

1340
01:19:21,528 --> 01:19:23,095
You said you don't
know where she was,

1341
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,730
so how's your son
going to write her?

1342
01:19:25,832 --> 01:19:27,900
I-I don't know.

1343
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:29,068
Okay.

1344
01:19:29,135 --> 01:19:30,235
Anything else?

1345
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,638
She has a gun.

1346
01:19:32,706 --> 01:19:35,007
You keep telling us that.

1347
01:19:35,075 --> 01:19:38,310
At least let me shift.

1348
01:19:38,378 --> 01:19:40,479
No.

1349
01:19:40,547 --> 01:19:42,047
I'll roshambo you for it.

1350
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:43,115
You'll what?

1351
01:19:43,183 --> 01:19:45,417
Rock, paper, scissors?

1352
01:19:45,485 --> 01:19:47,586
Oh, for God sakes.

1353
01:19:47,654 --> 01:19:49,455
All right, fine.

1354
01:19:49,522 --> 01:19:52,324
I'm going to throw a rock.

1355
01:19:52,392 --> 01:19:54,026
Really?

1356
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:56,028
Promise.

1357
01:19:56,096 --> 01:19:58,864
Okay. On four, all right?

1358
01:19:58,932 --> 01:20:01,667
Okay, one, two, three.

1359
01:20:01,735 --> 01:20:03,535
I lied.

1360
01:20:03,603 --> 01:20:05,170
Oh!
- Now teach me.

1361
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:10,109
Okay, up and towards
me is first.

1362
01:20:10,176 --> 01:20:11,543
Down is second.

1363
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:12,978
Up and towards
you is third.

1364
01:20:13,046 --> 01:20:14,113
Down is fourth.

1365
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,414
Okay, that's pretty much it.

1366
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,750
But you gotta do it
when I push in the clutch,

1367
01:20:17,817 --> 01:20:20,119
otherwise it's going to make
a terrible noise and we crash.

1368
01:20:20,186 --> 01:20:21,120
Okay?
Okay.

1369
01:20:21,187 --> 01:20:22,855
First.

1370
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:26,592
Second.

1371
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:30,896
Third.

1372
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:34,333
That's fourth.

1373
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:36,168
I can't believe
you cheated.

1374
01:20:44,644 --> 01:20:46,412
No letters.

1375
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:47,713
All of it's
schoolwork.

1376
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:52,584
I looked through
those already.

1377
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:08,200
Where the hell is
Chasm Falls, New York?

1378
01:21:08,268 --> 01:21:09,601
We'll find out.

1379
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:11,537
But Quinn's Billiards
should be pretty easy.

1380
01:21:14,207 --> 01:21:16,208
Goddamn it.

1381
01:21:30,623 --> 01:21:32,925
You know some woman
named Kailey Sullivan?

1382
01:21:32,992 --> 01:21:34,059
Oh, fuck.

1383
01:21:34,127 --> 01:21:35,294
Did she wreck my truck?

1384
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:38,364
Why would she wreck your truck?

1385
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:40,032
Because she thinks it's hers.

1386
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:43,736
Excuse me.
You Mr. Quinette?

1387
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:53,012
Hey, Gulls.

1388
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:54,980
You try to get
some sleep, okay?

1389
01:21:55,048 --> 01:21:56,515
We've still got a ways.

1390
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:58,717
No, I'm okay.

1391
01:22:04,624 --> 01:22:08,394
What do you think Dad's
doing right now?

1392
01:22:08,461 --> 01:22:11,930
I think he's
worried about you.

1393
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:18,437
I just hope he
isn't mean to Ellen.

1394
01:22:18,505 --> 01:22:21,940
You want to write
him a letter?

1395
01:22:22,008 --> 01:22:25,210
No. Maybe some time
but not right now.

1396
01:22:25,278 --> 01:22:27,112
Why not?

1397
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,248
It would just make
him even madder.

1398
01:22:32,485 --> 01:22:33,652
Well, we'll write
him a letter

1399
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,588
whenever
you want, okay?

1400
01:22:36,656 --> 01:22:38,657
Go to sleep, Gulls.

1401
01:23:03,516 --> 01:23:04,983
How far is Canada?
It's not far.

1402
01:23:05,051 --> 01:23:07,686
Probably about 20
miles up there.

1403
01:23:07,754 --> 01:23:10,089
We've got to catch a bus.

1404
01:23:10,156 --> 01:23:12,157
Let's just drive.

1405
01:23:12,225 --> 01:23:13,492
We can't.

1406
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,327
Hey, Gulls, listen.

1407
01:23:15,395 --> 01:23:19,231
On the bus, if anyone asks,
you're a very sick kid.

1408
01:23:19,299 --> 01:23:21,700
Like a cold?

1409
01:23:21,768 --> 01:23:24,269
No, maybe even
worse than that.

1410
01:23:24,337 --> 01:23:25,871
Escarole poisoning?

1411
01:23:25,939 --> 01:23:27,106
What is that?

1412
01:23:27,173 --> 01:23:29,775
I guess like food poisoning.

1413
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:33,212
No. Uh, worse than that.

1414
01:23:56,536 --> 01:23:58,871
I've got to get my bag first.

1415
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:05,744
What time is it?

1416
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:06,912
Almost 5:30.

1417
01:24:09,683 --> 01:24:11,950
And remember, worse than
escarole poisoning, okay?

1418
01:24:25,565 --> 01:24:26,799
Morning.

1419
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:27,900
Morning.

1420
01:24:27,967 --> 01:24:29,001
You're new.

1421
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:30,903
Yeah.

1422
01:24:33,139 --> 01:24:35,140
Mom, I'm starving.

1423
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:36,875
The bus will
be here soon.

1424
01:24:36,943 --> 01:24:40,212
No, it'll be late.
It always is.

1425
01:24:42,716 --> 01:24:45,751
Uh, I'll go get us
some donuts, okay?

1426
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:46,919
Stay here.

1427
01:25:03,603 --> 01:25:07,239
Can I get, uh, four
plain cake donuts,

1428
01:25:07,307 --> 01:25:08,640
a milk and a large coffee?

1429
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:10,242
I don't have any
regular coffee.

1430
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:11,276
I just have decaf.

1431
01:25:11,344 --> 01:25:13,245
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1432
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:16,548
I drank it all.

1433
01:25:16,616 --> 01:25:19,351
Fine. Just, uh,
give me a decaf.

1434
01:25:24,024 --> 01:25:26,392
Mom?

1435
01:25:26,459 --> 01:25:28,560
Gull, I told you
to stay in line.

1436
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:03,962
Kailey? Kailey?

1437
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:06,098
I need you
to stop running now.

1438
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:08,000
Kailey?

1439
01:26:08,068 --> 01:26:10,402
Look at me. Look at me.

1440
01:26:11,404 --> 01:26:12,438
Kailey!

1441
01:26:14,207 --> 01:26:17,443
No, no, no, leave the bag!
Leave the gun!

1442
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:18,711
Kailey! No!

1443
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:22,481
Mom!

1444
01:26:22,549 --> 01:26:24,283
Okay. Get in the truck.

1445
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:34,293
No, it's okay.

1446
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:36,862
Okay. It's okay.
I'm fine, Gulls.

1447
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:42,267
I just... I just need you
to shift again, okay?

1448
01:26:42,335 --> 01:26:45,137
Just... I'll get you into first,

1449
01:26:45,205 --> 01:26:48,273
but from then on,
it's all you, kid. Okay?

1450
01:26:48,341 --> 01:26:50,209
