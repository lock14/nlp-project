2
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:48,533
I'll take him.

3
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,194
<i>Jimmy MacElroy. The crowd swooning</i>
<i>as he comes out of that spin flawlessly.</i>

4
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,247
<i>They are giving him the love</i>
<i>and he is giving it right back.</i>

5
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:35,206
<i>Here it comes.</i>

6
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,207
<i>And he nails it!</i>

7
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,920
It's the best he's been.

8
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:46,216
<i>Now there's the arm.</i>

9
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,135
<i>And you know what that means.</i>

10
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,472
<i>Yes. The galloping peacock.</i>
<i>And look at him getting air on that.</i>

11
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,725
<i>Flawless. Just textbook perfection.</i>

12
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,646
<i>There are very few women</i>
<i>in the history of this sport</i>

13
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,983
<i>that skate with this kind of beauty.</i>

14
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:04,443
Come on, Jimmy. Nail it!

15
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,157
<i>Ending the programme</i>
<i>showing his flexibility.</i>

16
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,411
<i>What a great effort!</i>

17
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,501
<i>He couldn't skate any better than that.</i>

18
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:23,337
<i>The performance of a lifetime,</i>
<i>Jimmy MacElroy!</i>

19
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:25,965
<i>Elegant with</i>
<i>machine-like technical precision.</i>

20
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,091
<i>And there it is.</i>

21
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:30,844
<i>So important to remember that</i>
<i>that dove was in his suit the whole time.</i>

22
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,180
<i>Jimmy's renowned</i>
<i>for his personal hygiene, Scott.</i>

23
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:36,016
But after that performance,
he's starting to reek of gold.

24
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:36,350
But after that performance,
he's starting to reek of gold.

25
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:38,269
<i>While the judges decide Jimmy's fate,</i>

26
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:40,979
<i>let's take a look</i>
<i>at this exceptional young skater.</i>

27
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:43,483
<i>He is a child of privilege.</i>

28
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:46,276
<i>A classic skater defined</i>
<i>by elegance, precision</i>

29
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:48,612
<i>and an ability to endure great pain.</i>

30
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:50,990
<i>He was plucked from an orphanage</i>
<i>at age four</i>

31
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:53,700
<i>by billionaire champion-maker,</i>
<i>Darren MacElroy.</i>

32
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:57,204
<i>Once a breeder of some of the most</i>
<i>successful racehorses in the world,</i>

33
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,497
<i>Darren had turned his attention</i>

34
00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:01,376
<i>to nurturing athletically advanced</i>
<i>human orphans.</i>

35
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:05,796
<i>His ultimate find came in the form</i>
<i>of skating wunderkind, Jimmy.</i>

36
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:08,383
I guess I had a pretty normal childhood.

37
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:10,467
<i>With his father's state of the art,</i>

38
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:12,971
<i>some say questionable,</i>
<i>training methods,</i>

39
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:17,225
<i>this child prodigy</i>
<i>was forged into an Ã¼ber skater.</i>

40
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,310
<i>Soon, Jimmy was sweeping the gold</i>

41
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:23,355
<i>while his trademark Jimmy curl</i>
<i>was sweeping the nation,</i>

42
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,858
<i>with kids of all ages fashion drafting</i>
<i>right behind their idol.</i>

43
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:29,278
<i>A champion, an icon, a giver.</i>

44
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:33,283
<i>Jimmy MacElroy,</i>
<i>skating's Little Orphan Awesome.</i>

45
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:38,870
- Well, Coach?
- You nailed it, Jimmy. You nailed it.

46
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,624
You nailed it shut.
Every move exactly like I showed you.

47
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,250
I am so proud of you.

48
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,836
Thanks. Dad, what'd you think?

49
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:48,548
Decided on our own to do
a little flourish off the triple, did we?

50
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:50,925
Look, I knew I had it.
I just felt like it needed a little...

51
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,678
Feeling? We're feeling now?
What are you teaching this boy?

52
00:04:54,803 --> 00:04:55,846
Jimmy!

53
00:04:55,971 --> 00:05:00,017
I sent you a cup of my blood!
Did you get my blood? Jimmy!

54
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:02,060
Please don't encourage them. Come on.

55
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:03,228
Move!

56
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:04,730
They may look cute and innocent
but they're nothing

57
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:06,649
but a beehive for germs and bacteria.

58
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:10,069
- Remember the slides I showed you?
- But they're beautiful.

59
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:13,238
You smell like a winner!
You want to smell like...

60
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,949
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- Jimmy!

61
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:16,617
- I'll call you!
<i>...the judges' scores are:</i>

62
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:21,788
<i>5.9, 5.9, 6.0,</i>

63
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:26,209
<i>5.9, 6.0, 5.8.</i>

64
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:29,004
All right, not bad, not bad.
As long as that 5.8 doesn't kill us.

65
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,380
Hands.

66
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,382
Skittles.

67
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,471
Hey, MacElroy. Was that your routine?

68
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:40,391
Or a performance
of Cirque du So-lame?

69
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:41,516
Besides, you're too late.

70
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:43,310
They already handed out
the girls' medals this morning.

71
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,478
Shut up, Michaels.

72
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:48,316
That was textbook execution.
Same scores I beat you with in Oslo.

73
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:51,026
I was on Quaaludes.
I don't even remember Oslo.

74
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,528
But I remember Boston,

75
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,656
and that victory was
as sweet as the cream pie

76
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:56,281
for which the town was named.

77
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:02,913
Step aside, home school.
There's a new sheriff in town.

78
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:05,916
Chazz!

79
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:14,384
<i>There he is. Skating's outlaw,</i>
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

80
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:23,976
<i>This cowboy is cracking his whip on the</i>
<i>haunch of this crowd, and they love it!</i>

81
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:31,108
<i>How do you describe</i>
<i>something like that?</i>

82
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:39,951
<i>He just uses everything at his disposal.</i>
<i>The movement, the music.</i>

83
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,915
<i>And he just nails the triple Axel!</i>

84
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,670
<i>Surfing a tsunami of swagger right now.</i>

85
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:53,548
<i>Well, you know he is sex on ice.</i>

86
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:08,478
<i>Hello, ladies. Typical of Michaels,</i>
<i>it's not enough just to win.</i>

87
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,189
<i>He wants to make love to the crowd.</i>

88
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,360
<i>That's why those seats are so valuable.</i>

89
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:18,363
<i>That's what they want</i>
<i>from Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

90
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,168
<i>Michaels just slipped MacElroy</i>
<i>a very public note.</i>

91
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:33,670
<i>You have been called out, sir.</i>

92
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,473
You're welcome, Stockholm.

93
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,100
<i>Unreal. An instant classic.</i>

94
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:48,060
<i>Just when you think you've seen it all,</i>

95
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:51,648
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels walks in</i>
<i>with the unrated version.</i>

96
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:55,026
<i>The undefeatable underdog,</i>
<i>ice skating's backdoor lover,</i>

97
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:58,278
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels has come</i>
<i>in here and captivated this arena</i>

98
00:07:58,403 --> 00:08:00,615
like a stack of classic Euro porn.

99
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,658
<i>And so while his scores</i>
<i>are being tabulated,</i>

100
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,536
<i>let's learn a little bit more</i>
<i>about skating's Leather-clad Lothario.</i>

101
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:12,668
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels,</i>
<i>an ice-devouring sex tornado.</i>

102
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,004
<i>Spawned in the hell-fires of Motown.</i>

103
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,213
<i>Troubled childhood?</i>

104
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:20,468
If you call being a nine-year-old kid
with a 35-year-old girlfriend troubled.

105
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:24,430
<i>At age 12, Chazz escaped a life of</i>
<i>running cigarettes and illegal fireworks</i>

106
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:28,935
<i>by becoming a star in Detroit's</i>
<i>underground sewer skating scene.</i>

107
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:32,938
<i>The only skater to win four national</i>
<i>championships and an adult film award,</i>

108
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:37,360
<i>which is not to say this rough-hewn</i>
<i>heartthrob doesn't have a softer side.</i>

109
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:41,154
<i>He recently published a book of poetry,</i>
Let Me Put My Poems in You.

110
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,700
Before a big competition,
I like to work with leather.

111
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,994
The Native Americans always said

112
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:48,996
that working with hides and pelts
releases the soul.

113
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:51,582
These are a couple of diaper bags
I made for Faith Hill.

114
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,626
<i>Two men, only one winner.</i>

115
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,087
<i>Will it be Chazz Michael Michaels?</i>

116
00:08:57,212 --> 00:09:00,008
Personal philosophy: Clothing optional.

117
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:05,638
Hope you brought your silver polish,
MacElroy, 'cause that was gold.

118
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:07,139
That was disgusting.

119
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:09,267
That, young man,
is how babies are made.

120
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:11,686
- Get out of my face.
- I'll get inside your face.

121
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:12,854
Mr Michael Michaels,

122
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:14,855
please gather your coach,
family, and friends

123
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,857
and move to the bench
to await your scores.

124
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:20,068
Hey, traffic cop. Get this straight.
I don't have a coach. I don't need one.

125
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:24,157
And as for friends and family,
Chazz Michael Michaels walks alone.

126
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:27,911
That's why they call me the Lone Wolf,
on my back there.

127
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:32,789
<i>5.9, 5.9, 6.0...</i>

128
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:34,125
That's what I'm talking about.

129
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,878
<i>5.9, 6.0...</i>

130
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,546
Another 6.0.

131
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:39,838
<i>... 5.8.</i>

132
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:41,423
Was it good for you, Stockholm?

133
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,219
'Cause it was good for me.
Let's have a smoke.

134
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:45,761
Eat that, MacElroy.

135
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,722
Those were the same scores
I got, Einstein. We're tied.

136
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:51,893
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen, we have a tie.</i>
- You're high.

137
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,187
<i>From the United States,</i>
<i>Jimmy MacElroy</i>

138
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:57,231
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

139
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,027
You're fired.

140
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:03,111
What? I brought you a gold medal.

141
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:04,739
No, you brought me half a gold medal.

142
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:08,618
If I wanted him to share,
I'd have bought him a brother.

143
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:12,371
<i>It's raining men in the men's singles.</i>
<i>Men wearing gold, that is.</i>

144
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,792
<i>And they join Team USA's</i>
<i>other gold medallists,</i>

145
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,919
<i>the pairs team of</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg.</i>

146
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:22,881
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg,</i>

147
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:25,802
<i>America's brother and sister darlings,</i>

148
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:29,013
<i>the gold standard</i>
<i>of pairs figure skating.</i>

149
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:31,890
<i>Children of</i>
<i>beloved Swiss skiing gold medallists,</i>

150
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,809
<i>Otto and Ella Van Waldenberg,</i>

151
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:38,773
<i>the twin dynamos Stranz and Fairchild</i>
<i>burst out of the womb and onto the ice</i>

152
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:41,775
<i>while their sister, Katie,</i>
<i>cheered from the sidelines.</i>

153
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,947
<i>Theirs seemed to be a charmed life</i>
<i>until March 14th, 1987</i>

154
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,368
<i>when their parents died tragically</i>
<i>in a car crash.</i>

155
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:52,161
<i>Katie would survive.</i>

156
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,456
<i>The world wondered, had Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild gone into a layback spin</i>

157
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:57,457
<i>from which they could never recover?</i>

158
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,085
<i>But the siblings' commitment was such</i>

159
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,462
<i>that they were back in the training rink</i>
<i>within hours of the funeral.</i>

160
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,716
<i>So tonight, the crowd cheers</i>
<i>on their beloved Van Waldenbergs.</i>

161
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,342
<i>Well, Stranz and Fairchild,</i>

162
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,553
<i>how heavy is that gold</i>
<i>around your necks?</i>

163
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:13,557
Scott, this may be solid gold
but to us it's lighter than air

164
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,601
because dreams never weigh you down.

165
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:17,604
No. Dreams are in your sleep.

166
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,606
<i>What about the amazing</i>
<i>Michaels and MacElroy?</i>

167
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,232
<i>Two gold medals?</i>

168
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:25,235
Yeah. That's great.

169
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,571
<i>Well, speaking of gold medals,</i>

170
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:27,779
<i>the winners of the men's singles</i>

171
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:31,075
<i>are taking their place</i>
<i>at the podium right now.</i>

172
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:40,250
<i>This has to be a proud moment</i>
<i>for Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

173
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,004
<i>You have to think, the only thing</i>
<i>sweeter than winning a gold medal</i>

174
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:45,340
<i>is sharing it</i>
<i>with your fellow countryman.</i>

175
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:46,506
Gosh, I'm getting sick.

176
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,259
You smell like
aftershave and taco meat.

177
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:51,011
Yes, I do. Now scoot over.

178
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:53,347
Don't touch me. Nobody touches me.

179
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:54,974
- Just scoot over, man.
- Don't.

180
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:56,433
- Just scoot over.
- You scoot over.

181
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,311
<i>Now there's some jostling</i>
<i>atop the podium</i>

182
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:01,022
<i>and down goes</i>
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

183
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:03,691
<i>MacElroy still waving to the crowd.</i>

184
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,068
<i>Look, MacElroy's also down now.</i>

185
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,321
<i>I have never in all my years</i>
<i>seen anything</i>

186
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:10,280
<i>this disgraceful on the world stage.</i>

187
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,991
<i>I am stunned silent,</i>
<i>absolutely silent, Jim.</i>

188
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:15,662
You get that damned bird out of my face
before I break its neck.

189
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:18,121
<i>A perfect head butt!</i>
<i>Down goes MacElroy!</i>

190
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:20,124
<i>And Spaetzle's aflame!</i>

191
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,336
<i>Spaetzle! Oh, my God!</i>

192
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,815
<i>As we prepare to hear testimony,</i>
<i>Michaels and MacElroy</i>

193
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,442
<i>will be given a chance</i>
<i>to defend their actions at Stockholm...</i>

194
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:55,493
We love you, Jimmy.

195
00:12:57,245 --> 00:12:59,788
Hey. Nancy Kerrigan.

196
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,083
You an official here?

197
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,211
'Cause you have officially given me
a boner.

198
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,091
I'm a sex addict. It's my cross to bear.

199
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,514
It's a real disease with doctors
and medicine and everything.

200
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,100
Let's get started, shall we?

201
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,184
If either one of you would like
to make a statement

202
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,812
before the commission
passes judgement,

203
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,106
you may do so at this time.

204
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:31,863
Fans, friends, esteemed members
of the committee,

205
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:33,990
I don't know what I can say,

206
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:36,366
but I pray you can all forgive me.

207
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:40,078
More than that,
I pray the children can forgive me.

208
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:41,288
Oh, my God.

209
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:44,082
- I place my future in their tiny hands.
- That is retarded.

210
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:48,171
God bless you. God bless everyone.
Thank you.

211
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:52,049
God bless you, Jimmy.
God bless your heart.

212
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:55,595
<i>Maxim.</i>

213
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:57,639
Last issue.

214
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:01,392
"Chazz Michael Michaels
is figure skating."

215
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:03,061
Boom!

216
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,899
All right, duly noted.

217
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:13,696
In accordance with the rules of
the International Skating Federation,

218
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:17,658
James MacElroy
and Charles Michael Michaels,

219
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:19,994
you are to be stripped of your medals...

220
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,162
What?

221
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:25,250
...and banned from men's figure skating
for the remainder of your lives!

222
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,501
Hey, you listen to me, old man!

223
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:29,671
Oh, that sucks.

224
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:31,297
Look what you did to my ex-wife!

225
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:33,383
I'm gonna pop you
in the back of the head.

226
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,264
Banned for life. That's a long time.

227
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:44,018
Jimmy, it'll all work out.

228
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:45,227
It's time for a fresh start.

229
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,313
- Yeah, a fresh start. Exactly.
- Good. Jimmy,

230
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,318
- I'm un-adopting you.
- What?

231
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:54,946
I don't think un-adopting
is the right word.

232
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:57,407
Legally, I'm disowning you.

233
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:59,658
But it amounts to the same thing, so...

234
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,869
But I've been your son for 26 years.

235
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:04,956
Twenty-two, so nobody can say
I didn't try. We've had a good run.

236
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:09,501
Now, I think it would be best for all of us
if we didn't drag this out. Clean break.

237
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:16,717
It would make it easier for me, Jimmy,
if you left now.

238
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:17,885
Wait!

239
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,181
It's like a Band-Aid. Just rip it off.
We'll both feel better.

240
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:57,508
<i>Hey, everybody,</i>
<i>get your tickets for the second show.</i>

241
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:01,596
<i>Second show tickets now available.</i>

242
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:07,100
<i>Tra-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la</i>
<i>We sing a grublet song</i>

243
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:13,399
<i>We love to roam our woodsy home</i>
<i>Of greenery and scenery and song</i>

244
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:18,153
<i>Tra-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la</i>
<i>A grublet sings along</i>

245
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,697
Oh, God.

246
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:25,912
I hate you.

247
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,000
I hate my life.

248
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,336
Oh, no! It's the evil wizard!

249
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,255
Boo!

250
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:53,480
I mean, I had it with skating
for the judges, you know?

251
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:55,524
Just like, I don't need that.

252
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:00,196
I mean, for me, it's so much
more satisfying to see the...

253
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:03,783
The eyes of a small child,
seeing that wonder as they...

254
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:07,537
They see you skate out there
with a big wizard head on, you know?

255
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,499
Nice. Really nice.

256
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,836
Hey, Sammy, it's not what it looks like.

257
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,758
Sam. Sammy, come on, baby.

258
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,969
You knew this was how I rolled
when you met me.

259
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:25,637
No. When I met you,
you were a great figure skater.

260
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:27,848
Now you're getting stoned
with the Woodland Fairies.

261
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:29,349
I don't even know
who you are any more.

262
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:30,894
You're living in the past, Sammy.

263
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:32,269
Come on,
me and the Woodland Fairies,

264
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:34,230
we're living in the here and now.

265
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:36,941
And we're feeling so free.
Come on, join us.

266
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,903
Baby. Come on, babe.

267
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:44,615
Hey, Michaels, let's go. Lace up.
The fog machines are primed.

268
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,201
Second show's
almost three-quarters full.

269
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,662
- You drunk?
- No.

270
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,373
But this ought to do it.

271
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,250
I would fire you

272
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:58,837
if you weren't so goddamn beautiful
out there.

273
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:02,174
- You smell like urine.
- A lot?

274
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:04,509
Get your head on.

275
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:12,101
They don't feel right.

276
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:13,728
That's because I'm not finished.

277
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:17,522
You see, it helps to think of the laces
as belonging to three distinct groups.

278
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,233
First, the foundation.

279
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,027
They're too tight.

280
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,488
Daddy! He's crushing me.

281
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,906
Doing it right takes a little bit longer,
but it's worth it.

282
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:29,243
Hey, what are you doing?
She said it's too tight.

283
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:30,912
Well, but she's wrong.

284
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:35,250
I mean, who are you gonna trust,
a little girl or Jimmy MacElroy?

285
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,626
- Who the hell is Jimmy MacElroy?
- Is there a problem here, sir?

286
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:40,128
Yeah, this kid is torturing
my daughter's foot.

287
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,381
I'm so sorry, sir.

288
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:45,884
You know what, Jimmy? Off the skates,
you're on stockroom duty, now. Let's go.

289
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,230
Hey, Jimmy.

290
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,106
Hector?

291
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:00,441
What are you doing here?

292
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,361
You know
I have a restraining order against you.

293
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:05,738
Oh, that thing?

294
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:09,909
You look great, Jimmy.
You look amazing. Your hair rocks.

295
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:11,076
Thanks.

296
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,663
You look so good. Oh, my gosh.

297
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,999
Do you look at yourself?

298
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:20,920
I totally wanna cut off your skin and
wear it to my birthday. It's coming up.

299
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:25,340
Yeah, listen, it's great to see you,
Hector, but I'm really busy right now.

300
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,801
Okay, all right, I'm sorry.
I'll cut to the chase.

301
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:30,179
- You gotta start skating again, Jimmy.
- What?

302
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:32,932
It's embarrassing stalking a has-been,
you know what I mean?

303
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:34,767
Look, I almost gave up on you.

304
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:36,310
I started working
with that Ukrainian skater,

305
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:37,979
you know the one that looks like Elvis?

306
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:39,355
And I moved to the Ukraine

307
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,692
and it was cold and everyone had guns
and smelled like soup.

308
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:46,945
I sympathise with you, Hector.
I really do, but there's nothing I can do.

309
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,239
I'm banned for life.

310
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:50,074
Don't be so sure.

311
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,368
Section 14, paragraph G,

312
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:57,289
"A lifetime ban is irrevocable
and the banned skater can never again

313
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:59,875
"compete in any
Federation-sanctioned tournament

314
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,711
"that exists in such a skater's division."

315
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,384
You see? You're only banned
from your division, men's singles!

316
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:12,137
You can still compete in pairs skating.

317
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:13,806
Pairs.

318
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:20,688
How is this possible?

319
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:24,150
I had so many lawyers work on
so many appeals.

320
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:26,944
Because nobody can obsess like I can.

321
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,696
Good luck, Jimmy.

322
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,702
And I'm still gonna kill you someday.

323
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:44,378
Oh, no! It's the evil wizard!

324
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,015
<i>Hey, little forest creatures.</i>

325
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,978
<i>None of you sons-of-bitches</i>
<i>try to be heroes. You hear me?</i>

326
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:05,191
Hey, Chazz. Come on.

327
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:08,111
It's Gary. What are you doing?

328
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:10,863
<i>Hey, everyone!</i>
<i>This is Gary, the squirrel.</i>

329
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:13,115
<i>Now listen up.</i>
<i>Gary's been a long-time friend.</i>

330
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,118
<i>We've been skating</i>
<i>for two and a half years.</i>

331
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:20,123
<i>I remember when we were hanging out</i>
<i>at the bus stop in Tucson,</i>

332
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:22,625
<i>and Gary said, "I've got a third ball."</i>

333
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:27,547
<i>Damn it. I just threw up in here, people.</i>

334
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:32,009
<i>That's the reality.</i>
<i>Another layer to the legend.</i>

335
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:36,847
<i>I am nothing but a human onion.</i>
<i>In fact, we all are. Oh, encore.</i>

336
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:42,103
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i> Grublets on Ice
<i>will be cancelled until further notice.</i>

337
00:21:42,228 --> 00:21:44,271
<i>No refunds will be given.</i>

338
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:51,738
Bring it on! Let it rain down on me.

339
00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:59,621
There's a loophole. I was banned
from men's singles but not pairs.

340
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:01,623
I can skate
in the Wintersport Games again.

341
00:22:01,748 --> 00:22:04,709
I knew it. I knew after three years,
you just weren't checking in.

342
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:07,211
I mean, come on, I moved on, Jimmy.
You gotta move on, too.

343
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:09,338
But I'm a skater.
There's nothing to move on to,

344
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:12,258
except for winning the gold again
and keeping it this time.

345
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:14,635
You know how hard it is
to find a partner?

346
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,055
Even if you did,
you gotta qualify for Nationals.

347
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,640
That's a month away.

348
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:20,349
I mean, sign-up is in two days.

349
00:22:20,474 --> 00:22:21,893
It can't be that hard. I mean...

350
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:26,897
Figure skating. Give it up, Jimmy.
It's like a cruel bitch mother.

351
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,484
She'll seduce you
with chocolates and roses

352
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:34,113
and then kick you to the side of the road
like a dead raccoon.

353
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:36,865
Forget it. I gotta go.

354
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:40,369
It's good to see you.

355
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:43,498
Wait, Coach!

356
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,769
Jimmy MacElroy?

357
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:08,522
Another great walking through the halls
of the Grublets.

358
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:11,233
Welcome to my little production.

359
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,861
If you're here to thank me for firing
Chazz Michaels, it was my pleasure.

360
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:15,028
Chazz was here?

361
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:19,450
Yeah, unfortunately,
but it's fantastic that you're here.

362
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:22,996
And yes, no need to ask,
I'll consider you for a position.

363
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:24,830
I'm not looking for a job.

364
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:28,292
I'm actually looking for a female skater
to compete with me at Nationals.

365
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,920
- Are you trying to skater poach?
- No.

366
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,006
You trying to break up my family?

367
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:36,467
Why don't you get out of here
before I throw down?

368
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:41,681
Hey, where you going?

369
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,072
Michaels.

370
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,074
MacElroy.

371
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,366
I see you got fat.

372
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,411
I see you still look
like a 15-year-old girl but not hot.

373
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:04,578
You crushed my dreams.

374
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:06,413
Dreams? Shit.
I haven't had one of those in years.

375
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:09,083
Zip it, Chazz. Zip it or I will punch you
in your crap lousy face.

376
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:10,375
This ends tonight.

377
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,545
It's daytime, you douche.

378
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:17,008
- Now it's on!
- You're so fat!

379
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:25,767
<i>Local figure skating fans got more than</i>
<i>they bargained for today</i>

380
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:28,853
<i>when a children's ice show</i>
<i>was interrupted by a street fight</i>

381
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:31,064
<i>between two former champions.</i>

382
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:33,357
<i>Jimmy MacElroy</i>
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels,</i>

383
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:35,151
<i>once at the top of the skating world,</i>

384
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:38,695
<i>picked up today where they left off</i>
<i>more than three years...</i>

385
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:58,383
<i>Fans remember Michaels and MacElroy</i>
<i>as gold medallists who,</i>

386
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,050
<i>in a bizarre turn of events,</i>

387
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:02,554
<i>became banned from competition</i>
<i>for life.</i>

388
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:03,971
<i>I had a chance to sit down</i>
<i>with Michaels</i>

389
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:06,015
<i>and let's just say, he's a complex man.</i>

390
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,102
<i>I'm a sex addict</i>
<i>and I'm attracted to women.</i>

391
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:32,666
Two men skating together?
That's a riot. That's a laugh riot.

392
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:36,128
- I don't see what's so funny.
- If you were as drunk as me, you would.

393
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:40,048
Look, Coach, I know I said
I wanted to skate pairs, but two men?

394
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:42,259
Even if we wanted to,
they'd never allow it.

395
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:44,511
But there's nothing in the rule book
that says you can't.

396
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:48,557
That's not my style.
Chazz Michael Michaels goes it alone.

397
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:52,060
Okay?
That means no coach and no partner.

398
00:25:53,104 --> 00:25:55,315
Especially not a dude.

399
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,233
Especially not the precious
and pampered Richie Rich.

400
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:00,403
Would you just shut up? You don't know
what you're talking about.

401
00:26:00,528 --> 00:26:01,528
I know more than you think I know.

402
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:03,239
Hell, I know more than you know
you know.

403
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:05,782
No, you don't. You could never keep up
with my flawless technique.

404
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:08,201
That's why I floored you in '02
and the spring of '99.

405
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:09,828
Technique doesn't get you 18 medals

406
00:26:09,953 --> 00:26:12,039
and a Kristi Yamaguchi
Lifetime Achievement Award.

407
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:14,541
- I am figure skating.
- Stop it!

408
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:18,253
For three years I've been trying to get
over the nightmare you two created.

409
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:20,298
I wasn't sure I'd ever forget it.

410
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:25,385
Now maybe underneath all your bullshit,
we can still find something beautiful.

411
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,346
I don't know, Coach.

412
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:29,473
I mean, I'm really desperate
to win that gold, but...

413
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:32,727
But what?
How's the partner search coming, kid?

414
00:26:33,603 --> 00:26:35,313
What's so funny, Cool Whip?

415
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:38,650
You getting a lot of satisfaction
from those $15 hookers?

416
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:42,153
I am never satisfied. It's a curse.

417
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:47,909
The registration for the National Finals
closes in exactly 12 hours.

418
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:50,577
Now let me ask you boys a question.

419
00:26:51,203 --> 00:26:53,330
Do you wanna make history?

420
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:00,630
No way.
This guy could not hold my jock sweat.

421
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:02,214
I could hold it all day long. Try me.

422
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:03,590
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe you should.

423
00:27:03,715 --> 00:27:04,800
You challenging me, Princess?

424
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:07,595
I'm not inviting you to the Skating
Federation's Annual Christmas Party.

425
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,887
- Then bring it on!
- It is on!

426
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:10,597
Good. We're in agreement then.

427
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:11,766
- What?
- What?

428
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:14,602
Welcome back to competitive skating,
gentlemen.

429
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,689
I'll pick you up in the morning.

430
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,898
Little help.

431
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:32,244
Here we go. Show time.

432
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:37,458
Stranz. Fairchild. Melissa Kelly, ESPN2.

433
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,919
So, let me ask you,
any thoughts on the competition?

434
00:27:40,044 --> 00:27:41,712
And what does a new gold medal
mean for you?

435
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:43,714
It doesn't mean as much
as winning America's hearts.

436
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,299
That's very important to us.

437
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:47,050
Now we haven't seen you
in about three and a half years.

438
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:48,260
What have you been up to?

439
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:49,554
Skating.

440
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,847
<i>Now apparently you're dedicating</i>
<i>this performance</i>

441
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:54,308
<i>to the children of the world.</i>

442
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,191
Sorry.

443
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:06,445
- Chazz, fill this out.
- No.

444
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,030
Yes.

445
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,490
I'll get yours, Jimmy.

446
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:10,950
Who is that girl?

447
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:12,618
You mean Katie Van Waldenberg?

448
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:14,662
She's Stranz and Fairchild's sister?

449
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:17,332
Fairchild's legs and Stranz's ass.

450
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,335
Mind bottling, isn't it?

451
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,337
- Did you just say "mind bottling?"
- Yeah, mind bottling.

452
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:24,505
You know, when things are so crazy,

453
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:26,673
it gets your thoughts all trapped,
like in a bottle.

454
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,094
All right, boys.
Let's go do this. Loud and proud.

455
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,057
What are you two doing here?

456
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:37,684
You know damn well I'm not letting
either of you sign up. They're banned.

457
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:40,104
I'm not here to sign up
Michaels or MacElroy.

458
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,107
I'm here to sign up the pairs team
of Michaels and MacElroy.

459
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:44,776
I'm here to sign up the pairs team
of Michaels and MacElroy.

460
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,236
Thank you.

461
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:51,281
Now there's your front page headline.

462
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:53,826
Jimmy, can you wave to the fans?

463
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:57,454
So Jimmy and Chazz together
and no fighting, huh?

464
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:05,380
Two men skating together
and in our division, no less.

465
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:06,964
Why, Stranz?

466
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,924
Why is God singling us out

467
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,344
for the greatest suffering
the world has ever known?

468
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:14,763
I don't know, sis. Those two are nothing
but a couple of freaks.

469
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:16,391
Yeah, and the media loves freaks.

470
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:17,808
Makes my blood boil.

471
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:20,894
And all they're doing is just leeching
the dignity out of our beloved sport.

472
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,230
You know, I'm not a violent person,

473
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:25,817
but I would like to hold them down
and skate over their throats.

474
00:29:25,942 --> 00:29:28,736
Guys, maybe,
maybe if you concentrate on the skating

475
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:30,238
people will forget all the hype

476
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:33,199
and they'll focus
on the purity of the sport

477
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:35,993
and the spirit of honest competition.

478
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:40,289
You guys just want to cheat again,
don't you?

479
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:41,833
- That's a good idea.
- Much better.

480
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,460
Katie, please,
will you just take this camcorder, okay?

481
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:47,087
I don't know how to turn it on.
Thank you.

482
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:48,589
No, I'm not spying for you again.

483
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:51,550
We're just asking you
to discreetly tape their practice routines.

484
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:53,385
Find someone else.

485
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,223
- What's that, Mother?
- Don't.

486
00:29:58,348 --> 00:30:00,559
You and Father are sad
that you were killed

487
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:03,605
driving Katie to her ice skating lesson
all those years ago?

488
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,022
Yeah. Me, too.

489
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:07,817
Remember how they used to be alive?

490
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:09,067
Papa?

491
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:12,864
I can't hear you, Papa.
What are you... You're crying?

492
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:16,200
Still? In heaven? You're still dead?

493
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:19,162
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Yes.

494
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:22,207
Now you're playing
for team Van Waldenberg.

495
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:30,882
All right.
You'll be staying here for the duration.

496
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:38,306
You're gonna skate as a pair.
You'll live as a pair.

497
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:41,308
And if you're at all interested
in self-preservation,

498
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:45,230
you take off your shoes
before you set foot on the Berber.

499
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:48,232
Why would we step in baby food?

500
00:30:48,357 --> 00:30:51,402
- He's talking about the carpet. Berber?
- What are you? The Rug Doctor?

501
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:53,613
- Maybe I am.
- I'm the rug master.

502
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:57,366
- What does that even mean?
- Shut up and take off your damn shoes.

503
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:03,580
- Bunk beds?
- I don't share rooms.

504
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:07,876
I don't share shit.
The night is a very dark time for me.

505
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,337
It's dark for everyone, moron.

506
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,798
Not for Alaskans or dudes
with night vision goggles.

507
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:14,800
All right, this is gonna stop right now.

508
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:17,929
From here on out, you guys are a team.
Do you understand?

509
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:19,556
You are going to eat together,
sleep together.

510
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,015
You are going to pee together.

511
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,643
You're gonna file
a joint income tax return.

512
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:26,895
Practice starts now. End of discussion.

513
00:31:37,281 --> 00:31:39,157
I just put those into order.

514
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:41,286
I need some counter space, too.

515
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:47,791
- Mane n' Tail. Is this horse shampoo?
- Yes, it is.

516
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,545
- Do you use this stuff on your hair?
- Uh-huh.

517
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:55,424
"For a lustrous coat."
Does this actually work?

518
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:56,925
You bet your ass it does.

519
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,680
It makes my hair shine like Orion's belt
out on the ice.

520
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:06,394
And then I brush my hair
100 times with this.

521
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,441
Cool brush.

522
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:14,736
Not just a brush but a Verticoli.

523
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:19,073
Handmade in Italy.
They carve it out of illegal whalebone.

524
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:21,366
They only make 11 of them a year.

525
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:25,704
This one cost me $12,000
or 30 million lira.

526
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:30,710
Perfectly balanced, low drag,
minimal torque.

527
00:32:30,835 --> 00:32:32,502
How minimal?

528
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:34,631
I bet you'd like to know.

529
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,133
Help yourself to the Mane n' Tail
all you want,

530
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:39,551
but don't even look at the Verticoli.

531
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,887
'Cause I will knock your block off.

532
00:32:42,012 --> 00:32:43,388
No exaggeration,

533
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:47,393
I could not love a human baby
as much as I love this brush.

534
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:54,817
I call top.

535
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:58,988
- Sorry, I already called it in my head.
- You can't do that. That doesn't count.

536
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:02,032
Yes, it does. Get used to it, Jimmy.

537
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,494
You're in Chazz's world now.

538
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:08,163
You know what?
I permanently called shotgun.

539
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:10,500
You do not get shotgun every time.

540
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:14,503
What is this place? It smells like fish.

541
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:15,880
Sweet.

542
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:19,467
This ice has not been
properly Zambonied.

543
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:21,844
- And where's the warm-down room?
- We don't have any of that.

544
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,637
What we got is a cold storage unit

545
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:26,641
that a buddy of mine let me flood
with a garden hose.

546
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:28,518
Nice choice, Coach.

547
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:30,894
Turned out well.

548
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:34,231
The dance lift, the press lift,
the twist lift,

549
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:37,693
the side by side jump, the throw jump.

550
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:40,445
All of these are weapons
in the pairs skaters' arsenal.

551
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:42,990
And used properly,
they can slay your opponent.

552
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:46,577
Used improperly,
you can break every bone in your body.

553
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:50,248
All right, gentlemen, waltz position.

554
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:02,844
You know what, dude,
your hand has to be on top.

555
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,429
No way. The girl's goes on top.

556
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:06,306
Yeah. Ergo. Chick.

557
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:07,723
I'm not the girl. I'm stronger.

558
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:09,434
No, I'm stronger
and don't have a vagina.

559
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,728
You are not stronger.
Watch this, fat ass.

560
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:12,896
Fat ass?

561
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:14,813
It doesn't really matter,
it's waltz position.

562
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:16,733
One guy, you put your, just...

563
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:19,193
See that?
It's pure pec, bicep, and tricep.

564
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:20,360
Jimmy, get off your hands.

565
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:22,614
You're gonna need those later.
Now, come on.

566
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,864
All right.

567
00:34:24,114 --> 00:34:25,992
Okay, you know what?
I can do something cool, too.

568
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:27,201
Chazz. Chazz.

569
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:31,456
You think you're so tough. Huh?
I'm not fat. I can do this.

570
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:34,416
- Chazz, put your skates back on.
- No, it's too late. They're off.

571
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,878
- Look, I'm like lightning.
- Put your skates back on.

572
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:38,128
What are you doing?

573
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:40,715
- Yeah. God, that burns.
- Oh, yeah?

574
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:43,967
Jimmy, you put your clothes on. Jimmy!

575
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:45,844
- Damn it!
- Watch my Icy Hot Super Slide.

576
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,012
- Do it.
- I will.

577
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:50,474
It's not gonna matter
'cause you're flat in front like Ken.

578
00:35:06,824 --> 00:35:07,951
You're the girl.

579
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,036
- What?
- You're my pretty lady, MacElroy.

580
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:12,579
- Wait. Why?
- Because you whine like one!

581
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:16,333
And no one can lift your fat ass.
You're on a diet, starting now.

582
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:19,295
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go! Come on!

583
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,463
Is this about my muscular, thick thighs?

584
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:25,134
Could one of you all pass me a biscuit?

585
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,221
You got another five miles,
then you get a LUNA bar.

586
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,722
Come on.

587
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:34,686
So, Coach, I was thinking
about the music for our routine.

588
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,271
- Really?
- We're gonna skate to one song,

589
00:35:36,396 --> 00:35:39,481
one song only.
<i>Lady Hump</i> by the Black Eyed Peas.

590
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:42,860
<i>What you gonna do with all that junk</i>
<i>All that junk inside my trunk</i>

591
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:46,239
<i>I'm gonna get you, get you drunk</i>
<i>Get you drunk off my lady hump</i>

592
00:35:46,364 --> 00:35:49,576
<i>My hump, my hump</i>
<i>My lovely lady hump</i>

593
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:52,744
I'm not skating to anything
with references to lady humps.

594
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:53,996
I don't even know what that means.

595
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,958
No one knows what it means,
but it's provocative.

596
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,918
- No, it's not. It's gross.
- It gets the people going.

597
00:35:59,043 --> 00:36:02,713
That's enough!
Why do you guys keep doing that?

598
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:16,184
You didn't see shit!

599
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:18,730
- Coach!
- Shut up!

600
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:26,528
Throw me some chicken!

601
00:36:28,572 --> 00:36:29,949
Two men.

602
00:36:30,074 --> 00:36:32,117
Together. You're really gonna go
through with this, huh?

603
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:33,577
Oh, yeah, of course. Why not?

604
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:35,329
I mean, I need your help.
What do you say?

605
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:38,458
Look, I'm just a choreographer.
What do I know?

606
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,168
Bring them
by the dance studio tomorrow.

607
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:41,960
- Great!
- I'm not a magician.

608
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:43,128
I ain't making no promises.

609
00:36:43,253 --> 00:36:45,547
I'm just saying
that I'm'a do what I can do.

610
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:48,760
Your problem is your boundaries.
That ends today.

611
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:50,177
Out on my dance floor you won't know

612
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,347
where one man's body ends
and another begins.

613
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:55,182
Because if you can't dance with a man,
you damn sure can't skate with a man.

614
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:57,351
All right? So come on, let's go.

615
00:36:58,936 --> 00:36:59,938
Jimmy.

616
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:01,940
Yeah.

617
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:03,942
That's what I thought.

618
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:05,943
That a boy, Jimmy. Come on.

619
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:08,947
Okay. Break it down.
Show me what you got.

620
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:13,076
Okay. That's a start. That is a start.

621
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:42,313
You're tensing your face.
If you tense your face,

622
00:37:42,438 --> 00:37:44,190
you're gonna make it harder
for yourselves.

623
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:45,942
Just enable...

624
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:54,534
Rewind it.
I wanna see his head bang down again.

625
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,795
No. No, no.
You act right or you leave my studio.

626
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,673
Beautiful butterfly into a prayer.
Nice into...

627
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:15,471
Let them get it out. Let them get it out.

628
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:19,224
Chazz, release to Jimmy.
Easy, see? Release...

629
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:23,896
- Yes.
- No. No.

630
00:38:39,954 --> 00:38:40,954
You nailed it!

631
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,083
Yes, I did. See that? Pure power.
You could use a nickel's worth, junior.

632
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,753
Maybe if you released me
at that quarter-turn,

633
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:48,713
I wouldn't have to save your ass
with my landing.

634
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,217
It's called improvisation.
Even your precious Kenny G does it.

635
00:38:52,342 --> 00:38:54,427
Well, at least they're getting
the moves down.

636
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:59,014
Yeah, but can they do it in front of
five judges and 30 million people?

637
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:04,103
<i>Denver, Colorado, last stop on the road</i>

638
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:06,688
<i>to the World Wintersport Games</i>
<i>in Montreal.</i>

639
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:09,650
<i>The finest skaters from all over</i>
<i>the country have trained tirelessly,</i>

640
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:12,653
<i>for years for their chance</i>
<i>to make it onto the world stage.</i>

641
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:15,030
<i>But all those stories</i>
<i>have been eclipsed now</i>

642
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:17,742
<i>by what many dub</i>
<i>the Sideshow of the Century.</i>

643
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:21,788
<i>The male-male pair of Jimmy MacElroy</i>
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

644
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:24,666
<i>The anxiety was palpable</i>
<i>when they arrived this morning</i>

645
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:28,043
<i>as the skating community</i>
<i>continued to voice its outrage.</i>

646
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:30,380
Those two are turning this sport
into a freak show.

647
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:32,882
As if figure skating
wasn't gay enough already.

648
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:36,885
Let me show you something.
Does that look right to you?

649
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:39,264
Nothing in here about two men skating.

650
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:43,101
That blonde chick's a dude? Oh, man.

651
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:46,228
<i>Now let's join Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild Van Waldenberg</i>

652
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:47,981
<i>as they wind up their routine,</i>

653
00:39:48,106 --> 00:39:52,318
<i>an edgy look at urban culture</i>
<i>told in the language of the streets.</i>

654
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:56,822
<i>And boy, look at them!</i>
<i>They are really having fun with this.</i>

655
00:39:56,947 --> 00:40:01,202
<i>The bling is king. This pair</i>
<i>is willing the crowd into a frenzy.</i>

656
00:40:04,246 --> 00:40:05,623
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

657
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:17,135
<i>Wow! Flawless, as always.</i>

658
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,971
<i>These two blue-eyed funk machines</i>
<i>are going to find themselves</i>

659
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:24,099
<i>popping and locking their way</i>
<i>to the championship in Montreal.</i>

660
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:26,101
<i>And those good vibrations seem</i>

661
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:29,313
<i>to have spread all the way</i>
<i>through this arena.</i>

662
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:33,108
What, what!

663
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:38,780
You guys are up.

664
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:41,617
<i>And now the moment</i>
<i>this crowd has been waiting for.</i>

665
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:43,744
<i>And how is this going to work?</i>

666
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:47,498
<i>Completely different skaters,</i>
<i>known to be enemies of one another,</i>

667
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:52,545
<i>combining to be the first male-male</i>
<i>pair team in the history of the sport.</i>

668
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,923
<i>Either the locked-in technical style</i>
<i>of MacElroy</i>

669
00:40:56,048 --> 00:40:59,385
<i>will not mesh</i>
<i>with Michaels' improvisations</i>

670
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,471
<i>or they create great music together</i>

671
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:04,514
<i>and reinvent the sport</i>
<i>in their own image.</i>

672
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:10,063
They're laughing at us.

673
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:14,233
They laughed at Louis Armstrong when
he said he was gonna go to the moon.

674
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:17,070
Now he's up there laughing at them.

675
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:25,161
<i>Well, they titled this routine</i>
<i>"Fire and Ice."</i>

676
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:28,581
<i>They've always been that way</i>
<i>as competitors, as individuals</i>

677
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:30,583
<i>and now as a pair team?</i>

678
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,335
<i>So appropriate.</i>

679
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:25,762
<i>So far, so good.</i>

680
00:42:31,603 --> 00:42:34,771
<i>Their first move's so difficult.</i>
<i>Throw triple Axel.</i>

681
00:42:34,898 --> 00:42:36,315
First throw.

682
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,943
<i>Man down.</i>

683
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:42,905
<i>What an unbelievably disastrous</i>
<i>beginning to this routine!</i>

684
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,784
I've never fallen once in competition.

685
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:48,869
Come on. Take my hand.

686
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:51,581
We can do this.

687
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:54,666
<i>And they're up.</i>

688
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:57,003
Come on, Denver, get off your asses!

689
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,463
Let's go!

690
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,173
<i>And the crowd responds.</i>

691
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:05,260
<i>It's the first time they've shown them</i>
<i>any level of support.</i>

692
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,143
<i>Side by side double Axels!</i>
<i>Beautifully delivered!</i>

693
00:43:16,356 --> 00:43:17,773
<i>And again, a male-male pair team.</i>

694
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:21,735
<i>They're doing things</i>
<i>that no other pair would dare to do.</i>

695
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:37,501
<i>Incredible!</i>

696
00:43:51,306 --> 00:43:55,353
<i>So many moves in this programme</i>
<i>I've never heard of before.</i>

697
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:03,902
Yes!

698
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,706
<i>Unbelievable finish</i>
<i>to an incredible routine!</i>

699
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:18,251
<i>And they've won this crowd over!</i>

700
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,963
Yes!

701
00:44:22,755 --> 00:44:25,884
<i>This might be enough</i>
<i>to send them to Montreal</i>

702
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:30,554
as the first male-male representatives
this sport has ever seen.

703
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:32,556
<i>History in the making.</i>

704
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:45,445
Yeah!

705
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:55,704
We love you, Denver!

706
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:59,250
City by the bay! John Denver!

707
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:06,007
- Was the fire really necessary?
- Ask them.

708
00:45:09,802 --> 00:45:13,347
- That's what I'm talking about!
- I'm so proud of you. Good job.

709
00:45:15,557 --> 00:45:17,143
What up, homes?

710
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:23,023
You guys were great out there.

711
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:25,443
Thanks. I'm Jimmy.

712
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:27,195
I know. Katie.

713
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:28,820
I know.

714
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:34,244
I like your buttons.

715
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:37,329
Jimmy, come on. The scores are up.

716
00:45:37,746 --> 00:45:39,414
- Good luck.
- You, too.

717
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:41,708
Did you see that?
They were actually pretty good.

718
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,628
Yeah, they were really good. Way to go.

719
00:45:43,753 --> 00:45:45,170
None of what they did
was on your video.

720
00:45:45,295 --> 00:45:47,090
That's all right.
Let's not let them get into our heads.

721
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:49,300
Into our head?
Not only did we embarrass Marky Mark,

722
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:50,969
we let down the Funky Bunch.

723
00:45:51,094 --> 00:45:54,472
<i>... 5.9, 5.9, 5.8, 6.0!</i>

724
00:45:54,597 --> 00:45:55,597
- Yes! Yes!
- Oh, my gosh!

725
00:45:55,722 --> 00:45:58,059
We're going to Montreal, bitch!

726
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:01,896
Well, it's all smiles
here in the Crest kiss and cry area.

727
00:46:02,021 --> 00:46:05,065
You're the guys everybody's
talking about. How does it feel?

728
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,402
You know, we're just so grateful
for this wonderful opportunity

729
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:09,778
to be out here on the ice again...

730
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:12,824
Michaels and MacElroy are a freight
train from hell, okay?

731
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:16,744
We're going straight up
the ass of the competition, Scott.

732
00:46:17,996 --> 00:46:19,914
I'm not gonna say wow, but wow!

733
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:24,168
They got by on 97 percent adrenaline
and three percent bullshit.

734
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:28,630
If they wanna take home the gold,
they gotta do something spectacular.

735
00:46:28,755 --> 00:46:29,840
Robert, I know where this is going.

736
00:46:29,965 --> 00:46:32,427
How many times
do you have to make the same mistake?

737
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:35,722
Till I get it right.
You gotta trust me, Jesse.

738
00:46:37,097 --> 00:46:40,726
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life
in a cage of fear.

739
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:47,942
Top of the morning. And it is a beaut.

740
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:52,112
Do you mind? I'm trying to eat here.

741
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,074
Just thought you'd like to see
what a skater's body really looks like.

742
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:58,702
Go ahead, drink it in. Don't be shy.

743
00:46:58,827 --> 00:47:02,623
Looking's for free.
Touching's gonna cost you something.

744
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:07,961
Checking out my ink?

745
00:47:08,503 --> 00:47:11,757
Some people refer to me
as the Illustrated Man.

746
00:47:11,882 --> 00:47:16,262
Each tattoo tells a different tale.
They're like chapters of my life.

747
00:47:16,387 --> 00:47:19,766
Really? So, what's that one about?

748
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:26,731
That one represents the dragon lady.
You might know her as Michelle Kwan.

749
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:30,652
That's Michelle Kwan, most decorated
figure skater in US history?

750
00:47:30,777 --> 00:47:33,070
- You tapped that?
- Sure did.

751
00:47:33,695 --> 00:47:36,114
But perfection can drive a woman mad.

752
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,159
She was ready to quit,
hang up her skates

753
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:41,496
settle down and pop out
a few little Chazzlings.

754
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:44,791
I couldn't let her do it, not the way I roll.

755
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:47,460
So, what's that one with the horse?

756
00:47:48,503 --> 00:47:50,380
My blonde Ukrainian she-devil.

757
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:52,632
Not Oksana Baiul?

758
00:47:52,757 --> 00:47:55,092
At 16, she won the gold, turned pro,

759
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:59,012
and was named one of Barbara Walters'
most fascinating persons of 1994.

760
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:03,393
Yeah. But don't let her fool you.
She's as cold as the ice she skates on.

761
00:48:04,059 --> 00:48:07,438
She's like dry ice.
Wait. She's colder than that.

762
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:09,648
- What's colder than dry ice?
- I don't know.

763
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:12,150
I'll tell you what is. Oksana.

764
00:48:16,697 --> 00:48:19,534
What about that one on your shoulder?
Who's that?

765
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:22,369
That one? It's nothing.

766
00:48:23,371 --> 00:48:25,414
What about you? You got any tats?

767
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:28,751
I had my face painted
at the Blueberry Festival one year.

768
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,586
Seems about right.

769
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:34,172
Well, I could have one.
I could have a killer one.

770
00:48:35,842 --> 00:48:39,304
I have a crush on the enemy,
Katie Van Waldenberg.

771
00:48:39,429 --> 00:48:40,679
Good choice, my man.

772
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:42,639
Yeah. How's that for forbidden love?

773
00:48:42,764 --> 00:48:45,643
I have no idea, but I'd like to find out.

774
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:48,855
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm calling her. Or rather, you are.

775
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,815
- I can't do that. It's crazy.
- It's not crazy.

776
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,108
What am I supposed to say?

777
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:54,152
- No, you can't. I can't.
- It's ringing. Go.

778
00:48:58,072 --> 00:49:00,199
- Sorry.
- Maybe it's Nike.

779
00:49:02,034 --> 00:49:03,202
Van Waldenberg Companies.

780
00:49:03,327 --> 00:49:05,163
Talk. Relax.

781
00:49:06,164 --> 00:49:09,083
Hi. It's Jimmy MacElroy. Is Katie there?

782
00:49:10,293 --> 00:49:11,753
It's MacElroy, for her.

783
00:49:11,878 --> 00:49:13,795
What? For me? Why?

784
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:15,882
- I can't do it.
- I'll coach you. Get on the phone.

785
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,342
Stranz?

786
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:21,387
<i>Hello?</i>

787
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:24,474
Okay. "Yo. It's the Mac attack.
What up?"

788
00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:28,061
Yo. Hi. It's the Mac attack. What up?

789
00:49:28,393 --> 00:49:32,148
Okay. Say, "Oh, my, you're just
catching me getting out of the shower."

790
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:34,650
- Sell yourself.
- Will you be quiet?

791
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,612
You know, you just caught me
getting out of the shower.

792
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:39,864
- She just got out of the shower.
- Oh, me likey.

793
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:41,907
- I have to call her back. This is so rude.
- No! Are you insane?

794
00:49:42,032 --> 00:49:44,952
- She's gonna hear you.
- Get back on the phone. Say, "Shower?

795
00:49:45,077 --> 00:49:47,956
"I gotta get me one of those
'cause I just got back from the gym

796
00:49:48,081 --> 00:49:50,166
"doing my squat thrusts."

797
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:53,460
I gotta...
Yeah, shower. I need one of those

798
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:56,965
'cause I just got back from the gym
doing my squat thrusts.

799
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,717
"Squat thrusts must be hard, real hard."

800
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:01,719
<i>Squat thrusts are hard.</i>

801
00:50:02,094 --> 00:50:03,972
- "Real hard."
- Real hard.

802
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:08,518
"They're hard, all right. But it's worth it
to get a sweet burn deep in your thigh."

803
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:12,563
It's worth it to get a deep burn
in my sweet thighs.

804
00:50:12,938 --> 00:50:16,025
"You know
how you can soothe a nasty burn?

805
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:18,570
"Pour some sweet cream on it."

806
00:50:18,902 --> 00:50:21,739
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what you can do for a burn?</i>

807
00:50:21,864 --> 00:50:23,074
<i>Pour sweet cream on it.</i>

808
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:25,201
Oh, my God, you've bagged a wild lynx.

809
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:28,121
Okay, say, "Sounds to me like
your cream needs to be whipped",

810
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:29,414
and then go...

811
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,545
I was wondering if you wanted
to get a snow cone sometime?

812
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,753
What?

813
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,757
Yeah. I would like to get a snow cone.

814
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:42,217
I haven't had a snow cone
in a couple of years, actually.

815
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:43,385
No, you have to be sexy.

816
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,597
Say you want a snow boner.
Snow boner.

817
00:50:45,722 --> 00:50:48,056
8:00 tonight. That sounds great.

818
00:50:48,181 --> 00:50:51,561
It will
"get me time to get my jugs waxed."

819
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:54,521
Okay. Well, I'll see you.

820
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:57,650
What happened? What's the word?

821
00:50:57,775 --> 00:51:00,110
8:00 tonight. We did it!

822
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:01,612
Oh, my God!

823
00:51:02,572 --> 00:51:03,947
Nice lift.

824
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:09,621
All right, listen up. You guys barely
squeaked by at Nationals.

825
00:51:09,746 --> 00:51:11,664
How are we gonna compete
against teams

826
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:13,248
that have been doing this for years?

827
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:14,791
There's only one way.

828
00:51:14,918 --> 00:51:19,005
Okay. What do you guys have
that none of the other teams have?

829
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:21,173
- Twin dongs?
- Exactly.

830
00:51:21,298 --> 00:51:23,717
We have to do something
that only two men can do together.

831
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:26,221
Something never seen before.

832
00:51:27,472 --> 00:51:29,474
Jesse, put in the tape.

833
00:51:30,182 --> 00:51:32,601
Come on. Put in the tape, Jesse.

834
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:40,902
Thank you.

835
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:46,074
Jimmy, I never told you this before,
but I used to coach pairs.

836
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,577
I was on track
to head up the Olympic squad.

837
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:52,454
I wanted it badly,
so I developed a move.

838
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:56,376
A move the likes of which the world
had never seen before.

839
00:51:56,668 --> 00:52:00,045
A move so revolutionary, so dangerous

840
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:04,800
that it would have catapulted the team
that stuck it straight to the top.

841
00:52:06,427 --> 00:52:08,221
And like many revolutionary ideas,

842
00:52:08,346 --> 00:52:11,224
it just scared the shit
out of the establishment.

843
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:13,726
So I quit.

844
00:52:14,226 --> 00:52:19,190
And I took it to the one place on earth
batshit crazy enough to give it a try.

845
00:52:20,315 --> 00:52:21,358
North Korea.

846
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:22,902
Of course.

847
00:52:23,027 --> 00:52:26,239
Behind the Bamboo Curtain, they call it

848
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:29,576
"The Iron Lotus."

849
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,376
Look at the grace, the beauty.

850
00:52:39,918 --> 00:52:43,005
They almost have it, until...

851
00:52:45,592 --> 00:52:47,050
Oh, my gosh.

852
00:52:51,472 --> 00:52:53,474
Okay.
What do you say, let's give it a try?

853
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,103
- Are you nuts?
- What? That's crazy.

854
00:52:57,228 --> 00:52:58,353
Come on, what are you talking about?

855
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:01,356
See, after all these years,
I know what went wrong.

856
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:02,525
The physics were off.

857
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,777
It was a man and a woman,
that's why it didn't work.

858
00:53:04,902 --> 00:53:07,487
You're two men. You should be fine.

859
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:12,492
Be warned.
The Iron Lotus demands your respect.

860
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:14,579
She has no time for lone wolves, Chazz.

861
00:53:14,704 --> 00:53:17,206
Jimmy, you've gotta be willing
to improvise.

862
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:19,458
You two are the last pieces
of the puzzle.

863
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,376
Go on! Fit them together!

864
00:53:27,382 --> 00:53:29,260
Keep your speed up.

865
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:31,262
Keep it up!

866
00:53:33,264 --> 00:53:35,724
Jimmy! Don't let your legs buckle!

867
00:53:36,184 --> 00:53:39,103
Come on, Chazz, focus! Focus!

868
00:53:46,902 --> 00:53:48,112
My nut-sack!

869
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,907
You gotta be careful, man.
Unlike you, I actually use these things.

870
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:53,451
Oh, yeah? Well...

871
00:53:53,576 --> 00:53:58,121
Well, well, yeah, you're right.
I'll try to be more careful next time.

872
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:00,041
Sorry.

873
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:04,045
Look, I didn't mean to drag your balls
into the discussion.

874
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,548
That was uncalled for.
They're fine, I overreacted.

875
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:10,217
All right, gentlemen,
let's get up and try it again.

876
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:19,393
Let's do this.

877
00:54:27,193 --> 00:54:29,695
This was my favourite place growing up.

878
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,739
By the way, you look really nice.

879
00:54:31,864 --> 00:54:36,034
Oh, really?
I like your glitter-tooth necklace thing.

880
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:37,579
Oh, thanks.

881
00:54:38,246 --> 00:54:40,748
Foy, can I have another blue one?

882
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:45,753
You guys were so good at Nationals,
it scared my brother and sister.

883
00:54:45,878 --> 00:54:49,007
- They wanted me to spy on you.
- Really?

884
00:54:49,132 --> 00:54:50,925
Is that why you're going out
with me right now?

885
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,135
No!

886
00:54:53,469 --> 00:54:54,721
Really.

887
00:54:55,262 --> 00:54:58,932
I don't care if they win.
I don't care about skating at all.

888
00:54:59,057 --> 00:55:01,686
I mean, really,
what's so great about skating, anyway?

889
00:55:01,811 --> 00:55:04,521
It's basically just gliding,
trying not to fall,

890
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:06,983
with a couple of jumps thrown in, right?

891
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:10,445
And Spandex and glitter. Egos.

892
00:55:11,278 --> 00:55:12,322
Ice blows.

893
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:16,784
Sorry.

894
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:20,914
But it's not the ice.
It's what the ice lets you do.

895
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:24,958
Out there, I feel like I can do anything.

896
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:28,545
It's the only place
where life makes sense.

897
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,759
You've never skated?

898
00:55:32,884 --> 00:55:34,635
When I was a kid, a little.

899
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,679
But my brother and sister
don't like anyone to steal their focus.

900
00:55:37,804 --> 00:55:39,766
My life was nothing but focus.

901
00:55:39,891 --> 00:55:41,934
You know what I got
for my tenth birthday?

902
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:45,271
A six-pack of protein shakes
and a subscription to <i>Men's Health.</i>

903
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:47,231
I didn't have a tenth birthday.

904
00:55:47,356 --> 00:55:50,193
My sister told all my friends
I was in jail for armed robbery.

905
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:53,487
When I was nine, my dad insisted
on having me circumcised

906
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:55,280
to minimise wind resistance.

907
00:55:55,405 --> 00:55:58,992
While driving me to skating practice,
my parents were in a fatal accident.

908
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:00,702
My brother and sister
blame me for their death

909
00:56:00,827 --> 00:56:03,831
and they force me to work for them
like a slave.

910
00:56:24,226 --> 00:56:25,311
Wow.

911
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:29,898
I never really thought of that
as a romantic story before.

912
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:44,329
So, how'd it go with your lady?
Carve up any ice with your wiener?

913
00:56:44,454 --> 00:56:46,958
All right, ladies, tea party's over.

914
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:50,878
We got two days till Montreal.
I wanna see an Iron Lotus.

915
00:56:57,594 --> 00:56:59,137
Okay, try it again.

916
00:56:59,971 --> 00:57:02,472
You're gonna kill him! Watch the blade!

917
00:57:02,724 --> 00:57:03,849
Come on!

918
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:09,355
Try it again!

919
00:57:14,985 --> 00:57:17,362
One more. I'm really close.

920
00:57:24,077 --> 00:57:28,416
<i>Hello, and welcome, everyone,</i>
<i>to the Orbitz World Wintersport Games</i>

921
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,585
<i>here in beautiful Montreal, Canada.</i>

922
00:57:32,295 --> 00:57:35,632
<i>The world turns its eyes</i>
<i>now to this frozen sanctuary</i>

923
00:57:35,757 --> 00:57:38,675
<i>as the globe's finest athletes</i>

924
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,679

925
00:57:42,137 --> 00:57:46,059
<i>And so, now we are honoured</i>

926
00:57:46,184 --> 00:57:51,063
<i>and spectacle of these,</i>
<i>the 20th World Wintersport Games.</i>

927
00:57:57,362 --> 00:57:59,155
Didn't you once say, and I quote,

928
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,407
"Jimmy MacElroy
is a lifeless robot on the ice"?

929
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:05,161
- He would never say such a...
- Yes, I did.

930
00:58:05,286 --> 00:58:08,706
But I was referring
to the precision and beauty of robots.

931
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:10,583
If they'd published
the rest of the quote...

932
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:13,795
They did publish the rest of your quote.
You go on to say,

933
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,838
"I've had lint at the top of my ass crack

934
00:58:15,963 --> 00:58:19,007
"with more personality
than that Daddy's boy." End quote.

935
00:58:19,132 --> 00:58:21,677
All right,
Mr Smart Reporter, showing off.

936
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:25,889
You figured out how to work
the Google on the Internet machine.

937
00:58:26,014 --> 00:58:27,684
Well, here's a new quote for you,
all right?

938
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:31,980
Chazz Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy
are figure skating. Boom!

939
00:58:32,105 --> 00:58:33,313
Boom!

940
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:38,152
Jimmy! Has pairs skating
helped your popularity?

941
00:58:38,777 --> 00:58:41,405
Absolutely.
I have the best fans in the world.

942
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,576
I mean,
we have the best fans in the world.

943
00:58:49,581 --> 00:58:51,833
No, that's in the other room.

944
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:02,510
Boom.

945
00:59:03,887 --> 00:59:05,054
Nice.

946
00:59:06,054 --> 00:59:08,599
Great! Press loves them,
and now so do the sponsors.

947
00:59:08,724 --> 00:59:09,851
Stranz!

948
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:14,688
So, Katie, it looks like your date
went really well the other night, huh?

949
00:59:14,813 --> 00:59:17,650
What? I guess so. Why?

950
00:59:17,775 --> 00:59:19,902
No reason. I was just wondering
how it went. Did it go well?

951
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:22,530
- Yeah, we had snow cones...
- Oh, that's so great.

952
00:59:22,655 --> 00:59:24,865
We want you to turn your attention
to Chazz now.

953
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:25,992
What?

954
00:59:26,117 --> 00:59:29,077
MacElroy's heart is like
a beautiful apple that's in your hand

955
00:59:29,204 --> 00:59:30,829
and now you need to bite it.

956
00:59:30,954 --> 00:59:33,791
- Nothing breaks up a team faster than...
- Herpes.

957
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:35,710
Jealousy.

958
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,338
No. I'm not gonna make
Chazz Michael Michaels

959
00:59:38,463 --> 00:59:39,463
fall in love with me.

960
00:59:39,588 --> 00:59:41,632
Who's talking about love?
We just want you to have sex with him.

961
00:59:41,757 --> 00:59:44,385
What? No!
I am not gonna have sex with Chazz.

962
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,429
Come on, Katie.
Do the honourable thing here.

963
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:50,516
The honourable thing is to walk away
and that is exactly what I'm doing.

964
00:59:50,641 --> 00:59:54,603
Okay. Stranz, let her go. It's okay.
She's made up her mind.

965
00:59:55,855 --> 00:59:57,773
We'll just move on to Plan B.

966
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:01,235
- What's Plan B?
- I'm sorry, don't worry about that.

967
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,405
You stood your ground. Good for you.
We respect that.

968
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:07,032
But if something should happen
to your new boyfriend's leg,

969
01:00:07,157 --> 01:00:10,452
I don't know, under his knee,
or above his ankle?

970
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:13,831
At least you did the honourable thing.

971
01:00:19,336 --> 01:00:22,215
- Where're you going?
- Sex addicts meeting.

972
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,425
- "Turn weakness into strength."
- Good for you.

973
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:28,096
Thanks, brother man.
Have a good night.

974
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:29,389
See ya!

975
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:34,476
This must be for you.

976
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,532
So glad you're all here.

977
01:00:48,032 --> 01:00:50,617
Okay, let's get started.

978
01:00:50,952 --> 01:00:54,581
Chazz, would you like
to start the day off by sharing?

979
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:58,083
I was just trying to find some peace.

980
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,253
A haven,
a place where I could feel safe.

981
01:01:02,255 --> 01:01:04,257
And then what happened?

982
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:07,885
Well, she was my yoga instructor.

983
01:01:09,887 --> 01:01:11,972
So I knew she was limber.

984
01:01:12,264 --> 01:01:16,728
But, Chazz, you realise this would just
set you back

985
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:19,563
and further hurt your progress

986
01:01:19,688 --> 01:01:21,900
in maintaining control over your libido,
correct?

987
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:24,193
Yes. Thank you, Taylor.

988
01:01:24,902 --> 01:01:26,237
Definitely.

989
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:32,619
Until her friend, a massage therapist,
walked in the door naked.

990
01:01:32,744 --> 01:01:33,786
Easy, Chazz.

991
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:35,371
With a big bottle of canola oil

992
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:39,375
and a monkey who was trained
to work on a video camera.

993
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,585
And she rocked my world.

994
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:43,003
Guys!

995
01:01:43,128 --> 01:01:47,090
Chazz, I have asked you to leave before
and I don't wanna do it again.

996
01:01:47,217 --> 01:01:48,300
Taylor, come on, man.

997
01:01:48,425 --> 01:01:52,054
Let's just move on.
Who'd like to talk about Chlamydia?

998
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:55,182
Syphilis, gonorrhoea, et cetera.
Should we...

999
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:58,811
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I was

1000
01:02:00,063 --> 01:02:02,523
having sex. A lot.

1001
01:02:02,648 --> 01:02:04,400
Welcome. Welcome.

1002
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:06,902
Why don't you go ahead
and introduce yourself?

1003
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:08,445
I know her.

1004
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,030
I'm Katie.

1005
01:02:10,155 --> 01:02:11,282
And?

1006
01:02:12,157 --> 01:02:14,077
Oh, and I'm a sex addict.

1007
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:15,369
Hi, Katie.

1008
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:16,621
Hey, Katie.

1009
01:02:17,956 --> 01:02:21,041
Wow, so, you're a sex addict, too.

1010
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:23,210
Sex, sex, sex. What can I say?

1011
01:02:23,335 --> 01:02:27,340
Right. Right. I mean, you said it all.
It's such a burden.

1012
01:02:27,465 --> 01:02:30,217
I mean, people don't realise what
we go through on a day-to-day basis.

1013
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:33,429
Why don't you come to my room tonight
and we can comfort each other?

1014
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:35,264
11:55 sharp.

1015
01:02:39,143 --> 01:02:41,436
Come on, people, break it up!

1016
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:55,117
God grant me the serenity not
to have sex with my friend's girlfriend

1017
01:02:55,242 --> 01:02:59,204
the courage to go home tonight without
having sex with my friend's girlfriend

1018
01:02:59,329 --> 01:03:00,873
and the wisdom
to know that masturbation

1019
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:04,126
is sometimes
the most sensible solution.

1020
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:05,670
Yeah. Okay.

1021
01:03:09,882 --> 01:03:11,259
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1022
01:03:11,384 --> 01:03:13,760
You're right on time. Come in.

1023
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:20,351
Would you like some champagne?

1024
01:03:20,476 --> 01:03:22,853
No, I can't, I...

1025
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:25,940
Actually I just came by 'cause
I had something I had to say to you.

1026
01:03:26,065 --> 01:03:27,108
What?

1027
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:29,985
Do you have a bathrobe or a parka
you could...

1028
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,197
Sorry. I'm hot.

1029
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:34,532
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable

1030
01:03:34,657 --> 01:03:37,659
saying what you need to say
from the bed?

1031
01:03:37,784 --> 01:03:39,411
Probably not.

1032
01:03:39,536 --> 01:03:40,746
It's a Posturepedic.

1033
01:03:40,871 --> 01:03:44,041
Well, then, in that case,
it's good for my back,

1034
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:46,293
so might as well try it.

1035
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,880
Okay, here it goes.

1036
01:03:50,005 --> 01:03:54,092
I know that sex,
I know that sex addiction is a disease.

1037
01:03:54,219 --> 01:03:55,594
Oh, God, they feel so good.

1038
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:57,222
Oh, God, this is so wrong.

1039
01:03:57,347 --> 01:03:58,931
Jimmy's my friend.
I'm not gonna do this.

1040
01:03:59,056 --> 01:04:00,307
Wait. Do you really mean that?

1041
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:02,559
Yes, I think so. No.

1042
01:04:03,228 --> 01:04:05,771
Yes, I do. I do.
I can't go through with this.

1043
01:04:05,896 --> 01:04:06,981
Thank God.

1044
01:04:07,106 --> 01:04:08,900
- Oh, God, what a relief.
- Yeah.

1045
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,735
He's got a heart of gold.

1046
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:16,324
You sex demon! You, you sex fiend!

1047
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:18,492
No, you got it all wrong.

1048
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:21,538
Impure! Lmpure!

1049
01:04:21,663 --> 01:04:23,289
- Jimmy, wait!
- Hey, wait! Brother man!

1050
01:04:23,414 --> 01:04:25,500
- Nothing happened!
- Jimmy!

1051
01:04:27,626 --> 01:04:29,503
Wait! Jimmy!

1052
01:04:29,628 --> 01:04:31,505
- Get away!
- Jimmy! No!

1053
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,632
Damn it.

1054
01:04:37,554 --> 01:04:39,764
Come on, pick up. Come on, buddy.

1055
01:04:39,972 --> 01:04:43,016
<i>Hey, it's Jimmy.</i>
<i>If you can dream it, you can do it.</i>

1056
01:04:43,184 --> 01:04:44,768
Jimmy, it's me, Chazz.

1057
01:04:44,893 --> 01:04:48,481
Look, what happened back there,
so not a big deal.

1058
01:04:48,606 --> 01:04:53,110
Just think of it as like a boob handshake
between me and your lady's...

1059
01:04:53,235 --> 01:04:56,864
Look, that's not coming out right.
I'll explain it. Call me back, please.

1060
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:58,574
It's me, Chazz.

1061
01:04:59,951 --> 01:05:01,536
I'm committed to this thing
called friendship.

1062
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:02,786
And I ain't going nowhere.

1063
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:05,414
And if you think I'm going anywhere,
you're wrong. You know why?

1064
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:07,708
Because I will not back down, ever!

1065
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:11,838
I've won a lot of radio contests,
because I refused to get off the line!

1066
01:05:11,963 --> 01:05:16,425
If we went to a Halloween party dressed
as Batman and Robin, I'd go as Robin.

1067
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:18,177
That's how much you mean to me.

1068
01:05:18,302 --> 01:05:20,554
That was stupid that I said that.
You know what? No.

1069
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:23,141
I don't think that's stupid.
I'm glad that I said that.

1070
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:24,976
Hey, turd-face, guess what?

1071
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:26,476
I've taken every single one
of your teddy bears,

1072
01:05:26,603 --> 01:05:28,813
and I've stuffed them down my pants.

1073
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:32,567
Hey, yikes. Sorry.

1074
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,322
For about a month,
my urine smelled like marshmallows.

1075
01:05:38,947 --> 01:05:41,909
<i>Don't wanna close my eyes</i>

1076
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:47,331
<i>Don't wanna fall asleep</i>
<i>'Cause I miss you Jimmy</i>

1077
01:05:47,664 --> 01:05:51,251
<i>And I don't wanna miss a thing</i>

1078
01:05:52,003 --> 01:05:55,130
<i>So call me back now!</i>

1079
01:05:58,384 --> 01:06:00,929
<i>It's Jimmy.</i>
<i>If you can dream it, you can do it.</i>

1080
01:06:01,554 --> 01:06:06,434
Hey, it's me again. Jimmy, please,
call me back, so I can explain.

1081
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:13,315
Wow! Nice work.
Somebody got busy in a big way.

1082
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,193
Scene of the crime.

1083
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:17,862
For your information,
I didn't have sex with Chazz.

1084
01:06:17,987 --> 01:06:19,405
Fine. "Make love." Whatever.

1085
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:20,949
I didn't sleep with Chazz.

1086
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:22,824
- What?
- But congratulations!

1087
01:06:22,951 --> 01:06:25,911
- I feel as slimy as if I had.
- Where do you think you're going?

1088
01:06:26,036 --> 01:06:28,914
To make this right!
Jimmy needs to know the truth!

1089
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,625
You would do that to your own family?

1090
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,001
Don't give me that guilt trip.

1091
01:06:32,126 --> 01:06:35,380
After all we've done for you?
After all you did to Mom and Dad?

1092
01:06:35,505 --> 01:06:37,923
Mom and Dad
were not wearing their seatbelts

1093
01:06:38,048 --> 01:06:41,510
and they made
an improper left-hand turn.

1094
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:44,681
Come on, Katie, don't go.
We love you and stuff.

1095
01:06:44,806 --> 01:06:47,559
Look, it's up to us, okay?

1096
01:06:47,684 --> 01:06:52,021
We are forced to take Michaels and
MacElroy out of play, no matter what.

1097
01:06:52,146 --> 01:06:54,898
That might require some bad behaviour.

1098
01:06:56,233 --> 01:07:00,737
<i>Hello, and welcome to day three</i>
<i>of the Orbitz World Wintersport Games.</i>

1099
01:07:00,864 --> 01:07:03,490
<i>The best Chinese and Russian pairs</i>
<i>have fallen away,</i>

1100
01:07:03,615 --> 01:07:06,159
<i>setting up</i>
<i>the ultimate gold medal showdown.</i>

1101
01:07:06,286 --> 01:07:11,164
<i>Just two pairs remain. Both American.</i>
<i>Both hell-bent on reaching the top.</i>

1102
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:15,628
<i>And it's come down to this.</i>
<i>Tonight, they leave it all on the ice.</i>

1103
01:07:15,753 --> 01:07:17,005
<i>The big story here is</i>

1104
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,090
<i>the men's pairs figure skating team</i>
<i>of Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

1105
01:07:20,215 --> 01:07:22,467
These same-gendered sensations
have taken

1106
01:07:22,594 --> 01:07:25,429
centre ice in the hearts of
millions of skating fans everywhere.

1107
01:07:25,554 --> 01:07:27,764
They've literally taken this sport
by storm.

1108
01:07:32,978 --> 01:07:34,021
Jimmy.

1109
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,150
Jimmy's here at the arena, you ass.

1110
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:41,237
He's been staring at a pack of gum
for nine hours. What'd you do to him?

1111
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:43,030
I'm on my way.

1112
01:07:48,952 --> 01:07:50,204
Taxi!

1113
01:07:56,126 --> 01:08:00,297
World Wintersport Games.
And yes, I am Chazz Michael Michaels.

1114
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:03,509
- Hey, Stranz.
- Hi.

1115
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:10,349
<i>Skaters, please clear the ice</i>
<i>in preparation for the pairs competition.</i>

1116
01:08:24,363 --> 01:08:25,782
Thank you so much.

1117
01:08:26,658 --> 01:08:28,326
Oh, my gosh. Can you...

1118
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:33,122
Sorry, Chazz. Nothing personal.

1119
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:37,710
Actually, it's quite the opposite.

1120
01:08:37,835 --> 01:08:41,256
See, your days of
stealing the spotlight are over.

1121
01:08:45,009 --> 01:08:47,011
You crazy bastard!

1122
01:08:55,353 --> 01:08:56,645
Damn it.

1123
01:09:03,987 --> 01:09:05,445
What are you doing?

1124
01:09:09,117 --> 01:09:10,784
You are evil. Pure evil!

1125
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:13,496
Your whole family's evil! Your brother.

1126
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:15,331
And most of all, your sister.

1127
01:09:15,456 --> 01:09:17,833
Don't even think about putting us
in the same league.

1128
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:20,336
If she was half the woman I was,
she would have done her job

1129
01:09:20,461 --> 01:09:22,380
and slept with your partner
like I told her to.

1130
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:24,090
- She didn't?
- No.

1131
01:09:24,215 --> 01:09:26,551
She couldn't, because of you.

1132
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:28,636
I don't get it.

1133
01:09:31,139 --> 01:09:34,100
Gross. Get me out of here!
Somebody help me!

1134
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:56,163
Whoever invented rope
was a real a-hole.

1135
01:09:56,788 --> 01:10:01,586
I'm late, sis.
My hair is just not cooperating.

1136
01:10:03,046 --> 01:10:04,588
Oh, crap.

1137
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:10,136
Okay.

1138
01:10:12,971 --> 01:10:15,182
Who's gonna save you now, Chazz?

1139
01:10:15,307 --> 01:10:19,061
Is Little Lord MacElroy gonna come
and meet you down here?

1140
01:10:33,909 --> 01:10:35,537
Oh, great.

1141
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:50,510
Hey, there!

1142
01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:54,430
What are you doing there?
No. Wait, wait. It's okay. No.

1143
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:56,807
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

1144
01:10:56,932 --> 01:10:58,643
No, please!

1145
01:11:20,372 --> 01:11:22,332
Let's do it, Chazz!

1146
01:11:22,457 --> 01:11:26,587
All right, Stranz.
Time for a little Chazzle Dazzle.

1147
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:41,101
Beautiful.

1148
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:44,771
I'm coming, Chazz.

1149
01:12:37,908 --> 01:12:39,618
Give me your hand.

1150
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:42,247
- I won't hurt you.
- I'm coming for you, Chazz!

1151
01:12:42,372 --> 01:12:44,039
Damn it, Stranz.

1152
01:12:45,123 --> 01:12:47,042
Have you seen Jimmy?
I can't find him anywhere.

1153
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:48,377
Oh, yeah. He was here a minute ago.

1154
01:12:48,502 --> 01:12:51,506
And if you find him, would you tell him
to get his ass down here?

1155
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:01,099
I really appreciate this.

1156
01:13:01,224 --> 01:13:05,019
That man who's chasing us
is trying to kill me. So, thanks.

1157
01:13:29,711 --> 01:13:32,838
Who are you supposed to be anyway?
Rod Serling?

1158
01:13:33,297 --> 01:13:34,841
JFK.

1159
01:13:36,341 --> 01:13:40,137
- It's gonna make sense.
- No, no, no. It'll be fine. Yeah.

1160
01:13:41,555 --> 01:13:42,931
That's lame.

1161
01:13:47,729 --> 01:13:49,730
Try to get through that!

1162
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,823
Don't make me kill her.

1163
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:12,170
Snowflake!

1164
01:14:54,837 --> 01:14:56,046
<i>From the United States,</i>

1165
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:59,716
<i>the pairs team of</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg.</i>

1166
01:15:01,552 --> 01:15:04,846
<i>So, the favourites,</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg</i>

1167
01:15:04,972 --> 01:15:06,265
<i>now taking the ice.</i>

1168
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:08,016
<i>As Marilyn Monroe and JFK,</i>

1169
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:11,354
<i>they'll be dramatising</i>
<i>a forbidden romance, Jim.</i>

1170
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:16,149
<i>I take pride in the words,</i>
"Ich bin ein Berliner!"

1171
01:15:31,457 --> 01:15:33,877
<i>Calling for preparation on ice</i>
<i>of the United States team</i>

1172
01:15:34,002 --> 01:15:36,003
<i>of Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

1173
01:15:38,046 --> 01:15:40,216
<i>Well, that was an interesting take</i>
<i>on American history.</i>

1174
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:42,342
<i>Indeed. I think it's worth noting,</i>

1175
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:45,846
<i>the fantastic attention to detail</i>
<i>this pair has demonstrated.</i>

1176
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:49,766
<i>An absolutely seamless use of props</i>
<i>integrated into choreography,</i>

1177
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:53,645
<i>that is both physically impressive</i>
<i>and artistically moving.</i>

1178
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:56,815
<i>A rare ballet of ice and history.</i>

1179
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:00,528
<i>And those scores keep Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild in first place,</i>

1180
01:16:00,653 --> 01:16:02,738
but Michaels and MacElroy are up next.

1181
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:06,909
Coach! Coach! Did I make it in time?
Where's Chazz?

1182
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:08,161
Where the hell you been?

1183
01:16:08,286 --> 01:16:10,496
Your partner's not here in 30 seconds,
I have to disqualify you.

1184
01:16:10,622 --> 01:16:11,622
I know, I know.

1185
01:16:12,664 --> 01:16:16,961
We're finished. Done. That's it. It's over.
Damn it. Just like that.

1186
01:16:18,046 --> 01:16:20,172
Coach, he'll be here.

1187
01:16:31,975 --> 01:16:33,435
<i>Skaters to the ice.</i>

1188
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,564
<i>Twenty seconds to disqualification.</i>

1189
01:16:36,689 --> 01:16:40,068
<i>Jimmy MacElroy stands alone</i>
<i>at centre ice.</i>

1190
01:16:40,193 --> 01:16:43,320
<i>And you have to wonder</i>
<i>what is going on.</i>

1191
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:46,533
<i>Well, this is Rice without Montana.</i>

1192
01:16:47,115 --> 01:16:50,828
<i>Ali without Frazier.</i>
<i>Han Solo without Chewbacca.</i>

1193
01:16:51,954 --> 01:16:53,163
Jimmy!

1194
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,045
Hey, Jimmy! Jimmy!

1195
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:00,421
Chazz!

1196
01:17:00,837 --> 01:17:04,634
Hey, I didn't sleep with Katie!

1197
01:17:04,759 --> 01:17:07,511
- I know!
- We didn't even get to second base.

1198
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:09,555
Well, maybe I did.

1199
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,015
What I felt in my pants
was weird and shameful.

1200
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,810
Okay, we can discuss that later!

1201
01:17:13,935 --> 01:17:14,978
You kind of have to be down here
right now

1202
01:17:15,103 --> 01:17:16,436
or we're gonna be disqualified!

1203
01:17:16,563 --> 01:17:18,355
Katie is not a whore!

1204
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,359
Okay, I get it! Just stop talking!

1205
01:17:21,484 --> 01:17:22,860
Okay! Okay!

1206
01:17:22,985 --> 01:17:24,904
<i>- Skaters to the ice.</i>
- Hold on!

1207
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:27,657
<i>Ten seconds to disqualification.</i>

1208
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:32,203
Wow.

1209
01:17:39,877 --> 01:17:41,045
Yeah!

1210
01:17:48,886 --> 01:17:52,556
<i>Wow! A dramatic entrance</i>
<i>for Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

1211
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:55,185
I'm okay!

1212
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,561
I'm all right!

1213
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:02,192
I'm okay.

1214
01:18:08,198 --> 01:18:10,240
<i>And there's another</i>
<i>unique Michaels skill.</i>

1215
01:18:10,365 --> 01:18:13,619
<i>Out of his clothes in a hurry</i>
<i>when he has to.</i>

1216
01:18:13,744 --> 01:18:14,953
<i>And women's skating champion</i>

1217
01:18:15,078 --> 01:18:17,582
<i>Sasha Cohen</i>
<i>catches Michaels'jock strap.</i>

1218
01:18:17,707 --> 01:18:19,583
I love you, Chazz!

1219
01:18:27,007 --> 01:18:28,885
- I made it.
- I knew you would.

1220
01:18:29,344 --> 01:18:30,595
Let's capture the dream.

1221
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,514
Capture the... I love it.
Where'd you come up with that?

1222
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,184
- I have no idea where I came up with it.
- Cool.

1223
01:18:36,475 --> 01:18:38,645
- Let's kick some ice.
- Okay.

1224
01:18:43,649 --> 01:18:46,610
<i>Well, Scott, the boys seem to be</i>
<i>using a science fiction theme tonight.</i>

1225
01:18:46,735 --> 01:18:50,323
<i>Fitting, considering these two men</i>
<i>may very well be the future of the sport.</i>

1226
01:18:50,448 --> 01:18:51,698
<i>Well, I'll tell you something, Jim.</i>

1227
01:18:51,823 --> 01:18:54,202
<i>It's like these two men did</i>
<i>beam in from outer space,</i>

1228
01:18:54,327 --> 01:18:56,621
<i>to flip this sport inside out.</i>

1229
01:19:03,586 --> 01:19:05,128
<i>The lights are on and so is this crowd.</i>

1230
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:07,798
<i>A Mr Roboto to start the routine.</i>

1231
01:19:10,134 --> 01:19:12,427
<i>And they hit it beautifully!</i>

1232
01:19:14,846 --> 01:19:17,766
<i>Everything they do</i>
<i>is drenched in drama.</i>

1233
01:19:20,854 --> 01:19:23,021
<i>Side-by-side skate clashes.</i>

1234
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,409
<i>And more sparks!</i>
<i>Look at the athleticism here!</i>

1235
01:19:35,534 --> 01:19:37,412
<i>No other pair in the world could do this!</i>

1236
01:19:37,537 --> 01:19:39,913
<i>Fireworks display in Montreal.</i>

1237
01:19:40,038 --> 01:19:41,623
<i>Incredible.</i>

1238
01:19:46,837 --> 01:19:48,088
What are you doing?

1239
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:51,134
We're freestyling.
You're the steak, I'm the sizzle.

1240
01:19:51,259 --> 01:19:52,260
We didn't practise that.

1241
01:19:52,385 --> 01:19:55,721
Do it for Katie.
Burn up the ice with your red hot love.

1242
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:12,863
<i>Michaels and MacElroy</i>
<i>turn up the thermostat.</i>

1243
01:20:12,988 --> 01:20:15,867
These guys put the "bone" in Zamboni.

1244
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:17,618
It's over.

1245
01:20:17,743 --> 01:20:19,244
All the endorsements, everything gone.

1246
01:20:19,369 --> 01:20:21,663
Oh, my God, I can't get a real job.
It'll kill me.

1247
01:20:21,788 --> 01:20:24,751
God, I have to do everything
in this family.

1248
01:20:37,596 --> 01:20:40,265
<i>A serious stumble</i>
<i>in an otherwise perfect routine.</i>

1249
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:43,478
<i>Perfection's what they need if</i>
<i>they want to beat Stranz and Fairchild.</i>

1250
01:20:43,603 --> 01:20:45,646
- I think I broke my ankle.
- What?

1251
01:20:45,771 --> 01:20:48,149
I'm gonna put some weight on it to see.

1252
01:20:51,027 --> 01:20:54,154
<i>I don't know, Scott.</i>
<i>I'm not sure, interpretive dance moves</i>

1253
01:20:54,279 --> 01:20:55,823
<i>are gonna win these judges over.</i>

1254
01:20:55,948 --> 01:20:57,992
- What the hell are they doing?
- Something's wrong.

1255
01:20:58,117 --> 01:21:00,703
I can't do the Lotus
with a shattered ankle.

1256
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:03,163
I'm just a man, for God's sake.

1257
01:21:04,373 --> 01:21:05,625
We'll switch places.

1258
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,127
I swear to God, if you cut my head off.

1259
01:21:11,088 --> 01:21:13,173
They're going for the Iron Lotus,
in reverse.

1260
01:21:13,298 --> 01:21:15,760
My God.
This is happening all over again.

1261
01:21:19,055 --> 01:21:21,557
<i>They're picking up speed</i>
<i>for something spectacular.</i>

1262
01:21:21,682 --> 01:21:23,768
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>they might be trying something</i>

1263
01:21:23,893 --> 01:21:25,435
<i>I have never seen done.</i>

1264
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:28,021
<i>It is the fabled Iron Lotus.</i>

1265
01:21:28,146 --> 01:21:31,650
No! Don't do it! I was wrong!
It's suicide!

1266
01:22:16,112 --> 01:22:19,407
<i>And they nail it!</i>
<i>Unbelievable performance!</i>

1267
01:22:19,532 --> 01:22:22,202
<i>This crowd is going wild!</i>
<i>They're on their feet!</i>

1268
01:22:22,327 --> 01:22:26,663
<i>I never thought I'd see it with</i>
<i>my own eyes, the fabled Iron Lotus!</i>

1269
01:22:26,788 --> 01:22:29,917
<i>A historic event here in Montreal.</i>

1270
01:22:30,042 --> 01:22:33,087
Michaels and MacElroy
have brought the legend to life.

1271
01:22:33,337 --> 01:22:35,297
Scott, I seem to have wet my pants.

1272
01:22:35,422 --> 01:22:37,382
Chazz, Chazz. We did it!

1273
01:22:37,884 --> 01:22:40,011
- Did we win?
- I don't know.

1274
01:22:40,636 --> 01:22:42,721
I think I see the Virgin Mary.

1275
01:22:42,846 --> 01:22:44,556
No. That's not her.

1276
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:52,064
We got you, Mr Michaels. Let's go.

1277
01:22:54,442 --> 01:22:55,984
- Oh, I don't wanna die.
- You'll be okay.

1278
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:59,488
- I don't wanna die.
- Take a huff of that. Here we go.

1279
01:22:59,613 --> 01:23:01,157
I'm gonna have to cut your pants off.

1280
01:23:01,282 --> 01:23:04,868
Okay, but start up near the crotch.
That's a better access point.

1281
01:23:17,548 --> 01:23:18,800
You were incredible.

1282
01:23:18,925 --> 01:23:22,345
Really?
I thought my landing was all bad...

1283
01:23:27,266 --> 01:23:28,976
You've been practising.

1284
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:31,311
Chazz taught me some stuff.

1285
01:23:44,492 --> 01:23:46,034
Stranz Van Waldenberg.

1286
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,956
You're under arrest for the desecration
of an international icon.

1287
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:51,373
Snowflake.

1288
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,502
- It was her idea. She broke his ankle!
- What?

1289
01:23:56,628 --> 01:23:57,881
You idiot!

1290
01:23:58,006 --> 01:23:59,423
I hate you.

1291
01:24:06,597 --> 01:24:08,224
Come on now. Let's get out of here.

1292
01:24:08,349 --> 01:24:10,518
And that's why I was a sex addict.

1293
01:24:10,643 --> 01:24:12,936
Because no one ever loved me.

1294
01:24:13,645 --> 01:24:16,274
But I learned something here today.

1295
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:19,527
That ice doesn't belong here.

1296
01:24:20,569 --> 01:24:22,404
It belongs out there.

1297
01:24:22,654 --> 01:24:25,949
Out on the ice in an ice rink.

1298
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:29,244
I never had a father, okay?

1299
01:24:29,746 --> 01:24:31,413
But I don't care!

1300
01:24:31,788 --> 01:24:34,167
Because now I've got a brother.

1301
01:24:36,252 --> 01:24:37,962
This is my brother!

1302
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:41,048
And this is my brother's new girlfriend.

1303
01:24:42,759 --> 01:24:44,801
And she is not a whore.

1304
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,389
I'm in a lot of pain.
I feel like I'm gonna barf.

1305
01:24:48,515 --> 01:24:51,350
Chazz, they got to get you to a hospital.
Come on.

1306
01:24:51,475 --> 01:24:55,270
No. And miss the smell of sweet gold?

1307
01:24:56,939 --> 01:24:58,608
Not on your life.

1308
01:25:10,744 --> 01:25:11,954
Thank you.

1309
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:18,293
Jimmy, you did it!
The gold medal, baby! You did it!

1310
01:25:18,418 --> 01:25:21,296
I wanna wear the gold medal, naked.

1311
01:25:22,006 --> 01:25:23,423
Thank you.

1312
01:25:30,597 --> 01:25:34,685
I've got something I wanna show you.
I had it done last weekend.

1313
01:25:37,896 --> 01:25:42,318
That's you,
the wolf that runs with the Lone Wolf.

1314
01:25:42,443 --> 01:25:45,822
So that the Lone Wolf
never has to be alone again.

1315
01:25:45,947 --> 01:25:47,990
That's how much you mean to me, bro.

1316
01:25:48,115 --> 01:25:49,492
You were drunk when you got it,
weren't you?

1317
01:25:49,617 --> 01:25:51,703
Yes. Absolutely hammered.

1318
01:25:52,578 --> 01:25:54,956
- Welcome to the pack.
- Thanks.

1319
01:25:56,498 --> 01:25:58,083
Let's get outta here.

1320
01:25:58,208 --> 01:25:59,668
- Now?
- Yeah.

1321
01:27:50,279 --> 01:27:51,864
USA!

1322
01:27:52,364 --> 01:27:55,868
The gold medal has been won
by Jimmy and Chazz,

1323
01:27:55,993 --> 01:27:58,328
thanks to Hector's idea!

1324
01:27:58,997 --> 01:28:00,414
We did it, Hector!

1325
01:28:00,582 --> 01:28:02,375
Boom! We sure did.

1326
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:05,377
Thank you, Hector. He did it for us.

1327
01:28:06,045 --> 01:28:07,546
Where is Hector?

1328
01:28:07,671 --> 01:28:10,425
Here I am, guys. We did it. High-fives.

1329
01:28:10,884 --> 01:28:13,761
Cool. Way to go, guys. Gold medal.

1330
01:28:13,886 --> 01:28:16,764
You guys are the best. Hey, Jimmy?

1331
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:18,474
Yeah, Hector?

1332
01:28:18,932 --> 01:28:21,144
Can you give me a time-out here
with Chazz?

1333
01:28:21,269 --> 01:28:22,854
Yeah, sure. Are you crying?

1334
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:24,730
No. I'm fine.

1335
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:28,734
Okay. I'll go over here. Sandwich.

1336
01:28:29,402 --> 01:28:31,112
Hey. Chazz?

1337
01:28:31,613 --> 01:28:33,323
What is it? Boom.

1338
01:28:33,448 --> 01:28:36,492
I just wanna say
you guys are partners now.

1339
01:28:36,993 --> 01:28:38,703
I've been friends with him forever,

1340
01:28:38,828 --> 01:28:40,997
and you take good care of him.

1341
01:28:41,122 --> 01:28:42,664
I will. Boom.

1342
01:28:42,789 --> 01:28:44,751
He just, he loves food.

1343
01:28:44,876 --> 01:28:47,753
And he likes dreams and whispers

1344
01:28:47,878 --> 01:28:50,340
and his favourite movie is <i>Short Circuit</i>

1345
01:28:50,465 --> 01:28:52,425
and <i>Fried Green Tomatoes.</i>

1346
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:55,261
And just watch over him. All right?

1347
01:28:55,386 --> 01:28:58,305
I will. Boom.
You have my word. High-five.

1348
01:28:58,972 --> 01:29:00,475
God bless you.

1349
01:29:00,934 --> 01:29:03,228
Sweet. Jimmy, you can come back.

1350
01:29:03,353 --> 01:29:05,229
What you guys were talking about?

1351
01:29:05,354 --> 01:29:07,273
Just stuff, you know.

1352
01:29:07,398 --> 01:29:09,609
Hey, guys, you're amazing.

1353
01:29:09,734 --> 01:29:12,278
I just wanna say keep dreaming

1354
01:29:12,654 --> 01:29:15,405
because there's a lot of dreams
to be had.

1355
01:29:15,532 --> 01:29:16,823
USA.

1356
01:29:19,118 --> 01:29:20,411
USA.

1357
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,103
