2
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,069
In 1935, Ed Murrow
began his career with CBS.

3
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,432
When World War Two broke out...

4
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,193
...his voice brought
the battle of Britain home to us...

5
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,635
...through his "This Is London"
radio series.

6
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,999
He started with us all...

7
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,396
...many of us here tonight,
when television was in its infancy...

8
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,835
...with the news documentary show,
"See It Now".

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,672
He threw stones at giants.

10
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,837
Segregation, exploitation
of migrant workers...

11
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,031
...apartheid, J. Edgar Hoover...

12
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,839
...not the least of which, his historical
fight with Senator McCarthy.

13
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,390
He is the host of our enormously
popular show "Person to Person"...

14
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,753
...and tonight he is here
with his son, Casey...

15
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,397
...wife, Janet, and all of you
who he's worked with...

16
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,678
...inspired, lectured, and taught.

17
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,034
Ladies and gentlemen...

18
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,113
...the Radio-Television News Directors'
Association and Foundation welcomes...

19
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,350
...Mr. Edward R. Murrow.

20
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,230
This might just do nobody any good.

21
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,675
At the end of this discourse
a few people may accuse this reporter...

22
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,876
...of fouling
his own comfortable nest...

23
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,670
...and your organization may be
accused of having given hospitality...

24
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,035
...to heretical
and even dangerous ideas.

25
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,235
But the elaborate structure
of networks...

26
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,995
...advertising agencies, and sponsors
will not be shaken or altered.

27
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,116
It is my desire, if not my duty,
to try to talk to you journeymen...

28
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,590
...with some candor about what
is happening to radio and television.

29
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,557
And if what I say is responsible...

30
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,428
...I alone am responsible
for the saying of it.

31
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,670
Our history will be
what we make of it.

32
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,956
And if there are any historians
about 50 or 100 years from now...

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,598
...and there should be preserved...

34
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,399
...the kinescopes of one week
of all three networks...

35
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,315
...they will there find recorded
in black and white, and in color...

36
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,836
...evidence of decadence,
escapism...

37
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,390
...and insulation from the realities
of the world in which we live.

38
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,549
We are currently wealthy, fat,
comfortable, and complacent.

39
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,915
We have a built-in allergy to
unpleasant or disturbing information.

40
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,236
Our mass media reflect this.

41
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,475
But unless we get up off
our fat surpluses...

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,915
...and recognize
that television in the main...

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,039
...is being used to distract, delude,
amuse, and insulate us...

44
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,715
...then television
and those who finance it...

45
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,598
...those who look at it
and those who work at it...

46
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,388
...may see a totally
different picture too late.

47
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,512
Millie! Just the person
I wanted to see! Come here!

48
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,990
This goes at the top
of the Roy Campanella piece.

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,149
Yes! Give me a half an hour.

50
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,992
I may need it
a little quicker than that!

51
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,072
- Can I get some coffee first?
- Come on! Get me some coffee!

52
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,195
Morning, Johnny!

53
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,272
I have some new notes that go
with the Tito footage for Fred.

54
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,554
Fred's gonna be in
in an hour.

55
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,712
I already put them on his desk.
Can you just make sure that...

56
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,473
...he doesn't look at the film
until he reads the notes?

57
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,834
- Yes.
- Thank you.

58
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,149
Hey, Joe! Shirley!

59
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,915
- What's going on in here?
- What do you mean?

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,831
Two attractive people
alone in the copy room!

61
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,148
Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me.

62
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,673
He'll fire both of us, Shirley.

63
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,433
- Rules are made to be broken!
- You can afford to say that.

64
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,074
Let me see this.

65
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,030
- It's simply a loyalty oath.
- To CBS? - And to America.

66
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,713
You promise to be a loyal American?

67
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,870
I know. All of the reporters
have signed this.

68
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,598
Who are you promising this to?
CBS?

69
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,591
Fred signed it.
Murrow signed it.

70
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,999
- Murrow signed it?
- Yeah.

71
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,072
Are you now
or have you ever been...

72
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,310
I thought it was a joke,
but there's a lot of pressure.

73
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,834
...on the Attorney General's list
of subversive groups?

74
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,036
- I don't know.
- Let's think about it.

75
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,556
What is it really saying? Is it a civil
liberties issue or censorship?

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,870
Am I simply stating to CBS
that I'm not a Communist?

77
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,190
- Murrow signed this?
- And Fred and Stanton.

78
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,317
- Maybe you should talk to Murrow.
- Maybe I should sign it.

79
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,113
If you don't sign this,
are you and I a target?

80
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,197
If I don't sign it,
they'll fire me.

81
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,355
Sign it.

82
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,830
Finally we can tell everyone
the truth.

83
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,356
If I could express it
in what's in my heart now...

84
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,918
...I'd do it in the terms
of the poet who once said...

85
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,711
..."Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower
I bring to you."

86
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,636
"Yes, 'tis but a violet..."

87
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,993
"...glistening with dew."

88
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,350
"But still in its heart
there lie beauties concealed."

89
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,992
"So in our heart..."

90
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,873
"...our love for you..."

91
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,308
"...lies unrevealed."

92
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,789
I used to...

93
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,510
...pride myself on the idea
that I was a bit... tough...

94
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,190
...especially over the past
18-19 months, when we've been...

95
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,712
...kicked around,
and bullwhipped, and damned.

96
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,234
I didn't think that...

97
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,318
...I could be... touched very deeply.

98
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,670
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough, Leo.

99
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,716
- It's short.
- How long is the piece?

100
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,472
It's 4 minutes,
but we can cut it down.

101
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,233
It can't stand alone, but it might be
a nice companion piece.

102
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,550
Let's go through this one more time.
Palmer!

103
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,837
Yep, got a call from the office
of Senator Morse this morning...

104
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,912
...interested in setting up
a debate possibly with Senator Kerr...

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,355
...over the comments
Bentsen made on last night's show.

106
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,557
Secretary of Agriculture? Good idea!
Can they do it by this week?

107
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,108
No, it would have to be 2 weeks
at the earliest...

108
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,397
...depending on Morse's schedule.
But still it's a great idea.

109
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,677
Let's follow up on that.
"Hoover speaks on Benjamin Franklin."

110
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,752
We're having better luck
with Mr. Benjamin Franklin...

111
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,034
...than with Mr. Hoover.

112
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,475
It may progress better
as a "Person to Person".

113
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,915
"At home with Ben Franklin.
His electricity awards."

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,831
We've got the footage,
we need to contact him.

115
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,469
See if you can contact him and get the
shot. He wants to do the story. Joe!

116
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,232
Member Delbert Clark?
No longer with us.

117
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,754
- New York Times? - Yeah.
- Our friend at the Times.

118
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,434
This was yesterday morning,
they're saying it's...

119
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,076
- How old was he?
- 53. Sudden illness.

120
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,720
- Home of a friend.
- No, it's not an obit piece.

121
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,314
Natalie send some flowers
over there from us.

122
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,990
Couple things.
Case before the Supreme Court...

123
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,834
...involving the constitutionality of a
section of the Internal Security Act...

124
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,797
...provides for the deportation
of any alien...

125
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,519
...if he becomes a Communist
after entering this country.

126
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,075
Can you take this?

127
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,628
All right. McCarthy interrupting
his wedding trip...

128
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,076
...to take charge of the investigation
of Communist infiltration...

129
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,469
- Natalie, send some flowers.
- Poor Mrs. McCarthy!

130
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,596
May I finish?
It's national security!

131
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,353
- A real ladies' man!
- Well, they're in love.

132
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,038
We have no show for Tuesday, fellows.
So get out there and make some news.

133
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,037
Rob a bank. Mug an old lady.
Do something.

134
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,314
- You look at the Secretary Stevens
footage? - We will.

135
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,834
Watch it all the way to the end,
it's worth it.

136
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,509
Thank you, John.

137
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,719
There's not much there.

138
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,196
I can't tie it to the Eisenhower
in the back of the train piece.

139
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,711
- You ever spend any time in Detroit,
Fred? - Not recently.

140
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,157
There's a story here
in the Detroit News, Dexter, Michigan.

141
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,871
A kid named Milo Radulovich.

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,995
- Italian? - Irish. Air Force
kicked him out because his dad...

143
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,517
...read some Serbian newspaper.
- Was he a Communist? - I don't know.

144
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,352
- Who brought the charges?
- Air Force.

145
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,634
Charges were in a sealed envelope,
nobody saw them.

146
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,871
- Not even at the hearing? - He was
declared guilty without a trial...

147
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,632
...and told if he wanted
to keep his job...

148
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,871
...he had to denounce his father
and his sister. Thank you, Natalie.

149
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,315
- His sister?
- He told them to take a hike.

150
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,475
Let's send Joe and Charlie down there,
see if he's any good on camera.

151
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,755
Is he being brought
before the Committee?

152
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,395
No.

153
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,799
Then it's not McCarthy.

154
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,315
Isn't it?

155
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,639
Milo Radulovich.

156
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,073
What happens to your children...

157
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,958
...your 5-year-old and your 5-month-old
in terms of you?

158
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,873
If I am being judged
on my relatives...

159
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,709
...are my children going
to be asked to denounce me?

160
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,679
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

161
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,150
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

162
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,470
...why their father
is a security risk?

163
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,871
If the thing is let stand
as it, the first recommendation...

164
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,199
...was sent out by the board,
I see a chain reaction that...

165
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,155
...has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

166
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,834
Well, that's new.

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,558
You can't call this
a neutral piece.

168
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,791
The other side's been represented
rather well for the last 2 years.

169
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,393
The Air Force
hasn't gone on the record.

170
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,392
So you want to forego the standards
you've stuck to for 15 years...

171
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,674
...both sides, no commentary.

172
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,638
- We all editorialize. - I'm just
making sure we identify what...

173
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,312
We're giving them
the information up front...

174
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,913
...and we're asking them
to comment on it.

175
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,989
Frank, hold on.

176
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,312
I've searched my conscience.

177
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,552
I can't for the life of me
find any justification for this.

178
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,393
I simply cannot accept
that there are, on every story...

179
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,436
...two equal and logical sides
to an argument.

180
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,353
- Call it editorializing, if you'd like.
- It is editorializing.

181
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,078
They'll have equal time
to defend themselves.

182
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,151
Do you understand the position
you're putting us in?

183
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,073
We are all in this together,
if the Senate wants to investigate...

184
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,149
Do me a favor...

185
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,437
...avoid any big speeches about how
we're all in a big boat together!

186
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,669
Please, don't insult me.

187
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,159
I have to go back to Mr. Paley
and Alcoa, who sponsors your show...

188
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,870
...and also have
some military contracts...

189
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,032
...and I have to tell them that
they're going to be in a tough bind...

190
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,076
...because of a beef you had
with Joe McCarthy.

191
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,152
- We're not going at McCarthy.
- You're starting the goddamn fire.

192
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,471
Excuse me. Mr. Friendly,
there's a Colonel Anderson to see you?

193
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,916
- Colonel? - He's in your office.
There are two of them.

194
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,757
Maybe they liked the transcript,
and want to compliment us on it.

195
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,309
Excuse me.

196
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,799
Go after Joe Kennedy.
We'll pay for it.

197
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,271
I've got a great story about Hoover.

198
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,435
You know how many shows
you're going to have to do...

199
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,478
...to make up for this? - And Judy
and her daughter Liza next week.

200
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,551
No, no.
You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin!

201
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,919
I'll talk to Mr. Paley.

202
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,152
Alcoa won't pay for the ads.

203
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,635
And we probably won't either.
But nobody'll stop you.

204
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,835
How much are the ads?

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,037
- 3,000.
- I'll split it with Fred.

206
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,757
He just won't have Christmas presents
for his kids this year.

207
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,152
- He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that,
he loves Christmas.

208
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,838
- To be clear, you did speak
with the lawyers? - Yes, we did.

209
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,071
And we read the transcript. We've not
been allowed to see the footage.

210
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,072
Mack is on a plane from Dexter
right now with the last interviews.

211
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,832
We'll be going
right down to the wire.

212
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,391
Your show airs tomorrow. How can we
possibly approve and check...

213
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,029
...your story in the limited amount
of time you have given us?

214
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,669
With all due respect, you have been
invited to participate in this piece...

215
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,079
...not to approve it.

216
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,592
We are going with the story
that says that the U.S. Air Force...

217
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,114
...tried Milo Radulovich
without any evidence...

218
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,668
...and found him guilty
of being a security risk...

219
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,275
...without his Constitutional rights...
- You have not seen the evidence...

220
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,590
...and are claiming
he's not a security risk.

221
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,639
Wouldn't you guess that those who have
seen the contents of that envelope...

222
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,599
...might have a better idea of what
makes someone a danger to his country?

223
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,877
- Who? Who? - Or do you think
it should just be you that decides?

224
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,428
Who are the people?
Are they elected? Are they appointed?

225
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,080
Do they have an axe to grind?
Is it you, sir?

226
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,393
Or you, Colonel Jenkins? Do you know
the contents of that sealed envelope?

227
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,673
We have been a friend and ally of both
Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years.

228
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,391
The story you are going
to run tomorrow is without merit.

229
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,872
So before you take any steps
that cannot be undone...

230
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,800
...I strongly urge you
to reconsider your stand.

231
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,750
These are very dangerous waters
you are attempting to navigate.

232
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,232
We have had no hearing at all.
We have had no day in court.

233
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,599
In all the 32 years that I have been
a practicing attorney in Detroit...

234
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,157
...I have never witnessed such a farce
and travesty upon justice...

235
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,151
...as this thing has developed.

236
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,113
- Now this whole theory...
- Eddie, just take the first reel.

237
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,077
Tell John I left
5 seconds extra leader.

238
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,391
5 seconds! I got it! Palmer,
where's Joe? Have you seen Joe?

239
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,708
He's on his way
to the control room.

240
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,392
We're gonna have to do
the voice-over live.

241
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,198
Natalie, I need a booth
with a live mic.

242
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,474
Booth is there, it's already set.

243
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,676
We didn't have time
to sync the voice-over out.

244
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,512
That's not what I asked for.

245
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,997
It's missing the voice-over
on the last piece.

246
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,116
There's a commercial in the booth.
What shall I do?

247
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,839
- 2 minutes to air! - There's not
supposed to be a commercial!

248
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,148
Get him out of the booth!

249
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,676
2-and-a-half minutes
on the end piece.

250
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,394
Keep it down, please.
It's a little loud.

251
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,748
2 minutes to air, fellas.

252
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,317
- He's gonna add a joke.
- Charlie, loan me your lighter.

253
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,317
Make sure you know that I swap
with those two pieces of parents.

254
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,278
- As long as he talks fast because...
- He will talk fast.

255
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,315
We got the film.

256
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,674
Will it be ready?

257
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,149
You bet.

258
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,074
Funny thing, Freddy!

259
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,671
Every time you light a cigarette
for me, I know you're lying.

260
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,478
It occurs to me
we might not get away with this one.

261
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,512
Alcoa, the aluminum company
of America...

262
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,670
- 10 seconds.
- You fellas, ready? Okay.

263
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,148
Ready on camera 1.

264
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,958
5, 4, 3, 2.

265
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,914
Pan, camera 1.

266
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,355
Good evening.

267
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,315
A few weeks ago there occurred a few
obscure notices in the newspapers...

268
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,118
...about Milo Radulovich...

269
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,596
...a lieutenant
in the Air Force Reserves.

270
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,435
And, also, something about Air Force
regulation 35-62...

271
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,716
...which states that a man
may be regarded as a security risk...

272
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,917
...if he has close and continuing
association with Communists...

273
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,594
...or people believed
to have Communist sympathies.

274
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,870
Lieutenant Radulovich was asked
to resign in August. He declined.

275
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,236
A board was called
and heard his case.

276
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,790
At the end it was recommended that
he be severed from the Air Force...

277
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,156
...although it was also stated
that there was no question whatever...

278
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,992
...as to the Lieutenant's loyalty.

279
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,429
We propose to examine,
in so far as we can...

280
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,556
...the case of Lieutenant Radulovich.

281
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,433
Our reporter, Joe Wershba,
cameraman, Charlie Mack.

282
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,198
This is the town of Dexter, Michigan.
Population 1500.

283
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,751
This statue is at the end
of Ann Arbor Street erected by...

284
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,717
What did the General
tell you yesterday?

285
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,997
- A Colonel. There were two of them.
- That makes a General.

286
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,439
They weren't too pleased.

287
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,157
You're gonna get audited this year.

288
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,557
Not me, you. I told them
I didn't want to do the story.

289
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,314
- You always were yellow.
- Better than red.

290
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,229
In 10 seconds.

291
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,034
This is the sister,
Margaret Radulovich Fishman.

292
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,437
She neither defends nor explains
her political activities.

293
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,236
I feel that my activities,
be what they may...

294
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,153
...or my political beliefs
are my own private affair.

295
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,589
Are my children going to be asked
to denounce me?

296
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,639
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

297
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,790
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

298
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,876
...why their father
is a security risk?

299
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,470
I see, absolutely,
that this is a chain reaction.

300
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,958
If the thing is let stand as it,
the first recommendation...

301
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,158
...was sent out by the board
I see a chain reaction...

302
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,550
...that has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

303
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,358
Perhaps you will permit me
to read a few sentences...

304
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,432
...because I would like to say
rather precisely what I mean.

305
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,479
We have told the Air Force
that we will provide facilities...

306
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,518
...for any comments, criticisms,
or corrections it may wish to make...

307
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,511
...as to the case of Milo Radulovich.

308
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,116
We are unable to judge the charges
against his father or sister...

309
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,397
...because neither we, nor you,
nor they, nor the lawyers...

310
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,359
...nor the Lieutenant, know what was
contained in that manila envelope.

311
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,077
Was it hearsay,
rumor, gossip, slander...

312
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,199
...or hard ascertainable facts that
could be backed by credible witnesses?

313
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,669
We do not know.

314
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,631
We believe the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father.

315
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,116
Even though that iniquity be proved
and in this case it was not.

316
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,271
But we believe too that this case
illustrates the urgent need...

317
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,114
...for the Armed Forces to communicate
more fully than they have so far done...

318
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,555
...the procedures and regulations
to be followed...

319
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,949
...in attempting to protect
the national security...

320
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,679
...and the rights of the individual
at the same time.

321
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,314
Whatever happens in this area
of the relationship...

322
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,436
...between the individual
and the state...

323
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,033
...we will do it ourselves...

324
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,838
...it cannot be blamed on Malenkov
or Mao Tse-Tung or even our allies.

325
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,757
And, it seems to us,
Fred Friendly and myself...

326
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,596
...that this is a subject
that should be argued about endlessly.

327
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,917
Good night, and good luck.

328
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,635
And we're out.

329
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,619
May I tell you something
about yourself...

330
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:35,638
May I tell you something
about yourself...

331
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,029
...as a member
of the "Person to Person" audience?

332
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,111
Based on audience
research studies...

333
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,076
...you are well above average
in education and intelligence.

334
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,677
Your interests are wide,
from world affairs and science...

335
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,592
...to sports and show business.

336
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,997
And you have one characteristic
that's rather encouraging to me...

337
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,834
...and that's the fact that you are
not easily persuaded by advertising.

338
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,279
The makers of Kent considered
all these characteristics...

339
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,430
...when they chose
Mr. Murrow's program...

340
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,999
...to tell you about Kent.

341
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,109
Of all leading filter cigarettes,
Kent filters best.

342
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,352
If you try Kent with that in mind,
I think you'll agree...

343
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,512
...with many other thinking people
who have changed to Kent.

344
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,550
They find that it makes good sense
to smoke Kent and good smoking, too.

345
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,631
- Did you get the changes?
- Edward Murrow, "Person to Person"...

346
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,395
...on the CBS Television Network.
- No, no. You there? Okay. We got it.

347
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,993
Now back to Ed Murrow.

348
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,998
Not since the silent movies
and the idols they produced...

349
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,675
...has Hollywood witnessed the sort
of pilgrimage that is now going on.

350
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,675
Each day, oblivious to time,
weather, and the state of the world...

351
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,515
...sightseers head in the direction
of California's San Fernando Valley.

352
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,077
For there, at the end
of the tourist line, is Sherman Oaks...

353
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,357
...and the home Liberace
has built for himself and his mother.

354
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,229
This is the front and nobody knows
how many people have seen that view.

355
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,957
This is the back of the house
and that's Liberace's bedroom.

356
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,990
- Good evening, Lee.
- Good evening, Ed.

357
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,631
- What are you doing? - I'm dictating
my weekly syndicated newspaper column...

358
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,349
...and on my trusty tape recorder here,
I'm also dictating a book.

359
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,715
- It's an inspirational book.
- Lee, what about you?

360
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,678
Have you given much thought
to getting married and settling down?

361
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,274
Actually, I've given
a lot of thought to it...

362
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,114
...but I don't believe in getting married
just for the sake of getting married.

363
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,794
I want to some day
find the perfect mate...

364
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,073
...and settle down to what I hope will
be a marriage that will be blessed...

365
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,714
...by faith
and will be a lasting union.

366
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,751
I was reading
about lovely young Princess Margaret...

367
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,840
...and she's looking
for her dream man, too...

368
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,311
...and I hope she finds him some day.

369
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,235
Uh-huh. Lee, thanks very much
for letting us come and visit you.

370
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,435
It's been very pleasant.

371
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,590
And will you say good night
to your family for us?

372
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,318
- I certainly will.
- Thanks a lot.

373
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,152
- Good night, Ed.
- Good night, Lee.

374
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,199
Next week, we'll take you
to Beverly Hills, California...

375
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,840
...to the house of Mickey Rooney
and his new bride.

376
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,480
Until then,
good night, and good luck.

377
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,998
Good show, Mr. Murrow!

378
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,434
Excuse me, Mr. Murrow.

379
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,114
Could you take a look at this
and sign it for me, please?

380
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,192
Thank you. Dr. Stanton
would like to have a drink with you.

381
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,236
- When?
- Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar.

382
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,436
I can't. What the hell
is he doing there?

383
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,273
- I believe he's waiting for you.
- Just call him! - Fine.

384
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,920
- Oppenheimer next week.
- It's a good show, Ed.

385
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,954
- Hey, Don!
- Ed!

386
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,313
You're getting good at this!

387
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,558
They're gonna think you like it!

388
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,915
Pays the bills. How are you, Don?

389
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,149
Ah, it's...

390
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,709
...day to day.

391
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,238
If she saw how good you look
right now, she'd be back.

392
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,029
You tell her that
if you see her, will you?

393
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,552
- I read the O'Brian piece.
- Yeah, it's tough.

394
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,828
I'm a pinko.
I slant the news.

395
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,599
I'm just waiting for him
to say my wife left me too.

396
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,678
- Nobody worth their salt reads him.
- You read him.

397
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,792
Well, see, I rest my case.

398
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,513
- Does Paley read him?
- Bill Paley's not gonna do anything.

399
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,629
Thanks, Ed.

400
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,071
I just came by to tell you
how great the Lieutenant piece was.

401
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,232
- Thanks. - How's the fallout?
- Mostly good, surprisingly.

402
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,113
Is this the start?
Are you taking sides?

403
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,512
It's just a little poke
with a stick, see what happens.

404
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,398
You let me know if I can help.

405
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,999
But you're a pinko.

406
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,834
I'll see you.

407
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,720
Hey, Joe! What's all this
Radulovich junk you're putting out?

408
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,598
I can't talk to you now. I have
to get this film back to New York.

409
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,954
What would you say if I told you...

410
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,508
...that Murrow was
on the Soviet payroll in 1935?

411
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,558
- Uh! Charlie, you wanna...
- Sure. I'll set up outside.

412
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,158
McCarthy going
to the Eisenhower dinner?

413
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,676
- I have no idea. I don't keep the
Senator's calendar for him! - Really?

414
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,189
Have you ever seen any spy films?
You don't hand me a classified folder!

415
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,316
You're supposed to slip it
into my briefcase!

416
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,437
I didn't know who to give
this information to, Paley or Murrow.

417
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,956
As you can imagine, Fred and I
aren't very friendly. No pun intended.

418
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,753
No pun elocuted.

419
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,991
- What do you got, Donald?
- In short?

420
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,879
Murrow's been a Communist
sympathizer since the 1930's.

421
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,350
Member of the International Workers,
sponsored educational trips to Moscow...

422
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,874
...and on the Soviet payroll
in 1935. It's all there.

423
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,757
You wanna know
why that's not possible?

424
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,273
Why you'll lose this one?

425
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,631
Because everyone in this country...

426
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,712
...knows that Ed Murrow
is a loyal American, he's a patriot.

427
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,239
Did you know the word "gullible"
isn't in the dictionary?

428
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,198
- Can I give this to him?
- I'd love it! I have copies!

429
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,639
I think you guys go too far.

430
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,230
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck.

431
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,074
Yes, Mr. Paley.

432
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,598
Right away.
Yes, sir.

433
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,639
No, he hasn't called.

434
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,555
Yes, sir, the second he calls.
If you're in a meeting, shall I?

435
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,637
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

436
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,315
Mr. Murrow!

437
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,832
Mr. Paley will see you now.

438
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,115
- Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here.
- Thanks, Miss Mary.

439
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,353
- Hello, Ed. - Bill...
- Sit over here, will you?

440
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,195
How's Janet?

441
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,909
- Your son?
- All well, thanks. How's Babe?

442
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,077
She's fine. Her fundraiser
got rained on, so...

443
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,233
- Oh! That's why I never plan
on anything. - Really?

444
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,914
You'd never know.

445
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,868
Reading fiction?

446
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,277
I hope so. You tell me.

447
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,392
Now we know
how they're gonna come at us.

448
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,278
That's just the first shot.
Somebody's going to go down.

449
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,874
Have you checked your facts?
Are you on safe ground?

450
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,833
- Bill, it's time. Show our cards.
- My cards.

451
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,394
You lose, what happens?
5 guys find themselves out of work.

452
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,839
I'm responsible for a lot more
than 5 goddamn reporters. Let it go.

453
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,590
McCarthy will self-destruct,
Cohn, all of them.

454
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,035
You said Corporate
would not interfere with Editorial...

455
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,553
...and that the News
was to be left...

456
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,358
We don't make the news,
we report the news.

457
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,079
99% of the time he's wrong about those
he's marked as Communists.

458
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,116
If he goes too far,
the Senate will investigate him...

459
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,155
...and we will report on that.

460
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,391
But he's wrong 100% of the time when
he oversteps people's civil liberties.

461
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,549
And you're trying him in the press?

462
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,551
Does he get the right
to face his accuser?

463
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,029
You've decided on this
and you're presenting it as fact.

464
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,350
- What I am doing...
- I write your check.

465
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,149
I put you in your country house,
and I put your son through school!

466
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,990
You should have told me about this
before it went so far down the road!

467
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,749
Everyone of your boys needs to be
clean. Do you understand? No ties.

468
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,351
If Aaron's mother went to a group
fundraiser in 1932, he's out.

469
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,109
Hewitt, too. Anyone in that room.
You make no mistake...

470
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,710
...I will cut them loose. Corporate
won't interfere with Editorial.

471
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,076
But Editorial will not jeopardize
the hundreds of employees...

472
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,357
...of the CBS.
Do I make myself clear?

473
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,828
Yes?

474
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,311
Fellas, our next show is gonna be
about Senator McCarthy.

475
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,078
And we're gonna go right at him.

476
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,353
I don't need to tell you
how careful we have to be.

477
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,477
If we are to do this, Ed and I
need you to be straight with us.

478
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,676
We need to know,
for the good of the piece...

479
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,435
...if any of you have any connection,
if you subscribed to a newsletter...

480
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,317
...if you attended a party,
anything...

481
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,437
...anything that could compromise this,
anything at all...

482
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,110
...because now would be
the time to tell us.

483
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,271
Ed, I think I should excuse myself.

484
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,599
Palmer, you kidding?

485
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,954
My ex was a...
I wouldn't say she was a Communist...

486
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,998
...but she attended meetings.
It was before we were married.

487
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,913
I didn't even really know about it
until after the divorce.

488
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,318
But it was different then.
We were all on the same side.

489
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,593
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know. The thing is...

490
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,079
...somebody'll find out.

491
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,153
They'll hurt us with it.

492
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,995
I should have told you sooner, Ed,
I'm sorry.

493
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,149
Fred.

494
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,800
If none of us had ever read
a "dangerous" book...

495
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,070
...or had a friend
who was "different"...

496
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,720
...or never joined an organization
that advocated "change"...

497
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,519
...we'd all be the kind of people
Joe McCarthy wants.

498
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,870
We're gonna go with the story,
because the terror is in this room.

499
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,915
John! Jesse!
Go through the HUAC hearings.

500
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,754
Eddie! Palmer! Look at who
did the interviews and any speeches.

501
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,278
Okay, fellas, here we go.

502
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,751
His own words,
that's what we need.

503
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,274
...said that he wouldn't remove
a General from the Army...

504
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,238
...who supported a Communist Major.
I said, "Then, General..."

505
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,550
"...you should be removed
from any command."

506
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,669
"Any man who says, 'I will protect
and honor a General'..."

507
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,072
"...'who protects Communists', is not
fit to wear that uniform, General."

508
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,918
Ethically, we're fine.

509
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,675
But legally, if we air this, are we
leaking closed hearing testimony?

510
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,069
- But he chose to read it.
- We're not misquoting him.

511
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,436
- There are other reporters.
- If it's a legal issue, it's his.

512
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,839
I'll check with Campbell in Legal.

513
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,876
And wait till you hear
the bleeding hearts...

514
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,356
...scream and cry about our methods...

515
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,476
...of trying to drag the truth...

516
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,070
...from those who know
or should know...

517
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,713
...who covered up
a Fifth Amendment Communist Major.

518
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,879
But they say, "Oh..."

519
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,674
"...it's all right to uncover them,
but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy."

520
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,037
Did a Civil Liberties Union provide
you with an attorney at that time?

521
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,558
I had many offers of attorneys...

522
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,394
...and from the American Civil Liberties
Union, too. - The questions is:

523
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,313
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

524
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,868
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

525
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,955
The answer is yes.

526
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,429
You know the Civil Liberties Union
has been listed...

527
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,592
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

528
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,957
Mr. Chairman, this was 1932!

529
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,594
I know this was in 1932.

530
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,750
Do you know that they since
have been listed...

531
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,274
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

532
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,510
I do not know
that they have been listed so, sir.

533
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,875
- You don't know?
- I have heard that mentioned...

534
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,154
All right, Leo. Turn it off.

535
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,869
- I need those three cans of Stevens!
- Has anybody read this book yet?

536
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,190
It would be nice
if this guy isn't a Commie.

537
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,589
- Did Millie give it to you?
- I wanna read the book.

538
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,193
- Nobody else, Joe.
- I hear you, boss.

539
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,510
I'll put it on a kinescope,
push through the end.

540
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,749
Palmer, cut it at 2:30.

541
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,115
I prefer it one on each end,
let it run through.

542
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,952
It'd be more powerful.
Cut Kennedy?

543
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,759
Joe, file it for me.
I'll see the Mundt piece later.

544
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,319
Are we gonna make it, Fred?

545
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,710
We lost the telecine,
but we'll make it.

546
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,831
Did you finish your closing piece?

547
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,709
It's Shakespeare.

548
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,794
Write your closing.

549
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,317
My argument was if you just show
the images of McCarthy...

550
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,879
...it doesn't make any difference.

551
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,155
If you agree with him,
you're gonna hate the piece.

552
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,229
If you don't, you'll love it.

553
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,231
Maybe they should wait
till they get more footage.

554
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,753
I don't think
we can take that chance.

555
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,354
We've got to hit McCarthy
before he comes after Ed.

556
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,271
The blue one. They haven't gone
after the Alsops or Herb Block.

557
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,153
Honey, the Alsops and Herb Block...

558
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,315
...didn't work for the Institute
of International Education in 1934.

559
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,399
Then I guess it's time.

560
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,355
You worried?

561
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,359
I didn't think I was.

562
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,514
I don't know why.
I was in the office on Friday.

563
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,752
And I answered the phone,
it was Howard calling from London.

564
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,195
And he asked what was going on
with McCarthy.

565
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,394
And before I answered him, I turned
and looked over my shoulder...

566
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,473
...to see who was listening.
- And who was listening?

567
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,389
Chairman Mao...

568
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,839
I'll see you at the office.

569
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,318
- Hey, your ring!
- Uh!

570
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,879
Name me another wife...

571
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,959
...who reminds her husband
to take off his wedding ring...

572
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,112
...before he goes to the office.
- Ava Gardner.

573
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,755
Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow,
Mr. Paley's on the line for you.

574
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,230
- Maybe he wants to reimburse us
for those ads. - You'd like that!

575
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,357
- I would like that!
- This is Ed.

576
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,916
There's a Knickerbocker game tonight.
I've got front row seats.

577
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,348
Are you interested?

578
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,993
I'm busy bringing down
the network tonight, Bill.

579
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,235
Is that tonight?

580
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,108
We're covered, Bill.

581
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,035
All right.

582
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,396
- I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm
with you tomorrow. - Thanks, Bill.

583
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,715
Do you know the timing
on the first piece?

584
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,031
Can we hold all the calls, please?

585
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,396
Hold the calls till after the show.
Thank you.

586
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,836
- You fellas, awake down there?
- Okay.

587
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,833
- Just... what are we? 20?
- 30 seconds, Ed.

588
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,308
10 seconds.

589
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,831
5, 4, 3, 2.

590
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,559
And pan, camera one.

591
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,389
Because a report on Senator McCarthy
is by definition controversial...

592
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,030
...we want to say exactly
what we mean to say...

593
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,759
...and request your permission
to read from a script...

594
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,274
...whatever remarks Murrow
and Friendly may make.

595
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,429
If the Senator feels that we have done
violence to his words or pictures...

596
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,670
...and desires to answer himself...

597
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,593
...an opportunity will be afforded him
on this program.

598
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,468
Our working thesis tonight
is this quotation:

599
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,752
..."If this fight
against Communism..."

600
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,037
"...has made a fight between
America's two great political parties..."

601
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,476
"...the American people know that one
of these parties will be destroyed..."

602
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,870
"...and the Republic cannot endure
very long as a one-party system."

603
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,833
We applaud that statement...

604
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,070
...and we think
Senator McCarthy ought to.

605
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,510
He said it
17 months ago in Milwaukee.

606
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,751
The American people realize
that this cannot be made a fight...

607
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,394
...between America's
two great political parties.

608
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,038
If this fight against Communism...

609
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,192
...is made a fight against America's
two great political parties...

610
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,750
...the American people know that one
of those parties will be destroyed...

611
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,116
...and the Republic can't endure
very long as a one-party system.

612
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,434
On one thing the Senator
has been consistent.

613
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,157
Often operating as a one-man
committee, he has traveled far...

614
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,356
...interviewed many,
terrorized some...

615
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,796
...accused civilian
and military leaders...

616
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,235
...of the past administration
of a great conspiracy...

617
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,231
...to turn over the country
to Communism.

618
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,552
I was extremely shocked when I heard
that Secretary Stevens...

619
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,192
...told 2 Army officers that they had
to take part in the cover up...

620
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,148
...of those who promoted
and coddled Communists.

621
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,158
As I read his statement, I...

622
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,958
...thought of that quotation,
"On what meat..."

623
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,750
"...doth this our Caesar feed?".

624
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,835
The questions is:

625
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,832
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

626
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,388
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

627
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,435
The answer is yes.

628
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,159
Do you think this book
did considerable harm?

629
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,713
Its publication...

630
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,354
...by an expression of the views
contained in it?

631
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,837
The sale of that book
was so abysmally small...

632
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,518
...it was so unsuccessful,
that the question of its influence...

633
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,672
You can go back
to the publisher...

634
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,275
...you'll see it was one of the most
unsuccessful books he ever put out.

635
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,430
He's still sorry about it,
just as I am.

636
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,792
Well, I think that's a compliment
to American intelligence.

637
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,709
I'll say that.

638
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,909
The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates
one of the Senator's techniques.

639
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,194
Twice he said...

640
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,149
..."The American Civil Liberties Union
was listed as a subversive front."

641
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,118
The Attorney General's list does not
and never has listed...

642
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,919
...the ACLU as subversive,
nor does the FBI...

643
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,150
...or any other
federal government agency.

644
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,472
And the American Civil Liberties Union
holds in its files...

645
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,074
...letters of commendation
from President Truman...

646
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,674
...President Eisenhower,
and General MacArthur.

647
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,958
Earlier, the Senator asked, "Upon what
meat does this our Caesar feed?".

648
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,834
Had he looked three lines earlier
in Shakespeare's "Caesar"...

649
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,356
...he would have found this line,
which is not altogether inappropriate.

650
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,558
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

651
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,390
No one familiar with the history
of this country...

652
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,074
...can deny that Congressional
committees are useful.

653
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,913
It is necessary to investigate
before legislating...

654
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,436
...but the line between investigating
and persecuting is a very fine one...

655
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,229
...and the junior Senator from Wisconsin
has stepped over it repeatedly.

656
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,868
We must not confuse dissent
with disloyalty.

657
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,398
We must remember always
that accusation is not proof...

658
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,275
...and that conviction depends
upon evidence and due process of law.

659
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,395
We will not walk in fear,
one of another.

660
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,233
We will not be driven by fear
into an age of unreason...

661
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,880
...if we dig deep
in our history and doctrine...

662
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,231
...and remember that we are not
descended from fearful men...

663
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,790
...not from men who feared to write,
to associate, to speak...

664
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,156
...and to defend the causes
that were for the moment unpopular.

665
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,951
This is no time for men who oppose
Senator McCarthy's methods...

666
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,508
...to keep silent,
or for those who approve.

667
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,634
We can deny our heritage
and our history...

668
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,393
...but we cannot escape
responsibility for the results.

669
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,155
We proclaim ourselves,
indeed as we are...

670
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,028
...the defenders of freedom wherever
it continues to exist in the world...

671
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,476
...but we cannot defend freedom abroad
by deserting it at home.

672
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,310
The actions of the junior Senator
from Wisconsin...

673
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,278
...have caused alarm and dismay
amongst our allies abroad...

674
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,794
...and given considerable comfort
to our enemies.

675
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,198
And whose fault is that?
Not really his.

676
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,870
He didn't create
this situation of fear...

677
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,998
...he merely exploited it,
and rather successfully.

678
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,754
Cassius was right.

679
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,478
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

680
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,431
Good night, and good luck.

681
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,909
And we're out.

682
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,989
Nothing?

683
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,513
Maybe nobody watched.

684
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,675
- We got nothing.
- I don't know. - Nothing.

685
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,628
Should I turn the phones back on,
Mr. Williams?

686
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,355
Yes. Now would be
a good time for that.

687
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,150
Turn the phones on!
Turn the pho...

688
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,438
Mr. Friendly wants the phones on.

689
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,192
It's the Junior Senator
calling collect.

690
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,397
Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris
thanking us for mentioning him.

691
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,358
I don't know whether all of you
have seen what I just saw...

692
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,034
...but I want to associate myself
and this program...

693
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,678
...with what Ed Murrow
has just said...

694
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,399
...and say I have never been
prouder of CBS.

695
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,073
Senator McCarthy said today that he
would demand equal free television...

696
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,434
Stevenson had charged that the Senator
made demagoguery and deceit...

697
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,398
...the national policy...

698
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,030
- Is that Hollenbeck?
- Congratulations!

699
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,109
Great show!

700
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,148
Feel like a Scotch?

701
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,711
I think everybody
could use a Scotch.

702
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,352
- It's 3:30, early editions are out.
- I'm not worried about that.

703
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,032
Of course not.
Shirley, honey...

704
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,953
...would you go across the street
and get the early editions?

705
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,917
- All of them?
- Just get O'Brian!

706
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,271
- Hey, watch my drink!
- Yeah.

707
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,072
Okay. Here we go.

708
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,438
- At last!
- The Times. - The Times...

709
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,549
- First?
- Good.

710
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,952
- Who wrote it?
- Jack Gould.

711
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,754
Gould...

712
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,596
Edward R. Murrow's television program
on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy...

713
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,355
...was an exciting and provocative
examination of the man and his methods.

714
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,830
It was crusading journalism
of high responsibility and courage.

715
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,559
For TV so often plagued
by timidity and hesitation...

716
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,269
...the program was a milestone
that reflected enlightened citizenship.

717
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,594
The program... Hold on!

718
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,353
The program was no less
an indictment of those who wish...

719
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,398
...the problems posed
by the Senator's tactics and theatrics...

720
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,391
...would just go away
and leave them alone.

721
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,313
That was Mr. Murrow's
and television's triumph...

722
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,879
...and a very great one.

723
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,189
Here! Here!

724
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,396
- He hated it.
- Yeah. What's his beef?

725
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,797
Send the New York Times
a bottle of Scotch.

726
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,836
I already did. How do you think
we got that review?

727
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,797
- How's the Post?
- Pretty good!

728
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,391
- What about O'Brian?
- Uh, the same.

729
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,752
- Go on, read O'Brian!
- I don't have it.

730
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,239
- Got it.
- Oh. Here.

731
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,197
- There we go.
- Shirley, that...

732
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,116
We can't say we were surprised at
Murrow's "Hate McCarthy" telecast...

733
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,033
...last evening, when his explosively
one-sided propaganda...

734
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,317
...edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy's march...

735
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,709
...against Communism,
was finished last evening...

736
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,076
...by equally Machiavellian coincidence
the following telecast...

737
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,038
...featured Murrow's PM protg,
Hollenbeck.

738
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,035
In an obviously gloating mood,
Hollenbeck...

739
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,430
...hoped viewers had witnessed
his patron's triumph...

740
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,794
...from and for the Left.

741
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,069
So on. So on...

742
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,196
Shirley, it's okay.
Go ahead, finish it.

743
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,317
- No, that's it. That's it.
- Shirley, please, finish it.

744
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,831
The CBS has been in a lengthy
"clean house of Lefties" mood.

745
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,558
The worst offenders
on lesser levels...

746
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,756
...have been quietly
pushed out of the company.

747
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,628
Don Hollenbeck, a graduate
of the demised pinko publication PM...

748
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,349
...attacked conservative papers
with sly and slanted propaganda.

749
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,670
He then proceeded
through an equally...

750
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,158
...tilted review of the day's events...

751
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,471
...with McCarthy dominating his words,
actions, attitudes.

752
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,355
So on.

753
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,838
- It's O'Brian. - He didn't get
the Scotch, that's all.

754
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,192
- Is it grammatically correct?
- I'll have that cigarette, Ed.

755
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,592
- Thanks, Shirley.
- Oh. - Mmh. - Thank you.

756
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,955
Joe... Shirley...

757
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,908
It doesn't matter.

758
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,029
To Jack Gould!

759
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,873
- To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould!
- To Jack Gould!

760
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,915
I love Jack Gould!

761
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,279
May he rest in peace.

762
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,119
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Fred, congratulations! - Thank you.

763
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,155
I got such a hangover
to go along with the ulcer.

764
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,037
All the ad guys on the 3rd floor
watched the show.

765
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,031
Got a good review
in the New York Times. Jack Gould.

766
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,439
We're putting out a press release...

767
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,273
...saying that calls came in
15 to 1 in favor of the show. - Really?

768
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,635
- Yeah. - 15 to 1?
- We got calls from everywhere.

769
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,117
- East Coast or West Coast?
- Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati...

770
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,149
Mr. Paley...

771
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,270
- Morning, Fred.
- Morning, Mr. Paley.

772
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,155
How's your wife?

773
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,670
She's fine.
We're getting ready to move.

774
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,718
- Really? Where to? - Riverdale.
We found a nice house there.

775
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,755
It's nice there.

776
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,595
Yes, sir.

777
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,315
Excuse me.

778
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,195
Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckley
to do his rebuttal.

779
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,435
I said no.

780
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,149
Yes, sir.

781
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,235
Hey, Johnny!

782
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,630
- Radulovich has been reinstated.
- What?!

783
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,359
Radulovich... Guys!
Radulovich has been reinstated.

784
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,237
- Jesse! Jesse!
- Where is Ed?

785
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,754
- He's in the bullpen. Why?
What's going on? - Jess!

786
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,273
Got some very good news.

787
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,838
Special announcement
from the Secretary of the Air Force!

788
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,876
Fellas! Listen up! Everyone!

789
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,750
I have decided
that it is consistent...

790
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,479
...with the interests
of the National Security to retain...

791
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,711
...Lieutenant Radulovich
in the United States Air Force. Stop.

792
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,077
He is not, in my opinion,
a security risk. Full stop.

793
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,070
There you go. Harold E. Talbott,
Secretary from the Air Force.

794
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,675
Great job!

795
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,591
- Make a copy of that for me!
- I will do, Fred!

796
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,557
Back to work, guys!
We got a lot of work to do.

797
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,834
This means something.

798
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,433
- Good news, huh?
- Congratulations!

799
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,399
- This absolutely means something.
- Absolutely. This is the start of...

800
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,075
Palmer!

801
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,996
The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you.

802
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,429
When?

803
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,069
Tomorrow.

804
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,191
I don't want you to get paranoid,
they're talking to everybody.

805
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,269
Any ideas?

806
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,358
Just tell them what you know.

807
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,034
- Now is that testimony true?
- No, sir, it is not.

808
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,192
Not at any time have I been
a member of the Communist Party...

809
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,510
...and I have never seen
a Communist card.

810
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,830
- You've never seen a Communist card?
- That's right.

811
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,797
Have you ever attended
any Communist meetings?

812
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,438
No, sir, never.

813
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,670
Have you ever subscribed
to The Daily Worker?

814
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,389
No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it
and I wouldn't pay for it.

815
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,154
Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward,
who was working for the FBI...

816
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,037
...who joined the Communist Party
under orders from the FBI...

817
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,197
...has testified that while
she never met you personally...

818
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,472
...at a Communist meeting
that your name was on the list...

819
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,630
...of Communists
who were paying dues.

820
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,759
Uh... Can you shed
any light upon that?

821
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,353
No, sir. I don't even know
what the dues are...

822
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,876
...or where they were paid.
- So you have never paid any money...

823
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,632
...to the Communist Party.

824
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,998
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

825
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,196
You've never paid
any dues, payment...

826
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,872
Thank you very much, Leo!

827
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,512
Good work, Joe, Charlie.

828
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,394
Now what is the show?

829
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,119
Is it defending Annie Lee Moss
as not being a Communist?

830
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,668
- Or is it her Constitutional rights?
- Both. - The latter.

831
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,115
We're much better sticking out
the Constitutional issues.

832
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,838
- Agreed?
- The woman is not a Communist spy.

833
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,434
Joe McCarthy said that they have
a spy in the Pentagon...

834
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,158
...that spy has gotten
into the code room...

835
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,912
...and that that spy
is Annie Lee Moss.

836
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,389
I've got New York Times reports.
McCarthy asserts he has...

837
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,199
...a new red link to Army. Quote,
"Senator McCarthy charged today..."

838
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,714
"...that the Army now employs
a woman in its code room..."

839
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,268
"...who was, and still may be,
an active Communist."

840
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,793
It's the front page
of the New York Times.

841
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,395
No sooner is he done chastising the
other committee members for wanting...

842
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,313
...to push into the afternoon,
than what? Seven questions in...

843
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,958
...he ducks out, leaves...
- Right.

844
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,918
- He leaves. - It's all over
the headlines, all over the country.

845
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,513
Get me copies from any newspaper...

846
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,158
...that printed anything
about that assertion.

847
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,437
That's a good idea. You should get
the Cincinnati Inquirer.

848
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,432
- Chicago. - Couple other pieces
I think we should include.

849
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,512
The fact that there's 3 Annie Lee Moss's
in the phone book.

850
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,512
There are 2 Robert Halls,
one's colored, one's white.

851
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,431
We have some footage
of the empty chair.

852
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,557
I think that says it all.
Just that picture of McCarthy not...

853
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,359
McCarthy leaving the hearing
after 7 questions...

854
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,510
...and then we'll cut
to the shot of the chair.

855
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,160
- We gotta do something about it.
- All right, so...

856
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,949
Excuse me. Mr. Murrow!
McCarthy wants April 6th.

857
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,828
Thank you, Natalie.

858
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,397
Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get
to see it first. We should offer.

859
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,948
- It's a long shot.
- What the hell could McCarthy do?

860
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,429
Is he gonna debate himself?
We just used his words!

861
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,756
Johnny! Johnny! We know
what it's going to be.

862
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,718
He's going to come after me.
There's nothing more he can do.

863
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,189
He's gonna bet that
a Senator trumps a newsman.

864
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,069
He'll lose.

865
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,038
Not if we're playing bridge.

866
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,433
- I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean
to interrupt. - Hey, Don.

867
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,590
- It's getting fun now!
- Ed, you have a minute?

868
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,510
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- All right, boys. Playtime's over.

869
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,199
We have 4 days...

870
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,829
...to do a 28 minute show.
- Yeah. - All right.

871
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,319
All right, go ahead.
Hi, Mary.

872
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,038
Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck.
Mr. Murrow...

873
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,872
- Could you give us a moment?
- Sure.

874
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,715
Thank you, dear.

875
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,994
I have to ask you something, Ed.
It's about O'Brian.

876
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,911
- O'Brian doesn't matter.
- He's killing me, Ed.

877
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,718
He doesn't amount to that much
in the newsroom.

878
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,153
We've got to let that guy have it.

879
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,391
We're not going after O'Brian. I will
not take on McCarthy and Hearst.

880
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,708
I can't defeat them both.

881
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,911
Just don't read the papers.
Or don't read O'Brian, anyway.

882
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,115
Okay. I guess not.

883
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,395
Sorry, Don.

884
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,717
Although Mrs. Moss
offered to testify...

885
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,792
...Senator McCarthy suggested
that she was too sick.

886
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,429
- She agreed... - Mr. Cohn wanted
to know about Mrs. Moss's connection...

887
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,035
...to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth...

888
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,235
...so help you God?

889
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,440
May we get your full name
for the record, please?

890
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,074
Annie Lee Moss.

891
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,752
- M-O-S-S?
- That's right.

892
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,197
Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record,
for your information...

893
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,396
...for the information
of your counsel...

894
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,757
...that you are not here because...

895
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,875
...you are considered important
in the Communist apparatus.

896
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,356
We have the testimony that you are,
and have been, a Communist.

897
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,751
We are rather curious, however,
to know how you suddenly...

898
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,353
...were shifted from...

899
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,112
...a worker in a cafeteria
to the code room.

900
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,551
I am today much more interested...

901
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,829
...in the handling of your case...

902
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,632
...by your superiors
than in your own personal activities.

903
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,993
However, counsel will question you
about your own activities also.

904
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,278
- Mr. Chairman!
- We will not hear from counsel.

905
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,751
You have been told what the rule is.

906
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,952
If you have anything to say,
say it through your client.

907
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,075
Chairman. Did you begin work
at the General Accounting Office in...

908
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,036
...1945?
- Yes, sir.

909
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,953
And, prior to that time,
had you been a cafeteria worker?

910
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,314
Yes, I had.

911
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,752
I see. While in the Pentagon,
since 1950...

912
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,719
...have you had any connections
with coded messages?

913
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,677
Have you ever handled
coded messages?

914
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,154
- No more than to transmit 'em.
- Pardon me?

915
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,556
No more than to transmit
the message.

916
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,915
Than to transmit them?
Did you transmit codes?

917
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,594
To receive or transmit messages
was all I had to do.

918
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,194
And I've never been
into a courtroom in my life.

919
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,948
Do you know the...

920
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,472
...type of classification...

921
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,553
- Do you know if they were secret,
top secret, confidential? - No, sir.

922
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,031
- You wouldn't know the degree
of classification? - No, sir.

923
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,429
I see.

924
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,632
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to excuse myself, I've got...

925
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,639
...a rather important appointment
to work on right now...

926
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,793
...and I wonder if, Senator Mundt,
you would take over as Chairman?

927
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,039
- Chairman. Uh...
- Cohn.

928
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,032
I have no further questions
of this witness at this time.

929
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,079
We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward,
the undercover agent for the FBI...

930
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,750
...stating that Annie Lee Moss
was a member, a dues-paying member...

931
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,512
...of the Communist Party...

932
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,155
...the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

933
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,437
We have corroboration
of that testimony by another...

934
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,550
...witness who was called
before the Committee...

935
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,392
...and gave a sworn statement
to the effect...

936
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,040
...that she also knew Mrs. Moss
as a member...

937
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,076
...of the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

938
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,233
She's already lost her job. She's been
suspended because of this action.

939
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,350
I'm not defending her. If she's
a Communist, I want her exposed.

940
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,195
But to make these statements
as we've got corroborating evidence...

941
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,677
...that she is a Communist,
under these circumstances...

942
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,230
...I think she's entitled to have it
produced here in her presence...

943
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,551
...and let the public know about it
and let her know about it.

944
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,991
I don't like to try people
by hearsay evidence.

945
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,959
I'd like to get the witnesses here
and try them...

946
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,238
...by testimony, under oath.

947
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,956
The Chair will rule
that the comment of Mr. Cohn...

948
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,598
...be stricken from the record.

949
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,274
I didn't ask that, Mr. Chairman!

950
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,874
...whether we should try to produce
a witness in public...

951
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,032
...because the FBI may have
her undercover and we don't want to...

952
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,477
You can't strike these statements
made by counsel here as to evidence...

953
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,599
...that we're having and withholding.
You cannot strike that from the press...

954
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,595
...nor from the public mind
once it's planted there. That's the...

955
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,714
...evil of it!

956
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,072
- Well, I'd look at it...
- I don't think it's fair to a witness...

957
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,559
...to a citizen of this country...

958
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,631
...to bring them up here
and cross-examine them...

959
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,073
...then when they get through, say...

960
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,993
..."The FBI has got something on you
that condemns you."

961
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,674
- The Chair agrees...
- It is not sworn testimony...

962
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,230
...it's convicting people
by rumor and hearsay and innuendo.

963
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,310
You will notice that neither Senator
McClellan or Senator Symington...

964
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,552
...nor this reporter know or claim
that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist.

965
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,339
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

966
01:00:33,374 --> 01:00:35,519
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

967
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,673
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

968
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,798
We labeled it as controversial.

969
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,835
Most of that report consisted
of words and pictures of the Senator.

970
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,879
At that time, we said...

971
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,794
..."If the Senator believes we have done
violence to his words or pictures..."

972
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,348
"...if he desires to speak,
to answer himself..."

973
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,432
"...an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program."

974
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,269
The Senator sought the opportunity
after 3 weeks...

975
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,273
...because he was very busy and wished
adequate time to prepare his reply.

976
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,789
We agreed.

977
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,273
We placed no restrictions on the manner
of the presentation of his reply...

978
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,358
...and we suggested that we would not
take time to comment...

979
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,112
...on this particular program.

980
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,428
Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,
junior Senator from Wisconsin.

981
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:41,875
Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow,
Educational Director of the CBS...

982
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,070
...devoted his program
to an attack...

983
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,232
...on the work of the US Senate
Investigating Committee...

984
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,756
...and on me personally
as its Chairman.

985
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,030
Now, over the past 4 years,
he has made repeated attacks upon me...

986
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,198
...and those fighting Communists.

987
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,632
Of course, neither Joe McCarthy
nor Edward R. Murrow...

988
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,078
...is of any great importance
as individuals.

989
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,553
We are only important...

990
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,759
...in our relation to the great struggle
to preserve our American liberties.

991
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,716
Now ordinarily, I wouldn't take time
out from the important work at hand...

992
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,634
...to answer Murrow.

993
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,599
However, in this case...

994
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,309
...I feel justified in doing so
because Murrow is the symbol...

995
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,075
...the leader...

996
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,275
...and the cleverest of the jackal pack
which is always found at the throat...

997
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,559
...of anyone who dares to expose
individual Communists and traitors.

998
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,557
And I am compelled by the fact...

999
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,349
...to say to you
that Mr. Edward R. Murrow...

1000
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,354
...as far back as 20 years ago...

1001
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,276
...was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes.

1002
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,352
For example, the Institute
of International Education...

1003
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,710
...of which he was
the Acting Director...

1004
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,113
...was chosen to act
as a representative...

1005
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,072
...by a Soviet agency...

1006
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:06,359
...to do a job which would normally
be done by the Russian secret police.

1007
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,755
Mr. Murrow, by his own admission,
was a member of the IWW...

1008
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,274
...that's the Industrial Workers
of the World...

1009
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,033
...a terrorist organization
cited as subversive...

1010
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,989
...by an Attorney General
of the United States.

1011
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,357
Mr. Murrow said on this program
and I quote...

1012
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,669
..."The actions of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin..."

1013
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,839
"...have given considerable comfort
to the enemy."

1014
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:36,194
That is the language of our statute
of treason, rather strong language.

1015
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,040
If I am giving comfort to our enemies,
I ought not to be in the Senate.

1016
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,191
If, on the other hand,
Mr. Murrow...

1017
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,631
...is giving comfort to our enemies...

1018
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,235
...he ought not to be brought
into the homes...

1019
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,876
...of millions of Americans
by the CBS.

1020
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,399
And I want to assure you...

1021
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,358
...that I will not be deterred...

1022
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:04,677
...by the attacks of the Murrows,
the Lattimores, the Fosters...

1023
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,228
...The Daily Worker
or the Communist Party itself.

1024
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,312
And I make no claim to leadership.

1025
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,033
In complete humility...

1026
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,759
...I do ask you and every American
who loves this country...

1027
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,998
...to join with me.

1028
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,911
[Everyone talks about the weather.]

1029
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,439
[Wherever you look
on America's modern farms...]

1030
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,998
[... aluminum is on the job, helping the
farmer do something about the weather.]

1031
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,957
[Aluminum for the farm
is one more example of how Alcoa...]

1032
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,359
[... since 1888...]

1033
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,355
[... has continued to pioneer
new uses for this vital metal.]

1034
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,879
[New uses of aluminum that mean
better farms and better farming.]

1035
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,995
[The aluminum from the nation's
first and leading producer...]

1036
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,870
[... Alcoa,
Aluminum Company of America.]

1037
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,749
Last week, Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program...

1038
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,229
...to correct any errors
he might have thought we made...

1039
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,833
...in our report of March 9th.

1040
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,196
Since he made no reference to any
statements of fact that we made...

1041
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,919
...we must conclude
that he found no errors of fact.

1042
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,189
He proved again
that anyone who exposes him...

1043
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,717
...anyone who doesn't share his disregard
for decency and human dignity...

1044
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,229
...and the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution...

1045
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,914
...must be either a Communist
or a fellow traveler.

1046
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,198
I fully expected this treatment.

1047
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,270
The Senator added this reporter's name
to a long list of individuals...

1048
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,716
...and institutions he has accused
of serving the Communist cause.

1049
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,752
His proposition is very simple:

1050
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,436
...anyone who criticizes or opposes
Senator McCarthy's methods...

1051
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,993
...must be a Communist.

1052
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,275
And if that be true, there are
an awful lot of Communists in the USA.

1053
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,390
For the record, let's consider briefly
some of the Senator's charges.

1054
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,471
He claimed, but offered no proof...

1055
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,757
...that I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World.

1056
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,955
That is false.

1057
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,155
I was never a member of the IWW,
never applied for membership.

1058
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,708
The Senator charged
that Professor Harold Laski...

1059
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,712
...a British scholar and politician,
dedicated a book to me.

1060
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,835
That's true.

1061
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,430
He is dead.
He was a socialist, I am not.

1062
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,078
He was a civilized individual...

1063
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,277
...who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles...

1064
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,079
...as a pre-condition
for conversation or friendship.

1065
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,630
I do not agree
with his political ideas.

1066
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,909
Laski, as he makes clear
in the introduction...

1067
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,310
...dedicated the book to me,
not because of political agreement...

1068
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,075
...but because he held my wartime
broadcast from London in high regard.

1069
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,198
And the dedication so reads.

1070
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,075
I believed 20 years ago
and I believe today...

1071
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,990
...that mature Americans can engage
in conversation and controversy...

1072
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,197
...the clash of ideas, with Communists
anywhere in the world...

1073
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,714
...without becoming
contaminated or converted.

1074
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,948
I believe that our faith,
our conviction...

1075
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,709
...our determination
are stronger than theirs...

1076
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,232
...and that we can successfully compete,
not only in the area of bombs...

1077
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,432
...but in the area of ideas.

1078
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,160
I have worked with CBS
for more than 19 years.

1079
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,115
The company has subscribed fully
to my integrity and responsibility...

1080
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,509
...as a broadcaster
and as a loyal American.

1081
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,630
I require no lectures from the junior
Senator from Wisconsin...

1082
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,234
...as to the dangers
or terrors of Communism.

1083
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,595
Having searched my conscience
and my files...

1084
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,592
...I cannot contend that
I have always been right or wise...

1085
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,672
...but I have attempted to pursue
the truth with diligence...

1086
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,829
...and to report it...

1087
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,878
...even though, as in this case,
I had been warned in advance...

1088
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,350
...that I would be subjected
to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

1089
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,239
We shall hope to deal with matters
of more vital interest next week.

1090
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,632
Good night, and good luck.

1091
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,669
In the last analysis, the Senator was
perched on the television high dive...

1092
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,955
...and all prepared
to make a resounding splash.

1093
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,634
He jumped beautifully,
but he neglected to check first...

1094
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,393
...where he was going to land.
It must have been a shock...

1095
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,836
...to discover that Mr. Murrow
had drained the water out of the pool.

1096
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,148
- Is that the Times? Gould?
- Yeah, it's Jack Gould.

1097
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,231
- He's a hell of a writer.
- Yes, he is.

1098
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,400
- If we can afford him!
- Stanton's got a public opinion...

1099
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,993
Senate's investigating McCarthy.

1100
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,029
What?

1101
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,630
The Army's charging that McCarthy
and Cohn exercised undue pressure...

1102
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,951
...to get preferential treatment
for Schine. - Who's the source?

1103
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,919
- Got a second source? - There isn't,
but this is coming out in 2 hours.

1104
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,197
- Who's heading up the investigation?
- It's not gonna be McCarthy!

1105
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,998
- Really?
- What happened?

1106
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,913
- Also get me the Washington Post!
- What's going on?

1107
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,433
It's Williams
for Jack Thompson.

1108
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,238
The Senate's investigating McCarthy.

1109
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,076
There is an added bit of comedy
to this whole story.

1110
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,071
The Committee cannot convene
for several days...

1111
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,799
...because Senator McCarthy
has a slight case of laryngitis.

1112
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,589
And he must recover
over the desert air of Arizona.

1113
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,150
- But Stevens is going after him
and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah.

1114
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,549
They're gonna allow each side
to call witnesses...

1115
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,392
...and be privy to other testimony.

1116
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,389
- Fred, we still have a meeting!
- We're gonna go to talk to Thompson.

1117
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,273
No, thanks, Jack. Bye.

1118
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,953
Freddy, we're a hit.
Right up there with "Howdy Dowdy"!

1119
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,111
Can I have
an outlet satellite, please?

1120
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:52,228
- 74, 76, 47. Thank you.
- Murrayville 3, 1-2-7-6.

1121
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,432
The fact of newscaster
Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday...

1122
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,308
...does not remove from the record
that peculiar history...

1123
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,835
...of the leftist slanting of news
indulged consistently by the CBS.

1124
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,277
Hollenbeck was what most astute
students of CBS's strange...

1125
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,830
...and questionable new methods
considered...

1126
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:36,278
..."typical of its newscasters".
By Jack O'Brian.

1127
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,596
Oh, yeah. I like it like that.

1128
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,514
One of the best programs I ever heard
was called "CBS Views The Press".

1129
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,555
A great many people liked it,
some didn't...

1130
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,434
...but no one ever called it
anything but honest.

1131
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,469
It was the work of an honest reporter.
Don Hollenbeck.

1132
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,675
He also worked occasionally
on "See It Now".

1133
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,079
He did the 11 p.m. News
over some of these stations.

1134
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,354
He had been sick lately
and he died this morning.

1135
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,388
The police said
it was suicide... gas.

1136
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,268
Not much of an obit.

1137
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,757
But, at least we got our facts
straight, and it was brief.

1138
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,194
And that's all Don Hollenbeck
would have asked.

1139
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,838
Good night, and good luck.

1140
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,276
Got to be in Philadelphia
this morning.

1141
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,753
What time is your train?

1142
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,755
8:00.

1143
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,748
- Charlie going with you?
- Uh-huh.

1144
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,549
Here's a thought.

1145
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,639
What if we're wrong?

1146
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,394
We're not wrong.

1147
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,678
We're not going to look back...

1148
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,676
...and say we protected
the wrong side?

1149
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,120
Protected them from what? In the name
of what? What would we be preserving?

1150
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,476
Argument could be made,
"for the greater good".

1151
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,234
Not once you give it all away.
It's no good then.

1152
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,199
It's just a thought.

1153
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,191
Senator, may we not drop this? We know
he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild.

1154
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,748
And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.

1155
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,635
- I did you, I think, no personal
injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir.

1156
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,234
- I meant to do you
no personal injury. - No.

1157
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,358
And if I did, I beg your pardon.

1158
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:17,993
Let us not assassinate this lad
further, Senator. You've done enough.

1159
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,710
- Let's... let's...
- Have you no sense of decency, sir?

1160
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,835
At long last, have you left
no sense of decency?

1161
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,034
- I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.
- Senator, I think it hurts you, too.

1162
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,516
- I'd like to finish this.
- Have you some private reservation...

1163
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,229
...when you take the oath
that you will tell the whole truth...

1164
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,637
...that lets you be the judge
of what you will testify to?

1165
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,270
The answer is there's no reservation
about telling the whole truth.

1166
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:50,560
Thank you, sir. Then tell us
who delivered the documents to you!

1167
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,552
I don't want to mean that
this new fashion is not chic.

1168
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:57,235
- I think it's just no good for me.
- Uh, not for you.

1169
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,114
Milko, anything you care to say
on that subject?

1170
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,519
I think no comment.

1171
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,231
It's got to be there. If you can't
find it, I can't write about it.

1172
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,629
- Check again.
- Charlie said he dropped it off.

1173
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,757
- Charlie said he dropped...
- Shirley, can I see you a minute?

1174
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,518
- I got to call you back.
- Joe!

1175
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,595
You, too.

1176
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,515
Close the door.

1177
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,675
Have a seat.

1178
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,152
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah.

1179
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,758
Uh, you both are aware
that there's a policy at CBS...

1180
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,876
...that no two employees
can be married.

1181
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,836
I want to ask you a question,
but I don't want you to answer it.

1182
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,592
I want you to consider it.

1183
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,312
I know you two are married.

1184
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,389
Everyone knows.

1185
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,748
That's not my question.

1186
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,078
In the next few weeks
I have to lay off a couple of people.

1187
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,879
We're making some significant cuts
across the board.

1188
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,678
I wanted you to know that...

1189
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,713
...because you could save
someone else being fired.

1190
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,509
I'm asking you to consider
making this decision a little easier.

1191
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,352
I don't need an answer now.

1192
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,796
Just think about it.

1193
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,355
Good.

1194
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,994
- Well, Joe...
- Well?

1195
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,472
- Sure we're gonna miss you
around here. - I'll pack my things.

1196
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,194
- I think it's for the best.
- We'll find out!

1197
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,948
Mrs. Wershba...

1198
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,835
Everybody knew.

1199
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,397
Natalie, did he say
what it was about?

1200
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,233
No. Just that he wanted to talk
to you in his office.

1201
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,389
Uh-oh!

1202
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,990
The problem isn't simply
that you've lost your sponsor.

1203
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,590
With Alcoa, "See It Now"
still loses money.

1204
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,999
The fee is 50,000 dollars.

1205
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,548
Last week's episode we did
for less than 50,000 dollars.

1206
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,471
Fred, you're speaking
beyond your competence.

1207
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,869
We'll certainly find another sponsor.

1208
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,509
"64,000 Dollar Question" brings in
over 80,000 in sponsors...

1209
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,716
...and it costs one-third
of what you do.

1210
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,678
Ed, I've got Tuesday night
programming that's number one.

1211
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,070
People want to enjoy themselves.
They don't want a civics lesson.

1212
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,958
- What do you want, Bill?
- I don't want to get a stomachache...

1213
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,429
...every time you take on
a controversial subject.

1214
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,038
I'm afraid that's the price
you have to be willing to pay.

1215
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,233
Let's walk very carefully
through these next few moments.

1216
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,629
The content of what we're doing
is more important...

1217
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,951
...than what some guy in Cincinnati...
- It's what you're doing, Ed. Not me.

1218
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,109
Not Frank Stanton. You.

1219
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,314
"CBS News", "See It Now"
all belong to you, Bill.

1220
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,469
You wouldn't know it.

1221
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:28,756
- What is it you want? Credit?
- I never censored a single program.

1222
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:33,912
I hold on to affiliates
who wanted entertainment from us.

1223
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,998
I fight to keep the license...

1224
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,311
...with the very same politicians
that you are bringing down...

1225
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:44,235
...and I never,
never said no to you. Never.

1226
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,552
I would argue that we have done
very well by one another.

1227
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,471
I would argue that this network...

1228
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,592
...is defined by what the news
department has accomplished.

1229
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:59,559
And I would also argue that never saying
no is not the same as not censoring.

1230
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,677
Really? You should teach journalism.
You and Mr. Friendly.

1231
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,074
Let me ask you this:

1232
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,438
...why didn't you correct McCarthy...

1233
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,432
...when he said that Alger Hiss
was convicted of treason?

1234
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,155
He was only convicted of perjury.
You corrected everything else.

1235
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,872
Did you not want the appearance
of defending a known Communist?

1236
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,679
I would argue that everyone censors,
including you.

1237
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,158
What do you want to do, Bill?

1238
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,833
I'm taking your program
from a half an hour to an hour.

1239
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,276
And it won't be a weekly program
and it won't be Tuesday nights.

1240
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,155
- When would it be?
- Sunday afternoons.

1241
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,715
- How many episodes?
- 5.

1242
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,191
Why don't you just fire me, Bill?

1243
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,595
I don't think
it's what either of us wants.

1244
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,199
You owe me 5 shows.

1245
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,314
- You won't like the subject matter.
- Probably not.

1246
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,550
Fred, I'll need you for a moment.

1247
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,910
- Thank you, Mary.
- Goodbye, Mr. Friendly.

1248
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,077
- He wants me to lay a few people off.
- I'm sure he does.

1249
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:46,152
Let's do our first show
about the downfall of television.

1250
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,436
- Senate's gonna vote to censure
McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably.

1251
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,592
- And then what happens?
- He sits in the back row. - Right.

1252
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,959
- They keep him in the Senate.
They don't kick him out. - No, he stays.

1253
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,276
Well, we might as well
go down swinging.

1254
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,918
Did you know the most trusted man
in America is Milton Berle?

1255
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,877
See, you should have worn a dress!

1256
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,034
- How does a Scotch sound?
- Scotch sounds good.

1257
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,474
- Did you know Joe and Shirley
were married? - Sure.

1258
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,516
- Did everyone know?
- Pretty much.

1259
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,273
We are proud because
from the beginning of this nation...

1260
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,119
...man can walk upright.

1261
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,870
No matter who he is
or who she is.

1262
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:44,508
He can walk upright
and meet his friend or his enemy.

1263
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,272
And he does not fear
that because that enemy...

1264
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,270
...may be in a position
of great power...

1265
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,796
...that he can be suddenly
thrown in jail...

1266
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,636
...to rot there without charges
and with no recourse to justice.

1267
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,558
We have the Habeas Corpus Act
and we respect it.

1268
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,432
I began by saying that our history
will be what we make it.

1269
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,639
If we go on as we are...

1270
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,356
...then history will take its revenge,
and retribution will not limp...

1271
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,793
...in catching up with us.

1272
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:23,074
Just once in a while, let us exalt the
importance of ideas and information.

1273
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,710
Let us dream to the extent of saying
that on a given Sunday night...

1274
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,950
...the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan...

1275
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,669
...is given over to a clinical survey
on the state of American education.

1276
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,036
And a week or two later, the time
normally used by Steve Allen...

1277
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:41,238
...is devoted to a thorough-going study
of American policy in the Middle East.

1278
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,550
Would the corporate image of their
respective sponsors be damaged?

1279
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,912
Would the shareholders rise up
in their wrath and complain?

1280
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,635
Would anything happen...

1281
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:54,349
...other than a few million people would
have received a little illumination...

1282
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,557
...on subjects that may well determine
the future of this country...

1283
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,029
...and therefore the future
of the corporations?

1284
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,036
To those who say, "People wouldn't
look, they wouldn't be interested..."

1285
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,998
"...they're too complacent,
indifferent and insulated"...

1286
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,909
...I can only reply: There is,
in one reporter's opinion...

1287
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,874
...considerable evidence
against that contention.

1288
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,758
But even if they are right,
what have they got to lose?

1289
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,513
Because if they are right...

1290
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,556
...and this instrument
is good for nothing...

1291
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,074
...but to entertain,
amuse and insulate...

1292
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,557
...then the tube is flickering now...

1293
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,598
...and we will soon see
that the whole struggle is lost.

1294
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,999
This instrument can teach.

1295
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,789
It can illuminate
and it can even inspire.

1296
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,353
But it can do so only to the extent
that humans are determined to use it...

1297
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,793
