1
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:26,176
One two three four!

2
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:17,576
- How about the paralegal?
- Which paralegal?

3
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:21,176
- The one at the beach?
- Herb's son-in-law? No, he's an idiot.

4
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,141
Okay, look.
I'm not ready yet.

5
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,676
How could you not be ready?
You'll be divorced in a month.

6
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,876
All right, shush.

7
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:30,876
Danny, I hear
you're selling trees now.

8
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,241
Yeah.
- For the prom.

9
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,326
He's in charge of the whole thing.

10
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,468
- Oh, yeah?
- Who are you taking?

11
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:38,576
- What?
- You got a cute girlfriend?

12
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:39,841
- Uh...
- A friend.

13
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,776
- Yeah, just...
- A friend you're dating?

14
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,441
No. Well, she's...

15
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:45,241
- been my friend for a long time.
- Not dating?

16
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:48,241
- Not a date?
- leave him alone. He's working on it.

17
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:51,876
'Cause that's a big night.
I lost my virginity that night.

18
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:54,676
Yeah, well,
I've got a couple of options.

19
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:02,976
- Sakalov?
- Too tall for you,

20
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:04,576
like Big Bird tall.

21
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,641
Saperstein?

22
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:09,076
- With the long chin?
- What about Richter?

23
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:11,476
- I'd go with Richter.
- Nah, she's taken.

24
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,841
- Who?
- Bart.

25
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:14,426
- Yeah, right.
- Seriously.

26
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,941
Yeah, she's going with him.

27
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,676
- Like... wait.
- Yeah, she agreed to it.

28
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,341
- With Bart?
- Yup.

29
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:22,341
- Bart Beeber?
- It's probably just a sympathy thing.

30
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,775
- Yeah, but I mean... that's like...
- Dude, just forget it.

31
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,875
What about that sophomore
you drive to school?

32
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,975
Alice? Yeah yeah,
I'm thinking of her.

33
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,240
She's a cheerleader,
so she's limber.

34
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,925
- She's cute, yeah.
- It's a way to save face.

35
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,575
I mean, we talk
every day in the car, so...

36
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,442
You know what
it comes down to...

37
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:41,275
the photo at the end
of the night.

38
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,575
- That's your proof.
- And what do I do about Camille?

39
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,240
What if she asks?

40
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:48,275
Yeah, 'cause, I mean,
we've been friends for... I don't know...

41
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,075
- eight, maybe nine years.
- Dude, what other evening

42
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,242
in your whole life is as big?

43
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:55,375
Maybe your wedding night,

44
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:58,475
but who cares about that? Odds are
you're getting divorced, anyway.

45
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,740
- So what are you saying?
- Are you here

46
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:05,075
burning up
in this humid lizardy bullshit to die?

47
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,275
Or are you here to live?

48
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:16,340
#Be aggressive, B-E aggressive #

49
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,675
# B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-l-V-E
aggressive. #

50
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,275
- Hey.
Whoo!

51
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,175
Umm, are you sure
you don't want to come in?

52
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,975
'Cause, you know,
I could probably get you in.

53
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,975
No, it's fine.
I'll just hang out.

54
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:38,975
Okay, well, you know,
I'll just be...

55
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:41,275
I'll just be
a few more minutes.

56
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,075
Okay.

57
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,775
Yeah.

58
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,525
- Gertie.
- "A Night to Remember,"

59
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,175
except... and here's the catch...

60
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:57,675
with a K for a medieval theme.

61
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:01,575
Yeah.

62
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,075
But with a K.

63
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,575
Kurt, do you got anything?

64
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,175
"Putting on the Ritz."

65
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:16,325
"Putting on the Ritz," yeah.

66
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,575
I like that, 'cause it's simple.

67
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:23,940
What?

68
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,375
Gertie, we didn't...

69
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:28,175
we didn't vote yet.

70
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,075
Uh...

71
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:38,875
What do you think?
"This moment forever."

72
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,675
So do you know
who you're taking yet?

73
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,440
Oh, you know, I'm just...

74
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:59,075
I'm just kind of waiting
to see, you know.

75
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,742
Just not with Camille or...

76
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:04,340
No no. No, I mean, l...

77
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,075
I've got a couple
of options I'm working on.

78
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,875
Well, there's...
there's this one girl l...

79
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:15,075
uh, I don't think you know her.

80
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,740
She's... well,

81
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:21,275
I'm just kind of waiting
for the right time to...

82
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,792
I mean, do you not like Camille?

83
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:28,240
Huh. No. No, she's your platonic.

84
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:31,040
Look, this thing's
about romance, you know?

85
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:34,875
I mean, you dress up,
you wear a flower, you slow dance.

86
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,992
Well yeah, you know,
I guess that's why

87
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm trying to wait
to ask this one girl.

88
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:42,175
Personally, I think
it would be so cool to go.

89
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:44,440
With anyone or just...

90
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:47,175
Well, definitely not
with a hi-bye friend, no.

91
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,675
No. Right. Yeah.

92
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,640
You know,
I was telling Rhoda why

93
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:53,240
so many seniors are losers
and why you're not.

94
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,575
First off, you're definitely
more than a hi-bye friend.

95
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:59,140
And you don't
condescend to me...

96
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:02,340
this naive little sophomore
that you take home.

97
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,275
- Yeah, seniors can be...
- I've been thinking about it

98
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,175
and the way that I see it,

99
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:08,075
you're kind of like
your car, you know?

100
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:12,675
Seriously, your car isn't fancy
but it's not ghetto.

101
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,575
You're not a BMW,
you're not a Mercedes,

102
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,775
but you're not
a Chevy Metro either.

103
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,575
It's just this

104
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:21,275
reliable old Buick.

105
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,940
It doesn't need a lot of pretension.

106
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:27,575
It's not some macho machine
that has to flaunt

107
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:29,075
all its features or something.

108
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:32,240
It's just... there. It's cozy.

109
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,175
Anyway, could you imagine
Friedman driving this thing?

110
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:37,875
Or Buchwald?
Don't you think that's true?

111
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,375
Don't you think your car represents
who you are in every facet?

112
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,875
You know, I feel kind of weird

113
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,040
'cause you were talking
about how I'm like my car

114
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:10,375
- and now like...
- No, Danny, that doesn't apply now.

115
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,740
It's like if you bumped
your arm or something.

116
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:15,475
It doesn't affect your personality
when you bump your arm.

117
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,375
Don't worry about it.

118
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,575
- What? I just want to tell her...
- No no, Dad.

119
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,440
Shh, look, I want to hear this.

120
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:33,175
Okay, so both times I spoke
on the phone to her,

121
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,075
she says she doesn't
date over 40.

122
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,540
I'm 52, so I lied...

123
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:41,175
I said I was 39, but, I mean...

124
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:45,175
That's okay. I mean, yeah,
you look it anyway.

125
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,875
Yeah, okay,

126
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,675
'cause Danny's got that also.

127
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,340
We both have that boyish face.

128
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,475
- Okay.
- Yeah, Danny definitely has that.

129
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,675
Okay, wrap it up.

130
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,475
I don't want to hear about it, no.

131
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,140
Dad...
No, forget it.

132
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:20,275
I finally saw it
with my own eyes.

133
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,774
You would not believe
the signs this girl was giving him.

134
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,874
I've never seen anything like it.
It was uncanny

135
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:28,174
how many signs
she was giving him.

136
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:30,574
Dad, she's a tease.
You don't know.

137
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:33,774
His problem is
he's so insecure, he's blind.

138
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:37,674
Didn't you see the way she put
her arm on your shoulder like this?

139
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,539
All the time like this.
And what's with the lips?

140
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,474
Every time she's looking at him,
she's licking her lips.

141
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:44,274
All right, whatever.
I'll ask her.

142
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:47,374
What a person does with their body
when they're looking at you...

143
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:49,439
like if she's looking at you

144
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:51,674
and she opens up her body to you,

145
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,474
twirls her hair,

146
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,374
moves her tongue or...

147
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:59,139
This girl likes you.

148
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:00,939
I'm telling you.
She kissed you!

149
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,674
She probably just wants
to go as a sophomore.

150
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:05,474
- She's using me.
- Even if she did, who cares?

151
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,791
You're gonna have
a great picture.

152
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:10,074
I don't know what
he's worried about.

153
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,739
He's got so much going for him:

154
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:14,874
He's vice president of his class,
first chair in the trumpet...

155
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,674
...not to mention honor society;

156
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,639
He came in third place

157
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:22,274
at the Optimist Oratorical
Contest last year.

158
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:27,024
Honey, did you want to meet Bob now?

159
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,839
Uh, just...
just give me a second.

160
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:31,774
Well, he's here
and he's anxious to meet you.

161
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:34,574
I heard you're a real scholar.

162
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,239
I told him about your award.

163
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:40,174
I heard you're great on the trumpet.

164
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,774
All right,
just give me a second.

165
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:42,574
I'll get that.

166
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:48,274
- Hey.
- It's not... it's not that big a deal,

167
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,439
just... here.

168
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:53,239
- Whatever.
- What is it?

169
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:55,774
- Hi, Camille.
- Hi, how are you?

170
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:59,074
- Well, who is this?
- Camille, this is Bob.

171
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,974
Any friend
of Danny's is a friend of mine.

172
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:05,974
Sincerely. I mean that.

173
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:11,474
- Well, I've got to run.
- Well, give my love to your family.

174
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,839
Okay.

175
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:17,774
- Hello, this is Beth.
- She's a doll, that Camille.

176
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:19,374
And you're going to continue, right?

177
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:22,474
Yeah, just, uh...

178
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,674
Oh, shit.

179
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:41,274
"Danny, I have
a feeling you and I are thinking

180
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,839
the same thing here,

181
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,274
so I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

182
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,239
If you think back on how much

183
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:50,474
we've shared together
since we were little kids,

184
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,374
it almost seems funny
that we've avoided

185
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,774
the inevitable up until now."

186
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:02,739
"Maybe you have other plans,

187
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:05,374
and if you do,
I'll cut you some slack.

188
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:08,974
The bottom line is,
you're my best friend no matter what

189
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:11,591
and I think
it would be so much fun

190
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,174
if we went together
to the prom."

191
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:20,174
Danny! Hi, honey.

192
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:21,974
How are you?

193
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:23,974
- Oh.
Who is that? Danny?

194
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:25,974
It's Danny, honey.

195
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,174
- Hey, Danny.
- How's it going?

196
00:13:31,374 --> 00:13:33,674
- You eat dinner yet, Danny?
- I think my mom made me

197
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,274
- a tuna sandwich.
- What?

198
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,339
No, come on.
You'll have dinner with us.

199
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:39,574
No, when's the last time
you had a whole family dinner?

200
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:42,539
What? Why is that rude?

201
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:45,339
- You know Mr. Wiener?
- Mr. Wiener?

202
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:48,874
A sweet guy, a little bold. I think
I'm gonna introduce your mother to him.

203
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,874
- Oh yeah?
- Honey, wait.

204
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:54,074
Are you talking about that crook Wiener?
No, he's not good for Beth.

205
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,374
You don't think
Wiener's good for Beth?

206
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:01,239
You finally got
some sun on your cheeks.

207
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,474
You look good. 'Cause you know
you looked a little pale

208
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,674
- the last time you were here.
- How's your father?

209
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:10,624
Ooh, yeah,
how's he doing? Has he settled in yet?

210
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:13,474
Yeah. Well, he just got
that place on the beach.

211
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,774
Mmm,
Rashbaum showed him that property.

212
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:18,274
Oh, right, on Dania Beach.

213
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:20,674
A nice place... simple.

214
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:23,539
So when's he moving in?

215
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:26,074
I think he's moving in in a week.

216
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:28,674
He's a good egg, your father.

217
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:33,324
Hey, Danny, do you want
to see Camille's dress?

218
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:36,539
- No no no, it's bad luck. Forget it.
- Mom.

219
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,574
He's gonna see it later, anyway.
Show him the dress.

220
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,439
Should I show him the dress?
- Mom!

221
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:42,074
What, you don't want me
to show him the dress?

222
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,974
It's a beautiful beautiful dress.

223
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,074
It's beautiful.

224
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:49,574
My parents aren't
talking to each other at all now.

225
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:51,974
It's like now
I'm in the middle of their debates

226
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:54,674
about money or it's just...

227
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:56,974
I don't know.

228
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:03,474
We should try to get
the same dorm next year.

229
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,274
Look, Danny, just...

230
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,274
- What?
- You know what.

231
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:12,174
'Cause you're one
of my best friends, and I don't wanna...

232
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,974
No, I know. I just thought
'cause it's in a few weeks,

233
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,774
and you don't have
a confirmed date yet.

234
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:23,223
- Hey, guys.
- Oh my God.

235
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:26,173
- What?
- You are disgusting!

236
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:29,273
- What? He's like a brother.
- Get out!

237
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:32,273
Ow! Mom, Camille just
threw a marker at me!

238
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,073
Shut up, Brittney!
Just get out!

239
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,773
No, you shut up,
you nerdy bitch.

240
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,573
What's going on?
- She's such a little slut.

241
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,238
She's always trying
to flirt with my friends.

242
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,473
Oh, shut up, you geek. You wish
you could flirt with my friends.

243
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,673
Just whatever, okay? Whatever.

244
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,238
What is the problem?

245
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:50,573
He's taking Alice Stryer, this random
sophomore he takes to school.

246
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:52,138
Random sophomore?

247
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:54,873
I've been building up
this relationship for a while now

248
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:57,438
and I've been waiting
to ask her.

249
00:15:57,473 --> 00:16:00,873
She's, like... I don't know. She's like
the only person I'm thinking about.

250
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:03,838
Seriously. Honestly.

251
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:06,873
I mean, my mind's
totally set on her.

252
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:12,273
But you and Camille are best friends.

253
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:14,238
I mean, that's what
this is all about.

254
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,038
It's the culmination
of your high school memories.

255
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:20,073
I mean, who better to share
that with than your best friend?

256
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:23,473
Mom, I don't care.
He's taking someone else.

257
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,773
I won't go.

258
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:28,073
You're not going?
What do you mean you won't go?

259
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:29,873
What's going on?
She's not going.

260
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:31,038
What?

261
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,938
I don't mind, all right?

262
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,473
I'd mind if he was
taking Brittney.

263
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:38,538
It's silly.

264
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:42,423
You and Camille have known
each other for eight years.

265
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,273
What could this girl
possibly offer that Camille couldn't?

266
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,938
You know,
I thought about it.

267
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:12,573
Yeah, I think it could
be a lot of fun.

268
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:14,238
And, umm...

269
00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:17,373
you know, I know
it's totally last second.

270
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:20,473
If you need help with a dress or
something, I could help you pay for it

271
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:24,573
because I already got
the tickets and the...

272
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,473
Danny, umm...

273
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:31,273
did you think that
we were romantically...

274
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:34,573
Well, no no. I don't know.

275
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:37,373
Some signs, maybe, yeah.

276
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:39,338
Signs?

277
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,473
What signs?

278
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,273
Well, I guess now, here,

279
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,573
with the ice cream.

280
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:49,738
Wait, the ice cream?

281
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:52,273
You weren't
just looking at me,

282
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:54,223
licking the ice cream and like...

283
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:56,073
Yeah, Danny,
I was looking at you

284
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,323
and I was licking
my ice cream.

285
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:00,473
This is how
I eat my ice cream.

286
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:02,173
I mean, how do you eat
your ice cream?

287
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:06,538
Uh, last week
you kissed me.

288
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:09,173
- I mean, you know...
- Yeah, you're a big brother to me.

289
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:11,673
You take me to school.
You're my carpool.

290
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:15,673
Well, l... well,
you said you wanted to go.

291
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,673
- I thought you were...
- Yeah, but...

292
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,838
- not...
- I don't understand.

293
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:25,373
- You can't go with a friend.
- That's just so weird.

294
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,638
This is, like,
the total "Twilight Zone."

295
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,973
Danny, I just can't believe that
you thought that.

296
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:34,038
Huh.

297
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:37,473
That is just so deranged.

298
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:01,073
How was she licking?
'Cause if she was

299
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,873
showing her tongue
but not looking at you...

300
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:04,973
No, Dad, she was
looking at me.

301
00:19:06,473 --> 00:19:08,338
She doesn't have
that wandering eye thing?

302
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:11,773
- 'Cause that can be tricky.
- Dad, she doesn't have that.

303
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:14,173
Well, what about the feet?

304
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:18,473
No, just hear me out, 'cause
the feet can cancel all other signs.

305
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:20,973
If her toes are pointed
toward the door,

306
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,838
that cancels all other signs.

307
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:24,938
Dad, I wasn't watching
her toes, all right?

308
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:27,773
Look, she could've been
doing that in the car ride,

309
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:30,338
'cause I couldn't see her feet.

310
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:33,373
Also, she buckled
her seat belt at one point,

311
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:36,673
so that could've been
a guarded gesture.

312
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,473
Thank you.

313
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:45,273
Whoops, I think he has to
go to the bathroom here.

314
00:19:46,273 --> 00:19:49,173
Sure, of course.

315
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:56,238
All right,
just a quick side note here:

316
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:59,438
- What do you think?
- Dad, I don't know, all right?

317
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:03,073
I'm not gonna lie to you. This baby
thing is a major pain in the ass,

318
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:05,538
but attractive, intelligent,

319
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:09,473
fun and she's got
a nice behind on her.

320
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:12,373
I mean what do you think?
You're an ass man.

321
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:14,238
- Dad.
- What?

322
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:16,538
- It's weird.
- What? What's weird?

323
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,473
It's weird advising my dad
on his girlfriend's ass.

324
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:24,373
It's not natural.
I've got my own crisis here.

325
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:27,338
Danny...

326
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,538
it's the times, okay?

327
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:32,573
Everybody's
going through this.

328
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:36,073
I mean most kids are
advising their parents these days.

329
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:48,023
I pledge allegiance to the flag

330
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:50,438
of the United States of America,

331
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:52,873
and to the Republic
for which it stands,

332
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:54,773
one nation under God,

333
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:57,573
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.

334
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,073
Will everyone
please be seated?

335
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:05,923
"Want to remember
your prom night forever?

336
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,515
You can, by capturing
that perfect moment

337
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,073
with a prom photo.
Preorder your photos

00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:13,173
from the hours
of 12:00 and 1:00."

339
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,573
"Congratulations are
in order to Dawn Dwiggins

340
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,538
for being crowned
this year's prom queen.

341
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:22,672
Varsity cheerleader
Dawn exemplifies true school spirit

342
00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:25,572
and gives her time generously
to help with the Key Club

343
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:28,072
and the Geriatric Society."

344
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:33,237
Kaplan.

345
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:35,872
- Klebener.
Who do we know at Nova?

346
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:38,472
Klinger.
Has to be someone at Nova.

347
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,372
- Who?
- I'm thinking.

348
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:44,172
- Koch. Kushner.
- Wait a minute. I've got it.

349
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:46,472
Danny, you so owe me.

350
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:49,972
There's no one cute
at No... dude.

351
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:52,372
Am I right? You remember
that boyfriend of hers?

352
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:55,872
Was he anything?
Hey, Marcy, what's up?

353
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:58,189
You did? No.

354
00:21:58,224 --> 00:22:00,437
You horndog.

355
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:02,072
We have to click,
though, right?

356
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:03,837
No. He didn't.

357
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:05,972
Well, anyway,
we've got a new guy for you.

358
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,337
Yeah, Craig's friend.

359
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:08,937
He just broke it off
with his girlfriend

360
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:11,372
and he just wants someone
to go to the prom with,

361
00:22:11,472 --> 00:22:13,172
you know,
someone who can totally party.

362
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,672
Yeah, he's... blue eyes, tall.

363
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:20,672
Yeah, he's cute... like quirky cute.

364
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:24,372
Yeah. Yeah?

365
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:27,572
All right. So you'll just go
in the limo with us

366
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:30,672
and we'll totally pre-party.
Yeah, totally.

367
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:33,872
Yeah, I've been tanning
for three weeks now.

368
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:35,537
Find out what time...

369
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:38,337
Okay, yeah, he'll take you
to dinner. Yeah.

370
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:41,237
Just call me afterwards
if you want to back out,

371
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:44,422
- so there's no pressure.
- See, there's the fine print.

372
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:47,572
Okay, 7:00 at Padrino's.
I'll tell him to make reservations.

373
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:50,372
Yeah, 7:00 sharp.
Call me afterwards, all right?

374
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:52,272
All right. Bye.

375
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:53,672
Score.

376
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,137
You're going
with Marcy Pine, dude.

377
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:58,672
- Wait, she still has to see me.
Just look nice...

378
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:00,572
wear one of Craig's vests
or something... and just be yourself.

379
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:02,637
Yeah, just be yourself.

380
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,772
Yeah, and whatever you do,
don't be late.

381
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,272
You wait, right?

382
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:40,537
Honey, I don't like that table.

383
00:23:40,572 --> 00:23:43,572
Go find us a nice one...
not too cold.

384
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,072
- Of course.
- Oh, you're kidding.

385
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:50,872
Danny? Was I not
just asking about him?

386
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,637
- Just about.
- Hi, honey.

387
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:56,772
Hey, how are you?
Who are you here with?

388
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:59,272
You know, I'm just
waiting for a friend.

389
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,337
- Oh.
- Oh, someone we know?

390
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:04,472
Uh, no, he's just kind of
like an old friend.

391
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:06,772
Oh, gee,
look who's here... Wilentz.

392
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:09,672
Oh, you're kidding. Who's he with?

393
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:11,537
Hold on. I'll be right there.

394
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,172
- Camille's supposed to meet us here...
- Camille?

395
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:16,737
- and I just want to talk
to you before she comes.

396
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:19,572
- I should probably check outside.
- I just want you to know

397
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:22,372
that you don't have
to worry about any sort of ego thing

398
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,472
if you ask her now.
She'll still go with you.

399
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:28,237
Her sister was even
asked to this thing,

400
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:31,572
and the whole thing is
so humiliating for her.

401
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:33,172
I'm just...
let me just go see

402
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,872
if my friend's here.
I'll be right back.

403
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:39,472
Marcy?

404
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:42,637
- Oh shit.
Danny.

405
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:44,572
Camille, how's it going?

406
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:47,772
This is so weird.
Are you eating here?

407
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,072
Yeah, I was just talking
to your mother inside.

408
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:52,672
- I think she's waiting for you.
- Who are you here with?

409
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,837
I'm meeting a friend.

410
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:58,072
- Do I know him?
- Uh, no.

411
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:01,172
No, he's just kind of
like an old camp friend, you know?

412
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,072
Oh yeah, like a camp counselor
or something?

413
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,372
Yeah, some dude.

414
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:17,972
- Was your mom expecting you now?
She can wait.

415
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,972
Yeah, she can, but...

416
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:40,672
What did you put for
where hydroxide ion is highest at?

417
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,672
Uh, I think I skipped that one.

418
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:44,972
Why did you skip that one?
You had like a 50/50 chance.

419
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:47,537
Uh, well, I don't know.

420
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:50,072
'Cause I put
"at a high pH number."

421
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:55,672
Uh, excuse me.
Do you guys have the time?

422
00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:59,072
Um, yes, it's 10 after 7:00.

423
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:01,172
Son of a bitch.

424
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:03,672
Yikes.

425
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:12,672
What do you mean she won't?

426
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,472
I was there. l...

427
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,272
Disrespectful? I was just
gonna be a few more minutes.

428
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,572
All right.

429
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:24,972
Okay, fine.

430
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:31,072
I got a room.
Maynard got one.

431
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:34,272
- Sternberg.
- Lipschitz?

432
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:36,289
Lipschitz, yeah.
Buchwald.

433
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:38,198
- Buchwald?
- Buchwald.

434
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,072
- Bart and...
- No. Wait.

435
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:41,972
- What?
- Bart?

436
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:43,737
- Yeah.
- Bart?!

437
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:45,572
- Why?
- Bart got a room?

438
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:47,837
Dude, get a room.
What's your problem?

439
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,472
When you find your date,
you're gonna want one

440
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:52,372
- at least as a place to crash.
- To crash, yeah.

441
00:26:52,472 --> 00:26:55,472
Believe me, you'll want a room.
The whole world's getting rooms.

442
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:58,172
Honey, do you want to skip
a day from your tanning

443
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:00,072
and go to the zoo
with Harry and me?

444
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:03,222
- You hate the zoo.
- I like it now.

445
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:06,272
I can't.
The thing's in three weeks.

446
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:09,237
All right.
Just checking.

447
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:11,337
My mom's getting
like that too.

448
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:13,672
Yeah, it takes about
a year to adjust...

449
00:27:13,707 --> 00:27:16,572
you know, basic family transition.

450
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:19,771
Babe, I'm thinking the limo
should go to Stein's first.

451
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,871
- How much is that gonna be now?
- How much for the limo?

452
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:24,636
- Apiece.
- $400, right?

453
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:27,271
- Apiece?!
- $400 for the six of us.

454
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:29,836
- Six of us?
- Well, if we can't get it,

455
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:32,271
we won't do it. I mean,
there's always getting drunk.

456
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:35,171
'Cause I mean
that's $135, right?

457
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:37,236
Well, do you want me to get it?

458
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:39,871
Because I can try to get it
and if we can't get it, we won't do it.

459
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:42,071
- That's... I mean, dude...
- Yeah, Stein and his date's

460
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:45,171
gonna drink with us too. Yes.

461
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:48,771
Hon, hon, hon,
I'm telling you...

462
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:51,371
drinking is still good.

463
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:53,771
Your father should be doing this.

464
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:56,071
He's doing the tickets and the tux.

465
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:58,071
Well, I'm sorry,
but a room here and a limo

466
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,371
is a lot more than
a cheap tux and two tickets.

467
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,471
Well, who says
I'm getting a cheap tux?

468
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:04,771
Believe me, with your father
you're getting the cheapest.

469
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:08,371
- Well, then can you talk to him?
- I'm not talking to him.

470
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:10,936
Mom, can't you guys
just work it out?

471
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:14,371
No, 'cause I'm gonna be
out $330 for this thing

472
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:16,736
and he's out... what?...$200.

473
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:19,671
You need to tell your father
he needs to take on the limo too.

474
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,571
- Seriously, because I can't...
- Mom, please.

475
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:24,371
He doesn't have it.

476
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,536
Truth is, you shouldn't be
getting a hotel room.

477
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:31,971
- I never got a room.
- Mom, wouldn't you rather know

478
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:34,371
that I'm safe here rather
than out on the road afterward,

479
00:28:34,406 --> 00:28:36,236
driving around exhausted?

480
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:37,971
I thought that's
why you have a limo.

481
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,936
Well, yeah, but it's not like
we're out on the street...

482
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:43,071
look, Mom, everyone is getting
a room here at the Embassy Suites,

483
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:45,236
all right?
Sherman, Wilentz...

484
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:48,571
- it's not a big deal.
- It is when your father doesn't help.

485
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:51,836
Mom...

486
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:53,836
Bart got a room.

487
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:56,571
- Bart got a room?
- Hi, can I help you?

488
00:28:56,606 --> 00:28:58,271
We need a room...

489
00:28:58,371 --> 00:29:00,571
- For the 15th.
...for the 15th, please.

490
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:02,971
- Single? Double?
- Single. Single?

491
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:07,071
Anyway, Bob's coming
over tomorrow.

492
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:08,921
He's taking us out
for a nice Italian,

493
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,671
and then we're taking
a walk on the beach.

494
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:12,736
The beach? With Bob?

495
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:14,736
Honey, do you want
your mom to have

496
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:16,971
some financial stability
in her life or not?

497
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:29,471
All right, I'm going to be reading
some of your journal entries

498
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:33,171
and I'm not going to tell you
who wrote them until the end, okay?

499
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:37,671
"Lost in the ocean,
the waves carry me free,

500
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:40,271
the sea kelp caressing
my sensitive bosom.

501
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:45,671
Take my fragile floating nakedness
to the warmest blues.

502
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:47,971
Make me blush
with your splashes,

503
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:49,571
your crashes

504
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:51,636
your flume, spume,

505
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:53,471
your white bubbly breath,

506
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:55,336
your sensitive touches.

507
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:59,071
Fill my every essence
and I shall shiver with ecstasy,

508
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:02,571
splashing forever
upon your delicate face."

Debbie Yang.

510
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,071
#Hallelujah! #

511
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:12,171
Here's another one.

512
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:16,271
"This great big silence,
like an empty void,

513
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:18,771
like as if nothing ever mattered,

514
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:20,771
like as if nobody ever cared.

515
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:23,671
Where could it go,
the respect of two people

516
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:27,021
who laughed all the time,
who were forever a team?

517
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:30,313
So unappreciated
is the serenity before the fall,

518
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:33,571
before the fierce winds
of doubt come to call.

519
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:35,836
Often I feel alone,

520
00:30:35,871 --> 00:30:38,771
split in two,
yearning for my family

521
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:42,671
when my life is so new."

#Hallelujah... #

523
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:04,236
I don't understand.
After class she asked you to dinner

524
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:08,571
- from a journal entry?
- Well, no, I asked her to study first.

525
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:11,071
And then she asked you
to dinner?

526
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,936
With her whole family,
so I mean...

527
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:16,571
I think she felt bad for me
or something. I don't really know.

528
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:19,671
- Amazing. You need my car?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

529
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:21,371
And if you want
to take her back here...

530
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:24,136
No, she invited me to her place.

531
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:26,571
'Cause, you know, I want you
to feel like this is your place.

532
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:28,336
Yeah, no, that's all right.

533
00:31:28,371 --> 00:31:30,736
In fact, I'm getting you
an extra set of keys

534
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:33,871
in case you ever want
to take a girl back here for whatever.

535
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:36,438
That's why I got
a whole separate room.

536
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:38,971
Well, the walls are
kind of thin though.

537
00:31:39,006 --> 00:31:40,871
- Thin?
- Well, I mean,

538
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:43,471
you could probably hear
everything in the other room.

539
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:46,536
No no no,
these are good walls.

540
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,171
Well, you know,
if you had a woman too,

541
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:51,371
- it could just be kind of weird.
- Well, if she were screaming,

542
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:53,238
but I think it would be
pretty quiet.

543
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:55,071
Or I could just take off,
I could leave.

544
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:56,736
No, you shouldn't
have to leave.

545
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:58,536
Well, go in the other room
and let's see,

546
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:01,071
- 'cause I want you to come by a lot.
- In the other room?

547
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:03,571
Yeah, close the door, make sounds
like you're with someone

548
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,671
and I'll sort of...

549
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:11,771
All right?

550
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:14,271
Well?
- You did it?

551
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:18,271
- Yeah.
- All right. No, I was talking.

552
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,871
Do it again.

553
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:23,571
Ah.

554
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:27,171
This time do it at different levels.

555
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:29,836
Ah.

556
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:32,471
Like start soft

557
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,136
and then get...

558
00:32:34,171 --> 00:32:36,671
start soft
and then go up.

559
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:38,921
Well, I did it twice already.

560
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,071
- At different levels?
- Yeah.

561
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:43,236
All right, look.
I'm gonna call out

562
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:46,371
one to 10 and I'll get
louder each time.

563
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:47,971
My one will sound like this...

564
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:51,036
- ah. All right?
- Yeah.

565
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,771
You tell me
what number you hear me at.

566
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,121
All right, just make sure
your numbers are even,

567
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:57,371
- so it's like a control.
- How do you mean?

568
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:59,171
Announcer the number
at an even volume.

569
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,171
Oh, good.

570
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:05,071
All right.

571
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:06,971
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

572
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:08,536
All right, don't respond now.

573
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:11,271
Just hold out until
I've completely finished.

574
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:14,671
One.
Ooh.

575
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:16,771
Two.

576
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,836
Oh.

577
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:22,470
Three. Ooh.

578
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,870
Four. Oh yeah.

579
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,335
Five.
Oh, that's it. That's it.

580
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,170
Six. Oh my God.
Oh my God, don't stop.

581
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,770
Seven. Oh. Oh my... oh.

582
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,435
Oh my. Eight.

583
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,770
Don't stop. Don't stop.

584
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:46,035
Don't stop. Nine.

585
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:50,170
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

586
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,270
10. Give it to me!
Give it to me!

587
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,670
Give it to me!

588
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,035
Well, I showed
the house three times last week.

589
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,770
I know things are a little...
they're a little slow,

590
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,270
but I'm sure after the open house
we're gonna have some buyers.

591
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:26,070
- Hi, it's so good to see you.
- I know.

592
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,235
You just tell that adorable Maxipoo

593
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,870
- I send my love.
- Your mom's over here.

594
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,870
Okay? All right.
Bye, darling.

595
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,370
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

596
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,870
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

597
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,235
Why? What do you mean?
It's Sunday...

598
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,970
- Japanese or Italian.
- I can't. I'm having dinner

599
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,870
and studying for a trig test
with a classmate, okay?

600
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:47,070
Hi, Lola. Which property?

601
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,235
Did you see these?

602
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,170
This is the third time this week

603
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:53,070
he's sent me e-roses.

604
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,970
I will see you at 3:00, okay?

605
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,235
All right, bye.

606
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,570
Mom, I've got to run, okay?

607
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,470
We'll just take
Dad's Wednesday next week.

608
00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:02,270
Are you asking
this study partner to the prom?

609
00:35:02,305 --> 00:35:04,270
- Shh.
- Oh, I guessed it.

610
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,270
Don't worry, I won't jinx it.
Who is she?

611
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,470
- You don't know her.
- Do I know her family?

612
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,070
I'm pretty sure no.

613
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,070
Eat.

614
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,270
Eat.

615
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,770
So, um...

616
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,770
I'm not really good
with these kinds of things.

617
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,670
I, uh...

618
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,970
You need a date for the prom.

619
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:33,235
How did... yeah.

620
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,770
Yeah, I'll go with you.

621
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:38,235
You will? Are you serious?

622
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,870
- Really?
- I had a feeling you were gonna ask.

623
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:43,470
- I think we'd have a good time.
- Totally.

624
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,770
Totally. Yeah yeah.

625
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,735
I do have to keep it
a secret though,

626
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,270
since my parents would
never want me to go.

627
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,335
No, I totally understand, yeah.

628
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,070
We could sneak
you out or something.

629
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:59,735
And this really isn't a big deal,

630
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,470
but I do have
this long-distance relationship,

631
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,135
so we couldn't get intimate

632
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,770
on the dance floor or anything...

633
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:07,635
No, right, yeah, of course.

634
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,370
...'cause that could
always get back to him.

635
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,370
In case people might see
that and tell him, yeah,

636
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,535
on the dance floor.

637
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,370
And I wouldn't want
to take any pictures

638
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,370
'cause they could always
get in the wrong hands.

639
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,870
I mean if he saw that...

640
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,070
Yeah, right. That's...

641
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,120
well, even if you held

642
00:37:29,155 --> 00:37:31,135
the negatives and...

643
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,935
And actually, in general,

644
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,335
I wouldn't want to be seen
walking in together.

645
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,270
In fact, I'd rather not
be seen walking around at all,

646
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,470
just in case.

647
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:44,535
So, like...

648
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,170
But, I mean, we could
always meet up afterwards

649
00:37:48,205 --> 00:37:49,970
at some post-party
in someone's room...

650
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,770
'cause I think Bart got a room.

651
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,135
"Danny, you're my best friend

652
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,170
and I just think
it would be so much fun

653
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:22,070
if we went together
to the prom."

654
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,770
"Guess what's around the corner.

655
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,635
Prom.

656
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,870
The senior class is
looking for suggestions

657
00:38:32,905 --> 00:38:34,335
for original party favors.

658
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,570
Past favors included
candy baskets and pens.

659
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,870
Come to room 403
to cast your vote."

660
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,970
"There's romance in the air.
Can you feel it?

661
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:46,835
Don't wait till the night of prom

662
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,970
to give your special someone
a special treat.

663
00:38:49,005 --> 00:38:50,770
Show her how much
you really care

664
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,670
with a Spring-gram."

665
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,170
The way I see it, I think
this Camille can be your decoy

666
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,370
to get other women.
What do you think about that?

667
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,570
Mom, I just saw
a lizard in the house.

668
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,670
It's fine.
They eat ants. It's fine.

669
00:39:04,705 --> 00:39:06,635
Look. See, look here.

670
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,170
Scott Cecil...
he was nothing special.

671
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:13,635
Wow, you look different...
your face.

672
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,470
Okay. Anyway, Camille is
your best friend, so...

673
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,970
Hey hey hey,

674
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,070
I don't want to forget
the gift I got Danny.

675
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,934
- Hold on.
- Why did he get me a gift?

676
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,969
I don't know.
I think he's thinking about...

677
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:28,869
- Proposing?
- Shh. Please, don't...

678
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,669
- Here.
- Thank you.

679
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:36,669
- What is it?
- Go ahead and open it.

680
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,569
I figured you needed one, so...

681
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,719
Oh, isn't that thoughtful?

682
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,734
Yeah, well, thank you.

683
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:45,369
I figured it would
save you some money.

684
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,869
It'll save his father some money.

685
00:39:47,904 --> 00:39:50,269
Okay, well, let's get going.

686
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:52,069
Bye, Danny.

687
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:55,269
Yeah, have a good time.

688
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:55,569
Hey, kid.

689
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:59,269
I didn't know
if you had company or not.

690
00:41:59,304 --> 00:42:02,469
No. No no no no.
What's up?

691
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:06,469
What if we're supposed
to be happy with the middle ground?

692
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:08,569
Just what if...

693
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,334
now hear me out on this...

694
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:12,369
what if we're supposed
to find peace

695
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,334
and a little boredom,
you know?

696
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:16,569
Maybe that's better than always
having to search for something else.

697
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:19,169
I mean, really,

698
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:21,919
what's wrong
with a little boredom?

699
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:24,569
Would you like
some Cherry Garcia?

700
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:30,469
I've got that,
I've got Chubby Hubby.

701
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:32,369
Dad, are you listening?

702
00:42:32,404 --> 00:42:34,869
'Cause, like...

703
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,469
what if you and mom
just stuck it out,

704
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:39,934
even if it was boring
after a while?

705
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:41,969
You guys would still be together,
don't you think?

706
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:43,269
I'm giving you Chubby Hubby.

707
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:44,834
It's got pretzels, all right?

708
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:47,969
Yeah, but seriously,
what's the deal?

709
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:51,569
It's complex. There was
nothing keeping us together.

710
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:56,069
Look, every kid wishes
their parents get back together,

711
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:58,269
but it's not realistic.
We've moved on.

712
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:04,169
Anyway, I've decided
I'm gonna ask Camille.

713
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:07,569
I figure we can always just hang out
and play Boggle in the room after.

714
00:43:07,604 --> 00:43:09,469
Boggle's good.

715
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:11,634
At least you get to go.
I never went.

716
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:15,269
She's my best friend.
I know at the very least we'll have fun.

717
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,469
Look, having a date is good.

718
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:23,869
Anyway, we don't have to
pay for a bowtie now, so...

719
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,934
How's that?

720
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:29,469
No, well, Bob got me one.

721
00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:31,734
What?

722
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:34,569
This Bob guy
got you a bowtie?

723
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:37,069
I'm getting you a bowtie,
thank you very much.

724
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:38,834
Yeah, well, he got me one,

725
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,834
so now we don't have to
get a cheap one.

726
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,769
No no no, I'm getting you
a very nice bowtie.

727
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:46,869
What, this Bob guy is
your father all of a sudden?

728
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:50,969
Well, Mom thinks
he might propose.

729
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:58,069
So I've got this new woman
I'm excited about.

730
00:43:58,104 --> 00:44:00,469
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, we're compatible.

731
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:02,269
She's not at all materialistic.

732
00:44:02,304 --> 00:44:04,769
She's into camping.

733
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:07,669
- That's cool. Any kids?
- Two kids, both married.

734
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:13,034
Yeah, so...

735
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:16,034
I haven't actually seen her yet,

736
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:19,469
but she described herself
to me, so, you know.

737
00:44:19,504 --> 00:44:22,286
- Does she sound nice?
- Yeah.

738
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:25,069
I haven't actually heard her yet.

739
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:26,669
This was on the internet.

740
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:29,569
- Chat room?
- Mm-hmm.

741
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:31,869
- Fast typer?
- Yeah, pretty fast.

742
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,569
- Well, that's cool.
- Yeah.

743
00:44:34,669 --> 00:44:36,634
I'll see her
in a couple of nights.

744
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:38,969
You know, she may
turn out to be hideous,

745
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:41,169
but at this point...
you know.

746
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:45,569
- All right, here we go.
- Good, try it on.

747
00:44:45,669 --> 00:44:47,869
Come with me.

748
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:52,669
Thanks for trying it on for us.

749
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:54,334
Hon, we've gotta get going.

750
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,234
We've got that court
reserved at noon.

751
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:58,769
What time is the limo coming?
- 7:00. Mrs. Goodson said

752
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:01,269
she's gonna keep Camille
at the house until I get there.

753
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:03,069
It's gonna be a big surprise.

754
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:05,669
I figure it'll at least keep
some sort of special...

755
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,669
I can't wait anymore. I'm coming in.

756
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:15,169
Oh. Oh, yeah
yeah yeah yeah.

757
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:19,069
- Oh, you look really sharp.
- You look so handsome.

758
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:20,786
Whoa. Camille's gonna
be so impressed.

759
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,433
Honey, why don't you
go start the car

760
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:24,368
- and I'll be out in one second?
- Hey, listen.

761
00:45:24,403 --> 00:45:27,333
You have a good time.

762
00:45:27,368 --> 00:45:29,468
Enjoy it.
You deserve it.

763
00:45:29,503 --> 00:45:31,668
- Okay.
- Thank you.

764
00:45:33,168 --> 00:45:35,168
I think he's gonna
propose tonight.

765
00:45:35,268 --> 00:45:36,968
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

766
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,868
- Are you gonna say yes?
- Look, he's financially secure,

767
00:45:39,968 --> 00:45:42,268
he's got a big heart
and I'm 43.

768
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:44,268
- 45.
- 44.

769
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:46,868
And you hang it up
so it doesn't wrinkle,

770
00:45:46,903 --> 00:45:48,585
your corsage is in the fridge.

771
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,268
When are you picking up Camille?

772
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:52,133
- 7:15.
- Oh, gosh.

773
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:54,968
Have an amazing time. She's your
best friend. You're gonna have fun.

774
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:57,368
Okay, have fun.

775
00:46:18,868 --> 00:46:21,233
- Craig.
- What's up, dude?

776
00:46:21,268 --> 00:46:22,968
I was calling.
Your phone's off.

777
00:46:23,068 --> 00:46:25,933
- Yeah, I know.
- Anyway,

778
00:46:25,968 --> 00:46:28,133
I've decided I'm just
gonna accept my fate.

779
00:46:28,168 --> 00:46:31,068
Camille and I, we're gonna
have a good time. We will.

780
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:34,068
We'll get drunk, make fun of people...
good, clean fun.

781
00:46:34,103 --> 00:46:36,585
Anyway, I'm thinking
that when the limo comes,

782
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,068
I can swing by hers first
and surprise her.

783
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:43,368
We'll just come by and pick you
and Abby up at 7:30, all right?

784
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:46,668
Well, you can't do that now.

785
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:49,168
- What do you mean?
- Well, you can't go with her now.

786
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:51,068
I'm going with her now.

787
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:53,068
Yeah, right.
You're going with Abby.

788
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,968
No, Abby can't go,
so I asked Camille.

789
00:46:55,068 --> 00:46:57,118
What do you mean
she can't go?

790
00:46:57,153 --> 00:46:59,133
She got these
bad sun blisters.

791
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:01,468
- Sun blisters?
- Yeah, it hurts her to move.

792
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,368
So wait, I don't... you what?

793
00:47:04,468 --> 00:47:06,968
- Sorry, I didn't realize...
- Are you serious?

794
00:47:07,068 --> 00:47:10,268
- You asked Camille?
- You weren't gonna go with her.

795
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:14,668
And besides,
I happen to think she's attractive,

796
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:16,268
you know,
in a quirky sort of way.

797
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:23,268
I'm sorry, dude,
I didn't think you were gonna ask her.

798
00:47:23,368 --> 00:47:25,568
Well, what about that
nonrefundable deposit

799
00:47:25,603 --> 00:47:26,868
my mom put down
on the limo?

800
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:29,768
Well, we didn't talk
about that for a while,

801
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:31,768
so I just assumed
you'd canceled it.

802
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:35,868
I'm sorry.

803
00:47:36,968 --> 00:47:38,468
Listen, dude,
I've gotta get ready.

804
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:40,368
This is a big night for me.

805
00:47:41,968 --> 00:47:45,068
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.

806
00:48:35,968 --> 00:48:38,218
- Did you get it?
- Huh?

807
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:40,468
One two three.
- Camille?

808
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:45,368
Can I talk to you for a second?

809
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:47,568
Sorry, Danny, I didn't know.

810
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:58,633
So you're going
with Craig now?

811
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:01,668
Yeah, he's gonna be by
in half an hour.

812
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:04,868
We're going as friends.

813
00:49:04,968 --> 00:49:06,768
That's great.

814
00:49:08,268 --> 00:49:09,968
It's pretty much set, huh?

815
00:49:12,068 --> 00:49:15,768
- I'm sorry.
- No no no, I'm sorry.

816
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:19,568
I've got like $600
in this thing now

817
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,918
between the limo, the tux,

818
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:24,010
the corsage, the tickets

819
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,068
and this hotel room I got.

820
00:49:26,168 --> 00:49:27,668
You said
you were going alone

821
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:29,768
and I was going to surprise you.
I mean I wanted to...

822
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:31,268
Oh, well...

823
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:34,968
I've got a date now.

824
00:49:36,868 --> 00:49:38,768
You said in your card
you were gonna wait.

825
00:49:38,803 --> 00:49:41,268
Well, Danny,

826
00:49:41,368 --> 00:49:44,368
did you expect me to wait
for you like some puppet?

827
00:49:44,403 --> 00:49:46,433
Well, no, but I mean...

828
00:49:46,468 --> 00:49:48,868
Did you honestly think
that if I was given the opportunity,

829
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:50,733
I wasn't going to take it,

830
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:54,933
especially in response
to your deceit?

831
00:49:54,968 --> 00:49:57,268
Deceit? What are you talking about?
I was honest with you

832
00:49:57,303 --> 00:49:59,468
- from the beginning.
- Bullshit you were honest.

833
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:04,468
You told me you only had eyes
for that stupid sophomore.

834
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:10,268
You just don't want
to go with me.

835
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,533
No no, that's... no.

836
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:15,168
I actually wanted to go
with you from the start.

837
00:50:15,268 --> 00:50:18,168
Craig, he was
brainwashing me. He was...

838
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:20,868
God, you're in control
of your own life.

839
00:50:23,468 --> 00:50:25,433
Look...

840
00:50:25,468 --> 00:50:28,268
I really have to go, okay?

841
00:50:28,303 --> 00:50:29,768
I know.

842
00:50:32,268 --> 00:50:34,168
Anyway...

843
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:37,468
you look really nice.

844
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:42,033
I guess...

845
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:44,368
I mean... I just wish...

846
00:50:47,468 --> 00:50:49,168
I'm sorry.

847
00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:52,868
Yeah.

848
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,168
Oh shit.

849
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,667
Minda, hey, it's Danny Stein.
Do you remember me?

850
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:47,832
No, we met
at that debate tournament

851
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:49,567
and you were making fun
of that coach, Miss Hoytz.

852
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:51,832
Yeah yeah, you thought
it'd be hilarious

853
00:51:51,867 --> 00:51:53,667
if she named her kid Ash, 'cause then
she'd have to go around saying

854
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:55,232
"My Ash Hoytz."

855
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:56,932
Francine, hi. I was
in "The Phantom Tollbooth"

856
00:51:56,967 --> 00:51:59,367
with you in the sixth grade.
I played the dodecahedron.

857
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:01,567
Hello?
Jody, hey, yeah.

858
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:03,932
It's your cousin Danny.

859
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,667
I was wondering what
you were doing tonight.

860
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:09,467
Oh, you are?
What's Aunt Joy doing?

861
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:12,367
Is she... oh, okay.

862
00:52:12,402 --> 00:52:15,167
Well, I've gotta...

863
00:52:15,202 --> 00:52:17,167
I've gotta go.

864
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:39,567
Come on, Dad. Pick up. Come on.

865
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:46,967
# Some people say #

866
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:49,432
# You look lovely #

867
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:54,267
# Some say you need a chance in love #

868
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:56,632
# I want to say to you... #

869
00:52:56,667 --> 00:53:00,117
Some of our chat sessions
were just...

870
00:53:00,152 --> 00:53:03,567
I feel like
we've had sex already.

871
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:06,232
Yeah, well, pretty much.

872
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,517
Just once I'd like to live out

873
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,767
the fantasies without a computer.

874
00:53:10,802 --> 00:53:13,532
Like, personally,

875
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:15,932
I've always wanted to lead
a guy into the forest

876
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,967
after a light drizzle,
just rip off each other's clothes.

877
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:23,467
You would be on top
and my bare body,

878
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,867
rubbing up against
the moist, slippery soil.

879
00:53:26,902 --> 00:53:30,167
And there would be like
a layer of damp leaves.

880
00:53:30,267 --> 00:53:33,867
And as we hold each other tight,

881
00:53:33,967 --> 00:53:38,332
pumping away,
back and forth, back and forth,

882
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:41,367
the leaves would be sticking
all over my naked body.

883
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,232
You have a phone call.

884
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:51,167
- Your phone, it's vibrating.
- Oh oh oh.

885
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:55,667
I'm sorry, I really should take this.
It's my son here.

886
00:53:55,702 --> 00:53:57,767
What's up?

887
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,367
Dad, I've been calling you
for the last 15 minutes.

888
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:02,067
- I'm in the middle of dinner.
- No, I know.

889
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:04,867
- This woman is fantastic.
- Dad, listen.

890
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:07,867
For once I feel like
I'm making a connection here.

891
00:54:07,902 --> 00:54:09,632
Dad, listen to me.

892
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,232
- What?
- I'm a loser.

893
00:54:11,267 --> 00:54:13,667
You're not a loser.
What are you talking about?

894
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:15,332
Dad, just face it, all right?

895
00:54:15,367 --> 00:54:16,932
Why, 'cause you're
going with Camille?

896
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:20,067
I'm not going with Camille now.
Craig's going with Camille.

897
00:54:20,102 --> 00:54:21,932
The thing's in an hour.
I've got the chauffeur here.

898
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,567
I don't have a car. I'm not gonna
show up in a limo by myself.

899
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:27,232
Will you...
calm down, will you?

900
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,217
Why is she going with Craig?
Hasn't he had

901
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:31,159
that same girlfriend
since third grade?

902
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:33,032
No, she got
these bad sun blisters.

903
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:36,167
- Sun blisters.
- Dad, my whole world's caving in

904
00:54:36,267 --> 00:54:38,767
and it's 'cause the entire senior class
has managed to get dates now.

905
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:41,167
And they all have rooms, too,
the whole class...

906
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:43,067
Sherman, Buchwald.

907
00:54:43,102 --> 00:54:44,867
Dad, Bart got a room.

908
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:50,067
Bart got a room?

909
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:55,632
Let me see what
I can do. Hold on.

910
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,667
God, I feel terrible,
but it's an emergency.

911
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,967
No no, don't worry
if it's an emergency. God, of course.

912
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:03,167
It's my kid, but I really want
to make this up to you.

913
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,367
Could we get together again,
like, tomorrow?

914
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:12,467
- Is he hurt?
- No. Actually, it's the senior prom.

915
00:55:12,567 --> 00:55:14,267
I've got to help find him a date.

916
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:15,967
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

917
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:19,767
It's just that
he's counting on me.

918
00:55:19,802 --> 00:55:22,034
Well, could you
at least drive me home?

919
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,267
Um, sorry, you're gonna
have to take a cab.

920
00:55:24,302 --> 00:55:26,467
Excuse me.
Sorry sorry. Excuse me.

921
00:55:26,502 --> 00:55:28,467
Excuse me. Excuse me.

922
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:39,167
Kill him. I'm gonna kill him.

923
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:41,067
I'm gonna kill him.

924
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:44,667
You know? Because I've always
wanted to go with Betsy McMullen

925
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:46,667
and that was...

926
00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:49,667
see, that was the problem
from the start.

927
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:55,267
Betsy.

928
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:12,532
Yeah, Dad?

929
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:14,367
All right, break down
the necessities here:

930
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:16,617
One, somewhere near
the Bonaventure, right?

931
00:56:16,652 --> 00:56:18,767
There's gotta be
lots of women around there.

932
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:21,667
Two, they've got to be dressed nice.
That's gotta be important.

933
00:56:21,702 --> 00:56:23,884
Now look for women
who could be dressed for a prom,

934
00:56:23,919 --> 00:56:26,067
which means what?
We need someone in formal wear.

935
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:35,167
Coming through.
Coming through. Excuse me.

936
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:12,032
Yeah, what have you got?

937
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:16,132
- Brown hair, brown eyes.
How old?

938
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:19,966
I don't know.
12, could pass for 13, 14.

939
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:22,366
No. No no.
Dad, that's too young.

940
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:23,866
All right, all right.

941
00:57:25,766 --> 00:57:28,066
I've got a five-footer,
big hair, lots of makeup.

942
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:29,666
- How old?
- Maybe 35.

943
00:57:29,766 --> 00:57:32,566
- 35?
- All right. Calm down, calm down.

944
00:57:32,601 --> 00:57:35,066
Don't panic, just...

945
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:37,666
Jesus.

946
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:30,566
Are you a cop, honey?

947
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:34,116
Uh, no, l...
no, I'm here for my kid.

948
00:58:34,151 --> 00:58:37,566
- How much you got?
- Oh, yeah, l...

949
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:42,966
Okay.

950
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:55,966
So how old's your kid?

951
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:59,766
He's 17... 18, he's 18.

952
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:02,431
Just turned, actually.

953
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:04,766
What, is it his birthday
or something?

954
00:59:04,801 --> 00:59:07,666
Uh, no.

955
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:11,566
Okay, she's gonna
meet you at the front entrance.

956
00:59:11,601 --> 00:59:14,266
Don't ask any questions.

957
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:43,366
Um, how...
how do I know that you're not...

958
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:46,466
because, you know,
that could be awkward.

959
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:50,066
What does that feel like?

960
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:52,366
Okay, that's it.

961
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:34,866
Stein?

962
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:23,966
- Tickets, please.
- Yeah.

963
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:26,966
Oh.

964
01:01:30,466 --> 01:01:32,966
That's all right.
I know you've got 'em.

965
01:01:41,466 --> 01:01:45,266
Wait a second.
What is this?

966
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,166
It's the, um...

967
01:01:51,766 --> 01:01:53,666
it's the prom.

968
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:59,766
- I don't do proms.
- What do you mean you don't do proms?

969
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:02,866
I just don't do proms, honey.

970
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:04,766
Wha...

971
01:02:20,566 --> 01:02:23,366
Okay, big smile. Pose for a second.

972
01:02:23,466 --> 01:02:25,666
At the count of three
look at right here, please.

973
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,983
Ready?
One, two and three.

974
01:02:28,018 --> 01:02:30,192
One more time.
Big smile.

975
01:02:30,227 --> 01:02:32,331
Yeah, there you go. That's it.

976
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:35,466
Turn closer, a little more to me.
That's it. Big smile.

977
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,666
Thank you. Next.

978
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:42,666
A big smile.
Thank you. Next.

979
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,566
# Oh oh! #

980
01:03:25,265 --> 01:03:26,865
Danny.

981
01:03:28,165 --> 01:03:29,765
Bart.

982
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:32,465
Did you hear
what happened?

983
01:03:32,565 --> 01:03:33,865
What?

984
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:36,965
They overbooked the hotel.

985
01:03:38,665 --> 01:03:42,165
I didn't get a room.

986
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,930
No?

987
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:46,665
I got a suite.

988
01:04:53,565 --> 01:04:56,265
- What happened?
- Doesn't do proms.

989
01:05:00,565 --> 01:05:03,965
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah, all right.

990
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:06,515
- What are you having?
- A vodka tonic.

991
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,965
- Do you want a vodka tonic?
- Yeah, sure.

992
01:05:11,665 --> 01:05:14,565
- Hey, how's it going?
- Fuck you.

993
01:05:15,865 --> 01:05:18,365
- Not a good sign.
- Yeah, not so good.

994
01:05:19,965 --> 01:05:22,565
Well, look at it this way...

995
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,565
it can't get any worse.

996
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,465
Okay, well, actually...

997
01:05:29,565 --> 01:05:31,565
Mom.

998
01:05:37,265 --> 01:05:39,465
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?

999
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:41,965
- What's he doing here?
- Hello, Beth.

1000
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,665
Ernie.

1001
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:46,365
I drove over 'cause you left
the tickets at the house.

1002
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:48,965
- Yeah, I left them.
- I was worried you wouldn't get in.

1003
01:05:49,065 --> 01:05:51,865
- Thanks.
- I was... wait, where's Camille?

1004
01:05:51,965 --> 01:05:54,330
She went with Craig.
- With Craig?

1005
01:05:54,365 --> 01:05:56,265
Are you serious?
What happened to his girlfriend?

1006
01:05:56,365 --> 01:05:58,365
She had these
bad sun blisters.

1007
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,365
Sun blisters, and so...

1008
01:06:00,465 --> 01:06:03,465
- Dad was helping me find a date.
- Just now?

1009
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,465
- Yup.
- And you got dressed up to do that?

1010
01:06:06,565 --> 01:06:08,465
No, I was on my own date.

1011
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:10,165
He left her to help me.

1012
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:13,565
- And you helped him?
- Uh, yes.

1013
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:17,165
- We found a nice, lovely...
- Yeah, she was...

1014
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,865
Where'd you find her?

1015
01:06:18,965 --> 01:06:21,865
- Oh, a couple... a couple...
- Yeah, she was...

1016
01:06:21,965 --> 01:06:25,365
- Well, where is she?
Doesn't do proms.

1017
01:06:27,565 --> 01:06:31,265
Well, then... well, then you're
not gonna go at all?

1018
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,530
- No.
- Oh. Oh!

1019
01:06:34,565 --> 01:06:36,865
Oh, this was supposed
to be the highlight...

1020
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,765
- this was gonna be...
- Whatever.

1021
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,765
Hey, would you like a drink?

1022
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,465
Yeah, all right.

1023
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,965
Can I get a Harvey Wallbanger
for my ex-wife?

1024
01:06:45,065 --> 01:06:47,465
- Right? Harvey Wallbanger?
- Right. Thank you.

1025
01:06:47,565 --> 01:06:49,930
Hey, doesn't Danny
look handsome?

1026
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:52,565
Oh, are you kidding me?
He's adorable.

1027
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:54,365
- You like the tux I got him?
- It's nice.

1028
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,030
I see you got him
a tie too.

1029
01:06:56,065 --> 01:06:58,065
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want...

1030
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,565
Thank you.

1031
01:07:00,765 --> 01:07:02,930
So did this guy
propose or what?

1032
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:06,665
- I think he was about to.
Who is he?

1033
01:07:06,765 --> 01:07:10,165
- How... how would you...
- No.

1034
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,565
- He's a nice guy.
- Yes. Uh-huh.

1035
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,730
And you? How's...

1036
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:18,865
- Met a woman tonight... interesting.
- I'm sorry to screw that up.

1037
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,265
Hey, you couldn't have known
this was all gonna happen.

1038
01:07:21,365 --> 01:07:23,765
- No, this was out of your control.
- This was not his fault.

1039
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,865
He was a victim
of circumstances.

1040
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:29,165
I think you should've been
more aggressive with that sophomore.

1041
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,065
God, you're in control
of your own life.

1042
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,930
You're gonna have
a great picture.

1043
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,365
- Leave him alone. He's working on it.
- What is it that you want?

1044
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,965
Every kid wishes their parents
would get back together,

1045
01:07:38,065 --> 01:07:39,965
but it's not realistic.

1046
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,830
"This moment forever."

1047
01:07:41,865 --> 01:07:43,830
You didn't think she was cute?

1048
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:46,965
Yeah, but she's ditzy
and Danny doesn't do well with ditzy.

1049
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,765
Hold on.
Wait, I'll... I'll be...

1050
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:52,265
don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

1051
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:57,365
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1052
01:08:00,565 --> 01:08:02,165
Come on, come on.

1053
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,565
Hey.

1054
01:08:58,565 --> 01:09:00,665
How's your night?

1055
01:09:01,865 --> 01:09:04,065
You know,
it's actually a lot of fun

1056
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,265
spending a night
like this by yourself.

1057
01:09:06,365 --> 01:09:09,365
You don't have to
share it with anybody.

1058
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,965
- Seriously.
This is nothing to argue...

1059
01:09:14,065 --> 01:09:15,465
- we can hang out tomorrow.
- It's not too bad.

1060
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,230
- Come on.
- This is... what? No no no no.

1061
01:09:17,265 --> 01:09:19,764
You need to go home
and get some sleep. I'm sorry.

1062
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,829
What, so you can spend
your prom with her?

1063
01:09:21,864 --> 01:09:23,764
- Are you gonna forgive me?
What was I supposed to do,

1064
01:09:23,799 --> 01:09:25,864
stay home?
I didn't get any sun blisters.

1065
01:09:25,964 --> 01:09:27,764
Did you ever
even consider my feelings about this?

1066
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:44,264
I'm sorry.
I'm not going home with you right now.

1067
01:09:44,299 --> 01:09:47,229
- I've got to take this suit back...
- Okay.

1068
01:09:47,264 --> 01:09:49,864
...in the morning. Do you realize that?
I have to be up at 6:00 in the morning

1069
01:09:49,964 --> 01:09:52,164
and take this stupid thing...
what are you doing?

1070
01:09:56,064 --> 01:09:59,264
- I've got to show you something.
- Where are we going?

1071
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:01,229
To the bar.
My parents are there.

1072
01:10:01,264 --> 01:10:04,014
What are your parents
doing at the bar?

1073
01:10:04,049 --> 01:10:06,764
- Moral support, I guess.
One more time.

1074
01:10:06,864 --> 01:10:08,264
Next.

1075
01:10:26,164 --> 01:10:28,064
...water in the sink. I can see it...

1076
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:30,064
No. You see the... Camille.

1077
01:10:30,164 --> 01:10:31,729
- Hi.
- How's it going?

1078
01:10:31,764 --> 01:10:34,329
Good good. Just trying
to get through this alive, I guess.

1079
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:36,764
I just wanted to let you guys know
I've got Camille with me now,

1080
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,329
so we're gonna go
in there and have fun.

1081
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:39,764
- That's... go. Go for it.
- Oh, that's great.

1082
01:10:39,864 --> 01:10:41,864
Are you guys gonna...
you know?

1083
01:10:41,964 --> 01:10:43,929
Oh, I'm probably
gonna take off.

1084
01:10:43,964 --> 01:10:45,664
I've got to get back to...
listen, it was so good to see you.

1085
01:10:45,764 --> 01:10:48,364
It was good to see you
and I'll see you at graduation.

1086
01:10:48,464 --> 01:10:49,764
Graduation.
Yes, we'll see you then.

1087
01:10:49,799 --> 01:10:51,429
It might be kind of weird,

1088
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:54,064
but do you guys want to come in?

1089
01:10:54,164 --> 01:10:56,429
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1090
01:10:56,464 --> 01:10:58,464
- I'm not going into the prom.
- Besides, the kids don't want

1091
01:10:58,499 --> 01:11:00,464
- to see the parents.
- No, honey, tonight is your night.

1092
01:11:00,564 --> 01:11:02,964
You need to go in there
and celebrate with everybody.

1093
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:05,429
Yeah, you're right... I should,

1094
01:11:05,464 --> 01:11:07,464
and I know exactly
where we're going.

1095
01:11:07,499 --> 01:11:10,164
Eins, zwei, drei.

1096
01:11:16,664 --> 01:11:19,964
Oh, I don't think we're allowed
to be in here, Danny.

1097
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:28,964
And so this is
how I spent my night.

1098
01:11:30,264 --> 01:11:31,764
Nothing like
what I had hoped for,

1099
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:34,029
but somehow better.

1100
01:11:34,064 --> 01:11:36,664
Somehow just the way
it should've been.

1101
01:11:38,264 --> 01:11:40,864
Did I look even remotely cool?

1102
01:11:40,899 --> 01:11:43,081
Probably not, but...

1103
01:11:43,116 --> 01:11:45,229
I spent my prom night

1104
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:47,464
with the three people
I love the most.

1105
01:11:48,864 --> 01:11:51,014
And after we danced
the "Electric Slide,"

1106
01:11:51,049 --> 01:11:53,164
after the four of us
played a drunker game

1107
01:11:53,264 --> 01:11:55,829
of Boggle
in my hotel room,

1108
01:11:55,864 --> 01:11:59,564
just before I fell asleep next to
my oldest friend on the single bed,

1109
01:12:01,064 --> 01:12:03,764
I finally had
this moment of clarity.

1110
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:08,564
We can't choose our memories.

1111
01:12:08,599 --> 01:12:11,264
The best ones just happen.

1112
01:12:11,364 --> 01:12:14,564
So what's the point of trying
to create the perfect moment

1113
01:12:14,599 --> 01:12:17,864
when the perfect moment

1114
01:12:17,964 --> 01:12:20,264
is right now?
