1
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,354
- Hey, man, let's get out of here!
- School is out.

2
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,678
What's up, little brother?
I gotta catch up with the twins.

3
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,078
Hi, Will.

4
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,839
Hi, Gwen. Come on, let's go.

5
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,315
Hey, Will.

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,869
Any thoughts on your first semester
as an American overseas?

7
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,234
Guys, stop it.
Just answer.

8
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,753
In an English place.

9
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,751
At an English school.

10
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,036
The people wanna know
if you made any friends.

11
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,316
That's their question to you.

12
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,076
Any, uh, lady friends, maybe?

13
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,595
Looks like a pretty lady there.
- Okay, guys? Guys, back off.

14
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,988
- Shut up.
- Talk to her.

15
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,754
- Why don't you talk to her?
Because I see you want to.

16
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,758
Hey, that's the new girl, right?

17
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,474
Will, why don't you go talk to her?

18
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,392
I mean, why not?

19
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,354
Wait, you forgot your scarf!

20
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,069
Are we gonna go to any soccer games?

21
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,031
Good afternoon, Stantons.

22
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,749
Miss Greythorne wishes to extend
an invitation to the whole family...

23
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,276
...to attend a Christmas Eve party
at the manor. Mince pies, mulled wine.

24
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,873
- Can we count on you?
- Yeah.

25
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,075
What about you, Will?

26
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,072
- Oh, yes, Mr. Lyon. We'll be... I'll be...
- It's Merriman, please.

27
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,396
- Okay.
- Look forward to your company.

28
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,437
We'll be there.

29
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,237
If you refuse, I'm afraid we'll be
forced to ridicule you behind your backs.

30
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,271
What's a mince?
I hope it's a fruit.

31
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,830
Would it kill them to put, like,
a cherry or apples in their pies?

32
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,797
- Lf it has meat in it...
Guys, wait up.

33
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,349
...I don't think
it should be called a pie.

34
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,712
Hey, guys, look who's home.

35
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,474
Whoa! Look at this stranger.
Max!

36
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,358
Hello, fellas.
Oh, my God, Max.

37
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,839
What are you doing here?

38
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,991
Hey. Family Christmas.

39
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,958
Family Christmas?
Didn't stop you missing last year.

40
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,269
- Or the year before.
Hey.

41
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,035
Hey, Gwen, sweetie, you don't
let these guys corrupt you, all right?

42
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,797
So, Max, how's college?
- Uh, it's pretty good.

43
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,589
Hey, Max.
You still doing that tae kwon do?

44
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,159
- Come on.
Here it comes.

45
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,753
Challenge me.

46
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,273
Don't kill him. He just got home.
Guys.

47
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,357
Hey, Mom.

48
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,158
- How was school?
It was good.

49
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,435
Yeah?

50
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,919
Will.

51
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,157
I got your room.

52
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,192
Hey, Will.

53
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,754
How long are you staying?

54
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,956
I don't know. A week, maybe two.

55
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,834
- All this for a week or two?
- Come on, Will, do me this one favor.

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,718
People to see,
I got phone calls to make.

57
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,155
I can't do that
if I'm sleeping in the attic, can I?

58
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,278
- But I can?
- Yeah, well, you're young. Versatile.

59
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,593
Hey. We gonna go all out
for your birthday?

60
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,750
- Special day. I didn't forget.
- Don't change the subject.

61
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,751
Thirteen.

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,594
They grow up so fast.

63
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,879
Fourteen, actually.

64
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,828
Hey, man. Lame about Max. Come on in.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,911
- Glad to have you here.
- Hey...

66
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,078
...this will be your designated area.
Yes. Smile.

67
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,752
It's tape. What?
That's funny. Come on.

68
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,791
Boys, turn the TV off. James.

69
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,190
Come on. Everything's getting cold.

70
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,794
Ketchup.
Where have you been, honey?

71
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,318
None of your business.

72
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,916
Maybe, uh... Maybe next year we'll get
Stephen home, make up the full crew.

73
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,753
- Would you like to see Stephen?
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,037
Well, we'll try to get him home.
Depends where the Navy sends him.

75
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,838
The Bermuda Triangle.
- To Stephen.

76
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,109
To Stephen.

77
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,750
How come yours is in a can?

78
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,718
So, Max,
how did the semester finish off?

79
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,393
Oh, it was, uh,
it was good, you know.

80
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,716
- Any more thoughts on grad school?
Nope.

81
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,235
Just still, you know,
weighing my options.

82
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,430
- Weighing your options.
- And what about you, Dad?

83
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,477
Things are pretty good.

84
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,358
Good, so then you're coping?

85
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,879
I mean, it's a lot, you know.
New place, new job.

86
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,554
It's been a long time
since you've felt able, right?

87
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,517
Max, drop it.

88
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,194
No, it's all right. It's all right.

89
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,757
- It's turning out to be a good year.
- Yeah.

90
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,070
- The move here has been good for us.
- It has.

91
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,309
All of us.

92
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,593
Will. Will!

93
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,352
What are you staring at?

94
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,556
- The dogs.
Hey, man, I know that look.

95
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,154
Yeah, it's the look that girl
gave you on the bus.

96
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,437
- You met a girl on the bus today?
- No, he looked at a girl on the bus today.

97
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,591
Wasn't his type.
She looked at me.

98
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,990
All right. Leave him be.
I'm good-Looking. Can't help it.

99
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,434
Isn't this nice?

100
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,717
I told you
we should have trimmed it first.

101
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,479
Hey, guys, the tree's here.

102
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,591
Come on, George, push.
There we go.

103
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,878
Come on. It's gorgeous. Just bring it
on through. Be careful of the boots.

104
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,634
Boys, come and help.
Isn't that gorgeous?

105
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,429
Just lean it up against that wall
and my boys will take care of it.

106
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,239
Will, this is Mr. Dawson
from Court Farm, and George.

107
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,354
I got it.

108
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,389
So...

109
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,155
...this is Will Stanton, eh?

110
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,476
- A pleasure to meet you.
- And you, sir.

111
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,797
Hey, George, look here. It's Will.

112
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,430
So it be. And with a birthday today
as well.

113
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,239
- Yeah.
That's right.

114
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,197
Yeah, that's right.

115
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,840
Can I get you gentlemen something,
coffee or tea?

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,709
No, we're only stopping.
Too much to do before the storm sets in.

117
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,114
- The storm?
Yes.

118
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,669
Bad weather on the way.
Tomorrow will be a bad night.

119
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,671
The nights after...

120
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,559
...beyond imagining.
- Really?

121
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,358
Excuse me.

122
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,554
Well, you have a good day, huh?

123
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,631
- Come on, George.
Thank you so much.

124
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,835
Missis.
- Will.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,912
- You gonna come open your presents?
- Oh, yeah.

126
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,192
Hey, heads up.

127
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,512
Happy birthday, big guy.

128
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,792
Sorry, I made a little mistake with
the age. I'll fix that right up for you.

129
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,757
No, no, that's okay.

130
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,036
Here you go. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

131
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,156
Second one comes on Christmas.
There's two.

132
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,117
Yeah, happy birthday, man.

133
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,153
Is this all the milk we have?

134
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,958
I'm gonna make some eggs, all right?

135
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,518
Boys, come on.
Give me a hand here.

136
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,439
Gwen.

137
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,520
- You shouldn't have.
- I knew everyone else would forget.

138
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,194
- Thanks.
- Here, let me help you.

139
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,518
- So what's your wish?
- What?

140
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,229
It's your birthday.
You're allowed to have a wish, anything.

141
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,909
Snow. You know,
like we used to get back at home.

142
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,436
- Yeah.
- I want lots of snow.

143
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,154
You guys, I got him. He's here.
<i>- Hey, can you hear me?</i>

144
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,231
- Stephen!
- Hey, son.

145
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,551
<i>Hey, Mom and Dad.
Bros! Gwen, look at you.</i>

146
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,950
<i>- You're becoming a heartbreaker.</i>
Isn't she?

147
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,430
<i>Sorry I can't be there. As you can see,
I'm busy defending the free world.</i>

148
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,750
We miss you, son.
Very tropical.

149
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,030
<i>All the gifts sort of have
a Hawaiian theme.</i>

150
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,031
Yeah, perfect for winter in England.

151
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,356
<i>Hey, Will, listen, yours is different.</i>

152
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,118
<i>I was walking the street market,
and...</i>

153
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,793
<i>For some reason,
I knew it was for you.</i>

154
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,635
- Cool. Thanks, Stephen.
- How cute. Oh, these are fantastic.

155
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,916
<i>Anyway, enjoy the day,
and I wish I was there.</i>

156
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,435
You too.
We wish you were home too, Stephen.

157
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,512
<i>Take care of Mom and Dad, guys.
Merry Christmas.</i>

158
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,910
Merry Christmas!

159
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,558
You want all those things, do you?

160
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,038
Can I help you?

161
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,993
Hello? Are you going to buy that?

162
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,316
Sorry. Um, it's for my sister.

163
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,391
It's 5 pounds.

164
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,992
Thank you.

165
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,153
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thanks.

166
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,877
Excuse me, sir.

167
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,395
I wonder if you wouldn't mind
coming back with us.

168
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,319
We think you left the store
without paying for an item.

169
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,476
What? No, I don't think so. I'm sorry.

170
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,154
It might just be a simple mistake, sir...

171
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,834
...but perhaps you would
accompany us to our office...

172
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,595
...rather than dealing with it
here in public.

173
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,429
- This way.
- Please.

174
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,520
- You all right, then?
Mm-hm.

175
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,314
Nicked something, didn't you?

176
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,190
- "Nicked"?
- You stole something.

177
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,436
We've been watching you
from the moment you came in.

178
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,232
He looks like trouble.

179
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,038
Looks like a thief.

180
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,994
Wandering hands have deep pockets.

181
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,037
Children are always the worst.

182
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,874
You won't mind
if we search you, then? Mm?

183
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,873
- What?
- Or you'd rather we call your parents?

184
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,868
Tell them you're being investigated
for shoplifting...

185
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,235
...which is a criminal offense
in this country.

186
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,358
- That's right.
- Don't waste our time, Will.

187
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,839
Just give us the Sign.

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,399
How do you know my name?

189
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,233
- Give us the Sign, Will.
- Just give us the Sign.

190
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,356
- Give us the Sign.
- Just give us the Sign.

191
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,839
The Sign. Give us the Sign.

192
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,950
Give us... Give us the Sign.
Give us the Sign!

193
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,393
Get off!

194
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,558
Will, get out of the way.

195
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,669
Hey, guys.

196
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,034
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Dad.

197
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,431
Robin. Paul. How many times
we have to tell you? Not in the house.

198
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,794
Sorry.
Sorry, Dad.

199
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,188
Dad... Dad, can we talk?

200
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,954
Can we do it later, Will? I have to
grade all this before the holidays.

201
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,873
Since nobody wants to stress about
physics over Christmas...

202
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,430
...I have to do it myself. Later, I promise.
- Just for a sec, please.

203
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,633
Look, something is going on with me.
I'm... I don't...

204
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,915
It's mixed up.

205
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,511
Will, you're 14.
These changes are normal.

206
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,875
Uh, you talk to your brothers about it.

207
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,430
Your body starting to feel
all funny and different?

208
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,149
Oh. Sorry.

209
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,191
It's lovely.

210
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,396
Go inside, sir. Have a marvelous time.

211
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,913
Thank you, sir.

212
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,150
- Stantons.
Hello.

213
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,958
Merry Christmas.
Give me your coats.

214
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,917
Thank you very much.
Coat, darling.

215
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,799
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you. Coat.

216
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,871
Go on in and have a wonderful time.
Coats, please.

217
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,238
Oh, look at this.

218
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,791
Merry Christmas.
Do take something to eat.

219
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,188
- Hope you're hungry.
I am.

220
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,351
- They're always hungry.
Yes, they are.

221
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,239
Merry Christmas, Miss Greythorne.

222
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,350
- We need to talk to him.
- Discretion, Merriman.

223
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,829
There is a right way to do things.

224
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,752
And a way of getting them done.

225
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,636
A drink for the vicar, please.

226
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,839
Thank you very much, Merriman.
- Less haste, Merriman.

227
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,111
No way.

228
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,869
Ha, ha.

229
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,878
It's fruit. Mince pie is fruit.

230
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,395
- Oh, thank God.
It's fruit?

231
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,829
All right?

232
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,555
- Something to eat?
- No. No, I'm fine.

233
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,876
- Drink?
- I'm cool.

234
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,190
Nice to see you again.

235
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,276
Out of your league, buddy.

236
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,158
Watch and learn.

237
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,632
- Hey, how you doing?
Hi there.

238
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,597
Thank you.

239
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,195
Want some food or something?
Sure.

240
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,956
He slipped away.
- He had his reasons.

241
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,348
We ought to go after him.

242
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,751
This may not be the best moment.
The boy is troubled.

243
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,115
I'm used to dealing
with warriors, not boys.

244
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,316
This warrior is a boy.

245
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,189
We can't afford to wait.
You know what's out there.

246
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,673
Why do you run, boy?
- Who are you? What do you want?

247
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,554
- The Sign.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

248
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,113
Are you frightened of me?

249
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,149
You should be, Will. I'm very angry.
All this time it was you.

250
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,920
- Give me the Sign.
- What Sign?

251
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,270
- Give it to me!
- I don't know what you're talking about.

252
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,829
You escaped me once before,
a mistake I won't repeat.

253
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,798
- Now, give me the Sign.
Leave him be.

254
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,078
Leave the boy alone, Rider.

255
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,030
You can't fight us all.

256
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,591
- You're not strong enough.
- Not yet, but I will be.

257
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,433
My power rises now.
Five days are all I need, then you...

258
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,192
...and all your kind will be destroyed.

259
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,552
Merry Christmas, Will.

260
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,753
Walk with us, Will.

261
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,868
- Where?
- Through time.

262
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,390
- Where am I?
This is the Great Hall...

263
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,998
...where we are strongest.
You're safe here, Will.

264
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,594
No one may enter here
without our invitation.

265
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,758
Who are you?

266
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,356
We are the Old Ones.
Well, to tell the truth...

267
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,798
...we're neither young nor old,
being outside time.

268
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,748
You're the last of us to be born.
You are the Sign Seeker.

269
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,559
Everybody keeps
talking about these Signs.

270
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,837
Sorry. Honestly, I don't know
what that is.

271
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,989
Will...

272
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,311
...you are part of something that
has been waiting for you all your life.

273
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,637
We, the Old Ones, we serve the Light.

274
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,756
The Rider, he serves the Dark.

275
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,991
The Dark is rising, Will.

276
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,993
It is you who must restore
the power of the Light.

277
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,115
Um, I'm sorry, Miss Greythorne,
but maybe you've got the wrong guy.

278
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,238
A thousand years ago,
a great battle was fought here...

279
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,955
...between the Light and the Dark.

280
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,799
The Light won, but only just...

281
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,951
...and the Earth was saved.

282
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,714
The Dark was defeated
but not destroyed.

283
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,791
To protect the power of the Light...

284
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,838
...it was divided and hidden
in the form of six Signs.

285
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,678
And the Seeker...

286
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,513
...will find the Signs.

287
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,750
And you think I'm this Seeker?

288
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,956
On your 14th birthday...

289
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,759
...when you were
first able to sense a Sign...

290
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,557
...the Dark sensed you.

291
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,280
In five days' time, it'll reach its peak.

292
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,268
Unless you have all the Signs,
you won't be able to fight it.

293
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,032
I don't know how to sense a Sign.

294
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,714
The book will tell you
how the Signs are to be found.

295
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,116
Only the Seeker can read the book.

296
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,270
You are special, Will.

297
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,237
The seventh son of a seventh son.

298
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,070
You got it wrong. Sixth, actually.
I only have five brothers.

299
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,949
I guess you made a mistake.
I'm sorry. I'm not the one.

300
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,509
You will not be able
to run from this, Will.

301
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,319
Better open that now.

302
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,552
See what'll happen in five days' time
if the Dark prevails.

303
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,993
Hey, Will. You're back late.

304
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,718
- Where you been?
- Went for a walk.

305
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,189
Why are you all dirty? Hey, man.

306
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,679
- Where were you?
- Tell us.

307
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,512
Leave me alone!

308
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,555
You okay?

309
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,632
Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

310
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,119
What was that?

311
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,637
I don't know. Puberty?

312
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,876
Where did you get this?

313
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,837
Surfing. Seemed sort of cool...

314
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,389
...and I figured, physics problem,
I know the man to ask.

315
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,790
Since when did physics become cool?

316
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,718
I don't know.
You spend all your time on it.

317
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,269
I thought maybe
we could spend time on it together.

318
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,109
I always hoped you'd stick to
more fulfilling pursuits, like Xbox.

319
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,033
Dad. Really, I'm interested.

320
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,557
It's, like, some sort of equation
about light and darkness.

321
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,870
Almost like they're fighting
for the same space.

322
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,077
What I need to know is, can dark win?

323
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,436
That's not how it works. There are
no winners and losers in physics, Will.

324
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,513
But according to this, Dad,
maybe darkness isn't just dark.

325
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,750
But like... But like a thing.

326
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,994
So I mean...

327
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,189
...could darkness...?
Could it hurt someone?

328
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,039
"Hurt someone"?

329
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,677
That's not how it...

330
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,638
Look, Will, don't waste your time with
this stuff. It's theoretical. It's boring.

331
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,950
- I wanna know.
- Well, you can't.

332
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,118
Look, Will, you're a kid. Just enjoy it.

333
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,915
Just be happy you don't have to
deal with it. I have work to do.

334
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,710
You know, Dad, when I was little...

335
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,071
...you never told me
not to be afraid of the dark.

336
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,510
Will, stay off that foot.

337
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,398
Mom, it's fine, okay? I just twisted it.

338
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,955
I called the doctor to see
if you should go to the hospital.

339
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,999
- I do not want to go to the hospital.
- I know. We'll see what he says.

340
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,071
Mom, I do not want
to go to the hospital.

341
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,071
Hello, doctor.
Good afternoon.

342
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,550
Come in.
And I hope you don't have to.

343
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,348
Hello, Will.
Let's have a look, shall we?

344
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,278
Come on, sweetheart.

345
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,238
- Come on.
Wait a minute, Mom. Mom.

346
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,038
- Honey, it's all right.
Come along.

347
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,918
Don't worry, I don't bite.

348
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,720
Come on. There we go.

349
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,758
Here we are. Let me see, here.

350
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,516
Mm. I wonder, Mrs. Stanton...

351
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,478
...do you have a tape measure
so I can check the swelling?

352
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,993
- Yes, yes, I'll go look.
- No.

353
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,872
- Thank you.
- Mom, stay here.

354
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,508
Somebody doesn't want to
be separated from his mommy.

355
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,240
Come on, now.
You'll be fine. I'll be right back.

356
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,872
- Leave me alone.
- These old fools...

357
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,792
...would have you do work
that they can't...

358
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,235
...but they haven't told you
that you'll fail.

359
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,356
Now, give me the Signs, Will.

360
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,034
I don't forget those
who stand with me.

361
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,873
- Nor those who stand against.
- I don't have what you want.

362
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,076
Will, I'm the Dark on this earth.

363
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,993
I'm the end of everything
you see and know.

364
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,313
But I can help you.

365
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,356
Or I can make things
very much worse.

366
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,308
Here we go.

367
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,753
Ah! Wonderful.

368
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,512
Actually, it's fine.

369
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,069
- The good news is he hasn't broken it.
- Yes.

370
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,755
But I do think he's damaged the
ligaments, so it's going to take time.

371
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,356
Now, my advice to you, William,
is take it easy.

372
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,233
And don't look so worried.
It's not the end of the world.

373
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,754
Not quite yet.

374
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,713
- All right.
- All right?

375
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,678
Terrific. Thank you for coming by.
I so appreciate it.

376
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,957
You have a lovely home.
Oh, thank you.

377
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,235
Bye!
Bye-bye.

378
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,756
<i>It's your brother. Tom.</i>

379
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,676
<i>You two were born just minutes apart.</i>

380
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,992
Another set of twins.

381
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,719
Huh. Can you imagine?

382
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,353
What...? What happened?

383
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,278
We... We don't know. We don't know.

384
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,759
What do you mean?

385
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,557
Mom, what do you mean?

386
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,915
When you were both...

387
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,470
...just 2 weeks old,
just new, just babies...

388
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,348
...there was a storm one night.

389
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,511
<i>You were both crying
and I took you downstairs.</i>

390
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,398
<i>Your father was working in the study.</i>

391
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,111
<i>I asked him to check on your brother.
He was distracted for a few minutes.</i>

392
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,998
<i>And when he went in...</i>

393
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,956
...Tom...

394
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,591
He was gone.

395
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,392
What, kidnapped?

396
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,673
They searched for months and we...

397
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,037
We hoped for years,
but they didn't...

398
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,999
They never found anything.

399
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,037
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- We were devastated.

400
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,988
Especially your dad.
You know, he just blamed himself.

401
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,998
As the years went by...

402
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,790
...we just spoke of it less and less...

403
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,190
...until finally...

404
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,519
...just not at all.

405
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,192
So...

406
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,993
...was Tom born before me?

407
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,119
Yeah.

408
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,478
Yeah, he was.

409
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,029
Another big brother.

410
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,715
Seventh son.

411
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,591
" Six Signs were created
to contain the power of the Light...

412
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,471
...from stone, bronze, iron,
wood and water.

413
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,879
But the sixth was to be carried
in the essence of a... "

414
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,038
The essence of a human soul?

415
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,555
"The Signs were hidden
and scattered throughout time.

416
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,149
The Seeker will find them. "

417
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,759
Okay.

418
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,718
Look at this.
This pattern, it's a fractal.

419
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,990
It's physics.
My dad teaches this stuff.

420
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,230
Like a hiding place
that goes on and on forever.

421
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,676
Like a clue hidden in plain sight
that declares the presence of a Sign.

422
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,271
George, can you
pass me your hammer, please?

423
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,078
Here you go.

424
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,992
Thank you.

425
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,359
Gwen, I'm sorry.

426
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,871
The Sign of Stone.

427
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,112
Five more to go.

428
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,515
You are the seventh son
of a seventh son, Will Stanton.

429
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,829
You step through time.

430
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,878
One by one, the Signs will call to you.
You will gather them...

431
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,830
...and gain the power of the Light.
You are the Seeker.

432
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,950
Not all the Signs will be so easy.

433
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,031
And the Rider wants them too.

434
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,637
He may try to trick or threaten you.

435
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,113
- Well, then how do I face the darkness?
- You'll learn to face it as you are.

436
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,872
You have powers, Will.

437
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,675
You'll be able to
command light or fire...

438
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,389
...move objects,
summon great strength...

439
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,712
...and, of course, step through time.

440
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,836
- Can I fly?
- What?

441
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,638
You know. Zoom. Fly.

442
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,597
No. No, I don't think you can.

443
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,516
Merry Christmas.

444
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,396
Mrs. Stanton.
- Yes.

445
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,357
May I introduce you to my mother?

446
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,077
Mother, this is Mrs. Stanton.
She lives in the village.

447
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,275
Hello.

448
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,113
And this is the young boy
I was telling you about.

449
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,396
A very happy Christmas to you all.

450
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,879
If we can now stand...

451
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,637
...we'll sing hymn number one from
the hymn book, "Joy to the World. "

452
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,796
Where is everybody?

453
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,719
Exactly when they were.

454
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,508
It's we that have moved.

455
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,591
They can't see it, of course.
You've sensed a Sign, Will.

456
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,998
You've moved us through time.

457
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,590
It's late 13th or early 14th century.

458
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,159
I see.

459
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,869
The crypt has not been bricked up,
so that means we're before the plague.

460
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,354
About 1290, I'd say.

461
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,399
Be quick, Will. The Rider was present
and he will hunt you through time.

462
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,153
I don't know where it is exactly,
just that it's here.

463
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,953
I suggest we prepare.

464
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,076
Merriman, guard the Seeker.

465
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,518
What do you reckon?

466
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,109
Dragon.

467
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,589
He wouldn't
send a dragon against us, Mr. Dawson.

468
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,398
Knows better than that.

469
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,079
- It could be a shapeless beast, I suppose.
- No. Dragon.

470
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,757
I don't think so.

471
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,837
Flagon of ale says it is.

472
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,758
That ain't no dragon.

473
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,872
Be careful. She's not what she seems.

474
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,310
Will, where's the Sign?

475
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,313
- I'm looking. I'm not sure.
- Concentrate!

476
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,192
I'm trying!

477
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,118
Guys!

478
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,319
Stand back, Will! Stand back, Will!

479
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,393
Hurry, Will! Hurry!

480
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,793
I'm trying. Ugh! Disgusting.

481
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,318
Come on, boy!

482
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,675
Find the Sign!

483
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,037
Will, use your powers.

484
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,913
My powers? Right. My powers.

485
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,198
Light!

486
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,479
Awesome.

487
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,472
"Thomas Stanton. "

488
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,519
You all right, Miss Greythorne?

489
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,750
This is highly unpleasant.

490
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,393
Will, do hurry up!

491
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,950
Will! Do something! Will!

492
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,198
Okay, Will. Your powers.

493
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,952
Will, hurry!

494
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,397
I found the Sign.
Guys, I found the Sign!

495
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,478
Thank you very much.

496
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,074
- Merry Christmas to you.
And you.

497
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,670
Professor, are you aware that we have
a Stanton buried in this churchyard?

498
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,116
- A Stanton here? No, I had no idea.
Really?

499
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,029
This section is the oldest
part of the church. You see there?

500
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,153
A stone built into the wall.

501
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,037
- Did you enjoy the service?
- How about your dear old mom, eh?

502
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,392
Your time will come.

503
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,591
"Here lie the remains of...

504
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,197
...Thomas Stanton. "

505
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,068
Stanton, Tom.

506
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,993
He's buried
in the crypt below the church.

507
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,919
An ancestor, perhaps.

508
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,956
- My ancestor was an Old One?
- Oh, not only that, Will.

509
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,236
He was a craftsman.

510
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,638
<i>In a time...</i>

511
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,035
<i>...of great danger,
when the Dark threatened...</i>

512
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,715
<i>...he made the Signs in secret,
even from us.</i>

513
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,551
<i>He told us that five
were made of common substance.</i>

514
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,752
And the sixth Sign?

515
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,196
Stanton said it could never be found
because it was never hidden.

516
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,158
Then how am I supposed to find it?

517
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,518
You're the Seeker. You're our guide.
Only you can interpret the meaning.

518
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,872
A soul freely given to unleash
the power of the Light.

519
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,198
His own?

520
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,030
Stanton, he made a choice, Will.

521
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,958
His family...

522
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,839
...fled from the Dark,
across the land...

523
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,838
...and his descendants,
across the water.

524
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,951
Until one day...

525
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,831
...they returned.
I don't see any dates.

526
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,472
Oh, so, there's no way of knowing,
is there?

527
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,232
It could be nothing to do with us,
right?

528
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,152
- I mean, just coincidence.
- Right.

529
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,278
Yes, of course. Coincidence.

530
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,271
Well, Merry Christmas.

531
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,000
Yes. Merry Christmas to you.

532
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,714
Miss Greythorne is
a generous supporter of the college.

533
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,153
You fixed a job for my dad?

534
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,192
Destiny brought you here, Will.
We just took care of the details.

535
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,472
My power increases by the day
and in three, I reach my peak.

536
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,840
But the Seeker has two Signs now
and with each, his strength also grows.

537
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,669
My offer is true.
Work fast, bring me what I want...

538
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,396
...and then you shall
reap your reward.

539
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,949
Best one yet.

540
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,350
Thank you, sweetheart.
It was good, wasn't it?

541
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,919
Oh, I'm stuffed.

542
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,311
I am so full.
And we've got lots of turkey leftovers.

543
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,074
- Fantastic for sandwiches.
Good, sandwiches.

544
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,037
Hi, guys.
Hey. Um...

545
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,350
Hi.
- Everyone, this is Maggie.

546
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,118
- Maggie, everyone.
Hi.

547
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,077
Hi, Maggie.
How you doing?

548
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,389
Can I help with anything?

549
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,068
No, we're fine, really.
Don't worry about it.

550
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,555
We're just stopping for a minute,
then we're gonna run...

551
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,075
- James, come on, help your mom.
What?

552
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,111
That's right, James. Help your mom.

553
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,272
Thanks.
Yeah. Come on over.

554
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,754
Are you an Old One?

555
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,833
Do I look like an Old One?

556
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,753
No, no! I just... Older.

557
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,036
I'm just here to look out for you.
Okay?

558
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,875
Brr. Catch your death out here.

559
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,789
- Can I help you?
- Yes, Max, I think you can.

560
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,554
Very good.

561
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,149
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

562
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,629
I can do much more.

563
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,670
I have powers.

564
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,238
Come here.

565
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,557
So you and James, are you guys...?

566
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,315
- Are you guys, like, um...?
- What?

567
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,233
- Friends?
- Yes. I like your brother.

568
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,597
I mean, "boyfriend-girlfriend" friends.

569
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,472
Will, aren't there more important things
for you to be thinking about right now?

570
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,910
It's important to me.

571
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,233
I've been thinking about you...

572
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,313
I just... I felt like we were connected.

573
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,868
Hey, where you been?

574
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,471
Waiting for you,
and hanging with your little brother.

575
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,119
So sweet.

576
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,794
Let's go.

577
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,754
Yeah.

578
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,512
"Sweet. " Aw.

579
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,868
Can we talk?

580
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,912
I've spent my life being Will Stanton,
a social inadequate.

581
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,594
Most of the time I'm just invisible.

582
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,355
Then you come along and tell me
I'm special and that I've got powers.

583
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,075
So I'm like, " Great, now life's
gonna be better now, right?"

584
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,231
No. No, it's not.

585
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,635
I am no superhero.

586
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,677
I'm still me.

587
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,116
You are the Seeker, Will.

588
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,273
The future of the human race
rests on you. Don't you understand this?

589
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,908
Look, I'm supposed to save the world?

590
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,469
Okay, I can't even figure out
how to talk to a girl.

591
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,038
Don't let a girl distract you.
You've got work to do.

592
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,993
There are only three days left. Go on.

593
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,151
- Fine.
- Go on!

594
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,277
- Three days, Will.
- I got it.

595
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,752
Miss Greythorne. Look.

596
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,593
What is he doing? Hm?

597
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,158
Expressing himself.

598
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,914
Doesn't he know
he'll exhaust his powers?

599
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,792
You are not without
your own lessons to learn, Merriman.

600
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,557
He came to you, not for more warnings.
He needed you simply to listen.

601
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,472
Will?

602
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,196
Gwen, what are you doing here?

603
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,273
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

604
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,078
What are you doing?

605
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,511
Nothing.

606
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,749
What?

607
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,708
Stay close.

608
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,790
What happened?

609
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,191
- We stepped through time.
- What?

610
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,109
Gwen, go!

611
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,238
Gwen! Gwen, get down. Get down.

612
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,952
There it is.

613
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,398
Shh. Shh. You're okay.
It's gonna be okay.

614
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,439
I need to get that shield, Gwen. It's
the only way we'll get home. Trust me.

615
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,710
Be quiet. It's okay.
Stay there. It's okay.

616
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,469
Will!

617
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,031
Leave her alone!

618
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,952
Will!

619
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,272
Okay. You want the watch?
Yeah? Yeah?

620
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,032
All right. Trade? All right.
Watch for the shield. Okay?

621
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,118
All right.

622
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,716
Gwen, we got it.

623
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,749
We got it!

624
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,715
Will! I warned you!

625
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,270
Gwen, go home. I'll catch up.
Don't tell anybody about this, okay?

626
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,668
Okay, go home. Go.

627
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,308
You exhausted your powers.
You could have been killed.

628
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,995
I got the Sign, didn't I? On my own.
I didn't see any of you helping.

629
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,199
You were selfish and irresponsible.
Every day, the Dark is tightening its grip.

630
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,079
- Only you stand in its way.
- Yeah. Yeah, you keep telling me.

631
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,709
Will, Will, Will, please!
All right, I'm sorry. If you wish...

632
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,997
...to express yourself,
I'm sure that I can listen.

633
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,309
It's so... You know, and I'm like...

634
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,157
The whole thing's just, uhn!
You know?

635
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,272
Is that it?

636
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,513
- Yeah.
- Miss Greythorne said this is...

637
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,158
This is natural for someone your age.

638
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,799
What if I can't do this?

639
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,989
Trust that you can.

640
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,237
Even the smallest light
shines in the darkness.

641
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,792
Go on.

642
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,712
The height of my power approaches...

643
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,714
...yet still the boy collects,
and now holds three Signs.

644
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,915
You know what you must do.
But understand...

645
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,469
...you are not the only one
that I've enlisted.

646
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,792
So deliver on your promise
or I shall deliver on mine.

647
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,792
Seeker!

648
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,394
Witness my wrath!

649
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,439
Our Seeker has very little time...

650
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,158
...perhaps not enough.

651
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,192
Throw it on the back.
Leave it.

652
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,677
They're completely out of food!

653
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,558
There's none left!

654
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,271
We're gonna have to eat
whatever Mom's got in the freezer.

655
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,552
Come on.

656
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,231
- Max, you all right?
- You know, about your room...

657
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,991
...it'll be more than a couple weeks.

658
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,756
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Whatever.

659
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,913
"Whatever"?

660
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,796
I'm sick and tired of your attitude.

661
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,838
Saying things behind my back,
turning everyone against me...

662
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,672
...you think I don't see that?

663
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,752
Max. Max, what's going on?

664
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,638
You've got issues, Will.

665
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,397
You wanna sort them out?

666
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,039
Well, well. What do we have here, huh?
You sense a Sign?

667
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,158
- Is that what we're doing here, Seeker?
- You're getting weird.

668
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,993
- Dude, this isn't really you.
- Oh, really? It isn't?

669
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,752
Is this real enough for you?

670
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,070
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

671
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,673
Gather around.
Gather around.

672
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,308
For the main event.
For the main event.

673
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,471
We have the champion!

674
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,632
And challenging our champion today,
the challenger.

675
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,834
Ladies and gentlemen...

676
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,390
...fame, fortune and happiness
await you. Lay your...

677
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,709
Let the championship begin.
Where's the Sign?

678
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,958
Get him out! I want him out of here.

679
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,316
Put me down! Put me down!

680
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,234
We jumped through time.
You sense a Sign?

681
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,074
Give me the Signs.

682
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,357
Give me all the Signs.

683
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,109
I...

684
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,392
...hate to do this to my own brother...

685
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:30,429
...but you're not giving me any choice.
So I'm gonna count to 10.

686
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,034
- One.
- Max!

687
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,595
- It doesn't matter about college.
- Two.

688
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,228
- Three!
- That's why your stuff's in boxes.

689
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,311
- Because you're not going back.
- Four.

690
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,438
- Because you dropped out. So what?
- Five.

691
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,434
Mom and Dad will understand.

692
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,350
- Six.
- The Dark is using you, Max.

693
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,511
- Seven.
- It is using your fear.

694
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,229
You flunked some exams.
So what? Big deal.

695
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,391
- It's how you deal with it, Max.
- Eight.

696
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,028
You don't have to deal alone.
Your family loves you.

697
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,555
No. Nine.

698
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,392
Max...

699
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,236
...I hate to do this to my own brother.

700
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,429
The champion!

701
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,993
You all right?
- My head hurts.

702
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,109
- What happened?
- You fell.

703
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,960
Hey, uh, Dad?
- Yeah.

704
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,675
You got a sec?

705
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,355
Yeah. Come on in.

706
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,788
It won't be stealing.
We'll leave some money, eh?

707
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,678
Rather you will.

708
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:47,077
- A little wager, George. A flagon of ale.
Yeah.

709
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,670
Nice try, Mr. Dawson.

710
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,592
Dragons indeed.

711
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,275
Anyway, it's a shame to leave
the old place all quiet and Lonesome.

712
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,829
Off duty, gentlemen?

713
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,157
Very careless,
straying out at a time like this.

714
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,878
We're here for a wager, Rider.

715
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,317
We'll take you up on yours as well.

716
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,040
Oh, you Old Ones.

717
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,028
You're not scared of anything, are you?

718
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,078
Well, that's good.

719
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,312
That's going to make it so much easier.

720
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,158
<i>has declared a state of emergency.</i>

721
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,039
<i>Attempts are being made
to deliver essential supplies...</i>

722
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,111
<i>...to the most severely affected areas.</i>

723
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,751
<i>Experts believe the current conditions
will last for at least another week.</i>

724
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,117
You guys, Miss Greythorne
has invited everybody in the village...

725
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,077
...to come stay at the manor.

726
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,233
They have their own generator there,
their own food, fuel...

727
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,913
...which is more than we have.

728
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,038
That was the last of our soup
heated on the last of our gas.

729
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,754
Okay, that's it.
We pack our bags tonight.

730
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,832
- Tomorrow morning, we go.
What if the weatherman's wrong?

731
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,039
He is. The storm will peak in two days.
That's all we have.

732
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,074
If it doesn't get better by then...

733
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,555
...it never will.

734
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,591
Um... Just thinking out loud.

735
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,953
"The Light and the Dark. " Were you
working on this when Tom disappeared?

736
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,234
I should have been
caring for you boys.

737
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,753
Instead, I was...

738
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,396
My work. Well, I thought
I was onto something great.

739
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,348
A revelation.
It was just an obsession, though.

740
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,670
It was like I was being...

741
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,670
<i>Being pushed to unlock
this darkness. I couldnt't stop it.</i>

742
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,074
And I lost myself.

743
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,793
<i>And worse...</i>

744
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,548
...I lost Tom.

745
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,953
- It was my fault.
- Dad.

746
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,197
That wasn't your fault.

747
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,678
Max, come on!

748
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,872
No, no! Hey! Guys! Guys! No! Hey!

749
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,472
Let them go.
They'll be fine. Come on.

750
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,438
We have four Signs?
- Yes.

751
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,750
- The other two?
- Look, I'll find them, okay?

752
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,592
Will, tomorrow is what?

753
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,910
Will. Will. Tomorrow is the final day.

754
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,395
Yeah, I know.
But even if I find the fifth Sign...

755
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,630
...I have no idea how to find the sixth.

756
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,310
When I first saw you, I thought,
"No, a boy, not a warrior. "

757
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,553
I was wrong.
You've come a long way...

758
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,837
...both as the Seeker
and as Will Stanton.

759
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,515
I believe in you, Will.
You'll find what you need.

760
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,190
- Now, where are we strongest?
- The Great Hall.

761
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,511
- Lf the Dark reaches its peak, meet there.
- I can't leave my family.

762
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,958
The only way to help your family
is to defeat the Dark. It's our only hope.

763
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,077
Where's George?

764
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,274
Our enemy knows no mercy.

765
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:28,193
Your tricks can only delay.
And you have just trapped yourselves.

766
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,800
<i>experiencing a temporary calm...</i>

767
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,394
<i>...in what the Meteorological Office
describes as...</i>

768
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,949
<i>...the most ferocious storm
ever recorded.</i>

769
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,669
<i>Reports from around the world
say the worst is yet to come.</i>

770
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,478
<i>Arctic winds, bringing more snow...</i>

771
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,393
<i>...are expected to cause
disruptions in northern England...</i>

772
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,599
<i>...and further south to London
by tomorrow morning.</i>

773
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,191
Now with the darkness comes the cold.

774
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,433
<i>Give me the Signs, Will.</i>

775
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,878
<i>Give me the Signs, or I will
hurt those who are dear to you.</i>

776
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,389
<i>Leave us alone.</i>

777
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,949
<i>Do you want to ever
go home with them again?</i>

778
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,398
<i>Give me the Signs and they will live.</i>

779
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,991
<i>Give me the Signs, Will.</i>

780
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,394
<i>No.</i>

781
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,911
Gwen! Look out!

782
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,113
Hang on.

783
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,833
Come, child!

784
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,112
<i>Do you love your family?
Do you care about them?</i>

785
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,915
Give me the Signs
or I will choose for you.

786
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,794
Mary. Mary!

787
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,558
Look out.

788
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,671
- Help Dad!
- Boys, get under the stairs!

789
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,474
Get back!

790
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,755
The boy is more capable
than I thought.

791
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,596
Return to him. Bring me the Signs
and you will never age.

792
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,630
Are you all right?
Thank God you're safe.

793
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,074
What's going on?

794
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,230
Now let water finish
what ice has begun.

795
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,549
Stay together.

796
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,669
Stay together.

797
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,992
It's just water.

798
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,238
Will!

799
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,831
Come with me. You're not safe here.

800
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,992
You need to give me the Signs.

801
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,230
They're my responsibility.
I can handle them.

802
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,960
- Let me protect them.
- I don't think I can do that.

803
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,634
It's me, Will.

804
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,113
Maggie.

805
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,593
Do you believe what you said?

806
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,319
That we're connected?

807
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,355
Yeah.

808
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,757
I felt it too.

809
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,437
You need to give me the Signs
before it's too late.

810
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,352
You need to trust me.

811
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,513
Do you trust me?

812
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,276
Yeah, I trust you.

813
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,510
<i>Hurry, witch.</i>

814
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,114
<i>With another Sign, he will undo you.</i>

815
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,512
Give me the Signs.

816
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,548
- Aagh! Just give me the Signs!
- No!

817
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,238
<i>You have failed me for the last time.</i>

818
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,635
Agh! Give me the Signs!
No!

819
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,310
Give me the Signs!

820
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,354
Back off!

821
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,319
Help!
Hold on!

822
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,592
- I'm coming!
We're under the stairs!

823
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,318
Help, please! Help!

824
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,959
Grab Mr. Merriman's hands.

825
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,034
The Rider's reached full strength. But
he can't enter here unless we let him.

826
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,677
I still don't have the sixth Sign.

827
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,877
Keep the faith, Will.
You'll find it, I know you will.

828
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,837
No.

829
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,831
Will.
Will.

830
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,719
Will, let us in. Please, Will, let us in.

831
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,356
- Dad, is that you?
- Don't listen, Will.

832
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,431
It's your mother.
She's hurt real bad.

833
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,955
- Gwen, is that you?
Don't listen!

834
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,879
Open the door.
- Don't listen!

835
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,110
Help me, Will.
- Mom!

836
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,315
Mom!

837
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,873
Open this door, Will!

838
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,913
Don't open the door!

839
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,516
Don't open the door!

840
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:58,156
Help me. Open the door!

841
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,913
Thank you, Will.

842
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,110
Where are your guardians now?

843
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,952
Have they abandoned their Seeker?

844
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,119
Did you disappoint them, Will?

845
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,237
A thousand years of waiting
and what was there to show? Nothing!

846
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,073
Nothing but a boy who could not
do what was asked of him.

847
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,074
Generations of hope and promise,
all a waste.

848
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,716
I have something here
you might recognize.

849
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:10,468
Once before I made you an offer, Will.
Now here it is again.

850
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,995
Give me the Signs
and the boy will live.

851
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,118
I'm not afraid to die.

852
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,273
I'm not afraid to die!

853
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,997
Who says it's you?

854
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,631
- Tom?
Yes.

855
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,028
Poor little Tom.

856
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:32,150
The wrong twin.
My prisoner these last 14 years.

857
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,232
Imagine how he's missed
his dear twin brother.

858
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,318
Resist him, Will! You're Will Stanton.

859
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,471
You are the Seeker.

860
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,716
Give them to me.
No!

861
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,836
Then your time is at an end.

862
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,239
Say goodbye to little Tom.

863
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,236
No! Tom!

864
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,075
You're alone, boy.
You failed to find the sixth Sign.

865
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,913
And with only five,
you're no match for me.

866
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,634
You're a failure, Will.

867
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,638
<i>I believe in you, Will.</i>

868
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,348
<i>You'll find what you need.</i>

869
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,435
<i>A soul freely given
to unleash the power of the Light.</i>

870
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,869
It's me. My soul.

871
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,150
I am Will Stanton...

872
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,552
...the seventh son of a seventh son.

873
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,239
I have read the book.

874
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,639
I have walked through time.

875
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,474
I have gathered five Signs.

876
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,599
The sixth could not be found,
because it was not hidden from me.

877
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,709
I am the sixth Sign.

878
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,874
And I have restored...

879
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,233
...the power of the Light.

880
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,315
It's over, right?

881
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,592
It's never over.
But today is a good day.

882
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,997
George.

883
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,478
Mr. Dawson.

884
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,312
George.

885
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,272
I wanna go home.

886
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,112
I think you should.

887
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,872
There's someone
who wants to go with you.

888
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,873
Tom.

889
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,030
There's some people
I want you to meet.

890
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,038
Come on.

891
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,792
Will?

892
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,479
You did all right.

893
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,759
He might have shown some appreciation,
after all we've done for him.

894
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,753
He's only 14. It's a difficult age.

895
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,592
<i>John? John.</i>

896
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,237
Go ahead.

897
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,351
