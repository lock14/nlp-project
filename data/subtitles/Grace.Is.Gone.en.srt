1
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,160
Hi. You've reached Grace,

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,120
Stanley, Heidi, and Dawn.

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,080
We're not home right now,
but if you leave a message,

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,120
we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,000
Hi, everyone! It's Mom!

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,240
I just wanted to call

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,640
and tell you how much
I'm thinking of you.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,320
Stan, I guess
you're at work now.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,000
Have you had a chance
to go to that group thing yet?

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,320
I think it's a great idea.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,400
God, it's hot here.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,960
I'm not sure when I'm going
to be able to call again.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,360
It might be a few days.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,720
I just wanted to tell you
that I love you

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,080
and I miss you.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,200
Write me.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,960
Good morning.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,920
Let's huddle up.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,440
Put it in.

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
Come on, Agnes.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,280
All right, now give me an H!

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,200
- H!
- Give me an O!

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,160
- O!
- Give me an M!

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,120
- M!
- Give me an E!

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,280
- E!
- Give me an S!

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
- S!
- Give me a T!

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,520
- T!
- Give me an O-R-E!

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,480
O-R-E!

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,440
What's that spell?

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,400
Home Store!

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,600
- What's that spell?
- Home Store!

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,920
- Who's number 1?
- Customers!

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,320
- Who's number 1?
- Customers!

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,160
- Who's number 1?
- Customers!

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,120
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,240
Go get 'em.

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,560
And Charles knows that I don't...

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,880
I don't usually go
for that kind of thing.

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
But he's telling me

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
how hot I'm making him,

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,120
and, uh, I can...
I can even hear him.

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,720
He's... I can hear him.

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,280
You know, so we both...

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
we're... we're both getting into it,

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,480
getting really...

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,480
muttering and talking,

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,080
and I'm just about to scream,

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,680
and... and... and...
and then the phone goes dead.

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
It's pretty romantic, huh?

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,080
Oh, honey, don't worry.

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
Those won't be his last words.

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,920
You should consider yourself lucky.

54
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,920
Phone sex is nothing

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
compared to what Ron did to me

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,600
the night before he shipped.

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,240
I know, but it would
never be like that

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,200
with a woman.

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,960
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
Well, you know, I've never had
to make that kind of good-bye.

61
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,960
Well, why don't we ask Stanley?

62
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,680
His wife did.

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,880
Uh, well, Stan?

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,720
Grace and I had a nice time.

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
Well, what did you do?

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,640
We put the kids to bed, you know.

67
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,240
Then we watched Leno.

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,400
You didn't...

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,520
That's really none
of anybody's business.

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,480
I'm sorry. It's...

71
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Uh, I mean, it must
have been so hard.

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,560
No, no, no.
It wasn't hard.

73
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,800
I was proud to see her go.

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,880
Of course you were.

75
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,360
Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,360
- Of course you were.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,520
Yeah, we're all proud.

78
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,080
I just want them to come home.

79
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,120
When is Ron supposed
to come home?

80
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,960
January if his tour
doesn't get extended.

81
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,240
Well, don't hold your breath.

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
They always extend.

83
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
Welcome to the Army, honey,

84
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,880
and my prescription medicine cabinet.

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,720
Two bombs have gone off

86
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,840
in the capital today,

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,040
killing at least four people,

88
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,520
and there have also been reports

89
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,120
of skirmishes between gunmen...

90
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,920
What was that?

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,480
Nothing.

92
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,280
What were you watching?

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,880
Nothing.

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,160
Turn it back on.

95
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,200
W-What?

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,320
Not everyone is pleased

97
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,760
with the new order of things in
Baghdad.

98
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,880
Thousands today demonstrated in
front...

99
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm sorry, Dad.

100
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,640
You better be.

101
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,800
...the demonstration organized

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,720
by anti-occupation Shiites.

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,480
In a disturbing development
is Basra in Iraq's south,

104
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,640
the Iranians...

105
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,480
...raising new security concerns...

106
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,480
What's this I hear about you
falling asleep in school?

107
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,000
You know better than that.

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,120
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,640
We get plenty of sleep
here every night.

110
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,760
There's no excuse for you
to be falling asleep in school.

111
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
I know.

112
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm not going to have
to talk to you

113
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
about this again, am I?

114
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,240
I didn't hear you.

115
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,680
No.

116
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,360
Good.

117
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,400
I want you to go
to Mrs. Shimerhorn tomorrow.

118
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,640
I want you to apologize,

119
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,600
I want you to ask for extra work
to show for your disrespect.

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,280
- But, Dad...
- No buts.

121
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,280
Dad, she's going to have
her baby any day.

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,400
Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,440
And she's really grouchy right now.

124
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
Then you'd better ask her really nice.

125
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,360
Dad, l... I can't just go up to her...

126
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
...and ask her
for more work when l...

127
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
Shh!

128
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
Thank you.

129
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,480
There we go.
Good night.

130
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
All right now.

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,840
I love you.

132
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,400
Stanley Phillips?

133
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,680
Is your wife Grace Ann Phillips?

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,640
May we come inside, sir?

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,280
No.

136
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,200
Whatever you're gonna say, just say.

137
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,240
Mr. Phillips,
I regret to inform you,

138
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,400
on behalf of
the President of the United States,

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,880
that Sergeant Grace Ann Phillips

140
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,040
was killed at 2100 hours
on March 12.

141
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,280
I was in the shower.

142
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,480
Mr. Phillips,
may we come inside, sir?

143
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Mr. Phillips,
this is Chaplain Johnson.

144
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
He lives on base,

145
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,360
and he'll be available to you

146
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,760
and your children at any time.

147
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,760
Would you like to pray
with me, Mr. Phillips?

148
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,400
No.

149
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,680
Mr. Phillips, I'm going to need you

150
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,320
to sign this, please, sir.

151
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,040
It's just a form

152
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,520
stating you'll be at this address

153
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,440
for the next 45 days.

154
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Is there somebody
you'd like to call

155
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,320
while we wait here
with you, sir?

156
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,240
No. Don't wait.

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
Don't wait.

158
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
Are you sure?

159
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,800
Captain Douglas Tamlin will be
your casualty assistant officer.

160
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,000
He'll be stopping
by here later today

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,520
with more details

162
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,320
concerning your wife's death.

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,960
Mr. Phillips, any man
who's ever been a soldier

164
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,520
shares in your grief.

165
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,560
Sergeant Phillips was a brave soldier.

166
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
She died serving the country she loved.

167
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,840
Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley,

168
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,840
Heidi, and Dawn.

169
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,040
We're not home right now,

170
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,400
but if you leave a message,

171
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,440
we'll be back to you
as soon as possible.

172
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,040
Hey, Mr. Phillips. It's Rick.

173
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,680
At the Home Store?

174
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,640
Just wondering if
you're coming in to work today.

175
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,120
Okay. Thanks.

176
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
- Race you!
- Oh!

177
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,200
What's this?

178
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,720
Give me that.
Thank you.

179
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
Hi, girls.

180
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
What are you doing here?

181
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Where'd you get that?

182
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,160
Someone left a casserole.

183
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
You okay?

184
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,360
Don't eat that.

185
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,160
- Why not?
- Just don't.

186
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,000
Is something wrong?

187
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,760
Don't. Stop.

188
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,360
Stop. Stop, please.

189
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,320
Okay, girls, let's go
in the living room.

190
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,720
I want to talk to you.

191
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120
Girls.

192
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,160
Yeah, Dad?

193
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,400
Hey, who's hungry?
Who wants to go get something to eat?

194
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,280
- I do.
- It's only 4:00.

195
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,480
So what?

196
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,760
Shotgun!

197
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,240
You can't call shotgun
until you're outside.

198
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,360
Race you.

199
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,760
Dad?

200
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,640
Go. Go, go, go, both of you.

201
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,840
Go, go, go, go, go.

202
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,320
# Doot doo-doot #

203
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,360
# Hey, Dad, yeah #

204
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,800
# Hey, Dad, yeah #

205
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,720
# Shake your booty, no way #

206
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,040
# Shake your booty, okay #

207
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,160
# Jump jump #

208
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,560
- You go get a table...
- Okay.

209
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,920
...and we'll go to the arcade.

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,360
- All right.
- Bye, Dad.

211
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
Okay, girls, we're going right now.

212
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
- Dad...
- Come on.

213
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
We just got here.

214
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
We were just getting into it.

215
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,280
I don't care. Just come on.

216
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,120
Heidi, move.

217
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,160
Where are we going?

218
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,480
Where would you like to go?

219
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,560
I don't know.

220
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,520
How about you, Dawn?

221
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,680
Is there any place
you'd like to go?

222
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,160
Enchanted Gardens.

223
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,760
Don't be a moron, Dawn.

224
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm not. Daddy asked
where we wanted to go.

225
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
That's not what he meant.

226
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,480
You don't know.

227
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,760
Yes, I do.

228
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
I don't care. I want to.

229
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,400
Stop it.

230
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,360
Stop it.

231
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,760
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

232
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,120
Stop!

233
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,800
Oh, God.

234
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,840
Aah! Stop!

235
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,320
What if we did?

236
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,800
What?

237
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,240
What if we did right now

238
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,120
went to Enchanted Gardens?

239
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
What if we did?

240
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,840
What?

241
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,760
Go to Enchanted Gardens
right now?

242
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

243
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
Be quiet, be quiet.

244
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,800
Eww.

245
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,960
Huh? Would you like that?

246
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,440
We can't.

247
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,400
Is that's something
you'd like to do? Why not?

248
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,640
- Sit down, Dawn.
- No!

249
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,080
Girls, why not?

250
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,040
Dad... Dad...

251
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,200
We have school.

252
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,000
You can miss
a few days of school.

253
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,960
Yeah, Heidi.

254
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,920
- We can?
- Yeah.

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
Of course we can. Right, Dad?

256
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,960
- Sure. Why not?
- Yes!

257
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
What about your job?

258
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,360
Don't worry about my job.

259
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,640
Don't worry about his job.

260
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,160
Dad...

261
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,040
Huh? Well?

262
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,360
What about homework?

263
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,880
Don't worry about your homework.

264
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,160
Don't worry about our homework.

265
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,360
We can do... We can help you
with your homework.

266
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Dawn and I can
help you in the car.

267
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,200
Let's do it. Right now.

268
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,400
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

269
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
Of course he's serious.

270
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,240
Yeah. Why not? Let's go.

271
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,520
You got to get some fun
out of life, Heidi.

272
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,560
- Aah!
- You, too, Dawn.

273
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,960
- Let's do it!
- Let's go!

274
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,520
Let's do it! Do you guys
want to do it?

275
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,880
I do!

276
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,600
You party pooper!

277
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,920
Yes or no, Heidi, right now.

278
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,360
This is a one-time-only offer.

279
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,960
Enchanted Gardens right now.

280
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,960
- Right now, Heidi.
- Right now!

281
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,120
Do we have an atlas?

282
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,080
Let's do it!

283
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,080
Ahh!

284
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,920
Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley,

285
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,880
Heidi, and Dawn.

286
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,280
We're not home right now,

287
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
but if you leave a message,

288
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

289
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,040
Hey.

290
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,480
Just wanted to let you know
the girls and I are... okay.

291
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,840
We just decided to take a little trip.

292
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,960
We're having a really good time.

293
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,800
...could face fines

294
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,720
up to $300 under the new law.

295
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,120
There's a flood watch in
parts of Western Minnesota

296
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,440
through tomorrow evening.

297
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,000
Tonight should be cloudy
with rain showers likely.

298
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,200
Isolated thunders...

299
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,120
Good morning.

300
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,560
Good morning.

301
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,760
Where are we?

302
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,920
I'm not entirely sure.

303
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,720
We should call school

304
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,600
and tell them we're
going to be absent.

305
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Let's think of something
fun to do today.

306
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
Can you do that?

307
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,760
What's that?

308
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,800
What's that? What is that?

309
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,960
Supposed to be an answer
to my question?

310
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,920
Huh? Huh? No?

311
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,040
No.

312
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,240
Well, let's try that again.

313
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,960
Come on. Can we think
of something fun

314
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,320
that we want to do today?

315
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,480
No.

316
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,680
No? Why not?

317
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,120
We've talked about it
too much now.

318
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
So?

319
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,960
So now there's
too much pressure.

320
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,400
Too much pressure?

321
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,800
What are you doing?

322
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,520
You cannot just drive into this field.

323
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,240
Oh, yes, I can.

324
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,720
Dad, what
are you doing?

325
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm doing doughnuts.
What's it look like?

326
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,520
We're going to get in trouble.

327
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,200
- No, no, we're not.
- Watch for the birds.

328
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,320
No, the birds fly out of the way.

329
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,040
What the heck are we doing?

330
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,640
Hey! Good morning, Dawn!

331
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,600
Are we on a road?

332
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,560
Nope.

333
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,720
Cool!

334
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,920
Fun, isn't it?

335
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,920
Yeah!

336
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,760
I used to do this all the time

337
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,160
when I was a teenager.

338
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
Why?

339
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,120
Why? I don't know.
It's fun, isn't it?

340
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,960
Why would you do this?

341
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,440
I don't know. I guess
I just like peeling out.

342
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,040
I didn't put a ton of thought
into everything I did

343
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,680
when I was a kid, Heidi.

344
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,000
All right. Let's go.

345
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,240
Where are we going?

346
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,880
Ahh!

347
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,320
Whew!

348
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,760
- Dad?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,320
Are we really going
to Enchanted Gardens?

350
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,440
Of course we are. Why?

351
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,840
I just wanted to make sure.

352
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,440
Okay.

353
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,720
- Dad?
- Yeah.

354
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,880
Can we get a monkey?

355
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,840
No.

356
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,040
What if it's really little?

357
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,560
Like littler than a puppy.

358
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,360
Still no.

359
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,520
Can we get a pony?

360
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,480
No.

361
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,440
An iPod?

362
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,800
No.

363
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,320
- Dad?
- Yes, Dawn.

364
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
Can we get our ears pierced?

365
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,240
No. Not till you're 13.
You know the rules.

366
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,200
Dad?

367
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,160
Be quiet, Dawn.

368
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,280
What? Do I hear something?

369
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,360
- Dawn!
- I don't hear anything...

370
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,240
Dawn!

371
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,680
...at all, no, no.

372
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,640
Be quiet!

373
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,880
Girls, come on.
Straighten up.

374
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,160
I got a surprise for you.

375
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,280
What is it?

376
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,960
We're going to stop
and see Grandma.

377
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,080
I can get in around back.
Just wait here.

378
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,440
My lamp.

379
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,840
So you want to marry
my daughter.

380
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,320
I sure do. Boy!

381
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,520
Hey.

382
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,840
Hey, Uncle John.

383
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,600
What are you guys doing here?

384
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,240
Oh, hey, don't...
don't get too close.

385
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,720
I think I have bad breath.

386
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,360
New lamps for all!

387
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,120
Is your dad here?

388
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,280
Can I help you?

389
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,080
John, what are you doing here?

390
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,640
What are you doing here?

391
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,440
Trying to find a way in.

392
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,120
What, the front door
too obvious for you?

393
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,880
Open the door, man.

394
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,560
Hey, bro.

395
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,520
How are you, man?

396
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm good, man.

397
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,440
How you doing?

398
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,920
Come on in.

399
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,400
So what have you
been up to, John?

400
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,560
I'm studying to take the GRE.

401
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,520
Good. You going back to school?

402
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm thinking about it, yeah.

403
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,440
That's great. What for?

404
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,760
Law. Or medicine.
I haven't decided yet.

405
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,920
Oh.

406
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,360
That's great.

407
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,640
What's new with you?

408
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,360
Not much.

409
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
You all right?

410
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,040
What do you mean, am l...
l... I'm fine.

411
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,320
You're not upset?

412
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,160
About what?

413
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
Uh, I don't know.
I mean, where do I start?

414
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,920
The situation's such a mess.

415
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,560
The situation? What situation?

416
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,000
What situation?

417
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
I mean, it sounds like
a fucking mess over there.

418
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,960
Watch your language.

419
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,200
Sorry. Sorry.

420
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,000
You don't know what
you're talking about anyway.

421
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,520
Who does?
The administration?

422
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,040
I mean, they'll tell you
the sun comes out at midnight

423
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,040
if it serves their cause.

424
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,880
And how about that monkey boy
president of yours?

425
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,160
He's your president, too.

426
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,320
I didn't vote for him.

427
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,800
You didn't vote at all, did you?

428
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,160
That's... That's not the point.

429
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,600
Isn't it?

430
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,640
Just...

431
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,840
stop talking.

432
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,240
Let's not have that
conversation right now.

433
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,600
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

434
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,120
That's what your side's
all about, isn't it?

435
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,000
Censoring dissent?

436
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,680
Stop.

437
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,400
Why? I mean, we're just talking.

438
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,560
Are you afraid of talking?

439
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
No, I'm not afraid of that at all.

440
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,320
I just don't want to confuse the girls.
Is that all right?

441
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,840
I'm sure they're already confused.

442
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,880
I mean...

443
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,480
really, what do you
think about all this?

444
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,320
Do you have an opinion?

445
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,160
They think their mom's a hero,

446
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,280
and they think it's easy
to criticize the situation

447
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,160
when you're sitting
in your mom's living room

448
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,320
thinking about
going back to school...

449
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,120
maybe law, maybe med...
I don't know.

450
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,640
They think every one
of those privileged opinions

451
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,880
is a freedom that their mother
fights for daily

452
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,320
on your behalf.

453
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,040
That's what they think.

454
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,960
Well, it's... it's good to see

455
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,120
that you let them
think for themselves.

456
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,480
You girls hungry?

457
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,320
You think your dad
will buy us lunch?

458
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,840
It's 4:30, man.

459
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,880
You think your dad
will buy us dinner?

460
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,880
Want to buy Uncle John dinner?

461
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,240
You don't want to come?

462
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,920
No, I think I'm just
going to stay here and...

463
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,880
take a little cat nap.

464
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,600
You're bigger than
the last time I saw you.

465
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,520
How old are you now?

466
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,160
Dawn's 8. I'm 121/2.

467
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,400
Wow.

468
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,080
How old are you?

469
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,120
32.

470
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,080
Bet that sounds
pretty old to you, doesn't it?

471
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,200
Do you have a job?

472
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,160
Why? Are you hiring?

473
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
No.

474
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,240
Hey, how come you kids
are out of school?

475
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,800
Dad's taking us
to Enchanted Gardens.

476
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,720
- Why?
- For fun.

477
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,200
You think that place is fun?

478
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,480
What do you mean?

479
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,400
Nothing.

480
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Uncle John?

481
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,080
Yeah.

482
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,160
Why did Dad quit the Army?

483
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,400
He didn't quit.

484
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,400
What do you mean?

485
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
He had to leave
because of his eyes.

486
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,920
The Army's strict
about crap like that.

487
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,240
But weren't his eyes always bad?

488
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,480
Mm, more or less.

489
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,640
Well, if they're so strict,

490
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,000
how'd he get in the first place?

491
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
He didn't tell you?

492
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,360
Oh, Christ.

493
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,080
Ahem.

494
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,440
Well, if he didn't tell you,

495
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,280
he probably wouldn't
want me to, so...

496
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,880
All right, you promise not
to tell your dad if I tell you?

497
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,080
He cheated.

498
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,040
How?

499
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,360
He had a buddy take a picture

500
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,960
of the physical examiner's eye chart.

501
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,120
Memorized the letters.

502
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,200
What?

503
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,560
Your dad wanted
to serve so bad.

504
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,280
I mean, he really bought

505
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,960
all that patriotic "I Want You" crap.

506
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,920
Which was a good thing, too,

507
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,240
because he never would have
met your mother otherwise.

508
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,800
Well, how'd the Army
find out about his eyes?

509
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,400
Eventually they just gave him
a test he couldn't cheat on,

510
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,960
and that was that.

511
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,800
End of the dream.

512
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,880
Why don't you and Dad
like each other?

513
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Did your dad tell you that?

514
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,680
Well, we're just...
we're just different.

515
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,280
We have different opinions.

516
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,960
Doesn't mean we don't
like each other.

517
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,000
I mean, do you agree
with him about everything?

518
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,040
You shouldn't.

519
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,320
Why not?

520
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,200
Because it's important

521
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,240
that people have their own views

522
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,520
based on an understanding of facts.

523
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,720
Ahem.

524
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,720
But it's also important
not to trust the facts

525
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,040
because most of them are lies.

526
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,400
I don't understand.

527
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,320
Well, it basically comes down to a...

528
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,560
gut thing.

529
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,320
You just have to be
open to allowing

530
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,320
for a truth which differs
from your own opinions,

531
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,960
or else you'll never actually
see the truth at all.

532
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,600
What's that about?

533
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,560
It's her time of day.

534
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,680
What, it's... it's her time of day?

535
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,960
Mom and Dawn
both set their watches

536
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,680
at the same time every day.

537
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,880
That way, they know

538
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,560
that they're both
thinking of each other

539
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,680
at the same moment.

540
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,960
Girls?

541
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah?

542
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah?

543
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,760
Do you...

544
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,480
want to play tag?

545
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,600
Sure.

546
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,920
That's good because...

547
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
you know why?

548
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Why?

549
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,640
Because, uh, you're it.

550
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,600
You're it.

551
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

552
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,280
You're it. Time out.

553
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,680
What do you mean time out?

554
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,120
You can't call time out.

555
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,840
That is so lame.
You can't just...

556
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,240
All right. I'm just going to read the paper
and find out what's going...

557
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,480
Time in.

558
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,640
You know, I mean,
it's so typical.

559
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,200
I'm the victim of this kind
of thing every single day,

560
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,320
and you know why?

561
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,800
It's because
I'm an honest guy,

562
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,360
and I have to pay for it.

563
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,480
Mm-hmm.

564
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,280
- Ha!
- Aah!

565
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,720
Hey, the phone's ringing.
Open up.

566
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,920
Hello.

567
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Yeah, this is John.

568
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,160
Oh, hey, Mary.

569
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,880
What the hell
are you doing, man?

570
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,320
What's wrong?
Where are the girls?

571
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,720
The girls are fine.

572
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,680
Stan, I just talked to Mary.

573
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,920
I know what's going on.

574
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,800
Do the girls know?

575
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,600
No.

576
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,240
That's good.
Don't tell them yet.

577
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,600
We got to go.
We got to go.

578
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,760
We got to go.

579
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,600
Stan, what are you doing to them?

580
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,240
I'm taking them on a trip.

581
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,000
Just stay out of it.

582
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,160
Stay out of it?

583
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,920
You're the one
who brought me into it.

584
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,160
I didn't bring you into anything.

585
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,480
You were just here. I didn't plan that.

586
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,920
Do you really think

587
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,360
that... that... that taking
them to an amusement park

588
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
is going to help them get
over losing their mother?

589
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,880
- Just stay out of it.
- You're going to screw those girls up.

590
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,040
Is that what you want to do?

591
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
- Get out of my way.
- They'll never forgive you.

592
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,160
Get out of my way!

593
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,680
Nobody asked you!
Do you understand?

594
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,040
I got to go.

595
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,640
Don't you want to wait for Mom?

596
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
No.

597
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,440
We're on a schedule.

598
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,040
Stan...

599
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,760
please stay and wait for Mom

600
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,800
because we can talk
it all out together.

601
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,240
No.

602
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,240
It was nice seeing you
again, John.

603
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,520
I got to go. Okay?

604
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,360
Girls!

605
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,160
Girls, get your stuff together!

606
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,360
Girls!

607
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,400
- Come on. Get up.
- Aah!

608
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,480
Okay. Come on.
Get up. We got to go.

609
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,440
- Why?
- What?

610
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,840
- We got to go right now.
- Why?

611
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,040
I thought we were going
to see Grandma.

612
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,560
We're going
to talk to her later.

613
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,520
- Get in the goddamn car.
- Dad.

614
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,000
What about Uncle John?

615
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,480
What about Uncle John?

616
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,800
We didn't get to say good-bye.

617
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,120
You'll see him again.

618
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,040
I'm bored. Let's drive into a field.

619
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,160
No, Dawn. We already did that.

620
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,120
Why not?

621
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,240
Because we already did it.

622
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,240
So?

623
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,800
So we ought to do something else.

624
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,040
Seems like we've been driving forever.

625
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,600
Well, it's going to be forever
with that attitude, isn't it?

626
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,920
You're kind of quiet back there, Heidi.

627
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,640
What are you doing?

628
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,000
Just working on my report.

629
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,000
What's your report about?

630
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,800
Mom.

631
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,040
Whose idea was that?

632
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,280
Mrs. Shimerhorn's.

633
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,320
Mrs. Shimerhorn's.

634
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,680
Why does she think
that's a good idea?

635
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,720
Because she thought
it would help or something.

636
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,960
Help with what?
What do you need help with?

637
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,440
I don't know. You know how
people get when Mom goes away.

638
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,720
No. How do they get?

639
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,640
Like serious.

640
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,000
I call bed!

641
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,960
I call bed.

642
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,440
Not if I get there first!

643
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,360
Oh!

644
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,720
Dad, this is so fun.
You want to try?

645
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,120
I'm going to go get a cot.

646
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,120
Okely-dokely, artichokey.

647
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,920
I have to poop.

648
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
You don't have to tell me
things like that.

649
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,280
There's free shampoo
and a sewing kit!

650
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,240
Hey, what are bath salts?

651
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Noble Elementary.

652
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,400
Mrs. Fissel?

653
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,360
Yes.

654
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,960
Hi. This is Heidi Phillips.

655
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,320
I was calling to tell you

656
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,640
that my sister and I
are going to be missing

657
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,240
a couple of school days this week.

658
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,520
Oh, that's okay, Heidi.

659
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,640
We're not sick or anything.

660
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,120
We're just taking a trip.

661
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,320
For fun?

662
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,480
Oh, Heidi, I understand.

663
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,440
I was wondering if you
could have our teachers

664
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,680
e-mail our dad our homework.

665
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,200
Of course, sweetheart.

666
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,240
Is Mrs. Shimerhorn there?

667
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,040
Mrs. Shimerhorn is in the hospital.

668
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,160
Why?

669
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,960
She's actually having her baby.

670
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,360
Oh, she is?

671
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,760
Yeah, and Miss Abrams
will be taking over for her

672
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,080
for the rest of the year.

673
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Oh. Can you ask her
if it's all right

674
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,040
if my report is late?

675
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,360
Mrs. Shimerhorn said
it had to be done by Monday.

676
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,280
I'm sure it's fine, Heidi, okay?

677
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,440
I'll see you soon.

678
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,400
Okay.

679
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,400
Bye, sweetheart.

680
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,360
Bye.

681
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,840
Who was that?

682
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,320
Mrs. Fissel.

683
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,960
What did you call her for?

684
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,840
I was trying
to get our homework.

685
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,360
Heidi!

686
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,200
She was really nice.

687
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,840
That's cool.

688
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,800
Bang-bang!
Choo-choo train!

689
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,280
Come on, Heidi, do your thing!

690
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,400
Say woo!

691
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,480
What?

692
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,720
Got you.

693
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,120
Marco.

694
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,960
Polo!

695
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,920
Marco.

696
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,880
Polo.

697
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,160
- Marco.
- Polo.

698
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,560
- Marco.
- Polo.

699
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,400
Count how long
I can do it.

700
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,400
Okay.

701
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,120
Yeah.

702
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,760
Dad, watch this.

703
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,240
That's good.

704
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,480
This is a long time.

705
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,440
It's like five days.

706
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,000
Aah!

707
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,960
That was good.

708
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,800
Yaah!

709
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,640
- That was about, like,
- How long?

710
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,080
I don't know, two minutes?

711
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,080
Ha!

712
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,200
You weren't counting.

713
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,640
I was close.

714
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,560
Dad?

715
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,840
Yeah.

716
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,080
What's going on?

717
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,640
What do you mean?

718
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,360
Why are we doing all this?

719
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,320
I just wanted to give you girls
a surprise, you know?

720
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,520
Take you on a trip.

721
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,320
You didn't go to work
yesterday, did you?

722
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,760
No, I didn't go to work.

723
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,920
Were you fired?

724
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,080
You know Mom's
going to be really mad

725
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,480
if you lose your job, right?

726
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,760
I didn't lose my job, Heidi.

727
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,480
Okay?

728
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,160
But if you were going to,
you'd tell us, right?

729
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,600
Yeah, I would tell you.

730
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,360
I'm going to go to sleep.

731
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,720
What are you doing?

732
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,440
Nothing.

733
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
You're not old enough to smoke.

734
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,760
I'm 18.

735
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,560
No, you're not.

736
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,840
Want to bet?

737
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,800
I saw you with your mom at the pool.

738
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,600
That wasn't my mom.

739
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,640
Oh, yeah? Who was it?

740
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,960
It was an autistic woman.

741
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,280
I take care of her for money.

742
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,520
You shouldn't lie.

743
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,560
I'm not lying. It's the truth.

744
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,840
How old are you?

745
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,640
18.

746
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,560
Want one?

747
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,800
Sure.

748
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,400
Heidi?

749
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,840
Heidi?

750
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,160
Heidi!

751
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,400
Why are you coughing?

752
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,160
You haven't even smoked it yet.

753
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,280
I knew you'd never smoked before.

754
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,560
Better go home, boy.

755
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,760
Get your stuff.
We're going right now.

756
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,360
- Now?
- Yeah. Right now.

757
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,520
It's in the middle of the night.

758
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,480
You arguing with me? Move.

759
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,600
Jesus, Heidi,

760
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,840
you can't just walk around

761
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,680
in the middle of the night
by yourself.

762
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,440
You could have been hurt,
kidnapped, who knows?

763
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,520
I said I was sorry.

764
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,880
All right, but what
I want to know is

765
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,280
what the hell you were doing
out there in the first place.

766
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,200
Make me leave your sister alone

767
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,640
in... some hotel.

768
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,160
I couldn't sleep.

769
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,840
You couldn't sleep? Why not?

770
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,760
Why do you think?

771
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,280
Is that why you're falling
asleep in class?

772
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,880
Oh, boy.

773
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,520
What do you do every night?

774
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,480
I don't know.

775
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,960
Walk around.

776
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,840
I went to a support group
the other day.

777
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,120
What?

778
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,360
You know, the one they got
at Debbie Sager's house.

779
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,880
For military wives.

780
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,800
I stopped by there the other day.

781
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,160
Isn't that weird?

782
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,080
What did you talk about?

783
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
Uh-uh. No.

784
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,760
I didn't.

785
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,560
Did it help?

786
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,080
I don't know.

787
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,920
I don't think it did.

788
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,800
Will you do me a favor
if you can't sleep?

789
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,720
Um, will you wake me up?

790
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,440
Why?

791
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,120
So I can talk to you.

792
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,120
Really?

793
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,240
Yeah.

794
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,120
You'd do that?

795
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,160
Yes, I would do that.

796
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,200
Yes.

797
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,720
You still want to try it?

798
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,840
With you?

799
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,720
Yeah. I'd rather
you do it with me

800
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,160
than some punk kid.

801
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,440
Well? What's it going to be?

802
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,160
Sure.

803
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,320
Have you ever done this before?

804
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,960
No comment.

805
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,360
Do you want one,
or should we split one?

806
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,800
Let's split one.

807
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,320
Good idea.

808
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,680
Good one.

809
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,520
Oh, are you okay?

810
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,480
Yeah.

811
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,080
Are you sure?

812
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,680
Yeah, I'm fine.

813
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,640
Okay.

814
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,080
Maybe we should stop, right?

815
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,640
I'm going to go get some water.

816
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,600
You stay here, okay?

817
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,960
# The world could fall apart #

818
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,440
# But you're my heart, my dear #

819
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,280
# I will sing this song #

820
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,840
# Till we are gone, my dear #

821
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,680
# How do I keep you
from losing your way? #

822
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,800
# Hope you'll go out #

823
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,120
# And you'll come back some day #

824
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,720
# But love is not enough #

825
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,680
# This I know #

826
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,160
Stay together.
I'll be right back.

827
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,320
- I just got to make a phone call.
- Where are you going?

828
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,320
I'll meet you by the dresses.

829
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,240
Hey.

830
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,120
Hey, Dad.

831
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,080
What are those?

832
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,280
Earrings.

833
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,800
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

834
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,240
You said we could get
anything we wanted.

835
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,120
You know the rules.
Not until you're 13.

836
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,480
I'm almost 13.

837
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,120
And I'm 8.

838
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,080
This is something
you really want to do right now?

839
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,080
Yes.

840
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,600
All right. Let's do it.

841
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,640
Okay!

842
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,600
Really?

843
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,640
Yeah.

844
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,080
Is it going to hurt?

845
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,280
You won't even feel
a thing, I promise.

846
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,440
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

847
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,160
Did it hurt?

848
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,280
No.

849
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,720
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

850
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,760
That's okay.

851
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,040
Is that it?

852
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,880
That's it. Want to see?

853
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,160
Looks good, Bear.
You're all grown up.

854
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,440
- You next?
- Yeah.

855
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,040
1, 2, 3.

856
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,920
Is that all right?

857
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,760
Ooh.

858
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,520
I just got my ears pierced.

859
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,680
That's nice, sweetie.

860
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,320
That looks good.

861
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,240
This one's nice, too.

862
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,520
Did it hurt?

863
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,600
A little.

864
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,800
A little bit?

865
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,560
You did it.

866
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,080
Where's Dawn?

867
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,960
Find her. How much
do I owe you?

868
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,240
Oh. 32.50.

869
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,720
- Dawn?
- Thank you so much.

870
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,520
Dawn!

871
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,520
Dawn?

872
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,600
Dawn?

873
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
Dawn!

874
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,240
Bear, where are you?

875
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,440
Dawn! Bear!

876
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,080
Dawn Amber Phillips!

877
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,280
See if she's over there.

878
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,880
Bear.

879
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,080
Dawn, honey, what are you
doing in there?

880
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,040
Dawn, are you all right?

881
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,960
Dawn.

882
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,040
Anybody home?

883
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,160
Come in.

884
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,960
Hey.

885
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,160
Hey.

886
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,560
This is a nice place.

887
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,520
This really is.

888
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,040
You decorate it yourself?

889
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,000
No.

890
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,760
Well, it's really, really nice.

891
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,560
It's a nice little house.

892
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,120
Nice walls, nice... nice roof.

893
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,440
Phone.

894
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,360
I could see a nice little
happy family living here.

895
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,560
Yeah.

896
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,400
You miss home.

897
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,680
Yeah.

898
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,080
I miss Mom, too.

899
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,160
You know, I was thinking.

900
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,480
Maybe this would be a good thing

901
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,480
to get for the house.

902
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,640
You could put it up

903
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,160
in you and your sister's room.

904
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,080
Would you like that?

905
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,240
Mm-hmm.

906
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,040
I love you, Dad.

907
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,160
I love you, too, Bear.

908
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,840
Come here.

909
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,280
Dad?

910
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,560
Yeah.

911
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,480
You smell.

912
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,280
I think I like this one.

913
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,280
Try it.

914
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,840
Looks pretty nice.

915
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,480
Hey, Dad.

916
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,440
Yeah.

917
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,080
What do you do at work all day?

918
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,640
I sell shit.

919
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,600
Dad.

920
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,600
I'm sorry.

921
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,560
I sell stuff.

922
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,760
You know what I do.

923
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,680
I sell stuff at Home Store.

924
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
Come on. Give me an H.

925
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,840
O.

926
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,360
Give me an O.

927
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,320
O.

928
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,800
- Give me an M.
- M.

929
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,880
- Give me an E.
- E.

930
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,840
Give me an S.

931
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,800
- J.
- S.

932
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,200
- Give me a T.
- Q.

933
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,600
Give me an O-R-E.

934
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,560
O-R-E.

935
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,840
What's that spell?

936
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,600
Nothing.

937
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,200
You're right about that.

938
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,400
#...hold you in my arms #

939
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,760
# It scares me #

940
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,240
# Just to think that
something so beautiful #

941
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,680
# Could just come apart in my hands #

942
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,200
# I've always been chasin' rainbows #

943
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,360
How are you feeling, excited?

944
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,800
You getting excited?

945
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,880
Yeah.

946
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,400
Good.

947
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,600
How are you feeling?

948
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,920
I'm good.

949
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,400
Dad?

950
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,800
Hmm?

951
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
Do you ever think

952
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,120
that Mom should have stayed home?

953
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,760
All the time.

954
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,720
Why did she have to go?

955
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,320
She was doing her duty,
Heidi, you know that.

956
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,680
I know, but what exactly
does that mean?

957
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,960
We've talked about this.

958
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,720
We have people all over the world

959
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,480
looking out for our safety.

960
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,960
When they discover a threat,

961
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,440
they have to act on it.

962
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,200
That's the way the world is.

963
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,440
On the news they're saying

964
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,240
that we went to war
with the wrong people,

965
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,000
that it was all a lie.

966
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,160
Well, you can't always believe

967
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,360
everything you hear
on television, can you?

968
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,240
Sometimes you just got to trust

969
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,600
that you're doing the right thing.

970
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,040
We got to believe...

971
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,680
Well, what if you can't?

972
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,360
Then we're all lost.

973
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,080
Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley,

974
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,240
Heidi, and Dawn.

975
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,440
We're not home right now,

976
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,760
but if you leave a message,

977
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,800
we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

978
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,240
Hey. It's Stanley and the girls.

979
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,920
I just wanted to hear
your voice on the machine

980
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,960
and tell you that we're all right.

981
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,720
We're in Florida.

982
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,920
I told you we were
going to Florida, right?

983
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,200
Taking the girls on a little trip.

984
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,120
Anyway, do you
remember that, uh...

985
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,080
I was thinking that when we...

986
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,360
when we came down here
before you shipped out,

987
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,280
and I just...
I wanted to apologize

988
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,200
because, uh...

989
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,240
because I was so angry back then,

990
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,160
and, uh, I just wanted to let you know

991
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,440
I was thinking that...

992
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,840
that the reason I was so angry

993
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,640
was because I was ashamed...

994
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,040
that it was you
who was going and not me.

995
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,440
We would have been
better off if it was me.

996
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,680
The girls would have
been better off.

997
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,600
And I made such a fucking
mess out of this thing.

998
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,520
Grace, I'm such a mess.

999
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,320
l... I don't...

1000
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,520
know how to talk to these girls.

1001
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,960
I haven't even told them.

1002
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,800
So you got to tell me
what to do... Grace.

1003
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,320
Please, God, tell me what to do.

1004
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,960
So how do I say it?

1005
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,840
You got to tell me what to do.

1006
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,400
Who were you talking to?

1007
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,880
School.

1008
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,400
Mrs. Shimerhorn.

1009
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,440
Mrs. Shimerhorn?

1010
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,840
She said everything's
going to be fine

1011
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,840
but we got to get that report in

1012
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,280
and do a couple
of makeup assignments,

1013
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,640
but, uh, to enjoy the trip.

1014
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,800
So let's go.

1015
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,840
Come on.

1016
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,880
Load up!

1017
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,280
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1018
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,320
- Are we there yet?
- Mm-mmm.

1019
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,880
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1020
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,160
- Are we there yet?
- Mm.

1021
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,400
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1022
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,600
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1023
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,600
Are we there yet?

1024
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,560
No.

1025
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,720
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1026
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,840
Are we there yet?

1027
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,880
No!

1028
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,080
Are we there yet?

1029
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,920
How about now?

1030
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,520
Oh, it's right there!

1031
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,560
It's right there!
Oh, my gosh, Dad!

1032
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,600
Step on it, old man!

1033
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,200
There it is, Heidi!

1034
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,800
It's right there!

1035
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,000
What ride do you
want to go on first?

1036
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,720
Mission accomplished.

1037
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,400
I wonder if they have a TV there.

1038
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,080
They probably do.

1039
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,560
It's all yours.
Take your pick.

1040
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,520
Welcome to the Enchanted Hotel.

1041
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,440
Enchanted Gardens!

1042
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,400
Enchanted Gardens!

1043
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,480
Enchanted Gardens!

1044
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,760
All right, girls.

1045
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,680
Uh, just don't stay up
all night, okay?

1046
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,120
- Okay, Dad.
- Because we got to get...

1047
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,360
We got to get some sleep

1048
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,960
because we've got
a big day tomorrow, okay?

1049
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,080
Okay.

1050
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,080
Big day.

1051
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,200
Let's stay up all night.

1052
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,840
Okay.

1053
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,080
"We can, we must,

1054
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,000
"and we will see it
through to completion

1055
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,480
"the mission for which
these young Americans

1056
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,440
"and their families have sacrificed,

1057
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,800
"carrying with us the memory

1058
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,520
"of those who have lost their lives

1059

"America has learned
some important lessons,

01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,120
"and one is that weakness
is provocative.

1066
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,720
"It tempts aggression.

1067
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,040
That appeasement is..."

1068
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,760
Hey. It's Stanley and the girls.

1069
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,640
I just wanted to hear
your voice on the machine

1070
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,600
and tell you that we're all right.

1071
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,280
We're in Florida.

1072
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,160
I told you we were
going to Florida, right?

1073
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,440
Taking the girls on a little trip.

1074
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,920
Anyway, do you remember that, uh...

1075
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,440
I was thinking that when we...

1076
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,600
when we came down here
before you shipped out,

1077
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,840
and I just thought
I wanted to apologize

1078
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,320

and, uh, I just
wanted to let you know

1081

I was thinking that...

1082
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,160
that the reason
I was so angry

1083
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,800
was because I was ashamed...

1084
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,760
- Hey.
- Hey.

1085
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,840
You look like you're ready to go.

1086
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,600
I am.

1087
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,120
Oh, that dress looks pretty.

1088
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,080
Thanks.

1089
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,040
Where's your sister?

1090
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,560
Outside.

1091
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,240
Outside doing what?

1092
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,720
I don't know.
Some Heidi thing.

1093
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,480
Oh, right.

1094
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,920
Ooh.

1095
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,240
Okay.

1096
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,680
What are you doing
out here all by yourself?

1097
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,200
You all right, sweetheart?

1098
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,960
Yeah. How are you?

1099
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,160
Me? I'm just fine.

1100
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,880
Just fine.

1101
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,440
Slept like a rock,

1102
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,840
which is good.

1103
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,120
You know your sister's
just about ready to burst,

1104
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,600
she's so excited.

1105
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,280
What do you think?
You want to get going?

1106
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,760
Sure. Sure.

1107
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,040
Dad?

1108
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,280
Yeah.

1109
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,840
Nothing.

1110
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,160
Have an enchanted day.

1111
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,440
This way...

1112
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,880
or this way?

1113
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,040
Aah!

1114
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,760
Aah!

1115
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:05,920
Aah!

1116
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,760
Do you want this balloon?

1117
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,880
Yeah. I like blue.

1118
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,280
I don't know.
This is kind of...

1119
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,400
This is a powerful balloon.

1120
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,280
I don't know if I
should let you hold it.

1121
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,240
Whoa!
Ha ha ha!

1122
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,320
That's a big balloon.

1123
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,720
Heidi, Heidi,
hold your sister.

1124
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,840
Hold your sister down.

1125
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,800
Hold her. Hold her.

1126
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,280
The wind's going
to take her away.

1127
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,320
What do you want to do now?

1128
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,920
Let's go.

1129
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,720
Yeah.

1130
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,640
You want to leave?

1131
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,280
I did everything
I wanted to do.

1132
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,520
Okay.

1133
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,720
Come on.

1134
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,600
Why aren't we on the highway?

1135
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,600
Let's get out of the car.

1136
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,920
Sit down.

1137
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,560
I need to tell you something...

1138
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,560
and it's something I should
have told you a lot earlier.

1139
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,480
You know your mother and I
love you very, very, very much.

1140
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,520
Dawn.

1141
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,040
Yeah.

1142
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,040
Nothing's ever
going to change that.

1143
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,640
Ever.

1144
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,280
Do you remember
when we talked about things

1145
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,160
that could happen
while she was away?

1146
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,480
Well, your mother was hurt.

1147
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,040
She was hurt real bad.

1148
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,560
Where is she?

1149
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,440
She was hurt so bad,
they couldn't fix her.

1150
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,680
She's just hurt, right?

1151
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,840
Dad.

1152
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,800
She's just hurt.

1153
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,760
Where is she?

1154
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,000
It's okay, Dawn.

1155
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,600
We'll take care of her.
She's just hurt.

1156
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,440
Your mom is a soldier,

1157
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,680
and soldiers sometimes get hurt,

1158
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,240
and sometimes they even...

1159
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,600
die in battle.

1160
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,320
And that's what happened.

1161
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,720
Grace Ann Phillips

1162
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,160
was born in Newport, Indiana,
on October 3, 1971.

1163
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,960
She was a happy child

1164
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,360
who loved spending time outdoors.

1165
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,080
Once she even spent
an entire summer

1166
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,040
sleeping in a refrigerator box

1167
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,880
in her mother's backyard.

1168
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,720
She waterproofed it
with garbage bags

1169
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,120
so she could sleep in it
even when it rained.

1170
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,600
Grace was a brave woman.

1171
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,080
She enlisted in the Army
right out of high school.

1172
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,560
She met my father, Stanley Phillips,

1173
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,720
at boot camp
in Fort Knox, Kentucky,

1174
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,840
later that summer.

1175
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,880
They married after training was over.

1176
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,920
My father says that, to this day,

1177
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,760
he's still surprised Mom said yes,

1178
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,360
which is funny
because Mom used to tell

1179
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,000
my sister and me
she was worried

1180
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,400
he was never going
to ask the big question.

1181
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,560
Grace and Stanley loved
each other very much.

1182
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,240
They were best friends.

1183
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,760
Anyone who knew Grace

1184
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,680
knows she was a special person.

1185
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,760
She was kind, generous, and funny.

1186
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,360
She had a loud, silly laugh

1187
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,440
you could hear

1188
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,000
even when you were
in the next room.

1189
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,240
And she could sing
better than anyone.

1190
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,520
We'll miss her very much,

1191
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,440
but we promise
to always think of you

1192
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,080
when we laugh, wake up,

1193
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,600
fall asleep,

1194
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,320
and look at the ocean.

1195
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,800
I promise to keep your memory
with us forever.

1196
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,160
Is it time?

1197
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,040
Not yet.

1198
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,080
Okay, get ready.

1199
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,880
# Can't find all the words yet #

1200
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:12,160
# It's still not the time yet #

1201
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:16,480
# And my mind can't think of anything
#

1202
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,240
# It only sees you #

1203
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,640
# You know I am trying #

1204
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,680
# God knows I am trying #

1205
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:40,200
# And why does the wind
keep shouting out? #

1206
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:44,840
# It's still not over #

1207
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:52,520
# I keep on trying #

1208
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:59,000
# I think I'm learning #

1209
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,680
# To live in hearts #

1210
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,800
# You leave behind #

1211
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:11,080
# Is not to die, Grace #

1212
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,800
# And find the right place #

1213
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,720
# Is there a right place #

1214
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,760
# Where I can make it
all make sense somehow #

1215
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:37,400
# And face tomorrow? #

1216
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:44,600
# I keep on trying #

1217
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:51,080
# I think I'm learning #

1218
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,920
# To live in hearts #

1219
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,160
# You leave behind #

1220
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,920
# Is not to die, Grace #

1221
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:10,280
# The world go round some #

1222
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:15,080
# We move along some #

1223
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,120
# To live in hearts #

1224
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,080
# Of theirs and mine #

1225
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:28,440
# Is not to die #

1226
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,560
# Grace #
