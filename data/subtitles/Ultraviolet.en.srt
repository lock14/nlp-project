00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,810
Hello. My name is Violet.

3
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,400
And I was born into a world you

4
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
may not understand.

5
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,000
Coming up. Holding air speed.

6
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,689
Echo: altitude forward, and lateral direct.

7
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:50,689
Numbers falling fast from here.

8
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:51,800
On my mark.

9
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,300
3...2...1...

10
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Mark.

11
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,900
Hard Lock -- engaged.

12
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,819
Valves -- primary and secondary.

13
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,319
Amazden pressure breach.

14
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,409
Amazden

15
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,511
Freeze.

16
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,521
It's a trap.
Stay where you are. Don't move.

17
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,949
All hands down. All clear sir.

18
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,088
Touch nothing.

19
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:37,187
Obviously.

20
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,997
Hemophages. No surprise.

21
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,490
Flat-space technology.

22
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,247
Dimension compressing.

23
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,968
Very rare.

24
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,170
It's odd.

25
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:59,088
What was their exit strategy?

26
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:01,687
How did they expect to transport
the blood out of here?

27
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,610
Unless there was no exit strategy.

28
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:04,850
Then what's the point?

29
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,670
Well -- what if they didn't come
to take the blood out?

30
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,968
What if they came to infect it?

31
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,170
My God.

32
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,269
Ross.

33
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,350
Poor bastard.

34
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:27,610
Yes. I was born into a world you may find
hard to understand.

35
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,230
The trouble began when an American
weapons lab discovered

36
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,901
an obscure virus that had
been around for centuries.

37
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,290
They tried to modify it, to create
faster and stronger soldiers.

38
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:41,204
But instead, they created a more contagious
form of the disease.

39
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,550
A strain called HGV.

40
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,329
Hema Gophagic Virus.
And that's when the disease got out.

41
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,428
Everything changed.

42
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:53,649
As previous ages were defined by terrorism

43
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:57,509
this one was defined by fear of disease.

44
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,615
The medical establishment took it upon itself
to protect its public.

45
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:05,050
At first, requiring victims to wear
identifying armbands

46
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,809
and rounding them up in special camps
and facilities.

47
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:10,569
Until finally

48
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,475
people just stopped hearing from them.

49
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:16,449
The trouble began for me
the day I learned I was pregnant.

50
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,187
The same day I lost my husband

51
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,627
my future, my life.

52
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,569
I contracted the disease and lost my baby.

53
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,408
With those few on the outside
I formed a resistance.

54
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,247
Went underground --
and began fighting back.

55
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,389
And so began the blood wars.

56
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:44,170
And now, the leader of the militant medical
establishment, running this phobic world

57
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:47,699
Is Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxis.

58
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:50,334
Vice-Cardinal, as you know, our campaign

59
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,889
against the hemophages
has been highly effective.

60
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,802
We've managed to eradicate
almost all of them. But sir,

61
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:58,769
the few that are left have
proven incredibly determined.

62
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,088
Terrorist attacks are at
their highest level ever.

63
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,446
It's not because they're determined

64
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,928
it's because they're desperate.

65
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:09,889
Because they know we're on the verge
of wiping them out completely.

66
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,218
For the last 10 years,
in partnership with laboratories

67
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:14,569
for latter-day defence

68
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,601
I've overseen the development of a weapon

69
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,127
that can locate and kill
every hemophage on the planet

70
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,730
in a matter of days.
Is there an E.T.A. sir?

71
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,829
Now.

72
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,781
A courier is retrieving it to
bring here to the Arch-ministry

73
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,161
as we speak

74
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:55,528
XPD-154: Clearance Classified Courier.

75
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,661
I'm expected.

76
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,809
Reverse-engineered DNA
identification: in process.

77
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:04,615
Remove your head covering.

78
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,192
Remove your eye covering.

79
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,907
Preliminary verification: substantiated.

80
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:47,787
Please.

81
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,105
Have a seat.

82
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,169
Mind if I ask what's on the menu?

83
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,769
The usual:

84
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:16,408
Retinal testing to detect the presence of
existence of contacts or dives.

85
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:19,049
Metabolic sensing to make certain your
metabolism is

86
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,588
within human range.
Pulse.

87
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:23,008
Respiration.

88
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,424
Just have to make sure you're -- human.

89
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,317
If you really were a hemophage

90
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,153
we would have already detected

91
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,821
tissue repair at a micro-cellular level.

92
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,567
So

93
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:01,086
what would happen if one were to fail
any of these tests?

94
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,328
Nothing good.

95
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:06,307
Please remove all articles of clothing, and
proceed into the scanner.

96
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:39,860
Your clothing and personal items have been
sterilized, XPD-154.

97
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,206
May I ask you a question?

98
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:53,078
Feel free.

99
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:54,770
Do you know what this about?

100
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,760
Should I?

101
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:58,067
No. It's highly classified.

102
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,003
But I 've been cleared to debrief
you, because your consciousness

103
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,581
of the gravity of the situation may
increase your motivation to complete.

104
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,600
I've never failed to complete.

105
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,583
The hemophages are a dying
species, on the verge

106
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:14,490
of non-existence.

107
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,610
We have developed weapon that will push
them past that brink

108
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,893
into extinction.

109
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,419
If this weapon is so important

110
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:22,408
Why not have it delivered
by armored convoy?

111
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:25,407
The armored convoy you refer to is
departing the facility as we speak.

112
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:27,485
The hemophages will do
anything in their power

113
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,907
to stop and immobilize it.

114
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,344
It is of course a decoy.

115
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:33,008
XPD-154

116
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,447
You'll be receiving a
case, containing a weapon.

117
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,088
I don't have to tell you.

118
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,049
Under no circumstances should you open it.

119
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,346
You're right.

120
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,399
You don't have to tell me.

121
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:53,213
Identify.

122
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,777
XPD-154: Clearance Classified Courier.

123
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,682
Copy XPD-154: you will be Ven-secting.

124
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,947
Everything in order, XPD-154?

125
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:22,863
100%, Commrade Doctor.

126
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:56,086
You're quite certain, everything is in order?

127
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:57,577
Positively.

128
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,490
Empty your DNA to confirm receipt.

129
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:04,645
I can only confirm receipt of the container,
not its contents.

130
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:06,044
That's acceptable.

131
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:18,889
Opening the case is strictly
forbidden, you understand this.

132
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:20,162
Perfectly.

133
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:24,190
The contents are set to self-destruct in event
of non-delivery, in

134
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,162
exactly 9 hours from now.

135
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:43,149
What is your condition, XPD-154?

136
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,197
Are you functional?

137
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:57,937
XPD-154, Clearance Classified Courier.

138
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:58,797
Get on the ground.

139
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:00,206
On your knees! On your knees!

140
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:00,765
Get down.

141
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:02,191
What the hell is going on?

142
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:04,399
You were entered and processed
through this gate 15 minutes ago.

143
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,567
Then it wasn't me, you dumb son of a bitch.

144
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:09,047
Check my ID. You gotta mite!

145
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,719
I repeat XPD-154. Are you functional?

146
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:17,192
I don't know what you are talking about
Commrade Doctor, I am 100% functional.

147
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,201
Security breach!
Security breach!

148
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,615
Stand yellow alert!
Stand yellow alert!

149
00:15:03,697 --> 00:15:06,605
Intercept. Intercept!
Inner defense wall!

150
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,679
Unarmed intruder. Unarmed intruder!

151
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,155
How did the hemophage
get past the screens?

152
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:05,802
We don't know sir,

153
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:09,042
maybe meta-suppressants to
subordinate the blood characteristics.

154
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,508
All security to their stations!

155
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,975
All security, report to their stations!

156
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:49,745
How did she do that?

157
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:52,309
She must have some sort of gravity leveler.

158
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:54,304
Well, whatever it is, it's
out now. She's not going

159
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,690
to make it out of this complex alive.

160
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,789
Sir, we've ID'd her.

161
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,946
Plague victim.

162
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,912
She was confined to this
facility for experimentation

163
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:02,899
until she escaped,

164
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,031
after the forced termination
of her pregnancy

165
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:05,928
12 years ago.

166
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:09,346
Violet Sangt-Jacques Sheriff.
Tell me I'm wrong!

167
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:10,260
You're wrong.

168
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,666
Why are you doing this?

169
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,599
Because I hate humans

170
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:16,688
with every fiber of my being.

171
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,963
I'll kill every single one of them,

172
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:21,490
almost as quickly as they'll try and kill me.

173
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:23,244
You used to be human!

174
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:24,541
But not anymore, right?

175
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,567
I got sick, and now I'm
something less than human.

176
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,834
Something

177
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:30,823
worthy of extermination.

178
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,375
It's academic now, isn't it?

179
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,223
You won't make it out of here with that case.

180
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,328
Watch me.

181
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,719
She's there on the ceiling!

182
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:52,713
Shoot! Shoot!

183
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,813
It's me.

184
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:06,906
Did you get it?

185
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:08,203
Yeah.

186
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,239
But they're serious about
not letting me keep it.

187
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:12,368
Fine.

188
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:15,020
The objective is the destruction
of the weapon.

189
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,969
If you can't make delivery -- destroy it.

190
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,891
Copy that. Will terminate and destroy.

191
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,790
No, V.

192
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,666
The attack on the blood bank failed --
You cannot!

193
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,895
Under no circumstances can you
look inside that case!

194
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:31,902
If you are compromised, you must
destroy it immediately! Read?

195
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:33,006
Read.

196
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:43,828
V.
What the hell is going on?

197
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:44,527
I'm clear.

198
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,885
I told you to destroy the weapon.

199
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:48,875
I said I'm clear.

200
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:52,182
You have the case?

201
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,083
Affirmative.

202
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:55,980
Bring it in.

203
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:57,385
What's your status?

204
00:22:57,781 --> 00:22:59,875
The needle. In the Shinwago.

205
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,000
10 minutes.

206
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:01,020
Bravo, V.

207
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:02,115
Bravo.

208
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:04,010
No one but you could have pulled
this off.

209
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:06,145
It's not a weapon.

210
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:08,531
What are you talking about?

211
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:12,125
It's not a weapon, it's a child.
A human child.

212
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:13,682
You opened the case?

213
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:15,578
What difference does it make?

214
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,359
I risked my life for nothing.

215
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:26,078
I think I had to know
what I was willing to die for.

216
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:35,823
You see?

217
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,259
Nothing.

218
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:38,057
Nothing.

219
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:39,156
It's not a weapon.

220
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:40,942
It's a child.

221
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:45,172
It's both. It's a weapon
and a child.

222
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:50,484
Its blood is swarming with cultured antigens
that would kill all of us!

223
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:51,406
On contact.

224
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:55,084
If they atomize its tissues
into the atmosphere.

225
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:57,448
It would be like insecticide, to people.

226
00:25:57,963 --> 00:25:59,425
Like you and me.

227
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:02,317
It would find us.
And, it would kill us.

228
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:04,557
All of us.

229
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:10,162
Nerver, wait, if there's an accelerator for HGV
this child's blood

230
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:13,060
Then, so's the counter-analogue
for decelerating it.

231
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,701
What are you saying V.?

232
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,181
A cure?

233
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:21,603
Wouldn't it be better than infecting
innocent people?

234
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:24,582
This child could provide the choice.

235
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,317
If there's choice, V --
I have already made it.

236
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,895
It's a child.

237
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:36,077
You can go now, your work is done.

238
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:58,135
It was a protection.

239
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:03,161
Don't ever think it -- it just turns out I was right.
We're gettin' the hell outta here.

240
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:17,156
She went up!
So go after her.

241
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:20,378
The Blood-she-more control
the top10 floors of this building.

242
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,599
Whatever they want --

243
00:27:22,698 --> 00:27:23,557
give it to them.

244
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,135
Watch me.

245
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:51,961
Hey.

246
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:57,010
What are you doing up there, huh?

247
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:00,334
Hey.

248
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:05,510
It's a nice view, huh?

249
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:10,578
Why don't you -- uh

250
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:14,510
help me up
so I can see it too?

251
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:20,010
Here. Give me your hand.

252
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,490
Give your hand.

253
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:27,291
Help me up. Come on.

254
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,750
It's okay.

255
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:47,088
What do you think you're doing, huh?
You trying to get yourself killed?

256
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:48,874
Come on!

257
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,172
Stop it!

258
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:23,895
Seal the building. Any other 'Phages inside
I want them hunted down and killed.

259
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:26,291
Violet Sang-Jacques Sheriff.

260
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,469
Easy, Violet.

261
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:33,891
Do you know who I am?

262
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:38,394
How could I not?
Tyrant.   Egomaniac.

263
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:41,969
Narcissist?
That about sums it up, doesn't it?

264
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:44,834
Yes it may be true, I

265
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:48,875
may have quirks --
but that doesn't mean I'm stupid.

266
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:53,593
And it certainly doesn't mean that you make a
single move, without me knowing about it.

267
00:32:53,593 --> 00:32:55,489
You would have killed me a long time ago.

268
00:32:55,578 --> 00:32:58,547
Listen.
The boy is useless to you, he's --

269
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:04,277
laboratory bred. Vegatative.
Practically brain-dead. Just give him to me.

270
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:05,584
And you're on your way.

271
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:09,067
And then you can use him to kill me
and everybody like me.

272
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:11,984
He's not what you think.

273
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:12,885
No?

274
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:15,848
What is he then?

275
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:20,469
He's my son.

276
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,182
Hey Daxis.

277
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:30,984
What?

278
00:33:31,984 --> 00:33:33,608
You're full of shit.

279
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:39,526
Cover your ears!

280
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,125
Cover your ears!

281
00:33:43,402 --> 00:33:45,402
Metro 5 is boarding

282
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:52,635
Stand clear

283
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,031
Doors closing

284
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,162
Damaged?
Are you damaged!?

285
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:24,318
What am I doing?

286
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:30,909
Hey!

287
00:34:32,786 --> 00:34:34,998
Park it!
Right there!

288
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:41,724
Don't make me have to tell you twice.
. . .  Sit!

289
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:56,800
Don't get any cute ideas, either.

290
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:00,324
The only reason I saved your life

291
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:03,442
is because whatever's in your blood
can save mine.

292
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:07,148
If they corner us,
suffer no delusions.

293
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:09,126
I will kill you.

294
00:35:20,307 --> 00:35:23,307
Damn it!
S-Squadron entering station -- contain and search train

295
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:25,505
Metro 5 is boarding

296
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:31,380
Garth, it's me. I screwed up!
I screwed up bad.

297
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,766
The case had a kid in it.

298
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,599
I crossed Nerva.
I know. He called.

299
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,797
Don't even think about bringing it here V.

300
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:41,297
Damn it Garth, this kid
might have the answer in him.

301
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:44,554
And I'm just gonna be lucky to
get him out of here alive.

302
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:48,115
I need your help!

303
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:51,755
I'm sorry V. . . . My research is too important
to jeapordize for a single child.

304
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,568
Goodbye V.

305
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:10,326
What part of those bullets whizzing
by your head didn't you get?

306
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,199
Do you understand anything I'm saying to you?

307
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:22,027
Okay. Let's start simple.

308
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,422
They had to call you something, right?
Do you have a name?

309
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:28,844
I'm Violet.
Hi, pleased to meet you.

310
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:30,777
Your turn. Go.

311
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,483
Six.

312
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,242
You.

313
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,699
We gotta go.

314
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,063
Dammit!

315
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:03,106
Gimme your arm.

316
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,922
Give your arm!

317
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:12,699
Now you listen to me, Six.
Or whatever your name is.

318
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,773
I might not be able to get you where I want you
to go, but I sure as hell am going to

319
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:19,670
get your blood now. Now gimmie your arm
before I take the whole thing!

320
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:23,005
You think those people are bad?

321
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:25,338
Well let me tell you something.

322
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:29,141
The real monster, you don't want
knocking down your doors, mate.

323
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,818
If I scream

324
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,005
we'll both be dead.

325
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:53,422
Daxis doesn't know you can speak,
does he?

326
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,525
What do you know about what's going on?

327
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:03,657
There's a war going on
to the death

328
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:09,179
between humans and hemophages.
And Six, you're human -- and

329
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:12,672
I'm a hemophage.

330
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,974
Wait!

331
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:18,266
Listen! Do you remember I said that
there was something in your blood

332
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,869
that could save my life?

333
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:24,016
Well -- Daxis. He put something into
your blood. He grew something there.

334
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:27,402
And whatever that is, those antigens,

335
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:31,152
They may hold the key to saving my life,
but they were put there first and foremost

336
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:32,693
to kill me.

337
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:35,818
To kill me, and everyone like me.

338
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:40,067
So . . .  these men?

339
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,045
Yeah, Six.

340
00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:46,505
They're after you.   Right now --

341
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:49,981
you're the most valuable object
on this planet.

342
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:59,141
Unbelieveable, V.
You jeapordize everything, by coming here.

343
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:01,059
The humans want me.

344
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:02,652
Nerva wants me.

345
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:06,804
I don't have any place left to go, Garth.

346
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:09,443
Besides

347
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:13,398
You have all my guns.

348
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,824
So what's his story?

349
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:23,224
You tell me.

350
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:50,141
Can you make an assessment?
-- I'll need to draw some blood.

351
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:52,137
It'll take a few hours.

352
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:08,523
Sweeper Team A, inform ArchmMinister Daxis
we have the remaining hemophages cornered

353
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:10,318
on the 21st floor.

354
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:15,827
they're right beghind me.
The lights!

355
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:26,295
Go night-vision. Take them apart.

356
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:33,880
Switching to emergency backup lighting system.

357
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:25,460
So . . . are you going to kill me?

358
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:36,318
Think you can?

359
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:09,271
I think you and I have matters of mutual
self-interest to discuss.

360
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:27,327
Sit down.

361
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,402
Humans are celebrating something.

362
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:54,199
Where is this?

363
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:01,057
When I was a kid,

364
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,985
and I was just a little girl

365
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:08,672
I used to dream about this
old, dusty road.

366
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:14,074
And this road would go on,
as far as the eye could see.

367
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:17,516
And there was

368
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:20,976
all these little white flowers
growing around the edges,

369
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:24,496
and it was such a -- peaceful place.

370
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:28,974
There was a happy place.

371
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:32,224
But then, you realize,

372
00:43:32,324 --> 00:43:34,880
when life settles in around you

373
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:36,981
places like this

374
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:39,402
don't exist.

375
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,438
You're dying.

376
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,518
Yeah. I am.

377
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:02,735
I'm sorry.

378
00:44:08,463 --> 00:44:10,244
Do  you read?

379
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:15,838
Allright. Look.

380
00:44:20,262 --> 00:44:22,057
Commrade.

381
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,557
Lover.

382
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:32,088
Life.

383
00:44:34,393 --> 00:44:36,335
And this one.

384
00:44:36,831 --> 00:44:39,516
This . . .
This one was gonna save mother.

385
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:43,898
But, I got sick and
and . . .

386
00:44:45,202 --> 00:44:48,153
all that became impossible.

387
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:27,735
You're not lookin' so good.

388
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,356
I need to transfuse you.

389
00:45:30,432 --> 00:45:33,932
Just be thankful you didn't convert
with light sensitivity too.

390
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:44,766
You do this?

391
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,862
What is it?

392
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,057
I'm not sure.
It looks

393
00:45:50,673 --> 00:45:52,588
chemical...  But,

394
00:45:52,682 --> 00:45:55,849
it seems to be done in the pre-collapsed
form of Western notation, so

395
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:58,360
it was -- probably him.

396
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:02,012
What is he?

397
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,298
I know what he's not.

398
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:09,740
He's not someone who has a single molecule
of vampire antigen in his blood

399
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:11,463
that's what he's not.

400
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:14,161
He's not someone
who's any good to us.

401
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,559
We can't reverse-engineer
a cure out of his blood.

402
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:18,547
What?

403
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:21,358
And if that's not bad enough,
the kid's hot, Violet --

404
00:46:21,463 --> 00:46:24,557
practically radioactive.
He's got a tracking device in him

405
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:26,744
that's accurate to about 100 meters.

406
00:46:26,844 --> 00:46:28,744
We're shielded in here.

407
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:31,161
I don't understand

408
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:34,344
why would Nerva want me
to get him so badly?

409
00:46:34,547 --> 00:46:36,661
And why were the humans
guarding him so closely?

410
00:46:37,068 --> 00:46:39,068
I don't know.

411
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:43,721
But whatever they did put in the kid, Violet --
It's killing him.

412
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:48,088
Some kind of aggressive
antagonistic protein. Very

413
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:53,193
predictible decay.
It's got a shelf-life of about 8 hours.

414
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:58,235
The kid's toast, V.

415
00:47:21,668 --> 00:47:24,422
Why are you doing this?
He's just a child.

416
00:47:24,527 --> 00:47:26,485
It's a human child, Garth.

417
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:27,782
And besides

418
00:47:27,876 --> 00:47:29,943
what you're doing here is too valuable
to jeapordize.

419
00:47:31,454 --> 00:47:33,451
Goodbye Garth.

420
00:47:36,172 --> 00:47:38,182
You've got a tracking device in you.

421
00:47:38,286 --> 00:47:41,557
We've got to get moving
before it locks on. Come on.

422
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:15,086
Daxis! My phone number
changes every 60 seconds.

423
00:48:22,844 --> 00:48:25,652
Disposable phone printing
thank you

424
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:35,018
Garth it's me. I think they've been tracking
my phone, better get moving.

425
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,179
--  Okay.

426
00:48:36,277 --> 00:48:37,179
Violet?

427
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,818
Maybe it's me.

428
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:43,619
Come on!

429
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:53,902
Violet, wait!

430
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,121
What are we doing?

431
00:48:59,224 --> 00:49:01,996
I would be neglecting my duties

432
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:05,059
If I didn't get a growing-boy fat --
wouldn't I?

433
00:49:06,224 --> 00:49:09,340
Credit card. Allright, so
you take this over there

434
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:11,963
And see if you can't
find us something to eat.

435
00:49:21,389 --> 00:49:23,086
Go on.

436
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:30,349
Six.

437
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:35,557
You should, uh,
really

438
00:49:37,518 --> 00:49:39,777
put your mask up.

439
00:49:43,985 --> 00:49:45,969
Goodbye, Violet.

440
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:19,157
It's urgent
response team moving out

441
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:36,943
Squad One: we got a visual

442
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:56,777
What am I doing?

443
00:51:29,827 --> 00:51:33,059
It's not him.
secure lock down

444
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:36,585
Initiate area quarantine procedures

445
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,262
Six!

446
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,865
Wait.

447
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:55,168
Six !!

448
00:51:56,068 --> 00:51:57,360
Sorry, V.

449
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:24,684
Violet Sang-Jacques Sheriff.

450
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:27,360
What are you thinkin'?

451
00:52:27,463 --> 00:52:30,266
Not bletchin' war.

452
00:52:33,963 --> 00:52:36,206
We're as fast as you.

453
00:52:36,307 --> 00:52:38,547
We are as strong as you.

454
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:40,818
Yeah

455
00:52:41,318 --> 00:52:42,318
But

456
00:52:44,063 --> 00:52:46,902
Are you one tenth
as pissed off as I am?

457
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,079
Careful, V.

458
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:31,318
Gunfire will attract the
human security teams.

459
00:53:31,724 --> 00:53:35,286
You might win the battle, but
you'd lose the war, V.

460
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,182
V, wait.

461
00:53:44,585 --> 00:53:47,610
Don't you realize what
this child has in him?

462
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:50,266
I don't care what this child
has in him.

463
00:53:50,668 --> 00:53:52,682
It's not a vampiral antigen.

464
00:53:53,389 --> 00:53:55,621
But a human antigen.

465
00:53:56,621 --> 00:53:59,932
Lethal enough to kill
every human on the planet.

466
00:54:01,547 --> 00:54:04,443
Why would humans create
a human antigen?

467
00:54:04,547 --> 00:54:07,943
What do I -- or even you
care why?

468
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:11,668
Daxis has offered us
a most tempting proposal.

469
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:14,547
One that would finally
even the odds for us.

470
00:54:14,547 --> 00:54:16,990
So just walk away V.

471
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,402
Walk away.

472
00:54:55,907 --> 00:54:57,713
Are you insane?

473
00:54:58,014 --> 00:55:01,777
You won't drop him.
You need him more than I do.

474
00:55:02,688 --> 00:55:03,922
Enter.

475
00:56:19,786 --> 00:56:23,047
What did they . . .
put in me, Violet?

476
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:34,771
Don't you see?

477
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:40,411
That mechanism... Daxis --
your father put inside you,

478
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:45,943
it's a . . . antagonistic protein,
it's very precise, and

479
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:52,438
It's going to shut you down, Six.

480
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,329
It's going to kill you Six,

481
00:56:57,628 --> 00:57:00,766
if I don't find some way
if I don't find some

482
00:57:01,568 --> 00:57:04,664
I just need some time,
just need

483
00:57:11,704 --> 00:57:12,713
Hello Violet.

484
00:57:12,918 --> 00:57:13,918
3-D me.

485
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:17,985
This is a surprise.

486
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:20,786
I want you to take out
whatever you put in the kid.

487
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,463
Oh, I wish that was possible, but there is
no cure for the antigen.

488
00:57:24,766 --> 00:57:26,221
I don't believe you.

489
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:27,818
Just bring him to me.

490
00:57:28,016 --> 00:57:31,641
The antigen dies with the boy, and neither
of them are any good to anybody.

491
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:35,543
You said you were his father,
for godsake.

492
00:57:35,746 --> 00:57:36,985
No, Violet.

493
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,784
I don't have a father.

494
00:57:41,184 --> 00:57:43,610
No?
More precisely

495
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,088
he's my clone.
Number six in a series of eight.

496
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:54,829
What...? What the hell difference does it make?
He's a child, you monster.

497
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:55,726
Monster?

498
00:57:56,829 --> 00:58:01,547
And, what you? And, more importantly,
what does that make him to you?

499
00:58:01,547 --> 00:58:05,588
Some sort of bizarre maternal surrogate?

500
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:10,797
A vampire and a dying human child

501
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:14,110
what a pathetic picture.

502
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:17,963
I'll make you another Violet.
One that's not broken

503
00:58:18,068 --> 00:58:20,891
You won't even be able to tell the difference.
I promise.

504
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:25,027
And I may even be able to help you with
that problem you have in your own blood.

505
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:26,016
Trace.

506
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,920
Why track the call,
I'll tell you where I am,

507
00:58:29,221 --> 00:58:31,481
I want you to bring me the boy.

508
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:34,963
I'll bring you a lot more than that,
you prick.

509
00:58:35,463 --> 00:58:38,422
I have 700 soldiers here with me.

510
00:58:38,527 --> 00:58:42,182
What do you really think you can do
against that many men?

511
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,690
I can kill them.

512
00:58:50,382 --> 00:58:53,610
Arch-ministry.
Let's go meet your maker.

513
00:59:01,016 --> 00:59:02,507
Auto guide on

514
00:59:13,507 --> 00:59:15,411
You can't make it in.

515
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,786
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

516
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:23,063
Haven't you been paying attention?

517
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:25,954
Killing is what I do.

518
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:28,744
It's what I'm good at.

519
00:59:31,543 --> 00:59:34,637
Hey . . .
I'm a Titan.

520
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:38,036
A monolith.

521
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:41,672
Nothing can stop me.

522
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,882
I can see it.

523
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:49,637
What the hell choice
do I have?

524
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,985
A very clear one.

525
00:59:55,418 --> 00:59:57,481
To watch me die.

526
00:59:58,485 --> 01:00:00,391
Or make me

527
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,360
watch you do the same.

528
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:32,474
Are you mental?

529
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:33,773
The antidote.

530
01:00:35,563 --> 01:00:38,056
I told you,
there is no cure.

531
01:00:38,465 --> 01:00:40,983
You wouldn't create a human-lethal antigen
without an antidote you could

532
01:00:41,068 --> 01:00:42,068
administer to yourself!

533
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,766
And your man-ciples.

534
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:46,543
Very nice, Violet.

535
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:49,932
Well, yes. There is an antidote.
And yes,

536
01:00:50,036 --> 01:00:53,204
when I get the boy, isolate the antigen
and release it into the atmosphere

537
01:00:53,307 --> 01:00:56,807
anyone who wants to live will cue up
daily at this door to get it.

538
01:00:57,617 --> 01:00:59,568
I thought we were the ones you hated.

539
01:00:59,963 --> 01:01:02,360
I thought we were the ones you
were trying to wipe out!

540
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:05,563
That's problem.  You were.
Past tense.

541
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:09,257
But now that you, and those like you
are all but extinct

542
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,606
what's someone like me, someone
with a job to do

543
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:15,824
going to use -- to keep order in a society
that left to itself

544
01:01:16,025 --> 01:01:18,014
would sprint toward chaos like
an olympic event.

545
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:20,409
We did our job too well.

546
01:01:21,016 --> 01:01:23,494
Now -- must we make amends.

547
01:01:23,992 --> 01:01:26,005
You disgust me.

548
01:01:26,313 --> 01:01:28,338
It's a relative term, Violet.

549
01:01:28,536 --> 01:01:30,460
Give me what I want.

550
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:32,762
Come and get it.

551
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,137
You won't have him.

552
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:00,043
Projection disruption

553
01:02:14,784 --> 01:02:16,762
There's just too many, V.

554
01:02:19,204 --> 01:02:21,001
Just too many.

555
01:03:04,402 --> 01:03:05,432
Six

556
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:11,737
Violet -
I'm here.   I'm here.

557
01:03:17,387 --> 01:03:19,182
What's that sound, V?

558
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:22,688
V, what's that sound?

559
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,110
That's just the wind.

560
01:03:28,913 --> 01:03:30,797
Just the wind.

561
01:04:06,865 --> 01:04:08,318
Too late, he's gone.

562
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:10,942
Quarantine the corpse, get it
to the Arch-ministry.

563
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:13,054
Maybe we can salvage
something out of it.

564
01:04:13,152 --> 01:04:14,452
And her, sir?

565
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:34,688
Have an incendiary team
sanitize the area immediately.

566
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:40,086
All personnel, prepare to leave the area
Get the body on ice. Prepare it for disassembly.

567
01:04:40,384 --> 01:04:43,271
We go in for salvage at daybreak.
Yes, doctor.

568
01:04:43,574 --> 01:04:45,454
All personnel, clear the area immediately

569
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:48,188
Violet.

570
01:04:51,081 --> 01:04:51,798
Violet.

571
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,210
Violet.

572
01:04:59,956 --> 01:05:00,755
Violet.

573
01:05:06,746 --> 01:05:08,047
Ga...  Garth...

574
01:05:09,065 --> 01:05:12,878
You very thoughtfully subbed in
for the incendiary team.

575
01:05:13,378 --> 01:05:16,672
Your heart stopped three times,
but after four hours of surgery

576
01:05:16,773 --> 01:05:18,172
and a lot of prayer

577
01:05:19,297 --> 01:05:21,360
We managed to save your life.

578
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,068
You what?

579
01:05:29,777 --> 01:05:30,735
Careful.

580
01:05:33,788 --> 01:05:37,996
I was there, Garth. I was there.

581
01:05:38,298 --> 01:05:40,811
You brought me back.

582
01:05:41,615 --> 01:05:43,101
And for what?

583
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,173
So I can do it all over again?

584
01:05:49,273 --> 01:05:50,369
Why?

585
01:05:51,771 --> 01:05:56,271
Isn't it -- isn't it obvious?

586
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:09,402
Why won't you ever let
anyone in?

587
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:11,360
Because

588
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,909
these moments

589
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:20,887
as beautiful as they are

590
01:06:22,018 --> 01:06:24,494
they're evil, when they're gone.

591
01:07:14,257 --> 01:07:17,059
Violet. It's me, Garth.

592
01:07:17,059 --> 01:07:19,204
Listen: turn on the TV.

593
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:22,391
You're all over the place,
every channel.

594
01:07:22,896 --> 01:07:25,356
Listen to me --
Just minutes ago                   apparently . . .

595
01:07:25,454 --> 01:07:27,501
I know you're in a bad place

596
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,159
But what the boy wrote down
on that piece of paper

597
01:07:31,277 --> 01:07:34,425
it has something to do with the HGV virus,
I know it.

598
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:35,827
I can feel it.

599
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:39,829
Violet, if you can just give me
a little more time.

600
01:07:40,735 --> 01:07:41,873
V?

601
01:07:42,373 --> 01:07:43,373
Are you listening?

602
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,498
Where are you?
--- 10th artery, Westbound.

603
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:57,356
Stay on course, I'll converge in 15.

604
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:20,311
Arch-ministry, on approach

605
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,475
Violet, we can't get in there. It's impossible.
Why do you think we went through

606
01:08:23,578 --> 01:08:27,073
so much trouble to have you intercept
the case before it got back to Arch-ministry?

607
01:08:27,378 --> 01:08:29,337
I'm aware of that.

608
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:34,119
What's the point? Retribution?
The boy is dead!

609
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:36,095
He's not dead.

610
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:38,738
What do you mean?

611
01:08:39,234 --> 01:08:41,336
I mean Six is alive.

612
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:45,283
Violet! How can he be alive?
Wait! Look!

613
01:08:45,386 --> 01:08:48,984
What the boy wrote down on the paper. It's the
chemical foundation of what I am certain

614
01:08:49,078 --> 01:08:51,023
is a cure for hemoglophagia.

615
01:08:51,122 --> 01:08:54,520
Daxis' researchers probably developed it
years ago in the same lab

616
01:08:54,844 --> 01:08:58,622
that he was bred in.
Just give me a little time. I can cure you.

617
01:08:59,523 --> 01:09:01,037
I know it.

618
01:09:38,724 --> 01:09:42,100
The antigen can't survive
without a living host.

619
01:09:42,407 --> 01:09:47,407
However we may be able to salvage
some viable basic protein analogues

620
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:52,939
that will save us time, in re-culturing
the antigen in another clone.

621
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,965
Searching for ... concealed weapons

622
01:10:17,842 --> 01:10:20,307
Number of weapons found

623
01:10:21,702 --> 01:10:22,774
Many!

624
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:25,373
I'm here to see,
the Vice-Cardinal.

625
01:10:29,265 --> 01:10:31,960
Yellow Alert!      Yellow alert!

626
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:34,764
Yellow Alert!      Yellow alert!

627
01:10:38,429 --> 01:10:39,291
It's her!

628
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:40,390
She's dead!

629
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:47,877
Oh my god.

630
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:56,091
Single female intruder identified in
security portal one

631
01:10:56,903 --> 01:10:58,439
Please remain calm

632
01:10:59,246 --> 01:11:03,195
pacification and neutralization
is underway

633
01:11:10,271 --> 01:11:12,725
The boy's dead.
This is pure suicide.

634
01:12:31,788 --> 01:12:33,990
Yellow alert upgraded

635
01:12:34,091 --> 01:12:34,890
Orange alert

636
01:12:35,378 --> 01:12:38,041
One woman against 14 men.
It's ridiculous!

637
01:12:38,257 --> 01:12:40,895
Have the gas guard waiting for her
in the mortal sciences library,

638
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:42,783
I'm going to level her!

639
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,203
Red alert!
Red alert!

640
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:22,694
Red alert!
Red alert!

641
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:40,869
You are all
gonna die.

642
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:04,363
Is that all you've got?

643
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,725
Violet -- the boy is dead.

644
01:16:14,225 --> 01:16:18,198
You obviously don't have a clear grasp
of what "dead" really is.

645
01:16:18,798 --> 01:16:20,711
Allow me to demonstrate.

646
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,188
For godsakes . . .
Violet --

647
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,480
I'm unarmed!

648
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:30,939
Not yet you're not.

649
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:35,822
No!

650
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:52,426
You got hemo blood on me.

651
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,199
It is on!

652
01:17:31,128 --> 01:17:32,310
Yeah it is.

653
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,502
Yes, no doubt in a fair fight,
you would beat me.

654
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:07,073
But that's not how I got
where I am today.

655
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:22,371
Can you see me, Violet?

656
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:25,655
No?

657
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,048
Too bad you can hurt with only
mild light sensitivity.

658
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,434
Unlike me.

659
01:18:31,735 --> 01:18:32,730
What?

660
01:18:32,935 --> 01:18:34,612
That's right, Violet.

661
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:37,070
How do you think a lowly
lab technician

662
01:18:37,162 --> 01:18:39,654
Made that meteoric rise
through the ranks?

663
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:44,972
What accident of providence do you think
gave him those additional qualities?

664
01:18:45,573 --> 01:18:47,411
Yes Violet.

665
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,619
I'm like you.

666
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,264
My god!

667
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:57,054
With the minor exception that
I'm going to walk out of here alive.

668
01:18:59,061 --> 01:19:00,434
Violet.

669
01:19:01,836 --> 01:19:02,912
Violet!

670
01:19:55,175 --> 01:19:57,533
Do you believe in god, Violet?

671
01:19:59,037 --> 01:20:01,432
Do you hope he's merciful?

672
01:20:01,533 --> 01:20:06,225
Do you think he'll welcome you,
into his arms, like the so very many

673
01:20:06,328 --> 01:20:08,328
you've sent his way?

674
01:20:08,926 --> 01:20:10,912
Hey, Daxis.

675
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:14,547
You know, after this

676
01:20:14,645 --> 01:20:16,645
I think you will.

677
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:02,561
Six.

678
01:21:04,475 --> 01:21:05,787
Six, wake up.

679
01:21:07,398 --> 01:21:08,454
Violet.

680
01:21:10,761 --> 01:21:15,328
But -- I thought I was  . . .  dead.

681
01:21:17,033 --> 01:21:18,073
No.

682
01:21:36,862 --> 01:21:38,787
You've just been reborn.

683
01:21:47,019 --> 01:21:48,069
Violet.

684
01:21:50,721 --> 01:21:51,643
Violet.

685
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,240
Violet!

686
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:58,890
It's okay.

687
01:21:58,993 --> 01:22:00,490
No, it's not.

688
01:22:00,994 --> 01:22:03,117
Violet listen to me.

689
01:22:05,515 --> 01:22:07,253
There's a cure.

690
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,253
Oh. No.

691
01:22:14,523 --> 01:22:16,314
We found it?

692
01:22:24,045 --> 01:22:25,011
Come on.

693
01:22:34,511 --> 01:22:38,512
Yes, I was born into a world
you might not understand.

694
01:22:39,515 --> 01:22:41,927
But a world, as it turns out

695
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:45,416
where hope still lives.

696
01:22:48,557 --> 01:22:53,252
And my body -- will Garth be able
to fix it?

697
01:22:53,354 --> 01:22:55,918
The way another had cured my soul?

698
01:22:57,122 --> 01:22:58,220
Maybe.

699
01:22:58,518 --> 01:22:59,819
Maybe not.

700
01:23:00,926 --> 01:23:06,953
But this I do know: all those still
out there who spread oppression

701
01:23:06,953 --> 01:23:10,324
and "justice" and hatred:

702
01:23:10,612 --> 01:23:11,966
They better hope not.
