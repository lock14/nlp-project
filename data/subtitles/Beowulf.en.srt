1
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:37,671
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

2
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:41,265
I want mead!

3
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,678
Give me some mead, my Queen!

4
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:53,122
Thank you, my beautiful Queen.

5
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,293
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

6
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,925
This is how it works, Aesher.

7
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,662
After you die,
you wouldn't really be dead

8
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:15,578
providing you have accepted him
as the one and only God.

9
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,049
All right, back! Back!

10
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,239
Here, my beauty, give me a kiss.

11
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,175
I want a kiss! Give me a kiss!
I want a kiss!

12
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,349
Please, stop it!

13
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,454
More!

14
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,490
My thanes, my beautiful thanes!

15
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,826
One year ago, I, Hrothgar, your King

16
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,763
swore that we would
celebrate our victories

17
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:20,336
in a new hall, mighty and beautiful!

18
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:24,571
Have I not kept my oath? Yeah.

19
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:29,843
In this hall, we shall divide
the spoils of our conquests,

20
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,246
the gold and the treasure.

21
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:37,423
And this shall be a place of merriment,
joy, and fornication!

22
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:48,098
From now until the end of time,
I name this hall Herot!

23
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:54,011
Treasure!
Let's hand out some treasure!

24
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,104
Give me some of that!

25
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,778
From my conquests!

26
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:02,410
Unferth!

27
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:08,149
For Unferth, for Unferth,
my wisest advisor,

28
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,489
violator of virgins
and best and bravest of brave brawlers.

29
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,427
Unferth, where the hell are you,
you weasel-faced bastard?

30
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,771
I'm here, my King.

31
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:26,378
Unferth, come here, you ungrateful lout!

Come! Arm yourselves!

64
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:03,894
Stay down, my Lady!

65
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,776
- Give me a sword! A sword!
- My Lord!

66
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:09,757
No!

67
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:44,962
Fight me!

68
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:47,765
Fight me!

69
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,305
Fight me.

70
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:39,412
You fight me, damn you.

71
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:42,685
Nay.

72
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:31,237
What was that?

73
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,805
Grendel.

74
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:48,984
Grendel, what have you done?

75
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:53,426
What have you done, Grendel?

76
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:57,394
Mother...?

77
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,931
Fish and wolf and bear

78
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:06,033
and sheep or two,

79
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,275
but not men.

80
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:14,602
Men? They are small.

81
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:19,898
Here...

82
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:22,822
Men, Grendel.

83
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:26,993
They have slain so many of our kind.

84
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,846
Men...

85
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:35,724
...they screamed!

86
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,063
The men bellowed and screamed!

87
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,900
The men hurt me,

88
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:49,446
they hurt my head,

89
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:57,000
hurt my ear...

90
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,993
Was Hrothgar there?

91
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:14,012
I did not hurt him, no.

92
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,824
Good...

93
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:18,206
Good boy.

94
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,050
And tender.

95
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,897
Mother...

96
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,559
Men, build another pyre!

97
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,128
There's dry wood behind the stables.

98
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,263
Then burn the dead.

99
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:44,967
And seal the hall!
Close the doors and the windows.

100
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,735
And by the King's order,

101
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:50,206
there should be no singing
or merrymaking of any kind.

102
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,411
This place reeks of death.

103
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:58,113
The scops are singing
the shame of Herot

104
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:02,952
as far south as the middle kingdom
and as far north as the ice-lands.

105
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:06,289
I've let it be known that
I will give half the gold in my kingdom

106
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,892
to any man who can rid us of Grendel.

107
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:10,660
My King, for deliverance

108
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:15,398
our people sacrifice goats and sheep
to Odin and Heimdall.

109
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,567
With your permission,

110
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:22,105
shall we also pray
to the new Roman god, Christ Jesus?

111
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:25,018
Perhaps he can lift our affliction.

112
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:28,986
No, Unferth, no.

113
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:33,617
No, the gods will do nothing for us
that we will not do for ourselves.

114
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,153
What we need is a hero.

115
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,667
Hold your oars up!

116
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:48,902
And heave!

117
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:56,073
Can you see the coast?
Can you see the Danes' guide-fire?

118
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:59,343
I see nothing but the wind and the rain!

119
00:15:59,344 --> 00:16:02,480
No fire, no stars by which to navigate.

120
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:05,383
We're lost! Given to the sea!

121
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:07,051
The sea's my mother!

122
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:10,055
She'll never take me back
to her murky womb.

123
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:22,199
My mother was a fishwife in Uppland.

124
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,806
I was rather hoping to die in battle
as a warrior should!

125
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:29,818
Heave!

126
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:35,591
The men are worried
the storm has no end, Beowulf.

127
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:38,817
It's no earthly storm,
that much is for sure.

128
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:42,287
But this demon's tempest
will not hold us out

129
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,995
if we really want in!

130
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:50,128
Who wants to live?

131
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:51,730
We do!

132
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:55,500
Then pull your oars! Let's see you do it!

133
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:57,502
For Beowulf!

134
00:16:57,503 --> 00:16:59,471
For gold!

135
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:00,814
For glory!

136
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:25,637
Heave! Heave!

137
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:30,245
Heave! Heave!

138
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:42,081
Beowulf.

139
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:43,561
Hold fast!

140
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,420
No.

141
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:07,474
Who are you?
From your dress, you are warriors.

142
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:10,077
Speak! Why should I
not run you through right now?

143
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:12,613
We are Geats.

144
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:15,287
I am Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow.

145
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:20,821
We come seeking your Prince Hrothgar
in friendship.

146
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:23,957
They say you have a monster here?

147
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,427
They say your lands are cursed.

148
00:18:26,428 --> 00:18:27,528
Is that what they say?

149
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:29,396
Bards sing of Hrothgar's shame

150
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:32,032
from the frozen North
to the shores of Vinland.

151
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:33,902
There's no shame
to be accursed by demons!

152
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:38,249
I am Beowulf!
And I am here to kill your monster.

153
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,711
I thought there were no more heroes
foolish enough

154
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:46,281
to come around here
and die for our gold.

155
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:51,231
If we die, it'll be for
glory, not for gold.

156
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,533
My Lord?

157
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:09,003
My Lord?
There are warriors outside. Geats.

158
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:10,472
But they are no beggars,

159
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:12,140
and their leader Beowulf
is an imposing...

160
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:14,484
Beowulf? Ecgtheow's little boy?

161
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,313
Beowulf. Where is he? Where?

162
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:20,056
There you are.
Beowulf, welcome, my boy.

163
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:24,453
Welcome. Yes. How's your father?

164
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,955
Dead.

165
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,091
Died in battle with sea-raiders
two winters back.

166
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:31,093
Well, he was a brave man.

167
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:34,029
May I ask why you have come to us
from across the sea?

168
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,305
I've come to kill your monster.

169
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:40,903
And to taste that famous mead of yours.

170
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:45,318
There have been many brave men
who have come to taste my Lord's mead

171
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:51,715
and many who have sworn
to rid his hall of our nightmare.

172
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:56,553
But in the morning,
there was nothing left of any of them

173
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:59,296
but blood to be cleaned from the floor

174
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,937
and the benches, and the walls.

175
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:12,479
I have drunk nothing, yet.

176
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,073
But I will kill your monster.

177
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:22,212
He will kill the monster.
Did you hear that? Grendel will die.

178
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:25,319
- Grendel?
- Yeah, the monster is called Grendel.

179
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:29,653
Then I will kill your Grendel.

180
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:33,957
I, Beowulf,
killed a tribe of giants on the Orkneys,

181
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,227
crushed the skulls of sea-serpents,

182
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:42,266
and this troll of yours
will trouble you no more.

183
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:46,070
A hero! A hero!
I knew the sea would bring us a hero!

184
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:49,540
So will you go up to the moors,
to the dark pool by the cave

185
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,475
and kill the monster in its den?

186
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:56,550
I have 14 brave thanes with me.
We have been long at sea.

187
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:03,788
It is high time, mighty Hrothgar,
to break open your golden mead

188
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:05,656
famed across the world

189
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:10,328
and to feast
in your legendary mead hall.

190
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:14,065
The mead hall has been sealed
by his Lord's order.

191
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,945
Merrymaking in the hall
brings the devil, Grendel.

192
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:23,218
Well, then.

193
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:26,984
Open the mead hall! Let's drink!

194
00:22:08,122 --> 00:22:10,966
We don't want any trouble
with the locals.

195
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:16,362
Hondshew, make me feel
you're pretending to listen to me.

196
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:18,931
It's only been five days
since you waved your wife goodbye.

197
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:23,403
Five days? In the name of Odin,
no wonder my loins are burning!

198
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:31,077
Beowulf, there you are.

199
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:34,113
I was thinking about your father.
Great man.

200
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:35,515
He was fleeing the Wulfings

201
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:38,117
and he'd killed one of them
with his bare hands.

202
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:41,120
- Heatholaf.
- That's it, yeah. That's right.

203
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:45,993
I paid the blood debt for your father,
and he swore his oath to me.

204
00:22:45,994 --> 00:22:50,067
So I saved his skin,
and you're here to save ours, that right?

205
00:22:57,505 --> 00:23:00,941
All hail the great Beowulf,

206
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:05,652
come to save
our pathetic Danish skins, eh?

207
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:11,852
And we are so damned grateful,
mighty Beowulf.

208
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:17,803
But can I ask a question,
as a huge admirer of yours?

209
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:28,470
There was another Beowulf
I heard tell of

210
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:33,443
who challenged Brecca the Mighty to
a swimming race out on the open sea.

211
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:36,711
Was that you?

212
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:38,919
I swam against Brecca.

213
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,256
Because I thought
it had to be a different Beowulf,

214
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:51,226
someone else of the same name.

215
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:55,697
Because, you see,
the Beowulf I heard of

216
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:59,373
swam against Brecca and lost.

217
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:04,339
He risked his life and Brecca's

218
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,843
to serve his own vanity and pride.

219
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:10,347
A boastful fool.

220
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:13,323
And he lost!

221
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:18,260
So I thought it had to be someone else.

222
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:24,061
I swam against Brecca.

223
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:29,198
But victory was his, not yours.

224
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:34,341
A mighty warrior who cannot even
win a swimming match!

225
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:38,113
Speaking only for myself here,

226
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:44,046
not only do I doubt that you will be
able to stand for a moment

227
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:45,748
against Grendel,

228
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:50,995
I doubt that you will even have the belly
to stay in the hall all night.

229
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,731
I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

230
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,940
But it's true, I did not win the race.

231
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:11,441
We swam for five days, neck and neck.

232
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:15,545
I was conserving my strength
for the final stretch

233
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:18,549
when this storm blew up

234
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,423
and with it came sea monsters.

235
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,104
Again and again, the monsters attacked!

236
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:43,711
Dark things from the sea's depths.

237
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:57,154
I hacked and I lashed
at these foul beasts with my sword,

238
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,760
spilling their guts into the sea.

239
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,874
Beowulf!

240
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:26,359
Then one of them seized me by its jaws

241
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,264
and dragged me to the bottom.

242
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:03,234
I killed the monster with my own blade

243
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,632
and I plunged it into its heart.

244
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:12,967
Yes, of course. The sea monsters.

245
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:17,444
And you killed, what was it? 20?

246
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:20,874
Nine.

247
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,409
Last time it were three.

248
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,289
But would you do me the honor
of telling me your name?

249
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:34,056
I am Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

250
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:38,533
Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

251
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:42,299
I know who you are.

252
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:47,167
They say you killed both your brothers

253
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:51,047
when you witnessed them
having knowledge of your mother.

254
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:56,643
I have another true thing to tell you,
Unferth Kinslayer.

255
00:27:56,644 --> 00:28:01,215
If your strength and heart
was as strong and fierce as your words,

256
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:04,585
Grendel would not feel free to murder
and gorge on your people

257
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:06,954
without fear of retaliation.

258
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:09,390
Tonight will be different!

259
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:14,306
Tonight, he will find Geats waiting
for him, not frightened sheep

260
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:21,840
like you.

261
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:28,453
Well done!

262
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:35,550
That's the spirit, Beowulf.
That's the spirit we need.

263
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:38,622
So you will kill my Grendel for me,
will you?

264
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:47,769
Well, let's all drink in celebration
of the kill that is to come.

265
00:28:56,906 --> 00:29:01,110
<i>♪ Lips ripe as the berries in June ♪</i>

266
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:05,214
<i>♪ Red the rose, red the rose ♪</i>

267
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:09,585
<i>♪ Skin pale as the light of the moon ♪</i>

268
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:13,192
<i>♪ Gently as she goes ♪</i>

269
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:15,724
<i>♪ Eyes blue as the sea and the sky ♪</i>

270
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:18,227
Beowulf. Come.

271
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:20,296
<i>♪ Water flows, water flows ♪</i>

272
00:29:20,297 --> 00:29:22,364
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

273
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:26,569
<i>♪ Heart burning like fire in the night ♪</i>

274
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,176
<i>♪ Gently as she goes ♪</i>

275
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:36,216
Come.

276
00:29:40,852 --> 00:29:42,058
There.

277
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:44,991
The Royal Dragon Horn.

278
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:51,128
It is beautiful.

279
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:53,230
Isn't it magnificent?

280
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:55,699
She's the prize of my treasure.

281
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,770
I claimed her after my battle with Fafnir,
the dragon of the Northern moors.

282
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:02,910
Nearly cost me my life.

283
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:08,378
And there's a soft spot
under the throat, there.

284
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:11,883
See? You have to go in
with a knife or a dagger.

285
00:30:15,853 --> 00:30:18,560
It's the only way you can kill a dragon.

286
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:24,898
I wonder how many men
have died for love of her beauty.

287
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:27,871
Can you blame them?

288
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:31,436
If you destroy my Grendel for me,

289
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:37,478
she'll be yours forever
and ever and ever.

290
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:41,958
You do me great honor.

291
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:45,684
It is we who are honored.

292
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,074
Is that your demon?

293
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,877
That was a wolf.
You don't hear Grendel when he comes.

294
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:14,913
No? Well, you'll hear me, I promise.

295
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:19,051
Come on, my mighty lust limb
can transport you to paradise,

296
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:20,619
to ecstasy and back.

297
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,589
No other man
will ever be able to satisfy you again.

298
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,357
- Sorry.
- Come on!

299
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,893
- I said no and I meant no.
- Why not?

300
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:32,331
Because it's late and it's dark and the
monster could arrive at any moment!

301
00:31:32,332 --> 00:31:35,074
Well, then, how about a quick gobble?

302
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:43,642
The hour is upon us.

303
00:31:43,643 --> 00:31:46,818
This old man needs his sleep.

304
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:51,427
Where's my beautiful bedmate?
Come, my love.

305
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:55,422
In a moment.

306
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,535
Come, Wealthow,
let us pound the pillows.

307
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:01,897
Don't touch me!

308
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,901
That's the spirit, my girl.

309
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,009
My Lord!

310
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:17,777
Perhaps Her Majesty
could grace our ears

311
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:22,420
with one more melody
before we all retire?

312
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:29,735
It's the least I can do.

313
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:41,473
Beowulf, I'll hope to see you
in the morning, Odin willing.

314
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:46,444
And make sure
your thanes secure the doors.

315
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:50,445
Good night. Good night.

316
00:32:52,814 --> 00:32:56,917
Good night, Beowulf.
Watch out for sea monsters.

317
00:32:56,918 --> 00:33:00,729
I'm sure your imagination
must be teeming with them.

318
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,266
<i>♪ Just wait ♪</i>

319
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:14,269
<i>♪ Though wide he may roam ♪</i>

320
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:19,810
<i>♪ Always a hero comes home ♪</i>

321
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:29,317

<i>♪ But always a hero comes home ♪</i>

325
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:15,198
That was beautiful.

326
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:31,658
You need to go now, Your Majesty.

327
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:34,485
Of course. Grendel.

328
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:44,561
The demon is my husband's shame.

329
00:34:44,562 --> 00:34:47,235
It's not a shame, it's a curse.

330
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:49,805
No, shame.

331
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:54,311
My husband has no other. No sons.

332
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,208
And he will have no more,
for all his talk.

333
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:01,378
Oy, Hondshew. How was she?

334
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:03,313
Nah. Not my type.

335
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:05,191
I know your type.

336
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:15,671
Lord Beowulf, what are you doing?

337
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:19,797
The creature has no sword, no armor.

338
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:23,334
And I have no weapon
capable of slaying a monster.

339
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:25,703
We shall fight as equals.

340
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:27,740
And fate

341
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,581
shall decide.

342
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:54,868
Good. Tie it off with more chain.

343
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:00,584
Enough frican' about!

344
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,718
You're mad, you know that?

345
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,129
Yes.

346
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:22,663
Something vexes you, my Wiglaf?

347
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:28,410
I don't like the smell of this one,
my Lord.

348
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:31,604
The men are unprepared.

349
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:33,975
They're distracted.

350
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:37,209
Too many untended women here!

351
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,021
Abstinence prior to battle is essential!

352
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:46,419
A warrior's mind must be unblurred,
my Lord.

353
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,229
Good night, Wiglaf.

354
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:54,561
And while you're sleeping,
what're we meant to do?

355
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:57,201
Sing! Loudly!

356
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:04,337
Well, you heard him.
He wants us to sing. So sing!

357
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:05,908
Olaf, sing!

358
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:14,414

370
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,763
Grendel. He knocks.

371
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:03,732
That must be my sweet plum, Yrsa.

372
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:04,866
She's ready for me
to taste her juicy fruit.

373
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:05,902
My Lord.

374
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:11,841
Patience, patience, my love.

375
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:17,054
No! Hondshew! No!

376
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:31,732
Swife me! It's the frican' monster!

377
00:40:25,277 --> 00:40:28,053
I swear, the bastard has no pintel!

378
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:10,964
- No pintel.
- Aye.

379
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,493
- The demon shrinks!
- It shrinks! It shrinks!

380
00:41:57,438 --> 00:42:00,475
Demon!

381
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:43,923
Your bloodletting
days are finished, demon!

382
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,059
I am not a demon.

383
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,365
It speaks. It speaks!

384
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:55,273
What are you?

385
00:42:55,331 --> 00:43:00,602
I am ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger.

386
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:04,606
I am the teeth in the darkness,
the talons in the night.

387
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:08,076
Mine is strength and lust and power!

388
00:43:08,077 --> 00:43:10,318
I am Beowulf!

389
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,010
Grendel's arm!

390
00:43:39,276 --> 00:43:40,777
You've done it!

391
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,559
He's done it!

392
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:49,196
He's torn the limbs from the beast!
Beowulf has killed him!

393
00:43:51,154 --> 00:43:54,256
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

394
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,059
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

395
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,131
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

396
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,170
My Lord, Beowulf has killed the demon!

397
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,713
Odin be praised.

398
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:13,711
- Go tell the scops. Spread the word!
- Yes, my Lord.

399
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:20,118
Tomorrow will be
a glorious day of rejoicing.

400
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,098
Our nightmare is over.

401
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,826
Come to bed, my sweet.

402
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:35,532
My kingdom needs an heir!
I need a son! It's time you did your duty.

403
00:44:35,533 --> 00:44:39,208
How can I ever lay with you,
knowing you laid with her?

404
00:44:42,874 --> 00:44:45,115
I should never have told you.

405
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:49,482
I should never have told you.

406
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:14,496
Grendel, my son.

407
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,747
My poor son.

408
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:19,042
Mother...

409
00:45:20,753 --> 00:45:25,048
They hurt me, Mother.

410
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:28,827
Sleep now, my son.

411
00:45:30,805 --> 00:45:35,475
He murdered me, Mother.

412
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:37,768
Who murdered you, my son?

413
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:44,067
He ripped off my arm.

414
00:45:45,371 --> 00:45:49,080
He will pay, my darling.

415
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,783
Who was the man?

416
00:45:53,327 --> 00:45:56,121
He was so strong.

417
00:45:57,582 --> 00:46:01,835
- So strong.
- Who was the man?

418
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:10,176
His...

419
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:14,472
...name was...

420
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:18,768
...Beowulf.

421
00:46:32,052 --> 00:46:33,758
Beowulf.

422
00:46:41,962 --> 00:46:44,499
They were great warriors.

423
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:49,202
They died a foul death.

424
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:53,907
They were murdered by a foul creature
from the depths of hell.

425
00:46:53,908 --> 00:46:57,514
The bards
will sing of their glory forever.

426
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:07,021
Come, let us drink to their memory.

427
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:09,924
I want you to raise the first cup.

428
00:47:09,925 --> 00:47:13,527
I am not in the mood for merrymaking.

429
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:16,736
I'll ride down to the mooring,
prepare the boat.

430
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,206
We still leave tomorrow, on the tide,
do we not?

431
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:25,472
Aye.

432
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:28,852
My thanes, my friends, brothers,

433
00:47:30,812 --> 00:47:35,658
this place for me
has been a hall of sadness.

434
00:47:36,751 --> 00:47:38,319
And for all of us,

435
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,022
it has been a place of misery,
bloodshed, and death.

436
00:47:42,023 --> 00:47:46,194
But today,
the monster's reign has ended.

437
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:50,498
They say he ripped the monster's
limb off with his bare hands.

438
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:54,769
I wonder if Beowulf's strength is only
in his arms, or in his legs as well,

439
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,681
all three of them?

440
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,243
Well, after the feast tonight,
I'm sure you can find out, Gitte.

441
00:48:01,244 --> 00:48:04,679
Me? It's not me he wants, my Queen.

442
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,181
Bring it here!

443
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:08,625
Wealthow, my love,

444
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:12,625
why don't you do the honors?

445
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,842
For you, my Lord.

446
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,090
Thank you, great King.

447
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,557
And all of you,

448
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:52,005
I wish you'd have been there last night
to see me kill the monster.

449
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,164
I was asleep when he arrived.

450
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:59,335
He ripped open the doors
with his bare hands.

451
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:04,707
He stood 20 feet tall,
possessing the strength of 10 men.

452
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:09,624
I looked at him and said,
"I am Beowulf!"

453
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,189
Brave thane.

454
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:58,591
My Queen.

455
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:10,941
I love you.

456
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:13,407
I want you, my King.

457
00:51:14,475 --> 00:51:15,885
Only you.

458
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:20,089
<i>My hero, meen looviyend.</i>

459
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:23,054
I don't understand.

460
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:26,396
Where's your husband?

461
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,095
Dead.

462
00:51:29,957 --> 00:51:31,094
Dead?

463
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:34,804
This is a dream.

464
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:39,199
This is not happening.
You're just a dream.

465
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,180
Me, darling? A dream?

466
00:51:44,038 --> 00:51:49,419
Give me a child.
Enter me and give me a son!

467
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:26,391
In the name of Odin!

468
00:52:27,983 --> 00:52:29,985
Is Grendel not dead?

469
00:52:31,186 --> 00:52:34,288
Has he grown his arm anew?

470
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:36,725
It's not Grendel.

471
00:52:36,726 --> 00:52:39,361
Not Grendel? Then who?

472
00:52:39,362 --> 00:52:40,863
His mother.

473
00:52:42,164 --> 00:52:44,666
It's Grendel you killed.

474
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:49,309
I had hoped his mother
had left the land long, long ago.

475
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,613
How many monsters must I slay?

476
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:58,313
Grendel's mother? Father?
Grendel's uncle?

477
00:52:58,314 --> 00:53:01,750
Must I hack down
a whole family tree of demons?

478
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:03,184
She is the last of them.

479
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:04,619
With her gone,

480
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,290
demonkind will slip back
into the darkness from whence it came.

481
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,891
Where it belongs.

482
00:53:09,892 --> 00:53:14,135
And the mother's mate?
Where is Grendel's father?

483
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:20,814
Grendel's father
can do no harm to man.

484
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:26,551
Beowulf,

485
00:53:27,477 --> 00:53:32,281
I was wrong to doubt you before,
and I shall not again.

486
00:53:32,282 --> 00:53:36,423
Yours is the blood of courage.
I beg your forgiveness.

487
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:40,330
Granted.

488
00:53:40,924 --> 00:53:42,664
Cain! Cain!

489
00:53:52,936 --> 00:53:57,440
Take my sword.
It belonged to my father's father.

490
00:53:57,441 --> 00:53:59,809
It's called "Hrunting."

491
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:03,451
That sword is no match
for demon magic.

492
00:54:04,816 --> 00:54:07,057
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

493
00:54:12,056 --> 00:54:16,595
No, I'm sorry I mentioned
you murdered your brothers.

494
00:54:17,528 --> 00:54:19,871
They were hasty words.

495
00:54:22,767 --> 00:54:26,612
Unferth, I may not return.

496
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,552
Your ancestral sword
might be lost with me.

497
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:36,054
As long as it is with you,
it will never be lost.

498
00:54:45,457 --> 00:54:48,164
And you, mighty Wiglaf,

499
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:53,065
are you still with me?

500
00:54:55,534 --> 00:54:57,035
To the end.

501
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,369
Look.

502
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:34,540
She's probably a water demon.

503
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,575
You don't want to meet her
in her element.

504
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:37,884
I know.

505
00:55:39,245 --> 00:55:42,081
Do you want me to go in with you?

506
00:55:42,082 --> 00:55:43,816
Good.

507
00:55:43,817 --> 00:55:45,352
I'll be here.

508
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:57,263
I see you've brought me treasure.

509
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:03,800
Show yourself!

510
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:07,930
What are you?

511
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:58,925
Are you the one they call Beowulf?

512
00:59:18,703 --> 00:59:20,705
The Bee-Wolf.

513
00:59:22,473 --> 00:59:23,883
The bear.

514
00:59:36,221 --> 00:59:39,497
Such a strong man you are.

515
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:42,830
With the strength of a king.

516
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:47,772
The king you will one day become.

517
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:54,639
What do you know of me, demon?

518
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,110
I know that underneath your glamour

519
00:59:59,111 --> 01:00:03,423
you're as much a monster
as my son, Grendel.

520
01:00:05,684 --> 01:00:07,561
My glamour?

521
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:13,034
One needs glamour to become a king.

522
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:21,071
A man like you could own
the greatest tale ever sung.

523
01:00:22,268 --> 01:00:25,237
Your story would live on

524
01:00:25,238 --> 01:00:30,915
when everything now alive is dust.

525
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:39,660
Beowulf.

526
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:44,990
It has been a long time

527
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:47,767
since a man has come to visit me.

528
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:51,399
I need no sword to kill you.

529
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,740
Of course you don't, my love.

530
01:00:59,273 --> 01:01:01,912
You took a son from me.

531
01:01:03,778 --> 01:01:06,781
Give me a son, brave thane.

532
01:01:09,183 --> 01:01:11,094
Stay with me.

533
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,025
Love me.

534
01:01:16,223 --> 01:01:18,258
Love me

535
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:24,539
and I shall weave you riches
beyond imagination.

536
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,504
I shall make you

537
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:32,979
the greatest king that ever lived.

538
01:01:41,149 --> 01:01:45,786
As long as you hold me in your heart

539
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:51,327
and this golden horn
remains in my keeping,

540
01:01:52,727 --> 01:01:55,264
you will forever be king.

541
01:01:57,933 --> 01:01:59,810
Forever strong,

542
01:02:01,036 --> 01:02:02,674
mighty

543
01:02:03,405 --> 01:02:05,509
and all powerful.

544
01:02:07,142 --> 01:02:10,350
This I promise.

545
01:02:15,016 --> 01:02:19,726
This I swear.

546
01:02:39,442 --> 01:02:40,921
My Lord.

547
01:02:42,812 --> 01:02:45,046
It's dead, my Lady.

548
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:49,918
When I finished off
Grendel's monstrous mother,

549
01:02:49,919 --> 01:02:52,023
I severed the brute's head.

550
01:02:53,222 --> 01:02:54,996
Our curse is lifted.

551
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:58,994
Our curse is lifted. Odin be praised!

552
01:02:58,995 --> 01:03:00,940
Beowulf be praised!

553
01:03:01,931 --> 01:03:03,911
Our curse is lifted.

554
01:03:05,569 --> 01:03:08,606
Take this out of my sight. Unferth!

555
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:11,642
Into the sea, quickly.

556
01:03:14,645 --> 01:03:18,781
I plunged Hrunting
into Grendel's mother's chest

557
01:03:18,782 --> 01:03:22,785
and when I pulled the sword
free from her corpse,

558
01:03:22,786 --> 01:03:25,354
the creature sprang back to life,

559
01:03:25,355 --> 01:03:29,962
so I plunged the sword back into
the hag's chest and there it will stay.

560
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:33,206
Till Ragnarok, huh?

561
01:03:36,633 --> 01:03:40,478
And our people shall be grateful
till the Ragnarok.

562
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:48,879
More mead, my Lord?

563
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,051
Aye.

564
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:55,727
And the drinking horn, do you have it?

565
01:03:56,454 --> 01:03:57,625
No.

566
01:03:59,057 --> 01:04:04,027
I knew the greedy witch desired it,
so I threw it into the swamp.

567
01:04:04,028 --> 01:04:06,463
And when she followed,
that's where I struck,

568
01:04:06,464 --> 01:04:08,967
with the mighty sword Hrunting.

569
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:14,448
When she was dead, I looked for it,
but it was gone forever.

570
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,415
Then find our hero another cup,
my love.

571
01:04:21,279 --> 01:04:24,521
First, the hero and I must talk.

572
01:04:26,118 --> 01:04:27,494
Beowulf.

573
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:38,373
So you brought back
the head of Grendel.

574
01:04:39,198 --> 01:04:41,735
What about the head of the mother?

575
01:04:42,668 --> 01:04:45,570
With her dead and cold in the bog,

576
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:49,075
is it not enough
to return one monster's head?

577
01:04:50,609 --> 01:04:52,281
Did you kill her?

578
01:04:53,045 --> 01:04:57,652
Would you like to hear the story of my
struggle against this monstrous hag?

579
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:03,366
She's no hag, Beowulf.
We both know that.

580
01:05:04,356 --> 01:05:08,498
But answer me, did you kill her?

581
01:05:14,701 --> 01:05:18,876
Would I have been able to escape her,
had I not?

582
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:30,086
Grendel is dead.
That's all that matters to me.

583
01:05:30,617 --> 01:05:32,790
He can bother me no more.

584
01:05:33,553 --> 01:05:38,661
The mother, "the hag,"
she's not my curse.

585
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,064
Not anymore.

586
01:05:43,596 --> 01:05:45,166
Not anymore.

587
01:05:47,634 --> 01:05:49,402
Listen to me!

588
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,246
Listen to me!

589
01:05:54,275 --> 01:05:58,978
Because my Lord Beowulf
is a mighty hero

590
01:05:58,979 --> 01:06:03,383
and because
he killed the demon Grendel

591
01:06:03,384 --> 01:06:06,019
and laid its mother in her grave...

592
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,788
- To Beowulf!
- Long live Beowulf!

593
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:11,963
...and because I have no heir,

594
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,964
I have no sons,

595
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:21,000
I declare that on my death,

596
01:06:21,001 --> 01:06:24,107
all that I possess, my kingdom,

597
01:06:25,072 --> 01:06:28,212
my hall of sadness and shame,

598
01:06:29,176 --> 01:06:32,681
and even my lovely young Queen,

599
01:06:34,883 --> 01:06:36,384
my Wealthow,

600
01:06:39,888 --> 01:06:42,891
everything, everything

601
01:06:46,995 --> 01:06:51,165
I leave to this, our hero.

602
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,509
- But, my Lord...
- I have spoken!

603
01:06:56,371 --> 01:06:57,872
I have spoken!

604
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:03,911
When I am gone,

605
01:07:03,912 --> 01:07:08,451
Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow,
shall be king!

606
01:07:18,294 --> 01:07:19,704
Beowulf!

607
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,868
My Lord.

608
01:07:27,336 --> 01:07:29,782
Everything in its time, Beowulf.

609
01:07:44,153 --> 01:07:45,791
Hrothgar!

610
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:54,036
He must have fallen.

611
01:08:25,395 --> 01:08:30,333
- All hail King Beowulf.
- All hail King Beowulf.

612
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:32,677
All hail King Beowulf.

613
01:08:35,639 --> 01:08:37,380
King Beowulf.

614
01:09:12,544 --> 01:09:14,278
Archers.

615
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,122
Archers!

616
01:09:47,012 --> 01:09:50,014
This is not battle, Wiglaf.

617
01:09:50,015 --> 01:09:51,858
This is slaughter.

618
01:09:53,886 --> 01:09:57,322
The Frisians want to make
themselves heroes, my Lord.

619
01:09:57,323 --> 01:09:59,625
They want the bards
to sing of their deeds.

620
01:09:59,626 --> 01:10:01,760
It's going to be a short song.

621
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:03,295
Now, can you blame them?

622
01:10:03,296 --> 01:10:05,130
Your legend is known
from the high seas

623
01:10:05,131 --> 01:10:07,466
and the snow barriers
to the great island kingdom.

624
01:10:07,467 --> 01:10:09,468
You are the monster slayer.

625
01:10:09,469 --> 01:10:11,915
We men are the monsters now.

626
01:10:13,907 --> 01:10:16,751
The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.

627
01:10:17,777 --> 01:10:20,212
The Christ God has killed it,

628
01:10:20,213 --> 01:10:25,351
leaving humankind with nothing
but weeping martyrs,

629
01:10:25,352 --> 01:10:28,220
fear and shame.

630
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:32,191
Show me to Beowulf!
Show me to King Beowulf!

631
01:10:32,926 --> 01:10:35,227
Come on, Frisian. Speak up!

632
01:10:35,228 --> 01:10:36,729
Leave him!

633
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:40,867
You think it sport
to mock your opponents in this fashion?

634
01:10:40,868 --> 01:10:44,337
Let him die quickly,
with some honor still intact.

635
01:10:44,338 --> 01:10:46,112
Coward!

636
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:48,908
Kill me yourself!

637
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:52,579
Balls! The king
must never engage in direct battle.

638
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:55,782
Kill the invader now! Do it quickly!
Put his head on a spear.

639
01:10:55,783 --> 01:10:56,954
Stop!

640
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:10,674
My Lord, the king
must not engage in direct battle.

641
01:11:13,634 --> 01:11:15,113
Let him up.

642
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,883
You want your name
in the Song of Beowulf?

643
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:29,727
You think it should end with me killed
by some Frisian raider with no name?

644
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,725
I'm Finn of Frisia

645
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:40,961
and my name
shall be remembered forever.

646
01:11:40,962 --> 01:11:43,032
Only if you kill me!

647
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:47,009
Otherwise, you're nothing.

648
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:52,442
You think you're the first to try
to kill me, or the hundredth?

649
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:57,211
Well, let me tell you something, Frisian.

650
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,715
The gods will not allow my death
by your feeble blade.

651
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:05,387
The gods will not allow me to die
by a sword, or be taken by the sea.

652
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:09,734
The gods will not let me
pass in my sleep, ripe with age!

653
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:16,998
Plant your ax here, Finn of Frisia.
Take my life.

654
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:20,105
Someone give him a sword, or I'll...

655
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,041
You'll what? Kill me?

656
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:29,354
Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

657
01:12:46,597 --> 01:12:49,668
You know why you can't kill me,
my friend?

658
01:12:51,535 --> 01:12:56,177
'Cause I died many, many years ago
when I was young.

659
01:13:02,346 --> 01:13:05,081
Give him a gold piece
and send him home.

660
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:07,186
He has a story to tell.

661
01:13:36,314 --> 01:13:37,849
Your Majesty?

662
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,151
Are you hurt?

663
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,355
Not a scratch.

664
01:13:50,628 --> 01:13:52,698
So beautiful.

665
01:13:54,065 --> 01:13:55,874
And so young.

666
01:13:56,501 --> 01:13:59,536
You know, Ursula, when I was young,

667
01:13:59,537 --> 01:14:03,674
I used to think being a king
was about battling every morning

668
01:14:03,675 --> 01:14:06,343
and counting the gold
and loot in the afternoon

669
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:09,587
and swiving beautiful women
every evening.

670
01:14:11,183 --> 01:14:16,098
But now, well, nothing is as good
as it should have been.

671
01:14:17,289 --> 01:14:21,760
Not even the "swiving a beautiful woman
every night" part, Your Majesty?

672
01:14:24,697 --> 01:14:27,439
Well, some nights, Ursula, some nights.

673
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:30,501
Perhaps tonight?

674
01:14:30,502 --> 01:14:34,539
No, tonight, I feel my age upon me.

675
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,952
Tomorrow, after the celebrations.

676
01:14:37,476 --> 01:14:40,545
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

677
01:14:40,546 --> 01:14:44,616
Your day.
When the Song of Beowulf is told

678
01:14:44,617 --> 01:14:47,654
of how you lifted the darkness
from the land.

679
01:14:48,787 --> 01:14:53,259
And the day after,
we celebrate the birth of Hallend Christ.

680
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:01,112
I see you've survived.

681
01:15:04,905 --> 01:15:06,816
Alas, my Queen,

682
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:11,577
the Frisian invaders
have been pushed into the sea.

683
01:15:11,578 --> 01:15:13,946
You are not a widow,

684
01:15:13,947 --> 01:15:14,982
yet.

685
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:20,559
How comforting, my husband.

686
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:26,428
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

687
01:16:31,259 --> 01:16:32,760
Unferth.

688
01:16:33,562 --> 01:16:36,697
You're not celebrating
your King's glory tonight?

689
01:16:36,698 --> 01:16:38,939
I have something for the King.

690
01:16:39,735 --> 01:16:41,235
What is it?

691
01:16:41,236 --> 01:16:44,271
I said I have something for the King.

692
01:16:44,272 --> 01:16:46,774
- Show it to me.
- I will not.

693
01:16:46,775 --> 01:16:48,982
You will show it to me first.

694
01:16:49,277 --> 01:16:51,212
Bollocks, Wiglaf.

695
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:54,015
I'll show it first to Beowulf.
The King needs to see it.

696
01:16:54,016 --> 01:16:55,392
The King

697
01:16:56,452 --> 01:16:58,261
needs to see what?

698
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:10,033
Lost and now found.

699
01:17:19,308 --> 01:17:21,754
A gift fit for a king.

700
01:17:25,481 --> 01:17:27,483
Do you recognize it?

701
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:33,855
Where did you find this?

702
01:17:33,856 --> 01:17:39,128
On the moors. My slave Cain found it
on the barren hill where nothing grows.

703
01:17:39,129 --> 01:17:42,769
I beat him for treading near
such an unholy place.

704
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:45,745
My Lord,

705
01:17:47,504 --> 01:17:49,005
isn't this...

706
01:18:02,152 --> 01:18:03,995
So, Lord Beowulf,

707
01:18:10,127 --> 01:18:14,803
it's come back to you,
after all these years.

708
01:18:16,834 --> 01:18:19,603
My Lord, this is the slave who found it.

709
01:18:19,604 --> 01:18:21,939
Please, please don't kill me!

710
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:25,109
Where did you find this treasure?

711
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:28,112
I'm sorry I ran away, Master.
But please don't hurt me no more.

712
01:18:28,113 --> 01:18:30,058
- Answer your King!
- Stop!

713
01:18:31,116 --> 01:18:32,390
Stop.

714
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:40,628
Where?

715
01:18:41,559 --> 01:18:44,301
Up, up on the moors.

716
01:18:45,797 --> 01:18:49,073
But I was gonna bring it back, Master.
I swear.

717
01:18:50,468 --> 01:18:51,912
Is that all?

718
01:18:53,605 --> 01:18:56,210
No demon? No witch?

719
01:18:58,977 --> 01:19:00,319
No woman?

720
01:19:11,657 --> 01:19:15,827
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

721
01:19:15,828 --> 01:19:21,799
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

722
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:27,443
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

723
01:19:32,111 --> 01:19:36,714
Look at you. You're nothing,

724
01:19:36,715 --> 01:19:39,517
an empty nothing.

725
01:19:39,518 --> 01:19:41,386
Come forth!

726
01:19:41,387 --> 01:19:43,424
Show yourself!

727
01:19:45,926 --> 01:19:48,872
Even with all your riches,

728
01:19:49,896 --> 01:19:53,639
your kingdom, your power, your glory

729
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:56,981
and your women.

730
01:19:59,806 --> 01:20:04,118
Which one do you think
I should kill first,

731
01:20:05,178 --> 01:20:08,614
your pretty little bedwarmer,

732
01:20:08,615 --> 01:20:11,391
or your wise Queen?

733
01:20:14,054 --> 01:20:15,658
What are you?

734
01:20:19,759 --> 01:20:22,262
I'm something you left behind,

735
01:20:23,897 --> 01:20:24,899
Father!

736
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:52,260
Another restless night?

737
01:20:58,299 --> 01:21:00,142
It's all right, girl.

738
01:21:01,002 --> 01:21:03,004
I'm not going to eat you.

739
01:21:11,546 --> 01:21:13,719
He has bad dreams.

740
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,093
They've been coming more often.

741
01:21:18,287 --> 01:21:21,734
He's a king, and kings
have a lot on their conscience.

742
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,433
He calls your name in his sleep.

743
01:21:33,468 --> 01:21:34,947
Does he?

744
01:21:40,842 --> 01:21:44,653
I believe he still holds you in his heart.

745
01:21:46,515 --> 01:21:47,823
Do you?

746
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:53,423
I often wonder

747
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:57,359
what happened.

748
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,839
To us?

749
01:22:04,667 --> 01:22:06,544
Too many secrets.

750
01:22:13,142 --> 01:22:15,121
God, help us.

751
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:45,547
What? What do you want of me?

752
01:22:47,044 --> 01:22:51,356
I have a message for my father.

753
01:22:52,383 --> 01:22:54,726
Tell me! What did this?

754
01:22:54,852 --> 01:22:59,288
I saw our whole village burn.
Children screaming as they died!

755
01:22:59,289 --> 01:23:02,358
I saw it, Your Majesty,
vomiting fire and smoke!

756
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:04,360
Damn you! What was it?

757
01:23:04,361 --> 01:23:05,840
A dragon!

758
01:23:07,064 --> 01:23:09,407
- It's Unferth, my Lord!
- Unferth.

759
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,979
You say a dragon did this? Stop!

760
01:23:15,774 --> 01:23:18,618
You had an agreement.

761
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,545
You would not be harmed.

762
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:24,581
But now the golden horn
has returned to you.

763
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:27,184
The agreement is ended.

764
01:23:27,185 --> 01:23:29,319
Who? Who said that?

765
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,663
"The sins of the fathers!"

766
01:23:32,624 --> 01:23:35,793
That's the last thing I heard.

767
01:23:35,794 --> 01:23:40,297
The last thing before
my family was burned alive!

768
01:23:40,298 --> 01:23:43,074
The sins of the fathers!

769
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,439
Sins of the fathers!

770
01:23:48,139 --> 01:23:50,676
The sins of the fathers!

771
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:54,787
The sins of the fathers!

772
01:24:00,753 --> 01:24:04,489
Take up your positions along
the northern edge of the great gorge.

773
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:07,358
It is our only hope if I fail.

774
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:08,701
My Lord.

775
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:14,499
Don't go, I beg you!

776
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,946
You are free. I release you.

777
01:24:18,237 --> 01:24:22,340
Find a good man and bear him children.
But bear him a son.

778
01:24:22,341 --> 01:24:24,342
I don't want anyone else. I want you.

779
01:24:24,343 --> 01:24:27,011
I am not the man you think me to be!

780
01:24:27,012 --> 01:24:31,416
You're a great man! And a hero!
This I know to be true.

781
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:34,363
Then you are as foolish
as the rest of them!

782
01:24:48,335 --> 01:24:50,569
Very impressive, dear.

783
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:54,040
But the armor suited you better
when you were younger.

784
01:24:55,509 --> 01:24:57,215
I'm sure it did.

785
01:25:02,148 --> 01:25:04,783
Why don't you take that poor girl

786
01:25:04,784 --> 01:25:08,187
and live out your remaining years
in peace?

787
01:25:08,188 --> 01:25:10,861
Let some young hero save us.

788
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:12,395
What?

789
01:25:12,926 --> 01:25:16,567
And let the nightmare
start all over again?

790
01:25:18,132 --> 01:25:22,080
No. I visited this horror
upon my kingdom.

791
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:26,412
- I must be the one to finish her.
- Her.

792
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:32,955
Was she so beautiful, Beowulf?

793
01:25:35,016 --> 01:25:36,893
A beauty so costly?

794
01:25:43,157 --> 01:25:47,230
Beautiful, and full of fine promises.

795
01:25:52,099 --> 01:25:53,805
I was weak.

796
01:25:56,637 --> 01:25:58,241
I am sorry.

797
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:03,549
So, so sorry.

798
01:26:08,517 --> 01:26:11,395
I have always loved you, my Queen.

799
01:26:14,122 --> 01:26:15,623
And I you.

800
01:26:26,234 --> 01:26:28,145
Keep a memory of me,

801
01:26:29,204 --> 01:26:31,843
not as a king or a hero,

802
01:26:33,508 --> 01:26:35,043
but as a man,

803
01:26:36,411 --> 01:26:38,356
fallible and flawed.

804
01:26:55,565 --> 01:26:57,633
This is the place.

805
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:00,239
Where you slayed Grendel's mother.

806
01:27:04,107 --> 01:27:06,951
Wiglaf, I have no sons,

807
01:27:07,977 --> 01:27:12,447
and if this demon kills me,
I have arranged with the heralds

808
01:27:12,448 --> 01:27:13,882
that you shall be king.

809
01:27:13,883 --> 01:27:16,454
Don't speak of such things, my Lord.

810
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:23,493
Great friend,
there is something you should know.

811
01:27:23,494 --> 01:27:26,362
Nay! There is nothing I should know.

812
01:27:26,363 --> 01:27:29,699
You are Beowulf.
Beowulf the mighty, the hero!

813
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,301
The slayer and destroyer of demons!

814
01:27:32,302 --> 01:27:34,837
Now, let us kill this flying devil
where it sleeps

815
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:37,215
and get on with our bloody lives!

816
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:45,220
- Do you want me to go in with you?
- No.

817
01:27:47,084 --> 01:27:48,358
Good.

818
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:36,312
Beowulf.

819
01:28:37,368 --> 01:28:39,973
It has been a long time.

820
01:28:47,079 --> 01:28:51,823
Take your damned horn
and leave my land in peace.

821
01:28:55,287 --> 01:28:57,630
Too late, my love.

822
01:29:18,878 --> 01:29:20,857
Odin's swifan balls!

823
01:29:29,723 --> 01:29:31,668
It's heading for Herot!

824
01:30:35,156 --> 01:30:36,760
Now!

825
01:30:45,566 --> 01:30:47,136
Hrothgar.

826
01:31:57,907 --> 01:32:00,944
Come on, come on!
Come on! Come on!

827
01:32:12,588 --> 01:32:13,897
Damn you!

828
01:32:20,397 --> 01:32:23,844
I'll have your lizard head on a spike!

829
01:34:34,401 --> 01:34:36,107
No!

830
01:36:30,486 --> 01:36:31,896
My Lord!

831
01:37:01,217 --> 01:37:05,358
No!

832
01:38:36,582 --> 01:38:39,250
Over here! Attend the Queen.

833
01:38:39,251 --> 01:38:41,458
- Attend the Queen.
- Attend the Queen.

834
01:40:24,258 --> 01:40:27,204
I told you we were too old to be heroes.

835
01:40:28,863 --> 01:40:31,064
Let's get you to a healer.

836
01:40:31,065 --> 01:40:33,101
Not this time, old friend.

837
01:40:33,768 --> 01:40:36,103
You are Beowulf.

838
01:40:36,104 --> 01:40:39,608
A little thing like this
isn't going to finish you off.

839
01:40:40,342 --> 01:40:43,049
Do you hear her?

840
01:40:45,948 --> 01:40:47,722
I hear nothing.

841
01:40:48,984 --> 01:40:51,886
Grendel's mother,
my son's mother, my...

842
01:40:51,887 --> 01:40:53,688
- No, my Lord.
- My...

843
01:40:53,689 --> 01:40:57,068
You killed Grendel's mother
when we were young.

844
01:40:58,494 --> 01:41:00,132
They sing of it.

845
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:04,310
Too late for lies, Wiglaf.

846
01:41:06,635 --> 01:41:08,114
Too late.

847
01:42:15,406 --> 01:42:16,850
He was

848
01:42:18,275 --> 01:42:20,414
the bravest of us.

849
01:42:24,588 --> 01:42:26,548
He was the prince

850
01:42:28,675 --> 01:42:30,427
of all warriors.

851
01:42:34,096 --> 01:42:36,599
His name will live forever.

852
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:50,488
His song shall be sung forever.
