{2259}{2326}Georgie.
{2510}{2570}Shit.
{2648}{2691}Georgina, phone.
{2692}{2721}Georgina.
{2722}{2759}What? What's the matter?
{2760}{2804}/The phone is ringing, sweetheart.
{2805}{2903}I think it's for you.
{3042}{3136}Right. I'll get it.
{3194}{3253}/What's the point of|/having an answerphone
{3254}{3334}if you don't even switch it on.
{3335}{3407}/Oh, shit!
{3423}{3465}/Hello.
{3466}{3565}Daniel, hi. All right, what's|happened? Okay, calm...
{3566}{3676}Oh, that's great news. Mm.
{3731}{3782}/How, how is she?
{3783}{3849}Oh. Ah-ha.
{3850}{3956}Er, no, God, no, I'm really glad|you woke me up to tell me that. Mmm.
{3957}{4035}/Right, well, er... I guess we'll, um,
{4036}{4099}/we'll see you both, er,|/see the three of you soon.
{4100}{4150}/Yeah, er, er,
{4151}{4279}Okay. Well, well done you two. Bye.
{4280}{4325}Rebecca's had her baby.
{4326}{4380}Yes. The, the baby has finally arrived.
{4381}{4421}So, is it a boy or a girl?
{4422}{4459}Er, hair, weight?
{4460}{4493}Um, they didn't say.
{4494}{4532}Name? Does it have a name?
{4533}{4564}Er,
{4565}{4622}Anything. Eye color?
{4623}{4684}Eyes. Eyes. It's got eyes.
{4685}{4795}God, I hope it's got eyes.
{4823}{4904}/Your sister had a baby.|/A brand new little baby!
{4905}{4930}Yay!
{4931}{4961}Get dressed.
{4962}{5014}Are you mad? It's dark out there.
{5015}{5041}We need a present.
{5042}{5077}It's the middle of the night.
{5078}{5111}We need a present.
{5112}{5159}Ok, I will go to the 24 hour garage.
{5160}{5233}Good plan. Get it 20|Bensons and a a Twix.
{5234}{5313}Your sister had a baby.|A teeny, tiny baby.
{5314}{5439}I know, my darling. It's lovely.
{5476}{5544}I'll go to town with mum in|the morning for the present.
{5545}{5617}Good plan.
{5704}{5765}Aren't you excited, just a little?
{5766}{5903}Well, um, now you come to mention it,
{5964}{6009}Ooh, Miss Salt!
{6010}{6130}Can you imagine what it's like to|hold your very own little baby?
{6131}{6205}Not really.
{6311}{6350}Do we have to?
{6351}{6411}Yeah.
{6600}{6631}/I wish you weren't going.
{6632}{6672}It's only for a couple of nights.
{6673}{6707}What time is Robert coming?
{6708}{6744}He's not. Alexandra is.
{6745}{6817}Alexandra? That's a pretty name.
{6818}{6886}She's a failed fashion student|or a model or something.
{6887}{6931}A model?
{6932}{6985}/You know. One of those|/annoying daddy's rich girls
{6986}{7066}/who always gets bailed out. And|/as Daddy is our major financier...
{7067}{7114}She's going to Newcastle with you?
{7115}{7161}No, no. Ireland, next week.
{7162}{7193}What?
{7194}{7238}Oh God, they're here.
{7239}{7297}Couldn't you work with|someone unattractive?
{7298}{7364}Don't worry, darling, she's not my type.
{7365}{7465}She looks a bit like a Russian|tennis player. A male one.
{7466}{7503}/Love you.
{7504}{7583}Yeah, me too!
{8208}{8254}/Hey Brian, she's here.
{8255}{8376}/Your girlfriend's here, Brian.
{8377}{8411}/Morning, Jim.
{8412}{8496}/Morning, boss.
{8559}{8643}Morning, Brian.
{8662}{8685}Morning, boss.
{8686}{8723}How's it going?
{8724}{8781}Everything's fine from|where I'm standing.
{8782}{8860}Tell the rest of the Village People|I don't want to be disturbed.
{8861}{8914}I have a lot of work and I|need to get my head down.
{8915}{9058}Well, you don't have|to. But if you insist.
{9059}{9113}/Hey, Brian-o, watch your hernia.
{9114}{9186}Can someone give Brian a hand?|Looks like he's struggling.
{9187}{9240}No, I'm fine.
{9241}{9335}/Too heavy for you?
{9360}{9463}/You big girl's blouse.
{9720}{9749}Mum!
{9750}{9793}/Hello!
{9794}{9856}Hello!
{9894}{9985}You look so good. How are you?
{9986}{10017}I'm fine.
{10018}{10121}Oh, my goodness. This looks a bit grand.
{10122}{10157}It's exciting.
{10158}{10278}I should think it's very pricey.
{10279}{10416}Now, darling, don't get carried away.
{10455}{10491}Holy...
{10492}{10552}Shit!
{10698}{10760}Hello.
{10925}{10985}Oh, look, little dragonflies.
{10986}{11053}/I know.
{11058}{11124}/Your biological clock is ticking,
{11125}{11175}/and you can't turn it back.
{11176}{11290}/But for some women, this issue|/may be of even greater concern
{11291}{11379}/and for those women, Doctor Dupompe
{11380}{11452}/is the leading physician in|/the field of infertility.
{11453}{11531}/The early menopause can affect as many
{11532}{11661}/as one in every four|/women, even as young as 34.
{11662}{11704}Just like poor old Harriet.
{11705}{11802}Auntie Harry? Hairy Harry? I|thought she was just a lesbian.
{11803}{11843}/Come here, darling!
{11844}{11956}/That Harriet. She always|/had problems down below.
{11957}{12049}/Dr Dupompe could be your|/hope in a barren world.
{12050}{12127}/Symptoms include weight gain
{12128}{12238}/headaches, changes in body odor,
{12239}{12319}/and an increase in facial hair.
{12320}{12384}/If it wasn't for Doctor Dupompe,
{12385}{12426}/I would have remained childless.
{12427}{12519}/To put your mind at|/rest, why not visit us
{12520}{12654}/at Dupompe Fertility Care. We care.
{12722}{12744}I'll take it.
{12745}{12795}It's 150 pounds!
{12796}{12870}Wrap it up.
{13024}{13064}Come on, we're going to be late.
{13065}{13170}Calm down. It's just over there.
{13171}{13280}/Oh, darling, please, slow down.
{13281}{13405}So, Arabella has found me|the most fabulous new guru
{13406}{13485}who is going to change my life,|and I have an appointment with her
{13486}{13598}today at three o'clock. So, think|I'll make it? Or should I call her?
{13599}{13635}Alright, I'll just call her.
{13636}{13680}Darling, you know I'm there for you,
{13681}{13737}but couldn't you have waited for Zak?
{13738}{13806}I'm 33 years old, and early|menopause runs in my family.
{13807}{13861}My mum is a good Catholic,|I'm an only child,
{13862}{13930}and Auntie Harry has a|mustache. Do the maths!
{13931}{14030}Look, I've had five periods last|year. Five out of a possible 12.
{14031}{14059}Alright.
{14060}{14149}Not another word.
{14257}{14320}/Hello, Dupompe Fertility Clinic.
{14321}{14400}Hope you're not as sterile as this room.
{14401}{14504}How kind. Remind me|again why you're here.
{14505}{14568}What does Zak think|about all of this anyway?
{14569}{14614}Oh. Mmm.
{14615}{14676}Oh, brilliant.
{14677}{14754}Look, he's working really hard,|I don't want to worry him.
{14755}{14835}And you know he gets funny|about women's bits and babies.
{14836}{14920}Darling, you're going to scare|the living daylights out of him.
{14921}{14961}I want a baby more than anything.
{14962}{15039}I know it's a hideous concept to|you but could you, for once just
{15040}{15157}be nice and supportive and|agree with everything I say?
{15158}{15207}/Hello? Yes, of course.
{15208}{15302}/Miss Salt, please.
{15357}{15409}/And this is my best friend Clem.
{15410}{15456}Hello to Miss Clem.
{15457}{15575}Who looks like a very|healthy young lady.
{15576}{15613}Oh.
{15614}{15673}Thank you for seeing me|on such short notice.
{15674}{15728}/It's always a pleasure|/to see young women
{15729}{15824}/who take their fertility|/health seriously.
{15825}{15895}/Miss Clem, do you have 'des enfants'?
{15896}{15986}What, me? No. Not even 'des' goldfish.
{15987}{16044}I don't want to ruin my physique.
{16045}{16087}/Such a pity, no? So,
{16088}{16150}down to business, yes?
{16151}{16187}Yes.
{16188}{16334}Now, laparoscopy is|a very light surgery.
{16351}{16418}There is no scars whatsoever.
{16419}{16507}It's just a little peek at the ovaries.
{16508}{16553}Well, it should be free, then.
{16554}{16626}Thank you, Clem. When will we|know that everything is okay?
{16627}{16721}Soon enough. Well, I'm sure|a healthy young lady like you
{16722}{16865}has nothing to worry about.|Okay? Shall we get started?
{16866}{17033}Your best, best friend can come|back for you in about three hours.
{17034}{17123}Right. Good luck.
{17182}{17264}And no funny business. I'm a lawyer.
{17265}{17332}Mmm-hmm.
{17402}{17470}/Nurse, prepare five|/milligrams to start with.
{17471}{17507}/Yes, doctor.
{17508}{17582}/Thank you.
{17625}{17681}/Calm down, Miss Salt.
{17682}{17822}/We'll just put you|/into a twilight sleep.
{17823}{17881}Hmm.
{18313}{18345}Hi!
{18346}{18370}Hello!
{18371}{18418}I'm glad you're back.
{18419}{18458}Ooh!
{18459}{18537}We're going to a party at your|sister's house for the baby.
{18538}{18640}What? Now? You are joking?
{18641}{18715}Okay, okay.
{18954}{19022}Don't wind Daniel up about|his 'Chelsea tractor. '
{19023}{19070}Don't get pissed and do the crap joke.
{19071}{19105}The elephant is very funny.
{19106}{19142}In front of your mother?
{19143}{19201}And at least pretend you're|interested in the baby.
{19202}{19262}Okay!
{19295}{19341}Hello.
{19342}{19385}Hello, darling.
{19386}{19421}Congratulations.
{19422}{19490}/Ah, yeah.
{19491}{19570}Eyes. It's got eyes.|Two of them. Told you.
{19571}{19647}They generally come with eyes.
{19648}{19748}/Cor, It's got a kind|/of squidged up face
{19749}{19842}as well. It's all sort|of squidgy. Just there.
{19843}{19912}How nice of you to point|out the squidginess.
{19913}{20029}But 'it' is a she. Your niece, Arabella.
{20030}{20169}/Oh, it's not... it's|/not doing a shit, is it?
{20170}{20253}No, she's yawning.
{20254}{20281}/Oh.
{20282}{20348}She's so beautiful, look at her.
{20349}{20383}/Yeah, God, love her.
{20384}{20480}Is there any, um...?
{20505}{20529}Can l...?
{20530}{20587}Have her? By all means.
{20588}{20683}I lost all feeling in my|left arm 20 minutes ago.
{20684}{20715}Hello.
{20716}{20757}/It's not good for my nether regions
{20758}{20812}/to be sitting in the|/one place for too long.
{20813}{20901}Jesus Christ, what is that?!
{20902}{21046}That's me. It's what's|called a belly cast.
{21047}{21100}/God, that's amazing.
{21101}{21190}/It took forever.
{21487}{21514}/It's funny.
{21515}{21577}/I wasn't keen at first
{21578}{21617}/but I'm really glad that Daniel
{21618}{21653}/persuaded me to get it done.
{21654}{21721}There you go. Don't touch it.
{21722}{21787}/It's a perfect reminder|/of a precious time.
{21788}{21888}And a constant reminder of|why I have stretch marks.
{21889}{21999}It's a small price to pay.
{22001}{22054}/Uh-oh.
{22055}{22130}/My poor belly.
{22131}{22239}/I didn't, that wasn't...
{22290}{22363}/That was... right, that was...
{22364}{22385}What you doing?
{22386}{22451}/Sorry.
{22454}{22501}Well, don't walk off like that, I mean,
{22502}{22574}someone is gonna have to clear it up.
{22575}{22610}/Oh.
{22611}{22671}Kids!
{22732}{22781}Well, that didn't go too badly.
{22782}{22831}That was you, wasn't it?
{22832}{22942}What? That little boy|was running around...
{22943}{22994}You smashed your sister's sculpture.
{22995}{23034}Yeah.
{23035}{23103}It's bad enough you broke it,|but you blame a three year-old.
{23104}{23133}I'm sorry.
{23134}{23174}You couldn't care less.
{23175}{23221}Well, you know...
{23222}{23306}Exactly. How could I ever think you'd|be responsible enough to be a father?
{23307}{23343}Overreaction!
{23344}{23435}/What's the point?
{23539}{23690}Rebecca is looking well,|isn't she... darling?
{23691}{23749}Yes.
{23784}{23840}Bizarrely, this baby|lark seems to suit her.
{23841}{23952}Why would the concept of a baby|suiting someone be so bizarre to you?
{23953}{23997}I'm just saying my sister is doing well.
{23998}{24073}Strange that she's three years|younger but much more mature.
{24074}{24117}That's your opinion.
{24118}{24193}You've won every prize possible|for your documentaries.
{24194}{24247}What more do you need|to prove you're ready?
{24248}{24346}/You can't keep avoiding the issue.|/Just tell me why do you hate...
{24347}{24397}/I do not hate babies! Okay?
{24398}{24442}How'd you know I was gonna say "babies"?
{24443}{24500}/Stop the car.
{24501}{24542}/No, I'm not gonna stop the car.
{24543}{24585}It's all about you, isn't it?
{24586}{24629}What about what makes me happy?
{24630}{24665}/All right then.
{24666}{24693}/Good!
{24694}{24735}/Idiot!
{24736}{24780}Hmpf!
{24781}{24865}Georgina, get back in the|car, you're being ridiculous.
{24866}{24906}All right, we'll talk.
{24907}{24976}I don't wanna talk to a babyaphobe.
{24977}{25031}If you won't give me what I need,
{25032}{25078}then I'll find someone else who will.
{25079}{25170}You mark my words.
{25245}{25331}Where you going?
{25538}{25610}Fuck sake.
{25614}{25684}Fuck off!
{25913}{25990}You can stay here as long as it takes.
{25991}{26045}Yeah, thanks, mate.
{26046}{26117}Just give her a couple of|days, she'll calm down.
{26118}{26219}/You know what they're like.
{26220}{26250}/Women.
{26251}{26325}Yes, women.
{26370}{26396}Who would have them?
{26397}{26414}/Me.
{26415}{26436}Yeah.
{26437}{26473}And you.
{26474}{26568}If she'd let you back in your|flat... Which she won't.
{26569}{26616}Well... just leave her to sweat it out.
{26617}{26700}I'll be back from Ireland in a couple|of weeks. She'll be all over me.
{26701}{26851}You should never have put the words|"hate" and "baby" in the same sentence.
{26852}{26885}Big mistake?
{26886}{26953}/She's not getting any younger, is she?
{26954}{27074}No. She's not a spring chicken.
{27075}{27169}And in my experience, when|they hit a certain age,
{27170}{27242}they get funny about babies and shite.
{27243}{27348}Bloody biological clock.
{27430}{27503}You know what, Benny boy? You're right.
{27504}{27610}I fancy just chilling here,|sinking a couple of beers...
{27611}{27673}watch some shit on the telly.
{27674}{27791}Just you and me. Couple of big|men having some big man fun.
{27792}{27874}/Zak. Too gay.
{27909}{28046}Yeah, it was a bit, wasn't it? Sorry.
{28654}{28681}Hello?
{28682}{28719}/Miss Salt?
{28720}{28767}/Dr Dupompe would like to see you.
{28768}{28857}Yes, I'll be there.
{28858}{28928}Bollocks!
{29156}{29296}/A woman is born with a|/definitive number of ova
{29297}{29374}and then the shop
{29375}{29440}/shuts.
{29454}{29508}But I have some left?
{29509}{29667}/Madame, I can see only|/one ovum on the right.
{29668}{29789}/Now, you have two|/weeks before you ovulate
{29790}{29825}and then...
{29826}{29895}It's bye-bye baby, hello mustache.
{29896}{30028}Clem! So when exactly do I ovulate?
{30067}{30121}The 22nd,
{30122}{30168}/23rd, 24th and 25th.
{30169}{30215}Oh, the 25th is my birthday.
{30216}{30269}/Then a baby shall be your gift.
{30270}{30332}Now, for these four days,
{30333}{30452}/you will need to spend every|/second with your husband.
{30453}{30489}I don't have a husband.
{30490}{30530}Your boyfriend?
{30531}{30590}No, there's no-one.
{30591}{30681}Can't you just take it out
{30682}{30733}and put it in a lovely little container
{30734}{30782}and cryogenically freeze it for later?
{30783}{30896}/Madame, it's not a sorbet.
{30908}{30999}/May I suggest...?
{31062}{31208}Sperm? I don't want|sperm, I want a baby.
{31496}{31535}Hello!
{31536}{31601}How are you?
{31602}{31622}Are you okay?
{31623}{31697}/It's terrible.
{31698}{31761}Really, really bad. What's happened.
{31762}{31793}Well, what?
{31794}{31851}/I spoke to my guru last night,
{31852}{31926}says that I can't eat chocolate anymore.
{31927}{31987}/That it's blocking all my chakras.
{31988}{32055}/It's just so hard for me to imagine.
{32056}{32128}So... that's it.
{32129}{32234}For the rest of my|life. No chocolate ever.
{32235}{32295}Yeah.
{32296}{32449}Do you have the same|chocolate chakra thing?
{32467}{32549}I have this weird recurring|nightmare, where I wake up,
{32550}{32621}and I'm old and hairy and alone.
{32622}{32685}And I'm actually living my nightmare.
{32686}{32777}/I ordered starters because I|/thought you might be peckish.
{32778}{32860}Listen, you're not hairy|or old, you're beautiful.
{32861}{32933}Thank you.
{33069}{33177}I need more than one egg!
{33182}{33229}You can have mine, if you like.
{33230}{33395}Darling, she's only got|one egg left, down there.
{33412}{33442}/One ovum left.
{33443}{33482}What, you mean...
{33483}{33511}/Yes.
{33512}{33620}/Oh God. Just the one? Oh...
{33621}{33714}That's bad, isn't it? Is that bad?
{33715}{33761}/Listen, listen,
{33762}{33861}/remember when we were 14 and the|/dentist said you needed braces?
{33862}{33942}/We said that we were going|/to go get 10 second opinions
{33943}{34015}/and we did go get ten|/second opinions and
{34016}{34076}all the dentists said|that you needed braces.
{34077}{34125}We don't have time for second opinions.
{34126}{34316}I've got two weeks, I've only|got the one egg left. Just one!
{34317}{34408}Right. Yeah. Um...
{34428}{34491}/I prefer the red to the London stock,
{34492}{34551}/but the red is 1 p more.
{34552}{34601}/It's your choice, boss.
{34602}{34700}This is the local one.
{34701}{34771}Hmm. That one.
{34772}{34799}No, that one.
{34800}{34884}No, er, that one. Hang on a sec.
{34885}{34947}Right.
{35063}{35195}Alexandra, can you get that please?
{35521}{35610}Wait right there.
{35684}{35720}/It wasn't important.
{35721}{35758}Let me know if Georgina calls.
{35759}{35874}I thought you guys broke up.
{36109}{36142}Georgina, I just need...
{36143}{36299}We'll do it later. John,|out, I'm in a hurry.
{37254}{37277}Good morning.
{37278}{37311}I wondered...
{37312}{37369}Hi! Alexandra.
{37370}{37437}Hi. Nice to meet you.
{37438}{37473}Is Zak Solomon in?
{37474}{37503}And you are...
{37504}{37569}Georgina. His... friend.
{37570}{37631}/Funny. He's not mentioned you.
{37632}{37715}/Really? Oh, is he here?
{37716}{37772}Zakkie? You just missed him.
{37773}{37814}He left for Ireland this morning.
{37815}{37884}He wasn't supposed to|leave till tomorrow!
{37885}{37979}Last minute change. He said he|just couldn't wait to get away.
{37980}{38046}You know how impulsive Zakkie is.
{38047}{38122}There must be some way of|contacting him. It's really urgent.
{38123}{38209}His cell phone doesn't|work on the island. Sorry.
{38210}{38277}There must be some way to contact him?
{38278}{38338}I'll be joining him tomorrow,|so leave it with me.
{38339}{38429}I'll tell him to call...|who are you again?
{38430}{38490}Georgina! Can you write it down?
{38491}{38567}He's booked us this quaint little|B & B in the middle of nowhere.
{38568}{38606}Maybe that'll have a land line.
{38607}{38699}No running water or heating, mind you.
{38700}{38810}Just each other... for warmth.
{38811}{38841}Are you and Zak...?
{38842}{38873}/Hello Daddy?
{38874}{38960}It was really nice to|meet you, Geraldine.
{38961}{39050}Daddy, I need more|allowance for my trip.
{39051}{39209}/Yes, to Ireland. Oh,|/really? I'm so excited!
{40334}{40418}You're probably just working too hard.
{40419}{40525}Why don't you take a holiday|with Clem? Find somewhere nice.
{40526}{40574}Go and have some fun.
{40575}{40753}Holidays are for happy people who want|to spend time with their loved ones.
{40754}{40859}Hello! How's my favorite lady?
{40860}{40885}Hello, darling.
{40886}{40907}Hello.
{40908}{40949}Fancy a cuppa?
{40950}{41016}May I have a cappuccino with|extra cream and choccy?
{41017}{41053}Thank you.
{41054}{41158}So, darling, I have done it.
{41159}{41230}I have called Guru Luke,
{41231}{41293}and she said it's all|right to give your "spunk"
{41294}{41419}to a complete stranger. Namaste.
{41461}{41519}So, how long will it|take to get to Scotland?
{41520}{41563}Ireland. We're going to Ireland.
{41564}{41593}Oh.
{41594}{41654}It's probably about a 45-minute flight.
{41655}{41756}Then a boat trip over. Should be|at the hotel by about teatime.
{41757}{41798}Soda rolls and cheese, I expect.
{41799}{41879}Not cheese. It gives me migraines.|Believe me, it's not pretty.
{41880}{41950}I barf like an elephant.
{41951}{42011}Nice.
{42058}{42118}/To the most successful insemination
{42119}{42141}/that will ever be.
{42142}{42200}Yay.
{42237}{42342}Alright, darling, how's the plan?
{42343}{42395}It's in development.
{42396}{42490}/Let's have a look.
{42550}{42586}There's nothing on it.
{42587}{42636}I need your help.
{42637}{42731}/Darling, help her.
{42911}{42938}Don't look.
{42939}{43047}/Stop being such a queen.
{43066}{43125}/How obvious, Justin. Very deep.
{43126}{43179}"Sexy straight man." That's practical.
{43180}{43253}And on Day Four
{43254}{43365}if we erase "sexy" and "straight"
{43366}{43457}/and add "Justin."
{43531}{43639}I think you're very sexy.
{43921}{43999}Just stunning.
{44000}{44085}So close to the mainland,|but so wild and untouched.
{44086}{44200}Oh, yes. We're untouched by|the modern hand of Satan.
{44201}{44274}/Apart from the odd plane or two.
{44275}{44350}Island Life. The Rugged West.
{44351}{44480}Day One, we find ourselves in Inishmaan.
{44481}{44545}/It's the least populated|/of the Aran islands.
{44546}{44587}/It's a wild, rugged beauty
{44588}{44675}which has embraced human|life for over 5, 000 years.
{44676}{44758}Is there a TV?
{44770}{44833}Why waste time doing a TV program
{44834}{44908}/about people who don't own|/a TV? Doesn't make sense.
{44909}{44969}/If every assistant was like you,
{44970}{45040}there'd be a drastic|improvement in viewing quality.
{45041}{45135}You're right there.
{45424}{45479}I don't want any stranger,|someone I know is awkward
{45480}{45541}and we've established the|sperm bank is a no-no.
{45542}{45591}What about "Sexy Brian"?
{45592}{45644}How could I look him|in the face every day?
{45645}{45749}/What about "Sexy Brian"?
{45750}{45787}It's not ethical.
{45788}{45850}/I don't feel we're focused.
{45851}{45957}I really don't. What about a wedding?
{45958}{46080}/Because everyone's really pissed and|/there's loads of love in the room.
{46081}{46115}Yeah, or a Christmas party.
{46116}{46168}In April?
{46169}{46193}Right. A funeral.
{46194}{46224}That's sick.
{46225}{46257}I love it.
{46258}{46290}Yeah, think about it.
{46291}{46356}There are a lot of vulnerable men,
{46357}{46429}/overwhelmed with emotion and|/not thinking too straight,
{46430}{46544}/some alcohol, gorgeous|/Georgie, easy pickings.
{46545}{46657}/I think it's fantastic.|/Alright, so, to review.
{46658}{46733}On Day One you are going to lure
{46734}{46833}a really sexy handpicked stranger|back to your apartment, right?
{46834}{46900}/The only thing to figure out|/is how you're going to lure
{46901}{46953}/the stranger back to your apartment.
{46954}{47008}Then, on Day Two, if|you haven't shagged,
{47009}{47076}then you go to a very|chic, tasteful burial.
{47077}{47169}/The dead man can be no older|/than 40, because he'll have loads
{47170}{47244}/of really sad lonely friends|/you'll have to comfort.
{47245}{47332}On Day Three, if you|haven't shagged by then
{47333}{47418}we'll just have to go to|some club, and you'll just
{47419}{47481}take the first randy stranger.
{47482}{47578}/And take him back to a|/hotel, it's easier to escape.
{47579}{47681}And I do know of a really fabulous|hotel near the club I've in mind.
{47682}{47769}/And if we do get to Day|/Four, Justin, darling, my pet,
{47770}{47844}I'll even get you a hotel room.
{47845}{47909}I think you should|definitely buy some sperm
{47910}{47954}just in case the plan is a flop.
{47955}{48061}/Justin? I think with you|/on hand for the top-up,
{48062}{48167}/this plan is foolproof.
{48858}{48913}So Lizzie decided to get a lodger.
{48914}{48949}She puts one ad in The Post
{48950}{49007}and the first guy that|walks in within 10 seconds
{49008}{49077}they're having sex all|over the apartment. So...
{49078}{49125}No, that's it, that's it.
{49126}{49196}Day One, we advertise your house to let,
{49197}{49265}by luring the Sexy|Stranger to your house.
{49266}{49314}Have to tidy up Zak's stuff.
{49315}{49401}But you're really|getting the hang of it!
{49402}{49481}Oh Clem, look. There's Ben.
{49482}{49529}/Maybe he knows how to get hold of Zak.
{49530}{49566}Oh God.
{49567}{49613}All right?
{49614}{49669}/Stop it, stop it. Don't, don't.
{49670}{49695}Why?
{49696}{49733}Don't call him over, please.
{49734}{49762}Have you and Ben...?
{49763}{49797}/I have not and I never will.
{49798}{49823}All right, girls?
{49824}{49860}Ben!
{49861}{49899}(dryly Hello.
{49900}{49958}Interesting tree?
{49959}{50084}/Yes, I happen to like the bark and|/the leaves on the tree very much.
{50085}{50128}Getting in shape?
{50129}{50237}I don't think there's anything|wrong with my shape, thank you.
{50238}{50294}I know.
{50295}{50378}We're in a park, and|Clem needed a wee, so...
{50379}{50425}The tree gets it.
{50426}{50538}If you don't mind, I'd actually|like a bit of privacy.
{50539}{50589}I'm really glad we bumped into you,
{50590}{50644}I really need to get hold of Zak.
{50645}{50718}Sorry, I don't do|domestics. Keep me out.
{50719}{50799}I know it's a lot to ask,|but it's really urgent.
{50800}{50889}If he gets in touch,|I'll tell him to call.
{50890}{50931}Thanks, Ben.
{50932}{50973}Ben,
{50974}{51026}can you please go back to your friends
{51027}{51082}so I can have a wee? Thanks.
{51083}{51123}Watching is out of the question?
{51124}{51179}Ew.
{51236}{51290}All right, lads, slide it over here.
{51291}{51317}Shut up.
{51318}{51344}I like bark.
{51345}{51399}Shut up. Stop it.
{51400}{51505}What was wrong with you?
{51639}{51690}/Beautiful apartment for rent.
{51691}{51743}/Open for viewing between six and eight.
{51744}{51798}/It's not too early for|/you to have sex, is it?
{51799}{51906}Hello? Yes, it would suit|a young professional person
{51907}{52025}Dark, handsome males in|prime physical condition.
{52026}{52074}/Maybe you'd prefer to place it
{52075}{52117}/in the 'lonely hearts' section?
{52118}{52172}This is a serious advertisement.
{52173}{52229}The apartment just|happens to be very manly.
{52230}{52385}/Of course, madam. Can I take|/your credit card details, please?
{52386}{52489}/Are you sure you want|/to go through with this?
{52490}{52600}I want to be pregnant.|I want to be a mother.
{52601}{52655}I want the whole experience.
{52656}{52790}My whole body is just aching for it.
{52798}{52870}All right.
{52953}{53009}Justin!
{53010}{53057}Justin, for fuck's sake!
{53058}{53135}Sorry, Coco.
{53142}{53202}Hello. Be careful.
{53203}{53225}Hello.
{53226}{53277}Hello.
{53278}{53370}So, Georgie has hundreds of|professional young males
{53371}{53441}coming tomorrow, so can|you make her look fabulous
{53442}{53492}and just do your magicky things?
{53493}{53528}Right.
{53529}{53697}And, Justin, I want to be|sexy but not too slutty.
{53742}{53808}/Only one ovum left.
{53809}{53853}/I need more than one egg.
{53854}{53903}/On Day One, a sexy handpicked stranger
{53904}{53945}/will be lured to your apartment,
{53946}{54102}/but we need to find a|/way to lure him back.
{55188}{55344}"My belly is a welcoming womb|of warmth and willingness."
{55345}{55525}My belly is a welcoming womb|of warmth and willingness.
{55731}{55788}I didn't realize|microphones were so fluffy.
{55789}{55870}The mic is inside.
{55871}{55915}/Do they come in different colors?
{55916}{55959}A pink one would look really cool.
{55960}{56034}Great idea.
{56201}{56256}Ow!
{56296}{56351}So,
{56378}{56497}we'll spend the first few days|shooting G Vs, landscapes, etcetera.
{56498}{56554}Pretty pictures?
{56555}{56597}Yeah, yeah.
{56598}{56673}And when people are used to seeing us,
{56674}{56729}when we've had a few drinks
{56730}{56774}/we can start doing some interviews.
{56775}{56829}Try to fit in, gain people's trust.
{56830}{56881}Integrity, that sort of thing.
{56882}{56988}/Oh, you're so cute and|/so fluffy and adorable!
{56989}{57097}/Zak, take a picture of this!
{57098}{57259}You do realize that donkey|probably has rabies.
{57573}{57634}Are you sure we're|doing the right thing?
{57635}{57782}Stop panicking. It's|really going to be fine.
{57783}{57850}/Darling, what's all this?
{57851}{57911}/I thought I'd make a casual reference
{57912}{57953}and see how compatible we are.
{57954}{58014}/You're not going to marry|/them, you want their sperm.
{58015}{58105}But if I want a nice baby it|helps to have similar interests.
{58106}{58149}Have you prepared your story?
{58150}{58197}Uh, no.
{58198}{58248}/What are you going to|/say about yourself?
{58249}{58309}I'm Georgina Salt, I own|a construction company.
{58310}{58335}No!
{58336}{58368}/No?
{58369}{58402}/No.
{58403}{58465}I'm Georgina Salt, I own|a construction company.
{58466}{58515}No, they don't want|a girl in a hard hat,
{58516}{58631}they want a woman who is strange|and mysterious and fabulous.
{58632}{58719}Strange, mysterious, fabulous.
{58720}{58753}Try these.
{58754}{58815}They're sort of...
{58816}{58893}/They're just...
{58894}{58929}We should go.
{58930}{59002}Good luck.
{59103}{59152}/Hang on. Another dog.
{59153}{59243}No. We asked for handsome|professional males.
{59244}{59306}Quick!
{59312}{59412}Hi. Sorry. Are you here|to rent that apartment?
{59413}{59529}No, I'm so sorry, but it's been|rented by me and my fiance.
{59530}{59601}We're just so in love. Sorry.
{59602}{59667}Oh God.
{59811}{59948}Did you not put "straight" in the ad?
{60231}{60297}Oh God, this is a|complete waste of time.
{60298}{60382}Hello, soldier.
{60507}{60566}Hi. Bob Tushy.
{60567}{60621}You have a really nice place.
{60622}{60658}Thank you.
{60659}{60763}So, where are you heading?
{60764}{60879}Ummm, I've been headhunted|to head-up the head office.
{60880}{60947}It's very exciting stuff.
{60948}{61029}So where's head office? Anywhere nice?
{61030}{61119}Ummm, Kazakhstan.
{61145}{61203}Wow.
{61254}{61350}What will a... beautiful|lady like you do out there?
{61351}{61453}Umm, it's very hush-hush, on the QT, but
{61454}{61595}I'll probably be killed while I'm away.
{61658}{61695}Right.
{61696}{61730}/Would you like to sit down?
{61731}{61791}Okay.
{61920}{61961}Do you like Italian food?
{61962}{61989}I love it.
{61990}{62021}Oh!
{62022}{62065}I started making my own pasta recently.
{62066}{62118}Messy, but it's worth it.
{62119}{62162}What do you make?
{62163}{62292}Linguine, tortellini... All kinds.
{62326}{62353}Do you like France?
{62354}{62432}I just went there on my holidays.
{62433}{62457}Yeah.
{62458}{62514}Oh! Where did you go?
{62515}{62601}Paris, and then Versailles,|which is amazing.
{62602}{62653}I've been there. It's so beautiful.
{62654}{62683}Stunning, really.
{62684}{62742}Yes.
{62766}{62809}Do you like architecture?
{62810}{62884}My sister's an architect.
{62885}{62971}I have a lot of respect|for what she does
{62972}{63033}because, um, she builds things...
{63034}{63131}then, they're always there.
{63132}{63191}/Georgina, darling, it's me!
{63192}{63255}/Baby, if you're there, pick up please!
{63256}{63321}/Hello?
{63330}{63380}/Darling, it's me.
{63381}{63438}/Baby, if you're there,|/can you pick up please?
{63439}{63461}Zak!
{63462}{63501}Darling?
{63502}{63539}/Thank God. I'm so glad you called.
{63540}{63581}Just, um, hold on.
{63582}{63617}Have you got someone there?
{63618}{63644}Mr. Tushy.
{63645}{63672}Hello?
{63673}{63709}I am so sorry, but the apartment
{63710}{63778}has just been rented by a very nice man.
{63779}{63812}Well, maybe I could call.
{63813}{63885}Maybe not.
{63891}{63972}Zak, are you still there? You'll|never guess what's happened.
{63973}{64012}I have to see you.
{64013}{64085}/Zakkie, honey, could you zip me up?
{64086}{64177}Georgie? Georgina?
{64345}{64496}What?! I only asked if|you could zip me up?
{64534}{64614}/I don't understand. Why|/call if he's still with her?
{64615}{64689}Who knows what's running|through his head.
{64690}{64814}/He probably wants|/his pie and his chips.
{64815}{64856}He wouldn't do that.
{64857}{64971}George, he's a man. And|he's selfish, and, darling,
{64972}{65074}he's let you down when|you needed him the most.
{65075}{65155}What do you know about it? You|don't know what it's like, do you?
{65156}{65222}/The longest you've been|/with someone is three weeks.
{65223}{65317}/You don't know what it's like to|/be with someone for the longterm.
{65318}{65421}/That's not true. I was with|/with Greg for one year.
{65422}{65623}Whoop dee doo. You had a teenage|crush on some boy 13 years ago.
{65658}{65785}Did you know that I was pregnant?
{65834}{65904}You know,
{65916}{66002}I was so scared.
{66030}{66080}/And I thought
{66081}{66146}I don't want to get fat.
{66147}{66178}And I want...
{66179}{66305}and I still want to go to parties.
{66306}{66405}And I want to wear|short dresses. So we...
{66406}{66502}I made the decision.
{66567}{66653}And it was gone.
{66664}{66710}/And I thought, "Right,
{66711}{66886}now everything's going to just|go back to normal" and...
{66887}{66909}/he left.
{66910}{66992}/I'm so sorry.
{66994}{67081}Do you know that he used to...
{67082}{67128}kiss me right here...
{67129}{67203}/to wake me up in the morning...
{67204}{67336}/Just move the hair out of my eyes.
{67382}{67473}/Fucking coconuts.
{67493}{67601}He always smelled of coconut shampoo.
{67602}{67650}Oh, Clem.
{67651}{67747}Why didn't you tell me? I would have|been there. I would have helped you.
{67748}{67799}I didn't tell you because|I don't want to be
{67800}{67937}one of those really sad dreary women.
{68047}{68167}You won't be. I won't let you.
{68196}{68309}And I won't let you either.
{68351}{68423}Come here.
{68673}{68720}/My belly is a welcoming womb
{68721}{68834}/of warmth and willingness.
{69427}{69477}"I am a fertile female
{69478}{69550}"full of fecundity and fruitfulness.

{69823}{69853}Come on!

{69897}{70091}You are about as much use as an|ejector seat in a helicopter!
{70152}{70262}Come on, Georgie, pick up.
{70269}{70358}No signal. Great.
{70526}{70575}(Clem So many men, so little time.

{70699}{70759}Come on.
{70760}{70793}Hello!
{70794}{70829}Hello.
{70830}{70882}Hi. Our friend seems|to have disappeared.
{70883}{70941}Can we get a lift to the|party? I mean, the wake?
{70942}{70979}Sure. Hop in. I'm Malcolm.
{70980}{71001}Georgina.
{71002}{71030}Clem.
{71031}{71069}There you go.
{71070}{71142}Thank you.
{71406}{71511}/This one is for Benny boy.
{71512}{71610}This looks promising.
{71635}{71700}Bubbly.
{71730}{71793}Excuse me, darling,|how did you know Benny?
{71794}{71849}Everyone knew Benny.
{71850}{71880}Hello. Thank you.
{71881}{72003}He owned the club. Boy's Night.
{72052}{72167}/Yeah, you're with me, love.
{72278}{72336}Isn't this great? They|are well up for it.
{72337}{72375}If I can't pull one of this lot,
{72376}{72498}you might as well shoot me now.
{72541}{72654}I better load both barrels.
{73623}{73658}They're...
{73659}{73687}Yes.
{73688}{73740}All of them?
{73741}{73837}Well, maybe not them.
{73838}{73887}But the rest?
{73888}{73965}At a guess, yes.
{73966}{74098}/Hello. Dressing down for this one.
{74380}{74413}Do you mind?
{74414}{74484}Carry on.
{74587}{74622}/He would have loved this.
{74623}{74648}Who?
{74649}{74714}Well, Benny.
{74715}{74815}Oh, yes. He would, wouldn't he?
{74816}{74869}I'm James, by the way.|Benny's accountant.
{74870}{74903}Oh, his ex-accountant.
{74904}{74941}You're his ex-accountant?
{74942}{75031}No, I mean you are with him|being dead and everything.
{75032}{75104}Oh, right.
{75170}{75255}It's a nice disco, isn't it?|Do you like disco dancing?
{75256}{75332}Mm. My girlfriend,|well, my ex-girlfriend
{75333}{75409}I danced like I had a poker|up my arse, which put me off.
{75410}{75449}No shit?!
{75450}{75510}Yeah.
{75582}{75649}Right. Well, it was nice|to meet you, um...?
{75650}{75707}Georgina. I'll look out|for the poker dancing.
{75708}{75758}/I'm afraid you'll be|/looking for a while.
{75759}{75823}I'm off home. It's been a long day.
{75824}{75903}Oh, er, wait... could I, um,
{75904}{76010}could I go home with you?|I mean, wait, sorry,
{76011}{76128}could I get a lift|home to my home? Um...
{76129}{76181}Would I have to dance?
{76182}{76302}Um, dancing is not obligatory.
{76323}{76400}I'd love to.
{76902}{76976}I'm sorry about the mess. I've|been so busy with work lately.
{76977}{77008}Busy, busy, busy.
{77009}{77086}Yes... Busy.
{77171}{77265}Oh, it's... homely.
{77418}{77509}Would you like some wine before...?
{77510}{77605}Wine would be lovely before...
{77606}{77757}Um, take a seat, make|yourself comfortable.
{77987}{78087}It was so sad when I|heard about... Benny.
{78088}{78152}/It was such a shock.
{78153}{78215}Well, he liked to take risks, didn't he?
{78216}{78326}/I suppose knowing he lived his|/life to the full is some comfort.
{78327}{78456}/We had some crazy times together.
{78474}{78548}/Did you now?
{78549}{78579}Like what, exactly?
{78580}{78657}The usual crazy stuff. It's madness.
{78658}{78706}Anyway, let's not talk about Benny.
{78707}{78763}/It's so sad. Let's just talk about us.
{78764}{78836}Yes. Let's.
{78837}{78898}Oh, shit.
{78899}{78956}Hm. Shit just about covers it.
{78957}{79084}Oh. Er, no, er, look,|it's very complicated.
{79085}{79135}No, it's very simple. "Day one"
{79136}{79191}No, you don't understand.|Some more wine?
{79192}{79319}What kind of sick person are you?
{79374}{79409}/And for the record,
{79410}{79542}your flat has gone way past homely.
{79811}{79878}/I need more than one egg.
{79879}{79939}/I don't want sperm, I want a baby.
{79940}{80096}/22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th.|/Zak, where are you?
{80258}{80314}/Oh, Zak, where are you?
{80315}{80420}/Let's get you something|/nice for your birthday.
{80421}{80469}What do you need, dear?
{80470}{80521}They don't sell what I need here.
{80522}{80573}I don't feel like partying this year.
{80574}{80616}All right, love.
{80617}{80773}But at least let me make|you a birthday cake.
{81102}{81168}Why don't we split up and|we'll have it done in no time?
{81169}{81255}All right, love.
{82062}{82101}/Someone likes his nuts!
{82102}{82160}Mom!
{82221}{82295}Nice young man.
{82296}{82425}Now, dear, have we got everything?
{82624}{82690}What may be boring for you|may not be for other people.
{82691}{82733}Christ, if it's...
{82734}{82789}You can't say that, okay? Not here.
{82790}{82827}Jesus.
{82828}{82915}Or that! They'd prefer if you swore.
{82916}{82957}You'd be better off with a "shit."
{82958}{83014}Or, just a good loud "fuck."
{83015}{83059}Hi.
{83060}{83173}Welcome. Please, follow me.
{83401}{83502}Upstairs are the dormitories|and the prayer rooms.
{83503}{83643}Not you, sir. Only the|young lady can come.
{83644}{83714}Um, uh...
{83795}{83841}Look... if you want decent funding
{83842}{83888}for this precious series of yours,
{83889}{83950}it's gonna have to be great, not good.
{83951}{84022}/So just relax, and let|/me do what I do best.
{84023}{84066}And what is that, exactly?
{84067}{84114}Girl talk.
{84115}{84194}Hey! Wait up!
{84761}{84857}Beautiful, isn't it?
{84872}{84902}Yeah.
{84903}{84991}/A mother and her newborn child.
{84992}{85077}/Creation. Nothing is more divine.
{85078}{85161}/I suppose not.
{85162}{85284}I wouldn't have thought that|you think about that stuff.
{85285}{85395}You know, you being a nun.
{85481}{85534}Must be hard for you.
{85535}{85609}For a woman to... give that up.
{85610}{85795}I think for me, as a woman...|it's the hardest sacrifice.
{85955}{86053}I think you're right.
{86547}{86643}Oh, Zak. I miss you.
{86836}{86901}/Brian.
{86925}{86956}You all right, boss?
{86957}{87026}Sorry, I didn't get much sleep.
{87027}{87072}I hope he was worth it.
{87073}{87175}There's nothing like that going|on at all. Zak and I broke up.
{87176}{87219}Oh great.
{87220}{87327}It's not, because I just told you|my six-year relationship has ended.
{87328}{87368}So, it's not great.
{87369}{87445}No, it's not great for you, and|it's not great for him, but...
{87446}{87542}but for other available men
{87543}{87617}it's great.
{87683}{87753}Well, uh,
{87783}{87864}it's really hot in here.
{87865}{87884}/Uh,
{87885}{87969}um, what, um...
{88115}{88154}/Georgina?
{88155}{88180}Georgina?
{88181}{88236}Um,
{88243}{88300}Women have needs, Brian,
{88301}{88388}and I need these needs to be
{88389}{88461}tended to.
{88482}{88568}Bloody hell, that's fantastic.
{88569}{88622}I'll knead your needs any time, love.
{88623}{88649}Oh yeah.
{88650}{88686}Great.
{88687}{88754}What about the weekend of the 25th,
{88755}{88805}which happens to be tomorrow?
{88806}{88845}Eh?
{88846}{88918}We could do the morning, or I|could slip you in after lunch.
{88919}{88955}Oh, slip me in...
{88956}{88992}No pressure.
{88993}{89043}It's a bit formal. Want|me to sign a contract?
{89044}{89181}Actually, do you want to do that? No?
{89212}{89268}I'll get back to you.
{89269}{89331}Great.
{89338}{89405}Alright.
{89525}{89583}Okay, so the nuns are a|little pissy. So what?
{89584}{89646}Pissy? Just don't get it, do you?
{89647}{89779}You've ruined everything. Without|the nuns, we have nothing. Okay?
{89780}{89855}/Without me, you have nothing,|/Zak Solomon. So I suggest
{89856}{89921}if you want my daddy funding|this silly documentary
{89922}{89991}/you start being nicer|/to me. A lot nicer.
{89992}{90143}Well, frankly, my dear, I don't|give a fuck anymore, okay?!
{90144}{90206}Sorry.
{90235}{90349}I'd like a ticket to London, please.
{90350}{90496}Hi, I need to be on the next|flight to London, please.
{90497}{90569}Thank you.
{90570}{90614}The last ticket has just gone.
{90615}{90675}What?
{90742}{90790}Please, I need to be on that flight.
{90791}{90881}Well, maybe you could ask the lady.
{90882}{90924}I'd rather cover my balls in honey
{90925}{90970}and stick them in an ants' nest.
{90971}{91092}I'm very sorry, sir, there's|nothing more I can do for you.
{91093}{91141}Okay, where's the next flight from?
{91142}{91173}Anywhere?
{91174}{91248}Okay. The Dublin flight is full.
{91249}{91276}Right.
{91277}{91326}I'm just checking Belfast for you.
{91327}{91352}Good.
{91353}{91433}Yes. No. That's full, too.
{91434}{91490}There must be something you can do.
{91491}{91606}You thought about the ferry?
{91758}{91824}Hi. I need to get to Cork for the ferry.
{91825}{91880}Can you get me there in three hours?
{91881}{91924}You must be joking.
{91925}{91964}No? ...Okay.
{91965}{92034}/How about now?
{92035}{92064}Brilliant.
{92065}{92182}/I did it in four hours once.
{92260}{92370}/Boarding for the Pembroke|/ferry is now closing.
{92371}{92414}Excuse me.
{92415}{92470}Oi!
{92540}{92579}Alright, look,
{92580}{92710}"After insemination, keep legs|raised for 15 minutes. " Oh.
{92711}{92780}"Sperm must be used before|it separates and gets cold."
{92781}{92826}Yuk. That's disgusting.
{92827}{92887}All right, moving on. Look, look.
{92888}{92977}/Here's a list of loads and|/loads of potential daddies.
{92978}{93067}4-50 looks good. He's German,|Scottish and Italian. That's nice.
{93068}{93146}No, no. Your baby will then work
{93147}{93264}/really hard at making loads|/of teeny-weeny little pizzas.
{93265}{93356}Look, what about there,|number four. That one.
{93357}{93449}/Look at him. English and|/Hungarian. There we go.
{93450}{93555}You could pretend it's Zak's, and|then I can sue him for maintenance.
{93556}{93712}Shouldn't have to pretend,|he should be here.
{93734}{93780}Just call me 'one egg'.
{93781}{93804}No.
{93805}{93850}No boyfriend, one egg.
{93851}{93880}/No, but, darling,
{93881}{93977}Happy. We're going to be happy now.
{93978}{94004}Happy one egg.
{94005}{94042}Look, was that a smile?
{94043}{94117}/There we go, there's|/a smile. I like that.
{94118}{94185}Come here.
{94186}{94308}I wish I could see their faces.
{94332}{94390}/Evening, ladies. Having fun?
{94391}{94475}Mm, Ignita sad.
{94476}{94567}She not want to go back to Stockholm.
{94568}{94688}Away you go. Enjoy yourselves.
{95109}{95161}/I can see that girl's arse.
{95162}{95200}I can actually see her arse.
{95201}{95301}/She'll catch pneumonia.
{95302}{95387}Look, darling, do you see what I see?
{95388}{95484}/Yeah, and the rest!
{95699}{95747}Think there's room for a brain?
{95748}{95793}Perfect.
{95794}{95893}/But the thing about slappers is|/that they consider sex their job
{95894}{96031}/and condoms are like their|/uniform, so they just buckle up.
{96032}{96074}/That sort of defeats the purpose.
{96075}{96142}Well, tell him that you're a virgin.
{96143}{96188}I'm 30 bloody 4 tomorrow.
{96189}{96220}Yes, but you're Irish.
{96221}{96277}I'm half Irish. And tonight I'm Swedish.
{96278}{96344}Well, new plan. You're Irish again.
{96345}{96414}/I don't really think they|/have virgins in Sweden.
{96415}{96530}Now go. Go get him, darling.
{97808}{97952}Ciao, bella. Where hid you all my lives?

{104454}{104520}/And she'll always double up as a spoon.
{104521}{104603}That's lovely. It's a|top of the range spoon.
{104604}{104672}Bit of a squeeze. What I|need is a turkey baster.
{104673}{104729}/Yeah, the one with|/the huge squishy balls
{104730}{104780}/and the long plastic thingy.
{104781}{104925}Something really... big and, like, hard.
{104951}{105041}Do you think one day I'm gonna|meet a turkey baster of my own?
{105042}{105142}I think it's talking to me.|Hello. And what do you do?
{105143}{105238}He bastes turkeys. That's|really fascinating.
{105239}{105305}Darling, I'm being an|insensitive cow, I'm sorry.
{105306}{105362}I want Zak. I only want Zak.
{105363}{105465}You can't speak about other men|in front of Mr Turkey Baster.
{105466}{105525}I just never thought|it would come to this.
{105526}{105638}The potential father of my child|is a sodding kitchen utensil.
{105639}{105749}Stop it. Stop it. Come on.
{105902}{106000}Excuse me, I'm sorry!
{106053}{106140}Hi. How you doing? I need|to to get to London.
{106141}{106171}London, is it?
{106172}{106199}Yeah.
{106200}{106241}That's an hundred pound each way.
{106242}{106333}Do you take credit cards? No?|Visa, Mastercard, American Express?
{106334}{106400}/There's an 'hole in|/the wall' up the road.
{106401}{106509}Right. Don't go anywhere.
{106857}{106919}Fuck!!
{107105}{107132}Morning, boss.
{107133}{107160}Good morning, Brian.
{107161}{107224}It's a bit of a mess.
{107225}{107264}Which bathroom?
{107265}{107326}Up the stairs. It's only because|people were using the lav
{107327}{107409}/that we found out there was a problem.
{107410}{107491}Yuk. Can't believe people use|the toilet in a show home.
{107492}{107580}Yep as funny as folk.|Let's check upstairs.
{107581}{107676}Anyway, it just means that this unit
{107677}{107712}will be out of order for a bit.
{107713}{107746}That can't be helped.
{107747}{107802}Hm.
{107917}{107985}I wonder if it's only the|toilets that they use.
{107986}{108084}Well, you never know.
{108093}{108194}I, um... I phoned you.
{108221}{108312}Last night. I left a message|about our date today.
{108313}{108375}Right.
{108393}{108483}We hadn't confirmed|times or what, but...
{108484}{108558}So, boss, here we are... How about it?
{108559}{108639}Oh... we couldn't. I mean,|what if someone came in?
{108640}{108696}There's only two sets of keys
{108697}{108801}and I've got one and|you've got the other.
{108802}{108874}So why don't you...
{108875}{109033}get yourself comfy...|and I'll go and lock up.
{109150}{109279}Here we go, here we go, here we go
{109408}{109497}Come on! Come on!
{109502}{109533}Brian, I just wanna say...
{109534}{109606}Come here.
{109653}{109700}Right, you ready for this?
{109701}{109729}Yeah... I just wanna
{109730}{109850}Yeah, go, go. I'll be in here.
{109884}{109932}/I'll tell you what, love,
{109933}{109997}I've been thinking about|this for absolutely ages.
{109998}{110032}Really?
{110033}{110076}Wait and see what I've got for you.
{110077}{110168}It's an absolute belter.
{110169}{110265}Hey, I've not had any complaints...|I'm not gonna start now.
{110266}{110339}/Hey, don't worry about precautions.
{110340}{110507}I had a bad case of mumps|last year, so I'm infertile.
{110508}{110542}What?
{110543}{110594}/It's fine. I had kids early.
{110595}{110669}I've got a ten year old and an|eight year old with my first wife.
{110670}{110738}It comes in handy, now|I'm back on the market.
{110739}{110808}/Mind you, it was a nasty business.
{110809}{110880}/My bollocks swelled to|/the size of a watermelon.
{110881}{110951}They took on a life of their own.
{110952}{111024}/I had to sit on a special cushion.
{111025}{111138}Anyway... you nearly ready?
{111235}{111280}I've just got to go to the bathroom.
{111281}{111348}That one is broken, so I'm|going to run downstairs.
{111349}{111416}Hey, no problemo. Whatever.
{111417}{111496}Come on, lad!
{112465}{112642}"After insemination, keep|legs raised for 20 minutes."
{113013}{113041}Miss Salt?
{113042}{113068}Yes.
{113069}{113168}Your, um... Sign here, please.
{113169}{113358}Don't forget, keep it warm,|and use it before it separates.
{113997}{114052}Oh.
{114160}{114263}Oh, shit, it's too big.
{114613}{114674}Right, little ones, I want|you to swim, swim, swim.
{114675}{114699}/Georgina?
{114700}{114758}Mum!
{114760}{114852}Happy birthday, dear. I|wanted to surprise you.
{114853}{114954}Oh dear, the icing is not dry.
{114955}{115015}I'll just pop it in the fridge.
{115016}{115090}Or should we have a piece now?
{115091}{115145}Oh, no, no.
{115146}{115207}It's so lovely, I just want to save it
{115208}{115253}to show it to Justin and Clem.
{115254}{115348}Oh, Justin. He's a nice boy, isn't he?
{115349}{115433}Yes, he's nice.
{115781}{115850}God... no-one said it would be easy
{115851}{115920}but I for one never thought|that it would come to this.
{115921}{116007}Hm. Nor me, l...
{116046}{116094}Oh, darling.
{116095}{116211}If I had the necessary machinery,|I'd step in and I'd do it.
{116212}{116305}No, I haven't got it. So I can't do it.
{116306}{116358}Right, no, of course.
{116359}{116401}/And I want you to remember that...
{116402}{116516}"It is a far greater thing that..."
{116517}{116593}you do today... than...
{116594}{116632}Done, are you?
{116633}{116677}I don't know what it is but...
{116678}{116738}Anyway, listen. The thing is,
{116739}{116856}/you're standing in 'the|/last chance saloon. '
{116857}{116921}You fuck this up...
{116922}{117030}and you fuck up her life.
{117057}{117085}Okay.
{117086}{117162}/Anyway, darling... have fun.
{117163}{117188}Right.
{117189}{117271}/Bye. Alright.

{121025}{121129}/Oh my God! Oh yes! Yes! Oh my God!
{121130}{121200}/Georgie, you're not gonna|/believe it. It's amazing!
{121201}{121288}George Michael has just|called me, and he said that
{121289}{121363}he wants me to do his|costumes for his next tour.
{121364}{121404}What?!
{121405}{121490}Yes! And I have to go now. He|wants me to go to a fitting now.
{121491}{121600}I want it. I want that spunk.|So you get back in there.
{121601}{121666}George.
{121721}{121791}I can't do it.
{121792}{121842}It's a huge responsibility.
{121843}{121968}I can't have a baby with you|because Clem ordered me to.
{121969}{122012}I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
{122013}{122057}You can't pull out now. I forbid you.
{122058}{122151}We'll go down to the bar,|and I will find you a man.
{122152}{122232}No way. I'm sick of looking at|every man like he's a dick on legs.
{122233}{122292}I have one day left, and you promised!
{122293}{122331}You're my best friend!

{123841}{123918}You alright?
{123941}{124020}What's wrong?
{124120}{124173}I had a dream of my life.
{124174}{124241}I would marry Zak and we would have
{124242}{124288}a few children and a lovely home.
{124289}{124373}/I'm sure that's what Zak|/wants, too. Deep down.
{124374}{124424}I know about Alexandra.
{124425}{124461}/The daddy's girl?
{124462}{124528}/Mouth with more teeth than a shark?
{124529}{124591}I know all about their|affair. It's okay.
{124592}{124665}No, he thinks she's a|complete pain in the arse.
{124666}{124743}Well, even if he wasn't with her,|I can't force him to be with me.
{124744}{124790}I miss him so much.
{124791}{124898}Georgina, it's all right.
{124899}{124938}Hey, Zak!
{124939}{124972}What's going on?
{124973}{125064}Zak! I'm so glad you're back! Thank God.
{125065}{125107}Zak, it's not what you think.
{125108}{125132}Not what I think?
{125133}{125164}Wait!
{125165}{125218}/You can't keep your hands off her!
{125219}{125296}It's taken half my life to get here!
{125297}{125334}Georgina was very upset.
{125335}{125394}No, no, no. This is|upset. You absolute arse!
{125395}{125432}/Wait! Stop! Stop!
{125433}{125498}Wanker!
{125741}{125787}Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
{125788}{125886}I'm sorry. Wait, Zak!
{125918}{125988}Zak! Zak!
{126137}{126232}/You've reached Zak Solomon's|/voicemail. Please leave a message.
{126233}{126319}I have something important|to tell you. Please call me.
{126320}{126483}I need to see you tonight,|before it's too late.
{128082}{128162}Maybe God has other plans for me.
{128163}{128229}All right, uhh...
{128230}{128310}Would you like some vodka?
{128311}{128354}No.
{128355}{128443}What about some beer or whiskey?
{128444}{128476}No.
{128477}{128606}No? All right, I know,|what about echinacea,
{128607}{128689}with sort of ginger? Do you like that?
{128690}{128737}All right, I'll have a weak one.
{128738}{128799}Alright.
{128800}{128903}Oh, I'll be right back.
{129056}{129128}Oh. Hello.
{129159}{129200}/What do you want?
{129201}{129295}I had a wee spot of bother with|Georgina and Zak. Have you...
{129296}{129371}/Hey, Georgina! Did you find Zak?
{129372}{129460}Are you all right? I felt bad.
{129461}{129494}I tried calling him.
{129495}{129591}I'm sorry I ran out.
{129603}{129629}Clem, hi.
{129630}{129669}Zak.
{129670}{129741}I need to find out what's going|on between Georgina and Ben.
{129742}{129788}/You're all right?
{129789}{129837}/I'm absolutely fine.
{129838}{129892}Or maybe I should just see for myself.
{129893}{129947}/I don't believe this.
{129948}{129997}/You're getting this all wrong.
{129998}{130072}Oh really?!
{130107}{130169}Ow! That really hurt!
{130170}{130261}Right... get down!
{130267}{130365}/Do as you're told! How many times...?
{130366}{130439}Oh, great, I'm bleeding.
{130440}{130494}/I've been telling you,|/I don't fancy Georgina.
{130495}{130600}/She's all right, but...|/she's no Clem, is she?
{130601}{130643}What?
{130644}{130704}What?
{130711}{130749}Well, you're just so...
{130750}{130783}What?
{130784}{130900}/What I mean is you're really...
{130901}{130926}Do you like me?
{130927}{130962}Well, yeah.
{130963}{130987}Yeah?
{130988}{131018}/Is that okay?
{131019}{131136}That's fine, good, thank you.
{131172}{131211}Don't. Stop looking.
{131212}{131236}Excuse me.
{131237}{131295}Aye.
{131316}{131381}So now that we've established that
{131382}{131440}I'm not the hot property|that you think I am
{131441}{131472}what do you want?
{131473}{131540}Then you can go crawling|back to Alexandra.
{131541}{131574}What?
{131575}{131647}Alexandra?
{131693}{131806}You are joking, aren't you?
{131833}{131906}Okay, you're not. Sure, she's beautiful,
{131907}{132035}but that's not what I look for in|a person, George, you know that.
{132036}{132131}What I mean is that you|are way past beautiful.
{132132}{132212}You're not past it, obviously.
{132213}{132335}I mean, you're beautiful, but|you're so much more than that.
{132336}{132417}Oh shit, um...
{132418}{132510}Georgie... I love you, okay?
{132511}{132575}I've never stopped loving|you. Not for a second.
{132576}{132712}Life without you doesn't make any sense.
{132713}{132854}Georgie, please, can we just, can we...
{132909}{132972}Look... I want what you want.
{132973}{133059}And not because you want me to|want it but because I want it too.
{133060}{133117}Does that make sense?
{133118}{133185}Well, unfortunately for|me, it's too bloody late.
{133186}{133258}I've become your ideal woman,|but I can't have children.
{133259}{133327}What? Georgie!
{133328}{133409}Georgie! What do you mean?
{133410}{133445}Ask them, they'll tell you.
{133446}{133473}I wanna ask you.
{133474}{133558}Leave me alone.
{133746}{133806}Well?
{134458}{134544}/They've explained|/everything. I'm so sorry.
{134545}{134616}/I really meant what I|/said. Let's still try.
{134617}{134708}/Okay? I love you.
{135185}{135236}Can I come in, boss?
{135237}{135328}/Brian, come in. Hi.
{135329}{135383}About the other day, uh...
{135384}{135462}Look, don't say another word.
{135463}{135542}Yeah, I know.
{135557}{135585}I know.
{135586}{135636}It was my bollocks, weren't it?
{135637}{135702}Not exactly. It...
{135703}{135742}Look... I know.
{135743}{135868}Sometimes the sheer size of my|down belows scares people off.
{135869}{135904}That was before the mumps.
{135905}{135957}Oh!
{135958}{136000}Yeah, well.
{136001}{136047}Thank you for this lovely chat.
{136048}{136116}Maybe we could just put it behind us?
{136117}{136188}Yeah, no problemo. It'll|just be our little secret.
{136189}{136222}Thank you, Brian.
{136223}{136312}And all the lads who|saw you running off.
