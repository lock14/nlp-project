1
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:22,476
This is Rick Dees.

2
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:27,542
If you want a song played,
call the radio station right now.

3
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:33,463
You park in an abandoned lot.
You attend the movie.

4
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:38,331
You come out to find that thieves
have ripped off your stereo.

5
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:46,061
This wouldn't have happened...

6
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:51,428
...if you'd purchased the
James Brown auto alarm! Listen!

7
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,229
The James Brown auto alarm,
scattering thieves near and far!

8
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:03,777
The James Brown auto alarm.

9
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:06,344
Get yours today!

10
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:07,263
What are you doing?

11
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,883
- Here.
- Oh, never mind.

12
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:16,849
Morning.

13
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,252
Coffee.

14
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:30,970
What time did you go home
last night, 3:00 a.m.?

15
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,106
You look like you've been
in a plane crash.

16
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:39,600
- This may shock you, but humans sleep.
- I know, I know.

17
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:44,885
Gruen gave me a big project.
I think it's some kind of test.

18
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:49,147
Where's my depreciation schedule?
I've lost my deprec--

19
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:52,899
I think I have everything.
Profit plan...

20
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,477
...flow charts....

21
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:59,322
- How much time do I have?
- Four minutes.

22
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,849
Walter.

23
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:08,244
- You should wind down.
- I'm getting something out of it.

24
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:13,295
You won't believe
what happened last night.

25
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:16,535
You worked on your presentation?
Not at all?

26
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,024
I had drinks at The Blue Dragon--

27
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,044
Don't tell me one of your sex stories.

28
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:27,211
- Bringing the embalmer tonight?
- She's not an embalmer. She does hair.

29
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:32,457
- No. I have a date with a gorgeous--
- In the parking lot of the club...

30
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,985
...l see this woman,
maybe 35, kind of classy.

31
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:41,210
I figure she's waiting for her car.
So, what the hell, I talk to her.

32
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:46,493
Turns out, she came in a limo. I say,
"I've never been in a limo before."

33
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:50,896
She stares at me for 30 seconds,
then says, "Let's take a ride."

34
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:56,336
In the limo, she pushes a button and
a wall's up between us and the driver.

35
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:59,774
She hits another button,
a sunroof opens.

36
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,500
Bar slides open.

37
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:06,386
She pours us vodka,
plays Sly and the Family Stone.

38
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:09,557
Next thing I know, we slide onto PCH.

39
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:16,740
Full moon, 2:00 a.m,
vodka, limo, music.

40
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:18,620
And I'm thinking....

41
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:21,939
- I don't believe you.
- We start to kiss.

42
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:26,320
I slide my hand up her dress.
What do I find? Garter belt!

43
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:30,680
- All your women wear garter belts!
- So I tell her I want her...

44
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:35,414
...from behind, standing up,
with my head sticking out the sunroof.

45
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,962
So we start doing it.

46
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:41,145
We're going 60, my head's out
the roof, my hair's flying....

47
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:46,141
This didn't happen. There was
no limo, no woman, no sunroof--

48
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:49,555
That's disgusting.

49
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:54,742
I'm ashamed to know you. How do you
get women to do these things?

50
00:04:55,093 --> 00:05:00,139
As you know by now, Yakamoto has
agreed to entrust the management...

51
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:04,178
...of all his personal
and corporate assets to us.

52
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,672
No small thanks
to the efforts of Harry Gruen.

53
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,732
I'm sure Mr. Yakamoto's
confidence in us...

54
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:16,396
...will increase with the lethal charm
you'll all exude tonight.

55
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:18,447
A word of caution.

56
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:22,609
He's very traditional.
Old-fashioned ideas about women.

57
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:25,022
Wives must follow certain rules.

58
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:30,546
Can't speak until spoken to, don't sit
until he does, all that crap.

59
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:33,392
Meanwhile...

60
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:37,480
...he keeps a stable of concubines
you wouldn't believe.

61
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:42,971
Anyway...

62
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:47,237
...this is a very old-world guy.

63
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:52,489
So watch yourselves, and keep
your wives away from the mai tais.

64
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:56,436
Okay, a few facts
about the man. Denny...

65
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,643
...show us Yakamoto's
holdings for '85.

66
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:06,066
Damn. Spreadsheets are still printing.
Machine's been down.

67
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,573
Okay, forget it.
Walter, let's have your report.

68
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:27,515
Yakamoto Worldwide has shown almost
recession-proof capabilities.

69
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:31,174
Even in a disastrous third quarter...

70
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:33,864
...his fish oil conglomerate...

71
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:37,902
...bolstered his net worth
by some 27 %.

72
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,867
Walter, you look like shit.
Where were you last night?

73
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:50,356
I was here until 3.

74
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:54,291
This is the money business.
Image is everything.

75
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:57,296
Look at you. This jacket is shit.

76
00:06:57,374 --> 00:07:02,337
See, men like Yakamoto don't make
deals with the lint man, here.

77
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:06,127
- Now look at Denny. That's a suit.
- Armani, sir.

78
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:08,715
- Take a few tips from him.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,315
We'll make a good assistant
portfolio assessor out of you yet.

80
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:14,955
See you at dinner.

81
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,995
- Who's he bringing?
- I don't know, sir.

82
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,798
God, I hope it's not the embalmer.

83
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,219
- Can I borrow your wife?
- Sure. $50.

84
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,155
I'm serious. Denise bagged out on me.

85
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:50,200
I need a date. They don't know
Susie's my sister-in-law.

86
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,573
She'd do it, but it's our anniversary.

87
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:55,930
- Going to Spago's.
- I'm ruined.

88
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:59,163
Watch this. This guy'll make an offer.

89
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:02,696
- Have you decided?
- I can't go higher than 15,500.

90
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,130
No can do. It's 17,000 list.

91
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:07,901
What? You told me it was 18,000 list!

92
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:13,163
You made $1000 off your brother?
I'm bankrolling your dinner at Spago's!

93
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:15,318
Stop it. You're scaring him.

94
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:19,933
You're scaring me. Jesus, you'd
cheat your own flesh and blood.

95
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:21,532
We'll talk.

96
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:26,770
- I'll make it up to you.
- You'll write me a check?

97
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,035
No, but I know this fantastic--

98
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:33,523
Stop! You're gonna recommend
one of your psychotic friends.

99
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:35,586
I resent that, Walter.

100
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:40,999
You've set me up before, only you
forget to mention one crucial detail:

101
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,318
She's a dopehead, a lesbian,
keeps dead cats in the freezer....

102
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:49,384
What a New Year's!
"The champagne's in the icebox."

103
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:54,298
I'm sorry. Seriously, I know someone.
Nadia Gates, Susie's cousin.

104
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:58,882
- Ted, I don't want to hear it.
- Don't you trust your own brother?

105
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:02,855
No argument there.
But, no bullshit, Nadia's amazing.

106
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:05,021
She's just moved back to town...

107
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:08,260
- ...and wants to meet people!
- What's she like?

108
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:12,586
She's a sweetheart, good sense
of humour. You'll love her!

109
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,405
I won't love her
because this won't happen!

110
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:19,869
Suit yourself.
But I highly recommend her.

111
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,138
Talk about the kiss of death!

112
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:29,234
- Call us if you change your mind.
- I won't!

113
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,947
Hi. Is Chloe there?

114
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:40,638
Do you have the rifle range's number?

115
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:45,642
Never mind. Look, I'll just
call her later. Thanks.

116
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:08,293
- Hello?
- Is she reasonably pretty?

117
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:12,396
"Reasonably" doesn't begin
to describe it.

118
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:17,268
I'm looking at her picture now.
She's an honest-to-God knockout.

119
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:20,960
Ted, just this once, please.
The truth.

120
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:24,853
Susie, tell Walter Nadia's pretty.

121
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:27,159
She's very pretty, Walter.

122
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:33,192
- When was the picture taken?
- Four years ago.

123
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:37,392
Four years? She could've been
disfigured in four years!

124
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:41,677
- She could've gained 100 pounds!
- She's gorgeous! Stop it!

125
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,327
I almost forgot!

126
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:47,006
Don't get her drunk.
She loses control completely.

127
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,421
But don't get her drunk. If you do...

128
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:53,418
...she loses control!

129
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,241
Loses her inhibitions,
or she pees on the floor?

130
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:59,740
What's "Iose control" mean?

131
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:02,817
Oh, you know, she gets real wild.

132
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:06,953
She gets real wild!

133
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:16,608
All right! I may kill you later,
but I'm doing this now...

134
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,445
...before I change my mind.

135
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:35,434
- Walter?
- Yeah.

136
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:38,065
Come on in.

137
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,684
I'll just be a minute.

138
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:55,400
I hope you don't mind
helping me with my suitcase.

139
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:59,566
I'm moving out of here.
I'll be staying with a friend.

140
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:04,555
If you feel like it,
a friend's having an art exhibit.

141
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:08,640
If we have time before dinner,
maybe we could go?

142
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:10,676
Yeah, no problem.

143
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:14,456
Well, here goes, Walter. Ready or not.

144
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:18,557
Oh, damn it!
This has been going on all night.

145
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,207
There may be some matches over there.

146
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:24,668
Let me look.

147
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,272
It may be over there.

148
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,440
Here.

149
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:35,303
Now this is a blind date.
Here's your chance to run for it.

150
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,888
Your very last chance.

151
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,673
You missed your chance.

152
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,355
I'm glad.

153
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:12,081
I had no idea.

154
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:15,857
Do you know this artist?

155
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:20,691
I've met him once.
He's Susie's friend.

156
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,317
I mean, coming was her idea.
We can go.

157
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:28,073
- I don't have any obligation to him.
- No, come on.

158
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:30,296
We're both adults, aren't we?

159
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:33,054
I thought I was.

160
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,682
I don't know. Maybe I'm not now.

161
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,253
Can I ask you something?

162
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,041
Yeah, I guess so.

163
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:51,093
Why didn't you have a date tonight?
ls there something I should know?

164
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,918
I can't imagine why you don't
have a date every night of the week.

165
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,339
Know what? I was thinking
the same about you.

166
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:03,735
- Come on, I'm serious.
- Me too. I was thinking that.

167
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:08,046
I asked you first.

168
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:15,758
I stopped dating
about three months ago.

169
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:18,627
I was involved,
but it didn't work out.

170
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:23,966
Boy, how it didn't work out. So I was
living in Baton Rouge with my mama.

171
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:28,323
And you're my first date.
But you almost weren't.

172
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:30,640
Susie talked me into it...

173
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:33,228
...l'm glad to say.

174
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:36,018
So how about you?

175
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:41,715
Well, my date backed out
at the last minute...

176
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:44,029
...l'm glad to say.

177
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:51,623
You want some candy?

178
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,041
I'm not much of a candy person.

179
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,319
That's good.
I always was a candy person.

180
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:03,714
Some people drink,
some people do drugs. I do sugar.

181
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:09,229
This looks Japanese.

182
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,647
"Master and Concubines"?

183
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,815
It's Yakamoto.

184
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:20,184
- What is?
- The big business dinner tonight...

185
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:24,130
...is for this Japanese industrialist
new client of ours.

186
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,049
He's old-world Japanese.
His wife's like his slave...

187
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,091
...and he keeps concubines.

188
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,920
- You're kidding.
- No. His wife knows all about it.

189
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,428
It's traditional or something.

190
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:41,956
Tell me something.
Are you into those traditions?

191
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:47,135
No, I'm actually a
one-concubine kind of guy...

192
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:49,188
- ...actually.
- Good.

193
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:54,503
So, what was it that made you
break up with this guy?

194
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,649
- What do you mean?
- What was he like?

195
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:00,055
Psychopath. Like that guy over there.

196
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:01,620
What's wrong?

197
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:05,678
That's him! That's my psychotic
ex-boyfriend David.

198
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:08,877
There. The guy in the goofy bow tie.

199
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:10,664
He looks okay to me.

200
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:14,632
He's been chasing me
for three months. I moved twice.

201
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:19,386
I think he's coming over here!
Watch it. Please just hide.

202
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:20,977
Just relax.

203
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,695
Hello, Nadia.

204
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,750
- David, don't start anything.
- I just want to say hello.

205
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,416
Hi, I'm David.

206
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:35,718
- Walter.
- She has every reason to be upset.

207
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:39,540
I was so in love,
I made a total asshole of myself.

208
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:42,631
Apology accepted. Nice to meet you.

209
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:46,250
- How long you been dating?
- None of your business!

210
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:50,683
It is my business.
There's not a night that's gone by--

211
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:54,038
You son of a bitch,
are you drilling her?!

212
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,603
Shut up and leave her alone!

213
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,353
Wait, I want to talk to you.
I'll find you!

214
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:10,837
- I have an idea.
- Yeah? What?

215
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,970
Thank you.

216
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,851
- Okay, Walter, what's going on?
- Well....

217
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:35,217
We have about half an hour.
Indulge me.

218
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:09,232
- You like guitar?
- Oh, yeah, I do.

219
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:14,521
- We're set. How's the level for you?
- It's basically cool.

220
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:18,768
Turn up the monitors a bit
and we'll be there. Thanks.

221
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,838
- How are you?
- Good, Stanley. How are you?

222
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:24,442
Did you bring your guitar?

223
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:29,208
No, I brought something better
than a guitar.

224
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,484
- How you doing?
- Hi, how are you?

225
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,341
Good, good.

226
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,818
You ever hear him play?
He's really fantastic.

227
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,335
Relax...

228
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,164
...sip a little champagne.

229
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:51,973
I don't think I should drink.

230
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:55,822
The last three or four times l....

231
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,405
I mean, it sort of makes me go crazy!

232
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,253
Well, one little glass
isn't gonna make you go crazy.

233
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:14,351
This is our first toast.

234
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:18,393
To auspicious beginnings.

235
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:25,761
It's really good.

236
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:29,604
Stanley Jordan, take two. Rolling.

237
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:49,975
So, what made you think
to stop by here?

238
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:56,441
I recorded here when I thought
I wanted to be a musician.

239
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,374
I played guitar. But I really
don't have time for it now.

240
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,862
I played all the time. I went to
the bathroom carrying a Stratocaster.

241
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:11,592
I drove my mom nuts. I got tendonitis.

242
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:16,317
Why did you give it up?

243
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:18,693
Well....

244
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:24,051
Because if you want
to be a musician...

245
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:29,077
...you're guaranteeing yourself
a life of poverty and obscurity...

246
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:31,948
...unless you're talented
like Stanley.

247
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,075
And...

248
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,032
...l got a good job now...

249
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:41,193
...good car. Next year,
I'll be able to get a condo.

250
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,284
I don't know.

251
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:47,113
It just kind of made sense.

252
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:53,356
We're gonna be late.
Let me give you a little--

253
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:01,721
Oh, I'm getting bad.

254
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:05,144
I'm starting to feel the champagne.

255
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,009
That's okay.

256
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:11,888
Feel away.

257
00:21:12,258 --> 00:21:13,426
Come on.

258
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,348
Hi, I called for Davis,
for two, please.

259
00:21:57,003 --> 00:22:00,340
- Joseph, table six.
- Follow me, please.

260
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:05,240
Please don't touch the flowers.
The arrangement is very expensive.

261
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:09,579
These things don't smell.
They're no good anyway.

262
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,374
- Sorry. Oh, my God.
- It's all right.

263
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:16,688
- You sure?
- It'll be fine.

264
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,972
- Lovely looking girl.
- Thank you.

265
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:33,116
- You know my wife.
- Yes, hello.

266
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:35,901
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Gruen.

267
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:45,815
Thank you. Do you think you could
find me some safety pins?

268
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:47,663
Safety pins?

269
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:50,081
No, I don't think so.

270
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:53,452
There's a lot of roast beef in here.

271
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:57,215
Would you care for a cocktail?

272
00:22:57,263 --> 00:23:01,768
- A bottle of your finest champagne.
- Very good.

273
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,242
Thank you.

274
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,458
Oh, my God.

275
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,113
That's Yakamoto.

276
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,444
Good evening.

277
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:18,862
- My wife.
- Very nice to meet you, Mr. Yakimoto.

278
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:20,855
Yakamoto.

279
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:24,858
Mrs. Yakamoto.

280
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:28,213
- How lovely you look.
- Thank you.

281
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:33,713
That's incredible.
She's like a geisha girl.

282
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:53,965
Cupcake, would you excuse me
for just a minute?

283
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:56,230
Business.

284
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:03,725
- They still do that in Japan?
- I don't know--

285
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:07,097
Walter, you old dog.

286
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:11,550
- Denny Gordon, this is Nadia Gates.
- How do you do?

287
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,561
- Hi.
- I gotta hand it to you.

288
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:19,644
This is the most exciting
woman in the place.

289
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:22,847
Thank you. Nice tie.
Where did you get it?

290
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:27,545
I don't remember. Probably
one of those places over on Rodeo.

291
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:31,517
- Where's that?
- You don't know where Rodeo is?

292
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:35,308
No, I know where it is.
I just wondered if you did.

293
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:40,692
What happened to your pocket?

294
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,500
- Oh, we had a little--
- That's the new style.

295
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:49,251
See? Oh, that looks nice.

296
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:55,144
- Aren't you forgetting your date?
- My date? Oh, right. Yes.

297
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:58,899
I do hope that we'll meet again.

298
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:04,365
"Denny Gordon, supervisor,
real estate analysis."

299
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:07,843
How did you get that?
It fell out of my pocket.

300
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:11,739
- You pressed it in my hand.
- I don't think I did that.

301
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,491
- You put it right in my hand.
- You see--

302
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,835
- Why? Did you think I'd call you up?
- Come on, you know how it is.

303
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,487
No, I don't think
he does know how it is.

304
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:27,539
He's not a vain slimeball pig
that's led around by his dick.

305
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:34,267
I guess that just about
sums it up, huh?

306
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,416
All's fair in love and....

307
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:42,535
She's right. You really are
a slimeball pig.

308
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:46,450
Hey, Denny! Your ex-fiancée,
she just took a hike.

309
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:47,782
Oh, jeez.

310
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:49,936
Honey?

311
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:52,007
Sweetheart!

312
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:55,254
I'll be right back, sir.
You look lovely.

313
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:56,536
Thank you.

314
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:57,729
Pumpkin?

315
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:08,283
- My boss, Mr. Gruen, is watching us.
- Where is he?

316
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:19,654
- Boy, that was--
- You shouldn't have any more.

317
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:23,400
- Are you ready?
- Yes, we are.

318
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:28,055
Will you order for me, please?

319
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:34,257
We'll start with
the étuvée de veau au vin--

320
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:41,186
Which soup?

321
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:45,820
We'll have the crème de concombre.

322
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:49,588
Végétable?

323
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:54,995
This one right here.

324
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,474
The gratin dauphinois?

325
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:02,372
A bit of a clash with the
veau au vin rouge, don't you think?

326
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:05,847
Excuse me. Come here.
Can I ask you something?

327
00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:11,696
Do you really speak French
or just bullshit menu French?

328
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:14,695
- I trained in Paris.
- Oh, good.

329
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:21,312
What did you say?

330
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:25,880
I told him to stick a skewer
up his ass and flambé himself.

331
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:28,483
- What did he say?
- He called me a slut.

332
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:31,203
Now, just a goddamn minute here.

333
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:33,666
What did he say?

334
00:27:33,815 --> 00:27:37,443
"Your taste in women
is as bad as your French."

335
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:39,996
How do you say, "Step outside"?

336
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,549
This is a....

337
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:49,574
Excuse me.

338
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:53,059
I said, "The champagne
tastes like horse piss."

339
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,133
He said, "I should know,"
which is quite a good comeback.

340
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:00,212
- What the hell--?
- Oh, my God!

341
00:28:00,486 --> 00:28:02,780
- I'm sorry.
- What did he say?

342
00:28:02,886 --> 00:28:05,597
I don't know. I don't speak French.

343
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:08,726
He insulted my date.

344
00:28:08,843 --> 00:28:11,387
It's all Henri's fault. He's French.

345
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:14,189
Hey, Mr. Y.

346
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:17,990
If you don't mind,
that is the loveliest necklace.

347
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,876
It's so pretty. Where did you get it?

348
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,837
I don't speak English.

349
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:25,378
He insulted my date, Nadia!

350
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:28,985
- Oh, my God.
- Go back to your seat.

351
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:31,744
- She can't talk?
- They're our guests.

352
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:36,215
- I just asked about the necklace.
- You are foolish and silly.

353
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:39,696
- Leaving so soon? Sit.
- Go jump on your concubine.

354
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:42,673
Did you hear her? I have no concubine.

355
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:46,215
Walter, get this woman out of here!

356
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:50,171
No, no. Don't do that.

357
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,525
Why don't you walk
over there, Nadia? Here.

358
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:56,338
Oh, take it to her.

359
00:28:57,028 --> 00:29:01,032
I hope this doesn't undermine
your confidence in us.

360
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:12,155
- I worked very hard for this job.
- We can sort--

361
00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:15,057
- What's going on out here?
- Oh, my God.

362
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:18,937
- Please, come back to the restaurant.
- Mrs. Gruen, hi.

363
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,084
Mrs. Yakamoto.

364
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,014
- She doesn't speak English.
- Just get out of here!

365
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:27,728
Mrs. Yakamoto, I have your hair.

366
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:31,822
I'm going to just
slip it under the door.

367
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,273
Got it?

368
00:29:33,456 --> 00:29:37,335
I'll tell your husband
you'll be out in a minute.

369
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:43,154
Don't take that
concubine stuff from anybody.

370
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:46,508
- I no speak English!
- You a California resident?

371
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:49,783
- I no speak English!
- Know what you're entitled?

372
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,602
I no speak English!

373
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:57,152
California law states you're entitled
to 50 % of your husband's assets.

374
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:01,975
Fifty percent?

375
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:06,078
Mr. Gruen, please. I'm very sorry.
I had no way--

376
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:08,795
Walter, go away. Just go away.

377
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:12,889
Bottle of Meyer-Fonné Barsac.
Hors d'oeuvres, on the house?

378
00:30:12,923 --> 00:30:17,970
Sir, I can't begin to tell you
how dreadfully sorry l--

379
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,369
Attention! Attention, everybody!

380
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,452
Mrs. Yakamoto needs
a good divorce lawyer now...

381
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,315
...because Mr. Yakamoto
is worth over $100 million.

382
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:36,772
- Miss.
- I'll kill her!

383
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:41,616
Harry--

384
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:44,071
Don't touch me. Please.

385
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:46,443
Did you hurt yourself?

386
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,094
Do I have to say the words?

387
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,648
- I'm fired?
- Fired?

388
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:02,551
I only wish we were in the Army...

389
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:07,131
- ...so I could have you shot.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:09,836
Twice.

391
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:16,060
That was so much fun!

392
00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:20,511
My face is numb.
What do you wanna do now?

393
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:24,276
There's a party down the street.
Let's go!

394
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,762
Are you insane? You destroyed my life
and now you want to go to a party?

395
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:34,117
- You don't like me, do you?
- I've never hit a woman before, but--

396
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:36,473
- Let's make up.
- That won't work.

397
00:31:36,576 --> 00:31:39,871
- Of course, it will.
- It won't! Now stop it!

398
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:45,185
- Nadia, I'm driving the car!
- Let's do it! Let's do it right now!

399
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:48,675
- We're on the freeway!
- Who cares?

400
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:54,096
I'm driving 55 miles an hour, here!
Will you, for chri--

401
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,867
Stop it!

402
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:08,345
- Stop, please!
- You're frowning again.

403
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:12,785
Stop it! For chrissakes,
there's a car behind us!

404
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,557
Gotta do better than that.

405
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:18,271
Someone's getting out of the car.
Sit over there.

406
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:20,491
- David!
- What? This is--

407
00:32:20,602 --> 00:32:22,729
- Car trouble?
- You following us?

408
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:25,928
- I'm worried about her.
- I'm taking her home.

409
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:30,881
You let her drink? Son of a bitch,
don't you know she can't drink?

410
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:34,299
- Nadia, get out of the car!
- Stay in the car.

411
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:39,029
- Hey, that's a-- That's a $500 bra!
- I'm gonna kill you!

412
00:32:39,036 --> 00:32:43,165
You were gonna drill her.
I'll kill you!

413
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,613
Can't we just talk about it?

414
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,028
Honey, stay in the car.

415
00:32:48,153 --> 00:32:51,823
- I'll stay in the car.
- You don't love her like I do!

416
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:55,125
- I believe you!
- He doesn't love you like I do!

417
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:59,278
What are you doing?
Get out of my car! Hey!

418
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:06,598
That son of a bitch!

419
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:10,002
I'm gonna kill you too!

420
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:16,778
Walter, what--

421
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:27,833
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

422
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,180
Damn bastard!

423
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:45,894
Jesus, that guy's a maniac.
He was really trying to kill me.

424
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:47,801
Why'd you break up?

425
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:51,646
You must be the best match
since Bonnie and Clyde.

426
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,972
Come on.

427
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:05,781
I'm sorry.

428
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:09,580
I really am. I--

429
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,157
It was a cheap shot.

430
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:19,428
- I wasn't crying about that.
- What are you crying about?

431
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:27,148
I just saw David chasing you
around the car, and I got sad.

432
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:28,949
Me too.

433
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,967
Do you have a Kleenex?

434
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:38,355
A handkerchief?

435
00:34:41,636 --> 00:34:42,929
Here.

436
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:47,275
I hate it when my eyes get all puffy.

437
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:51,025
I get all stuffed up. I look terrible.

438
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:55,358
Are my eyes puffy?

439
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:02,421
Can we stop so I can blow my nose
and wash my face?

440
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,763
I gotta go to the bathroom.

441
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:07,161
Yeah, sure. Okay.

442
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:10,075
Thank you.

443
00:35:57,012 --> 00:36:00,056
- Can I help you?
- Fill it with unleaded.

444
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:02,550
- Super?
- Regular.

445
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,965
Let me say two words:

446
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,927
Engine knocks. Rings and valves,
$900. Check, please.

447
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:13,972
You can pay me now
or pay my service manager later.

448
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,843
- Fill it with unleaded.
- Super?

449
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,928
The guy wants super.

450
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:30,640
- She's not in there.
- What?

451
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:34,724
The girl who came with you?
She's at Freda & Freddie's.

452
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,916
The disco.

453
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:06,728
Where's the ladies' room?

454
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,507
Thank you very much.

455
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:41,769
I'm looking for my date.

456
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:45,820
She's a brunette with a red dress on,
really pretty.

457
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:50,653
And she came in
the bathroom here and, see--

458
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:53,907
She was in the bathroom
at the gas station.

459
00:37:53,975 --> 00:37:58,062
She took a long time.
I went to get her and she was gone.

460
00:37:58,093 --> 00:38:01,137
And the gas station guy said...

461
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:08,209
...that she came in here.
I figured she went into this--

462
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,228
I'll wait right here
at the bar for her, okay?

463
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:17,043
Bartender, can I get
a Perrier and a soda? I mean--

464
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:20,008
A Scotch and soda.
Something like that.

465
00:38:20,086 --> 00:38:21,713
Can I buy you a drink?

466
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:26,559
She had a thing with her ex,
and she got a little emotional.

467
00:38:26,564 --> 00:38:30,443
She started crying and wanted
to stop at a gas station.

468
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:32,443
So we stopped next door.

469
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:36,858
She took a long time.
When I went to get her, she'd left.

470
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:41,844
The guy said she came here.
She probably went into this bathroom.

471
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,261
It wasn't like I was trying to
look in. I was trying to find her.

472
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:49,694
Come dance with me.

473
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:54,364
- This is the girl. Right here.
- Five dollars, please.

474
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:03,341
- I know you're a good dancer.
- No, I really don't wanna dance.

475
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:08,464
- Stop, it's not funny.
- Come on.

476
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,677
I'm sorry.

477
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:14,869
Let's just go.

478
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:18,798
Please. I'm sorry.

479
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:25,269
All right, you ready for this?

480
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:37,058
- Let's go now.
- Please, Walter.

481
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:11,212
- Hi, I just wanted to come by and--
- David, don't--

482
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:15,861
I came by to apologize.
I still love her very much.

483
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:19,456
What? So you can drill her?
You son of a bitch!

484
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:33,356
You bitch!

485
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:39,468
We're leaving. Now!

486
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,658
You son of a bitch!

487
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:57,658
Let's go before the cops show up.

488
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,019
Come on, come on!

489
00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:04,418
Move it, move it, move it.

490
00:42:06,853 --> 00:42:09,230
Get in. Get in!

491
00:42:10,052 --> 00:42:11,220
How much?

492
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:13,499
- Cash or plastic?
- Cash!

493
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,738
It's $12.50.
What's going on over there?

494
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,896
I wanna talk to you.
Get out of the car.

495
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,430
Just get out of the--

496
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:26,870
Get back inside, you stupid idiot!

497
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:43,702
Your ex's hobby is killing people.
What's his profession?

498
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,908
- He's a defence lawyer.
- For who? Jack the Ripper?

499
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:51,004
It's not funny.

500
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:55,667
I'm taking you home.
Where do your friends live?

501
00:42:55,797 --> 00:43:00,551
They live on Elm and East Hill.

502
00:43:00,556 --> 00:43:03,934
Your friends live
on Elm and East Hill?

503
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:05,997
No, the party.

504
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,419
I'm not taking you to any party!

505
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:11,181
Party!

506
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:15,415
I'm gonna take you home.

507
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:17,007
To Baton Rouge?

508
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:22,723
I'm taking you to your friends' house.
Where do they live?

509
00:43:22,908 --> 00:43:27,454
- We have to get on the freeway.
- No! No more freeways.

510
00:43:27,946 --> 00:43:31,241
It's the only way I know
how to get there.

511
00:43:32,465 --> 00:43:37,303
- What's the exact address?
- I know the house.

512
00:43:42,382 --> 00:43:45,510
- I'm getting on the freeway.
- Where's the hole?

513
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,333
But if you make one move--
You listening?

514
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,423
If you make one move
that makes me nervous...

515
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:55,462
...l'll put you out at the first
intersection. Understand?

516
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:57,739
Don't frown, Walter.

517
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,648
Here's the house. Right....

518
00:44:04,215 --> 00:44:07,635
Okay, here, stop. Right here.

519
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:19,116
When was the last time
you saw these people?

520
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,172
About six years.

521
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:22,820
Listen to me.

522
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:25,805
Listen. Listen to me.

523
00:44:26,128 --> 00:44:29,089
You absolutely sure this is the house?

524
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,169
Absolutely.

525
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:34,754
Jesus!

526
00:44:45,322 --> 00:44:50,702
Hey! Stop! Get out of there!
Come here a minute!

527
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:02,352
Your beautiful car.

528
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:10,256
Look at the bright side.
What the hell else could happen?

529
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:20,022
- Nadia, just stay out of this.
- Shut up, bitch!

530
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,530
Your wallet.

531
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:27,305
- Oh, shit! The cops!
- Drop the gun!

532
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:34,468
There was three girls.

533
00:45:34,586 --> 00:45:39,424
One of the girls put a gun to my head!
She had a knife in my crotch!

534
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:42,177
Get out of the freaking car!

535
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:45,263
One had red hair standing straight up.

536
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:49,221
Both had leather jackets,
and one had a big tattoo!

537
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,771
How much did you drink tonight, sir?

538
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:18,505
Good.

539
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:20,516
Head back.

540
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:22,766
Eyes closed.

541
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,767
Arms out.

542
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,683
Palms up.

543
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:30,312
With your left hand,
touch the tip of your nose.

544
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:31,937
Good.

545
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:34,131
Now the other hand.

546
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:38,835
Now, keep your eyes closed.

547
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:42,804
Raise your right foot
eight inches for 10 seconds.

548
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,557
God, I feel horrible.

549
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:59,748
Dare I hope that you sobered up?

550
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:02,661
Oh, I drank. I drank so much.

551
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:05,512
Yes, you did.

552
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:11,198
And the dinner party.... Oh, God.

553
00:47:11,235 --> 00:47:14,154
- Walter, I'm so sorry.
- Well...

554
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:17,141
...l know I feel a lot better now.

555
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:25,021
I just have this chemical imbalance.

556
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:30,325
It's like an allergy to alcohol.
It makes me crazy, that's all.

557
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,241
Is that so?

558
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:39,234
Look, Walter, I know you hate me.
So just listen.

559
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:42,750
Take me to my friend Cathy's house.

560
00:47:43,144 --> 00:47:47,690
I know the address.
I won't ever bother you again.

561
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,104
I'll kill you!

562
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,471
Great!

563
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,165
- I thought we'd lost him!
- What fun would that be?

564
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:02,410
- David!
- Hold the tray!

565
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,268
You son of a bitch! You wanna play?
Fine, I'll kill you!

566
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,259
Actually, if you'll just
drop me off at the nearest hotel--

567
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:36,044
- And end this glorious evening?
- I told you I was sorry.

568
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:39,801
It's barely midnight.
Don't you wanna boogie down?

569
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:43,339
Dance all night? Tear up the town?

570
00:48:43,765 --> 00:48:47,060
I just wanna lie down
in a nice, cool place.

571
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:50,126
I just remembered! There's a party!

572
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:54,374
I know somebody mentioned
a party at Elm and East Hill.

573
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:57,400
I don't wanna go to a party anymore.

574
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,928
My friends are nice, quiet people.
They'll bore you.

575
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:05,254
We'll just have to
liven them up, won't we?

576
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:16,081
Seen some traffic, pal?

577
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:20,745
- Walter, listen to me.
- What?

578
00:49:20,872 --> 00:49:22,874
Party pooper.

579
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,295
- Please, Walter.
- This is great.

580
00:49:34,148 --> 00:49:37,485
- How are you?
- Walter Davis, rocket scientist.

581
00:49:38,987 --> 00:49:40,655
I'm thirsty.

582
00:49:40,786 --> 00:49:42,246
Thank you.

583
00:49:42,466 --> 00:49:44,885
Walter Davis, gynaecologist.

584
00:49:47,344 --> 00:49:51,348
- I know these people.
- Great! Let's mingle.

585
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,465
You can't juggle pâté.

586
00:50:06,978 --> 00:50:08,062
Oh, my God!

587
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:12,179
- You came after all.
- Walter Davis, interior decorator.

588
00:50:12,216 --> 00:50:17,221
- Did you do the Leland house?
- We did the upstairs in '60's kitsch.

589
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:21,761
- Beanbag chairs, lava lamps. Amazing.
- We have to go there now.

590
00:50:21,773 --> 00:50:24,067
That's a great suit, Grant.

591
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,117
106 at the Forum,
24 seconds left in the game.

592
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:39,713
Lakers down by one.
Magic pumps, shoots.

593
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,644
Lakers win in overtime, folks!

594
00:50:43,726 --> 00:50:45,353
Boston fans?

595
00:50:45,485 --> 00:50:47,863
Do I hear a mambo?

596
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,337
Come on, Nadia.

597
00:50:52,243 --> 00:50:54,870
It's mambo time!

598
00:50:57,561 --> 00:50:59,646
Listen to me!

599
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,876
Come and dance with me, darling.

600
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:18,058
Walter Davis, brain surgeon.

601
00:51:18,794 --> 00:51:21,672
Walter Davis, mambo king!

602
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:27,592
- Mambo with me, darling!
- Would you care for another--

603
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:34,095
I hope Walter and Nadia
are having a good time.

604
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:43,350
You lie down in a quiet room,
and I'll call a cab.

605
00:51:43,387 --> 00:51:47,725
What is all this? I thought
you were Ms. Party-All-Night.

606
00:51:47,745 --> 00:51:50,248
This is a great fucking party!

607
00:51:52,223 --> 00:51:54,643
You'll thank me in the morning.

608
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,334
Let's do it.

609
00:52:00,821 --> 00:52:05,659
Let's do it in the coats!
Right here in the fur coats, honey.

610
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:10,776
Why don't you do now what you're
going to do later anyway?

611
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:12,401
Just pass out.

612
00:52:12,817 --> 00:52:15,236
Come to me, baby!

613
00:52:23,094 --> 00:52:27,807
Nadia, my little minx.
You've come back to me.

614
00:52:27,932 --> 00:52:31,269
You can't get rid of me that easily.

615
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:35,416
I'm gonna rip your head off!

616
00:52:41,168 --> 00:52:45,548
So I take her to my house,
watch a movie, kicking back.

617
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:47,608
She's about this tall.

618
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:49,811
Sort of like that one.

619
00:52:53,244 --> 00:52:54,371
Can I help you?

620
00:52:54,524 --> 00:52:58,069
I need my suitcase out of here.
I called a cab.

621
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:08,315
- I wanna talk to you!
- Hey, go call somebody.

622
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:10,820
I'm gonna freaking kill you!

623
00:53:14,117 --> 00:53:15,577
Get up, you big--

624
00:53:18,356 --> 00:53:19,983
Call them!

625
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:30,901
- Walter, no!
- Shut up!

626
00:53:31,032 --> 00:53:32,909
- I'm not worth it.
- Shut up!

627
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:34,241
- Dance!
- What?

628
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:36,018
I said dance, scumbag!

629
00:53:41,228 --> 00:53:42,271
Moonwalk!

630
00:53:47,067 --> 00:53:48,610
I hate that shit!

631
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:52,985
He's got a gun!

632
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,391
Step up to the line, sir.

633
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,838
Hands over your head.

634
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:18,007
Straighten up. Look straight ahead.

635
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:30,663
Here. You're allowed two phone calls.

636
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:43,952
My brother was just
in a serious accident. I--

637
00:54:43,968 --> 00:54:48,264
- What do you drive? I have a car--
- Have a nice day.

638
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:08,837
Buckle up, Walter.
You're in enough trouble.

639
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,357
It's the law!

640
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,334
Home?

641
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:21,821
I warned you not to let her drink.

642
00:55:24,156 --> 00:55:29,578
You'd better get a good lawyer
or you'll go to jail for a long time.

643
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:35,387
You're lucky you didn't kill anybody.

644
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,721
Bad hangover?

645
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:47,558
Serves you right.

646
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:50,737
New car?

647
00:55:56,065 --> 00:55:57,525
God!

648
00:56:05,702 --> 00:56:08,788
- Sorry about your car.
- Just get out.

649
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:17,540
- Thanks for bailing me out.
- I didn't bail you out.

650
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:26,808
- Teddy, what did you say?
- I said I didn't bail you out.

651
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:29,067
- Well, who did?
- Nadia.

652
00:56:29,214 --> 00:56:31,759
What?! Wait a second!

653
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,420
- You smashed my rear window!
- Where is she?

654
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:50,452
- For chrissakes, she's staying with us!
- I want you to take me to her.

655
00:57:00,445 --> 00:57:03,656
- She didn't go to her friend's.
- Where is she?

656
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:05,225
It's only 7:30!

657
00:57:05,363 --> 00:57:08,991
- I'm feeling sick again.
- She's in the guest room.

658
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:11,916
- What is it?
- He wants to talk to Nadia.

659
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,213
- But it's only 7:30.
- Look, Walter's out of control.

660
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:54,901
Can you hear me?

661
00:57:55,586 --> 00:57:58,965
- Yes. Who are you?
- It's Walter.

662
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:04,995
Walter, are you dead?
God, you look dead.

663
00:58:05,063 --> 00:58:07,941
How much do I owe you for my bail?

664
00:58:10,142 --> 00:58:13,562
I don't wanna be obligated
to you for anything.

665
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:18,907
Tell me how much I owe you.
I'll go home and write you a check.

666
00:58:18,899 --> 00:58:22,987
- Can we discuss this later?
- I don't have much time.

667
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,045
- Don't shout.
- I wasn't shouting.

668
00:58:26,137 --> 00:58:31,017
I know. I thought you were going to,
and I couldn't stand it.

669
00:58:36,694 --> 00:58:40,239
I go to court a week from this Friday.

670
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:43,921
After that, I'm told
I'll probably go to jail...

671
00:58:43,971 --> 00:58:45,722
...for at least two years.

672
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:50,479
I'd rather kill myself
than have you visit me in jail.

673
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:52,866
So tell me how much I owe you...

674
00:58:52,968 --> 00:58:56,346
...and then I never
wanna see you again.

675
00:59:07,163 --> 00:59:10,333
Ten thousand dollars!

676
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:17,938
Now get out of here,
you ungrateful monster.

677
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,544
Ungrateful?

678
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,681
I'm ungrateful?

679
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:26,926
I should be grateful after
what you did to me last night?

680
00:59:26,957 --> 00:59:29,877
After what I did?
What did I do to you?

681
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:33,126
You did a lot of things,
to a lot of people.

682
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:37,407
I just happened to be a part of it.
A big part, I recall.

683
00:59:37,434 --> 00:59:40,603
- You got me drunk.
- I didn't get you drunk.

684
00:59:40,673 --> 00:59:44,760
- You bought the champagne.
- You didn't have to drink it!

685
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:48,795
That's a cheap shot, Walter.
A real cheap shot.

686
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:52,708
I drank it because you
seemed sweet and generous.

687
00:59:52,749 --> 00:59:55,502
Somebody I could fall in love with.

688
00:59:58,067 --> 01:00:02,155
I thought you were special.
I really did.

689
01:00:02,226 --> 01:00:04,603
I'm sorry you got fired.

690
01:00:04,705 --> 01:00:09,460
I'm sorry you got arrested.
But you know why I'm most sorry?

691
01:00:09,463 --> 01:00:12,174
I'm sorry that you're not so special.

692
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:15,391
That you're mean and self-pitying...

693
01:00:15,461 --> 01:00:18,965
...and that you don't give
a damn about how I feel.

694
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,690
And I feel shitty, Walter!

695
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:28,085
Oh, God.

696
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:38,658
Where you going?

697
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:42,515
Want me to drive--? You want a cab?

698
01:00:49,571 --> 01:00:51,114
You're right.

699
01:00:51,249 --> 01:00:55,003
Without a great lawyer,
he'll probably go to prison.

700
01:00:55,088 --> 01:00:58,091
He's planning on defending himself.

701
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:01,469
He'll definitely go to prison.

702
01:01:04,926 --> 01:01:06,594
Will you defend him?

703
01:01:07,325 --> 01:01:09,035
Why would I do that?

704
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:13,518
Because you're greatly responsible,
that's why.

705
01:01:15,642 --> 01:01:19,521
You do have a point.
I am greatly responsible.

706
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:21,450
Not good enough.

707
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,861
If you do, I'll live with you.

708
01:01:28,957 --> 01:01:31,251
Still not good enough.

709
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:36,154
- Okay. Goodbye.
- I'll defend him on one condition.

710
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:37,822
What's that?

711
01:01:39,114 --> 01:01:41,116
Marry me.

712
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:47,454
I feel guilty about what I did
to Walter, but not that guilty.

713
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:52,601
Possession of an illegal firearm.
Assault with intent to commit murder.

714
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,134
Ten years, minimum.

715
01:02:10,424 --> 01:02:14,136
- Yes, Lupa.
- Miss Gates wishes to see you again.

716
01:02:14,183 --> 01:02:16,728
- Have her wait.
- Yes, sir.

717
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,832
You should know this up front.

718
01:02:25,299 --> 01:02:29,804
I don't like you anymore.
And I certainly don't love you.

719
01:02:29,978 --> 01:02:31,605
I don't blame you.

720
01:02:33,057 --> 01:02:34,850
Do we have to have sex?

721
01:02:42,334 --> 01:02:43,669
But no kissing.

722
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:53,314
All rise. Court is now in session.
Judge Harold Bedford presiding.

723
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:54,893
Be seated.

724
01:03:00,688 --> 01:03:02,357
Mr. Walter Davis.

725
01:03:06,486 --> 01:03:08,905
Thank you. Yes, Your Honour.

726
01:03:10,325 --> 01:03:14,121
I understand you refuse
to be represented by counsel.

727
01:03:14,164 --> 01:03:15,332
That's correct.

728
01:03:15,604 --> 01:03:19,608
Are you suicidal, Mr. Davis,
or just plain stupid?

729
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:23,726
Probably a bit of both, sir.
Your Honour.

730
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,261
I see.

731
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,777
Mr. Davis, it would be a humongous
understatement to tell you...

732
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:33,386
...how passionately I disapprove
of your actions.

733
01:03:33,437 --> 01:03:36,816
In fact, I'd be equally
critical of a physician...

734
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:41,381
...planning to perform
brain surgery on himself.

735
01:03:41,595 --> 01:03:45,390
- Yes, Your Honour.
- "Yes, Your Honour" doesn't do it.

736
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:49,146
Let the public defender
handle your case.

737
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:52,946
- That won't be necessary, Your Honour.
- Oh, shit.

738
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:59,773
- Sorry I'm late. I got it from here.
- Mr. Davis, would you explain this?

739
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:02,460
I'll represent Mr. Davis, Your Honour.

740
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:07,094
I was speaking to Mr. Davis!
I was under the impression....

741
01:04:07,107 --> 01:04:11,278
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing this as a favour to Nadia.

742
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:15,810
- Ensuring I go to the gas chamber?
- If you're not calm, I can't help.

743
01:04:15,823 --> 01:04:21,079
- Please don't let this man help me!
- Order in the court!

744
01:04:23,261 --> 01:04:27,098
One more outburst,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

745
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:33,183
- You all right, Agnes?
- Yes, Your Honour, I'm all right.

746
01:04:35,177 --> 01:04:38,722
Will counsel please
approach the bench?

747
01:04:39,656 --> 01:04:41,449
Hey! Your--

748
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:42,869
This is--

749
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:46,884
What the hell's going on?

750
01:04:47,294 --> 01:04:51,340
Not complicated. I decided
he shouldn't defend himself.

751
01:04:51,372 --> 01:04:54,917
- Bullshit. What's on your face?
- I was in a fight.

752
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:57,473
- With whom?
- Mr. Davis.

753
01:04:59,689 --> 01:05:02,400
- I don't want complications.
- Since when?

754
01:05:02,689 --> 01:05:04,649
I offer you a proposition.

755
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:08,606
- If you find my defendant innocent--
- Stop.

756
01:05:08,886 --> 01:05:12,890
You're crazy, trying to bribe
a superior court judge.

757
01:05:12,925 --> 01:05:16,303
I'll stop practising law
in your jurisdiction.

758
01:05:17,364 --> 01:05:20,950
- I don't believe you.
- I swear on Mother's grave.

759
01:05:21,003 --> 01:05:25,090
- Your mom's playing golf at Bel Air.
- I meant future tense.

760
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:30,543
- Go out of state. Say, Alaska?
- My heart's set on somewhere tropical.

761
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,565
- Change your name.
- Not practical. I'm getting married.

762
01:05:34,678 --> 01:05:39,016
You could honeymoon for
five or six years. All expenses paid.

763
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:42,790
- I don't think that would--
- I won't press my luck.

764
01:05:42,836 --> 01:05:45,505
- One more thing.
- I knew it.

765
01:05:45,595 --> 01:05:50,558
The wedding's at your house.
Invite all your influential friends.

766
01:05:50,554 --> 01:05:55,350
If I practice law in another state,
I want to drop some big names.

767
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:57,354
- Anything else?
- That's it.

768
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:02,417
I'll be breaking the law for
the first time, but it's worth it.

769
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:04,842
Thanks, Dad.

770
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:09,275
- Jesus.
- Sorry, Your Honour.

771
01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:15,758
What did you tell him? What?

772
01:06:15,865 --> 01:06:20,536
You can't railroad me into jail
so you can have a shot at Nadia!

773
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:23,130
- Quiet!
- Don't believe him! He's crazy!

774
01:06:23,222 --> 01:06:25,850
- He's trying to steal my girl!
- Order!

775
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:29,653
Order in the goddamn court!
Sorry, Agnes.

776
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,740
I find the defendant not guilty.
Case dismissed.

777
01:06:35,019 --> 01:06:40,149
- Take a 20-minute recess.
- All rise. Twenty-minute recess.

778
01:06:40,137 --> 01:06:42,014
Congratulations.

779
01:06:42,536 --> 01:06:45,665
- What happened?
- You're a free man.

780
01:06:46,015 --> 01:06:50,311
- Now you can congratulate me.
- What for?

781
01:06:50,493 --> 01:06:53,246
Nadia and I are getting married.

782
01:06:53,973 --> 01:06:56,851
And you're the one
who made it possible.

783
01:07:03,809 --> 01:07:06,896
- Where's Nadia?
- Baton Rouge, telling her mom.

784
01:07:06,968 --> 01:07:12,390
In the last few days my reality
has been tested to the limits, but--

785
01:07:12,367 --> 01:07:15,870
- Telling her mom what?
- She said to give you this.

786
01:07:22,323 --> 01:07:25,326
You are so lucky.
Why are you so unhappy?

787
01:07:25,403 --> 01:07:28,447
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna walk a while.

788
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,802
"Dearest Walter.

789
01:07:36,479 --> 01:07:38,606
You may not believe it...

790
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:42,139
...but I am sorry
for the trouble I caused you.

791
01:07:42,197 --> 01:07:46,326
I hope someday you'll find it
in your heart to forgive me.

792
01:07:46,356 --> 01:07:51,486
You're a special person, Walter,
and I'll miss you a lot.

793
01:07:51,474 --> 01:07:53,184
Love, Nadia.

794
01:07:53,713 --> 01:07:57,592
Oh, P.S. I hope you start
playing the guitar again."

795
01:08:21,584 --> 01:08:23,753
- Hello.
- Susie, it's Nadia.

796
01:08:23,863 --> 01:08:28,118
- Hi, where are you?
- Still in Baton Rouge. How's Walter?

797
01:08:29,382 --> 01:08:33,845
He seemed pretty good
when I talked to him on the phone.

798
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:37,531
He asked about you.
I told him you were...

799
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:41,625
- ...deliriously happy. Did I lie?
- No.

800
01:08:41,658 --> 01:08:46,955
Oh, honey. Just get out of this thing.
You're just gonna ruin your life.

801
01:08:46,976 --> 01:08:50,813
I can't. I know it sounds crazy,
but I made a deal.

802
01:08:50,855 --> 01:08:54,024
Look, I'll call you
when I get in. Bye.

803
01:08:54,094 --> 01:08:56,471
- Who's that?
- It's Nadia.

804
01:08:56,573 --> 01:08:58,158
How is she?

805
01:08:58,933 --> 01:09:01,393
She's deliriously happy.

806
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:20,077
- What is it, darling?
- Air.

807
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:23,252
The air here's so wonderful.
I just love it.

808
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:35,850
What, no merry-go-round?

809
01:09:35,961 --> 01:09:39,214
You promised David
a first-class wedding.

810
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:43,897
- A wedding, not Disney World.
- Don't be a shitheel, Harold.

811
01:09:43,918 --> 01:09:47,171
Your only son doesn't
get married every day.

812
01:09:47,236 --> 01:09:51,324
He's your son too.
It's time you take half the blame.

813
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:55,443
- Mom! Dad!
- See? He even gives you top billing.

814
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,204
Your soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

815
01:10:01,272 --> 01:10:02,815
- Hello.
- How do you do?

816
01:10:02,952 --> 01:10:06,831
- Well, let me show you to your room.
- Okay, fine.

817
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:11,869
What do you think?

818
01:10:11,989 --> 01:10:15,242
She isn't at all
what I thought she'd be.

819
01:10:15,347 --> 01:10:17,516
What did you think she'd be?

820
01:10:17,627 --> 01:10:19,337
Blind.

821
01:10:24,944 --> 01:10:27,322
- Plan to have children?
- Naturally.

822
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:31,178
- I know what to get you for a present.
- What's that?

823
01:10:31,223 --> 01:10:32,933
A vasectomy.

824
01:10:45,698 --> 01:10:50,203
The house is far too large
for us without David here...

825
01:10:50,216 --> 01:10:54,262
...but we're so emotionally attached.
We bought it in 1953...

826
01:10:54,295 --> 01:10:57,382
...the year after
Harold became a judge.

827
01:10:57,694 --> 01:11:00,780
- It's lovely.
- Thank you, my dear.

828
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:04,179
Where are you and David
planning on living?

829
01:11:05,131 --> 01:11:10,553
We haven't really decided yet.
I think David likes San Francisco.

830
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:15,982
I thought you had in mind
something more tropical.

831
01:11:16,008 --> 01:11:21,138
We really haven't decided on
a place yet. Miami, maybe. Honolulu.

832
01:11:21,127 --> 01:11:25,297
- I understand you're from the South?
- Louisiana.

833
01:11:25,325 --> 01:11:30,247
I love the South. I played
the front nine at Augusta once.

834
01:11:30,444 --> 01:11:33,989
- Did you let Rambo out?
- Yes, sir.

835
01:11:39,481 --> 01:11:42,567
Jesus Christ.
Good doggie. Nice doggie.

836
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,505
Oh, shit.

837
01:11:48,317 --> 01:11:50,319
She's lovely.

838
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:54,103
And bright.

839
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:58,880
To marry him,
she must have a screw loose.

840
01:12:01,034 --> 01:12:03,745
What is that dog barking about?

841
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:08,834
Jordan.

842
01:12:27,065 --> 01:12:28,733
Rambo! Shut up!

843
01:12:29,105 --> 01:12:32,150
You'll wake up
the whole neighbourhood!

844
01:13:06,892 --> 01:13:08,602
- Rambo!
- Jordan!

845
01:13:08,732 --> 01:13:11,109
- Yes, sir?
- What's with that dog?

846
01:13:11,211 --> 01:13:14,047
- I don't know, sir.
- Do something!

847
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:18,374
Come here, Rambo.
What the hell's got into you?

848
01:13:20,008 --> 01:13:23,845
Stop that! You keep quiet
or I'll call the vet...

849
01:13:23,886 --> 01:13:28,808
...and he'll cut them off
and you'll bark like Cyndi Lauper.

850
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:32,302
Help!

851
01:13:32,564 --> 01:13:34,649
Somebody open the door!

852
01:13:48,599 --> 01:13:50,059
Rambo, shut up!

853
01:13:50,198 --> 01:13:54,411
- Rambo, shut up!
- Jordan, shut up!

854
01:13:54,477 --> 01:13:56,271
Come on, Rambo.

855
01:13:59,795 --> 01:14:02,548
I want you to be quiet, you hear me?

856
01:14:03,674 --> 01:14:06,093
What the hell are you doing?

857
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:09,112
Planting corn!
What the hell do you think?

858
01:14:18,629 --> 01:14:21,549
I can't stand him. He's an idiot.

859
01:14:21,668 --> 01:14:24,754
Let's go back to bed
and forget him, okay?

860
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:27,705
Maybe if we think hard, he'll go away.

861
01:14:27,786 --> 01:14:30,706
If he leaves me this house,
I'll sell it.

862
01:14:30,865 --> 01:14:32,658
Tomorrow, yes.

863
01:14:36,863 --> 01:14:38,240
Good night.

864
01:14:39,143 --> 01:14:40,894
Miserable mutt!

865
01:14:41,022 --> 01:14:43,649
Would you like some hot cocoa?

866
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:47,995
Rambo can protect us
when the neighbours try to lynch us.

867
01:15:27,447 --> 01:15:29,616
I'm gonna kill that damn dog.

868
01:15:36,124 --> 01:15:38,043
What the hell was that?

869
01:15:44,642 --> 01:15:47,478
Oh, it must have been the wind.

870
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,251
There's no wind.

871
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,746
- What?
- What?

872
01:15:55,398 --> 01:15:56,816
Great.

873
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:04,501
Darling, my door's locked.
I guess the wind....

874
01:16:04,635 --> 01:16:06,637
David, it won't work.

875
01:16:06,755 --> 01:16:07,964
Now good night!

876
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,209
Great.

877
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:44,458
Here's Johnny!

878
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:03,243
You all right, Agnes?

879
01:17:10,014 --> 01:17:13,935
Look at me!
I'll have to take another shower.

880
01:17:14,012 --> 01:17:16,431
I hate this! Jesus!

881
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:18,793
Walter?

882
01:17:48,281 --> 01:17:50,617
It's not funny, David.

883
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,410
Jesus.

884
01:18:05,356 --> 01:18:07,816
Plant seeds in my pocket.

885
01:18:09,354 --> 01:18:11,607
Great. I'm filthy.

886
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:40,413
Why, what did you do that for?

887
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:52,552
There you are, you filthy beast.
How did you get out?

888
01:18:52,581 --> 01:18:56,252
Right. Come on.
Back in the pen you go.

889
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:04,598
You gonna move or aren't you?

890
01:19:36,566 --> 01:19:39,069
- What's that?
- It's for Miss Gates.

891
01:19:39,165 --> 01:19:40,750
I'll take it.

892
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:44,744
Why's he so happy?

893
01:19:44,884 --> 01:19:49,722
Hard to say. Last time he acted
like that, he'd run over the cat.

894
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:04,008
Hello. Good morning.

895
01:20:04,078 --> 01:20:08,666
- You look very happy, David.
- So do you, darling.

896
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:11,387
This is for you.

897
01:20:16,473 --> 01:20:17,933
Love you!

898
01:21:09,296 --> 01:21:13,509
Nadia, do you mind
if I eat this last chocolate?

899
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,329
Sure, Mama.

900
01:21:17,774 --> 01:21:20,360
These are filled with brandy.

901
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:26,630
You didn't eat this whole box?

902
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:28,316
I didn't?

903
01:21:51,003 --> 01:21:53,589
Shut up. Shut up!

904
01:22:37,388 --> 01:22:38,639
Dearly beloved...

905
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,291
...we are gathered here
in this beautiful home...

906
01:22:42,347 --> 01:22:44,307
...on this beautiful day...

907
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:48,013
...to witness the uniting
of two beautiful souls...

908
01:22:48,065 --> 01:22:49,983
...in holy wedlock.

909
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:52,690
Marriage is a sacred commitment...

910
01:22:52,783 --> 01:22:56,871
...designed on Earth
and sanctified in heaven.

911
01:22:56,901 --> 01:22:59,529
Without the institution
of marriage...

912
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:02,582
...mankind would still be
in the Dark Ages.

913
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:06,039
Consider the marriage symbol,
the wedding ring.

914
01:23:06,099 --> 01:23:09,102
A perfect circle,
without beginning or end...

915
01:23:09,178 --> 01:23:12,181
...signifying God's
eternal love and devotion.

916
01:23:12,536 --> 01:23:16,374
For where would we be
without God's love?

917
01:23:25,653 --> 01:23:26,695
Cheap shoes.

918
01:23:28,412 --> 01:23:29,996
You all right, Agnes?

919
01:23:32,211 --> 01:23:36,882
And let us be ever mindful
of the consequences of our acts.

920
01:23:36,889 --> 01:23:38,891
God is watching.

921
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:43,126
Oh, Lord, she did eat them all.

922
01:23:43,487 --> 01:23:45,280
Have you been drinking?

923
01:23:47,446 --> 01:23:48,989
The time has come...

924
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:52,753
...for David and Nadia
to make this commitment.

925
01:23:52,804 --> 01:23:56,724
Do you, David,
take Nadia to be your wife?

926
01:23:56,763 --> 01:24:00,350
- I haven't finished. To have and to--
- I do.

927
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:03,821
--in sickness and health,
till death do you part?

928
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,341
- Do you, Nadia, take David--
- Wait.

929
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:09,317
Is it indelicate
to ask what's going on?

930
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:13,194
- I don't love your son.
- Me neither. What's your point?

931
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:17,075
- Take deep breaths.
- Screw the guests!

932
01:24:17,116 --> 01:24:22,413
- This will take time. Have champagne.
- I know we had a bargain.

933
01:24:22,394 --> 01:24:25,522
- Play some music, and kill the dog!
- Honey--

934
01:24:26,313 --> 01:24:28,315
What's this about a bargain?

935
01:24:28,432 --> 01:24:31,518
People shouldn't marry
because of a bargain.

936
01:24:31,991 --> 01:24:33,326
Would you just--

937
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:35,891
Come back here and finish this!

938
01:24:37,549 --> 01:24:39,676
Stop the music!

939
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:48,165
Ladies and gentlemen,
maybe you can help me with this one.

940
01:24:49,866 --> 01:24:52,910
Say two people are gonna be married...

941
01:24:53,304 --> 01:24:56,015
...and one doesn't love the other one.

942
01:24:56,623 --> 01:24:59,960
The other only thinks
he loves the other one...

943
01:25:00,022 --> 01:25:03,317
...because the other one
really loves another.

944
01:25:03,381 --> 01:25:04,799
Are you with me?

945
01:25:07,299 --> 01:25:11,345
If two people don't love each other
should they get married?

946
01:25:11,858 --> 01:25:13,443
There you go.

947
01:25:13,617 --> 01:25:17,830
- If one adored the other one...
- But she didn't love him!

948
01:25:17,856 --> 01:25:21,151
...would die for her,
she'd learn to love him.

949
01:25:21,215 --> 01:25:25,427
But she loves another man
and would always think of him.

950
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:29,124
- Not if he's dead! Not now, Father!
- Would any of you--

951
01:25:30,252 --> 01:25:32,880
Hold it. Hold it.

952
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:36,970
The only way to get this resolved
is to take a vote.

953
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:39,721
All those in favour
of Nadia and David...

954
01:25:39,809 --> 01:25:43,521
...not getting married, say "aye."

955
01:26:28,353 --> 01:26:30,939
Nadia! Get your mouth away from him!

956
01:26:31,033 --> 01:26:34,870
Listen to me! Nadia!
Get your hands off of him!
