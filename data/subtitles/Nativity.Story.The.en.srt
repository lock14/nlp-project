1
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,400
The prophecy will end tonight, Father.

2
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,989
The sons of Bethlehem shall be no more.

3
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,255
A child.

4
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,429
For the lowest of men
to the highest of kings.

5
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,522
Carry out the orders of King Herod!

6
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,873
Not my son!

7
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,009
Pigeons for sacrifice!

8
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,013
- Half shekel for a pigeon.
- Four for sacrifice. Four.

9
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,895
- No blemishes.
- One shekel.

10
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,211
This honor is for you, Zechariah...

11
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,414
...and your village.

12
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,505
Zechariah.

13
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,596
Zechariah.

14
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,937
<i>Zechariah.</i>

15
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,284
<i>Your wife will bear you a son.</i>

16
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,705
<i>You will call him John.</i>

17
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,868
My wife is too old to bear a child.

18
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,498
<i>And he will be the prophet of the most high...</i>

19
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:51,425
<i>...for he will make ready
a people prepared for the Lord.</i>

20
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,462
But I am an old man.

21
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,556
<i>You will be struck dumb
and not be able to speak...</i>

22
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,478
<i>â€œbecause you believes! not my words.</i>

23
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,996
- Elizabeth.
- What's wrong, Zechariah?

24
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,116
He has seen a vision.

25
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,827
A vision from God!

26
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:12,169
- Stop looking at him. You'll get us in trouble.
- I'm not looking at him.

27
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,966
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

28
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,063
Mary.

29
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,026
- Ruth is waiting for you.
- But I was working.

30
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,078
She pays you to help her. You can't be late.
Here, take this with you. Hurry up.

31
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,833
Shalom, Mary.

32
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,809
Joseph.

33
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,694
That's all?

34
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,877
- It's burning.
- I know.

35
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,626
- Mary, you are late.
- Sorry.

36
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,502
You're not sorry.

37
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,672
Mary, the cheese.

38
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,012
Ask if she'll buy two today. It will help us.

39
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,221
The word of the Lord came to Elijah...

40
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,021
...and God said:

41
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,475
"Stand on the sacred mountain."

42
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:59,567
And behold, the Lord passed by...

43
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,490
...and a great wind rent the mountains...

44
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,161
...and broke in pieces
the rocks before the Lord.

45
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,286
But the Lord was not in the wind.

46
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,870
And after the wind, an earthquake.

47
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,503
But the Lord was not in the earthquake.

48
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:22,462
And after the earthquake, a fire.

49
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,800
But the Lord was not in the fire.

50
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,181
And after the fire?

51
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:34,390
A still, small voice.

52
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,985
Look.

53
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,616
Ruth, we made it just this morning.

54
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,869
Oh, thank you. I needed more.

55
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,460
Herod's tax collectors
will be here tomorrow.

56
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,758
- I know.
- Does your father have enough?

57
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,926
I pray that he's strong.

58
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,885
Men have had their own children
taken to satisfy their debt.

59
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,016
My father would never allow that.

60
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,271
Of course. God will deliver us, Mary.

61
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,946
Even the words I spoke to the children
tell of a new king...

62
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,899
...for those who have nothing.

63
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,580
How much will you give me?

64
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,519
Mary, let's go.

65
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,703
- Hey.
- Prepare to pay your taxes.

66
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,959
Two lines. Now.

67
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,506
Move, now.

68
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,297
No talking. Move.

69
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:31,006
One half shekel for the temple,
two shekels for Caesar...

70
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,841
...by order of King Herod.

71
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,888
You cannot pay tax
and have no land to offer?

72
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,519
The harvest will be strong
a few months from now.

73
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,567
Yes, but we are not here
for that harvest, are we?

74
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,238
The agreement was for you
to hand over one third of your land...

75
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,735
...to satisfy your debt.

76
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,365
- If I could have the land for one more year--
- What do you bring?

77
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,539
What do you bring in the hope
I will grant your request?

78
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,040
- Is that your animal?
- That's all I have.

79
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,296
The girl, take her.

80
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,046
No, no, no, please. I'll pay next time twice.

81
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,877
She will work to pay your debt. Next.

82
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,087
No! No!

83
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,049
Not my daughter!

84
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,725
Please, no, no! Ali-- Aliyah!

85
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,516
- Aliyah!
- Mary!

86
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,181
- No, please.
- Next.

87
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,938
- Step in line!
- No, please, no.

88
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,270
No! No!

89
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,827
Help!

90
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,713
Come here, Mary.

91
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,345
Aaron! Aaron!

92
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,267
Aaron!

93
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,972
Back in line, all of you.
Take this man's animal...

94
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,104
...and one-third of his land to be seized...

95
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,437
...for the continued good
of Herod's kingdom.

96
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,273
- Please, if I don't have enough land--
- What?

97
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,109
What, you and your family will die?

98
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,912
All of us must die.
Some sooner than others.

99
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,489
Move.

100
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,201
Kill it, we have enough.

101
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,829
You.

102
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,711
One half shekel for the temple.

103
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,262
Mary?

104
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,518
- How did you--?
- Soldiers, their thirst for blood...

105
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,900
...is matched only by their thirst for money.

106
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,778
Thank you.

107
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:58,829
Tell your father that they left her behind.
He needs his pride.

108
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,061
Your Excellency,
Masada will be as glorious...

109
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,990
...as your palace in Jerusalem.

110
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:44,120
The bathing pool,
fed by the water from the aqueducts.

111
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,335
Have them stop.

112
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,514
Build another pool up there...

113
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:05,186
...and have it spill into
the pool below as a waterfall...

114
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,016
...and cover the walls with golden tiles.

115
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,771
- To reflect the light.
- To reflect the light.

116
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,616
Your Excellency knows,
to acquire this much gold--

117
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,918
ls why I have loyal subjects.

118
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,255
The tax collection in Galilee,
any sign of rebellion?

119
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:40,760
- None that remain.
-"None that remain" means there was.

120
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,061
And what of the prophecy?

121
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,814
The awaited Messiah?

122
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,359
Is this the cause of their dissension?

123
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,564
The prophecy is a myth, Your Excellency...

124
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:02,699
...embraced by those unwise enough
to worship their true king.

125
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:09,285
What is unwise, Tero,
is to take such a prophecy too lightly.

126
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,386
Try, Gaspar.

127
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,015
Any clue we find may be the final piece.

128
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,810
"A star...

129
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,188
...shall come forth...

130
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,192
...from the land of--"

131
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,740
Of Israel?

132
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,071
"Israel."

133
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,698
But, Melchior--

134
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,701
The words speak
to the very pattern I have been watching.

135
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:52,160
Balthasar, if what
the prophet says here is true...

136
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,622
...a new Messiah could come
within our own lifetimes.

137
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,175
There is a star that has been moving...

138
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,424
...toward what the Romans call Jupiter.

139
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,223
If the two of them draw close to each other...

140
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,100
How many years from now?

141
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,902
It will not be years.

142
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,329
Mary.

143
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,999
You know Joseph.

144
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,751
You will be his wife.

145
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,796
"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God...

146
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,924
...king of the world...

147
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:48,508
...who sanctified Israel
by chuppah and betrothal."

148
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,581
Take it.

149
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:21,087
The law says you will stay with us
for another year...

150
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,760
...then you will go into his house.

151
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,885
You will consider him your husband now...

152
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,890
...in all manner except that
which leads to family.

153
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,104
On that, you must wait.

154
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,782
I'm building a house.

155
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,071
Enough for a family.

156
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,960
Mar--

157
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,549
I'll talk to her.

158
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,228
Shalom, Mary.

159
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,451
Mary, come.

160
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,749
Come with us, Mary.

161
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,496
Mary.

162
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,123
Come.

163
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,381
<i>Why do they force me to marry</i> a <i>man...</i>

164
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,888
<i>...I hardly know?</i>

165
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,595
<i>A man I do not love.</i>

166
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,229
Why is Father doing this? Why now?

167
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,281
We have barely enough to feed all of us.

168
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,486
Your grandfather, your cousins.

169
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,450
He did this for you.

170
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,874
Joseph is a good man.

171
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,918
Strong man.

172
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,716
I was married even younger than you.

173
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,759
So was my mother.

174
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,181
There is always hope, Mary.

175
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,764
Even in Nazareth?

176
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,138
Even in Nazareth.

177
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,784
<i>Hail, O favored one.</i>

178
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,291
<i>The Lord is with you.</i>

179
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,544
Do not be afraid, Mary...

180
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,878
...for you have found favor with God.

181
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:58,091
Come, you will conceive in your womb...

182
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,848
...and give birth to a son...

183
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,100
...and you will call his name Jesus.

184
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,812
How can this be,
since I've been with no man?

185
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,990
The Holy Spirit will come upon you...

186
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,820
...and a power from the most high
will overshadow you.

187
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,704
And the holy offspring
shall be called the son of God.

188
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,036
Son of God?

189
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,711
Mary...

190
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,256
...even your cousin Elizabeth...

191
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,551
...has conceived a son in her old age...

192
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:38,052
...for nothing said by God
can be impossible.

193
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:48,149
Let it be done to me,
according to your word.

194
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,327
<i>How is anyone to believe me?</i>

195
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,079
<i>How are they to understand?</i>

196
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:29,709
"Even your own cousin has conceived a son
in her old age."

197
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,962
Elizabeth.

198
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,294
This is foolish talk.

199
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,757
Elizabeth is not expecting you now.

200
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,388
She says I'm always welcome.

201
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,595
So does Zechariah.

202
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:54,274
You said you wished to visit in the summer.
That's what you told us a season ago.

203
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,398
Much has changed since then.

204
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,568
And what of Joseph?

205
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,492
Is he to expect your return?

206
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,070
He is.

207
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,661
Jacob and his family
are going south in the morning.

208
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,459
I've told Sarah
I can help with the children.

209
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,394
Then make certain Zechariah finds
a good family for you to return with.

210
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,599
Thank you.

211
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,650
I'll be here for the harvest.

212
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,898
I promise.

213
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,363
Stop it!

214
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,916
Help!

215
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,049
Herod's soldiers are coming!

216
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,719
- Get down! Get back!
- It's Isaac.

217
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,887
Herod took his land!

218
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,557
Block the road!

219
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,184
- Hurry!
- Block the road!

220
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,514
- Stop them!
- Hurry!

221
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,971
- Hurry!
- Quickly!

222
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,431
The soldiers are behind us.
Stop their horses.

223
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,910
Death to Herod!

224
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,449
The Messiah will save us!

225
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,831
Herod is--
God will deliver us!

226
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,392
A Messiah...</i>

227
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,186
<i>...to deliver my people.</i>

228
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,613
<i>Please, Lord...</i>

229
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,659
<i>...let Elizabeth be with child
as the angel spoke.</i>

230
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,080
Go!

231
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,217
Elizabeth!

232
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,015
Elizabeth!

233
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,229
- Elizabeth.
- Oh, child.

234
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,603
Oh, child!

235
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,732
Blessed are you among women...

236
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,360
...and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

237
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,487
But how could you know?

238
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,741
Who am I that the mother of my Lord
should come to me?

239
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,994
The moment I heard your voice...

240
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,542
...my child leapt in my womb for joy.

241
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,087
Blessed is she
who believes the Lord's words.

242
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,674
The star is here.

243
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,427
Jupiter is here.

244
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,180
But look.

245
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,603
Another star!

246
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,556
No. Venus.

247
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,768
If I am correct, and I usually am...

248
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,728
...all three will appear to touch...

249
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,485
...for the first time in 3000 years.

250
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,239
Venus is called the mother planet.

251
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:36,788
Jupiter, the shining father. Don't you see?

252
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:42,120
Mother and father aligned in the heavens
as one.

253
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,289
And the star itself?

254
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,626
It is called Sharu.

255
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,925
Babylonian.

256
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,391
For "king."

257
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,286
He's been silent
since he came out of the temple.

258
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:28,044
- Not a word?
- He writes.

259
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:33,846
He writes of who our son will be.
What he will become.

260
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,593
God will lift his burden.

261
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:40,803
I have told him the same,
but he feels unworthy.

262
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,901
Are you frightened?

263
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,735
Yes.

264
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,999
A husband has been chosen for me.

265
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:11,175
The law says I was to remain pure for a year.

266
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,252
How is he to believe this?

267
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,340
Stay with us, then.
We will pray for guidance.

268
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,223
Elizabeth...

269
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,266
...why is it me God has asked?

270
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,403
I am nothing.

271
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,362
Oh, child.

272
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,012
Elizabeth!

273
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,265
What is it, child?

274
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,474
He is moving.

275
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,231
Mine too.

276
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,547
Barren desert. inhospitable plains.

277
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,644
Rugged mountain ranges.

278
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,938
Then Jerusalem.

279
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,910
Surely you speak of
a spiritual journey, Melchior.

280
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,407
Not one that would actually take you there.

281
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,869
- You wish to travel to the land of Judea?
- No.

282
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,329
I wish for all of us to go.

283
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,127
Melchior...

284
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,425
...this land you speak of...

285
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,128
...it will take months to journey there.

286
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:23,091
We know nothing of the dangers
we may find.

287
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,971
And you're following a star...

288
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,473
...only because it burns bright?

289
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,685
Balthasar, surely you will join me.

290
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,942
The star will be as bright here as anywhere.

291
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,774
You said yourself
it would be a star over Judea.

292
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,575
But, Melchior--

293
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,531
Yes, but I would need my instruments,
my charts.

294
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,082
- Take them.
- But what about my cushions?

295
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,205
My pillows?

296
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,588
What about the food I'm accustomed to?

297
00:31:54,788 --> 00:32:01,387
- Very accustomed to.
- Yes. I need my dates, my nuts, my spices.

298
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,680
What about my wine, Melchior?

299
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,010
If you need another camel,
I'll bring it for you.

300
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,729
Join me.

301
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:17,653
- Both of you.
- They will be wasted months.

302
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,574
I'm sorry, but I cannot join you.

303
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,910
Only one more camel?

304
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,185
Now breathe.

305
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,037
A son.

306
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,563
He's beautiful.

307
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,185
- What name have you given him?
- He shall have the name of John.

308
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,815
John?

309
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,236
But, Elizabeth...

310
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,111
...there is no one in your family
who bears that name.

311
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,068
Zechariah would not wish for this.

312
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:35,534
If he could speak, he would want a name
that honors such a blessed child.

313
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,459
Where does this name
come from, Elizabeth?

314
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,664
Where all names come from.

315
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,749
His name is John.

316
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,798
He speaks!

317
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:55,052
- Zechariah!
- His name is John.

318
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,937
You're building a strong house.

319
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,649
It will hold your family well.

320
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:18,701
I wish to have the roof on before her return.
Before the harvest.

321
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:23,334
Joseph, she has never broken a promise.

322
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,870
And a great wind rent the mountains...

323
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,871
...and broke in pieces
the rocks before the Lord.

324
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,043
But the Lord was not in the wind...

325
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,543
...nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire.

326
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,421
And after the fire...

327
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:13,176
...a still, small voice.

328
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,434
You are a good father, Zechariah.

329
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,400
It's time for me to return home.

330
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,217
The blacksmith will take you
all the way into Nazareth.

331
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,261
Mary.

332
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,432
Thank you.

333
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,620
Fools.

334
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,122
I think I will have a few words with him.

335
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,799
Would you let him know I want to see him?

336
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,930
- You wished to speak with me, Father?
- This collection...

337
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,225
...has revealed an opposition to my rule...

338
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,769
...that I find myself concerned with.

339
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,599
Opposition that may rise above mere words.

340
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,481
The kingdom will be yours, Father...

341
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:37,657
-...until the last of your breaths.
- You are the opposition I speak of, Antipas.

342
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,537
I hear that my subjects
are rising against me...

343
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,536
...and what do I hear from my own son?

344
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,169
I hear his silence.

345
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,457
Judea, Samaria, Galilee...

346
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,169
...all of them talk of this prophetic king...

347
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:02,474
...this man who will defeat me.
Yet you do not speak against it.

348
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:08,181
Father, you have no greater ally
than the man who speaks to you now.

349
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,856
I know this. I do.

350
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:18,986
Because you and I, Antipas,
we are the same.

351
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:25,156
And the man who inherits my kingdom
will have the same intentions as I do.

352
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,833
But hear me when I tell you, my son...

353
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:34,290
...that you will never,
never live to see your rule...

354
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,795
...if you fail me now.

355
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,465
I have had a wife betray me.

356
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:45,051
I have had two sons do the same
before you.

357
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,935
Where are they now?

358
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,682
- No more.
- No more.

359
00:39:55,059 --> 00:40:01,408
I will end this threat to my rule,
<i>as</i> I will all threats.

360
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,813
I don't really miss him.

361
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,115
Neither do I.

362
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,214
You forgot the map.

363
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,255
You wouldn't have been able
to survive without me.

364
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,262
- How do you know?
- Because I am the wisest.

365
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,166
Mary.

366
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,044
- Mary's back!
- Mary!

367
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,344
Joseph, Mary's back.
She's back. She's back.

368
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,350
She's back?

369
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,941
Mary! Mary!

370
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,486
Can I go?

371
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,363
She's back.

372
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,206
Mary.

373
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,732
Joseph?

374
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,278
Joseph.

375
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,284
Joseph!

376
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:09,634
An angel told you this?
That you will bear the son of God?

377
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,884
Mary.

378
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,050
Elizabeth had a baby.

379
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:18,058
- Even in her old age.
- Elizabeth has a husband!

380
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,561
Women have been put to death for this.

381
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,107
They could stone you in the street.

382
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,074
Do you understand?

383
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,541
You should have stayed with Elizabeth.

384
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,660
Father.

385
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,421
Father...

386
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:48,593
-...I have broken no vow.
- Oh, you have broken every vow, Mary.

387
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,298
Was it one of Herod's soldiers?

388
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,052
Was it?

389
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,560
I have told the truth.

390
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,064
Whether you believe is your choice.

391
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,986
Not mine.

392
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:15,696
- And what of Joseph?
- He's a good man, Mary, but this?

393
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,497
- This is too--
- Let me speak.

394
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:23,412
Please. Let me speak.

395
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,755
Anna.

396
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,888
Come.

397
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,356
Joseph--

398
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,233
Do you know...

399
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,867
Do you know the reason I chose you, Mary?

400
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,991
I believed you were a woman of great virtue.

401
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,708
I have lived my life seeking honor.

402
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,797
Honor.

403
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,175
Mary, so how am I to answer this?

404
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,978
If I claim this child is mine, I will be lying.

405
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,815
I will have broken a law laid down by God.

406
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,692
I would never ask you to lie.

407
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,696
If I say this child is not mine,
they will ask what I want to do.

408
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,699
And if I accuse you...

409
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,923
There is a will for this child...

410
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,131
...greater than my fear of what they may do.

411
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,569
I will make no accusation.

412
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,867
Without that, there can be no trial.

413
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,502
You have shown great mercy, Joseph.

414
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,623
For that I will be thankful.

415
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,199
Thank you.

416
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,612
Stone her!

417
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:42,573
- Stone her!
- Let Joseph cast the first stone!

418
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,339
Now, Joseph!

419
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,259
Joseph.

420
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,053
<i>Fear not...</i>

421
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:05,053
<i>...for that which is conceived in Mary
is of the Holy Spirit...</i>

422
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,305
<i>...and she shall be...</i>

423
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,710
Mary.

424
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,178
"And you shall call his name Jesus.

425
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,933
For it is he who will save his people
from their sins."

426
00:48:55,558 --> 00:49:01,486
I know. Mary, God showed me.
An angel came to me in my dream.

427
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,866
You believe me?

428
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,453
I believe you.

429
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:12,496
Your child will need a father.
I will declare him as my own.

430
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:20,342
People, they will not look at you the same.
They will not look at us the same.

431
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,794
You are my wife.

432
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,848
I am your husband.
That is all anyone need know.

433
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,644
<i>And after this...</i>

434
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:43,482
<i>...there shall arise a star from Jacob.</i>

435
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,776
<i>And a man shall arise like the sun...</i>

436
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:51,911
<i>...walking with the sons of men in gentleness
and righteousness.</i>

437
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,247
<i>This is the shoot of God most high.</i>

438
00:49:56,452 --> 00:50:00,502
<i>This is the fountain of life, of all humanity.</i>

439
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,877
<i>You see, Gaspar...</i>

440
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,804
<i>...that's why we follow the star.</i>

441
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,025
Rome is requesting a census.

442
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:06,573
- Each man to return to the place of his birth.
- Such an order will lead to unrest.

443
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,026
- The people whisper of rebellion even now.
-It is the will of Caesar.

444
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,987
My father lost his life...

445
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:17,166
...because he failed to see the threat
that was mounting against him.

446
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,243
From his own people.

447
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:23,460
Now, all it will take is one man.

448
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:27,669
One man to convince the people
he is their Messiah.

449
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,342
The prophet said this man...

450
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:35,017
...will rise from the house of David.

451
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:40,139
This census would bring him back home.

452
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,901
Have your soldiers and your spies...

453
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,151
...keep watch for a man
returning to Bethlehem.

454
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,449
A man of power.

455
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,743
A man the people will follow.

456
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:09,803
Town of Nazareth, in the name of King Herod
and the almighty Caesar...

457
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:14,508
...you are ordered to participate
in a census of all people.

458
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:19,221
Each man will return
to the land of his ancestors...

459
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:24,355
-...along with each member of his family.
- And what if it's a four-day journey?

460
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,652
Then you would be wise to leave soon.

461
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:32,404
You have one month!
And any resistance will be dealt with.

462
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:43,753
More taxes for Herod.

463
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,128
Does that surprise you?

464
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,124
I cannot register here.

465
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:55,052
The order was for each man to travel
to the place of his ancestors.

466
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,802
I must go to Bethlehem.

467
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,227
But the journey to Bethlehem
is more than 100 miles.

468
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,521
I know.

469
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,600
For me and for each member of my family.

470
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,028
They will allow her to stay.

471
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,481
- They cannot expect--
- They will allow nothing.

472
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,407
Mother...

473
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,986
...the days before my child comes
are greater than those of this journey.

474
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,741
There is time.

475
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:22,701
That is a question for God to decide, not you.

476
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,132
I'm going with my husband.

477
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:36,430
Then you must leave in the morning.
Take the animal.

478
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,223
No. No.

479
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,518
Take it, Joseph.

480
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,937
Thank you.

481
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,565
I will protect your daughter and the child
with all that I am, I promise you.

482
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,118
There is no well before the Sea of Galilee.

483
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,074
Here.

484
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,869
Mary.

485
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,079
You're a strong young woman.

486
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,666
- Thank you, Father.
- Go.

487
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,947
They're going to miss us.

488
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,327
Slow down.

489
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,284
Yes, come.

490
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,342
For you.

491
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,119
He's moving.

492
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,962
You've never really told me of your dream.

493
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,344
My dream?

494
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,385
No.

495
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,016
No, please.

496
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,642
Tell me.

497
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,317
The angel came to me...

498
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,194
...and he told me the child within you...

499
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,778
...had been conceived by the Holy Spirit.

500
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,076
And that I should not be afraid.

501
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,788
Are you afraid?

502
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,289
- Yes. Are you?
- Yes.

503
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:05,468
- Do you ever wonder when we'll know?
- Know? Know what?

504
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,805
When he's more than just a child.

505
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,021
Will it be something he says?

506
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,141
A look in his eye?

507
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,478
I wonder if...

508
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,280
...I will even be able to teach him anything.

509
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,378
it was good we brought one more camel...

510
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:23,084
-...or that might be your dinner.
- Perhaps we should have brought another.

511
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:27,046
- The journey would be more bearable.
- Tell me, Gaspar...

512
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,973
...how many days has it been
since we departed?

513
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,392
One hundred and four.

514
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,185
And how many of those days...

515
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:37,890
...have you spoken with regret
for having journeyed with us?

516
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,772
One hundred and five.

517
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,779
I'm counting tomorrow.

518
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,117
Stop.

519
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,920
- Where are you headed?
- From Nazareth to Bethlehem.

520
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,090
Bethlehem? Search him.

521
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,234
Go.

522
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,693
He's not the one.

523
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,872
Goats.

524
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:39,498
Shout in triumph, O daughter of Judea.

525
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,796
Behold, your king is coming to you.

526
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,045
He is just and endowed with salvation...

527
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:50,008
...and His dominion will be from sea to sea...

528
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:52,840
...and from the river to the ends of the earth.

529
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:58,179
And He shall speak peace unto the heathens.

530
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:07,942
Almonds! I have almonds!

531
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,283
Olives!

532
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,501
- For you.
- No.

533
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,750
No, no. For you. For your child.

534
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,798
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

535
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,804
You carry him like a son.

536
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,480
To see yourself in a young face,
there is no greater joy.

537
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:02,247
Behold, your king is coming to you. He is.

538
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:07,081
- Help, help! Soldiers! Soldiers!
- And his dominion will be from sea--

539
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,007
- Silence!
- In the name of King Herod.

540
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,460
And from the river to the ends--

541
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:19,594
<i>I will end this threat to my rule...</i>

542
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,304
<i>...as I will all threats.</i>

543
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,003
Pass your sins on to the animal.

544
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,883
[cow GRUNTING]

545
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,947
Their animal is weak.

546
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:26,572
For the first time in 3000 years...</i>

547
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,125
<i>...all three will appear to touch.</i>

548
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,564
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

549
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,111
Ho, ho, ho, shh, shh.

550
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,788
What? More?

551
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:13,084
No, no, no. I am the hungry one, not you.

552
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:44,817
If I am doing your will,
I pray you'll give me a sign.

553
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:42,170
Come on. Come.

554
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:58,478
Come on. Come on.

555
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,327
- Joseph!
- Mary!

556
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,034
Joseph!

557
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,874
Mary!

558
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,183
Joseph.

559
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,558
My child...

560
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,514
...you will have a good
and decent man to raise you.

561
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:05,442
A man who will give of himself
before anyone else.

562
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,429
Jerusalem.

563
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,559
The Holy City.

564
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,336
Fresh-picked almonds!

565
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,586
Some jewelery for your beautiful wife.

566
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:14,669
That's a good animal.
Would your husband be willing to sell him?

567
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:15,924
No.

568
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,554
What belongs to us stays with us.

569
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,571
For sacrifice.

570
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,456
Doves. Golden doves. No blemishes.

571
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:43,956
Good for sacrifice.

572
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,296
- Herod, Herod.
- Herod's here.

573
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,833
- It is the king.
- The king. The king is here.

574
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,062
No, no. No.

575
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,618
Pigeons for sacrifice.

576
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,835
No. Enough! No.

577
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,207
This was meant to be a holy place.

578
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,393
Bethlehem. This way.

579
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,753
These shepherds...

580
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:16,128
...they live alone most of their lives.

581
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,762
Your woman looks cold.

582
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,558
Just for a moment.

583
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,813
I will tell our child about you.

584
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:42,362
About your kindness.

585
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:47,994
My father told me a long time ago...

586
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:51,371
...that we are all given something.

587
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,662
A gift.

588
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:59,668
Your gift is what you carry inside.

589
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,173
What was your gift?

590
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:07,717
Nothing.

591
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:12,055
Nothing but the hope of waiting for one.

592
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,776
We must go if we're to reach
Bethlehem by dark.

593
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,113
We thank you.

594
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:39,625
- Good for sacrifice.
- Good pigeons.

595
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,836
- Pigeons for sacrifice.
- One half shekel.

596
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,467
One half shekel.

597
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:49,392
- What brings you here?
- We are visitors from the east.

598
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,594
We follow the star.

599
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,599
The star of the prophecy.

600
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:58,150
- The prophecy of the Messiah?
- The Messiah.

601
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,404
Come. All of you.

602
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:05,734
Magi. The wisest of the wise.

603
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,239
Tell me what they claim.

604
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:11,789
They believe that a new king
awaits them now in Judea.

605
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,498
Father, we must send your
soldiers to follow them...

606
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:21,458
- ...until they find the man we seek.
- And raise their suspicions?

607
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:24,044
Then we risk not finding this king at all.

608
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:30,346
Invite them to dine with us.

609
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,062
Your arrival is by the hand of Providence.

610
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:38,812
For years I have studied
the words of the prophets.

611
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:42,691
"Out of Bethlehem shall come a ruler...

612
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,648
...who shall shepherd my people, Israel."

613
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:49,360
Your Excellency,
I too have studied these words.

614
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:53,493
I have waited a lifetime
for the signs I now see.

615
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,076
As have many.

616
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:01,256
This star, the one that you have followed...

617
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,799
...tell me, what does it mean?

618
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,173
The prophecy speaks of a child--

619
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:10,803
Heralded by the star we have followed
these many months.

620
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:16,355
What do you mean, a child?
Are you not here seeking a man?

621
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:20,733
A man ready to proclaim himself Messiah?

622
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,606
No.

623
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,938
A child.

624
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:30,155
A Messiah for the lowest of men
to the highest of kings.

625
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:35,661
We, too, have been waiting for God's king.

626
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,583
For years.

627
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,582
When you find him...

628
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,007
...please return to <i>us...</i>

629
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:50,380
...so that we may come worship him as well.

630
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:10,407
Joseph, the child is pressing.

631
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,281
The child...

632
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,079
- Now?
- Now.

633
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,953
Yes. We're very close.

634
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:29,843
Bethlehem.

635
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:32,012
We're here.

636
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:33,681
We will find a place.

637
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,510
I promise.

638
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,451
God be with you. ls there a place
for my wife and me to stay?

639
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,403
I'm sorry, there is no room here.

640
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,166
Please. Please.

641
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:11,674
Is there an inn? ls there a place for us?
My wife, she's in pain.

642
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,925
- Is there a place for us?
- No.

643
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:18,763
- Open the door!
- Go away!

644
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:21,517
- Help!
- Please, Lord.

645
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,313
Will you not provide for us?

646
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,642
Is there someone? Help us!

647
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,976
Leave us alone!

648
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,279
Joseph! Joseph!

649
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,358
Mary! Mary!

650
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:42,707
Help!

651
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,087
I beg you!

652
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:50,838
I ask not your home, but any place you have.

653
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,715
It's all I can do.

654
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:24,163
Melchior, Gaspar.

655
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:32,879
A star shall come forth.

656
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,571
<i>Sorry.</i>

657
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:37,148
Oh, Mary!

658
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,108
<i>Raw.!</i>

659
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,638
How is your faith now?

660
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,853
<i>Rejoice.</i>

661
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,819
Rejoice.

662
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,994
I bring you good tidings of great joy.

663
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,913
For unto you is born this day...

664
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:55,166
...in the city of David,
a savior who is Christ the Lord.

665
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:59,916
You will find a child wrapped in cloths...

666
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:03,094
...and lying in a manger.

667
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,334
Are you well?

668
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,385
I have been given the strength I prayed for.

669
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,963
Strength from God.

670
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,600
And from you.

671
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,514
He is for all mankind.

672
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,912
We are each given a gift.

673
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:07,380
The greatest of kings,
born in the most humble of places.

674
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:19,429
God...

675
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,770
...made into flesh.

676
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,210
Gold.

677
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:53,170
For the king of kings.

678
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,646
Frankincense.

679
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:14,988
For the priest of all priests.

680
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,688
A gift of myrrh...

681
01:27:56,855 --> 01:28:00,029
...to honor thy sacrifice.

682
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:21,819
If I am right, and I usually am...

683
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:26,620
...perhaps we should keep
what we have seen to ourselves.

684
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,678
We shall not return to Herod.

685
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:59,065
What if your soldiers
were to go to Bethlehem...

686
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:02,569
...and find every young boy there...

687
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,321
...under two years?

688
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:10,076
What would happen
to their new Messiah then?

689
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:33,141
The prophecy will end tonight, Father.

690
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:37,183
<i>The sons of Bethlehem shall be no more.</i>

691
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:49,657
A child for the lowest of men...</i>

692
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,364
<i>...to the highest of kings.</i>

693
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,964
Arise, Joseph.

694
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:19,311
Look over there!

695
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,639
<i>Take the child and his mother...</i>

696
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,351
<i>...and flee to Egypt...</i>

697
01:32:02,559 --> 01:32:06,154
<i>...and remain there until I bring you word.</i>

698
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,550
The Almighty has done great things.</i>

699
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,180
<i>And holy is His name.</i>

700
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,062
<i>He has shown strength with His arm.</i>

701
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:53,405
<i>He has scattered the proud.</i>

702
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:05,209
<i>He has filled the hungry with good things.</i>

703
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:11,257
<i>And the rich he has sent away empty.</i>

704
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:22,556
<i>He has brought down rulers
from their thrones...</i>

705
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:28,646
<i>...and has exalted
those who were humble.</i>
