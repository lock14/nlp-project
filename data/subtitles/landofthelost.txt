1
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:20,707
Mission control come in.

2
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,780
Mission control, do you read?

3
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,713
Mayday...

4
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:29,154
Mayday!

5
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:33,028
I'm re-entering Earth's orbit,
I seem to have fallen into...

6
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:36,371
I don't know, some kind
of tear in time and space.

7
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:37,961
My coordinates are unknown.

8
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:39,973
And is either...

9
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:45,639
Seems entrance indicate it
should be White Sands, New Mexico.

10
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,110
Obvious error.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,781
Is anyone receiving this?

12
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:55,517
Recovery team!

13
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:58,189
Recovery team, fix coordinates now!

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,181
Where the hell am I?

15
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:02,863
Somebody respond!

16
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,005
Recovery team come back, god damn it.

17
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:09,339
Oh god, oh god.

18
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:11,069
Anyone re
-!

20
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:27,574
This is TODAY with Matt Lauer.

21
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:32,648
We're back now with Dr. Rick Marshall
whose new book arrives in stores tomorrow.

22
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:38,283
It was back in Oslo, Doctor, last month
that you just startled your colleagues,

23
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:41,765
with this theory of yours that takes
science in a completely new direction.

24
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:42,706
Quantum Paleontology.

25
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:44,117
Quantum Paleontology, that's correct.

26
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:45,288
What exactly is that?

27
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:49,602
Well it's a...not to say very
modestly...it's our very future Matt.

28
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:54,326
It's the only real solution to solving
this fossil fuel crisis we're experiencing

29
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:56,648
and it boils down to two simple words.

30
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,360
Renewable bio-fuels?

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,960
Close.

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,341
Time Warps.

33
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:03,754
Time Warps? You're serious about this?

34
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:04,654
I'm deadly serious.

35
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:08,548
Five years, over fifty million
dollars on my research...

36
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:12,422
You spent fifty million dollars of
your own money, studying Time Warps?

37
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:13,463
No, that's adorable.

38
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:15,714
No, tax payers' money. I don't
have fifty million dollars.

39
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:17,215
And now you're asking for more?

40
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:18,927
It's all explained, in my book.

41
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:19,948
I know we plugged the book.

42
00:02:19,948 --> 00:02:21,419
My Other Car is a Time Machine.

43
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:23,161
Bantum books, Amazon...

44
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,053
We're living in a time right
now, with huge cuts in spend-

45
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,346
I saw, huge cuts in spending. -Right

46
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:31,017
We're in dire economic straights,

47
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,600
and you're spending fifty million
dollars on studying Time Warps?

48
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,671
How do you not think
that's irresponsible?

49
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:37,702
Are you smoking?

50
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:39,394
No I'm making a balloon animal here.

51
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:40,745
You can't smoke in the studio.

52
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:41,826
No one told me that.

53
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,478
Listen, you can't.

54
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:44,349
Fine.

55
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:49,482
There are huge huge amounts of trans
- dimensional energy out there

56
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:52,685
just waiting for us to throw the
switch, energy crisis averted.

57
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:57,189
You are asking people to stake the entire
future of industrialized civilization,

58
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:59,721
on what you call Parallel Dimensions?

59
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:03,354
What about the critics who have
a fair question doctor, they say...

60
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:06,767
This theory of yours is not
science, it is non-science,

61
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:09,349
and some even more
bluntly say it's nonsense.

62
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,530
How do you respond to that?

63
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,181
My critics?

64
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,622
Your critics, there are a lot of them.

65
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:13,483
Could you be more specific?

66
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:14,524
Steven Hawking.

67
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:18,426
Steven Hawking says this is
nonsense, that's his word.

68
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:20,638
You know what this interview's over.

69
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:21,269
Why?

70
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,152
Your producer said you
wouldn't bring that up.

71
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:25,133
It's a fair question.

72
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,524
No it's not, it's a hatchet job!

73
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:31,287
That was my guest Dr. Rick Marshall
his book arrives in stores tomorrow,

74
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:35,151
you might want to look for it in the
I'm out of my freakin' mind department.

75
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:39,115
When we come back, trampolines.
Summer fun or silent killer?

76
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:50,533
Ladies and gentlemen.

77
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:51,955
Esteemed colleagues.

78
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,566
I'll conclude with this.

79
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:56,689
Our very future depends on one thing.

80
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,140
Tachyons.

81
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:03,054
Sub-atomic particles that move so incredibly
fast they actually travel backwards in time.

82
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:07,778
Ask yourself, what if there was a
device that could harness these tachyons.

83
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,222
We could open and travel
through warps in time and space.

84
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,393
What's that?

85
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:15,435
Not in our lifetime?

86
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:18,858
My friends, I've designed such a device.

87
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,891
I give to you the Tachyon Amplifier.

88
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,242
Genius in a box.

89
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:28,426
Only with this device, you don't
travel forwards or backwards.

90
00:04:28,756 --> 00:04:30,478
You travel sideways in time.

91
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:35,051
To another dimension where past,
present, and future all meet.

92
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,443
And, lights.

93
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:39,625
Alright...

94
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,297
Any questions?

95
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:44,389
Oh, great. Yes, you
right there young man.

96
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:48,913
Yeah, if you shot a ton of pot at the sun,
would it burn up and get everybody high?

97
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:50,034
No, no...

98
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,277
Are there any real questions
that pertain to science?

99
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:54,577
Do you take Cialis?

100
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:57,580
Why were you crying in the
bathroom before this presentation?

101
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,432
How come it looks like
you're about to cry now?

102
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:01,143
Do Dinosaurs have boobs?

103
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,865
That's it. That's it,
everybody out of here.

104
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:03,626
Get out of here.

105
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:07,138
Go play in the parking lot. Go run
around on the Freeway, I don't care.

106
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:08,960
I have a question.

107
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,822
Did you ever try to make
the Tachyon Amplifier?

108
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:12,853
Who're you?

109
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:13,954
Oh, I'm sorry.

110
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:16,956
I'm Holly Cantrell, I studied
all your work at Cambridge.

111
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:19,498
I think you're brilliant.

112
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,122
Well, Holly from Cambridge
who thinks I'm brilliant.

113
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:26,015
I started, but I didn't finish so no.

114
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:28,286
No but you have to build
it, it's the most incredible-

115
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,667
What are you eating?

116
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,760
It's a dough nut stuffed with M&M's.

117
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:36,203
That way when you finish the dough
nut, you don't have to eat any M&M's.

118
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:39,595
But don't you see you are
absolutely right, everything-

119
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,136
Stop.

120
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:44,710
Chasing that theory got me laughed out
of main stream science and landed me here.

121
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:47,732
But you know what, I don't
got anyone to blame but myself.

122
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,283
Because as they say...

123
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:52,777
If you don't make it,
it's your own damn "vault."

124
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,809
That's a bitch slap
of truth right there.

125
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,112
If your theories are such rubbish.

126
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,243
Then explain this.

127
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:09,380
That fossil is over 265 million years
old with an imprint of a $10 lighter.

128
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,551
Go on and explain that.

129
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:16,237
I found that out in the desert along with crystals
like this that radiate pure tachyon energy.

130
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:18,579
Go on.

131
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,480
Explain that.

132
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:56,130
Captain Kirk's nipples...!

133
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:03,376
The tar pits will be opened in 5 minutes,
Dr. Marshall please return the page.

134
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:06,308
Dr. Marshall?

135
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:10,983
Oh god.

136
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:13,444
Are you alright?

137
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:14,325
Hey!

138
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:15,666
Up you go.

139
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:21,151
Dear...

140
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:22,222
I'm fine.

141
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:23,293
I'm okay.

142
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,054
I just worked late.

143
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,016
Then I got hungry.

144
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:30,109
Ate several meals and
lapsed into a food coma.

145
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:32,911
I've had issues with food in the past.

146
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,774
I don't know, you know just with the
stress of everything I just overdid it.

147
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,006
But I'm in control.

148
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:41,388
Now I don't have to go back to Phoenix.

149
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,552
I just wanted to come by,
and apologize for yesterday,

150
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:48,113
my behavior was just...

151
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:49,084
No, no, no...

152
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,537
You finished the Tachyon Amplifier!

153
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:54,960
No, no...I mean yes.

154
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:56,740
I-I don't know...

155
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,752
I finished building it yes, but...

156
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:01,255
I didn't have the nerve to test it out.

157
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:05,659
So I thought a trip to Arby's
might give me some courage, no dice.

158
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,400
But I hit Popeyes, Del Taco...

159
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:10,973
Fourteen thousand calories later.

160
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,774
I found myself down at Subway.

161
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:16,087
Powering through a 12
inch veggie on whole wheat.

162
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:18,829
Battling to come out a "Jared."

163
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,662
Still didn't give me the
strength to turn that thing on.

164
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:23,724
I'm a coward.

165
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,675
You are not a coward,
you're a visionary.

166
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:29,918
This is probably the greatest work
of genius in the last hundred years.

167
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:40,657
Is that a chorus line?

168
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,689
It's left over data from the drive.

169
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,951
What a piece of crap!

170
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:47,654
The machine I mean

171
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:49,455
Not a chorus line.

172
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:51,967
I love show tunes, they really tell
the story of the human condition.

173
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:54,309
It's a bit gay.

174
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,431
It is great.

175
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:57,993
Right.

176
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:00,734
Dr. Marshall you're going to
stop selling yourself short,

177
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:03,056
you're on the verge of a
major discovery, now get up!

178
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:04,107
Whoa, where are we going?

179
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:06,470
We're going to test this
little device, in the field.

180
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,692
Are you crazy? I'm not
prepared for a field test!

181
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:12,094
No, I'm not going to make a big deal
out of it just a routine expedition.

182
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:13,855
A routine expedition?

183
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:15,087
Purely routine.

184
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,831
Here, here it is. This is
where I found the fossil.

185
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:33,762
The Devil's Canyon mystery cave.

186
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:35,213
This dump is a portal?

187
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:36,985
Would you look at these readings?

188
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:39,017
We just gotta get back in that cave.

189
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:41,059
No problem, the place
is obviously abandoned.

190
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:42,740
Not exactly.

191
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,591
What's your pleasure?

192
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:47,824
I got Roman Candles, Bottle Rockets,
Twitter Glitters, Dancing Butterflies?

193
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,677
This little bitch right here
I call the Mexican Vasectomy.

194
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:51,518
Yeah?

195
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:54,179
Okay, that's some bad taste.

196
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,171
How 'bout this?

197
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,534
This is a little travel mug I
like to call, the perfect woman.

198
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:02,567
Big ol' set of boobies,
no head and a handle.

199
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,339
Look we want to go in the cave, alright?

200
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,670
Okay, how about this.

201
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,673
Ya'll spend $30 on crap,
I'll give you a deluxe tour.

202
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:11,104
It all goes to a great cause.

203
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:15,057
The Devil's Canyon Resort & Casino!

204
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,892
Wow, that's nice craft.

205
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:24,035
Seven thousand
luxuriously appointed rooms

206
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:25,236
Three casinos.

207
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,666
One convention center.

208
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:28,028
Ass-tons of parking.

209
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,529
And when everything is complete,

210
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,012
I will turn the tip of this golden
tee-pee into my personal lair.

211
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:36,535
And I will take a mate, and live
the rest of my life with her up here.

212
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:40,108
When we fight, and she pisses me
off, I will banish her to this tip,

213
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:42,530
where she will be kept
as a prisoner and a slave.

214
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:44,792
So you gonna buy anything?

215
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:46,054
Yeah, fine.

216
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:51,578
Hey Earn, taking these guys
to the cave. Watch the store.

217
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:57,023
Close your mouth while you're
breathing like we talked about.

218
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:58,523
Making everybody over here feel wierd.

219
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:10,063
Prepare to meet your darkest fears inside
the depths of the Devil's Canyon mystery cave!

220
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:13,927
Rule number one, keep your
arms and legs inside the boat.

221
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,730
Rule number two, have
a kick ass awesome time!

222
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,601
But be warned...

223
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:21,683
You may get wet.

224
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:23,545
I'm sorry, may?

225
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,867
Actually, I need to know
this equipment cannot get wet.

226
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:27,829
Not you, Mary Poppins

227
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,480
Bam-chica-wow-wow...

228
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,982
Say that again, and I'll drown you.

229
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,514
Good to go!

230
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,227
Woo, cave ride begins!

231
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:40,619
Woo!

232
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:52,939
They all just say this old cave is a hundred
years old and holds a thousand mysteries.

233
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,543
Or is it thousand years
old, and a hundred mysteries.

234
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,377
Well that my friends, is
just one of the mysteries.

235
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,319
Say what you will my man, as a showman.

236
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,411
Without a doubt.

237
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:12,286
This cave is most infamous for the
legend of the Devil's Canyon lizard man.

238
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,798
He's been seen around these
parts since the pilgrim times.

239
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:20,673
Snapping his claws, hissin,
tryin' to eat people up.

240
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:25,356
Lurking about in the dark
dark shadows of this very cave.

241
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,493
But those are just legends, aren't they?

242
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:36,676
Aren't they?!

243
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:39,599
Are you asking us?

244
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,510
No, no.

245
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,961
Earnie! Aren't they?

246
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:42,922
Here it comes, Will!

247
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:45,964
Oh god!

248
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:47,615
The lizard man!

249
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:50,808
You're paying for that.

250
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:52,290
I most definitely am not.

251
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,112
You know I'm sitting here trying to
give you guys a really awesome adventure,

252
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,064
and you guys are giving
me nothing in return!

253
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:00,636
I got the gloves on,
the hat, the pageantry!

254
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,969
Holly, I'm getting a
strong Tachyon reading!

255
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,031
I think I can boost the hell out
of this signal with a resonant wave!

256
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:07,942
Go for it!

257
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:09,394
You guys don't even care.

258
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:15,349
No no, there are no
showtunes on this ride!

259
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:22,785
Something's happening!

260
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:24,607
Is this part of the ride?!

261
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:27,558
Nah, this ain't me!

262
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:28,920
It's an earthquake!

263
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,012
Greatest earthquake ever known!

264
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:33,744
Marshall, I think you should turn it up!

265
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:37,638
The meter!

266
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:40,600
We're moving!

267
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,272
This isn't me, this isn't me!

268
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:44,643
Why are we moving so fast?!

269
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,906
Do I look like I know what's going on?!

270
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,871
What's that sound?!

271
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:56,133
Is there a waterfall in here?!

272
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,036
Hell no dude, this
isn't even a real stream!

273
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:02,068
It's industrial run off of the
soap factory down the street!

274
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:07,323
What is that?!

275
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:08,954
Oh shit!

276
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:11,596
This is not a routine expedition!

277
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:13,678
Reverse!

278
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,770
It's beautiful!

279
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:57,915
I gotta say I did not see that coming.

280
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:01,248
Earnie! You bastard!

281
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:02,880
That was way too fast.

282
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,410
Earnie!

283
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,142
Too fast!

284
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,425
Marshall!

285
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:26,158
I think you should
come and look at this!

286
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:32,794
Do you realize what this means?!

287
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,436
Yes!

288
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,816
It means...

289
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:38,028
Matt Lauer can suck it!

290
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:44,805
Holly, are you rolling? -Yes!

291
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:46,346
That was a viking ship and a-

292
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,336
Shut up just shut up!

293
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:48,918
Okay, currently in our party...

294
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:50,739
Me, Dr. Rick Marshall.

295
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:56,214
Doctoral candidate Holly Cantrell and some trashy
tailer park reject who smells of malt liquor and feet.

296
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:57,095
I'm standin' right here!

297
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,005
I was right!

298
00:15:58,215 --> 00:15:59,006
Holly, right here!

299
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,547
Just as I predicted we have been...

300
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:06,183
We've fallen through a time portal from our Earth,
to another dimension where past, present and future,

301
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:07,724
are all mashed up together!

302
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:08,874
How the hell did this happen?

303
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:10,926
My Tachyon Amplifier,
that's how it happened!

304
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,569
You mean that shitty boombox
pumpin' showtunes? -Yes, it worked!

305
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:14,630
Where the hell is it?

306
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:16,872
Okay, minor set back.

307
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:22,346
My tachyon amplifier, which undoubtedly will be
the only possible way for us to open a doorway home.

308
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,837
Is nowhere to be seen.

309
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,561
What the hell was that?

310
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:30,282
I have no idea but let's go find out!

311
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:41,472
Primates!

312
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:44,975
I heard they had the posture of an
Australopithecy but it's actually quite-

313
00:16:44,975 --> 00:16:45,866
No, no, no...shut up!

314
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:49,689
I will not let you ruin this moment, I waited
my entire life to see the mighty big foot!

315
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,061
Man, are you touching yourself?

316
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:53,031
Marshall, look!

317
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,914
Oh my god!

318
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,096
Tool construction!

319
00:16:58,647 --> 00:16:59,798
Tool construction!

320
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:00,989
Yea! They're gonna kill him!

321
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,471
No!

322
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:11,978
Okay you egg heads you follow my lead.

323
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,149
I know just how to
party with these guys.

324
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,621
You little monkey bastards!

325
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,144
Prepare to bow down and worship me!

326
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:21,806
For behold, ye' Troglodytes...

327
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:25,439
I command the power of...fire!

328
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:27,591
Will, that's not a good idea.

329
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,202
How do you like me now huh?

330
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:31,144
You want to disco dance you-

331
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:32,605
Ouch! Son of a bitch...!

332
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,220
Well done.

333
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,363
You've just now given murderous
primitives the power of fire.

334
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,024
It's alright.

335
00:17:57,386 --> 00:17:58,767
It's alright don't be frightened.

336
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,481
We're friends.

337
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:08,545
Friends.

338
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,417
Careful Holly.

339
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,678
Come on.

340
00:18:11,978 --> 00:18:12,919
Come on!

341
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,161
Come on.

342
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:16,922
There we go.

343
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:19,204
I spent 3 years at the
Manchester Primate House.

344
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:22,767
I'm recognizing their
very primitive language.

345
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,170
Now..

346
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,533
Me? Holly.

347
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:34,547
Yes, Holly!

348
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:36,709
Holly.

349
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,050
Me? Holly...

350
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,311
You?

351
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:47,148
Cha-ka?

352
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:48,199
Cha-ka!

353
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:51,982
No, Holly...Cha-ka!

354
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:54,564
Wi-ill...

355
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:55,805
Will...

356
00:18:58,508 --> 00:18:59,778
Good work Holly.

357
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:00,989
Let me take over from here.

358
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,501
Greeting Cha-ka!

359
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:04,833
Cha-ka?

360
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:08,166
I'm Dr. Rick Marshall.

361
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:11,518
Doctor Rick...Marshall?

362
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:12,829
Okay?

363
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,951
Let's take a look at that ankle.

364
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:16,573
Does that sound good?

365
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:22,117
Keep in mind Cha-ka, although I'm a
doctor, I'm not a licensed physician.

366
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,240
Okay? Just going to take a little look-

367
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,692
How dare you! How dare you!

368
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:29,564
I mean you no harm!

369
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:30,204
Marshall, Marshall!

370
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:31,344
Don't you run from me you little shit!

371
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:34,948
Now you're dead!

372
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:44,816
Damn it Chaka!

373
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:46,718
Now was that necessary?

374
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,832
Marshall! Marshall,
wait stay where you are.

375
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:52,652
What was that?

376
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,374
Look he was never in any danger, okay?

377
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,655
Cha-ka! Friend!

378
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:57,297
Safety! Safety!

379
00:19:57,787 --> 00:19:58,668
Safety!

380
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:00,159
Holly, tell him.

381
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:02,882
Marshall?

382
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:04,062
Marshall...

383
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:07,145
Haboo! Haboo!

384
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:10,078
Haboo?

385
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:10,928
Haboo.

386
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:18,154
Well that's more like it.

387
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:19,525
Holly what did you tell him?

388
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:23,289
I think I told him that you're a
great chief, and you're very powerful.

389
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,000
And I think he's pledging
his life long loyalty to you.

390
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:29,093
That's hardly necessary
my little friend.

391
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:31,245
But I will honor your customs.

392
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,227
And you may serve me.

393
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:38,901
In return I will be a fair
but very strict master.

394
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:42,955
What?!

395
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:45,067
What is wrong with you people?!

396
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:46,628
That sand dune swallowed us!

397
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,881
I mean could you all please stop act
like this doesn't happen everyday?

398
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,722
You're starting to make
me feel really stupid!

399
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:54,165
Okay, hold on. Let's gather ourselves.

400
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:55,876
Take a deep breath in.

401
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:08,816
Fortunately...

402
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:13,030
I've been in this exact
situation...three times before.

403
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,031
When?!

404
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:15,353
When have you ever
been in this situation?!

405
00:21:15,353 --> 00:21:17,134
I've never been in
this situation before!

406
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:18,905
Just tryin' to keep up morale!

407
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:22,828
Oh god...

408
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,600
I sure hope that was a Coyote.

409
00:21:29,093 --> 00:21:31,916
Good god, it's a feeding station!

410
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,929
If anyone knows about
meal presentation, it's me.

411
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,540
Oh god, oh god!

412
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,731
Grab hands!

413
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,882
Create some momentum and
swing over to that tree.

414
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:43,876
Extension!

415
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:46,459
Reach!

416
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:49,962
Good form everyone!

417
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:52,864
Working in concert!

418
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:55,486
Don't be afraid to point the toe!

419
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:57,908
One more!

420
00:21:58,539 --> 00:21:59,730
One more should do it!

421
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,711
Everybody move out!

422
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,433
Cha-ka, your master
commands you to-

423
00:22:17,064 --> 00:22:18,035
Bad Cha-ka!

424
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,987
Your loyalty is now in question!

425
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:24,580
That was a Dinosaur?

426
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,551
T-Rex!

427
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:26,782
Definitely in predator mode!

428
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:29,024
Would you hurry up,
you're slowing us down!

429
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:30,986
Why are you wearing high heels!

430
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:32,888
They're not high heels, they're
my Floor Shine Zipper Boots!

431
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:35,399
Why are you wearing Floor
Shines on a field expedition!

432
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,331
I told you I was no prepped
to go into the field.

433
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:42,306
Wait, wait! We need a photo!

434
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:43,567
Nice field skills, Holly!

435
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:44,487
Stand over there!

436
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:44,917
What?!

437
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:46,909
This is proof that I'm
right and I want photos.

438
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,260
Stand there we need you for scale!

439
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,911
Scale?!

440
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:50,963
Marshall, do we to
turn on Red-Eye feature?

441
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:53,205
Yes! His eyes do look red.

442
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,555
Jesus Christ, just take the picture!

443
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:56,227
Okay just stand still!
-Stand still please.

444
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:58,399
One, two, three...

445
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,010
Fantastic, run!

446
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,811
Run like hell!

447
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:05,114
Where the hell's the monkey?

448
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:09,728
Look!

449
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:11,980
Cha-ka's waiting for us at
the other end of the bridge!

450
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:14,533
Good Cha-ka, your master is pleased!

451
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:17,294
Marshall!

452
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:19,807
It really looks like he's just
trying to destroy the bridge.

453
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:21,278
Chaka, wait!

454
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:22,469
Master not pleased!

455
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:35,220
It's okay, he can't cross he
has terrible depth perception.

456
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,812
Thinks this chasm is
a million miles long.

457
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:40,844
He's not what you'd call an athlete.

458
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:42,306
Mister T-Rexes.

459
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:43,437
See?

460
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:46,510
Walking away in utter,
and helpless defeat.

461
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:49,932
After all their brain
is the size of a walnut.

462
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:54,346
Their sense of smell may be acute, but eye
sight, hearing, all of his higher functions,

463
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:57,639
completely compromised by
that walnut sized brain pan.

464
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,560
I mean forget about the Polish.

465
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:02,613
It's the T-Rexes who were
the real dummies of the world.

466
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:04,234
In fact Chaka, funny story...

467
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:10,169
Run!

468
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:13,782
Follow the monkey!

469
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:33,789
He's looking at you, Marshall.

470
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,761
He's watching you.

471
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:36,832
He's looking at everyone.

472
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:39,704
No I'm certain he's looking at you.

473
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:54,126
He is grumpy.

474
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:58,170
I think that's what we
should call him, Grumpy.

475
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,851
It's a cute name.

476
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:04,935
Is it gone?

477
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:06,206
Yeah.

478
00:25:07,227 --> 00:25:08,088
Pussy!

479
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:11,962
What a puss...

480
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,609
This'll work just fine.

481
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,772
We'll call this base camp.

482
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:26,803
No, no...we cannot stay here!

483
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:29,586
Bad things happen in caves
folks, watch your movies!

484
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:32,148
Guys, can we just please take a
minute to absorb this, I mean...

485
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,412
We must be, the first ones to ever step
foot in this world, it's incredible!

486
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:07,017
Oh god, we're screwed.

487
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,711
No, no!

488
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:28,855
Chaka, no...No!

489
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:36,322
Okay you know what?

490
00:26:36,593 --> 00:26:38,474
I don't want Chaka sleeping
in the cave tonight.

491
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:40,145
Whoa! Not cool dude.

492
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:42,387
No, it's a reasonable
precaution alright?

493
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:46,241
He was just about to be executed, and I think
he might've done something to deserve it.

494
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:47,742
Hey my man is right here.

495
00:26:47,742 --> 00:26:49,464
Obviously he has feeling, okay?

496
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:50,484
Doesn't have feelings!

497
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,796
Man, come on look at him he's adorable.

498
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:54,007
He's a little cuddle machine.

499
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:54,407
What?

500
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:56,559
Yeah, least you can do
is let him defend himself.

501
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,790
I don't speak monkey.

502
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,732
Anyhow...do you?

503
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:01,223
No I didn't think so.

504
00:27:01,223 --> 00:27:02,444
Here let me try.

505
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:04,426
Chaka?

506
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,495
He says he's a prince
amongst his people.

507
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:24,272
And the victim of a treacherous
plot to steal his throne.

508
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:28,947
And the only thing he's
ever guilty of was...

509
00:27:30,478 --> 00:27:31,359
Is love.

510
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:33,570
Brother, give me a break.

511
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:38,725
And he's been treated far too harshly
for the very simple crime of...

512
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:41,738
Pooping in the village well.

513
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:43,638
That's why you're not
sleeping in the cave.

514
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:48,303
I can't tell anymore.

515
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,208
Okay mister...

516
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:56,709
Silently
- Fuck you!

517
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:02,075
Whoa, hold on! Where
you going with that?

518
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:04,946
I'm just gonna block the first point-of-egress
here so that we're not vulnerable.

519
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:06,327
No...no...

520
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:07,809
Bless your heart.

521
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,151
Classic, tender foot mistake.

522
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,303
Don't beat yourself up over it.

523
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:13,764
Here's the thing.

524
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:16,536
Never put anything near the mouth
of the cave to draw attention to us.

525
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:20,209
Did you not just see that we drew the attention
of a highly intelligent psycho Dinosaur?

526
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,433
Look I think the "Ph.D" after my name means
I know a little something about Dinosaurs?

527
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:26,915
Dinosaurs are creatures
of brute instinct.

528
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:30,218
Like I said before it's got
a brain the size of a walnut!

529
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,609
Okay? You got me?

530
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:32,920
A walnut.

531
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:35,453
What's that?

532
00:28:36,043 --> 00:28:36,973
What's that?!

533
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,794
Sweet Gregor Mendel...

534
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:03,086
What? What is it?

535
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,779
It's a walnut.

536
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:16,027
Well, obviously this
is between you and him.

537
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:23,172
Day 2, 0600...Zulu time.

538
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:25,765
Did not sleep last night at all.

539
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:27,316
Not one bit.

540
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:31,899
Still no sign of the tachyon
amplifier our...our only way home.

541
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:36,394
Field rations are...are
running dangerously low.

542
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:42,699
Thusly, I've made the determination that
if need be, if faced with starvation...

543
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:46,002
we will cook and eat...Chaka.

544
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:49,265
I've been thinking about
this a lot actually.

545
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:54,749
If Chaka meat were the secret ingredient
on Iron Chef, I'm sure Bobbly Flay would,

546
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:58,823
probably serve it with a roasted
red peppers, and a dash of cumin.

547
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:00,694
And a braze of polenta.

548
00:30:01,945 --> 00:30:03,596
Wouldn't be an easy thing to do but...

549
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:07,990
but if you slow roast the little guy I'm sure
that Chaka meat would just fall right off the bone.

550
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:11,924
Fruit train coming through!

551
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:14,265
Fantastic! I'm absolutely starving.

552
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:16,127
Which fruit shall I-

553
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,898
Whoa, hold on a second there Holly.

554
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:19,960
I don't recognize that
genus of succulent.

555
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:23,193
Perhaps the native
inhabitant can help us.

556
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:25,234
Chaka?

557
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:26,545
Rick Marshall!

558
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:27,416
Chaka!

559
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:29,508
Are they safe?

560
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:30,619
To eat?

561
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,801
Eat? Eat..eat?

562
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:36,764
Eat!

563
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,155
Eat, eat?

564
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:39,537
Thank you Chaka!

565
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,359
Thank you so much, for listening to me.

566
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,161
Sorry for doubting you my little friend.

567
00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:47,623
Has a pungent flavor, smells good!

568
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:48,854
Very meaty-

569
00:30:50,926 --> 00:30:51,977
Jesus Chaka!

570
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:53,569
What the hell?!

571
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:00,054
Friends?

572
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:01,595
Friends?

573
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:06,859
Well? Yes, technically I guess.

574
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,251
However I am your master.

575
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:12,264
We have entered into a verbal contract.

576
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,346
You need to understand that.

577
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,721
Holly, quick to the cave mouth.

578
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:21,632
Sentry positions!

579
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:31,600
Looks like a plasma discharge.

580
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,891
Or maybe beta-rays!

581
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:35,294
Marshall?

582
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:36,555
Marshall!

583
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:37,966
Marshall?

584
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:40,237
Help...

585
00:31:40,538 --> 00:31:41,418
Me...

586
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:43,000
Please...

587
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:44,641
I will.

588
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:46,243
Marshall?

589
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:48,635
Marshall, where are you going?

590
00:31:48,885 --> 00:31:50,676
Someone or something knows we're here.

591
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:52,548
It's in my head calling to me.

592
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:53,359
Get back Holly!

593
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,000
What are you doing?!

594
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,763
I've seen this before!
He's got the jungle madness!

595
00:31:57,763 --> 00:31:59,844
We gotta put him down while
he's still has some dignity left!

596
00:32:00,014 --> 00:32:01,055
Chaka, let's roll!

597
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:01,815
What?!

598
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:10,853
You see?

599
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:12,294
This is the place!

600
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:14,336
A beacon!

601
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,058
A transmitter!

602
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:18,200
Tapping directly into my prefontal lobe!

603
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:22,433
What the hell?!

604
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:23,374
Stop it!

605
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:24,655
Well I'll be...

606
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:26,316
I guess you weren't crazy.

607
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:27,377
Okay...

608
00:32:27,618 --> 00:32:29,469
I'm man enough to say that's my bad.

609
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,594
Wow, has incredible architecture...almost
like the almanac culture of Western America.

610
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:37,656
Reminds me of the prudential building.

611
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:47,474
I'll bet somebody's
growing weed in here.

612
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,810
Feel that?

613
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,311
That ambient energy?

614
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,103
Just like at Devil's Canyon.

615
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:00,405
Yeah, tachyon radiation.

616
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:02,357
Marshall, the meter can't be far.

617
00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:12,786
Finally something cool huh?

618
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:14,587
What, no reaction?

619
00:33:14,897 --> 00:33:17,880
You guys have seen that before
too I take it huh? In your lab...

620
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:20,112
What's this thing?

621
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:23,615
Maybe this is where ancient
ancestors hosted the latin Grammy's.

622
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:26,737
Just picture Santana
hauling this sucker around.

623
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:30,350
It vibrates.

624
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,832
I wouldn't touch that alright.

625
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:35,885
Do you believe in life after love!

626
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:37,896
That is so dumb and childish.

627
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:42,521
Do you believe in life after love!

628
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:46,124
Will could you please be quiet,
Dr. Marshall needs silence.

629
00:33:46,664 --> 00:33:49,746
I can feel something inside me say

630
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:53,800
I really don't think
you're strong enough, no!

631
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:57,703
Really feel it in my forearms.

632
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,404
Yeah, you usually have to
pay for something like this.

633
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:02,257
Holly you should sit on this.

634
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:07,472
What?

635
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,534
What is it Chaka?

636
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:11,585
What'd you say?

637
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:14,848
What's he saying?

638
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:16,820
I don't know if this is anything
I've ever learned...Sarisa?

639
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,071
Sarisa Taka?

640
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:19,641
Chorizo Tacos?

641
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:21,413
Are you saying Chorizo Tacos?

642
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:23,415
Don't play around
because I am super hungry.

643
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:26,237
Sarisa
-?

644
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:27,939
What the hell does that mean?

645
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:30,971
Well...

646
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,662
I'm afraid we'll never know.

647
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,601
Okay...

648
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,465
Oh shit it's not Chorizo Tacos.

649
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:51,798
No immediate danger,
cold blooded and slow.

650
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,412
I repeat, no immediate danger.

651
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:57,774
Would you stop that?! Please!
You are freaking me out!

652
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:04,469
They're everywhere!

653
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:05,700
Just like zombies!

654
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,962
That's how zombies get you! Volume!

655
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:10,144
We're all gonna die!

656
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:11,296
Like hell...

657
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:14,317
I'm gonna take at least one
of these bastards with me,

658
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:16,289
even if you have to choke
to death on my skull!

659
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,502
What you want some too do you?

660
00:35:20,974 --> 00:35:22,195
What are you guys doing?!

661
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:22,945
One second...

662
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,885
What in the hell?

663
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:39,159
Get in!

664
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,102
Wait stand down Holly.

665
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:46,194
Hang on...

666
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:48,426
Hang on I think we're safe.

667
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:50,358
They don't seem to be able to
make it through the entrance.

668
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:51,559
Thank god for that.

669
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:53,471
That one keeps peering into my soul.

670
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:54,662
This is just fantastic.

671
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:58,004
Now we're just going to stand in here
and suffocate in this tiny little...

672
00:35:59,526 --> 00:36:00,376
Huge...

673
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:01,748
Thingy...

674
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:04,240
Wow that is an efficient use of space.

675
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,850
Like Snoopy's dog house.

676
00:36:07,772 --> 00:36:09,604
Look, there's a gold one.

677
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,366
Let's stomp his head in.

678
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:13,378
Do not fear me.

679
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,319
I am Enik

680
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,120
The Altrusian.

681
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:20,813
Thank Vindok you've come
to my aid Rick Marshall.

682
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:22,065
You know me?

683
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,066
Of course.

684
00:36:23,636 --> 00:36:27,399
Even in the farthest reachest of the
universe we've seen your Matt Lauer video.

685
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,692
I am a prisoner in
this Land of the Lost.

686
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,574
Only you can help me escape.

687
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:36,587
The fate of the universe depends on you.

688
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:38,198
Well...

689
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,770
Thats very flattering...Enik.

690
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,763
But I think you've found the wrong guy.

691
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:48,566
No Rick Marshall, I have summoned you here
specifically to help me stop an evil mad man who

692
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:50,748
has already conquered my world.

693
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,541
And now plans to conquer yours.

694
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:54,762
His name is...

695
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:57,305
The Zarn.

696
00:36:57,895 --> 00:37:01,618
I am the Zarn, heed my
warning or be destroyed.

697
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:06,502
The Zarn became obsessed with using the power
of these crystals to conquer the universe.

698
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:10,435
If he is not stopped he will
open a doorway to your world,

699
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:15,780
and lead his army of Sleestak on
a rampage across time and space.

700
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,322
He must be stopped.

701
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:19,663
Enik...

702
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:20,753
Buddy...

703
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:23,756
I'm a scientist, you're a scientist.

704
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:26,799
I think together you and
I could figure this out.

705
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,341
You mustn't touch the crystals!

706
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:34,595
Wrong manipulation of the crystals
could turn time and space inside out.

707
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:36,487
What do you need from us?

708
00:37:36,617 --> 00:37:39,860
The Zarn lacks only one
thing to enact his evil plan.

709
00:37:40,421 --> 00:37:45,194
A device to amplify tachyons and
unleash the full power of the crystals.

710
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,597
Well Marshall has created a device
that isolates tachyon interference.

711
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:49,618
Yeah I did that.

712
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,743
Of course, with tachyon particles focused
along the proper temporal vector...

713
00:37:55,743 --> 00:38:00,498
...a stable passage way could be opened
to any point in the space time continuum.

714
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,020
You and I are so smart.

715
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,133
Rick Marshall, I knew
instantly you could help me.

716
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:07,914
Thank you.

717
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:10,586
You are a truly advanced intellect.

718
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:13,709
I don't know how you
manage amongst these others.

719
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,900
I don't know how I do it
either, I really don't!

720
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,981
Excuse me?!

721
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,333
You have this tachyon amplifier?

722
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:23,237
I lost it on the way in, I don't
know where...it could be lost in time.

723
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:24,987
On the contrary I detect it nearby.

724
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:26,139
It...

725
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,250
Strange...

726
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,443
I cannot precisely pin
point its location it...

727
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:31,664
...moves.

728
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:33,275
Leave it to us.

729
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:34,416
If it's out there.

730
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,237
We'll find it.

731
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:36,577
Not so fast amigo.

732
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:38,329
Little rule I live by.

733
00:38:38,629 --> 00:38:40,391
Never trust a dude in a tunic.

734
00:38:40,891 --> 00:38:42,193
You live by that rule?

735
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:42,923
Yes.

736
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:44,535
It's never led me astray.

737
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,415
Come on Enik, are you
well enough to travel?

738
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:48,958
No, my place is here in the pylon.

739
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,659
I must protect the crystals.

740
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,864
If you wish to return home these crystals
are the doorway. Your device is the key.

741
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,446
Find it before the Zarn does.

742
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:01,218
Bring it to me, and rescue us all.

743
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,721
Rescue the uni-verse.

744
00:39:06,984 --> 00:39:08,514
Alright everyone gather around.

745
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:10,496
Let's go, chop chop.

746
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:11,527
Hustle up.

747
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:13,619
Marshall did you just make that?

748
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,802
Yeah, I'm a bit of a
miniatures enthusiast.

749
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:18,833
It's very impressive.

750
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,334
Thank you.

751
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:23,037
Yeah well I see some
obvious scaling issues...

752
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:24,198
I think its pretty damn good.

753
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:26,410
Alright.

754
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,711
We are here.

755
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:30,092
As you can see desert, forest...

756
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:32,074
What's this look like?

757
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,235
The cave.

758
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:34,576
That's the cave, that's
where we're living.

759
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:35,998
Standard volcano.

760
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:36,949
Okay?

761
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:41,512
Now, I will tether Will to
this hot air balloon right here.

762
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,845
Okay, it will be fitted with
a crude tachyon reflector array

763
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:47,037
that I fashioned out of a thermal
blanket and cell phone charger.

764
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,679
I don't remember ever
volunteering for that.

765
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:49,590
Holly!

766
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:54,343
You and I will follow Will's directions as he
searches for the tell-tale ping of the missing,

767
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:56,905
and still presumably
operational tachyon meter.

768
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,579
Oh god, he's close.

769
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:01,909
I've taken care of that.

770
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,093
During the course of my professional
career I've done extensive research with,

771
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:08,866
reptiles and various birds of
prey of which Dinosaurs are.

772
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:10,147
Well that's disputable.

773
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:10,937
Please be quiet.

774
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:13,419
They have a very acute sense of smell.

775
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:18,293
Now, while I gathered this strictly for
genetic research to be used upon our return,

776
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:21,146
I think it would prove
wise to use this now.

777
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:22,847
Hadrosaur urine.

778
00:40:23,117 --> 00:40:23,978
We're going to cover our-

779
00:40:23,978 --> 00:40:24,808
Whoa, wait.

780
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:25,759
What is that?

781
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,211
Hadrosaur urine.

782
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:29,513
How'd you get that?

783
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:32,476
Well while you are sleeping,
I'm out gathering research.

784
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:33,265
Okay?

785
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:35,758
This was to be used
for genetic engineering.

786
00:40:35,858 --> 00:40:38,330
And I was going to write a
report on kidney function.

787
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:41,593
But now it'll just be
camouflage, we'll all blend in.

788
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:42,974
Okay? So...

789
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,064
We will cover ourselves-

790
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:45,826
I'm sorry, so sorry.

791
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:47,077
I'm just trying to figure this out.

792
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:50,550
So you've been gathering urine?

793
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:52,652
Yes, what's the problem?

794
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:56,565
That means you stood under
a dino dung, with a bucket.

795
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:04,472
If you want to be technical and reduce
it to it's basis element...yes I was.

796
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:07,194
How'd that work out for you?

797
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,376
Are you honestly asking me?

798
00:41:09,736 --> 00:41:10,617
Yeah.

799
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,180
It's very peaceful.

800
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:15,362
Just a little bit like fly fishing.

801
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:22,357
Just out there in the night air still
calm, and then zing you get a big catch.

802
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:28,842
Okay so, we'll cover our bodies in urine, and
we'll be virtually undetectable to all Dinosaurs.

803
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:34,017
Here they come, should've
thought of this a long time ago.

804
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:40,542
That's refreshing.

805
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:43,045
Make sure to ingest some
get that in the blood stream.

806
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,131
Don't do that.

807
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:54,364
Okay, whose next?

808
00:41:57,077 --> 00:41:58,088
Really?

809
00:41:58,668 --> 00:41:59,688
It's not that bad.

810
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:05,614
Just starting to burn my eyes a
little bit did not plan for it.

811
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:09,017
It get's up in the nostrils
too, you do not want that.

812
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:14,091
That's early morning stuff.

813
00:42:15,682 --> 00:42:16,623
That is strong.

814
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:20,636
Maybe a second splash will
reduce some of the effects.

815
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:23,448
Immediately made it worse.

816
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,162
Where's my laser pointer? Nevermind.

817
00:42:27,782 --> 00:42:30,305
We will probably have to be doing...

818
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:37,090
Whose that?

819
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:43,105
Maybe we should just follow him.

820
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:44,996
Nice model though.

821
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,910
Yeah fine, let's forget my model
and let's follow the monkey.

822
00:42:55,715 --> 00:42:56,516
Shut up Chaka!

823
00:42:58,808 --> 00:42:59,929
Are we there yet?

824
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,811
You find this funny Chaka?

825
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:05,013
This is the damn Bhutan
death march out here.

826
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,600
My god...

827
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:16,022
Absolutely incredible.

828
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:18,825
This must be the main
entry point into this world.

829
00:43:21,938 --> 00:43:23,549
It's like...a cosmic lost and found.

830
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,331
Wow look at all this
kick ass shit to steal.

831
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:27,922
This is like the world's greatest mall.

832
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:29,634
Yeah, Will, it's just like a mall.

833
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:31,466
The only thing it's
missing is a food court.

834
00:43:31,686 --> 00:43:34,218
Compsognathus! Look how they move!

835
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:36,830
Where all these little
chupacabres going to?

836
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,401
I'll tell you where they're going to.

837
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:41,404
Our raft, tachyon meter can't be far.

838
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:43,316
Our raft? That's my raft.

839
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:46,178
Get away from there!
Stop pecking at my raft!

840
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:49,270
There's your food court.

841
00:43:52,053 --> 00:43:52,874
Ice cream...

842
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:54,205
Hey! What're you doing?

843
00:43:54,205 --> 00:43:56,686
What? I'm gonna poney up and
get Chaka a cone, it's his first.

844
00:43:56,776 --> 00:43:59,799
No there's a reason those
Dinosaurs hang out there, they know.

845
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,331
They know what?

846
00:44:01,331 --> 00:44:02,672
It's feeding time.

847
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:42,695
Tyrannosaurus female!

848
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:46,349
We're in luck.

849
00:44:46,729 --> 00:44:51,392
These large predators are extremely territorial,
virtually nothing will distract them from each other.

850
00:44:56,507 --> 00:44:57,738
Oh crap balls.

851
00:44:58,089 --> 00:44:58,930
Whaddya know?

852
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,971
This is one of those situations where
dumping piss on your head's a bad idea.

853
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:03,022
Run!

854
00:45:06,325 --> 00:45:07,346
Wait Chaka!

855
00:45:08,037 --> 00:45:09,568
Lead your master to safety!

856
00:45:14,402 --> 00:45:15,193
Chaka no!

857
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:16,454
Why?!

858
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,085
You're a little asshole Chaka!

859
00:45:20,998 --> 00:45:23,229
Spread out! It'll confuse them!

860
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,211
Try running in serpentine patterns!

861
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:27,884
He's incapable of
rapid forward direction!

862
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:30,006
Serpentine everyone!

863
00:45:30,586 --> 00:45:31,427
Serpentine!

864
00:45:32,037 --> 00:45:32,817
Serpentine!

865
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,429
Serpentine!!

866
00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:36,320
No! Serpentine!

867
00:45:36,621 --> 00:45:37,892
Serpentine!!

868
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:42,076
Son of a kid!

869
00:45:42,266 --> 00:45:45,278
Hey Marshall, you ever
get tired of being wrong?

870
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:49,101
I do, I really do! I'm so tired!

871
00:45:50,823 --> 00:45:52,404
Get on your horse Rick Marshall!

872
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,731
Fascinating but terrifying!

873
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:24,501
No!

874
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:25,923
Marshall!

875
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:27,253
Still here!

876
00:46:27,844 --> 00:46:29,215
I hope you're taping this!

877
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:30,136
I got it!

878
00:46:55,828 --> 00:46:57,219
I don't want to die in a hummer!

879
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:09,699
A massacre...

880
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:24,792
Gross!

881
00:47:32,868 --> 00:47:34,460
Set the catapult!

882
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:36,272
What?!

883
00:47:36,742 --> 00:47:38,333
Set the catapult!

884
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:39,845
What?!

885
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:42,236
Set the fuckin' catapult!

886
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:43,547
This thing?!

887
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:45,249
Catapult! Now!

888
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:48,322
No no, take her that way! Go that way!

889
00:47:48,622 --> 00:47:49,663
Just do it!

890
00:47:50,143 --> 00:47:50,914
Come on!

891
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:52,695
How the hell do you set a catapult!

892
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:53,886
I don't know, just turn it!

893
00:47:55,027 --> 00:47:55,818
One!

894
00:47:56,889 --> 00:47:57,750
Two!

895
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,391
Three!

896
00:48:03,954 --> 00:48:05,015
Crank that thing!

897
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:09,219
Oh no!

898
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,841
Crank that mother!

899
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,743
I'm coming in hot!

900
00:48:16,665 --> 00:48:17,746
Keep going!

901
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:19,538
Put your back into it!

902
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,601
The package has arrived.

903
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:23,542
What's the package?

904
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:25,382
It's a canister of refridgerant.

905
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:27,524
Now!

906
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,517
I did not expect that.

907
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,231
Gay showtunes!

908
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,553
Cassie...Beebe.

909
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:02,924
Tachyon meter!

910
00:49:19,638 --> 00:49:20,959
Oh that blows.

911
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:22,401
That...

912
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:24,423
BLOWS...

913
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:41,186
Marshall?

914
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:44,699
What're you doing?

915
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:47,372
I'm giving up.

916
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:49,823
It feels good.

917
00:49:50,104 --> 00:49:52,165
But what about finding our way home?

918
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:56,790
Validation for your life's work, you just
going give that all up just to lie here.

919
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,271
No no of course not.

920
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:01,143
Lying here is just
phase one of the plan.

921
00:50:01,513 --> 00:50:03,425
It's phase two that
gets me really excited.

922
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:10,041
It involves adjusting the angle of my recline,
and putting this hand halfway down my pants.

923
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:12,322
Deceptively simple yet elegant.

924
00:50:12,432 --> 00:50:14,214
Yeah, I tried.

925
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,385
I failed.

926
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:18,548
And you know what, once
again it's my own vault.

927
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:19,719
You mean fault.

928
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:21,430
No, I actually mean vault.

929
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,902
It's from a poster with
a pole vaulter on it.

930
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:25,624
That's really freaking stupid man.

931
00:50:25,624 --> 00:50:27,085
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

932
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:29,047
Any scientist in his
right mind wouldn't give-

933
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:31,159
Initiating phase two.

934
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,183
Do you know how I first heard about you?

935
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:37,714
As a joke.

936
00:50:38,275 --> 00:50:42,038
First year at Cambridge we used to email your
little appearance with Matt Lauer around for a laugh.

937
00:50:42,629 --> 00:50:46,021
I mean as you tube hall of fame moments
goes, it was Matt Lauer versus Marshall,

938
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:48,513
and then that monkey
pissin' in his own face.

939
00:50:48,653 --> 00:50:49,874
In that order.

940
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:51,486
But I wasn't laughing.

941
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:56,450
Because I fascinated. I saw a man
who was willing to swim dangerous waters
for the sake of his need to know.

942
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,444
I took that to heart Dr. Marshall,
I've committed myself to your theories
and I got tossed out of Cambridge for it.

943
00:51:02,305 --> 00:51:04,616
For my theories, you
threw your future away?

944
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:06,128
Yeah that's what everyone told me.

945
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:09,070
But I didn't believe it, not 'til now.

946
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:18,458
Have you seen this monkey video?

947
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,182
Yeah, I've seen it about a dozen times.

948
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:24,574
God bless the internet.

949
00:51:25,134 --> 00:51:26,024
Come on Chaka.

950
00:51:26,274 --> 00:51:27,556
Let's work on our mission statement.

951
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:43,890
How's it going?

952
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:46,912
What's wrong little guy, you okay?

953
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:49,764
Lady troubles?

954
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:52,987
Tell me about it.

955
00:51:53,818 --> 00:51:56,200
This obviously stays
between me and you but...

956
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,411
I'm coming up on a 6 year dry spell.

957
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,083
He says that he misses his
tribe, it's a beautiful existence

958
00:52:12,534 --> 00:52:15,977
They're carefree and nomadic,
and live where the food lives.

959
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,368
Just like me.

960
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:20,230
I moved "tres" times just to
be closer to a Ruby Tuesdays.

961
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:21,661
Continue.

962
00:52:24,063 --> 00:52:27,767
Their women wait on the men,
serve in all their needs.

963
00:52:28,077 --> 00:52:29,649
I'm liking this, continue.

964
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,604
They're ugly, but they make up
for it in nice personalities.

965
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:46,642
He says as prince of his tribe he personally
is served by a heron of 7,000 women.

966
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:48,985
Wow, not bad little dude.

967
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:53,568
And they bring him all
accruements of food, and-

968
00:52:54,949 --> 00:52:57,241
Yeah, you get the idea
I'm not translating that.

969
00:53:14,245 --> 00:53:16,277
Any room around that
fire for a jerk like me?

970
00:53:17,658 --> 00:53:18,759
Thought you gave up?

971
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,401
I did.

972
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:22,873
I gave up on giving up.

973
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,866
Sat out there for a long time.

974
00:53:27,847 --> 00:53:32,071
Just me, my shame and
this little 4 string.

975
00:53:33,952 --> 00:53:35,423
I've had a change of heart.

976
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:39,407
Tried too long and hard to think
something to say to you guys.

977
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:42,720
Well, I realized there
wasn't anything to say.

978
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:44,621
But maybe...

979
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:46,042
Just maybe...

980
00:53:47,013 --> 00:53:48,014
There's something I could sing.

981
00:53:48,014 --> 00:53:49,025
No really it's alright-

982
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,517
Marshall...Will and Holly...

983
00:53:52,138 --> 00:53:55,070
On a routine expedition.

984
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:00,424
Met the greatest earthquake ever known.

985
00:54:02,016 --> 00:54:02,887
That's all I got.

986
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:03,848
That's fine.

987
00:54:03,848 --> 00:54:05,099
Apology accepted.

988
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,250
Thanks, you guys are being so generous.

989
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,632
Really appreciate it, I
think the healing has begun.

990
00:54:09,822 --> 00:54:16,508
Met the greatest
earthquake ever known...

991
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:20,131
High on the rapids.

992
00:54:20,411 --> 00:54:23,444
It struck their tiny raft.

993
00:54:24,365 --> 00:54:25,396
That's good.

994
00:54:25,546 --> 00:54:27,577
And plunged them down-

995
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:30,830
I'm so tired.

996
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:34,874
A thousand feet below.

997
00:54:35,504 --> 00:54:36,535
I'm feeling weak.

998
00:54:37,256 --> 00:54:38,236
Really bushwacked.

999
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:42,149
Anyway here's how I end it, a
little arpeggio nothing fancy.

1000
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:46,614
Guys, I'm sleepy.

1001
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:48,815
The Land...

1002
00:54:50,126 --> 00:54:53,009
Land...of the Lost-

1003
00:54:57,473 --> 00:54:58,464
I'm so tired!

1004
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:09,713
What happened?

1005
00:55:11,073 --> 00:55:12,405
You had a bug on you.

1006
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:14,056
But it's gone now.

1007
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:16,068
Oh okay.

1008
00:55:39,178 --> 00:55:40,299
Alright everyone!

1009
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,540
Rise and shine.

1010
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:45,783
Listen up, it's a new day.

1011
00:55:46,654 --> 00:55:47,815
Yes we've had a set back.

1012
00:55:48,726 --> 00:55:51,999
Yes it is tempting to
stay on this world and die.

1013
00:55:52,898 --> 00:55:54,590
But thats not how a new Marshall rolls.

1014
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,901
You hear me?

1015
00:55:56,172 --> 00:55:57,563
Not by a damn sight.

1016
00:55:58,574 --> 00:56:00,836
This isn't hands down
the pants Marshall.

1017
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:02,087
Alright?

1018
00:56:02,217 --> 00:56:07,171
This is a Gordon on 2 pints of Ben & Jerry's and
a whole spiral cut ham while watching not one,

1019
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:09,063
but two Mama's Family reunion Marshall.

1020
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:10,254
Uh-Uh!

1021
00:56:10,404 --> 00:56:11,315
He's gone.

1022
00:56:12,105 --> 00:56:12,966
Here's the deal.

1023
00:56:13,547 --> 00:56:14,737
Enik's counting on us.

1024
00:56:15,257 --> 00:56:16,509
The whole world is counting on us.

1025
00:56:17,189 --> 00:56:20,853
If we have any hope of returning home we need to
take back that tachyon meter, and take it back hard.

1026
00:56:21,413 --> 00:56:22,424
That means climbing.

1027
00:56:23,115 --> 00:56:25,516
Hours of arduous
climbing up sheer cliffs.

1028
00:56:26,097 --> 00:56:26,847
Not tomorrow.

1029
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:28,098
Not in a few hours.

1030
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:29,239
But right now!

1031
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,401
Understood?

1032
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:31,171
Yeah.

1033
00:56:31,171 --> 00:56:32,172
Understood Will?

1034
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:33,013
Hmm?

1035
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,925
Let's move out you panzies.

1036
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:38,607
Hey! This is not a race.

1037
00:56:38,948 --> 00:56:39,888
Okay?

1038
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:09,813
What the hell?

1039
00:57:10,734 --> 00:57:13,667
Teradachtyl eggs incubating
all over her lair.

1040
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:16,129
There's your shitty boombox.

1041
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,142
Across a sea of thin volcanic glass.

1042
00:57:21,293 --> 00:57:25,607
Okay Will, what you're gonna want to
do is evenly distribute your weight,

1043
00:57:25,687 --> 00:57:28,390
at the same time keep
an eye out for the eggs.

1044
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:30,821
Hey, Will?

1045
00:57:31,502 --> 00:57:32,382
I know you're faking.

1046
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:34,524
Okay, Chaka!

1047
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:36,757
Chaka!

1048
00:57:37,848 --> 00:57:38,608
Come on.

1049
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:40,429
Fine.

1050
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:44,573
Maybe I'll need to listen to the words of a group
of young kids words trying to make it on stage.

1051
00:57:44,713 --> 00:57:45,934
God I hope I get it.

1052
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:48,056
I hope I get it.

1053
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:49,277
Marshall?

1054
00:57:51,698 --> 00:57:52,399
Be careful.

1055
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:55,232
I'm up!

1056
00:57:55,232 --> 00:57:56,313
I'm up I got this.

1057
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:58,124
Oh Marshall, you got it.

1058
00:58:00,937 --> 00:58:01,857
Do me a favor?

1059
00:58:02,758 --> 00:58:04,179
Just keep an eye on the mother okay?

1060
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:06,321
You mustn't change the surface
temperature of the eggs,

1061
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:08,353
any drop of sweat could
activate hatching process.

1062
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:37,758
I got it.

1063
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:39,189
I got it!

1064
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,255
They're hatching!

1065
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:11,346
Why are they hatching?!

1066
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:12,367
The music!

1067
00:59:12,597 --> 00:59:13,908
It must be like a lullaby.

1068
00:59:20,654 --> 00:59:21,835
God I hope I get it!

1069
00:59:22,345 --> 00:59:23,346
I hope I get it!

1070
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:26,349
How many people does he need?

1071
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,401
God I hope I get it!

1072
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:30,962
I hope I get it!

1073
00:59:31,473 --> 00:59:33,955
How many boys, how many girls?

1074
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:36,437
Look at all the people!

1075
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,098
At all the people!

1076
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,170
How many people does he need?

1077
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,921
How many boys, how many girls?

1078
00:59:41,921 --> 00:59:43,153
How many people does he-

1079
00:59:43,153 --> 00:59:45,905
I really need this job.

1080
00:59:46,035 --> 00:59:48,647
Please God I need this job.

1081
00:59:48,887 --> 00:59:53,321
I've got to get this job!

1082
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,473
I'm gonna miss this place
that proves I was right.

1083
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:45,385
Oh drink?

1084
01:00:45,385 --> 01:00:46,446
Drink, yes!

1085
01:00:49,398 --> 01:00:51,440
That is delicious and refreshing.

1086
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,332
Sweet and sour like Chinese food.

1087
01:00:56,764 --> 01:00:59,157
He's saying it's a celebratory
drink in his village.

1088
01:00:59,517 --> 01:01:00,298
Cheers!

1089
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:06,222
It brings a joyful lightness
to the heart and soul.

1090
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,416
No, I'm sorry its not joyful lightness.

1091
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,848
A better translation would
be, howling loneliness.

1092
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:19,644
And then your bravery will
be tested and your mind folds.

1093
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:26,880
And the shadow hats will rise from their
graves and hold you in an icy embrace.

1094
01:01:29,562 --> 01:01:32,335
And it'll feel like...your
bowels being pierced.

1095
01:01:33,686 --> 01:01:34,927
By a ghost serpent.

1096
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:37,909
Well that can't be right.

1097
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:39,580
No, that can't be right.

1098
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:43,774
Chaka, maki rishu...dong doh?

1099
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:47,647
Oh okay, so it's not ghost serpent.

1100
01:01:47,887 --> 01:01:49,449
It's much much closer to zombie dick.

1101
01:01:53,392 --> 01:01:54,844
I think it might be a narcotic.

1102
01:01:56,035 --> 01:01:57,015
Is that so?

1103
01:02:00,058 --> 01:02:01,419
Need you to be honest with me okay?

1104
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:03,601
Are you a cop?

1105
01:02:07,493 --> 01:02:08,835
That's not an answer Chaka.

1106
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:10,356
That's your name.

1107
01:02:12,048 --> 01:02:14,960
Seriously, by law you have to
tell me if you're an officer.

1108
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:16,582
Marco -Polo

1109
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:17,903
You wearing a wire?

1110
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,271
Marco -Polo

1111
01:02:32,525 --> 01:02:33,356
Hello!

1112
01:02:41,212 --> 01:02:42,553
Hot coffee.

1113
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:25,960
I need food.

1114
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,251
Marshall!

1115
01:03:27,251 --> 01:03:27,882
Yeah?

1116
01:03:27,882 --> 01:03:29,183
Fruit me buddy!

1117
01:04:08,686 --> 01:04:09,707
Chaka?

1118
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,530
I owe you an apology.

1119
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:15,202
Okay, I...

1120
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:18,134
I'm a guest in your land.

1121
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:21,617
A guest who came unannounced, uninvited.

1122
01:04:23,288 --> 01:04:24,970
I've treated you like a toilet.

1123
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:26,781
A toilet!

1124
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:29,383
I want to make it up to you.

1125
01:04:30,744 --> 01:04:35,028
Because the love I feel for
you, I'm not exaggerating...

1126
01:04:36,229 --> 01:04:44,076
Is a billion times greater than the love
for mankind that Jesus felt on the cross.

1127
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:47,589
You can take that to the bank.

1128
01:04:50,651 --> 01:04:52,443
I'm so glad you guys squashed that.

1129
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:54,565
I love you guys so much.

1130
01:04:55,505 --> 01:04:56,586
You guys are amazing.

1131
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,328
I don't ever want to go home.

1132
01:04:59,328 --> 01:04:59,698
No.

1133
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:01,790
This is just like Sandal's resort.

1134
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:04,543
Just good people, a lot of good food.

1135
01:05:05,173 --> 01:05:05,974
Good times.

1136
01:05:07,015 --> 01:05:08,236
I want to make this my life.

1137
01:05:08,917 --> 01:05:11,018
I'm just gonna make
- ...be here all the time.

1138
01:05:17,044 --> 01:05:18,405
Hey hey!

1139
01:05:18,575 --> 01:05:19,566
You're funny Chaka!

1140
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:20,436
He's hilarious!

1141
01:05:20,436 --> 01:05:21,236
You're funny.

1142
01:05:21,236 --> 01:05:22,638
His jokes are disgusting.

1143
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,471
You're funny.

1144
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:27,552
Hey for real though?

1145
01:05:28,173 --> 01:05:32,266
How much money would I have to pay
ya'll to french kiss each other?

1146
01:05:33,537 --> 01:05:34,378
For real?

1147
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:35,759
Totally real!

1148
01:05:35,759 --> 01:05:37,140
For real, for real?

1149
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,232
Totally, in his mucky mouth.

1150
01:05:40,183 --> 01:05:43,936
Hey if it doesn't leave the three
of us, I'll do for free right now.

1151
01:05:44,036 --> 01:05:45,277
It's not gonna leave here.

1152
01:05:45,998 --> 01:05:47,009
I'd do it right now.

1153
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:48,130
Let me see it.

1154
01:05:49,561 --> 01:05:50,151
Kiss him.

1155
01:05:50,422 --> 01:05:51,892
It doesn't leave the three of us?

1156
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:53,554
No dude, I won't tell anybody.

1157
01:05:53,554 --> 01:05:54,595
Who am I gonna tell?

1158
01:05:55,766 --> 01:05:56,657
Why don't you kiss him?

1159
01:05:56,657 --> 01:05:57,367
I'm gonna do it!

1160
01:05:57,497 --> 01:05:58,288
Come here!

1161
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,043
You guys are gross!

1162
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:10,058
I don't wanna do it!

1163
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:12,060
I don't want to do it!

1164
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:14,381
I've changed my mind!

1165
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:25,541
Dinosaur eggs!

1166
01:06:27,102 --> 01:06:28,683
Dinosaur poo...

1167
01:06:41,094 --> 01:06:42,605
This is the Zarn!

1168
01:06:42,846 --> 01:06:45,228
Heed my warning or be destroyed!

1169
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:47,129
We're just trying to get home!

1170
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:49,651
Enik the Altrusian has
escaped our custody!

1171
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:52,774
He's over taken the central
pylon and the crystals.

1172
01:06:52,914 --> 01:06:57,758
And now plans to lead his army of Sleestak
on a rampage, across time and space!

1173
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:02,442
If you're hearing this, heed
my warning. Do not believe-

1174
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,795
No! Enik! No!

1175
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:28,824
The Zarn?

1176
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:31,917
I've gotta go and warn the-

1177
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:52,654
Holly?

1178
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,169
Holly...?

1179
01:08:06,266 --> 01:08:07,227
They've taken Holly.

1180
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:09,329
Chaka!

1181
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:10,630
I've got a mission for you.

1182
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:12,030
Now listen closely.

1183
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:26,162
I don't know what that means.

1184
01:08:26,332 --> 01:08:27,413
Just come on!

1185
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,010
Oh man.

1186
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:39,404
Sentries, classic hive behavior.

1187
01:08:40,274 --> 01:08:41,405
Obviously on patrol.

1188
01:08:42,086 --> 01:08:44,728
Just like drones tirelessly hunting.

1189
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:46,930
Dude, it looks like they're
gettin' ready to make out?

1190
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,681
No. No.

1191
01:08:58,189 --> 01:08:59,390
He's about to tap that ass!

1192
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:00,862
Would you shut up?

1193
01:09:00,862 --> 01:09:02,253
He's not about to tap that ass.

1194
01:09:04,544 --> 01:09:05,635
Oh you're right.

1195
01:09:06,146 --> 01:09:07,457
He's totally tapping that ass.

1196
01:09:08,137 --> 01:09:11,130
Yeah wow...Our own little private show.

1197
01:09:18,967 --> 01:09:20,488
Oh god, they shed.

1198
01:09:40,074 --> 01:09:40,855
Hi.

1199
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:42,046
Hey don't do that.

1200
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:43,678
Just focus.

1201
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:52,745
We find you guilty, for providing
assistance to Enik the Altrusian.

1202
01:09:53,306 --> 01:09:54,307
There she is!

1203
01:09:54,527 --> 01:09:57,490
Prepare the meet the Sleestak god!

1204
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,119
Stop!

1205
01:09:58,339 --> 01:09:59,080
Marshall!

1206
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,491
Do not interfere!

1207
01:10:00,491 --> 01:10:01,863
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

1208
01:10:01,863 --> 01:10:05,656
This one was caught trying to
deliver a tachyon device to Enik!

1209
01:10:05,906 --> 01:10:07,828
You want Holly? You've
gotta deal with us!

1210
01:10:09,349 --> 01:10:10,870
No, Marshall don't.

1211
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,602
Because we're all friends of Enik!

1212
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:17,957
Enik the Altrusian is guilty of the
destruction of an entire civilization.

1213
01:10:18,227 --> 01:10:18,938
Entire what now?

1214
01:10:19,028 --> 01:10:24,021
Convicted of his crimes, he was
sentenced to 10,000 years imprisonment.

1215
01:10:24,232 --> 01:10:24,712
What?

1216
01:10:24,982 --> 01:10:29,246
And made to wear a tunic
as a symbol of his deceit.

1217
01:10:29,557 --> 01:10:31,017
Told you dude, tunic.

1218
01:10:31,177 --> 01:10:34,590
As his allies, you shall die as well.

1219
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:35,691
Sieze them!

1220
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:39,425
Marshall!

1221
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:43,798
Hold on!

1222
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:21,540
Wait!

1223
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,392
Wait a minute, our working relationship.

1224
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:30,698
I wanted to do that
since I first met you.

1225
01:11:31,098 --> 01:11:32,770
You mean we could've been
doing this the whole time?

1226
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:35,441
Yeah, but I was worried it wouldn't be
professional and distract you from your work.

1227
01:11:35,661 --> 01:11:37,003
No, no...not distracting.

1228
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:38,484
Never distracting.

1229
01:11:40,256 --> 01:11:42,428
Are you guys kidding
me? Come on! Really!

1230
01:11:42,558 --> 01:11:44,269
Now is the time for this?

1231
01:11:44,849 --> 01:11:45,590
You know he's-

1232
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,621
He's right, we've got to stop Enik!

1233
01:11:48,062 --> 01:11:49,293
Right now  he has the upper hand.

1234
01:11:50,224 --> 01:11:51,025
I know we...

1235
01:11:51,025 --> 01:11:52,806
have the element of surprise but...

1236
01:11:56,599 --> 01:11:57,630
Yeah about that...

1237
01:11:59,522 --> 01:12:00,172
What?

1238
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:03,335
We sent Chaka to go get him.

1239
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:09,790
Well then.

1240
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,812
Rick Marshall.

1241
01:12:12,232 --> 01:12:15,275
Coming here represents a slight
adjustment to my plans but no matter.

1242
01:12:15,946 --> 01:12:17,506
I have what I need.

1243
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:21,130
And it's all thanks
to you, Dr. Marshall.

1244
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,641
And this!

1245
01:12:24,002 --> 01:12:25,674
Don't! We're out gunned.

1246
01:12:25,814 --> 01:12:27,945
My Sleestack stand prepared.

1247
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:31,979
With the power of the
crystals they are my slaves.

1248
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:33,570
My conquering army.

1249
01:12:34,301 --> 01:12:35,522
Thanks to your device.

1250
01:12:36,113 --> 01:12:41,036
I can lead an invasion force anywhere
I choose, in all of time and space.

1251
01:12:41,677 --> 01:12:44,269
But I believe I'll
begin with your Earth.

1252
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,362
My Sleestak's reproduce rather quickly.

1253
01:12:47,472 --> 01:12:49,353
Yeah we already caught
some of that action.

1254
01:12:49,613 --> 01:12:54,268
In merely weeks, your world will
be overrun by their scaly offspring.

1255
01:12:55,179 --> 01:12:59,072
And left standing in the
cinders of your civilization.

1256
01:12:59,382 --> 01:13:02,715
I'll be sure to give you
full scientific credit.

1257
01:13:04,006 --> 01:13:06,338
I know how important that is to you.

1258
01:13:07,339 --> 01:13:08,760
Now save your strength.

1259
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:10,551
You'll need it.

1260
01:13:13,674 --> 01:13:14,805
You'll need it?

1261
01:13:15,506 --> 01:13:16,186
What is it?

1262
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,321
Marshall?

1263
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,965
Oh great.

1264
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:37,564
Right, you run and I'll
distract him he's not after me.

1265
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:39,986
No, I'm not running.

1266
01:13:41,097 --> 01:13:41,998
This ends here.

1267
01:13:43,088 --> 01:13:44,329
Marshall, what are you doing?

1268
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,852
Maybe what I was always meant to do.

1269
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:51,736
Now just go, I'll meet
you at the pylon, I hope.

1270
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:53,227
No we're not leaving without you.

1271
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:54,358
Go!

1272
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,201
Get out of here, I don't love you!

1273
01:14:00,444 --> 01:14:01,024
Go!

1274
01:14:01,094 --> 01:14:02,315
Marshall!

1275
01:14:02,836 --> 01:14:03,737
Get!

1276
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:04,827
You're ugly!

1277
01:14:13,655 --> 01:14:16,366
Look, if you're gonna do
this for real take this.

1278
01:14:16,557 --> 01:14:18,969
Got some high powered fireworks
in here that might come in handy.

1279
01:14:18,969 --> 01:14:19,950
Are you kidding me?

1280
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,964
You mean you've been carrying a bag of
fireworks around with you this whole time?

1281
01:14:24,624 --> 01:14:27,256
There's literally a dozen situations
where we could've used these.

1282
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,850
He's right, none of that
is important now okay?

1283
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:33,091
Listen...

1284
01:14:33,862 --> 01:14:35,883
I gotta be straight with
you bro, I misjudged you.

1285
01:14:35,883 --> 01:14:37,384
I thought you were just a...

1286
01:14:37,744 --> 01:14:39,996
...dumbass dude who dressed
stupid, but I'm wrong.

1287
01:14:40,297 --> 01:14:41,178
You're solid.

1288
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:46,962
Thick or thin, I will follow you
into battle at anytime, you hear me?

1289
01:14:47,563 --> 01:14:49,614
Absolutely anytime.

1290
01:14:49,935 --> 01:14:52,057
Okay! How about now?

1291
01:14:52,397 --> 01:14:53,438
Like, right now?

1292
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:53,748
Yeah.

1293
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:56,901
Honestly?

1294
01:14:57,142 --> 01:14:59,493
I didn't really expect you to
call the favor in this soon.

1295
01:14:59,493 --> 01:15:02,886
So, on this one unfortunately
I'm gonna have to say no.

1296
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:07,620
But I think it's gonna be awesome for you
for personal growth just to hit this one solo.

1297
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,321
I'm gonna be rootin' for ya.

1298
01:15:09,691 --> 01:15:10,532
Okay?

1299
01:15:10,782 --> 01:15:11,783
Trenches bro.

1300
01:15:12,544 --> 01:15:13,645
It's all about love.

1301
01:15:14,766 --> 01:15:15,337
Okay?

1302
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:17,098
After this time.

1303
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:19,189
I'm there for you, okay?

1304
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,811
Anytime after now.

1305
01:15:22,612 --> 01:15:24,004
He's your man, not me.

1306
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,052
Alright, it's a fact.

1307
01:15:58,683 --> 01:16:00,154
You and I don't like each other.

1308
01:16:02,936 --> 01:16:04,718
Only one will remain.

1309
01:16:05,779 --> 01:16:08,091
Just gonna have to fight
you at your own game.

1310
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:24,214
Damn you're quick, it's
because you're a dinosaur!

1311
01:16:24,554 --> 01:16:27,377
But, you don't carry
around these, do you?

1312
01:16:29,949 --> 01:16:32,321
Welcome to the big
bang theory my friend!

1313
01:16:50,637 --> 01:16:51,537
Stupid...

1314
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:59,093
You're cornered man, there's no way out!

1315
01:16:59,434 --> 01:17:00,585
There's always a way out!

1316
01:17:03,127 --> 01:17:04,519
Because if you don't make it...

1317
01:17:06,269 --> 01:17:08,782
It's your own damn vault.

1318
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:37,496
My god! He's going to do it!

1319
01:17:37,496 --> 01:17:38,927
Do it! Do it!

1320
01:17:46,924 --> 01:17:47,695
God!

1321
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,677
Can't believe it.

1322
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:57,043
Hey!

1323
01:17:57,613 --> 01:17:58,944
Yeah, you!

1324
01:17:59,094 --> 01:18:00,245
You bastard!

1325
01:18:02,026 --> 01:18:03,948
Do you realize who you just ate, do you?

1326
01:18:04,499 --> 01:18:06,550
Probably the most brilliant man ever.

1327
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:08,592
Probably the only man
who ever really knew you.

1328
01:18:09,243 --> 01:18:12,895
Alright, so he was wrong about the size of your
brain but you don't go and eat a man for that,

1329
01:18:12,895 --> 01:18:14,847
you reason with him you stupid idiot!

1330
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,290
He was your future!

1331
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,391
He was my future!

1332
01:18:21,042 --> 01:18:23,644
And I'm never going to get a chance
to tell him that because of you!

1333
01:18:32,912 --> 01:18:34,624
It's cool, it's cool!

1334
01:18:39,959 --> 01:18:40,850
Right!

1335
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,181
Now we must get home,
we're gonna get back,

1336
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:45,943
and we're gonna tell the world
what Rick Marshall did here today.

1337
01:19:06,651 --> 01:19:08,652
Come on you big green bastards!

1338
01:19:10,684 --> 01:19:17,600
I am sick and tired of you
slow moving little wankers!

1339
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:25,666
Will!

1340
01:19:26,377 --> 01:19:29,810
Alright little dude, let's do this.

1341
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:31,692
Lock and load!

1342
01:19:39,258 --> 01:19:40,149
Want some of this?

1343
01:19:40,529 --> 01:19:42,011
Eat Chaka! Eat!

1344
01:19:44,223 --> 01:19:44,883
Will!

1345
01:19:47,435 --> 01:19:50,698
Step, step and lift!

1346
01:19:55,562 --> 01:19:58,044
Alright my murderous
friend take us home.

1347
01:20:03,309 --> 01:20:04,910
Bite that guy right there!

1348
01:20:07,812 --> 01:20:08,633
That's him...

1349
01:20:08,873 --> 01:20:09,894
That's him!

1350
01:20:14,058 --> 01:20:15,639
Oh god that's the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

1351
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:22,555
Would it be cool if he slides down Grumpy's
tail just like Fred Flinstone would do-

1352
01:20:26,478 --> 01:20:28,070
Oh god, I've lived.

1353
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:29,550
I have lived.

1354
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:33,504
Come on it tickles.

1355
01:20:33,684 --> 01:20:34,605
Marshall!

1356
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:39,959
What happened?

1357
01:20:39,959 --> 01:20:41,080
We thought you had died.

1358
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,521
Died?

1359
01:20:43,742 --> 01:20:45,284
That was just a minor set back.

1360
01:20:47,136 --> 01:20:48,076
Okay let's go home.

1361
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,820
No, this is insane we saw you
go down Grumpy's cake hole.

1362
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,121
What did he puke you out or something?

1363
01:20:54,551 --> 01:20:56,874
No, its not possible
the...the T-Rex's lacking-

1364
01:20:56,874 --> 01:20:58,025
Not important right now.

1365
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:02,348
I'm okay, and that's it.

1366
01:21:02,728 --> 01:21:03,939
This is messed up.

1367
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:05,691
Look I'd really rather
not talk about it.

1368
01:21:08,323 --> 01:21:09,034
Now...

1369
01:21:09,504 --> 01:21:10,595
Let's light this candle.

1370
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,746
No, Marshall...how did you get out?

1371
01:21:13,057 --> 01:21:14,708
I will talk to you about it later!

1372
01:21:15,369 --> 01:21:17,871
Individually to each one
of you, I'll explain it.

1373
01:21:20,474 --> 01:21:21,765
Oh geez...

1374
01:21:22,025 --> 01:21:23,185
Would you grow up?

1375
01:21:23,315 --> 01:21:25,237
Oh my God!

1376
01:21:25,237 --> 01:21:26,328
Yes, he pooped me out!

1377
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:28,971
Now you guys are friends?

1378
01:21:29,661 --> 01:21:35,225
Well, I was making my way through his bowels
I must've dislodged some intestinal blockage,

1379
01:21:35,496 --> 01:21:37,167
and yes he's in a much better mood now.

1380
01:21:37,868 --> 01:21:39,950
So, can we move on?

1381
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,331
I really would like to go home.

1382
01:21:42,282 --> 01:21:46,345
You were dueced out by a
Dinosaur, that is incredibly cool.

1383
01:21:48,867 --> 01:21:51,219
Grumpy listen...

1384
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,322
When you talk about
this, and you will...

1385
01:21:56,764 --> 01:22:00,267
Please be gentle...okay?

1386
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:03,710
That makes us best buds now.

1387
01:22:08,714 --> 01:22:10,555
Don't worry about it, it's
hard with your visidual arm.

1388
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:13,558
Let's go guys.

1389
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:14,879
To freedom!

1390
01:22:25,829 --> 01:22:27,389
Thank you Dr. Marshall.

1391
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:31,653
And now the doorway opens.

1392
01:22:34,135 --> 01:22:34,996
Enik!

1393
01:22:35,837 --> 01:22:36,588
It's over.

1394
01:22:37,227 --> 01:22:38,348
You're not going anywhere.

1395
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:42,162
You think you can challenge me?!

1396
01:22:48,947 --> 01:22:50,158
I wrestled at Purdue!

1397
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:52,491
JV!

1398
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:55,804
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1399
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:58,725
Chaka!

1400
01:22:59,106 --> 01:23:00,667
Get ready for the ball breaker!

1401
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,442
Marshall, I'm coming in!

1402
01:23:07,414 --> 01:23:09,294
Oh! Misfire!

1403
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:27,831
What have you done?!

1404
01:23:28,411 --> 01:23:29,472
The door!

1405
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:31,433
It's closing forever!

1406
01:23:45,095 --> 01:23:46,416
It's barely holding!

1407
01:23:46,496 --> 01:23:47,177
Let's go!

1408
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:51,561
Ha!

1409
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:55,744
It's your home, or your
comrade Dr. Marshall!

1410
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:57,746
No it isn't!

1411
01:23:58,036 --> 01:23:58,827
Reverse!

1412
01:23:59,918 --> 01:24:00,818
You go!

1413
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:04,281
I've got this yellow bastard
on lockdown, I'm gonna stay!

1414
01:24:04,591 --> 01:24:05,212
What?!

1415
01:24:05,602 --> 01:24:06,182
Yeah!

1416
01:24:06,483 --> 01:24:07,964
I've been talking to my man Chaka!

1417
01:24:07,964 --> 01:24:09,395
He pitches a pretty good world!

1418
01:24:10,176 --> 01:24:11,207
I mean think about it.

1419
01:24:11,567 --> 01:24:13,179
My home was never in the real world?

1420
01:24:13,179 --> 01:24:14,249
Never belonged.

1421
01:24:14,499 --> 01:24:15,861
This could be a fresh start for me.

1422
01:24:16,221 --> 01:24:18,373
Make some new friends?
I could be somebody!

1423
01:24:18,733 --> 01:24:19,434
A winner...

1424
01:24:21,486 --> 01:24:23,137
Wow, I really admire you right now.

1425
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:27,180
I just feel like so many people go through this
life looking for what I've found here, you know?

1426
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,052
And they themselves, can never find it.

1427
01:24:30,033 --> 01:24:30,743
Or worse.

1428
01:24:31,224 --> 01:24:33,626
They find it, and let it slip away.

1429
01:24:35,177 --> 01:24:36,938
I am so afraid of that happening.

1430
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,840
You wouldn't be human if
you didn't feel scared.

1431
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,171
Marshall!

1432
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:43,384
Please, you can't leave
me here like this with him.

1433
01:24:44,115 --> 01:24:46,967
As one scientist to
another, I beg you for mercy!

1434
01:24:49,179 --> 01:24:50,570
Science shows no mercy.

1435
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:52,191
And neither do I.

1436
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:53,713
That's good.

1437
01:24:55,244 --> 01:24:56,105
Let's go Holly.

1438
01:25:00,078 --> 01:25:00,819
Ready?

1439
01:25:01,549 --> 01:25:02,130
Ready...

1440
01:25:03,341 --> 01:25:05,683
Chaka! Technically
I'm still your master!

1441
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:19,154
Marshall?

1442
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:20,275
Holly?

1443
01:25:25,209 --> 01:25:26,561
We made it!

1444
01:25:35,908 --> 01:25:37,089
I just want to say...

1445
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:41,062
You have grown into a beautiful woman.

1446
01:25:55,014 --> 01:25:55,925
Hey!

1447
01:25:57,957 --> 01:25:59,068
Where's Will?

1448
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:03,031
He went to a better place.

1449
01:26:04,832 --> 01:26:05,683
You killed him?

1450
01:26:06,624 --> 01:26:07,415
No...

1451
01:26:08,856 --> 01:26:11,758
No he went to a strange world.

1452
01:26:13,089 --> 01:26:17,493
A world of Dinosaurs,
monkey people, lizard people.

1453
01:26:18,654 --> 01:26:21,097
A whole in space and time, a virtual...

1454
01:26:21,737 --> 01:26:22,897
Land of the lost.

1455
01:26:24,619 --> 01:26:28,182
As hard as it is to
believe, Will chose to stay.

1456
01:26:29,623 --> 01:26:31,185
Alright, cool.

1457
01:26:33,456 --> 01:26:36,199
Did you see the Sleestaks
beat the crap out of Enik?

1458
01:26:36,889 --> 01:26:38,481
I've never seen them move so fast.

1459
01:26:40,142 --> 01:26:41,824
Couldn't agree more little buddy.

1460
01:26:42,154 --> 01:26:43,204
Tunic...

1461
01:26:45,586 --> 01:26:46,667
I got you come on.

1462
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:51,972
You are deceptively heavy.

1463
01:27:10,307 --> 01:27:12,219
I'm a pina kusa!

1464
01:27:17,463 --> 01:27:18,364
Chaka!

1465
01:27:18,844 --> 01:27:21,026
God, we're kings!

1466
01:27:26,921 --> 01:27:28,192
That's what your women look like?

1467
01:27:28,422 --> 01:27:29,724
Hop off, be cool.

1468
01:27:32,566 --> 01:27:34,969
Whoa easy, stand down!

1469
01:27:35,609 --> 01:27:36,729
I got this.

1470
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:41,233
How's it going? I'm Will,
pretty much Chaka's best friend.

1471
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:45,207
I'm here to offer you all
protection and shelter.

1472
01:27:45,507 --> 01:27:49,820
And really pretty much anything
that you guys would ever need.

1473
01:27:51,052 --> 01:27:52,002
Hey, how's it going?

1474
01:27:53,013 --> 01:27:54,285
Yeah that's denim.

1475
01:27:54,715 --> 01:27:55,336
Denim.

1476
01:27:56,196 --> 01:27:57,718
Yeah...yeah.

1477
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:01,731
This was definitely a good choice.

1478
01:28:04,733 --> 01:28:07,576
This is TODAY with Matt Lauer.

1479
01:28:08,247 --> 01:28:12,810
It's been sometime since my final
guest was here but after the,

1480
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:17,014
remarkable events of the passed
year, he needs no introduction.

1481
01:28:17,314 --> 01:28:22,748
He's back with a new book, and more startling
evidence of you guessed it, Time Warps.

1482
01:28:22,748 --> 01:28:23,629
The pipe's allowed.

1483
01:28:23,629 --> 01:28:24,410
I asked.

1484
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,061
That's great news.

1485
01:28:26,742 --> 01:28:28,944
You've had, quite a year.

1486
01:28:28,944 --> 01:28:30,725
Actually stellar year, Matt.

1487
01:28:31,045 --> 01:28:32,726
In fact I brought you
back a Dinosaur egg.

1488
01:28:32,977 --> 01:28:38,612
Which my beautiful partner, and lover Holly
Cantrell was gracious enough to transport.

1489
01:28:38,612 --> 01:28:40,933
And I'm obviously very
excited about my new tome...

1490
01:28:40,933 --> 01:28:41,714
It's a book.

1491
01:28:41,714 --> 01:28:43,826
Sixteen weeks on the NY
Time's best seller list.

1492
01:28:43,826 --> 01:28:45,648
Let me get to your discovery
doctor because this is-

1493
01:28:45,648 --> 01:28:46,108
This is for you.

1494
01:28:46,108 --> 01:28:47,069
I signed it.

1495
01:28:51,073 --> 01:28:52,683
You're supposed to say the
title and the publisher.

1496
01:28:52,683 --> 01:28:53,744
That's not gonna happen.

1497
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:54,885
Just say it.

1498
01:28:54,885 --> 01:28:55,456
No!

1499
01:28:55,456 --> 01:28:56,647
Just say the damn title.

1500
01:28:57,137 --> 01:28:57,878
Fine.

1501
01:28:58,619 --> 01:29:01,722
Matt Lauer can suck it,
by Dr. Rick Marshall.

1502
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:04,523
I was so surprised that your
attorney signed off on that,

1503
01:29:04,523 --> 01:29:06,265
I was like, are you sure?
Is this gonna be okay?

1504
01:29:06,265 --> 01:29:07,206
He said yeah, go for it.

1505
01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:08,517
Son of a bitch!

1506
01:29:11,811 --> 01:29:21,820
THE END
