{51942}{51990}When Teresa and I arrived,
{51994}{52091}we caught the corpus delicti|singing in our bed.
{52110}{52150}Who's his boss?
{52155}{52231}A patient of mine.|Mrs. Gold. Just imagine!
{52236}{52332}- And the other woman?|- Some girl who writes slogans.
{52587}{52611}Hello?
{52758}{52833}Tomas, do you happen|to know a certain Sylvia?
{52920}{52969}Sylvia Silva, the nurse.
{52980}{53028}Don't play dumb with me,
{53033}{53070}you little shit!
{53075}{53117}You're fired!

{53975}{54031}Go pick a peck|of pickled peppers.
{54058}{54101}That's real royal flavor.
{54121}{54187}The best of both worlds.
{54197}{54250}The true conquest.
{54302}{54350}I'll give you chilies, you bastard!
{54460}{54564}As|Don Wolfango|said,|I've got|a toothache|in|my|heart.
{55084}{55109}Shit!
{55115}{55162}Takeshi's asking|if you've been to Osaka.
{55176}{55241}Why did you drag me here|with these damn Japs?
{55465}{55500}You wanted to see me,
{55506}{55575}and I've got to go sightseeing|with these doctors from the conference.
{55580}{55677}And they aren't fools.|Takeshi is a genius.
{55682}{55739}He invented|an electronic contraceptive device.
{55769}{55857}Audaces fortuna iuvat, man.|- Who taught you all that bullshit?
{55862}{55934}- The Jesuits. Why?|- Just wondering.
{55950}{56065}Mateo, I'm in bad shape.|It's not just losing my job.
{56070}{56141}Something's gotten to me.|- You need some dough?
{56146}{56184}Don't be a jerk.
{56190}{56228}It's Clarisa.
{56243}{56276}Tell me about her.
{56281}{56337}Neighbors can be trouble.
{56342}{56417}I know. But I'm in a daze.|I can't stop thinking about her.
{56438}{56478}I think I'm in love.
{56483}{56561}You, in love?|Tell me another fairy tale.
{56604}{56639}All right.
{56658}{56723}She's a stewardess.|I don't know what airline.
{56728}{56838}She's engaged to a pilot and moved|in with him. I don't know his name.
{56843}{56896}They're getting married|next month.
{56901}{56933}Married?
{56938}{57015}Yes. If you want to know more,|ask Teresa.
{57020}{57115}You coming to the Ballet Folklórico?|- Spare me.
{57138}{57193}Come on. It's great.
{57198}{57249}Airplanes are kind of cool,|aren't they?
{57333}{57406}Claustrophobia? Yes,
{57439}{57511}I felt like opening the door|and jumping,
{57524}{57595}The man I loved|"was cheating on me,
{57600}{57662}I was depressed,|"working on a DC-10,
{57697}{57769}The ocean, the clouds,,,
{57790}{57861}the plane soaring|through the vast sky,
{57866}{57925}I swear I felt like jumping.
{57937}{57994}Luckily, the captain called me -|it was Carlos!
{58010}{58037}That's great.
{58042}{58117}If Mateo ever cheats on me,|I'll kill him!
{58122}{58166}I'll kill the bastard!
{58362}{58425}At last, Teresa -|I'm in love!
{58435}{58509}If at first you don't succeed,|try, try again.
{58514}{58576}No, Teresa,|this is true love.
{58581}{58629}Tell me about Clarisa.
{58642}{58722}She's an angel sent to show me|the error of my ways.
{58727}{58823}She has an inner beauty.|Have you seen her eyes?
{58871}{58917}They're like -
{58956}{59016}She would be a true conquest.
{59022}{59087}By the way,|can you lend me your thermom-
{59102}{59149}I think you two have met.
{59164}{59192}Clarisa Negrete...
{59197}{59228}Tomas Tomas.
{59277}{59345}- Pleased to meet you.|- The pleasure is mine.
{59365}{59423}Get me that thermometer,|would you?
{59598}{59637}You're a stewardess, right?
{59642}{59695}Flight attendant.
{59701}{59738}Ah, flight attendant.
{59829}{59852}Right.
{59863}{59888}Right.
{59991}{60026}Beautiful night, isn't it?
{60074}{60134}Yes, beautiful.
{60161}{60185}Cool.
{60208}{60238}Cool.
{60331}{60361}Here.
{60382}{60425}I believe this is yours too.
{60469}{60533}If you'll excuse me.|See you later.
{60538}{60571}Good night.
{60755}{60789}Shit!
{62534}{62558}Sweetheart!
{62770}{62805}Good morning.
{63140}{63213}- No one undresses the naked.|- Lend me your robe.
{63221}{63289}Ah, to be young and foolish.
{63294}{63345}She must think I'm sick.
{63374}{63423}You are sick, aren't you?
{63476}{63510}Shit!
{63646}{63689}Shit!
{64174}{64228}Tomas, did you read the paper?
{64233}{64328}Not yet. Listen, I'm sorry|about yesterday and this morning.
{64334}{64373}Someone took my robe.
{64378}{64434}To each his own.
{64445}{64498}Please don't think I'm crazy,
{64503}{64569}or that I like to cover up|with sensational headlines.
{64574}{64633}Adam used a fig leaf.
{64638}{64673}That's true.
{64738}{64772}Need help?
{64854}{64921}Are you in a hurry?|- Not quite the Concorde, but yes.
{64926}{64993}I just wanted to see if maybe -
{65003}{65050}You caught me|at a very bad time.
{65055}{65145}Wait until you've flown|without air conditioning.
{65152}{65197}Perhaps when -
{65214}{65281}Clarisa, I swear I'm not|usually like this.
{65286}{65336}I mean, I am, but -
{65342}{65428}Look, I'm flying Oaxaca-Merida-|Cancun-Mexico City today.
{65433}{65497}We'll talk when I get back, okay?|- Sure.
{65511}{65545}- Do I look all right?|- Great.
{65550}{65596}It's a captain's hat.|See you.
{65601}{65630}Here.
{65675}{65720}Have a good flight.
{66157}{66240}Excuse me, miss.|I've brought my fecal samples.
{66246}{66273}Just leave them.
{66278}{66326}They came out great.
{66330}{66386}That's what they all say.
{67406}{67485}- Hello?|- Tomas? Mateo,
{67490}{67560}Do me a favor,|Take Takeshi and Koyi sightseeing,
{67565}{67595}Right now?
{67600}{67653}I can't. I'm busy.
{67658}{67709}Come on, just this once,
{67714}{67783}I can't.|I've got things to do.
{67788}{67856}Hold on a minute,
{68378}{68469}Nolens volens, Like it or not,|show them around town.
{68474}{68553}You owe us, and we've had it|up to here with sushi.
{68558}{68632}- But they don't speak Spanish.|- Use sign language.
{68691}{68729}I don't have a car.
{68734}{68801}Take ours.|We'll take a cab to the movies.
{68806}{68850}- Where should I take them?|- Let's see.
{68855}{68949}Try "Plaza" Garibaldi.|- Or the Paseo de la Reforma.
{68954}{69032}- What are you seeing?|- The latest Kurosawa. See you.
{69037}{69095}Thank God -|a day without flashbulbs!
{70855}{70907}Anything you'd like to hear, sir?
{71088}{71169}I fuckin' love broads.|I love 'em.
{71176}{71222}I can't help it, man.
{71227}{71333}And you know what? I've been|a real fuckhead with all of 'em.
{71349}{71455}But what can I do? I'm weak.|What am I supposed to do?
{71518}{71574}I swear I'm not that way.
{71579}{71634}I'm not that way, man.
{71654}{71759}But what can I do?|It's too late. I can't change.
{71946}{72038}You know what?|For the first time, I'm in love
{72043}{72114}like a fucking romantic.
{72129}{72189}And I haven't got|a chance in hell.
{72194}{72261}And it's not her body, man.
{72274}{72357}It's what she's awakened in me.
{72500}{72558}If Clarisa turns me down,
{72563}{72606}it's harakiri, man.
{72611}{72681}Harakiri, you understand?
{73158}{73249}Fucking asshole Jap.
{73265}{73339}I love you, you fucker.
{73410}{73457}I fuckin' love you, Takeshi.
{74124}{74171}There goes my neighbor.
{74935}{75009}They're making me get married,|but I don't want to.
{75266}{75314}Castrato.
{75829}{75864}A big shot, huh?
{75869}{75913}No, a big hot-shit.
{75918}{75998}No, big hot sauce!
{76264}{76343}I'm faking, Tomas.|I'm faking.
{76731}{76767}What's wrong?
{76957}{76982}You okay?
{76987}{77033}What the fuck|are you doing here?
{77038}{77128}You don't remember?|I was jogging, and you picked me up.
{77133}{77184}It was all a nightmare.
{77189}{77236}You're a nightmare.
{77241}{77360}I'm sick of all you fucking broads,|and all those fuckers,
{77365}{77417}and the whole fucking world.
{77666}{77712}There's nothing clean left.
{77738}{77803}We shit on everything.
{77808}{77867}Nobody knows where he is|or what he wants.
{77872}{77986}We're just a bunch of floating shit,|afraid to breathe 'cause we might die.
{77997}{78073}God should flush us down|once and for all!
{78095}{78137}- Tomas?|- What do you want?
{78167}{78202}Where's Lucia?
{78207}{78287}You must have said something.|She just ran out in a panic.
{78292}{78369}She couldn't take the truth.|What do you want?
{78374}{78443}What you did|to Takeshi wasn't right.
{78448}{78493}What I did to him?
{78505}{78559}Takeshi's a kamikaze.
{78589}{78641}You left him at the wrong hotel.
{78645}{78726}He had to call a cab|and carry Koyi back to their own hotel.
{78731}{78799}I thought he was staying|at the Nikko.
{78804}{78868}He said everyone|should drive a Nissan.
{78873}{78920}Let it be a lesson to him.
{78925}{79016}- What's wrong with Tomas?|- He's feeling seasick.
{79021}{79073}"Dizzy" and thirsty.|Completely hung over.
{79086}{79148}I saw his tests.|It's nothing too serious.
{79167}{79263}He's got strep.|Penicillin will take care of it.
{79268}{79346}But I told him to avoid any close|encounters, for health reasons.
{79351}{79405}I really got him good this time!
{79522}{79687}For every action|there is an equal|and opposite|reaction.
{79692}{79771}Newton's Third Law
{79786}{79857}- I'm going to die!|- Why?
{79862}{79948}It was positive!|I'm going to die, Paola!
{79953}{80041}- Does your husband know?|- I just found out myself!
{80381}{80432}It's Paola,|"How" are you?
{80437}{80460}Still alive.
{80465}{80533}There's something|you ought to "know,"
{80538}{80635}A friend of mine was seeing|an irresponsible guy like you
{80640}{80693}"who never used a condom,
{80698}{80741}What's that got to do with me?
{80746}{80790}The guy has AIDS,
{80834}{80938}Listen, baby, AIDS and I have got|a bilateral nonaggression pact.
{80943}{81005}The problem is|I was her husband's lover,
{81010}{81120}and since you and I got together recently,|you should take precautions.
{81125}{81167}Thanks for letting me know.
{81172}{81280}I can tell you a good place|to go for self-hypnosis,
{81285}{81321}Bye.
{83439}{83543}This is a message for Dr. Mateos,|extension 4232,
{83548}{83601}from Tomas Tomas.
{83614}{83703}Tell him he's an asshole|for not having the balls -
{83708}{83805}that's with a B -|to tell me I have AIDS!
{83810}{83879}No, you can't get AIDS|over the phone, ma'am!
{84269}{84301}Paola.
{84337}{84381}That bitch!

{86445}{86477}Doctor?
{86482}{86546}Did you look at Tomas's|test results?
{86551}{86605}Of course.|It's my responsibility.
{86610}{86658}You didn't find|anything serious, did you?
{86663}{86705}Nothing. Why?
{86726}{86801}It's just that I played|a bad joke on him.
{86805}{86829}I know.
{86833}{86884}You jiggled the needle|when you drew his blood.
{86890}{86925}There's more.
{86937}{86990}I marked his HIV test positive.
{87012}{87058}Positive!
{87097}{87166}And I told him to abstain!
{87193}{87281}No wonder!|He must be living a nightmare!
{87285}{87349}Lmagine!|That should calm him down a bit!
{87354}{87425}Calm him down? He's probably|out of his mind right now?
{87461}{87497}Positive!
{87502}{87537}AIDS!
{87562}{87657}Sylvia, why'd you do that|to poor Tomas?
{87751}{87807}You've been|an asshole, Tomas.
{87825}{87881}You wasted your time
{87899}{87941}and your life.
{87972}{87995}Tomas, it's your mother,
{88015}{88064}Mom, for Christ's sake!
{88070}{88164}Watch out with your microwave,|A gringa used hers to kill her dog,

{89017}{89056}Yes, ma'am.
{89061}{89120}Just like the gringa's|French poodle.

{95126}{95205}A stupid life|deserves a stupid death.
{95285}{95354}- Who's there?|- Clarisa. Your neighbor.
{95495}{95537}What are you doing?
{95586}{95629}Committing suicide.
{95704}{95778}Then... maybe I should|leave you alone.
{95783}{95817}No, don't.|What can I do for you?
{95822}{95881}- Nothing, thanks.|- Really - anything you want.
{95906}{95949}I was wondering...
{95962}{96013}if you could give me a hand.
{96027}{96141}A hand? You don't want my hand,|believe me.
{96151}{96222}- You can't help me?|- Help you? Of course.
{96227}{96368}Look, there was an unexpected|change of crew in Acapulco,
{96373}{96450}and I got a shorter route,|so I'm back early.
{96459}{96517}Carlos is probably still flying.
{96523}{96554}And I've lost my keys.
{96559}{96654}- You don't have a spare?|- Yes, on my night table.
{96685}{96741}Maybe you could get in|by the ledge.
{96745}{96765}The ledge?
{96781}{96856}I don't think so.|It's very dangerous.
{96861}{96953}- You won't do me that favor?|- No. I mean yes!
{96957}{97030}For you more than anyone.|Better now than never.
{97035}{97055}Thank you.
{97081}{97131}No, thank you.
{97384}{97429}- No, this is wrong.|- Why?
{97434}{97454}Yeah, why?
{97459}{97520}We taught him a lesson - fine.
{97525}{97590}But we've got to stop him|before he does something stupid.
{97595}{97672}When have you ever|stopped him before?
{97692}{97745}It doesn't matter.|Let's go save him.
{97750}{97810}Takeshi, Tomas harakiri.
{97883}{97911}I'll drive.
{99357}{99437}- Here are your keys.|- Thanks. Would you like some coffee?
{99442}{99497}No, I have to finish this.
{99501}{99558}Well, I mustn't keep you.
{99578}{99614}Listen...
{99626}{99673}don't go back|to your apartment.
{99689}{99735}You won't like what you see.
{99740}{99786}After clearing 300 dinner trays,
{99791}{99865}there's nothing like waiting|at home for my captain to land.
{99870}{99917}I don't think so.
{99949}{99981}Thanks.
{99994}{100030}See you later.
{100085}{100126}Or maybe not, right?
{100156}{100185}Good luck.
{100670}{100725}This time you went|too far, Sylvia.
{100741}{100800}You should control|your impulses.
{100805}{100851}Ira furor brevis est,|for God's sake!
{100856}{100914}He's the one|who went too far.
{100919}{101031}Okay, I jiggled the needle|when I drew his blood,
{101036}{101107}but that doesn't justify|taking me to his bed
{101112}{101177}while he had Mrs. Gold|waiting in yours.
{101182}{101232}That's one point for Sylvia.
{101237}{101359}And our Casanova gave me|just 20 seconds of his glory -
{101364}{101405}she got all the rest!
{101410}{101448}2-0, Matito!
{101453}{101498}Good-bye, Mateo.
{101503}{101581}You were stupid|to be jealous of me.
{101586}{101663}Teresa, what can I say?
{101683}{101764}"The leopard never|changes his spots."
{101777}{101821}Take care of yourselves.
{101840}{101935}Mother, I bid you|a sad farewell,
{101940}{102030}and thanks for suggesting|this painless way out.
{102035}{102082}He did it again!
{102087}{102146}This time with a girl|from Continental!
{102179}{102280}He said he'd never do it again!|He'll never change!
{102294}{102373}Continental!
{102378}{102480}Last time it was United! The girls|from KLM won't look in his direction!
{102485}{102534}But Continental!
{102545}{102626}What can I say?|Things don't always turn out right.
{102657}{102708}But you can start fresh.
{102728}{102764}Or talk to him.
{102769}{102809}No, you don't understand.
{102814}{102899}When we fell in love,|he swore he'd change.
{102904}{102956}He said we'd be like wolves.
{102969}{103031}- Wolves?|- Always faithful.
{103050}{103112}I was his she-wolf|and he was my little wolfey.
{103117}{103197}This is worse|than an emergency landing.
{103202}{103276}I want to die!
{103281}{103345}Come on. You have|a whole life ahead of you.
{103349}{103386}No, Carlos just killed me!
{103413}{103453}He clipped my wings.
{103457}{103502}Forget him.|There are other men.
{103507}{103599}I don't know what to do.|You don't know how I feel.
{103761}{103805}I want to shoot myself.
{103819}{103849}Clarisa, come on.
{103854}{103920}You're going to commit suicide.|Lend me your oven!
{103925}{104004}- No, the oven's mine.|- You first, then me.
{104009}{104064}What if I'm smeared|all over it?
{104069}{104141}I don't want to die|like that French poodle.
{104168}{104200}If you put it that way...
{104205}{104254}I don't want to slash my wrists.
{104307}{104356}Sleeping pills|mess up my stomach.
{104361}{104405}They're awful.
{104410}{104455}I don't want to hang myself.
{104737}{104785}I want to die in the heavens.
{104816}{104850}The heavens?
{104855}{104889}The friendly skies.
{104894}{104933}Are you serious?
{104975}{105000}In the air?
{105045}{105102}Up in the clouds?
{105107}{105162}Up in the sky?
{105170}{105224}Flying like a bird...
{105229}{105290}on the wings of freedom.
{105433}{105504}- Would you like company?|- Why not?
{105509}{105564}The Latin American Tower.
{105598}{105648}The Latin American Tower?
{105686}{105719}Let me explain!
{105724}{105798}Nancy has nothing|to do with us.
{105869}{105909}Nancy from Continental!
{105914}{106010}Who's next?|Debbie from Delta?
{106061}{106138}Nancy jumped|into my taxi and -
{106143}{106196}What's wrong with your car?
{106201}{106269}A message for Dr. Mateos,|extension 4232,
{106274}{106316}from Tomas Tomas:
{106321}{106411}"Forget the microwave. We're jumping|off the Latin American Tower."
{106416}{106464}Mind your own business, ma'am!
{106469}{106511}Let's go!
{107153}{107217}Higher, faster, stronger.
{107222}{107286}Olympic slogan.
{107440}{107518}Why do you want|to commit suicide?
{107640}{107679}I have AIDS.
{107810}{107920}"I'll leave the front door open|so you can get in."
{107930}{107971}Use the ledge.
{107976}{108042}The ledge?|Are you crazy?
{108047}{108103}You brought us here.|You get him out.
{108341}{108381}"My little wolfey."
{108432}{108468}A sly fox!
{108573}{108617}They're all disgusting.
{108635}{108660}Who?
{108669}{108742}Bed-hopping bastards
{108747}{108826}always looking|for something new and different.
{108869}{108933}That's not what's important.
{109184}{109246}I think Sylvia ought to go.
{109251}{109304}No way.|I'm wearing high heels.
{109309}{109382}Come on, Matito. Do it for Tomas.|You can do it.
{109387}{109442}Where there's a will,|there's a way.
{109465}{109500}Right.
{109581}{109692}"Row, row, row" your boat|gently "down" the stream
{109710}{109821}Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily|Life is but a dream
{109964}{110078}Tomas, ad damnum|adderetur injuria,
{110101}{110147}Motherfucker!
{110209}{110241}I'm disgusting.
{110261}{110295}What?
{110363}{110402}I'm disgusting.
{110653}{110760},,, life is but a dream
{110797}{110852}Message for Dr, Mateos,'
{110857}{110929}Forget the microwave, He's jumping|off the Latin American Tower,
{110934}{111018}I say let the rude creep jump!
{111220}{111267}It's like when you're a kid
{111272}{111344}and you step|on every insect you see.
{111392}{111477}You don't know why,|but you like that crunch.
{111517}{111557}It's wrong...
{111573}{111633}but you keep on doing it.
{111669}{111719}The poor things.
{111732}{111788}You grow up,|but you keep doing the same thing -
{111813}{111873}only now|it's people you step on.
{111878}{111927}It's wrong.|Totally wrong.
{112044}{112100}And I kept right on|stepping on others
{112125}{112187}until something bigger|stepped on me.
{112662}{112707}Is he dead?
{112762}{112797}It's Carlos, your neighbor.
{112802}{112867}Tomas is jumping|off the Latin American Tower!
{113237}{113287}It's a sad night.
{113329}{113372}And cold too.
{113419}{113468}Not a star in sight.
{113554}{113606}Only those down below.
{113663}{113698}The lights.
{113765}{113825}They say time stops at night...
{113927}{113979}and everything stands still.
{114017}{114058}Still.
{114526}{114566}What time is it?
{114598}{114669}I can't tell.|The clock's down there.
{114693}{114752}It doesn't matter.|There's no more time.
{114846}{114931}- We wasted so much time.|- What do you mean?
{114936}{114986}- In life.|- You think?
{115006}{115104}We could have -|I don't know.
{115109}{115185}What? Met before?
{115579}{115621}Martita too?
{115670}{115717}What's that?
{115722}{115789}Tomas's curriculum vitae,
{115822}{115917}I wouldn't be surprised|to find my mother's name here.
{116182}{116237}I know someone on this list.
{116253}{116348}Teresa de Teresa...
{116353}{116389}de Mateos!
{116393}{116450}Let bygones be bygones.
{116555}{116614}What an abyssus abyssum invocat,|for crying out loud!
{116619}{116680}Past loves are like empty glasses.
{116697}{116762}It was before I met you.
{116767}{116833}Need I remind you of Patricia|from Applied Pathology 101?
{116838}{116897}You better|quieta non movere!
{116921}{117014}No use crying|over spilt milk, Matito.
{117047}{117117}Quod Deus conjunxit,|homo non separet,
{117135}{117165}That's right.
{117170}{117241}What God has joined,|let no man put asunder.
{117246}{117301}If you leave me,|I'll kill myself.
{118277}{118337}We're putting an end|to the abyss of life.
{118595}{118660}All that remains|is the abyss below.
{118774}{118825}And the abyss of death.
{119010}{119065}And the abyss between us?
{119070}{119107}Between us?
{119130}{119192}Don't you think|there's an abyss?
{119287}{119338}Not at all.
{119380}{119432}You feel an abyss between us?
{119661}{119702}A very small one.
{120469}{120506}I can't.
{120518}{120559}I could infect you.
{120572}{120621}What does it matter now?
{121607}{121648}Has anyone jumped?
{121654}{121713}Has anyone jumped?|- Jumped?
{121753}{121790}Clarisa's underwear.
{121795}{121882}I think it was|during the storm of '61
{121887}{121949}that a lovelorn young lady
{121954}{122065}jumped off with a depressed|young man she hardly knew.
{123491}{123543}No, Matito, don't!
{123759}{123842}EMERGENCY STAIRCASE
{124255}{124312}During that same storm,
{124317}{124409}the statue of Diana the Huntress|was found wearing a bra
{124413}{124500}reported to belong|to a famous actress.
{126556}{126617}It looks like a long way down,|but it's very close.
{126791}{126838}- Don't let go of my hand.|- Never.
{126843}{126880}Your hand is cold.
{126961}{127000}Listen...
{127005}{127056}don't let go of my hand|after we jump.
{127061}{127093}I'll try.
{127349}{127424}Tomas, you don't have AIDS!
{127442}{127501}I do!|I saw the test results!
{127505}{127573}No, I made it all up!|I swear!
{127578}{127641}She's right!|They were negative!
{127646}{127701}Sylvia marked them positive!
{127706}{127785}Clarisa, forgive me|for the Nancy thing!
{127789}{127845}Go howl at the moon,|you were-wolf!
{127851}{127948}I can't marry you!|I'm going through a selfish period!
{127954}{127991}I need my freedom!
{127996}{128054}Then fly away, you vulture!
{128059}{128117}Then why did you tell me|to stay away from women?
{128122}{128169}You have white spots|on your throat!
{128174}{128221}Penicillin will cure them!
{128226}{128269}Clarisa, don't jump!
{128305}{128343}Don't ever leave me.
{128348}{128423}Never.|If you leave me, I'll kill you.
{128504}{128588}For those sick of life,|love is the cure.
{130033}{130067}How much?
{130133}{130233}
