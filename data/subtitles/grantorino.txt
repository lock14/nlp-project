1
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,282
I'm just so brokenhearted.

2
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,587
I want my daughter to
find another husband.

3
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,037
If she married again there
would be a man in the house.

4
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,765
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.

5
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:30,028
Look at him washing dishes.

6
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,398
He does whatever his
sister orders him to do.

7
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,447
How could he ever become
the man of the house?

8
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,734
Be patient, once he's older,
he will be the man of the house.

9
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,585
No way.

10
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:57,148
Today is a blessed day,
for a child is born.

11
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:05,048
I offer food to nurture this child's body.
I offer clothing to protect this child's flesh.

12
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:09,197
The child is blessed with
a mother and father.

13
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,207
Oh, spirit of this child return
home and do not wander anymore.

14
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:29,764
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.

15
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,144
Live a good life and grow old.

16
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:06,023
Why does that old white man stay here?

17
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:09,697
All the Americans have moved
out of this neighborhood.

18
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,197
Why haven't you gone?

19
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,942
Why don't you strut away,
you dumb rooster?

20
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,456
Those punk-ass Mexicans
messing with you?

21
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,614
Please, it's important.

22
01:47:05,524 --> 01:47:08,198
He went for his lighter
and they shot him.

23
01:47:08,199 --> 01:47:10,782
He didn't even have a gun on him.

24
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:17,164
This time we have witnesses.
These guys will be locked up for a long time.
