1
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,060
<i>Okay.</i>

2
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,399
<i>911 emergency.</i>

3
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,739
I need an ambulance.

4
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:18,409
<i>I have you at 9212 West Third Street
in Los Angeles.</i>

5
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,248
Yes, room number 2.

6
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,668
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

7
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:31,173
There's been a suicide.

8
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,258
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

9
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,887
I am.

10
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,439
<i>In seven days, God created the world.</i>

11
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,945
<i>And in seven seconds...</i>

12
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:00,118
<i>...I shattered mine.</i>

13
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,718
- <i>I can have four new fillets overnight.</i>
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

14
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:00,052
What is your name again? Ezra?
Is that right?

15
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,014
Yes, sir. I'll just need
your first and last name...

16
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,474
-...so I can call up your account.
- <i>You know what?</i>

17
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,562
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra. I think
I'm gonna mail you the meat back...

18
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,108
...so you can see firsthand the type
of dog food that you're peddling.

19
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,819
That won't be necessary, sir.

20
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:19,781
So how about we just start
with your last name?

21
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,199
Thomas.

22
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,242
And don't even get me started on the pork.

23
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,621
- Have you tried the pork?
- <i>Well, no, sir.</i>

24
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,332
I'm not much of a meat eater myself,
but I hear really great things...

25
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,709
...about the pork.

26
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,128
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.

27
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:38,133
Are you Jewish? Is that why
you don't eat pork, Ezra?

28
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,805
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?

29
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,850
Ben.

30
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,149
Hold on, what was that voice?

31
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,694
I don't... I don't have an
order for a Ben Thomas.

32
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,280
Ezra, what was that voice?

33
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,991
- What voice?
- Are you blind?

34
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,743
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me.

35
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:11,123
A blind beef salesman
who doesn't eat meat.

36
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,962
<i>Now, that... That is rich. That is rich.</i>

37
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,964
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?

38
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:22,636
Did Lawrence in Accounting
put you up to this?

39
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:26,098
Because somehow I can't
imagine the blind, vegan...

40
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,557
<i>...beef salesman having sex.</i>

41
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:32,019
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- <i>You're trying to help me?</i>

42
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,064
The blind beef salesman
is trying to help me?

43
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,276
I'm actually starting to feel
pretty bad for you, Ezra.

44
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,613
Because I look at my life, and it is
surrounded by so much beauty...

45
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,951
<i>...and you can't see shit.</i>

46
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,869
Is that fair?

47
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:49,704
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?

48
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,165
Do you even know what color the ocean is?

49
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,625
<i>Do you?</i>

50
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,545
- It's blue, sir.
-<i>"It's blue, sir."</i>

51
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,005
Say what you wanna say.

52
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,173
<i>React. Say what you wanna say to me.</i>

53
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,134
Thank you for calling Cheyenne Meats.

54
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:07,139
That's not what you wanna say,
you coward. You coward.

55
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,350
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman,
virgin coward!

56
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,687
- Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.
- <i>Say what you wanna say.</i>

57
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:40,963
Ken Anderson. Nicole Anderson.
Allie Anderson. Ed Rice.

58
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:45,593
Steven Phillips. Monica Freeman.
Sarah Jensen.

59
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:55,353
Ken Anderson! Nicole Anderson!
Allie Anderson! Ed Rice!

60
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:00,233
Steven Phillips! Monica Freeman!
And Sarah Jensen!

61
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,422
Hi, can I help you?

62
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,093
Yes. Hello, I'm looking for Emily.

63
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,970
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.

64
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,555
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.

65
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,807
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.

66
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,312
She asked me to watch Duke
until she got back.

67
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,480
Okay.

68
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,151
You ever try mixing banana
peel into the soil?

69
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,237
- Really?
- It works, I swear.

70
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:13,699
Oh, would you by chance
know where I could find her?

71
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,629
<i>Supervisor to 104. Supervisor to 104.</i>

72
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:29,466
Cardiac wing?

73
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,009
Take the elevator to the
fifth floor then turn left.

74
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,011
Thank you.

75
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,309
Well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.

76
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,649
Hold the elevator.

77
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,318
Thank you.

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,042
Can I help you?

79
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,461
Yes. Good evening.

80
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:52,841
I'm here to see Emily Posa.

81
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:57,095
I'm sorry, visiting hours
are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

82
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,349
You know, it is really important
I speak to her for just a moment.

83
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,186
You'll just have to come back
during visiting hours.

84
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,815
Thank you very much.

85
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,331
So if there is one thing
that I have learned...

86
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,333
...and you all should remember
about winning these contracts:

87
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:13,254
Three steps. First, tell them
what you're gonna tell them.

88
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,423
Step two, you tell them.

89
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,009
Step three, tell them what you told them.

90
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:21,553
We are gonna close by reminding them...

91
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:25,265
...that old girl has a 3-percent better
impulse from sea level to vacuum...

92
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:29,437
...and if they pass on that, quite
frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.

93
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,695
Now, if you will excuse me...

94
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:40,447
...I have a very lovely, very hungry
woman at home waiting for me.

95
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,702
<i>Sarah.</i>

96
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,374
Honey.

97
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:55,254
Everyone at work kept saying
it was daylight-savings time.

98
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,298
You were supposed to be here a while ago.

99
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,677
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time. It's work.

100
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,096
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm angry with you.

101
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,889
I'm gonna be angry all night long.

102
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,100
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?

103
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,144
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?

104
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:25,409
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. It's your brother.

105
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:28,245
<i>Where are you?</i>

106
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,249
I'm at the beach house.

107
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,918
<i>Are you okay?</i>

108
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,796
Of course.

109
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,091
<i>Listen, why'd you disconnect the landline?</i>

110
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:45,096
The phone broke.

111
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,599
<i>I don't need it anymore.</i>

112
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,436
Did I...? Did I do something?

113
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,355
No.

114
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,982
Not unless you're smoking again.

115
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,197
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.

116
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:05,450
<i>Are you eating? Are you
taking care of yourself?</i>

117
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,578
- <i>You sound terrible again and...</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine. Look, I gotta go.

118
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:12,624
Give Melanie and the kids a hug and a kiss.

119
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,751
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.

120
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,048
Hold on. I know it's been a while,
but when you were staying here...

121
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,134
...you didn't take something
of mine by mistake, did you?

122
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,554
I remember giving you something.

123
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,519
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.

124
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,148
Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,152
Just remember I love you.

126
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,275
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.

127
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:24,778
Inez, look at me, please.

128
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,490
Inez. I'm speaking to you.

129
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:33,871
I understand you refused to take
your meds again. Is that true?

130
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,789
No, no, no.

131
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:41,754
Let's try using your words
this time, okay, Inez?

132
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,631
I mean, this silent treatment
isn't doing anybody any good.

133
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,134
Inez, how can we help you if...?

134
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,721
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow...

135
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,850
...and see if you've
changed your mind, okay?

136
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,851
Thattagirl.

137
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,441
I thought I was coming
to your office today.

138
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,068
I was in the neighborhood. I thought
I'd stop by, save you the drive.

139
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:08,697
Terrific. Well, look, let's go talk
in my office, yeah? Come on.

140
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:10,240
<i>I take a no-nonsense approach.</i>

141
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:12,701
I mean, I cut the operating
costs of this place...

142
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,495
...over 17 percent last year alone.

143
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:20,083
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

144
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,294
Now, if I could only get my own finances...

145
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:25,255
...in that kind of shape,
I wouldn't have you sitting here.

146
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:26,673
No offense.

147
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:28,967
That your new Beemer out front?

148
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,850
Ben, I mean, when I found out...

149
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,645
...that my bone-marrow
transplant wasn't successful...

150
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:43,441
I'm well aware of your
ongoing medical condition.

151
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,277
Things aren't looking
very promising for me.

152
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,698
Look...

153
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,993
...I have a bonus coming in January.

154
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,455
I just really need this
six-month extension.

155
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,210
Really, I mean, I am doing the very
best I can here, I promise you.

156
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,306
I'm gonna show myself out.

157
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,975
I'll be in touch.

158
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,143
Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

159
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,812
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?

160
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,409
Hello.

161
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,003
My name is Ben.

162
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,841
I totally understand if you
don't wanna speak to me either.

163
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:55,178
But I would really like to just
have a moment of your time.

164
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:19,453
I'm trying to figure out what
kind of man Stewart Goodman is.

165
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:28,253
It is within my power to drastically
change his circumstances.

166
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:34,134
But I don't wanna give that man
a gift that he doesn't deserve.

167
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,476
I need you to tell me
whether or not he is a good person.

168
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,798
"The drug he gives me...

169
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,926
...makes me dizzy.

170
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,473
I want a new one."

171
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,894
Well, that sounds very reasonable, Inez.

172
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,355
What else?

173
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:31,483
You can trust me.

174
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,948
What else, Inez?

175
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,298
He's punishing you?

176
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,344
How is he punishing you?

177
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:05,393
How is he punishing you, Inez?

178
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,667
Ben?

179
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:33,880
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?

180
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,257
To the right. Is there a problem?

181
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:39,259
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.

182
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:42,637
Thank you. Thank you.

183
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,267
You have the wrong impression here.

184
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,185
I'm gonna stop by from time to time...

185
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,688
...make sure you're showing
these people some respect.

186
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:53,106
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?

187
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,401
You don't treat people like that.

188
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,194
Let me explain, okay, Ben?

189
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,363
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!

190
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,656
I'm not giving you anything.

191
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,868
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.

192
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,413
I almost believed.

193
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:18,715
Okay. Grip and rip.

194
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,054
This time it's gonna be a lot different.

195
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,390
Hey.

196
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,060
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.

197
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:34,231
- Good to see you.
- You too.

198
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:35,566
- How are you?
- I'm good.

199
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,902
- Hey, man.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

200
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:41,989
Just coming to make sure that she
is still kicking your ass at everything.

201
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,075
And I am.

202
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,952
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.

203
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,079
All right.

204
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,664
You okay?

205
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:55,419
Yeah, I'm good. You said you were
gonna call me on the 15th.

206
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,003
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.

207
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,548
Doctor didn't have the results,
so I had no information to give you.

208
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,593
Still, you should call me.

209
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,429
- Yeah, I know. Yes, I know.
- We're still friends. Right?

210
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:08,473
Yeah. I'm just...

211
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,143
I'm doing some soul-searching, you know?

212
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,480
Don't do that.

213
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:17,275
- We have a plan.
- I know.

214
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,777
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.

215
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,113
You know, they rent clubs
up at the clubhouse.

216
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,030
I'm well aware of that.

217
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,451
I think I'm gonna keep my ass
unkicked today.

218
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,490
Were you looking at him,
or were you looking at me?

219
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,536
Actually, I was just sitting here.

220
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:54,913
Am I doing it wrong?

221
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,416
I think I saw you in the
elevator the other day.

222
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,544
Oh, yes.

223
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,758
Actually, you are being audited.

224
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:08,969
My name is Ben Thomas.

225
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:13,265
I'm with the IRS, and you
owe the government...

226
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:16,935
...$56,240.19.

227
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,895
I know.

228
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,481
And now you get me.

229
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:24,567
Would you have a seat, please, Miss Posa?

230
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:29,990
So I've been looking over
the income statements...

231
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:33,661
...from the last three years.

232
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:35,328
- 2005...
- Were...?

233
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,416
Were you in my room the other night?

234
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:45,588
No, ma'am, I was not in
your room the other night.

235
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,552
That's not exactly IRS protocol.

236
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,096
So I've been looking over '05, '06 and '07.

237
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:57,268
There seems to be quite a disparity
between what you claimed and...

238
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,769
Mr. Thomas?

239
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,773
I just got discharged.

240
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,277
So, you know, unless you're gonna, like...

241
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,570
...haul me off to some
IRS jail or something...

242
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,115
...I'd really like to get home now.

243
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,287
- Oh, sure. No problem.
- Okay.

244
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:18,913
I'll be in touch.

245
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,708
Welcome to the Travel Inn. Can I help you?

246
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,250
I need a room.

247
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,877
How many hours?

248
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,215
About two weeks.

249
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:44,290
Clear it! That's it, that's it!

250
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,377
All right, come on! <i>Vamos</i>, Manny!

251
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,923
All right, all right. That's it, that's it.

252
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,634
Hey!

253
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:56,761
- What you want?
- Break it up!

254
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,306
- You want some of this?
- Get off! Get off!

255
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:01,808
Hey, Rico, knock it off!

256
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,269
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?

257
00:26:04,436 --> 00:26:06,313
The sanctuary, coach!

258
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,357
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!

259
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,236
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.

260
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:15,071
Now give me 20 starts and stops.

261
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,074
<i>Hello, this is Emily Posa.</i>

262
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:20,368
<i>I'm not home right now,
but please leave a message...</i>

263
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,248
<i>...and I'll call you back
as soon as possible. Thank you.</i>

264
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:27,125
<i>Hi, my name is Susan Nall.
I'm calling because a friend...</i>

265
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,753
<i>...told me you do letterpress
invitations, and I was wondering...</i>

266
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,590
Hello? Hi, this is Emily.

267
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:39,762
Yep, I do wedding invitations.

268
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,348
I'm not able to take any requests,
though, right now.

269
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,728
I know someone nearby who does it.

270
00:26:45,894 --> 00:26:49,856
She's not as good as I am,
but her prices are very...

271
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,277
Hello?

272
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,868
Duke?

273
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,499
Duke.

274
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,460
We're out here.

275
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,134
Hello, Miss Posa.

276
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,511
What are you doing here?

277
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,221
Oh, I came to see you.

278
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,767
Don't you people ever call ahead?

279
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,810
You people tend to try to hide things.

280
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,480
Is that meat?

281
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,981
No! No, no.

282
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,484
No. No meat. No.

283
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:39,030
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.

284
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,741
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.

285
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:45,203
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.

286
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,580
Well, that sucks.

287
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,335
Hey, can we talk? Do you have a moment?

288
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,295
No.

289
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:55,963
Actually, I have to take Duke for a walk.

290
00:27:56,548 --> 00:28:01,010
No problem. I'll go with you,
if you don't mind.

291
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,390
- So...
- Hey, hey.

292
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,099
Hey.

293
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:12,146
So I've been looking over
2005, 2006 and 2007.

294
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,023
Now...

295
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,692
I'm listening.

296
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:19,779
- Can I get him for you?
- Nope. I got him.

297
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,907
Let me get him. Let me get him.
Let me get him.

298
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,910
- You all right?
- Yes.

299
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,954
Whoa, sorry. Whoa, not these.

300
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:32,500
- That's okay. Watch...
- No, no. Heel, heel, heel.

301
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:36,171
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.

302
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:38,382
So I've been looking over...

303
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:43,302
- Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.

304
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:50,102
So you cook it all ahead of time, I see.

305
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,480
No, actually. I can't remember
the last time I cooked.

306
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:58,777
This is my sister's way
of looking out for me from afar.

307
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:00,528
Do you have any siblings?

308
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:03,574
Yes, one brother.

309
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:05,909
He's a... He's a good egg.

310
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,912
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.

311
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:12,750
Are you receiving income from any source...

312
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,251
...that the government
is currently unaware of?

313
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,589
Well, lately I've been taking
to diving in local wishing wells, so...

314
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,050
I mean, but it's just occasional
dimes here and there...

315
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,970
...or, once in a while, a quarter.

316
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,432
No, actually...

317
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,185
...I had to refinance this place
to pay my past-due medical bills.

318
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:38,275
I've been informed that you suffer
from congenital heart failure.

319
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:42,988
Yes. Did you gather that
while stalking me at the hospital?

320
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,449
No, I...

321
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,369
You're currently Status 2,
which means you're sick enough...

322
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,873
...to be on the national
UNOS waiting list...

323
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,000
...but not sick enough to be
admitted into the hospital...

324
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,420
...and placed on Status 1.

325
00:29:58,587 --> 00:30:02,799
So basically, if your heart starts to fail
quickly and no donor can be located...

326
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,220
...you're screwed.

327
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:11,599
Is it true that you said...

328
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,728
...that you do not believe
that you even deserve a heart...

329
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:20,107
...because your life is
unremarkable in every way?

330
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,865
I'm sorry.

331
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:37,375
I don't know why I said that. I'm sorry.

332
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,753
Do you have to take any type
of sensitivity training...

333
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,381
...to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?

334
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:45,925
- No, not really.
- Yeah.

335
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,847
So you don't consider
yourself a good person?

336
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,352
How would you answer that question
if I asked you the same?

337
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:05,069
"Unremarkable" would be
an upgrade for me...

338
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,114
...I assure you.

339
00:31:10,993 --> 00:31:16,123
I'm gonna freeze your accounts
as uncollectible until further notice.

340
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,251
I'm sure that'll buy you five
or six months, penalty-free.

341
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,759
Here's my card.

342
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:31,387
If anyone from the IRS
tries to contact you...

343
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,723
...you call me immediately.

344
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,433
Okay.

345
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:40,646
Thank you.

346
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,609
Okay.

347
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:50,949
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.

348
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,839
Why do I get the feeling you're
doing me a really big favor right now?

349
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:14,096
Because I get the feeling
that you really deserve it.

350
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,935
All right?

351
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,817
You off to...?

352
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,780
You off to pollute someone else's dog now?

353
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,576
No.

354
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,372
Just going home.

355
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,124
Where's that?

356
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,510
Take care, Emily.

357
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,430
You too.

358
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:33,070
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.

359
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,697
And why are you bringing
a fish into your room?

360
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:37,949
Because it's my room.

361
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,577
And I don't want anyone going
into my room, understood?

362
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,206
Well, I don't think you can
keep a fish in your room.

363
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,458
I think I can.

364
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,086
Well, I've never had anybody
who kept a fish in their room.

365
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:51,797
Now you do.

366
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:53,422
Who?

367
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,175
Good night.

368
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:15,195
<i>The first time I ever saw
a box jellyfish...</i>

369
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,074
<i>...I was 12.</i>

370
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:29,251
<i>Our father took us to the
Monterey Bay Aquarium.</i>

371
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,672
<i>I never forgot when he said...</i>

372
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,802
<i>...that it was the most
deadly creature on earth.</i>

373
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,516
<i>To me it was just...</i>

374
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:49,478
<i>...the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.</i>

375
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,280
I spoke to the doctor again.

376
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:02,701
He's gonna send over your files
in the morning.

377
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:07,831
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.

378
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,418
- Any questions?
- Same one.

379
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:13,043
Well, same answer, then.

380
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,590
You know, I was thinking last night
about when we were 14...

381
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,842
...and we made our big pact.

382
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,221
You remember on the beach
in front of your grandparents' house...

383
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:29,018
...we agreed that we would never,
never date each other's girls?

384
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:34,398
I remembered that that night you told
me how much you liked Stacy Miller...

385
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,402
...and that you were gonna
ask her out. And I said:

386
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,282
"Hey, man. You can't.
Her and I already did it."

387
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:44,074
Which we didn't, but I wanted to...

388
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:49,164
...but she liked you way more
than she liked me, and...

389
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:51,373
So I lied to you because I was so jealous.

390
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,128
And I realized that I've been
carrying around this lie...

391
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,547
...in my heart for the last 25...

392
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:00,090
Stop it!

393
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,552
Stop it.

394
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,764
Stay focused.

395
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:09,601
Do what you promised me.

396
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:14,021
- What, you think I'm...?
- Do what you promised me.

397
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,777
You think I'm gonna let
you down now, don't you?

398
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:23,030
I've known you my whole damn life!

399
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,324
Okay?

400
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,911
This? This? This is not something
you do every day.

401
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,456
Okay? This is... This is not easy for me.

402
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,670
I'll make sure everything goes as planned.

403
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,469
Don't worry.

404
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,766
Thank you.

405
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:19,045
Oh, my God.

406
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,797
Hello, Holly.

407
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,965
Look at you.

408
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,972
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

409
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,309
- Really?
- You have a minute?

410
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,936
Sure. Come on in.

411
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:38,063
Here's my desk. Have a seat.

412
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,077
You look great.

413
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:52,996
- I do?
- Yes.

414
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,206
I feel great.

415
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:58,876
- How are you?
- I'm really good.

416
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,211
I need a favor.

417
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,215
Whatever you need, just ask me.

418
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,762
I need a name. Someone in the system.

419
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,014
Someone having a really hard time...

420
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:15,851
...that needs help, but may be
too proud to ask for a handout.

421
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,608
What are you doing?

422
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:25,445
I'm helping.

423
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:31,034
I need a name.

424
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,246
Okay.

425
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,085
<i>Connie Tepos.</i>

426
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:44,672
<i>Her boyfriend almost killed her
last year when she tried to leave.</i>

427
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:49,052
<i>He broke three of her ribs last month.</i>

428
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:52,097
<i>She's scared to death to press charges...</i>

429
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,391
<i>...and we can't do anything.</i>

430
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,987
- Hello.
- Hi.

431
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,407
- Connie Tepos?
- Yes?

432
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,742
My name is Ben Thomas. I'm with the IRS.

433
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,121
IRS? But I always pay my taxes.

434
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,998
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.

435
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,585
I don't understand. What...?

436
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:25,088
May I come in?

437
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:28,257
Not now. My boyfriend is not here.

438
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:31,469
It's very important for your family.

439
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:33,929
For my family?

440
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,693
Beautiful.

441
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:52,197
Please, have a seat.

442
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,494
What's this all about?

443
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,706
Your case has come to my attention.

444
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,835
And I wanted to get to know you.

445
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:06,963
You wanted to get to know me? Why?

446
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,507
Because I'd like to help you.

447
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,510
I don't understand.

448
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,726
I'm aware of your case.

449
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:21,768
And your boyfriend.

450
00:41:21,936 --> 00:41:23,896
What are you talking about?

451
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,068
You know what I'm talking about.

452
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:31,905
No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

453
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,701
Kids, go to your room.

454
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:38,952
He's coming back?

455
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,956
He's not coming back.

456
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,677
You said you were from the IRS,
but you're lying to me.

457
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,597
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.

458
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,014
Who sent you here?

459
00:41:59,182 --> 00:42:00,849
Please sit down.

460
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,518
I'm not going to sit down.

461
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,521
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.

462
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:06,940
You come into my house.

463
00:42:07,106 --> 00:42:09,943
You talking to me about
<i>mi caso y mi boyfriend</i>?

464
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,195
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

465
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:16,114
Nobody? Get out of my house immediately.

466
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,327
You can trust me.

467
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:21,704
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.

468
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:23,289
I talked to Holly.

469
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,085
I can get you out of here.

470
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:32,215
To a safe place. A beautiful place.

471
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,925
Why did you talk to Holly?

472
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,635
Your children are in danger here.

473
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,637
Don't talk about my kids, Mr. Thomas.

474
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,807
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.

475
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,601
Get out of my house now
or I'm gonna call the police.

476
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:46,436
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?

477
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,940
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.

478
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,983
I want you to take my card, and call me...

479
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,902
- I don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.

480
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,862
Okay. Thank you. Get out right now.

481
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,240
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave? This is my house.

482
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,326
Please, just think about it.

483
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,496
I don't need you.

484
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:25,476
- I can't talk right now.
- <i>I need to talk immediately.</i>

485
00:43:25,643 --> 00:43:27,019
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm nowhere.

486
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:28,855
I'm gonna meet you at the house.

487
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:33,108
Look, no. I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling. I'll talk to you next week.

488
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,362
No, no, no. We need to
discuss this right now.

489
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:31,416
Wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.

490
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,128
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.

491
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,422
How you doing, you two?

492
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,257
I'm good.

493
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,425
Got a big day.

494
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,512
Yep. No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.

495
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,264
Yep.

496
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:47,849
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,518
Thank you.

498
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,063
So I heard you raised enough money...

499
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:56,275
...to give a couple of the kids
partial scholarships to college.

500
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,402
It's no big deal.

501
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,737
I just convinced a couple
of bigwig donors...

502
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:04,701
...that what the world really needs
to see is more Latinos on ice.

503
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,208
You know, Ben, I keep asking you this...

504
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,545
...but why me?

505
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:21,259
Because you are a good man.

506
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,052
No, really.

507
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:29,726
Even when you don't know
that people are watching you.

508
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:48,577
Hello?

509
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,083
<i>Okay, I can't hear you, so try back again.</i>

510
00:45:56,085 --> 00:45:58,086
Gonna hang up now.

511
00:45:58,963 --> 00:46:00,757
Bye.

512
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,603
Mr. Thomas?

513
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,731
We're ready for you.

514
00:47:44,485 --> 00:47:47,070
These are beautiful.

515
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,199
Banana peels. Who knew?

516
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:18,811
Emily?

517
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,951
Can I get a refill?

518
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:02,331
- Susan?
- Yeah.

519
00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:03,666
How's Ryan?

520
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:07,085
He's good. He's at his dad's this weekend.

521
00:50:07,253 --> 00:50:13,717
Will you tell him for me that I'm ready
whenever he is for a free lesson?

522
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,010
Yeah, all right.

523
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:17,512
Things are kind of crazy
right now with school...

524
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,514
...but maybe when school's out.

525
00:50:19,682 --> 00:50:22,351
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

526
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,045
How's the pie?

527
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,090
Oh, it's... it's good.

528
00:50:53,257 --> 00:50:55,342
You gonna ask her out?

529
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,969
The waitress.

530
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,974
No.

531
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,893
You never know.

532
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:10,565
I don't... I don't think she sees me.

533
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:14,402
Good night, Ezra.

534
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,983
Hello?

535
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,445
Ben?

536
00:51:58,405 --> 00:52:00,449
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.

537
00:52:03,577 --> 00:52:07,206
Did...? Did someone
from the IRS contact you?

538
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:09,208
No.

539
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,043
I just...

540
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:16,297
I was having trouble breathing after
I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.

541
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,885
<i>An ambulance had to take
me to the hospital.</i>

542
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,054
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

543
00:52:23,222 --> 00:52:25,306
I don't know why I even
called you. I'm sorry.

544
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:28,978
It's just that I have your card
with me, and...

545
00:52:33,023 --> 00:52:34,233
Ben?

546
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,155
Are you still there?

547
00:52:40,072 --> 00:52:41,614
Yes.

548
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,496
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?

549
00:52:49,748 --> 00:52:51,583
Every now and again.

550
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,380
My face is bluish.

551
00:52:56,547 --> 00:52:59,550
It's not exactly a good sign.

552
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:02,260
You should try to rest. Just...

553
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,181
Why don't you see
if you can get some sleep?

554
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,266
I like talking to you.

555
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:10,603
<i>I like talking to you too.</i>

556
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,275
Would you tell me a story, please?

557
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,197
Okay.

558
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:28,077
All right. Once upon a time...

559
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:32,248
<i>...there was a little boy named...</i>

560
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:36,670
Oh, lucky me, you just got it
on reserve like that. Okay.

561
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:39,965
Let me guess. His name was Ben.

562
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,347
No, actually, this little
boy's name is Tim.

563
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,891
I like the name Tim.

564
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,893
Go on.

565
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,478
<i>Tim's little brother was
always pestering Tim...</i>

566
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:59,108
...to make him paper airplanes,
because he was really good at it.

567
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:02,612
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.

568
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,490
Okay. Then what happened?

569
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,534
One day, Tim went out to the backyard...

570
00:54:08,702 --> 00:54:13,539
...and he put leaves and taped
branches to his arms...

571
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,793
...and started climbing the big oak tree.

572
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,713
<i>His little brother said,
"Tim, you can't fly."</i>

573
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,257
<i>And he said, "Yeah? You just watch."</i>

574
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,594
He got all the way to the top and jumped.

575
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,432
How tall was this tree?

576
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:34,853
<i>It was... it was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.</i>

577
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,690
Oh, my God... This is a horrible story.

578
00:54:37,856 --> 00:54:39,315
Oh, no, no. It gets better.

579
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:45,155
From that experience,
Tim realized that he wanted to fly.

580
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,451
So he dedicated his life
to making spaceships.

581
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,288
I thought you said this was a good story.

582
00:54:53,664 --> 00:54:55,456
Oh, well...

583
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,876
Yeah, that is...

584
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:02,130
...until the dragons showed up.

585
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:06,260
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.

586
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:09,722
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.

587
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:14,476
Yes, and these were
fire-breathing space dragons...

588
00:55:14,643 --> 00:55:17,353
<i>...with really bad attitudes.</i>

589
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,315
I see.

590
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,152
I have an idea.

591
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,695
<i>Why don't you try to fall asleep...</i>

592
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:29,742
<i>...and when you do, I'll just hang up.</i>

593
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,579
Okay.

594
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,164
Ben?

595
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,708
Yes.

596
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,338
Thank you for listening.

597
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:45,465
And for talking.

598
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,677
<i>Try to fall asleep.</i>

599
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,684
Good night, Ben.

600
00:55:57,853 --> 00:55:59,688
Good night, Emily.

601
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,045
Emily?

602
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,000
Emily?

603
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,135
I lied to you.

604
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,139
I think about dying every day.

605
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:30,528
<i>Dr. King to NICU. Dr. Wesley King,
please report to NICU.</i>

606
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,322
Hey.

607
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:21,496
- Hey.
- Hey.

608
00:58:23,123 --> 00:58:24,583
When did you get here?

609
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,005
Last night, after we talked.

610
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,175
You slept here?

611
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:37,846
Good morning. How's our patient?

612
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,056
- Morning. Better.
- Good.

613
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:43,101
- Hello.
- Hi, Ben. Is that right? IRS?

614
00:58:43,268 --> 00:58:45,019
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

615
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,231
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please. Don't go.

616
00:58:48,398 --> 00:58:50,067
He can... He can stay.

617
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,152
Whatever you want.

618
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,572
You fainted because
your heart was too weak...

619
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,534
...to pump enough blood to your brain.

620
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,702
It's enlarged and it's
starting to shut down.

621
00:59:02,496 --> 00:59:03,746
How long?

622
00:59:04,414 --> 00:59:06,458
It's entirely up to your heart.

623
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:10,545
Could be six weeks, could be a month.

624
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:13,715
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.

625
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,094
At least I'm on the list.

626
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:22,099
Not only that, but we're
giving you this pager.

627
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:26,018
And when it goes off,
it means you have a donor.

628
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,108
The inotrope drug I started you on...

629
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,445
...it's gonna stabilize your
blood pressure within 24 hours.

630
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:38,072
Then what?

631
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,284
We wait.

632
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:44,413
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.

633
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,581
Okay.

634
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:02,972
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.

635
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,601
If you want something else,
I can get you something else.

636
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,565
Would you stay?

637
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,112
I mean, unless you have
something else to do.

638
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:25,454
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.

639
01:00:27,456 --> 01:00:30,041
Okay. Okay.

640
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:48,434
Hey, hey, hey. What the hell is that thing?

641
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,646
It's a dog. Just for one night.

642
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,356
No. Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?

643
01:00:53,523 --> 01:00:55,108
We have a dog policy here.

644
01:00:55,275 --> 01:00:57,902
Little dogs only. Poodles and Shih Tzus.

645
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,447
It's in the contract. It's English
and Spanish for everyone to see.

646
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:04,242
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog.

647
01:01:04,409 --> 01:01:06,452
It's a goddamn horse.

648
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:10,498
Well, let me know when you add
a horse policy to the contract.

649
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,527
Yes.

650
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,405
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.

651
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:43,864
Hey, Connie.

652
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:46,576
<i>I don't know why I'm calling you...</i>

653
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:49,036
...but I'm calling you.

654
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,039
You said you could help us and...

655
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,583
Can you really help us?

656
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,838
This just doesn't make any sense.

657
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,715
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.

658
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:02,425
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.

659
01:02:02,592 --> 01:02:05,010
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.

660
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,556
Don't be weak.

661
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,393
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.

662
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,896
I'm strong.

663
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,527
Take this. Take it.

664
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,780
You are gonna start this car...

665
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,867
...and you're gonna go.

666
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:33,081
This is real, and this is
gonna be your new life.

667
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,918
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

668
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:40,463
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.

669
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,465
Look how beautiful those babies are.

670
01:02:42,632 --> 01:02:45,010
I know, I know.

671
01:02:46,094 --> 01:02:47,929
They deserve it.

672
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,766
Okay?

673
01:02:53,393 --> 01:02:56,855
<i>You're headed north up the coast.</i>

674
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:22,338
Lorena. Lorena.

675
01:03:23,548 --> 01:03:27,802
<i>I've always believed
this place can heal the soul.</i>

676
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:33,974
Mommy, the ocean.

677
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,936
Yes, the ocean.

678
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,646
<i>I hope that proves true for you.</i>

679
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:02,170
<i>When you sign your name on the
dotted line of the contract...</i>

680
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,922
<i>...you'll own my house outright.</i>

681
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,554
<i>I only ask that you never mention
how you got the house...</i>

682
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:14,391
<i>...or try to contact me for any reason.</i>

683
01:04:18,728 --> 01:04:22,606
<i>And if you're wondering
why you, please stop.</i>

684
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:33,117
<i>All I ask is for you to honor my wishes...</i>

685
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:40,083
<i>...and, of course, live life abundantly.</i>

686
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:55,097
Hey. Thanks. Got it.

687
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,099
Hi, Duke.

688
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,351
Hi, baby.

689
01:05:00,353 --> 01:05:02,563
What time does the nurse come?

690
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:05,608
She should be there by the time I get home.

691
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,155
- Ben?
- Yes.

692
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,744
I know I'm the girl with the broken wing.

693
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,246
But who are you?

694
01:05:19,748 --> 01:05:21,041
Who am I?

695
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,251
I am your friendly neighborhood
tax collector.

696
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,920
Ben.

697
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,965
Where the hell did you come from?

698
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:35,804
I grew up in Oakland.

699
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,266
Literally. Okay.

700
01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:43,438
Where did you go to college?

701
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,858
As far from Oakland as possible.

702
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:50,320
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

703
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:52,280
How about you?

704
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:54,449
UCLA.

705
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:58,077
You went to MIT?

706
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,623
Like, the MIT?

707
01:06:04,376 --> 01:06:10,297
Oh, and now you're wondering how
I wound up as a lowly tax collector.

708
01:06:10,465 --> 01:06:12,300
Absolutely.

709
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:22,268
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.

710
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:24,728
What from?

711
01:06:26,398 --> 01:06:28,733
I always wanted to be an engineer.

712
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,735
An engineer?

713
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,322
What kind?

714
01:06:36,282 --> 01:06:38,994
The kind that sent people to the moon.

715
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,829
Really?

716
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,414
Yes.

717
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:46,835
I don't wanna talk about me anymore.

718
01:06:48,086 --> 01:06:52,297
That's too bad, because
you're very interesting.

719
01:07:00,557 --> 01:07:02,266
Have you...?

720
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,603
Have you ever been in love?

721
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,023
Emily, please.

722
01:07:09,733 --> 01:07:11,775
Yes, you have.

723
01:07:11,943 --> 01:07:13,360
Come on, you can tell me.

724
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,784
Yes.

725
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,454
But it ended.

726
01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:26,206
- What happened?
- Stop it.

727
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:28,876
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- Stop it.

728
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,882
You need to get some rest.

729
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:38,969
I'll call you tomorrow,
or maybe I'll stop by.

730
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:45,184
No, if I have questions
tomorrow, what then?

731
01:07:46,978 --> 01:07:49,271
That's not a part of the deal.

732
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,942
What the hell does that mean?

733
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,757
Emily, hold on. Hold on.

734
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:20,011
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.

735
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,637
Wait!

736
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:34,734
Thank you for everything you did.

737
01:09:08,101 --> 01:09:09,769
Did you like the eggs?

738
01:09:09,936 --> 01:09:11,938
They were okay, I guess.

739
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:14,439
I don't like the eggs you buy.

740
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,609
Okay.

741
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,849
You're wearing suit pants.

742
01:09:48,766 --> 01:09:50,393
To weed.

743
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,689
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't have
any other clothes with me.

744
01:09:55,231 --> 01:09:58,193
- You know, I was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.

745
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:03,030
I figured I would just take the day off
and get this done for you.

746
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:07,409
Ben?

747
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,869
Yeah?

748
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:11,914
This is a really ridiculous apology.

749
01:10:17,837 --> 01:10:21,466
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

750
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,551
Oh, no, I gotta finish.

751
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:27,555
You can finish tomorrow.

752
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:30,725
Come on.

753
01:10:45,615 --> 01:10:47,242
This is where I used to work.

754
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,496
And these are the artifacts of said work.

755
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,748
Wow, those are great. How old are they?

756
01:10:56,417 --> 01:11:01,797
This one is just shy of 120 years.

757
01:11:02,298 --> 01:11:07,679
It's how I put out my line of letterpress
cards, wedding invitations, invites.

758
01:11:07,845 --> 01:11:09,639
What about this one?

759
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,057
That youngster...

760
01:11:12,225 --> 01:11:17,020
...is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.

761
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,439
Call it "The Beast."

762
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,484
Well, that seems appropriate.

763
01:11:22,944 --> 01:11:25,488
It pooped out on me
about five years ago, though.

764
01:11:25,655 --> 01:11:28,283
And I can't find anybody to fix it.

765
01:11:28,449 --> 01:11:30,952
It's kind of a dying art.

766
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:33,704
Defibrillator here works, though.

767
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,291
Luckily. It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?

768
01:11:36,457 --> 01:11:38,167
Please.

769
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:42,130
Okay. Now, true pressmen...

770
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:45,675
...hate that we modern girls...

771
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:48,636
...want a deep impression.

772
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:53,307
See, for a hundred years, they tried
their damnedest just to kiss it...

773
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:56,894
...so that it didn't leave an indentation.

774
01:11:57,854 --> 01:12:01,315
Now it's the only way
to prove it's not digital.

775
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,698
I think it feels richer.

776
01:12:11,034 --> 01:12:12,827
You okay?

777
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,953
Yeah.

778
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,373
Look, Ben...

779
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:25,506
I don't really know anything about you
or where you came from...

780
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,051
...but you keep showing up.

781
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:34,056
And I'm glad.

782
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:36,005
Okay.

783
01:12:38,628 --> 01:12:40,229
Okay.

784
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:44,567
So Duke needs a walk.

785
01:12:44,734 --> 01:12:46,485
Are you interested?

786
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,863
Yes.

787
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,210
Come on.

788
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,880
Hey, hey.

789
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:08,548
Right here.

790
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:10,467
There you go.

791
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:14,055
He's like a different dog with you around.

792
01:13:14,555 --> 01:13:17,391
I don't think we ever properly bonded.

793
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:21,061
Why would you get such a big dog?

794
01:13:25,274 --> 01:13:31,154
Did you know that Great Danes on
average only live about seven years?

795
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,201
They have heart issues.

796
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,122
I think I got him because...

797
01:13:40,748 --> 01:13:43,333
...I thought he could help me
with my illness.

798
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:46,128
It'd be something
I could take care of...

799
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:49,006
...as opposed to being
always taken care of.

800
01:13:53,386 --> 01:13:56,764
You know, just so you know,
I used to be really hot.

801
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:01,601
Like, unauditably hot.

802
01:14:02,186 --> 01:14:04,146
Is that so?

803
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:05,856
Yeah.

804
01:14:12,905 --> 01:14:15,949
I haven't felt like this
in a really long time.

805
01:14:25,793 --> 01:14:28,421
There's so many things that I wanna do.

806
01:14:31,632 --> 01:14:33,634
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours...

807
01:14:33,801 --> 01:14:37,345
...and not have to stress
that I can't reach my doctor.

808
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:43,810
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.

809
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:46,730
See the world.

810
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:53,195
I just wanna have the time
to figure out who it is that I am.

811
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,614
You know, what I like.

812
01:14:58,284 --> 01:15:01,496
Do things, try things,
get out of my head for once.

813
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:09,295
I would really like to go running.

814
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:12,465
I think about that sometimes.

815
01:15:12,632 --> 01:15:16,927
What it would just feel like
to go running.

816
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:53,506
So...

817
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,091
...see you tomorrow?

818
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:59,136
Yes.

819
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:05,225
But if you need anything,
just call and I'll come right back.

820
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,979
Okay.

821
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,737
Bye.

822
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:30,083
I had a really great time today.

823
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,377
Me too.

824
01:16:33,796 --> 01:16:35,463
Bye.

825
01:20:45,756 --> 01:20:48,801
No anesthetic. You ever
donated bone marrow before?

826
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,845
You're a brave guy.

827
01:20:53,597 --> 01:20:55,975
How long have you known Nicholas?

828
01:21:05,734 --> 01:21:07,778
What the hell happened to you?

829
01:21:09,738 --> 01:21:12,783
Hey, how much longer are you
gonna stay in my hotel?

830
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,201
Motel.

831
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:16,244
How much longer?

832
01:21:17,204 --> 01:21:20,207
Actually, I was planning
on dying here.

833
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,335
Well, then you need to pay
in advance.

834
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,305
Hello?

835
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,934
Hey, it's Emily.

836
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,685
Are you sleeping?

837
01:22:24,104 --> 01:22:26,689
Yes. No.

838
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,359
Is everything okay?

839
01:22:30,444 --> 01:22:32,488
Yeah, I'm fine.

840
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:36,783
My sister came over for a couple
of days last week with the kids...

841
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,453
...and it was really great.

842
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:43,498
<i>I tried calling you a couple times.</i>

843
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,250
<i>How are you doing?</i>

844
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:47,252
Yeah, I'm good.

845
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,421
Everything's fine. I've been...

846
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:54,801
I've been traveling a lot, so...

847
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,722
Well, are you busy tonight?

848
01:23:01,475 --> 01:23:02,810
What do you mean?

849
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:07,648
I don't... Maybe you wanna
come by and say hello?

850
01:23:07,815 --> 01:23:09,649
Around 7?

851
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:14,363
<i>You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know...</i>

852
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:22,496
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna
hang out with the dying girl, so...

853
01:23:23,789 --> 01:23:26,958
I can... I can come at 7.

854
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:30,302
Okay.

855
01:23:31,827 --> 01:23:33,226
Okay.

856
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:36,051
Bye.

857
01:24:20,387 --> 01:24:23,974
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.

858
01:24:24,141 --> 01:24:26,726
- How you doing?
- Have fun.

859
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,729
- Hi.
- Hi.

860
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,564
Come in.

861
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:34,025
I am so glad she's gone.

862
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:35,903
Are you okay if we eat outside?

863
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:37,404
Eating?

864
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,030
You didn't eat already, did you?

865
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:41,408
- No.
- Okay.

866
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:44,619
No.

867
01:24:44,787 --> 01:24:48,039
Well, it was a surprise...

868
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,542
...but you're on time.

869
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:58,091
I haven't cooked anybody food
for years, so you better like it.

870
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,219
Or lie to me.

871
01:25:03,097 --> 01:25:04,680
This is for you.

872
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:10,395
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it... Change in there.

873
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:14,108
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.

874
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:16,902
Chop-chop.

875
01:26:17,671 --> 01:26:19,422
You look great.

876
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:22,509
Yeah. It's pink.

877
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:24,720
It's salmon.

878
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:39,693
You are so nice.

879
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:43,197
So are you.

880
01:26:51,163 --> 01:26:53,539
Everything's vegetarian.

881
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:56,210
I hope you like eggplant Parmesan.

882
01:27:00,547 --> 01:27:04,301
I haven't treated myself very well...

883
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,970
...in the past few years.

884
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:11,057
Start now.

885
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:20,484
All right.

886
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,576
What do you think?

887
01:27:34,164 --> 01:27:36,250
It's delicious.

888
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,628
Glad you like it.

889
01:28:20,877 --> 01:28:23,130
Do you wanna hear my favorite song?

890
01:28:24,172 --> 01:28:26,550
Yes. Are you gonna sing it?

891
01:28:30,846 --> 01:28:32,972
No, I can't sing anymore.

892
01:28:33,932 --> 01:28:35,641
Oh, and a performance.

893
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,685
Oh, no.

894
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,939
Shall we?

895
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:43,877
You need to relax.

896
01:29:44,878 --> 01:29:47,088
This is relaxed.

897
01:30:18,912 --> 01:30:21,331
I have a surprise for you.

898
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:25,252
Surprise?

899
01:30:26,002 --> 01:30:27,587
Yes.

900
01:30:28,296 --> 01:30:29,797
For me?

901
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,429
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

902
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:45,104
And open.

903
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,278
Okay.

904
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:00,912
You cleaned The Beast.

905
01:31:02,164 --> 01:31:04,623
Actually, I fixed it.

906
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:07,293
No, you didn't.

907
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,212
Oh, okay, let's go, then.

908
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:12,381
Wait. Are you serious?

909
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:14,134
Try it.

910
01:31:22,601 --> 01:31:24,185
Okay.

911
01:32:07,854 --> 01:32:09,564
Thank you.

912
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:52,774
Wait right here, okay?

913
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:55,652
I'll be right back. Wait right here.

914
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,239
One second.

915
01:33:12,127 --> 01:33:13,587
Hey!

916
01:33:14,671 --> 01:33:16,506
Tell me what's going on.

917
01:33:17,007 --> 01:33:18,341
- Now!
- All right.

918
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,676
Ben, you need to go home.

919
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:24,805
Do you know they keep a full history of
every inquiry a revenue officer makes?

920
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:26,765
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.

921
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:30,103
- Just keep your voice down.
- No. What you are doing is a crime!

922
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:32,771
You are impersonating
a federal officer. It's a felony!

923
01:33:32,939 --> 01:33:34,189
All right. Listen.

924
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:37,819
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?

925
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:41,197
All right. All right,
there's a coffee shop.

926
01:33:41,364 --> 01:33:43,449
There's a coffee shop
near where I'm staying.

927
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:46,202
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- Where are you staying, Tim?

928
01:33:46,369 --> 01:33:48,954
Tell me, because I don't know
where my brother lives!

929
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,791
A motel. Five blocks from here.

930
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:54,293
We'll sit down tomorrow morning,
I guarantee it.

931
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,212
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.

932
01:34:03,845 --> 01:34:06,389
Here it is. Here. Here.

933
01:34:08,141 --> 01:34:09,684
Just go home.

934
01:34:09,851 --> 01:34:13,020
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.

935
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:15,481
Tim, Tim, Tim, why are you even here?

936
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:18,318
Tell me, who is Emily Posa?

937
01:34:21,029 --> 01:34:23,113
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

938
01:34:28,703 --> 01:34:30,829
Look, give me your car keys.

939
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:40,131
I'm not going anywhere.

940
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,841
I'm gonna be right here.

941
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:48,264
So you remember I love you and...

942
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:52,101
Tim, don't make me come knock
on the door, okay?

943
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:23,173
I didn't realize how late it was and...

944
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:29,805
I have a really long drive,
so I need to go.

945
01:35:33,476 --> 01:35:35,478
I don't wanna keep lying to you.

946
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:39,899
I don't wanna... Wait, Emily.

947
01:37:40,311 --> 01:37:42,521
Do you wanna play a game?

948
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:45,859
What game?

949
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:55,033
The "what if" game.

950
01:37:56,494 --> 01:37:58,371
What if...

951
01:37:59,873 --> 01:38:02,041
...my pager goes off...

952
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:07,046
...and it's a heart...

953
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:10,132
...and...

954
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,886
...it works?

955
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:17,222
And my body doesn't reject it?

956
01:38:19,475 --> 01:38:21,394
And...

957
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:28,192
...what if I have time?

958
01:38:41,623 --> 01:38:43,457
What if...?

959
01:38:48,463 --> 01:38:51,048
What if we have children?

960
01:38:56,555 --> 01:38:58,931
What if we got married?

961
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:14,529
I love you.

962
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:17,115
- I love you too.
- I love you.

963
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:14,442
Hi.

964
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:17,779
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?

965
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:20,113
She's doing her rounds.

966
01:41:20,282 --> 01:41:23,076
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?

967
01:41:23,743 --> 01:41:24,786
It's very important.

968
01:41:25,328 --> 01:41:28,247
- I'll... I'll page her.
- Thank you.

969
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:33,293
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.

970
01:41:58,862 --> 01:42:00,404
Hey.

971
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,449
- Is it Emily?
- No, no.

972
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,662
I'm sorry.

973
01:42:09,539 --> 01:42:10,957
It's...

974
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:13,042
Is there...?

975
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:16,837
I'm sorry.

976
01:42:17,338 --> 01:42:21,591
Do you have any more optimism...

977
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,345
...about Emily...

978
01:42:24,971 --> 01:42:27,305
...than you did the other day?

979
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:29,391
Ben...

980
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:35,398
...when you're looking for a donor
with a rare blood type...

981
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,359
...the odds go way down.

982
01:42:38,985 --> 01:42:40,485
To what?

983
01:42:41,404 --> 01:42:43,488
They go down. What's the...?

984
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:45,699
Give me a percentage.

985
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:48,661
Give me a number.

986
01:42:49,662 --> 01:42:51,913
Three, 5 percent.

987
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,542
I know. I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.

988
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:58,171
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I do.

989
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:45,384
Hello?

990
01:43:46,052 --> 01:43:47,595
Dan.

991
01:43:48,512 --> 01:43:50,222
It's time.

992
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:52,515
I love you.

993
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:51,993
<i>1:38 a.m.</i>

994
01:44:55,037 --> 01:44:56,288
Hello?

995
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,332
Ezra.

996
01:45:00,752 --> 01:45:03,087
My name is Ben Thomas.

997
01:45:04,797 --> 01:45:07,800
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.

998
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:12,179
I do remember.

999
01:45:12,346 --> 01:45:15,349
<i>I wanna apologize for
being so cruel to you...</i>

1000
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:17,935
...but I had to be certain.

1001
01:45:18,895 --> 01:45:22,355
I had to be certain that you
were a decent man. Kind.

1002
01:45:22,524 --> 01:45:26,068
- <i>Slow to anger.</i>
- What do you want from me?

1003
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:29,279
I wanna give you a gift.

1004
01:45:30,323 --> 01:45:34,076
You're gonna be contacted
by a man named Dan Morris.

1005
01:45:35,078 --> 01:45:37,203
<i>You can trust him.</i>

1006
01:45:37,372 --> 01:45:39,707
Was that you at the diner?

1007
01:45:41,585 --> 01:45:42,752
Goodbye.

1008
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:07,359
<i>911 emergency.</i>

1009
01:46:11,782 --> 01:46:13,573
I need an ambulance.

1010
01:46:13,742 --> 01:46:18,371
<i>I have you at 9212 West Third Street
in Los Angeles.</i>

1011
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:23,542
Yes, room number 2.

1012
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:26,420
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

1013
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:31,050
There's been a suicide.

1014
01:46:31,217 --> 01:46:33,051
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

1015
01:46:35,012 --> 01:46:36,389
I am.

1016
01:46:38,307 --> 01:46:41,018
You are gonna need to stop
looking at that thing so much.

1017
01:46:41,185 --> 01:46:43,895
Why? Is it gonna crack?

1018
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,689
Oh, no. I paid extra
for the non-cracking kind.

1019
01:46:46,858 --> 01:46:48,567
I bet you did.

1020
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:52,404
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know. No more. No more work.

1021
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:54,239
I'm done. Almost done. Almost done.

1022
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:55,949
Tim!

1023
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:52,333
I have procedures.

1024
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:56,005
I understand, but she needs
that heart or she will die.

1025
01:50:17,193 --> 01:50:19,944
- Ben?
- One, two, three.

1026
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,208
Hey.

1027
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:36,670
How you doing?

1028
01:52:43,922 --> 01:52:47,176
About a year after the
accident, I got sick.

1029
01:52:48,595 --> 01:52:52,930
I got lung cancer, and I needed
a double-lobe transplant.

1030
01:52:54,475 --> 01:52:57,269
Tim could only give me one, of course.

1031
01:52:58,061 --> 01:53:00,939
It must have planted a seed, because he...

1032
01:53:02,317 --> 01:53:04,609
About six months later...

1033
01:53:06,488 --> 01:53:09,989
...he donated the right part
of his liver to this woman.

1034
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:16,412
Her name is Holly.

1035
01:55:57,283 --> 01:56:00,284
I'm proud of you kids. Very proud.

1036
01:56:00,453 --> 01:56:03,204
Good job. Good job.

1037
01:56:03,372 --> 01:56:05,373
- Ezra.
- Yeah.

1038
01:56:05,541 --> 01:56:06,958
Hi.

1039
01:56:08,795 --> 01:56:11,630
Are you a parent?

1040
01:56:11,797 --> 01:56:13,131
No.

1041
01:56:14,967 --> 01:56:16,885
Have we met?

1042
01:56:22,265 --> 01:56:23,891
You okay?

1043
01:56:37,698 --> 01:56:39,490
You must be Emily.

1044
01:56:45,622 --> 01:56:47,207
Yes.

1045
01:56:51,310 --> 01:56:53,750
It's so nice to meet you.
