1
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,681
Hold him there. Hold him there!

2
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:35,675
Hey!

3
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:45,979
Henry, we've got a bolter!

4
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,981
Henry, Tucker, go get him!

5
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,806
Get down, hold him!

6
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:58,573
Hold him! Hold him!

7
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,976
Good boy, get down. Get down!

8
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,974
Hold him. That's it.

9
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,002
Good on ya, boy.

10
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:13,033
Come on, Henry!

11
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,900
Henry had a little lamb,

12
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:58,130
its fleece was white as snow,

13
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,500
and everywhere that Dudley went,

14
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:03,594
Henry was sure to go.

15
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:21,492
Mrs. Mac? They're coming down for lunch soon.

16
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,363
Coming down, Henry!

17
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:28,230
Dudley?

18
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:35,494
Dudley, where are you, boy?

19
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,152
Dudley?

20
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,521
Dudley?

21
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:03,720
Dudley?

22
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,623
Dudley?

23
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,320
Come out of there, Dudley.

24
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,953
Ahh! Ah!

25
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,219
Boys!

26
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:41,881
Angus, pull your head in!

27
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:44,445
Henry?

28
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:46,545
Boys.

29
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:51,084
It's your father.

30
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,450
There's been an accident.

31
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,308
City boy, eh?

32
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:33,975
- No, I grew up on a farm.
- Oh, me too.

33
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,607
- Oh.
- You all right, my friend?

34
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:41,079
- Need some fresh air?
- Close it. Close it!

35
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:49,577
Dr. Carey's office.

36
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:52,038
It's Henry Oldfield. I need to speak with her.

37
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,744
She's in a session right now.
Can I have her call you?

38
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:57,006
Please, please.

39
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,277
Nothing like it, eh?

40
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:03,969
God's green earth.
"All creatures great and small."

41
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:06,903
There we go.

42
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:43,426
- Okay.
- This way.

43
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,931
This isn't gonna be like
the salmon farm, is it, Grant?

44
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:52,027
Hey, those fish died free.

45
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:57,168
- Come on, possum.
- Shh shh.

46
00:06:57,202 --> 00:06:59,361
What's that?

47
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:09,726
Angus fucking Oldfield.

48
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:07,153
You'll wait for me, right?

49
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:09,181
It's your money.

50
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:32,916
Hello?

51
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:38,410
Hello?

52
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:24,944
Unless you fancy nostrils
in the back of your head,

53
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,969
I'd not be moving if I were you.

54
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:29,706
Mrs. Mac.

55
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:36,401
Bugger me days! Henry!

56
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,434
Oh! Oh.

57
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:44,333
Oh don't worry.

58
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:47,536
I haven't shot anyone since Christmas.

59
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,771
Oh, just wait until your brother sees you.

60
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,036
Yeah.

61
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:56,532
The Merino, the Romney, the Drysdale...

62
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:59,768
these names are whispered in the winds

63
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,865
that caress the rugged hills.

64
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:03,431
These names are shared

65
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,703
in corners of the farmyard,

66
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,673
and these are the names
the young men of the land recite

67
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,730
as they take themselves off at night.

68
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:15,035
But in the future, they will whisper

69
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,368
just one name...

70
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,228
the Oldfield.

71
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:31,200
Now you take it down and lead it round
in front of the guests.

72
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,625
That's it.

73
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,330
Stop so they can touch it,

74
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,267
slap a flank, feel the wool.

75
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,860
I'll take the other microphone,
give it to anyone else who...

76
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:42,698
has a question.

77
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:44,429
Get a prospectus on every seat,

78
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,799
then go up the hill and get the animal.

79
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,733
What are you doing here?

80
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:51,961
Lawyers have this under control, don't they?

81
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,898
What am I doing here?

82
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,864
Our family's been here for over 100 years.

83
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,993
Our father was born here.

84
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,028
Our mother died giving birth to me here.

85
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,554
This is where I spent
the first 10 years of my life.

86
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,557
And my therapist said I should come.

87
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:16,352
Therapy.

88
00:11:16,797 --> 00:11:20,028
- So you're still funny about the sheep.
- It's not about the sheep.

89
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,126
It's about other issues I need to resolve.

90
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:23,724
Okay.

91
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:29,026
Angus.

92
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,755
Go inside. I'll cut you a check.

93
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:44,487
That must be the laboratory.

94
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,117
Careful.

95
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,387
There you go.

96
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:49,392
- Okay.
- Astrid Rush.

97
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,687
Who'd hire her
after the thing with the leeches?

98
00:11:57,358 --> 00:12:00,915
- You're end?
- Come and give a hand here.

99
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,622
Careful!

100
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,486
Grant!

101
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:10,114
- Up, up more...
- Shit.

102
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:24,120
Yeah, baby, yeah!

103
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,779
Go after him!

104
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,911
Oi!

105
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,580
- Whooo!
- Hey wait!

106
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:52,543
They'll never catch us. They're meat eaters.

107
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:54,708
Okay.

108
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,739
- What was one, Grant?
- What?

109
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:58,681
Um, get in unobserved.

110
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:00,647
Right. And what was two?

111
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,773
- Collect visual evidence.
- Right.

112
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,213
Three?

113
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:06,372
- Get out unobserved?
- Yeah.

114
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:07,705
And four?

115
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,713
Blow this whole fucking game wide open;

116
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,812
Take the bastard under and go down in history

117
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:13,972
as the two people with enough balls
to save this country

118
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:15,986
from genetically-engineered devastation!

119
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,345
No, Grant. Four was a have a meeting

120
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,744
about what to do next.

121
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,075
This is evidence, okay? It's evidence.

122
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:27,604
Actually, that's probably
highly-toxic genetic material.

123
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:29,111
Fuckin' A!

124
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:31,576
Fuckin' A. And it's mine.

125
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,406
Or, it's ours.

126
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,036
You and me, baby, all the way.

127
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:38,634
Yeah, Grant.

128
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:40,801
About the you and me bit...

129
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:44,366
Now I wonder if our relationship
hasn't kind of got...

130
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:46,966
Shh!

131
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,066
They're in here somewhere.

132
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:52,438
- Go!
- Grant, wait.

133
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,304
There he goes!

134
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:00,096
Oi!

135
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,865
Whoa!

136
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,104
Over there!

137
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:19,831
Where is he?

138
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,392
- Bugger!
- Oh fuck.

139
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,960
Right.

140
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:14,861
That's for me.

141
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:16,920
And that's for you.

142
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:19,259
It'll buy you a lot of therapy.

143
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,988
Well, there's not much around here

144
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,927
in the way of your cappuccino culture,

145
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,825
but I'm sure Mrs. Mac will do you a cup of tea

146
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:30,328
and an Anzac biscuit for the road.

147
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,988
That's it, then.

148
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:37,658
You got rid of all Dad's things.

149
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:40,057
Living in the past...

150
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:42,423
that's what's wrong with these bloody farmers.

151
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,789
You're now the owner
of the biggest farm in the district.

152
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:46,621
What does that make you?

153
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:49,284
Up here's where the smart farming's
done these days, Henry.

154
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,586
Is that what all that outside's in aid of?

155
00:15:56,158 --> 00:15:59,147
People are interested in
what I'm doing here, Henry.

156
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,986
It's a whole new approach to farming.

157
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:03,649
It's better for the animals,
better for the farmers,

158
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,747
better for the consumer.

159
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,120
It's an exciting time
to be in agricultural sciences.

160
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:14,215
And a profitable one.

161
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:39,615
More tea, Henry?

162
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:41,344
I think three's enough.

163
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:42,816
I should get going.

164
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:46,476
That's a pity. You'll miss my rabbit pie.

165
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:49,381
I'm making watercress for the Japanese.

166
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,384
Look, chopsticks.

167
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,882
He's quite the lord of the manor now, isn't he?

168
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,405
Uh...

169
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,438
Angus was throwing this away.

170
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:04,180
I know your father would have
wanted you to have it.

171
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:07,470
The Golden Shears.

172
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,980
Best shearer in the country

173
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:12,536
three years running.

174
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,671
Your father said you were a natural too.

175
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,836
I... I really can't see it on my coffee table.

176
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:23,471
You got what you came for then?

177
00:17:23,513 --> 00:17:25,977
Angus has got his deal.

178
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,575
Guess I'm done here.

179
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:33,373
I'm having the farm manager
take you for a run up to the top.

180
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:36,241
But I haven't been up there since the accident.

181
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:39,208
I know. That's why you're going.

182
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,172
Oh, here he is now.

183
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:47,800
- Kia ora, Auntie.
- Tucker.

184
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:52,058
Flash threads, bro.
So you a model now or something?

185
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,088
I'm doing I.T. Internet stuff.

186
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,360
Oh. Nude modeling.

187
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,092
And you're manager now?

188
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:02,121
Well, your brother's hardly
young farmer of the year, is he?

189
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:04,357
Angus seems to think
he's got a handle on things.

190
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:07,023
The only thing he's got a handle on is his...

191
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:19,221
Okay, farm boy, let's see your stuff.

192
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:21,454
Sure.

193
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,394
Okay.

194
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:26,652
Come on.

195
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:35,584
Yah!

196
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:43,014
What happened to you, darling?

197
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,218
Give us a hand, bro!

198
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:48,486
I... I just need to make a phone call.

199
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:49,854
Jesus, man.

200
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:51,880
Just gonna shove her back over the fence.

201
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:04,983
Hey!

202
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,781
- Hands up?
- Hands up!

203
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:25,679
It's okay. It's okay.

204
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,878
I'll protect you.

205
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,540
Grant!

206
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,173
Grant?

207
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,280
Is this gonna take long?
Because I've got a taxi waiting.

208
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:54,008
If you fascists have hurt him,

209
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:56,980
I will organize the biggest sit-in
this farm has ever seen.

210
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:02,209
Look, we don't know where your friend is, okay?

211
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,974
- Maybe my brother could help?
- Brother?

212
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,672
Angus Oldfield.

213
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:08,303
I should have known you were an Oldfield.

214
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,936
I can see it in your aura.

215
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,206
I think that was just something
he stepped in back there, eh?

216
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,643
- No, you have a very selfish aura.
- What?

217
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:16,906
How would you like a taste
of what you're dishing out?

218
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:19,035
Safety's on.

219
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,509
- What?
- The safety's on.

220
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:23,339
Just...

221
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:24,866
yeah, on the other side.

222
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,001
Back a bit.

223
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:28,872
And down.

224
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:30,773
Back and down. Up.

225
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,775
Here here, here.

226
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,031
Yeah.

227
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:39,507
There we go, here.

228
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,700
Yeah, right.

229
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:28,992
...they were like, looking around at us and...

230
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,464
What about me?

231
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,998
Can we give you a ride somewhere?

232
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,089
Maybe to the car so I can, um...

233
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:50,859
Organize your sit-in?

234
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:54,590
Wait for my... for Grant.

235
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,153
I'm Henry, this is Tucker. What's your name?

236
00:22:57,198 --> 00:23:00,062
- Experience.
- Has been so far.

237
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:03,125
So why were you going to shoot me, Experience?

238
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,628
Because this farm subjects innocent animals

239
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:07,958
to cruel and sadistic torture. Because...

240
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:10,825
Smoke.

241
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:28,691
- You coming?
- Um...

242
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,215
Mike?

243
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:49,779
Mike!

244
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,314
Oh my God.

245
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:03,015
What?

246
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:08,680
The feng shui in this room is terrible.

247
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,378
Anyone there?

248
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:19,178
Mike?

249
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:34,608
Oh God.

250
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:48,173
Jesus, man, it's not gonna bite.

251
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:50,942
- What's it doing?
- What is wrong with you?

252
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:54,912
- Ovinophobia, my therapist calls it.
- What's that?

253
00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:57,003
Just a completely unfounded and irrational fear

254
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:59,239
that one day this is gonna happen!

255
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:03,074
Well, this happens
when you run the most reckless

256
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:05,237
genetic engineering program
in the southern hemisphere.

257
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,245
- Who engineered that?
- Your brother.

258
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,238
Mike.

259
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,706
Come on then, muttonchops!

260
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:30,237
Bugger me.

261
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:42,966
Shoot it again!

262
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:50,497
That'll give you something
to talk to your therapist about.

263
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:53,992
Oh, I'm going to be sick!

264
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:16,990
Oh shit.

265
00:26:18,634 --> 00:26:20,826
Kia ora.

266
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:22,593
Kia ora, kia ora.

267
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:24,792
Rattle your dags, Henry!

268
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,360
There we go.

269
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:35,159
Good girls.

270
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:38,490
They're fine.

271
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,793
You get Henry. I'll start the car.

272
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,525
God, your chi is in shambles.

273
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:49,222
Huh?

274
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:51,525
Take a deep breath.

275
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,021
You need to ground yourself.

276
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:00,119
You're a tree.

277
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:04,985
Come on.

278
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:07,016
A tree.

279
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:10,822
Your taproot extends down into the earth.

280
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,381
My... my what?

281
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:15,052
That's your base chakra.

282
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,751
Feel the energy drawing out of the soil.

283
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:23,520
Can you feel it?

284
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,115
Yeah.

285
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:27,987
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:27:28,024 --> 00:27:30,853
Come on, Henry.

287
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,220
The energy flows up

288
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:34,552
into your navel chakra,

289
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,680
your solar plexus chakra,

290
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,915
into your heart chakra.

291
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:41,512
It spreads to your branches,

292
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:44,247
your twigs, your leaves.

293
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,481
You are a mighty kauri

294
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:48,350
commanding the forest.

295
00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:52,149
Look with your third eye.

296
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:56,987
Totally relaxed.

297
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,349
Get on the fucking truck!

298
00:28:01,386 --> 00:28:04,181
Nearly there, nearly there.

299
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,807
Go! Go go go!

300
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,509
Watch out for the sheep!

301
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,380
Shoot! Sorry.

302
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:23,705
What the hell's he doing?

303
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,178
Chainsaw.

304
00:28:49,745 --> 00:28:52,143
Is it turned on?

305
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:57,540
- Prime it, prime it!
- What?

306
00:28:57,577 --> 00:28:59,701
The pump thing.

307
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:18,498
Fuck!

308
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,762
Oi, Henry!

309
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,233
- Are you okay?
- If it weren't for my gumboot...

310
00:29:37,272 --> 00:29:38,499
Who's driving?

311
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,027
- Jump!
- What?

312
00:29:44,071 --> 00:29:46,468
Jump off, now!

313
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:48,595
Jump off! Ah!

314
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,994
Oh, shit.

315
00:30:19,365 --> 00:30:22,388
Wow, what a beautiful view.

316
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:27,225
- This is, uh, where...
- I know.

317
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:29,696
This is what?

318
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:32,594
Ooh, long way down.

319
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:35,558
I wouldn't want to fall off there.

320
00:30:35,597 --> 00:30:38,824
This is where my father fell to his death.

321
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:40,385
Oh.

322
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:42,190
Sorry...

323
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:44,218
to hear that.

324
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:46,853
Oh, a sheep!

325
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:48,883
Is that a good one or a bad one?

326
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:53,386
Oh, definitely bad.

327
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:56,359
That's not funny.
Animal flatulence is responsible

328
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:58,586
for almost half the world's
greenhouse gas emissions.

329
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:01,092
It's pure methane. The Kyoto Protocol...

330
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,751
Kyahhh!

331
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,717
What do we do?

332
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,725
Well, reducing carbon emission
from industries...

333
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,554
No, what do we do about raising the alarm?

334
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:14,421
My phone...

335
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,423
is in the truck.

336
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,013
Tucker, what do you think?

337
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:21,182
Hoof it for the house.
Tell his lordship what's going on.

338
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:22,746
Is it far?

339
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,415
It's rough terrain, open paddocks,
hot day, no cover.

340
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:26,751
Yeah, I'd say it's pretty far.

341
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:29,085
With about 50,000 sheep in between.

342
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:30,587
Then what?

343
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:33,644
Then I get as far away from here as I can.

344
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:36,882
You're still leaving?

345
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,512
I'm especially leaving.

346
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:43,746
Oh, what if the sheep get down there before us?

347
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:47,218
Then Angus is gonna have
some unexpected visitors.

348
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:19,478
Henry.

349
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:24,342
Well?

350
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:26,040
No sign of him.

351
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,012
The others have gone out into the paddocks.

352
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,542
You cannot make a cup of tea in this country

353
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,946
without some do-gooder starting a petition
to have you do it their way.

354
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,141
You help me in the lab.

355
00:32:39,178 --> 00:32:41,838
And you, get rid of that stuff.

356
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:13,740
Bloody animals.

357
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:59,259
You and your... your bloody 4-wheel drives.

358
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,528
Think you own the road!

359
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:08,162
I do, actually.

360
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,358
Angus Oldfield.

361
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,331
What hole did you crawl out of?

362
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:16,331
WEKA. The Whole Earth Kollective Aotearoa.

363
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:20,154
I know all about your Frankensheep!

364
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:23,856
Mother Nature spent
millions of years making sheep.

365
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,828
She doesn't need your help!

366
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,829
Don't talk to me about nature.

367
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:29,852
Man made sheep what they are today,

368
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:31,861
and I'm making them what they'll be tomorrow.

369
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,793
If I was a sheep,
I wouldn't be anywhere near you!

370
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:36,953
If you were a sheep, I'd have you ground up
for dog food, you little worm.

371
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,018
Now get the fuck off my land.

372
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,254
Ahh!

373
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,311
They might come from anywhere.

374
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:20,879
And they might not. Calm down, bro.

375
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:25,885
So this guy you're looking for,
is he your boyfriend?

376
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:27,887
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

377
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:30,012
- Is he your boyfriend?
- Grant's part of our collective.

378
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:32,417
We're a non-profit cooperative
that shares information

379
00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:34,477
and resources about environmental issues.

380
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,247
So what were you and your boyfriend
doing here today?

381
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:38,184
We keep hearing about some cowboy lab

382
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,276
that's flushing every animal research guideline
down the toilet.

383
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:43,409
Scum like Astrid Rush and your brother

384
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:45,281
need to answer to somebody sometime.

385
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:48,148
For someone who likes animals,
you don't like people very much, do you?

386
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:50,150
I would have thought that you of all people

387
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:51,912
would appreciate efforts to deconstruct

388
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:54,211
the colonialist paternalistic
agrarian hierarchy

389
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:56,478
that disenfranchises the Tangata Whenua

390
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:58,680
and erodes the natural resources of Aotearoa.

391
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:01,274
Learn all that at university, did ya,

392
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:03,111
before you dropped out?

393
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:05,740
I didn't drop out, thank you.
I just missed exams

394
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:08,577
while we were occupying a poultry farm.

395
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:10,275
Anyway, that's none of your business.

396
00:36:10,315 --> 00:36:13,337
Are you okay?

397
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,941
Rescue Remedy?

398
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,208
I don't need rescuing.
I need Dettol and a sticking plaster.

399
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:25,712
No thanks.

400
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:29,143
Fine, suit yourself.

401
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:32,372
Wait, we should stick together.

402
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:37,635
Tucker, I'm sorry.
It's my fault you got bitten.

403
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:40,404
Don't worry.

404
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,637
It'll be... oh fuck!

405
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:46,767
I'll get a tetanus shot when we get back.

406
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,742
- Clear it right up.
- But the sheep did that.

407
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,517
Then I'll get the vet to have a look at it.
It'll be fine.

408
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:58,603
Oh God. Here they come.

409
00:37:00,141 --> 00:37:01,936
- Don't wait for me!
- I'm not leaving you behind.

410
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:03,837
- What about the sheep?
- Well, fuck the sheep!

411
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:06,236
No time for that, bro! Go go go!

412
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:24,059
- In here.
- Not in there.

413
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:25,763
Why not? It's been here forever. It's empty.

414
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:28,565
- No it's not, bro.
- This is your brother's laboratory.

415
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:33,001
You got a better idea?

416
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:35,763
Go home. Get, go on!

417
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:39,628
Come on.

418
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,461
Did you know about this?

419
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:07,327
I just thought they were
playing with sperm or something.

420
00:38:26,728 --> 00:38:28,717
Oh God.

421
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,121
Stand back!

422
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,126
Do it.

423
00:38:43,926 --> 00:38:45,983
Tucker?

424
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:48,815
Jesus, Henry, are you gonna shoot me
if I end up like that?

425
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:54,714
- You're trespassing.
- Taihoa, Bo Peep.

426
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:01,147
What is this?

427
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,247
I told you. agricultural science.

428
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:06,312
This isn't science. The sheep are revolting.

429
00:39:06,356 --> 00:39:08,015
Aren't they?

430
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:11,216
- Now, Henry...
- Hey hey.

431
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:14,551
I'll take that as your resignation.

432
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:16,520
Angus, what would Dad say about all this?

433
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,112
He wouldn't say anything.
He'd be knee-deep in mud

434
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:20,848
with his hand up a sheep's ass.

435
00:39:20,888 --> 00:39:23,080
Your father was 10 times the farmer you are.

436
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,483
My father fell off a cliff
chasing a wool-blind ewe.

437
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:30,609
Angus, there's something wrong with the sheep.
They attacked us.

438
00:39:30,653 --> 00:39:32,141
Oh nonsense.

439
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:34,549
Your brother's clearly
one of these lunatic greenies.

440
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:37,779
Tucker, show them your foot.

441
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:41,279
Foot?

442
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:45,273
Henry, I simply won't allow you
to disrupt things today.

443
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:47,306
What are you going to do about it, eh?

444
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:52,315
Whatever I have to.

445
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,111
Angus, are you nuts?

446
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:56,206
There's a lot riding on this, Henry.
I told you,

447
00:39:56,249 --> 00:39:57,805
it's gonna be very profitable.

448
00:39:57,848 --> 00:40:00,337
Henry, get out of here. Do something!

449
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:02,370
Get out of here!

450
00:40:02,415 --> 00:40:05,210
- What?
- Move your ass!

451
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:07,713
Henry, come on!

452
00:40:10,746 --> 00:40:12,735
Stop!

453
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,434
This way!

454
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:50,138
In there!

455
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,162
Oh, what's down here?

456
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,128
Look at them, Angus!

457
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,897
Look at you.

458
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:22,232
The fifth generation farmer's son
who's scared of a few sheep.

459
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:24,361
You do need therapy.

460
00:41:24,404 --> 00:41:25,835
Ah!

461
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:31,168
There's no deal, Angus.

462
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:35,967
We have a contract, Henry. It's done.

463
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:37,933
Not with all this going on.

464
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:42,192
- Ah!
- Henry!

465
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,427
Help me!

466
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:46,694
Help me, Angus!

467
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:50,896
Angus!

468
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:54,158
I'm your brother!

469
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,955
That's the thing about farms, Henry,

470
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:00,793
accidents happen.

471
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:05,292
- Let me go.
- No. No.

472
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:22,923
Oh my God!

473
00:42:28,093 --> 00:42:31,525
- Are you okay?
- I'll never be okay ever again.

474
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:41,616
- What's that?
- Geranium...

475
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:45,920
aroma therapy for uplift and hormonal balance.

476
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:48,617
Do your hormones really need balancing?

477
00:42:48,658 --> 00:42:50,850
Considering I've been attacked

478
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,822
by genetically-engineered monsters,

479
00:42:52,857 --> 00:42:55,322
jumped off a moving vehicle,
been chased across a paddock,

480
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:58,686
dragged into a torture chamber,
pulled into a mountain of rotting flesh...

481
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:01,279
yes, my hormones need fucking balancing.

482
00:43:05,222 --> 00:43:08,847
- Working yet?
- Uplifting at any moment.

483
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,777
- Where are you going?
- There are caves near the woolshed.

484
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:21,717
If this is part of the same system,

485
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:24,184
we can walk right under the sheep.

486
00:43:25,718 --> 00:43:27,707
Right.

487
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:45,339
All he had to do was leave.

488
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:47,507
Why wouldn't he do that?

489
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:02,635
What happened to those idiots
I sent to collect you?

490
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:33,570
That looks... anomalous.

491
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:35,665
What it looks like

492
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:38,435
is the spontaneous cellular transferral

493
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:41,441
we've been trying to achieve for months.

494
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:44,270
Or possibly not so spontaneous.

495
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:45,655
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

496
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:48,196
He'll be out for a while.

497
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,035
Where's your brother and that girl?

498
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:52,402
Oh, don't worry. They're gone.

499
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,337
Well, I don't know what they're on about.

500
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:56,600
The sheep? Really.

501
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,105
There's too many people
running around here today.

502
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:01,543
One of those greenies bit me
on my way up the hill.

503
00:45:01,572 --> 00:45:03,265
- Bit you?
- Yeah.

504
00:45:03,305 --> 00:45:05,702
Looked like he hadn't bathed for months.

505
00:45:08,137 --> 00:45:10,261
Hm, you may need a shot.

506
00:45:10,303 --> 00:45:13,700
Well. I want this place secured.

507
00:45:13,736 --> 00:45:15,998
Yeah, I have something I need to observe here,

508
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:17,763
but I'll be down presently.

509
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,994
No. Stay here.

510
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:23,364
Stay here? I need to present my work.

511
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:26,129
Look, the last thing I need
is someone with your reputation

512
00:45:26,169 --> 00:45:28,157
prancing about the place.

513
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,291
Oh, my reputation didn't seem to bother you

514
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:33,060
when you needed someone
to kick-start this venture.

515
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,225
Or when you wanted to pursue

516
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:38,323
some personal interests.

517
00:45:39,932 --> 00:45:42,398
I was just coming up with solutions
that you hadn't thought of.

518
00:45:42,432 --> 00:45:44,455
Now I'll send someone up for the animal.

519
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:47,226
You lock this place down
and stay out of the way.

520
00:45:50,732 --> 00:45:52,629
What about that shot?

521
00:45:52,664 --> 00:45:55,755
Put a plaster on it. I'm sure you'll be fine.

522
00:45:58,463 --> 00:46:00,725
The amount of bad karma
your brother's generating,

523
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:03,194
he'll probably come back as a sheep.

524
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:06,195
I don't want to think about
what Angus has been doing.

525
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:08,626
Using your father's legacy as a testing ground

526
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:10,423
for vile experiments on animals.

527
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:13,222
Experience.

528
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:15,251
What was all that about a deal?

529
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,589
Huh?

530
00:46:16,627 --> 00:46:18,753
What are you here for today?

531
00:46:18,793 --> 00:46:21,224
I sold him my share of the farm.

532
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,021
I thought if I could come back here

533
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:26,456
and resolve things with him, I could move on.

534
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,617
But these are your roots.

535
00:46:38,907 --> 00:46:40,873
There's something in here.

536
00:46:40,907 --> 00:46:43,031
There can't be. Or they'd have to...

537
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:45,504
jump!

538
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,267
Come on!

539
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,660
Shit!

540
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:55,795
I have to get out of here!

541
00:47:02,537 --> 00:47:05,764
- Down here.
- No. No way.

542
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:07,735
If it's a way out, we're there.

543
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:10,257
If it's not, we're there forever.

544
00:47:13,402 --> 00:47:15,334
You go first!

545
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:21,567
It shouldn't be too far.

546
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:23,226
Keep moving.

547
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:28,555
I can't.

548
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,088
You can.

549
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:35,257
Look, you're a tree.

550
00:47:36,299 --> 00:47:39,196
- A tree.
- Feel your roots

551
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,992
- in the ground. Feel your, um...
- Chakra.

552
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:43,826
- ... chakra...
- My base chakra.

553
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,499
...drawing energy from the ground.

554
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:50,462
Okay, I feel it.

555
00:47:50,496 --> 00:47:53,394
There. You're relaxed.

556
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,622
I'm relaxed.

557
00:47:55,662 --> 00:47:58,957
Don't get too relaxed.

558
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:02,387
Go! Go!

559
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,052
- Hurry up!
- I'm hurrying!

560
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,887
- Don't stop!
- It's opening up!

561
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:26,156
I'm stuck!

562
00:49:18,651 --> 00:49:21,445
I was wrong about your aura.

563
00:49:21,483 --> 00:49:22,710
Really?

564
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,307
I said it was selfish, but...

565
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:28,179
now I think it was something you stepped in.

566
00:49:31,548 --> 00:49:33,411
This way.

567
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,238
"Address To A Haggis:"

568
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:42,837
Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,

569
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,608
Great chieftain o' the pudding-race!

570
00:49:45,647 --> 00:49:48,737
Aboon them a' ye take your place,

571
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,871
"Painch tripe or thairm."

572
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,067
Oh hello, dear.

573
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:56,668
Did you see Henry up the hill?

574
00:49:56,712 --> 00:49:58,200
Uh, no.

575
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,211
No, I think he's gone.

576
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:02,437
Oh? Really?

577
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:05,035
I thought he would have at least said goodbye.

578
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:07,043
Well...

579
00:50:07,077 --> 00:50:09,372
you can't tell what Henry will do,

580
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,933
can you?

581
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:18,700
It's all his bloody fault.

582
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:20,469
He had his money... good money.

583
00:50:20,509 --> 00:50:22,837
My money. That little baaa-stard.

584
00:50:30,973 --> 00:50:33,405
Up here.

585
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:53,067
This is how I remember it.

586
00:50:55,436 --> 00:50:57,425
It's beautiful.

587
00:51:01,636 --> 00:51:04,192
We'd better hurry.

588
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,664
What's that noise?

589
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:21,225
Somebody shearing.

590
00:52:00,894 --> 00:52:02,484
Hello?

591
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:21,091
Oh God, no.

592
00:52:31,655 --> 00:52:34,019
Grant?

593
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:41,748
Oh!

594
00:52:47,987 --> 00:52:50,475
What's happened to you?

595
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,242
Grant, it's me... Experience.

596
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:06,181
Hey!

597
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,207
Henry!

598
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:21,544
This way!

599
00:53:21,582 --> 00:53:23,070
Come on!

600
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:42,406
Round here.

601
00:53:45,113 --> 00:53:47,044
- He's coming!
- Come on.

602
00:53:57,643 --> 00:53:59,666
Oh shit!

603
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:07,441
Grant, what's that on your face?

604
00:54:07,475 --> 00:54:09,998
Is that blood?

605
00:54:12,908 --> 00:54:15,032
Have you been eating meat, Grant?

606
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:18,566
Was it even organic?

607
00:54:28,506 --> 00:54:31,960
So, that's your boyfriend?

608
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:34,027
I knew you liked animals,
but I didn't think you...

609
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:36,469
He's not my boyfriend.

610
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:38,901
Something must have bitten him.

611
00:54:38,937 --> 00:54:41,597
You mean...

612
00:54:41,637 --> 00:54:43,864
like Tucker?

613
00:54:51,436 --> 00:54:53,163
The amniotic fluid should work

614
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:56,259
as an attenuated vaccine on the mutated cells.

615
00:54:58,401 --> 00:54:59,867
What's going on?

616
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:04,534
- Tell me how you feel?
- Sore.

617
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:08,931
Itchy. My... my skin feels really tight.

618
00:55:08,966 --> 00:55:12,090
Go on.

619
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:15,586
No no no no no no no no. No, wait.

620
00:55:23,164 --> 00:55:26,289
All right, thanks very much.

621
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,558
Oh hello. Thanks for coming.

622
00:55:28,597 --> 00:55:29,926
Konnichiwa.

623
00:55:34,962 --> 00:55:36,791
We're about to kick off.

624
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:45,690
There's my girl.

625
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:22,686
Oh shit!

626
00:56:22,723 --> 00:56:25,752
Angus won't be selling much sheep
if he turns into one, will he?

627
00:56:25,756 --> 00:56:28,517
He might need that shot after all.

628
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,418
You're a very lucky young man,

629
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:37,546
to be witness to a new scientific frontier.

630
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:40,280
I have a small errand to attend to,

631
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,376
and then...

632
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:44,612
I think we might try
and replicate the effect on you

633
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:47,346
with some of these cultures I have.

634
00:56:47,386 --> 00:56:49,476
In the meantime,

635
00:56:49,518 --> 00:56:51,882
you rest up.

636
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:06,348
Konnichiwa, güten tag,

637
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,508
kia ora, g'day.

638
00:57:10,515 --> 00:57:13,777
This land was carved from virgin bush

639
00:57:13,815 --> 00:57:17,940
by my great-great grandfather more than...

640
00:57:20,147 --> 00:57:22,340
100 years ago.

641
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,868
My family have sowed their seed here
since that time.

642
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:27,971
But now...

643
00:57:28,014 --> 00:57:31,343
I have a dream for the future...

644
00:57:33,646 --> 00:57:36,578
a dream of sheep.

645
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,639
Oh.

646
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:02,334
The Merino, the Romney,

647
00:58:02,374 --> 00:58:04,364
the Drysdale.

648
00:58:08,873 --> 00:58:10,463
Excuse me.

649
00:58:16,273 --> 00:58:19,136
It's not far. It's just a quick trip

650
00:58:19,173 --> 00:58:21,105
through the trees.

651
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,988
These names are shared
in corners of the farm...

652
00:59:00,365 --> 00:59:03,490
These... these names are...

653
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:05,895
names...

654
00:59:10,064 --> 00:59:14,224
Well, time to meet
the star of our show, I suppose.

655
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:17,661
I give you the Oldfield.

656
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:27,754
It's beautiful.

657
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,916
Quiet down.

658
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:46,384
Ah, beautiful.

659
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:00,279
Quiet now. Quiet, my pretty.

660
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,444
Oh no.

661
01:00:36,552 --> 01:00:39,540
Perhaps it won't be that bad.

662
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:59,074
Easy! Easy!

663
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,376
Easy!

664
01:01:04,648 --> 01:01:07,737
Oh!

665
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:12,745
"Lo, on Mount Zion stood the lamb,

666
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,837
and with him, 144,000."

667
01:01:53,573 --> 01:01:56,266
But I'm a vegetarian!

668
01:01:56,307 --> 01:01:59,830
Was, was, was!

669
01:02:01,406 --> 01:02:05,202
"It is these who follow the lamb
wherever he goes,

670
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:08,363
for they are spotless!"

671
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:11,598
- Help me! Help me!
- Ew! Get off!

672
01:02:11,637 --> 01:02:13,899
Help me!

673
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:22,828
Take me up, O Lord! Take me...

674
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:30,366
Henry! Just in time for dinner!

675
01:02:33,769 --> 01:02:35,757
Oh my Lord!

676
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:37,562
Oh!

677
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,358
Yeah!

678
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:00,626
Easy, easy.

679
01:03:00,665 --> 01:03:02,596
That's my girl.

680
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:04,653
It's okay.

681
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,852
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

682
01:03:16,161 --> 01:03:19,991
There, it's... I know. It's okay, yes.

683
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:22,153
I know, it's okay.

684
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,055
Let's make that phone call.

685
01:03:35,092 --> 01:03:37,024
I think MAF, then WEKA.

686
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:38,389
Or WEKA then MAF.

687
01:03:38,426 --> 01:03:41,118
Someone must have
one of the other phones off the hook.

688
01:03:41,158 --> 01:03:43,522
Who else is in the...

689
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,554
- Your boyfriend's back.
- Jesus, Grant.

690
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,619
- Henry!
- Ow!

691
01:03:55,656 --> 01:03:58,054
My shotgun's in the pantry!

692
01:03:59,621 --> 01:04:03,019
Many's the meal I've made of wethers like you.

693
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:06,385
You don't scare me.

694
01:04:11,787 --> 01:04:14,344
What is that?

695
01:04:14,387 --> 01:04:18,046
My haggis!

696
01:04:21,052 --> 01:04:22,211
Shells!

697
01:04:37,784 --> 01:04:39,772
Shells!

698
01:05:05,545 --> 01:05:07,841
No!

699
01:05:21,311 --> 01:05:22,936
What did you do?

700
01:05:22,977 --> 01:05:25,135
Ling gui ba fa.

701
01:05:25,176 --> 01:05:27,733
- Huh?
- Acupuncture point.

702
01:05:27,776 --> 01:05:29,934
Causes temporary paralysis.

703
01:05:29,975 --> 01:05:32,407
Or coma if I did it wrong.

704
01:05:32,442 --> 01:05:33,805
Did you?

705
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:36,001
He fell down, didn't he?

706
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:12,467
We're safe.

707
01:06:12,503 --> 01:06:14,730
We're trapped.

708
01:06:14,769 --> 01:06:17,394
Let's make that call. Where's the other phone?

709
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:19,832
Uh, Angus's study.

710
01:06:23,502 --> 01:06:25,626
- Locked!
- Here we are.

711
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:37,089
You're alive.

712
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:42,165
I pulled it from the wall.

713
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:43,555
What?

714
01:06:43,598 --> 01:06:46,524
I thought, just keep a lid
on things till it all blows over.

715
01:06:46,564 --> 01:06:49,490
Business community don't receive
this kind of situation very well.

716
01:06:49,531 --> 01:06:52,326
They probably won't receive
being eaten very well eith...

717
01:06:53,564 --> 01:06:55,961
What are you doing in here?

718
01:06:57,363 --> 01:06:59,658
You wouldn't understand.

719
01:06:59,695 --> 01:07:03,821
I understand you've got a
pretty fucked up idea of animal husbandry.

720
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:10,887
I'm taking back the farm.

721
01:07:10,928 --> 01:07:12,553
Ah.

722
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:17,158
Golden boy thinks he can do better, does he?

723
01:07:17,194 --> 01:07:18,781
You wouldn't know where to start.

724
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:22,656
Jeez, Angus, I couldn't do any worse than you.

725
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:26,451
No, wait.

726
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:29,083
It's... one of us.

727
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:31,591
It's family.

728
01:07:31,626 --> 01:07:33,614
What?

729
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:35,680
That's how we made the advances...

730
01:07:35,724 --> 01:07:37,690
human DNA.

731
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,883
Mine.

732
01:07:39,924 --> 01:07:41,617
Ours.

733
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,054
You fucker.

734
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:46,318
Well, it was more of a sperm sample really.

735
01:07:46,357 --> 01:07:48,254
You wanker!

736
01:07:48,289 --> 01:07:50,584
Necessity's the mother of invention.

737
01:07:50,622 --> 01:07:52,281
You've been bitten.

738
01:07:52,321 --> 01:07:55,878
It's nothing. Just some hippy.

739
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:57,785
You'll become one of them!

740
01:07:57,822 --> 01:08:00,548
- A hippy?
- No, Angus, one of them.

741
01:08:00,587 --> 01:08:02,314
Only worse.

742
01:08:02,354 --> 01:08:04,377
What are you gonna do, Henry?

743
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,386
Kill me?

744
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,612
I'm your brother.

745
01:08:08,653 --> 01:08:11,244
They're almost in!

746
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:14,183
Upstairs, children!

747
01:08:14,218 --> 01:08:16,208
Well?

748
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:19,275
The sheep are breaking in.
They'll tear you to pieces.

749
01:08:19,318 --> 01:08:22,044
Oh, I don't think so.

750
01:08:22,084 --> 01:08:25,107
Henry, hurry!

751
01:08:30,216 --> 01:08:34,239
Goodbye, Angus.

752
01:08:48,214 --> 01:08:50,008
Henry!

753
01:08:50,046 --> 01:08:52,171
Come on, now!

754
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:20,668
There's another fire escape around the back.

755
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:23,266
We can take Mrs. Mac's car to town.

756
01:09:23,308 --> 01:09:24,830
Look.

757
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:27,931
Now where does he think he's going?

758
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:31,202
The barn. His plane.

759
01:09:31,241 --> 01:09:34,729
He can't leave if he's contaminated.
It could affect the whole country.

760
01:09:34,773 --> 01:09:37,171
You're hurt, dear.

761
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:38,934
Grant.

762
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:41,768
We don't know what will happen.

763
01:09:41,806 --> 01:09:44,533
- We've seen what happens!
- Stay calm.

764
01:09:44,572 --> 01:09:46,095
You're a tree.

765
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:49,593
I'm not a tree! I'm a fucking sheep.

766
01:09:49,639 --> 01:09:52,764
No, you're a man.

767
01:09:52,806 --> 01:09:55,601
And your father'd be proud of you.

768
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:12,199
Come on.

769
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:19,995
You two go. I'm staying here.

770
01:10:20,035 --> 01:10:21,830
What are you gonna do?

771
01:10:21,868 --> 01:10:23,958
I'm gonna stop Angus.

772
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,892
If you see me again, you might have to...

773
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,659
No.

774
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:55,858
I still smell, right?

775
01:10:55,896 --> 01:10:59,021
No, that's just your aura.

776
01:11:01,796 --> 01:11:03,727
How will you get across the lawn?

777
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:07,023
You don't have a hoof like Angus,
they'll tear you to bits.

778
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,416
I'll blend in.

779
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:35,179
I am a sheep. I am a sheep.

780
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:19,507
I am a sheep.

781
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:34,008
Wait. You go to town.

782
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:37,742
Show me how to use this and I'll stay here.

783
01:12:37,782 --> 01:12:40,247
Have you ever fired a gun before, dear?

784
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,372
Well...

785
01:12:42,415 --> 01:12:44,403
not as such.

786
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:48,106
Aim and squeeze, dearie.
That's all there is to it.

787
01:12:48,147 --> 01:12:50,578
Besides...

788
01:12:50,613 --> 01:12:52,602
I'll talk you through it.

789
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:03,574
You know, this hurts me more than it hurts you.

790
01:13:06,411 --> 01:13:08,467
We'll make a farm girl out of you yet.

791
01:13:37,606 --> 01:13:39,435
Come on.

792
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:42,064
Come on, darling.

793
01:15:29,356 --> 01:15:31,719
Angus?

794
01:16:02,518 --> 01:16:05,708
Stop, Angus! Look!

795
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,509
We could have run the farm together,

796
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:09,214
if you hadn't ruined everything!

797
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,909
If you hadn't tried to kill me!

798
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:13,074
Now it has to end.

799
01:17:28,173 --> 01:17:29,729
What?

800
01:17:48,069 --> 01:17:49,534
Come in.

801
01:17:51,402 --> 01:17:53,459
Speak up.

802
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:56,195
Hold him, boy.

803
01:17:56,235 --> 01:17:58,097
Hold him.

804
01:17:58,134 --> 01:18:00,032
Hold him, boy.

805
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,191
Get down. Get down.

806
01:18:06,634 --> 01:18:09,030
Hold him.

807
01:18:14,965 --> 01:18:17,692
Hold him, boy.

808
01:18:39,662 --> 01:18:41,093
What?

809
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:09,551
Tucker. You're okay?

810
01:19:10,724 --> 01:19:12,213
Oh!

811
01:19:29,455 --> 01:19:30,886
What is that?

812
01:19:30,921 --> 01:19:33,648
Just a little something I picked up in the lab.

813
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:36,139
Should clear up your worms.
Fix your fly strike too.

814
01:19:53,885 --> 01:19:55,907
Anyway, pull your finger out.

815
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:57,916
We've got work to do.

816
01:20:02,116 --> 01:20:04,673
Hold 'em, Dice. Hold 'em. Good dog.

817
01:20:12,581 --> 01:20:15,513
How much of that stuff is there?

818
01:20:15,548 --> 01:20:17,638
Not enough for all of them.

819
01:20:21,514 --> 01:20:23,742
Jeez!

820
01:20:28,045 --> 01:20:30,704
Angus, it's over.

821
01:20:30,745 --> 01:20:34,007
No, this is just the beginning.

822
01:20:35,012 --> 01:20:36,238
Come back!

823
01:20:38,345 --> 01:20:39,901
My babies.

824
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:42,875
Have me again.

825
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:19,895
Methane.

826
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:30,064
Get in behind!

827
01:21:55,867 --> 01:21:56,991
Last one.

828
01:21:57,032 --> 01:21:58,998
There's a nice bit of wool on that, actually.

829
01:21:59,032 --> 01:22:01,930
- Reckon we should hang onto this one?
- He's a bit toey, but...

830
01:22:01,966 --> 01:22:03,261
Could make good eating.

831
01:22:10,564 --> 01:22:12,757
This is for you.

832
01:22:16,763 --> 01:22:18,853
What do you reckon, boss?

833
01:22:18,896 --> 01:22:21,089
Organic farming?

834
01:22:24,363 --> 01:22:26,624
Nothing but trouble, this modern stuff.

835
01:22:26,662 --> 01:22:29,643
Better just to stick with the way
we've always done things, eh?

836
01:22:34,028 --> 01:22:37,425
I've eaten a rabbit.

837
01:22:40,594 --> 01:22:42,821
Blanket, dear?

838
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:45,985
Let's see how we go, eh?

839
01:22:52,126 --> 01:22:53,613
Snack?

840
01:22:53,657 --> 01:22:56,180
- What are they?
- Mountain oysters.

841
01:22:56,225 --> 01:22:58,623
Well, I do eat a bit of seafood.

842
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,488
No.

843
01:23:03,523 --> 01:23:05,490
Mm, it's good.

844
01:23:05,524 --> 01:23:07,819
Of course it is, dear.

845
01:23:12,789 --> 01:23:15,653
You know you're eating
sheep's balls, don't you?

846
01:23:17,821 --> 01:23:19,286
Don't waste it.

847
01:23:23,221 --> 01:23:25,709
They'll grow on you.

848
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,809
What is happening here?

849
01:23:30,853 --> 01:23:34,123
No seriously, you could have an
organic compost heap. Or a worm farm.
