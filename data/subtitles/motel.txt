THE EMPTY HOURS



Sebas! I'm glad you made it.



What's up. Uncle Gerry?



- How are your mother and sister?
- They're well, thanks



I asked you to come here because
I need someone I can trust,



to look after my place.



It will be a good experience for you.



and you'll earn a bit of money



In that case. I'm all for it



All this shit with the medica
check ups and lab tests



is going to take a couple of weeks



Maybe more, maybe less,
it depends on what the doctors say.



Don't you worry Uncle.
I'll stay as long as it takes.



I left everything
settled in Jalapa anyway.



That's great, son.



The clothes lines are here



and the laundry sink is there.



Room number 9,
where my truck is, is not for rent



Why not?



It's full of paint cans,
cement and other stuff



I was fixing up the motel a bit.



but it will have to wait
because of this medical stuff



When I get back, I'm going
to change some roof tiles



and add some over here



I'm going to pull out some diseased palms
and paint the place.



I must get it looking ship-shape.



This is the linen cupboard,



where cleaning products are also kept



You have to keep it locked
or things get lost.



Lucha. The laundrywoman,
never notifies when she'll be coming,



but she is very dependable.



Does she do the cleaning?



No. She only washes and irons.



I had to fire the maid a few days ago



The night-watchman said
he would find someone else



If she doesn't come today.
you'll have to do the cleaning yourself



- I'm here to look after the motel
- Look...



to manage a hotel.
you have to do a bit of everything



It will only be for a few days.



The rooms are a very similar.



Change the sheets and towels each time.



And make sure that there is always
a box of paper handkerchiefs by the bed



Ok



This little drum is for beers.



sodas, condoms or whatever they need



You put the stuff out here



and turn it. So you don't bother them.



The most important thing
in this business is discretion.



Don't worry.



Well. Sebas...



I'm leaving you in charge of my motel.



- Don't fool around too much...
- No, of course not



Do be careful,



there's some crazy dudes round here



I can look after myself



Really, son,



the situation is rough.



- Let me know how things are going.
- Sure



Yes, Sir.



They are single story houses.



They have two bedrooms, a dining
room area with an open kitchen



It's a compound with nine houses



with a shared swimming pool



They also have access to the beach.



Yes, they are very nice



Very nice.



Why don't you come to see them?



Yes.



I'll show you the house
and explain our financing options.



Yes?



Perfect



Hold on



Coconuts?



What'll you have, dude?



This one.



That one?



Hold on. Dude, I'll put a straw in



Here's a ten



Do you have any change?



haven't got any.



Better take another one



No. One is enough



What'll we do then? Don't have change.



Let's flip a coin.



If you win I'll give you
the coconut for free



But if I win I get to keep the change.



Oh yeah?



Hold on



All set. Dude.



Do come back.



The key?



I'm sorry



What?
Are we going to flip that coin or not?



You're on



- What?
- You flip it



Heads



Tough luck!



It's heads



It's tails, my friend



Tails? No way



- It's tails
- Don't cheat



Me? I'm playing fair.



- You're playing fair?
- Yes



Come on.



What's your name?



Jacinto



At your service



- How old are you?
- Twelve.



- See you
- I'll be back for my other coconut.



Yes, bye



- Good afternoon!
- Hello.



I'm sorry but this room is not available.



But the porch is vacant



True, but it isn't fit for rent.



So, what do we do now?



- We can do it right here
- No way.



- You're so boring!
- It's not that



The rest are all available



Is that one next door vacant?



Room 10, yes it is.



That one then



I'll bring your key straight away. Sorry.



I like this place



What?



I like this little motel.



It has charm.



It's very different from the last one



Didn't you like the last one?



Not really.



It was quite decadent



And what about the smell...



Yuck Don't remind me!



Well. If you want
we could meet at your work



It's a bit far for me but.



No



I've already said I don't want that.



You're right.



The truth is this place isn't bad at all.



Simple. No luxuries.



but worth it



And it's very discreet.



Far from everything.



Maybe this way
we could meet more often?



Miranda. Don't start



I'm just saying it
because nobody knows you here.



I'm going to shower.



Miranda? Are the towels out there?



I can't see any here



No



Reception.



I'll bring them in a moment



Yes.



Better pass them through here.



- Sorry. The maid didn't show today
- Don't worry, thanks.



Here are the towels.



Are you ready, Miranda?



I'll take you out for seafood



- Hi
- Good afternoon



- Mr Severino?
- Yes



I am Sebastian, Gerardo's nephew.



Pleased to meet you



- Can I help you?
- No thanks, I'll take care of it.



Feeling hungry?



A bit, yes.



- It looks as though it might rain
- Yes.



As the song says, 'It looks like rain,



the sky is turning grey.'



- Is that your dog?
- Yes



- What's its name?
- Bodoque



- I'll be inside. If you need anything...
- Alright



I'll call you if I need something.



Thank you.



Come here, Bodo



- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.



- The motel seems quite full tonight.
- Yes



After partying in Tecolutla,
they came here. So it filled up



It's not full every day but it's full now.



Look



my uncle said that you
were going to find a new maid



- Didn't she come?
- No



wonder what happened.



But...



don't worry, she'll come tomorrow.



Could we find someone else?
I need someone urgently



Melinda will come tomorrow



- Make sure that she does
- Don't worry



- Enjoy.
- Thank you.



Santa Lucia Condominiums.



Good morning Sir, how are you?



Well



I have a client interested
in house number 3.



No... number 4



Yes.



He said that he'd let me know this week



I would be delighted too!



I've advertised all over the place



But things are slow.



People lack funds
and banks are making it very difficult.



Yes, of course.



No. I gave my word



I gave my word and won't leave
until the condo is sold



Don't worry.



Even if I have to stay another two months.



Hello?



Are we on for today?



I called you several times.



Yes. I know that being
a manager and family man



Leaves you with little time
for other things



Just kidding



Can you make it?



Are you sure?



We can leave it for another day...



So we'll meet over there directly?



At 2 o'clock. As usual?



Look at you!



You must be young Sebastian



- Lucha?
- At your service



Have you been here long?



I arrived a little while ago
but I didn't want to bother you



Did you notice anything strange?



Strange in what way?



Like people trying to get into the rooms.



Don't worry young man.



nothing ever happens here.



Well. I'll be at the reception
if you need me



Alright



- Excuse me
- Bye.



Hello?



Hello?



What's up. Uncle Gerry?



What?



Hello?



I can barely hear you.



Hello?



Can you hear me better?



Can you hear me?



Hello?



Ok. I can hear you over here.



No. Wait



Hello?



Yes, I hear you now



What's up?



Hello?



What's up. Man?



I'm back



- How did it go, son?
- Good.



I've got to go now.



- Have you ironed everything?
- Just left some sheets.



It looks like rain,
could you bring them in later?



Yes, I'll take care of it.



I'm off then, bye.



Lucha?



Could you help me out
until I can find a new maid?



No. I can't.



I only come here
as a favor to Mr Gerardo.



I work full-time at another hotel
so don't have the time



- It would just be for a few days.
- Honestly, I can't.



But I'll see if I can find you
a reliable hardworking girl.



- Please do.
- Don't worry. I'll find you one



Good afternoon.



Thanks



No. Leave it open



so my partner can see I'm already here.



Thanks



Sorry to bother you.



Fetching the sheets. It started to pour



You can wait here
There's no point in getting wet.



Aren't you too young to be working here?



It's my uncle's motel.



He had to leave so I'm replacing him.



Just for a few days, until he gets back.



That's very bold of him,



leaving you here alone
when you're so young.



Maybe



but I'm not all that young...



You can't be over 16. Right?



I'm turning 18 in three months



I almost got it.



So, what's it like here?



- What?
- Here



Boring



There isn't much to do.



You must find out all sorts of stuff...



I'd rather not meddle.



But you must wonder
who the people who come here are.



Like those guys over there



I bet he's a young guy from around here.



Well. He did look young



About 21 or 22?



More or less.



I bet it's his first time in a motel



He didn't look like a first-timer.



Really?



The plot thickens.



- The girl looked...
- Don't tell me that



Better tell me



what car they drive.



They were riding a motorbike



A small motorbike



That makes it easier



she's a hooker he picked up.



No?



Don't tell me they're engaged!



How disappointing!



I didn't expect them to be so banal



So what?



So ordinary



So boring



They didn't look
as though they were bored



Not while their passion lasts,
but that is temporary



Look. A ray of sunshine.



Excuse me.



Hello?



What's up. Mom?



What?



I can barely hear you.



Hold on. Don't hang up.



Any news of my uncle?



You don't say...



Calm down. Mom...



You know what my uncle's like



And what did the doctors say?



So when are they going
to do the new lab tests?



What's up with the maid?



She hasn't come.



I'll try to get another one tomorrow



Because Ms Melinda didn't show.



You've been saying that
since the other day!



It's hard to find someone
who is reliable and trustworthy



- You already said that
- Yes.



My uncle asked you...



I'm doing the cleaning myself...



- Tough luck
- What do you mean?



- Nothing can be done
- What do you mean?



Well. There just isn't anybody
who is reliable and trustworthy



You were asked
to take care of it days ago!



I know, I'm telling you!



You're telling me?



I'll be right back.



The building is over 300 ft2



plus another 100 ft2 of private garden,



not to mention the swimming pool
and the beach access



I truly believe it's one
of the best deals in the area.



The master bedroom.



which also has two built-in double beds.



Over there



is a large and comfortable bathroom.
you can go in.



And this is the kitchen



There's quite a large space
for a pantry over here.



It is very versatile.



you can adapt it to your needs



The open plan
is very practical and functional,



and gives the house a very nice touch.



The whole house is going to smell of food



MAID WANTED

Hi, Mario



I just wanted to say

Wait a moment

He must be a well off cattle rancher.

Yes, to the rancher.



And he brought his secretary...



25 years old



Ranchers don't have secretaries.



But you got the age right



Some table dancer?



No?



I give up.



Let's say they have a lot in common.



Then she's his wife. No?



Or girlfriend, or lover.



That's right...



but they have something specific.



What do you mean?



You've lost me.



I'll make it easy



they play for the other team



They're gay!



You got it



Here's your prize



Thanks

- No, go ahead



My name's Miranda. What's yours?



Sebastian Ramirez Novoa, at your service.



Pleased to meet you. Mr. Ramirez Novoa.



Are you from round here?



No. I'm from Jalapa



A girlfriend?



I'm so nosy, aren't?



Since you're in on other peoples' privacy,



it seemed ok to ask you.
but you don't have to answer...



No. Don't worry.



Well. I do have a friend. But...



she isn't my girlfriend



So you just kiss and stuff?



Yes.



But she left



Why?



Because she met another guy



You were too slow...



Find another one then!



Love comes and goes.



Right



How about you?



Me?



My thing isn't at all serious



I missed the marriage train



To be honest.
I was never looking for that.



It's difficult in my line of work.



I travel a lot



I'm like a sailor.



a man in every port



It's better that way



I get the good part



the compliments. The fun



I don't get the jealousy
or the routine or the complaints.



Do you see him often?



Enough



I'm sorry. Didn't mean to pry



No. Don't worry.



What bothers me is his lack of.



He can never be on time



I've been waiting for him for an hour



I always have to wait.



The king of waiting. I'm going to my room.



Hello?



Hello?



Hello?



Mario?



Hello?



Where are you?



And why didn't you let me know earlier?



I've been waiting for you
for over an hour!



Do you recall that I cancelled
an appointment to see you?



No, I'm an idiot because I knew
you were going to do this to me.



Tonight?



Come off it, Mario.



No. I've got tons of things to do.



Are you sure you can make it?



What about Silvia?



No. You know what? I can't



I'm busy too



It's on the house.



- No way.
- Please



Ok



Thanks



Another margarita?



- Ok.
- Coming up



Thanks



Open!



Fucking Mario!



- Good evening.
- Good evening. Miss



Please follow me



I'm not here for a room



I came to see the young man



- Young Sebastian?
- Yes.



I'll let him know



Thank you.



I thought there would be
more clients at night.



It depends on the day.



But they are definitely ouder at night.



I can imagine.



Hey...



what about going out for some fun?



- Right now?
- Sure!



I know a place that has a great vibes.



It's on me.



Cheers.



- Let's dance
- No.



Come on.



- Please.
- No. I don't dance.



You should ask those pretty young girls



I'm sure they would be delighted.

- No.



Go on. Ask them.

I love you. Mario

and the laundry is just beyond



The motel has ten rooms.
They're all similar.



- We clean them as soon as they're vacant
- Ok



I'll show you one of the rooms



You always have to change
the sheets and towels



Put the soiled ones in the storage room



Lucha takes care of washing and ironing.



What else?



Always leave
paper handkerchiefs next to the bed.



I'll show you where
the cleaning products are.



If you run out, I'll buy more



- Any questions?
- No. Sir



The most important thing, Maria.



is to be very discreet with the clients



Alright. Sir, don't worry



Here. Sir.



I found this on the floor



- Where?
- Room number 10.



- Thank you
- You're welcome, Sir.



Hey...



have you worked in a motel before?



No



Don't worry, it's very simple.



Hardly anyone comes here anyway.



The only trouble is when clients are drunk



and they make a mess in the rooms



And there's also the groups
that come in to have orgies



They leave a lot of work for us!



I'll be right back.



I've come to apologize



I'm so embarrassed
I don't know what came over me.



I even ruined your date.



It wasn't anything



Of course it was



Did you get her phone number?



I think it would have worked out well.



I got really wasted,



I even lost my phone.



Thanks a lot!



I was so worried. I have many
important contacts and I didn't...



What?



Look. A mermaid



That stain up there,



looks ike a mermaid.



No



It looks more like...



an iguana, doesn't it?



An iguana?



No way.



An iguana and a mermaid
have nothing in common.



I can't see the mermaid



Come on.



Come over here to look at it



Come on.



Look



Up there, see?



In the corner



No?



Down there, see it?



That thing



is the fish tail.



Then above



that's her hair



And those two spots are her tits



Got it now?



If that's a mermaid then I'm...



What?



A handsome stud like...



What? An iguana?



Don't you have to get that?



No. The maid can go.



It doesn't sound as though she's going



Well. Have to get going anyway.



Hello?



Maria? This is Sebastian,
from the Palma Real Motel



Are you coming in today? You're late



Why? You and I had reached an agreement



Just tell your husband
it's a job like any other



I'm not shouting at you, I'm just saying



Hello?



Shit!



How's tricks?



Why are you running off?



How much will you give me?



One peso for each one



Oh yeah?



Better give me every
third coconut you bring down.



- Yes or no?
- Ok.



Watch your head. Dude.



Send them down.



Come on, I'll catch them down here



These are enough to set up my stand



What can I do for you?



We're here to deliver mattresses.



- I didn't order anything
- Look



The purchase was made



by Mr Gerardo Novoa Sanchez



about a month ago.



Address for delivery Palma Real Motel.



on KM 7 4 of the Nautla-Poza Rica road



- Let me make a quick call
- Ok.



How's it going?



Move it, move it



And the old mattresses?



Ok



Ok. Don't worry.



When wil the operation be over?



Sign here. Please.



Right here



Thanks



Here's your invoice.



All set



Bye. Thanks.



- And the mattresses?
- We put them back there



Good afternoon.



I saw you were looking for a maid.



So I came in.



Yes. Yes I am...



There are 10 rooms...



well 9 actually.



They're all the same
So there isn't much to do.



I've just received new mattresses,
that's why it's such a mess.



- Can I help you?
- No, don't worry



Why not? Come on



Ok. Thanks.



Careful, it's a bit heavy



- Thanks
- You're welcome.



- I'll show you the rest of the motel.
- Ok.



- After you
- Thanks



This is the reception.



And that's the storage room
with the cleaning products



My name is Sebastian



I'm in charge of my uncle's motel.



- What's your name?
