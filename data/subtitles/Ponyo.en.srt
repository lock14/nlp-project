A goldfish!

24
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,940

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,980

It looks
kind of dead.

It's alive!

Sosuke,
I'm starting the car now!

- [bubbling]
- [waves moaning]

39
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,260

found my daughter?

[moaning]

41
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,780
What? She was
captured by a human?

42
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,220
A boy!
This is very bad.

43
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,020
Is it already dead?

44
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,460
You are alive!

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620

46
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,020
Sosuke, I have a job, you know!

47
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,940
Look, mom,
I found a goldfish!

48
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,660
- A goldfish?
- It was right down
by the rocks.

49
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,980
- Yeah?
- [metal squeaking]

50
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,060

I don't know
who you are,

53
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,220
But we don't use
weed killer around here.

54
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,980
Hm? What? This is
not weed killer.

55
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,820
This is the
purest ocean water,

56
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,220
And it keeps me
from drying out on land.

57
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,300
Whatever. As long
as it's not weed killer.

58
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,340
- Excuse us.
- [man] please wait.

59
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,060
Uh-oh.

60
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,300
This is bad.
This is very bad.

[engine revving]

62
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,180
Wow. That Guy
was a freak show.

63
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,740
But don't you call
people "freak show."

64
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
We never judge others
by their looks.

65
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,340
I know, mom.
I don't.

66
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,540
Oh. Another experiment
for school?

67
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,420
- Mm-hm.
- Your teacher doesn't
really like show and tell.

68
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,740
I think it'll be fine.

69
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,700
Don't worry, I'll take
good care of you.

70
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,740
Huh!
She sure is pretty.

71
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,740
There's a ship
headed for dry dock.

72
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,220
Hurry up.

73
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,260
[woman] eat your breakfast.

74
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,020
I wonder if
she would eat this.

75
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,100
[Sosuke] want some?

76
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,780
Hey! My cut
is all gone!

77
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,140
Mom, I think
I'll call her Ponyo.

78
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,180
- Mmm?
- She came to me.

79
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,940
She might be magic.

80
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,580
[Sosuke] I saved her.
She's my responsibility now.

81
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,660
Want ham instead?

82
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,380
Mom, Ponyo really
likes to eat ham.

83
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,020
So she thinks
she's human?

84
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,140
Ouch!

85
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,540
[grunts]

86
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,020
Whoa! Turn!

87
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,260
Humans are disgusting!

88
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,980
Come on, Lisa, hurry!

89
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,460
[man] all this waste, filth.

90
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,260
[Lisa] morning, shima-san!

91
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,620
Ponyo, look.
You can see our house.

92
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,020
- Ask about the fish.
- I will.

93
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,060
- Love you, Sosuke.
- [Sosuke] goodbye.

94
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,380
Morning! Seems like
I'm always late.

95
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,860
- Can you get me
another wheelchair?
- [Lisa] sure.

96
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,940
- Good morning, Sosuke.
- Excuse me.

97
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,860
- I'm in a big hurry, Yoshie.
- Is that so?

98
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,140
- And me, Sosuke?
- Not now, Toki.
I'm concentrating.

99
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,180
Ah...

100
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,380
[engine starts]

101
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,140
Maybe the teacher
will get mad.

102
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,020
I got it.

103
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,660
You'll be safe here, Ponyo.
I'll be back soon.

104
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,020
Hm. I wonder if there
are any cats around here.

105
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,820
That should do it, Ponyo.
Stay put. I'll be right back.

106
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,740
- See you later.
- Hello there, Toshi.

107
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,260
[woman] I'll call if
her cough gets worse,
but she looks fine.

108
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,780
- You good, little sweetie?
- Oh, thank you. Good.

109
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,740
- Bye-bye.
- Good morning, sensei.

110
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,780
- [woman] good morning, Sosuke.
- [woman 2] hi, Sosuke.

111
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,620
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko!

112
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,980
Look at me! My mother
made me a new dress.

113
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,020
- Isn't it pretty?
- Hm...

114
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,100
Hey, Sosuke,
let's go play.

115
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,900
Can't now.
I'm busy.

116
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,740
You're not busy.
You're five.

117
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,340
- I am too! I have a job.
- You're so weird.

118
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,620
Yeah. Hm!

119
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,620
Oh!

120
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,420
Ponyo?

121
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,260
Ponyo!

122
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
[sniffling]

123
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,140
- [girl] Sosuke!
- [gasps]

124
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,260
- Oh, Kumiko.
- What is that?

125
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,100
There are rules about bringing
things to school for a reason.

126
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,780
I know.
This isn't school.

127
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,140
These bushes are on
the senior center property.

128
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,900
Let me see!

129
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,300
- Oh, a goldfish?
- She's not just a goldfish.
She's Ponyo.

130
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,580
Ponyo? Let's see!

131
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,860
- [Sosuke] ok, but don't
tell she's here.
- [Kumiko] I won't.

132
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,020
The rules are:
Look but don't touch.

133
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,020
Look at her.
Isn't she pretty?

134
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,260
That's the most
boring goldfish

135
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,540
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

136
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,260
[screaming]

137
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,340
[gasps]

138
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,300
[sobbing]

139
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,060
That one was
Kumiko’s fault.

140
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,780
You should never
judge others by their looks.

141
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,140
Let's get you
some more water.

142
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,220
[straining]

143
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,460
Ponyo!

144
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,980
Ah! [laughs]
that was my fault.

145
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,340
[giggling]

146
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,460
[Yoshie]
there it comes again.

147
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,540
I hear old
Sosuke’s voice.

148
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,580
But I know our boy
is in school right now.

149
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,740
[laughs] so it must
be only in my head.

150
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,980
Look, Yoshie.
I'm right over here.

151
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,740
Oh, that's a relief.

152
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,100
[Yoshie] I haven't
lost my mind quite yet.

153
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,260
Are you ready
to see my big surprise?

154
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,100
- What is it?
- I'll show you.

155
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,780
But first,
guess what color she is.

156
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,900
- Hm... She... She's red!
- Red!

157
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,380
That's right!

158
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,820
- How did you both guess that?
- [Noriko] come on, show us!

159
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,580
Ok.

160
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,740
- Well, look!
- Very pretty.

161
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,060
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes to eat ham.

162
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,540
- And she can do magic!
- [Yoshie gasps]

163
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,940
I got a cut
on my thumb,

164
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,860
And it went away
because she licked it.

165
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,820
[both] oh!

166
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,580
Maybe she could use some of her
magic to fix my hips and back.

167
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,020
I'd let a fish lick me

168
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,460
If it'd get me
out of this wheelchair.

169
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Well, I don't know
about all that licking.

170
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,780
- I'd have to ask Ponyo...
- Let me have a look
in that green pail.

171
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,180
Yes, Toki-san.

172
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,220
[shrieking]
it has a real face on it!

173
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,380
Hurry up! Put it
back in the ocean.

174
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,820
Don't you realize
it'll cause a tsunami?

175
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,740
Oh, you. It's always tsunami,
day and night.

176
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,500
Fish with faces who come out
of the sea cause tsunamis.

177
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,540
[Toki] that's what
they always say.

178
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,540
[shrieking] tsunami!
Tsunami! It's here!

179
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,820
Ah! Oh! Sosuke, put her back
in the ocean where she belongs!

180
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,060
[gasps]

181
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,900
Toki, what's the matter?

182
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,260
I'm soaking wet.
Look at my clothes!

183
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,460
[Lisa shouting] Sosuke!

184
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,940
Sosuke!

185
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Sosuke!

186
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,660
Sosuke!

187
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,340
Come back here
and apologize!

188
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,860
[sighs]

189
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,740
Don't worry, Ponyo. No matter
what, I will protect you.

190
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,300
[Sosuke] I promise.

191
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,820
Sosuke!

192
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,380
[gasps]

193
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,540
Sosuke!

194
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,220
[gasping, laughing]

195
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,700
Ponyo!

196
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,420
Ponyo. Sosuke.

197
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,740
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

198
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,820
I will love you, too.

199
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,500
- Ponyo loves Sosuke!
- [laughing]

200
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,460
[gasps]

201
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,900
[waves moaning]

202
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,700
Ponyo?

203
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,780
Ponyo!

204
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,460
Ponyo! Ponyo!

205
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,740
Ponyo!

206
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,060
Ah! Ponyo! Ponyo!

207
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,420
- [Sosuke shouting] Ponyo!
- Sosuke!

208
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,820
[Sosuke] Ponyo! Ponyo!

209
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,740
Ponyo!

210
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,500
Ponyo!

211
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,420
Ponyo!

212
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,780
[Sosuke sobbing]

213
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,900
[continues sobbing]

214
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,780
Listen, Sosuke, you know,
this could be for the best.

215
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,300
I know you tried,
but Ponyo is a fish.

216
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,780
[Lisa] she wasn't meant
to live in a bucket.

217
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,660
The ocean is home to her.

218
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,220
Anyway, let's get home.

219
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,620
Hopefully,
that spritzing weirdo is gone.

220
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,300
Whoo!

221
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,100
Can I have a lick?

222
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,940
Hurry, it's
starting to melt.

223
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,260
Dad's favorite. Me, too!

224
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,540
I'm really sorry, Sosuke.

225
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,340
But dad is finally
coming home tonight.

226
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,060
[Lisa] you can tell him
all about Ponyo.

227
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,340
- No more ocean today, ok?
- [Sosuke] mm-hm.

228
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,700
- [window opening]
- [Lisa] Sosuke?

229
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,780
Sosuke? Time to
come in now.

230
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,700
Maybe if I
leave the pail,

231
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,340
Ponyo will know where we live
when she comes back.

232
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,700
Do that. I think that's
a lovely thing to do for Ponyo.

233
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,540
Mm-hm.

234
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,980
[phone rings]

235
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,900
Sosuke, can you get that?

236
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,380
- It must be your dad.
- [ringing continues]

237
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,940
Hello? Yep.
She's fine.

238
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,260
<i>- [Sosuke] are you at the dock?
- [man] I caught a second run,</i>

239
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,260
<i>So I have to take it.
  I won't be home tonight.</i>

240
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,020
<i>I'll signal you when we pass.
  Can you help me out with mom?</i>

241
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,620
No, you should
tell her.

242
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,060
[Lisa] hi, honey.
Uh-huh.

243
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,700
What?! Too many
in a row, Koichi!

244
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,020
Let someone
else take it!

245
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,540
Go ahead, abandon
your wife and child

246
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,140
Up here on a cliff
all alone.

247
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,020
Oh, jerk!

248
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,060
Uh! Come on, Sosuke.
Let's get out of here.

249
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,900
What if Ponyo
comes back?

250
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,740
Mm!

251
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,660
Ah!

252
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,020
There's dad.
Turn off the lights, mom.

253
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,660
- Don't you wanna signal him?
- Mm-mm.

254
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,780
Hey, my son is working
the signal all by himself!

255
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,900
- Can you believe that?
- Your wife must be pretty mad.

256
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,740
[Sosuke] s... O... R...

257
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,060
...R... Y.

258
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,060
- Dad says he's very sorry.
- B-u-g...

259
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,420
- [Lisa] o-f-f.
- B...

260
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,580
[Lisa] b-u-g o-f-f.
B-u-g o-f-f.

261
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,740
Mom, dad says
he loves you.

262
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,980
[Sosuke] he says,
"lots and lots."

263
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Wow! Nice, dad!

264
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,300
[Sosuke] don't cry, mom.

265
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,020
I know dad breaks
his promises sometimes.

266
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,260
But he does
his best for us.

267
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,100
I promised Ponyo
I'd take care of her.

268
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,020
Then I lost her.

269
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,700
I wonder if she's
crying now.

270
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,580
- Ah!
- You are so good! Mmm!

271
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,460
[both laughing]

272
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,020
<i> %%  happy as can be  %% </i>

273
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,620
- Mm! Ah!
- Don't you worry, Sosuke.

274
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,300
You did your best
and Ponyo will be just fine.

275
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,500
- Ok.
- [chuckles]

276
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,660
[Lisa] I say we start with
dessert and go backwards!

277
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,180
It's been a
backwards kind of day.

278
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,420
[man] it's not your fault.

279
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,700
I exposed you to the magic and
you're too young to understand.

280
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,740
I have to keep
the sea in balance.

281
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,860
It's a great
responsibility.

282
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,820
You must
promise me something:

283
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,420
You will never
go back to the surface. Yes?

284
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,420
Come on, now.
Eat, Brunhilde.

285
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,260
I want ham!

286
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,460
Ham! You ate their food.
What else did you do?

287
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,100
Did you taste blood, Brunhilde?

288
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,740
My name is not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.

289
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,220
- Ponyo?
- Ponyo! Ponyo loves Sosuke!

290
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,260
I will be a human, too!

291
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,340
Human? What do you know
about humans, Brunhilde?

292
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,860
They spoil the sea.

293
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,380
[man] they treat your home
like their empty, black souls.

294
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,660
I was once, long ago,
a human myself.

295
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,940
I had to leave that all behind
to serve the earth.

296
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,940
Hands! I want hands!

297
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,660
I don't want
these flippers anymore!

298
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,220
[Ponyo] I want feet,
like Sosuke!

299
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,100
- That's enough!
- [straining]

300
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,580
[squeaking]

301
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,420
[straining] ah!

302
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,260
Oh!

303
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,060
[all squeaking]

304
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,100
[straining]

305
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,540
I made hands!
I made feet, too! Ha!

306
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,100
- Yes!
- What? No, no!

307
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,500
Don't tell me.
You have tasted human blood!

308
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,180
I'm going to Sosuke!

309
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,100
Enough! You're making
a terrible mistake!

310
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,780
Don't do it! Stop it.
Stop it! Stop changing now.

311
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,420
Revert. Revert.
Revert! Revert!

312
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,820
- [moaning]
- revert!

313
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,500
[straining] stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it!

314
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,500
- Don't change!
- [Ponyo straining]

315
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,500
- [Ponyo grunting]
- I need more power!

316
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,780
[Ponyo] let me out!
Let me out!

317
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,740
[grunting]
let me out!

318
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,460
I want to see Sosuke!
Let me go!

319
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:07,100
- Let me out!
- You can't be human and magic
at the same time, sweetheart.

320
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,060
Be still, be still,
be still, be still, be still.

321
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,900
[all chattering]

322
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,740
[sighs] she's already
so powerful.

323
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,540
Just like her mother.

324
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,220
[man] if you could only remain
innocent and pure forever.

325
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,180
[all chattering, squeaking]

326
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,820
I don't have the power
to hold her for very long.

327
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,100
I need to ask
for her mother's help now.

328
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,340
I... What?

329
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,620
Huh! They're headed
for my elixirs.

330
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,300
Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here! Shoo!

331
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,460
That was too close.

332
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,820
I must be careful not to
upset the balance of nature.

333
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,660
Calm. I must remain calm.

334
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,540
When I think of
leaving her again,
my heart won't stop pounding.

335
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,820
Right, then.
Focus on work.

336
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,540
This batch should be ready.

337
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,260
At least there
aren't leaks down here.

338
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,620
This door still
doesn't fit right.

339
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,540
I'll fix that next.

340
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,620
If even one living creature
got in here...

341
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,260
Ah, yes. I can feel
the power of the ocean

342
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,140
In the furthest
reaches of my DNA.

343
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,940
When this well is full,

344
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,860
Then the age of the ocean
will begin again.

345
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,780
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian age.

346
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,140
An end to the era
of those abominable humans.

347
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,540
[man grunting]
this cursed door!

348
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,740

[kissing]

352
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,180
Teeth!

353
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,220
[all chattering]

354
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,140
Let's find Sosuke!

355
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,900
[creaking]

356
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,860
[all shouting]

357
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,340
I'm free!

358
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,820
- Waterspout!
- Captain, look over there!

359
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,780
- [man] it must be a tsunami!
- [Koichi] turn the ship
into the wave!

360
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,740
Look! What is that?

361
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,580
[man] captain, all our
instruments just went dead!

362
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,300
It's a little girl. Looks
like she's about Sosuke’s age.

363
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,980
- Thanks again.
- Sure. See you tomorrow.

364
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,500
It's raining
so hard, Sosuke.

365
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,460
I'll call your mother
and have her pick you up.

366
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,380
That's all right. I'll take
the shortcut. Goodbye, sensei.

367
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Bye, Sosuke.
Be careful out there.

368
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,740
Sosuke, I'm sorry.

369
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,580
The door didn't open, right?
The power just went out.

370
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,380
- Everything ok at school?
- Mm-hm.

371
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,860
Lisa, if your shift's over,
you can go home.

372
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,340
Sure you don't
need my help?

373
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,980
[woman] don't worry.
We'll be fine.

374
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,660
A little rain Storm
keeps the seniors entertained.

375
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,060
If I were you, I'd get out
of here while you still can.

376
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,380
Wait here, sweetie.
I'll be right back.

377
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,900
Ok.

378
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,820
Hi, Yoshie.

379
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,420
Oh, Sosuke.
Is that you?

380
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,460
It's so dark
I can barely see.

381
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,180
Here, Yoshie.
I made this for you.

382
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,980
Oh! What do we have here?

383
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,660
There's one for you,
too, Noriko.

384
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,420
Thank you, Sosuke.

385
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,100
I can't see a thing. I don't
know why we're still here.

386
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,220
It's just a little rain.
I wanna go back to my own house.

387
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,980
There we go.
That's more like it.

388
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,780
Let's see.
Your goldfish!

389
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,940
I bet the lights came back on
because Sosuke’s here.

390
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,940
<i>They're now calling the bizarre
event a micro-typhoon.</i>

391
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,620
<i>Ship... [static]</i>

392
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,500
Ah, this stupid TV.

393
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,780
Nobody understands
weather anymore.

394
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,340
Might as well look at shadows
and listen to crickets.

395
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,420
You should take
your mother home now.

396
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,380
With our lucky goldfish
to keep us company,

397
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,180
- We'll be just fine.
- Ok.

398
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,620
<i>[man on TV] ...Landslides,
  flooding and tidal surges.</i>

<i>People trying
  to evacuate...</i>

400
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,060
This is for you, Toki.

401
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,340
I can't tell. What is it?
It's wrinkled.

402
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,580
It goes like this.

403
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,980
I got it.
It's a grasshopper.

404
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,980
<i>No, it's the
Koganei maru.</i>

405
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,940
That's the name of your
father's ship, isn't it Sosuke?

406
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,100
- Mm-hm.
- Now, it looks
like a party hat.

407
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,380
Sosuke, we've gotta
get on the road.

408
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,180
Let's hurry now
and say goodbye.

409
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,260
Ok. Ladies,
good evening.

410
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,900
[both] good evening,
Mr. Sosuke.

411
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,420
Be careful the wind
doesn't blow you away.

412
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,060
Let's go. Slide in.

413
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,420
They said the phones
are out, too.

414
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,860
The ocean looks
all puffed up.

415
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,140
You think the Storm
could sink the ships?

416
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,780
No. Ships can handle a Storm.
They go out to sea.

417
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,700
That's what your father's
doing right now.

418
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,620
[yelping]

419
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,020
I saw a fish!
Did you see that, mom?

420
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,220
Put your seatbelt on!

421
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,740
Hold on, Lisa!
You can't cross here!

422
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,500
We've just gotten word. They're
gonna evacuate this side.

423
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,900
It's not mandatory.

424
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,740
There are some people
up at the senior center.

425
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,020
You should get them out.

426
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,780
They're fine.
They're on the leeward side.

427
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,020
You need to go back
and seek shelter there.

428
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,140
Ok. But right now,
I need to get home.

429
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,820
- Well, you can't cross here.
- Take the mountain road.

430
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,540
- Hold on, kiddo.
- Mm!

431
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,220
No! Stop! Don't do it!

432
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,420
Watch out! Here it comes!

433
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,740
Lisa, you gotta
get out of here!

434
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,180
- [Lisa] hold on.
- [engine revving]

435
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,460
The fish are
following us now!

436
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,140
[Lisa] turn around.
Sit down.

437
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,420
Ah!

438
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,380
Ah!

439
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,740
Try to hang on
to something!

440
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,020
[yelling]

441
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,420
That wave
is just after us.

442
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,540
- Mom, the little girl
just fell in!
- What?

443
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,260
She was running
on a fish and she fell!

444
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,740
Where?

445
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,700
I've never seen
the ocean like this.

446
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,980
Sosuke, where did
you see a little girl?

447
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,500
She was out there,
running on top of a huge fish!

448
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,980
[Lisa] that's impossible.

449
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,580
Sosuke, we have to go!

450
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,380
[screaming]

451
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,940
[grunting]

452
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,860
It's ok. There was no
little girl out there.

453
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,020
We're almost home.

454
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,780
[gasps]

455
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,980
There is a little girl.
Come over here!

456
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,060
We'll help you!
Come here!

457
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,180
Stay there, Sosuke.

458
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,260
[gasping]

459
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,860
What?

460
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,420
Sosuke, do you know her?

461
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,300
- Ponyo?
- Mm-hm! It's me, Ponyo!

462
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,580
- It is you!
- [laughs]

463
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:03,140
Mom! Ponyo came back
and she's a little girl now!

464
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,860
Who?

465
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,780
[all shouting, laughing]

466
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,020
I found Sosuke!

467
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:38,100
All right. Sosuke, Ponyo,
life is mysterious and amazing.

468
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,780
But we have work
to do now.

469
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,420
And I need both of you
to stay calm.

470
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,180
Me, too.

471
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,500
You can take off
your rain coat now, Sosuke.

472
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,300
I've got a job for you, Ponyo.
Will you hold the light?

473
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:59,180
- Huh?
- Stay here,
and I'll go get a towel.

474
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,580
- [turns on radio]
- [flipping stations]

475
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,180
[turns off radio]

476
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,100
- Here, this way!
- [laughs]

477
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,900
- [laughs]
- smells like you in here!

478
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,700
- Ow!
- Ponyo!

479
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,300
- Oof!
- There, got ya.

480
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,380
Now, let's rub you down
and dry you off.

481
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,060
[mumbling]

482
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:40,140
Look at that pretty red hair.
It's almost dry.

483
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,180
- Huh!
- Huh?

484
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,740
[Lisa] and your clothes
are dry.

485
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,580
That's because Ponyo
was a fish, mom.

486
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:50,780
- Water can't make her wet.
- Mm-hm.

487
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,340
I really
like this thing.

488
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,700
So let's calm ourselves down
with a hot drink.

489
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,380
Ponyo, will you hold
the light for me?

490
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,420
- [Ponyo] coming!
- Ok.

491
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,300
- Who wants to bet
the water is working?
- I do!

492
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,500
I do!

493
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,180
- Water!
- Water! [laughs]

494
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,020
We have our own water tank
outside in the yard.

495
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,340
And who thinks
the stove will light?

496
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,060
And light!
All right.

497
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,180
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.

498
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,180
- Ok. Let's all sit
at the table.
- [both] ok!

499
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,860
Ponyo, the table's
over here.

500
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,460
Now, sit down like this.

501
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,140
Now, put your stuff down.

502
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,660
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!

503
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,180
Look at that!

504
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,780
Uh... What are
you guys doing?

505
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,940
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.

506
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,740
[Lisa] here you go.

507
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,260
It's hot.

508
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,700
This is the best.

509
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,100
Mm!

510
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,780

[hiccups]

515
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,700
Hm...

516
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,220
[sighs] that hit the spot.

517
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,380
So, what would the two of you
like to do now?

518
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,020
Ponyo wants ham!

519
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,380
All she thinks
about is ham, mom.

520
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,860
I better
make some dinner then.

521
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,900
First, we should start the
generator so we can call Koichi.

522
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:37,260
That's my dad. We need power
to talk to him on the radio.

523
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,620
He's out at sea right now,
but he'll be fine.

524
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,740
- Is he a naval wizard?
- No, of course not.

525
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,980
[Sosuke] he's the
captain of a ship.

526
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,340
So, Ponyo,
what's your dad like?

527
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,780
He hates humans!
He keeps me in a bubble!

528
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,260
- Huh?
- So I swam away from home.

529
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,820
Huh?

530
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,540
So, what's your
mother like then?

531
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,180
She's big and beautiful!

532
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,220
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.

533
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,460
[laughing]

534
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,660
Ponyo, over here, please.

535
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,980
[Lisa grunting]

536
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,180
Mm! [sighs]

537
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,780
Looks like something must have
gone wrong with the fuel line.

538
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,980
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.

539
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,060
It's clogged over there.

540
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,380
[straining, bell chimes]

541
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,620
- [gasps]
- [engine starts]

542
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:53,420
- It's on!
- It's light now! Yeah!

543
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,540
Ponyo, you're amazing.

544
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,220
- Antenna, antenna!
- Hey, mom.

545
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,300
Did all the ships
out there sink?

546
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,780
I don't see any
lights out there.

547
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,540
All right.

548
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,860
[static on radio]

549
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,740
[feedback]

550
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,620
- Too loud!
- What's wrong?

551
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,020
I can't get any reception.
That's really weird.

552
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,260
Transmitting from JA4LL.
JA4LL.

553
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,740
<i>[Lisa on radio]
  come in, Koichi.</i>

554
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,340
<i>This is Lisa,
  Sosuke and Ponyo.</i>

555
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,980
<i>We wanted you to know
  that we're all doing fine.</i>

556
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,620
I'm taking care
of everyone, dad!

557
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,820
Ham!

558
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,860
[laughs]

559
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,180
Got your noodles
all ready?

560
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,860
Be careful.
It's really hot.

561
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,260
You have to
wait a little bit.

562
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,780
It takes
three minutes.

563
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,380
[Lisa] ok,
close your eyes.

564
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,900
Keep 'em shut.

565
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,900
- Ponyo, uh! No peeking!
- [gasps]

566
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,620
Get ready to look now.

567
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:04,220
- Abracadabra!
- [shouting]

568
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,220
[Ponyo] mm!

569
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,140
- It's ham!
- Careful, it's hot.

570
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,620
Oh! [yelping]
hot, hot, hot!

571
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,140
Mm...

572
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,540
[moaning]

573
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,940
Mom, Ponyo fell asleep.

574
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,700
Do you think Ponyo
came from far, far away?

575
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,980
Yeah, I do.

576
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,460
[Lisa] look outside. It looks
like the waves have calmed down.

577
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,100
Maybe because Ponyo
fell asleep.

578
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,340
Do you see that light?

579
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,580
It's moving. There must be
somebody still over there.

580
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,780
That's the senior center.

581
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,420
- I don't see it now.
- Did they evacuate?

582
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,540
[Lisa] I'm worried
about the seniors.

583
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,620
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, ok?

584
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,660
I've gotta go help them.

585
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,020
I can get there if I
take the mountain road.

586
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,140
Sosuke, I should
go to the senior center.

587
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,540
I'm coming, too.

588
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,540
I'd feel better
if you stay up here.

589
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,180
But why can't I come? We'll wake
up Ponyo and take her with us.

590
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,300
I wanna
go with you!

591
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,820
Sosuke, right now, our house
is a beacon in the Storm.

592
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,220
Our light can be seen by
the town and by the ships,

593
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,020
And every place
else is dark.

594
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,940
You know I need to
help the old people.

595
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,900
So I'm going to
leave you here in charge.

596
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,500
You'll do the right thing.
I know it.

597
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,820
[Lisa] you have to be
the man of the house tonight.

598
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,140
Let Ponyo sleep,
wait for me.

599
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,700
You're only five,
but you're very smart.

600
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,660
Sometimes, we take a leap.
Be brave.

601
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,300
You can do it,
and I'll be back.

602
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,780
Promise?

603
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,980
- I promise.
- You promised.

604
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,540
I love you, Sosuke.

605
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,180
[orchestral music plays]

606
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:12,620
[snoring]

607
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,340
Captain, I can see the lights
of a city up ahead.

608
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,340
Finally, we can get
our bearings again.

609
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,140
We're someplace
I've never seen before.

610
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,020
[man] did the Storm
blow us to china?

611
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,260
What mountains are those?
I have no idea where we are.

612
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,580
[Koichi] that is
a huge wall of water.

613
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,020
Why is the Moon so close?

614
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,620
Hm...

615
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,580
That's no mountain
we're looking at.

616
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,340
And that's
no town, either.

617
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,060
Those lights are ships.

618
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,460
[Koichi] the Moon is so close,

619
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,420
Its gravity is forcing
the ocean to rise.

620
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,140
- What's going on here?
- [rumbling]

621
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,900
[gasping]

622
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,100
- The engine stopped!
- Try to hold her steady.

623
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,100
- Arai, drop the sea anchor.
- Yes, sir.

624
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,260
Something's coming this way.

625
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,780
[men shouting]

626
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,380
I just saw
the goddess of mercy!

627
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,700
Ah!

628
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,060
- The engine's working.
- It was her.

629
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,140
So you saw her, too? I thought
maybe I was hallucinating.

630
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,940
Thank you for protecting us...
[prays indistinctly]

631
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,620
- Higher, higher.
- [moaning]

632
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,780
Huh?!

633
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,940
[gasps] that has
a powerful spell on it.

634
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,100
How has she learned
to do something like that?

635
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,860
What? I can't
believe it! No!

636
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,620
She's turned into a human!
Whoa! Hold still!

637
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,860
- You... What are you doing?
- [giggling sound]

638
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:59,300
- [man] hold still!
- [squeaking, giggling]

639
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:02,100
Girls! Girls... Whoa!

640
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,820
[man] stop, stop! Please!

641
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,140
Stop now! No! Stop! Ah!

642
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,420
[man] respect your father!

643
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,740
This was serious.
I'm trying to save your sister.

644
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,260
[squeaking]

645
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,780
At last, she has finally come.

646
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:04,220
- Fujimoto.
- It's been a
long time, my love.

647
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,900
Look at my ocean.

648
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,180
Something has changed.

649
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:14,900
It's like my ancient Devonian
sea, full of magic and power.

650
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,300
You're going to be
very upset, my dear.

651
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:20,700
Ponyo got into my elixirs,
and she has tasted human blood.

652
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:25,340
Ponyo? What a lovely name.

653
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,060
Hm.

654
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:32,020
Of course, it's all
my fault, really.

655
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,860
She's become so powerful

656
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:37,140
That she's opened a hole
in the fabric of reality.

657
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:39,700
She's too young to understand,
and she wouldn't listen to me.

658
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,020
She's now a little girl.
And she loves a little boy.

659
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,220
And the whole world
is out of balance.

660
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:49,460
Please, please,
remove the human in her,
or the planet is doomed.

661
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,020
Huh? [gasps]

662
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,900
Already the earth is pulling
satellites from the Sky.

663
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,340
And the Moon
pulls the sea closer...

664
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,260
Be calm, dear.

665
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:17,020
Sosuke.
The boy's name is Sosuke.

666
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,660
[squeaking]

667
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:23,900
We love your sister,
and we all want her to be happy.

668
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:30,940
Listen, my darling, why don't we
let Ponyo become human for good?

669
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:33,940
We must test the boy.
If Sosuke’s love is true,

670
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,100
Ponyo will be
permanently transformed

671
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,020
And the balance
of nature will be restored.

672
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:42,380
But if his love isn't real, then
Ponyo will turn into sea foam.

673
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:46,260
True. That is where
we all originated, my darling.

674
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,420
The boy is so young,
so innocent.

675
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,740
- What does...?
- Shh.

676
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,500
[woman] let them sleep.

677
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,420
They'll need their rest.

678
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,420
Sosuke!

679
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:16,540
- Sosuke!
- [both grunting]

680
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:20,780
Ponyo, you ok?

681
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,900
Good morning, Sosuke.

682
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,140
Huh?

683
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,780
Look at that.
The ocean is at our door.

684
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,940
How come your
mom's not here?

685
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,260
The water's so high.
She must be stuck.

686
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,460
Too bad we don't
have a boat.

687
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,540
There's a boat,
right there!

688
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,500
- It's a little small.
- No, it's not.

689
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:17,220
[blowing]

690
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,140
Ah!

691
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,660
Uh! Huh?

692
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,340
Thank you!

693
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,780
Wow! You even made
the candle bigger.

694
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,180
- We can fit!
- This is fantastic.

695
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,740
- Fantastic!
- You take that end, please.

696
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,020
Ok!

697
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,700
- Ready?
- Let's go!

698
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,420
[grunts] whoa!

699
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,380
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

700
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:49,220
Ah!

701
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,940
It actually floats!

702
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,820
[laughing]

703
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,020
Doesn't look like
it has any leaks.

704
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,260
Now, we have
to fill the boiler.

705
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,460
The water gets sucked in
through this pipe.

706
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,180
Then it gets heated up
here in this round thing.

707
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,700
[inhaling]

708
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:24,060
[panting, inhales]

709
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,980
[giggling]
well, that worked.

710
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,820
[Ponyo laughing]

711
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,460
Looks like
everything's shipshape.

712
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,380
- Shipshape!
- Yep.

713
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,740
- Shipshape! [laughs]
- shipshape.

714
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:54,060
Shipshape! Shipshape!
Shipshape! Shipshape!

715
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,260
Shipshape!

716
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,860
What's that? [gasps]

717
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,620
- Ow!
- Ow!

718
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,740
- Look at that!
- It's burning.

719
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:33,020
It's hot! It's hot!
It's hot! It's hot!

720
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,820
- Is it working?
- Hm...

721
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,340
It's working!

722
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,100
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?

723
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,380
- Yep.
- This is a good boat.

724
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,380
Mm-hm.

725
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,060
Ah!

726
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,460
- Hey, Sosuke! Look at me!
- Mm-hm.

727
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,260
- Hey, this is even more fun!
- Mm-hm.

728
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,900
[laughs] that thing
makes my nose hot.

729
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,260
Ponyo, you be
the boat's lookout.

730
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:22,460
- And I'll do the steering, ok?
- Mm-hm. I'm the lookout!

731
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:51,580
- There's the road.
- That's the road my mom
took last night.

732
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,820
- I don't see her anywhere.
- We'll see her.

733
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,020
She promised me
she'd come back.

734
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,980
Those are ancient fish. They
lived during the Devonian age.

735
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:10,820
I know that one.
It's Bothriocephalus.

736
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,060
- And that one is...
- Dipnorhynchus.

737
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,980
Dipnorhynchus!

738
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,420
Wow! That one's
really huge!

739
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,420
- That's Devonynchus!
- Devonynchus!

740
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:32,100
[man] ahoy!

741
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,980
[woman] ahoy!

742
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,620
- [man] ahoy...
- Whoa, there's a boat!

743
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,300
[woman] ahoy!

744
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,940
I'm gonna say that.

745
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,980
Ahoy!

746
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,140
Ow!

747
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,980
Whoa, that's fast!

748
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,220
- Hey!
- I'm getting the hang of this.

749
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,380
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.

750
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,100
- [spitting]
- [coughing]

751
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,260
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.

752
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,180
Hey, that is quite
a boat you got there.

753
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,140
I've seen you before. You're
Lisa's little boy, aren't you?

754
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,940
He's not a little boy.
He's Sosuke!

755
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:20,220
She's Ponyo.

756
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,660
And I used to be
a fish.

757
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,980
Is that right? [giggles]

758
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,780
I like your name, Ponyo.
It's cute.

759
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,900
Mm-hm.

760
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,220
By the way,
have you seen my mom?

761
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,580
Your mother? Why isn't
your mother with you?

762
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,500
- She went to the senior center.
- Wow, way up there?

763
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:39,220
My baby likes you.

764
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,260
[cooing]

765
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:09,580
- [fussing]
- oh, sweetheart.

766
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,900
[crying]

767
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,220
Oh, is that for us?

768
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,900
Can I have the cup?

769
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:40,460
Well, thank you.
It smells good.

770
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,220
- [crying]
- wow, that's good soup.
Thanks.

771
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:50,260
- My mom made it from scratch.
- The soup's for him!

772
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:53,780
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's a little too young.

773
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,900
He can only drink milk
at this age.

774
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:57,540
But I could eat
the soup instead,

775
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,740
And it would help me
to make milk for him.

776
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,540
Huh?

777
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,060
Yeah, my mom
made milk for me, too.

778
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:08,460
Ponyo, what do you say? Is it
all right if I eat the soup?

779
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,860
- That's fine.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

780
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:14,620
- [Sosuke] huh?
- [chanting]

781
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:18,140
[chanting]

782
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:31,380
People from the town!
It's just like a parade!

783
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,220
Ahoy! Are any of you in need
of assistance at this time?

784
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:41,300
We're all good here! But thanks
for checking on us, captain!

785
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,420
[man] we are taking everyone
to the mountain peak hotel!

786
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,140
For your safety,
we request that you follow us!

787
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,740
Aye, aye! Will do!

788
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,220
- [Sosuke] looks like
the whole town is here.
- I don't see your mom.

789
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,220
- I hope she's ok.
- Ponyo, time for us
to cast off.

790
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,380
Hold on a second.

791
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:08,820
- Here, have some milk.
- Oh. Uh...

792
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,140
It's for milk.

793
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,500
She already ate all the ham
off those sandwiches.

794
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:15,380
Thank you. That's very
generous of you, Ponyo.

795
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,260
Sosuke, here.

796
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,220
I brought you the
biggest candle I have.

797
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,140
Thanks. Ponyo
will make it bigger.

798
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,740
- See you later.
- Take care.

799
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,940
Be careful.

800
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,700
- [crying]
- oh! What's the matter?

801
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:41,620
[woman] shh, shh, shh.
You have a cold.

802
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,700
[gasps]

803
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,420
[crying]

804
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,740
[cooing]

805
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,420
Ponyo!

806
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:06,060
[Ponyo laughing]

807
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:08,740
- [baby laughs]
- [mother laughs]

808
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,460
[Sosuke] hey,
are you guys ok?

809
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:14,940
[woman] hey, Sosuke.

810
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,860
- What are you doing out here?
- Sosuke, where's your mother?

811
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,860
[Sosuke] she went to the
senior center last night!

812
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,060
We're on our way
to find her!

813
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:24,260
You know, I still can't
believe Lisa beat that wave.

814
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,700
- That's Lisa.
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?

815
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,740
I can't. I'm busy.
I have a job to do now.

816
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:34,100
[man] check the park. The
seniors should be there by now.

817
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,540
- [man 2] good luck, kid!
- [woman] you'll find her!

818
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,220
We'll send a boat
for the seniors

819
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,740
As soon as we
drop this group off!

820
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:44,540
- Good luck, captain!
- [chanting]

821
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,500
[cawing]

822
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:33,020
Ponyo, our candle
is just about out.

823
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:39,940
We'll be ok. The fisherman
gave me another one.

824
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:43,140
Ow! It's still
pretty hot.

825
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:50,220
Bye-bye.

826
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:53,300
Here, Ponyo.
Can you make this bigger?

827
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,180
All right.

828
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,100
Hey, are you ok?

829
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,700
Hm?

830
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,100
- [Sosuke] Ponyo.
- Hm?

831
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,180
[grunts]

832
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,980
Ponyo. Ponyo!

833
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:32,380
[snoring]

834
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,660
Oh, good.
I can walk from here.

835
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,180
There's the road.

836
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,540
[Sosuke grunts]

837
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,420
[gasps] it's shrinking!

838
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,780
Ponyo!

839
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,700
Ponyo!

840
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:32,900
Ponyo, wake up!

841
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,460
Sosuke.

842
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:41,340
[yawns]

843
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,260
You scared me.

844
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,260
Don't turn into a fish again.
I'd miss you.

845
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,060
[gasps]

846
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:02,460
My mom's car! Ponyo, come on!
She might be there!

847
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,780
Hey, mom! Mom!

848
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,260
Mommy!

849
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,220
Mommy!

850
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,900
Mom!

851
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,100
Mommy!

852
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,460
Mom!

853
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:35,780
Mom!

854
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,420
Here, I've got your boat.

855
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:08,100
There's water
coming from your eyes.

856
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,620
- Let's go find your mom.
- Mm-hm.

857
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,740
[laughter]

858
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,580
- [Noriko] it's so beautiful!
- You forgot your cane!

859
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:07,060
Look, here comes
a whale again!

860
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,620
I think he sees us.

861
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,580
The other side
is nice, isn't it?

862
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,500
- And my knees don't hurt.
- This is the other side?

863
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:16,820
- Where do you think
we are, Las Vegas?
- [laughter]

864
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:21,860
- It's like a dream.
- Ladies, can we
gather around, please?

865
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:25,300
- [all] coming!
- Why don't we run?

866
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,060
Come on!

867
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,820
- It's so nice to run.
- Beat you there!

868
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,180
[women laughing]

869
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,140
Winner!

870
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,940
Everyone, quiet, please.

871
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:45,900
The time has come
for you to bear witness

872
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:48,460
To a sacred test of love.

873
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,860
- Oh, how exciting!
- Are they too young for this?

874
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:54,180
- Are we too old?
- When are they coming?

875
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,860
Please, ladies,
the children are coming now.

876
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,700
And remember, this is
a very important moment.

877
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,980
[man] a crucial moment.

878
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,420
Fujimoto, you
won't let any harm

879
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,340
Come to Sosuke
or Ponyo, will you?

880
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:09,940
[woman] it's not
in his nature.

881
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,580
Of course I wouldn't.

882
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:15,900
My hope is Ponyo will
stay asleep. Excuse me.

883
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:26,580
Do you think
we can trust him?

884
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,980
I wonder what Lisa
is thinking.

885
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:30,420
She's with
that woman,

886
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:33,700
And they've been talking
all night and day.

887
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,900
Poor Lisa.
Must be hard on her.

888
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:46,700
I wish we could hear
what they're talking about.

889
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:49,180
Oh, why don't we
just ask. Lisa!

890
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:52,340
[all] Lisa!

891
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,900
[all] Lisa!

892
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:01,540
We wanna know what
you're talking about!

893
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:02,780
Come tell us!

894
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:18,500
- My dear!
- Lisa!

895
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,620
What's going on?

896
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,020
Lisa, are you sure
you can trust that man?

897
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,220
It's so exciting.

898
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,180
Tell us what's going
to happen next.

899
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,860
Whatever happens, I'm just
glad you're all here for this.

900
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:30,700
- It's going to be fine.
- [all chattering]

901
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,300
I think I've
been here before.

902
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:58,660
Ponyo?

903
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,820
Don't like this place.

904
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,820
Don't let go
of my hand.

905
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,460
Mm...

906
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,060
[rattling]

907
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,580

908
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,780
Ponyo!

909

[snoring]

910
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,420
Ponyo!

911
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,420
Ponyo!

912
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,660
[gasping]

913
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,780
[grunting]

914
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,700
Ponyo! Please don't die!

915
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:38,460
Ponyo!

916
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:41,940
- Ponyo, wake up!
- Shh.

917
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,980
Be careful not to wake her.

918
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:46,580
It's good
to meet you, Sosuke.

919
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,020
We've all been
waiting for you.

920
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,660
- The old ladies, your mother...
- My mother?

921
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:55,340
Won't you come with me and
join them, Sosuke? Ponyo, too.

922
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,340
[man] come with me.

923
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:00,180
I promise I'm not going
to take Ponyo away from you.

924
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:02,860
- We have to go now.
- [Toki] Sosuke!

925
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,020
Sosuke, don't listen
to that wacko!

926
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,300
He tricked all the others
into going with him,

927
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,620
But he couldn't fool me!

928
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:10,460
Toki!

929
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,380
Did you hear me?
Nobody fools me!

930
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:16,500
There is so little time!
My choice has to be made!

931
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:19,500
If the Moon comes any closer...
Can't you see it?

932
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,980
The world is out of balance!
We will all be underwater!

933
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:25,340
That's the best excuse you can
come up with? A falling Moon?

934
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,980
- [moaning] humans!
- Sosuke, come to me!

935
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:30,020
Sosuke, please listen.
You have to trust me.

936
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:33,540
You're the only one who can save
the planet. Do it now. Do it!

937
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,180
Ponyo!

938
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,980
Brunhilde,
respect your father!

939
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:47,780
Ponyo!

940
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:50,500
Sosuke, come on!

941
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,500
Bring them to me!

942
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,180
Faster!

943
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,500
Jump for it!

944
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:40,460
[squeaking]

945
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,620
Now what?

946
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:22,860
[squeaking]

947
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,460
- Mama!
- Sosuke.

948
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,180
Ponyo!

949
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,940
You don't have to swim.

950
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,980
I don't know why
we're here.

951
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:59,380
- So this is Sosuke.
- How do you do?

952
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:02,540
- Are you Ponyo's mother?
- Yes.

953
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,940
You brought my daughter
safely here.

954
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:05,900
[all] shh!

955
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,220
[woman] thank you.

956
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:10,660
Sosuke, Ponyo opened
a magic well

957
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:15,740
Because she wants very much to
be human, to become a real girl.

958
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:20,740
She needs you to accept
and love her as she truly is.

959
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:25,340
You know that Ponyo
was a fish, don't you?

960
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,380
Mm-hm.

961
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,380
[woman] and you
know her as a human.

962
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:31,460
- Your drop of blood did that.
- Oh, that's it!

963
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,660
I cut my thumb. Then Ponyo
licked it and made it better.

964
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,380
So that's how she
changed into a human.

965
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:41,900
Could you love her if she
moved between two worlds?

966
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,340
Mm-hm. I love
all the Ponyos.

967
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:48,820
It's a big responsibility,
but I really love her.

968
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:53,140
[giggling]

969
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:55,940
[chuckling]

970
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:00,620
- [all laughing]
- ooh!

971
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:04,300
Ponyo, come here, please.

972
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:22,620
Ponyo, Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

973
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:28,700
To become human, you must
choose to abandon magic.

974
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:32,060
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hm.

975
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,780
Kiss the bubble, child,
when you return to land,

976
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:47,940
And Ponyo will become a girl,
growing up just like you.

977
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,820
I accept, Ponyo.

978
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,820
Thank you very much,
Ponyo’s mother.

979
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,020
Everyone, the balance
of nature is restored.

980
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:08,060
- Life begins again.
- [cheering]

981
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,860
I'm so proud!

983
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,060

[gasps]

986
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:44,180
- Good luck, Lisa.
- Thank you.

987
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:46,180
I'll take care of her.

988
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:59,700
There you are!
Are you all right?

989
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,900
Wait, let me
get your wheelchairs!

990
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:08,980
Don't bother, shima-san.
We like to walk.

991
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,140
Life begins again.

992
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,180
This is yours,
I believe.

993
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:21,940
- Thank you.
- Try to remember me kindly.

994
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:23,820
If you will.
May I?

995
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:31,220
Take care of Ponyo.

996
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:34,740
[gasps] it's your father!

997
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:42,780

998
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:44,460
