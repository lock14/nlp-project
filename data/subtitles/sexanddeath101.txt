00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,040
More and more of us realise
there is no God

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,040
and yet religion still has
a hold over us.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,720
I think ideas of saints
and sinners, heaven and hell

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,320
still shape our thinking.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
I want to give you
a scientific alternative.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,080
This series is not about
whether God exists or not.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,840
It explores more challenging
questions.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm going to be asking
what happens as we move on

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,080
and leave religion behind?

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,080
What will guide and inspire us
in a world free of all gods?

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
How can an atheist find
meaning in life?

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,680
How can we face death without
the comfort of the afterlife?

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
And how should we think about
right and wrong?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,200
I have to believe there is a plan

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,000
and that God is going to accomplish
something through this.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960
I suppose Jesus is an unpaid
babysitter.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,280
It's like, if I'm not watching you,
Jesus is.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,280
So, do you think that we in the West
are too materialistic?

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,400
I think so.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,360
This film is about sin.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,560
Even today, most of us
still carry around the religious

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,560
notion of sin to tell
right from wrong.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,320
People ask me,

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,680
"If you give up religion,
doesn't that mean anything goes?

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,440
"Why not indulge in temptations,
in lust, and greed?"

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,440
"Why not rape, why not steal?"

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,320
I'm going to explore the power
the religious idea of sin

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,320
has over our lives,
explain why it's unhelpful,

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,680
and show how we can use reason
and science

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
to find a better way to be good.

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,120
SIRENS

DISTANT SIREN

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,440
If we don't believe God is watching
over us, we abandon morality.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,480
That's what people say to me.

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,120
Are they right?

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,120
ALARMS BEEP

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,240
This is London in 2011.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,960
For the past two nights
there have been riots,

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,640
there have been windows smashed,
there has been looting.

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,760
It's hard to know why.

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,320
There doesn't seem to be any
very well articulated

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
political motive,
no religious motive.

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,320
It seems to be just more or less
anarchy for its own sake.

46
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,880
Looting for its own sake.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,440
I suppose it's showing how fragile
the bonds of society are.

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
How easily broken they can be.

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,440
It's really quite frightening
in a way.

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Before I look at what reason
can tell us about this,

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,880
I want to explore the case
for religious morality.

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,640
To understand the challenge
facing atheists like me,

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,640
you need to meet someone
like Ray Lewis.

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,000
Evening, boys.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,560
(BOYS)  Evening, sir.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,200
(BOYS)  Evening, sir.
How are you?

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Newham, east London.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,520
In a neighbourhood ravaged
by drugs and gang violence,

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,600
youth workers are fighting back
with a tough love approach,

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,400
inspired by Christian faith.

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,160
Who's going to lead us in Grace
today before supper?

62
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Well done, Moses. Come down
the front here, son.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,160
Let's bow our heads in prayer.

64
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,080
God bless this food as we eat today.

65
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,080
'Some of the riots that we saw
in different parts of England

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,200
reveal that we are in a great
state of crisis.

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,880
I think what was going on was
a sense in which...

68
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,560
Frankly, why not?

69
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
What is it that will restrain me
from getting involved in that?

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,480
That's what we're working with,
against that backdrop.

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,480
We've got to carve out something
where the boys know where they are.

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,160
Is the discipline stricter here
than it is at your normal school?

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,720
Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,520
And do you get taught about things
like what's right and wrong?

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
Yeah.

76
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,440
What do you learn about that?

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,000
Leadership? Yeah?

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We're told leadership traits, which
is bearing, courage, decisiveness,

79
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
enthusiasm, initiative, integrity,
judgement, knowledge, perseverance.

80
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,560
Very good. Perseverance? Very good.

81
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
'I think that this country,
despite its riches,

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,640
is morally bankrupt.

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,520
I was talking to a young man recently
the other day, and he said,

84
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,760
"I've been here 18 months,

85
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,840
"and I realise I don't have
to lie and steal."

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,680
He realised that he doesn't
have to do it.

87
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,400
Yeah.

88
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,880
Yeah.
He's 14 years of age.
I said, "What do you mean?"

89
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,440
He said, "Well, every time somebody
asked me a question,

90
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,240
"it never dawned on me
to tell the truth.

91
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,080
"I've grown up in a culture
where everybody lies,

92
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,080
"everybody cheats,
everybody deceives."

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Ray Lewis makes a powerful case
for the clear-cut rules of religion.

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,480
For him, God and an afterlife

95
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,480
instil a sense of responsibility
in this life.

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,080
I believe that there is
a spirit in a man and a woman

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
that goes on beyond, and therefore

98
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,000
at some point that has to come
into account.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,680
Now, that's what I choose to believe.

100
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm not going to argue
for the science of it.

101
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,280
But what I would say
is I actually do believe

102
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,240
that there will be a point
at which

103
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,080
we have to give an account for
the lives that we've been given.

104
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
I think there is no evidence
that we do survive death.

105
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,280
And so, this life is what we've got,
and we should...

106
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,360
That should really redouble
our efforts

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,160
to make this life worthwhile,
not just for ourselves,

108
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,280
to make this life worthwhile,
not just for ourselves,
Right.

109
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,720
but for other people. Try to make
the world a better place,

110
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,160
cos it's the only world we've got.

111
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,160
I wonder whether or not you have
rejected the trappings,

112
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,080
the bullshit of religion,

113
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,320
rather than looking behind it.

114
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,880
Because, you see, for me,
to look beyond this life

115
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,960
gives this life a greater sense
of focus.

116
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,960
That, I think, is something
that religion brings and gives

117
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
and celebrates.

118
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
And without that, Richard,

119
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,720
we've just got intellectual
masturbation, haven't we?

120
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,360
We don't all have your intellect
and your scientific genius,

121
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
so how are we going to get to
the point that we can work it all out

122
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,040
in this kind of fuddy-duddy way?

123
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,240
I have no illusions.
I mean, it's very, very difficult.

124
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,320
My solution would not be
a religious one.

125
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,720
You try to educate people,

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,920
which you're doing brilliantly,
it seems to me.

127
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,240
We could sit down together
and talk to each other and say,

128
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
"I would not wish to live
in the kind of society..."

129
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
But, Richard, I hear you, but without
religion, do you not lose power?

130
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,960
What drives me in this work
is some sense of the spirit.

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,200
Martin Luther King,
he talked about soul force.

132
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Gandhi was very much leaning on his
spiritual sense of God, if you like.

133
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
If you don't have that, how is it
going to happen? There's no power.

134
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,040
This is challenging.

135
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,520
There's no doubt that Ray Lewis
is being very effective.

136
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,520
I can see the value of invoking
God's authority,

137
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,520
and great leaders like
Martin Luther King and Gandhi

138
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,640
who had religion, too.
But there's a problem.

139
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,040
This approach is about persuading
children that they'll be

140
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,280
held to account in an afterlife.

141
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,160
But there is no evidence for that,

142
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,160
and the more you think about it,
the more implausible it seems.

143
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,240
And also, do we really want
to take our morals

144
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:10,000
straight from the rather rigid
rulebook of an ancient desert tribe?

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,680
It's your move.

146
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,680
All righty then.

147
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,840
You remember King Solomon?

148
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,720
Well, I never met him personally.

149
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,760
He was one of the most wisest kings

150
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,800
that ever walked the face
of the planet Earth,

151
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,880
but his wisdom
did not come overnight.

152
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,880
He had to humble his spirit and
bow down to the true and living God.

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,640
People tell me that if there is
no God, there is no morality.

154
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,520
It's true that throughout
human history,

155
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,520
religion has handed down
simple rules on what's good and bad.

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,800
But it's a belief system rooted in
a Bronze Age view of the world,

157
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,720
obsessed with sex and policing
the purity of the tribe.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,520
Before I set out
the rational view of morality,

159
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,520
I want to explain the problems
with the old religious moral codes.

160
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Here we go. Understanding the enemy -
three enemies we face.

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,960
The world, the Devil and the flesh.
I'm going to go quickly
through the world and the Devil.

162
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,720
We're going to spend most of our time
dealing with the flesh.

163
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,320
What we don't want to do is get hung
up on, "Oh, the Devil made me do it."

164
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,600
We just want to see how the devil
interacts and specifically

165
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,000
how Jesus modelled
some countermeasures.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,520
This is Every Man's Battle,
a Christian ministry

167
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,520
that runs hundreds of workshops
across America every year.

168
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,080
Here, they adapt ancient scriptures

169
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,080
to try to fight modern male
temptations like internet porn.

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Sin offers us the opportunity
to meet a legitimate need
in an illegitimate way.

171
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,440
Let's talk about the body
for a minute and masturbation.

172
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
If you continue to do it, you will
be perpetually locked

173
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,640
into this struggle
with your sexual integrity.

174
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,320
Does this make sense?

175
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Questions.

176
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,240
Christianity has always been
peculiarly judgemental

177
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,560
about what people get up to
in the bedroom.

178
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,560
But do we really want to brand
everyday thoughts as sinful?

179
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,040
"I don't deserve my family" is
the shame message they would hear.

180
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,360
These are in a list of probably
40 or 50 different shame messages

181
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,600
they can choose from,
or they can write in their own.

182
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,600
A couple of months ago,
we had a guy here

183
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,360
who his shame message
was "I'm a (BLEEP) idiot."

184
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,280
That wasn't on your list?

185
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
That was not on our list.

186
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,200
Aren't you being very hard
on yourselves?

187
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,080
No, I don't think so.

188
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,760
My story is filled with pornography,
masturbation, online affairs,

189
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
that eventually went offline.

190
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,320
I came to the point
of really just being suicidal.

191
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,840
I hated my behaviour, I hated myself.

192
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,160
I prayed a bajillion times for God
to show up and he wouldn't.

193
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,600
It's like he was silent.

194
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,680
I wasn't about to tell
my wife or any of my friends.

195
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,720
My wife would divorce me and my
friends would disown me, I thought.

196
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,240
I came to this place
and the only way for this to end
is for me to kill myself.

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
I had this moment in the shower

198
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
where I fell to the bottom
of the shower

199
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,640
in this puddle of tears
and vomit and soapy water

200
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,640
under the weight of the reality
of my life, that I can't fix this.

201
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,240
I cried out to God in surrender.

202
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,080
"You have to fix this."

203
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,320
That's when everything
changed for me.

204
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,560
This is my wife Shelly
and my son Truman

205
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
a couple of years ago hiking in Vale.

206
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,960
When I think about the way
that this day went,

207
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,640
or I think about that day there,

208
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,360
the last thing I want to do
is cheat on that woman.

209
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,960
The last thing I want to do is tell
this little boy,

210
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,240
"Hey, your dad was an adulterer
and then he got his life right

211
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,880
"and then he wrecked it again."

212
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
I don't want to have
that conversation.

213
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Jason no doubt has laudable aims,
but does this preaching work?

214
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Do religious believers resist
temptation better than anyone else?

215
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
In 2011, the psychologist
Darrel Ray scoured the evidence.

216
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Through an online survey,

217
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,240
he interrogated over 14,000 people
who had left their churches

218
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
about their sex lives
before and after religion.

219
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,120
We asked four questions -
when did you start masturbating,

220
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,840
when did you start having oral sex,
when did you start petting

221
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
and when did you start
having intercourse?

222
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,720
We compared those people
who were raised most religious

223
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,000
with those who were raised
least religious.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
We had thousands of people
in both of these groups,

225
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,400
and what we found was
there's almost no difference.

226
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,040
We did see a little bump
in pornography.

227
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,040
The older religious people got,
the more they use pornography

228
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,280
and they actually exceed
non-religious people by 5 or 10%

229
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,600
in the use of pornography.

230
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,760
Whether you're religious or not,
biology happens.

231
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
You're going to start masturbating,

232
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,440
you're going to start having sex,
but what's the difference? Guilt.

233
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,440
The religious people feel a lot
of guilt about the premarital sex
they're having

234
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,000
or about the masturbation
they've started.

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They don't know what to do with it.

236
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,400
There's really no difference
in the actual sexual behaviour

237
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,280
that religious and non-religious
people indulge in.

238
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,320
What is different is
the guilt they feel?

239
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,000
Religions preach against pornography,
preach against masturbation,

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,920
preach against premarital sex,
and it does no good.

241
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
The highest use of pornography
in the United States

242
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,560
is in Utah and Mississippi.

243
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,320
These are things
that churches preach against

244
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,120
and yet their members are using it
even more than secular people do.

245
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,400
When I give my talks on sex,
I often tend to ask,

246
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,120
"How many of you masturbate?"

247
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,240
I'll get people raising their hands
all over the place, maybe 80 or 90%.

248
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,080
Some people will raise both hands!

249
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,920
If I ask that same question
in a religious group,

250
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,640
nobody will raise their hand,

251
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,760
but we know that somewhere
in the neighbourhood

252
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,760
of 95% of males masturbate,
and 70 to 75% of females masturbate.

253
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,920
If nobody is raising their hand,
that tells us they're lying.

254
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,560
Religious people lie.

255
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,360
My own grandmother lived 83 years,

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,360
she went to the grave
denying that she was ever divorced,

257
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,120
because her religious beliefs

258
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,520
said divorced people
are condemned and damned.

259
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,160
She never admitted it.

260
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,280
We all knew she had,
but that's the power of religion

261
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,280
to hold an entire lifetime hostage.
That's a lot of pain.

262
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,240
So the extraordinary thing

263
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,960
is that not only does religion
fail to stop people sinning,

264
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,400
it also forces them to live a lie.

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,400
The most powerful example of this
I found in Paris.

266
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Here we can see religious tradition
for what it is,

267
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,280
as the lies spiral into hypocrisy.

268
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,560
A few hundred metres
from the smart boutiques
of the Champs Elysee in Paris,

269
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,800
the plastic surgeon
Dr Marc Abecassis

270
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
can cover up the sins of the past.

271
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,040
He specialises in repairing the
hymen membrane in women's vaginas.

272
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,960
To all appearances, he turns women
who have had sex

273
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,800
back into virgins again.

274
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
You can ask yourself as a surgeon,
is it fair?

275
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,560
Am I in the right path to do that?

276
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,040
These are questions that we ask
a lot to the patients.

277
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,640
Are you going to be sincere
doing that, Miss?

278
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,800
Indeed.

279
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Aren't you building a wedding
or a relation on a lie?

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
More and more,
I ask these questions,

281
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,920
more and more I have
the same answers.

282
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,920
They just ask me, "Dr Abecassis,
who do you think you are?

283
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,360
"Maybe I'm not going to be a virgin
in the facts,

284
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,360
"but I want to rehabilitate myself.
I want to restore my integrity.

285
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
"This is a pureness to give back
to the person I shall love

286
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,040
"or I shall marry with."

287
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,320
But this hymen reconstruction,

288
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,320
it's just symbolic
of something which is not there.

289
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,600
It's a lie.

290
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,800
It's a lie for you.

291
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Dr Abecassis performs around four
of these operations every week

292
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,440
and demand is growing.

293
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,440
The majority of patients are
Algerian Muslims and for many,

294
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,520
sadly, this is not some luxury
option but grim necessity.

295
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,480
They tell you,
"My brother is going to kill me."

296
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,440
There is this bad situation
in which they are going to be

297
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,800
if they don't present
an intact membrane.

298
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,640
That means if they don't bleed,
does it?

299
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,640
They know today more and more
that they are not obliged to bleed,

300
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,200
but they know that
if there will be a resistance

301
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
during the intercourse,
things are going to be all right.

302
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,760
The husband is going to feel
that there is something.

303
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,920
For her own safety, this patient
has asked to remain anonymous.

304
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,720
(TRANSLATION) I don't risk death.

305
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,720
I don't think so, because
after all I have a family which
remains quite humane,

306
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,240
but I do risk being set apart
and judged.

307
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,080
In North African society, you don't
wash your dirty linen in public.

308
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,240
Religious faith is supposed
to make us pure,

309
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,560
but this woman is caught
between two sins -

310
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,560
public shame and private deception.

311
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,480
I think in front of God,
I shall be alone.

312
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
In front of my community,
my image may also tarnish my family.

313
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,600
I am not alone.
You see what I mean?

314
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,840
That's to say, it's not just me
they'll be judging.

315
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,840
They'll be judging my parents, my
grandparents, my uncles, my aunts.

316
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,040
When I looked around at where I was
living, a society full of lies,

317
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,440
I don't feel guilty at all.

318
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,480
It's not just that the old notion
of sin isn't relevant any more.

319
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,800
We've seen that
it clashes with reality,

320
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,800
it creates guilt
and a society full of lies.

321
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,720
Next, I want to leave God behind

322
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:24,000
and explore what science can tell us
about the true origins of morality.

323
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,960
'Some people think that
if we get rid of God

324
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,960
'and all religious values,
all that's left is anarchy.

325
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,640
'But I want to show that there is
order without religion.

326
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,080
'Let's look at the roots of morality
through Darwinian eyes.

327
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
'One thing we must do is rid
ourselves of the idea that

328
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
'sexual lust is inherently sinful.

329
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,960
'These impulses are universal,

330
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
'and all mammals have evolved
ways to manage them.'

331
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,600
What's that funny patch
I can see under his arm, there?

332
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,080
This lump you can see here is
the brachial glands,

333
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,680
and it's where he'll scent mark

334
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,600
so the female can smell that
he's a good, fit male.

335
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,600
'At Cotswold Wildlife Park,
the keepers are trying to get

336
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,320
'a rare and endangered species,

337
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,320
'the greater bamboo lemur,
to mate successfully.

338
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,960
'But to do that, they have to
carefully observe

339
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,960
'the rituals of lemur courtship.'

340
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,160
He's being very good now,

341
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,320
he's giving her the calls,
which are the beginning

342
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,440
of his courtship display,
his call that he'll do.

343
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,720
There's the tail twitching,
and all of this,

344
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,720
she becomes more and more
interested in his behaviour.

345
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,360
'Perhaps we think of morality
in completely the wrong way.

346
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,120
'By observing animals, we see it
not as some set of lofty ideals,

347
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,280
'but as a practical system
that enables animals

348
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,280
'to get along with each other,
reproduce and survive.'

349
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Jamie, I was once asked by a lawyer
when he discovered that

350
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,760
I was a zoologist, whether animals
have a sense of law.

351
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,120
And I said, "Well, not exactly law,

352
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,000
"but like many human societies
that don't have lawyers

353
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,560
"and policeman, they have customs
and taboos

354
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,520
"and rules that they follow."

355
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,400
Yeah, I would say they certainly do.

356
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,840
You know, there is almost
a feeding order,

357
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,320
so the dominant animal would get the
best of the food or the food first.

358
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,440
That doesn't mean that others
may not try to get in there first,

359
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,760
very much like in human society,

360
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,680
but if they are seen, they'll
certainly fall back into line.

361
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,680
It's the biggest male, generally,
that will breed.

362
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,520
'Critical for any animal's genetic
success

363
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,240
'are the customs surrounding sex,

364
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,240
'and the violence and competition
that sex can unleash.'

365
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,760
364 days of the year,
the females are the boss.

366
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,320
The male's very laid-back,
he keeps out of the way.

367
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,360
Keeps himself to himself and just
tries to avoid trouble, generally.

368
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,640
But on the one day of the year,
sometimes more,

369
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,640
that the females become
sexually receptive, things change.

370
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,120
Things become very, very lawless
for the male,

371
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
and if there was
more than one breeding male,

372
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,640
it really is a fight to the death.

373
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,520
So they fight to the death
on that one day?

374
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,840
They can do.

375
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,160
Generally, one animal would be
severely injured.

376
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,440
They do stink fighting,
which is very interesting,

377
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,680
where they raise their tails
towards each other,

378
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,720
waft them towards each other
so they can deter the other male.

379
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,560
And then they do something
called slash fighting,

380
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,240
where they'll run past each other,

381
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,080
and it's very hard to even see
they've touched each other,

382
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,760
but then there will be some
terrible slash injuries.

383
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,280
So like medieval lancers on their
horses, rushing past each other.

384
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,920
Very much like that, yes.

385
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,760
So from a very coherent society
most of the year,

386
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,760
it all falls to pieces
where sex is concerned.

387
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,280
'This isn't what we'd call morality,
but the customs and taboos

388
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,280
'we see here help us understand
something about sex.'

389
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Sex is, on the face of it, a rather
bizarre way of passing on genes,

390
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,840
since it necessitates joining with
another individual,

391
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,840
each contributing exactly half
the genes to each offspring.

392
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,080
Many animals devote enormous energy
to displaying their attributes

393
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,080
to would-be mates, signalling
they are fit and healthy specimens.

394
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,800
They advertise through carrying
vivid plumage,

395
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,800
vast antlers and horns,
or an outsize tail.

396
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,280
You might think of it
as nature's bling.

397
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Humans also do this, just sometimes
in a more roundabout way.

398
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Dances like the tango, for example,
are courtship rituals in human form.

399
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Darwinian theory is really
a sort of branch of economics.

400
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,880
You might think that the
two sexes are kind of equal,

401
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,080
they both have the same amount
to gain from mating.

402
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,520
Not so.

403
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,920
The goods that a female mammal
brings to the deal are her womb,

404
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,920
time devoted to the baby inside it,
and milk to feed it.

405
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,120
The male generally provides
protection and food.

406
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,480
So far, so good.

407
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,920
But the male and female have very
different genetic interests,

408
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,560
which is where it gets interesting.

409
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,040
The male has the most to gain, by,
if he can,

410
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,760
persuading lots of females
to mate with him

411
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,280
and leaving each one
to fend for herself.

412
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,680
The female has the most to gain
from persuading one male

413
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,840
to be loyal to her, faithful to her,

414
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,840
and to provide a full economic
upbringing for her offspring.

415
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,760
It's this constant economic
tussle between the sexes

416
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,760
which makes courtship so important.

417
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,720
There's a lot at stake.

418
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,200
The male tries to ensure that
the female is faithful,

419
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,960
so he doesn't bring up another
male's child

420
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,400
and perpetuate another male's
genes.

421
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,320
The female must be faithful,
or at least appear to be,

422
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
or the male may abandon her

423
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,320
and force her to bring up
the offspring on her own.

424
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,840
So one key characteristic
we see being displayed

425
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,840
in animal courtship is what
we humans would call jealousy.

426
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Females will tend to be coy
and will tend to advertise

427
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,920
their fidelity, advertise
their faithfulness to the male.

428
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,440
Males, on the other hand, will tend
to go in for mate guarding.

429
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Say, putting an arm round a woman
at a social gathering.

430
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,200
So evolutionary science shows
you don't need religion

431
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,560
to have order and even courtesy
in relationships.

432
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,400
It's not just anything goes
and sex in the street.

433
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,400
That's been tried in the past,
with odd results.

434
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Well, I think what's happening
in San Francisco is the only

435
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,200
meaningful thing that's happening
in this country

436
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,080
and quite possibly the world.

437
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,960
In the 1960s,
the San Francisco Bay area

438
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,640
was at the heart of the hippy
experiment in so-called free love.

439
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,400
I remember it well,
because I was there.

440
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Well, this is Telegraph Avenue,
which used to be filled

441
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,720
with street people selling beads
and carpets and drugs and things.

442
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,880
Can't see any sign of that
activity today,

443
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,520
but possibly it's just because

444
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,560
it's only about nine o'clock
in the morning.

445
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,280
Probably haven't got up yet.

446
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,240
I used to live here
in the late 1960s.

447
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,240
I was a very junior faculty member
at the University Of California.

448
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,520
And it was a time of great
political unrest,

449
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,320
it was the time of the Vietnam War.

450
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,000
There was tear gas,
there were riot police,

451
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,560
the National Guard, bayonets.

452
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,400
CHANTING

453
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,840
Part of the rebellion against
authority came in

454
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,640
trying to throw off
sexual inhibitions.

455
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,640
Coyness and mate guarding were out.

456
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,680
The sexual culture was pretty free.
Rather shockingly so.

457
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,200
I remember once walking down
this very street,

458
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,920
and there was a young man walking
ahead of me, a sort of hippy type,

459
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,080
and every young woman
who came towards him,

460
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,880
he would just reach out
and feel her breast.

461
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,760
And then just walk on. And she
took not the slightest notice.

462
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Another time, I saw a young woman in
Telegraph Avenue completely naked.

463
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,800
That is a very clear memory.

464
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,800
It definitely happened.

465
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,040
But that '60s culture of letting it
all hang out didn't last.

466
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,800
I'm intrigued by why
all that's left today are tourists,

467
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,920
grizzled street sellers
and dirty needles in the park.

468
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,720
Perhaps the answer lies, once again,

469
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,400
in understanding our evolution
as a species.

470
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Science suggests that the rules
we've evolved around courtship

471
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,520
and sex are attached to deep-rooted
emotions and reactions

472
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,560
that are hard to jettison overnight.

473
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,600
(SNIFFS THEN GAGS)

474
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,280
This is the reaction that I have.

475
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,680
These are crabs that are used
for seasoning.

476
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,680
'The man assaulting my senses
is the psychologist David Pizarro.'

477
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,040
Oh, my God!
That makes me want to retch.

478
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,040
'He is studying the science
of disgust.'

479
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,840
This is from the film, Trainspotting.

480
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Aptly titled the worst toilet
in Scotland.

481
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Yuck!

482
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,520
FLATULENCE

483
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,760
MOANING

484
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,920
That's horrible.

485
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,680
OK, I've shown you a brief portion.

486
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,040
I could see the disgust
in your face.

487
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,840
But what if I were, say, to present
you with something like this.

488
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,800
And I asked you to handle it
and maybe, uh...

489
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,440
I won't ask you to put that
in your mouth, but...

490
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,440
Well, I mean, I can kind of tell
that's a joke.

491
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,360
This actually wouldn't worry me
all that much, I mean, I can see...

492
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,680
You might trust that I wouldn't
put actual faeces.

493
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,240
And as it turns out, this is soap.

494
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,880
It's soap. So now you've told me,

495
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,320
I wouldn't mind washing my hands
with that.

496
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,560
So now I'm going to show you
a few other images.

497
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,040
They're different from the first
ones I showed you.

498
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,360
You'll see immediately why.

499
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,800
Oh, God. Yes. Yes.

500
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,720
'David Pizarro shows me

501
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,280
'a highly graphic image
of three elderly men

502
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,760
'engaged in homosexual sex.'

503
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,720
Ugh!

504
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,760
Oh, God!

505
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,760
'Now I'm looking at a degrading
sexual act involving vomit.'

506
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,000
I'll leave this at two,
because these are actually

507
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,840
so disgusting that I feel bad
having shown them to you.

508
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,520
Those two images were images
of a sexual nature,

509
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,720
and as it turns out,
the domain of sex

510
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,720
is one in which we are
easily disgusted.

511
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,400
'The "Yuck!" reaction
is an emotion

512
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,280
'that almost certainly evolved
to help us survive,

513
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,280
'to make us back off from
potential disease.

514
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,800
'But what's fascinating is how
disgust seems to have been

515
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,800
'harnessed to reinforce our sense
of judgement and moral disapproval.'

516
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,200
I kept finding that responses
to questions like

517
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,800
"How disgusted would you be if you
were to walk into a public restroom

518
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,440
"and found an unflushed toilet?"

519
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,520
were consistently correlated
with political orientation.

520
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,880
The more likely you are to be
disgusted in everyday life,

521
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,520
the more likely you are to hold
attitudes,

522
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,640
in the sexual domain especially,

523
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,640
that are moral beliefs against,
for instance,

524
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,560
the behaviour of two men having sex.

525
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,840
Yes, let me ask a question
about that,

526
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,880
because I had a fairly strong
disgust reaction

527
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,280
to some of the things you showed,

528
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,520
but the important difference
is that I don't try to impose

529
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,960
my own dislikes on what
other people are allowed to do.

530
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,240
It's nothing to do with me
what people do in private.

531
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,520
I think that's the crucial
distinction.

532
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,520
But it is a very common thought
in moral codes across the world

533
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,880
that many things are wrong by dint
of their being somehow impure.

534
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,880
I think that the real answer here
comes from the fact that

535
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,480
we can now actually see
what is harmful and what is not,

536
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,480
and we can decide to put our disgust
to rest

537
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,840
when it comes to making
moral judgements.

538
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,720
And one of the things that I ask
my students in my class is,

539
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,120
imagine two very, very ugly people
having sex.

540
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,800
Disgusting.

541
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,800
But would you ever think to make it
illegal for ugly people to have sex?

542
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,080
Well, of course not.

543
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,560
Well, maybe it's a case in which
we might be able to say,

544
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,320
you know what? I'm grossed out
by what you're doing,

545
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
but that has nothing to do with

546
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,840
whether you should be put
in prison for it.

547
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,200
This is the key point.

548
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,320
We have instincts that used to
protect our primitive ancestors.

549
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Because of that, we may still find
some things emotionally repellent.

550
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,120
But we have evolved also
a sense of reason,

551
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,120
which curbs our tendency to project
our disgust onto other people.

552
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,640
In our post-religion world,

553
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,640
we can look rationally at what
we once called sinful behaviour.

554
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,680
We can weigh up actual harms and
benefits, and temper our instincts.

555
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,160
In this way, advanced societies
like ours can move on,

556
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,160
shifting the line on what is deemed
right or wrong.

557
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,720
Probably the dominant change
in my lifetime

558
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,800
is the change in attitude
towards gays.

559
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,800
When I first entered Parliament in
1979, I started campaigning

560
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,680
not for equal rights -

561
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,120
we wouldn't have dared use
a word like equal rights -

562
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,080
but I started campaigning for a
measure of respect for homosexuals.

563
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,080
I thought, if I was very lucky,
we might get the age of consent

564
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,440
reduced from 21 to 18
by the time I died.

565
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,800
I thought, if I was very lucky,

566
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,760
I could stop the police
impersonating gays

567
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,120
in order to pick people up in public
lavatories and then prosecute them.

568
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,560
These things seem to change
so slowly, and then suddenly,

569
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,760
like an avalanche,
everything changed

570
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,560
and long before the end of my life.

571
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,560
I cannot believe the speed with
what seemed to be a really fixed

572
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,200
public loathing of homosexuality has
changed to a shrug of the shoulders.

573
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,640
public loathing of homosexuality has
changed to a shrug of the shoulders.
Yes.

574
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,480
'Matthew Parris believes
it is our capacity for reason

575
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,840
'that lies behind this growing
tolerance.'

576
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,480
In our culture,
the advance of science,

577
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,480
the advance of scientific,
medical, psychological knowledge,

578
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,480
the understanding that things
are not rooted in sin

579
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,640
that comes from demons and the devil,

580
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,640
but rooted in very deep internal
aspects of our own...

581
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,240
the mechanisms of our mind.

582
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,240
So blame is much less important
in these things,

583
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,040
and, of course, illnesses used to be
attributed sometimes to sin too.

584
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,880
Well, it isn't a matter of sin,
it isn't a matter blame.

585
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,360
And I think those attitudes

586
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,800
have probably been changing
over 200 years,

587
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,080
and the change has accelerated
in the last century.

588
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,400
'It seems like a wonderfully
positive story.

589
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,000
'But Matthew Parris does have
concerns.'

590
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,240
..They're getting...
Well, what shall we say?

591
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,800
..more liberal,
more tolerant.

592
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,240
What you and I would think of
as better.

593
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,040
We are actually getting better.

594
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I suppose, though, that a fear
that certainly haunts me

595
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,400
and others in the gay liberation
movement

596
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,160
is that if things could swing
so rapidly in our favour

597
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,160
as they have, could we, in a sort
of Third Reich-like world,

598
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,840
see things swinging very rapidly,
equally rapidly the other way?

599
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,600
A backlash.

600
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,200
A backlash.
How little anchored, perhaps,
are these categories.

601
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,400
Yes.

602
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,440
CHANTING

603
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,120
There's a sort of feeling of hatred
for bankers, for rich people,

604
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,000
for plutocrats, at the moment.
I could imagine a little winter,

605
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,520
a little ice age for the richest
in society coming

606
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,320
as the Western economy sinks,

607
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,280
and as people are looking
for somebody to blame,

608
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
just as the Jews got it in the neck,
so to speak, between the two wars.

609
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,520
I understand what Matthew Parris
is getting at,

610
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,320
but I think I'm more optimistic
about human nature.

611
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,880
I want to argue that,
now we've left religion behind,

612
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:49,000
we're getting better,
more moral, and kinder.

613
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,280
'If you want to understand what
makes a human being good,

614
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,200
'watch them with a pet.

615
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,680
'Tiko is a wolf,
or he thinks he's a wolf.

616
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
'His not very distant
ancestors were wolves.'

617
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,000
Good dog, Tiko.

618
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,480
'He loves going for a walk because
he sees what happened overnight,

619
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,160
'which he can tell
from the smells that were left.'

620
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,520
Come on, Tiko.

621
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,360
'He stops at every corner,
stops at every lamppost.

622
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,360
'It's sort of like reading
the newspaper for him, I think.'

623
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,480
Off we go.

624
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,120
It's a very different world
to be in, a dog's world,

625
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
and we anthropomorphise,

626
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,000
we put ourselves in the position
of the dog,

627
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,680
project ourselves
into the body of the dog

628
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,680
and we think we know what
it's like to be a dog, and we don't.

629
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,800
We delude ourselves.

630
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,800
But that's part of what goes on
when we love a dog.

631
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,920
Tiko, do you like going to
puppy class?

632
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Do you?
And do you play with Figgy?

633
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,880
And do you play with Denis?
Do you?

634
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,760
'What am I doing with my dog?'

635
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,520
Do you play with Watson?

636
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,800
'I'm empathising,

637
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,400
'I'm making an imaginative leap
to see the world

638
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,240
'from a dog's perspective.'

639
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,520
Paw.

640
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,640
Good boy.

641
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,640
'Humans are extraordinarily good
at identifying with other humans

642
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,720
'and other species.

643
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,440
'And it has a profoundly
moral effect.'

644
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,440
When we see a dog or a person
suffering, we suffer, too.

645
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,520
We suffer vicariously,
it's a very powerful emotion.

646
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,520
If I see Tiko suffering,
if he's ill, in pain,

647
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,840
I feel devastated.

648
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,840
It's exactly as though
it was my own child, I suppose.

649
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,880
Tiko, uppity-paw.

650
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,720
Empathy is important for morality

651
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,480
because perhaps the most fundamental
principle of morality,

652
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,480
the golden rule, involves putting
yourself in the position of another.

653
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,080
Do as you would be done by.

654
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,080
How would you like it
if you were treated like that?

655
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,680
We don't need God
telling us the rule.

656
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,200
Science shows
we humans are hardwired

657
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,080
to have empathy.

658
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,880
Scientists can now scan which
parts of the brain register

659
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,520
vicarious pain or pleasure.

660
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,120
They can track how hormones,

661
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,480
like oxytocin, which encourage
compassion and nurturing,

662
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,480
act on the emotion systems
in the brain.

663
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,120
Brain science helps us to see why
we find it a bad idea to steal,

664
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,240
why we hate to see somebody
kicking a dog.

665
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,240
We can trace the chemicals
in the brain that reward kindness.

666
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,320
We can see what goes on in the brain
when we feel for others.

667
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,880
Goodness is natural to us.

668
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Kindness is in our physiology.

669
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,360
So, you might ask, quite rightly,

670
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,360
if humans have this innate capacity
for good, why does it go wrong?

671
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,120
Why do we still do bad things?

672
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Perhaps there's a scientific
answer to that, too.

673
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,920
Here, we go back to those
primitive moral emotions

674
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,840
that helped us survive.

675
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,400
You've got empathy,

676
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,640
you've got kindness,
you've got nurturing,

677
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,560
you've got all of this,

678
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,400
but you also have disgust,
cruelty, fear.

679
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,400
All of those are evolved
to protect you and your kin.

680
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,320
The neuroscientist Kathleen Taylor
has studied what happens

681
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,000
when people decide that others
are not included in their tribe.

682
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,560
She calls it "otherisation".

683
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,560
The others are commonly
classed as beasts or subhuman.

684
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,720
You're not just saying that's my
enemy, you're actually saying,

685
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,120
that is a less than human person,
I am not going to call that person

686
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,640
the same moral status as I would
to my nearest and dearest.

687
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,040
Those who carried out the final
solution in Nazi Germany

688
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,440
could only have done it, presumably,
by otherisation of the Jews?

689
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Yes, because one of the things that
it does is, it suppresses empathy.

690
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,600
So, for example, the groups
who were committing the worst

691
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,720
atrocities on the Eastern Front in
the Second World War,

692
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,800
they're not just

693
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,760
forgetting about morality altogether
and just engaging in cruelty.

694
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,640
Their cruelty is very targeted
and very directed

695
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,640
and people who are part of their
group escape cruelty, on the whole.

696
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,160
And people who are not part
of their group are the ones who

697
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,280
bear the brunt of it.

698
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,280
But even in the times of horror,
there are moments

699
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,280
which should be cherished
where empathy breaks through.

700
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,040
There's an interesting example
from the SS of a man who is helping

701
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,360
to dispose, as they put it,
of some Jewish children.

702
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,280
His parents had already been killed.

703
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,480
And he talks about how
he was doing it,

704
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,440
and he had to take the hand
of a little girl

705
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,840
and he just couldn't do it.
His empathy came back.

706
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,920
It overwhelmed him,
so he's got a lot of ideology,

707
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,720
a lot of group pressure saying
these people are not human,

708
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,720
you will not treat them as human,
but it's obvious that

709
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,760
if the cues are sufficiently
powerful, if you like,

710
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,040
that can go,
that can be reversed.

711
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,840
He was on his own for a little
while, with this little girl,

712
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,200
and suddenly he was a dad...

713
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,640
He realised he was human.

714
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,640
He realised he was human.
Yeah.

715
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,800
If we are to build
a non-religious morality,

716
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,360
one thing we must strenuously
avoid is demonising

717
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,360
another set of humans,
or treating them as unequal.

718
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Quite apart from anything else,
this leads to a collapse of empathy.

719
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,680
What we need to do is expand
the circle of those to whom

720
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,440
we feel empathy.

721
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,200
Break down the barriers
that divide us,

722
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,200
the tribalisms of religion,
class, race and ideology.

723
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,400
Our scientific
understanding of empathy,

724
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,400
and the memory of how we've got it
wrong in the past, can help.

725
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,280
And the good news is,
we're already doing it.

726
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,280
200 years ago, it was normal,
acceptable, to keep slaves.

727
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,800
Now, it would
be considered barbaric.

728
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,280
The same with racism.

729
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,080
I was brought up in British
colonial Africa,

730
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,360
and I vividly remember the
patronising attitude at the time.

731
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,560
The Africans are like children,
they can't look after themselves.

732
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,320
We have to do it for them.

733
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,000
Today, such an attitude
would be unthinkable.

734
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,680
Our capacity for empathy,
together with a more rational,

735
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,760
tolerant society, is, I believe,

736
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,760
making us more moral
than ever before.

737
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,560
And yet, if you were to believe some
moralists and some newspapers,

738
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
society is going to hell
in a handcart.

739
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,960
But is it?

740
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,840
The psychologist Steven Pinker has
looked at the figures in detail,

741
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,840
including data from the British Home
Office and the US Bureau of Justice,

742
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,640
and found that as religion declines,
we're becoming ever more civilised.

743
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,560
I had no idea that, say,
in the last 40 years,

744
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,920
the rate of rape had declined by 80%.

745
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,120
80%?!

746
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,720
80% in the United States.

747
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,840
The rate of domestic abuse
in both the UK and the US...

748
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,920
That rape figure is even
more surprising,

749
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,640
because presumably the number
of reportings has gone up.

750
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,360
Exactly. That's right.

751
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,360
Child abuse has gone down,
attitudes towards racial minorities,

752
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,640
attitudes towards homosexuals,
treatment of animals in laboratories.

753
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,680
Yet the perception of these things
has gone in the other direction,

754
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,640
because everybody thinks that child
abuse has been climbing.

755
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,720
It may be because
of the increased concern

756
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,320
that we both think that it's more
prevalent than ever before,

757
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,560
and we've managed to put it down
because people care about it,

758
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,600
take steps to minimise it
and those steps clearly succeed.

759
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,600
And there are many positive
developments that we take for granted

760
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,440
because they are non-events,
they're dogs that don't bark.

761
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,440
An example would be the disappearance
of war between developed states.

762
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,160
Even in the developing world,

763
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,840
where we think of as a war-torn
hell-hole,

764
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,840
the numbers show that the number
of wars and the numbers of deaths

765
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,400
in war have plummeted worldwide
in the last 20 years,

766
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,240
since the end of the Cold War.

767
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,280
Deaths are lower in absolute numbers.

768
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,200
In a world of seven billion people,

769
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,200
fewer people are dying in warfare
than ever before.

770
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,360
Are we too down on ourselves?

771
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,840
Do you think that, actually,
we're becoming more moral?

772
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,360
I don't know if we're becoming
more moral biologically,

773
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,360
but I think there is something
about a society with free speech,

774
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,800
with open enquiry,
with rational debate,

775
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,840
with the accumulation of evidence,

776
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,600
that will tend to push us
in a moral direction.

777
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,120
In particular, the whole current
that we call humanism,

778
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,120
which almost sounds banal
and boring and treacly nowadays,

779
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,760
simply because it's
become second nature to us,

780
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,760
but I think it's a radical
idea in human history.

781
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,960
A cynic about human nature might
say that religious morality

782
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,480
is an effective way
of keeping people in line.

783
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,560
The threat of hell,
the reward of heaven.

784
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,560
But the rules of the holy books
are out of date and often barbaric.

785
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,440
Science shows that we're governed
by quite logical hidden rules

786
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,000
and customs, and the highly
evolved senses that humans

787
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,880
have, of reason and empathy.

788
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,200
More important,
we now live in a rational age

789
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,160
and can look at where
we've gone wrong in history,

790
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,160
and avoid the tribalism that divides
and harms us.

791
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,480
This, surely, is real progress.

792
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,080
We live in what may be
a more peaceful,

793
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,800
more civilised world
than ever before.

794
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,360
We have the opportunity
to develop a new morality,

795
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,360
and that is an exciting part
of what it means to be human.

796
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
In the next programme -
the meaning of life.

797
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,360
What's the point
if this life is all there is?

798
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Why does an atheist
get up in the morning?
