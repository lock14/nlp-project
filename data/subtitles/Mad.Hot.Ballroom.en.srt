{2048}{2092}{y:i}- Good morning, class.|{y:i}- Good morning, Mr. Rodney!
{2133}{2201}{y:i}Thank you very much. Can I have|{y:i}everybody standing up straight?
{2203}{2260}{y:i}Standing up nice and tall,|{y:i}like you're about to enter a ballroom.
{2262}{2291}{y:i}Which is what you're about to do.
{2350}{2410}Show me some imagination, all right?|Here we go.
{2412}{2454}Ladies and gentlemen,|please enter the ballroom...
{2457}{2494}and create a circle.
{2497}{2561}Enter the ballroom and create a circle.
{2578}{2599}Okay.
{2602}{2643}Feet together.
{2659}{2685}All right.
{2688}{2755}Do you know what I'm gonna do|just because I want to be in style...
{2758}{2811}and I want to look like everybody else?
{2814}{2841}I'm gonna do this.
{2844}{2868}Oh, my God.
{2870}{2942}How would you like it|if I taught class like this?
{2945}{2993}- Does it look nice? Does it look stylish?|- No.
{2995}{3039}No, right? It looks pretty bad, doesn't it?
{3042}{3114}All right. So, can I have the gentlemen|tuck their shirts in, please?
{3117}{3198}Can I have the gentlemen|tuck their shirts in, please?
{3228}{3301}You don't have to|take off your pants to do it.
{3726}{3804}One, two, pronounce: Merengue.
{3820}{3886}Who knows what country|merengue came from?
{3920}{3959}- Italy?|- Okay.
{3972}{4033}- Dominican Republic.|- Absolutely. What's your name?
{4035}{4061}Nile.
{4083}{4141}Dominican Republic, ladies and gentlemen.
{4143}{4205}Gentlemen, take your partner, please.
{4235}{4305}Elbows together. Okay, make yourself taller.
{4326}{4370}Very good, very good.
{4381}{4433}It's okay, it's okay. He will help you.
{4436}{4489}- I don't know how...|- He'll remember. Let me help you.
{4516}{4550}My arm hurts.
{4560}{4605}Take your position next to her.
{4642}{4725}Five, four, three, two.
{4754}{4826}No, not yet. Five, six, ready, go!
{4829}{4910}One, three, five, ladies.
{4921}{4985}One, two, three, four, five, six.
{4987}{5031}Keep going. One, two...
{5034}{5057}{y:i}I'll be honest with you.
{5060}{5122}{y:i}I didn't know that I wanted|{y:i}to go ahead with ballroom dancing.
{5125}{5203}But, I decided, yeah, we'll just give it|a shot and I'll see how it goes...
{5206}{5269}and it was a tough year|because it was after 9/11.
{5272}{5361}So, we didn't get back to our building|until February, this started in March.
{5364}{5438}{y:i}But, it seemed like, "Oh, well,|{y:i}something positive has to come out of this. "
{5441}{5499}{y:i}And these kids need something uplifting.
{5502}{5601}{y:i}Although, I'm not such a great fan of,|{y:i}you know, hard competition and winning...
{5603}{5695}{y:i}but I was thrilled with the outcome,|{y:i}and that's why we're still doing it.
{6047}{6095}{y:i}Five, six, seven, and...
{6098}{6184}back, two, three, four, walk in, seven, eight.
{6186}{6275}Back, two, three, four, walk in, seven, eight.
{6278}{6321}Back, two, three, she turns.
{6324}{6364}Five, six, seven, yes!
{6366}{6424}Give yourselves a round of applause.
{6438}{6482}So, what happens is|everyone knows the merengue...
{6485}{6521}feels very comfortable with it.
{6523}{6594}But then I start seeing some sloppy things.
{6597}{6675}Can I show you? Sloppy arms.|Are you ready?
{6712}{6776}What am I doing wrong?
{6778}{6823}- Yes, sir.|- You're waking up the people on top.
{6826}{6878}I'm waking up the people|on top of the hotel, right?
{6881}{6930}Upstairs, remember, hands on the hips?
{6933}{7019}Upstairs, people are sleeping.|Down here, the party's going on.
{7022}{7028}Remember in the beginning,|we all thought...
{7028}{7073}Remember in the beginning,|we all thought...
{7075}{7170}that the dances were going to be|really hard, but it was mad easy?
{7185}{7225}It wasn't weird to me...
{7228}{7331}because I seen them a lot,|'cause my nanny does them.
{7334}{7388}And Ronnie even knows|because when he was over...
{7390}{7456}my nanny was helping us do the foxtrot.
{7458}{7536}So, it wasn't, like, weird to me.|It got easier and easier.
{8382}{8440}{y:i}What can you tell me about a fox?
{8442}{8470}What does a fox look like?
{8473}{8550}A fox look like a dog, but it's like...
{8553}{8620}a dangerous dog that lives in the woods.
{8622}{8649}Yeah, okay.
{8652}{8717}Good, excellent. What else does that fox do?
{8720}{8826}He go quietly|and then he jump on the chicken.
{8833}{8858}Right, very good.
{8861}{8949}The fox sneaks up. He's quiet.
{8961}{8985}Right?
{8987}{9053}So that's how we're gonna dance this dance.
{9055}{9090}We're gonna be smooth...
{9093}{9148}we're gonna be sneaky,|we're gonna be quiet...
{9150}{9205}when we do a foxtrot. Okay?
{9208}{9302}Let's get in our imaginary ghost position,|dance position.
{9304}{9384}And without touching anyone,|skate across the floor.
{9386}{9464}Ready, go. Skate, skate...
{9466}{9540}{y:i}The children and most of the people|{y:i}who live here in Washington Heights...
{9542}{9591}{y:i}come from Dominican Republic.
{9594}{9698}There are a large, large percentage|of single-parent families.
{9700}{9786}There are many children being raised|by grandparents, aunts, uncles.
{9789}{9877}Many situations where|more than one family lives in a home.
{9879}{9923}{y:i}So, the children don't have much advantage.
{9926}{9989}{y:i}There's 97% poverty rate in the school...
{9992}{10041}{y:i}so the children come to school with issues.
{10043}{10075}Here we go.
{10155}{10245}Five, six, seven, go.
{10248}{10293}Slow, slow...
{10295}{10381}quick, quick, slow, slow, away.
{10389}{10426}Slow, slow...
{10429}{10469}{y:i}Children in a middle-class neighborhood...
{10471}{10497}{y:i}have many more advantages.
{10499}{10565}{y:i}If they want to go to dancing school,|{y:i}they can go to dancing school.
{10568}{10628}{y:i}They want to take piano lessons,|{y:i}they can take piano lessons.
{10630}{10674}{y:i}'Cause their parents can afford it.
{10690}{10748}This program is free for the kids.
{10778}{10860}So, they have the advantage|of learning something new...
{10862}{10933}{y:i}of perfecting it, and of being successful.
{10935}{11004}{y:i}And they'll compete|{y:i}because they want to win.
{11006}{11084}So, ladies and gentlemen,|when I said it's like a merengue step...
{11086}{11165}what I mean is just that you're going|side together like the merengue.
{11168}{11253}But you don't have to move|your hips like the merengue, okay?
{11255}{11320}I know, sometimes we just can't help it.
{11325}{11354}Let's do a quick merengue.
{11357}{11423}- Yeah!|- All right, here we go. Dance position.
{11485}{11592}Five, six, five, six, seven, eight.
{11933}{11964}What's your favorite dance?
{11966}{12025}My favorite dance is the merengue.|It's mad hot.
{12027}{12106}I know, I move my hips|and Miss Reynoso is, like...
{12109}{12165}"You good, you good," and I like that.
{12168}{12228}Yeah, me too. I like moving my hips a lot.
{12230}{12306}When I first got there, I didn't know|that we had to dance with boys.
{12309}{12392}But I wasn't really so afraid of that.
{12395}{12448}"Oh, my God,|a boy is going to touch me, wow."
{12450}{12505}'Cause I know it's just to dance.
{12510}{12548}It's not to do anything else.
{12554}{12560}That's what I hate, girls.
{12560}{12590}That's what I hate, girls.
{12593}{12701}I know, girls always think they're the|boss of everything and they're the best.
{12704}{12753}And always be like, "Okay. Uh?"
{12776}{12848}And you know what I hate?|When girls decide, when girls, like...
{12850}{12898}They think they're not allowed|to like the boys.
{12900}{12969}The boys have to like the girls|before they can like them.
{12971}{13040}Whenever I'm dancing with Emma|she tries to lead me 'cause she...
{13042}{13138}- Dancing with Emma?|- In ballroom dancing.
{13141}{13183}- Ballroom dancing.|- Yeah.
{13306}{13329}{y:i}No.
{13397}{13433}No, not yet.
{13436}{13518}Of course, we do have, like, our crushes|here and there, but you know...
{13532}{13636}nobody actually|went out on a date somewhere.
{13701}{13758}But I do know that boys think about girls...
{13772}{13825}'cause I have a lot of guy friends...
{13847}{13889}and that's what they think about.
{13891}{13930}- Hold up, let me do this.|- No, it's not right.
{14075}{14113}Tell me, please.
{14126}{14172}What color are your partner's eyes?
{14174}{14212}Don't look at her.
{14214}{14257}Greenish blue?
{14259}{14344}Okay, let's check it out. Yeah.
{14367}{14413}- What's your name?|- John.
{14415}{14522}John, would you please tell me|about her eyes, anything?
{14524}{14570}No, no, no, tell me.
{14576}{14605}They're just brown.
{14607}{14645}- Just brown?|- It's brown.
{14648}{14720}And beautiful. Look. She has beautiful eyes.
{14722}{14808}Ladies and gentlemen,|let me show you one little trick.
{15063}{15135}You see, very, very helpful.
{15138}{15223}So, let's use this trick.|Eye-to-eye connection.
{15226}{15256}I'm serious.
{15258}{15321}Take a look at each other|like last time in your life.
{15323}{15373}Take your parallel position, please.
{15402}{15449}Okay, what's the problem?
{15486}{15520}Take your partners.
{15522}{15618}And now, listen to me. Look at your partner.
{15871}{15949}Five, six, five, six, seven.
{15952}{16046}And, one, two, three, four, five, six.
{16053}{16142}One, two, close your fingers, four, five, six.
{16147}{16232}One, two, three, four, five, six.
{16237}{16318}One, two, three, four, five, six.
{16326}{16364}Quick, quick, slow.
{16372}{16401}Quick, quick, slow.
{16404}{16477}Look at that attitude. Look at that attitude|on that face. I love that.
{16480}{16514}Five, six.
{16517}{16595}One, two, three, four, five, six.
{16609}{16669}One, two, three, look at this attitude.
{16672}{16704}I love this attitude right here, too.
{16706}{16783}One, two, three, four, five, six.
{16979}{17012}One, two, three...
{17014}{17053}{y:i}You know, I feel bad for some of the boys.
{17056}{17122}{y:i}'Cause you can tell that these boys|{y:i}have never danced before.
{17125}{17201}It's like, when I was younger,|I used to dance a lot...
{17204}{17277}and then, there's a saying that says,|"If you don't dance..."
{17316}{17369}That means, you know, you didn't|get to dance when you were younger.
{17372}{17457}So, you know, that's why I like|this program so much...
{17459}{17527}because those children that, unfortunately...
{17530}{17616}didn't get an opportunity to dance|like I did when I was younger...
{17618}{17665}are getting it now. And then, you know...
{17667}{17768}when they get into high school|or have to invite that girl to a prom...
{17770}{17845}you know, they'll know how to dance,|at least how to move.
{17848}{17901}Maybe this is just an avenue opening up...
{17903}{17961}for them to go into something|that has to do with the arts.
{17963}{18035}And, who knows, maybe they do have it|in them and this will bring it out.
{18038}{18130}You don't know what's hidden|inside each child until you open it up.
{18938}{18985}Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
{18987}{19070}Good afternoon, Miss Victoria.
{19073}{19143}Follow me. Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
{19146}{19193}Today we're going to start a new dance.
{19226}{19292}Does anyone want to guess|what the new dance is? Yeah.
{19294}{19326}- Yo-yo.|- Electric slide?
{19329}{19391}Electric slide? It's a ballroom dance.
{19394}{19421}- Ronnie?|- The swing?
{19424}{19480}The swing. Very good, now...
{19491}{19546}what country do you think|the swing started in?
{19549}{19612}We know it really well, I'll give you a hint.
{19622}{19684}- What do you think, Michael?|- Africa?
{19686}{19758}- Africa? It's a good guess. Guess again.|- United States?
{19760}{19846}Yes, very good, Taha,|the United States of America.
{19874}{19914}Lean on your front foot.
{19917}{19965}Put all your body weight on your front foot.
{19967}{20044}We're gonna change our weight now.|Ready, go back.
{20046}{20090}Back, front. Say it with me.
{20093}{20174}Back, front. Say it again. Back, front.
{20177}{20212}Again, back, front.
{20282}{20315}Faster!
{20372}{20408}Okay. Taha?
{20417}{20448}Number 10.
{20466}{20521}Am I supposed to jump that much?
{20525}{20582}Watch what happens. It's very small.
{20585}{20629}I just want a walking step.
{20632}{20673}Walk, walk again...
{20675}{20775}We can't dance at all|because it's against my religion...
{20790}{20861}and it's also against his religion, too.
{20878}{20952}And, so far, I like being a DJ.
{20958}{21051}I think it's good because|everyone is nice to me.
{21057}{21096}They don't care if I'm...
{21165}{21215}from another country.
{21227}{21288}Look, this is how you do a pull. Okay?
{21300}{21386}It's like you both separate each other,|but you still have your hands.
{21389}{21448}Like a rubber band when you stretch it,|okay?
{21462}{21549}Taha, could we try the next swing song?|I think it's number 11.
{21551}{21617}Pick up the phone, switch to B.
{21628}{21678}Miss Verdemare knows the swing.
{21681}{21756}Listen! This rhythm is faster.
{21758}{21806}This rhythm is faster. In, out.
{21809}{21846}{y:i}I think it's really important for the kids.
{21849}{21908}I think it's much more|than learning a bunch of steps.
{21910}{21990}And I think it's much more than|just a part of physical education.
{21993}{22070}It's not at all just that. It's etiquette.
{22073}{22151}{y:i}It's knowledge of other cultures.
{22154}{22184}{y:i}It's life.
{22186}{22217}Excellent.
{22246}{22317}The strange thing about being a girl...
{22319}{22415}- Is that your hair is so long?|- No. That you have to be pregnant.
{22432}{22497}- What?|- You have to have a baby. It's hard.
{22500}{22544}I heard in a book about...
{22546}{22583}It's called "Why It's Great to be a Girl."
{22586}{22668}That women, overall,|judging by scientific research...
{22671}{22720}are the more advanced civilization.
{22726}{22810}- Oh, yeah. That's good.|- Even though that makes perfect sense.
{22819}{22857}Girls, they're all right.
{22885}{22943}I judge by their outer beauty|and their inner beauty.
{22953}{22976}Both.
{22979}{23038}Mostly their inner beauty.
{23054}{23093}Mostly their outer beauty.
{23096}{23146}- Do you like any of the girls in the class?|- No.
{23149}{23212}- As a girlfriend.|- No.
{23214}{23308}- As a friend.|- I like in Miss Conte's class, Marissa.
{23310}{23373}- Yes, okay.|- Now, she's hot!
{23545}{23568}Okay.
{24050}{24103}Now, I'm not in the mood for boys.
{24106}{24177}I'm, like, in the mood|for studying and everything...
{24180}{24248}for dancing, for school...
{24250}{24309}and for family and everything.
{24311}{24361}But, I'm not in the mood for boys now.
{24363}{24429}When I'm big,|I'm gonna be in the mood for boys.
{24450}{24509}I like to be with a guy that, like...
{24527}{24577}he's concentrated in school.
{24636}{24709}That he wants to make something|out of his life.
{24711}{24782}- A guy that doesn't sell drugs.|- Yeah.
{24784}{24868}A guy that... I know that|he's gonna have a good future.
{24870}{24894}Yeah.
{24897}{24936}And a guy that respects people.
{24938}{25001}- Respects you.|- And respects me...
{25003}{25063}- and have a good education.|- Yeah.
{25404}{25466}Five, six.
{25491}{25533}Quick, quick, one.
{25535}{25576}Quick, quick, two.
{25578}{25622}Quick, quick, three.
{25784}{25814}Not bad.
{25937}{25972}Stationary.
{25996}{26043}Ladies, show them off, please.
{26057}{26092}Say, "Cheese."
{26318}{26385}Ladies, you're doing an excellent job.
{26387}{26412}Excellent.
{26414}{26482}But you could do a brilliant job...
{26513}{26596}if you will just listen to me right now|and imitate what I'm doing.
{26599}{26667}Look at my watch. Watch!
{26686}{26758}Crown, up, hairstyle.
{26776}{26827}Let's try it, please. One more time.
{27014}{27057}Ladies, please.
{27070}{27137}Good. Very good girl.
{27190}{27242}Sometimes we feel uncomfortable...
{27245}{27297}when Alex comes to dance with us.
{27299}{27353}- Why?|- 'Cause he's older.
{27411}{27462}He's, like, 50 years old!
{27465}{27542}One thing that's really annoying is,|this is especially if you're a girl...
{27545}{27594}is if your partner doesn't know|the dance very well...
{27597}{27639}and they're supposed to lead.
{27642}{27698}And it's just kind of like...
{27701}{27734}They don't do anything!
{27737}{27800}- Sometimes I feel them pull...|- Sometimes you pull us!
{27802}{27872}- Yeah, but they go the wrong way.|- Sometimes you guys go the wrong way.
{27874}{27923}Sometimes you guys go the wrong way, too.
{27926}{28005}How do you think we will feel|by the time competition is here?
{28012}{28109}Three of us thought we would be|nervous and excited and stuff.
{28112}{28178}And then Richard got up|and just killed himself.
{28181}{28244}- What?|- Richard said he'd kill himself.
{28258}{28313}So, Richard, what made you|say something like that?
{28315}{28365}'Cause I don't like ballroom dancing.
{28379}{28431}I'll kill myself so I don't have to go.
{28434}{28511}You know, why do you dislike|ballroom dancing so much?
{28514}{28549}Because I don't like it.
{28551}{28608}So now that competition|has been brought up...
{28610}{28643}how do you guys feel about this?
{28646}{28711}If you practice a lot,|you're practicing a-lot-lot, and it's like...
{28714}{28789}"Oh, yeah, I'm really doing well,|I'm probably going to get in."
{28791}{28828}Then you find out you're not getting in.
{28830}{28930}Then you're, like, really sad that you've done|all this practice, but you didn't get in.
{28954}{28994}We have to make sure that...
{28997}{29080}when we are chosen for the competition...
{29082}{29167}that the people who are chosen...
{29178}{29249}don't boast and brag about it|'cause it's gonna make the other people...
{29252}{29313}feel like they're worthless.
{29315}{29368}So, I just wanted to say that.
{29382}{29454}Five, six, ready, go.
{29464}{29541}Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow.
{29545}{29603}Slow, quick, quick, slow.
{29611}{29671}Slow, quick, quick, in.
{29674}{29760}In, and out, around. Slow, around.
{29802}{29825}Glide.
{29854}{29883}I can't.
{29933}{29965}Eye-to-eye.
{30037}{30094}Around, very good.
{30726}{30813}Very good. Gentlemen, what are you|supposed to do at the end of a dance?
{30816}{30878}- What do you do at the end of a dance?|- You bow.
{30881}{30955}You turn the lady|and you give her a little bow, all right?
{30958}{31036}Okay, so we're going to go to Argentina.
{31046}{31098}- Argentina.|- Argentina.
{31120}{31154}- To dance the what?|- The tango.
{31156}{31192}The tango, that's right.
{31202}{31307}T-A-N, outside.
{31310}{31341}Let's do it together.
{31343}{31417}Five, six, begin with your left.
{31431}{31488}T-A-N...
{31490}{31605}{y:i}Last year, we won gold,|{y:i}but there was one final competition...
{31607}{31698}that involved a huge, huge, giant trophy.
{31701}{31737}And we didn't get it.
{31740}{31793}But this year I want that trophy.
{31796}{31855}It's like Susan Lucci,|"I want that Emmy." I want that trophy.
{31858}{31886}Even if it's once and that's it.
{31889}{31941}Just one time and that's it.|I won't bother you anymore.
{31949}{32001}Six, seven, go.
{32012}{32130}T-A-N-G-O. And, T-A.
{32166}{32267}Again, and, T-A-N-G-O.
{32458}{32496}All right, cool.
{32555}{32598}- You all right?|- I don't feel so good.
{32601}{32624}What's wrong with you?
{32627}{32651}My tummy hurts.
{32654}{32696}Your tummy hurts?|Well, the period's almost over.
{32698}{32734}You go see the nurse after class, all right?
{32737}{32774}Do you think you can wait for two minutes?
{32777}{32838}Wait for two minutes|and then go see the nurse, okay?
{32846}{32877}All right, here we go.
{32984}{33036}Rodney, weren't they tired?
{33050}{33113}They were a second ago.
{33115}{33213}Five, six, five, six.
{33215}{33263}Five, six, seven, and...
{33322}{33371}All my tired students.
{33374}{33424}Look how tired you guys are.
{33598}{33674}Go out first. Out, cross, turn it around.
{33860}{33919}Come on, go!
{34216}{34292}When I see people outside|selling drugs and stuff, I feel bad.
{34294}{34366}Because they missing|such a big part of life, you know.
{34369}{34418}They got the opportunity|to go to college and stuff...
{34421}{34481}and, I mean, some people|don't have the opportunity.
{34484}{34518}They just wasting...
{34521}{34578}But sometimes, it's not all their fault.
{34581}{34613}It's like their parents...
{34615}{34682}- they don't care that much about them.|- They don't take care of them.
{34685}{34780}And since they... Their parents don't take|care of them the way they're supposed to...
{34783}{34870}they think, "I might get into a gang.|They just care for me, you know?
{34873}{34947}"And I'll get some drugs.|And this is the right path," you know.
{34955}{34991}And it's not only their fault.
{34994}{35093}There's some young girls|that they be in the streets...
{35095}{35162}'cause either they don't have a father|or they don't have a mother...
{35165}{35197}and they need both on their side.
{35200}{35290}So, like, if their parents have|some problems, try to keep it together...
{35293}{35374}so your daughter or your son can be good.
{35382}{35442}But if somebody cheats...
{35445}{35485}like my father did, no offense...
{35488}{35561}but, my father cheated on my mom,|like, four years ago.
{35564}{35640}Now I got a step-little-brother, he's four.
{35642}{35714}I'm always telling my mom to leave him.
{35716}{35816}"Mommy," I'm like, "I'm sorry,|but if my father's cheating on you...
{35818}{35897}"You should leave him,|'cause I don't want you to cry...
{35899}{35931}"and stuff just 'cause of him."
{35934}{36001}Thanks to God, my parents are none of that.
{36004}{36057}My parents are cool with me.
{36059}{36109}They cool with each other.|They haven't got separated.
{36111}{36156}They haven't fight or nothing. That's cool.
{36389}{36429}Okay, my turn.
{36564}{36618}T-A-N-G-O.
{36794}{36880}Five, six, ready, begin.
{36891}{36973}T-A-N-G-O.
{37058}{37143}And, T-A, step right, left.
{37191}{37239}Now that's it. Go backwards.
{37242}{37319}T-A-N-G. Again!
{37326}{37413}T-A-N, promenade.
{37415}{37494}- T, tango faces.|- N-G-O.
{37502}{37559}T-A-N-G.
{37562}{37611}Gentlemen, where's my tango face?
{37614}{37671}A-N-G-O.
{37674}{37749}T-A-N-G-O.
{37794}{37866}Make believe, everyone,|when you're doing tango.
{37869}{37933}You're imitating some cat moves.
{37960}{38007}Very, very sneaky ways.
{38476}{38511}It's my fault?
{38759}{38810}Michael, step right.
{38846}{38882}That was terrible.
{38895}{38980}Time for surprise partner, surprise dance.
{38982}{39013}Everybody sit.
{39095}{39145}Okay. Wilson and Katherine.
{39386}{39448}Your feet are not together, Katherine.
{39498}{39586}Five, six, ready, begin.
{39702}{39775}{y:i}This boy that I've had my eye on,|{y:i}his name's Wilson.
{39778}{39825}{y:i}He's developing into a very good dancer.
{39828}{39863}{y:i}He doesn't know the language...
{39866}{39925}{y:i}but he fits right in because|{y:i}everybody's supporting him.
{39928}{39982}{y:i}And I see him in the process|{y:i}of learning these dances...
{39985}{40032}{y:i}he's also learning the language.
{40034}{40104}{y:i}I'm also looking at Katherine,|{y:i}but I still have my doubts.
{40106}{40150}{y:i}I'm not too sure yet.
{40287}{40342}- Surprise, surprise.|- Surprise, surprise.
{40382}{40413}You and...
{40470}{40553}Okay, this is the last one,|because we're out of time.
{40594}{40697}Five, six, five, six, ready, go. And one.
{41060}{41119}{y:i}It's tough,|{y:i}because everybody wants to compete.
{41122}{41188}{y:i}But we want to have a sturdy team...
{41190}{41257}{y:i}not only to make me proud,|{y:i}but for themselves.
{41259}{41350}{y:i}And to represent their school|{y:i}and to represent their country.
{41353}{41400}{y:i}You know, I think pride in themselves.|{y:i}Pride that...
{41402}{41469}{y:i}"Look, we're Dominicans,|{y:i}we're here, we're competing.
{41472}{41521}{y:i}'And, you know, we're good. "
{41611}{41658}Very nice, very nice.
{41670}{41702}Escort position.
{41712}{41741}Good-bye.
{41962}{42051}- How'd you do in social?|- I don't know.
{42054}{42110}- There was "4" 1 questions in it.|- Okay.
{42113}{42165}On Friday, that's all I know.
{42210}{42237}Hello?
{42274}{42372}Yo, Mike, who do you think|the best dancers are? Me, you or Delano?
{42384}{42422}I think it would be you.
{42425}{42458}Really, I think it would be you.
{42461}{42505}- 'Cause you get into it more.|- Yeah, like...
{42508}{42547}Like, me, most of the time...
{42550}{42644}sometimes I get very, like,|mopey and confused.
{42646}{42701}{y:i}You just get right into it|{y:i}and know everything.
{42703}{42738}{y:i}- Yeah, 'cause, like...|{y:i}- You remember all...
{42740}{42813}{y:i}It's really fun,|{y:i}and how can you forget a fun time?
{42815}{42888}{y:i}I think that once you get to dance,|{y:i}you feel so nice...
{42890}{42954}and fine, then, and you get energized.
{42957}{43063}It's like a sport|that hasn't been invented into a sport.
{43066}{43144}Tracy? Do you like Michael as a partner?
{43146}{43213}- Well...|- He's a little smaller than you, right?
{43216}{43267}I wasn't comfortable at him first.
{43270}{43297}What about you?
{43300}{43364}I have to dance with Daniel,|I don't like him.
{43366}{43411}- Why?|- Because...
{43414}{43474}He's so sloppy. He's sloppy chicken-wings.
{43477}{43540}Yeah, and then he tried to bite my neck.
{43601}{43671}Sometimes people don't like dancing|with Johnny...
{43685}{43746}just because he's chubby.|Well, that don't matter.
{43749}{43793}He's just a person.
{43802}{43878}Some people from the group|of dancers, they're better than me.
{43881}{43940}So, I don't know if they'll pick me.
{43956}{44009}I'm trying hard for I can be in it...
{44018}{44078}but I don't know if they'll pick me.
{44108}{44174}Like, the most important thing|is just, like, learning the dances...
{44177}{44213}and knowing how to do them.
{44216}{44286}So I'm not that psyched|about the competition.
{44289}{44322}I always think about it.
{44325}{44389}And sometimes, if I don't do the steps...
{44392}{44457}I just go over them in my mind,|even if I'm not doing them.
{44460}{44544}'Cause I really wanna be|in this competition...
{44546}{44607}so I'm training my hardest to get in.
{44610}{44718}One thing I realized is that boys that|are normally rowdy and kind of rough...
{44721}{44777}that it really shows a different side to them.
{44779}{44857}Like, they can be very, very understanding|and very gentle.
{44860}{44896}If you really think about it...
{44898}{44997}ballroom dancing is like this tiny, little thing.
{45003}{45045}A tiny little grain of sand...
{45048}{45104}if you count the entire country.
{45114}{45179}I don't know if I could get|into the competition...
{45182}{45216}but I know what I might wear.
{45218}{45281}Which dress are you gonna wear? The...
{45285}{45324}That's a cute one.
{45402}{45474}That's a great dress,|especially, like, if you do swing.
{45476}{45572}This is the swing, it's a basic to the swing.
{45812}{45851}Listen to the music.
{45854}{45898}Change partners.
{45913}{45962}Five, change.
{46406}{46448}- Pick up the partner.|- I can't, I don't know...
{46450}{46479}Anyone.
{46482}{46509}- I don't know.|- John.
{46511}{46588}Anyone. Look, look. Okay.
{46619}{46679}Invite her. Ask her.
{46823}{46863}Thank you very much.
{46866}{46895}It was very good.
{46898}{46962}We have one more hour before competition.
{46986}{47022}What?
{47098}{47147}Let me explain what I mean.
{47155}{47250}We have to, myself and Allison...
{47253}{47350}choose five couples|and one substitute couple...
{47358}{47422}to represent P.S. 150...
{47425}{47491}in the quarterfinal competition next week.
{47507}{47586}Quickly, let me remind you|what did we learn in this room?
{47589}{47645}What is ballroom dancing about?
{47648}{47764}Ballroom dancing, it's a dialogue|in between a lady and a gentleman.
{47775}{47853}Gentlemen, you're taking|care about your partner...
{47856}{47928}and your main function during any dance...
{47945}{48037}you have to at least try to make her happy.
{48057}{48150}I really would love not to be involved|in this process because...
{48205}{48302}I mean, they're all my kids|and, just, I don't want to choose favorites.
{48305}{48412}I don't want to pick one over the other|'cause I don't want to hurt anyone.
{48415}{48510}I wish all the kids could just pair up|and compete in ballroom dancing.
{48512}{48601}That would be the best way.|I need to turn around right now.
{48617}{48666}I hear a lot of whispering.
{48712}{48764}Just a couple more minutes.
{48815}{48863}I see them turning into...
{48873}{48917}I'm gonna cry...
{49111}{49189}Then I see them turning|into, like, these ladies and gentlemen.
{50184}{50207}Got it?
{50265}{50315}{y:i}Rock and roll, babe.
{50363}{50403}It's fun being 10.
{50406}{50493}'Cause when you 10, you like to play more...
{50495}{50558}be children again. Still be children...
{50561}{50613}and everything, have fun playing.
{50621}{50666}Something that scares me about my age...
{50669}{50723}is that, like, the body that I have...
{50726}{50799}every time there's drunk people there,|and I pass with my mother...
{50802}{50851}they look at me very weird.|And I get kind of scared...
{50854}{50913}'cause there's some drunk men,|they could do anything to you.
{50915}{50965}Especially girls that they never know...
{50967}{51025}they could be older and they have already|their body shaped.
{51028}{51106}When you're 11, your parents don't let you|go outside alone...
{51109}{51178}because they still think|that you're a little kid.
{51187}{51250}But, when you're 12,|they let you have freedom.
{51253}{51288}At least a little bit of freedom.
{51291}{51331}You gotta start putting deodorant.
{51334}{51413}- You gotta start washing two times a day.|- Oh, yeah.
{51416}{51453}Yeah, that is kind of weird.
{51456}{51508}You start growing hair in weird places.
{51510}{51563}And you don't change your sheets|because you peed.
{51566}{51624}And also, did you know|that 11-year-old girls...
{51626}{51678}are the number one target for kidnappers?
{51681}{51733}- It's really kind of...|- What are kidnappers?
{51735}{51761}Kidnappers.
{51764}{51816}11-year-old girls are the number one target.
{51818}{51878}For, like, sick people who like little girls.
{51910}{51999}I find hard would be school, sometimes...
{52002}{52090}that you have to learn|these new, really hard things...
{52093}{52144}and the teachers sometimes|don't even understand it.
{52146}{52171}Not hard...
{52174}{52221}- what's weird in your lives?|- Weird?
{52224}{52308}How, like, how people think.
{52318}{52430}Like, marriage, parts of marriage is weird.
{52433}{52501}Like gay marriage,|how they been talking about.
{52504}{52541}- Yeah, like...|- I don't think that's right.
{52544}{52660}...in the Bible,|it said people can get married.
{52662}{52701}- It didn't say, like, what kind of people.|- Yeah.
{52701}{52708}- It didn't say, like, what kind of people.|- Yeah.
{52710}{52776}- I don't know why.|- You don't have that hard math book?
{52778}{52808}'Cause that was...
{52810}{52846}Hate books.
{53154}{53178}Like this?
{53487}{53537}{y:i}Brooklyn quarterfinal|{y:i}on Monday and Tuesday.
{53537}{53572}{y:i}Brooklyn quarterfinal|{y:i}on Monday and Tuesday.
{53574}{53656}The quarterfinals for Manhattan|are Wednesday and Thursday.
{53658}{53729}Let's start discussing|the Rainbow Team Match.
{53731}{53803}What is required with regards to judging?
{53816}{53893}First and foremost, they have to be on time.
{53896}{53961}And not just as soon as|they hear the music, they just go.
{53964}{54048}Secondly is the dancing hold,|the dance frame.
{54068}{54139}And then, you've got Cuban motion dances.
{54148}{54208}If they're able to use Cuban motion.
{54211}{54323}They get better points, of course,|if they are standing nice and tall.
{54334}{54428}How do you deal now with the teams...
{54430}{54492}who do not make it to the semifinal?
{54498}{54537}I think one way of doing it is...
{54540}{54588}make a big deal at the school afterwards...
{54591}{54632}that, "Oh, this team has been successful.
{54634}{54708}"They've achieved the bronze level|and that they've gotten that far."
{54710}{54805}I also know for a fact that|it is part of learning for life...
{54807}{54877}preparing yourself for life.|It's not bad not to make it.
{54879}{54921}You know, you can say whatever you like.
{54923}{54965}You either win or you lose.
{54970}{55013}Okay, and if you haven't got number one...
{55016}{55110}then you have not won, you have not lost.|I mean, you've not won, you've lost.
{55113}{55159}No matter how much you want to quit...|Sorry?
{55162}{55206}Second place is the first loser.
{55218}{55267}And he knows from experience.
{55342}{55387}Let's do tango, please.
{55606}{55644}Forte now.
{55783}{55830}Promenade, please.
{56122}{56202}{y:i}There's something special|{y:i}about seeing a man dancing...
{56205}{56250}{y:i}and teaching dance in that environment.
{56253}{56324}And it brings the boys along.
{56345}{56427}Yeah, because you don't really have,|nowadays, we don't have...
{56430}{56501}like a Fred Astaire or a Gene Kelly|necessarily as a role model.
{56504}{56547}{y:i}That's from a former generation.
{56550}{56597}{y:i}And they see us very much|{y:i}as like a father figure...
{56600}{56644}{y:i}or maybe an older-brother figure.
{56646}{56711}{y:i}And so, I think it's important|{y:i}especially for some of the guys...
{56714}{56796}{y:i}to have that kind of validation|{y:i}from an older male figure...
{56798}{56884}{y:i}in a competitive venue, because if you're|{y:i}cheering them on, you're rooting them on...
{56886}{56971}{y:i}maybe they don't have|{y:i}that kind of encouragement at home.
{58365}{58422}Give me a two. One, and place.
{58438}{58458}Place.
{58461}{58505}Give me one. Shake it.
{58507}{58576}Shake your hair. Shake your hair all around.
{58650}{58688}Take a good bow.
{58754}{58802}Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
{58805}{58844}I know what you're all waiting for.
{58846}{58916}Time to make the announcement, okay,|and it's been very difficult.
{58918}{58959}Ms. Freij and I have been spending|a lot of time...
{58962}{58994}talking and really looking carefully.
{58997}{59030}We have a lot of classes to pick from.
{59033}{59104}And you're all doing a terrific job.|Everyone's working very hard.
{59106}{59211}So, this is what we'd like to... People that|we'd like to ask to be in the competition.
{59214}{59278}We'd like to ask Jai-Wen.|Miss Jai-Wen, raise your hand.
{59281}{59339}Let's give a round of applause to Jai-Wen.
{59342}{59406}Also, Ariel. Raise your hand, Ariel.
{59409}{59464}Raise your hand. And Michael.
{59466}{59532}Where's Michael? Raise your hand.
{59694}{59774}But then I really liked|watching him today with Emma.
{59784}{59892}Let's put Celia with Zeb.
{59910}{59996}And Willie with Briana.
{60069}{60111}Ladies and gentlemen.
{60122}{60200}Now, let us to announce...
{60204}{60305}who will represent P.S. 150.

{61002}{61042}we're going straight to the semifinals.
{61045}{61080}I don't know who yet.
{61083}{61128}But, you know, you'll know soon enough.
{61130}{61206}So I want to see who looks...|You know, I want to see the old partners.
{61209}{61275}I want to see new kids with old kids...
{61278}{61326}and let's see how that works out.
{61329}{61381}I want to see some chemistry,|I want to see...
{61385}{61449}you know, if you look better|with another person.
{61457}{61539}You know, you have to, like, deserve it,|and you have to win.
{61542}{61650}Win... This is not, like, you know, I can|misbehave and then just not, you know...
{61656}{61725}Okay. Jonathan.
{61728}{61785}You're here on a trial basis.
{61797}{61849}You did something very wrong.
{61851}{61946}And I think that you should say|something in front of everybody.
{61949}{62003}Or else you're not practicing.
{62013}{62089}You decide how bad you want it.|It's not funny.
{62116}{62187}Is it happening?|Or you can just leave right now.
{62203}{62236}I'm sorry.
{62238}{62312}- No, not like that, like...|- Sorry about what?
{62338}{62371}- Go ahead.|- I'm sorry.
{62374}{62456}Wilson, he's talking to you.
{62485}{62508}Okay.
{62511}{62544}Take off your jacket.
{62552}{62600}No, it's only us two. No.
{62658}{62722}Five, six, ready, begin.
{63342}{63380}Clap for me.
{63407}{63430}I won.
{63458}{63481}Who won?
{63486}{63533}- Karina.|- Yeah.
{63539}{63581}Okay, let's go.
{64153}{64211}- Do we get medals?|- You get medals and a goody bag.
{64214}{64237}Goody bag!
{64239}{64304}I'm gonna have to check|what's in that goody bag, because maybe l...
{64993}{65052}Break a leg, everyone! Break a leg!
{65366}{65439}Two, three, P.S. 150!
{65905}{65970}Escort your new partner.|Come here, come here.
{65978}{66033}Other side, other side.
{66063}{66107}There you go. Come on.
{66261}{66303}Bring her over here.
{66453}{66532}Boys and girls, we're going to start|our competition right now.
{66534}{66603}Michael, it doesn't matter how tall,|they're really good.
{66698}{66758}{y:i}It is a great pleasure, once again this year...
{66761}{66832}{y:i}to be hosting the quarterfinal...
{66837}{66913}{y:i}and all you beautiful|{y:i}young ladies and young gentlemen...
{66915}{66988}{y:i}have achieved|{y:i}a wonderful level of dancing...
{66990}{67041}{y:i}just by being here today.
{67150}{67212}{y:i}And so, without any further ado.
{67214}{67251}{y:i}For the first round...
{67254}{67354}{y:i}may I please ask each merengue team,|{y:i}come on the floor first?
{67640}{67676}{y:i}Five, six, go!
{67924}{67969}Green, green, green!
{68197}{68247}{y:i}It's wonderful that we learned|{y:i}how to do the dances.
{68250}{68324}{y:i}But, also, in a way it's brought|{y:i}our relationships and friendships...
{68326}{68365}{y:i}a little bit closer.
{68368}{68457}{y:i}Hopefully, it'll come in use|{y:i}when I've married.
{68477}{68559}{y:i}Which will be a very, very long time|{y:i}from now. I hope.
{68989}{69056}{y:i}Tango. Tango team.
{69098}{69140}- Go Michael!|- Michael!
{69145}{69195}{y:i}You ain't seen nothing yet!
{69331}{69367}Ready, go!
{69380}{69455}T-A-N-G-O.
{69470}{69501}T-A.
{70420}{70531}{y:i}It was easy, kind of, 'cause you hear|{y:i}pink, yellow, and everybody.
{70534}{70607}{y:i}You're just concentrating on your partner|{y:i}and all the songs.
{70610}{70651}{y:i}Then you hear the crowd beating...
{70654}{70735}{y:i}so you wanna just win. You wanna have fun.
{70982}{71033}Take a big hand! Take a bow!
{71114}{71199}{y:i}And now we're going to have|{y:i}our swing teams on the floor!
{71495}{71544}{y:i}Five, six, ready, go!
{72012}{72077}{y:i}I wanna, like, you know, be a dancer.
{72082}{72123}{y:i}Yeah, exactly. As a career.
{72134}{72230}Like, I wanna be a singer who acts...
{72240}{72303}and dances during her concerts.
{72322}{72388}You know, just combine them all together.
{72485}{72528}It all happens there.
{72737}{72834}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen, we are now|{y:i}going to go to Cuba for the rumba!
{72955}{73024}{y:i}Five, six, ready, go!
{73042}{73077}{y:i}Quick, quick, slow.
{73433}{73536}{y:i}You feel like even if you're gonna lose,|{y:i}you've gotten this far. You're this good.
{73538}{73586}{y:i}So it shows that you're actually good|{y:i}at something...
{73588}{73621}{y:i}and that you've proved something.
{73623}{73677}{y:i}It's not that I want to prove something|{y:i}to anyone.
{73680}{73755}{y:i}I wanted to prove it to myself,|{y:i}that I can actually do this.
{74495}{74521}Let's see. Okay, over here.
{74528}{74567}Let's check over here. Girls, over here.
{74570}{74600}That's cute.
{74602}{74649}It's nice, but I don't like this.
{74707}{74747}- Do you like it, yes or no?|- No.
{74750}{74803}- Why not, why not?|- It's too glittery.
{74806}{74854}It's too much.
{74870}{74927}Do you like this one? I don't like black.
{74930}{74961}What you got there?
{74983}{75010}Let me see.
{75013}{75069}Yeah, I don't know if I'm liking this...
{75078}{75137}- Look at this.|- No, not like that.
{75139}{75196}What about sailor?|I'm Popeye, the sailor man?
{75198}{75260}- Too flowery.|- No, too many flowers.
{75263}{75288}A botanical garden.
{75290}{75318}Oh, that's nice. Look.
{75321}{75368}It's all right, but no.
{75371}{75451}We always find our clothes here|and I don't want to leave without...
{75466}{75512}That's beautiful. Girls?
{75539}{75583}Of course, see anything...
{75586}{75624}that you think you gonna have|your bellybutton out?
{75626}{75662}No, that's not happening.
{75665}{75706}Try that on. You two try it on.
{75720}{75780}Does it look like it's gonna fall off?
{75852}{75893}Well, if we find a shirt that looks nice...
{75895}{75949}because you're not gonna have|your bellybutton out.
{75970}{76011}That's something. Let's see. I don't know.
{76225}{76288}Look at the side, look at the side, look.
{77002}{77035}{y:i}Take a bow.
{77156}{77257}{y:i}All right. May I please have...
{77266}{77366}{y:i}the orange team in front of Miss Joanna?
{77377}{77453}{y:i}The pink team in front of Miss Victoria.
{77458}{77521}{y:i}And the green team in front of Miss...
{77527}{77572}{y:i}Escort position!
{77582}{77692}{y:i}You have all been awarded|{y:i}the silver level ribbon.
{77698}{77736}{y:i}Congratulations.
{77796}{77834}{y:i}Silver level.
{77897}{77973}{y:i}It is so close.
{78010}{78044}{y:i}It's unbelievable.
{78049}{78156}{y:i}The great thing is you all have silver level.
{78266}{78319}{y:i}May I have Mr. Alex?
{78386}{78442}{y:i}May I have Miss Lori?
{78500}{78557}{y:i}May I have all you dance teams...
{78559}{78627}{y:i}in escort position, facing your teacher.
{78670}{78707}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen.
{78710}{78779}{y:i}Everybody give these teams a big hand.
{78799}{78899}{y:i}They all have a silver level ribbon.
{78902}{78991}{y:i}Congratulations for our silver level winners.
{78994}{79027}{y:i}Well done.
{79128}{79242}{y:i}Once you've got your gift bag|{y:i}and your ribbon, kindly sit down.
{79370}{79416}{y:i}Now, ladies and gentlemen.
{79418}{79487}{y:i}Everybody, listen, please. If you don't mind.
{79518}{79581}{y:i}The pink, P.S. 11...
{79590}{79683}{y:i}P.S. 64 and P.S. 1, go to the semifinals.
{79896}{79943}It's okay.
{80121}{80178}Take a deep breath, right now.
{80222}{80267}You gotta take a deep breath.
{80274}{80326}Take it. It'll help you.
{80363}{80467}First off, every single one of you|did an amazing job.
{80469}{80519}And I'm so proud of you.
{80553}{80633}And I couldn't have asked anyone|better to do it than you guys.
{80641}{80697}All of you did an excellent job today.
{80700}{80814}And remember,|whatever you got from this program...
{80817}{80848}this is for the rest of your life.
{80850}{80913}Exactly! You're going to learn|from this experience.
{80943}{81040}Everybody should be glad|that they even went. Right?
{81045}{81105}Yeah, but we did everything they told us to.
{81108}{81180}I know you did and you did a wonderful job.
{81198}{81234}So, you gotta get up.
{81237}{81302}- You gotta rise above this.|- Come on, yeah.
{81321}{81398}See, I really don't know exactly, you know,|but you can see...
{81401}{81466}if you had three more points,|you would have got through.
{81479}{81540}You're 263, they're 265.
{81543}{81633}And the other team got 256,|so you really were very, very, very close.
{81682}{81752}I still really don't understand|and what happened.
{82409}{82459}{y:i}What do you think|{y:i}are the things to remember?
{82461}{82509}One thing? Hands together.
{82511}{82550}Second thing to remember?
{82565}{82607}- Stand straight?|- Stand straight.
{82609}{82677}- Smile.|- Smile. What else?
{82679}{82741}- Look at each other.|- Look at each other, smile.
{82744}{82783}What about your feet?
{82786}{82824}- Together.|- Feet together.
{82829}{82865}The movements are only...
{83004}{83029}Nobody look at me.
{83032}{83073}I don't want anybody looking at me.
{83076}{83135}After the tango "corte,"|people tend to look at me.
{83160}{83223}- Nobody look at me.|- Okay.
{83225}{83267}Why you looking that way, Jonathan?
{83333}{83365}Smile!
{83397}{83472}Even if you can't stand your partner,|but you're smiling.
{83474}{83534}"Oh, man, I don't like you,|but I'm smiling," right?
{83552}{83586}Right, Joshua?
{83613}{83693}"Oh, no, look at this girl,|but I'm still smiling," right?
{83702}{83792}Nobody's looking at Miss Reynoso. So you're|looking at your partner and you're smiling.
{83826}{83852}Yes!
{83859}{83913}Make it sharp. Sharp.
{83998}{84021}Pretty good.
{84043}{84079}Let me try another song.
{84132}{84205}You're tired? I'm sorry to hear that.
{84273}{84330}Five, six, ready, begin.
{84354}{84396}"La risa." Yeah.
{84544}{84602}I'm tired, but I'm going|to win this competition.
{84605}{84699}1, 2, 3, "4", 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
{84701}{84812}{y:i}I would say, I mean, I'm not rich,|{y:i}but I am a teacher and I'm making it.
{84816}{84876}{y:i}I just would like this for the children.
{84880}{84932}{y:i}You'd like them to be successful.
{84969}{85013}1, 2, 3, "4", 5, 6, 7, 8...
{85015}{85089}I wish there was a magical way|in which I can just...
{85092}{85151}go inside of all the kids...
{85160}{85232}and like Jeannie used to do and, like, blink.
{85237}{85317}{y:i}Like a little magic, "Okay,|{y:i}there, you'll be a perfect child.
{85320}{85367}{y:i}"You're gonna do|{y:i}whatever you're supposed to do.
{85369}{85424}{y:i}"You're gonna go the right way.|{y:i}You're gonna go to college. "
{85426}{85500}{y:i}And it's so difficult because you bring out|{y:i}these things to these children.
{85502}{85550}{y:i}You bring arts,|{y:i}you bring out all of these programs.
{85553}{85587}{y:i}And then a few years down the line...
{85589}{85635}{y:i}you'll see these kids out in the street and...
{85637}{85681}{y:i}That's not what we want for these kids.
{85684}{85757}But I have this drive and this passion|that I wish I could just...
{85760}{85812}get inside these kids|and, like, slap them and say...
{85814}{85876}"Here, you know, you're worth it,|you're an individual.
{85878}{85917}"You'll better yourself."
{85920}{85990}{y:i}But, you know, unfortunately,|{y:i}it doesn't work that way with everybody.
{85993}{86049}{y:i}And I can only do what I can.
{86097}{86200}Sexy, looking at your partner.|Look at him, he's gorgeous!
{86326}{86361}Stop moving your hands.
{86792}{86830}Okay, now everybody will sit.
{86844}{86888}As you're sitting, you're resting.
{86905}{86968}Jonathan, are you... Is there a problem?
{86971}{87026}Have you danced with Karina|so she can get her practice for today?
{87029}{87071}Only because you're tall?
{87085}{87135}It's okay. Go ahead, Karina and Jonathan.
{87137}{87173}No, no, no.
{87257}{87313}No? Why not?
{87374}{87430}You dance with all the other girls,|but not with Karina.
{87433}{87492}- For a reason.|- For a reason?
{87522}{87557}What was that reason?
{87577}{87622}That's how bad you want to be|in this competition...
{87625}{87677}that you can't dance|with the girls I pick for you?
{87762}{87843}Okay. Then I know what I'm doing.
{87877}{87916}Everybody, back up.
{87977}{88037}If you have a partner, come up. Jonathan?
{88129}{88181}Can't deal with it.|Either you dance or you don't.
{88184}{88233}- I don't.|- Good-bye.
{88987}{89034}Those sunflowers are big.
{89117}{89140}Peonies?
{89503}{89621}So, I was wondering if there's anything|that you guys want to share.
{89625}{89662}I'm indignant.
{89665}{89723}I don't care much about|winning or losing that much.
{89725}{89792}I mean, we dance, we have fun,|well, too bad if we lost.
{89794}{89892}But, I mean,|it's just that one of the teams...
{89936}{90041}the red team, it just didn't seem like that|they should be one of the gold levels.
{90043}{90111}I think the other schools danced horribly.
{90113}{90157}I mean, they were all jolty, and...
{90159}{90246}Listen, I don't want to, you know,|make comments about other schools.
{90249}{90351}I want you to think about us,|and think about what we did really well.
{90353}{90403}All along I tried explaining it to you...
{90405}{90453}it wasn't about the competition.
{90456}{90520}It was just about learning|the ballroom dancing.
{90522}{90572}Well, when I saw everyone dance...
{90575}{90664}well, I didn't think that anyone could|do any better than they did, like...
{90666}{90735}what we did, what we practiced,|that's all what we could do...
{90737}{90805}and if they don't see that|then that's their problem.
{90808}{90890}Everything that we learned, we did right.|We were smiling...
{90893}{91009}we were doing the moves right,|we had eye-to-eye connection...
{91012}{91059}we were focusing, we were having fun.
{91061}{91176}If we did so good, why didn't we go|to the semifinals or finals?
{91184}{91249}Because it's the judge's opinion, not ours.
{91252}{91273}All right.
{91275}{91333}It's their opinion|of what a good posture is...
{91335}{91381}and what good eye contact is.
{91383}{91461}And we might have been doing it|the way we learned.
{91463}{91560}But they didn't see it as the way|they learned it was supposed to be.
{91564}{91660}If everybody that was competing|could have done one thing...
{91668}{91706}a little bit better.
{91721}{91764}And I don't know.
{91766}{91805}I think you did the best that you could do.
{91808}{91857}- I know, that's in the past.|- It's in the past.
{91860}{91951}I just kind of felt, when I went away,|that I still could have done a little bit better.
{91953}{91985}Okay.
{92363}{92431}{y:i}But we did a lot of mistakes.
{92441}{92521}We did a lot of mistakes|and we still got in second place.
{92523}{92590}I think it should have been harder.|It was not too hard.
{92593}{92674}It was just like dancing|in a regular auditorium.
{92685}{92747}I liked the cheering, it gave me confidence.
{92749}{92816}At least I know, like,|someone wants us to win.
{92818}{92894}So, like, we could keep on dancing.
{92897}{92909}They make us practice and practice...
{92909}{92950}They make us practice and practice...
{92953}{93005}until we're sweating to death, or something.
{93008}{93083}And then they say,|"The competition is starting."
{93109}{93198}Then they had us dance with|a new partner that I'd never, ever seen.
{93232}{93300}It's like an alien. Dancing with an alien.
{93302}{93346}I was doing this. He said, "Stop."
{93349}{93446}The girl was like an adult.|She was, like, so tall! I'm like...
{93480}{93531}Hey, at least I'm having fun!
{93535}{93577}I think it was pretty good...
{93580}{93652}'cause I'm just glad|that we, like, didn't get bronze...
{93654}{93697}and I just had a lot of fun.
{93700}{93776}At least we got something.|It's not like we didn't get anything.
{93778}{93855}It was the best that we actually got|to that competition.
{93857}{93938}We could have got to the second|competition if we'd tried harder, but...
{93941}{94036}we just wanted to have fun. We didn't|want to try hard, we just wanted fun.
{94452}{94513}Okay, together. Let's go. Let's go.
{94513}{94537}Okay, together. Let's go. Let's go.
{95460}{95534}{y:i}Can we please start off|{y:i}with our merengue teams?
{95809}{95876}{y:i}All right. Now.
{95921}{95958}{y:i}Music, please.
{96117}{96196}Five, six. Go!
{96911}{97001}{y:i}I'm worried, because it's like|{y:i}our team is getting, like, so apart.
{97008}{97074}{y:i}And Angie, I heard she had some problems.
{97077}{97160}And that she might not go to compete.
{97162}{97241}- Three people that might not go: Kelvin...|- Kelvin don't want to dance with me.
{97243}{97266}Don't want to dance well?
{97269}{97303}She wants to put... She wants...
{97317}{97415}She wants Kelvin to dance foxtrot with you,|and Joshua to dance swing with me.
{97455}{97558}And my partner, I think he's being lazy.|Lazy, very lazy.
{97561}{97600}He's lazy, he doesn't like to do anything.
{97669}{97692}That's sad.
{97695}{97753}I hope that Miss Reynoso|and Miss Stephie fix this...
{97756}{97840}because then, if we don't fix this|by Wednesday, we're toast.
{97861}{97896}That is true.
{97923}{98041}And right now I'm feeling a little bit|not sure that we're gonna win.
{98046}{98088}- Me neither.|- Me neither.
{98584}{98623}{y:i}Take a bow!
{98721}{98810}{y:i}Thank you.|{y:i}Rumba teams on the floor, please.
{98981}{99057}{y:i}Five, six, ready, go!
{100123}{100181}{y:i}Just because... Do you see the look|{y:i}that I give to Wilson...
{100184}{100221}{y:i}when I'm doing the turn in the rumba?
{100224}{100279}Just because of that, I like him.
{100289}{100340}I let them think whatever they want.
{100343}{100403}- They just wanna talk.|- I feel sorry for him.
{100431}{100480}He don't even know English that much.
{100491}{100549}And you remember that Jonathan|that had to say sorry to him?
{100552}{100607}'Cause he said,|"Oh, you gay, whatever, whatever."
{100609}{100671}- And Miss Reynoso was like...|- She made him say sorry.
{100705}{100797}I think he's a very special person,|'cause he came in new.
{100800}{100876}- And he's going to the competition.|- And he's going to the competition.
{101077}{101145}{y:i}Take your bow, thank you.
{101205}{101244}{y:i}Swing!
{101381}{101417}{y:i}Wait for it.
{101529}{101587}{y:i}Five, six, ready, go!
{101836}{101911}{y:i}Didn't Miss Reynoso|{y:i}ask you, "What about the skirt?"
{101919}{101998}So, when you're dancing,|what you going to do?
{102011}{102060}- She didn't ask you?|- Yeah!
{102063}{102136}- What'd you say?|- I was like, "I'm gonna pick it up."
{102139}{102172}That was my answer.
{102174}{102217}What are you going to do?|Leave it on the floor?
{102220}{102273}- Dance naked? No.|- Pick it up.
{102284}{102321}She went like, "No!"
{102324}{102411}I'm gonna take it off and throw it|and keep dancing like that.
{102418}{102441}I'm like, "No."
{102444}{102486}And dance naked?
{102547}{102591}{y:i}Take a bow.
{102707}{102745}{y:i}All right.
{102781}{102814}Does that make sense?
{102817}{102868}This, this tango. Thank you very much.|You got it.
{102913}{102964}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen.
{103033}{103116}{y:i}The grand final is going to be...
{103122}{103160}{y:i}on Wednesday...
{103162}{103260}{y:i}at the World Financial Center's|{y:i}Winter Garden.
{103340}{103452}{y:i}I would like to have the yellow team...
{103455}{103519}{y:i}stand in front of Miss Madeline.
{103537}{103649}{y:i}The red team, stand in front of Miss Carol.
{103705}{103773}{y:i}Violet team in front of Mrs. Solomon.
{103797}{103837}{y:i}Escort position.
{103872}{103947}{y:i}Give them all a big hand|{y:i}for the bronze level!
{104025}{104084}{y:i}May I please have...
{104100}{104168}{y:i}the green team in front of Miss Carol?
{104181}{104261}{y:i}The emerald team in front of Miss Madeline.
{104293}{104359}{y:i}You have got the silver medal.
{104466}{104576}{y:i}The indigo team, the blue team|{y:i}and the orange team...
{104584}{104663}{y:i}good luck for the grand finals.|{y:i}Congratulations.
{104721}{104741}I don't know, but I think that|this competition, the last one...
{104741}{104795}I don't know, but I think that|this competition, the last one...
{104797}{104836}I think it's going to be easy.
{104847}{104872}I don't think so!
{104874}{104952}There's gonna be the team there|that won it the last time.
{104954}{105016}And I heard that this school from Queens...
{105021}{105067}they won the gold medal.
{105069}{105171}That was the school that won, us, last year.
{105561}{105592}Look at her hips.
{105610}{105678}- Justin messed up, he just messed up there.|- Who?
{105690}{105719}Justin.
{105786}{105820}Justin, straighten up!
{105949}{106020}Okay, bow. Circle.
{106041}{106104}Okay, gather around. Let's listen.
{106115}{106160}Good, good...
{106189}{106213}Okay.
{106216}{106306}Rock on. Great Cuban motion.|You guys totally rule.
{106309}{106357}Make sure your frame matches hers.
{106359}{106413}You both have beautiful frame,|but it's not the same frame.
{106416}{106452}Your arms should be touching.
{106454}{106513}The thing that I felt with this dance that...
{106515}{106548}really, I think makes a difference...
{106553}{106610}and I told them|that they need to feel it in here.
{106613}{106690}And when you do the one, two, hold.|Feel it.
{106693}{106772}Like kind of drag a little|instead of one, two, here.
{106774}{106865}You can still do the hips,|but I want you to do one, two, hold.
{106891}{106981}Feel it, I wanna see that expression.|Wow, you're really into it.
{106985}{107060}Trust me, a key thing is your expression...
{107064}{107097}and your attitude.
{107100}{107158}Okay, let's see the tango.
{107233}{107304}Don't be a bully. Don't let him push you.
{107341}{107405}All right, attitude! Real attitude.
{107408}{107433}James Bond!
{107436}{107489}Layla, remember? Bend your knees a little.
{107492}{107533}Okay, smile. You, too.
{107586}{107621}Smile.
{107735}{107779}Matthew, don't turn out.
{107956}{108073}- Matthew's good.|- James Bond. Smile, just a little.
{108214}{108299}What I'm talking about,|I just always managed to say...
{108301}{108367}And you know|we're at the citywide ballroom.
{108369}{108488}You know what? We'll do our best|and I hope it's here to stay for awhile.
{108491}{108568}I think we need to build a permanent home|for it, you know. We never...
{108573}{108649}- It needs a shrine.|- Maybe if we make a shrine, you know?
{108652}{108737}Like, build, like, this Plexiglas.|It knows it can't leave.
{108742}{108826}We love you, ballroom...|Maybe if we're, like, really extra nice to it...
{108829}{108903}it'll want to stay here, you know.
{108905}{109021}I love it. Nice. It's like the genie,|you rub it, you know, like the top, and it...
{109035}{109061}Winner!
{110043}{110110}Jatnna, what do you think about|the hairstyle?
{110113}{110186}I wish I could have bad hair|so that my bump would look more nice.
{110245}{110288}I wish I could have curly hair.
{110385}{110419}Oh, my Lord!
{110625}{110695}I feel fine 'cause, like, I want to be|on the basketball team.
{110709}{110777}'Cause I just want to, like, play basketball,|and not dance anymore.
{110780}{110849}'Cause I dance every day at my house,|why am I gonna dance in school?
{110851}{110891}I want to play basketball.
{110917}{110986}And I wish them good luck. Have fun.
{110990}{111061}And you better bring|the championship trophy.
{111307}{111343}What's that?
{111360}{111448}Can you believe that those|two huge buildings used to stand there?
{111456}{111497}- That's crazy.|- 1: 15.
{111500}{111564}I don't have to tell you how to behave.
{111637}{111688}You're representing your school, okay?
{112062}{112095}They have the palm trees, too?
{112497}{112589}It's facing out, the flower,|rather than in to the boy.
{112591}{112640}We have to fix yours, Erica.
{112665}{112731}Man, this is like a double Windsor. All right.
{112733}{112809}You guys gotta|tuck your shirts in all the way.
{112812}{112914}Not baggy, not loose,|tuck them in all the way, all right?
{112995}{113072}It's not important to look good,|but to smell good.
{113109}{113184}Gotta get some right here.|Oh, see, now, he's gotta check the hair.
{113189}{113270}All right, make sure there's nothing|standing up. All right, okay, cool.
{113274}{113370}You look sharp, bro.|That made a big difference.
{113381}{113410}Last minute things.
{113413}{113474}Each dance, merengue, keep your knees...
{113484}{113536}Down. Bent. Okay.
{113538}{113609}- And in the foxtrot, don't go up.|- Move your derrieres, right.
{113612}{113672}It's very slight. Keep the body...
{113698}{113784}Body with your partner.|Smile, the biggest thing, okay?
{113787}{113834}- Are we all set?|- Yeah.
{113851}{113884}Anybody nervous?
{113952}{114013}This time you're not going|to have the same judges.
{114016}{114083}You're going to have professional|dancers and people...
{114085}{114145}from all over the world judging you.
{114161}{114217}Okay, remember,|I'm not gonna be there with you, so...
{114316}{114364}- I am nervous.|- No, you're not.
{114541}{114577}I love you all.
{114810}{114848}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen...
{114851}{114922}{y:i}welcome to the colors|{y:i}of the rainbow team match.
{114925}{115001}{y:i}From Manhattan, P.S. 189, the red team.
{115147}{115188}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen...
{115190}{115280}{y:i}from the South Bronx,|{y:i}P.S. 1, the violet team.
{115496}{115596}{y:i}From Queens, P.S. 122, the pink team.
{115693}{115764}{y:i}And from Manhattan, Washington Heights...
{115766}{115844}{y:i}P.S. 115, the indigo team.
{116035}{116147}{y:i}From Brooklyn, P.S. 205, the orange team.
{116280}{116361}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen, from Queens...
{116364}{116436}{y:i}P.S. 144, the emerald team.
{116618}{116695}{y:i}And ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}last, but not by any means least...
{116697}{116784}{y:i}from Brooklyn, the green team, P.S. 120.
{116786}{116872}{y:i}And so, ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}the colors of the rainbow.
{116949}{117036}{y:i}Thank you. Now. The judges are ready.
{117046}{117129}{y:i}The merengue teams|{y:i}stay on the stage, please...
{117132}{117201}{y:i}and all of the other teams,|{y:i}escort your partner...
{117203}{117251}{y:i}back where you came from.
{117297}{117397}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen, the first dance,|"merengue," por favor.
{117538}{117615}{y:i}Five. Six. Ready. Go.
{117933}{118000}Let's go indigo!
{118969}{119066}Indigo! Indigo!
{119906}{119941}{y:i}Take a bow!
{120057}{120129}{y:i}May I have the fox trot teams, please?
{120217}{120256}{y:i}Music, please.
{120464}{120494}Attitude!
{120543}{120619}{y:i}Five, six, seven, go.
{121150}{121250}{y:i}Several of the children on the team|{y:i}were challenging children...
{121253}{121337}{y:i}as far as behavior issues, academic issues.
{121361}{121408}{y:i}Michell is an adorable little girl.
{121411}{121504}{y:i}Michell has a little mind of her own.|{y:i}And Michell is a handful.
{121506}{121559}{y:i}Even her mother|{y:i}would be kind of frustrated...
{121561}{121617}{y:i}and wondering what will be next.
{121629}{121728}{y:i}She certainly was a very mischievous,|{y:i}incorrigible, young lady...
{121731}{121825}{y:i}and certainly not focused on school|{y:i}or what she should be focused on.
{121827}{121939}{y:i}And I think that Michell has turned|{y:i}herself around to have real goals...
{121941}{122014}{y:i}and a much higher opinion of herself.
{122019}{122104}{y:i}I will tell you that Michell|{y:i}has not shown up in my office...
{122107}{122151}{y:i}this year, once.
{122174}{122230}{y:i}For behavior problems. Not once.
{122241}{122345}{y:i}So if that's not a dramatic improvement,|{y:i}I don't know what is.
{123338}{123397}{y:i}And take a bow.
{123474}{123506}{y:i}Thank you.
{123605}{123704}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}the dance from Cuba. Rumba!
{126627}{126664}{y:i}Take a bow!
{126810}{126867}{y:i}May I now have the tango team?
{126985}{127062}{y:i}Five, six, ready, and go.
{129290}{129337}{y:i}And take a bow.
{129493}{129574}{y:i}Thank you. Are you ready for the swing?
{129613}{129664}{y:i}Are you ready for the swing?
{129721}{129768}{y:i}So, let's go. Swing.

{132302}{132328}{y:i}Okay.
{132363}{132469}{y:i}We have to have a little bit of time|{y:i}for... Miss Danielle and Miss Yvonne...
{132472}{132544}{y:i}are doing the numbers.|{y:i}Thank you very much, ladies.
{132546}{132601}{y:i}And while they're doing that...
{132621}{132669}{y:i}I would like to ask...
{132672}{132781}{y:i}all of our alternate teams|{y:i}to come up on stage.
{132784}{132827}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen.
{132844}{132937}{y:i}The teams that had to know|{y:i}all five dances...
{132944}{133002}{y:i}just in case somebody got sick.
{133009}{133080}{y:i}So you need to show us|{y:i}what your mama gave you.
{133083}{133130}{y:i}Merengue, please.

{135245}{135334}{y:i}May I ask the green team|{y:i}to stand behind Miss Ellen?
{135358}{135432}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}these three teams today...
{135435}{135503}{y:i}receive the bronze level medal.
{135615}{135717}{y:i}May I now, please,|{y:i}have our yellow team stand here?
{135733}{135825}{y:i}Violet and orange.
{135857}{135929}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}you've won the silver level.

{137287}{137342}{y:i}All right. So.
{137366}{137438}{y:i}I'm going to ask Miss Reinking...
{137453}{137524}{y:i}to choose one of these dances. Please.
{137541}{137593}{y:i}Could you tell us what it is?
{137640}{137736}- Merengue.|{y:i}- The merengue team will dance.
{137796}{137849}{y:i}And the tango team will dance.
{137861}{137944}{y:i}May I have the three merengue teams|{y:i}come to me?
{137991}{138095}{y:i}Now, you cannot dance merengue,|{y:i}so choose another dance.
{138127}{138155}{y:i}Rumba.
{138230}{138325}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}this is for the challenge trophy.

{138892}{139009}{y:i}the key to success in life|{y:i}is to find something that you love to do.
{139021}{139081}{y:i}And to do it very well.
{139101}{139159}{y:i}And I tell that to the kids all the time.
{139189}{139280}{y:i}Kelvin was very, very close|{y:i}to being a street kid.
{139282}{139308}{y:i}A street thug.
{139311}{139369}{y:i}Maybe even down the road|{y:i}to being a criminal.
{139372}{139439}{y:i}But as we got started with the program...
{139441}{139516}{y:i}and Kelvin started to interact with Rodney...
{139521}{139581}{y:i}we started to see a change in him.
{139583}{139675}{y:i}He became almost like|{y:i}a little gentleman. Very polite.
{139678}{139777}{y:i}Really committed to his team,|{y:i}to his dance partner...
{139790}{139904}{y:i}and he has been such a role model|{y:i}for other kids...
{139913}{140003}{y:i}because he has leadership capabilities|{y:i}and kids will follow.
{140005}{140095}{y:i}Because they look up to him|{y:i}and they want to be like Kelvin.
{140305}{140414}{y:i}I think that Kelvin is gonna be fine.|{y:i}I think Kelvin is gonna be a big success.
{140417}{140449}{y:i}He's on the right path now.
{140452}{140548}{y:i}And I attribute a large percentage|{y:i}of that to the dance program.
{140551}{140609}{y:i}Now, you can't do tango. Good luck.
{140631}{140665}{y:i}Merengue!
{140773}{140824}Go, Jatnna, attitude!
{140905}{140943}{y:i}Ready, go.
{142664}{142714}{y:i}And take a bow!
{142838}{142945}{y:i}Thank you very, very much. Okay.
{143009}{143102}{y:i}Are you crossing your fingers?|{y:i}Crossing your ankles?
{143117}{143208}{y:i}All right. We have to wait|{y:i}a couple of more moments.
{143214}{143252}{y:i}We have to wait.
{143453}{143490}{y:i}We are waiting.
{143704}{143812}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}there's no second, there's no third.
{143814}{143897}{y:i}There's only one challenge trophy.
{143981}{144019}{y:i}The indigo team!
{144634}{144689}We rock! We rock!
{144838}{144904}Go dancers! Go dancers!
{146481}{146549}What would you like to be|when you grow up?
{146573}{146633}I was thinking about it a few times.
{146650}{146710}First, I wanted to become a lawyer.
{146729}{146824}But then I realized|that it takes a while to become a lawyer.
{147133}{147227}I want to be an architect,|because when you're an architect...
{147229}{147266}First of all, you can earn a lot of money...
{147269}{147308}and second of all, it's the only job...
{147311}{147392}where you can really, really use|your imagination to make something.
{147394}{147441}Like, if I were going to make that building...
{147444}{147517}I wouldn't make it like that.|That's a really ugly, boring building.
{147867}{147928}Like, around high school,|I want to have a boyfriend...
{147930}{147987}and when I finish college,|I want to get married...
{147989}{148082}and then at the age of 25, 26,|I want to have babies.
{148091}{148181}I would like to be a mother,|but only have one child.
{148193}{148271}No more childs. Because|I would not want to have my house...
{148273}{148346}to be all messy because of my child.
{148356}{148426}No, no, no. I would just have one child.
{149525}{149627}Falling in love makes, like, happiness.|That's what it's all about.
{149629}{149701}Like two people bonding together.
{149706}{149749}Like, loving each other...
{149752}{149821}and knowing that they're going to have|a happy life together.
{149824}{149909}Like, marriage, knowing that they're|going to have a happy life together.
{149912}{149989}It's like two people going together...
{149995}{150060}either to bond together...
{150063}{150168}to love each other|and maybe even have a child.
{150173}{150240}It's just how they like each other.
{150245}{150288}It's so beautiful!
{150303}{150331}{y:i}It's so beautiful!
