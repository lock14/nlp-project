1
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:46,664
What did the guy look like?

2
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:49,934
How do you expect us to help you if
you don't know what the guy looks like?

3
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,002
- Hi, Lieutenant.
- Hello, Sergeant. Where are the boys?

4
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:54,972
- Oh, we have them set up for you inside.
- Come on.

5
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:56,707
When are we gonna get to
take a few shots, Lieutenant?

6
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,108
Yeah, when can we see them?

7
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,611
Now, fellows, we'll be through with
this as soon as we possibly can.

8
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,042
Oh, come on...

9
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:05,549
This is Hank Bell. He'll
handle the preliminary.

10
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,784
Captain Larsen.

11
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:09,252
- Captain.
- You know Whitey.

12
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:10,380
Sure.

13
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:21,813
- Sit over there.
- Go ahead, sit down.

14
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,102
Okay, Whitey,
preliminary interrogation.

15
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:27,738
For the D.A.'s office,
Assistant District Attorney Bell,

16
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:29,506
and detective
Lieutenant Gunderson.

17
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:33,243
- Witnesses, Captain Larsen. Officer?
- Wohlman.

18
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:34,645
Officer Wohlman.

19
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:38,882
Suspects, three members of a street
gang known as the Thunderbirds.

20
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:40,373
Named...

21
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:49,025
Arthur Reardon, Anthony Aposto
and Daniel D-I-P-A-C-E. Di Pace.

22
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:56,108
Which one of you is Di Pace?

23
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,143
- Your name Di Pace?
- David Copperfield.

24
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:08,679
All right, do you want me to
bounce you around the room?

25
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,910
- Hey, he ain't writing
that. He's Di Pace.

26
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,878
- Your father John Di Pace?
- I ain't got no father.

27
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,888
Your mother's named Mary?

28
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:24,828
So what the hell does my
mother got to do with it?

29
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:26,228
Nothing, kid.

30
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,601
- How old are you, Danny?
- I'm 15.

31
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,836
You can't hold me in
this police station.

32
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:35,539
You can't even question
me. I'm a juvenile.

33
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,410
You're a juvenile up to 16 unless
you kill somebody and you did.

34
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:41,845
- He stopped again.
- All right, shut up.

35
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,177
Gunderson!

36
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,728
The law says you can execute
a 15-year-old for murder.

37
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,064
But it also says you can't
question him in a police station...

38
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:02,800
Now look, I'm tired of
having to coddle these punks

39
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:04,768
because they're
15 instead of 16.

40
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,470
You don't have to tell
me about these kids.

41
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,771
I was born in
this neighborhood.

42
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,040
I went to school with some
of the worst gunsels in town.

43
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,942
A good swift kick would do more
to straighten out these punks

44
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:13,010
- than anything...
- Gunderson.

45
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:18,015
We're not out to kick kids this time,
we're out for first degree murder.

46
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:20,117
Putting a juvenile in the
chair is always big trouble.

47
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:23,987
Whoever prosecutes this case will need
a clear record the defense can't attack.

48
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:26,457
No technicalities getting in the
way, like interrogating a juvenile

49
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,208
in the police
station, right?

50
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:30,687
Okay.

51
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,831
Let's find out the
ages of the other two,

52
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:37,468
and then we'll separate the baby
killers from the adult killers.

53
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:43,101
- Okay, Whitey. You, name and age?
- Arthur Reardon, 17.

54
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:46,191
- Batman.
- What's your name?

55
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:50,114
- Anthony Aposto.
- How old are you?

56
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:51,377
Sixteen.

57
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:57,854
- Their homes been called, Captain?
- Strictly according to the book, Counselor.

58
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:02,259
Mrs. Di Pace and Reardon's
old man are outside now.

59
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,350
Take him out to
see his mother.

60
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,728
So you're a big shot, now.

61
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,397
You didn't find
them knives on us.

62
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,966
Found a lot of holes in the
body, we'll find the knives.

63
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:48,605
The spic started it. He pulled a knife.
So now, he's dead like he should be.

64
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:51,275
Why do you figure
he pulled a knife?

65
00:08:51,276 --> 00:08:56,079
- We was on his turf.
- He's on your turf, you pull a knife?

66
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,280
We ain't no dirty spics.
We're Thunderbirds.

67
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,022
Do you know the name
of the boy you killed?

68
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,873
No, we never
seen him before.

69
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:12,796
His name was Roberto
Escalante. He was 15 years old.

70
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:13,855
So?

71
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,253
Now, let me get
this straight.

72
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:21,672
You went for a walk on
his street, he saw you.

73
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:26,343
- He came at you with a knife,
right? Yeah, that's right.

74
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:27,544
He must've been pretty
good with a knife?

75
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:28,978
He was crazy.

76
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,250
In fact, he must have been better with
a knife than anybody in the whole world,

77
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:36,491
because Roberto
Escalante was blind.

78
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:55,572
So, in view of Tolly's switch
to guilty, I think I'll be free

79
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:59,109
to take over that teenage
killing case, if you'd like me to.

80
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,678
I mean, it sounds
like a toughy

81
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,614
and I'd like something to get
my teeth into, for a change.

82
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,082
Something I can
really identify with.

83
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,185
Yes, well, I've asked Hank to
handle the preliminary on that.

84
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:09,252
How about it, Hank?

85
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:12,089
Well, the facts in the case
are just about as reported.

86
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,225
The boys admit the killing,
but they claim self-defense.

87
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:19,796
However, the boy they killed,
the Puerto Rican boy, was blind.

88
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:20,991
Blind?

89
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:29,239
I've got a hunch the papers are
gonna play this like the Chicago Fire.

90
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,141
Do you think we should try
for first degree murder?

91
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:33,502
It looks like it to me.

92
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:38,664
You wanna prosecute?

93
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,785
That's up to you, but
before you make any decision

94
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:46,189
I think you ought to know one of the
defendants is a kid named Di Pace.

95
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,991
I used to go with his
mother, when I was a kid.

96
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:51,495
Oh boy, Hank, the papers would
have a field day with this one.

97
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,297
I hope I'm not speaking
out of turn, Mr. Cole.

98
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:56,400
But it seems to me that politically
this is a dangerous case.

99
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,493
Politically?

100
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:02,172
We don't care anything
about politics now, do we?

101
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:05,976
Well, sir, I think we're all aware,
sir, that there's something more

102
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:10,147
than a ground swell developing to
put you in the Governor's mansion.

103
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:12,948
I'm sure none of us would like to see
anything happen to jeopardize that.

104
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:15,452
Oh, now, the worst the
newspapers can say is,

105
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:18,789
"Honest D.A. Prosecutes son
of childhood sweetheart. "

106
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,625
Doesn't sound so
damaging to me.

107
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:26,106
All right, that's all
for the moment, gentlemen.

108
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,523
- Hello, darling.
- Sweetheart.

109
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:40,874
Boy, I'm beat.

110
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:51,154
- How's that for timing?
- I earned this one today.

111
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:55,359
- Did you ever see such headlines?
- It's a hard case, all right.

112
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,294
Mom, where's that
white bra of yours?

113
00:11:57,295 --> 00:11:58,627
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, beautiful.

114
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,430
Third drawer of the dresser,
dear, where it always is.

115
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,523
Okay.

116
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,384
Jenny wearing a bra?

117
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:09,840
Jenny's been wearing a bra
for almost two years now.

118
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:13,844
I guess I haven't taken
a good look at her lately.

119
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:18,665
One of those boys is only
a year older than Jenny.

120
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:22,886
- I guess that's why it bothers me so.
- He was old enough to handle a knife.

121
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:25,722
Whose idea was it anyway to
go for murder one, Dan Cole's?

122
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:28,425
- Look, Karin...
- I know why he assigned this case to you.

123
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:33,196
'Cause you're the only man smart enough
to get him a first degree conviction.

124
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:36,932
He'd frame his own mother
to get that nomination.

125
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:41,505
Karin, it wasn't Dan Cole's idea
to go for first degree murder.

126
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:42,938
It was mine.

127
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,501
Yours?

128
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:47,836
Yes, mine.

129
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,527
I don't believe it.

130
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,517
But you came from that
neighborhood yourself.

131
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:57,058
- Yes and I got out.
- Yes, you did.

132
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,756
But everybody hasn't got
the emotional equipment

133
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:02,058
to put up with the
slums and the poverty.

134
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:04,960
Here we go with the passive
theories of social oppression.

135
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:07,963
Listen, Karin, those punks
have made Harlem a nightmare.

136
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:10,934
People are afraid to walk home
from the subway after dark.

137
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:13,670
Remember the old man at the newsstand,
the one who loaned me the money

138
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:15,639
to buy a suit
for my bar exam?

139
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,708
Well, last week, four of your
underprivileged children beat him up.

140
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:21,111
They broke both his legs,
he'll never walk again.

141
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,380
And you're upset because
three self-confessed killers

142
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:26,149
are gonna stand
trial for murder.

143
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,418
Good night, folks.
Don't wait up for me.

144
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:31,253
Oh, Jenny, I
wasn't planning to.

145
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:34,157
I'm going to bed
at 12:00, after you.

146
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:38,495
Mother, you can be such a drag
sometimes. So utterly cubistic.

147
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:40,564
You know what I
mean, don't you, Dad?

148
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:43,667
You heard your
mother. 12:00, darling.

149
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:49,706
All right, I just hope I can explain
it to Lonnie's satisfaction. Good night.

150
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:52,042
Lonnie? Whatever
happened to Greg?

151
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:56,079
He's been replaced by a
more mature man, age 16.

152
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,383
- I ever meet Lonnie?
- You haven't even met Greg.

153
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:03,053
Look, honey,
let's not wrangle.

154
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,821
Come on, we'll grab our
things, go out to dinner,

155
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:08,258
have a big, thick steak and a
bottle of wine. What do you say?

156
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:09,556
Okay.

157
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:17,933
By the way, your old girlfriend,
Mary Di Pace, called today. Twice.

158
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:21,137
I referred her to your
office. Did you talk to her?

159
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:24,107
I don't know what
to say to her.

160
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,676
Why don't you just tell her
that you're gonna burn her son.

161
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:28,627
For old times' sake.

162
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:40,824
Russell, come on, will you?

163
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:44,855
Grab those crates and
bring them over here.

164
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:51,668
- Papa, what did you do?
- Never mind what I done.

165
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,672
- You told the police about the knives.
- Mr. Rugiello?

166
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:58,441
That's right. I hope
nobody see you come here?

167
00:14:58,442 --> 00:14:59,509
This your daughter?

168
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,177
I don't have 'em, I
know nothing about 'em.

169
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:04,613
All right, come on, come on. All
right, Mr. Rugiello. Let's go.

170
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,449
What are you going to
do with girls like this?

171
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,007
Some father.

172
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:12,822
- Calls the cops on his own daughter.
- He did the right thing.

173
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:15,959
Your name is Angela, isn't
it? They call you Angy.

174
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,626
What did you do with
the knives, Angy?

175
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:20,267
You're so smart, find them.

176
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:26,902
You can get into a lot of
trouble by concealing evidence.

177
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:28,071
- You know that, don't you?
- I know.

178
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:30,340
All right then, what did
you do with the knives?

179
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,976
I hid them in some newspaper.
Then I got scared and threw them

180
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:34,544
- in the back of a car.
- What car?

181
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:37,047
- I don't know.
- Where was the car?

182
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:38,715
I told you I don't
know. It was just parked.

183
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:39,883
- Where?
- On the street.

184
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:44,184
- What street?
- I don't know, I don't know.

185
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:47,289
Angy, I want you
to listen to me.

186
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,627
Nothing's going to happen to
you, if you try to help us.

187
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:57,528
Now, please think. Where were you when
you got rid of the knives? Tell me.

188
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:03,214
The cops were all
around. I just ran.

189
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:07,174
I turned the
corner, no more cops.

190
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:10,749
I don't know which corner.

191
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:15,719
- I don't know, I don't know.
- All right, now about the car.

192
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,390
What kind of a car was it?

193
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:22,626
I'm not sure, it could
have been a Ford or a Chevy.

194
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:25,395
- It was old, I think.
- Do you remember the color?

195
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:30,146
I think it was dark,
black, or maybe it was blue.

196
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,906
I was just so scared. I
didn't know what to do.

197
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:38,534
All right, Angy.

198
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,811
Let's talk about the
boys for a minute.

199
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:43,913
Why did you take the
knives in the first place?

200
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:46,754
I don't know. I don't know.

201
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:50,387
- Did you do it for Reardon?
- That creep.

202
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:53,084
- Aposto?
- The Batman?

203
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:57,394
No, it's on
account of Danny.

204
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:00,035
He's different, he's sweet.

205
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:03,133
- He's a darling.
- What do you know about him?

206
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:05,734
- I know he killed
a boy in cold blood.

207
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:08,204
- No, he didn't,
he just fought back.

208
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,508
How do you know that?

209
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:12,375
I told you, because I
saw it with my own eyes.

210
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,678
- What were you doing there?
- I just followed them.

211
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,939
- Why?
- I don't know.

212
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,482
For kicks.

213
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,230
What did you see?

214
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:32,561
I was a ways behind them.

215
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:38,038
<i>The boy on the
stoop pulled a knife.</i>

216
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,206
<i>The boy on the
stoop couldn't see.</i>

217
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:46,446
<i>He still pulled a knife, it
glittered, I saw it shining.</i>

218
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:49,404
Anybody else see it?

219
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:51,102
I was alone, but
there were lot of

220
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,993
people around, they
must have seen it.

221
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:55,762
I talked to a lot of other
people. Nobody saw it.

222
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:59,373
You talked to a lot
of Puerto Ricans.

223
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:07,107
I think you're making this
up, Angy, for Danny's sake.

224
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:14,098
I'm not making it up and you're not
going to scare me into saying I am.

225
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:20,973
I still can't get the
blood off my skirt.

226
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:21,847
Hey, these Puerto Ricans put on
a pretty good show, don't they?

227
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,315
Yeah, great.

228
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:25,050
This interest you, Barton?

229
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:27,152
I thought your newspaper believed
the only good Puerto Rican

230
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:29,189
was a dead Puerto Rican.

231
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,423
You haven't been reading
our paper, Mr. Bell.

232
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:32,789
Not lately.

233
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:35,728
This is oppressed
minority season with us.

234
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:40,366
You ought to read it, Hank. Big
exposé on Park Avenue call houses.

235
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:43,268
- We perform a public service.
- Yes, I know.

236
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:48,129
You tell the citizens how
to get their asses hauled.

237
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:54,613
We got the word that they concocted
a story about the blind boy

238
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,982
flashing a knife.
Anything to that?

239
00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:58,611
Not a thing.

240
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:03,790
Good, because our readers are
expecting the chair for the killers

241
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,092
of this gentle and
poetic blind boy.

242
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:09,003
We'll do our best.

243
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:16,436
Who tips them off to
these things, anyway?

244
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:19,004
Thousand-to-one
the girl is lying.

245
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:20,974
But suppose he
did have a knife?

246
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:22,876
He would have been
using it in self-defense.

247
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:26,713
If he had a knife, we'll never
make murder one stick with the jury.

248
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:31,116
- It's what you really want, isn't it?
- That's what I want.

249
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:33,307
There's Cole, come on.

250
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:42,223
Hey, come on, you guys.
Give him room, guys.

251
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,130
- Anything to give us today, Dan?
- Certainly.

252
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:48,701
The city of New York will not
rest until justice has been done.

253
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:51,770
I've come to the funeral myself to
make sure that is perfectly clear.

254
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:53,640
The boys are right
on the job, Dan.

255
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,008
- Good morning, boys.
- Dan.

256
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:56,508
Who are the boys in costume?

257
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:59,678
The Horsemen, a
Puerto Rican gang.

258
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,915
- Like to meet their leader?
- Yeah.

259
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:06,566
Hey, Zorro, come on over
here a moment, will you?

260
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:12,992
This is Mr. Cole, a
district attorney. Zorro.

261
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:16,763
You gonna burn the Thunderbirds
that killed Roberto?

262
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:19,365
- We're gonna try.
- That'll be the day.

263
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:22,534
- What do you mean by that, son?
- You're kidding? Try.

264
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:26,206
When your people come from Puerto Rico
or Cuba, they just ain't human to cops.

265
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:29,987
It'll be the same
old story this time.

266
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:38,444
- Mrs. Escalante.
- Mother of the dead boy.

267
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:54,091
Mrs. Escalante.

268
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,102
Mrs. Escalante, I am
the district attorney.

269
00:21:57,103 --> 00:22:00,305
<i>- Please accept my condolences.
- Gracias.</i>

270
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:05,844
And this is Mr. Bell, the prosecutor.
He'll help your son's case.

271
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:10,416
You cannot help Roberto, it
is too late to help Roberto.

272
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:15,455
<i>- Mrs. Escalante, please believe me we...
- Perdoname, Señor.</i>

273
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:17,923
When I am a little girl,

274
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:21,620
in my family they
teach me love.

275
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:26,498
They teach me this in
Puerto Rico, where I am born.

276
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:31,119
The people there, they
say to you, "Hello. " Here,

277
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,031
is different.

278
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,005
Here, so many people.

279
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:45,402
But is no one here
say to you, "Hello. "

280
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:51,823
In this city, and on these
streets, is no time for love.

281
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,220
There is only...

282
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:00,026
Hatred.

283
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:02,664
Hatred.

284
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:06,636
And it is hatred
is killed my son.

285
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,176
Your son will have
justice, Mrs. Escalante.

286
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:12,542
<i>Ah, Señor,</i>

287
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:15,396
is only one justice.

288
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:19,417
You want to do something?

289
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:22,855
All right, you can
do something for me,

290
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:24,550
and for my son.

291
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:25,989
One thing.

292
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,925
Kill them.

293
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:32,363
Kill the murderers.

294
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:35,453
The same way
they kill my son.

295
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:38,396
You put out their eyes,

296
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:42,802
and you come at
them with knives,

297
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:46,303
the same way they
came at my son

298
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,306
in his darkness.

299
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:53,002
You kill them like
the animals they are.

300
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,050
You kill them and you rid
the streets of the animals.

301
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:02,183
<i>This, you can
do for me, Señor.</i>

302
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:04,863
And for my son,

303
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:06,931
who is dead.

304
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:19,746
Is that what you're
gonna do, Hank?

305
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:27,854
Hello, Mary.

306
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:30,421
You're gonna kill my kid?

307
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:33,826
You're gonna put his eyes out and come
at him with knives in the darkness?

308
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:35,594
You're gonna kill him
like an animal, huh?

309
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:37,162
This is Lieutenant
Gunderson.

310
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:39,183
Miss... Mrs. Di Pace.

311
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,468
Danny didn't have
anything to do with this.

312
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:45,489
- I'm afraid he did.
- No, no.

313
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,408
He's protecting
somebody or something.

314
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:49,671
I know him.

315
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:51,810
I know, he's my
child. You don't know.

316
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:54,781
He swore to me he's not
even a member of this gang.

317
00:24:54,782 --> 00:24:57,012
It still happened, Mary.

318
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:59,451
Is that what my
child is to you?

319
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:04,023
Just another case, another
conviction? He's mine, Hank.

320
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,625
Danny will have a fair
trial, same as the other two.

321
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:08,527
You know this neighborhood.

322
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:10,629
- You're guilty before you're arrested.
- Mary.

323
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,433
You look everywhere for evidence
to prove that he's guilty.

324
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:16,068
Are you looking for evidence
to prove he's innocent?

325
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:18,337
No, that wouldn't
help you, would it?

326
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:22,778
You wouldn't get a gold
star, would you, Hank?

327
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,688
They're all alike.

328
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:31,350
They all say the same thing.

329
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:34,953
"My son didn't do it. "
"My son couldn't do it. "

330
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:37,384
"My son is a good boy. "

331
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,958
They all believe it, too.

332
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:31,710
- Can I come in a minute?
- Please.

333
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:33,201
Please, Hank.

334
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:40,750
Come in.

335
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:52,297
I'm calling a
Puerto Rican boy.

336
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:55,528
I want him to
tell you something.

337
00:27:00,874 --> 00:27:04,710
He came to see Danny
last summer, to thank him.

338
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:06,211
Sit down, Hank.

339
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:08,607
José?

340
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:11,350
Could you come to
my house right away?

341
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:13,401
It's Danny's mother.

342
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:22,154
I went to look for him
yesterday. Sit down.

343
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:28,901
How does he... How does he
get through no man's land?

344
00:27:28,902 --> 00:27:32,538
Well, he comes through the cellars
and then through that old area way...

345
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:34,097
Over the roof?

346
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:36,614
Yeah, I remember.

347
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:44,483
He'll be here right away. You wait,
Hank. I have to go to work in a minute.

348
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:49,274
- I work in an appliance store down...
- I'll wait.

349
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:51,121
Cigarette?

350
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:53,726
I'll get you some coffee.

351
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:55,159
No, don't...

352
00:27:58,031 --> 00:27:59,123
José?

353
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,897
José, this is Mr. Bell.

354
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:09,363
He's a friend of mine.

355
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,610
<i>Is amigo.  You
can talk to him.</i>

356
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:13,846
The Thunderbirds will kill
me if they know I am here,

357
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:16,007
and the Horsemen worse.

358
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:27,126
José, so you
tell him, please.

359
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:28,617
Go ahead, son.

360
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:30,996
You know the
swimming pool, mister?

361
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:33,367
- On 124th Street?
- Yes.

362
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,436
Well, there's a cool
in there. No fighting.

363
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:40,005
I was there with
some of the Horsemen.

364
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:42,676
I don't swim so good, see?

365
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:05,631
What's the matter, Reardon?

366
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:07,442
Look in the water.

367
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:09,835
I don't see nothing
in the water.

368
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:11,030
Spics.

369
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:13,372
Well, what are they doing?

370
00:29:13,373 --> 00:29:15,983
You like swimming with them?

371
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:20,446
Hey, Danny!

372
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:23,073
Hey, Danny! Come here.

373
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:29,722
Yeah, what's up, Doc?

374
00:29:29,723 --> 00:29:33,923
Take a look. San Juan's
polluting the water.

375
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:38,831
So, you never saw a spic
before? They swim here every day.

376
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:40,532
Today, I don't like it.

377
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:42,768
What are you, head of the
immigration department or something?

378
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:44,837
I'm me. I don't like it
and I say we kick 'em out.

379
00:29:44,838 --> 00:29:47,758
Danny, don't
get into trouble.

380
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,579
So, that's your problem. You
let a broad boss you, huh?

381
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,160
All right, all right. Big
deal. Let's go get it over with.

382
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:23,809
What are you wearing
a necklace for?

383
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,277
I thought only
girls wore necklaces.

384
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:27,880
That's no necklace.

385
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:29,848
<i>That's Jesús Cristo.</i>

386
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:31,799
You got no religion?

387
00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:33,914
You got religion.

388
00:30:33,987 --> 00:30:36,317
He's got religion, boys.

389
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:41,160
We wanna see how
religious you are, spic.

390
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:42,660
Don't you call me a spic!

391
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:45,898
We wanna see if you
can walk on water, spic.

392
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,569
Hey, I don't swim so good.

393
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:59,410
I told you! I told you
I don't swim so good!

394
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:02,641
He's trying to
drown you, stupid!

395
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:11,256
Okay, let him
go. That's enough.

396
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:13,277
Neck, keep him under!

397
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,889
Damn it. You're
gonna kill him!

398
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:35,166
Watch out, watch out.

399
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:55,159
Thank you, José.

400
00:31:56,635 --> 00:31:58,365
<i>Gracias, José.</i>

401
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,910
Can you believe that the
same boy who did this,

402
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:09,801
would stab to death
a helpless blind boy?

403
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,820
If he didn't do it, we'll
find out he didn't do it.

404
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:16,461
Believe me, Mary.

405
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:27,433
You know, Hank,

406
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:32,324
I made a terrible mistake
when I walked out on you.

407
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:38,409
I knew it the day
after I married Johnny.

408
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,613
He turned out to be
a petty racketeer.

409
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:45,884
I never told Danny what
kind of man his father was.

410
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:48,695
But he's a pretty sharp kid.

411
00:32:49,456 --> 00:32:52,658
And sometimes, I would
see him looking at me,

412
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:58,529
thinking, "What kind of a woman is
that? She marries a guy like that. "

413
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,759
And so,

414
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:04,103
you know, just to make
him think more of me,

415
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:06,744
I would tell him about you.

416
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:12,076
You know, when we read
your name in the papers,

417
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:16,447
or I kind of heard about
what you were doing.

418
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:19,984
And then, I would think,

419
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:23,422
"Well, you can't be a total mess. A
man like that wanted to marry you. "

420
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:27,292
Don't give yourself
the worst of it, Mary.

421
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:31,903
You will try to see Danny
as he really is, huh?

422
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:34,838
I'll talk to him.

423
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,908
He could have been our son.

424
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,045
That was a long
time ago, Mary.

425
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,672
We've grown up.

426
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:52,565
Maybe it's too bad,
but we've grown up.

427
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:55,899
Will Danny grow up?

428
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:10,429
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Goodbye, Hank.

429
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:30,050
235 calling. Over.

430
00:34:31,124 --> 00:34:33,114
<i>Hardy speaking. Over.</i>

431
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:35,127
This is Bell, Hardy.

432
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:37,962
What about the knives in
the Escalante killing? Over.

433
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:39,697
<i>HARD Y... What about them?</i>

434
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:42,301
<i>- Well, did you find them?
- Not yet.</i>

435
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:45,703
<i>- How many men did you put on it?
- All we can spare.</i>

436
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:48,314
<i>- How many is that?
- Two.</i>

437
00:34:50,377 --> 00:34:53,212
That's not enough, Lieutenant.
You'll have to put more men on it.

438
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:55,748
And you'd better put out an all
points bulletin about that car.

439
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:57,216
It could be anywhere by now.

440
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:59,917
And I want daily progress
reports from your office.

441
00:34:59,918 --> 00:35:04,323
<i>In which order do you want
these requests turned down? Over.</i>

442
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:06,325
Who is this character?

443
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:09,360
<i>I don't have all
day, Bell. Over.</i>

444
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:11,130
Let me talk to the
head of your department.

445
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:14,198
<i>He went on vacation this morning,
and he's the only one who can give</i>

446
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,301
<i>priority authorization
for additional manpower.</i>

447
00:35:17,302 --> 00:35:20,039
Well, doesn't he deputize
anyone to do it for him?

448
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,340
<i>No, he doesn't.</i>

449
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:22,808
Well, does your whole
department go to pieces

450
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:25,209
because one man
goes on a vacation?

451
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,347
<i>We'll find your knives as
soon as we can, Mr. Bell.</i>

452
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:31,649
<i>Of course, we only have to find
an undescribed automobile which</i>

453
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,154
<i>may be anywhere in the state of
New York, Connecticut, New Jersey,</i>

454
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:36,865
<i>Arizona or Texas.</i>

455
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:40,426
<i>Not that we can't do it, you understand,
in spite of being understaffed,</i>

456
00:35:40,427 --> 00:35:42,393
<i>overworked and underpaid.</i>

457
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:46,465
<i>But I'm sure you're not interested
in our internal problems. Over.</i>

458
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:49,667
Look, Hardy, I hate to have to
go to the D.A. On this. Over.

459
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:53,798
<i>Me, too. Nice talking
to you. Over and out.</i>

460
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:59,310
- Now, where to, Hank?
- What?

461
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,903
Where to?

462
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:02,829
Raymond Street Jail.

463
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,879
All right. Come on now,
knock it off. Keep it quiet.

464
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,472
Pipe down.

465
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:45,324
My folks didn't
understand me.

466
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:48,060
I just wanted to go to the
country and see the cows.

467
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:52,096
Instead, they sent me out on this
crummy street to play with bad boys.

468
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:54,298
Some parents, huh? But it
really wasn't their fault.

469
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,857
They were poor.

470
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:58,669
Okay, Batman.
It's your turn.

471
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,170
Me, I'm stupid. You know.

472
00:37:01,673 --> 00:37:03,775
<i>I'm pazzo, we call it.</i>

473
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:06,879
I can't even read
right, you know.

474
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,516
The doctor, he says to me, he says,
that my brain is a little mixed up,

475
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:12,985
you know like, I don't know,
scrambled eggs. I mean...

476
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:16,426
Show him how stupid
you are, stupid.

477
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:25,097
Now, tell him how
stupid you are.

478
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:27,665
Well, I've been
in the sixth grade,

479
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,567
I think five times
now, that's right.

480
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:31,135
My old man's a drunk.

481
00:37:31,136 --> 00:37:33,871
My mother takes in boarders
and goes out with them, too.

482
00:37:33,872 --> 00:37:36,407
I got a sister. I don't
know if she's my sister.

483
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:38,209
That's why I'm so disturbed.

484
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,112
- He's got a song about it.
- Yeah.

485
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:41,779
Go ahead, sing it, stupid.

486
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,408
Yeah, yeah.

487
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:47,112
<i>My mother throws
snow to the snowbirds</i>

488
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:49,987
<i>My father makes
barbershop gin</i>

489
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:53,091
<i>My sister sells
jazz for a living</i>

490
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:56,112
<i>And that's when
money rolls in</i>

491
00:37:57,397 --> 00:37:58,629
Where's Dr. Walsh's office?

492
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,631
- Down at the end of that corridor.
- They're all yours.

493
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:03,167
Hey, look, ain't you going to
ask us no regular questions?

494
00:38:03,168 --> 00:38:04,268
On your feet.

495
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:07,739
I don't want you to
run another Rorschach.

496
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,309
I don't care if he's faking.

497
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,609
I don't care.

498
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,880
What he's faking reveals just
as much as his real reactions.

499
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:18,141
That's right. Yes, yes.

500
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:20,508
Yeah, I gotta go. Bye.

501
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:23,287
My name is Bell,
D.A.'s office.

502
00:38:23,288 --> 00:38:24,482
Oh, yes.

503
00:38:25,657 --> 00:38:27,906
I understand they're
building a kid-sized

504
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:29,994
electric chair
upstate for you people.

505
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:32,369
Now, Doctor, that's a
nice friendly approach.

506
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:34,033
Indictment is first
degree, isn't it?

507
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,876
Usually is in
premeditated murder.

508
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:40,641
Bully and gung homes. I'm delighted
you haven't fallen for any of that

509
00:38:40,642 --> 00:38:45,608
modern nonsense about emotional
problems or environment, or broken homes.

510
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:49,019
A little mass execution now
and then, that'll stop them.

511
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:50,708
Nothing else has.

512
00:38:51,749 --> 00:38:54,999
Look, Doctor, I came here to ask a
couple of questions about these boys.

513
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,336
I've already talked
with Reardon and Aposto.

514
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,134
They're old pros.

515
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,705
Those two have been
through the mill

516
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:05,476
here regularly since
they were 10 or 11.

517
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:08,946
- Di Pace been in here before?
- No. This is his first.

518
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,348
Tell me something about him.

519
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,448
He's bright.

520
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,213
IQ 135.

521
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:14,809
Likes to read.

522
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:19,290
Of course, the psychological tests show
aggression and fear, just like the others.

523
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,071
What about Reardon?

524
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:26,284
Delusions of grandeur.
Deep feeling of inferiority.

525
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:29,300
Hates anybody whose skin
or religion is different.

526
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:32,134
Underneath,
scared of course.

527
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,264
But scared more
than the others.

528
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,009
Is Aposto as
stupid as he seems?

529
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,307
Retarded.

530
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,840
Very.

531
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:46,517
As a psychiatrist, would
you say he's legally sane?

532
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:50,555
Now you know that the words sane and
insane have no meaning in medicine?

533
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,691
- They have in law.
- I deal in people, Mr. Bell.

534
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:56,286
Not in legal technicalities.

535
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:58,996
Where is Di Pace?

536
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:02,200
- In the juvenile section.
- Thank you.

537
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:03,998
And, by the way,

538
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,305
I hope you'll forgive
my bad manners.

539
00:40:07,306 --> 00:40:10,808
It's a conditioned reflex with
public officials, I'm afraid.

540
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:16,609
Think nothing of it, Doctor. We
all have our emotional problems.

541
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,053
Sit down.

542
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:34,024
- Cigarette?
- Ram it.

543
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,971
I'd like to hear your
side of the story, Danny.

544
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:41,839
So you can help fry me?

545
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,130
Do I look like a kook?

546
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:46,911
Did my lawyers give you
an okay to talk to me?

547
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,145
They know I'm here.

548
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,214
They must have told you
you're in serious trouble.

549
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:53,083
They told me I'm innocent
till proven guilty.

550
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,819
You'll get a fair trial,
if that's what you mean.

551
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,589
But not in a children's
court, a grown-up murder trial.

552
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,658
You better tell
me your story.

553
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:01,751
Okay.

554
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,633
In two words, self-defense.

555
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:06,530
Danny, that's stupid
and you know it.

556
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,861
And you're stupid
to stick to it.

557
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:12,870
Tough and a half.
So, I'm stupid.

558
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,505
And a little scared, too?

559
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:17,041
Nobody scares me,
especially a bum like you.

560
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,376
Don't get fresh
with me, Danny.

561
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:19,977
I'm here because I'm a
friend of your mother's.

562
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,338
Don't con me, Mr. Bell.

563
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:28,725
Bell. Your name's Bellini,
and you're a wop just like me.

564
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:34,637
What's the matter, Mr. Bellini?
You ashamed of being a wop?

565
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,961
Let me tell you
something, Mr. Bellini.

566
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:40,498
Don't walk down any
dark streets alone.

567
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:44,502
You haven't got the guts to handle a
skinny broad, much less the Thunderbirds.

568
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:47,204
You look kind of
fruity to me anyway.

569
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:51,405
And, stay away from my
mother, you fake wop!

570
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:18,497
Excuse me. I'm
looking for Zorro.

571
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:28,593
<i>Go away, don't bother
me. Vamos, Señor.</i>

572
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:36,988
Mr. Bell, what
brings you to my turf?

573
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,757
- I'd like to talk with Louisa Escalante.
- Why?

574
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:45,648
She was there the day it happened.
I'd like to talk with her.

575
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:59,306
A few minutes. Come
on, I'll buy you a beer.

576
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,144
- They think I'm a C
-man, huh?

577
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,237
- Why do you think so?

578
00:43:26,238 --> 00:43:28,806
You know, this white
shirt, the suit.

579
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:30,641
You know Harlem, huh?

580
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,543
I used to live here.

581
00:43:32,544 --> 00:43:34,178
They think I'm a cop and
they don't wanna be around

582
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,513
if there's gonna be a pinch.

583
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:37,148
You know, this
place is all right.

584
00:43:37,149 --> 00:43:41,552
A guy gets pinched, he like throws
stuff away. Might land at your feet.

585
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:43,521
Next thing you know,
you're arrested for holding.

586
00:43:43,522 --> 00:43:46,123
Or maybe even for
intent to sell.

587
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,625
Let's have two
beers, Miguel.

588
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:50,227
Good beer here.
You'll like it.

589
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,496
So, you're working
for Roberto?

590
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:53,964
Well, that's one
way of putting it.

591
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,915
The birds ain't
got a chance,

592
00:43:57,169 --> 00:43:58,693
or have they?

593
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,504
I think we've got
a very good case.

594
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:03,574
Yeah? My man, you
give it to them good.

595
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:06,477
The others are bad,
but they are the worst.

596
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,579
You don't like them,
do you, any of them?

597
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,781
Well, man, put
yourself in my shoes.

598
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,851
The niggers look down on
us. The wops look down on us.

599
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,719
The Irish were here
before the Indians.

600
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,855
Man, my people
are a proud race.

601
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:20,791
Puerto Rico ain't
no African jungle.

602
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,227
And the wops, what the
hell did they ever have?

603
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,388
Mussolini, a big stink.

604
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:27,591
Michelangelo, so what?

605
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:30,434
You ever heard of
a guy named Picasso?

606
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:33,395
- Yes.
- Now Pablo Picasso, man,

607
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:36,207
I went all the way down to the
museum to look at his paintings.

608
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:37,908
Now, that cat is great.

609
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,611
He's the greatest artist that
ever lived, man. He sings.

610
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:42,112
And you know...

611
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:44,949
That's the delivery kid
that don't wanna pay.

612
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:52,120
You know, Picasso, he's got the same
blood in his veins that I got in mine.

613
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:42,039
And you know the first
fiddle at the Minsk hall?

614
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,100
Puerto Rican. Come on.

615
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,467
That a contribution
to your war chest?

616
00:46:00,392 --> 00:46:02,860
Look, we got three
square blocks here.

617
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:04,962
Like this is our island,
little Puerto Rico.

618
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:06,664
You know what I
mean, Mr. Bell?

619
00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:08,399
And we are
busting to get out.

620
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,501
But while we here, we
gotta protect our turf.

621
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:12,036
People gotta respect it.

622
00:46:12,037 --> 00:46:15,827
And, you know what
people respect. Force.

623
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:21,822
Here, our contribution
to your favorite charity.

624
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:25,114
You know that that ain't the
point. It ain't the money.

625
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,484
We just can't let people come in and out
of here without knowing whose place it is.

626
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,422
- Like the Thunderbirds?
- Yeah, like the Thunderbirds.

627
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,091
Look what happened
to poor Roberto.

628
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:38,462
Poor, innocent, blind kid
who never did anyone no wrong.

629
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:42,131
Tell me something. Thunderbirds
know you protect your turf.

630
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,835
How do you explain three of them
coming down here and invading it?

631
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:47,371
The Thunderbirds are
all on junk, that's why.

632
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:50,341
They're dope
addicts, you know.

633
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:51,809
That's right.

634
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,812
Those boys weren't on junk.

635
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:58,649
You're right. They weren't
on junk, not then anyway.

636
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,840
But it's that Reardon.

637
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:05,195
- What about the other two?
- Aposto?

638
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:10,426
Man, that cat does
anything anybody tells him.

639
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,827
And Di Pace?

640
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,368
He's a wild one.

641
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,003
You know, he helped one of
our guys out of trouble once.

642
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:21,505
Now why would a wop
wanna help a spic?

643
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:24,475
No. It's that Reardon.

644
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,644
He's got holes in his head.

645
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:28,012
I put one of them there.

646
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:32,082
When I smacked that chump, he went
down and I stomp him in the head.

647
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,418
- You know why?
- So he wouldn't get up again.

648
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:39,199
If he did, you might go
down and he'd stomp you.

649
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:41,892
You sound like you've
been stomped before.

650
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:44,153
A touch here and there.

651
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:48,464
Man, this popping is for no one,
man. It's for writing on toilet walls.

652
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,234
It stinks, man, it stinks.

653
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:52,945
That's what this popping is.

654
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,845
Well, the old lady won't let
her baby come down to this place.

655
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:05,416
So, you can talk to
her at her house. Okay?

656
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:06,583
What do I owe
you, bartender?

657
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,052
- The beer's on me.
- Let me.

658
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10,583
I said the beer's on me.

659
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:13,150
Thanks.

660
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,628
Mrs. Escalante.

661
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:29,606
I'd like to talk
with your daughter.

662
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,697
You can talk to
her right here.

663
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:37,648
Louisa, I'd like to ask you,

664
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:40,417
just what happened the
night Roberto was killed?

665
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,286
I told the cops many times.

666
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,957
I know, but I...

667
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,886
I'd like you to tell me.

668
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,243
I was sitting here.

669
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,503
Maria was there.

670
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:01,004
We saw them coming.

671
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:06,276
They jumped for Roberto and
started killing him, that's all.

672
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,677
Did Roberto have a knife?

673
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,238
A knife?

674
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,218
Your policeman keep
asking for this knife.

675
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:15,786
And why? It is not true.

676
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:18,327
Roberto never have a knife.

677
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,791
Three boys said
he pulled a knife.

678
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,350
This is a lie.

679
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:24,407
A girl saw it, too.

680
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:28,026
That is not so.
Who is this girl?

681
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:31,232
Louisa, can you
tell me something?

682
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:34,103
This girl said she saw
something that glittered.

683
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,306
What was it that glittered?

684
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,057
- Glitter?
- Shine.

685
00:49:43,782 --> 00:49:45,647
His harmonica.

686
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:48,819
The harmonica on which
he plays his music.

687
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,770
This is what shined.

688
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,012
This is what you mean.

689
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:01,398
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet our next governor,

690
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:02,888
Mr. Dan Cole.

691
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,536
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

692
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:07,938
Friends, forgive me. I
apologize for being late.

693
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:10,073
Something about
doing a profile on me.

694
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:11,642
Man, that's
great. Just great.

695
00:50:11,643 --> 00:50:13,043
Albany first and
then the White House.

696
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:15,239
Congratulations, sir.

697
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,650
Wonderful, Dan. Food.

698
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:22,352
- Not too rare for Mr. Cole.
- Make mine rare, please.

699
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,554
Make Mr. Bell's rare.

700
00:50:23,555 --> 00:50:26,023
Hank, do you realize that a
conviction in the Escalante case

701
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:28,692
is worth a 50,000 plurality
right in this district alone?

702
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,092
50,000?

703
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,063
Well, that's an
electrical figure.

704
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:35,065
I should say you can count
on that plurality, Dan.

705
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,432
Case going that well?

706
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,203
As of now, I see no reason why we
can't get first degree convictions.

707
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:41,705
You ought to be a shoo-in.

708
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,208
Say, Hank, I got a
great idea for publicity.

709
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:48,479
Why don't you get your picture taken
pulling the switch on the electric chair?

710
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,515
You have a definite
political potential, Hank.

711
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:55,085
But you must have co-operation,
right straight down the line.

712
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:57,321
You don't have to worry
about me, Mr. Cole.

713
00:50:57,322 --> 00:51:00,157
I'm a great believer
in electricity.

714
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:02,793
My wife majored in
sarcasm at Vassar.

715
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:05,228
Yes. Excuse me, please.

716
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:08,254
Now hear this.

717
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:11,058
Order, everyone.

718
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,438
Before Dan Cole tells
us what he thinks,

719
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:17,875
I shall like to tell
you all what I think.

720
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:23,246
I think that Dan Cole is
riding on the crest of a wave.

721
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:28,484
And I'm mighty proud.
I'm proud of our party,

722
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,155
and I'm proud of Dan Cole.

723
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:34,490
And I'm proud of
old Hank Bellini.

724
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:38,462
- Goodbye, Mr. Supreme Court justice.
- We've got a hard campaign coming up

725
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:41,031
and it's going to mean shoulder
to the wheel work for all of us.

726
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:45,002
A few thousand more votes, all you
gotta do is electrocute a few kids.

727
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:47,204
You third-generation
progressive.

728
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:49,740
Sitting up at Vassar getting
your fat checks from daddy.

729
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:51,642
When was the last time you
had to scrounge for a buck?

730
00:51:51,643 --> 00:51:54,044
You think I can afford this
phony idealism of yours?

731
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:58,405
I've got a job to do.
Now get in that car.

732
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:03,420
I'll park the car.
Be back in a minute.

733
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,820
Don't hurry.

734
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,311
Help. Hank!

735
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,611
Hank!

736
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,285
Hank!

737
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:18,021
Karin! Karin!

738
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,960
Karin.

739
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,537
What's the matter,
Karin? What happened?

740
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,972
Those boys. Those boys.

741
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:45,722
How's the little lady
feeling this morning?

742
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,557
How do you think she feels?

743
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,426
We've assigned Kirk and Bronski to
stay with her until this is over.

744
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:52,129
- How do you do?
- Go on and make yourself at home.

745
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,198
There's lots of
coffee on the stove.

746
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,769
Where's that candy store where
the Thunderbirds hang out?

747
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:01,437
Why? Are you thinking of
going up to Italian Harlem?

748
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,840
Well, it wasn't Puerto Ricans
that paid us a visit last night.

749
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:07,744
- All right. I'll go with you.
- No, I wanna return this visit personally.

750
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,913
Now why don't we have the
T-birds picked up and brought in?

751
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,794
What's the address?

752
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,860
117th and 1st,
Moretti's Candy Store.

753
00:54:19,057 --> 00:54:22,497
Pretty Boy Savoricci.
He's your man.

754
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:42,145
Help you, man?

755
00:54:42,213 --> 00:54:46,213
I understand the
Thunderbirds hang out here?

756
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:49,219
Look, mister, I
only sell sodas here.

757
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,584
That's all.

758
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:55,358
I'm from the D.A.'s office.

759
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,061
I have a list of all the names
and addresses of the Thunderbirds.

760
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:00,430
Now, I can have them picked up
and brought down for questioning,

761
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:03,300
or you can tell me where I
can find Pretty Boy Savoricci.

762
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:05,462
Hey. Hey.

763
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:08,672
Come on over.

764
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:16,379
Hey, we were just reading about some
character from the D.A.'s office.

765
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,449
His wife got scared by
some crazy cats last...

766
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,319
Pancho, get the District
Attorney a chair.

767
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,888
- No, thanks.
- That ain't polite.

768
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:26,690
Where's Pretty
Boy Savoricci?

769
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:29,526
You know you got a lot of
courage, Mr. District Attorney.

770
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:32,095
Coming in here,
without no escort.

771
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:34,163
Are you gonna tell me where I
can find Pretty Boy Savoricci,

772
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,066
or do I have to run you in?

773
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:39,169
Well now, what exactly was it
you wanted to see him about,

774
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,160
Mr. District Attorney?

775
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,841
- Where's your telephone?
- Hey, Mr. District Attorney,

776
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,778
what's the matter? Can't
you take a little joke?

777
00:55:47,779 --> 00:55:49,312
Don't get excited.

778
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:51,548
We clown around like
this all the time.

779
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:54,579
Makes life
interesting, you know.

780
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,392
Never mind, I'll
tell him myself.

781
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:07,593
This imbecile from the D.A.'s
office wants to see him.

782
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:15,575
Don't you knock?

783
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,074
Don't you got no manners?

784
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:20,375
You Pretty Boy Savoricci?

785
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,555
You know why they call
me Pretty Boy, Mr. Bell?

786
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:32,989
I can guess.

787
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,427
'Cause I'm ugly.

788
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:40,468
Anybody calls me
ugly, they're dead.

789
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:42,424
Dead.

790
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,850
The table's crooked.
Floor's on a bias.

791
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:48,438
You're a mighty tough
character, aren't you?

792
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:50,006
You've heard of me?

793
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:52,943
Sixteen times I got
my name in the papers.

794
00:56:52,944 --> 00:56:54,277
Most of the time they
give the wrong address

795
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:55,679
or they don't spell
the name right.

796
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,113
Savoricci!

797
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,178
You're a...

798
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:03,005
Are you Italian, too?

799
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,149
Right, Mr. Bell.

800
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,615
Put that back.

801
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,263
Listen, you bum.

802
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,398
Two of your punks came down to
my apartment house last night,

803
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:17,559
and terrorized my wife.

804
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,904
Yeah, I was sorry
to hear about that.

805
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:24,807
Hotheaded kids, you know how it is.
Can't keep an eye on all of your troops.

806
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,043
They're members of your
gang and you're their leader.

807
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:30,046
If it ever happens again, I'll
hold you responsible, personally.

808
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:32,897
Mr. Bell, I
said I apologize.

809
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,152
Now, please tell
your wife I'm sorry.

810
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:38,173
Remember what I said.

811
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:40,022
Mr. Bell.

812
00:57:40,992 --> 00:57:42,653
Cue ball, please.

813
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,456
Thanks, Mr. Bell.

814
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,059
Mr. Bell,

815
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:53,036
it's kind of hard keeping your
boys in line when they hear you

816
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:55,372
spent an evening
drinking with the spics.

817
00:57:55,373 --> 00:57:59,509
We know all about you palling around
with the Horsemen over at the Tres Putas.

818
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,612
They're all on the stuff,
you know that, don't you?

819
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:04,080
That's where they got
their name, Horseman.

820
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:05,821
Big H for heroin.

821
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:09,285
If any of our boys
get on the junk,

822
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,096
I break their arm.

823
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,390
Cue's warped.

824
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,528
Another thing, Mr. Bell,

825
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:20,664
you've been approaching
their star witness.

826
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:25,035
Hated to hear that. Those are three
nice guys you're trying to frame.

827
00:58:25,036 --> 00:58:27,303
Those three nice
guys committed murder.

828
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:30,139
Lots of nice guys, all
through history, kill people.

829
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,209
In a war, the more people you
kill, the more medals you get.

830
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,079
Well, that won't make them
any less nice, does it?

831
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,048
What about the guy who
invented the H-bomb?

832
00:58:38,049 --> 00:58:42,118
And he got the biggest
medal of all. Some honor.

833
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:48,369
Like you went around saying, "What
a great guy, he invented cancer. "

834
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,227
No, sir, Mr. Bell.

835
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,463
You're making a big mistake
trying to frame those three guys.

836
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:58,044
They're okay. Every one
of them. They got heart.

837
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:03,707
Heart to chop
down a blind boy,

838
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,375
playing a harmonica.

839
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:07,610
Maybe that blind kid
needed chopping down.

840
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,412
Did you ever think
of that, Mr. Bell?

841
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:11,848
You think being blind made
that kid an angel or something?

842
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:14,389
Being blind got him killed.

843
00:59:14,485 --> 00:59:17,820
All right. You wanna know
the truth about Escalante?

844
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,421
It'll rock you.

845
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:22,825
I thought he was
just a blind kid, too.

846
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:26,329
So, nobody notices.
So, he's blind, so what?

847
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,531
<i>When I heard the
Horseman were busting out,</i>

848
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:30,500
<i>popping the gang
on the next block.</i>

849
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:32,381
<i>Had myself a look.</i>

850
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:38,274
<i>It was a rumble for real, zip
guns, jackhammers, the works.</i>

851
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:40,643
<i>Then I saw something phony.</i>

852
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:42,545
<i>Something that didn't fit.</i>

853
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:43,944
<i>Blind angel.</i>

854
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:46,644
<i>But why?</i>

855
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:51,888
<i>Cops got the word
and I found out why.</i>

856
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:54,858
<i>The little creep was their
cover-up, their arson.</i>

857
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:57,849
<i>They ditched
their guns on him.</i>

858
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,256
Hey, you!

859
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:09,939
<i>SA VORICCI... Every one of
those Horsemen was clean.</i>

860
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,875
<i>Man, the cops
couldn't hold a one.</i>

861
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:15,545
<i>Smart man. He was a top
warlord in that gang.</i>

862
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:18,156
<i>That nice little blind boy.</i>

863
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:19,873
Hey, Diavolo.

864
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:32,529
I just called you fellows in
to ask you to be nice enough

865
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:37,770
to escort the district attorney
to the edge of our turf.

866
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:54,632
Where does Zorro
live, honey?

867
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:55,983
Thank you.

868
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,632
Hello, Mr. Bell.

869
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:20,542
Come on in.

870
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:31,837
Come into my office.

871
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:53,538
Sit down.

872
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:55,245
Make yourself comfortable.

873
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:58,815
I can't offer you any beer, but I
gladly accept one of your cigarettes.

874
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:00,817
Why did you lie to me?

875
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,452
Did I lie to you, Mr. Bell?

876
01:02:02,453 --> 01:02:06,553
Roberto Escalante was
a leader in your gang.

877
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:13,874
So, you really been
playing detective?

878
01:02:14,265 --> 01:02:15,664
Listen, punk.

879
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:21,905
You may run these three square blocks,
but when I talk to you, I want the truth.

880
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:24,474
Well, it's a cruel
world, Mr. Bell.

881
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:27,443
And blind kids can't sit around doing
nothing just because they're blind.

882
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:30,613
And, since you so interested,
I'll tell you something else.

883
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:32,782
Roberto wasn't just
Louisa's brother.

884
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:34,973
He was her pickup man.

885
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:38,507
Louisa, a prostitute?

886
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:41,033
Louisa's a hooker.

887
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:45,561
And Roberto was a blind
pickup man for his own sister.

888
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:48,631
How does that
grab you, Mr. Bell?

889
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:51,401
And now, I'll tell
you something else.

890
01:02:51,402 --> 01:02:52,862
I don't care.

891
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,971
I don't care if he beat
his mother or sold pot.

892
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:57,106
Roberto was killed in cold
blood by three guys who hated him

893
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,175
because he had darker skin.

894
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:02,312
Reardon came here like those
Japs during the war, kamikaze.

895
01:03:02,313 --> 01:03:04,280
Is it right to stick someone
Spanish on home ground?

896
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,549
He found Roberto
and killed him.

897
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,252
Now, the law says that
you die for that, Mr. Bell.

898
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:14,933
And it's your job to see that
those three guys die for it.

899
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:26,469
Look, we ain't got
much, but this we want.

900
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,639
I don't care whether you're making
out with Di Pace's old lady or not.

901
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,240
Just don't cop out on us.

902
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,918
Give me a cigarette.

903
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:44,554
Hello, Dan? This is
Hank. I'm up in Harlem.

904
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:46,455
Listen to this.

905
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:50,493
It turns out our poor defenseless blind
boy was a top leader in the Horsemen.

906
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:53,496
And a procurer for our star
witness, who at the age of 16...

907
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:56,587
Can you hold it
a minute, Hank?

908
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:01,637
Jack, that press release on
Louisa Escalante, kill it.

909
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:04,140
And you'd better call that
columnist, the one who was gonna do

910
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,275
the poem about the
little blind boy.

911
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:09,956
Tell him to forget
it. Never mind why.

912
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,483
Okay, now, what
does that do to us?

913
01:04:13,484 --> 01:04:15,985
Well, I haven't had time to
figure out all the details.

914
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,755
But I'd like to go back and take
another crack at that Danny Di Pace.

915
01:04:18,756 --> 01:04:20,590
Hank, you can't do it.

916
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:22,959
You're too close to trial to
interrogate those boys now.

917
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,527
The defense would
raise the roof.

918
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:28,297
We've gotta take the chance, Dan. I
want to try to break that boy down.

919
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:30,148
Hank, absolutely no!

920
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:35,238
Dan. I'll call you
when I get back.

921
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:00,938
You look pretty good, Danny.

922
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:05,968
Danny, Mr. Bell has some
questions to ask you.

923
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:09,379
Something very
important has come up.

924
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,315
You can trust him.

925
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,710
Danny, maybe it'll help us.

926
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:18,041
I told you to
stay away from her.

927
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:27,787
Danny, are you a member
of the Thunderbirds?

928
01:05:27,825 --> 01:05:31,194
- Who cares?
- Well, your mother cares for one.

929
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:36,132
I understand you swore. You swore
that you'd never join a gang.

930
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,663
What if I did?

931
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:41,404
Did you break that
promise to her?

932
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:42,963
Did you, Danny?

933
01:05:48,212 --> 01:05:49,338
Why?

934
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:53,180
Why, Danny?

935
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:56,544
The Thunderbirds
are my friends.

936
01:05:58,021 --> 01:06:02,758
Danny, you put Reardon down
once to save a Puerto Rican boy.

937
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,361
Now, what happened in between to
make you go along and kill one?

938
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:08,231
In between I found out
who my friends really are.

939
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:10,666
- Your friends got you in here.
- What are you trying to do?

940
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:13,269
Split me from the rest? Get
me to turn state's evidence?

941
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,338
- You're not like those boys.
- Trust him, you tell me,

942
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:18,541
and he sneaks up on me and tries
to get me to rat on my friends.

943
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:21,511
I shouldn't even be talking
to you, coming here with him.

944
01:06:21,512 --> 01:06:23,779
Yeah, you are pretty cozy
together. What are you doing?

945
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,800
Shacking up with him?

946
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,986
Well, now I know.

947
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,900
Hank, maybe you shouldn't
have walked me home.

948
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:19,402
Maybe it would've been
smarter if you'd dropped me...

949
01:07:19,403 --> 01:07:20,631
Get in.

950
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:29,182
- Thank you, Hank.
- It's all right.

951
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:32,615
I guess I haven't been
much of a mother, huh?

952
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:34,217
Well, maybe if he had a
father, he would have...

953
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:35,947
Yeah, some father.

954
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:39,889
I don't know. I always heard

955
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:43,492
that a boy got in trouble
because he didn't have love.

956
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:47,763
I love Danny more than
anything in the world.

957
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:53,603
You just thank God, Hank. You didn't
have to raise your kid on these streets.

958
01:07:53,604 --> 01:07:55,003
Good night.

959
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:46,583
Doctor, is it all
right if I smoke?

960
01:09:46,817 --> 01:09:49,637
- Lf you have to.
- Gunderson.

961
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,564
How do you feel?
- Oh, man.

962
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:56,331
Man, I feel sick.

963
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,770
That's a surprise.

964
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:00,963
I was this far.

965
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:05,303
This far from killing him.

966
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,610
Hello, Karin. I'm
all right, honey.

967
01:10:14,745 --> 01:10:17,179
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Daddy.

968
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:21,751
I was spiked trying
to steal third base.

969
01:10:21,752 --> 01:10:23,085
Gunderson told us.

970
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:26,521
It's not as bad as it
looks. Just a couple of ribs.

971
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:29,572
I'll be all
right. I'll live.

972
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:35,898
I've got to. I gotta get ready
for that trial a week from Monday.

973
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,466
Or am I confused?

974
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,587
No, not for a minute.

975
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:45,975
I protected my face so I wouldn't
put in too bad an appearance. Vanity.

976
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:49,912
That's the difference between the
police department and the D.A.'s office.

977
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:54,383
You boys protect your pretty faces,
our boys protect their kidneys.

978
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:57,034
Stop making
jokes, Gunderson.

979
01:10:58,054 --> 01:11:00,454
Which gang was it, Daddy?

980
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:05,197
I don't know, gorgeous. T
- birds or Horsemen,

981
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:08,597
may have been
either one or both.

982
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:09,758
Karin,

983
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:16,803
I was choking him
and I couldn't stop.

984
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,360
And I wish to
hell you hadn't.

985
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:22,803
Hadn't stopped.

986
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:31,469
All right, now let's turn him
over on his left side, please.

987
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:35,857
Gently, easy. Gently.

988
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:39,177
- Karin? Yes, love.

989
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:44,364
He was 15 or 16 years old

990
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:51,580
and I was trying with
all my heart to kill him.

991
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,005
You know?

992
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:55,539
I know.

993
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:13,095
<i>- Yes.
- HARD Y... Hello, Bell. We found the knives.</i>

994
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,906
What? Who is this?

995
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:21,185
<i>- This is Lieutenant Hardy.
- Lieutenant Hardy? Oh, hang on a second.</i>

996
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:52,601
<i>- What's the matter, Hardy?
- HARD Y... I said we found the knives.</i>

997
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:54,622
You found the knives?

998
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,941
Is that what you called me for, to
tell me you found those damn knives?

999
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:02,511
<i>What's the matter, Bell, you
said these knives were important.</i>

1000
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,014
Well, what could I possibly do with
them, at this hour of the night?

1001
01:13:05,015 --> 01:13:09,084
<i>- Want a suggestion?
- You're not very funny, Hardy.</i>

1002
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:12,021
<i>- What condition are they in?
- Bloody.</i>

1003
01:13:12,022 --> 01:13:15,457
Well, send them over to the lab. I
want blood type and finger prints.

1004
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:17,660
<i>- After sunrise.
- Aren't you interested</i>

1005
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:18,860
<i>in how we found them?</i>

1006
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,030
Not very. Anything else?

1007
01:13:21,031 --> 01:13:24,533
<i>A lady in Kew Gardens found her
three-year-old daughter chewing on the</i>

1008
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:29,572
<i>handle of one of them in the back
seat of a light green Plymouth.</i>

1009
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:32,942
<i>You helped a lot with the
description of the car, Bell.</i>

1010
01:13:32,943 --> 01:13:36,612
<i>- Dark Ford or Chevy.
- Hardy, don't ever call me</i>

1011
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:41,303
<i>- at this hour of the
night again. - Nighty-night.</i>

1012
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,576
Hank?

1013
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:17,219
Hank, are you all right?
Does anything hurt you?

1014
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:22,140
I'm all right. Ribs are
a little sore, that's all.

1015
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,593
You still got that
lump on your jaw.

1016
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:29,498
We may have to put a little makeup
on that before you go to trial.

1017
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:31,409
That's all I need.

1018
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:41,043
What do you think of your little
victims of social oppression now?

1019
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:42,711
I don't know what you mean.

1020
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:45,714
You were pretty sure of yourself
the other night at Cole's party.

1021
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:48,984
I'm sorry about that, Hank.
I made a fool out of myself.

1022
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,553
Only for
Escalante, you said.

1023
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:54,289
"Darling, I've got a marvelous
idea for a publicity stunt.

1024
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,559
"Get a picture of you pulling a
switch on the electric chair. "

1025
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,995
It's not a very funny joke.

1026
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,196
Voice of the martini.

1027
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:04,299
You weren't that drunk. You
knew what you were saying.

1028
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,736
It's late, let's go to bed, we
can talk about this in the morning.

1029
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:10,339
Those hoodlums scared
you half to death,

1030
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,907
and they almost killed me.

1031
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:15,844
You still think they need special
consideration, special attention?

1032
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:19,014
You don't think I condone
that kind of violence, do you?

1033
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,716
I've gone a hundred
miles out of my way

1034
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:23,018
to find out what makes
these monsters tick.

1035
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:26,055
I've been to Harlem time
and again. To their homes.

1036
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:27,731
They spit in my face.

1037
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:31,560
What more can anyone
do? What would you do?

1038
01:15:31,561 --> 01:15:34,096
- I don't know.
- Don't you?

1039
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:35,664
All right, I made a mistake.

1040
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:40,485
Was it a mistake? Don't
you believe what you said?

1041
01:15:42,272 --> 01:15:47,822
All right, Hank, I meant every
word I said the other night.

1042
01:15:58,021 --> 01:16:00,251
Something else you said.

1043
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:02,385
Old Hank Bellini.

1044
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:05,661
Danny Di Pace said it, too.

1045
01:16:05,662 --> 01:16:11,352
"What's the matter, Mr. Bellini?
You ashamed of being a wop?"

1046
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:14,469
My old man was ignorant.

1047
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:17,806
He thought the way to be a good
American was to change your name.

1048
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:21,009
It was always easy for me to
explain, "My father did it. "

1049
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:25,314
Now I realize I not only went
along with it, I was glad.

1050
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:30,385
I was secretly glad my name
was Bell instead of Bellini.

1051
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:33,996
It was part of
getting out of Harlem.

1052
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:40,741
- Like marrying you.
- You married me because you loved me.

1053
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:44,433
Hank, I know what
you're going through now.

1054
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:47,424
Somehow you'll
find the answer.

1055
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:11,860
"Grand jury of the county of
New York by this indictment

1056
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:16,632

Di Pace and Anthony Aposto

"Signed, foreman of the Grand

1063
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:47,162
- Bell? Does the
Defense wish to open?

1064
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:49,831
This is the lab
report on these knives.

1065
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:53,324
- Your Honor.
- Thanks, Hardy.

1066
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,371
- Aren't you gonna read it?
- When I get ready.

1067
01:17:56,372 --> 01:18:00,008
- Didn't think we'd find them, did you?
- You didn't, they just turned up.

1068
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,177
It's quite interesting,
you better read it.

1069
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:05,514
...it is not fact
but a mere accusation.

1070
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:07,282
I'm sure you will
keep your minds open

1071
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:10,652
until you have heard all
the evidence from both sides,

1072
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:13,589
and that your verdict
will be a just one.

1073
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:16,340
Thank you for
your attention.

1074
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:21,129
State your name,
address and age.

1075
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:24,580
Louisa Maria Philippa
Garcia Escalante,

1076
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:29,837
Forty-nine and a half, West
110th Street, 16 years old.

1077
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,174
Louisa, are you the
sister of the murdered boy?

1078
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:35,377
Objection. Rephrase
your question, Mr. Bell.

1079
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:38,180
Are you the sister
of Roberto Escalante?

1080
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:39,375
I was.

1081
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,184
On the afternoon
of July 25, 1960,

1082
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:44,518
were you seated on the front
steps of the apartment house

1083
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:48,190
where you live at 49 and
a half, West 110th Street?

1084
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:51,260
- Yes, sir. Who
was there with you?

1085
01:18:51,261 --> 01:18:53,629
- My brother,
Roberto. Anyone else?

1086
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,632
Yes, sir. My
friend Maria Creva.

1087
01:18:56,633 --> 01:19:00,803
- What were you doing there?
- I was talking.

1088
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:02,665
And your brother?

1089
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:06,516
He was making music
on the harmonica.

1090
01:19:06,576 --> 01:19:10,212
The three of you were seated on the
front steps minding your own business,

1091
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:12,881
watching the world go
by. Is that correct?

1092
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:16,772
Roberto was not
watching the world go by.

1093
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:19,817
- You mean he was blind?

1094
01:19:20,254 --> 01:19:21,290
- Yes.

1095
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:24,960
- And he was playing the harmonica?
- Yes.

1096
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:28,891
Did anything happen
to disturb that moment?

1097
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:35,294
- Them! Those boys
were... Louisa. Louisa.

1098
01:19:35,672 --> 01:19:37,902
Try to control yourself.

1099
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:39,799
Sit right down.

1100
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:48,965
Try to tell me as clearly and as
calmly as you can just what happened.

1101
01:19:50,053 --> 01:19:53,113
Three boys came
down the street.

1102
01:19:54,424 --> 01:19:57,064
When they got by our stoop,

1103
01:19:57,393 --> 01:20:00,562
they pulled knives
out of their pockets

1104
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:02,413
and stabbed Roberto.

1105
01:20:03,599 --> 01:20:07,769
They stabbed him many
times. They killed him.

1106
01:20:10,673 --> 01:20:12,273
Did he draw a knife?

1107
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,210
He did not have no knife.

1108
01:20:14,211 --> 01:20:19,156
Did he act in any way as though
he were going to attack them?

1109
01:20:19,157 --> 01:20:22,147
Why would he
attack those boys?

1110
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:25,630
He did not know
they was there.

1111
01:20:25,631 --> 01:20:27,154
He was blind.

1112
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,810
Why would he attack
those three boys?

1113
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:41,679
What did the boys
do then, Louisa?

1114
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,204
They run away.

1115
01:20:43,448 --> 01:20:46,317
Did you get a good look at
them before they ran away?

1116
01:20:46,318 --> 01:20:47,581
Yes, sir.

1117
01:20:47,653 --> 01:20:49,853
If you saw them again,
would you recognize them?

1118
01:20:49,854 --> 01:20:53,644
- Yes, sir.
- Are they in this courtroom?

1119
01:20:53,825 --> 01:20:55,487
Right over there.

1120
01:20:57,563 --> 01:21:01,999
Louisa, just so there can be
no possibility of a mistake.

1121
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,736
Just so the court will know
exactly who you are talking about,

1122
01:21:05,737 --> 01:21:09,406
I want you to leave the witness stand, go
to the three boys who killed your brother,

1123
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:15,477
and place your hand on the shoulder
of each one to identify them.

1124
01:22:14,273 --> 01:22:19,010
Miss Escalante, now the court realizes
the extent of your emotional involvement

1125
01:22:19,011 --> 01:22:22,211
- in this case.
- Nice work, Hank.

1126
01:22:23,148 --> 01:22:24,615
Here, read this.

1127
01:22:24,616 --> 01:22:25,983
Quite interesting.

1128
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:27,384
I'm not through
with her yet.

1129
01:22:27,385 --> 01:22:32,456
- Now, if you'd like a short
recess... No, I'm all right.

1130
01:22:32,457 --> 01:22:34,367
I'll be all right.

1131
01:22:36,795 --> 01:22:39,463
I want to answer
the questions.

1132
01:22:39,464 --> 01:22:42,831
Louisa, what is
your occupation?

1133
01:22:43,968 --> 01:22:48,068
- Occupation?
- What do you do for a living?

1134
01:22:52,377 --> 01:22:58,897
You're under oath, Louisa, remember
that. What do you do for a living?

1135
01:22:59,084 --> 01:23:00,614
I am a hooker.

1136
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:06,872
You mean you're
a prostitute?

1137
01:23:07,092 --> 01:23:10,952
- Yes.
- When did you become a prostitute?

1138
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:12,527
I was 14.

1139
01:23:12,797 --> 01:23:16,601
You became a prostitute
when you were 14?

1140
01:23:16,602 --> 01:23:19,036
- Yes.
- Were you coerced into it?

1141
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:22,639
Objection, Your Honor. I see no
purpose to this line of questioning.

1142
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,309
Bell, do you have a point
here, which applies to the case?

1143
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:27,990
I do, Your Honor.
- Proceed.

1144
01:23:31,182 --> 01:23:33,684
Were you coerced
into this profession?

1145
01:23:33,685 --> 01:23:35,085
Coerced?

1146
01:23:35,153 --> 01:23:37,554
Did someone, an older
man for instance,

1147
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:40,685
cause you to
become a prostitute?

1148
01:23:41,659 --> 01:23:44,890
No, sir. I thought
of it myself.

1149
01:23:45,264 --> 01:23:47,874
Thought of it yourself, why?

1150
01:23:50,869 --> 01:23:54,471
We had no money and
my mother was sick.

1151
01:23:54,472 --> 01:23:56,832
Couldn't you get a job?

1152
01:23:56,975 --> 01:23:58,306
I was 14.

1153
01:23:58,943 --> 01:24:02,914
I tried to get a job, they do
not give me a working permit.

1154
01:24:02,915 --> 01:24:06,775
- What about your brother?
- He was blind.

1155
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:12,450
Did you make some
money this way?

1156
01:24:12,624 --> 01:24:13,853
I did.

1157
01:24:14,293 --> 01:24:18,873
Did your mother ask you
where you got the money?

1158
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:23,088
- Yes.
- What did you tell her?

1159
01:24:24,903 --> 01:24:28,093
I told her I was
on the street.

1160
01:24:28,473 --> 01:24:31,108
You told your mother
you were a prostitute?

1161
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:33,649
- Yes.
- What did she say?

1162
01:24:37,081 --> 01:24:38,446
She said,

1163
01:24:41,085 --> 01:24:43,895
"Why didn't we let her die?"

1164
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:48,425
Mr. Bell, why are you
pursuing this line?

1165
01:24:48,426 --> 01:24:52,095
Your Honor, I'm trying
to get at the truth.

1166
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,764
Thank you, Louisa.

1167
01:24:53,765 --> 01:24:55,475
No more questions.

1168
01:24:55,533 --> 01:24:59,363
- Your witness, Mr.
Randolph. No questions.

1169
01:25:08,247 --> 01:25:10,267
Is the Defense ready?

1170
01:25:10,482 --> 01:25:14,818
Your Honor, the Defense
requests a short recess.

1171
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:17,949
Court will recess
for 10 minutes.

1172
01:25:27,799 --> 01:25:29,901
That was a masterful
presentation, Hank.

1173
01:25:29,902 --> 01:25:31,568
Come on out to the hall. Have
your picture taken with me.

1174
01:25:31,569 --> 01:25:33,237
You go ahead, Dan. I
want to look this over.

1175
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:34,978
We're ready, Dan.

1176
01:25:37,075 --> 01:25:38,599
That was nice.

1177
01:25:46,518 --> 01:25:49,520
State your name,
age and address.

1178
01:25:49,521 --> 01:25:53,855
Anthony Aposto, 16,
and what was that?

1179
01:25:54,293 --> 01:25:55,783
Your address.

1180
01:25:58,596 --> 01:26:02,033
The court has Anthony
Aposto's address.

1181
01:26:02,034 --> 01:26:03,744
Anthony, sit down.

1182
01:26:07,906 --> 01:26:12,076
Anthony Aposto, are you
also known as Batman?

1183
01:26:12,744 --> 01:26:16,844
- Yeah.
- Well, why do they call you Batman?

1184
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:22,986
I don't know, everybody
calls me Batman.

1185
01:26:22,987 --> 01:26:25,627
Where did you get the name?

1186
01:26:26,457 --> 01:26:30,137
- Batman, he's in the comics.
- I see.

1187
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:33,363
Do you like reading
comic books, Anthony?

1188
01:26:33,364 --> 01:26:39,102
- Yeah, sure I like the pictures, you know?
- What about the words, Anthony?

1189
01:26:39,103 --> 01:26:41,672
Well, they're okay
too, I guess, yeah.

1190
01:26:41,673 --> 01:26:47,193
Well then, perhaps you have a
little trouble with the words.

1191
01:26:49,047 --> 01:26:52,282
You know, I'm not
such a hot reader.

1192
01:26:52,283 --> 01:26:55,933
Anthony, what do you
like about Batman?

1193
01:27:03,461 --> 01:27:08,251
Batman. Well, he ain't
afraid of nothing, you know.

1194
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:14,267
And, well, he wears this
cool black suit all the time.

1195
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:18,309
And he's always
fighting, you know.

1196
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:21,460
Do you like to
fight, Batman?

1197
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:25,148
- Sure.
- Are you a good fighter, Batman?

1198
01:27:25,149 --> 01:27:28,151
Oh, boy. My old man will tell you. You
know something, I pack a hell of a wallop.

1199
01:27:28,152 --> 01:27:29,786
- That's right.
- Why?

1200
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:34,267
- Has he watched you?
- No, I walloped him once.

1201
01:27:34,459 --> 01:27:37,689
Why do you like
to fight, Batman?

1202
01:27:39,597 --> 01:27:41,462
I don't know why.

1203
01:27:41,532 --> 01:27:43,272
Try to think why.

1204
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:46,770
Why what?

1205
01:27:48,207 --> 01:27:51,108
Just try to think
why you like to fight.

1206
01:27:51,109 --> 01:27:53,443
Because it makes
me feel good.

1207
01:27:53,444 --> 01:27:56,246
You really got your work
cut out for you here.

1208
01:27:56,247 --> 01:27:59,282
He's even got me convinced
this kid is a nut.

1209
01:27:59,283 --> 01:28:05,423
Anthony, if this court frees you,
what will you do with your life?

1210
01:28:06,724 --> 01:28:09,026
Am I going to get sprung?

1211
01:28:09,027 --> 01:28:11,863
Just answer the
question, Anthony.

1212
01:28:11,864 --> 01:28:14,654
- The question?
- The question.

1213
01:28:15,133 --> 01:28:20,543
If this court frees you, what
will you do with your life?

1214
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,530
I don't know.

1215
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:30,882
If you were released this afternoon,
what would you do for the rest of the day?

1216
01:28:30,883 --> 01:28:35,013
- I'd go back to the block.
- And tomorrow?

1217
01:28:38,156 --> 01:28:40,819
- Tomorrow?
- Yes. Tomorrow.

1218
01:28:42,895 --> 01:28:45,729
I don't know. I mean, I gotta
know what I do tomorrow? You know.

1219
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:49,660
Anthony, please try
to answer the question.

1220
01:28:51,302 --> 01:28:52,860
I don't know.

1221
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:02,339
Dr. Walsh, you heard
Anthony Aposto testify

1222
01:29:02,413 --> 01:29:05,283
that he likes to fight,
because it makes him feel good.

1223
01:29:05,284 --> 01:29:07,851
Could you explain this
testimony to the jury?

1224
01:29:07,852 --> 01:29:09,853
In laymen's terms, please.

1225
01:29:09,854 --> 01:29:14,524
Aposto's gratification from
fighting stems from two sources.

1226
01:29:14,525 --> 01:29:17,415
One, fighting
gives him status.

1227
01:29:17,729 --> 01:29:22,598
And two, in laymen's
terms, Aposto enjoys pain.

1228
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:26,169
Dr. Walsh, do you
believe Anthony Aposto

1229
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:29,773
to be capable of an act, say
an act of extreme violence,

1230
01:29:29,774 --> 01:29:32,324
which requires
premeditation?

1231
01:29:32,945 --> 01:29:38,265
Premeditation would not be
consistent with Aposto's pattern.

1232
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:43,920
- The state of New York... May I?
- By all means.

1233
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:46,423
...is your employer,
is it not, Dr. Walsh?

1234
01:29:46,424 --> 01:29:48,326
I work for the state, yes.

1235
01:29:48,327 --> 01:29:53,917
You realize you are testifying
against the state of New York.

1236
01:29:53,966 --> 01:29:55,557
I realize that.

1237
01:29:55,868 --> 01:30:01,171
Doesn't it frighten you to be testifying
in opposition to your employer?

1238
01:30:01,172 --> 01:30:02,806
The truth is the truth.

1239
01:30:02,807 --> 01:30:04,609
We've gotta get
our own man up there

1240
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:06,743
and demolish that
testimony and do it now.

1241
01:30:06,744 --> 01:30:09,312
Later, it won't
have any impact.

1242
01:30:09,313 --> 01:30:10,780
Dr. Andrade,

1243
01:30:10,848 --> 01:30:13,683
as a qualified psychiatrist, I'd
like to talk to you for a moment

1244
01:30:13,684 --> 01:30:15,619
about Arthur Reardon.

1245
01:30:15,686 --> 01:30:18,488
In your report to our office,
you indicated that he had

1246
01:30:18,489 --> 01:30:21,024
more than normal aggression,
I believe you said.

1247
01:30:21,025 --> 01:30:24,661
- Along with delusions of grandeur.
- Yes, those are parts of my findings.

1248
01:30:24,662 --> 01:30:28,799
He had fantasies about becoming a
very important man in his neighborhood.

1249
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,804
He dreamed about growing up to be a
bigger man in his field than Al Capone.

1250
01:30:33,805 --> 01:30:35,095
Yes, he did.

1251
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:37,440
Doctor, you are a very
experienced psychiatrist.

1252
01:30:37,441 --> 01:30:40,378
In your opinion, your
professional opinion,

1253
01:30:40,379 --> 01:30:44,848
what is the cause of these
unmanageable aggressions and delusions?

1254
01:30:44,849 --> 01:30:46,316
- Fear.
- Fear?

1255
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:49,119
Arthur Reardon is a very
frightened young man.

1256
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,922
Would you say as a
generalization he's

1257
01:30:50,923 --> 01:30:54,391
insecure or as a specific,
that he is a coward?

1258
01:30:54,392 --> 01:30:56,860
Well, a layman might
so describe him. Yes.

1259
01:30:56,861 --> 01:30:58,728
A coward and a bully.

1260
01:30:58,729 --> 01:31:01,199
I don't know what the word
bully means to you, Mr. Bell.

1261
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,700
A bully is a
person so cowardly

1262
01:31:03,701 --> 01:31:07,504
that he attacks only those
who cannot defend themselves.

1263
01:31:07,505 --> 01:31:09,245
Like a blind boy.

1264
01:31:10,641 --> 01:31:13,844
I would call him a
bully and a coward.

1265
01:31:13,845 --> 01:31:16,314
It's a lie, you
stinking pig!

1266
01:31:16,315 --> 01:31:18,748
Order. Order!

1267
01:31:18,816 --> 01:31:20,613
Arthur, sit down!

1268
01:31:20,686 --> 01:31:23,920
Order, let there be
order in this court.

1269
01:31:23,921 --> 01:31:27,015
Father, he's making me sick.

1270
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:30,962
I instruct the court attendants
that in the event of another outburst

1271
01:31:30,963 --> 01:31:32,597
from this defendant,

1272
01:31:32,598 --> 01:31:35,131
they are to bind
him and gag him,

1273
01:31:35,132 --> 01:31:37,734
so that this trial will
not be interrupted again.

1274
01:31:37,735 --> 01:31:40,937
Nobody's gagging me! This country
has free speech, doesn't it?

1275
01:31:40,938 --> 01:31:43,608
Why are they trying to tell
me what I can say and do?

1276
01:31:43,609 --> 01:31:45,175
Gag the defendant.

1277
01:31:45,176 --> 01:31:49,716
Why are you trying to
gag me? I got my rights.

1278
01:32:05,898 --> 01:32:09,199
Hank, this is gonna
work against us.

1279
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:13,905
This makes him look like a hotheaded
maniac, instead of a cold-blooded killer.

1280
01:32:13,906 --> 01:32:19,476
We're going to have a terrible
time proving premeditation now.

1281
01:32:19,477 --> 01:32:20,944
Dr. Andrade,

1282
01:32:21,647 --> 01:32:24,981
you testified that in
your professional opinion

1283
01:32:24,982 --> 01:32:28,618
Anthony Aposto was aware of the
quality and nature of his act

1284
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:30,420
when he stabbed
Roberto Escalante.

1285
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:31,979
Objection!

1286
01:32:32,056 --> 01:32:34,357
When and if he stabbed
Roberto Escalante.

1287
01:32:34,358 --> 01:32:36,938
- That is correct.
- Doctor,

1288
01:32:38,462 --> 01:32:42,499
how can you say what was definitely
in the mind of Anthony Aposto

1289
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,669
when and if he
stabbed another boy?

1290
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:47,771
So far science has found
no means of determining

1291
01:32:47,772 --> 01:32:52,142
what definitely goes
on in the mind of a man.

1292
01:32:53,045 --> 01:32:56,446
If Anthony Aposto did not
know what he was doing,

1293
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:59,082
then he'd be innocent in the
eyes of the law, wouldn't he?

1294
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:02,252
I'm afraid I can't answer
questions about the law.

1295
01:33:02,253 --> 01:33:04,220
Let me put it
this way, Doctor.

1296
01:33:04,221 --> 01:33:08,191
Is there in your mind the
slightest shadow of a doubt

1297
01:33:08,192 --> 01:33:09,893
that Anthony Aposto
knew what he was doing

1298
01:33:09,894 --> 01:33:11,828
when he stabbed
Roberto Escalante?

1299
01:33:11,829 --> 01:33:14,564
But I have no
psychic powers.

1300
01:33:14,565 --> 01:33:16,499
I can't answer
your question.

1301
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,569
You are aware that under the
laws of the United States,

1302
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:22,672
a man is presumed innocent till proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

1303
01:33:22,673 --> 01:33:24,470
Oh yes, I am.

1304
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:26,543
Thank you, Doctor.
No more questions.

1305
01:33:26,544 --> 01:33:29,412
That's all, Doctor.
Call the next witness.

1306
01:33:29,413 --> 01:33:31,673
We call Daniel Di Pace.

1307
01:33:35,286 --> 01:33:36,720
What are you doing?

1308
01:33:36,721 --> 01:33:39,389
- I'm looking for the truth.
- There's a proper procedure

1309
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:41,359
for arriving at the truth.

1310
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,326
I didn't put you on
this case to lose it.

1311
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:45,428
I'm looking for justice.

1312
01:33:45,429 --> 01:33:47,761
The jury decides justice.

1313
01:33:49,567 --> 01:33:53,037
I'm taking you off
this case, Hank.

1314
01:33:53,404 --> 01:33:54,894
Do that, Dan.

1315
01:33:54,972 --> 01:33:56,973
I'd like to hear you
explain it to the newspapers.

1316
01:33:56,974 --> 01:34:00,210
Would you have stabbed him
if he hadn't drawn his knife?

1317
01:34:00,211 --> 01:34:01,269
No, sir.

1318
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:05,148
So you only stabbed
him to defend yourself.

1319
01:34:05,149 --> 01:34:06,789
Thank you, Danny.

1320
01:34:06,984 --> 01:34:09,144
Your witness, Mr. Bell.

1321
01:34:15,927 --> 01:34:20,196
Your Honor, I have here three
knives I'd like to place in evidence.

1322
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:23,967
Also, a sworn statement
by one Angela Rugiello,

1323
01:34:23,968 --> 01:34:27,038
to the effect that these are the
knives handed her by the defendants,

1324
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:28,870
on July 25.

1325
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:31,374
Her statement goes on to
say that Angela Rugiello

1326
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:33,343
wrapped the knives
in a newspaper,

1327
01:34:33,344 --> 01:34:36,079
and threw them in the backseat of
an automobile that same afternoon,

1328
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,782
in the same condition in
which they were given to her.

1329
01:34:38,783 --> 01:34:41,551
And finally, I have
a police lab report,

1330
01:34:41,552 --> 01:34:43,853
on the condition of the
knives when they were found.

1331
01:34:43,854 --> 01:34:46,990
I would like to place this in
evidence, but at the proper time.

1332
01:34:46,991 --> 01:34:48,758
May I have the
knives, please?

1333
01:34:48,759 --> 01:34:50,609
Mark this statement.

1334
01:34:55,366 --> 01:34:59,126
- You recognize these knives, Danny?
- No.

1335
01:34:59,971 --> 01:35:01,705
You're under oath, Danny.

1336
01:35:01,706 --> 01:35:04,074
Don't add perjury to
the charge against you.

1337
01:35:04,075 --> 01:35:06,643
Is that any worse than
going to the chair, huh?

1338
01:35:06,644 --> 01:35:08,904
I don't recognize them!

1339
01:35:13,351 --> 01:35:16,931
- This your knife?
- I don't remember.

1340
01:35:18,389 --> 01:35:19,788
This one?

1341
01:35:20,925 --> 01:35:22,665
I don't remember.

1342
01:35:26,731 --> 01:35:28,498
What about this one?

1343
01:35:28,499 --> 01:35:29,799
I don't remember.

1344
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,969
Don't you recognize any of these
knives? Any one of them at all?

1345
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:34,938
Objection! Badgering
the witness.

1346
01:35:34,939 --> 01:35:37,274
Witness has already
answered the question.

1347
01:35:37,275 --> 01:35:38,775
Objection sustained.

1348
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:41,745
Danny, are you afraid to
admit which knife is yours?

1349
01:35:41,746 --> 01:35:43,046
No, I'm not afraid!

1350
01:35:43,047 --> 01:35:45,348
Then why can't you recognize
your knife when you see it?

1351
01:35:45,349 --> 01:35:48,718
Objection! Counsel is assuming
a fact not in evidence.

1352
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:52,856
There is no testimony linking any
of the knives with the witness.

1353
01:35:52,857 --> 01:35:54,667
I'll sustain that.

1354
01:35:55,693 --> 01:35:59,162
Danny, you're a very bright
young man, with a very high IQ.

1355
01:35:59,163 --> 01:36:02,299
You think the jury is going to believe
that you can't recognize your knife

1356
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,567
when you see it?

1357
01:36:03,568 --> 01:36:06,970
I don't care whether
they believe it or not.

1358
01:36:06,971 --> 01:36:09,406
Who spotted Roberto
Escalante first?

1359
01:36:09,407 --> 01:36:11,675
- I don't remember.
- Who stabbed him first?

1360
01:36:11,676 --> 01:36:13,376
We all stabbed him
at the same time.

1361
01:36:13,377 --> 01:36:14,945
How many times
did you stab him?

1362
01:36:14,946 --> 01:36:17,213
- I don't remember!
- I saw you at Welfare Island,

1363
01:36:17,214 --> 01:36:20,650
you told me you stabbed
Roberto Escalante four times!

1364
01:36:20,651 --> 01:36:22,141
I must object!

1365
01:36:22,219 --> 01:36:24,821
I'll rephrase the
question, Your Honor.

1366
01:36:24,822 --> 01:36:26,221
Danny,

1367
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:30,360
did you or did you not confess
that you stabbed Roberto Escalante?

1368
01:36:30,361 --> 01:36:32,095
Yeah. In self-defense.

1369
01:36:32,096 --> 01:36:35,665
Did you also not confess that
you stabbed him four times?

1370
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:37,667
- Answer yes or
no! Objection.

1371
01:36:37,668 --> 01:36:40,337
Witness can always
explain his answer.

1372
01:36:40,338 --> 01:36:44,374
The witness will please
answer the last question.

1373
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:46,843
Yeah! I guess I said that.

1374
01:36:46,844 --> 01:36:49,713
- And you stabbed him
with this knife? I object!

1375
01:36:49,714 --> 01:36:51,514
- Answer yes
or no! I object!

1376
01:36:51,515 --> 01:36:54,217
Counsel has still failed
to identify the knife.

1377
01:36:54,218 --> 01:36:57,988
I cannot question this witness properly,
if my every word is going to be examined!

1378
01:36:57,989 --> 01:36:59,756
You're bullying the witness!

1379
01:36:59,757 --> 01:37:01,424
Damn it, you put him on the
witness stand, didn't you?

1380
01:37:01,425 --> 01:37:05,161
Mr. Bell, I must caution you
about profanity in this courtroom.

1381
01:37:05,162 --> 01:37:06,763
Your Honor, I'm sorry.

1382
01:37:06,764 --> 01:37:09,432
But I think I'm on the verge of
establishing which knife is his.

1383
01:37:09,433 --> 01:37:11,833
If I may proceed, please.

1384
01:37:11,869 --> 01:37:14,337
Witness will answer
the last question.

1385
01:37:14,338 --> 01:37:16,373
Read back the last question.

1386
01:37:16,374 --> 01:37:20,024
"And you stabbed him
with this knife. "

1387
01:37:21,512 --> 01:37:23,002
Well, Danny?

1388
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,548
- Look, what if it is my?
- Answer the question, yes or no!

1389
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:27,717
- Is this your knife?
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1390
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:29,852
- And how many times did you stab him?
- Four! Four!

1391
01:37:29,853 --> 01:37:31,955
- Why, Danny?
- I told you he came at me...

1392
01:37:31,956 --> 01:37:33,890
- Why Danny?
- I don't know!

1393
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:36,921
- Why? Why?
- Because the others,

1394
01:37:39,063 --> 01:37:40,897
because the others, they...

1395
01:37:40,898 --> 01:37:43,166
- Because the others stabbed him.
- Yes! Yes! And they...

1396
01:37:43,167 --> 01:37:46,603
- So you stabbed him?
- Yes, I stabbed him four times!

1397
01:37:46,604 --> 01:37:49,539
Look, what do you want
from me? I stabbed him!

1398
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:51,241
I stabbed him!
I stabbed him!

1399
01:37:51,242 --> 01:37:53,009
You're lying, Danny.

1400
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:55,100
You never stabbed him.

1401
01:37:55,779 --> 01:37:58,448
Your Honor. I want this
report placed in evidence.

1402
01:37:58,449 --> 01:38:01,585
It's an official report from the
criminal identification laboratory.

1403
01:38:01,586 --> 01:38:05,956
It states that the switchblade knife,
the one with the black and white handle,

1404
01:38:05,957 --> 01:38:10,126
the one you identified as your knife, did
not have a single trace of blood on it.

1405
01:38:10,127 --> 01:38:12,596
Your knife, Danny. And not
a single trace of blood.

1406
01:38:12,597 --> 01:38:15,298
- No! No! I wiped it clean.
- Nobody can wipe it that clean.

1407
01:38:15,299 --> 01:38:17,533
Nobody can wipe it so
clean that the police lab

1408
01:38:17,534 --> 01:38:19,703
wouldn't find a single
trace of blood on it.

1409
01:38:19,704 --> 01:38:22,105
No, Danny. You never
stabbed him at all.

1410
01:38:22,106 --> 01:38:24,040
- You only pretended to stab him!
- No! No!

1411
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:27,644
You turned the handle of the blade around
and you stabbed him here on the shoulder!

1412
01:38:27,645 --> 01:38:31,376
No! No! I stabbed
him! I stabbed him!

1413
01:38:31,448 --> 01:38:36,238
You're lying, Danny. Danny,
what are you afraid of?

1414
01:38:37,888 --> 01:38:41,368
Danny. Did you kill
Roberto Escalante?

1415
01:38:42,826 --> 01:38:46,126
I never killed
anybody in my life.

1416
01:38:46,664 --> 01:38:50,896
Never, never.
Oh, God! Never.

1417
01:38:52,737 --> 01:38:55,347
All right, Danny. All right.

1418
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,364
I hate crying.

1419
01:38:59,877 --> 01:39:01,745
Crying is for babies.

1420
01:39:01,746 --> 01:39:04,006
Crying is for men, too.

1421
01:39:08,252 --> 01:39:10,902
Who killed
Roberto Escalante?

1422
01:39:11,622 --> 01:39:14,490
Anthony Aposto,
a mental defective

1423
01:39:14,491 --> 01:39:17,126
that an efficient society would
have taken off the streets long ago?

1424
01:39:17,127 --> 01:39:21,798
Arthur Reardon? A young man so
crippled by the pressures and poverty

1425
01:39:21,799 --> 01:39:23,749
of slum life that...

1426
01:39:24,068 --> 01:39:27,404
That his rage makes him even
more dangerous than Aposto,

1427
01:39:27,405 --> 01:39:31,475
and less capable of
controlling his emotions?

1428
01:39:32,677 --> 01:39:34,417
Or Danny Di Pace.

1429
01:39:35,612 --> 01:39:39,916
Whose values are so twisted
by the strange social order

1430
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:42,452
that he's afraid to
admit he didn't kill.

1431
01:39:42,453 --> 01:39:45,473
Mr. Bell, you're
out of order.

1432
01:39:48,392 --> 01:39:50,102
Sorry, Your Honor.

1433
01:39:50,728 --> 01:39:52,648
No further questions.

1434
01:39:53,764 --> 01:39:55,254
Mr. Randolph?

1435
01:39:58,069 --> 01:40:01,266
Your Honor, the
Defense rests.

1436
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:04,500
This court will recess.

1437
01:40:06,143 --> 01:40:09,679
Mr. Bell, my newspaper is very
disappointed in your performance.

1438
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,715
Tell me, did your friendship
with Mary Di Pace...

1439
01:40:11,716 --> 01:40:14,484
Go out and write anything
you want. No comments!

1440
01:40:14,485 --> 01:40:18,187
Mr. Cole, are you expecting to
be sent to the Governor's mansion

1441
01:40:18,188 --> 01:40:20,790
on the prestige you're
going to get from this case?

1442
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:22,792
- Any statements?
- Just one.

1443
01:40:22,793 --> 01:40:24,913
Keep out of my sight.

1444
01:40:36,473 --> 01:40:38,134
Arthur Reardon,

1445
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:40,309
the sentence
of this court is

1446
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:43,446
that you be confined in
the Elmira Reception Center,

1447
01:40:43,447 --> 01:40:50,447
for a period of not less than 20 years
and no more than your natural life.

1448
01:40:51,588 --> 01:40:53,147
Anthony Aposto,

1449
01:40:53,957 --> 01:40:58,662
this court commits you to the Matteawan
State Hospital for the criminally insane,

1450
01:40:58,663 --> 01:41:06,253
until such a time as you may be judged
ready to again take your place in society.

1451
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:08,671
Daniel Di Pace,

1452
01:41:09,206 --> 01:41:12,809
you've acted in concert with
the other two defendants,

1453
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:16,390
and as such, you
became an accomplice.

1454
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:20,883
However, the court has seen
fit to be lenient in your case,

1455
01:41:20,884 --> 01:41:24,321
finds you guilty of
third degree assault.

1456
01:41:24,322 --> 01:41:27,623
We're gonna send you to the
boy's prison at Elmira, New York,

1457
01:41:27,624 --> 01:41:30,124
for a period of one year.

1458
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:35,064
For classification,
treatment and rehabilitation.

1459
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:37,429
This court is adjourned.

1460
01:41:54,151 --> 01:41:55,278
Hank?

1461
01:41:57,287 --> 01:42:00,313
Hank. Hank.

1462
01:42:10,601 --> 01:42:12,791
And what about my son?

1463
01:42:13,004 --> 01:42:17,064
Is this your justice
for a dead blind boy?

1464
01:42:17,474 --> 01:42:21,364
What about the animals
who killed my son?

1465
01:42:22,312 --> 01:42:26,792
A lot of people killed
your son, Mrs. Escalante.
