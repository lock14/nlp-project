1
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,399
- Fuck!
- It's not there.

2
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,444
It's in the kitchen where you left it.

3
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,405
How'd you get in?

4
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,325
You have a nice family.

5
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,456
They're fine. Alive.

6
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,667
Asleep.

7
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,004
- Are you gonna kill me?
- If I was, I'd have done it

8
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,676
when you walked to the car this morning and
been gone by the time you hit the sidewalk.

9
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,554
- Then why are you here?
- To talk.

10
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,183
But, Mike, if you make me kill you,
you will not go alone.

11
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,352
Sit.

12
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,493
Are you a good man, Inspector?

13
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,329
- I think.
- And yet you've killed men.

14
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,750
- Yes.
- I'm gonna ask you a question.

15
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,130
How you answer it
will determine how this night ends.

16
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,217
How does a good man decide when to kill?

17
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,347
The man you've been chasing
is a killer, a ghost.

18
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:15,272
Rumour has it that he works for a group
known only as The organisation.

19
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,275
It's so secret no one knows it exists.

20
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:23,155
It takes no sides,
yet it has ties to every government.

21
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:28,744
Its sole purpose is the training
and conditioning of professional killers.

22
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,997
These men are selected at birth -

23
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,249
rejects, orphans.

24
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,753
All of them unwanted and disposable.

25
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:43,675
They are made experts in every aspect of
combat and programmed for one purpose -

26
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,719
to kill.

27
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,349
The man you have been chasing
for the last three years, Inspector,

28
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,642
is the very best of them.

29
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,520
Put him there.

30
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,657
You shouldn't have stolen from me, brother.

31
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,534
Now you must pay.

32
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,422
Where is the document?

33
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,094
- Say it!
- I'm sorry...

34
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:33,100
- What happened to his voice?
- He made me swallow...

35
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:38,980
- What did you do to his voice?
- Nothing, ovie. Exactly as he was delivered.

36
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,358
Delivered?

37
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,530
- You didn't find him?
- No. A contractor. An American.

38
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,743
Swallow what?

39
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,248
Swallow what?

40
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,170
Run!

41
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,224
We have all heard your theories, Inspector.

42
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,436
This isn't a theory. This is our guy.

43
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,441
No motive, no forensic evidence,
no witnesses. He's... he's a ghost.

44
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:27,070
- How long have you chased this "ghost"?
- Three years.

45
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,158
Well, thank goodness you have Interpol
to finance your persistence, huh?

46
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:36,371
Despite being the anus of the Third World, we
are in attempt of competent police work here,

47
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,125
and it is our belief that
Bwana ovie was killed by his own brother.

48
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:45,172
oh, so he choked down a pound of C4
and knocked on ovie's door?

49
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,590
Probably.

50
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:52,220
General, this man truly is the best
at what he does.

51
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,183
He is likely responsible
for over one hundred deaths.

52
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,435
Let me show you what I mean.

53
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,439
This is ovie.

54
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,989
And these are just the ones we know about.

55
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,575
Are you beginning to get the picture?

56
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,017
They might kill you for that.

57
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:45,982
For what you're doing to that whisky -
brutalising it with ice.

58
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,238
Never more than two cubes.
It waters down the Scotch.

59
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:57,619
I'm sorry. Aftermath
of my pretentious ex-husband, I'm afraid.

60
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,287
No.

61
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,459
I'm June. And you are?

62
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,298
This is where you tell me your name.

63
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,468
Excuse me.

64
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:10,752
Africa job complete. The money
has been wired to your account. Nice work.

65
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:16,591
Regrettably, the next target date
has been moved up at the client's request.

66
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,553
And the client wishes it to be public.

67
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,351
I've planned something more subtle.
I've made preparations.

68
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:31,064
Incumbent Russian president
Mikhail Belicoff's recent political shift

69
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,192
is in direct conflict with our client's interests,

70
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,362
and threatens their control
of the Russian government.

71
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:42,450
The client needs it to be public.
Do you accept the new parameters?

72
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,662
Yes.

73
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,374
We appreciate
you breaking normal protocol.

74
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,460
The specifics are being uploaded.

75
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,227
I, for one, will not let cowardice deter me.

76
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,571
Mr Belicoff?
In light of your political positions,

77
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,949
will the hardliners
continue to support your re-election?

78
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,993
one only needs to be...

79
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,714
We have a problem.
There was a witness in St Petersburg.

80
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,636
- How reliable are your sources?
- Impeccable, as always.

81
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,641
Interpol has arranged the pickup.
Will you intercept?

82
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,977
- Yes.
- Uploading data.

83
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,741
How much?

84
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,465
I can't be sure.

85
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,675
He never works again so quickly.

86
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,431
But the Russians say that Belicoff was grazed
by a single bullet from over 4km away.

87
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,100
But it definitely sounds like him.

88
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,602
Yes, sir.

89
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,314
Well, what bothers me is that he missed.

90
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:46,611
Yes, sir. I know what
this investigation has cost. I...

91
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,238
I understand. I just need a little more time.

92
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:53,743
- Sir, you need to see this.
- Sorry, sir. I'm gonna have to call you back.

93
00:15:56,163 --> 00:16:00,083
oK. He shoots the bodyguard
to get a clean shot at Belicoff.

94
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,544
He splits these two civilians
by inches. Keep watching.

95
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,214
Keep an eye on the bodyguard. See that?

96
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,424
Back it up. Back it up again.

97
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,639
- An awful lot of arterial spray for a miss.
- Sir. You have a call.

98
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,475
- Whittier.
- They found Belicoff's shooter.

99
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,478
- They found him?
- Tip from a hotel concierge.

100
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,190
- Concierge where?
- Grand Hotel. He recognised his picture.

101
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:28,361
A picture?
Where the hell did they get a picture?

102
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,656
- I don't know, sir.
- All right. I'm on my way.

103
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,743
They found him.

104
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:40,164
Contact the Russian Secret Police,
tell them Interpol has jurisdiction.

105
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:45,086
They are to keep him under surveillance only.
No one moves until we get there. No one!

106
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,178
Was the target not at the location?

107
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:58,016
The girl was there, but she was no witness.
She'd never seen me before.

108
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,519
We will be unable to transmit payment
for the Belicoff assignment

109
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,355
as the task was not completed.

110
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,651
No. He took a direct hit
through the nasal cavity. I watched it myself.

111
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,697
Please wait. Uploading live news feed.

112
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:20,329
.. so afraid of my message
that cowardly violence is their only response.

113
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,540
That was the scene outside...

114
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,709
Who was the client?

115
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,631
Answer me!
Who ordered the hit on Belicoff?

116
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:40,433
If you set me up, I will find you and I will
burn that building to the ground around you.

117
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:04,373
Mike Whittier, Interpol.
What's the status of my suspect?

118
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:10,213
I was told you were coming, Inspector. I am
Captain Gudnayev, St Petersburg Militsiya.

119
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,007
Please make yourself comfortable.

120
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,593
- My men are almost in position.
- For what?

121
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:19,430
We were informed the suspect intends to flee.
My orders are...

122
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,184
Whoa, whoa. orders from who?
Interpol has jurisdiction here.

123
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:29,023
Militsiya's only responsible for the extraction.
Gudnayev is not directing the operation, I am.

124
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,110
I'm Chief Agent Yuri Marklov of the FSB.

125
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,656
The FSB? Why the hell is
the Russian secret police involved in this?

126
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,663
- Sir, they're going in.
- Get your men out.

127
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:49,710
- You have no idea who you're dealing with.
- These men are capable of handling this.

128
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,505
Shoot on sight.

129
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,342
Do not give that order!

130
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,156
47, it's Diana. I could be retired
for contacting you directly.

131
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,619
The client was... Belicoff.

132
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,415
Your location has been compromised.

133
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,355
Come on.

134
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:08,516
Stay here, cover the elevator.
Call me on my cell and tell me where it stops.

135
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:04,363
- Yeah?
- Five dead in the lift. None of them our boy.

136
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,242
He's on the third floor. He must've
opened the doors from inside the shaft.

137
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,042
Freeze!

138
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,506
Get down.

139
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,341
Don't move.

140
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,261
Get down.

141
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,778
Fuck!

142
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,198
Sir!

143
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,241
We had him.

144
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,302
- How many men did you lose?
- 16 dead.

145
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,056
No! No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't touch that!

146
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:19,522
- Where'd you get your fucking licence?
- I need the room, Captain.

147
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,420
- Where does he get all this stuff?
- Can you make it work?

148
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,258
Probably. Why?

149
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,017
I've been looking for you, Inspector.

150
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,061
I think we started off on the wrong foot.

151
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,733
Who informed you
of the whereabouts of my guy?

152
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,069
I believe it's time we had a chat, you and I.

153
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,655
Jenkins.

154
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,282
Yes, sir.

155
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,708
This assassin...

156
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,378
My associates tell me
you believe him to be freelance.

157
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,339
Your associates tell you that?

158
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:12,009
You do not believe he is connected
with Central Intelligence Agency?

159
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,722
- Why do you ask?
- No reason. It just seems a bit naive.

160
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,016
Well, it's a theory.

161
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,728
Yes, a theory.
But a theory shared by Moscow.

162
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:28,442
In accordance with Article 1764.3
of the EU Charter,

163
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,654
any state matters
which deal directly with intelligence

164
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,366
shall be the sole jurisdiction
of the host country.

165
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,537
Ah, and the light bulb comes on.
Took me a minute. Must be the jet lag.

166
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:44,083
- You're telling me to fuck off?
- No, no, of course not.

167
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:48,170
You are a good man, Michael.
one of Interpol's best.

168
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,633
But leave this intelligence work to the FSB.

169
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,348
And Belicoff?

170
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,439
I'm sorry?

171
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:12,152
There's two things wrong with this photo.
one: the footage has been tampered with.

172
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,991
Someone inserted that civilian
to cover up what actually happened.

173
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:23,205
- And the second thing?
- My boy doesn't miss.

174
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,625
- Delivery.
- You're supposed to leave this at the desk.

175
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,252
Mr Belicoff sent them.

176
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,096
Make a sound, I'll end your life. Understand?

177
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,098
Who else is inside?

178
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,435
I know you, from the street earlier today.

179
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,646
- You're coming with me.
- I can't.

180
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,981
oK, oK! I'll get my coat.

181
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,663
- Where are you taking me?
- Somewhere safe.

182
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,415
- Get in.
- Fuck you! I'm not getting in there!

183
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,126
There's a dead man in there!

184
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,589
Get me out of this car!

185
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,573
Are you going to kill me?

186
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,624
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

187
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,545
Before today on the street,
have you ever seen me?

188
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,131
- Why were you there?
- My boyfriend.

189
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,509
- He told me to meet his driver on the corner.
- Belicoff?

190
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:46,306
How, after I put a bullet through his head, was
he able to give that speech this afternoon?

191
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,272
Then you're of no use to me.

192
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,233
Wait! Wait! There is something.

193
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,654
Doubles. Mikhail has doubles,
just like Saddam Hussein.

194
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,491
The man I shot was not an impostor.
Belicoff is dead.

195
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,594
Why'd you tattoo your face?

196
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:28,432
Because it's the only place
I knew Belicoff wouldn't hit.

197
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,981
Tell me about Udre Belicoff.

198
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,609
Mikhail's brother?

199
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:42,237
He runs slave girls, drugs, weapons.

200
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:47,117
Both the CIA and FSB want him dead.
Mikhail's been protecting him.

201
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,037
Get up. Get up. You're coming with me.

202
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,081
I can't. He'll kill me
if he finds out I left the apartment.

203
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,502
Belicoff hired me to kill him,
used you to set me up.

204
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,380
The dead man in the trunk was your driver.

205
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,219
He was gonna use it on you.

206
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,056
You're as good as dead without me.

207
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,143
Where are you going?

208
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:18,357
I'm gonna finish the job I was hired to do
and find out who's behind this.

209
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,233
I'm gonna finish the job I was hired to do
and find out who's behind this.

210
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,581
I need to talk to you.

211
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,750
I need coffee. Follow me.

212
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:43,465
We have three roadblocks - here, here, here.

213
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,426
We completely shut down
international airport.

214
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,389
All border security has been tripled.
He cannot get out of city.

215
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,100
- Train stations?
- Temporarily closed.

216
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,229
- And St Petersburg Station?
- No trains leave Russia from this station.

217
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:01,358
only commuter trains
headed towards interior.

218
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:05,153
What makes you think
he go further into Russia?

219
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,490
Because I know him better than anyone.

220
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,161
Thanks for the coffee.

221
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,388
Go to the last platform and wait.

222
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,600
- Why?
- Now.

223
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,001
- Jenkins, anything?
- Nothing.

224
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,170
Stay sharp.

225
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:08,091
I don't know, sir.
It seems odd for him to come here.

226
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,511
Trust me. This is where he'll be.

227
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,341
Jenkins, bench. Shaved head.

228
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,470
Got him, boss.

229
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,151
Fuck!

230
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,657
Jenkins.

231
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,087
I'm still on him, boss.
Platform... number nine.

232
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,007
Boss?

233
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,757
You've gotten slow.

234
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,595
Tell me why.

235
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,182
Why is there a hit on me?

236
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,522
Stay here.

237
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,691
How about dying with a little dignity?

238
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,346
You think it's done? It's just beginning.

239
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,029
I told you to wait.

240
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,073
I know.

241
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,491
I'm sorry.

242
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,422
I... I know...

243
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,112
Freeze!

244
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,166
You're the one who's been tracking me.

245
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,627
The Russian Militsiya
have got the terminal locked down.

246
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,714
You need a hostage, take me.

247
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,508
Come on.

248
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,636
He hasn't seen your face.
He doesn't have to die.

249
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,597
Take me instead.

250
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,497
Please...

251
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,665
stop.

252
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,050
She saved your life.

253
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,623
He said your ribs are broken. Unlucky.

254
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:32,674
- You seem awfully calm, considering.
- Your assassin is dead.

255
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:37,053
Why are you covering this up?
You know that's not our killer.

256
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:41,224
I told you before, Inspector.
This is no longer your affair.

257
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:45,562
Now, there are two ways we may proceed.
one: my men accompany you to the hospital,

258
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:50,024
and when you and your associate can travel,
they will escort you to the airport.

259
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,237
Then I will write a report
extolling Interpol for its help.

260
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,073
- Medals will probably be involved.
- or?

261
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:02,287
I report your incompetence and disregard
for my nation's laws to your superiors.

262
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,999
This will find its way
to the state prosecutor in Moscow.

263
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,128
So how do you think
we should proceed, huh?

264
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,260
How about...

265
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,429
go fuck yourself.

266
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,619
- I was running out of oxygen!
- Don't be dramatic.

267
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,621
- Dramatic!
- I got rid of the body!

268
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,207
- I've been there for hours!
- I brought you breakfast.

269
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,072
I'd thank you if I wasn't so mad at you.

270
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,616
Look at me.

271
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:27,121
Back at the station, you interfered.

272
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:31,209
I'm sorry. I can't allow that.

273
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,588
- I swear I'll never...
- Stop talking.

274
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:42,762
If you're looking for a reason not to kill me,
I don't really have one.

275
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,267
I'm not a whore by choice.

276
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:52,146
Belicoff owns me. I'm his property.

277
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:57,318
Would you like to know
how much he paid for me? 300. American.

278
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,116
I've tried to escape. The last time...

279
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,328
It is a strange thing to wish to die.

280
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,045
So are you?

281
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,590
Going to kill me?

282
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,052
No.

283
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,599
You don't want to fuck me
and you don't want to kill me.

284
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:14,187
I've never felt so much indifference
in my entire life.

285
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,525
If you ever again interfere with me like that...

286
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,652
I won't.

287
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,363
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

288
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,703
Eat your sandwich.
I need to get some sleep.

289
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,416
- You know...
- Nika?

290
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:39,712
- Yes?
- Stop talking or I'll put you back in the trunk.

291
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,489
This was a royal fucking mess.

292
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,577
Get me a secure line.

293
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,294
Wait outside.

294
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,720
Are we on a secure line?

295
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,222
Yes, Comrade.

296
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,725
I heard you lost him at the station again.

297
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,728
If you're trying to make me nervous,
it is working.

298
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,730
Keep it low profile
while we track him down.

299
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,276
Don't appear in public
and he won't be able to reach you.

300
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:48,489
Comrade Yuri. All of those bodies you buried
and yet a single man eludes you.

301
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:54,745
The operation will not be a success
until he and that whore are dead.

302
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,749
I gotta give it to you, sir. Pretty slick.

303
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,128
Go fuck yourself.

304
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,673
It was a pretty stupid idea, actually.

305
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:10,386
If we get caught, we'll be making snow cones
in Siberia for the next 20 years.

306
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,680
Yet here we sit...

307
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,352
If I don't appear in public, you fuck,
how am I supposed to be re-elected?

308
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,979
Belicoff?

309
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,317
Shit! Hide that thing.

310
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,453
We came to see Chief Agent Yuri. What's up?

311
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,623
He is very busy man.
He asks you to go directly to the airport.

312
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,709
We will escort you there immediately.

313
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,170
oK.

314
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,992
It's for you.

315
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:23,376
- After all these years, I'd think you'd trust me.
- Tell me what you know.

316
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,045
officially, nothing.

317
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:30,299
Unofficially, it appears your employer
is throwing you to the wolves.

318
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,469
- Why?
- Belicoff's softening political stance

319
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:37,264
and his refusal to cooperate with hardliners
upset a lot of people.

320
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,517
So they ordered the hit and replaced him.

321
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:44,063
Seems you and your friend are the only ones
who know Belicoff is a double.

322
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,148
What's the CIA's position?

323
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,235
Company usually likes to be
on the side of whoever wins.

324
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,404
Take the envelope from the girl.

325
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:00,371
Ah, Udre Belicoff,
Mikhail's younger brother.

326
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,582
- Rumour is you'd like him to disappear.
- That is the rumour.

327
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,378
- I'd like to help.
- How's killing Udre Belicoff gonna help you?

328
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,380
Let me worry about that.

329
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:14,010
- What do you want for your trouble?
- Small favour.

330
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,353
This is a small favour?
I can't do this, not in your time frame.

331
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:29,358
- Keep reading.
- Jesus Christ. Tell me it isn't what I think it is.

332
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:32,028
oK. It's not what you think it is.

333
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:37,783
But I'd expect the last thing you'd want
is for me to be arrested with that file.

334
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,497
oK. I'll try.

335
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,666
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

336
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:50,588
We know Udre's been planning something
with a German arms dealer named Price.

337
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,215
The two have never met.
That's your way in.

338
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,343
Intercept Price and you get a shot at Udre.

339
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,847
I'll get you his file.
They're meeting in Istanbul in two days.

340
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:00,806
I'll get you his file.
They're meeting in Istanbul in two days.

341
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,370
Good morning.
Have you slept at all?

342
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,705
Some.

343
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:32,213
You know, you can sleep in the bed.
I won't bite you.

344
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,173
Unless you pay me.

345
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,725
It's not polite to stare.

346
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,617
So when are you gonna tell me your name?

347
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,495
- Get dressed.
- What for?

348
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,622
We're going to dinner.

349
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,291
We need to buy you a new dress.

350
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:14,421
You're really quite charming
when you aren't killing people.

351
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,581
- This place looks nice.
- Yeah.

352
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,083
Don't you think?

353
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,671
Wait here.

354
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,757
Hey! What did you do? Eat without me?

355
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:46,180
- How did you know I wouldn't take off?
- I didn't. We have reservations at eight.

356
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,106
Jenks, how do you feel?

357
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:01,237
My pride hurts worse
than my arm, sir. Any word?

358
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:08,244
The sketch is out to all Interpol substations in
Europe, stations, airports, border crossings...

359
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,205
- What's that?
- This is what I wanted to show you.

360
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:15,084
It's every appearance Belicoff has made
within the last 12 months.

361
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:19,255
This is from a speech
he made in London on May 7th.

362
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,967
And this is from some shitty political
luncheon in northern Georgia.

363
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:26,178
Someone took a photo from a mobile phone.

364
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,055
Look at the date.

365
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,474
May 7th. How is that possible?

366
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:35,187
I can't be sure, but unless he's figured out
how to be in two places at once...

367
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,398
- He has a double.
- He's paranoid enough.

368
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:41,485
- It explains the arterial spray.
- I hope he had health benefits.

369
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:53,747
When I was little I had this squirrel,
you know, with black stripes on the back?

370
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,544
- Chipmunk.
- Right, chipmunk. His name was Tishka.

371
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,589
I'm sorry, sir,
but this is for another gentleman.

372
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,467
- Table 26?
- That's right.

373
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,263
My mistake.

374
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,726
You know what table that is?

375
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,186
I saw the layout when we came in.

376
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,981
- Do you remember everything you see?
- No.

377
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:24,194
- What's the soup of the day?
- Lentil with sautéed onions and tomatoes.

378
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,656
The woman behind you, what's she wearing?

379
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,035
- With the red hair and the silk dress?
- Yeah.

380
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,203
That's not a woman.

381
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,509
What colour underwear am I wearing?

382
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,596
You're not wearing any underwear.

383
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,570
Come with us, sir.
Here we go. It'll be all right...

384
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,947
Nika, ask for the check.

385
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,533
- But I'm not done!
- Then hurry.

386
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:21,085
You scratch what I said
about you being charming.

387
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,473
Sorry, sir.

388
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,598
Mr Price.

389
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,185
Thank you for the introduction
to Udre Belicoff.

390
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,356
Little help, please.

391
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,957
- What the fuck?
- Let's go.

392
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,584
What?

393
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,586
Now.

394
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,262
Well, that was lovely.

395
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,724
Right up to the time
you dragged me out by my hair.

396
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,935
Undress me.

397
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:07,608
So we are good with firearms.
Not so good with ladies undergarments.

398
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,403
Careful. I'm not wearing any panties.

399
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,697
Nika, you're drunk.

400
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,574
And?

401
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,494
And this is a very bad idea.

402
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,997
You mean this?

403
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,208
Yes, that.

404
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,126
How about this?

405
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,464
Definitely that.

406
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,052
Then...

407
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,596
this must be really bad.

408
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,394
- The briefcase.
- Mr Price!

409
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:31,525
So you took it upon yourself to change
our appointment. How forward of you.

410
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:38,073
As I told your men, I was attacked earlier
by some lunatic. Common sense dictated...

411
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:43,078
Common sense should have dictated
you not abuse my good nature.

412
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,080
Sit.

413
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:57,259
I was just going over a few of my lines
with some of your competitors.

414
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,099
Lines.

415
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,727
My lines. You get it?

416
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,064
Where was I?

417
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,027
He's not Price.

418
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:34,755
This is the... the Kedr 9mm compact.

419
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:40,552
It's less than two kilograms,
select fire single or fully automatic.

420
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,099
Empty... and safe.

421
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:54,775
or if you're looking for an assault rifle, I have
the M203 with under-barrel grenade launcher.

422
01:00:55,568 --> 01:01:00,364
A lot of Third World dictators
got a lot of 7.62s stockpiled.

423
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,658
Saves them from having to buy ammo.

424
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:07,162
Everything here is available in bulk,
of course.

425
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,623
Prices not negotiable.

426
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,087
Any questions, Mr Price?

427
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,130
Yeah.

428
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,050
What about the little one there?

429
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:25,722
Here. I show you.
This is a Makarov. 22.

430
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,642
A favourite of the KGB.

431
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:32,187
Particularly effective in the right hands.

432
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:36,233
But for a real target,
you need to find a soft spot.

433
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,403
Whoa, hold up. Hey, wait.

434
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,781
This is not a Kedr. It's a Chinese copy.

435
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:48,286
I don't know if it's the drugs or you're usually
this inept, but you're wrong about these guns.

436
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:53,166
If the gun you're holding is as cheap as this
one, even if you could shoot her in the eye,

437
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,795
and I'm not saying you could,
you wouldn't kill her.

438
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:42,234
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I need you to help me with your brother.

439
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,403
Mikhail? Fine. Fuck him!

440
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:50,367
I do whatever you want!
What the fuck do you want me to do?

441
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,745
Just this.

442
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:11,072
It says here that when the male penguin
meets the female penguin,

443
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:15,577
he knows in the first ten seconds
whether he's gonna like her or not.

444
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,289
- Are you listening?
- I'm listening.

445
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,541
I read that.

446
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,419
These articles are full of shit.

447
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:28,715
- Why do you buy these magazines?
- For the advertisements.

448
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:34,596
- What do you need luggage like this for?
- That perfectly holds my sniper rifle and 245,

449
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,601
and a gag for irritating talkative little girls
like you. You want me to stop and get it out?

450
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:43,188
I don't know.
You think we have time for foreplay?

451
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:01,122
You know, when I was a little girl,
my father raised grapes.

452
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:07,170
And I told him that one day
I'd own my own vineyard.

453
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,180
It looks nice.

454
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,479
We need to get off the road.

455
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,271
We need to get off the road.

456
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:55,010
Jenks.

457
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:59,180
- Is that his suitcase? How did we get that?
- As a consolation prize,

458
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:03,601
Captain Gudnayev sent me our boy's stuff
from the hotel in St Pete in case it might help.

459
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,687
- Anything?
- Not much.

460
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,691
There is... this.

461
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:15,280
What do you make of this?

462
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:24,247
"Trust unto God
and He shall direct your path. " It's...

463
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:29,127
That's Psalms. I never figured our boy
as the religious type.

464
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,629
That's strange.

465
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,398
Nika...

466
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,526
I have to go.

467
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,656
So much for happy endings.

468
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,954
I don't want you to do this.

469
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:09,667
Belicoff needs to die.

470
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,962
I don't care about that. Not any more.

471
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:18,093
As long as he is alive,
they will never stop looking for you.

472
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,629
Take this.

473
01:08:54,713 --> 01:09:00,510
At the next station, get off the train
as soon as it stops. Move with the crowd.

474
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:04,681
But I don't even know your name.

475
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:09,144
The place I was raised, they didn't
give us names. They gave us numbers.

476
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,563
Mine was 47.

477
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:16,109
Well, that explains a lot.

478
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,573
- How will I find you?
- Don't worry. I'll find you.

479
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,368
What are you going to do?

480
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,203
What I do.

481
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:11,664
You have no idea the pain
involved in the procedure.

482
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,752
They peel back the skin of the face

483
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:21,591
and screw a Teflon frame to the bones
to duplicate the facial features.

484
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:26,763
I wonder, if I had known the pain involved

485
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,767
would I still have gone through
with this whole double business.

486
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,438
You're drunk!

487
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:39,275
You don't want to drink
with your new president, Tovarishch?

488
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,778
We are celebrating, yes?

489
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:46,074
All the evidence is erased.

490
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,368
Mikhail Belicoff.

491
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,331
And his pathetic brother Udre.

492
01:10:55,668 --> 01:11:00,463
Now I'm the one and only,
and the one man I have asked you to kill -

493
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:05,134
the only one who can expose us -
is the one man not in this room!

494
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,641
So... tell me, Tovarishch,

495
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,435
what exactly have you done to find him?

496
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,399
It seems if we wait long enough,
he will find you.

497
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,403
Us, Tovarishch Yuri. He will find us.

498
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:26,489
The organisation
has sent in their best operatives.

499
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:32,495
I know. Don't let your incompetence hinder
them. We won't have this conversation again.

500
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:57,186
Belicoff's brother was found dead in Istanbul.
They're waiting for the body in Moscow.

501
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,732
- Heads up.
- Michael, how's things going?

502
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:06,529
Belicoff's brother has been found murdered.
It's our guy. He's setting Belicoff up.

503
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:10,992
We're getting pressure from the ministry
and the EU to drop this investigation.

504
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:15,038
- The Russians will confirm...
- They're the ones leading the EU on this.

505
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,332
They deny your ghost exists

506
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:22,128
and filed papers with the minister's office
claiming you've overstepped your authority.

507
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:23,463
Who did?

508
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:29,510
The FSB. Specifically Chief Agent
Yuri Marklov. I need you to stop!

509
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:33,514
No, you don't understand.
The FSB is covering this up.

510
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:37,185
He killed Belicoff's brother.
Now, why? Unless...

511
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:41,689
.. Mikhail Belicoff will attend
funeral services tomorrow morning...

512
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:47,779
The funeral. He's trying to take Belicoff
at Udre's funeral.

513
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:19,662
This generator produces over 3,000 amps.

514
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:25,460
Much more than is necessary, but I wanted
you to understand the gravity of the situation.

515
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:29,005
At 2:30, that radio taped to your hand
will activate.

516
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:33,176
You'll have 30 seconds
to order the shooting of your friend Belicoff.

517
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,721
If you don't, the generator will start.

518
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,974
Your skin will melt,
your blood will vaporise.

519
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:43,603
There won't be enough left of you to identify.

520
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:47,148
You have gone to a great deal of trouble.

521
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:50,109
I am just a bureaucrat.

522
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:52,987
There is nothing I can do for you, I'm afraid.

523
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:54,614
I disagree.

524
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:56,574
This is not a request.

525
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:00,620
This situation is fixed,
and you know both possible outcomes.

526
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:06,209
Live or die. Your choice.

527
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:10,004
Here's something
to keep things in perspective.

528
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,551
I picked it up last night
when I was in your house.

529
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:20,473
- You bastard!
- If I were you, I'd keep that radio dry.

530
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:24,685
Yell all you like.

531
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,146
The Lord himself won't hear.

532
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:54,757
There are over 100 highly trained
alpha special forces soldiers in this cathedral.

533
01:15:55,050 --> 01:16:00,304
It would be foolish to attempt any type of
violence. Your assassin would realise this.

534
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,224
But what if he does? Look around you.

535
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,643
How much civilian blood will be shed?

536
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:10,606
We are prepared for that as well.
Gas canisters are being deployed.

537
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:14,193
If anything occurs,
the civilians will be rendered unconscious.

538
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,654
Now, if you will excuse me...

539
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:13,711
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to start by
thanking you for your sympathy and prayers.

540
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,719
one minute, 50 seconds.

541
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,054
Come in.

542
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,061
We are deeply grateful.

543
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:35,107
My brother, he was a troubled man,
but he was not always like that.

544
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,320
one minute, 25 seconds.

545
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,699
one minute, 20 seconds.

546
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:48,371
Should we choose to be kind
and let her die, much like my brother?

547
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:54,126
or should we do what is necessary,
what is hard, to save what we love?

548
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,713
one minute.

549
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:06,013
I, for one, will not fail again,
not with this country.

550
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:10,101
Not with our children's future,
not with you - my countrymen.

551
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:15,606
35 seconds.

552
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,360
Hurry, come in!

553
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,946
Change target! Shoot Belicoff!

554
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,322
Are you sure?

555
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,032
Do it!

556
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:33,624
Come on.

557
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,129
Just fucking do it now!

558
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,987
Do not let the assassin escape.
Release the gas.

559
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,657
Lock down the doors.
I suggest you and your men follow me.

560
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:09,368
Let's go!

561
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:18,395
Your man has made a mistake.
There is no exit. He's trapped.

562
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:23,734
It doesn't make sense.

563
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,654
Why would he...?

564
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:34,161
"Trust unto God...

565
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:38,374
and He shall direct your path. "

566
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:41,085
Shit. He set this up from the beginning.

567
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:41,228
- Where does this key fit?
- The archbishop's personal chambers.

568
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:44,189
The third tower over the Moskva.

569
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:48,110
He's going into the river, like in St Pete.

570
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:50,571
Jenks, get our men. Let's go.

571
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:56,493
He is in the southwest tower.
Call in the gun ships.

572
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,330
Do not let him escape!

573
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,292
Seems I underestimated you.

574
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,461
Consistently.

575
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,131
A miscalculation on my part.

576
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:15,012
Who are you?

577
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:19,141
- Answer me.
- Let me help you.

578
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:21,435
How? By having me killed?

579
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:24,480
Ah, no. For that I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

580
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:28,275
Was Nika a mistake? or did you
destroy her life for your amusement?

581
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:33,739
What? You think you can take
what has cost millions, years of planning,

582
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:37,326
for the good of this country,
and destroy that?

583
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,620
Then what? Walk away?

584
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,998
You don't think they will let you do that?

585
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:49,630
If you kill me, they will never let you go.
They will hunt you for the rest of your life.

586
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:03,602
You did your job,
and you did it very well.

587
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:07,648
And for that, my boy, you should be proud.

588
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:09,441
That's it?

589
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,736
Yes. I'm offering you your life back.

590
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:16,281
That is why you are here, yes?
That is what you want.

591
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,412
- No?
- No.

592
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,418
He shot the president.

593
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:59,510
- Interpol! Drop your weapons!
- We have an arrest warrant for that man.

594
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:08,102
Don't move! Hands on your head!
on your head! on your knees!

595
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,312
Don't do anything stupid.

596
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:57,067
Just one thing.

597
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:01,155
Knowing how this ends, was it worth it?

598
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,157
Killing Belicoff?

599
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,117
Knowing how this ends...

600
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:08,412
definitely.

601
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:11,707
What do you make of that?

602
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:15,669
Hell.

603
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:38,108
- Who the hell are you?
- Agent Smith, Central Intelligence Agency.

604
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:42,029
- All you men, to the rear of that vehicle.
- You don't have jurisdiction!

605
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:45,741
We aren't here. Which means
when we shred you with automatic fire,

606
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,286
then this will never have happened.

607
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:52,664
We believe
you're involved in terrorist activities.

608
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:56,043
We're Interpol. In accordance with Section 3...

609
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:58,629
We're transporting an international criminal.

610
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,589
What criminal?

611
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:05,135
- oh, Jesus Christ!
- You know what? I'm sorry, man.

612
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,681
My mistake.
I thought you were someone else.

613
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:12,017
You prick!

614
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:17,648
on behalf of the US Government, I'd like
to extend to you our sincerest apologies.

615
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:22,152
Load up, boys.

616
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:54,268
- So now what?
- Now you have to answer my question.

617
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,395
Are you a good man, Inspector?

618
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:01,525
- I think.
- And yet you've killed men.

619
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:06,947
So, Inspector,
how does a good man decide when to kill?

620
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:14,955
If I think a man means to do me or my family
harm, then I'll do whatever I can to stop him.

621
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:17,124
But beyond that...

622
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,295
it's a crapshoot.

623
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,383
The key.

624
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:34,141
You knew I had jurisdiction and would
walk you right out through the front door.

625
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:37,269
I wanna be left alone.

626
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:40,147
- Just like that?
- Yeah. Just like that.

627
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:48,530
This is the man you've been looking for.

628
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:53,160
Ballistics will confirm
he was shot by your weapon.

629
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:56,580
The magazine is in the nightstand
next to your bed.

630
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:00,542
- Don't forget it when you call your superiors.
- Did you kill him here?

631
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:06,006
It's five. If you wait till the girls go to school,
you won't have to expose them to this.

632
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,968
- Explains why you waited so long to call it in.
- I can't go along with this.

633
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:12,346
I hope you can.

634
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,599
For both our sakes.

635
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,227
Goodbye, Michael.

636
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,985
I hope I never see you again.

637
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,313
I told you to leave her alone.

638
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,649
You should've listened.
