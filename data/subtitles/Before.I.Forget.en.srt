2
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,912
Before I forget

3
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,119
We'll be in peace.
You'll stop making scenes.

4
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,477
And the pigeons won't shit on us.
There are no trees.

5
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,437
That's true.

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,670
You can watch the people go by.

7
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,830
Who is it?

8
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,070
The bailiff for Didier Fromand.

9
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,795
- What's it about?
- Parking tickets.

10
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,078
His address is care of Mr Pierre Pruez.
Am I in the right place?

11
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,674
He's left, he's in Switzerland.

12
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,876
Do you have his new address?

13
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,717
He left m e a m o nth ag o.
I'm very unhappy.

14
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,593
Sorry.

15
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,075
He pisses me off with his tickets!

16
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,270
I'm b ad ly p arked,
there was no space.

17
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,708
It's the road works.

18
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,434
Let's go?

19
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,792
Close the door, please.

20
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,674
I'm not doing well.

21
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,159
Get on your knees.

22
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,073
Suck me.

23
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,033
Lick.

24
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,119
Lick, I said.

25
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,759
Lick my balls.

26
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,719
There...

27
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,989
Deeper.

28
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,559
Deeper, I said!

29
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,033
I'm suffocating.

30
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,838
Suck gently.

31
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,838
Jerk me off with your hand.

32
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,359
Faster.

33
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,033
You like that!

34
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,397
You like big cocks.

35
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,231
Yes.

36
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,549
Yes, who?

37
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,039
Yes, master.

38
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,158
I'm your master, hey?

39
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,311
- Say I'm your master.
- Yes, master.

40
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,399
Get on all fours.

41
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,151
On the carpet. Like a bitch.

42
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,514
It burns, Marc.

43
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,035
Get on all fours, on the carpet.

44
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,275
No cream, I don't like it to slide.

45
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,277
Get on all fours, I said.

46
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,473
Go gently, Marc.

47
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,351
- It hurts.
- Shut up, bitch.

48
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,959
And call me master.

49
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,752
Go on, squeal.

50
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,912
Squeal like a girl.

51
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,239
I can't, Marc...

52
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,119
Take a high voice.

53
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,793
Take a high voice, like a girl.

54
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,028
Next time I'll bring
my girlfriend's panties.

55
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,158
Go on, squeal!

56
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,158
You like cocks, hey?
Here!

57
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,719
I want to be your pimp.
I'll take your money.

58
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,035
You have to take me to your place,
dressed as a woman.

59
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,471
You'll get jumped like a bitch.

60
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,554
- Tell me, "Yes, master."
- Yes, master.

61
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,473
You like them!
You like cocks, hey?

62
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,313
Here, move on your side.

63
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,034
We have to stop.

64
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,635
I can't keep going.

65
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,836
I can't. I can't come.

66
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,117
I came differently.
I take too many pills.

67
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,350
I think we know each other too well.

68
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,670
Next time I'll bring two friends.

69
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,192
I don't think I'd dare.

70
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,391
I talked to them, they agreed.

71
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,477
They're safe, you can trust me.

72
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,755
We'll see.

73
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,793
Want an orange juice?

74
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,638
Not too cold.

75
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,312
I want to go to that place.

76
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,755
With my moustache,
I'd need a veil.

77
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,828
Shave it.

78
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,873
I'd never dare.

79
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,754
But I can take you,
it's busy Saturdays.

80
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,918
You'll make a splash.

81
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,758
I'll call you Saturday.

82
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,396
Here.

83
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,311
It's barely cool, want ice?

84
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,833
No, that's fine.

85
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,269
- It's great here.
- May as well be.

86
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,074
At my age, apart from money problems,
I'm doing fine.

87
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,910
Know how much they want in taxes?

88
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,475
400,000 francs.

89
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,597
400, 000 in back taxes.
I don't understand.

90
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,628
You spend a lot.

91
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,909
Think so?

92
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,074
Oh, you do!

93
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,231
I don't know how others manage.

94
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,318
And I earn a good living.

95
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,232
It's a vicious circle.
More you earn, more you pay.

96
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,149
I'll have to work back-to-back.
I don't know how you manage.

97
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't work and I own my home.

98
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,038
You don't pay rent.

99
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,031
Mine's 30,000 francs.
It goes fast.

100
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,232
And Maria comes every day.

101
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,868
And the gigolos.

102
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,429
Don't even go there!
I've cut down.

103
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,431
- How much do you pay?
- 100 euros.

104
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,229
That's standard.
And sometimes I give more.

105
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,149
I just found one.
Know how much I pay?

106
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,749
Guess a price.

107
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,388
80 euros?

108
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,709
Lower.

109
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,670
Sixty?

110
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,990
Lower.

111
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,475
Fifty?

112
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,076
Yes.

113
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,715
Introduce me?

114
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,949
Want me to?

115
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,755
- Big cock?
- Like that!

116
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,149
I've stopped doing anything.
I sublimate.

117
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,549
You're lucky.

118
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,315
Over time, I've just got greedier.

119
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,157
We don't share the same past.

120
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,676
Right now, I mostly need affection.

121
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,274
I don't know how you manage
to stay alone.

122
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,750
Up until now it was fine.

123
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,558
But now, I must admit...

124
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,679
I have Serge.

125
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,839
I admire you.

126
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,356
I couldn't. I'd rather be alone.

127
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,714
How do you stand him?

128
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,712
Sometimes I wonder.

129
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,873
But it's my cross to bear.
I'd rather not talk about it.

130
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,792
We'll just argue again.

131
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,233
You're practical, I'm not.
You can cook...

132
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,876
I find it more and more difficult.

133
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,394
I like eating alone at home.
You can't do that.

134
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,755
Sometimes I do.

135
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,399
Can I light that?

136
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,118
Yesterday, after a tough day,

137
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,313
I came home at midnight.

138
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,238
Know what I made?

139
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,037
I had nothing to eat.
I made fromage blanc.

140
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,668
With yoghurt, jam and lots of sugar.

141
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,635
I ate it with an old piece of bread.
It wasn't fun.

142
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,399
You could eat out.

143
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,835
At midnight?

144
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,280
In Paris there are places open.

145
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,510
Where?

146
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,036
You know there are restaurants
open at midnight!

147
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,152
Alone, like a wretch?

148
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,115
You look fine.

149
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,235
Stop it!

150
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,595
You still have your hair.

151
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,637
Yes, I'm lucky.
But I think I've aged.

152
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,069
You look fine.

153
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,959
Even Serge, who's no sweetheart,
says the same.

154
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,713
I'm getting a stomach.

155
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,637
I was eating a sandwich downstairs,
I saw a group of old men.

156
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,478
Our age.

157
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,518
We don't see how we are.

158
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,872
Got anyone new for me?
I get bored of the same.

159
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,836
I'm not sure enough of them.

160
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,913
I do them on site,

161
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,669
in the booths.

162
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,315
That place you took me in Pigalle?

163
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,152
Next to the Sexodrome.

164
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,392
I can't, I'm claustrophobic.

165
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,315
- I couldn't stay.
- You did one.

166
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,396
Quickly.

167
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,355
As far as fantasies go,
it was exciting.

168
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,079
- The young Slavic boys still there?
- Yes, forty euros.

169
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,992
Do you still see Marc?
How much do you pay?

170
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,151
100 euros.

171
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,960
I pay 150. He's pushing it.

172
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,838
He's a funny one.

173
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,231
Wants to take me to Pigalle in drag.

174
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,152
Lucky you! Do it!

175
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,914
I won't dare.

176
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,832
Can I light that?

177
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,837
Still seeing your analyst?

178
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,753
Three times a week.

179
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,354
I keep telling you.

180
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,512
I never know if you're lying to me.

181
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,238
How much does he charge?

182
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,075
- 80 euros.
- That's standard.

183
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,154
- How long is the session?
- 45 minutes.

184
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,796
Mine are 10 minutes.
Sometimes less.

185
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,714
Stops you getting maudlin.
But I have to talk to him.

186
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,238
I started analysis
to treat my claustrophobia.

187
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,909
I go every day and I've seen no
change.

188
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,471
I've been invited to New York
but I can't do the flight.

189
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,389
Leaving Paris is hell
because of the tunnels.

190
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,997
Not to mention elevators!

191
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,830
If there was a big dick at the end,
you'd manage.

192
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,235
Not so sure.

193
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,554
- What are you reading?
- Don't lose my page.

194
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,233
"All My Friends" by Marie Ndiaye.

195
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,675
You should read "The Boys".

196
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,035
It's wonderful.

197
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,668
My great joy is to sit there and
read.

198
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,878
You're lucky to like reading.

199
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,232
It's true, you lack that.

200
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,312
It's my best sleeping pill.

201
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,991
One page and I'm asleep.

202
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,513
Right now, I want nothing.

203
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,476
Nothing?

204
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,113
This will make you laugh.

205
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,430
You'll never guess
what happened to me.

206
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,633
- I got the scare of my life.
- What luck!

207
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,915
I'm not kidding.

208
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,709
I brought a Riot Squad officer home.
Know what he did?

209
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,829
Put his gun to my head.
His service weapon.

210
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,070
No!

211
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,549
Yes. I've never been so scared.

212
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,630
Imagine yourself with a gun
to your head for 15 minutes?

213
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,951
I was terrified, you have no idea!

214
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,356
- Was it loaded?
- Are you kidding?

215
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,158
Those are fears for queens.

216
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,233
Like the fags who dress up
as Nazis for a thrill.

217
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,836
When I want a scare,
I go to the projects. That's real.

218
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,471
Pasolini must have been scared.
Still, it was a beautiful death.

219
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,275
You're nuts.

220
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,629
May I?

221
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,319
What time is it?

222
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,152
Don't worry, I'm going.

223
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,154
My cigarette.

224
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,231
- Where are you going?
- Pigalle.

225
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,995
F or someone who doesn't want anything,
you have willpower!

226
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,312
You seem in great shape.

227
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,714
It irritates me.

228
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,273
A philosopher who talks of stupidity
is always suspect.

229
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,351
Who does he think he is?

230
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,752
As if by talking of imbeciles,
one can exclude oneself.

231
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,630
As if stupidity is the only subject
which doesn't apply to oneself.

232
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,833
How could stupidity be the exception
to the rule it stems from?

233
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,239
Stupidity kills novelty
as surely as routine kills love.

234
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,551
It is disappointed intelligence

235
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,599
which cannot understand life in
depth, and so explains it in extenso.

236
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,075
Stupidity freezes movement,

237
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,037
transforms new ideas
into received ideas,

238
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,715
aphorisms into proverbs,
critica I thinking into sentimentality.

239
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,035
We see it in those who give lessons
but don't act accordingly,

240
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,758
or in fervent hedonists,

241
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,196
whose orgasms serve
to forget they're not happy.

242
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,115
Stupidity reduces the world to
Oneself,

243
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,477
difference to identity,
like a doctrinaire approach.

244
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,553
Stupidity chooses to recognize
instead of meet.

245
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,476
I t is not the enemy of intelligence,
but of disquiet.

246
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,675
Stupidity immunizes
aga inst the suffering of others.

247
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,991
Stupidity doesn't think,
but it's indispensable,

248
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,039
in the same way that men without
courage shout a long with the crowd.

249
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,158
Stupidity allways ha s the last word,

250
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,232
it's allways right.

251
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,955
I ju st...

252
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,231
I shit my self. It's not funny.

253
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,311
I'm depressed, I'm going home.

254
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,750
Damn! A cop, I'll hangup.

255
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,996
Hello, sir.
You know that's illegal?

256
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,911
I just shit myself, officer.

257
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,915
There.

258
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,914
The case is closed.

259
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,399
How much do I owe you?

260
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,469
Nothing.

261
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,233
I want you.

262
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,155
Shit!

263
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,677
I parked faster than expected.

264
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,717
Sorry, Georgoues. I'm early.

265
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,349
The documents.

266
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,830
Com e in. I'm n ot al on e,
I'm with a cli nt you know.

267
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,710
Paul!

268
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,069
My God!

269
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,356
- You haven't changed.
- You, neither.

270
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,475
Yeah, right!

271
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,911
- How long has it been?
- 30 years.

272
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,279
That's a long time.

273
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,714
I've been in and out.

274
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,348
I heard you were out.
Gaston told me.

275
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,508
You know he's dead?

276
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,389
I'm furious no one told me.
I'd have gone to the funeral.

277
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,754
I thought you knew.

278
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,148
I never saw him.

279
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,518
We just talked on the phone.

280
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,354
So, you inherit?

281
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,714
The house in Corsica
and the apartment?

282
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,159
All thanks to you.

283
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,836
You were sleeping with him, not me.
That was 35 years ago.

284
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,996
- When did you get out?
- Two years ago.

285
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,913
This is very nice,
but my wife's waiting.

286
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,351
She's been waiting 40 years!

287
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,231
- What you doing now?
- Nothing.

288
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,229
- Want to go for lunch?
- Let's go.

289
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,589
Come on, boys.

290
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,073
Got the letters?
With my lD, that should do.

291
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,231
Hush, the neighbors!

292
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,391
It's true, you've barely changed.

293
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,235
I work out.

294
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,879
I live near the Bois de Boulogne.
I run every day.

295
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,349
- You, neither.
- Cut the crap!

296
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,552
60 years is huge.

297
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,440
You don't look it. I give you 55.

298
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,715
Yeah, right!

299
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,712
I do nothing, I don't walk.

300
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,595
Haven't taken the subway in 20 years.

301
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,959
- What should we have?
- Oysters and Sancerre?

302
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,073
It's funny to be here, 30 years
later.

303
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,949
Thirty-three.

304
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,149
I was 17
when you introduced me to Gaston.

305
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,835
Seventeen?

306
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,637
You swiped a cheque from him.

307
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,075
I was a minor, no risk.

308
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,551
I often thought of you in jail.

309
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,633
19 years old, what a waste.
The best years of my life.

310
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,318
Still, I got an education.

311
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,358
I took a BA and a Master's.

312
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,909
I read a lot.

313
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,198
Gaston sent me lots of books.

314
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,236
He was very happy you were in jail.

315
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,991
That way you belonged to him.
He knew where you were.

316
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,310
It's all he knew.
Guys who'd done time.

317
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,628
It's one of my fantasies
to go to prison.

318
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,114
I'd have to kill a cop to get
respect.

319
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,271
No lack of fucking.
Georges keeps asking about it.

320
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,194
40 years he's been bored
with his old lady.

321
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,749
Must excite him.

322
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,390
You inherit?

323
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,472
That's why I saw Georges.

324
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,558
- What will you do with the money?
- Switzerland.

325
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,960
Georges has the schemes.
I slipped in 3 million.

326
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,955
You weren't scared?

327
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,909
Gotta be careful.

328
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,392
I hid it in the spare tire.

329
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,832
That direction is easy.
The other way is riskier.

330
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,678
For now, I don't need it.

331
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,114
Georges knows some nuns
who can bring it over.

332
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,476
I live half the time in Brazil.

333
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,155
I have friends there.
I can get money wired to Sao Paulo.

334
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,714
I'm going to buy a house.
You'd be welcome.

335
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,268
Brazil is too noisy.

336
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,668
Teeming with youths.

337
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,149
I have a girl of 17... incredible.

338
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,158
You find anything you want.

339
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,470
Brothels of boys for 100 reals.

340
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,992
You're set for life.

341
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,072
I work a bit in slot machines.

342
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,392
Gives me money for here.

343
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,595
Slot machines?

344
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,749
It's legal.

345
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,157
Inspections to ensure
we're not trafficking, but it's fine.

346
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,231
Brings in 7,000 euros a month.

347
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,792
50,000 francs, that's good.

348
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,911
I might need you.

349
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,318
I'll inherit from Toutoune.

350
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,709
You still see him?

351
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,669
It's been 35 years.

352
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,309
How old is he?

353
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,314
Same as Gaston.

354
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,074
Seventyfive.

355
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,153
Jealous as ever.

356
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,719
Actually, it's funny.

357
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,073
At least he loved me.

358
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,075
How's your daughter?

359
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,913
She's an air hostess.
Haven't seen her much.

360
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,914
As beautiful as you?

361
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,076
Don't know. She favors me.

362
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,468
You were gorgeous.

363
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,994
We never slept together.

364
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,352
I should have gone to jail.

365
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,598
I have to go.

366
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,193
Make yourself comfortable,
I'll be right there.

367
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,876
- Well?
- I'm not doing well.

368
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,275
Well?

369
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,349
I'm alright.

370
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,951
I had lunch with a friend
I hadn't seen in 30 years.

371
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,399
It was nice.

372
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,318
He was the gigolo
of a former John of mine.

373
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,271
He works in slot machines.

374
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,114
Get the type?

375
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,757
He got a BA in jail.

376
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,190
At least prison's good for something.

377
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,273
I should have done time.

378
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,439
I would have read.

379
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,996
Know what my life's big regret will
be?

380
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,878
That I never read the bible.

381
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,672
I swiped Toutoune's.

382
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,195
I read a bit of the New Testament.

383
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,359
I stopped.

384
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,428
It was sublime.
It's a shame I don't read it.

385
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,192
- Yes.
- That's enough!

386
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,757
I proclaim my lack of culture,
but I admit I miss it.

387
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,592
I have to move on.

388
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,829
But to what?

389
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,749
I don't know.

390
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,993
When I met Toutoune,
he wanted me to go back to school.

391
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,430
Apart from cocks, sun and bars,

392
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,678
not much interested me.

393
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,354
Not even money.

394
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,038
Though I was a gigolo.

395
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,917
If you ask him what's happened
in the last 20 years,

396
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,109
he'll tell you Lady Diana died.

397
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,275
AidS and all that doesn't matter.

398
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,670
When I told him I was HIV positive,

399
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,678
he said,
"It's the best gift you could give me."

400
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,749
My doctor...

401
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,438
said I should see Professor...

402
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,753
I don't know his name.

403
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,594
He wants me to start a triple
therapy.

404
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,789
I'm scared.

405
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,680
Perhaps you should listen to him.

406
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,311
I'm scared of the side effects.

407
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,190
I've been coping for 24 years.

408
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,874
But looking like an Auschwitz victim...
I won't deal with it.

409
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,479
There's been progress.

410
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,749
I think there are effective
treatments with few side effects.

411
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,796
You've lived with uncommon energy,

412
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,200
with this Damocles sword
hanging over you.

413
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,592
I think you're very solid.

414
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,359
Perhaps it's time.

415
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,957
If there's no choice, I'll do it.

416
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,789
Go on...

417
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,195
Nothing.

418
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,354
I'm afraid.

419
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,398
I think about suicide.

420
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,358
I can't write.

421
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,514
I doubt.

422
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,197
I doubt our work.

423
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,596
You allude to the cat which
suffocated my brother as the pussy,

424
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,877
my mother's pussy...
Sorry, but I have doubts.

425
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,398
Talk about your childhood.

426
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,871
You never speak of it.

427
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,876
I only remember sad moments.

428
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,871
The gay moments, in the literal
sense, I don't recall.

429
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,995
Oh, yes.

430
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,674
I always wanted
to touch my father's cock.

431
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,799
Go on...
And at the moment?

432
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,269
At the moment...

433
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,035
Nothing.

434
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,439
I don't want anything.

435
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,953
Or yes, to meet someone.

436
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,997
You need to find a young man
in your own circle.

437
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,110
Bourgeois brats with nothing to say.

438
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,189
I met a baker yesterday in physio,
with his son.

439
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,349
Who knows?

440
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,273
There must be gays in your set
who aren't camp.

441
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,759
I don't know them.

442
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,596
And I won't find them in Pigalle!

443
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,031
In the bars, you're old at 40.

444
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,197
Stop going out with old men.

445
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,398
My gigolos aren't old.

446
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,791
It's true that the others
treat me like a child.

447
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,393
I feel fifteen.

448
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,275
We'll stop here for today.

449
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,558
Go out, see young people.

450
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,112
I can't even get up.

451
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,638
I'm just like Toutoune.

452
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,996
- See you Friday?
- Yes.

453
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,994
y sweetheart,

454
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,554
 went to Venice this weekend.

455
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,312
t is the strangest and perhaps
the most beautiful city on earth.

456
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,074
We should go there sometime,
far away from others.

457
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,192
he Biennal opened today,
all the artists were there.

458
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,828
As you can imagine,
the sudden change

459
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,036
and short trip away

460
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,268
"did me good.

461
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,394
l needed something very different
after your departure,

462
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,357
and I'm managing to stay busy.

463
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,196
Are you getting used to the club?

464
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,751
And mostly, do you feel that playing
every evening does you good?

465
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,390
l ask myself a thousand questions
about you,

466
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,351
and I feel like September
is further than the moon.

467
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,757
Yet it's just the beginning.

468
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,108
Almost nine o'clock.

469
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,198
l have to go.

470
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,432
Will you call me tonight
between five and eight?

471
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,954
I wonder.

472
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,950
I'm expected at Marie-Odile's.

473
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,554
Perhaps I'll ask her
to come here instead.

474
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,755
Your number never answers.

475
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,758
Gaston called me.

476
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,832
I'll see him next Sunday.

477
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,514
This surprises, amazes,

478
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,717
"and gives me great pleasure.

479
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,672
"Maybe I'll get a letter from you
this morning

480
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,796
"when I drop by the concierge.

481
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,718
"Your schedule seems sensibly
organized between tennis and yoga,

482
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,518
"pool and beach.

483
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,152
"Are you learning to swim?

484
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,754
"Right now,

485
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,350
"you must look like a mix
between Arab and Sicilian,

486
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,590
"a sort of exiled Don Quixote,

487
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,954
"wandering lost.

488
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,788
"I miss you.

489
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,512
"I stumble upon you
with every step in the apartment.

490
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,030
"And if part of myself is here,

491
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,112
"the rest is in Calabria.

492
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,997
"You find me torn in two.

493
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,630
"My thoughts of you
outnumber the words on this page.

494
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,676
"All my love,

495
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,879
"my little fox cub.

496
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,754
"Toutoune. "

497
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,679
What do you want?
I can't cope!

498
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,714
For six months,
I've shut myself at home.

499
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,598
I can't continue like this.

500
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,119
I'm sick of gigolos.

501
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,319
The other day, I went to Pigalle.
I was so messed up I shit myself.

502
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,233
Change your shrink.

503
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,674
I did.

504
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,996
I've only been going six months.

505
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,159
I can't talk to Toutoune,
we've stopped understanding.

506
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,509
Only his countesses and money worries
interest him anymore.

507
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,559
Since Marguerite Lamy's death,
his only desire

508
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,438
is to take me on vacation.

509
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,590
You know,
Toutoune is a former gigolo.

510
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,475
A society gigolo,
but still a gigolo.

511
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,434
He wanted to do to me
what they did to him.

512
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,395
If I'd listened,
he'd have made me a handbag queen.

513
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,355
He was always against psychoanalysis.

514
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,988
And he says writing doesn't suit me.

515
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,874
Of course! He's losing me.

516
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,429
I haven't seen him in 3 months,
he's miserable. What can I do?

517
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,759
I can't do it anymore.

518
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,516
When I tried to write the other day,

519
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,711
I found one of his letters.

520
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,517
It was so beautiful I wept.

521
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,955
I only saw him a couple of times.

522
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,792
I always found him boring.

523
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,352
I don't know how you manage.
I can't stand old men.

524
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,039
Anything over forty...

525
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,754
I don't see anyone except Catherine.

526
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,431
I've known Toutoune 35 years.

527
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,758
He was always my father,
my mother, my bank.

528
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,833
Like a parent you only want to see
when things are bad.

529
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,274
Above all a bank.

530
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,959
At first, yes.

531
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,508
Not later.

532
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,749
Now we occasionally talk on the
phone. I see no one.

533
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,351
Apart from you, Kiki and David...

534
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,309
and Rapha, who types my manuscripts.

535
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,233
At least you go out a bit.
I don't move from here.

536
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,233
Apart from Serge,
and you know the story, I'm alone.

537
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,554
You have Said,

538
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,950
and the one from Fontainebleau.

539
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,749
Said?

540
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,435
He's dead.

541
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,873
I wanted to adopt him.
You even said I killed him.

542
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,678
I said that?

543
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,834
I don't remember.

544
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,869
Of course not.

545
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,397
As for the one from Fontainebleau,

546
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,949
if you remember,

547
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,040
it was hell.
It lasted three years.

548
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,633
I don't know how you did it.

549
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,439
I saw him once,
he had one of those looks...

550
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,953
At least I wrote.

551
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,073
It cost me a coronary,
a coma and a heart valve,

552
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,434
but I wrote.

553
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,988
Now I'm at a loss.

554
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,038
Toutoune will have to die.

555
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,274
It's terrible!

556
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,039
You'll inherit?

557
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,272
At our age, having money
is the best that can happen.

558
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,353
I don't think about that.

559
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,117
He stopped helping long ago.

560
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,432
Yes, when I was in the hospital
for three months.

561
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,352
He's never been so happy.

562
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,113
I belonged to him.

563
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,032
No one could visit me.

564
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,358
He lost ten years.

565
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,039
My major strength

566
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,513
was daring to leave him.

567
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,279
For an ex-hustler,
to leave a rich guy at 40...

568
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,759
it was brave.

569
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,675
Remember?

570
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,112
It was my biggest depression.

571
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,999
My blood pressure dropped,
I was verging on suicide.

572
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,437
In fact, that's when I started
writing.

573
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,359
I remember.

574
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,312
I found myself alone like an idiot
in my tiny rooms.

575
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,958
120 m2!

576
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,033
And you own it.

577
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,269
I have nothing.

578
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,436
Apart from my work, I own nothing.

579
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,192
You're doing something useful.

580
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:46,238
One thing's for sure...
No one ever bought my way of thinking.

581
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,876
It used to be my positive anxiety
which drove my writing.

582
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,439
Now, I can only admit,

583
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,998
it's a negative anxiety.

584
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,189
And being HIV positive doesn't help.

585
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,830
They want me on triple therapy.

586
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,194
Forget about it.

587
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,193
You'll do like everyone.

588
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,512
There are worse things.

589
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,916
And it's the only way you write.

590
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,556
It's worked so far.
Your little business makes money.

591
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,039
You used it well.

592
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,635
Except suicide,
not much interests me.

593
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,994
Drop the subject.

594
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,276
Why? It's not scary.

595
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,955
- It's part of life.
- Please!

596
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,628
You're like a shrink.

597
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,357
Talk of suicide with a smile,
and you don't believe it.

598
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,991
I've known lots of suicides
who were in top form.

599
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,670
That's true.

600
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,834
I'd rather you left.
I want to rest.

601
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,509
I'm sorry.

602
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,678
You seem in great shape.

603
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,030
Pierre.

604
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,238
You're Pierre?

605
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,795
You don't recognize me?
Richard.

606
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,035
Richard, I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

607
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,873
It's been a long time.
At least ten years.

608
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,349
Yes, at least.
How are you?

609
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,158
Fine. Who are you here for?

610
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,437
- Didier Jayle.
- I just came from him. He's good.

611
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,591
It's my first time.

612
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,351
He's followed me for ten years.
He saved my life.

613
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,869
Got my number?

614
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,309
It hasn't changed?

615
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,955
Mine, neither.

616
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,759
- Let's get in touch?
- Yes.

617
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,111
The total is 300,000 euros.

618
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,429
300,000 euros...

619
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,753
Three times six, eighteen...
180,000 francs.

620
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,513
You talk in francs.

621
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,111
1,968,000.

622
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,352
One hundred ninety-six million.

623
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,389
There's no mistake?

624
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,189
Two life insurance policies, tax
free.

625
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,599
Sign here...

626
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,189
and here.

627
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,955
I'm falling out with all my friends.

628
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,351
I complain all the time.
No one calls me.

629
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,828
Good thing I see my shrink
three times a week.

630
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,197
That's a lot, it's time consuming.

631
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,272
I was almost committed.

632
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,873
I was on antidepressants,
antianxiety meds, antipsychotics...

633
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,354
It was looking bad.

634
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,830
I spent the summer locked at home.

635
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,833
The psychiatrist left me
his cell number just in case.

636
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,598
My shrink is against medication.

637
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,274
Says it stops you thinking,
which is true.

638
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,599
I was a zombie.

639
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,790
Better, but totally elsewhere.

640
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,759
And I was all puffy.

641
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,869
You get analyzed?

642
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,191
My studies played that role.

643
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,915
I had nothing to do but read.

644
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,120
Gaston even said I'd end up a
professor.

645
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,271
But I did go for my daughter.

646
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,355
She saw terrible things as a child.

647
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,516
I was on the run.
We were in a train,

648
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,956
the police came
and pulled me from the compartment.

649
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,953
She hung on to me,
her mom tried to calm her,

650
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,519
they cuffed me...

651
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,439
She was two or three.

652
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,998
Must have been tough on her.

653
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,039
Now she's fine.

654
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,199
We talk openly.
She knows everything about me.

655
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,553
She recently found some papers.
I was headline news.

656
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,709
Headline?

657
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,273
In all the papers.

658
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,432
I was wanted by lnterpol.

659
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,677
It was the run of the century.

660
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,272
I hid at Gaston's.

661
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,237
He wanted me to turn myself in.

662
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,396
The station was just downstairs.

663
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,957
You know, Place St-Sulpice.

664
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,636
There was a public toilet just
across.

665
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,758
I used to go cruising
with Roland Barthes.

666
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,753
The cops let it happen.
At least we were safe.

667
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,750
What did you do?

668
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,356
I didn't budge.
He didn't want me to stay with him.

669
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,992
He said he was going to the police,
and he left.

670
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,230
Weren't you scared?

671
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,669
I was sure he wouldn't go,
that he'd be back.

672
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,113
He thought it through.

673
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,110
He loved you.

674
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,751
Once I had a case full of bills.

675
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,276
He hid it under the bed.
It must have amused him.

676
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,839
He knew your daughter.

677
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,833
He looked after her.
Often saw her with her mom.

678
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,674
He'd take her
to the Jardin du Luxembourg.

679
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,755
And the money?

680
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,594
She has the account number
and password.

681
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,191
I prepared the papers just in case.

682
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,436
- Where does she live?
- The Marais.

683
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,389
She rents?

684
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,192
- You should buy her something.
- I thought about it.

685
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,908
I can't right now.
It has to be official.

686
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,275
Even I rent. 1, 000 euros a month.

687
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,111
Until I sell the house in Corsica.

688
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,316
I'll keep the land, it'll appreciate.

689
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,835
I'll make a golf course
for the tourists.

690
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,880
You know, tourism in Corsica...

691
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,836
The house is shared with Chavagnac.
Know him?

692
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,275
- Unfortunately!
- Gaston adopted him.

693
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,951
He regretted it.
Couldn't disinherit him.

694
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,317
Gaston often spoke of it.
He hadn't met you yet.

695
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,875
The guy was a crook,
I always hated him.

696
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,752
He's a real gigolo!

697
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,357
Only waiting for Gaston's death.

698
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,918
He had a publishing house.

699
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,753
They had that in common.

700
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,670
He had several, they all went under.

701
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,558
One day he refused to sign
some papers I needed.

702
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,909
I went back with two friends.
He signed.

703
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,590
I might need you for the paintings,
to scare the family.

704
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,671
Pierre left me a few paintings.

705
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,479
Some by Michaux,
a 17th century still life,

706
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,598
and a Matisse,
to pay inheritance tax if necessary.

707
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,271
Like a fool, I didn't take them.

708
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,231
Just like the will.
He'd say,

709
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,597
"lf anything happens to me,
the will's there. Take it. "

710
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,990
I saw it, and of course I didn't.

711
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,355
- He didn't give it to a lawyer?
- No. It disappeared.

712
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,673
It's stupid. I had one from 1985.

713
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,270
I tore it up,
thinking I'd find the other.

714
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,160
He left a painting to his niece,
the apartment to charity.

715
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,629
He changed it later
and left me everything.

716
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,916
So I tore it up in paranoia.

717
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,190
I was scared they'd search my house.

718
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,193
I almost put my foot in it
with the police.

719
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,350
I was even suspected of killing him.

720
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,350
They kept me at the station,

721
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,353
told me to remain available...
You know the line.

722
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,598
That's the short version.

723
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,953
Two single men...
I'll spare you the allusions.

724
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,590
I've lost 15 million francs,
not to mention the rest.

725
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,395
Good thing he left me life insurance.

726
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,279
It's like for his grave.

727
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,591
He was supposed to see a lawyer.

728
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,429
He didn't.

729
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,593
We bought it together
in both our names.

730
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,518
I have the papers, it's not enough.

731
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,477
Need the family's authorization.

732
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,517
It happened here, at 1 o'clock.

733
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,150
I was meeting him for lunch.
He never came.

734
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,876
- Where is he?
- In his room.

735
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,312
You can't go up, sir.

736
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,793
Who are you?

737
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,434
His friend.

738
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,999
Can I see some ID?

739
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,433
Did he have any family?

740
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,754
Distant. He never saw them.

741
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,316
I don't even know their names.

742
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,159
He has an address book.

743
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,833
Go and get it.

744
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,356
Let me have that.
I'm in charge of the investigation.

745
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,268
Can I see him?

746
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,752
Do you have keys?

747
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,436
Know anyone who does?

748
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,634
We'll be in touch.
Remain available for questions.

749
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,116
I found him dead by his bed.

750
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,113
All his papers were there.
We can't find them.

751
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,833
So you lose everything.
Who will get it?

752
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,719
His family.
He didn't like them.

753
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,995
You'll laugh at this.
He had a hiding place for his money.

754
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,030
I couldn't find it,
even though he showed me.

755
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,554
I slipped in with a friend, Bruno.

756
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,790
I got the seals removed,

757
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,833
thanks to
the life insurance certificates.

758
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,797
We looked for the will.

759
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,354
It was hot that day.

760
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,114
We were sure no one
would see us go in.

761
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,879
I was terrified.

762
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,914
I had two or three whiskeys first.

763
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,510
- Nothing.
- It's the other one.

764
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,038
We can't stay here.

765
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,795
Come on.

766
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,955
The portrait of the teenager
was here.

767
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,357
Come on.
This isn't the moment.

768
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,512
The will was here.

769
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,436
Let's go, we won't find anything.
Everything was searched.

770
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,153
Bruno! Please, come on.

771
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,998
We could take the figurine.

772
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,839
Everything's been catalogued.
Let's go.

773
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,070
I hurried to the toilets in Chao Bao.

774
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,354
I was shaking.

775
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,397
I couldn't see how many were there.
It was horrible.

776
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,711
I should have listened to Bruno.

777
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,553
Gone the night he died
before they sealed it.

778
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:01,670
Got the will and the paintings,
hid them at the neighbors'.

779
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,230
But the neighbors were scared
and I didn't dare. It makes me sick.

780
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,594
You should have called.

781
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,629
Gaston did it by the rules.
Left everything with a lawyer.

782
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,796
I get it all.

783
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,274
- He left the least possible to Rene.
- Good.

784
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,909
He must be a grandpa.

785
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,719
He has two boys
and a girl Sandrine's age.

786
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,031
I hope I haven't bored you.

787
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,319
And it's not over.

788
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,153
Got somewhere to go?

789
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,117
I might hit a bar.

790
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,719
"ls likely to cause side effects."

791
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,678
Likely, do you hear me?

792
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,913
"Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea,
dizziness,

793
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,958
"pancreatic inflammation,
respiratory troubles,

794
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,839
"kidney failure, hair loss..."

795
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,754
I can't lose my hair!

796
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,590
"Anemia, faintness, skin rashes,

797
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,435
"and liver ailments
which could become life threatening."

798
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,752
Wait, it's not finished.

799
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,310
"Fever, blisters, mouth sores,

800
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,438
"eye inflammation,
swelling in the face,

801
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,955
"severe liver and kidney disorders."

802
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,038
I'll die!

803
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,997
Don't you see? I can't do it!

804
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,998
I know I have to.

805
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,433
I've been coping for 24 years.
Yes, I know.

806
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,433
I'll do it.

807
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,876
Bronchitis after bronchitis,
it can't go on. I know.

808
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,029
But when I read all the side effects,

809
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,555
I'm sorry, but who wants to take
them?

810
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,958
I'll be bald! I won't deal with it.

811
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,433
It's the fashion.
Go on, mock me!

812
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,711
I'd like to see how you'd cope.

813
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,790
I'll take the decision alone, as usual.
Toutoune is gone.

814
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,311
He was thrilled that I was HlV positive,
so this treatment...

815
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,115
I'll just kick off like this.

816
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,392
Not with the face
of an Auschwitz victim.

817
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,510
I'll do it. Of course I will.

818
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,990
Thank you, Rapha. Thanks.

819
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,958
That's right. I...

820
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,598
That's right. Big kiss, Rapha.

821
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,518
Piss me off!

822
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,718
It's 34 C again this afternoon
in the capital,

823
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,757
36C in Bourges,
37C in Toulouse.

824
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,391
The heat is terrible,
and especially hard for those in cities.

825
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,997
The National Health Watch has
announced 40 dea ths due to the hea t wa ve,

826
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,913
and heat-related illnesses are
rising.

827
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,150
Firefighters are on the front line.

828
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,233
We report from a Parisian fire
station.

829
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,077
The firefighters were called in
for a person sick a t home.

830
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,994
For now, that's all they know.

831
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,995
On arrival, they found a 71-year-old ma n
on his bed.

832
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,032
The man was already ill...

833
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,439
and very weak.

834
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,875
He's the typical victim of
heartstroke.

835
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,953
Four people live
in this tiny, ill-ventilated apartment.

836
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,196
It's been hot for several days,

837
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,716
and the firefighters will be busy
over the coming days.

838
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,952
It's so hot in some apartments
it will ta ke several days

839
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,554
before temperatures start to drop.

840
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,870
Strikes have been called in
Palestine

841
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,952
to protest the visit
of Condoleezza Rice.

842
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,596
Demonstrators have filled
the central square in Ramallah,

843
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,797
including many women,
mothers like Radija.

844
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,714
She holds the photos of her four
sons, held prisoner in Israel.

845
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,429
"I'm behind Nasrallah,
leader of the Islamic world! "

846
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,837
These a re the militants
of Islamic jihad.

847
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,232
They pray that God
will let Hezbollah triumph.

848
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:35,233
The demonstrators approached
the Palestinian Authorities HQ.

849
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,311
They were forcibly dispersed
by Palestinian soldiers.

850
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:49,031
The US position has slightly evolved
since the arrival of Condoleezza Rice.

851
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,476
There's talk of a ceasefire in
Lebanon, with conditions.

852
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,791
However, the Israeli position
has not changed.

853
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:01,512
Ehud Olmert says Israel has the
means to wage a long war on Hezbollah.

854
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,717
Beirut's southern suburbs
rema in a Hezbollah stronghold.

855
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,589
Young lookout guys on scooters
oversee everything.

856
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,194
Locals who have not recovered
their belongings

857
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,828
are directed to shelters.

858
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,037
The location of Hezbollah's main
shelter is a secret.

859
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:21,637
This underground hiding place
harbors 1,000 people every night.

860
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,996
"Look, these children don't belong
in this shelter!

861
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,196
"They should be playing outside! "

862
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,078
O thers are even less lucky.

863
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,468
"They bombed everything. "

864
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,437
- "What's left of your store? "
- "Nothin g!

865
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,433
"But Hezbollah didn't bomb,
Israel bombed! "

866
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:41,435
"We don't like to wage war.
But we'll take up guns

867
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,196
"and do all we can
so we don't die. "

868
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,399
In Beirut, Israeli drones
keep watch over the southern suburbs.

869
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,439
This afternoon, eight guided
missiles destroyed several buildings.

870
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,230
The West Bank town of Hebron
is home to about 1 20,000 Palestinians.

871
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,393
In the center, a settlement of 400
Jews is protected by 2,000 soldiers.

872
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,152
Most of the settlers are armed.

873
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,599
One killed several Palestinians here
during prayer in'94.

874
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:15,080
The town is still partia lly occupied
by Israel.

875
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,116
Hebron's residents are known
for their strict observa nce of Islam.

876
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,519
Women a reveiled in the streets.
There is little free space.

877
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,469
"We can't move, we can't do
anything.

878
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,677
"This is how we live. "

879
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,113
The whole world knows the images
of Hebron.

880
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,556
Always the same.
Rocks thrown, shots fired, bombings,

881
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,757
a mbula nces,
the noise of fear and sirens.

882
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,753
People came despite them,
or because of them.

883
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,829
Six egg s.

884
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,030
One slice of ham. Thin, not thick.

885
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,958
Sliced bread.

886
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,389
One packet.

887
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,036
A tu b e of m ayo n n ai se.
I have leftover chicken.

888
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,156
And give me a Dutch cheese.

889
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,069
The red.

890
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,469
And a good bottl e of Burgundy.

891
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,950
Th e b est.
So yo u don't waste your time.

892
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,073
And a time.

893
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,630
Thank you.

894
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,116
That's right. Sixth floor.

895
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,309
Come in.

896
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,751
Sorry, it's my prostate.

897
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,871
Sorry, I thought it was Mustapha.

898
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,915
It's his day off, I'm covering.

899
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,388
This is...

900
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,077
my dad's barbershop.
My brother wanted to burn it all.

901
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,878
- My dad's a barber.
- Where?

902
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,952
- Agadir.
- The Moroccan St-Tropez?

903
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,675
These are antique
eau de cologne bottles.

904
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,115
And this is a sharpener for razors.

905
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,192
And this is Toutoune.

906
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,277
And the barber's seat.

907
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,513
Sit down.

908
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,914
It reminds me of my childhood.
I did this with my classmates.

909
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,715
Come on. The bathroom's this way.

910
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,755
- How much for the groceries?
- 25 euros.

911
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,911
- What's your name?
- Khalid.

912
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,158
Bruno, look.

913
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,754
The Michaux pieces are mine.

914
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,598
That's his watch.

915
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,191
And his father's watch.

916
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,559
Look, Bruno!

917
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,189
Dixie's gold cigarette holder,

918
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,838
from Van Cleef's.

919
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,316
And the Dupont I gave him.

920
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,672
And his cufflinks.

921
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,276
- You've met?
- Of course, Willem.

922
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,839
I came.

923
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,434
I'd like to buy a few souvenirs.

924
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,312
The broken guitar,
he smashed it over my head.

925
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,313
And a few knick knacks.

926
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,876
Remember Marie-Odile de Mezele?

927
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,874
I don't understand.

928
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,397
They're all here, I can't do this.

929
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,993
I'll come with you.

930
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,278
Know what they said to Toutoune
when he met me?

931
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,997
"You can go down a floor,
but not to the basement."

932
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,994
Will you go back in?

933
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,710
I want an estimate
for the portrait of the teenager.

934
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,155
The one that was in the bathroom.

935
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,637
I wanted to buy it from him.

936
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,480
Pierre said it could have been a
David.

937
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,989
Buy it. As a gift from me.

938
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,152
And the little statuettes
that were lying around.

939
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,316
Pierre said the crusaders' wives
would throw them in the Seine

940
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,630
to bring back their husbands alive.

941
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,917
Like casting a spell.

942
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,591
They called them "Plombs de Seine".

943
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:29,712
Like the fountain in Rome,
where you throw in coins to make a wish.

944
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,751
There's a taxi.

945
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,548
I'll let you pay.

946
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,514
Get me a catalogue.

947
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,119
Number 52.

948
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,192
A signed ink on paper by Henri
Michaux.

949
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,830
We'll start bidding at 8,000.
We're at 8,000. 500...

950
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,639
8,500. 9,000... 500.

951
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,874
The bid is 10,000.
11,000. 12,000. We have 13,000.

952
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,872
13,000, that's you. 14,000.

953
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:41,112
Madame? 1 5,000.
We have a bid for 15,000.

954
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,875
16,000. No, 16,000... 17,000.

955
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,550
Madame, you're stopping at 17,000?

956
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,149
No regrets?
Going, going, gone.

957
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,072
Now to number 111.

958
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,436
19th century French school,

959
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,036
the unsigned portrait of a teenager.
Bidding starts at 200.

960
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:19,028
300, 400.
You, Madame, at 400.

961
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,431
500... 1,700. 1,800.

962
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,478
We've got 1,800 in the first row.

963
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,949
1,900.

964
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,069
2,000. Going, going, gone
to the gentleman in the first row.

965
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,592
127, a 17th century still life,

966
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,716
situated in Varangeville,
and signed.

967
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,429
We'll start the bidding at 1 0,000
euros. 12,000. 13, 000.

968
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,830
The bid is at 1 3, 000.
14, 000. 15, 000.

969
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,673
Still the same address?

970
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,829
Same code? A5864?

971
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,512
You'll be home at 6 pm?

972
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,958
Seven euros for delivery.

973
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,236
Gone at 38,000.

974
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,750
If I take stock, it's a lot.

975
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,869
Toutoune's death, the new drugs...

976
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,031
it's a soap opera.

977
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,433
I can't stop thinking
about the loss of the will.

978
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,998
He's dragging you into his grave
with that will.

979
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,828
I told him I needed the money now,
not at seventyfive.

980
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,755
The result is
I've lost 1 5 million francs.

981
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,596
And that phrase he said
three days before his death.

982
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,717
We were in the Parc Monceau.

983
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,758
I told him to stop walking
like a little old man.

984
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,510
He said, "Stop humiliating me!"

985
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,352
I'll never forget it.

986
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,599
It's tough to hear.

987
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,075
You'll write it.

988
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,430
Write it... very funny!

989
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,755
The inheritance is keeping me alive.

990
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:02,992
If I liked fishing or
chasing butterflies, I'd be better off.

991
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,195
If you asked
what would make me happy...

992
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:09,675
Nothing.

993
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,559
Not even getting well.

994
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,355
A young boy
to take everything from you?

995
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,554
I'd like that.

996
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,919
We'll stop for today.

997
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,351
I wouldn't let it happen.

998
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,039
I like being miserable.

999
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,516
When Toutoune died, I was miserable.

1000
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,398
I lived his death.

1001
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,352
I screamed, "Toutoune, Toutoune!"
It was awful.

1002
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,953
I was miserable,
and also very happy.

1003
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,957
I have a friend who keeps calling
to say she's happy.

1004
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,951
How aggressive and selfish.

1005
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,557
I don't believe in happiness.
Especially other people's.

1006
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,076
I hope I won't end up like you.

1007
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,913
I'll shoot myself first.
I don't want to be old.

1008
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,875
Everyone says that.

1009
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,436
At 25, I thought I was old.

1010
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,156
I wouldn't buy a pressure cooker,
I was too sure I'd die.

1011
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,916
When I met Toutoune,

1012
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,079
I was 25.

1013
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,832
I thought, "He's the one."

1014
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,039
I stopped turning tricks.

1015
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,034
I had the illusion
of believing in theater.

1016
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,839
I wanted to be a star.

1017
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,515
I fast learned I wasn't made for it.

1018
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:02,870
You have nothing.

1019
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,838
I'm happy at home.
I read, watch movies...

1020
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,799
I do my clients,
and some lays for myself.

1021
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,236
I like to travel.
You have money and freedom.

1022
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,274
At 60, alone like an idiot...
what good does that do me?

1023
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:21,159
I can't live with anyone.
I have Jimmy.

1024
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:25,279
Jimmy's a billionaire.
No notion of money.

1025
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:28,358
He could leave you a million or ten.
Doesn't see the difference.

1026
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,711
His lawyers deal with all that.

1027
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,835
There's life insurance for me.
Otherwise, nothing's in my name.

1028
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,151
If something happens to him,
you don't exist.

1029
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,919
You couldn't even take
the money you hid there.

1030
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,668
I removed it.

1031
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:47,109
- Open a bank account.
- I can't.

1032
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,675
Call my banker, he'll advise you.

1033
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,031
He could also be a new client.

1034
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,349
I'll do it.

1035
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,716
Have him buy you an apartment.

1036
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,951
I've no sense of ownership.

1037
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,354
I can't do
long-term placements like you.

1038
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,519
Take clients,
sleep with them, eat with them,

1039
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,557
but not share an apartment.

1040
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,036
I never lived with Toutoune.

1041
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:14,033
But I gave a lot.
You have to give to take.

1042
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,270
And I loved him, later.

1043
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,831
Not like he wanted, but I loved him.

1044
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,430
Know what Roland Barthes said
when he introduced me once?

1045
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,314
I was 20.

1046
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,031
He said I was a whore.

1047
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,115
In the semantic sense.

1048
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,995
With no attachments,
no place, no roots.

1049
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,993
I was just that, a whore.

1050
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,559
It's nice.

1051
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,913
But watch out, you're 29.

1052
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,755
It's midnight. Want to hit a club?

1053
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,639
I'd be ridiculous.

1054
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,758
Not at the Depot.
And you'd be with me.

1055
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,793
I'll pay, let's go.

1056
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,916
I can't find my keys.

1057
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,796
David, thank God you're here.

1058
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,592
You're lost without me.

1059
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,190
I watched you cross the street.
You look like such a queen.

1060
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,995
I look like a queen but I'm not,
to the joy of my wife.

1061
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,352
One doesn't stop the other.

1062
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,268
Thanks for my keys.

1063
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,358
I'm losing my head.

1064
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,314
What will you drink?

1065
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,111
At this hour... same as you.

1066
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:14,518
Excuse me... two whiskeys.

1067
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,678
How are Kiki and Laetitia?

1068
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,199
Laetitia is sleeping.

1069
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,912
I didn't wake her?

1070
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,831
I'll give the keys back.

1071
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,274
It doesn't matter.

1072
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:33,950
Not to you. To me, it does.

1073
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,952
Think I'm losing my hair?

1074
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,670
Here... isn't it lighter?

1075
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,234
I don't think so.

1076
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,793
And my cheeks?

1077
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,114
They're not swollen?

1078
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,834
I don't see it.

1079
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,674
My eyelids?

1080
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,750
You haven't changed since the funeral.
You look fine.

1081
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,749
It's the pills. For now.

1082
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,712
Still seeing your shrink?

1083
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,712
I stopped, I told you.

1084
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,349
Why?

1085
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,875
Got sick of rehashing the same stuff.

1086
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,875
He never spoke.

1087
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,228
And it's expensive.

1088
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,076
Health Care reimbursed you.

1089
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,913
I had to pay up front.

1090
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,912
How are the piano lessons?

1091
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,519
I have 26 students.

1092
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,355
And you got reimbursed
by Health Care?

1093
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:52,879
When you have a difficult
relationship with money, I find that weird.

1094
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,432
You keep saying that.

1095
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,273
You still see yours?

1096
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,715
He's the only person I can complain
to.

1097
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:03,839
Toutoune is gone.

1098
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,272
I need a young boy.
Clever, flirtatious, lively...

1099
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,034
Like you 40 years ago.

1100
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,873
And I'm Toutoune. That's life.

1101
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,232
I have to get used to it.

1102
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,439
It's right there.

1103
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,993
Two, please.

1104
