<i>Hello?</i>

3
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:06,146
<i>Hello?</i>

4
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:13,111
<i>Bastard!</i>

5
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:30,030
Hello?

6
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:34,602
Hello?

7
00:02:36,938 --> 00:02:39,270
Jerry, is that you?

8
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:45,138
Jerry, it's you, isn't it?

9
00:02:46,548 --> 00:02:48,140
Oh, you son of a bitch.

10
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:26,743
Jerry? Fuck you.

11
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,296
Where are you? Did you get out?

12
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,364
You know what, if you're gonna call me,
you might as well say something.

13
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:55,966
'Cause all you do this way is freak me out.

14
00:04:57,245 --> 00:05:00,510
You know what? I don't need this shit.
You fucking hard-leg.

15
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,918
I can call the cops, you know.

16
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,716
Oh, they trace it to you,
you're busted back direct, you know?

17
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,256
I got a gun.

18
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:01,165
Excuse me.

19
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,980
Four Coors and a Jack.

20
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,145
Damn, you're jumpy.

21
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:56,655
Four shots of Wild Turkey. Make it snappy!

22
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,783
- You still coming over tonight?
- Of course I am.

23
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:02,158
- There's a party at Caldwell's after.
- I'm not going to no party.

24
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:05,562
- Suit yourself.
- I wish you'd come over more.

25
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,135
Are you forgetting about
my significant trouble at home?

26
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:11,694
- Bring her.
- She's too touchy about the custody.

27
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:14,274
- Yeah, how's that going?
- Back to court a week from Friday.

28
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,276
But I don't think the state's too hot

29
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:18,903
on reuniting children with their beautiful,
lesbian mothers.

30
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:21,311
Probably could've picked a place other
than Oklahoma to be a homo.

31
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,681
Like we picked this place? She's not going
anywhere unless that baby boy is here.

32
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:28,984
I like Lavoice. She's a character.
I knew more characters a few years back.

33
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,081
Like in here, man,
it used to be all great people.

34
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:35,151
- Now it's a bunch of damn career women.
- If you call menopause a career.

35
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,496
When you drop those off,
come to the jukebox.

36
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,797
I want to introduce you to somebody.

37
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:19,171
Be cool, okay?
She's a little touchy with strangers.

38
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:22,101
Oh, I understand.

39
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,452
- You think he's good-looking?
- Ted Bundy was good-looking.

40
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:41,993
Oh, look at you.

41
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:45,190
- Come to the party with us.
- Ah, I'm too fucked up.

42
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:50,564
Look at you. You're such a horn-dog.

43
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:10,888
- What the fuck is he doing here?
- He's going to the party with me.

44
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:12,983
What kind of shit's he into?

45
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:16,130
Dude, he's all right. He's just quiet.

46
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:18,791
Well, I don't know him.
What if he's an ax murderer or...

47
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,959
No, he's harmless. He's just hanging out.

48
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:24,232
Don't bring people by here, R.C.
I don't like it.

49
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:31,570
- He's been calling again.
- What does he want?

50
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,671
Fuck if I know. He don't say nothing.
He just breathes.

51
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,807
How do you know it's him?

52
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,818
Who else would it be?

53
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,945
Oh, then you're not sure.

54
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:42,955
I know it's him.

55
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:45,525
The calls started right after he got out.

56
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:48,187
Hey, you gotta be careful.
This guy's dangerous.

57
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:52,062
- I know it.
- I can't believe they let him out.

58
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,361
I thought he'd kill somebody in there
and they'd throw away the key.

59
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:56,403
Were you gonna give somebody else
a chance in there?

60
00:10:56,504 --> 00:11:00,031
- I've never been so lucky.
- If he comes by, you can't let him in.

61
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:03,167
- If he don't come by?
- I'm not an ax murderer.

62
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:05,746
Do you know it's been two years?

63
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:07,610
Maybe you should
get bars on your windows.

64
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:10,275
Oh, great.
Maybe you can just throw peanuts at me

65
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:13,320
to catch in my mouth, like...

66
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:16,618
- You can get an attack dog.
- I can take care of myself.

67
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,215
- He's not gonna be satisfied...
- I'm not an ax murderer.

68
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,386
- Maybe I do need a dog. What'd you say?
- Can I use the phone?

69
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:22,463
Sure.

70
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:27,365
- I'm not an ax murderer.
- I didn't really think you were.

71
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,368
- Oh, okay.
- Is Lavoice there?

72
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,563
- Here you go.
- Oh, no, no, no.

73
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:34,267
A big dyke named Lavoice, all right?

74
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,373
- You're very beautiful.
- Huh?

75
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:42,346
I said you're very beautiful.

76
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:48,287
- Thank you.
- He said what? Speak up.

77
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:50,847
Are you all right?

78
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,860
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

79
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:56,897
I just don't take compliments real well.

80
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:59,364
Yeah, yeah, look. Yeah, I'm out of here.

81
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,995
I gotta go. Some guy grabbed Lavoice
or squeezed something,

82
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:05,504
and she slapped him,
so he threatened her or some shit.

83
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,633
- I hate to eat and run. Saddle up.
- Oh, I've changed my mind.

84
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,677
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'll just go from here.

85
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,871
- Will you call me?
- I will see you at work.

86
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,176
- No, call me.
- All right.

87
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:17,080
- Promise?
- Yes.

88
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:19,346
And we'll do something this week.

89
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:24,086
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

90
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,797
The best thing you can do,
I think, is just relax

91
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:31,489
and try to get him to have a drink.

92
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:35,433
And if you get really, really nervous,
you can just come to the party, right?

93
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:36,901
I'm not coming to that party.

94
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:39,166
You're gonna be, like,
kicking some guy's ass.

95
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:42,765
- There'll be blood and stuff.
- I'm not gonna kick anybody's ass.

96
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,339
- Have fun.
- See you later.

97
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,933
- You want one last drink?
- I guess I'll go.

98
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:09,060
Yeah, I should go to bed.

99
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:14,708
You've known each other a while?

100
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,743
A few years, I guess.

101
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:18,903
I just met her tonight.

102
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:27,816
Are you sure you don't want a drink?
People who don't drink make me nervous.

103
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:31,585
Well, I make people nervous anyway.

104
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:35,254
- Why is that?
- 'Cause I pick up on things, I think.

105
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,831
That makes people uncomfortable.

106
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:41,129
- "Pick up on things"?
- Things not apparent.

107
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:45,770
That's a talent.

108
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,104
What do you pick up on from me?

109
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,812
You're lonely. I know that much.

110
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,875
That hardly makes you Jeane Dixon.

111
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,884
Who's Jeane Dixon?

112
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:00,681
That woman.

113
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:02,722
You know.

114
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:08,091
That psychic. That woman who said to
Teddy Kennedy that Jack'd get shot.

115
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:17,330
- I'd like to see you again.
- How do you mean?

116
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:20,407
I mean, see you again, what I said.

117
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:25,941
- I don't know.
- Okay.

118
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,379
I don't party like this every night,
so don't be thinking...

119
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:31,452
- No, I just wanted to see you.
- Why?

120
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:35,511
Why do people like to see each other?
I mean, I don't want anything weird.

121
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:42,219
A man's the last thing I need.

122
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,457
I don't want to go to bed with you.

123
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:47,932
Well, don't butter me up or nothing.

124
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:50,970
Well, I'm not good for much anyway.

125
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:54,337
- How do you mean?
- Women aren't really my bag.

126
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,304
You a homo?

127
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:00,346
I'm not anything, really. I'm done with that.

128
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:02,848
I'm just looking for a friend.

129
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:07,683
- You a con?
- No, ma'am.

130
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:10,952
Hell, don't call me "ma'am."
Makes me feel like your mom.

131
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:13,959
- You're not old enough to be my mother.
- Good.

132
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:16,256
She's dead, anyway.

133
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:18,093
Sorry.

134
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:20,531
She's been dead a long time.

135
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:25,696
You don't sound like
you're from Oklahoma.

136
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:27,900
I'm from Beaver.

137
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:31,137
Well, we're all from beaver, ain't we?

138
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:34,180
- Pardon?
- Skip it.

139
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:38,443
It's up in the Panhandle.

140
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:40,453
My dad's a preacher up there.

141
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:43,786
- Yeah? What kind of church?
- Doesn't have a church.

142
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:46,519
Well, where does he meet his people?

143
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,891
He doesn't have any, really.

144
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:16,256
First day I moved in here, I meant to
take that piece of shit down, and...

145
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,689
I kind of got to where I like it.

146
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:20,761
There's stuff in it.

147
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:23,353
- "Stuff"?
- Hidden stuff.

148
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:25,694
You mean, like a...

149
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:30,827
What do you mean?

150
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:33,771
People and things,

151
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:37,276
if you really look at it.

152
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:40,142
You gotta look at it hard enough,
you'll see it.

153
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,850
That's weird.

154
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:45,919
Did you hear that?

155
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:49,483
No, I don't hear nothing.

156
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,057
Listen.

157
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,385
You're hearing things.

158
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:02,301
"Helskatoot."

159
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:05,770
- What is that? Is that...
- Goddamn cricket.

160
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:10,110
Can you tell where it's coming from?

161
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,941
- Sounds like it's...
- It's over here, right?

162
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,072
No.

163
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:17,776
If you find it, don't kill it. It's bad luck.

164
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:21,216
Why is that, do you think?

165
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:25,088
I don't know. Some smart-ass cricket
probably made it up.

166
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:28,892
- It's in the bathroom.
- Really?

167
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:31,829
Yeah. I bet it's...

168
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,405
- It's out here.
- Where?

169
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:47,208
I don't know. Up there.

170
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:52,210
It's the smoke alarm.
Battery's probably dead.

171
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,125
Can you get it?

172
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:04,757
- Nope.
- Well, kill the son of a bitch.

173
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:07,299
Not bad luck to kill a smoke alarm.

174
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,892
I need something.

175
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,403
Here you go.

176
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:28,018
- Success.
- Success.

177
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:33,523
- You should get rid of that.
- How come?

178
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:38,291
They're dangerous.
They have Americium-241 in them.

179
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:40,333
- What's that?
- It's an element.

180
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:43,164
A radioactive element.

181
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,137
- No shit?
- More radioactive than plutonium.

182
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:51,572
Jesus. No wonder
I feel so lousy all the time.

183
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,844
Yep. Here.

184
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:57,383
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'll just...

185
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,115
Okay, then. I should go.

186
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,385
Where do you live?

187
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,787
I'm kind of between addresses right now.

188
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,325
- Does that mean you don't got a place?
- No, I got a place to stay.

189
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,486
Where?

190
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,928
Nowhere. Just where I stay.

191
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:24,126
If you want, you could stay here tonight,
sleep on the couch.

192
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:26,001
I don't want to put you out.

193
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:29,873
Somebody sleeping on the couch
when I'm sleeping's not putting me out.

194
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:35,243
Okay. That'd be nice.

195
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:36,873
It's just a crappy sofa.

196
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:39,179
Nice of you.

197
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,007
What's the matter?

198
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:09,582
Tooth.

199
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,048
- I've got aspirin.
- I'm okay.

200
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,683
Do you mind if I sleep on the floor?

201
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:49,489
Suit yourself.

202
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:25,978
Thanks for making coffee.

203
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,683
You're welcome.

204
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:43,263
How do you stand that little shower?
I could barely get under it.

205
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:53,276
I ain't mad you didn't come down
to Stringtown to meet me when I got out,

206
00:23:54,782 --> 00:23:57,615
but you might at least
been ready for me back here.

207
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,488
- It don't look like you knew I was here.
- I didn't.

208
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:04,557
- You didn't get my letter?
- No.

209
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:11,497
You look good. Have you lost weight?

210
00:24:11,598 --> 00:24:13,862
- Not really.
- Yeah, you did.

211
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:19,531
You got anything sweet around here?
Oreos or something?

212
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,076
I got a sweet tooth, you know?

213
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:26,044
Oreos? Graham cracker, maybe?

214
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:29,115
I was gonna get you some flowers.

215
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,812
Jerry, get out.

216
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,548
Oh, I just got here.

217
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,355
I got some business to clear up
down in Healdton.

218
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:44,454
It's gonna take me a week or two.
Then I'll be back up.

219
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:45,691
I ain't got a whole lot of shit,

220
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,599
so you don't have to go
rearranging the furniture or anything.

221
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:55,937
You ain't seen Mickey, have you?
I hear he's looking for me.

222
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:58,603
- He get his parole, too?
- He did this time.

223
00:24:58,712 --> 00:25:01,146
He's an egg-sucking son of a bitch.

224
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:04,240
- He might show up here.
- No, he won't.

225
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:07,184
Yeah, I know you two have always
been a little sweet on each other.

226
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:09,551
Now, don't think I didn't notice that.

227
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:13,114
'Cause I did, I saw it...
Little looks, you know, touches.

228
00:25:14,194 --> 00:25:16,162
Is that why you ratted him out?

229
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:20,062
Yeah.

230
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,834
It is so fucking dark in here, isn't it?

231
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:43,416
Still snorting this shit?

232
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:45,492
Apparently.

233
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:48,895
No wonder you got so goddamn skinny.

234
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:52,591
I didn't get skinnier. You just got fatter.

235
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:56,136
Ah, you crack me up.

236
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:59,867
- You still working at that honky-tonk?
- You know I am.

237
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:02,203
Still running with that little queer gal?

238
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:04,800
- Her name's R.C.
- R.C., yeah.

239
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:08,575
R.C. You ain't gone queer on me now,
are you?

240
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:11,617
- You better believe it.
- 'Cause you...

241
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:14,482
You know what'd happen if I...
If I really thought that.

242
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:16,249
Don't you threaten me.

243
00:26:16,356 --> 00:26:18,551
I'd get another court order
if I thought it'd do any good.

244
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,095
- Oh, you shouldn't have done that.
- You knocked my door down.

245
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:25,597
- You wouldn't open it.
- I don't have to.

246
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:30,929
I ain't interested in this history, Aggie.

247
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:33,472
I got bigger fish to fry.

248
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:35,633
You tried to kill me.

249
00:26:35,742 --> 00:26:39,803
That was a rough one, yeah.
I was bad to drink back then.

250
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:42,473
Oh, back before you found God?

251
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:47,120
- Who was that boy here last night?
- You been watching my place?

252
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:50,884
- I saw him leave.
- Calling me eight times a day.

253
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:53,721
- I haven't called you once.
- Right.

254
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:57,359
- Who was he?
- Nobody.

255
00:26:57,464 --> 00:27:02,128
"Nobody." Just "nobody"
leaving at 10:00 in the morning?

256
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:05,034
- Must've spent the night.
- "Must've spent the night."

257
00:27:05,138 --> 00:27:08,403
- Did I do something wrong?
- Oh, I don't know. Did you?

258
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,471
- You're ridiculous.
- Huh? Did you do something wrong?

259
00:27:14,982 --> 00:27:17,416
Goss, don't do this.

260
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:20,009
- I ain't doing nothing.
- I just don't wanna go back over...

261
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,417
I ain't going back over nothing!

262
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:26,289
I'm starting to get the feeling that
maybe you ain't too happy to see me, girl.

263
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:30,292
I missed you.

264
00:27:30,397 --> 00:27:32,695
Didn't you miss me?

265
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,199
I can't say I did. No.

266
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:38,765
That hurts.

267
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:43,474
- I waited two years for this.
- Don't give me that.

268
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:44,544
No, it's the God's honest truth.

269
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:48,342
I've been waiting two years for this shit.
For you.

270
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:54,047
You ain't getting shy on me, are ya?
We're gonna have to get over that.

271
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:58,215
You know what, Goss? I can't tell
if you're fucking serious with this shit!

272
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:00,190
I hate you!

273
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:05,493
Oh, God, I wish to Christ I had just taken
Lloyd and gone out to San Diego like...

274
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:10,503
I was really looking forward to seeing you!

275
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:13,801
But you know not to mention
his fucking name around me.

276
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,969
I ain't the one who lost him!

277
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:21,479
Now, whose fucking fault
is it you got slapped, huh?

278
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,642
- Mine.
- That's fucking right, it's your fault.

279
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:30,585
Now, you got some time

280
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,750
to get your ducks in a line
before I come back here.

281
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:35,828
Maybe by the next time I come home,

282
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,261
you'll be a little bit nicer to me,
you hear me?

283
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,128
Huh?

284
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:42,724
We can have a civilized conversation.

285
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:46,428
- You hear me talking to you?
- Yeah.

286
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:08,955
- Hidy.
- Hello.

287
00:29:10,864 --> 00:29:12,695
Come on in.

288
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:17,202
- Jerry Goss.
- Hi.

289
00:29:17,304 --> 00:29:19,169
Hi.

290
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:20,967
Didn't catch the name.

291
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:22,974
Peter.

292
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:24,566
"Peter"?

293
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:26,703
Just plain old "Peter"?

294
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:30,374
- Goss...
- Peter Evans.

295
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:34,079
"Peter Evans." Okay.

296
00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:38,716
Where's your purse, Aggie?

297
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,554
It's under the bed.

298
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,520
I love you so much.

299
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:18,427
I'll see you real soon.

300
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:27,440
Peter Piper.

301
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:31,306
Excuse me, Pete.

302
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:51,794
Oh, what a punch.

303
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:54,366
Are you okay?

304
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:57,198
Fuck, he's a big, old boy.

305
00:30:57,304 --> 00:31:00,432
Do you need anything?
Let me get you a rag.

306
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,008
Maybe a couple of those aspirin.

307
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:14,983
Can I... Can I have a couple for my tooth?

308
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,330
Thanks for helping me.

309
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:27,627
I didn't really do anything.

310
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:30,860
Where'd you go?

311
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:33,764
I woke up, and I thought...

312
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:37,066
I went to get us some food.

313
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:39,873
I hope you don't mind I took the key.

314
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,244
No, that's all right.

315
00:31:44,117 --> 00:31:46,608
Who was that guy?

316
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:50,485
My ex. He's a nut.

317
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,593
Would you maybe make me
a vodka and coke?

318
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:56,855
I don't have to work tonight.

319
00:32:05,205 --> 00:32:07,173
How long were you married?

320
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:12,039
Long enough to still get scared at night.

321
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:14,613
- Do you have any kids?
- No.

322
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:40,065
I don't like that guy.

323
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:42,232
I don't like that he hit you.

324
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:46,075
I can't say I'm wild about it myself.

325
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:50,482
He said he's coming back here.

326
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:52,484
Eventually.

327
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:54,554
Maybe you need some kind of security.

328
00:32:54,654 --> 00:32:57,384
I can take care of myself.

329
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,981
Why do you get scared at night?

330
00:33:00,093 --> 00:33:04,325
- I was just kidding.
- You should be scared.

331
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:06,558
How come?

332
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:10,033
People can do things to you,
things you don't even know about.

333
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:12,604
Like what?

334
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:16,301
They try to control you.
They try to force you to act a certain way.

335
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:18,570
They can drive you crazy, too.

336
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,584
I shouldn't talk about it.
I don't know if it's safe or not.

337
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:35,561
- I think we're pretty safe here.
- No.

338
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:38,426
Not really. You're never really safe.

339
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:42,925
One time, maybe, a long time ago,
people were safe,

340
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:45,129
but that's all over.

341
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:47,365
Not anymore, not on this planet.

342
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:50,102
We'll never really be safe again.

343
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,874
We can't be, not with all the technology,
the chemicals, the information.

344
00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:58,984
Well, I don't like to think about that.

345
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,653
Sometimes, though,
when you're lying in bed at night,

346
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:07,355
you can feel it...

347
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:12,094
All the machines,
people working their machines,

348
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:14,393
the works, humming.

349
00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:19,560
I don't like to go on about it,
'cause it freaks people out.

350
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:22,836
I wish I didn't think about it either,
but they don't let you forget.

351
00:34:22,943 --> 00:34:25,434
They want you to know they're there.

352
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:27,376
That what's there?

353
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,414
The machines?

354
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,582
Nothing makes them happier
than knowing people are aware

355
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:35,917
the machines are up and running.

356
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,729
That's some pretty wild shit.

357
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,697
Yeah, I know you hate me.

358
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,267
You think I hate you?

359
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,300
- I don't know.
- I don't hate you.

360
00:34:51,404 --> 00:34:52,962
Okay.

361
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:56,706
Why do you think I hate you?

362
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,074
I don't know.

363
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:02,774
I wouldn't let you stay here if I hated you.

364
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:06,010
Yeah, I guess that's right, unless...

365
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,349
Yeah, I guess that's right.

366
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:11,957
- Well, we're friends.
- We are?

367
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:16,893
I don't have a lot of friends,
but the ones I have, I'm real good to.

368
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:18,965
But you don't trust me.

369
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:22,025
Why do you say that?

370
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:25,631
You lied to me about having children.

371
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:31,641
How'd you know that?

372
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:34,373
I told you, I pick up on stuff.

373
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:39,779
Well, I didn't lie.

374
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:42,650
I don't have children. I had one.

375
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,352
What happened?

376
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,621
- I lost him.
- He died?

377
00:35:51,064 --> 00:35:52,895
No, he disappeared.

378
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:54,967
Really?

379
00:35:55,068 --> 00:35:58,162
Yeah, in a grocery store, nine...

380
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:02,597
10 years ago now.

381
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:05,303
How old was he?

382
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:06,970
Six.

383
00:36:09,015 --> 00:36:11,415
Do you have any more questions?
'Cause if you do, ask them now.

384
00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:13,679
I don't wanna talk about it again.

385
00:36:15,655 --> 00:36:18,021
What was his name?

386
00:36:20,593 --> 00:36:22,390
Lloyd.

387
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,730
When did you stop looking for him?

388
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:30,667
Couple of years ago.

389
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,103
Except in my sleep.
I still look for him in my sleep.

390
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:36,732
- Do you ever...
- No.

391
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:43,442
I did lie about one thing.

392
00:36:45,685 --> 00:36:49,177
I do get scared at night.

393
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:52,315
If you want, you can...

394
00:36:52,425 --> 00:36:54,620
You can stay here again.

395
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:58,121
Okay.

396
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:03,295
It's kind of nice having
somebody around, you know?

397
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:05,371
Different.

398
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:19,812
I haven't been to bed with a woman
for a long time,

399
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:22,547
but I think I could go to bed with you.

400
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:40,005
Come here, boy.

401
00:39:21,274 --> 00:39:24,175
Motherfucker. Fuck!

402
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:27,405
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
- What's the matter?

403
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:30,004
Fucking bug! A fucking bug bite!

404
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:33,244
- A bug?
- Where are you, little motherfucker?

405
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:36,288
- What kind of bug?
- Look at these bites.

406
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:41,823
Jesus, those look like spider bites.

407
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:43,987
Well, I felt it a second ago.

408
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:46,657
It's like a bedbug or some shit.

409
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:49,394
- Maybe you killed it.
- No, I had it between my fingers,

410
00:39:49,502 --> 00:39:51,470
but it squiggled out.

411
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:57,902
Pull back the sheet and find it.

412
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:08,412
Ah, little fucker!
I was just about to fall asleep.

413
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:10,716
I don't see it.

414
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:12,085
- There.
- What?

415
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:13,852
Right there.

416
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,827
- Where?
- There.

417
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:19,088
- Where?
- There. You see it?

418
00:40:19,198 --> 00:40:21,792
- What?
- Right there.

419
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:25,166
- This?
- No. This. That there.

420
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:27,671
- Well...
- There! Right there, Agnes!

421
00:40:27,774 --> 00:40:29,708
- It's right there!
- Don't get all upset.

422
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:32,471
- But do you see it?
- Well, I don't know.

423
00:40:32,578 --> 00:40:34,705
Right there.

424
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:37,078
It's really small.

425
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:39,344
Well, I guess. What is that?

426
00:40:39,452 --> 00:40:40,885
It's a fucking bug.

427
00:40:40,987 --> 00:40:43,615
No, I know that. What kind of bug?

428
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,453
- Like an aphid.
- An aphid?

429
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,723
An aphid is like a, a...

430
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,693
- A bedbug?
- No.

431
00:40:55,802 --> 00:40:58,066
Well, yeah, kind of. More like a louse.

432
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:01,834
- Louse? Oh, lice.
- Not like head lice. More like plant lice.

433
00:41:01,941 --> 00:41:04,842
- Oh, like a termite.
- No, that's more like a thrip.

434
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:07,378
- "Thrip"?
- Like a termite.

435
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,142
- You mean "tick"?
- No, a tick's like a flea.

436
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:12,479
A thrip's like a termite.

437
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:14,883
- What's a bedbug like?
- A bedbug.

438
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:17,217
No, I mean, what is a bedbug?

439
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:19,314
A bedbug.

440
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:22,087
I thought that was a nickname.

441
00:41:22,195 --> 00:41:24,993
- This is an aphid.
- A plant lice?

442
00:41:25,098 --> 00:41:28,124
- I think so.
- And they bite?

443
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:30,998
This one sure did.

444
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:33,470
Well, maybe it's not really
an orchid or whatever.

445
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:36,371
- Aphid.
- Oh, aphid fucking schmafid.

446
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:40,845
Whatever. Could you just kill it
so I can get some sleep?

447
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:44,041
- Fucker.
- Oh, that showed him.

448
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,345
- Hold on. Get up.
- How come?

449
00:41:46,452 --> 00:41:49,580
- There might be more.
- There's not. We would've seen them.

450
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:52,590
- You almost didn't see that one.
- Well, it was very small.

451
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:55,525
That's my point, Agnes. They're small.
We may not have seen them.

452
00:41:55,628 --> 00:41:58,119
Oh, Jesus!

453
00:41:58,231 --> 00:42:01,689
Look at my wrist. You wanna wake up
in the morning and find this?

454
00:42:03,236 --> 00:42:05,204
It's morning, and now I am awake.

455
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:07,067
Sort of.

456
00:42:08,341 --> 00:42:11,469
- Do they travel in packs or something?
- "Packs"?

457
00:42:11,577 --> 00:42:17,948
Well, if there's one, do you have reason to
suspect there's others with them?

458
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,110
Makes sense.
And you're assuming it's a "him"...

459
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,211
Some rogue aphid on his travels

460
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:27,486
instead of some matriarchal type
with a big brood somewhere.

461
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:30,187
- "Matriarchal"?
- You ever watch "Big Valley"?

462
00:42:30,296 --> 00:42:32,457
- Sure.
- Barbara Stanwyck?

463
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:34,928
Like her.

464
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,234
Where'd you learn to talk like that anyway?

465
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,204
School.

466
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:45,402
- I was home-schooled.
- No shit?

467
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:48,241
My father didn't believe in school.

468
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:52,283
Must've done a pretty good job,
throwing around words like "matriarchal."

469
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:54,910
Well, I learned that from "Big Valley".

470
00:42:56,556 --> 00:42:58,023
This is clean.

471
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:03,454
You got a nice body.

472
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:06,823
So do you.

473
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:09,595
Better looking without clothes on it.

474
00:43:09,702 --> 00:43:12,102
I agree.

475
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:15,333
You know how some people look nice,
and then you see them naked

476
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:17,341
and they're a big disappointment?

477
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:19,070
Yeah.

478
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,043
Why'd you say you weren't
one for the ladies?

479
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:26,448
It's true.

480
00:43:27,653 --> 00:43:29,746
Could've fooled me.

481
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:32,649
You're different.

482
00:43:33,526 --> 00:43:35,494
How am I different?

483
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:39,556
You don't...

484
00:43:39,665 --> 00:43:41,826
You don't speak the codes.

485
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:45,165
How long has it been since
you was with a woman?

486
00:43:45,271 --> 00:43:48,399
I don't know. A few years, I guess.

487
00:43:48,508 --> 00:43:50,271
Must've gotten a bad one.

488
00:43:50,376 --> 00:43:53,607
No. I just decided
it wasn't worth it anymore.

489
00:43:56,182 --> 00:43:59,709
- What wasn't?
- You have a center, right?

490
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:01,844
I mean...

491
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:06,948
A place inside of you that's just you,
that hasn't been spoiled.

492
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:11,553
And I think it's really important to try and
keep that space sacred.

493
00:44:11,664 --> 00:44:13,928
In some sense. On some level.

494
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:16,934
But sex or relationships

495
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:19,197
cloud that space.

496
00:44:19,305 --> 00:44:21,569
Or they cloud me, I guess,

497
00:44:21,674 --> 00:44:23,301
and make it difficult to be just me,

498
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:26,537
and not have to worry about

499
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:28,705
being somebody else.

500
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:34,086
I sound like a big asshole, don't I?

501
00:44:35,688 --> 00:44:37,679
Not at all.

502
00:44:39,225 --> 00:44:41,386
I like hearing you talk.

503
00:44:52,905 --> 00:44:55,567
- Aren't you gonna answer it?
- No.

504
00:44:55,675 --> 00:44:57,575
- Why not?
- It's Goss.

505
00:44:57,677 --> 00:44:59,770
You were Goss once.

506
00:45:02,148 --> 00:45:03,615
Hello?

507
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:07,385
Hello?

508
00:45:12,858 --> 00:45:15,725
- Goss, right?
- I don't think so.

509
00:45:15,828 --> 00:45:17,625
What'd they say?

510
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,698
Just static.

511
00:45:24,303 --> 00:45:26,464
- There you go. See?
- Where?

512
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:28,802
- There.
- I'm sorry. Where?

513
00:45:28,908 --> 00:45:30,535
- Right there.
- Squish him.

514
00:45:30,643 --> 00:45:35,410
There you go again. How do you know
it's not the super-mother aphid,

515
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,175
and she's carrying a million eggs?

516
00:45:37,283 --> 00:45:40,184
Oh! What are plant lice doing in my place?

517
00:45:40,286 --> 00:45:42,777
Biting me, for one thing.

518
00:45:42,888 --> 00:45:45,686
You know what?
I got to get this place sprayed.

519
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:48,123
I'll do it. I'll buy some stuff tomorrow.

520
00:45:48,227 --> 00:45:51,025
Fuck that. It's their room.
They should pay for it.

521
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,658
- But someone would have to come in.
- Goddamn right, they will.

522
00:45:55,768 --> 00:45:57,998
Well, you do what you want, but I wouldn't.

523
00:45:58,104 --> 00:45:59,332
How come?

524
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:04,142
- Never mind.
- No, wait. How come?

525
00:46:04,243 --> 00:46:06,803
No, I shouldn't say anything.
It's your place and I don't want to interfere.

526
00:46:06,912 --> 00:46:10,245
Why wouldn't I want someone in my place?
'Cause you're a con?

527
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,481
Why didn't you just tell me when I asked?

528
00:46:12,585 --> 00:46:17,215
I've never been to prison.
I've just got people after me, that's all.

529
00:46:17,323 --> 00:46:19,757
Oh, you've just got people after you.
Well, who?

530
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,918
- I don't want to drag you into it.
- Drag me into what?

531
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:23,086
Agnes, please.

532
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:24,958
- I'm not comfortable telling you.
- Drag me into what?

533
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:27,555
You don't trust me?

534
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:30,101
- You can trust me. I'm not gonna...
- I trust you. That's not it.

535
00:46:30,202 --> 00:46:33,831
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I'll take my chances.

536
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:36,134
I won't.

537
00:46:36,242 --> 00:46:38,836
So, what, you're going?

538
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:41,504
Where? You don't even got nowhere to go.

539
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:43,275
I'll be fine.

540
00:46:43,382 --> 00:46:46,044
Oh, well, all right, then. Just fuck you!

541
00:46:47,953 --> 00:46:50,444
You know what? You may think it's easy for
me to just take you in here,

542
00:46:50,556 --> 00:46:53,548
but I ain't the kind of woman who
moves from man to man.

543
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:57,425
Fact is, it's been quite a while
since I even had anyone to get close to,

544
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,997
you know what I'm saying?

545
00:46:59,098 --> 00:47:01,191
Not that I need a man.
Oh, I need a man like I need a hole

546
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,860
in the goddamn head, but...

547
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:08,065
I just get lonely sometimes, you know?

548
00:47:08,174 --> 00:47:10,438
It was kind of nice
having somebody around for a change.

549
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:12,511
It was different.

550
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,415
Oh, you son of a bitch!

551
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:04,389
I...

552
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,532
Got in some trouble with the Army.

553
00:48:10,703 --> 00:48:14,969
I was stationed at Sakaka
in the Syrian Desert

554
00:48:15,074 --> 00:48:18,043
during the war, and...

555
00:48:18,144 --> 00:48:19,941
These doctors,

556
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:23,014
they kept coming in
and giving us shots and pills.

557
00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:25,447
A lot of the guys were getting sick

558
00:48:25,551 --> 00:48:30,420
with vomiting, diarrhea,
migraines, black-outs,

559
00:48:30,523 --> 00:48:33,788
and I was having...
I was having some weird thoughts.

560
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:41,524
And I started feeling sick,
so they shipped me home

561
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:44,501
and they put me in this hospital
at Groom Lake

562
00:48:44,603 --> 00:48:48,471
and they started running these...
These tests on me.

563
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:54,539
And they had every kind of doctor
you could imagine just...

564
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:59,074
Just probing and jabbing at me

565
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:01,881
and asking me all these weird questions,

566
00:49:03,122 --> 00:49:05,181
feeding me more pills.

567
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,624
Those fucking doctors were
experimenting on me.

568
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:11,394
I went AWOL.

569
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:14,329
I was a lifer, too.

570
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:16,958
I didn't have anywhere to go.

571
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:18,593
And they don't respond too well

572
00:49:18,704 --> 00:49:20,968
to some drugged-up guinea pig
just taking off.

573
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:22,563
I don't know...

574
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:27,071
That I'm not carrying
a disease or a contagion.

575
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:28,806
Oh, Jesus.

576
00:49:30,082 --> 00:49:31,640
That's how they start.

577
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,878
Typhoid. Legionnaire's disease,
a government screw-up.

578
00:49:34,987 --> 00:49:38,252
AIDS. With the fucking monkeys in Africa.

579
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,552
They're after me.

580
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:45,953
These people don't fuck around, Agnes.

581
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:58,303
I shouldn't have told you that,

582
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,004
but I needed to tell somebody.

583
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:07,118
And I trust you.

584
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:10,120
I know we haven't known
each other very long.

585
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:15,193
I don't want to go.

586
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:26,031
I don't want to go.

587
00:50:36,782 --> 00:50:40,878
Oh, babe, don't leave me. No.

588
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,221
My... Peter.

589
00:53:12,371 --> 00:53:14,805
Can I help you?

590
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:17,171
Hidy.

591
00:53:17,276 --> 00:53:18,573
No.

592
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:20,269
Agnes isn't here.

593
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,548
No shit.

594
00:53:23,649 --> 00:53:26,777
- Where is she, Peter?
- The liquor store, I think.

595
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:34,886
Goddamn, Peter.

596
00:53:34,993 --> 00:53:38,429
I think if I were a roach,
I'd probably take the hint.

597
00:53:44,002 --> 00:53:47,995
- Where's the TV?
- I don't think she has one.

598
00:53:48,107 --> 00:53:50,234
We had one once.

599
00:53:50,342 --> 00:53:52,708
A 19-inch RCA, sure-touch tuning.

600
00:53:54,646 --> 00:53:58,639
I bought it with the money I made
driving a sausage truck.

601
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,948
I drove that truck
20 hours a day sometimes,

602
00:54:03,055 --> 00:54:05,785
just so I could feed my wife and my kid.

603
00:54:05,891 --> 00:54:08,155
You ever do anything like that?

604
00:54:10,028 --> 00:54:12,428
Who the fuck doesn't have a TV?

605
00:54:12,531 --> 00:54:15,091
How are you supposed to know
what's going on in the world, man?

606
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,159
Jesus, we could be invaded
by Martians or some shit, you know?

607
00:54:19,271 --> 00:54:22,297
Fuck, they could be evacuating
the whole goddamn city right now,

608
00:54:22,407 --> 00:54:26,241
and me and you'd be sitting here
with our thumbs up our asses.

609
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:30,843
Could be.

610
00:54:32,718 --> 00:54:34,345
Who got this stuff out?

611
00:54:34,453 --> 00:54:36,512
I did, for the microscope.

612
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:45,597
You little shit.

613
00:54:47,266 --> 00:54:48,426
Well...

614
00:54:49,468 --> 00:54:53,768
You might put it back before Aggie gets
home. She ain't gonna like it very much.

615
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:57,504
What you working on, Peter?

616
00:54:57,609 --> 00:54:59,873
Just looking at something.

617
00:54:59,978 --> 00:55:02,276
Don't touch that, please. I'm...

618
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:06,083
- I'm looking in...
- What are you looking at?

619
00:55:06,185 --> 00:55:09,313
- A bug.
- Excuse me. A bug?

620
00:55:14,326 --> 00:55:16,317
Just a...

621
00:55:16,428 --> 00:55:17,986
Just a bug?

622
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:21,531
In my blood.

623
00:55:21,633 --> 00:55:23,533
Oh, in your blood?

624
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:24,761
Hey...

625
00:55:26,071 --> 00:55:29,131
You know, you remind me of somebody.

626
00:55:30,676 --> 00:55:32,871
You know who you remind me of?

627
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:37,476
- Do you know who you remind me of?
- Who do I remind you of?

628
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,346
- This guy I knew in the pen.
- In the pen?

629
00:55:39,451 --> 00:55:40,884
Yeah.

630
00:55:40,986 --> 00:55:43,420
- I just did a deuce for armed robbery.
- Wow.

631
00:55:43,522 --> 00:55:46,150
Guy named Porterfield.

632
00:55:46,258 --> 00:55:48,556
- You're not related to him, are ya?
- I don't believe so.

633
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,628
- "I don't believe tho."
- No.

634
00:55:50,729 --> 00:55:52,822
You know what we called him?

635
00:55:53,732 --> 00:55:55,632
- Do you know what we called him?
- What did you call him?

636
00:55:55,734 --> 00:55:57,998
We called him Mrs. Porterfield.
You kind of...

637
00:55:58,103 --> 00:56:00,367
Kind of remind me of him a little bit.

638
00:56:04,943 --> 00:56:07,241
What the fuck are we looking at?

639
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:09,141
A bug, in my blood.

640
00:56:10,082 --> 00:56:12,050
- In your blood?
- Yes.

641
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,119
Yeah? Well, I don't see nothing.

642
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,347
- It's very small.
- Yeah, I'll bet it is.

643
00:56:17,456 --> 00:56:20,357
You're pretty much just
jacking off here, aren't you?

644
00:56:22,294 --> 00:56:25,661
Why don't you answer me
when I ask you a question?

645
00:56:25,764 --> 00:56:28,733
I thought that was a rhetorical question.

646
00:56:33,305 --> 00:56:37,765
Do you know what I'd do to you if I ever
found out you were fucking with Agnes?

647
00:56:37,876 --> 00:56:41,368
- Look, I don't know who you are or...
- You don't know who I am?

648
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,141
Didn't we just meet in here
a little while ago?

649
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:44,272
Yes.

650
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:46,749
- And you forgot me that quick?
- No.

651
00:56:46,852 --> 00:56:48,012
Well, I remember who the fuck you are!

652
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,213
Right. My point is that I don't want
any trouble with you.

653
00:56:50,322 --> 00:56:52,415
Yeah, well, my point is,
you ain't gonna get no trouble from me.

654
00:56:52,524 --> 00:56:53,786
I'm staying here for a while.

655
00:56:53,892 --> 00:56:55,792
So find someplace else
to do your experiments.

656
00:56:55,894 --> 00:56:59,830
- I don't think you want to stay here.
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?

657
00:56:59,931 --> 00:57:02,092
- Place is crawling with these things.
- Oh, right.

658
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,192
- With your little bugs.
- We're infested.

659
00:57:05,304 --> 00:57:07,397
I believe you are, Peter.

660
00:57:10,842 --> 00:57:13,709
You let him in here?

661
00:57:13,812 --> 00:57:15,211
He picked the lock.

662
00:57:15,314 --> 00:57:17,612
- Come here, girl.
- Get the fuck out of here, Jerry!

663
00:57:17,716 --> 00:57:21,413
You look good, baby.
Mustache tickles a little bit.

664
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,012
- That's okay.
- Not mine, yours.

665
00:57:25,123 --> 00:57:28,115
- Jerry, you can't stay here.
- Hey, wait a minute.

666
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:30,626
I'm just gonna be here for
a little while, hang my hat.

667
00:57:30,729 --> 00:57:32,594
What was the name of that girl
you used to run with?

668
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:35,792
- Lavoice.
- Lavoice.

669
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:39,166
I been trying to remember that shit.
I been trying to think. She was a trip.

670
00:57:39,271 --> 00:57:40,863
Remember that time over at Mickey's

671
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:43,338
she laid up on the balcony
and took a big old shit?

672
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:47,071
Landed on... Remember that shit?
Landed on a cop car?

673
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:49,170
That was the funniest shit
I've seen in my fucking life.

674
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:51,408
It was the pork party.

675
00:57:51,516 --> 00:57:54,644
Was that the fucking pork party?

676
00:57:54,753 --> 00:57:57,688
It was, wasn't it? Aggie, you got to
remember the pork party, baby.

677
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:00,724
- You know what, Jerry?
- Hey, Mickey had this pork...

678
00:58:00,826 --> 00:58:04,922
Like the can of pork, like Spam or some
shit like they give you in the Army?

679
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,396
That drunk son of a bitch starts throwing it
all over the place.

680
00:58:07,499 --> 00:58:10,127
Next thing you know, end of the night,
he's passed out

681
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:14,569
on the fucking floor in the kitchen,
pot on his head, pork dripping all over...

682
00:58:14,673 --> 00:58:16,231
I know, that shit's some funny shit!

683
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:19,674
It's fucking dripping all over his chest,
and he can't get up.

684
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:22,611
He starts doing one of these numbers
'cause the fucking linoleum and shit

685
00:58:22,714 --> 00:58:24,443
is so fucking greasy he can't...

686
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:25,709
- Jerry.
- Wait a minute!

687
00:58:25,817 --> 00:58:26,784
Jerry.

688
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:28,375
- What?
- Get out!

689
00:58:29,888 --> 00:58:31,856
- Are you throwing me out?
- Now.

690
00:58:34,993 --> 00:58:37,621
- Well, I misunderstood.
- Yeah.

691
00:58:39,698 --> 00:58:42,394
You know, I was gonna stay here for
a while, but I guess that's a bad idea,

692
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:46,198
what, with you being infested with
your little fucking bugs and shit.

693
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:51,701
I got to admit, though,

694
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,745
I'm disappointed, Aggie.

695
00:58:55,981 --> 00:58:58,882
And you I owe an apology to.

696
00:58:58,984 --> 00:59:00,849
Here I was all this time
thinking you was some

697
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:03,648
fucking weirdo freeloading,
coke-head son of a bitch.

698
00:59:03,755 --> 00:59:07,691
I had no clue
you were taking such good care of Aggie.

699
00:59:10,562 --> 00:59:13,053
That's important. I appreciate that.

700
00:59:13,365 --> 00:59:14,662
Thank you.

701
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:18,161
I'll be around.

702
00:59:21,907 --> 00:59:24,705
- Can you believe him?
- Come here and look at this.

703
00:59:26,778 --> 00:59:28,609
- You found it?
- You need to look at this now, please.

704
00:59:28,713 --> 00:59:31,045
- Yeah, police department, please.
- What?

705
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,108
- Stop! Ow!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry.

706
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:36,517
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police department.

707
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:38,316
Don't do that, okay? Don't ever do that.

708
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:41,256
Agnes, it's B and E, plain and simple.
He violated his parole.

709
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,589
- You can't fuck around with this guy.
- It's not that easy.

710
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:45,993
- Agnes, please.
- Agnes...

711
00:59:46,097 --> 00:59:47,655
- Can you see it?
- What?

712
00:59:47,766 --> 00:59:49,290
- Do you see the bug?
- Yeah.

713
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:51,164
- Agnes?
- Can you tell what it's doing?

714
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:52,861
- No, it's kind of...
- It's feeding.

715
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:56,338
- Feeding? On what?
- My blood. It's feeding off my blood.

716
00:59:56,441 --> 00:59:58,909
- So you're saying that...
- I'm saying it's feeding off my blood.

717
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:00,944
- It's a parasite.
- Well, we knew that.

718
01:00:01,046 --> 01:00:03,344
No, we knew they were biting.
Bugs bite for different reasons, see.

719
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:06,281
- These are biting for food.
- None of this stuff's working?

720
01:00:06,384 --> 01:00:09,876
No, they're immune to the sprays.
Thought they might be coke bugs.

721
01:00:09,988 --> 01:00:12,320
- Couldn't find any in Agnes' stash.
- "Coke bugs"?

722
01:00:12,424 --> 01:00:15,291
- Bugs you sometimes find in cocaine.
- There are no bugs in cocaine.

723
01:00:15,393 --> 01:00:18,157
The DEA sprays the larva
on the coca plantations

724
01:00:18,263 --> 01:00:20,231
in South America, Central America.

725
01:00:20,332 --> 01:00:22,994
They're genetically engineered
to survive the purification process.

726
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:25,899
If they can't wipe out the drugs,
they want to wipe out the users.

727
01:00:26,004 --> 01:00:27,665
You didn't know about this?
That's hard to believe.

728
01:00:27,772 --> 01:00:28,796
Thanks for telling me.

729
01:00:28,907 --> 01:00:30,932
Well, they don't get to all of us.
You don't have them.

730
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:32,475
I told you, I checked.
Believe me, if you had them...

731
01:00:32,577 --> 01:00:35,205
- You've had them before?
- You ask a lot of questions.

732
01:00:35,313 --> 01:00:38,646
- Maybe we should take this to a lab.
- A lab? What for?

733
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,411
- Well, find out what it is.
- I know what it is.

734
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:42,646
- What is it?
- It's a blood-sucking aphid...

735
01:00:42,754 --> 01:00:45,552
Look, this aphid business, I don't really...

736
01:00:45,657 --> 01:00:48,922
- What's that?
- A burrowing aphid. Dig it out.

737
01:00:49,027 --> 01:00:51,086
- Let me see it. Agnes?
- No!

738
01:00:51,196 --> 01:00:53,664
- Let me see. Where? Where is it?
- Look, it's right there.

739
01:00:53,765 --> 01:00:55,289
- Can you see that?
- I don't see it.

740
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,664
- That little speck under the skin.
- I can't see shit, Agnes.

741
01:00:57,769 --> 01:00:59,669
- Well, it's real itty-bitty!
- Why can't I see it?

742
01:00:59,771 --> 01:01:01,671
- I don't know! Why can we see it?
- Is it under the skin?

743
01:01:01,773 --> 01:01:05,209
Give me that thing. I'll dig it out and show
you. You can see it better. It's...

744
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,039
Place is crawling with them.

745
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:10,239
- When I talked to Carl before...
- Wait a minute! You talked to who?

746
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:13,681
- Carl, the manager of the motel.
- Why? Whose idea...

747
01:01:13,785 --> 01:01:15,810
- Just to tell him we were infested...
- Why did you tell him that?

748
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:17,650
- Why shouldn't she?
- I didn't tell him nothing...

749
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:21,055
Just tell me exactly what you told him.
Exactly.

750
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:24,617
- Just that there was bugs, and it's weird...
- Yeah? It's weird?

751
01:01:24,729 --> 01:01:26,924
- So what are you saying?
- Nobody's seen them but us.

752
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:29,967
- It's just really weird.
- You've already said that, Agnes.

753
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:32,036
- We saw a doctor.
- Oh, Ronnie...

754
01:01:32,137 --> 01:01:34,697
We had to check out the spots.

755
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:39,438
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit, no.

756
01:01:39,544 --> 01:01:43,878
Okay, either you don't grasp the situation,
or you're just fucking me over, okay?

757
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:46,507
No, no.
I didn't say anything to him about you.

758
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:49,246
- What kind of doctor?
- He's a dermatologist.

759
01:01:49,354 --> 01:01:50,582
- What'd he find?
- No bugs.

760
01:01:50,689 --> 01:01:53,214
- You picked them off.
- He said they didn't look like bites.

761
01:01:53,325 --> 01:01:55,589
Would you please not talk
while I address Agnes?

762
01:01:55,694 --> 01:01:59,425
- He gave me something for a rash.
- Let me see it. Now.

763
01:01:59,531 --> 01:02:02,125
It's just a lotion, that's all.

764
01:02:02,233 --> 01:02:03,757
Here.

765
01:02:03,868 --> 01:02:08,271
I'm not dumb. I didn't say anything
about you. I wouldn't do that to you.

766
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,165
They got to you, goddamn it.

767
01:02:11,276 --> 01:02:14,575
- If you're a part of this...
- No! I'm just trying to make sense...

768
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:16,647
Okay, you tell me.
Do we have the bugs or not?

769
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:20,411
- I'm just looking for an explanation!
- Do we have bugs or not?

770
01:02:20,518 --> 01:02:22,110
- I don't know.
- It's not a matter of opinion.

771
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,984
- An organism just is or isn't.
- Right.

772
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,526
So, are there bugs or aren't there?

773
01:02:28,627 --> 01:02:30,595
- Some...
- No, don't give me "some" bugs.

774
01:02:30,695 --> 01:02:32,060
Presence of bugs, absence of bugs.

775
01:02:32,163 --> 01:02:35,257
The sign outside says "vacancies"
or "no vacancies."

776
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:37,858
It doesn't say "possibility of vacancies."

777
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:42,235
Now, do we have bugs or not?

778
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,398
Yeah.

779
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:48,942
- Then your doctor is lying to you.
- Peter, do you have sores like hers?

780
01:02:49,047 --> 01:02:50,878
His are worse.

781
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:54,315
Show her. Show her, Peter.

782
01:02:54,419 --> 01:02:56,683
Show me.

783
01:02:56,788 --> 01:02:59,154
Oh, God. Did you put something on that?

784
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:02,488
Oh, my God. You think an aphid did that?

785
01:03:02,594 --> 01:03:05,529
- I know what did it to me.
- Aphids can't bite.

786
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,155
- You know a lot about aphids?
- No.

787
01:03:08,266 --> 01:03:10,166
- Do you know anything about aphids?
- No.

788
01:03:10,268 --> 01:03:11,394
We do.

789
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:14,598
Ronnie!

790
01:03:15,306 --> 01:03:18,537
Ronnie, you haven't even
told Peter your news yet.

791
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:22,238
They got custody of Lavoice's kid!
Isn't that great?

792
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:24,907
Ronnie's gonna be an aunt
or a mother or whatever.

793
01:03:25,016 --> 01:03:26,916
- That's terrific.
- Listen to me.

794
01:03:27,018 --> 01:03:29,987
There are no bugs.
There are no bugs on this microscope,

795
01:03:30,088 --> 01:03:32,784
there's no bugs on your skin,
in your skin, in this room.

796
01:03:32,891 --> 01:03:34,586
There are no fucking bugs!

797
01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:37,253
- That's odd, actually.
- I was with the doctor, Peter.

798
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:39,296
- Agnes, tell him what he told you.
- No, I don't...

799
01:03:39,397 --> 01:03:41,831
He said her wounds were self-inflicted,
that she did it to herself,

800
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:43,696
just like you, or maybe you did it to her.

801
01:03:43,802 --> 01:03:46,464
- Oh, you think I would do that to her?
- I don't know what your deal is.

802
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:49,039
I don't know who the fuck you are
or what you're about.

803
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,665
But all I know is I regret
bringing you in here.

804
01:03:51,776 --> 01:03:53,300
I can't do nothing about you,

805
01:03:53,411 --> 01:03:56,312
but suggest that you get some serious
fucking medical attention!

806
01:03:56,414 --> 01:04:00,714
But I can do something about my friend,
and by God, I intend to.

807
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:04,380
You even try to stop me and I'll introduce
you to an old friend of yours.

808
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:07,788
- What does that mean?
- Somebody's been asking about you.

809
01:04:07,892 --> 01:04:09,553
- Who?
- Dr. Sweet.

810
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:13,995
Who's Dr. Sweet?
What are you talking about?

811
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:17,432
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Yeah, I do. Groom Lake.

812
01:04:17,535 --> 01:04:19,594
Your friend is gonna turn me in.

813
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:22,298
- Tell me, what...
- He's asking about Peter at the bar.

814
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:23,431
What'd he tell you?

815
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:25,532
Not much. But apparently,
I didn't know you were staying here,

816
01:04:25,643 --> 01:04:27,577
so maybe
I should have asked some more questions.

817
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:29,237
But he's obviously not somebody
you wanna meet

818
01:04:29,347 --> 01:04:31,577
or he would've known where to find you.
Peter.

819
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:35,642
- Quit playing games. Tell him...
- I am not playing, Agnes!

820
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:38,120
You know what? She would never do that.
She would never do that, Peter.

821
01:04:38,223 --> 01:04:40,020
- You try me.
- She wouldn't. No.

822
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,922
- You don't mean it, Ronnie.
- Try me.

823
01:04:42,026 --> 01:04:45,826
I'm stunned that you think

824
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,296
I would try to stop Agnes
from going with you.

825
01:04:48,399 --> 01:04:51,232
I'm only staying here because I was invited.

826
01:04:51,336 --> 01:04:52,928
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.

827
01:04:53,037 --> 01:04:55,631
I wouldn't attempt to keep somebody
where they don't want to be.

828
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:59,733
Agnes is an adult
and she is free to do as she pleases.

829
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:01,471
I thought you'd see it that way.

830
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:04,104
As for Dr. Sweet, tell him what you wish.

831
01:05:04,215 --> 01:05:06,115
I have no doubt he already
knows where I am.

832
01:05:06,217 --> 01:05:09,050
- Right.
- But as for your contention

833
01:05:09,154 --> 01:05:12,248
there are no bugs, I disagree.

834
01:05:12,357 --> 01:05:14,416
You're gonna stay with me for a while.
I want you to pack a bag.

835
01:05:14,526 --> 01:05:17,359
Agnes, look at me.
I want you to pack a bag.

836
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:26,467
Peter! Are they bad?

837
01:05:29,607 --> 01:05:31,074
Get off!

838
01:05:32,243 --> 01:05:33,710
Help!

839
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,838
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing it?

840
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:42,218
Stop it! Stop it!

841
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,311
Stop it! Stop it!

842
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:46,390
Peter! Oh, my God! It's okay! It's okay!

843
01:05:46,491 --> 01:05:50,257
It's okay! Stop!

844
01:05:50,361 --> 01:05:52,226
Oh, my God!

845
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:53,661
It's okay.

846
01:05:53,765 --> 01:05:56,461
It's okay. Oh, my God.

847
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:01,099
Who do you think you are?

848
01:06:01,206 --> 01:06:04,767
You come in here and try to take from me
the one thing in the world I have?

849
01:06:04,876 --> 01:06:07,902
Why can't you just leave me
with one thing?

850
01:06:08,012 --> 01:06:10,207
This is the only thing in the world I have.

851
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:13,079
Why are you trying to take it from me?
Get out of here!

852
01:06:13,184 --> 01:06:15,675
Get out of here and never come back!

853
01:06:23,461 --> 01:06:25,452
Get out of here!

854
01:06:40,845 --> 01:06:43,405
Peter, let's leave.

855
01:06:43,514 --> 01:06:45,675
I can't take it.

856
01:06:45,783 --> 01:06:47,478
We can't. They're watching.

857
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:51,817
But it seems if they knew where you was,
they'd just grab you.

858
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:54,619
They're playing with me.

859
01:06:54,726 --> 01:06:56,694
Maybe we could sneak out.

860
01:06:58,029 --> 01:07:00,361
It's too risky.

861
01:07:00,465 --> 01:07:03,229
I have a sister in San Diego.

862
01:07:03,334 --> 01:07:06,235
She'd take us in till we got on our feet.

863
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:12,539
I was gonna take Lloyd out there,

864
01:07:12,644 --> 01:07:14,976
get away from Goss.

865
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:17,980
She invited us.

866
01:07:18,082 --> 01:07:20,448
But I waited too late.

867
01:07:22,053 --> 01:07:25,250
Who knows?
She probably hates me now, too.

868
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:30,753
I can't believe R.C. did that to me.

869
01:07:30,862 --> 01:07:34,559
I can't imagine what I did
to make her hate me so much.

870
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:38,693
Fuck, I don't believe I didn't see it coming
sooner. Spying little bitch.

871
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:44,230
I don't know why I love you so much.

872
01:07:44,909 --> 01:07:46,809
I don't hardly know you, truth be told,

873
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:51,780
and we ain't even done that much in bed
except that one night and I don't care.

874
01:07:56,054 --> 01:07:58,579
Seems all we ever talk about's bugs.

875
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:04,789
I guess I'd rather talk with you about bugs
than nothing with nobody.

876
01:08:06,764 --> 01:08:10,530
Not that I've got much to say,
unless I talk about misery.

877
01:08:10,635 --> 01:08:13,798
Who wants to hear that? I don't.

878
01:08:15,873 --> 01:08:18,967
I just get so sick of it.

879
01:08:19,077 --> 01:08:21,637
My lousy life.
Laundromats and grocery stores

880
01:08:21,746 --> 01:08:24,738
and dumb marriages and lost kids.

881
01:08:26,551 --> 01:08:29,111
Lloyd, he's the only good time.

882
01:08:33,191 --> 01:08:35,386
That's it.

883
01:08:35,493 --> 01:08:38,018
We're the only ones.
No one else in this motel has bugs.

884
01:08:38,129 --> 01:08:40,029
- Yeah.
- 'Cause they're my bugs.

885
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:43,623
- I brought them here. They come from me.
- You mean in your clothes?

886
01:08:43,735 --> 01:08:45,635
No, my skin.

887
01:08:45,737 --> 01:08:49,764
There's an egg sac under my skin.

888
01:08:49,874 --> 01:08:51,865
- "Egg sac"?
- That's why they didn't grab me.

889
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:54,945
My God.
Where did it come from in the first place?

890
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:58,174
The eggs are under my skin.
They hatch, they need air,

891
01:08:58,282 --> 01:09:02,184
they come out, they need food,
they come back, they eat.

892
01:09:02,286 --> 01:09:06,586
- Well, no. What do you mean?
- Think about it.

893
01:09:07,892 --> 01:09:10,360
No! They wouldn't have done that to you.

894
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:12,793
Who are they gonna do it to, a pig?

895
01:09:12,897 --> 01:09:15,491
They have to try it on a human to see
if it works before they spray Baghdad.

896
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,033
They wouldn't have done that to you.

897
01:09:17,135 --> 01:09:18,568
Oh, right. What was I thinking?

898
01:09:18,669 --> 01:09:21,263
The government wouldn't conduct
experiments on their own people.

899
01:09:21,372 --> 01:09:24,136
Like feeding LSD to enlisted men
at Edgewood Arsenal

900
01:09:24,242 --> 01:09:26,005
or sitting around watching the poor fuckers

901
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:28,635
in Tuskegee die from syphilis.

902
01:09:28,746 --> 01:09:31,840
- Why don't you fucking wake up?
- Where is this egg sac?

903
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:33,416
What are you doing...

904
01:09:33,518 --> 01:09:35,611
Oh, my God, Peter!

905
01:09:37,321 --> 01:09:39,755
Stop it! Stop it!

906
01:09:39,857 --> 01:09:42,451
- The sac's in my tooth.
- Oh, my God! It's not possible!

907
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,822
I had this tooth filled at the base.

908
01:09:43,928 --> 01:09:47,227
The sadistic sons of bitches
put an insect egg sac under the filling.

909
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:49,822
- Maybe what we got is a bug problem...
- They're eating me!

910
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:51,902
I know. I know.

911
01:09:52,003 --> 01:09:54,471
I'm just trying to play the devil's advocate
thing here, okay?

912
01:09:54,572 --> 01:09:56,506
- Okay. Okay.
- Maybe, maybe...

913
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,598
You're looking for a connection
to the Army, so you're...

914
01:09:58,709 --> 01:10:00,973
- Bullshit. Bullshit.
- Hear me out!

915
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:03,570
You have no idea what
these people are capable of.

916
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:07,082
I'm not a child! I know who I am!

917
01:10:07,185 --> 01:10:09,050
At least go to a real dentist!

918
01:10:09,153 --> 01:10:11,280
It's not safe.
I'm being watched too closely, Agnes.

919
01:10:11,389 --> 01:10:12,549
They haven't grabbed me yet

920
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:15,592
because they want to see
how the experiment turns out!

921
01:10:15,693 --> 01:10:18,526
You cannot know that! Peter!

922
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:24,090
Stop it! No! No! No!

923
01:10:30,174 --> 01:10:31,334
Peter!

924
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:45,087
Oh, God!

925
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:46,713
Jesus Christ!

926
01:11:05,076 --> 01:11:07,442
What? What?

927
01:11:07,545 --> 01:11:09,172
What?

928
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:20,017
Millions.

929
01:11:53,991 --> 01:11:56,152
Is this the White residence?

930
01:12:00,164 --> 01:12:03,964
I'm looking for Peter Evans.
I was told I could find him here.

931
01:12:06,504 --> 01:12:09,735
I have it on good authority
that Peter is staying here.

932
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,268
I don't mean any harm.

933
01:12:14,378 --> 01:12:16,846
If I could just talk to Peter...

934
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:29,956
Could I speak with you for a moment?

935
01:12:33,164 --> 01:12:35,997
I assure you
I'm here with the best of intentions.

936
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:41,334
All right. Thank you.

937
01:13:04,929 --> 01:13:06,863
Shut up!

938
01:13:06,964 --> 01:13:09,489
Settle down! Shut up!

939
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,534
You can't... You can't take me!

940
01:13:11,636 --> 01:13:14,104
I'm Phillip Sweet.
All of my credentials are in there.

941
01:13:14,205 --> 01:13:17,106
- As if you couldn't fake that!
- Just listen to the man!

942
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:20,200
- You're in way over your head here.
- Why don't you wait outside?

943
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:22,779
Give us some time alone.

944
01:14:01,552 --> 01:14:03,486
Bug problem?

945
01:14:03,587 --> 01:14:05,145
You should know.

946
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:08,818
- I should? What are they?
- Aphids.

947
01:14:08,926 --> 01:14:10,086
"Aphids"?

948
01:14:10,194 --> 01:14:12,025
Look around, asshole!

949
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:17,029
They're in right now.
They like to go in sometimes.

950
01:14:17,134 --> 01:14:20,331
- And the tin foil?
- Scrambles the signal.

951
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:23,601
- You're receiving a signal?
- Transmitting.

952
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:27,804
- You're transmitting a signal?
- Not me, the bugs.

953
01:14:27,912 --> 01:14:30,176
The bugs have a transmitter?

954
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:32,647
The bugs are the transmitter.

955
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,878
And the tin foil scrambles the signal?

956
01:14:35,986 --> 01:14:37,248
It helps.

957
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:41,115
I'm sure it does.

958
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:56,670
Peter Evans has been incarcerated
in an Army hospital for four years.

959
01:14:56,774 --> 01:14:58,332
I know.

960
01:14:58,442 --> 01:15:02,640
He's been diagnosed as a delusional
paranoid with schizophrenic tendencies,

961
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:06,911
although personally
I'm not a big fan of labels.

962
01:15:07,017 --> 01:15:11,386
His doctors believe he's potentially
dangerous to himself or even others.

963
01:15:11,489 --> 01:15:14,287
Aren't you his doctor?

964
01:15:14,392 --> 01:15:16,587
More of a consultant, really.

965
01:15:16,694 --> 01:15:18,821
He told me about you.

966
01:15:18,929 --> 01:15:22,990
He said you got a kick out of it,
like some Nazi.

967
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,796
- "Got a kick out of it."
- Your experiments.

968
01:15:25,903 --> 01:15:27,393
My experiments.

969
01:15:29,774 --> 01:15:31,969
So now he's being hunted by the Army

970
01:15:32,076 --> 01:15:33,771
and the CIA.

971
01:15:35,846 --> 01:15:39,407
And you think they'd send
a doctor to find him?

972
01:15:39,517 --> 01:15:41,508
I'm here on my own.

973
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:44,383
- 'Cause you care about Peter so much.
- Yes, I do.

974
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:48,484
- Know why he was institutionalized?
- No.

975
01:15:48,592 --> 01:15:52,323
No. You wouldn't.

976
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:55,365
- May I have a drink?
- No, you can't.

977
01:16:14,351 --> 01:16:17,184
- How often do you hit that thing?
- Often as I like.

978
01:16:20,224 --> 01:16:22,920
- May I?
- Suit yourself.

979
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:30,097
- I'd be careful.
- I'm okay.

980
01:16:30,201 --> 01:16:33,329
Yeah, you're also sitting
on 20 gallons of high-test.

981
01:16:40,144 --> 01:16:42,635
I can only imagine what this is for.

982
01:16:43,113 --> 01:16:45,343
I don't see a jet ski in here.

983
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:03,594
Bugs are a fairly common
delusion among paranoids.

984
01:17:05,936 --> 01:17:08,871
Bugs, spiders, snakes.

985
01:17:10,441 --> 01:17:11,635
Spiders.

986
01:17:12,643 --> 01:17:16,010
- You haven't had any snakes, have you?
- You're the first.

987
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:19,449
Have you at least entertained the idea

988
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,711
that the bugs are a delusion?

989
01:17:23,053 --> 01:17:25,544
How do I know you're not a delusion?

990
01:17:25,956 --> 01:17:27,651
Touch.

991
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:44,836
Well, that's no delusion.

992
01:17:46,844 --> 01:17:48,937
Where do the bugs come from?

993
01:17:49,046 --> 01:17:52,277
- Peter.
- And how's that work?

994
01:17:52,383 --> 01:17:53,816
You injected him.

995
01:17:53,918 --> 01:17:56,113
I injected him. Right.

996
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,552
- When did you first see the bugs?
- When they got here.

997
01:17:58,656 --> 01:18:00,681
- He saw them first?
- They're his bugs.

998
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:02,918
Yes, they are.

999
01:18:03,027 --> 01:18:06,929
And when I take him away,
the bugs'll disappear.

1000
01:18:11,468 --> 01:18:13,993
You want the bugs to disappear.

1001
01:18:14,104 --> 01:18:16,004
I can handle it.

1002
01:18:17,274 --> 01:18:18,741
We're...

1003
01:18:18,842 --> 01:18:21,504
- We're winning the fight.
- Really?

1004
01:18:21,612 --> 01:18:22,977
The bugs are

1005
01:18:24,114 --> 01:18:25,103
retreating?

1006
01:18:25,215 --> 01:18:28,651
No, but we can find the egg sacs now

1007
01:18:28,752 --> 01:18:30,549
and cut them out of his body.

1008
01:18:30,654 --> 01:18:33,714
You keep up that cutting,
there might not be much left of Peter.

1009
01:18:33,824 --> 01:18:37,123
- For you or for me.
- I know what I'm doing.

1010
01:18:53,143 --> 01:18:54,906
You're being watched.

1011
01:19:01,318 --> 01:19:03,786
I could talk to them. They'd listen to me.

1012
01:19:10,194 --> 01:19:12,219
Peter comes in out of the cold,

1013
01:19:12,329 --> 01:19:16,766
first thing I'd do, I'll get him in surgery
so they can cut out those eggs.

1014
01:19:18,502 --> 01:19:21,869
- Egg sacs.
- Egg sacs. Simple procedure,

1015
01:19:21,972 --> 01:19:25,339
under the proper conditions,
with a trained medical staff.

1016
01:19:27,878 --> 01:19:30,039
Don't put him back in the hospital.
They'll take him away from me.

1017
01:19:30,147 --> 01:19:33,207
No, they won't. I won't let them.

1018
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,386
You can do that?

1019
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:41,947
I am his doctor. He's my project.

1020
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:44,050
He is?

1021
01:19:45,729 --> 01:19:48,129
I don't want to see him locked up.

1022
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:51,028
I want to help him.

1023
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,004
Well, why would you
stop what you started?

1024
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:02,178
We made a mistake.

1025
01:20:04,214 --> 01:20:06,614
I made a mistake.

1026
01:20:06,717 --> 01:20:08,776
I didn't realize...

1027
01:20:10,654 --> 01:20:13,452
I didn't know what they were using it for.

1028
01:20:14,324 --> 01:20:17,885
What they're doing, it's dangerous.

1029
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:21,921
It's wrong.

1030
01:20:25,569 --> 01:20:27,161
Have him call me.

1031
01:20:34,945 --> 01:20:37,311
Let me take him in.

1032
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:43,586
Because if you leave it in their hands,

1033
01:20:43,687 --> 01:20:46,121
I can't vouch for Peter's chances.

1034
01:20:50,027 --> 01:20:52,427
Why are they doing this?

1035
01:21:01,472 --> 01:21:03,372
It's what they do.

1036
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:11,039
I can't trust you.

1037
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,718
Yes, you can.

1038
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:20,657
I can do something for you. I can help you.

1039
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:23,291
Your son, Lloyd.

1040
01:21:24,695 --> 01:21:26,686
What do you know about Lloyd?

1041
01:21:26,797 --> 01:21:28,560
I can help you find Lloyd.

1042
01:21:28,665 --> 01:21:32,101
- You know about Lloyd? What?
- I shouldn't say anything else.

1043
01:21:32,202 --> 01:21:34,966
No. If you know something about my son,
you have to tell me!

1044
01:21:35,072 --> 01:21:38,667
- They're watching. If I say too much...
- Who?

1045
01:21:38,776 --> 01:21:41,108
Oh, just tell me...

1046
01:21:41,211 --> 01:21:43,406
Is he alive? Is he alive?

1047
01:21:43,514 --> 01:21:45,846
Just... Is he okay?

1048
01:21:52,189 --> 01:21:54,487
Where is he? Tell me where he is.
Just tell me where...

1049
01:21:54,591 --> 01:21:56,456
- Please? Please?
- I have to be discreet.

1050
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,892
If I say too much, they might hurt him.

1051
01:21:58,996 --> 01:22:01,157
- You don't want that, do you?
- Oh, no! No!

1052
01:22:01,265 --> 01:22:03,062
But he's alive? Oh, my...

1053
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:07,365
Help me bring Peter in,
and I'll help you find Lloyd.

1054
01:22:08,505 --> 01:22:11,864
Oh, Peter! Peter, Lloyd's alive!

1055
01:22:11,975 --> 01:22:14,967
- Peter. Good Lord.
- He's alive! He's gonna take you in,

1056
01:22:15,078 --> 01:22:18,377
he's gonna cut out all the little egg sacs,

1057
01:22:18,482 --> 01:22:21,508
and he's gonna help us!

1058
01:22:22,986 --> 01:22:23,953
Peter.

1059
01:22:24,988 --> 01:22:27,422
- Peter, what are you doing?
- What are you?

1060
01:22:29,059 --> 01:22:30,788
- What are you doing?
- You need to come back...

1061
01:22:30,894 --> 01:22:33,294
From the factory. Sound card's good.
What do you run on?

1062
01:22:33,397 --> 01:22:35,422
- You need your meds.
- New model.

1063
01:22:35,532 --> 01:22:38,968
- We need to talk, talk to one another.
- Do you know him?

1064
01:22:40,204 --> 01:22:43,037
- Do you know him?
- He knows me. It's all right.

1065
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,973
Munitions, R and D, nice work.

1066
01:22:46,076 --> 01:22:48,010
- What's happening?
- You believed it.

1067
01:22:48,111 --> 01:22:50,306
No, he'll bring me... He'll bring me Lloyd!

1068
01:22:50,414 --> 01:22:52,177
She's not part of this.

1069
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:55,308
He'll tell you anything
you want to hear, Agnes.

1070
01:22:55,419 --> 01:22:58,047
- This is between you and me.
- That's how it's programmed.

1071
01:22:58,155 --> 01:22:59,588
It's always been you and me.

1072
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:02,784
- I don't understand.
- I'll cut it open. I'll show you.

1073
01:23:03,927 --> 01:23:05,724
Machine!

1074
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:07,929
- Machine!
- Oh, God, Peter!

1075
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:10,397
Machine! Machine!

1076
01:23:13,904 --> 01:23:17,101
He said he was gonna help me find my son!

1077
01:23:28,452 --> 01:23:30,545
Stop it!

1078
01:23:32,322 --> 01:23:35,758
Oh, stop it, Peter! Peter, stop it!

1079
01:23:36,059 --> 01:23:38,391
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Touch it! Here.

1080
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:41,555
Feel it. Okay? This isn't real.

1081
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:42,962
- Real!
- See? It's not real.

1082
01:23:43,066 --> 01:23:44,966
- Real what? I don't...
- No, no, no, no. It's synthetic.

1083
01:23:45,068 --> 01:23:47,832
- It's not even close. See?
- I don't understand.

1084
01:23:47,938 --> 01:23:49,769
- What are you talking about?
- No, no, no.

1085
01:23:49,873 --> 01:23:52,205
- He said he knew where Lloyd was!
- Agnes, Agnes, listen to me.

1086
01:23:52,309 --> 01:23:54,504
It doesn't know where Lloyd is.
It doesn't know anything.

1087
01:23:54,611 --> 01:23:58,172
It only knows what they
program it to say, okay?

1088
01:23:58,282 --> 01:24:00,944
No, shut up!
They can't wait for me to come outside.

1089
01:24:01,051 --> 01:24:03,315
They've come to collect me.
The experiment is over.

1090
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:06,218
They've come to pick up their petri dish,
and they sent a machine to do it.

1091
01:24:06,323 --> 01:24:08,223
Agnes, it is a fucking machine!

1092
01:24:08,325 --> 01:24:10,225
You can see for yourself.
They're sending in machines.

1093
01:24:10,327 --> 01:24:12,090
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Okay? Okay.

1094
01:24:12,195 --> 01:24:14,026
I don't really understand.

1095
01:24:14,131 --> 01:24:16,599
You have to explain to me
what is going on, Peter.

1096
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:20,534
Listen! Listen!
If you want to know what is going on...

1097
01:24:20,637 --> 01:24:22,229
- You have to listen to me!
- I'm listening!

1098
01:24:22,339 --> 01:24:23,738
- You have to!
- I'm listening.

1099
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:28,106
Because you don't know the fucking
enormity of what we're dealing with!

1100
01:24:28,211 --> 01:24:30,179
- I'm listening.
- May the 29th, 1954,

1101
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,875
a consortium of bankers, industrialists,
CEOs and politicians

1102
01:24:33,984 --> 01:24:36,179
held a series of meetings over three days

1103
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:38,811
at the Bilderberg Hotel
in Oosterbeek, Holland.

1104
01:24:38,922 --> 01:24:42,517
They drew up a plan
for maintaining the status quo.

1105
01:24:42,626 --> 01:24:44,093
- What's that?
- It's the way things are.

1106
01:24:44,194 --> 01:24:46,526
It's the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

1107
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,723
They devised a plan to manipulate

1108
01:24:48,832 --> 01:24:51,630
technology, economics, the media,

1109
01:24:51,735 --> 01:24:54,226
population control, world religion,

1110
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:56,568
to keep things the way they are.

1111
01:24:56,673 --> 01:25:00,404
They have continued to meet once a year
every year since the original meeting.

1112
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:05,504
Look it up. Under their orders, the CIA
smuggled Nazi scientists into the States

1113
01:25:05,615 --> 01:25:08,015
to work with the American military
and Calspan,

1114
01:25:08,118 --> 01:25:10,313
developing an inner-epidermal
tracking microchip.

1115
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,513
- A what?
- A surveillance tool, a computer chip

1116
01:25:12,622 --> 01:25:15,591
that has been implanted in the skin
of every human being

1117
01:25:15,692 --> 01:25:19,389
- born on the planet since 1982.
- Oh, my God!

1118
01:25:19,496 --> 01:25:24,331
The test group for the prototype
was the People's Temple.

1119
01:25:24,434 --> 01:25:27,562
And when the Reverend Jim Jones
threatened to expose them,

1120
01:25:27,671 --> 01:25:30,936
he and every member of his church
were assassinated!

1121
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:33,407
But it's not enough just to track people,
to spy on them.

1122
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:34,909
- They want control.
- Yeah.

1123
01:25:35,012 --> 01:25:39,142
So they create the
Intelligence Manned Interface biochip,

1124
01:25:39,249 --> 01:25:41,615
a subcutaneous transponder computer chip

1125
01:25:41,718 --> 01:25:43,413
imprinted with living brain cells.

1126
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,512
They needed lab rats to test it,
and they found us.

1127
01:25:46,623 --> 01:25:49,285
Me, in the Gulf, and another soldier

1128
01:25:49,393 --> 01:25:53,557
working at Calspan at the time,
Tim McVeigh.

1129
01:25:53,663 --> 01:25:56,757
- Oh, wait.
- They turned us into fucking zombies.

1130
01:25:56,867 --> 01:25:58,630
Remote control assassins!

1131
01:25:58,735 --> 01:26:01,226
And then they picked Tim up,
chucked him in a prison factory.

1132
01:26:01,338 --> 01:26:03,602
- But I found my chip and I cut it out.
- Oh, my God!

1133
01:26:03,707 --> 01:26:06,369
So they sent me back to the lab for further
testing and a new experiment.

1134
01:26:06,476 --> 01:26:08,706
- You're John Doe number 2!
- No, no, no, no!

1135
01:26:08,812 --> 01:26:10,541
That's who they want me to be.

1136
01:26:10,647 --> 01:26:13,275
That is the flaw in the IMI biochip.

1137
01:26:13,383 --> 01:26:14,611
They can't get to everybody.

1138
01:26:14,718 --> 01:26:15,946
People slip through the cracks,

1139
01:26:16,053 --> 01:26:19,511
they find the chip, they cut it out,
like me or Ted Kaczynski.

1140
01:26:19,623 --> 01:26:24,424
They need a chip that will self-perpetuate,
that will spread like a virus,

1141
01:26:24,528 --> 01:26:27,588
that people can pass to each other,
to everyone!

1142
01:26:28,665 --> 01:26:30,758
They got it!

1143
01:26:33,103 --> 01:26:35,128
Oh, you mean the bugs. They got the bugs.

1144
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:38,036
- A living, breathing organism.
- Oh, my God!

1145
01:26:38,141 --> 01:26:41,201
The ultimate parasite,
implanted via a queen bug,

1146
01:26:41,311 --> 01:26:43,404
the super-mother, who mates with a drone,

1147
01:26:43,513 --> 01:26:45,674
lays egg sacs in the body of the host,

1148
01:26:45,782 --> 01:26:49,616
and governs a growing army of rapidly
multiplying, brainwashing bugs.

1149
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:52,347
They gave those things to you,
and you gave them to me.

1150
01:26:52,456 --> 01:26:55,084
- You gave those fucking things to me!
- Maybe.

1151
01:26:55,525 --> 01:26:57,891
What? What? Of course you did.

1152
01:26:57,994 --> 01:26:59,552
Agnes!

1153
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:04,464
I don't believe
that my presence here is accidental.

1154
01:27:04,568 --> 01:27:06,798
What?

1155
01:27:06,903 --> 01:27:09,599
Peter, what are you talking about?
What are you saying?

1156
01:27:09,706 --> 01:27:13,073
I couldn't have done that. I didn't...
I didn't do that.

1157
01:27:13,176 --> 01:27:14,973
Unless. Unless... Unless. Unless...

1158
01:27:15,078 --> 01:27:18,536
Unless I, like, know something
that I don't know I know

1159
01:27:18,648 --> 01:27:21,276
or I've got something I don't know I've got!

1160
01:27:21,384 --> 01:27:22,942
- What don't you know?
- What?

1161
01:27:23,053 --> 01:27:25,248
- I don't know. There's a lot.
- What don't you know?

1162
01:27:25,355 --> 01:27:27,220
I don't... I... Jesus!

1163
01:27:27,324 --> 01:27:31,727
- Think, Agnes! What don't you know?
- Lloyd! Lloyd!

1164
01:27:31,828 --> 01:27:34,388
Lloyd.
I don't know what happened to Lloyd.

1165
01:27:34,498 --> 01:27:37,160
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1166
01:27:37,267 --> 01:27:39,428
- You do know. Put it together.
- No. No.

1167
01:27:39,536 --> 01:27:42,004
- The pieces will fit.
- I don't know. They don't fit.

1168
01:27:42,105 --> 01:27:44,630
- You have to look hard enough.
- You don't think I haven't been?

1169
01:27:44,741 --> 01:27:48,438
- They don't fit! I don't know.
- You have to look harder. You have to.

1170
01:27:48,545 --> 01:27:51,013
I don't see it.
What are you trying to get me to see?

1171
01:27:51,114 --> 01:27:53,548
Come on. You'll see it.

1172
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:56,210
- I don't know where to start.
- Start at the beginning!

1173
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:59,880
I took him to the grocery store,
and we were shopping.

1174
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,254
And he was right there in the cart.
And I went back to get an onion

1175
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:04,953
'cause I forgot the onion, and I just...
I just turned away.

1176
01:28:05,061 --> 01:28:08,792
- And then he was just gone!
- No! "He was just gone"? No.

1177
01:28:08,899 --> 01:28:11,299
- He couldn't get out in a few seconds.
- So he couldn't have gotten out.

1178
01:28:11,401 --> 01:28:14,302
No, he didn't get out. He got... He got...
He got... Somebody took him.

1179
01:28:14,404 --> 01:28:17,168
- Somebody took my boy because I was...
- Ah, "Somebody." "Somebody."

1180
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:20,607
Well, no, not anybody, 'cause he was smart.

1181
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:23,372
He wouldn't have talked to strangers.
I told him not to talk to strangers!

1182
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,380
- And he was smart!
- So then it had to be...

1183
01:28:25,482 --> 01:28:27,643
It had to be somebody that he knew!

1184
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:31,517
It had to be somebody he knew,
that he wasn't scared of, like his daddy!

1185
01:28:31,621 --> 01:28:34,112
It was his daddy! Goss took him!

1186
01:28:34,224 --> 01:28:36,192
Goss took him,
and the police couldn't help me.

1187
01:28:36,293 --> 01:28:38,591
And I tried so hard,
and they couldn't help me!

1188
01:28:38,695 --> 01:28:40,094
Couldn't help you?

1189
01:28:40,197 --> 01:28:43,132
They wouldn't help me.
They wouldn't help me,

1190
01:28:43,233 --> 01:28:46,031
the police and the FBI, because they...

1191
01:28:46,136 --> 01:28:48,536
Because they paid Goss to take him.

1192
01:28:48,638 --> 01:28:52,438
They paid Goss to take him
and he gave him to them!

1193
01:28:52,576 --> 01:28:54,806
- He gave him to them!
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1194
01:28:54,911 --> 01:28:57,106
Get another piece. Get another piece.

1195
01:28:57,214 --> 01:28:59,774
Oh, God, R.C. was here.

1196
01:28:59,883 --> 01:29:02,477
R.C. was here and she left
'cause she was spying on you.

1197
01:29:02,586 --> 01:29:04,679
- And she was spying on us.
- Think.

1198
01:29:04,788 --> 01:29:06,380
What? No, and you brought the bugs.

1199
01:29:06,489 --> 01:29:09,356
The bugs were under your skin in the
egg sacs, and you brought the... And R. C...

1200
01:29:09,459 --> 01:29:11,484
- I brought the bugs.
- And R.C. brought you.

1201
01:29:11,595 --> 01:29:14,894
R.C. brought you, then you brought
the bugs and then R.C. brought the bugs!

1202
01:29:14,998 --> 01:29:17,228
- Yes!
- R.C. brought the bugs! The fucker!

1203
01:29:17,334 --> 01:29:20,667
R.C. brought the bugs!
And then, and then...

1204
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:22,670
And then Goss...
And then Goss got out of jail.

1205
01:29:22,772 --> 01:29:24,899
They let him out of jail
and he wasn't supposed to get out.

1206
01:29:25,008 --> 01:29:27,841
And they gave him this early parole,
and he came here and...

1207
01:29:27,944 --> 01:29:31,243
- Just when I showed up.
- Yeah, yeah, because they sent him.

1208
01:29:31,348 --> 01:29:33,908
Because they sent him.
They let him out early to send him here.

1209
01:29:34,017 --> 01:29:35,678
He made a deal. He got an early parole.

1210
01:29:35,785 --> 01:29:38,413
And they let him out to send here
because of the bugs, to track the bugs,

1211
01:29:38,521 --> 01:29:40,386
to check on the bugs,
to watch their progress.

1212
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:42,617
And R.C. told us that
there weren't any bugs.

1213
01:29:42,726 --> 01:29:44,694
- But R.C. brought the bugs.
- Right.

1214
01:29:44,794 --> 01:29:47,228
They made her bring the bugs. Oh, the boy!

1215
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:50,822
The boy, Lavoice's little boy,
they gave her the kid!

1216
01:29:51,067 --> 01:29:52,466
- Fuck!
- They never would've done that.

1217
01:29:52,569 --> 01:29:55,402
A couple of fucking queers!
They wouldn't have given them that kid!

1218
01:29:55,505 --> 01:29:58,633
And they made her bring me
the bugs to give me,

1219
01:29:58,742 --> 01:30:00,801
to give them the kid!

1220
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:03,242
And then, and then...

1221
01:30:03,346 --> 01:30:07,009
But, wait. No, no.
You never had bugs before you got here.

1222
01:30:07,117 --> 01:30:09,950
They had you all that time,
they did all those things to you,

1223
01:30:10,053 --> 01:30:13,819
and you never had no bugs until you got
here, until after you, until after we...

1224
01:30:13,923 --> 01:30:16,824
Oh, my God! After we...

1225
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,860
After we... Oh, it's...

1226
01:30:19,963 --> 01:30:21,692
It's "we," it's us, it's...

1227
01:30:21,798 --> 01:30:25,359
They... They... They gave you the...
What'd they call that... The drone.

1228
01:30:25,468 --> 01:30:28,733
They gave you the drone.
And gave me the queen.

1229
01:30:28,838 --> 01:30:30,806
They gave me the mother!

1230
01:30:30,907 --> 01:30:35,071
And that's when they came out. That's
when they mated, when we made them!

1231
01:30:35,178 --> 01:30:37,476
When we... And then, and then, and then...

1232
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,480
Oh, my God, it had to be me.

1233
01:30:39,582 --> 01:30:42,779
It had to be me from the very beginning
because they took... They took Lloyd.

1234
01:30:42,886 --> 01:30:45,616
They took him somewhere,
they took him to this laboratory,

1235
01:30:45,722 --> 01:30:47,690
and they...
And they cut him, and they cut him open,

1236
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:50,157
and the stuff matched or whatever, the DNA

1237
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,388
and the blood, it all went together,
and so they started to build...

1238
01:30:53,496 --> 01:30:55,987
They started to build,
they started to build the queen,

1239
01:30:56,099 --> 01:30:58,863
the mother, and they gave it to me.

1240
01:30:58,968 --> 01:31:00,902
They gave it to me.

1241
01:31:01,004 --> 01:31:03,199
The juice, the bug, the mother,

1242
01:31:03,306 --> 01:31:06,400
the bug, the super-mother bug.

1243
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:14,378
I am the super-mother bug!

1244
01:31:14,484 --> 01:31:18,887
I am the super-mother bug! Oh, my God!

1245
01:31:18,988 --> 01:31:20,922
We made them!

1246
01:31:21,024 --> 01:31:23,424
We made them! We gave birth to them!

1247
01:31:23,526 --> 01:31:26,461
And they will never leave us. They will
never leave us because we made them.

1248
01:31:26,563 --> 01:31:29,896
And those people... Those people are trying
to come in here to kill us

1249
01:31:29,999 --> 01:31:32,194
because the bugs won't go out
into the world to do their work!

1250
01:31:32,302 --> 01:31:36,432
They would never leave us! They will
never leave us! We are all they know.

1251
01:31:36,539 --> 01:31:39,167
And they're trying
to come in here to kill us,

1252
01:31:39,275 --> 01:31:41,573
to send the bugs back out into the world!

1253
01:31:41,678 --> 01:31:45,136
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
do you know what we have to do?

1254
01:31:45,248 --> 01:31:46,977
You know what we have to do?
We have to kill them.

1255
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:49,984
Yes, yes, yes.

1256
01:31:50,854 --> 01:31:52,253
It's better knowing.

1257
01:31:52,355 --> 01:31:54,880
Oh, we have to kill them.
We are responsible.

1258
01:31:59,629 --> 01:32:02,120
What is it?

1259
01:32:02,232 --> 01:32:04,666
- Who is it?
- Pizza Harris.

1260
01:32:04,768 --> 01:32:07,794
- When did I order a pizza?
- You order a pizza?

1261
01:32:07,904 --> 01:32:09,371
No.

1262
01:32:13,209 --> 01:32:16,007
- Just leave it!
- You gotta pay me, lady.

1263
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:21,409
- How much is it?
- $14.74.

1264
01:32:22,452 --> 01:32:24,579
- What's on it?
- Everything.

1265
01:32:26,322 --> 01:32:28,916
- Everything?
- Everything.

1266
01:32:29,025 --> 01:32:31,994
Everything.

1267
01:32:32,095 --> 01:32:35,656
- You want change?
- No. Just take it.

1268
01:32:35,765 --> 01:32:37,733
Yeah, whatever.

1269
01:32:42,972 --> 01:32:46,533
If we don't open the door,
they'll know we know.

1270
01:33:11,968 --> 01:33:15,665
Okay, ready? Okay, one, two...

1271
01:33:17,974 --> 01:33:20,374
No, no. No, no. Hold it.

1272
01:33:20,477 --> 01:33:22,069
Hold it.

1273
01:33:34,457 --> 01:33:36,448
How does it look?

1274
01:33:36,559 --> 01:33:38,527
I'm no expert.

1275
01:33:41,397 --> 01:33:44,230
- Oh, I don't think that's clean!
- Vicious bastards!

1276
01:33:46,169 --> 01:33:47,136
Aggie!

1277
01:33:50,874 --> 01:33:54,571
Open the fucking door! Aggie?

1278
01:33:54,677 --> 01:33:57,339
Damn it, Aggie, open this door!

1279
01:34:01,217 --> 01:34:02,184
Aggie!

1280
01:34:02,852 --> 01:34:04,877
Aggie, come here!

1281
01:34:05,822 --> 01:34:07,119
Aggie!

1282
01:34:12,529 --> 01:34:15,259
You whore! You fucking bitch!

1283
01:34:16,366 --> 01:34:19,096
Fuck! You fucking whore!

1284
01:34:22,472 --> 01:34:25,305
Open the fucking door!

1285
01:34:28,878 --> 01:34:30,812
They're all coming out.

1286
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:34,281
- Look at the ceiling...
- They're everywhere!

1287
01:35:23,099 --> 01:35:25,067
I am the drone.

1288
01:35:30,139 --> 01:35:31,766
You are the queen.

1289
01:35:32,842 --> 01:35:36,175
- Under the skin...
- Breeding ground...

1290
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:38,679
- Egg sac...
- Larvae pool...

1291
01:35:38,781 --> 01:35:40,908
- Baby bug water...
- Feeding pupa...

1292
01:35:41,017 --> 01:35:44,418
Oh, feeding baby bug.

1293
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,387
Skin and ground, breeding egg sacs...

1294
01:36:07,076 --> 01:36:10,204
- I love you.
- I love you.

1295
01:36:11,305 --> 01:36:17,468
