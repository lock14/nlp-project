2
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,156
- Happy Bayram!
- Thanks. Same to you.

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,646
- Shall I fill her up?
- Yes.

4
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,352
Happy Bayram.

5
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,756
- Happy Bayram.
- Same to you.

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,140
- Can you make me one with cheese?
- I'll hook you up.

7
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,316
- What's the music?
- It's Kazim Koyuncu.

8
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,141
- Don't you know him?
- No.

9
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,109
- His music is very popular down here.
- I've never heard of him.

10
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:38,569
He was from Artvin. Died of cancer
two years ago. He was young. Like you.

11
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,254
All because of Chernobyl.
It's only now that's becoming clear.

12
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,132
120, brother.

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,101
- And a toast?
- Yes.

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,669
That makes 130.

15
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,950
YETER'S DEATH

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,947
PROLETARIANS OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!

17
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,132
- Hello.
- Hello.

18
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,787
- Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,511
It's 50 euros for half an hour.

20
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,500
- What's your name?
- Jessy.

21
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:34,062
- Jessy, do you do French?
- French, Italian, Greek.

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,382
- I'll do it international for you.
- Bravo. Bravo.

23
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,765
- The music is alright?
- Sure, why not.

24
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,786
- Have you got the 50 euros?
- Yes.

25
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,220
- Take your clothes off.
- Yes.

26
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,920
- Are you Turkish?
- Could be.

27
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,060
Now I'm ashamed.

28
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,384
- What is your real name?
- Yeter. That's enough.

29
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:26,041
"Yeter" means "that's enough".
I'm the youngest of seven sisters.

30
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,196
- What will you have to drink?
- Water. Water.

31
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,261
Where are you from?

32
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,701
Uncle, have you come
here to chat or to fuck?

33
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,959
- Don't call me uncle, please.
- What shall I call you, then?

34
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,627
"My divine lover?"

35
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,950
- Please call me Ali.
- Ali.

36
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,734
- Can you still get it up at your age?
- God willing.

37
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,660
Show me.

38
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,716
- Goodbye, my rose!
- Take care, brother Ali.

39
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,146
She was speaking Turkish.

40
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,148
Ladies and gentlemen, we will be
arriving in Bremen in ten minutes.

41
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,322
We would like to say goodbye and
wish you all a good onward journey.

42
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,470
- Hello, dad!
- Hello, Nejat.

43
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,222
Sit down.
I'm still frying the fish.

44
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,765
- How are you?
- Fine.

45
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,679
- And you?
- Fine.

46
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,583
- I've brought you a book.
- What is it about?

47
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,286
Just read it.

48
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,661
- Are you having some raki?
- Please. And you?

49
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,387
Of course.

50
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:02,871
I've got this Iranian friend, Mahmut.
He's given me a tip for the fourth race.

51
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,140
- Which horse?
- "Ofliff Sunsine".

52
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,999
- "Ofliff Sunsine"?
- Yes.

53
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,629
The fifth horse in the fourth race.

54
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,030
Do you mean "Sunshine of Life"?

55
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,967
- What does that mean?
- The sun of life.

56
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,654
It would be nice if the sun of life
would shine for us some day.

57
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,740
It's an outsider, dad.

58
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,947
We'll see.

59
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,823
The odds were at least 70 to 1!

60
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,533
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700.

61
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,112
- There you are.
- Thank you.

62
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,334
Come on, I'll treat you
to an ice cream, with chocolate.

63
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:26,041
Who are you screwing at the moment?

64
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:33,321
- A gentleman doesn't tell.
- I didn't know that.

65
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,348
It's impossible to talk to you
about anything, anyway.

66
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,917
Take care, dad!

67
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,734
- Read the book, okay?
- Yeah, yeah...

68
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,684
Goethe was opposed to revolution.
Not on ethical grounds.

69
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,858
Much because it seemed to him
to be too uncontrollable.

70
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,315
Two quotes illustrate this.
The first:

71
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,977
"Who wants to see a rose bloom
in the depths of winter"?

72
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,111
"Only a fool could want
this untimely intoxication."

73
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,631
Come now, old man!

74
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,794
- I'm not 14 any more. It takes time.
- Then I'll charge you extra.

75
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,810
I'll give you another 50.
Just talk, talk!

76
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,377
- Tell me to grab your ass!
- Grab my ass. Come, my lion!

77
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,078
I want to ask you something.
Are you happy with your job?

78
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,184
- I can't complain.
- Look. I live on my own.

79
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,148
I'm a pensioner, and a widower.
What's that saying?

80
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,886
- "Only God is entitled to solitude."
- Bravo.

81
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:15,436
I'm looking for a woman to live with.
I would pay as much as you earn here.

82
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,917
In return, you only sleep with me.
Agreed?

83
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,855
- Have you fallen for me, old man?
- You don't have to say anything now.

84
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,844
Here's my cell phone number.

85
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,821
Call me whenever you like.

86
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:24,121
- Peace be with you.
- I don't understand.

87
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,824
We heard you speak Turkish.
Are you ashamed of being a Turk?

88
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,708
You're both a Muslim and a Turk.
Understood?

89
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,324
- I'm not deaf.
- Don't try to be funny.

90
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,279
- You are on a false path. Repent!
- Repent!

91
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,823
- I repent.
- Don't let me catch you there again.

92
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,740
It would be a shame about you.

93
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,140
Peace be with you.

94
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,728
- Peace be with you.
- And peace be with you.

95
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,556
- He made his move too soon.
- Go on!

96
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,279
I'm glad that you came. Welcome.

97
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,310
- Will you treat me to a coke?
- Of course.

98
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,851
Are you hungry?

99
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,943
When you said you'd pay me
what I earn in the brothel...

100
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,890
- Were you being serious?
- How much do you earn?

101
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,934
I'm left with 3000 a month.
Do you have that much?

102
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,250
- I'll get it.
- How?

103
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,247
I get a pension and I have
some money on the bank.

104
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,968
I've got some land and
property back home.

105
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,710
And I have a son. He's a
professor at a German university.

106
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,277
He earns good money. If the worst
comes to the worst, he'll help us.

107
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,630
- Where are you from?
- Trabzon.

108
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,197
Listen, I won't make any demands.

109
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:32,328
All I want is for you to live with me,
and sleep with me.

110
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,543
- I am hungry after all.
- Okay, let's go.

111
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,949
- The soup is delicious.
- Please enjoy.

112
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,418
- Where did you learn to cook so well?
- I taught myself.

113
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,764
I raised the boy both
as a mother and a father.

114
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,565
I'll take care of it.

115
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,183
- You've brought him up well.
- Like a girl.

116
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,316
Here you are.

117
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,878
It's fish cakes.
You'll love them. Tuck in!

118
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,684
How old were you when your mom died?
- He was six months.

119
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:00,411
- Poor thing. Didn't you re-marry?
- I did. A widow with a daughter.

120
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,937
It didn't work out. They're long gone.

121
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,453
I'm a widow too.
My husband was shot in Maras in 1978.

122
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,056
- You're from Maras?
- Yes.

123
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,756
- More coke?
- I'll get it.

124
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,850
Sit yourself down. I'll fetch it.

125
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,140
- Are you really a professor?
- Yes.

126
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,571
- I'll fetch the dessert.
- I'll do it.

127
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,744
- No, because you're a guest.
- Lf I'm going to live here, I'll do it.

128
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:03,478
- Don't drink so much.
- I'm not drinking so much.

129
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,488
You got me drunk deliberately.

130
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,044
Keep your hands off her...

131
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,919
- Are you okay?
- Fuck off!

132
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,852
Yeter! Where are you, Yeter?

133
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,170
How did you two meet?

134
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,436
He came to me.

135
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,160
- Where?
- He didn't tell you?

136
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,020
I'm a lady of easy virtue.

137
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,006
What does that mean?

138
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,110
A whore. A hooker if you prefer.

139
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,902
Good night.

140
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,672
Nejat?

141
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,593
Dad...

142
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,676
Dad!

143
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,983
Hello. I'm Doctor Özada.
Your father had a heart attack.

144
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,215
His condition is critical.
He'll be in intensive care overnight.

145
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,606
We'll have to open up an artery.
Then we'll keep him for observation.

146
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,149
- Any questions?
- Can we see him now?

147
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,111
I'm afraid not. Excitement
isn't good for him right now.

148
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,840
Return tomorrow morning.

149
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,814
- Do you have any children?
- I have a daughter.

150
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,173
- How old is she?
- 27.

151
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,490
Does she know what you do?

152
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:16,602
She thinks I work in a shoe shop.
Occasionally I send her some shoes.

153
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,259
I would do anything for her.

154
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,338
I wanted her to study.
To become someone like you.

155
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:47,342
Getting old is awful.
There's no advantages.

156
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,646
Completely pointless!

157
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,424
You'll be released soon.
- Yeah, yeah.

158
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,599
Nejat, don't forget to
water the tomatoes.

159
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,094
Nejat, the tomatoes are ripe.

160
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,744
- Do you want one?
- Just to taste.

161
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,744
Let's bring him some.
Surely he'll be happy.

162
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,116
What's wrong?

163
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,586
I miss my daughter.

164
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,839
It's been so long since
I heard her voice.

165
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,566
I can't get ahold of her.

166
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,086
Nejat...

167
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,509
Did you fuck her?

168
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,319
I made some börek.
Would you like some?

169
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,040
Take it away. I don't
want any börek.

170
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,295
Don't look at me like that.
The doctor said "no pastry".

171
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,477
Fine, so eat shit.

172
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,534
You won't eat börek,
but you smoke. Seriously?

173
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,964
Don't get involved in my life.
You have yours and I have mine.

174
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,707
Are you leaving?

175
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,292
Wait!

176
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,631
Take this, for your trip.

177
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,556
Yeter

178
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,651
Make me a raki.

179
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,448
We'll shortly arrive in Hamburg.
Connection...

180
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,790
Did you fuck him?

181
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,420
I asked you a question.

182
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,624
- You're drunk.
- No I'm not.

183
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,691
Don't touch me!

184
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,136
Stop that!

185
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,654
I paid you,
and now I will fuck you.

186
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,374
- You don't own me.
- Yes, I do.

187
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,158
- Come on, give me a blowjob.
- Shove your money up your ass.

188
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,795
Where are you going?

189
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,869
- Where are you going?
- I'll go wherever I please.

190
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,574
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'll say it again.

191
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,014
I'll go wherever I want.
I know your type.

192
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,556
Yeter...

193
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,596
Yeter!

194
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,540
To your right again.

195
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,846
And stop.

196
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,906
Step inside here.

197
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,764
- It's so small.
- I'm afraid so.

198
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,206
Go on, enter.

199
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,403
You will be given your
personal items later.

200
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,484
We haven't seen Ayten for a long time.
She just dissapeared.

201
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,820
- Since when?
- A few months now.

202
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,746
That's her.

203
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:07,351
- Do you have a more recent photo?
- No, sorry. Have a look yourself.

204
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,172
Very cute.

205
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,386
- What was she studying?
- Economics...

206
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,676
- Medicine...
- No, sociology.

207
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,094
- Economics or medicine?
- To be honest I don't know.

208
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,513
Enough already.

209
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,858
- Can I have that photo?
- Yes, but that's her mother.

210
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,062
Take it.

211
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,260
- Where are you staying, cousin?
- In a hotel.

212
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,364
- Stay with me.
- It's okay.

213
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,024
- I'm serious.
- I'm fine on my own.

214
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,436
- How long will you stay?
- As long as it takes to find her.

215
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:56,743
With 20 million people in Istanbul,
you're bound to run in to her.

216
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,810
- Name?
- Ayten Öztürk.

217
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,263
- From?
- Either Maras or Istanbul.

218
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,620
Kahramanmaras...

219
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,906
One moment please.

220
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,485
- Name?
- Ayten Öztürk.

221
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,897
- I meant your name.
- Nejat. Nejat Aksu.

222
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:04,008
- Why are you looking for the girl?
- I want to finance her studies.

223
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,821
Why?

224
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,286
Why?

225
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,752
Because knowledge and education
are human rights.

226
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,487
Well said.

227
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,245
Listen, Nejat.

228
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:36,552
The streets and our case files
are full of kurdish children.

229
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,870
We deal with them every day.

230
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,294
They are illiterate
and turn to violence.

231
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,549
Wouldn't you rather
help one of them?

232
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:05,165
- What good will this do?
- Perhaps someone will get in touch.

233
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,470
FOR SALE

234
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,596
Shall we have a look inside?

235
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,998
I don't understand books. Especially
not those written in German.

236
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,911
I'm off to my workshop.
If you need me, give me a call.

237
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,946
See you soon! Bye.

238
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,877
Good afternoon.

239
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,406
And to you.

240
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,359
- Is this your bookshop?
- Yes.

241
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,925
- Do you like it?
- Yes, quite a lot.

242
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,459
- I'm glad. I'm Markus Obermüller.
- Nejat Aksu.

243
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,468
- Would you like some tea? Or coffee?
- Tea will do.

244
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,697
Çengiz, serve us some tea.
- Please have a seat.

245
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,456
How come you're selling?
- Well, you see...

246
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:47,524
I've been here for ten years.
All of a sudden I miss Germany.

247
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,297
Despite that I'm surrounded by
all this German litterature. It's like...

248
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:02,078
It's like a museum here.
Extinct. Like latin.

249
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,141
And I've been feeling... Homesick.

250
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,693
I understand. How much
do you want for the shop?

251
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,724
- What was your name again?
- Nejat Aksu.

252
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,690
- What is your occupation?
- Professor of german, in Germany.

253
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:33,634
- That would be funny, if... If a
turkish professor in germany-

254
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,982
would end up in a german bookshop
in Turkey. It fits!

255
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,846
Yes, maybe so.

256
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,389
So you're staying in Turkey
for the time being?

257
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,955
- Yes.
- And your work?

258
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,446
Perhaps teaching isn't really my call.

259
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,960
And your father?

260
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,589
A murderer is not my father.

261
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,340
LOTTE'S DEATH

262
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,054
Öcalan, we are with you!

263
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,309
Long live the partisan struggle!

264
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:36,576
The rights of the people
cannot be stopped!

265
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,266
A cop!

266
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,668
Pursuing person with gun.
Reinforcements to Dilek Café!

267
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,772
Fuck!

268
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,770
Who's been arrested?
Özlem, too?

269
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,587
Police!

270
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,517
Down on the floor!

271
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,706
Hey! You can't just...

272
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,467
Long live the resistance!

273
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,637
My name is Öznur.
Öznur Kulak.

274
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,195
My name is Gökce Tuna.

275
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,149
I am Nurhan Ertas!

276
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,382
- Hello.
- Welcome.

277
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,860
- What's the name in your passport?
- Gül Korkmaz.

278
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,783
Always use that name.
In subways and by bus, never ride black.

279
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,901
- What does that mean?
- You have to buy a ticket.

280
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,964
If you get stopped by the police
you don't know us.

281
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,507
Okay.

282
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,599
If you want to shower, go to the
bath house. The girls will show you.

283
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,733
The cheapest food is at the university.
You can eat for three euros.

284
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,186
This is where you sleep.

285
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,064
- Do you have money?
- About 20 euro.

286
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:19,237
- You could work for me.
You look like a waitress.

287
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:25,338
- Is Bremen far away from here?
- About an hour on by train.

288
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,287
Can you lend me some money?
I'll return them tomorrow.

289
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,471
- How much do you need?
- 100 will do.

290
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,913
Thanks.

291
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,896
1837, I'm Gabi.

292
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,640
- Hi, do you speak english?
- Yes.

293
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,885
- I need a phone number from Bremen.
- Where?

294
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,980
- From Bremen.
- Bremen, yes, and what?

295
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,872
- Name Yeter Öztürk.
- Öztürk is the surname?

296
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:09,773
Yes, name Yeter.
Y... e... t... e... r.

297
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,857
No, I only have with the Y
beginning with the name Jasmin.

298
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,052
Okay, I understand.

299
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,696
- Thanks.
- Bye, bye.

300
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,002
Foot...

301
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,713
Shoe...

302
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,206
SHOES

303
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:18,492
And now what? You owe me.
You need to work for me.

304
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,878
You call yourself a comrade?
Getting all uptight about £100!

305
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,095
- Do you even know who I am?
- How should I know?

306
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,220
- Toss her out!
- Get lost!

307
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,686
Fine, I'll go on my own.

308
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,975
- Get lost!
- You can all go fuck yourselves.

309
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:44,411
"Who wants to see a rose bloom
in the depths of winter?"

310
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,370
"Only a fool could want
this untimely intoxication." Secondly:

311
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:56,017
"I oppose revolutions, for they destroy
as many old things as it creates new ones."

312
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,904
- Excuse me, can I ask something?
- Sure.

313
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:19,048
I forgot my money and I'm hungry.
Can you give me some money? Borrow!

314
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,853
- How much do you need?
- Three, I think. Three is okay.

315
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,124
- I don't have change, just £10.
- Okay, no problem.

316
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:34,005
No, no! I can change it inside.

317
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,899
- Give me your adress, I'll send you the money.
- You don't have to.

318
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,041
Yes, please.

319
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:48,202
- Next time you can invite me.
- Okay. Chicken please.

320
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,306
Aren't you hungry?

321
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,157
What are you studying?

322
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,204
- How do you say it in german?
- Sociology.

323
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,228
- And you?
- English and spanish.

324
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,390
- Where do you come from?
- I'm from Istanbul.

325
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,870
- And you came here to study?
- No.

326
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,263
- So, why are you here?
- Because it's cheap.

327
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,014
- Do you like it?
- I don't care because I'm hungry.

328
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,181
Where do you live?

329
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,646
Nowhere.

330
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,815
But where do you sleep?

331
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,950
Do you really want to know?

332
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,552
Yes.

333
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,344
This is the kitchen.
You can take anything, anytime.

334
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,266
I'll show you the guest room.

335
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,750
- Hello mom.
- This is my mother Suzanne.

336
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,900
This is Gül.
She's staying with us for a while.

337
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,536
- Hello.
- Hello.

338
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,594
- I hope the bed is not too small.
- No, it's perfect.

339
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,721
Want to see my room?

340
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,381
- Cute...
- Yeah. I used to live here during school.

341
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:14,333
I just came back from India.
I was three months in India.

342
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,000
- Oh I see.
- Do you have anything to wash?

343
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,983
I had to escape quick, that's
why I only have these clothes.

344
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,827
Do you want to try my things?

345
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,786
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

346
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,851
Yes...

347
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,725
- And this?
- Good.

348
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:56,402
- No, I don't like American brands.
- I guess you're right.

349
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,266
Thank you Charlotte.

350
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,501
Lotte. You can call me Lotte.
It's shorter.

351
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,814
No, I like Charlotte. It's better.

352
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:20,464
Very generous of you, letting a
stranger come and stay with us.

353
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,245
- We have to help her.
- You don't even know her.

354
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:31,646
That is so german, mom! She's here
illegally. She's persecuted back home.

355
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:38,102
- Then she should apply for asylum.
- Yes, and if she's not granted it?

356
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,965
You know that it's illegal.

357
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,626
Would you be kind enough
to make her bed?

358
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:46,762
Lebensmittel is something very german.
It started in the 1300's and...

359
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:54,007
I don't know how to say it in english
but it's something very german.

360
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,571
- When you're baking bread...
- Baking bread?

361
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,094
No, no, it's "backen".
I'll show you.
