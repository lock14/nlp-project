1
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:56,296
You have
a safe flight, okay?

2
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:01,160
Hey, take care
of that daughter of yours.

3
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:56,994
Papi!

4
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:24,993
Papi!

5
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:10,304
Ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:13,573
Welcome to Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport.

7
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:16,258
Please check
the overhead monitors

8
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,335
for flight arrival
and departure times.

9
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,010
Please keep
all personal items,

10
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:26,211
including luggage,
with you at all times.

11
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,898
Unattended luggage

12
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,495
by law enforcement
officials.

13
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:32,476
May I have your attention please?

14
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,722
This is a gate change
announcement.

15
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:38,238
- Jesse!
- Jesse! Jesse!

16
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:41,245
Oh, ho ho!
Welcome back!

17
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,587
- Come on, man!
- Yeah, baby!

18
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:44,735
What's up?

19
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,529
You find any weapons of
mass destruction over there?

20
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:49,533
- You on Social Security yet, asshole?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,613
- Oh, man.
- How you doing, man?

22
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,541
- So good to see you, brother.
- So good to see you.

23
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:56,158
- Man, it's been too long.
- I know. I know, man.

24
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:59,132
- I missed you.
- You girls want to stop the fappy shit?

25
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,377
- It's happy hour, man.
- What?

26
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,682
- It's 11:00.
- Not in Amsterdam!

27
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:05,178
It's party time!

28
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:14,497
Grandpa, you want
to watch the road?

29
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:19,192
- Oh, look at that.
- Let me see, man.

30
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:21,123
- Oh, that's not bad.
- Not bad, bro.

31
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,643
- That gonna heal up real nice.
- Looks good, man.

32
00:04:23,684 --> 00:04:25,244
- That's cool.
- Johnny's all deals.

33
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:27,257
- Oh! Oh oh! Oh!
- This is it.

34
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,706
This is the ad for the store!
Check it out.

35
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:30,779
- Check it out.
- Shh shh shh!

36
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,503
- Listen to this.
- Plasma screen TVs, at absolutely...

37
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,775
...rock bottom prices.

38
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:38,560
Excuse me, Mr. Sexy Voice Man,

39
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,864
but why are you
standing in the middle of the store...

40
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,451
- ... in just your underwear?
- Who, me?

41
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,378
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm just trying

42
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,280
- to give you 60".
- Oh!

43
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,966
That's so cheap!
Yo yo yo, B,

44
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,237
you should see the honeys
I've got lined up for the next ad.

45
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,477
- Caliente.
- Oh, come on, Father Time.

46
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,968
You think that dye job
in your hair fools anybody?

47
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,049
Just 'cause your illegal
Mexican ass can't afford-

48
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,366
Old ass man.

49
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,092
I'm gonna tell you the difference
between me and you.

50
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,496
- What's that? You tell me.
- I'm legal.

51
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:08,918
You a wannabe legal.

52
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:11,165
Ouch.
Yo, whoa whoa whoa.

53
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,015
Johnny, turn on Sacramento.
It's coming up pretty soon.

54
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,089
Wait. You want your ma to kill us?

55
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,016
It'll be fine.
Just turn on Sacramento

56
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:20,121
- when we get up there.
- Papo, what's the rush?

57
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,364
Your aunt's still pissed that we were late
to Mauricio's wedding.

58
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,222
Are you kidding me?
You're still harping on that?

59
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,360
The priest passed out
from heat stroke!

60
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,018
Dude, everybody knows
I need 15 minutes to blow-dry my hair.

61
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,324
- Otherwise it don't work.
- Road's coming up.

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,555
- Don't miss it.
- Let's hit the cuchi frito spot.

63
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,445
- Some bacaladitos maybe.
- Yeah, I'm hungry, bro.

64
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,618
- Johnny.
- Yo.

65
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:40,597
- Stop the car.
- Here?

66
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,166
- Yeah.
- What's up?

67
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:43,832
Are you crazy?
It's freaking cold out there.

68
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,494
I'm not gonna
stop the car.

69
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:47,955
- Stop the car!
- I'm not getting out!

70
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:51,413
- It's cold!
- Johnny! Ozzy!

71
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,843
Come here, bro.
What are you doing?

72
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,992
Oh, shit.

73
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:10,781
Welcome back, coz.

74
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,701
Welcome back.

75
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,741
Welcome back to Humble Park, man.

76
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:18,681
You feel sick?
You don't look sick.

77
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,571
Are you sure this medicine is not
gonna make me drowsy?

78
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:22,011
- Hi, Edy.
- I don't want to fall asleep

79
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,571
at my girl's
office party.

80
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:25,652
You're gonna be the most
beautiful woman there.

81
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,317
Thank you, Papi.
I'll see you later.

82
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:29,210
Okay.

83
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:36,403
- What?
- You know what, Don Juan.

84
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,549
If I didn't admire her,
she'd be insulted.

85
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:40,726
Please! Like you look
at Sister Maria here like that.

86
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:43,611
I wasn't always a nun.

87
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:45,749
Oh no.

88
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,729
Brother's even
stealing Santa suits.

89
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:49,429
Why don't you sit
on Santa's lap

90
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:50,711
and give me
your wish list?

91
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:53,332
$1, one menthol.

92
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,777
Why don't
you add 99 to that,

93
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,633
pay me back for
the Trinidad-Jones fight?

94
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,193
That fight was
over a year ago.

95
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,306
I swear, I'm never betting
with you again, Spencer.

96
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,037
30 years, you've never
ponied up once.

97
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:03,503
And why you bet
on Trinidad, anyway?

98
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:05,368
I usually never bet when
two brothers are fighting.

99
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:06,612
Trinidad is Puerto Rican.

100
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,209
How many times do
I have to explain to you

101
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,494
Puerto Ricans
ain't black?

102
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,155
Come on,
you know damn well

103
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:12,917
if Trinidad wasn't black,
I'd never bet on him.

104
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,448
I always bet
on the black man.

105
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:16,758
Lakers versus Celtics,
I always went Lakers.

106
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,387
Tiger versus the white boy
of the month...

107
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,952
I always go Tiger.

108
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:22,775
The only time I ever lost
was Apollo versus Rocky,

109
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,086
but I think
that shit was fixed.

110
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:25,681
Whatever.
Can I have my money?

111
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:27,477
If I prove to you that
Puerto Ricans are black,

112
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:28,690
then I don't owe you
one thin dime.

113
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:31,478
- Get out.
- Dad! Papi!

114
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:34,512
- Hey, Spence. Look at you.
- Hey, Mauricio.

115
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,560
- I like the black Santa scam.
- Hey, you know me.

116
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:38,161
Too bad Santa
only comes once a year.

117
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,989
- Know what I mean?
- Got that right.

118
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,912
Dad.
How's it going?

119
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:44,694
I couldn't just drive by
without paying tribute, you know?

120
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,281
Look at you.

121
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,726
How come
he gets to flirt?

122
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,904
'Cause he's mine.

123
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:52,245
- Hi, Tina.
- Hi.

124
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,166
- Nice blouse.
- Thank you.

125
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,370
Anna gave it to me
for my birthday last year.

126
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,869
Whoa.
Don't flash like that.

127
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,984
I'm a married man.
Cover them up.

128
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,253
Just kidding.

129
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,945
- That blouse Tina was wearing?
- Yeah?

130
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,317
I gave it to your mom
two Christmases ago.

131
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:10,449
Maybe it was a little too Lieutenant Uhura,
"Star Trek" for her.

132
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,309
Come on, Sarah.
Where's your Christmas spirit?

133
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:14,676
Where's hers?
She regifts everything.

134
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,011
Last year she gave me
a basket of toiletries with

135
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,085
with "Doubletree" and "Boca"
printed on it.

136
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,329
- Really?
- I still have the body lotion.

137
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:23,341
Oh, Sarah, come on.
Hey, do you know what would be

138
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,908
a great Christmas present
for my parents?

139
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:26,673
- TiVo?
- No no.

140
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,531
If we tell them we're
trying to have a baby.

141
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:29,994
- A baby?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:32,306
Are you high?

143
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,926
- We discussed this.
- No. No no no no no no no.

144
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:36,906
We're still in discussion
about this.

145
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,509
What are we gonna say to
my mom when she's all,

146
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:41,483
"All my friends have
grandchildren.

147
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,248
My mother had 10 grandchildren
when she was my age"?

148
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:45,553
We'll tell her
to adopt an embryo

149
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:47,278
and have one herself.

150
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,805
- Merry Christmas.
- Feliz Navidad.

151
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:24,876
Ay, mi niño!

152
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,604
You look so handsome.

153
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:33,259
- Hello, Sarah.
- Hello.

154
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:36,941
You went to the bodega
before you came home first?

155
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,384
- Yeah, well-
- What difference does it make?

156
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,075
They're here now.

157
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,112
You're lucky to have ran
into him at the bodega.

158
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:45,641
He's a little hard
to get ahold of these days.

159
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,944
Mira, she's almost
a Puerto Rican.

160
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,838
I'm sorry, can you say that
more slowly

161
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:00,522
and just enunciate
a little more clearly?

162
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,113
Yeah, well, she saying
"How are you?"

163
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:04,907
She says, "How are you?"
How are you?

164
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,594
- Oh. Muy bien.
- There you go.

165
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:10,348
It looks like you've lost
a little bit of weight.

166
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:15,976
She said
that you look great.

167
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,665
Oh. Thank you.
I just started Pilates.

168
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,386
Ay, bendito.
When am I gonna have grandchildren?

169
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:22,983
My mother had 10
at my age.

170
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,746
All of my friends
have grandchildren.

171
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:26,855
I'm going to be the only
Puerto Rican grandmother

172
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,033
who's gonna have to
adopt grandchildren.

173
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,925
Anna, leave
the children alone.

174
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,617
Do you want to drive them
back to New York?

175
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:34,312
Thanks, Dad.

176
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,811
Anybody else home yet?

177
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,261
Our little
Hollywood movie star

178
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:38,820
is about to pull up
in her limo any minute.

179
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:00,259
Merry Christmas!

180
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:03,115
- Oh, it's our little movie star!
- Hi, Dad.

181
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:06,312
- Stop stop stop.
- Mom, you're like paparazzi.

182
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:08,453
- Hi, Mom!
- Where's the limo driver?

183
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,216
He had another pickup
at the airport.

184
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,357
Hi, Mami. How are you?
Where's Jesse?

185
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,631
- Is he here yet?
- Johnny and Ozzy went to pick him up.

186
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,096
Oh God,
he'd be safer in Iraq.

187
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,147
Whoa!

188
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:20,871
Yo, Ozzy!

189
00:11:20,907 --> 00:11:22,849
- My bad, man!
- Come on, bro.

190
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,834
You threw that
like Marcia Brady.

191
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,979
Hey, I'm not the one who wore diapers
in Little League.

192
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,579
For your information,
Mr. Asshole,

193
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:30,823
they were disposable
underwear. okay?

194
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,095
- I had a bladder problem.
- Yeah, a lot of girls have that problem.

195
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,691
There was
an epidemic going on.

196
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,705
There were thousands of kids
having to wear those.

197
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,233
- Epidemic.
- Can we get to the game?

198
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,997
What you think we're doing?

199
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,944
Talking like two old ladies.
Come on, man.

200
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:44,512
- You swing like one.
- Here comes the heat, baby.

201
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:46,692
Throw that like a man.
I ain't got all day.

202
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,430
- Oh! Home run!
- Oh!

203
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,531
I could've caught that.

204
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,358
Come on! Catch the ball,
you old ass man!

205
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:58,280
Oh!

206
00:11:58,314 --> 00:12:01,248
- Come on, man!
- Johnny! Come on!

207
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,493
I threw it right to him.
He could've caught that.

208
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,070
Ozzy!

209
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:10,374
Yo! Come on, man!

210
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,709
Ozzy, what are you doing?
Throw the ball!

211
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,915
Yo! Freaking
freezing out here!

212
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,708
Let's go, papo!

213
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:18,631
Ozzy!

214
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,606
What are you doing, man?

215
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,141
Give me the ball.

216
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:35,870
Ozzy. Chill, man.
Don't do nothing stupid.

217
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,146
I can't believe that
bitch Alexis is out.

218
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:40,255
He killed
my brother, man.

219
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:42,269
That punk-ass,
he kills his brother

220
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,903
and he's hanging out
like nothing happened?

221
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,371
What kind of justice
is that, Jesse?

222
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:46,908
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

223
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,892
"Come on" what, bro?
It's not even worth it.

224
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,455
- What are you trying to say?
- Not even worth it.

225
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,853
Got your name up
on a billboard, Jesse,

226
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,708
like when Jordan came back
to the United Center.

227
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:02,913
Whole neighborhood gonna be lining up,
welcoming you back.

228
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,291
A Boricua war
hero, pal.

229
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,172
Puerto Rico, whoa!

230
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:09,921
- Puerto Rico, whoa!

231
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:14,178
Ay, Dios mio.
Ay, bendito.

232
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:16,895
My baby.
Mi niño.

233
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:19,168
Mi vida.

234
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:21,920
- Preciosos, you're home. I can't believe it.
- Hey, Ma.

235
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,329
What is it going to take
for you two to be on time?

236
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,470
- The hair. The hair.
- Your hair.

237
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,418
- Come on.
- Are you okay?

238
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,849
Huh? I'm good.
I'm good.

239
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,280
Thank God you never have to go back
to that place again.

240
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:39,105
I swear if I ever meet those
people that hurt you, baby,

241
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:42,619
- I'll kill them.
- Hey, Uncle Edy. How you doing?

242
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:44,120
Oh, you're smothering him.

243
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:46,845
Give the boy
a chance to breathe.

244
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:48,671
You look like
a Puerto Rican Gorbachev.

245
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,594
- Hi.

246
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:52,383
- What's up, Roxanna?
- Hey.

247
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:55,417
- Yo, Mauricio.
- It's so good to see you.

248
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,474
You too.
You look good.

249
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:03,131
The Penn game.
Dad, we're missing the Penn game.

250
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,442
- Gracia, Mamita.

251
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:11,098
Hey, Ma,
did Sarah tell you?

252
00:14:11,138 --> 00:14:13,472
She was a big hit
at her office Christmas party.

253
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:15,393
- She made coquito from scratch.
- You did?

254
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,465
- Can you believe that?
- I Googled the recipe.

255
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:19,643
Why didn't you call me
instead of this Google?

256
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,568
- It's a search engine.
- Ma.

257
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,007
I needed it quickly.

258
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,895
I thought
it would be fun.

259
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,001
There's some Puerto Ricans
who work in the firm.

260
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,790
As what? Janitors?
An assistant lavaplatos?

261
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:33,304
- Probably.
- Jose is an associate.

262
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:35,231
- An associate.
- How nice.

263
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,685
And I told them
how we celebrate the parranda,

264
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:39,615
where we sing
the Christmas carols

265
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:42,517
and go house to house
to surprise the neighbors.

266
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,658
Wow, Mo, I didn't know your girl
was so down with the neighborhood.

267
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,566
I know.
Sarah's a volunteer.

268
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,134
What do you have to
offer the world, Johnny?

269
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,735
What's your
contribution besides

270
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:54,295
zero money down
and debt into afterlife?

271
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,157
- Oh!

272
00:14:58,238 --> 00:15:00,125
I got him good
with that afterlife jab.

273
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,197
Okay, enough enough.
I want to propose a toast.

274
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:06,361
Here's to having
everybody home,

275
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,286
especially Jesse.

276
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:10,173
- Salut.
- To Jesse.

277
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:11,634
Jesse. L'Chaim.

278
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:14,973
What?
What he say?

279
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,460
Jesse, I want
to ask you:

280
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,410
Did you see
some of that messed up

281
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,525
"Black Hawk Down"
type of shit over there?

282
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:23,670
Did that really
happen that way?

283
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:29,019
I don't know, man.
I-

284
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,994
He doesn't want to talk about that.

285
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:33,622
- You don't wanna talk about that.
- It's okay.

286
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,482
You talk
when you're ready.

287
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:38,004
I'm gonna
go check the rice.

288
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,459
So, Tio Edy, when are you gonna
come down to the store

289
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,663
so I can set you up with a beautiful
plasma flat-screen TV?

290
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,773
I don't need one of those.
This TV is perfectly fine.

291
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,201
- Oh.
- That always works.

292
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:51,796
You could watch the Cubs
in high definition.

293
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,241
So I could have
a crystal clear image

294
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:54,901
of seeing them getting
their asses kicked?

295
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:56,597
- No no, gracia.

296
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,609
- So, Roxanna, mi amor.
- Mmm?

297
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,276
So tell us what's
going on in Hollywood.

298
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:01,841
Yeah, who's gay now?

299
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,792
You, you stupid ass.

300
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,842
The gay gene skipped
my side of the family.

301
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,849
Yeah, right. Like Uncle Roy who still
has a roommate at 60.

302
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:11,279
- That's right, a "roommate. "
- Life partner, man.

303
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:14,005
Enough. You hear back
from that TV show?

304
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:16,376
Dad, they haven't decided yet.
But they said I brought

305
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,311
an organic vulnerability
to the character that plays as cultural-

306
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,005
You'd definitely play a much more organic
Mexican than Oz over here.

307
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,634
- Don't start.
- What are you talking about?

308
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:25,462
- What? Start what?
- You know.

309
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:27,799
- What do I know?
- You almost went there. Forget it.

310
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,938
- How'd I almost go there?
- Nothing, forget it.

311
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:33,043
- Say the line.
- You're supposed to be on my side.

312
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,469
- Say the line. Say the line.
- No.

313
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,203
- Say the line.
- Do the line.

314
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:39,891
Sorry. Onto bigger
and better things.

315
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,652
Come on, baby.
It's not like a million people

316
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:44,885
haven't already seen you
in that sexy peasant blouse,

317
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,156
batting your beautiful
brown eyes for Señor Taco.

318
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:49,614
You know what?
I've got the bootleg too.

319
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,565
All right,
I'll say the line.

320
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,993
No no, it's more like...

321
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,847
Oh, stop.

322
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,254
It's- it's...

323
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:03,446
No no no no no.

324
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:05,366
You'd better watch it.
You'd better watch it.

325
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,286
Assholes.

326
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,285
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough.

327
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:13,142
So tell me, this new show
you're up for...

328
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:14,800
It's a midseason replacement

329
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:16,846
and it's coming on after
"Desperate Housewives,"

330
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:18,642
- which is big.
- Oh wow.

331
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,434
- Are you gonna be able to meet them?
- I might, actually.

332
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,357
What about you, Sarah?
How's work?

333
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,277
- Yeah, what's going on on Wall Street?
- Yeah.

334
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,098
Yeah, how are you
guys gonna have enough time

335
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,922
to make some kind of
sorta-Ricans?

336
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,162
No, we are.
Not right away,

337
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,725
We've got plenty of time.
What's the rush?

338
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:34,483
Why are you throwing me
with the baby Latin curve here?

339
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:37,648
By now you guys should be up to four,
five, six, maybe seven, eight kids.

340
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,724
- Come on.
- Yo, does your plumbing work?

341
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:42,896
My pipes flow just fine. You want to check,
Johnny? Want to take a gander?

342
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,591
Why you getting
so macho about yourself?

343
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:46,189
We're all here, brother.
You can talk to us.

344
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:48,171
If I needed somebody
to talk to,

345
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,416
- you'd be the last person I would go to.
- Right.

346
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:53,006
I'm gonna ask Anna
if she needs any help in the kitchen.

347
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:55,116
- That's great.
- What did I do?

348
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:56,651
You know
why you're single?

349
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:57,837
'Cause every time
you open your mouth

350
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,469
it's like
a woman repellant.

351
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:01,165
The women go whoosh!
Just saying.

352
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:03,211
I'm just saying.
Look, I understand.

353
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,138
It's gotta be hard,
especially for two

354
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:07,473
obviously successful
people like yourselves.

355
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:09,133
I didn't know that's
what you were going for.

356
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,211
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you. I love you.

357
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:13,039
You know, this is
as good as any time.

358
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,278
I wanted
to tell all of you

359
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:17,803
that they're
talking partnership at the law firm.

360
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:19,752
- No.
- And I've been groomed by the COO,

361
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:22,031
so it's an almost
guaranteed slot in there.

362
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,692
- Great.
- Work work work.

363
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:25,486
Mauricio, all you talk about is work.
It's a holiday.

364
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,115
What's important is
everybody's here together.

365
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:29,772
We're all together now.
That's what's important.

366
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,199
- Yeah.
- That's great.

367
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:35,057
Doesn't matter.

368
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,807
I'm- I'm gonna
go get the door.

369
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:40,427
Yeah, excuse me.

370
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:44,044
- One second.
- Uncle Edy, slap the dinosaur.

371
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,561
Hey. Please tell me you heard something.

372
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,396
- Hey.
- Hey.

373
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,800
Welcome-
welcome back.

374
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:02,344
Th- thank you.

375
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:07,240
- Is that-
- That's Hector.

376
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,516
- My son.
- Really?

377
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:12,399
Oh. Hey.

378
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,318
- Say hi.
- How are you? Give me five.

379
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,358
That is a good-looking kid.

380
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:18,188
Had to circle the block
two times to find parking.

381
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:21,806
Hey, welcome back,
Jesse.

382
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,068
- Oh. Okay.
- Fernando.

383
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:28,364
Good to meet you.
Okay.

384
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,909
Hey, Mami. Hi.

385
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,187
Oh, hey, Mami.

386
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:36,840
- How are you?
- Who's the little boy?

387
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:38,820
Let's go upstairs.

388
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:41,131
Oh! This one is
the closest

389
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:42,954
I ever get to having
a grandchild.

390
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,745
Isn't he adorable?

391
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:48,359
Oh, yes.
Very very very cute.

392
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:50,600
Hector,
come on, behave.

393
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,426
Hey, how are you doing?
How's your mother?

394
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:54,436
Great. Thank you
for asking, Mr. Rodriguez.

395
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:56,649
Nice to see you. Oh, excuse me.

396
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:58,986
- I have to take this.
- Let's go say hi.

397
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,159
Yeah, hi.
Just give me one second.

398
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:05,127
Ma, since when did Dad get
all Dick Cheney on you?

399
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:08,481
Well, whoever it is, they must be
more important than his family.

400
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,499
- I've gotta finish dinner.
- Ma, what are you talking about?

401
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,166
- He didn't say that.
- Would you like any help?

402
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:13,633
No.

403
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,050
Is it weird being a mom?

404
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,280
You were there.
You remember Rick.

405
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:25,217
That jerk.
He was such a bad father.

406
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:28,161
As soon as Hector was born,
Rick just left.

407
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:30,569
- Rick just split.
- Yeah.

408
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,807
But things are going really well
with me and Fernando,

409
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:35,690
and he treats Hector
like his own son.

410
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:37,610
Wow.
That's great, girl.

411
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:39,269
I just really love
my job.

412
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:41,990
Gotta be so cool to have a teacher
like you in high school.

413
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,312
You're gonna get
this gig, okay?

414
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,842
My agent says he feels
really good about it.

415
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:50,118
You know that Mr. Murphy
still asks about you?

416
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,680
Really?

417
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:53,958
He says that you
were the best actor

418
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:55,367
to come out
of Roberto Clemente.

419
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:57,791
Oh, that's so sweet.
You know what?

420
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,721
I still have that
gold-plated statuette

421
00:20:59,753 --> 00:21:01,641
that he gave me
for playing Blanche.

422
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:04,226
- Do you remember?
- Do you remember this song?

423
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,982
Do I?
It's my song, girl.

424
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,839
- Oh my God.
- Turn it up.

425
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:12,417
# I wanna sex you up... #

426
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:14,877
# Now let's pour
a glass of wine #

427
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,117
# 'Cause now we're all alone,
I've been waiting... #

428
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,316
Please tell me you are not auditioning
for any musicals.

429
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,719
Stop singing.
You're gonna break the mirror.

430
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:25,857
Were you two kissing?

431
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:27,586
- Johnny.
- I wanna watch.

432
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:29,053
Johnny, we're having
girl time.

433
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:30,950
- I can share.
- No, you can't.

434
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:33,024
- No! Oh yeah?
- Shut up. Whoa!

435
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:35,300
Don't mess my hair!
Don't mess my hair up!

436
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:38,979
- Oh, man.
- Help me!

437
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:40,476
Come on, man!
Oh!

438
00:21:40,518 --> 00:21:42,013
Help me out!

439
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:43,549
- You swing like a girl!
- Get out of the way!

440
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,794
You want a piece
of me? Huh? Huh?

441
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,390
Don't! Jesse!

442
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,991
Oh my God.

443
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,143
You boys, tomorrow you've got to
help me take down this tree.

444
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:56,637
Come on, Dad.
It's a holiday, for crying out loud.

445
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:59,427
You still do hard work,
Mr. Lawyer Man?

446
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:01,534
Johnny, I work out.
What are you trying to say?

447
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:03,745
- He works out.
- Oh yeah, you work out

448
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:06,499
with your $65-an-hour
trainer/lover/boyfriend.

449
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:14,273
I bet your flabby ass
isn't lifting

450
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:16,163
60" plasmas
personally

451
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:18,237
to people's cars,
you pudgy bastard.

452
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:20,797
My ass isn't gonna be here tomorrow
chopping down no tree.

453
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:22,975
Big baby. Listen,
I've got a chainsaw.

454
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:25,151
Oh yeah, the one they used to make
Jesus's cross with.

455
00:22:25,188 --> 00:22:27,774
It still works.
All it needs is a little oil.

456
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:30,332
We go to the zoo,
kidnap a couple of beavers.

457
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:32,738
They take it down for free.
They drag it away.

458
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:34,975
I've got a couple of chainsaws.
I can come by tomorrow.

459
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,702
Thanks a lot, Nando.

460
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,430
I can swing by too,
help you cut this down.

461
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:40,028
No, not you, Ozzy.
I need you at the store.

462
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,659
Why you want to cut
down the tree, Pop?

463
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:44,001
I promised
your mother a view.

464
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:45,944
And it's old.
Look at it.

465
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:47,580
The base is weak.
It's leaning over to one side.

466
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,146
It's no good no more.

467
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:51,455
Is that you you're talking
about or the tree?

468
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:54,141
Oh! Oh!

469
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:56,545
Dig into that.

470
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:58,269
No thanks.
Can you believe-

471
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:01,404
- I finally got him to sleep.
- He's down? Good.

472
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,738
It used to be
Logan Boulevard.

473
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,272
It used to be
a mattress store.

474
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:10,524
Somebody made
me pay for it.

475
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,479
Why is
everybody fighting?

476
00:23:20,513 --> 00:23:22,302
They're not fighting.
They conversating.

477
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:25,948
Mom, you may be a drug dealer
by giving me that stuff there.

478
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:27,872
I thought it was Roxie's.

479
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:31,549
Attention, por favor,
por favor.

480
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,592
I'd just like
to say something.

481
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,770
It's fantastic that
we're all together.

482
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:38,263
Gracia, Dio,
that we're safe, home

483
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:41,152
- and warm, indoors.
- Good one, Dad.

484
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:42,875
I'd like to propose a toast-

485
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:44,221
Oh, good timing.

486
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,551
Excuse me.

487
00:23:50,111 --> 00:23:52,412
There's something
I'd like to say.

488
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:57,015
I'm divorcing your father.

489
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,608
That's crazy.

490
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,916
That's not a toast, okay?
Come on.

491
00:24:01,951 --> 00:24:04,700
That's not even funny.
What is that?

492
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,295
Why? Mom, stop, please.

493
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:07,928
That don't sound like a toast to me.

494
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:15,061
- Come on. Stop that, Ma.
- Mom.

495
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:20,348
- Coño.
- Why? You've been married for 36 years.

496
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:21,527
- You can't-
- So?

497
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:23,387
"So"?
You're old.

498
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,796
Who are you calling old?

499
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,291
I've got a lot
of life left in me.

500
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,828
Who do you think kept
all of this together?

501
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,047
I don't need him.

502
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:33,202
Well, if that's
what you want to do...

503
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:36,921
- What?
- ... I can't stop you.

504
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:41,493
What?
What is going on?

505
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:44,052
I'm gonna step out
for a minute, get some air.

506
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:45,980
Ozzy, come on.

507
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:49,176
- Excuse me.
- Happy?

508
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,972
Dad, did you cheat
on her again?

509
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:55,734
- Papi, you cheated?
- You didn't tell me that.

510
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:57,113
- Sarah, stay out of it.
- Papi?

511
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,773
Did you cheat again?

512
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,185
Is that what
your mother thinks?

513
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:01,909
Mysterious phone calls
all the time.

514
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:03,670
You disappear
in the middle of the day.

515
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:06,095
Ay, Papi! How could you?
How could you?

516
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,927
Don't raise your voice
to me in my own house!

517
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:10,297
You know what?
I'm disgusted with both of you.

518
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,567
I'm so disgusted.

519
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:14,325
What, are you gonna
date other people?

520
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:15,987
For starters.

521
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:19,288
Oh! Excuse me.
This is making me sick.

522
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:22,256
Come on, Jesse.
Jump in any time you feel like.

523
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:25,112
Say something, will you?
Come on.

524
00:25:25,145 --> 00:25:27,731
- It's their life.
- What? "It's their life"?

525
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,744
"It's their life"?

526
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:31,924
Three years in Iraq,
and this is the wisdom you have to offer?

527
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:34,448
- Oh!
- It's their life. Wow.

528
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:37,271
That's great.
Thanks, Dad, for doing this to us.

529
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:40,054
Thank you for ruining our lives.
Thank you so much for that.

530
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:41,976
Why don't you relax?
Why don't you leave Pop alone?

531
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,464
- This isn't about you.
- That's it. Take that side.

532
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:46,577
- I'm not taking a side.
- Of course you are.

533
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:48,722
Why don't you two become roommates
and go hang out at Starbucks

534
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:50,386
like the losers you are
because you screwed up

535
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,918
the best things
you ever had in your lives?

536
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,454
Mo!

537
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:56,343
I'm gonna take
Hector home.

538
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:58,547
- Yeah.
- Thank you for dinner.

539
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:00,493
- And thanks so much, Mo.
- I'm sorry.

540
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:01,813
Thank you.

541
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:06,896
I'm sorry, Jesse.
I got a little hot-headed.

542
00:26:06,936 --> 00:26:09,040
Just- just-
bro, just...

543
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:11,953
I think you've
said enough, man.

544
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:15,535
Jesse, I said
I was sorry.

545
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,844
- Hey. Hey.
- Yeah.

546
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:21,037
Why'd you have to call out
your brother like that?

547
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,289
Because I'm the only one-

548
00:26:22,326 --> 00:26:24,431
After all
he's been through?!

549
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:27,821
You should concentrate
on your own relationship

550
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:29,389
instead of worrying
about everybody else's.

551
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:39,692
Well, merry goddamn
Christmas, everybody.

552
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,773
Stop.

553
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:43,756
Go to your room.

554
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:45,619
You know what?
I'm gonna do you one better, Ma.

555
00:26:47,413 --> 00:26:49,355
Come on, Sarah.
Let's go to the Drake.

556
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:51,698
I haven't finished
eating yet.

557
00:26:52,853 --> 00:26:54,576
Yeah, whatever.

558
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:03,532
Did you like
the tostones?

559
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,874
Delectable.

560
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:13,361
Nata de coco?

561
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:16,714
I'd love some.

562
00:27:20,243 --> 00:27:23,341
Look, do you have
a Marriott or a Radisson?

563
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,353
A Motel 8?

564
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,664
Look, I'll take an empty jail cell-
anything you've got.

565
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:29,967
- Have you gone off your meds?
- Yeah, okay.

566
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:31,377
Thank you very much.

567
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,777
Let me know
if anything opens up.

568
00:27:35,411 --> 00:27:37,003
Piece of shit.

569
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,180
Sarah, let me have
your Crackberry.

570
00:27:39,218 --> 00:27:41,105
I'm gonna call hotels. com,
see if they've got anything.

571
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:43,374
I know you're freaked out about this
whole divorce thing,

572
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:45,776
but don't you think we should stay here
and be supportive?

573
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:48,711
Supportive of them throwing 36 years
of their marriage down the toilet?

574
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:50,280
Are you kidding?
Give me that.

575
00:27:50,322 --> 00:27:52,493
Do you want to make things worse
for your mother?

576
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:54,471
Her husband
cheated on her.

577
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:57,164
And this is coming
from the woman who reserved two rows

578
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,175
for her parents' exes at our wedding.
Just give me that.

579
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:01,006
- No.
- Come on. Give it to me now.

580
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,796
- No.
- Sarah, I'm gonna take it from you.

581
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:05,253
- We're staying here.
- No, we're not staying.

582
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:06,954
You've been bugging me for months
to stay in a hotel.

583
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:08,814
- Shh!
- We're not gonna stay-

584
00:28:08,848 --> 00:28:10,637
- Shh! Do you want them to hear you?
- What?

585
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,614
Are you afraid they might find out
you think this place...

586
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,071
stinks of fried pork
and chuleta, tocineta, puñeta?

587
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:25,832
Well, somebody's been
a naughty little girl.

588
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,806
You've been emailing back and forth
with this Barry Kravitz, huh?

589
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:31,367
Didn't you tell me you turned his job
offer down months ago

590
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:34,439
because of the traveling and
the crazy hours, the pressure?

591
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,294
They came back.
They sweetened the deal.

592
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:39,235
And heofferedto back

593
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,378
Brian Donaldson and I
in our own hedge fund.

594
00:28:42,415 --> 00:28:46,571
We would be managing
$300 million just to start.

595
00:28:46,606 --> 00:28:49,508
- $300 mi-
- Yeah.

596
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,851
And use of the private jet too.
Look at that.

597
00:28:51,885 --> 00:28:54,733
Pretty sweet.
Congratulations.

598
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,521
That's great.

599
00:28:57,965 --> 00:29:00,386
When were you planning
to break it to me gently?

600
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:02,731
I just-

601
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:07,402
I just needed
a little time to think it over alone.

602
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:29,962
Requesting a bunk,
Lance Corporal.

603
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:31,751
You're gonna
sleep in here?

604
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:33,313
Your mother threw me
out of the bedroom.

605
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,394
And you act surprised.

606
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:39,232
Mijo, life is
full of surprises.

607
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:41,729
- Oh.
- Everybody down at the bodega,

608
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,527
they're all dying
to talk to you.

609
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:46,344
Anyway, this gives us
a chance to catch up.

610
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,786
I'm worried
about you and Ma.

611
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:52,997
Yeah? We're more
worried about you.

612
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:54,180
I'm fine.

613
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,368
You know, Jesse,

614
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:01,126
we know you've
been through a lot.

615
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:04,806
Your mother and me,
we rented "Coming Home. "

616
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:06,946
I'm surprised you didn't rent
"Taxi Driver. "

617
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:08,808
Yeah, we rented
that too.

618
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,525
It's not good to keep things
bottled up inside.

619
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,950
You've seen some stuff-
some really bad stuff.

620
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:15,651
It's a war, Pop.

621
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,722
And you did
your very best.

622
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,030
You did.

623
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,060
It should've been me...

624
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:36,768
not Lenny.

625
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:40,800
Beating yourself up
isn't going to bring him back, mijo.

626
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,782
And if Lenny was
here right now,

627
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:44,797
he'd tell you
he'd want you to move on.

628
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,781
His folks...

629
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:52,420
I can't imagine they're
having too many laughs now.

630
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:54,883
No.

631
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:59,232
You call them?
It might help.

632
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,572
You know, Dad,

633
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:03,842
it's getting late.

634
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:06,939
Yeah, okay.

635
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:21,765
Jesus, Mo,
you scared me.

636
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,226
What are
you doing up here?

637
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:24,795
I'm just trying
to be alone, okay?

638
00:31:24,836 --> 00:31:26,178
I've got tequila.

639
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:30,558
- All right, you can stay.
- I know.

640
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:33,793
- What a night.
- What, is this hell?

641
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,901
- Are we in hell or what?
- Yeah.

642
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,663
Hm-mmm.
Hm-mmm.

643
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:39,903
- It's 10 below outside.
- No way. No way.

644
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,079
Mom won't let me smoke inside.
Go crack open a window!

645
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:44,537
I'm not cracking a window.
I'm not smoking your pollution.

646
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:47,067
- Fine. Fine.
- How about that? I saved your life.

647
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,994
- Crack that.
- How come I didn't get an invite?

648
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:50,554
- None needed.
- No jarheads allowed, man.

649
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:52,319
- Ow!
- Easy!

650
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:55,737
- Give me that.
- You having a flashback?

651
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,875
Wow.

652
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:01,435
It's like all I need is
to be smoking a blunt

653
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:03,362
and listening
to Biggie Smalls.

654
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:05,631
I lost my virginity
on that couch.

655
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:08,187
- Me too!
- Oh, God. Hail the syphilis!

656
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,365
- Oh God, hail you.
- Move move.

657
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:12,290
Don't be mad 'cause
you were up here all alone

658
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:14,045
practicing dance moves
in your underwear.

659
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:19,254
Stop it.
Stop stop.

660
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:23,675
- Stop it.
- Please don't do it in those.

661
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:25,469
Hey, that reminds me

662
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:27,709
I haven't seen Dad in his underwear
in a long time.

663
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,047
- It is not pretty.
- Is this pretty?

664
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,120
Ma kicked him out of the room
and he's staying with me.

665
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,568
He deserves it.

666
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:36,471
How come you never told us
about him cheating before?

667
00:32:36,512 --> 00:32:38,585
'Cause, Rox, I didn't
see anything.

668
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,242
I caught him with that little Rosa Salgado,
little Pentecostal chick.

669
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:43,353
Dad just gives me $100.

670
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:45,661
He says, "Here,
don't say nothing. "

671
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,964
And you'd think he'd be too old
for that shit now.

672
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,269
Rox, they've got
Viagra now.

673
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:53,402
We're gonna be those kids that have
to shuttle between houses at Christmas.

674
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,097
No, Rox.
No we're not.

675
00:32:55,135 --> 00:32:57,437
- No?
- No, because they're gonna sell this house

676
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:59,326
and they gonna move
into separate apartments.

677
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,497
And we're gonna have to stay in a hotel
when we come into town?

678
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:02,549
No.

679
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:04,479
I know Mauricio and Sarah
wouldn't mind that.

680
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:06,780
- The walls are thin, bro.
- Oh yeah?

681
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:08,953
- Why don't you mind your business?
- Ma's always talking about

682
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,259
moving to Puerto Rico.
She might actually do it now.

683
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:13,302
It'd be kind of sweet
to have a place out there.

684
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:15,229
- Did you just say kinda sweet?
- Yeah.

685
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:18,109
So you're okay with Pops moving into
a studio apartment

686
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:20,051
and heating up leftovers?
You're fine with that?

687
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:21,981
Oh, do you realize
this is probably

688
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:24,118
the last Christmas
that we'll spend together?

689
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:26,132
Why, Rox?
Why is it gonna be the last?

690
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,311
Why don't we do something?
We're gonna let them throw away

691
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,422
36 years of their marriage?
We're just gonna sit and talk about it?

692
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:33,014
He broke her trust!
How can she forgive him for that?

693
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,671
- What don't you understand?
- Yeah, Ma has every right to leave.

694
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:37,814
Hey, do you hear
yourselves?

695
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:39,511
You know what
you sound like?

696
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:41,915
You sound like people
who aren't married.

697
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:44,054
Let me tell you
about marriage, all right?

698
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:46,743
Sometimes you're in it, you feel like you
don't want the same things anymore

699
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,503
and you start going
at each other.

700
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,612
And you go at each other,
but you stick it through.

701
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:52,986
And at the end of that
you fall in love all over again.

702
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,875
Andthat's marriage, okay?

703
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,428
So don't tell me that Mom and Dad,
after all these years,

704
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,021
don't got a little bit of love left for each
other, 'cause I'm not buying that.

705
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:08,533
Preciosos,
I made some pastelillos.

706
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:13,938
Ah. Uh-huh.
You're tired.

707
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:16,467
Why did you have to drag
these boys out of bed?

708
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:18,230
- We're fine, Ma.
- For 25 years,

709
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,754
I've been begging you
to cut down that ugly tree,

710
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:22,223
and all of a sudden
you're gonna do it right now?

711
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:24,371
- Can I help you with that?
- No.

712
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,002
You've still
got it, Mamita.

713
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,254
Dirty old man.

714
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:33,078
Here, how about
some hot chocolate?

715
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,023
- Come on.
- Okay, say thank you.

716
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:37,170
- Thank you.
- Hey, Sarah.

717
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,064
I made some pastelillos.

718
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:41,137
- Have one.
- No, I'm going for a jog.

719
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:44,658
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to fix the treadmill
in the guest room.

720
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:46,071
How is she going
to get pregnant

721
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:47,698
with all that
bouncing up and down?

722
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,111
Enough, all right?
Just leave her alone.

723
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:51,512
Here here here,
eat something.

724
00:34:55,032 --> 00:34:56,974
And what, are you drunk?
Still drunk?

725
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:58,739
- Ma, please.
- I can't believe you spent all night

726
00:34:58,776 --> 00:35:00,182
getting drunk
with your brothers.

727
00:35:00,217 --> 00:35:02,256
She's a bad influence, Ma.

728
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:03,637
Hey, Fernando.

729
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:05,613
You want
some hot chocolate?

730
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:07,892
No thanks.
I'm all set, Mrs. Rodriguez.

731
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:11,792
You're killing me.

732
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:13,391
Yeah!

733
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:16,464
This is an SR36 Wood Boss.

734
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:21,301
Whoa whoa!
No! Stop!

735
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:23,157
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

736
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,092
- What's the problem?
- It's fine.

737
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:28,142
But we're gonna
use mine.

738
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:31,084
This is a Sears
Chainomatic 3000

739
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:32,915
- I remember that.
- Oh, Dad, come on.

740
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,543
Chuck Norris was
on the box.

741
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,208
Everybody, careful.
Stand back.

742
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:38,101
That looks really dangerous.

743
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:40,817
Hmm?

744
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:44,333
You overcompensated a little bit, Dad.

745
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:46,544
- Coño.
- What? What?

746
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:49,745
'Cause he's got a little thingy.

747
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:55,850
- Oh.
- Ooh.

748
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:57,781
Your man sure is good
with his tool, honey.

749
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:00,147
Mm-hmm, and he's really
good with his hands too.

750
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,969
Marissa,
there's a child here.

751
00:36:02,004 --> 00:36:04,012
Please, he's three, Ma.
He doesn't get innuendo.

752
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:12,369
Come on, give it
some force, man.

753
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:16,018
Yo, whoa whoa whoa.

754
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,288
- Step back.
- Show him how it's done, Jesse.

755
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:20,211
- Careful.
- Be careful.

756
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,382
Show him how it's done.

757
00:36:22,419 --> 00:36:24,459
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

758
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,059
Now that's
in innuendo, girl.

759
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,789
I bet my boy Jesse
right there-

760
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:29,420
$20 my boy Jesse gets
that tree down.

761
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,865
I'd take Fernando.

762
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,451
Hey, you back off,
Barbie.

763
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,011
I didn't mean it that way.
It's just that he's big.

764
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,865
His muscles are big.

765
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:40,874
And I-
oh, you guys.

766
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,898
Hey hey hey hey!

767
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,326
Don't hurt
yourself, man.

768
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,606
What happened?
What happened?

769
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,496
It's okay,
tough guy.

770
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:55,628
Let's see it, Nando.
Let's see what you've got.

771
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,902
Holy cow.

772
00:36:57,937 --> 00:36:59,398
- Oh no.
- What the hell?

773
00:36:59,441 --> 00:37:01,579
- It's cursed, Ma!
- Son of a-

774
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:03,210
Syphilitic tree.
Let me try it.

775
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:05,486
- Hold on, hold on.
- Let a real man do it.

776
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:07,081
Oh no.
Stop him, please.

777
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,909
- Oh no, he isn't.
- Oh, boy.

778
00:37:08,945 --> 00:37:11,083
- No, Mo.
- I got it. All right.

779
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:11,982
Back off, Iraq.

780
00:37:12,016 --> 00:37:13,292
Are you gonna put money
down on your husband?

781
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:15,238
That he seriously
hurts himself?

782
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,938
$20. Sure why not?

783
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:19,016
Mauricio!
Put it down.

784
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:21,096
Relax. Relax, Mom.
I've got it.

785
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:23,689
You can do it.
I've got $20 on you.

786
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:25,931
This little-
the black cord?

787
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:28,007
Right there. Right there.
The black cord.

788
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:30,251
Yeah.

789
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:32,675
- You hear that?
- Whoa whoa whoa!

790
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:36,167
Somebody do something!

791
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:39,141
Thank you.
Thank you.

792
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:41,419
- Thanks, Sarah.

793
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:43,494
- Mauricio, put it down!
- Told you.

794
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,476
- Don't yell at me.
- Put it down!

795
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:47,045
- Get in the house!
- I've got it.

796
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:48,842
Put it down.

797
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:51,333
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

798
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:55,494
I told you-
get in the house.

799
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:21,096
Huh?
What do you think?

800
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:24,615
It looks great, Dad.

801
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:27,334
I don't know
what to say.

802
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:31,841
- Come on.
- What?

803
00:38:31,883 --> 00:38:34,218
Find something to do.

804
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:37,120
Oh, my babies!

805
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:44,135
- Oh, my movie star!
- How you doing?

806
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,276
- You look great.
- Thanks.

807
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:49,544
God bless you, baby.
You know, I prayed for you every day.

808
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:51,782
I had to. I know how
the military is.

809
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:55,463
- Yeah.
- Hey, y'all! My baby was on the front line!

810
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:58,215
Figures. They like to cut
the dark meat first,

811
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:00,966
if you know what I'm saying.
I'll tell you what it is.

812
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:03,490
It's Uncle Sam trying
to get rid of y'all Latinos.

813
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,345
You know, they lure you in
promising you citizenship.

814
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:09,128
You don't even have to
have a green card to serve.

815
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:11,496
- Oh, come on, Tina.
- Oh, you know it's true, white boy.

816
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,951
You find everything?

817
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:15,400
Yeah, I'm cool.

818
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:17,091
These high-end magazines
must be your touch,

819
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:18,503
'cause the only thing
my Pops reads

820
00:39:18,537 --> 00:39:20,447
is "The Sun Times"
and "La Opinión. "

821
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:24,100
You want to see
something really cool?

822
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:27,650
Check this out. It's all about what's
happening underground

823
00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:31,037
with music, art, theater-
that kind of stuff.

824
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:33,764
- Mmm.
- You ever think about doing theater?

825
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,207
Yeah, I started
in theater.

826
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,476
But I'm just focused
on film and TV now.

827
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,715
Yeah. You know
what you should do?

828
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,718
- Telenovela.
- Oh, yeah, right.

829
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:45,093
Rogelio,

830
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:46,753
why didn't you tell me
before we slept together

831
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,646
you were once
married to my mother!

832
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,534
Because when you climaxed
and screamed "I love you, Papi,"

833
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,476
- I thought you already knew.
- You watch that?

834
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,428
Y'all gotta pay,
'cause I ain't got money for y'all.

835
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:55,747
That's just crazy.

836
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:05,091
You all right, baby?
Ozzy!

837
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:08,988
- Whoa whoa.
- Ozzy!

838
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,325
- We gotta go.
- What about the beer?

839
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,398
- Come on.
- You okay?

840
00:40:17,317 --> 00:40:19,008
Yeah.

841
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:26,402
These were on sale yesterday.
You missed it.

842
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,228
I see everyone at the store is
still crazy, huh?

843
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,243
Yeah yeah.

844
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:40,994
Look. Your old man
finally modernized.

845
00:40:41,028 --> 00:40:43,678
This new system lets
you know how much you're wasting,

846
00:40:43,715 --> 00:40:45,472
so you can cost
things out better.

847
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:48,671
Last week we took 3¢ off
a pound of pork chops.

848
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,609
- You actually know how to use that thing?
- Not really.

849
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:54,237
Ozzy usually
prints it out,

850
00:40:54,275 --> 00:40:56,959
but I want everything running
like a well-oiled machine

851
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:59,777
for when you take over.
You'll get the hang of this in no time.

852
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,956
And you've always got Ozzy.

853
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,962
So when do you think
you can start?

854
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,905
Uh, look, Dad, I-

855
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:09,085
Look, it'll help you take
your mind off things.

856
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:15,096
- I'm- I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

857
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:20,120
You're barely home,
for Christ's sake.

858
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:26,585
You take- you rest up.
You take your time.

859
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,386
You come to work
when you're ready.

860
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:35,862
Okay.

861
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:46,267
- Yo, Jesse, let's go hang downtown.
- What's up?

862
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,671
I've got a couple of rich honeys waiting
for us down there.

863
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:50,428
- No no, I'm cool, brother.
- Why not?

864
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:52,406
What you mean,
you're cool, man?

865
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:54,336
Come on, bro.

866
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:56,310
I saw the look.

867
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:59,932
What look?

868
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:03,196
Well, don't do it, okay?

869
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:05,118
- What?
- I know Marissa is all cool.

870
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:07,867
She's still fine after
all her baby-mama drama.

871
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:09,627
- Whatever.
- Come on, bro.

872
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:11,671
APuerto Ricanwoman-

873
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:14,231
she's never gonna forgive
that you dropped her, bro.

874
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:16,158
- That you dumped her like that.
- I didn't-

875
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,908
Forget that, all right?
Even if you guys were

876
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:21,211
to get back together,
she's gonna seem nice,

877
00:42:21,246 --> 00:42:23,286
but she gonna make you pay
for that shit every day.

878
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:24,755
They're like that, bro.

879
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:26,041
You don't know what are
you talking about.

880
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,183
What do you mean?
A million years from now

881
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:31,221
aliens could come down,
they resurrect her ass.

882
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:33,595
What's the first thing
she's gonna say?

883
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:35,931
"Where is that
son of a bitch Jesse?"

884
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:38,037
No. We could
be friends, bro.

885
00:42:38,076 --> 00:42:40,084
"We could be friends. "

886
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,322
That's white people shit.

887
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:45,244
- All right, Johnny.
- Come on. Jesse, yo!

888
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:47,186
What?

889
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:52,028
Marissa! Hey!

890
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:53,948
Jesse, what are
you doing here?

891
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:55,803
I remembered you used to
take this path to work.

892
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:58,683
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- No, I'm late for work.

893
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:00,604
- Well, we can walk and talk.
- No no no.

894
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:03,538
I thought that I could
do this friend thing, but I can't.

895
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,067
Five years together
and you break up with me in a letter.

896
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:07,832
You didn't even have
the guts to tell me before you left.

897
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:09,723
You think I knew
what the hell I wanted?

898
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:12,089
I was 23,
claustrophobic,

899
00:43:12,124 --> 00:43:14,066
Mauricio and Roxanna were
off doing their thing.

900
00:43:14,107 --> 00:43:16,147
I just needed
to get out too!

901
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:18,194
I thought all my life's major
questions were answered.

902
00:43:18,235 --> 00:43:20,144
I had you,
I had the bodega.

903
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:22,642
If I was gonna make it,
I had to move on!

904
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,072
- And I knew that you did too.
- You-

905
00:43:25,114 --> 00:43:26,837
you tore my world apart!

906
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:29,078
And there was nothing
that I could do about it.

907
00:43:29,114 --> 00:43:31,317
Believe me, if I had known the way
things were gonna turn out,

908
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:33,776
- I would have never gone.
- I suppose I can't even get mad at you

909
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:36,884
- because you're a goddamn war hero.
- I'm not.

910
00:43:36,922 --> 00:43:38,416
Please.

911
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,139
A guy in my unit died
because of me!

912
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:16,045
My buddy Lenny.

913
00:44:17,432 --> 00:44:19,471
He was this funny kid
from Wisconsin.

914
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:21,366
He always wore

915
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:24,465
his high school basketball jersey
underneath his fatigues.

916
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:28,240
Anyway...

917
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:31,890
we had taken up position
in this abandoned house.

918
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:35,861
Insurgents had left
all this food behind.

919
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:39,190
We were hunkered
in there for the night,

920
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:42,005
so Whitey,
our squad leader,

921
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:43,925
said that he would treat us
to a home-cooked meal.

922
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:47,122
I was on lookout
at the window.

923
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:50,770
Lenny made me
switch with him.

924
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:55,470
I maybe had,
like, three bites

925
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,410
and some asshole launched an RPG
right through the window.

926
00:44:58,453 --> 00:45:00,754
Lenny's-

927
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:03,178
Lenny's body was blown
back to the table.

928
00:45:05,908 --> 00:45:09,071
And do you know
how I felt?

929
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:13,611
I was happy.

930
00:45:13,652 --> 00:45:15,986
I- I was so happy

931
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,678
to be alive.

932
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:19,854
I'm so sorry, Jesse.

933
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:23,187
Yeah.

934
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,292
I was the lucky one.

935
00:45:26,612 --> 00:45:28,466
Yeah.

936
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,039
His poor family.

937
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,153
Have you talked
to them?

938
00:45:35,187 --> 00:45:36,943
No.

939
00:45:36,978 --> 00:45:38,766
It wouldn't make
a difference.

940
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,538
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

941
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,741
He was
their only son.

942
00:45:57,234 --> 00:46:00,233
Ahem.

943
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:01,614
Jesse.

944
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,814
Hey, Father Torres.
Good to see you.

945
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,216
Nice to have you home, son.
Any more soy sauce?

946
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:13,550
Jesse, look.
I've taken it upon myself

947
00:46:13,585 --> 00:46:15,853
to bring Father Torres here
to talk to Mom and Dad.

948
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:18,222
- So just go with it, please. Okay?
- And where's Mom?

949
00:46:18,256 --> 00:46:20,744
She went out for happy hour
with Cheryl and Gladys.

950
00:46:20,784 --> 00:46:22,409
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

951
00:46:22,448 --> 00:46:24,236
She can go if she wants.
She's a grown woman.

952
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:26,638
You know she's gonna
kill you, right?

953
00:46:26,672 --> 00:46:28,330
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
Go sit down.

954
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,789
Okay, everybody,
just- please.

955
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:32,905
Hi, baby.

956
00:46:32,944 --> 00:46:35,529
I'm sorry I embarrassed
you this morning.

957
00:46:35,567 --> 00:46:38,633
It's okay, Mom. I just wanted to tell you
that Father Torres is here.

958
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,612
Ay, Dios mio.
Who died?

959
00:46:40,655 --> 00:46:43,851
Nobody died, Ma.
Before you say no- don't say no-

960
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,253
I brought Father Torres here to talk to
you and Dad about the divorce, okay?

961
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:48,109
- Please, Ma.
- No!

962
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:50,346
You've got to think this through before
you go through with it.

963
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:52,106
- Did he tell you to do this?
- No, Dad had nothing to do with it.

964
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,768
- I'm going upstairs.
- Ma, you're not going anywhere.

965
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:55,465
You're going out there
to talk to Father Torres.

966
00:46:55,502 --> 00:46:56,908
Do you know the mouth
on that man?

967
00:46:56,943 --> 00:46:58,666
The whole neighborhood's
going to know.

968
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:00,295
- This is about your family.
- I didn't make any food.

969
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:01,763
It doesn't matter.
Sarah ordered Chinese food.

970
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:03,529
- She gave him takeout?
- Yes, Ma.

971
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:05,705
Go out there.
Be brave.

972
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:09,670
Father Torres,
so nice to see you.

973
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:11,531
Do you, um...

974
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:14,728
I could fix you some
real food if you'd like.

975
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:17,667
Don't trouble yourself.
I'll be fine with a couple of these eggrolls

976
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,295
and some more coquito.
Your son tells me

977
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,340
that you and Edy are
contemplating divorce.

978
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,584
Oh no no, Father, no.

979
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:26,825
I am getting a divorce.

980
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:29,763
See, my husband
broke his vows

981
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:31,625
and sinned against God.

982
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:33,352
Father, it's Christmas.
How about a little sermon

983
00:47:33,388 --> 00:47:36,234
about Jesus being born
so we can be forgiven for our sins?

984
00:47:36,268 --> 00:47:38,122
I'm not changing my mind.

985
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,628
Now I am sorry, Father,

986
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:44,872
that my son dragged you
all the way out here

987
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:49,184
for takeout because
these women can't cook.

988
00:47:49,227 --> 00:47:51,267
It's the least
I can do.

989
00:47:51,307 --> 00:47:53,030
No wonder I don't
have a grandchild.

990
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:55,303
That's what you can
do for me, Father.

991
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,768
Can I get some more
rum for my coquito?

992
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:59,462
Pray that I will hold

993
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:02,019
- a grandchild before I'm dead.
- Here we go again.

994
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:04,163
Maybe there are reasons why they're
holding back on having children.

995
00:48:04,201 --> 00:48:06,787
He'd rather take care of
a hedge fund than a baby.

996
00:48:06,826 --> 00:48:09,411
- You went crying to your mother?
- I didn't go crying.

997
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,457
- It wasn't really crying.
- Can you blame him?

998
00:48:11,498 --> 00:48:13,440
What did you expect?

999
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:16,231
With all this traveling
and all these hours

1000
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:19,113
with a hedge fund, the only sex
he'll be having is on the phone.

1001
00:48:19,145 --> 00:48:21,120
Oh, no no.

1002
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:23,016
He'll be lucky
if he gets that.

1003
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,496
You know,
the only reason

1004
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,292
that he wants a baby now

1005
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:30,816
is so that he can try
to one-up Jesse

1006
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:33,093
in pleasing you
and Edyberto.

1007
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:35,299
- What the hell's she talking about?
- That's not true, Sarah.

1008
00:48:35,336 --> 00:48:37,343
- Yes it is.
- You take one psych course at Brandeis

1009
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:40,101
- and you're Sigmund Freud?
- Excuse us, Father.

1010
00:48:40,135 --> 00:48:42,557
Anna, Edy, perhaps you should
think about the family.

1011
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,941
- We'd be fine.
- No we wouldn't be fine.

1012
00:48:43,976 --> 00:48:45,982
You'd still have your
mommy to run home to.

1013
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,966
Look, daddy's girl,
I know for a fact I'm not the only one

1014
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:49,250
you call when you're
strapped for cash.

1015
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:50,848
She needed money
for head shots.

1016
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:52,447
You sent her money
behind my back?

1017
00:48:52,487 --> 00:48:54,374
- Don't talk to me anymore.
- Do you see?

1018
00:48:54,407 --> 00:48:57,440
Do you see the lies
that I have to put up with, Father?

1019
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:01,537
What does Roxanna need
money for a head shot for?

1020
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:03,964
- She's a star.
- Ma, I'm not a star.

1021
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:05,697
Okay?
I'm not a star. That's it.

1022
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,938
Everybody thinks I live this
glamorous life in Hollywood

1023
00:49:07,974 --> 00:49:10,527
when I can barely pay
my rent on a dumpy studio

1024
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:13,054
and the payments
on a 1999 Kia.

1025
00:49:15,014 --> 00:49:17,119
- What?
- God!

1026
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:19,165
You know what?
I just wish I could have my life

1027
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,889
handed to me on a silver platter
like Jesse over here.

1028
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:23,998
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Yeah.

1029
00:49:24,037 --> 00:49:26,209
The prodigal son returns and the rest
of us just get pushed to the side

1030
00:49:26,246 --> 00:49:28,450
'cause the little prince is here.
Everything for the little prince.

1031
00:49:28,485 --> 00:49:30,786
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think, Jesse.

1032
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,382
Why don't one of you come home
and take care of the bodega?

1033
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:33,915
Can we all
just calm down?

1034
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:36,706
Because you're off living
your own lives, right?

1035
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:38,464
What about my life?

1036
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,297
I try to get out and do I
end up in New York or LA?

1037
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:43,769
No, I end up in Iraq.

1038
00:49:43,812 --> 00:49:45,699
And what do I got
to show for it?

1039
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,700
And you think I can just
come home and run the bodega?

1040
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,489
- Bodegas are good businesses.
- I'm not gonna run the bodega!

1041
00:49:51,523 --> 00:49:53,378
And that's the voice of God,
ladies and gentlemen.

1042
00:49:53,412 --> 00:49:55,516
- Maybe we should say a prayer.
- Shut up!

1043
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,794
So what are you
gonna do?

1044
00:50:04,324 --> 00:50:06,745
I'm gonna-

1045
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,240
I'm gonna go back
to Iraq.

1046
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:14,233
I'm gonna sign up
for another tour.

1047
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:18,748
- Mijo, that's not gonna change anything.
- Maybe.

1048
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:23,835
But at least there I feel
like I have some purpose.

1049
00:50:23,874 --> 00:50:26,013
- Jesse.
- No.

1050
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,991
No no no no.

1051
00:50:34,754 --> 00:50:37,536
I just wish we hadn't let him

1052
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:39,641
sign up
in the first place.

1053
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,096
There are a lot of things
I wish I hadn't done.

1054
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:45,439
Well, you can't take
them back now, can you?

1055
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:48,439
What's done is done.

1056
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:50,684
Where's Mauricio?

1057
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:52,925
Look, I'm sorry
about what I said.

1058
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,967
I do want
to have a baby.

1059
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:58,041
I just don't understand why
it has to be this second,

1060
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,568
when I've got this
huge opportunity.

1061
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:03,902
I'm not stupid.
I understand that I can't have it all.

1062
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,357
That at 36, my fertility

1063
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:09,017
is going into a freefall

1064
00:51:09,055 --> 00:51:10,998
and that I may have
to use the eggs

1065
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:12,762
of some attractive
Ivy League student

1066
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:14,871
who wants to get ahead
on paying off their student loans.

1067
00:51:14,912 --> 00:51:18,206
Look, I'd be happy to adopt.

1068
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,436
But Mauricio being a Latin
doesn't feel the same way.

1069
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:26,130
I promise we will
have children.

1070
00:51:26,174 --> 00:51:28,891
It may not be this second,

1071
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:31,446
but we will someday,
okay?

1072
00:51:33,246 --> 00:51:35,864
That doesn't make you
feel any better?

1073
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:40,275
Jesse's going to sign up
for another tour in Iraq.

1074
00:51:47,613 --> 00:51:49,621
I'm so sorry.

1075
00:51:53,117 --> 00:51:54,710
Mauricio and the kids
went down to Julio's Bar.

1076
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:56,636
You want me to drive
you down there?

1077
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:14,769
This music is beautiful.

1078
00:52:14,811 --> 00:52:17,267
Anna and I, we danced
the first time we met to this song.

1079
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:20,948
Mauricio was conceived
to this song.

1080
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:23,158
Okay, I don't think I needed
to hear all that.

1081
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:35,669
In the glove compartment,
there's medicine.

1082
00:52:42,394 --> 00:52:45,077
- Which one?
- The green cap.

1083
00:52:45,113 --> 00:52:47,480
Here.

1084
00:53:02,265 --> 00:53:04,468
Don't tell anyone, Sarah.

1085
00:53:04,505 --> 00:53:06,195
Please.

1086
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:14,321
Does Anna know?

1087
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,524
I just want to enjoy
Christmas with my family.

1088
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,406
Not that they
make it so easy.

1089
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:34,449
I love you guys so much.

1090
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:36,690
- I love you too, Sarah.
- I do.

1091
00:53:36,726 --> 00:53:39,115
- We love you too, baby. It's okay.
- Let's dance.

1092
00:53:39,158 --> 00:53:41,547
- No, I don't want to-
- Get a room.

1093
00:53:41,591 --> 00:53:43,565
Come on.
Come on.

1094
00:53:43,606 --> 00:53:46,770
All right.
I don't need to be here.

1095
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,431
I think he slipped
her a hit of E.

1096
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,444
- Think he wants a kid that bad?
- Yeah.

1097
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:53,388
All you got to do is look at a Puerto Rican
girl to get her pregnant.

1098
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:55,600
- Shut up.
- Come on, come on.

1099
00:53:55,638 --> 00:53:58,005
- Whoo-hoo.
- Mira.

1100
00:53:58,037 --> 00:54:00,044
This is what a real women
looks like with a burka.

1101
00:54:00,085 --> 00:54:01,908
Right? You go, lady.
Come on, you go now.

1102
00:54:01,941 --> 00:54:03,403
Wrap our soldier boy
over there

1103
00:54:03,445 --> 00:54:05,038
with some red, white
and blue love.

1104
00:54:05,077 --> 00:54:07,662
Your friend here says you
got shot up pretty bad.

1105
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:09,589
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
They shot off his dick.

1106
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,555
But then they replaced
it with a bionic one

1107
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:14,768
and he could jack up a car
and change the tire

1108
00:54:14,804 --> 00:54:16,463
at the same time.

1109
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:18,388
Really?

1110
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,393
I'm just kidding.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1111
00:54:24,436 --> 00:54:27,086
He's still got all his factory parts,
right, Papi?

1112
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:28,879
So you wanna dance?

1113
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,606
Jesse, don't you dare. Jesse.

1114
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:32,716
- I'm- I'm cool.
- Come on, bro.

1115
00:54:32,755 --> 00:54:35,603
- Go, man, go.
- He's cool.

1116
00:54:35,635 --> 00:54:37,578
You heard him,
he's cool.

1117
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,205
Oh no.

1118
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:43,505
That's my song.
That's my song, y'all.

1119
00:54:43,538 --> 00:54:45,905
- Yo, that's my song.
- Oh no.

1120
00:54:45,938 --> 00:54:49,353
Oh, yes.
Go get 'em, Mo.

1121
00:54:59,153 --> 00:55:00,942
Come on.
Come on.

1122
00:55:00,978 --> 00:55:04,686
Oh, he likes that.

1123
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:07,339
Come on, Mo.
Yeah!

1124
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:10,989
You got moves.
You go, boy, yeah!

1125
00:55:13,425 --> 00:55:15,945
Go Mo. Go Mo.

1126
00:55:19,377 --> 00:55:21,548
- Oh!
- Oh!

1127
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,618
Go Mo.
Go Mo.

1128
00:55:28,656 --> 00:55:31,819
Oh!

1129
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,547
- Ay yi yi yi yi...
- Whoo!

1130
00:55:39,279 --> 00:55:41,352
God, it feels good
to be back.

1131
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:43,300
- Help me, Sarah.
- That was great.

1132
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:46,377
My coccyx.
I broke my coccyx.

1133
00:55:46,415 --> 00:55:49,382
All I'm asking is
if a shot is $5,

1134
00:55:49,423 --> 00:55:51,430
- how much for a sip?
- A sip?

1135
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:53,860
Yeah, a sip.
Just a half a shot maybe.

1136
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:56,423
Can you please take
that thing down?

1137
00:55:56,462 --> 00:55:58,829
Why? You the biggest star
to come out of this neighborhood.

1138
00:55:58,863 --> 00:56:00,772
Can I buy you a round?

1139
00:56:00,814 --> 00:56:03,781
Wow. I can't believe it.
You guys are gonna pay for something?

1140
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:05,643
I'm only cheap
when it comes to me.

1141
00:56:05,678 --> 00:56:07,434
- How much is her drink?
- $8.

1142
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,574
- What if she doesn't drink all of it?
- Never mind.

1143
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:11,916
Could I please have some
change for the jukebox?

1144
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,738
Thanks.

1145
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:18,502
Is there something
you want to tell me?

1146
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,428
No.

1147
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,468
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- About?

1148
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:24,615
Ozzy.

1149
00:56:24,653 --> 00:56:27,500
Come on, you have to admit
he's really hot.

1150
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:29,060
He's a thug.

1151
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:31,140
No, he hasn't been messed up
in that shit for a while.

1152
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,456
Yeah, well, we'll see
how long that lasts.

1153
00:56:32,493 --> 00:56:34,380
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

1154
00:56:34,412 --> 00:56:36,900
Just seeing Alexis again
made me remember how bad things got.

1155
00:56:39,372 --> 00:56:41,282
My agent.

1156
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,923
- They called.
- And?

1157
00:56:46,956 --> 00:56:48,865
Roger rushed off
to his anger management class

1158
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:51,079
- and didn't say anything.
- Is that it?

1159
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:53,700
You told me to call
you if I heard anything.

1160
00:56:53,738 --> 00:56:56,194
Well, you know, maybe they
called about something else.

1161
00:56:56,235 --> 00:56:58,536
Or maybe they just didn't want
to ruin my Christmas.

1162
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:00,873
Please. All right look, girl,
I've got to jump.

1163
00:57:00,907 --> 00:57:03,078
- I'll hit you later.
- Wait.

1164
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:05,155
Bye.

1165
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:08,358
This ain't Cali, girl. They ain't gonna arrest
you for smoking inside.

1166
00:57:08,394 --> 00:57:10,434
I had to use the phone.

1167
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:12,361
- Want to go for a walk?
- No.

1168
00:57:12,394 --> 00:57:13,855
I don't want
to leave my girl.

1169
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:16,287
- Oh, really?
- Really.

1170
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,784
Maybe we should give
'em some space.

1171
00:57:19,977 --> 00:57:22,050
Come on, let's go.

1172
00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:24,129
- Come on.
- I don't know.

1173
00:57:24,169 --> 00:57:26,340
Cabby!

1174
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:38,948
Someplace a little more quiet.

1175
00:57:38,985 --> 00:57:40,894
Come on, I just want
to talk to you.

1176
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,911
Hola, mi amor.

1177
00:57:42,952 --> 00:57:44,861
Hey.

1178
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,256
- Jesse.
- Hey.

1179
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:50,751
Can I buy
you guys a drink?

1180
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:53,377
- I'm cool.
- No.

1181
00:57:56,808 --> 00:57:59,327
So why did it take you
three years to come back?

1182
00:57:59,366 --> 00:58:02,116
God, I've just been
crazy busy, you know?

1183
00:58:02,151 --> 00:58:04,736
If it's not one thing,
it's something else.

1184
00:58:04,775 --> 00:58:08,069
Shit, who am I kidding?

1185
00:58:08,103 --> 00:58:10,656
I'm sure
you've heard everything.

1186
00:58:10,694 --> 00:58:13,028
You'll catch a break.
You just-

1187
00:58:13,062 --> 00:58:14,524
you just got
to hang in there.

1188
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:16,127
Caught a break.

1189
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:18,751
What if I'm waiting
on something that never happens?

1190
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,252
How much more time
should I waste?

1191
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:22,333
A year?
Two? 10?

1192
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:26,148
Stuck in the same place while everybody
else's life is moving forward.

1193
00:58:26,182 --> 00:58:27,872
So what are you gonna do?
Move back?

1194
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,798
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.

1195
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,804
That wouldn't be
the worst thing, right?

1196
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,930
I never thought I'd hear
that coming from you.

1197
00:58:36,964 --> 00:58:39,714
I'm 29 years old

1198
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,301
and I'm sick and tired of someone else
deciding my fate

1199
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:45,472
when I'm just as good
if not better

1200
00:58:45,508 --> 00:58:47,134
than most of the actresses
out there.

1201
00:58:47,172 --> 00:58:49,376
- They don't know me.
- You are good.

1202
00:58:49,413 --> 00:58:52,282
Like that time that you played
that homeless chick in "One Way Ticket. "

1203
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:54,298
- You saw that?
- Are you kidding?

1204
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,445
You killed it.
You're like the Puerto Rican Meryl Streep.

1205
00:58:56,484 --> 00:58:57,945
Yeah, right.

1206
00:58:57,988 --> 00:59:00,507
Your parents made us watch
the DVD like five times.

1207
00:59:00,548 --> 00:59:02,555
- Of course they did.
- Yeah.

1208
00:59:05,603 --> 00:59:07,774
Look, don't tell
anybody what I said.

1209
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:10,845
All right?
I'm all over the place right now.

1210
00:59:12,163 --> 00:59:14,367
I'll think about it.

1211
00:59:16,259 --> 00:59:18,201
You'll think about it?

1212
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:21,057
- Don't make me kick your ass.
- You got to catch me.

1213
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,814
- Kick my ass.
- Don't make-

1214
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,665
- Kick my ass. What?
- I will kick your ass.

1215
00:59:25,698 --> 00:59:28,993
Why are you running?
Why are you running?

1216
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,522
We didn't use protection.

1217
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:54,009
Nope. You said you wanted
to make a baby.

1218
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,089
I was completely loaded.

1219
00:59:56,128 --> 00:59:58,135
In vino veritas.

1220
00:59:58,176 --> 01:00:00,031
Oh, really?
Oh, really?

1221
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:02,367
And I probably told the bartender
he looked like George Clooney.

1222
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,505
Mm-hmm.
Among other things.

1223
01:00:04,544 --> 01:00:06,649
What's the date?
What's the date?

1224
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:08,760
What is the date?

1225
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,971
It's Christmas Eve,
December 24th.

1226
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:14,171
Okay, that public library
event, I had my period.

1227
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:16,117
- What are you doing?
- That's 19 days.

1228
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:18,264
Okay, I'm okay.
We're okay.

1229
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,402
I think we're okay.
I hope we're okay.

1230
01:00:21,439 --> 01:00:24,057
Mauricio, how could you take
advantage of me like that?

1231
01:00:24,095 --> 01:00:25,523
I didn't take
advantage of you.

1232
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:27,476
- You took advantage of me.
- Oh!

1233
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:29,558
You don't want to make
a baby anymore?

1234
01:00:29,598 --> 01:00:31,606
Oh, well, I just think
it's something

1235
01:00:31,646 --> 01:00:34,035
that we should be discussing
while I'm sober.

1236
01:00:34,078 --> 01:00:36,053
Okay, all right, all right.
You're sober now.

1237
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:37,981
Let's discuss this.

1238
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:40,118
Do you or don't you want
to make a baby with me?

1239
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:42,524
I don't-
I don't want to talk about this.

1240
01:00:42,558 --> 01:00:44,728
I feel like shit.

1241
01:00:44,765 --> 01:00:46,653
Oh my God.

1242
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:49,075
The colors in this room
are inducing a migraine.

1243
01:00:49,118 --> 01:00:51,451
Does that mean we're not
gonna try again?

1244
01:00:51,486 --> 01:00:53,852
Oh, eat me.

1245
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,689
Don't even
think about it.

1246
01:01:04,316 --> 01:01:06,804
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1247
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:10,740
Oh, you got moves.

1248
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:13,430
No bad.
Now you spin.

1249
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,907
Coquito, ladies?

1250
01:01:24,124 --> 01:01:26,098
Ozzy.

1251
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:28,375
Ozzy, gracia, amigo.

1252
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:30,321
Thank you, Edy.

1253
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:35,896
- Uli, Uli. Feliz Navidad.
- Thank you.

1254
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:38,036
Tina.

1255
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:41,206
Hello? Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

1256
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:43,151
- Come on, baby.
- No.

1257
01:01:43,194 --> 01:01:45,016
- Coquito?
- Oh no.

1258
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,993
- You think I don't know?
- Know what?

1259
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,488
That every year your father gets me drunk
at the Christmas party

1260
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,767
so I don't notice
how light my envelope is.

1261
01:01:51,802 --> 01:01:54,998
- Come on.
- Huh-uh, not gonna have any of that stuff

1262
01:01:55,034 --> 01:01:57,521
until I see the size
of my Christmas bonus.

1263
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:59,470
All right.
Okay.

1264
01:01:59,513 --> 01:02:01,203
Not gonna trick me again.

1265
01:02:11,577 --> 01:02:13,682
Dad.

1266
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,727
The rest of the checks.

1267
01:02:15,768 --> 01:02:18,157
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

1268
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:19,607
Go. You go.

1269
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,167
Go hang out with
Johnny or something.

1270
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:22,768
Don't feel like you've got
to stick around here.

1271
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:25,655
Dad, look, I know you're not
happy about me going back.

1272
01:02:25,687 --> 01:02:27,891
Of course I'm not.

1273
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,884
Jesse, I'm your father.
I want you safe.

1274
01:02:32,919 --> 01:02:34,642
I want you here.

1275
01:02:36,439 --> 01:02:39,089
I'm sorry.

1276
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:41,461
How can I make
you understand?

1277
01:02:41,494 --> 01:02:44,593
You can't.
Just like I can't make you stay.

1278
01:02:49,526 --> 01:02:52,592
There's a point when all a father can do
is just get out of the way.

1279
01:02:56,758 --> 01:02:58,962
Thanks, Dad.

1280
01:03:07,477 --> 01:03:09,168
I'd better give
Tina her check.

1281
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:10,667
Otherwise she's gonna
start the revolution.

1282
01:03:13,844 --> 01:03:15,568
Any word?

1283
01:03:15,605 --> 01:03:17,645
No, I'm just texting
my girl.

1284
01:03:17,685 --> 01:03:19,146
What are you telling her?

1285
01:03:19,189 --> 01:03:21,327
How much you had last night
in the fine city of Chicago?

1286
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,811
No, I'm telling her how
freaking freezing it is here.

1287
01:03:24,852 --> 01:03:27,089
Cali had made you
all soft, girl.

1288
01:03:27,124 --> 01:03:29,774
You move back here,
you'll be wearing hot pants in this weather.

1289
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:32,267
Yeah, well, hopefully
I'll get this show.

1290
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,096
Yeah, I hope so.

1291
01:03:34,132 --> 01:03:36,205
Hey, I had a really
good time last night.

1292
01:03:36,244 --> 01:03:38,665
- Great time last night.
- Me too.

1293
01:03:38,707 --> 01:03:40,234
Really good time.

1294
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:41,966
But I just don't want you
to get the wrong impression.

1295
01:03:42,003 --> 01:03:45,713
Nah, come on.
You're like a sister to me.

1296
01:03:45,747 --> 01:03:47,406
Yeah, that's what I told
Jesse this morning.

1297
01:03:47,443 --> 01:03:49,810
That you're like a brother
and it's just weird.

1298
01:03:49,843 --> 01:03:51,599
Don't even worry about it.

1299
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:54,187
- I'm gonna grab a drink.
- Okay.

1300
01:03:54,227 --> 01:03:56,299
I'll see you later?

1301
01:03:58,515 --> 01:04:00,075
Okay.

1302
01:04:09,586 --> 01:04:12,433
Mira eso.

1303
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:15,215
Sarah, you've been practicing
for the parranda.

1304
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,348
I'm trying. I didn't exactly grow up
singing Christmas carols.

1305
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:20,654
No, you're doing great.

1306
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:22,729
I can't tell you
what this means to me.

1307
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:25,704
I look forward to
the parranda all year.

1308
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:28,166
You must be
looking for this.

1309
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,280
Thank you.

1310
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,833
Listen, thank you
for keeping my secret.

1311
01:04:33,872 --> 01:04:35,879
Look, Edyberto,

1312
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,790
I really appreciate
your trust in me.

1313
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:41,996
Who else can I trust? You're the only one
who's not Puerto Rican in this house.

1314
01:04:42,032 --> 01:04:44,879
But I really think
you need to tell them.

1315
01:04:44,912 --> 01:04:47,115
I'll tell them soon enough.

1316
01:04:47,151 --> 01:04:49,540
Life is short, Sarah.

1317
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:52,430
I don't want anything to get in the way
of them having a good time.

1318
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:54,950
- You understand?
- Pop, where are the mitten warmers?

1319
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:56,649
Yeah, coming.

1320
01:04:56,687 --> 01:04:58,596
No no no no no.

1321
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:01,027
- Keep practicing.
- Mm-hmm.

1322
01:05:08,846 --> 01:05:10,569
Guys, come on. Hurry up.

1323
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:13,126
Vamos pa' la parranda.

1324
01:05:13,165 --> 01:05:15,434
Here we go.
Here we go.

1325
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:19,212
Anna, Roxanna,
vámonos.

1326
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:28,267
- There they go.
- # The first noel... #

1327
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:33,058
- Merry Christmas.
- # The angels did say #

1328
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:37,857
# Was to certain
poor shepherds #

1329
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,276
# In fields
where they lay #

1330
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:46,593
- # Noel, noel... #
- La parranda!

1331
01:05:46,636 --> 01:05:52,233
# Noel, noel #

1332
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:55,911
# Born isthe king #

1333
01:05:55,947 --> 01:05:58,664
# Of Israel. #

1334
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:06,785
# Come all ye faithful #

1335
01:06:06,827 --> 01:06:11,136
# Joyful and triumphant #

1336
01:06:11,178 --> 01:06:16,066
# O come ye #

1337
01:06:16,107 --> 01:06:20,514
#To Bethlehem#

1338
01:06:20,555 --> 01:06:25,224
#Come and behold him#

1339
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:29,512
# Born the king
of angels #

1340
01:06:29,546 --> 01:06:34,183
# O come let us
adore him #

1341
01:06:34,217 --> 01:06:38,526
# O come
let us adore him... #

1342
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:41,670
Ozzy, come on.

1343
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,203
Come on.

1344
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,669
They're over here.
Give me the baby.

1345
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:50,086
- Come on.
- They're right there.

1346
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:55,270
# O come
all ye faithful #

1347
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:59,559
# Joyful and triumphant #

1348
01:06:59,592 --> 01:07:04,642
# O come
all ye faithful #

1349
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:08,836
# Joyful and triumphant #

1350
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:13,857
# O come all ye faithful #

1351
01:07:13,895 --> 01:07:17,724
# Joyful and triumphant... #

1352
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:46,307
# Joyful and triumphant. #

1353
01:08:49,634 --> 01:08:52,448
- Have you seen your brother?
- Yeah, he's over there.

1354
01:08:55,393 --> 01:08:57,149
Why aren't
you two dancing?

1355
01:08:57,184 --> 01:08:58,613
And compete with them?

1356
01:09:03,328 --> 01:09:06,590
Excuse me.

1357
01:09:06,624 --> 01:09:08,991
Where did you get these earrings?
I want to get a pair for Gladys.

1358
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:11,129
- They're beautiful.
- Okay, you know the-

1359
01:09:11,168 --> 01:09:13,306
What's going on?

1360
01:09:13,345 --> 01:09:15,832
We're going
to midnight mass.

1361
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:19,133
Hey, Edy.
I see you've met my new novio.

1362
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,054
Tony.

1363
01:09:21,087 --> 01:09:23,061
A pleasure.

1364
01:09:23,102 --> 01:09:25,110
- You coming to church?
- Please.

1365
01:09:25,151 --> 01:09:28,053
He hasn't been to midnight
mass in over 20 years.

1366
01:09:28,095 --> 01:09:30,266
- I'd love to come.
- Great.

1367
01:09:30,303 --> 01:09:32,278
Vámonos.

1368
01:09:35,423 --> 01:09:38,140
Roxanna.
Roxanna.

1369
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,636
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye.

1370
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:47,513
Yo, say thanks, baby.

1371
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,689
Come on, Rox.
What you got, baby?

1372
01:10:14,013 --> 01:10:16,117
So you still got
some moves, huh?

1373
01:10:17,723 --> 01:10:19,349
Depends on who
my partner is.

1374
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,921
I'm sure you say that to
all the boys on the base.

1375
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,063
- Stay away from my girl.
- We were just dancing.

1376
01:10:33,019 --> 01:10:35,386
Go get Ozzy.
Go get Ozzy.

1377
01:10:35,418 --> 01:10:37,622
Hey hey hey!

1378
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:40,081
- You seen Ozzy?
- No, Mama, I ain't seen him.

1379
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:42,293
Oh shit!

1380
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:46,706
Ma.

1381
01:10:46,746 --> 01:10:48,503
You got to pick up
the pace, Ma.

1382
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:50,643
I'm trying.
You got to be patient.

1383
01:10:50,682 --> 01:10:53,333
I can't wait for the sopadito
you're gonna cook for me upstairs.

1384
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:55,923
We can have a party, you and me.
After all, it's Christmas.

1385
01:10:55,961 --> 01:10:58,449
You should apply
at the post office.

1386
01:10:58,489 --> 01:11:00,726
They hire extra people
at the holidays.

1387
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:03,379
No, I will.
I'll do that on Monday. Okay, Mom?

1388
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:06,319
I hope so.

1389
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,565
Oh, merry Christmas.

1390
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:10,488
Hey, Ma, you go
inside, okay?

1391
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:12,528
Start that sopadito.
I got to talk to my boy here.

1392
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:14,129
You sure?
You want to come in now?

1393
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,503
No no, he's busy.
He's a busy guy.

1394
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,498
Can't let you kill me
in front of my mom, man.

1395
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,400
So you know why I'm here?

1396
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:36,148
I guess it's payback time.

1397
01:11:36,183 --> 01:11:37,492
I'm ready, man.

1398
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:39,699
I had 10 years
to be ready.

1399
01:11:39,735 --> 01:11:42,256
Let's go.

1400
01:11:53,847 --> 01:11:55,756
He was like a father
and mother to me.

1401
01:11:55,798 --> 01:11:59,246
It was either him or me, man.
It could have gone either way.

1402
01:11:59,286 --> 01:12:01,141
He was all I had.

1403
01:12:01,174 --> 01:12:03,760
I got nothing.

1404
01:12:03,798 --> 01:12:06,285
I got nothing!

1405
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,562
Do what you got
to do, brother.

1406
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:51,243
Come on.

1407
01:12:54,323 --> 01:12:56,811
- That you calling?
- Yeah, what the hell?

1408
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:59,240
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1409
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:32,394
- You must be cold.
- I'm fine.

1410
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:07,368
How could you do it?

1411
01:14:07,407 --> 01:14:09,675
Anna, you're the only woman
I've ever loved.

1412
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:13,540
And Suzy Lee?
You think I don't know her name?

1413
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,967
There'll be plenty of time to discuss this
after the holidays.

1414
01:14:21,006 --> 01:14:24,650
I just want us
to enjoy the kids.

1415
01:14:24,685 --> 01:14:27,369
Enjoy Christmas.

1416
01:14:31,756 --> 01:14:34,473
Afterthe kidsaregone,

1417
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:38,154
you and I have nothing
left to say to each other.

1418
01:15:04,651 --> 01:15:06,407
You can't focus.

1419
01:15:06,443 --> 01:15:08,450
I got this.

1420
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:11,364
- A little of this.
- You're gonna get caught.

1421
01:15:11,403 --> 01:15:13,923
You'd better be careful.
Oh oh, oh-oh.

1422
01:15:13,963 --> 01:15:15,970
What's going on?
Heard you got into a fight with Fernando.

1423
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:18,912
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- Fess up.

1424
01:15:18,954 --> 01:15:21,410
Well, when you love a woman you've got
to do anything for her, right?

1425
01:15:21,451 --> 01:15:23,360
I guess so.

1426
01:15:23,402 --> 01:15:24,994
Mauricio knows what
I'm talking about.

1427
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:27,751
Never lose
that feeling, mijo.

1428
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,888
You know how I got this?

1429
01:15:30,921 --> 01:15:32,350
Let me take a wild guess.

1430
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:35,012
Yeah, why don't you just
take a stab in the dark?

1431
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:38,148
Wrestling Manuel Santos
on the pier at Ponce.

1432
01:15:38,185 --> 01:15:41,283
- He was the featherweight...
- ... champion of the world.

1433
01:15:41,321 --> 01:15:44,669
You laugh, you laugh.
The point is I never let him steal my girl.

1434
01:15:44,712 --> 01:15:47,101
- Never let him steal my girl.
- I'm proud of you.

1435
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:53,094
Now I can't even
take down a goddamn tree

1436
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:55,071
to give your mother a view.

1437
01:15:55,112 --> 01:15:58,079
We should just go out
there ourselves and take that tree down.

1438
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,640
Let's go take
that tree down now.

1439
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:02,403
Great idea.
Let's do it, Pop.

1440
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:03,748
I've got some chains
in the basement.

1441
01:16:03,784 --> 01:16:06,053
Wrap them around,
tie them up to the car.

1442
01:16:06,088 --> 01:16:08,389
- Come on.
- Come on, get up.

1443
01:16:12,711 --> 01:16:14,751
You good?
All right, Pop.

1444
01:16:14,791 --> 01:16:17,093
- We're all good.
- Let me know when it's tight.

1445
01:16:17,127 --> 01:16:19,015
- Okay.
- Pedal to the metal. Come on.

1446
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:21,022
Go go go go.

1447
01:16:21,063 --> 01:16:24,379
Go go go go.
Hey hey hey!

1448
01:16:24,422 --> 01:16:27,554
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Stop stop.

1449
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:30,046
What are you doing?

1450
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,061
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

1451
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:34,556
- Sure you don't want me to drive?
- No, I got it.

1452
01:16:34,598 --> 01:16:37,631
I can't wait to see your mother's face
in the morning when she sees this.

1453
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:40,517
Mom's gonna freak.

1454
01:16:43,301 --> 01:16:46,466
Keep going. Go go go.

1455
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,315
- That's it, that's it.
- Come on, Pop.

1456
01:16:49,349 --> 01:16:51,203
- Keep going.
- A little more.

1457
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:53,954
- You got nothing, man.
- Come on, Dad.

1458
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:56,607
You're looking good.
Go!

1459
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,874
- Go go go go!
- Go!

1460
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:08,834
Dad! Dad!

1461
01:17:08,868 --> 01:17:11,257
You could've been killed.
What were you thinking?

1462
01:17:11,299 --> 01:17:13,242
You wanted a view.
I was gonna give you a view.

1463
01:17:13,284 --> 01:17:14,909
Sorry, Mom, I shouldn't
have helped him.

1464
01:17:14,948 --> 01:17:16,835
I helped too. You got to take blame
for everything as well?

1465
01:17:16,867 --> 01:17:18,525
Don't listen to them.
I would've done it without them.

1466
01:17:18,564 --> 01:17:19,993
And I still will.
You watch me.

1467
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,108
You better make sure you
get his head checked.

1468
01:17:22,148 --> 01:17:24,384
This is his medicine.

1469
01:17:24,419 --> 01:17:26,753
They might need this.

1470
01:18:06,176 --> 01:18:08,794
Ma!

1471
01:18:08,832 --> 01:18:11,385
- What happened?
- Is Dad okay?

1472
01:18:12,864 --> 01:18:15,385
Sit down.
All of you, please.

1473
01:18:19,776 --> 01:18:21,783
He didn't seem that
banged up, Mom, come on.

1474
01:18:21,824 --> 01:18:23,034
What is it?
Just say it.

1475
01:18:23,071 --> 01:18:24,413
I hate when you do this.
Just say it.

1476
01:18:26,431 --> 01:18:28,503
Your father has cancer.

1477
01:18:32,095 --> 01:18:34,299
What?

1478
01:18:35,582 --> 01:18:38,452
And here I was
going to leave him.

1479
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:48,981
God's punishing me.

1480
01:18:52,222 --> 01:18:54,742
- They called his doctor in.
- Doctor?

1481
01:18:56,382 --> 01:18:58,454
So he knew?

1482
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:04,152
How did he
keep this from us?

1483
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:07,222
I don't know.

1484
01:19:07,261 --> 01:19:08,951
Me.

1485
01:19:14,621 --> 01:19:18,068
Hey, Uncle Edy, that tree looked a whole
lot worse than you did.

1486
01:19:18,109 --> 01:19:20,345
But it didn't go down,
so you better not go down.

1487
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,558
- Oh, hi, Suzy Lee.
- Hey, Edy.

1488
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:28,629
I'm Dr. Lee,
your dad's oncologist.

1489
01:19:28,668 --> 01:19:30,457
It's nice to finally
meet you all.

1490
01:19:30,491 --> 01:19:32,596
He's told me so many
great things about you.

1491
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:34,578
We just want to know
the prognosis.

1492
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:38,198
- Has he metastasized?
- Has he started chemo?

1493
01:19:38,235 --> 01:19:41,583
I know you've got a million questions
and I am more than happy to answer them.

1494
01:19:41,627 --> 01:19:44,529
I think your dad
needs some rest.

1495
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:47,157
Why don't we meet
down in the cafeteria in about 20 minutes?

1496
01:19:47,195 --> 01:19:49,104
I'm Anna,
his wife.

1497
01:19:49,146 --> 01:19:50,903
Of course, Anna.
It's good to meet you.

1498
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:52,848
- We'll talk in a few minutes.
- Okay.

1499
01:19:55,578 --> 01:19:57,879
She seems nice.

1500
01:19:57,914 --> 01:19:59,889
She's a gynecologist?

1501
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:02,386
- Johnny.
- I'm just kidding. Come on.

1502
01:20:05,785 --> 01:20:08,022
Give me a few moments
with your mother.

1503
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:10,097
Yeah.

1504
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:15,664
Hey, let's go.

1505
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:19,061
Papi!

1506
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:20,754
Ay, mijo.

1507
01:20:20,793 --> 01:20:22,702
It's okay.
It's okay.

1508
01:20:25,945 --> 01:20:28,977
It's okay.
Go on.

1509
01:20:36,887 --> 01:20:38,447
Mi amor.

1510
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,866
Estúpido.

1511
01:20:46,903 --> 01:20:49,358
Why didn't you tell me?

1512
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:54,222
I wanted us to enjoy
the time we have.

1513
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:02,292
How do you think
it's enjoyable

1514
01:21:02,327 --> 01:21:05,174
for me to think
you're with another woman?

1515
01:21:05,206 --> 01:21:07,476
I'm sorry.

1516
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:10,673
But when you started going
on about the divorce,

1517
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:13,361
I thought, maybe this
is a good thing.

1518
01:21:15,094 --> 01:21:16,654
Maybe this way
she'll know

1519
01:21:16,693 --> 01:21:19,060
that she can be happy
when I'm not around.

1520
01:21:19,093 --> 01:21:21,581
You silly man.

1521
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:25,044
What am I going
to do with you?

1522
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:37,901
How could you not tell me, Sarah?
You didn't tell me.

1523
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,329
When are you going to trust
in the fact that I love you?

1524
01:21:40,372 --> 01:21:43,503
Your dad loves you,
Mauricio.

1525
01:21:43,539 --> 01:21:46,573
Just because I love my job
doesn't mean I love you less.

1526
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:49,328
You'll see that when
we have kids of our own.

1527
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:51,218
Don't worry about
the kid thing.

1528
01:21:51,251 --> 01:21:54,000
I'm getting used to the idea
of not having kids anyway.

1529
01:21:56,339 --> 01:21:58,728
I want to start trying
right away.

1530
01:22:01,843 --> 01:22:03,534
Life is short, right?

1531
01:22:03,571 --> 01:22:06,386
- Yeah.
- Let's just do it.

1532
01:22:06,419 --> 01:22:09,036
Wow, when are you
gonna turn the job down?

1533
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:12,819
I'm still gonna
take the job.

1534
01:22:20,049 --> 01:22:22,384
- Wow, not even a dent.
- Yeah.

1535
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:32,774
To make the pernil taste great
you've got to puncture it like this.

1536
01:22:32,817 --> 01:22:35,087
And then you put
the garlic cloves in it.

1537
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:37,422
Okay, now the pasteles,
you need to-

1538
01:22:37,456 --> 01:22:40,272
We got it, Mami.
Now go back to the hospital.

1539
01:22:40,305 --> 01:22:42,509
Please.

1540
01:22:42,544 --> 01:22:44,845
- Is that your agent?
- Yeah.

1541
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:47,783
Ay, Diosito.
Let it be good news.

1542
01:22:47,825 --> 01:22:50,028
- We need good news today.
- Amen.

1543
01:22:50,064 --> 01:22:52,583
Hey, Sarah.

1544
01:22:52,624 --> 01:22:55,341
Um, I'll really glad
you're here.

1545
01:23:12,783 --> 01:23:14,888
Hey.

1546
01:23:14,927 --> 01:23:16,781
How you holding up?

1547
01:23:16,815 --> 01:23:19,498
God, if I see any more
sofrito, I think I'll scream.

1548
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:21,574
I don't know
how my mom does it.

1549
01:23:21,615 --> 01:23:23,719
I heard you didn't
get the part.

1550
01:23:25,614 --> 01:23:28,364
No, I got the part.
I just didn't take it.

1551
01:23:28,398 --> 01:23:29,772
What?

1552
01:23:29,806 --> 01:23:31,715
It was for the seventh
lead on a TV show

1553
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:34,604
that'll probably be off
the air after three episodes anyway.

1554
01:23:34,637 --> 01:23:36,263
It wasn't all that.

1555
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:38,570
Yeah, it was.

1556
01:23:38,605 --> 01:23:40,972
I can't say
I'm mad at you.

1557
01:23:41,004 --> 01:23:43,493
- You better not be.
- I'm not.

1558
01:23:56,204 --> 01:23:58,593
Well well well.

1559
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:01,483
- What do we got here?
- Get a life, Jesse.

1560
01:24:01,516 --> 01:24:03,905
- Shut up, man.
- Oh yeah.

1561
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:16,486
- Hey.
- Hey.

1562
01:24:18,155 --> 01:24:20,260
Fernando here?

1563
01:24:20,298 --> 01:24:22,240
He's at his cousin's house.

1564
01:24:22,283 --> 01:24:24,170
He's gonna be by soon

1565
01:24:24,202 --> 01:24:26,341
and you know he's not gonna
be happy if he finds you here.

1566
01:24:26,379 --> 01:24:29,128
My mom just wanted me to
bring this by for Hector.

1567
01:24:29,162 --> 01:24:32,642
You really didn't
have to do that.

1568
01:24:32,681 --> 01:24:34,754
- Ooh, a truck.
- Oh, yeah.

1569
01:24:34,794 --> 01:24:37,160
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1570
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:48,417
I know things got messed
up with the fight,

1571
01:24:48,457 --> 01:24:52,003
but I was hoping you'd still
come by the house.

1572
01:24:52,041 --> 01:24:54,528
- We're going to Fernando's parent's place.
- Oh.

1573
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,734
I'm looking at you

1574
01:25:01,769 --> 01:25:04,834
and I realize the one thing
I haven't said is...

1575
01:25:04,872 --> 01:25:07,238
I'm sorry.

1576
01:25:10,056 --> 01:25:11,583
I'm sorry, Marissa.

1577
01:25:14,632 --> 01:25:16,770
Look, Jesse,

1578
01:25:16,807 --> 01:25:19,011
it's like when we-

1579
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:21,699
when we fall in love,

1580
01:25:21,735 --> 01:25:24,288
we take a chance
that we might get hurt.

1581
01:25:25,574 --> 01:25:27,168
But we choose
to do it anyway.

1582
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:29,574
And it's just like
with you and Lenny.

1583
01:25:29,607 --> 01:25:32,290
When he switched
watch with you,

1584
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,050
he knew that he
was taking a risk.

1585
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:36,191
Then he took your place

1586
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:37,953
and you're still here.

1587
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:42,077
He gave you
a second chance.

1588
01:25:44,325 --> 01:25:46,235
Why would you want
to throw that away?

1589
01:25:53,764 --> 01:25:55,837
Hello?
Hey.

1590
01:25:55,878 --> 01:25:58,528
Can you pick up
some milk?

1591
01:25:58,564 --> 01:26:00,604
Thanks.

1592
01:26:04,068 --> 01:26:06,207
Yeah.

1593
01:26:13,732 --> 01:26:16,667
I'm glad you found somebody
to make you happy.

1594
01:26:18,627 --> 01:26:20,667
I just wish
it could've been me.

1595
01:26:26,531 --> 01:26:28,768
You should probably go.

1596
01:26:28,803 --> 01:26:30,690
Yeah.

1597
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:38,392
Goodbye, Marissa.

1598
01:26:42,051 --> 01:26:44,156
Goodbye.

1599
01:27:45,182 --> 01:27:47,604
Uh...

1600
01:27:47,646 --> 01:27:49,621
hello.

1601
01:27:51,038 --> 01:27:53,372
Mrs. Brewer?

1602
01:27:53,406 --> 01:27:55,446
Hi, it's Jesse.

1603
01:27:55,486 --> 01:27:58,300
I'm Lenny's friend.

1604
01:28:10,397 --> 01:28:13,047
You like these?
Mom, how'd you know my size?

1605
01:28:13,086 --> 01:28:14,743
It's real comfortable too.

1606
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:16,154
I used to be small.
Now it's extra large.

1607
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:17,944
What is this?

1608
01:28:17,981 --> 01:28:20,599
Oh, looks big.
Looks big.

1609
01:28:20,637 --> 01:28:23,538
- Oooh.
- Oh.

1610
01:28:23,581 --> 01:28:26,198
Achristening gown.

1611
01:28:26,237 --> 01:28:28,408
Mauricio told me
about your plans.

1612
01:28:28,444 --> 01:28:30,353
Yeah, um-

1613
01:28:30,395 --> 01:28:32,468
we've never really talked
about baptism.

1614
01:28:32,508 --> 01:28:33,914
No we didn't.
No we didn't.

1615
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:35,835
But we're not gonna
bar mitzvah the kid.

1616
01:28:35,868 --> 01:28:37,907
Come on, who ever heard
of a Puerto Rican Jew?

1617
01:28:37,947 --> 01:28:40,566
- Geraldo Rivera.
- Juan Epstein.

1618
01:28:40,603 --> 01:28:42,425
That's a television character.
Stay out of it, thank you.

1619
01:28:42,459 --> 01:28:45,241
Actually, in San Juan
there are a lot of Puerto Rican Jews.

1620
01:28:45,275 --> 01:28:47,348
Oh, Ma.

1621
01:28:47,387 --> 01:28:48,980
That's Johnny.

1622
01:28:49,019 --> 01:28:51,288
That necklace that Edy
gave you is so beautiful.

1623
01:28:51,323 --> 01:28:53,744
- That's not all she's getting.
- Dad!

1624
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:57,201
I meant the tree.
You said you wanted a view.

1625
01:28:57,243 --> 01:28:59,544
I'm gonna call those guys
back after the holidays and take it down.

1626
01:28:59,578 --> 01:29:01,684
Huh-uh.
It's old,

1627
01:29:01,722 --> 01:29:03,762
it's ugly,
but it's my tree.

1628
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:05,842
And I love it.

1629
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,605
Who needs a view anyway?

1630
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,300
Whatever you wish.

1631
01:29:09,337 --> 01:29:10,711
Uncle Edy,
Uncle Edy.

1632
01:29:10,746 --> 01:29:14,869
Oh, look what fell
off the truck.

1633
01:29:14,905 --> 01:29:18,899
We got a brand new and improved
situation going on here for you.

1634
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,457
There it is,
brand new and improved.

1635
01:29:21,497 --> 01:29:23,635
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

1636
01:29:23,674 --> 01:29:25,712
- Yeah!
- Ma, what is this?

1637
01:29:25,754 --> 01:29:28,142
That's for your dad.
Put it away.

1638
01:29:28,184 --> 01:29:30,191
- Smell 'em.
- No!

1639
01:29:30,233 --> 01:29:32,142
Did you regift?
You regifted.

1640
01:29:32,184 --> 01:29:34,420
Thank you so much, Johnny.

1641
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,894
Come on.
Come on, dance with me.

1642
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:13,136
When it's cold you've got
to jiggle the key a couple of times.

1643
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:14,962
'Cause sometimes
the lock sticks.

1644
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:16,787
I got it, Pop.
I got it.

1645
01:30:16,822 --> 01:30:18,709
I know you do.
