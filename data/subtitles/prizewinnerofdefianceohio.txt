{3678}{3756}Win a trip for 12|to anywhere in the free world,
{3758}{3851}or win a working oil well|and have money flowing in for years.
{3853}{3941}That's the grand prize|in Dial Soap's big contest.
{3943}{4018}Write a two line jingle starting,|"I'm glad I use Dial..."
{4020}{4073}The last word in|both lines must rhyme.
{4075}{4154}For example: "I'm glad I use Dial..."
{4183}{4289}How hard is it to put it|across the plate? You idiot.
{4290}{4351}There once was a time,|believe it or not,
{4353}{4425}when skill and a|reasonable amount of luck
{4427}{4510}could actually feed a family of 12.
{4512}{4590}Come on! Strike 'em out,|you dog-faced bastard! Play ball!
{4592}{4643}Contesting, if you haven't heard of it,
{4645}{4741}was a lucrative way for overworked|housewives to use their underused wits.
{4775}{4862}It wasn't that I was any more gifted|than your average contester,
{4864}{4911}I was simply more determined.
{4913}{4994}I was so prolific, in fact,|that I borrowed my children's names
{4996}{5044}so I could submit|more than one entry.
{5046}{5124}This was a perfectly legal tactic|in the contesting world,
{5126}{5221}and as far as I could see, one of|the advantages of having so many kids.
{5335}{5450}My creative output usually|corresponded directly to our needs.
{5452}{5520}- Hey, Mom. The toaster's broke.|- Broken.
{5522}{5580}All right. Hold on.
{5614}{5666}"Kraft's Parkay|won't tear fresh bread.
{5668}{5739}Even ice cold,|it will smoothly spread."
{5866}{5926}- Here you go, honey.|- Thanks, Mom.
{5948}{6030}Small household adversities|were my steady inspiration.
{6032}{6106}But whenever fate handed|one of my kids an unfair blow,
{6108}{6178}it would set my muse on fire.
{6335}{6369}- Mom.|- What, honey?
{6370}{6417}The landlord's here.
{6418}{6481}Oh, hello, Mr. Stubbs.|Come on in.
{6583}{6635}- Dad!|- Hey, Dad!
{6791}{6849}Dad, we're being evicted!
{6850}{6922}- Come on, let me out.|- Dad!
{6923}{6983}- We're being evicted.|- Oh, yeah?
{6985}{7044}The landlord came by.|He wants the house back.
{7046}{7089}His daughter's getting married.
{7091}{7141}- How long do we have?|- Three weeks.
{7154}{7232}- What are we gonna do?|- Don't you worry, sweetheart.
{7234}{7289}Mom always figures something out.
{7291}{7353}- Do you know the capital of Alaska?|- No.
{7355}{7431}- Juneau... get it?|- Oh, yeah. Good one.
{7462}{7529}- Hello, Mother.|- Hello, Dad. I suppose you heard?
{7530}{7607}Yep. Can't seem|to catch a break, can we?
{7644}{7704}Here, I brought you something.
{7706}{7778}- Thank you.|- Don't choke up so much on the bat.
{7780}{7832}- All right, Dad.|- Attaboy.
{8430}{8492}Mom! The men are here to kick us out!
{8657}{8687}May I help you?
{8722}{8773}- Mrs. Ryan?|- Yes.
{8775}{8814}Is your son, Dick, here?
{8842}{8900}This is Dick.|What is this about?
{8902}{8947}Congratulations, son.
{8949}{9008}- You've just won $5,000.|- I did?
{9010}{9074}I'm Mr. Forrest,|this is Mr. Bravey and Mr. Kramer
{9076}{9122}of the Western Auto Supply Company.
{9124}{9192}Out of 65,000 entries|in our national bike contest,
{9194}{9233}you have won the grand prize.
{9234}{9306}- Oh, my goodness.|- And that's not all.
{9308}{9366}You've won a brand new|Western Flyer bicycle
{9368}{9417}and a Westinghouse washer and dryer.
{9418}{9480}- A washing machine? Oh, my Lord.|- That's right.
{9512}{9555}Are you all right?
{9557}{9639}I just have to sit down|and have myself a happy cry.
{9679}{9722}I love that bike.
{9724}{9794}Dad! We won!
{9842}{9901}We won $5,000!
{9902}{9969}- No kidding.|- Isn't it marvelous?
{9970}{10045}- It's awesome!|- I told you everything would be OK.
{10046}{10114}Congratulations, Kelly.|You got quite a wife there.
{10116}{10155}Yep, looks like she got lucky.
{10157}{10226}Mom says she's gonna put|the money down on a new house.
{10227}{10286}- Yeah?|- Looks like you got lucky.
{10287}{10378}Oh, now, Kelly was all set to do it,|I just beat him to the punch.
{10398}{10433}Alrighty.
{10435}{10533}Just need you to sign Dick's check over|to Defiance Home Saving and Loan.
{10535}{10582}- Does it matter which of us?|- No.
{10583}{10630}Whoever is over 21.
{10631}{10703}Although, you don't look|a day over 19, Mrs. Ryan.
{10705}{10781}Well, in that case, I'd better sign it.
{10978}{11015}Here you go.
{11022}{11061}Okey-doke.
{11078}{11135}And, now the mortgage papers...
{11137}{11189}You need both our signatures, correct?
{11191}{11233}Some married couples do that.
{11235}{11291}But it's really not necessary.
{11293}{11374}And, after all, I'm the guy|who has to pay the mortgage,
{11376}{11430}seems I'm the only one|who needs to sign it.
{11432}{11493}And since the bank account's|under my name...
{11495}{11538}Sure, that's how most folks do it.
{11540}{11598}Well, that seems right to me.
{11616}{11671}Well, I guess it's all on me then.
{11673}{11726}Unless Mother here wants to start...
{11756}{11841}...punching in at the shop.|- Only if you'll do the ironing.
{11875}{11928}We just need|your John Hancock there.
{11978}{12018}Ryan.
{12052}{12124}Well, congratulations, Mr. Ryan.
{12136}{12185}You are a homeowner, sir.
{12186}{12223}Thank you.
{12378}{12434}All right, watch that curb.
{12642}{12689}- Good, yes.|- Oh, my goodness.
{12691}{12723}Is that what I won?
{12725}{12797}- Yes, ma'am.|- They're just beautiful.
{12799}{12837}- Watch out.|- Excuse me, sir.
{12839}{12881}Dad, can you believe it?
{12883}{12945}No more boiling diapers|on top of the stove.
{12946}{13032}Yep, gonna miss it.|It made a nice soup.
{13034}{13067}The cost of modern living.
{13069}{13114}Sir, we're looking for Mrs. E. Ryan.
{13116}{13179}- There.|- Oh, hello. I'm up here.
{13181}{13225}This is your new home freezer.
{13226}{13264}Mikey, honey, get down.
{13266}{13310}"Ask any Eskimo and they'll say,
{13312}{13374}frozen keeps|the freshness in every day."
{13376}{13470}My gosh. I forgot all about that one.|When it rains, it pours.
{13471}{13503}Down.
{13505}{13535}Well, bring it on in.
{13562}{13592}How's it going, Pop?
{13594}{13662}Don't make your old man|carry this couch.
{13692}{13729}Come on.
{13801}{13891}OK, on the count of three.|One, two, three.
{13893}{13958}Tuff, keep that cat out of the house.
{14066}{14117}What are you doing?
{14134}{14164}Here.
{14182}{14235}A little bit of this?
{14247}{14276}Good?
{14396}{14494}Dad, isn't this the biggest freezer|you ever seen in your life?
{14496}{14542}It's like the ones in restaurants.
{14543}{14621}The deliveryman told me|it would hold two sides of beef.
{14622}{14667}Seems like overkill to me.
{14693}{14782}Besides, it's dangerous.|A kid could fall in there and suffocate.
{14784}{14883}- No, we won't.|- I don't want to say I told you so.
{14885}{14942}- I'd like to keep it.|- What the heck for?
{14944}{15005}Do you know how much|electricity this will eat?
{15007}{15065}It inspires me.|It's something to be filled.
{15066}{15095}Good luck with that.
{15097}{15164}Even Howard Hughes|couldn't fill that thing.
{15166}{15213}We got plenty in it already.
{15260}{15337}- Only dishes, but something's in there.|- Yeah.
{15338}{15398}That'll take up|some of the room, at least.
{15487}{15538}The Red Sox, three,|Cleveland, two.
{15540}{15599}- The Indians have one last out.|- God's sakes!
{15601}{15668}Bunch of bums, is what you are.
{15670}{15752}- Bunch of bums.|- The bases are loaded.
{15754}{15829}Writing a winning entry not only|requires a modicum of wit,
{15831}{15917}it also requires careful product focus.
{15918}{16014}Notice I have not one,|but two brand names I need to use.
{16016}{16066}You want to know|where this is headed?
{16068}{16128}Niagara Falls, straight down.
{16130}{16183}Here's what I have so far.
{16185}{16237}"Wide selections, priced to please her.
{16239}{16305}Scads of Seabrook's in their freezer.
{16306}{16361}Warmth that scorns the impersonal trend,
{16362}{16436}stamps Big Chief|as the housewife's friend."
{16462}{16530}Mom, I left my|spelling book in the kitchen.
{16565}{16603}All right, honey.
{16640}{16701}- Strike two.|- God damn it.
{16703}{16748}- Where is it?|- What's the matter?
{16750}{16788}Take the bat off your shoulder.
{16790}{16861}- Who's ahead?|- The Red Sox.
{16889}{16922}All right.
{16924}{16988}Come on, you moron. Hit the ball!
{16990}{17088}...gets the sign... on third...
{17090}{17128}...here's the pitch...
{17130}{17180}Cold! Strike three.
{17182}{17272}God damn it to holy fucking hell!
{17274}{17344}You're killing us, you stupid bastard!
{17346}{17391}Hey, shut up over there!
{17431}{17455}You shut up!
{17457}{17520}This is a family neighborhood.|Clean your mouth.
{17522}{17602}I'll clean you up!|Who are you, the Pope?
{17604}{17670}Oh, for crying out loud.|I can't believe we got...
{17694}{17769}Goddamn piece of shit!
{17814}{17859}Where you trying to go with that?
{17861}{17927}This goddamn thing is too big|for this goddamn house!
{17929}{18003}You're gonna hurt your back.|Why not wait until morning?
{18005}{18086}I want this goddamn thing|out of the house right now!
{18088}{18159}I want it out!
{18161}{18246}- I never wanted it!|- All right, I'll see what I can do.
{18613}{18672}You'll enjoy...
{18685}{18761}The clean, tangy taste of Dr. Pepper.
{18805}{18849}- Nice try.|- Sorry, Mrs. Bidlack.
{18864}{18904}Watch it.
{18946}{19020}Maybe we should talk on the radio.
{19259}{19327}Indians.|I can't believe the Indians...
{19329}{19379}Problem is they got no clean-up batter.
{19381}{19445}- Clean up what?|- Half the team's in a slump.
{19446}{19506}Best move to make|is get rid of that manager.
{19508}{19573}You can't blame him.|Pitching, I'm telling you...
{19574}{19652}- What a world.|- Yeah. There's always...
{19654}{19722}- We're gonna take off now.|- Take it easy.
{19724}{19789}Hey, thanks, Tim.
{19866}{19915}He won't give you anymore trouble.
{19917}{19972}Best thing to do|is let him sleep it off.
{20068}{20121}Hey, Dick, how's the pitching arm?
{20122}{20170}Going for a no-hitter next season?
{20172}{20221}- You bet.|- Go get 'em, kiddo.
{20410}{20471}Here you go. I made this for you.
{20473}{20521}Thank you, Dad.
{20586}{20618}I'm tired.
{20620}{20672}Your pajamas are on the bed.
{20674}{20703}Thank you.
{20914}{20950}Mom?
{20952}{21003}Father McCague's here.
{21090}{21145}I don't think that you need to worry.
{21147}{21221}I'm sure that he's learned his lesson.
{21223}{21292}This has been going on|for a very long time.
{21294}{21391}Every night he drinks|a six pack and a pint of whiskey.
{21393}{21457}By the end of the week|nothing's left of his check.
{21458}{21501}It's all gone to the liquor store.
{21503}{21553}Kelly has a big family to take care of.
{21555}{21657}I'm sure he's carrying around|the weight of the world.
{21700}{21785}But the more he drinks,|the less he's able to pay the bills,
{21786}{21838}which is one reason he's so unhappy.
{21840}{21888}But it's up to you, you see,
{21890}{21981}- to make him a good home.|- But I do.
{21997}{22067}Well, you'll have|to try a little harder.
{22130}{22238}No one says that life is easy.
{22386}{22435}Thank you for coming by, Father.
{22494}{22559}Yes, indeed.
{22801}{22894}Are you being obedient|and saying all your prayers?
{22895}{22935}Yes, Father.
{22949}{23039}Good boy. I'll see you in church.
{23150}{23228}His breath smells like Dad's.
{23230}{23324}Well, maybe that's why Father|likes to use so much incense.
{23385}{23442}All right, kids.
{23444}{23520}Let's go to bed.|I'm tired of this day.
{23522}{23547}I need a new one.
{23547}{23563}I need a new one.
{23565}{23617}If I may pause|in the story for a moment,
{23618}{23681}I'd like to briefly explain my marriage.
{23708}{23809}As a young scribe, I was a resident wit|for the Sherwood Weekly Chronicle.
{23810}{23871}Queen Elizabeth|invented ladies' stockings.
{23873}{23952}Since her time,|they've covered a multitude of shins.
{23954}{24008}Evelyn, that's top-notch.
{24010}{24068}I had potential, as they say.
{24089}{24172}I was also in sore need of adventure.
{24174}{24249}And Kelly Ryan was loads of fun.
{24589}{24648}He loved music|as much as I loved words.
{24650}{24733}And we were just the perfect match.
{25017}{25144}Then one night, Kelly's career|as a crooner came to a terrible end.
{25264}{25340}And so, our life in Defiance began...
{25394}{25468}...where my husband joined|the ranks of ordinary men.
{25630}{25697}So if he seems unhelpful at times
{25698}{25745}or selfish or mean,
{25765}{25841}please remember|that he lost his voice,
{25855}{25899}while I kept mine.
{25981}{26014}Here you go, Dick.
{26016}{26074}There's a soldier on this glass,|look at that.
{26076}{26118}Who's winning the battle?
{26233}{26269}Drink your milk, baby.
{26271}{26330}Morning, Mother. Morning, kids.
{26332}{26372}Morning, Dad.
{26374}{26470}What do you say I fix|everyone some pancakes?
{26472}{26558}You can't. We're out of milk.|I need some money, by the way.
{26595}{26649}How about coffee?|You guys are old enough.
{26651}{26705}- No, thanks.|- No.
{26793}{26853}Who the heck did this?|One of you kids?
{26855}{26897}You did, Daddy.
{26899}{26988}No, siree. I think it was...
{26990}{27016}...you.
{27035}{27087}No, I did not.
{27125}{27151}Yeah.
{27153}{27248}Well, you can't sell it now.|Looks like we're stuck with it.
{27250}{27302}It seems like we are.
{27304}{27344}How about I take up hunting,
{27346}{27396}fill that thing full of duck and deer?
{27398}{27438}No, Daddy!
{27440}{27495}You don't like that idea, OK.
{27497}{27545}Well, how about I just go shoot
{27547}{27616}some squirrels|and little bunny rabbits?
{27618}{27689}How about you don't spend|so much at the liquor store.
{27926}{27963}Tell you what.
{27986}{28051}Every night, when I come home,
{28070}{28131}I'll bring something|from the grocery store.
{28133}{28234}I'm gonna fill that to the very top,|even if it takes me a year.
{28261}{28352}- What do you think of that?|- I think that's a wonderful idea.
{28414}{28473}I gotta go to work|so I can bring home the bacon.
{28475}{28561}- And a porterhouse steak.|- Hey, I'm not kidding.
{28563}{28611}You just watch your old man.
{28613}{28663}I need money for the milkman.
{28900}{28940}That's not enough.
{28954}{28994}That's all I have.
{29043}{29076}OK.
{29097}{29132}Bye, kids.
{29181}{29221}Bye.
{29269}{29341}How's Dad gonna fill the freezer|when he can't pay for milk?
{29343}{29400}I have no idea, honey.
{29414}{29466}But at least he has a goal.
{29478}{29479}Now the moment is here
{29479}{29524}Now the moment is here
{29526}{29585}when Queen for A Day|makes your wish come true.
{29586}{29642}We're going to|the Everson-Jennings company
{29644}{29715}and order one of their sturdy,|folding wheelchairs.
{29717}{29751}There's a sample.
{29753}{29803}- Mommy.|- Yes, honey?
{29844}{29931}Davey messed his diaper|and I tried to change him.
{29933}{29991}Oh, show me.
{30070}{30120}Oh, Barbie.
{30122}{30215}The trick is to hold the baby's legs up|while you take the diaper off.
{30217}{30299}- I got it on my hands.|- I know you did, sweetheart.
{30301}{30361}OK, now, here we go. Follow me.
{30363}{30439}All right, don't touch anything.|Come on, Betsy, you too.
{30441}{30523}Let's wash your hands.|Yeah. Come on, come on.
{30525}{30567}All right, everybody. Come on.
{30624}{30689}OK, put your hands under the faucet.
{30814}{30902}- Milk delivery!|- Just a minute, I'll be right there.
{30933}{30986}Come on. I've got deliveries to make.
{31003}{31037}Just a minute, please.
{31125}{31193}- I'm leaving.|- No, you aren't.
{31242}{31289}I'm on my way.
{31352}{31439}OK, girls. Stay in the kitchen|till I can clean this up.
{31542}{31598}You know that I got a schedule to keep.
{31600}{31663}I know you do, Ray.|What a life you lead.
{31665}{31724}- Three dollars.|- I'm a little short this week.
{31726}{31753}Can I owe you?
{31755}{31819}I got three other families|on credit this week.
{31821}{31890}- You know I'm always good for it.|- I'm not a bank.
{31892}{31946}You could start charging interest.
{31948}{31990}Don't get smart with me.
{31992}{32050}- Smart people know their budget.|- Right.
{32052}{32112}That's why I don't have|a problem paying bills.
{32114}{32161}Hello, vernon.|Anything for me today?
{32163}{32239}You want something in life,|you got to pay for it.
{32241}{32284}- Here you go.|- Thank you.
{32286}{32314}Hey, Ray.
{32316}{32355}Oh, hold on.
{32398}{32449}How do you like that?
{32450}{32528}I won two dollars in the poetry|contest for The Toledo Blade.
{32530}{32554}There you go.
{32728}{32770}There he goes.
{32814}{32879}Yeah. You want the money?
{32892}{32963}I'm sorry I made such a mess, Mommy.
{32993}{33050}Well, actually, honey,
{33052}{33119}if I had gotten|the door any sooner,
{33121}{33205}then the milkman would have|left before the mailman arrived,
{33207}{33284}and we wouldn't have had|any milk for our dinner tonight.
{33286}{33334}So, there you go.
{33336}{33379}It was all meant to be.
{33530}{33638}This is what happens to one's literary|efforts once placed in the mailbox.
{33712}{33813}For the big contests, they go sailing|off to New York City to be judged.
{33814}{33907}The average count|is a million and a half entries.
{33909}{33989}A million and a half. Imagine that!
{34027}{34146}Each entry is first checked to make sure|it's accompanied by proof of purchase.
{34148}{34215}You don't pay, you don't play.
{34217}{34260}Next they go to the juniorjudges.
{34262}{34305}College English majors, mind you,
{34306}{34366}who are instructed|to eliminate the trite,
{34367}{34451}the obvious and the inept. Oh, dear.
{34453}{34531}And so, the final judging begins.
{34533}{34608}Every syllable of every word|is scrutinized and analyzed,
{34610}{34691}the merits of each debated|until a few of the worthiest remain.
{34693}{34782}The ballots are cast,|the points are added up
{34784}{34860}and the grand prize winner is declared.
{35075}{35134}Oh, my gosh!
{35135}{35231}- Mommy won a shopping spree!|- Oh, yeah?
{35233}{35278}They time her as she runs in the store.
{35280}{35371}She can get whatever she wants.|She's gonna get us a bunch of candy...
{35373}{35456}And fancy nuts.|I'm gonna eat a cashew.
{35475}{35517}Can you believe it?
{35518}{35559}That's terrific, Mother.
{35561}{35617}Now, I only get|ten minutes and one cart,
{35618}{35695}so what I did was, I walked|to the market to plot my strategy.
{35697}{35780}- Wait till you hear this.|- The carts are smaller than at the A&P.
{35782}{35861}- Mom talked to the butcher.|- He's gonna wrap up bacon and ribs.
{35863}{35963}- I can build up the cart that way.|- Sounds pretty clever.
{35965}{36053}I asked him to set aside a prime rib,|a chateaubriand, what do you think?
{36055}{36120}- We each get our own filet mignon.|- Absolutely.
{36122}{36169}Tuff, honey, would you set the table?
{36171}{36242}I had filet mignon once.|It ain't that great.
{36244}{36293}When have you started saying "ain't"?
{36295}{36363}Get off your high horse.|It's a perfectly good word.
{36400}{36470}- Here.|- Oh, thank you.
{36485}{36544}This is perfect.|I was gonna put on fish sticks,
{36546}{36594}but now I can make sloppy joes.
{36616}{36657}Might as well cook it up now.
{36658}{36752}Looks like hamburger's not gonna be|good enough for this family anymore.
{36754}{36824}Oh, of course it is.|Itjust won't be the only thing we know.
{36826}{36896}I asked the kids to make a list|of what they want me to grab.
{36898}{36992}- What would you like?|- Don't waste any space on me.
{36994}{37084}Oh, now stop. Think.|What have you always wanted to try?
{37086}{37132}- I don't know.|- Sure you do.
{37214}{37269}Shrimp cocktail.
{37270}{37352}The kind they have in those little jars.
{37354}{37444}I like the way they look,|kind of elegant.
{37461}{37511}I always wanted one of those.
{37513}{37561}You shall have it.
{37647}{37686}Thank you, Mother.
{37803}{37850}Proud of the old lady.
{38238}{38296}- But I think you should...|- Oh, no.
{38427}{38467}Are all these kids yours?
{38498}{38567}- Hi, Mom.|- Yes. If it's all right,
{38569}{38649}they were going to call out the time|so I could stay on schedule.
{38651}{38713}Oh, I don't know.
{38746}{38794}I don't see any problem with that.
{38836}{38921}And any help you happen|to give Mrs. Ryan in filling her cart
{38922}{38962}won't be seen by me.
{39013}{39065}So, then, are you ready?
{39066}{39098}Hold on.
{39470}{39556}- Didn't like the way that sounded.|- Thank you.
{39611}{39643}All set?
{39694}{39728}Go!
{39828}{39895}Go! Faster!
{39897}{39937}- I think we should split up.|- OK.
{39939}{40020}I'll take the frozen section,|you take the European food aisle.
{40022}{40093}- What do you want, hon?|- Oh, caviar, expensive things.
{40095}{40144}The good stuff, not the ordinary.
{40146}{40182}Gotcha.
{40184}{40220}Marge, go!
{40398}{40470}Seven minutes to go!
{40858}{40915}Three minutes. Come on!
{41241}{41290}One minute left!
{41342}{41409}I got you some goose pate.|You ever had that?
{41410}{41464}- No.|- Let me know what it's like.
{41466}{41535}I got all the after-dinner mints,|the Swiss chocolate,
{41537}{41612}two bags of English toffees|and a couple bags of coffee mints.
{41614}{41674}Grab and move on. Where to?
{41676}{41717}- Produce!|- What for?
{41718}{41775}Exotic, anything grown|in a foreign country.
{41777}{41834}- Does Hawaii count?|- Yes.
{41836}{41889}Thirty seconds!
{42191}{42222}Time!
{42510}{42596}I got your shrimp cocktail!|I got your shrimp cocktail!
{42598}{42657}That was... great.
{42678}{42731}- We're gonna eat good tonight.|- Yep.
{42733}{42791}Well done.
{42793}{42869}Look at all this food|and candy and sugar and sweets!
{42870}{42920}And lobster!
{43054}{43098}Let's see, what else?
{43100}{43159}Anybody want an artichoke heart?
{43161}{43217}- What do you think?|- This is really good.
{43219}{43292}- Here, try it.|- Yeah, they're really good.
{43294}{43333}What's this?
{43364}{43401}Litchi nuts from China.
{43403}{43453}- Oh, I see.|- What do they taste like?
{43454}{43517}Go get the can opener|and let's try one.
{43530}{43594}Litchi nuts, who the hell|would want to eat that?
{43596}{43638}What are you looking for?
{43656}{43712}I'm looking for hamburger.
{43714}{43759}I have a steak all ready for you.
{43761}{43835}I don't want steak.|I want hamburger.
{43914}{43945}Oh, look at this.
{43946}{44021}Hearts of palm, from a palm tree,|can you believe it?
{44059}{44125}These are capers.
{44127}{44177}They come from Spain.
{44190}{44217}Try one.
{44235}{44270}No, thank you.
{44272}{44313}Oh, come on. It's an adventure.
{44315}{44369}But they're green and yicky.
{44418}{44469}Please put that food|back in the freezer.
{44470}{44517}I don't want everything to thaw.
{44848}{44909}Capers, my ass.
{44965}{45048}I think it's time we tried some caviar.
{45050}{45089}Now...
{45090}{45179}...caviar is one...
{45181}{45269}...of the finest delicacies...
{45271}{45309}...in...
{45329}{45390}...the Western world.
{45392}{45464}It comes from Russia.
{45466}{45551}And we are about to become...
{45553}{45634}...the very first Ryans...
{45636}{45678}...to ever taste it.
{45680}{45728}- What is it?|- Fish eggs.
{45730}{45789}Dick, Bub, Rog,|would you like to try it?
{45790}{45860}- No, I'll stick with coconut.|- No, thank you.
{45914}{45996}- Tuff?|- No, thanks.
{46022}{46117}Do you know that U.S. Army research|has shown a relationship
{46119}{46235}between intelligence and a willingness|to eat unfamiliar foods?
{46282}{46345}Are those really fish eggs?
{46426}{46474}I just can't.
{46476}{46545}Oh, well. More for me then.
{47002}{47044}It's marvelous.
{47298}{47375}Oh, my goodness.
{47400}{47440}My sweet goodness.
{47485}{47519}How is your supper?
{47858}{47893}Not very good.
{47985}{48045}Your shrimp cocktail is in the fridge.
{48258}{48340}They say it's good if you|squeeze a little lemon on top.
{48473}{48512}Thank you, Mother.
{48523}{48566}Enjoy it, Dad.
{48589}{48666}All right, what will we open next?
{48668}{48736}Anybody here like lobster?
{48762}{48816}We'll try a little of that.
{48818}{48866}And... what else do we have?
{48868}{48949}We have some button mushrooms...
{48969}{49025}Come on over here.|Sit down with us.
{49042}{49083}Let's see, what else do we have?
{49085}{49149}An artichoke heart,|want an artichoke heart?
{49151}{49207}- Sure.|- Very good.
{49209}{49266}Come on. You can share my seat.
{49268}{49304}Sit down.
{49306}{49361}Oh, yeah. Look at those little pickles.
{49363}{49394}Look at that.
{49396}{49480}Dad, you gotta try this. It's amazing.
{49482}{49552}Should I open the sardines?|Who's gonna eat those?
{49554}{49601}- I won't.|- All right, these are mine.
{49603}{49672}Let's see, what else do we have here?
{49674}{49753}- Can I try this?|- Do try it. It's just delicious.
{49755}{49795}Put it on the little cracker.
{49797}{49837}- These are good.|- Aren't they?
{49850}{49907}Are you sick of candy yet, honey?
{49922}{49980}- No, I will never be sick of candy.|- Not yet.
{49982}{50043}- It's good.|- Yes, I know.
{50045}{50084}That one's mine.
{50086}{50160}What about these little white thingies?
{50162}{50240}- Thanks, sweetheart.|- This stuff isn't too cracked.
{50267}{50333}- Mom, it's yesterday's paper.|- Oh, throw that out.
{50481}{50564}For the next four years I would win|a steady stream of small prizes
{50566}{50626}that would keep us functioning,|never flush.
{50627}{50713}I won two ice buckets,|ten pairs of galoshes,
{50714}{50795}one sled, which arrived|just in time, I might add,
{50797}{50875}fifteen ice crushers,|a case of dog food,
{50877}{50946}a pair of Arthur Murray dancing shoes,
{50948}{50991}a Brownie camera,
{51026}{51079}one free window installation,
{51081}{51140}an outboard motor,
{51142}{51183}eight pogo sticks,
{51185}{51275}a palm tree, which promptly died,
{51277}{51329}a lifetime supply of bird seed...
{51407}{51441}...and a pony,
{51459}{51530}which we had to sell|to pay the electric bill.
{51949}{51999}In the meantime, my eldest, Lea Anne,
{52001}{52048}left home to go to nursing school.
{52050}{52142}"Travel handsome, travel light.|Travel always with Samsonite."
{52198}{52235}And my sons, Dick and Bub,
{52237}{52296}both got signed to play|with the Detroit Tigers.
{52298}{52344}How do you like that?
{52466}{52549}So far, three of my chicks|have found their wings
{52551}{52608}and I am so very proud of them.
{52650}{52699}That is where my prayers went.
{52726}{52772}That's where they all went.
{52805}{52807}Give a little back.
{52807}{52857}Give a little back.
{52859}{52911}Let me get serious.|It's for a good cause.
{52913}{52959}You know why they left?
{52995}{53049}'Cause we live in a hole.
{53072}{53114}A hole without a ladder.
{53141}{53184}I like Beech-Nut so much,
{53186}{53239}I'm going to help them|sponsor a contest.
{53241}{53332}With the folks out there,|they can win all kinds of big prizes.
{53334}{53418}- Do you want your notebook?|- Yes, thank you.
{53420}{53497}You want to know|who dug that hole? I did.
{53499}{53565}Holy moley.|Are you gonna eat that, Jerry?
{53567}{53614}Nope, but I'm gonna sing about it.
{53615}{53680}And the folks out there|are gonna fill in the words.
{53682}{53719}Well, all right.
{53721}{53776}It's my dum-dee-dum-dee-dum
{53778}{53843}Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum sandwich
{53886}{53924}Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum
{53926}{54013}Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum sandwich
{54015}{54058}Hole in the ground
{54060}{54136}Don't make a sound sandwich
{54162}{54205}My stuff it in the mouth
{54206}{54284}Chomp and swallow south sandwich
{54286}{54351}- That's a good one, Mom.|- You can have it.
{54353}{54473}I'm jerk and a dope|and I ain't got a hope sandwich.
{54492}{54538}My back the deli truck
{54540}{54609}To the lips and suck sandwich
{54634}{54675}I'm a moron and a mutt
{54677}{54741}And I made you a nut sandwich
{54743}{54774}Good one, Dad.
{54776}{54824}I'm a chump in a slump
{54826}{54901}And I live in a dump sandwich
{54916}{54962}My frisk the Frigidaire
{54964}{55032}Clean the cupboards bare sandwich
{55072}{55146}- Are you listening to me?|- Yes, I'm listening.
{55148}{55228}- You know what your problem is?|- No, I don't.
{55230}{55289}You're too damn happy.
{55540}{55624}How do you come up with these things?
{55671}{55764}I don't know. They just...|come to me, I guess.
{55790}{55860}That was really funny.
{56093}{56156}- Hey, kids.|- Hi, Daddy.
{56192}{56275}- You're home early.|- I don't feel so hot.
{56277}{56317}My head hurts.
{56318}{56373}Did they pay you for the full day?
{56374}{56420}I don't know. I didn't ask.
{56433}{56482}I felt so lousy|I had to get out of there.
{56484}{56524}Milk delivery!
{56526}{56597}I'm glad you're here.|I need four dollars for the milkman.
{56599}{56657}What's he showing up|so late in the day for?
{56658}{56715}I don't know.|What difference does it make?
{56717}{56767}What happened|to the money I gave you?
{56769}{56837}What do you think happened?|I used it to pay the bills.
{56839}{56907}- I'm leaving.|- I'll be right there.
{56909}{56972}We're out of milk,|would you please give me money?
{57112}{57159}I don't have any.
{57161}{57232}Of course you don't.|It's all in those bottles.
{57390}{57482}- I'm sorry. I'll have to owe you.|- I'm not going to leave the milk.
{57484}{57563}- I always pay you back.|- That's not the point, is it?
{57565}{57647}Listen, I'm not a rich man,|but I never owed anyone anything.
{57649}{57690}You're a better person than I am.
{57692}{57766}We're in the same boat.|But I am not going to do the paddling
{57768}{57827}while you sit back|with your hand in the water.
{57854}{57907}You're absolutely right.
{57909}{57968}But my children need milk.
{57970}{58009}Please don't make them suffer
{58011}{58082}because I am delinquent|in my payments.
{58083}{58115}Please.
{58168}{58242}If you don't pay me next week|I'm cutting you off my route.
{58265}{58305}I understand.
{58333}{58363}Thank you.
{58490}{58550}- That was pleasant.|- Hey.
{58551}{58595}You think money grows on trees?
{58597}{58672}I work my ass off in that|stinking sweatshop all day long.
{58674}{58738}- You get to do whatever you want.|- Whatever I want?
{58740}{58800}Sit around writing|in your stupid notebooks.
{58802}{58900}Those notebooks are the only reason|this family isn't living on the street.
{58902}{58957}Do you want to trade places with me?
{59068}{59113}- Mommy!|- Jesus!
{59115}{59186}- What was that?|- What happened?
{59188}{59221}Oh, Jesus! She slipped.
{59223}{59288}- Daddy was yelling at her.|- What did you do to her?
{59290}{59326}It was an accident!
{59328}{59369}I wouldn't hurt your mother!
{59370}{59430}I think somebody|should get Mrs. Bidlack.
{59432}{59470}We don't need Mrs. Bidlack.
{59472}{59557}Get away from the glass.|Would somebody please help me up?
{59559}{59626}Sweet Christ, Mother.
{59628}{59685}- Would somebody help me up?|- Stay back.
{59740}{59784}For goodness sakes, just move.
{59916}{59982}Hold on. I'll take you to the hospital.|Let me get my...
{59984}{60037}No, you are not!|You almost killed her!
{60038}{60076}I didn't do anything! I swear!
{60078}{60124}I think it's best|if you just stay put.
{60126}{60175}Oh, my God!|My sweet God! What?
{60177}{60255}Would you get a towel|so I don't make a mess in the car?
{60257}{60322}- I'll get it.|- Where's my purse?
{60324}{60408}- Would you like me to call the police?|- That won't be necessary.
{60410}{60468}- Here.|- Honey, could you hook it over my arm?
{60470}{60497}Thank you.
{60499}{60541}- Here, Mother.|- For Pete's sake.
{60543}{60597}What am I supposed to do with that?
{60598}{60670}If you wouldn't mind mopping|so it doesn't warp the wood,
{60671}{60725}I'll go over the rest of it later.
{60727}{60811}- I'll take your mother to the hospital.|- I'm all right.
{60813}{60857}- You know the worst part?|- What?
{60859}{60917}A quart of milk got sucked up|inside my girdle.
{60918}{60959}Oh, my dear.
{60961}{61061}- Please don't die, Mommy.|- It was an accident.
{61099}{61153}Everything all right in there?
{61366}{61367}The question is...
{61367}{61416}The question is...
{61418}{61484}This is a presidential election year.
{61486}{61592}If a qualified woman|were running for president,
{61594}{61663}how would you feel about voting for her
{61665}{61695}and why.
{61697}{61764}If the men candidates were qualified,
{61766}{61829}I feel I would vote against her.
{61831}{61914}My reasons being|that women are very high-strung
{61916}{61954}and emotional people.
{61956}{62006}They aren't knowledgeable enough...
{62008}{62083}- Mom!|- Here we go, special delivery.
{62085}{62198}- Oh, we missed you so much.|- Be careful of her.
{62200}{62245}I'm not that fragile.
{62247}{62286}Thank you for taking me.
{62319}{62365}- Any time.|- See, it's not so bad.
{62366}{62418}Hello, Mother. How's it going?
{62420}{62473}Well, I got lucky.
{62474}{62561}Doctor said I was half an inch away|from severing a ligament.
{62562}{62630}Oh, see, kids.|Your mother's as good as new.
{62632}{62719}I have dinner set, here's a cup of tea.|Why don't you sit down?
{62721}{62789}First thing I'd like to do|is take off this wet girdle,
{62790}{62854}if you could help me,|I can't use my hands just yet.
{62856}{62933}OK. Go on, kids,|supper's on the table.
{62935}{63004}- Are you OK?|- I'm fine, sweetheart.
{63006}{63052}'Course she's OK.
{63082}{63162}It's all right, boys.|Go ahead, get something to eat.
{63331}{63389}I think what...
{63391}{63475}...hurt more than anything was|the dig you made about my contesting.
{63554}{63628}You know, I couldn't be prouder of you.
{63630}{63673}You know that?
{63675}{63741}It's just... the thing is...
{63760}{63815}...the guys at the shop...
{63839}{63900}Anytime you win something, it's...
{63902}{63969}..."Oh, we know|who the breadwinner is."
{63970}{64005}- It ain't me.|- Goodness.
{64007}{64082}They're justjealous.|Why do you even listen to them?
{64133}{64237}All I want in this world|is to make you happy.
{64305}{64367}I don't need you to make me happy.
{64369}{64452}I just need you to|leave me alone when I am.
{64823}{64896}Spilled milk? Don't cry.
{64898}{64988}Unless, of course, it's hip high.
{65011}{65084}I don't cry over milk,|spilled or otherwise.
{65086}{65169}I just wish I had spilled|a smaller other size.
{65214}{65263}Spilled milk can't be poured,
{65265}{65312}if it's spreadin' 'cross the floor.
{65314}{65370}But no need for tears or sorrow.
{65372}{65444}There's always more to spill tomorrow.
{65970}{66010}- Hello?|- Hello.
{66012}{66098}I'm calling on behalf of Beech-Nut Gum|"Name That Sandwich" contest.
{66100}{66146}May I speak to Mr. Bruce Ryan?
{66148}{66191}Yes, hold on one moment, please.
{66193}{66226}Bruce!
{66228}{66285}My frisk the Frigidaire
{66286}{66346}Clean the cupboards bare sandwich
{66348}{66398}Oh, baby
{66400}{66459}You have won a Triumph TR3 sports car
{66461}{66548}and an all expenses paid|weekend trip to New York City
{66550}{66586}for you and one parent.
{66588}{66652}- Can I bring my mom?|- You sure can, son.
{66749}{66808}Everyone move in a little.
{66844}{66883}Enjoy that car.
{67058}{67161}I think my church dress will do|for our dinner at Sardi's.
{67162}{67256}But for sightseeing, I'm gonna|need something a little more casual.
{67258}{67314}Mom, there's a man|on the phone about Rog.
{67316}{67389}My goodness.|Don't tell me he won something too.
{67613}{67663}I only took a few dollars|from the purse.
{67665}{67756}I put the wallet back so she wouldn't|miss her driver's license or nothing.
{67758}{67793}Stealing is stealing.
{67795}{67859}Don't you dare try to justify it.|Don't you dare!
{67878}{67908}Sorry, Mom.
{67958}{67999}Do we have to tell Dad?
{68019}{68068}You thieving little bastard!
{68085}{68169}- Get back here!|- Stop! Calm down.
{68171}{68234}He's a criminal|and he won't get away with it.
{68245}{68292}Next time you set foot in this house,
{68294}{68346}I'll teach you a lesson|you won't forget!
{68348}{68424}Mommy, please.
{68426}{68479}Don't go to New York City.
{68940}{68997}I'm sorry you didn't|get to go to New York.
{69030}{69091}Let's just get you|through this next week.
{69124}{69175}I talked to a friend of mine.
{69177}{69227}He said the judge|gives guys a choice
{69229}{69272}between jail and joining the Army.
{69274}{69344}The Army wouldn't be too bad, would it?
{69376}{69415}No.
{69417}{69479}At least you'd learn|how to make your bed.
{69736}{69799}I wonder what it would|be like to drive this thing.
{69801}{69868}- You want me to teach you?|- No.
{69870}{69922}Then I couldn't bear to sell it.
{69924}{69977}Want me to teach you|how to drive Dad's car?
{69978}{70009}Better not.
{70011}{70089}Not enough gas in this world|for all the places I'd like to go.
{70169}{70238}Go inside and eat your dinner.|It's on the table.
{70729}{70777}Hi, Mr. Quigley.
{70787}{70829}Lady friend's writin' ya.
{70843}{70884}I don't have a lady friend.
{70886}{70927}Give it time.
{70938}{71006}- I'm gonna tickle you.|- Careful, it's slippery.
{71021}{71056}Mom, I think this is for you.
{71058}{71107}Oh, thank you, Bruce.
{71219}{71256}Dear Bruce,
{71258}{71312}I saw your name on|the Beech-Nut win list.
{71314}{71353}Well, what do you know?
{71354}{71453}My daughter, Mary Kay,|who's also 16, won second prize.
{71454}{71517}Gee, what clever kids|your mother and I have.
{71519}{71572}Watch it!
{71574}{71661}I live in Payne, Ohio,|just 85 miles away from you
{71662}{71758}and I'm part of a group of|contesting gals called the Affadaisies.
{71760}{71849}This is probably not of interest|to a strapping teenage boy as yourself,
{71851}{71907}but perhaps your mother|would like to join us.
{71909}{71964}I don't care who did it,|just clean it up!
{71966}{72031}Well, gotta go before|the house comes down.
{72033}{72076}Hope we hear from one of you soon.
{72078}{72149}Sincerely, Don'tha Schaefer.
{72150}{72213}PS. Since they don't|publish the winning entries,
{72215}{72257}I'd love to know what yours was.
{72259}{72329}Here's mine, my daughter's, that is:
{72330}{72387}My stack it thick and quick
{72389}{72451}Snack until I'm sick sandwich
{72520}{72580}Dear Don'tha, I love your entry.
{72582}{72650}You have a true gift|for inner rhyme and alliteration.
{72652}{72765}I was particularly impressed by your|cross-rhyming with "stack" and "snack."
{72767}{72813}Here's my entry, for what it's worth:
{72814}{72865}My frisk the Frigidaire
{72866}{72925}Clean the cupboards bare sandwich
{72994}{73081}Dear Evelyn,|those judges judged right.
{73083}{73132}No wonder I came in second.
{73134}{73207}Talk about a gift for imagery.|You have it, gal.
{73209}{73278}And you must come to my house|for an Affadaisies meeting.
{73280}{73344}We've got the creme de la creme|of contesters.
{73346}{73427}Gladys Tierney,|she is smart as a whip
{73429}{73509}and won two cars in the|Stay-Puft his and hers contest.
{73511}{73569}Then there's Betty Yearling|and Betty White.
{73571}{73610}Cooks extraordinaire.
{73612}{73718}Betty Y. Is a Pillsbury bake-off winner|with her famous party pork barbeque.
{73720}{73790}Betty W. Won first place|in the Midwest kitchen cook-off
{73792}{73861}with her double delight strawberry cake.
{73862}{73921}And Emma Hartzler,|who's won three fridges
{73923}{73993}and matching stoves|and a trip to Hawaii.
{73994}{74047}All from her iron lung.
{74049}{74121}Kleenex is so handy,|I use it every day.
{74123}{74204}Cost so little, helps so much,
{74206}{74270}just blow, then throw away.
{74272}{74308}Now, listen, Evelyn Ryan.
{74310}{74392}You are the most notable of us all|and you must be at my house
{74394}{74455}in two weeks for the first meeting|of the spring.
{74457}{74490}No excuses.
{74492}{74560}Now strap on those wings|and fly on over here.
{74771}{74859}Do you remember that group|of contesters I told you about?
{74875}{74927}They've invited me to their meeting.
{74973}{75028}- Where is it?|- Over in Payne.
{75054}{75117}- Payne's a long way.|- It's only 85 miles.
{75119}{75170}Yeah, but it still takes gas.
{75187}{75283}I gotta drive to work,|drive you to the grocery store,
{75299}{75342}drive the garbage to the dump...
{75363}{75435}How much do you think I'm left|with at the end of the week?
{75436}{75491}In fact, I had to enter a football pool
{75493}{75562}at the gas station just|to win myself some extra fuel.
{75563}{75646}- You're contesting?|- Yeah.
{75648}{75707}- Why not?|- You need any hints?
{75719}{75766}I know how to do a pool.
{75780}{75870}Well, if you win, you'd have|enough gas to drive me to Payne.
{75900}{75966}I can'tjust sit in the car
{75967}{76039}while you gab|with a bunch ofjingle writers
{76040}{76094}and forget I'm even there.
{76120}{76191}My Saturdays are precious to me.
{76193}{76251}Well, all right. I won't ask again.
{76511}{76581}- That was my entry.|- No, it wasn't. It was mine.
{76583}{76651}Mom, I won 25 gallons|of gas today in a football pool.
{76652}{76726}- He didn't win. That was my entry.|- I used Barb's name.
{76728}{76805}- Barb Ryan was the one that won.|- That was my Barb Ryan.
{76807}{76855}- I had dibs on her name first.|- Says who?
{76857}{76915}We made an agreement.|I got Barb, Tuff and Mike.
{76916}{76981}- I never said you could use my name.|- Don't get smart.
{76983}{77054}- Did you write this down?|- It was a gentlemen's agreement.
{77056}{77093}You'll have to split the gas.
{77095}{77147}He didn't know|about the contest until...
{77149}{77202}What are you talking about? I told you!
{77203}{77248}Split the gas.
{77333}{77381}Oh, for Christ's sake.
{77506}{77607}- I hope you were telling the truth.|- Honest, Dad's just a sore loser.
{77608}{77659}All right. I'd like to ask you a favor.
{77661}{77723}I want to go somewhere.
{77725}{77759}Would you drive me?
{77779}{77842}Sure, Mom. I'll take you|anywhere you want to go.
{77843}{77902}Thank you.
{77940}{78052}There's tuna fish for sandwiches|and you'll find coleslaw in the fridge.
{78054}{78120}- What are you doing?|- Just checking the radiator.
{78122}{78172}Come on, Dad.|We're ready to go.
{78174}{78231}And if your father|decides to make his chili,
{78232}{78274}make sure he doesn't burn the pot.
{78275}{78318}Right. Yeah, I got it.
{78319}{78373}Plenty of water, oil's fine.
{78394}{78427}Watch the clutch.
{78429}{78511}- I know, Pop.|- Get your mother back in one piece.
{78545}{78586}Bye.
{78681}{78726}Bye, Mom.
{78727}{78799}- Bye, sweetie.|- Have fun.
{78800}{78843}- Thank you.|- Mommy, wait.
{78845}{78920}- What is it?|- I got a surprise for you.
{78922}{78974}You did? Show me.
{79064}{79171}Oh, honey.|Where did you get these?
{79173}{79260}They grow all over.|I got them from Mrs. Bidlack's yard,
{79262}{79346}and Mrs. Zitfeld's, and Mrs. Zamone.
{79348}{79407}Cripes' sakes,|what did you go and go that for?
{79417}{79508}Jesus. Sorry, Mother.|I'm not good with that woman.
{79595}{79670}- Turn off the motor.|- Oh, brother.
{79727}{79771}Oh, my God. My sweet God.
{79772}{79810}Did you see what your boy did?
{79811}{79855}I am so sorry.
{79857}{79930}- Why would you do that?|- He didn't know it was wrong.
{79932}{80011}He's just a little boy.|Tell me what I can do to make it better.
{80013}{80111}There is nothing. Do you know how long|I've waited for those tulips to bud?
{80113}{80171}Tell me what they cost,|I'll reimburse you.
{80173}{80262}- $40 worth of bulbs.|- Mom, are we going or not?
{80263}{80326}No, honey, I'm afraid the trip is off.
{80328}{80404}My gas is already in Dad's car.|How am I going to get that out?
{80406}{80494}Tell him to use his half now|and you'll use your half later.
{80495}{80566}I didn't know it was bad.
{80567}{80618}I thought they were beautiful.
{80619}{80679}They are beautiful.
{80681}{80745}They truly are.
{80772}{80819}All right.
{80838}{80899}Now let's go make amends.
{80901}{80936}Good boy.
{81553}{81594}Give it gas.
{81712}{81783}OK, put it in first and try again.
{81880}{81931}Nice and easy.
{81980}{82015}What are you doing?
{82017}{82087}- Stop yelling.|- I'm not yelling. You're not listening.
{82088}{82158}Evelyn, we are all thrilled|and elated to hear
{82159}{82210}that daughter Tuff|has learned to drive
{82212}{82267}and she'll be|delivering you to us, at last.
{82269}{82339}We've moved our meetings|to Emma's in Goshen, Indiana,
{82341}{82388}which is 100 miles from where you are.
{82390}{82430}Sorry it's such a hike.
{82432}{82506}But our gal is eager|to show off her new summer outfit.
{82508}{82577}Evelyn, I await your arrival...
{82614}{82659}...with bated breath.
{82660}{82698}There's bologna for lunch.
{82700}{82767}If I'm not back for dinner,|heat up some fish sticks,
{82768}{82807}there's Jell-O in the fridge.
{82809}{82862}- Yep.|- Mom, we should probably get going.
{82863}{82919}All right, off we go.
{82947}{83001}- Don't overuse the brakes.|- You told me.
{83003}{83061}- No speeding.|- This car barely goes over 40.
{83063}{83155}- I want your mother back in one piece.|- That's enough.
{83156}{83206}Miss you already.
{83208}{83260}- Bye, Mommy.|- Bye, Betsy.
{83262}{83295}I love you.
{83324}{83356}Bye, Davey.
{83376}{83420}- Bye, Mom.|- Bye, Barb.
{83422}{83494}- You have fun.|- Be good. Listen to your father.
{83496}{83570}- Be good.|- Bye, Mommy. Bye, Tuff.
{83623}{83708}More gas.
{83710}{83751}Bye.
{83865}{83926}Well, what do you|want to do now, kids?
{84051}{84131}Defiance, a nice place to leave.
{84331}{84405}Honey, you can drive|a little faster now.
{85002}{85030}Oh, my goodness.
{85100}{85154}We've crossed the state line.
{85174}{85229}Doesn't look any different.
{85231}{85307}The grass is much greener on this side.
{85309}{85367}It is much greener.
{85514}{85557}Oh, boy.
{85642}{85714}You can relax, honey.|You're doing just fine.
{85800}{85887}Gonna be hot today. The girls will|have to wipe me off the floorboards.
{85889}{85959}Yeah, I'm starting to broil.
{86011}{86058}Doesn't feel that hot outside.
{86060}{86131}- Do we have the heater on?|- No.
{86132}{86176}Let me put the fan on.
{86233}{86298}That's even worse. Turn it off.
{86407}{86459}I think the car's overheated.
{86478}{86559}- Oh, my Scott.|- Maybe we should pull over.
{86602}{86682}There's a town in a few miles.|I'm sure there's a gas station.
{86683}{86758}I don't think we're supposed|to drive when the engine's hot.
{86760}{86797}I say we keep going.
{86830}{86892}Car's gonna be just fine.
{87233}{87286}- Hello?|- Ma'am.
{87395}{87454}- Overheated?|- Yes.
{87520}{87594}Fan belt's gone. When's the|last time you had it replaced?
{87596}{87658}Oh, I don't know.|It's my husband's car.
{87660}{87722}How long will it take to fix?
{87724}{87827}Take at least an hour for the radiator|to cool down enough for me to open it.
{87840}{87885}After that, who knows.
{87887}{87926}Depends on what the damage is.
{87928}{87966}Make yourself at home.
{87967}{88066}Alrighty. Well, come on, Tuff.|I'll buy you a pop.
{88143}{88235}I bet Dad knew that fan belt was rotten|and didn't replace it on purpose.
{88236}{88293}Oh, honey,
{88295}{88358}your father's careless|but he's not mean.
{88359}{88424}I'm sure he just|didn't bother to check.
{88543}{88607}Do you ever wish|you'd never married him?
{88609}{88668}My gosh, Tuff.
{88690}{88721}Do you?
{88999}{89084}- No, I don't have any regrets.|- Come on, Mom.
{89086}{89142}You've been stuck|in a house for 20 years
{89143}{89211}cooking and cleaning|and taking care of crappy kids.
{89212}{89282}Don't use that word.|Especially in regards to yourself.
{89283}{89355}But you could be living in a city,|writing for a newspaper,
{89356}{89396}having an interesting life.
{89398}{89450}I do have an interesting life.
{89452}{89497}Your life stinks.
{89499}{89546}Gosh, Mom, just look at today.
{89547}{89654}You finally get a chance to go somewhere|and the lousy car breaks down.
{89656}{89695}It's not fair.
{89697}{89747}If I were you,|I'd be angry all the time.
{89749}{89822}Well, that wouldn't do me|any good now, would it?
{89823}{89892}For gosh sakes, you're only human.
{89894}{89956}Oh, sweetheart.
{90042}{90102}Maybe I'm meant|to make it to the Affadaisies,
{90135}{90191}and maybe I'm not.
{90202}{90290}But right now,|I'm sitting here in the shade
{90292}{90378}having a conversation|with my wonderfully feisty daughter,
{90379}{90485}and I intend to enjoy|this moment to the fullest.
{90487}{90601}And I suggest,|for your own well-being,
{90603}{90677}that you do the same.
{91355}{91411}Don'tha Schaefer, is that really you?
{91412}{91473}Oh, honey, get into these arms.
{91475}{91550}Yes, virginia, there is an Evelyn Ryan!|Oh, look at you.
{91576}{91643}I can't believe it, hello!
{91658}{91751}Welcome to Emma's Ranch|for housework escapees!
{91753}{91810}Oh, God, it's so good to see you.
{91811}{91872}Thank you for delivering|your mother to us.
{91874}{91933}- No problem.|- You have no idea what this means.
{91935}{92012}Now, you come in too.|That was a big, long drive for you.
{92014}{92097}- Sure was.|- New driver. Congratulations.
{92099}{92173}Look who we found outside on the curb.
{92175}{92247}We got a stray bird|back in the nest, girls.
{92249}{92327}Evelyn Ryan, as I live...|and breathe.
{92329}{92423}Emma Hartzler, you are a vision.
{92424}{92495}She looks like a giant corn|on the cob, doesn't she?
{92513}{92619}I finally found my soul mates|with the Affadaisies.
{92621}{92705}They were the sharpest|group of gals I'd ever met.
{92707}{92780}We mostly talked shop,|and critiqued each other's work.
{92782}{92846}- Evelyn, you get on over here.|- Here I come.
{92847}{92897}With Pillsbury, rhyme doesn't pay.
{92899}{92936}Only if it's in verse.
{92938}{93003}But inner rhyme is still valid,|don't you think?
{93071}{93133}If you spell Pillsbury flour|like the bud,
{93135}{93206}and not the baking kind,|then you've got a homophone
{93208}{93245}and don't... need the rhyme.
{93247}{93280}Oh, love it!
{93282}{93339}- What's super potato salad?|- Pickle juice.
{93351}{93428}What's the consensus on hyphenated words|for 25 words or less?
{93430}{93506}Technically, it is one word.|Don't trustjudges to know that.
{93508}{93555}They count a contraction as two words.
{93557}{93659}I'm in trouble. I'll have|to knock off a couple of articles.
{93660}{93731}Why waste space on an article?|Use something with zest.
{93733}{93798}"The" and "antidisestablishmentarianism"
{93800}{93880}are both one word,|but which one packs the bigger punch?
{93899}{93954}What?
{93955}{94003}Anti-what?
{94005}{94087}Did anyone else just hear|that word come out of her mouth?
{94154}{94206}This is why she wins the big prizes.
{94207}{94267}Can you sing that?|Let's hear what it sounds like.
{94268}{94343}We debated whether our days|as contesters were coming to an end.
{94345}{94468}Did you see this?|No skill involved.
{94470}{94528}This is the death of literacy, ladies.
{94530}{94595}I don't want to hear that.|It'll never happen.
{94664}{94737}This is the last big contest.|Everybody snapped these up.
{94739}{94776}I got you the last one.
{94778}{94835}Oh, no, you keep it.
{94837}{94913}Honey, you've got more kids at home.|Now, you take that.
{94953}{94983}OK?
{95124}{95176}So, what do you have to do for this one?
{95178}{95275}Oh, it's a one-liner.|They want you to finish a limerick.
{95277}{95318}"The time of your life you can win
{95319}{95367}with Dr. Pepper, the flavor that's in.
{95369}{95455}It's distinctive and bright,|it's lively and light.
{95507}{95577}There's no time like now to begin."
{95606}{95657}Oh, leave me alone.|I'm just warming up.
{95845}{95923}- Evening, Rita, Nancy.|- It was a hot one today.
{95925}{95977}There was a wonderful breeze in Goshen.
{95979}{96025}Well, it was a hot one here today.
{96051}{96114}Five minutes to supper, sweetheart.
{96131}{96196}Oh, for Pete's sake.|Who locked the door?
{96198}{96298}- Hey, you guys, let us in.|- Honey, let's go around the back.
{96299}{96340}Row row row your boat
{96342}{96386}Gently down the stream
{96387}{96471}Throw your dad overboard|and listen to him scream
{96473}{96525}Mom's home!
{96527}{96598}What are you kids doing outside?
{96600}{96655}Well, we went|to the movies this afternoon.
{96657}{96718}When we got back,|Dad locked us out of the house.
{96719}{96788}He what?
{96790}{96823}Kelly!
{96885}{96915}Open the door!
{97064}{97138}- Where the hell have you been?|- I told you, I might be late.
{97139}{97210}- Not this late.|- You locked your kids out of the house?
{97211}{97280}Good grief!|Tuff set the table, please.
{97282}{97327}You left at the crack of dawn.
{97329}{97378}You don't come back|until almost dark.
{97379}{97424}What were you doing all this time?
{97426}{97477}I was gone for ten hours.
{97479}{97556}If you can't take care of your kids|for less than half a day,
{97558}{97603}you might as well leave this house.
{97604}{97651}You can goddamn be the one to leave.
{97653}{97710}Get off of my mother!
{97955}{98023}"For picnic or party, Jell-O's a boon.
{98025}{98087}Made by nine, all set by noon.
{98089}{98150}With taste and shimmer-shake appeal,
{98151}{98236}Jell-O jollies any meal."
{98499}{98559}Christ, Mother.
{98560}{98600}You've killed me.
{98602}{98651}Death by Jell-O is highly unlikely.
{98653}{98719}And I want you to know,|I am not cleaning up this mess.
{98775}{98816}Could you get me some towels?
{98818}{98882}Not on your life.|She's not cleaning up after you.
{98884}{98946}Now kids, go ahead|and watch Tv while I make dinner.
{98974}{99006}Go on.
{99141}{99226}By the way,|the fan belt fell off the car
{99227}{99272}and that is why we are so late.
{99311}{99361}Yeah, I was waiting for that to happen.
{99440}{99470}What's this?
{99498}{99567}Steak. I went shopping today.
{99569}{99616}I wanted to make a dinner for the kids.
{99618}{99651}Why didn't you feed them?
{99652}{99726}I was crying|and didn't want them to see me.
{99728}{99775}Why on earth were you crying?
{99797}{99871}I thought you decided|to go away and never come back.
{99904}{99995}For goodness sakes. You know|I'd never leave the kids with you.
{100165}{100206}I got you something too.
{100229}{100281}It was supposed to be a surprise.
{100294}{100339}It's in there.
{100377}{100418}Here you go.
{100434}{100484}I found it at a secondhand store.
{100486}{100552}I paid a guy at the shop to fix it up.
{100572}{100645}It is the most beautiful thing|I have ever seen.
{100661}{100769}I thought it was about time|you had a proper desk.
{100771}{100818}How did you pay for it?
{100820}{100886}Oh, don't you worry about that.
{100948}{101003}Thank you.
{101055}{101091}I love you.
{101459}{101522}- Hello?|- Hello, Mrs. Ryan?
{101523}{101621}It's Cutter Murphy, down here|at Defiance Home Saving and Loan.
{101623}{101683}Just a friendly reminder
{101685}{101776}to let you know that the second mortgage|is coming due on your house.
{101778}{101868}Mr. Murphy, we've never|taken out a second mortgage.
{101870}{101906}Oh yes, you did.
{101908}{101971}Yes, Mr. Ryan|came down here three years ago
{101973}{102032}and signed the papers.
{102034}{102076}How much do we owe?
{102078}{102210}$4,000, due in 30 days.
{102242}{102280}See ya, fellas.
{102600}{102686}Hello, Mother.|What are you doing out here?
{102687}{102759}When were you gonna tell me|about the second mortgage?
{102882}{102923}It's due?
{102964}{103044}I had a feeling that day|might be coming up.
{103046}{103092}Is there anything left?
{103114}{103152}I was gonna pay it back
{103154}{103235}without anyone ever knowing about it.
{103320}{103379}Is there anything left?
{103416}{103456}No.
{103490}{103556}It's all... gone.
{103734}{103818}They're gonna repossess the house.
{103937}{104003}Do the kids know?
{104005}{104064}I told them as soon as I got the call.
{104066}{104171}I didn't want them|to hear it from anybody else.
{104218}{104260}Are they angry with me?
{104283}{104339}Right now they're just scared.
{104375}{104458}Guess we could|always rent another place.
{104459}{104563}At least we wouldn't have|to worry about repairs anymore.
{104565}{104615}This is my house.
{104635}{104676}My house.
{104812}{104856}I just...
{104899}{104953}...felt like a drowning man.
{104955}{105042}Never being able to catch up...
{105044}{105093}I just wanted, for once,
{105126}{105184}to have a few extra|dollars in my pocket.
{105298}{105367}Well, that's water|under the bridge now, isn't it?
{105390}{105419}Where you going?
{105422}{105482}I have to make dinner.
{105516}{105577}Do you hate me?
{105615}{105684}I'm still in shock.|I'll have to let you know.
{105963}{106026}We need to talk about what will happen
{106027}{106077}if we have to leave this house.
{106079}{106135}We may not be able to stay together.
{106137}{106174}What do you mean?
{106176}{106250}Aunt Lucy said she|could take Betsy and Dave.
{106263}{106324}You kids like the farm, don't ya?
{106326}{106387}No, I don't.
{106389}{106474}What about that old horse of theirs?|You love that horse.
{106475}{106537}I really don't.
{106539}{106608}- Where am I gonna go?|- Mrs. Bidlack has an extra room.
{106610}{106664}There is no way in heck|I am staying with her.
{106666}{106738}You'll be right next door.|It'll be like living here.
{106739}{106804}No it won't.|There'll be another family here.
{106806}{106863}There will be someone|sleeping in my room!
{107083}{107172}- How's that steak, kids?|- Don't be rude, answer your father.
{107299}{107349}It's good, Daddy.
{107351}{107423}Well, it's the last one, eat up.
{108391}{108430}What are you kids doing?
{108447}{108528}We're praying that you|win something very big.
{108562}{108598}All right.
{108653}{108703}Don't let me disturb you.
{108936}{108983}Times are hard again?
{108984}{109046}Yes, they are.
{109047}{109111}I'll tell you what.
{109113}{109210}I'll leave you the milk, you don't|have to pay me until next week.
{109245}{109283}Thank you, Ray.
{109285}{109326}Thank you so much.
{109359}{109433}I got a bag of laundry in the truck,|just a couple of shirts.
{109435}{109474}You know, if you do a good job,
{109476}{109532}I could even recommend you|to my customers.
{109571}{109621}I don't take in laundry.
{109646}{109695}Could somebody please get that?
{109697}{109759}Hey, I'm just trying|to do you a favor, OK?
{109761}{109832}- Don't get uppity.|- I have enough for two bottles of milk,
{109834}{109878}and that will have to suffice.
{109879}{109948}Mommy, it's the detective from Toledo.
{109950}{110022}A detective?|There's nothing more I can do for you.
{110024}{110105}Count out the money|for the milkman, please.
{110203}{110234}More.
{110287}{110325}- Hello?|- Mrs. Evelyn Ryan?
{110327}{110354}Yes, this is she.
{110356}{110449}I'm interviewing finalists for the|Dr. Pepper "Time of Your Life" contest.
{110451}{110507}- Of course.|- Will you be in this afternoon?
{110508}{110541}Yes, certainly.
{110543}{110594}- 3:00?|- That'll be fine.
{110595}{110680}- Do you have our address?|- Yes, I do. That's my job.
{110682}{110718}Right. We'll see you then.
{110719}{110778}- I look forward to it.|- Thank you.
{110779}{110827}What? What is it?
{110829}{110869}- What's going on?|- Get out here!
{110871}{110927}It's way too soon to be excited,
{110928}{110988}- but I am a possible winner...|- What is it?
{110990}{111071}Kelly, a detective is on his way|to Defiance right now.
{111073}{111141}I'm in the running|for the "Time of Your Life" contest.
{111143}{111199}- Is this a big one?|- It's very big.
{111200}{111267}We need to clean up. Pick up your toys.
{111269}{111319}Get all that stuff off the table.
{111321}{111407}Give Mike some money, send him|to the store for some Dr. Pepper.
{111409}{111448}What for?
{111450}{111506}To show that we're using the product.
{111507}{111590}This is my last dollar.|What if we don't win?
{111592}{111648}- That's a problem for another day.|- Go, Mike.
{111650}{111735}- Get it from the refrigerator case.|- OK, Mom.
{111737}{111815}Take all this stuff|and put it on the back porch.
{111817}{111912}Stop crying, honey,|and get me a broom for goodness sake.
{112080}{112145}Are you employed outside the home?
{112147}{112230}Goodness, no. I have enough to do here.
{112259}{112307}And your husband, what does he do?
{112309}{112375}He's a machinist.
{112388}{112474}Do you own or... rent your home?
{112475}{112535}We own it.
{112536}{112610}One car or a two car family?
{112611}{112652}One car. A Chevy.
{112654}{112732}- The one parked out front?|- Yes.
{112734}{112798}You need to put|some more air into those tires.
{112847}{112909}OK, final question.
{112941}{112992}If you were stuck on a desert island
{112994}{113066}and you only|had one beverage to drink...
{113103}{113160}...what would the beverage be?
{113221}{113254}Orange juice.
{113255}{113303}Orange juice?
{113338}{113373}To prevent scurvy.
{113375}{113452}But my beverage of choice|is Dr. Pepper, of course.
{113513}{113596}- Thanks for the honesty.|- A pleasure, Detective Feeney.
{113598}{113649}When the final decision's made,
{113651}{113705}you'll be notified immediately.
{113777}{113862}- And when might that be?|- Two weeks to a month.
{113863}{113908}Oh, I see.
{113910}{114018}- Thank you for coming by.|- The pleasure's all mine.
{114136}{114167}Orange juice.
{114169}{114233}What kind of crazy answer was that?
{114255}{114350}I think your mother did a heck of a job,|what do you think, kids?
{114351}{114426}- What if we win and it's too late?|- What's with the gloom?
{114427}{114458}We're halfway there.
{114459}{114550}Mom, will me and Davey|still have to go to the farm?
{114551}{114637}We don't know yet, honey.|It's something we have to prepare for.
{114639}{114704}Don't listen to Mom.|She's being modest.
{114706}{114778}None of those entries|are as good as hers. She's a shoo-in.
{114780}{114860}I'm not a shoo-in. There could|be 20 other people up for this.
{114862}{114923}Don't worry, kids.|Everything is gonna be OK.
{114925}{114992}No, it isn't.|Even if we do win, so what?
{114994}{115034}We'll be as poor as we were before
{115035}{115090}because of all|the money you stole from us.
{115091}{115133}I didn't steal anything!
{115135}{115188}I made an error in judgment.
{115190}{115233}Heck of an error.
{115235}{115291}You all think this|isn't tearing me apart?
{115292}{115394}I did it to pay the bills.|I wanted you kids to eat steak.
{115395}{115468}I wanted your mother to have|one decent piece of furniture
{115470}{115523}that didn't look like a thrift store.
{115525}{115564}I don't care!
{115566}{115635}- I want our house back!|- It isn't gone yet!
{115636}{115699}So, have a little faith,|for Christ's sake.
{115788}{115848}Now you've upset your mother.
{115973}{116007}You OK?
{116282}{116344}If you don't win this one,|there'll be another...
{116346}{116415}No, there won't.
{116417}{116508}In another year, there won't|be any of these contests left.
{116510}{116574}If we lose this house, that's it.
{116595}{116687}I can't buy another house with|a three-dollar poetry prize, now can I?
{116762}{116829}- You'll think of something.|- You think of something!
{116831}{116918}It's your turn to make things right|because I'm out of ideas.
{116971}{117063}- Please don't fall apart.|- For God's sakes, I'm not a saint.
{117095}{117166}If you can't stand|to see me upset, then go away.
{117167}{117217}Let me do it in peace.
{117355}{117391}All right.
{118620}{118661}Thanks.
{118706}{118788}Mom, there are bugs in the soup.
{118790}{118847}- I have them too.|- Me too.
{118935}{119012}- Those aren't bugs. They're spices.|- They have legs.
{119014}{119074}Don't be silly.|Spices don't have legs.
{119187}{119242}There are no bugs in the soup.
{119259}{119301}Listen to your mother, kids.
{119767}{119815}- Hello?|- Hello. Mrs. Kelly Ryan?
{119817}{119880}- Yes, yes, this is she.|- Congratulations.
{119882}{119957}You have won a free offer|from Bright Way Rug Cleaners.

{120199}{120271}We're not interested, thank you.
{120303}{120338}It's all right.
{120710}{120762}Mommy, what do we do with this?
{120764}{120836}Just put it all on the front porch.|Thank you, girls.
{120884}{120951}Davey, go outside with that.
{121879}{121909}- Hello?|- Hello.
{121911}{121992}- Is this Mrs. Evelyn L. Ryan?|- This is she.
{121994}{122065}Mrs. Ryan, it's my pleasure|to inform you
{122067}{122112}that you are our first-prize winner

{122195}{122226}Oh, my word.

{122281}{122354}a Ford Mustang,|his and hers Longines watches
{122356}{122458}and cash in the amount of $3,440.64.
{122460}{122502}Goodness, well...
{122503}{122589}...these prizes couldn't come|at a better time for my large family.
{122591}{122655}- Kids, get in here!|- I'm glad to hear that.
{122657}{122718}- Come here.|- You have every reason to be proud.
{122720}{122814}Your entry beat out 250,000 others.
{122815}{122875}Thank you for telling me that.
{122876}{122942}You've brightened my day considerably.
{122944}{123003}Thank you, Mrs. Ryan. Good day.
{123061}{123099}We won!
{123365}{123408}Mom, can we go tell the neighbors?
{123410}{123456}You can tell whoever you want!
{123755}{123811}Tuffy, it's OK.
{123813}{123884}Everything's going to be OK.|We're all going to be OK.
{123886}{123958}No, we aren't.
{124006}{124085}- For cripe's sake.|- You go outside, I'll take care of her.
{124120}{124197}Come on, let's go tell everybody.|Come on.
{124287}{124338}We won! We won the big contest!
{124510}{124571}He's never gonna change.
{124573}{124630}You're absolutely right.
{124656}{124694}He's not.
{124811}{124903}Do you know what that man said to me|on the phone just now?
{124904}{124938}No.
{124939}{125049}He said that I beat|250,000 other entries.
{125083}{125132}And do you know what else?
{125154}{125207}It wasn't even my best one.
{125283}{125315}Honey...
{125345}{125412}Honey, you have your|whole life in front of you,
{125414}{125500}and you can make|of it whatever you want.
{125516}{125576}You have a marvelous mind.
{125611}{125658}And a beautiful heart.
{125705}{125769}And you can accomplish anything.
{125811}{125879}Everything is possible.
{125880}{125930}Do you know that?
{126143}{126190}Forgive him.
{126252}{126321}Forgive him so you can embrace this...
{126334}{126396}...truly remarkable day.
{126739}{126800}I love you, Mom.
{126884}{126927}I love you.
{127656}{127703}I never made it to Switzerland.
{127704}{127776}Naturally, I cashed in the trip|to pay off the mortgage.
{127807}{127885}However, I did get my chance to travel.
{127898}{127991}To Dallas, Texas where Dr. Pepper|made me their own queen for a day.
{128016}{128064}However, I was annoyed by the hat,
{128066}{128127}as my hair was flattened|for the rest of the day.
{128167}{128242}It was the first time I ate|a meal I didn't have to cook,
{128244}{128303}on a plate that I didn't have to wash.
{128335}{128427}Or soaked in a tub|that I didn't have to scrub.
{128428}{128552}Or slept in a bed|that I didn't have to make.
{128554}{128625}I never won another|major contest after that.
{128643}{128739}Nor did I ever travel much|beyond the Ohio-lndiana state line.
{128837}{128868}Drive safely.
{128870}{128938}But I'm happy to report|that every one of my children
{128939}{129002}got the chance|to see the world beyond.
{129072}{129126}I saw them off to California,
{129127}{129181}Colorado, virginia,
{129199}{129243}Texas, Florida,
{129256}{129291}New York.
{129293}{129355}I've watched them|graduate college, play ball,
{129357}{129412}practice nursing, practice law.
{129414}{129456}Bye, Mom.
{129517}{129619}And yes, some of them|have even written books.
{129860}{129961}My husband, Kelly, bless his soul,|found his peace, at last.
{129963}{130074}He left a legacy of atonement|that, frankly, took my breath away.
{130096}{130169}He deposited his pension|checks in a secret account
{130171}{130248}that he had opened just for me.
{130263}{130342}I never had to worry|about earning another nickel again.
{130467}{130555}- Does anyone want these?|- You can have it.
{130557}{130618}When it was my time|to take leave of this world,
{130620}{130694}all my chicks were there to see me off.
{130695}{130747}It was a lovely day, indeed.
{130969}{131057}Tuff, you want to take Mom's typewriter?
{131728}{131776}Oh, my goodness.
{131778}{131836}I believe this was|the last thing I ever wrote.
{131876}{131953}"Every time I pass the church,|I stop and make a visit.
{131955}{132005}So when I'm carried in feet first,
{132007}{132073}God won't say, 'Who is it?"'
{132106}{132152}Well, it's not my best.
{132154}{132204}But the sentiment is right.
{132254}{132354}
