COPYING BEETHOVEN (2006)

3
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:18,780
Anna...

4
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:22,380
Oh, you're awake.

5
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,100
I was waiting for you.

6
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,900
The fugue, Maestro, I heard it.
I heard it just the way you do.

7
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,699
I knew. I hoped you would.

8
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:42,700
Rudy, get the doctor.

9
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:48,779
Calm yourself.

10
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:50,180
Morning.

11
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,659
The storm, I hear the storm.

12
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,139
He's coming for me.

13
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,499
Don't be frightened.

14
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,619
Do not weep.

15
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,818
- Morning.
- Yes.

16
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,499
Maestro?

17
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,378
Herr Schlemmer?

18
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,818
- Herr Schlemmer?
Oh, I have to pee, my dear.

19
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:40,697
I'm afraid there is a mistake.

20
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:46,978
I've come from the conservatory.
I received this note.

21
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,496
How did you get this?

22
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,817
You sent it to Dr. Rauch requesting
his brightest composition student.

23
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:55,297
He was kind enough to send me.

24
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:59,297
You said you needed a copyist
as a matter of great urgency.

25
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:02,216
But. . . But you're a woman.

26
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:06,297
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, God. Help me up, please.

27
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:25,497
I used to be a strong man.
I hunted boar in the forest.

28
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,977
Now this is all that's left.

29
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,977
Now, you must go back to Rauch.
Tell him to send someone else.

30
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:36,617
But you insisted on his best student.

31
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,137
And forgive me, Herr Schlemmer,

32
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:40,736
I may be a woman
but I am the best student.

33
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:44,456
I'm certainly capable of any
copying tasks you may have.

34
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:46,375
Do you know why you're here?

35
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:49,536
Do you know whom we're talking about?

36
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,096
No, Dr. Rauch didn't explain.

37
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,976
- The Beast.
- The Beast?

38
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:56,616
Beethoven.

39
00:07:57,217 --> 00:08:02,216
They're premiering his Ninth Symphony
and the parts are not ready.

40
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:05,096
- What remains to be done?
- The chorale.

41
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:08,296
Can you imagine?
A chorale in a symphony?

42
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:09,176
How many voices?

43
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:14,176
Four soloists and a chorus,
and they don't sing until the end.

44
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:18,895
They just stand there waiting,
hundreds of them, for an hour.

45
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:22,655
- He's utterly losing his mind.
- When is the premiere?

46
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:24,375
Four days time.

47
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:29,735
This cancer is a gift from God.
Death will be a vacation.

48
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:33,376
Herr Schlemmer, from what I understand,
there is really no time to waste.

49
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:35,775
The premiere is Sunday,
you have no copyist.

50
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,896
I really should get to work right away.

51
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:43,815
On my desk. That pile.
That's part of the chorale.

52
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,974
This is his handwriting? This. . .

53
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:53,455
Schlemmer?
- Oh, my God, it's him!

54
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,535
Get away, get away.

55
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,215
Schlemmer, where are you?
What are you doing?

56
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:58,935
I'm dying, Maestro.

57
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:03,054
And I am on the cross!
God in heaven, why am I abused this way?

58
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:05,655
You will not drive nails into me, not you !

59
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:09,295
B flat, B flat, B flat!

60
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,814
Moron!

61
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:15,134
Oh, my God.

62
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:16,534
You will do it all over again.

63
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:19,654
You will bring it to me, you personally,
to my apartment,

64
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:21,694
or I'll kill you, Schlemmer!

65
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:24,294
I'll destroy you !

66
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:34,655
Herr Schlemmer?
I will go.

67
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:37,974
- You're in no condition.
- I must go.

68
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:42,693
- Please, calm yourself. I'll go.
- Oh, yes, you go.

69
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:45,934
That makes much more sense.
I'll stay here.

70
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:50,494
But first, we must attend to this.
He will be expecting this.

71
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:58,812
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Ludwig van Beethoven.

72
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:28,172
He can't hear you.
He's deaf, you know. Just go in.

73
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:29,091
Thank you.

74
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:23,811
- Your corrected copy, Maestro.
- My dear girl, what is it?

75
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,011
What?

76
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,291
The corrected copy that you asked
of Herr Schlemmer this morning.

77
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:29,170
Copy?

78
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:31,251
That you asked
of Herr Schlemmer this morning.

79
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,690
Oh, yeah. Poor Schlemmer.

80
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:36,970
I do hope he's coming.
I owe him an apology.

81
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,771
No, I'm afraid he is too ill. He sent me.

82
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:43,291
Too ill, you say? Well, thank you.

83
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:47,091
I'm working, as you see,
as you no doubt heard.

84
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:53,210
A hood helps to concentrate the sound.
The vibrations, I feel the vibrations.

85
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:59,850
Here, I want you to take these to Schlemmer.

86
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:05,011
Tell him that I must have someone
to work with me here.

87
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,170
That is why he sent me, Maestro,
to work with you.

88
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,090
What?

89
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:11,970
I am the one
he sent to work with you.

90
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:13,170
Mercy.

91
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,051
- You old letch. He sent you, did he?
- Yes.

92
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:18,130
Now, you go back, my sweet girl.

93
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,530
Tell Schlemmer I'm going out
for my dinner,

94
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:22,370
and when I get back,
I expect a copyist to be here.

95
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,690
I told you, that is why I am here.

96
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,970
- What?
- That is why I'm here, Maestro.

97
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,690
You're serious, aren't you?

98
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,050
If you will look at the pages
I copied for you this morning,

99
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,530
- you will see that I am fully qualified to. . .
- How could he do this to me?

100
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:39,370
I'm not a well man.
I've rheumatism, gout, water on the lungs.

101
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,130
You were saying something.

102
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:42,689
Never speak to me
when my back is turned.

103
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,090
What were you saying?

104
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,129
I was asking you to read
the pages I copied.

105
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,369
Read the pages. All right, I'll do that.
I'll read the pages.

106
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,289
Nice, very good.

107
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:03,529
What's this?

108
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,449
Right before the choir comes in,
B major, D major.

109
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,089
You have it in B minor.

110
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,010
I wrote it in B major.
Why did you change it?

111
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,249
- I didn't change it.
- What?

112
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,809
I didn't change it. I corrected it.

113
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,289
Corrected it? You corrected it?

114
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:23,968
Yes, I knew you didn't intend
to keep it in B major.

115
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:25,009
Really?

116
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,609
Well, the Italians would keep it in B major.

117
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,569
Rossini would keep it in the major,
Cherubini would keep it in the major.

118
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:35,888
But you wouldn't.

119
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,528
You would change it just for a moment,

120
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,888
to build the suspense
before the explosion.

121
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,409
If you will permit me. . .

122
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:13,008
That's neither Rossini or Cherubini.
That's Beethoven.

123
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:19,168
You're saying that
I accidentally miswrote it?

124
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,368
No, Maestro. I think you did it deliberately.

125
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:25,368
- I think it was a trap.
- A track?

126
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:27,207
- A trap.
- A trap?

127
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:31,248
- To test Herr Schlemmer.
- Why on earth would I test Schlemmer?

128
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:34,287
- To see if he truly understood.
- Understood what?

129
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:39,007
- Your soul.
- My soul?

130
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:43,847
- You think it works in the minor?
- Am I wrong?

131
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:45,687
You approve of what I've done?

132
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:48,367
I think it's brilliant.
I think it's all wonderful.

133
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:50,328
- You like it?
- Very, very much.

134
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,367
- How old are you, my dear?
- Twenty-three.

135
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,967
Twenty-three years old.

136
00:15:56,648 --> 00:16:03,167
I can just imagine you at the creation,
with your two decades of experience,

137
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,087
saying to the Almighty,

138
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:09,087
"I think you've done
a brilliant job with the world.

139
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:12,286
"I especially like South America.
Beautiful shape.

140
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,086
"That wonderful bulge
and the slender taper.

141
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:18,766
"The Straits of Magellan,
lovely little touch.

142
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,366
"Africa, on the other hand,
bit wide for my taste.

143
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:24,806
"And Asia is entirely out of proportion.

144
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:28,287
"I'm afraid, Herr Godhead,
you'll have to do it all over. "

145
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:34,286
I cannot tell you how much it means to me

146
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,886
to know that you approve of my work.

147
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,447
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

148
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,966
You must look at me when you speak.

149
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:02,686
- What is your name?
- Anna. Anna Holtz.

150
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:04,606
Anna Holtz.

151
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:11,285
Well, Anna Holtz, I'm going
to Krenski's tavern for my dinner.

152
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:13,686
We can work when I get back.

153
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:18,606
Meanwhile, start on these.

154
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,566
You may put your things over here.

155
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:29,485
Please excuse the condition of my rooms.
I'm a bachelor, you know, without a wife.

156
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:31,325
What an existence.

157
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:36,485
Thank God for my nephew Karl.
He's my whole life, yes.

158
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:38,565
My whole life.

159
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,045
- Have you eaten?
- No.

160
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:43,645
I'll bring you something. Do you like trout?

161
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,965
- Thank you.
- Very good.

162
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:48,004
I'm a very difficult person, Anna Holtz,

163
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:51,285
but I take comfort in the fact
that God made me that way.

164
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,136
<i>Ta là tất cả những gì
hiện hữu, đã có và sẽ có</i>

165
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,234
<i>Chưa kẻ phàm trần nào
hiểu được bí ẩn của ta</i>

166
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:40,324
- Krenski, another.
- Maestro. . .

167
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:43,644
- Come on, I've earned it.
- It's getting late, Louis.

168
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:46,405
- What?
- It's late. Shouldn't you be working?

169
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:49,084
I can't go home.
There's a woman in my apartment.

170
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,564
- Young woman?
- Twenty-three.

171
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:54,604
If I had a 23-year-old girl
waiting in my apartment, I'd never leave.

172
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,243
Will I be seeing you
later tonight, Maestro?

173
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:58,164
- Thank you.
- Not tonight, Magda.

174
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:00,043
He's already got a fish in the fire.

175
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:02,003
Yeah, how about you, Rudy?

176
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:05,363
Oh, Magda, I haven't had a hard-on
since he could hear.

177
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:06,284
What?

178
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:10,683
Rudy. . .

179
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:17,804
This is serious.
She wants to work with me.

180
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:20,923
- Copy my work.
- So let her.

181
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:25,484
Yes, well, it's not just that.
She changed something I wrote.

182
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:30,523
You understand?
She did what I should have done.

183
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:35,083
- Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?
- It's frightening. How did she know?

184
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:43,283
This new symphony, it's my farewell.

185
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:45,843
- You're not that sick.
- No, no, no, no.

186
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:48,043
My farewell to music
as I've always known it,

187
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:49,122
as I've always written it.

188
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:51,163
You've been talking
about that for years, Louis.

189
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:54,042
I'm starting a new chapter in my life.

190
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:55,562
New forms, a new language.

191
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:59,402
And now this woman is sent to me
at this very moment.

192
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:03,002
What if she was sent by him?

193
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:07,482
- Women are usually sent by the other one.
- Well, suppose it's a sign?

194
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:09,243
- A sign for what, Louis?
- That it's time.

195
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:12,123
- A time for what?
- A time for me to join with him.

196
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:17,203
Well, if it's true and she was sent by him,
and she's waiting in your apartment,

197
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:21,082
you shouldn't be sitting here drinking,
should you?

198
00:20:53,842 --> 00:20:54,882
Maestro?

199
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,281
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you upstairs?

200
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:02,401
There are rats in your room. Big rats.

201
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:05,401
Yes, they keep away the cats. I hate cats.

202
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:08,561
- Why?
- They don't make any noise.

203
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:10,282
How long have you been here?

204
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:14,122
- Two hours, maybe.
- Oh, goodness.

205
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:16,641
We won't work tonight.
You come back in the morning.

206
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,080
- I'll get you a cab. You go home now.
- Thank you.

207
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:21,401
- Where do you live?
- The Convent of the Sacred Heart.

208
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:24,721
The Convent of the Sacred Heart.

209
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:27,921
Convent? You live in a convent with nuns?

210
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,561
- Yes.
- They're worse than cats.

211
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:34,002
The mother superior is my great-aunt.

212
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,521
It was the only way my father would
let me come to Vienna to study.

213
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:39,520
To study? What do you study?

214
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,401
- Composition.
- Oh, my God.

215
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,241
A woman composer.

216
00:21:44,242 --> 00:21:46,601
There have been many women composers.

217
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:48,920
Like a dog walking on its hind legs.

218
00:21:48,922 --> 00:21:52,560
It's never done well,
but you're surprised it's done at all.

219
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,360
Driver!

220
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,080
- Take her to the Sacred Heart.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:08,520
I almost forgot. Your trout.

222
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:11,920
- Come tomorrow. Early.
Thank you.

223
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:29,080
- You are aware of the time, Anna?
- I'm sorry, Mother.

224
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,920
- But I have a job.
- A job?

225
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,720
Yes, I'm working with Beethoven.

226
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:35,479
Beethoven, the black Catholic?
He was nearly excommunicated.

227
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,720
Anna, I really don't think this is wise.

228
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:39,960
Excuse me, Mother,
but I can learn a great deal from him.

229
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:43,879
About what?
Drunkenness, profanity, heresy?

230
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,559
How long do you intend
to continue with this job?

231
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:50,760
- Until the premiere of his new symphony.
- I see.

232
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:54,559
Your young man was here today.
I sent him away again.

233
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,239
Anna, your father has entrusted me
with your well-being,

234
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,600
and I take that role very seriously.

235
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,439
I understand, but I am not a child.
I came to Vienna with a purpose.

236
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:09,879
Purposes can change.
I came here to study with Salieri

237
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,719
when he was composer
to the emperor's court.

238
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,920
I wanted to sing with the Paris Opera.

239
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,999
I know what it is to be a girl
who has dreams.

240
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,479
Then perhaps you can find it
in your heart to respect mine.

241
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,079
I'm going to trust you, Anna,
but remember,

242
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,839
dreams can be wonderful,

243
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,519
they can also be dangerous.

244
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,879
Sometimes all the more wonderful
because of the danger.

245
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,799
Thank you. Good night.

246
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,678
Anna?

247
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,679
Martin, are you crazy?

248
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,078
Yes. This is the twelfth window
I've tried, and I must say,

249
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:55,838
there are some very attractive nuns
in this convent.

250
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,039
I couldn't wait to tell you.

251
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,357
Anna, I've been invited to submit
my design for the competition.

252
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:02,518
- The Archduke's competition?
- Yes.

253
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,557
- And if I win, it will make my career. . .
- Martin!

254
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,158
- I have some news, too.
- What?

255
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,238
Can you make it fast?
I can't hang on much longer.

256
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:14,278
- I'm copying Beethoven.
- Beethoven. . .

257
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:19,157
Come tomorrow and see my bridge.

258
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:28,355
All right.

259
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:52,836
- Excuse me, Herr Schlemmer.
- Now, that was Beethoven.

260
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:54,595
Was Beethoven.

261
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:58,755
He wrote it for a young woman, you know.
A young woman named Elise.

262
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:02,874
You see, he was a romantic,
and then something changed.

263
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:05,435
- His deafness?
- No, more than that.

264
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:07,555
It's as if his soul has gone deaf.

265
00:27:08,396 --> 00:27:11,195
He doesn't listen to the public anymore.

266
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,955
The Last Piano Sonatas.
Have you heard them?

267
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:17,874
What is this? You tell me, what is this?

268
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:27,395
Who does he write for nowadays?
It's certainly not for money.

269
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:31,635
I'm lucky if I can get anyone
to pay for his works.

270
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,995
So how am I going to pay for you?

271
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:35,954
I don't mind, Herr Schlemmer. Really.

272
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:38,954
I see this as an opportunity sent from God.

273
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:41,594
To make restitution for your sins?

274
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:44,354
- To show him my work.
- Promise you won't do that.

275
00:27:44,635 --> 00:27:46,354
He'll tear you to pieces.

276
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:51,074
Did you hear what he said to Rossini,
my most popular composer?

277
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:52,514
- What if I have talent?
- Please.

278
00:27:52,516 --> 00:27:55,794
Excuse me, my dear,
but don't show him anything,

279
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:58,994
not before the premiere.
Promise me that much.

280
00:28:00,235 --> 00:28:02,514
I'm off to his apartment now.

281
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:07,554
Tell him he must finish today.
Don't tell him I said that. You tell him.

282
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,433
It may be that he likes you.

283
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:12,153
They're rehearsing
the first three movements now,

284
00:28:12,154 --> 00:28:14,873
and he insists on conducting.

285
00:28:14,874 --> 00:28:17,594
What's he going to do? Lip-read?

286
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,753
- He can't hear the orchestra?
- Oh, the last time he conducted them,

287
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:25,873
he threw them off so badly
they had to start all over again twice.

288
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:28,993
Please, try to convince him not to conduct.

289
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:25,552
Why have we stopped?

290
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:28,233
We start over.

291
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:31,112
- From where, Maestro?
- From the beginning, you idiot!

292
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:21,071
A little higher, please.

293
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:28,671
You won't last long. They never do.

294
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:33,151
Did you empty out the piss pots?
Good girl.

295
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:36,471
He's a filthy old bastard, isn't he?

296
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:39,991
I must say,
you're the prettiest one he's had.

297
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:42,671
- You should really come and work for me.
- Who are you?

298
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:46,111
I'm Karl van Beethoven, the nephew.

299
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:49,190
- You're the one who. . .
- Who what? Ruined his life?

300
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:52,230
Made it impossible for him
to compose for years?

301
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:56,231
The ungrateful little brat
who only borrows money?

302
00:30:56,232 --> 00:30:57,990
Yes, that's me.

303
00:30:57,991 --> 00:31:00,351
I was going to say, the one he dotes on.

304
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:04,590
Dotes on? Yes, in his dotage.

305
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:08,471
- How long have you been working for him?
- Since last night.

306
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,270
It's like that.

307
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:18,590
He usually chooses the more mature,
developed kind.

308
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:24,430
Since I started this job,
I've been mistaken for a nurse,

309
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:26,350
a maid and now a prostitute!

310
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:29,070
- No more!
- Jesus, then what the hell are you?

311
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,509
- I'm his copyist.
- Copyist?

312
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,750
- Yes.
- Then why are you cleaning?

313
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:35,110
Because I can't work
under these conditions,

314
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,150
- and I doubt that he can.
- Are you joking? He lives this way.

315
00:31:38,151 --> 00:31:39,150
- Yes, and you let him.
- Let him?

316
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,150
You can't stop him from doing anything.
He's a force of nature.

317
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:46,789
Just ask my poor mother.
For Christ's sake, ask me.

318
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,829
Trying to force me
to become a pianist, like him.

319
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,469
- What's wrong with being a pianist?
- What's. . . I have no talent.

320
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:59,549
But still he thunders on.
He tears down everything in his path.

321
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,230
He destroys anyone he meets
with his monumental ego.

322
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:05,869
"Oh, I am Ludwig van Beethoven,
and you, you are nothing. "

323
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,870
At least not by the time
he's done with you.

324
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,549
- I will wait for your uncle outside.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry, I'll go.

325
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,229
It is not my place
to make you leave this apartment.

326
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,068
Miss. . .

327
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,669
Holtz.

328
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,108
I'm not what everybody
says about me, Miss Holtz.

329
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,589
He's trying to destroy my mother.

330
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,669
I mean, for years he's kept me from her
so that he could, well, possess me.

331
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,348
Because he loves you.

332
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,508
Yes, but I can't bear it.

333
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:40,269
Everybody is used to
being despised by him.

334
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,869
Can you imagine what it's like
to be the only one who is loved by him?

335
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,868
I see you two have met.

336
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:52,348
My nephew Karl. Isn't he fine?

337
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:54,069
And you should hear him play
the piano, Anna Holtz.

338
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:55,988
He's a Beethoven, all right.
Play something for her.

339
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:57,028
Not now, Uncle, please.

340
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:58,948
You have to get over that shyness
if you want to go on stage.

341
00:32:58,949 --> 00:32:59,988
I don't want to go on stage.

342
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:01,108
You should have been with me
this morning.

343
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,388
That would have braced you up.

344
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:04,267
There's nothing like
the rehearsal of a new work

345
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:06,268
to get the musical juices flowing.

346
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:09,269
Look, Anna Holtz, I finished.

347
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:15,748
All your hard work inspired me.
You must be an angel, a muse.

348
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:17,027
Herr Schlemmer will be delighted.

349
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,268
Schlemmer. I've arranged for Krenski
to send him some pickled carp.

350
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:21,947
That will put him back in the pink.

351
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:24,788
- He's got cancer.
- Shall we celebrate?

352
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:27,227
Let's go up to the lake
to Kahlenberg for lunch.

353
00:33:27,228 --> 00:33:29,828
I must copy these
for tomorrow's rehearsal.

354
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:33,067
- Well, you then, Karl. Come with me.
- I'm a bit short this month, Uncle.

355
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:35,507
- What?
- I say, I'm a bit short.

356
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:37,868
Oh, nonsense. You're taller than I.

357
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:43,347
That was a joke, Anna Holtz. A family joke.
We have lots of good jokes in our family.

358
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:45,467
Don't worry, Karl.
I'll pay for everything. My treat.

359
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:47,788
Well, actually, I'm very short this month.

360
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:53,467
Oh, well, yes.

361
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:05,667
Where's my. . .

362
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:07,466
Shit.

363
00:34:08,788 --> 00:34:12,107
The cleaning woman,
she's stealing from me. I know it.

364
00:34:14,627 --> 00:34:17,867
- Well, will 20 do?
- Well. . .

365
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:20,266
Here, 30, then.

366
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:28,066
- You'll have supper with me tonight?
- Well, I've promised some friends that. . .

367
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,987
I'm the greatest friend you have
in the world, Karl.

368
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:34,467
- I'll try.
- Karl.

369
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:37,266
Kiss me.

370
00:35:01,187 --> 00:35:02,666
He won't come.

371
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:06,586
Went to gamble with his friends.

372
00:35:07,426 --> 00:35:09,666
That's why he wanted the money.

373
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:17,985
What do you think of my nephew?

374
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:32,066
I think he's confused and unhappy.

375
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,945
He's my blood.

376
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:38,346
- Are you unhappy?
- I'm not confused.

377
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:43,464
You shouldn't ask me
such things, Anna Holtz.

378
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:45,465
Don't say such things to me.

379
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:48,944
You don't have the right.
You haven't earned it.

380
00:35:48,945 --> 00:35:51,145
- I apologize, Maestro.
- Did you speak?

381
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:54,984
You're doing it again. I can't see your face.

382
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:57,425
What did you say?
I suppose you apologized.

383
00:35:57,426 --> 00:35:59,625
- Yes, Maestro.
- Well, don't apologize when I attack you !

384
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:00,744
Fight back!

385
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,466
I can't stand people who whimper
and simper and apologize!

386
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:05,305
Well, you do it all the time!

387
00:36:05,305 --> 00:36:09,264
You abuse people, you insult them,
and then you send them a pickled carp!

388
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:12,785
That's true.

389
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:16,745
That's better.

390
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:22,345
Did he. . .

391
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,664
Did he say anything about me?

392
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:33,344
He said you wanted him to be a pianist,
and he has no talent.

393
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:36,304
I'll be the judge of that.
What better judge than I?

394
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:40,064
I've given Karl every advantage.
The best teachers. Me, for God's sake.

395
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,743
The boy has talent.
It just has to be brought out.

396
00:36:43,506 --> 00:36:45,544
- Forced out?
- What?

397
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,383
- I was just. . .
- What?

398
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:55,544
I was just wondering
if you can force someone to be an artist.

399
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,983
Go back to work.

400
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:42,983
What's that?

401
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:56,743
God damn you, you son of a bitch!

402
00:37:58,104 --> 00:37:59,663
Do you hear me?

403
00:38:02,383 --> 00:38:04,703
We are trying to eat, God damn you !

404
00:38:04,704 --> 00:38:06,863
You've ruined the goulash again!

405
00:38:11,303 --> 00:38:15,382
Did you study my piano sonatas
at the conservatory?

406
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:19,262
- Of course, Maestro.
- And which is your favorite?

407
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:23,381
The Waldstein? The Appassionata?

408
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:26,062
Oh, I know. I know.

409
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:28,262
The Moonlight.

410
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:49,741
I can only stay a moment.
I have to take these to Schlemmer's.

411
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:52,581
- Oh, stay longer.
- I can't. I. . .

412
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:56,782
Besides, should the nuns find out. . .

413
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:59,941
The nuns, the nuns. I'm going to
break you out of that place. It's a prison.

414
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:02,582
- Let me see it. Show it to me.
- Show you what?

415
00:39:03,062 --> 00:39:06,461
- The bridge, you blockhead.
- All right, all right.

416
00:39:10,503 --> 00:39:12,701
What do you think?
- It's amazing.

417
00:39:12,702 --> 00:39:15,621
A year's work. Every day,
every night, every spare moment.

418
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,581
Now all I have to do is build the model.

419
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:22,061
Anna, if I win, they're going to build it
across the Danube. My bridge.

420
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:24,181
The Martin Bauer Bridge.

421
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:27,420
Don't be silly.
They'll name it after the Archduke.

422
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:30,101
Archdukes come and go.
Technology lasts forever.

423
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:32,141
Beethoven wouldn't agree.
He always says. . .

424
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:34,300
Beethoven! Beethoven!
Beethoven is an old hypocrite.

425
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:36,501
He claims to be one of the people,
but he lives off the rich.

426
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:38,101
He fawns on the nobility.

427
00:39:38,102 --> 00:39:40,860
The Archduke, that prissy Russian count.

428
00:39:43,302 --> 00:39:45,540
I wish you weren't working for him.

429
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,740
I don't work for him. I work with him.

430
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:49,861
Excuse me, Maestro.

431
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:56,140
I thought it would be
the greatest privilege in the world.

432
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:57,381
And it is.

433
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:00,460
- It's just that. . .
- That what?

434
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,540
He's a brute. He's filthy rude.

435
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:11,941
He was lovely with me until he found out
I was to be his copyist and then. . .

436
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:13,020
And then what?

437
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,140
He mooned me.

438
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:21,340
He did. . . For God's sake, Anna,
you have to get out of there!

439
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,460
- But I want to show him my work.
- Why?

440
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:28,060
- Because it's a great opportunity.
- Show it to him and get out.

441
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,579
After the premiere.
It's Sunday. Will you come?

442
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:35,099
Two hours of Beethoven's music.

443
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:37,260
Anna, nobody listens
to this stuff anymore.

444
00:40:37,261 --> 00:40:39,260
This is the new music. This is the future.

445
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,900
Very well, then. Don't come.
I have to go now.

446
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:47,060
To spend an evening with you,
I would even listen to Beethoven.

447
00:42:36,018 --> 00:42:37,497
Good day, ma'am.

448
00:42:37,498 --> 00:42:38,857
Glorious, isn't it?

449
00:42:39,578 --> 00:42:40,977
The quiet.

450
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:45,057
He's been out all day, since before dawn.

451
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,657
Walks in the woods, you know,
out in Kahlenberg.

452
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:50,337
I have no windows.

453
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:53,457
This is the only chance I get
to open my door.

454
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:56,457
That must be terrible,
to be shut in all the time.

455
00:42:57,298 --> 00:42:59,456
I live for these moments,

456
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:02,177
these peaceful hours.

457
00:43:02,618 --> 00:43:05,537
- Excuse me, but why don't you move?
- Move?

458
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:11,977
I am the next-door neighbor
of Ludwig van Beethoven.

459
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:17,057
I hear all the pieces before anyone,
before they're premiered.

460
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:22,737
The whole of Vienna envies me.
I've been with him since the 7th.

461
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:41,576
Wonderful stuff.

462
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,896
The new one's coming along, isn't it?

463
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:46,336
- Very well, thank you.
- Keep him at it.

464
00:43:46,777 --> 00:43:47,975
I will.

465
00:44:02,617 --> 00:44:04,736
- Excuse me!
- Christ.

466
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:08,376
What are you doing?

467
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:10,935
You're the one stealing from him,
aren't you?

468
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:13,456
- It's not stealing.
- What is it, then?

469
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:15,855
It's what he owes me.

470
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:19,376
He's trying to arrange a recital for me.

471
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:21,536
Do you understand?

472
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:23,975
I don't want to play the goddamn piano.

473
00:44:23,976 --> 00:44:27,136
- Put back the money.
- No, I can't.

474
00:44:27,576 --> 00:44:30,695
I have debts,
debts I owe to very dangerous people.

475
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:34,334
I mean, you have no idea.
You're just a girl. Sheltered.

476
00:44:34,336 --> 00:44:36,055
Vienna is not a healthy place.

477
00:44:36,696 --> 00:44:40,255
You know, they say it's the center
of culture, of civilization. . .

478
00:44:40,496 --> 00:44:45,175
Karl, give me the money.
I'll put it back for you.

479
00:44:45,176 --> 00:44:47,094
- I can't.
- Give me the money!

480
00:44:47,095 --> 00:44:49,295
I'm not a bad person, Miss Holtz.

481
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:51,975
I just can't stop,
and I need this money now.

482
00:44:53,096 --> 00:44:55,016
Oh, my God. He's coming.

483
00:44:55,016 --> 00:44:58,334
Karl !

484
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:01,015
Uncle.

485
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:02,335
Good morning, Karl.
Good morning.

486
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,455
I'm late.

487
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:07,375
- I've set the recital a week from Tuesday.
- Okay.

488
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:21,254
Anna Holtz, isn't life a beautiful thing?

489
00:45:21,496 --> 00:45:24,254
I was walking out at Kahlenberg.
Do you ever go there?

490
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:27,134
Nature. Man lives for nature.

491
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:31,455
If you ever really want to compose,
you must take rooms at Kahlenberg.

492
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:33,454
I saw Karl. I met him on the stairs.

493
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:36,614
Yes.

494
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:40,094
Did he tell you? I've arranged
a recital for him. He's very excited.

495
00:45:40,095 --> 00:45:41,375
Maestro.

496
00:45:43,095 --> 00:45:45,533
- He doesn't want to do the recital.
- What?

497
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:50,853
- He doesn't want to do the recital.
- Nonsense. He said that to you?

498
00:45:51,095 --> 00:45:54,254
I just saw him. He said nothing of the kind.
He didn't come here for that?

499
00:45:55,095 --> 00:45:57,573
No. He came here for money.

500
00:45:57,574 --> 00:46:00,334
Money? He didn't ask me for any money.

501
00:46:08,694 --> 00:46:11,213
Are you saying that he stole from me,
that he came here to take my money?

502
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:14,494
It's the cleaning woman.
I've been meaning to sack her for weeks.

503
00:46:14,494 --> 00:46:17,134
Karl, a thief?
Why would you say such a thing?

504
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:18,893
Because I know that you love him.

505
00:46:18,894 --> 00:46:22,334
Love? And what would a girl your age
understand about love?

506
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:28,253
My God, you're in love, aren't you?
Who? Let me guess.

507
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:30,853
Your professor of counterpoint.

508
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:35,053
Young, good looking,
frilly-shirted, fifth-rate Rossini.

509
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:36,893
- He's an engineer.
- Engineer?

510
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:39,933
Yes. He's designing a bridge
for the Archduke's competition.

511
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:42,813
One of our men of steel.
One of our new iron men.

512
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:45,253
- Martin is an artist.
- Martin? Well. . .

513
00:46:46,494 --> 00:46:51,493
I'm very aware of Martin's kind of artists.
They're slide rules without souls.

514
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:55,093
You shouldn't be his lover,
you should be his enemy.

515
00:46:55,094 --> 00:46:56,452
I'm not his lover.

516
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:59,533
So, that's why you came to Vienna?
To chase a man.

517
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:03,132
I came to Vienna because God
wishes me to be a composer.

518
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:06,253
Well, then, he made a serious mistake
in making you a woman.

519
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:09,572
You should not talk about God that way.

520
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:13,452
I assure you, Anna Holtz, the Almighty
and I understand each other perfectly.

521
00:47:13,453 --> 00:47:15,293
We're like two bears in one den.

522
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:18,852
We growl and snarl and claw
at one another.

523
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,053
Sleep at each other's backs.

524
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:23,012
No one dares come near us.

525
00:47:23,013 --> 00:47:25,212
That sounds like a very lonely religion.

526
00:47:25,213 --> 00:47:26,972
Loneliness is my religion.

527
00:47:31,613 --> 00:47:34,332
Why aren't you working?
The premiere is tomorrow night.

528
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:08,971
Do you think I ought to
cancel Karl's recital?

529
00:48:09,572 --> 00:48:12,851
- Yes, Maestro.
- He wants to join the Army, you know?

530
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:18,051
Abandon music, become a cavalryman.
He always loved horses.

531
00:48:19,572 --> 00:48:21,531
Perhaps that would be for the best.

532
00:48:22,772 --> 00:48:24,171
Yes, perhaps.

533
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:27,771
Perhaps.

534
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:45,050
Why are you so frank with me,
Anna Holtz?

535
00:48:45,412 --> 00:48:47,130
Because I esteem you
as one of the greatest. . .

536
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:49,131
Don't flatter me!

537
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,050
Why do you wish to be near me?

538
00:49:00,212 --> 00:49:01,650
Because. . .

539
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:07,530
Because it makes me believe
that I, too, can write music.

540
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:11,130
Music?

541
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,529
The vibrations on the air

542
00:49:36,691 --> 00:49:41,129
are the breath of God
speaking to man's soul.

543
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:46,530
Music is the language of God.

544
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:54,049
We musicians are as close to God
as man can be.

545
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,449
We hear his voice.

546
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,049
We read his lips.

547
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:08,449
We give birth to the children of God
who sing his praise.

548
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,449
That's what musicians are, Anna Holtz.

549
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:24,249
And if we're not that, we're nothing.

550
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,248
Please, have a seat.

551
00:51:35,288 --> 00:51:36,847
It's two hours long.

552
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:38,687
Should be interesting, yes?
- Yes.

553
00:51:38,688 --> 00:51:41,247
- His first symphony in 10 years?
- Yes.

554
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:46,247
Anna.

555
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:50,047
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind?

556
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,928
Excuse me.

557
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:56,927
- I was looking for you in the balconies.
- For my Anna, only the best seats.

558
00:51:56,928 --> 00:51:58,287
How did you get them?

559
00:51:58,287 --> 00:52:01,127
Well, there are some advantages
to having wealthy parents.

560
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:03,647
The Archduke.

561
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,127
Fortunately, we're upwind.

562
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:12,726
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

563
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:20,927
Miss Holtz! Miss Holtz!

564
00:52:23,008 --> 00:52:25,727
You must come with me, please!
You must come!

565
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:28,326
- They're about to start.
- It's Beethoven.

566
00:52:31,688 --> 00:52:35,527
He wanted me to stand in the wings
and read time for him.

567
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:38,046
Can you imagine standing for two hours?

568
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:40,727
I can't stand for two minutes.

569
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:45,287
I had to tell him Karl is not here.

570
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:49,527
I went to his seat, and he had sold it
to an American in a loud suit

571
00:52:49,528 --> 00:52:51,486
and a wife half his age.

572
00:52:52,286 --> 00:52:54,327
You must go to him. He needs you.

573
00:52:59,006 --> 00:53:00,046
Maestro.

574
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:02,646
You sent for me?

575
00:53:04,207 --> 00:53:06,845
- Karl did not come?
- No.

576
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:09,446
Perhaps he's ill.

577
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,246
- That must be it.
- He would have, if he could.

578
00:53:17,886 --> 00:53:19,246
I'm here.

579
00:53:20,286 --> 00:53:22,325
Everyone thinks I live in silence.

580
00:53:23,486 --> 00:53:24,726
It's not true.

581
00:53:25,886 --> 00:53:30,725
My head is constantly filled with sound.
It never stops.

582
00:53:30,726 --> 00:53:33,045
The only relief I have is to write it down.

583
00:53:33,566 --> 00:53:35,725
God infests my mind with music.

584
00:53:36,686 --> 00:53:40,365
And then what does he do?
He makes me deaf.

585
00:53:40,366 --> 00:53:43,925
He denies me the pleasure
he allows everyone else, hearing my work.

586
00:53:43,926 --> 00:53:45,645
Is that a loving God?

587
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:50,325
- Is that a friend?
- He is our father.

588
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:54,445
My father was a brutal, drunken sod.

589
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:57,444
If God is my father, I disown him.

590
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,965
Maybe. . .

591
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:04,444
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

592
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,765
That's what they think, all of them.

593
00:54:08,685 --> 00:54:10,005
What do you think?

594
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:13,365
I think God is speaking to you. I know it.

595
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:18,044
I can't do this, Anna Holtz.

596
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,644
- I can't keep the orchestra together.
- Maestro, I will help you.

597
00:54:24,365 --> 00:54:26,604
I will stand where you can see me.

598
00:54:26,606 --> 00:54:29,523
I'll keep the beat for you,
give you the entrances.

599
00:54:30,286 --> 00:54:31,524
Don't worry.

600
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:34,964
Are they here? The vultures?

601
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,244
Yes.

602
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:39,124
The Archduke.

603
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,244
All the composers.

604
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:43,044
All of Vienna.

605
00:54:45,006 --> 00:54:46,644
My coat, please.

606
00:55:06,684 --> 00:55:08,164
- Anna Holtz.
- Yes?

607
00:55:09,405 --> 00:55:11,843
- You look like a woman.
- Thank you.

608
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:17,844
But can you conduct?

609
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:24,443
We're in trouble.
God help us.

610
00:55:36,884 --> 00:55:38,963
Now music changes forever.

611
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,229
Thank you so much.

612
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:10,509
Maestro, brilliant! Heavenly!

613
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:12,749
- I know.
- Divine.

614
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:16,629
Anna! Anna Holtz! We did it! We did it!

615
01:08:16,629 --> 01:08:17,469
Yes.

616
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:19,908
We're going to Krenski's tavern.
Come celebrate with us.

617
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:22,350
I can't, Maestro. The convent.

618
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:24,348
Oh, the nuns. Well, bring them along !

619
01:08:24,349 --> 01:08:26,389
We'll get them drunk
and give them a good job!

620
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,429
Good night. Bravo, Maestro!

621
01:09:22,749 --> 01:09:25,508
For the love of Christ, you filthy bastard !

622
01:09:25,509 --> 01:09:28,148
What kind of a life can I live down here?

623
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:32,148
Anna Holtz. Did you hear it?
Coming up the stairs, could you hear it?

624
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:33,668
Yes, Maestro. What is it?

625
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,628
It's the Grosse Fugue.
The fugue for the new quartet.

626
01:09:36,628 --> 01:09:38,347
It's been going round
in my head for weeks.

627
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:40,508
I've been up all night working on it.

628
01:09:41,148 --> 01:09:43,548
- What do you think?
- May I?

629
01:09:46,068 --> 01:09:47,747
This is the beginning.

630
01:09:49,068 --> 01:09:51,748
Well? Well, do you like it?

631
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:56,227
- I. . .
- Be frank. I value your frankness.

632
01:09:58,148 --> 01:09:59,467
I think it's ugly.

633
01:09:59,468 --> 01:10:02,107
Ugly? You think it's ugly?
Of course it's ugly.

634
01:10:02,108 --> 01:10:03,866
But is it beautiful?

635
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,867
- I don't understand.
- She doesn't understand.

636
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,747
It's meant to challenge
your sense of beauty.

637
01:10:15,268 --> 01:10:19,467
I'm opening up music to the ugly,
to the visceral.

638
01:10:19,468 --> 01:10:23,027
How else can you get to the divine
except through the guts of man?

639
01:10:23,028 --> 01:10:25,507
See, here. See, this is where God lives.
Not in the head.

640
01:10:25,508 --> 01:10:27,866
Not even in the soul, but in the guts.

641
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:30,307
Because this is where the people feel it.

642
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:32,586
The intestines twist and coil to heaven.

643
01:10:32,587 --> 01:10:35,187
Bowels are closer to enlightenment
than the brain.

644
01:10:35,188 --> 01:10:36,106
You can't have your head in the clouds

645
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:38,626
unless there's shit
on the soles of your boots.

646
01:10:40,267 --> 01:10:42,106
- Come on. Sing it with me.
- What?

647
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:44,226
Come on.

648
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:54,626
So? So?

649
01:10:55,788 --> 01:10:57,866
I'm sorry, Maestro. I don't understand it.

650
01:10:57,868 --> 01:11:00,505
Oh, no. Of course you don't understand.
It's not about understanding.

651
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,985
You must experience these works of mine.

652
01:11:02,986 --> 01:11:06,426
It's a language, Anna Holtz,
a new language I'm inventing

653
01:11:06,427 --> 01:11:09,267
to talk about man's experience of God,
my experience of God.

654
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:12,106
That's why you were sent to me,
to write down this language.

655
01:11:12,107 --> 01:11:13,746
You are God's secretary.

656
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:17,746
You read his lips through me,
but understanding. . .

657
01:11:20,266 --> 01:11:21,746
I have something for you.

658
01:11:23,067 --> 01:11:24,946
Christ! I'm not even dressed.

659
01:11:27,266 --> 01:11:29,266
Where did I put it?

660
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:31,105
Oh, here, look.

661
01:11:31,266 --> 01:11:34,545
It's the score I conducted. . .
We conducted from.

662
01:11:35,065 --> 01:11:37,985
Look. I've inscribed it to you.

663
01:11:37,986 --> 01:11:39,425
Maestro.

664
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:43,585
"My dear Anna,
you're the angel of my soul,

665
01:11:43,586 --> 01:11:47,506
"the only hands I can trust
to bear it across the tides of time. "

666
01:11:47,507 --> 01:11:49,026
Well?

667
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:52,665
It's such an honor, Maestro.

668
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:54,545
It's no less than you deserve.

669
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,985
Maestro, I have something for you.

670
01:11:59,986 --> 01:12:01,024
What?

671
01:12:02,746 --> 01:12:04,865
- You wrote it?
- Yes.

672
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:07,464
It's in C minor, huh? My favorite key.

673
01:12:08,626 --> 01:12:11,424
This is amazing.
I've never seen anything like it.

674
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:15,145
It's completely cerebral, isn't it?

675
01:12:15,145 --> 01:12:18,704
This here. . .
This bit actually shows promise.

676
01:12:19,746 --> 01:12:21,744
But this. . . This. . .

677
01:12:22,746 --> 01:12:24,105
This here is. . .

678
01:12:29,385 --> 01:12:33,624
It's a little bit like intellectual
wind-breaking, isn't it?

679
01:12:38,465 --> 01:12:40,824
Handwriting is very neat. But this. . .

680
01:12:48,505 --> 01:12:52,104
You've invented a new musical genre.
Fartissimo!

681
01:13:06,144 --> 01:13:08,704
Oh, God, what fun.

682
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,624
Let's get down to work, shall we?

683
01:13:12,464 --> 01:13:15,303
Oh, my God. What have I done?
It was the fugue.

684
01:13:15,304 --> 01:13:17,983
Anna Holtz, I didn't. . . I didn't think!

685
01:13:17,984 --> 01:13:20,224
Sometimes I don't think! Ask Karl !

686
01:13:20,584 --> 01:13:23,344
Anna, please!
Let me look at it again! Anna!

687
01:13:23,664 --> 01:13:27,383
Anna! I'm a fool !
I'm an old, stupid, deaf fool !

688
01:13:27,384 --> 01:13:32,703
You gave me the gift.
So, why are you telling me not to use it?

689
01:13:34,344 --> 01:13:36,144
Why are you doing this to me?

690
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:39,903
I didn't ask for this gift.
What do you want me to do?

691
01:13:39,904 --> 01:13:44,223
Anna, your gift is from God.

692
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:46,823
Use it to serve him.

693
01:13:50,144 --> 01:13:52,023
But that's not my calling.

694
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:58,302
Music isn't my calling.
I came here to study.

695
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:01,903
You studied with Salieri.
You must know what I mean.

696
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,663
I didn't even get to meet Salieri.

697
01:14:03,664 --> 01:14:06,222
They sent me to work
with one of his assistants.

698
01:14:06,664 --> 01:14:10,742
I was 17. He was French.

699
01:14:11,384 --> 01:14:15,102
I didn't get to sing at the Paris Opera,
but I came here.

700
01:14:15,783 --> 01:14:20,222
And I sing his praises every day,
where it is safe.

701
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,702
And so can you.

702
01:14:24,863 --> 01:14:29,982
But what'll I say to my father, Aunt Clara?
He's sacrificed so much for me.

703
01:14:29,983 --> 01:14:33,622
It's what your father wants.
It's why he sent you.

704
01:14:34,143 --> 01:14:37,742
He wants to know that you're safe with us.

705
01:14:38,982 --> 01:14:40,022
Give him that peace.

706
01:15:16,463 --> 01:15:18,022
Anna Holtz!

707
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,621
Where is she?

708
01:15:23,462 --> 01:15:26,101
- What is the meaning of this?
- I demand to see her!

709
01:15:26,102 --> 01:15:28,701
- Who do you think you are?
- I am Ludwig van Beethoven.

710
01:15:28,702 --> 01:15:31,581
Sisters, leave now. What do you want?

711
01:15:31,582 --> 01:15:34,421
You will bring Anna Holtz to me now.

712
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:37,502
- Or what will you do?
- I command you to bring her to me!

713
01:15:37,502 --> 01:15:40,941
- Get back to your room.
- It's all right, Mother.

714
01:15:44,342 --> 01:15:45,901
This is for you.

715
01:15:48,342 --> 01:15:50,101
My composition.

716
01:15:51,462 --> 01:15:53,901
- What have you done to it?
- Made some notes.

717
01:15:53,901 --> 01:15:55,821
Look, I've even marked the good passages.

718
01:15:56,061 --> 01:15:58,700
- It's a mess.
- But it has promise.

719
01:15:58,701 --> 01:16:00,700
I told you, it has promise.

720
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:04,700
Let me develop it with you.
We can work on it together.

721
01:16:08,781 --> 01:16:13,101
Anna Holtz, forgive me.

722
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,220
I beg you to forgive me.

723
01:16:20,261 --> 01:16:23,740
Come back to me. Please.

724
01:16:26,861 --> 01:16:28,220
Please.

725
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,820
What?

726
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,660
I just don't understand it, Maestro.

727
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:41,339
- Where does the movement end?
- It doesn't end. It flows.

728
01:16:42,061 --> 01:16:45,019
You have to stop thinking
in terms of beginning and ending.

729
01:16:45,661 --> 01:16:48,459
This is not one of the bridges
your iron man builds.

730
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,619
This is a living thing.

731
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:56,620
Like clouds taking shape or tides shifting.

732
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:01,099
- But musically, how does it work?
- It doesn't work, it grows.

733
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,579
You see, the first movement
becomes the second.

734
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:07,419
As each idea dies, a new one's born.

735
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:10,699
See, in your work,
you're obsessed with structure,

736
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,660
with choosing the correct form.

737
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:15,619
You have to listen to the voice
speaking inside of you.

738
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,899
I didn't even really hear it myself
until I went deaf.

739
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,019
Not that I want you to go deaf, my dear.

740
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:26,499
You're telling me that
I must find the silence in myself,

741
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,499
- so I can hear the music.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

742
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,539
The silence is the key.
The silence between the notes.

743
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:40,298
When that silence envelops you,
then your soul can sing.

744
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,618
Anna Holtz, do you know
what you mean to me?

745
01:18:05,378 --> 01:18:10,938
In past years, I've lived in fear because
I've been alone, like a man in prison.

746
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:14,817
Then God sent you to me.

747
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:20,018
I slipped my notes
through the bars to you.

748
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:24,218
You were the key to my release.

749
01:18:30,859 --> 01:18:32,538
Wash me.

750
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:34,618
What?

751
01:22:12,415 --> 01:22:13,534
Anna!

752
01:22:18,654 --> 01:22:22,413
Anna, you've come. Thank you.
I'm so glad you're here.

753
01:22:23,254 --> 01:22:25,253
I've been waiting for you.

754
01:22:25,254 --> 01:22:27,213
I want you to be the first to see it.

755
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:30,533
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

756
01:22:38,854 --> 01:22:40,014
Well?

757
01:22:42,334 --> 01:22:45,853
It's very big and complex.

758
01:22:45,854 --> 01:22:49,253
- It's interesting.
- But you like it?

759
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:54,092
- Honestly, I'm overwhelmed.
- Thank God.

760
01:22:55,574 --> 01:22:59,093
I was so worried.
- Maestro, what are you doing?

761
01:22:59,094 --> 01:23:00,053
I couldn't wait.

762
01:23:00,054 --> 01:23:02,212
- I only just left.
- You may have time. I do not.

763
01:23:03,134 --> 01:23:07,293
Maestro, this is my friend, Martin Bauer.
Martin, Ludwig van Beethoven.

764
01:23:07,294 --> 01:23:09,972
- A pleasure, sir.
- This is your famous bridge?

765
01:23:09,973 --> 01:23:11,372
Are you going to win?

766
01:23:11,373 --> 01:23:13,372
- I don't know.
- How could you not know that?

767
01:23:13,373 --> 01:23:15,892
Anna tells me you're an artist.
Aren't you an artist?

768
01:23:16,253 --> 01:23:17,853
Well, that depends on
what you mean by an artist.

769
01:23:17,854 --> 01:23:20,773
An artist is someone
who has learned to trust himself.

770
01:23:20,774 --> 01:23:23,732
Maestro, what do you think?

771
01:23:24,053 --> 01:23:26,332
- It has no soul.
I beg your pardon?

772
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:30,572
It lacks life, grace, passion.
It is a dead and worthless thing.

773
01:23:30,573 --> 01:23:31,652
- You have no right.
- Martin. . .

774
01:23:31,653 --> 01:23:34,292
No. I don't care who he is.

775
01:23:34,853 --> 01:23:37,412
I don't care what the world thinks you are.
What gives you the right?

776
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:38,572
I tell you what gives me the right.

777
01:23:38,573 --> 01:23:41,252
You build bridges
to connect points of land.

778
01:23:41,253 --> 01:23:45,012
I build them to connect men's souls.
God gives me the right.

779
01:23:45,013 --> 01:23:48,692
God whispers into some men's ears.
Well, he shouts into mine!

780
01:23:49,133 --> 01:23:50,451
That's why I am deaf.

781
01:23:50,453 --> 01:23:53,691
When you go blind, sir,
then you, too, will have the right

782
01:23:53,692 --> 01:23:56,611
- not to be judged, but to judge.
- Beethoven. . .

783
01:23:57,253 --> 01:24:00,532
I didn't know. . . I didn't know you. . .

784
01:24:00,972 --> 01:24:04,212
I didn't know you had an interest
in such things.

785
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:05,612
Macaroon?

786
01:24:05,772 --> 01:24:09,771
Excellency, this is Martin Bauer
of the Polytechnic Institute.

787
01:24:09,973 --> 01:24:14,171
- A friend of yours, is he, Beethoven?
- No, your Excellency.

788
01:24:14,172 --> 01:24:16,412
But because of the gratitude
I bear for Anna,

789
01:24:16,413 --> 01:24:18,651
I'm going to do you a favor, Martin Bauer.

790
01:24:18,652 --> 01:24:22,011
- I'm going to give you a gift.
- What are you doing?

791
01:24:24,332 --> 01:24:29,250
Now how do you feel?
Sad? Angry? Furious?

792
01:24:29,252 --> 01:24:32,771
Do you want to kill? Start over?
Build your bridge from that?

793
01:24:32,772 --> 01:24:36,211
Didn't like that one, Beethoven?
- I expect you this evening.

794
01:24:37,052 --> 01:24:40,330
Make a note of that.
Beethoven didn't like that one.

795
01:24:40,331 --> 01:24:42,290
I didn't like it, either.

796
01:24:42,732 --> 01:24:43,931
Martin.

797
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:47,490
If you ever go near that man again,
I'll have nothing more to do with you.

798
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:49,251
Do you understand me?

799
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:52,530
Nothing.

800
01:25:04,652 --> 01:25:06,010
How could you do that to him?

801
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:09,330
The fire has gone out.
- I'm not your servant.

802
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:12,091
I said, I'm not your servant!

803
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:13,611
I heard you.

804
01:25:14,732 --> 01:25:16,810
You've destroyed Martin.

805
01:25:18,051 --> 01:25:20,809
You talk about God, and then you do this?

806
01:25:20,811 --> 01:25:23,410
I may have saved his soul, if he has one.

807
01:25:24,051 --> 01:25:27,410
Has it ever occurred to you
that I might love him?

808
01:25:27,411 --> 01:25:30,210
You don't love him. Not him.

809
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:34,010
And I suppose I love you.

810
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:35,890
No. You want to be me.

811
01:25:36,451 --> 01:25:38,929
I don't even want to be near you.

812
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,089
I didn't mean for you to see that.

813
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:11,128
Why did you leave it on the piano?

814
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:13,089
I was going to. . . I was planning. . .

815
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,969
It isn't finished.

816
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,209
It's good.

817
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:31,889
There are a few points to be worked out,
but on the whole it's very good.

818
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:35,808
It has strength and lyricism.
Above all, simplicity.

819
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:39,209
There's only one problem.
You're copying me, Anna Holtz.

820
01:26:40,049 --> 01:26:41,089
Is that such a bad thing?

821
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:44,409
World doesn't need another Beethoven,
but it may need you.

822
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:50,009
You may leave if you wish,
but that won't free you from me.

823
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:06,927
If you work the ending of the fugue,
it's finished.

824
01:27:08,129 --> 01:27:10,688
This is my bridge, Anna Holtz.

825
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:14,088
My bridge to the future of music.

826
01:27:15,769 --> 01:27:20,688
If one day you will cross over it,
perhaps you will be free.

827
01:27:32,568 --> 01:27:34,087
Anna Holtz.

828
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:35,408
Yes?

829
01:27:36,249 --> 01:27:40,007
Martin Bauer's bridge,
what did you think of it?

830
01:27:42,328 --> 01:27:44,407
I think you improved it.

831
01:28:07,567 --> 01:28:10,207
Now, let's copy out the fugue
and see what the world thinks of it.

832
01:29:11,247 --> 01:29:13,806
Excellent! Excellent!

833
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:16,726
You did it! You did it!

834
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:20,206
My God, you're deafer than I thought.

835
01:29:41,246 --> 01:29:44,206
I just don't hear it
the way you do, Maestro.

836
01:29:45,447 --> 01:29:46,925
I'm sorry.

837
01:29:50,446 --> 01:29:52,405
It's all right, Anna Holtz.

838
01:29:53,926 --> 01:29:55,485
It doesn't matter.

839
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:58,125
It doesn't.

840
01:30:01,046 --> 01:30:03,085
It had to end this way.

841
01:30:12,046 --> 01:30:13,724
Maestro!

842
01:30:15,765 --> 01:30:17,885
Maestro. Help!

843
01:31:17,444 --> 01:31:19,084
Anna Holtz?

844
01:31:20,644 --> 01:31:22,003
You're awake.

845
01:31:25,044 --> 01:31:29,243
I just stopped in to look at you
and fix the fire.

846
01:31:29,924 --> 01:31:34,123
This is excellent coal.
Anthracite makes the best fire.

847
01:31:34,324 --> 01:31:36,682
You know about coal?

848
01:31:36,963 --> 01:31:39,083
My father is a miner in Silesia.

849
01:31:40,044 --> 01:31:43,084
- How are you feeling?
- I've been dreaming.

850
01:31:43,244 --> 01:31:46,123
Melodies, prayers.

851
01:31:46,444 --> 01:31:49,203
I've been to Krenski's. I have your lunch.

852
01:31:49,924 --> 01:31:52,603
I must work.
I have to get it down before it escapes.

853
01:31:52,604 --> 01:31:55,003
Please, no. Don't get up.

854
01:31:55,364 --> 01:31:57,683
I'll write it down for you.
You can dictate to me.

855
01:31:57,683 --> 01:31:58,923
All right.

856
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:12,402
- What key does it start in?
- No key.

857
01:32:12,563 --> 01:32:14,203
No key?

858
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,442
You can't write music in no key.

859
01:32:17,443 --> 01:32:20,122
Well, I can't write this
in anything but no key.

860
01:32:20,723 --> 01:32:26,403
It's common time,
molto adagio, sotto voce.

861
01:32:27,763 --> 01:32:30,602
First violin, quarter notes.

862
01:32:31,363 --> 01:32:33,963
Middle C up to A.

863
01:32:33,963 --> 01:32:35,401
Measure.

864
01:32:35,923 --> 01:32:40,922
G up to C, tied, F.

865
01:32:43,044 --> 01:32:46,002
Second violin, bar two.

866
01:32:46,243 --> 01:32:48,161
Middle C up to A.

867
01:32:48,682 --> 01:32:52,681
Double note E, G, C.

868
01:32:52,843 --> 01:32:53,962
Have it.

869
01:32:54,162 --> 01:32:57,201
Viola clef, 2B pressed.

870
01:32:58,043 --> 01:32:59,961
- It's a hymn.
- Yes.

871
01:32:59,962 --> 01:33:01,841
Hymn of thanksgiving.

872
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:06,521
- Thanksgiving?
- To God, for sparing me to finish my work.

873
01:33:08,322 --> 01:33:11,201
After the pianissimo, the canon resumes.

874
01:33:11,923 --> 01:33:14,121
First violin takes the theme.

875
01:33:15,123 --> 01:33:19,482
Viola, C to A.
It's growing, gaining strength.

876
01:33:20,043 --> 01:33:21,881
Second violin, C to A.

877
01:33:21,882 --> 01:33:23,642
An octave higher.
- Yes.

878
01:33:23,643 --> 01:33:28,721
Then the struggle. First violin, C,
up an octave, and then up to G.

879
01:33:29,403 --> 01:33:30,721
And the cello. . .

880
01:33:30,722 --> 01:33:33,321
- Down.
- Yes, down. Pulled down.

881
01:33:33,322 --> 01:33:36,921
Half notes, F, E, D. Pulled constantly down.

882
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:42,681
And then, a voice,
a single frail voice emerges,

883
01:33:42,682 --> 01:33:47,961
soaring above the sound.
The striving continues.

884
01:33:47,961 --> 01:33:50,201
- Yes.
- Moving below the surface.

885
01:33:50,201 --> 01:33:52,040
- Crescendo?
- Yes.

886
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:56,001
First violin longing, pleading to God.

887
01:33:56,002 --> 01:33:59,760
And then, God answers. The clouds open.

888
01:33:59,761 --> 01:34:04,120
Loving hands reach down.
We're raised up into heaven.

889
01:34:06,161 --> 01:34:11,201
Cello remains earthbound,
but the other voices soar suspended.

890
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,680
- For an instant.
- Yes. For an instant.

891
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:17,801
In which you can live forever.

892
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:22,000
Earth does not exist.

893
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,081
Time is timeless.

894
01:34:26,841 --> 01:34:32,520
And the hands that lifted you
caress your face,

895
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,000
mold them to the face of God.

896
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:39,720
And you are at one.

897
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,280
You are at peace.

898
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,719
You're finally free.

899
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,399
Yes.

900
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,057
