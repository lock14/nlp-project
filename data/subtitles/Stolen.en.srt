00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,358
Hey.

3
00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,295
Hey.

4
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,659
<i>- Delta team check in.
- Delta team</i>.

5
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,398
No, no, no.

6
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,697
Maybe the source is wrong.
The source is good.

7
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:34,425
It's ten after. The source said 4 a.m.
on the dot.

8
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:35,726
Wait. Go back.

9
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,431
Creedence.

10
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:42,897
It's probably
just a radio station

11
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:46,090
someplace outside of the city.

12
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:48,654
No. It's him.

13
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,923
Do we have to listen
to the whole song,

14
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:16,193
all seven minutes
and 40 seconds of it?

15
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:18,561
Why do you insist on
asking that every time?

16
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:21,757
Gum, I don't want to mess
with your superstitions.

17
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:23,712
God knows we don't wanna
fluck with the formula,

18
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,323
but how about a new band?

19
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,490
Over the last six years,
we have listened

20
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:33,157
the entire Creedence Clearwater
Revival songbook over and over...

21
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,258
Hello?

22
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:37,593
Hi, sweetie.

23
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,257
Why are you up so early?

24
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,230
What?

25
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,889
Which one?

26
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:46,363
Which one? Oh, the
Care Bears book.

27
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:50,194
Oh, okay. I thought you
were taking the even pages.

28
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:52,390
Oh, okay, I'm supposed
to color the evens.

29
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:55,557
Okay, well, I'll take my
turn as soon as I get home.

30
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:59,189
Save the purple crayon
for Daddy.

31
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,924
Well, I told you,
Daddy has to work.

32
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:04,022
But guess what?

33
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,826
When I get home, I'm gonna make
you those happy face pancakes

34
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:09,091
that you like so much, okay?

35
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:10,529
I love you, baby.

36
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,792
Okay, big kiss.

37
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:17,162
Don't.

38
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,431
What?

39
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:21,760
Actually,
you wouldn't understand.

40
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:24,264
About Care Bears?
Parenthood.

41
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,888
No, no, you're totally right.

42
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,692
Every father talks
to his little girl

43
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:30,027
before he commits
a Class H felony.

44
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:33,497
Absolutely normal.
So sweet.

45
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,293
Hoyt's late.

46
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:40,927
Four minutes is not late.

47
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,397
The sensors are set in 20.

48
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,227
Four minutes
less from 20 is 16,

49
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,356
two to enter,
three for the wall,

50
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,398
ten to drill.

51
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,227
Puts us inside in 15 minutes.

52
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:53,094
That's not enough cushion.

53
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:55,892
Let's call it. Dude is
running five minutes behind.

54
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,363
He's probably
just taking a dump.

55
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:58,920
We're not calling it.
We're good.

56
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:01,521
This is an ace boon swipe, Gum.

57
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:05,588
There's not another one of these in
the headlights for a long while.

58
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,428
I don't know. Suddenly
I'm not feeling so good.

59
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,362
Well, then relax.

60
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:13,057
Put on a little
"Bad Moon Rising."

61
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:14,927
<i>This is Diamond Dog.</i>

62
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,397
I'm in the mainframe now.

63
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:21,262
The blouse is open,
undoing the bra strap now.

64
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:23,093
Fire alarms are down.

65
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,596
Seismics are down.

66
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,597
Killing the cameras now.

67
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:27,892
Good to go when you are.

68
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:30,829
Go radio silent till I say.

69
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,394
The van's leaving.

70
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,188
Okay, fellas.

71
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:23,389
As ready to rock
as Riley's diaphragm.

72
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:24,931
Really, Hoyt?

73
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,090
Sorry, Sugar.

74
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:33,391
Sir, I've got seismic.
Sounds like they blew a wall.

75
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,420
We got 'em.

76
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:42,760
Doesn't make any sense.
It's too easy.

77
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:45,593
This crew doesn't do too easy.

78
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:47,324
Three minutes, guys.

79
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,589
Less than three, let's go.

80
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,097
Move it.

81
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,630
Dude, come on.

82
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:58,095
Okay, grab some extras.

83
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,263
<i>Come on, move it.</i>

84
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,595
We're in route now.

85
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:25,563
The proverbial hand is up
the skirt, heading straight

86
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,723
for the moose knuckle. Awesome.
That's why I love working with dudes.

87
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:33,594
For all the clever variations you can
come up with for the word "vagina."

88
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:35,858
Vagina.

89
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,090
I need some air.

90
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:08,487
Drill's up.
Three minutes down.

91
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:09,928
They started drilling.

92
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:12,430
Wait. On my go.

93
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:43,919
Lock is out.

94
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:45,259
It's a go.

95
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:47,058
All right, we'll take 'em.

96
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,093
<i>Come on, now, master at work.</i>

97
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:20,089
You got 30 seconds.
Plenty of time.

98
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:21,891
<i>Number one's down.</i>

99
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:28,162
Gum, you have 15 seconds.
Come on.

100
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,220
<i>Number two down.</i>

101
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:34,153
Go!

102
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,257
Clear.
Clear.

103
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,558
What the hell's going on?

104
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,691
Doesn't make any sense.

105
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,923
They were casing this place
for three weeks.

106
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:52,590
Shit! Get someone
in that toy store.

107
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:53,289
Now!

108
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:00,652
We're in. HOYT: <i>They're in the bank vault.
Two minutes till we 're rich.</i>

109
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,491
Jesus wept.

110
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,925
It's like looking into heaven.

111
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:16,896
Stay focused.

112
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:19,021
<i>Alpha team
sweeping toy store now.</i>

113
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,394
Clear.
Clear.

114
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:21,589
All clear.

115
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:25,721
<i>Get a... now.</i>

116
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:27,354
<i>Diamond exchange
has not been reached.</i>

117
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,226
<i>Repeat,
secondary wall is intact.</i>

118
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:32,264
You know I like
bright shiny things, Gum.

119
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:36,729
This is the ultimate bright shiny thing.
How much weight can you carry?

120
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,195
Each one of those bars
weighs 27.5 pounds.

121
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:40,661
I played football.

122
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:44,387
We got our ten
million right here.

123
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:47,662
Time!

124
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:53,589
Sir, I've got 500 meters of dark
empty tunnel in front of me.

125
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:55,460
<i>Somebody screwed up.</i>

126
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,723
We're on the wrong block!

127
00:12:56,797 --> 00:12:58,660
<i>They're robbing a bank!</i>

128
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:00,390
Quick!

129
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:18,693
All right, let's do it.

130
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:46,063
Get that Brigadier over here.

131
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:47,596
<i>Get rid of this door.</i>

132
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:51,763
Let's go! Let's go!

133
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,763
Let's go, guys. Everybody out.
Move it!

134
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,888
Pull the chains around the right.
Go, go, go!

135
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:58,759
Hook them up to the door.
I want this door gone.

136
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:00,262
It doesn't have to be pretty.

137
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,661
Clear!

138
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,559
Let's go, guys, come on, move it!
Let's go!

139
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,028
Go, go, go!

140
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:13,121
They'll be in the vault.

141
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:22,096
Hey, what are you
young fellas doing?

142
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:24,595
Go on!

143
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,892
You should've just kept moving.

144
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,657
Did you have to hit him so hard?
He saw our faces.

145
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:32,458
No. Put it down.
No homicide.

146
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,758
No, I am not going back to prison.
Not again.

147
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:36,524
In this bag is enough
for us to disappear.

148
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:38,290
No need for any more jobs.
Let's just go.

149
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:44,359
Come on, guys.

150
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,590
What the hell are they doing?

151
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,921
Damn!

152
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:52,589
I have been to prison
and I didn't like it.

153
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:54,755
In fact, I fucking hated it!

154
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,920
Oh, shit!

155
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:03,395
Oh, my God.

156
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:05,396
Ah, you shot me!

157
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:08,022
Let's find the back
to this place.

158
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:11,154
Ah, oh, my God!
Be quiet.

159
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,190
What are you doing?
What happened?

160
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,354
He shot himself in the leg.

161
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,919
No! You shot me. Ah!

162
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:21,588
Oh, shit.

163
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:23,220
I left the money.
I have to get it.

164
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,456
What? No!
We're heated.

165
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:31,759
Let's go, guys, come on, move it.
Let's go!

166
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,318
God!

167
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:36,090
This sucks!

168
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,596
I want this guy nailed.
Now, everyone spread out.

169
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,596
What the hell are you doing?

170
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,596
He's on his own now, baby.
No, Will!

171
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:52,562
Your ride is gone.

172
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,425
Hoyt!

173
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:55,156
Hoyt!

174
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:04,986
Put your hands in the air!

175
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:37,559
<i>All units 217
on east side of Rampart.</i>

176
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,687
<i>Assault on two police officers.</i>

<i>Suspect has fled the scene

178
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,863
Oh, we got him.
There he is.

179
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,590
<i>Straight ahead.</i>

00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,853
He's on the upward ramp.

182
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,330
Shit!

183
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:45,222
God damn it, Fletcher!

184
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:32,762
Shit!

185
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,725
Come on, come on.
Cop. Let it go.

186
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:03,989
Shit, cop.

187
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,558
Don't shoot, man!
Get out of the way!

188
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:40,260
Will Montgomery. Bring out the
money and yourself, slow.

189
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,421
Real slow.

190
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:51,417
Stop.

191
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,860
Turn around.

192
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,987
On your knees.

193
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:04,429
My wedding day,
the birth of my twins,

194
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,758
and now this.
Highlights, Will.

195
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,921
<i>I'm talkin' highlights.</i>

196
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:10,963
Cuff him.

197
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,921
Hey!

198
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:15,122
Where's the money?

199
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:27,857
Fletcher.
How you doin', Will?

200
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,521
Hope you got raped every day.

201
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:31,926
Harland wants
to give you a lift.

202
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:37,324
He's not asking.

203
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:47,087
Welcome home.

204
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:48,788
Harland.

205
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:53,259
So, where to?

206
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,124
Coronado and Prentiss.

207
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:10,059
So, how's
the federal penal system?

208
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,561
Not as tough as they say, huh?

209
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:14,720
How's the wife?

210
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:19,558
She's good, I guess.
She left you?

211
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,060
Four years ago.

212
00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:22,254
I'm sorry.

213
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:25,462
You ought to be.

214
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:31,225
Why'd you pick me up, Harland?

215
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:33,888
I thought you might
pick up where you left off

216
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:36,394
now that you're
as free as a bird and all.

217
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:41,259
No, it's all behind me now. You
could probably afford to retire now

218
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:45,193
with that sizable withdrawal
from Parish Community you made.

219
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:47,524
You knew if you got caught
with money you'd be looking at

220
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:50,426
an extra ten years,
so you ditched it somewhere.

221
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,223
And now that you're out

222
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:55,194
I thought you're gonna
go get that ten mil.

223
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:57,751
Aren't you, Will?
Much like a squirrel

224
00:22:57,863 --> 00:23:01,386
returning back to its horde
after a long cold winter.

225
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:04,759
I'm not the squirrel playing
with his nuts here, Harland.

226
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,091
I don't have the money.

227
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:10,424
You know that Vincent
is dead, right?

228
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:16,887
I don't think he knows,
do you, Agent Fletcher?

229
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,792
How does that make you feel?

230
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,420
He was my friend.

231
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:27,588
Yeah. He had a tough time
of it after you left.

232
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:30,390
You being the brains
behind the operation.

233
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,954
I guess he owed money
to the wrong people.

234
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:45,019
Your ex-wife's place, huh?
I'm not here for her.

235
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:49,858
You really think your kid wants to see you?
I'm about to find out.

236
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,225
Grandma Harland used to say
love makes time pass,

237
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:57,422
but time is certain
to make love pass.

238
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:03,428
Can I enjoy my day now?
Thanks for the lift.

239
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:05,622
<i>Oh, happy Fat Tuesday, Will.</i>

240
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:15,562
<i>I'm starting to think
you like the guy.</i>

241
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:18,094
Admiring someone
doesn't mean you like them.

242
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:20,321
<i>Let's go, Fletcher.</i>

243
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:30,254
Hi. What are doing?
You scared me.

244
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:32,817
I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry.

245
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:38,554
When did you get out?

246
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:41,561
This morning. I know I should've called.
I didn't have a number.

247
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:43,424
You look like your mom.

248
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,257
She's not here, is she?

249
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:46,760
She's in Shreveport.

250
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:50,557
With Mr. Loeb. Yes. With David.

251
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:56,920
This came for you this morning.

252
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,858
It was just left on the mat.

253
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:01,225
Thanks.
Can we talk?

254
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:04,160
I really should get going.
Just for a few minutes.

255
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:17,089
I have something for you. I saw it on the way in.
Reminded me of you.

256
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:20,151
Oh.

257
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:29,259
Cool.

258
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,590
No one sets out
to be a criminal,

259
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,220
but through...

260
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:37,955
but through...

261
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:42,194
I've had so many
conversations with you.

262
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:48,422
Now that you're
sitting across from me,

263
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,791
it's like my mind
is going blank.

264
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,590
No one sets out
to be a criminal, Alison.

265
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:10,152
But through circumstances,
bad choices, needs,

266
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:14,422
unforeseeable obstacles,
unreliable friends,

267
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:16,552
dishonesty, life intervenes.

268
00:26:16,628 --> 00:26:18,924
And I'm not trying
to justify it.

269
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:23,088
I'm not making excuses for it.
I was a bad man.

270
00:26:23,162 --> 00:26:31,154
But I've had eight long years
to get rid of that man.

271
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:38,258
To ready myself
to get to know you.

272
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:39,817
I have to go.

273
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:53,422
Where are you going?

274
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:54,688
I told you, I'm late.

275
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:56,887
Late for what?

276
00:26:56,996 --> 00:26:58,393
My shrink session.

277
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:02,393
I go every Tuesday.
Really?

278
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:07,054
Yeah. Apparently
I have abandonment issues.

279
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:08,321
Go figure.

280
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:17,419
I meant what I said, Alison.

281
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:33,489
Keep it.
I'm not seven anymore.

282
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:41,651
Alison.
Just go, please.

283
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:20,918
Thanks for
the visual massage, Pete.

284
00:28:20,996 --> 00:28:23,053
Riley, you are just
too damn fine, girl.

285
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:25,424
When you gonna
give me the time of day?

286
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,053
Well, let me call your wife
and see when you're available.

287
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:32,083
Aah. Why you gotta bring her up?
Talk about a buzz kill.

288
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:35,753
You have a good one.
You too.

289
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:37,988
Now, how is it
that after eight years

290
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:40,493
you have only gotten younger?

291
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:44,693
Oh, my God.
Will.

292
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:47,023
I can't believe it.

293
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:49,254
When did you get out?
This morning.

294
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,521
You should've let me know,
I would've picked you up.

295
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:54,527
That's all right. Agent Harland was
kind enough to give me a lift.

296
00:28:54,595 --> 00:28:59,289
You're kidding. That guy needs
to get laid, like, yesterday.

297
00:28:59,395 --> 00:29:01,054
Hmm.

298
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:03,391
Let me get you a drink.
Tequila?

299
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:05,758
Yes, ma'am.

300
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,886
What the hell, Riley,
you're working in a cop bar?

301
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:14,553
Yeah, well, you know, it's a good way to guarantee
I don't go back to wrong. Back to wrong?

302
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,116
Yeah. Self-restraint was
never my strong suit.

303
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,386
I'm honored
to be your first stop.

304
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:28,394
Actually, I dropped
by Alison's first.

305
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,121
Oh. And how is she?

306
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:35,190
Not as honored.

307
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:37,591
Don't worry, Will,
she'll come around.

308
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:42,094
I missed you, Will. I never got to
thank you after all that went down.

309
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:45,559
Don't mention it. I wasn't
allowed to come visit.

310
00:29:45,628 --> 00:29:49,355
My lawyer wouldn't let me, and Harland
never really stopped sniffing around.

311
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:52,223
So I just...
I know. I know.

312
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:57,091
But you not ratting us out really
means something in my book.

313
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,059
Like I said...

314
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:00,719
You could've
ratted out Hoyt, though.

315
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,919
That I wouldn't have minded.
Hoyt.

316
00:30:02,995 --> 00:30:06,086
Yeah, I'm looking for that guy.

317
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:10,855
And I take it
you heard about Vince.

318
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:12,189
Yes. That's terrible.

319
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:14,454
I mean, he went really dark.

320
00:30:17,828 --> 00:30:19,919
Well, I mean, do they
know who killed him?

321
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:24,257
No, I don't think so. He was hanging
out with the sketchy crowd.

322
00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:27,658
Looking for the new you,
I suppose.

323
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:29,160
It's good
to see you again, Riley.

324
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,655
I think we woke up
your package.

325
00:30:43,495 --> 00:30:47,359
<i>Riley. Can
you change a tap?</i>

326
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,394
Two beers.

327
00:30:48,462 --> 00:30:49,325
Be right back.

328
00:30:58,328 --> 00:30:59,589
Hello?

329
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:03,253
<i>Hello, Will Montgomery.</i>

330
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,254
Who is this?

331
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:12,590
You don't recognize
my voice, Gum?

332
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:16,150
<i>I wanted to be there for you
at the prison. Vincent?</i>

333
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:18,057
<i>Give you a welcome
when you got out.</i>

334
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:21,356
<i>But you know how it is,
time just slipped away.</i>

335
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:23,394
<i>Well, hallelujah, man.
You're alive.</i>

336
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:27,894
Shit. You know what? Everybody's
telling me you're dead.

337
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:31,757
<i>I suppose that depends on your
interpretation of the word "dead."</i>

338
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:36,352
<i>'Cause I'm certainly not living.</i>

339
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:39,757
Well, where are you? Can we meet?
How are you?

340
00:31:39,828 --> 00:31:42,760
The years you've been gone
have not been kind to me, Gum.

341
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:44,885
Constantly running
from loan sharks,

342
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:48,257
<i>the feds, broker than
a dead-dicked dog.</i>

343
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:49,691
<i>I couldn't get another swipe.</i>

344
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:52,057
I am sorry to hear about that.

345
00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:53,923
You listen to me, Gum.

346
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,893
I have been waiting
eight years for this.

347
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:58,654
Go ahead.

348
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:00,922
I had to change my name,
erase everything.

349
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:03,688
And then there's that little
matter of the bullet in my leg.

350
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:08,591
A constant friendly reminder of the
partner who ruined my life that night.

351
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:11,025
Come on, man. Really?
We're gonna go back there?

352
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,391
You did that to yourself.

353
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:15,019
Semantics.
I want my share.

354
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:18,527
I want my share
of the $10 million

355
00:32:18,594 --> 00:32:21,220
<i>that was gonna
change our lives forever.</i>

356
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:23,227
Vinnie, there is no cash.

357
00:32:23,295 --> 00:32:30,023
I had a feeling
you'd say that, Gum.

358
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:32,526
I burned it just before
Harland got to me.

359
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:35,424
No. Stop it.

360
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:37,358
<i>It's true.</i>

361
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:39,916
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

362
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:41,688
Hold on.

363
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:45,091
Wait a minute. Who...
That voice, who was that?

364
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:48,820
Oh, that's right, you don't know.
I'm a cab driver now.

365
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:51,416
My fare
is this sweet little girl

366
00:32:51,494 --> 00:32:53,085
trying to get
to her shrink's office

367
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:55,093
so she can discuss
her daddy issues

368
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:59,593
and how they have manifested
into an unhealthy disdain

369
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:02,626
for the world at large.
Hey, what are you doing?

370
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,752
Hold on, please, Gum.

371
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:08,419
Sorry, Miss,
terrible Fat Tuesday traffic.

372
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:10,722
Be there in a jiffy.

373
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,760
See how it lays?

374
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:15,090
<i>Now, Gum, this all
depends on whether or not</i>

375
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:19,650
<i>you're gonna stick to your
story about burned cash.</i>

376
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:21,251
You touch her and I'll take you

377
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:23,260
down the levy
and kick your fucking ass.

378
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,384
I don't know if you
heard what I just said,

379
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,825
but this all depends on you.

380
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:30,824
Vincent!

381
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:41,293
He's on the move.

382
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:55,253
Where are we going?

383
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:07,927
<i>What are we doing?
Why are we in here?</i>

384
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:10,984
I hope you understand
this is not my preference.

385
00:34:13,794 --> 00:34:15,225
Help me!
No! Help!

386
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:17,556
I mean,
considering your father,

387
00:34:17,627 --> 00:34:19,593
I would never want
to add to your suffering.

388
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:22,888
But you see, Alison?

389
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:27,993
I've got a sickness.
I'm not well.

390
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:35,325
Your father abandoned me
in my time of need...

391
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:39,383
So I know what it is to be in the
position you're in. Really, I do.

392
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:44,189
I know what it is to be left
high and dry by Will Montgomery.

393
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,352
And you and me,
we're kindred spirits,

394
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:50,825
and I am going to make him
pay for the both of us.

395
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,117
Sorry.

396
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:04,818
I love you too, man.
You don't gotta beat the...

397
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:11,657
Vincent?

398
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:14,353
Gum.
Where's Alison?

399
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:17,484
Did you change your mind or are you
still sticking with the bullshit story?

400
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:20,254
Can I talk to her?
Alison...

401
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,816
is waiting for you to decide whether
she's going to remain fine.

402
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:25,257
Vincent, don't do this.

403
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:31,226
I'm hanging up now.
No, no, wait, okay, wait.

404
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:32,987
I can get it.

405
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,686
<i>I can get the money.
I just need time.</i>

406
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:39,249
It's not here.
It's in Tuscaloosa.

407
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:41,555
My lawyer has it in a trust.

408
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:45,559
So I need 24 hours.
You got 12.

409
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:49,184
<i>The phone in your hand, I'll be
tracking you with it at all times.</i>

410
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,556
Eight rings and you pick it up.

411
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:54,184
You miss a single
phone call from me,

412
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,692
Alison doesn't live.

413
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:57,420
Vincent.

414
00:35:57,527 --> 00:36:00,015
This is my last chance
to dance, buddy.

415
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,549
You haven't seen me recently.

416
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:04,388
Let's just say
I've got two left feet.

417
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:08,325
Hello?
Vincent. Hello?

418
00:36:57,627 --> 00:36:59,286
Hi, I need to get a phone.

419
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:00,917
I'm sorry, sir,
you're gonna have to wait.

420
00:37:00,994 --> 00:37:02,721
No, excuse me, ma'am.
I really need a phone.

421
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:04,259
Sir, I will be with you
in a moment.

422
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:05,418
How much is this one?

423
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:06,653
$29.99.

424
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:13,884
Do you want your change?

425
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:25,991
<i>Amtrak service to Tuscaloosa
is now boarding at Platform 2.</i>

426
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:27,024
Help!

427
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:29,889
Get me outta here!
Help!

428
00:38:39,994 --> 00:38:41,892
Fletcher, I can't hear you.

429
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,755
You lost him
on his first morning out.

430
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:48,759
Shit! Will Montgomery
is here to see you.

431
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,554
Send him in.

432
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:55,389
So your dead former partner, Vincent
Kinsey, has kidnapped your daughter

433
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,393
and is holding her
somewhere in New Orleans?

434
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:00,085
In a cab. The cab, yes, that's right.
In a cab, yeah.

435
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:02,684
And what does
he want in return?

436
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,726
$10 million.
$10 million.

437
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:08,884
Remind me why that's
a familiar figure.

438
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,892
I burned the cash.

439
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:17,059
Just before you grabbed me.

440
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:19,093
<i>William Montgomery.</i>

441
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,092
That's the God's honest truth.

442
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,251
'Cause I knew I'd get less
time if I ditched the money.

443
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:31,657
I don't have it, but he has my
daughter and I need your help.

444
00:39:31,727 --> 00:39:33,659
Why would I be here
if I had the money?

445
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:35,989
I would just pay Vincent off
and get my little girl back.

446
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,548
This is how I see it, Will.

447
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,217
You're a thief,
a crook, and a scumbag,

448
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,555
but you're also
a very clever tree frog.

449
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:45,922
So you concoct this Kinsey-is-alive-
and-has-snatched-my-kid fantasy

450
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:48,755
so that, A, you can show
that you don't have the money,

451
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:50,656
otherwise, why wouldn't you
pay the ransom,

452
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:53,921
or, B, send us
running around all over town

453
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:56,551
searching for your daughter
and her abductor

454
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:59,558
to afford you the time
to dig up the dough

455
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:01,592
and jump onto a cigarette boat

456
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,683
and zip down to the Bahamas
where you can sip rum

457
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,817
for the rest of your days
and listen to classic rock

458
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:13,053
played by bands with muscular
guitars and dead drummers.

459
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,255
Oh, my faithful bloodhound.

460
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:23,122
Couldn't find your couch
in the living room.

461
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:26,550
This is Vincent's file.

462
00:40:26,626 --> 00:40:29,092
The prints match,
as you can see.

463
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,887
They cut his body up
before they burnt it.

464
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,483
We got the prints off the few
fingers that survived the fire.

465
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,583
We can visit
his grave if you want.

466
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,421
No, we can't, because he's alive.
He faked his own death.

467
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:47,790
Please. Tim.
I'm running out of time.

468
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,917
I'm not being played
by you again, Will.

469
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,482
Fletcher?
Yeah.

470
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,255
All right, let's go.

471
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:00,091
Please help me.

472
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,324
Escort our pal out of
the building, will you?

473
00:41:06,426 --> 00:41:08,585
A little help, guys.

474
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,092
Well, Montgomery, on behalf of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation,

475
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,421
we'd like to thank you
for stopping by today.

476
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:18,152
Hold up. Hold up.

477
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,217
Harland thinks you're some kind of
criminal mastermind. Criminal mastermind?

478
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:35,054
I don't share this belief
because criminal masterminds

479
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,251
don't go away for eight-year
jolts, or do they?

480
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:01,254
One more, please.

481
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,626
Thank you.

482
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,989
We called Montgomery's
ex home and cell.

483
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:12,616
Both voicemails
say she's out of town.

484
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,919
Have you tried
his daughter's cell phone?

485
00:42:19,993 --> 00:42:22,391
The account's been suspended
per request of the stepfather.

486
00:42:27,093 --> 00:42:29,184
Get local PD on it.

487
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:31,748
If she has been kidnapped, we're
FBI, we do something about it.

488
00:42:31,827 --> 00:42:33,417
You don't think
he's telling the truth?

489
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:34,013
No, I do not.

490
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,023
Hey! Is there
anybody out there?

491
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:05,252
<i>Hello?</i>

492
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,091
Jacobs.

493
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:17,652
Crap.

494
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:29,754
We have a problem.

495
00:43:52,993 --> 00:43:54,891
That's good.

496
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:56,652
<i>Alright, keep tracking
him to Tuscaloosa.</i>

497
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,589
If he deviates from the
route, let me know.

498
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:28,426
Yeah, you are the exactly the woman I
want to see in clothes that tight.

499
00:44:35,326 --> 00:44:37,189
The only thing with any balls

500
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:41,123
to come to this town
was the hurricane.

501
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:42,420
Get away from the car!

502
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,421
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cab's off duty.

503
00:44:46,493 --> 00:44:48,322
Good day, mate,
how are you doing?

504
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:53,257
Look, I just gotta get
to... Cab's off duty, man.

505
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:56,723
Yeah, mate. Look, I've just gotta
catch up with these chicks...

506
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,019
Hey!

507
00:44:58,059 --> 00:44:59,320
Please?

508
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:03,456
Help!

509
00:45:10,826 --> 00:45:13,019
Mate, I haven't had my donger
dipped since I got here.

510
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:17,686
Ah, let's see.

511
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:19,123
Yeah, mate?
Mate, I'm trying.

512
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:27,183
One of them is preggers,
eh, yeah, I know.

513
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:28,724
Mate, I better get off the blow

514
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,281
or this cabby's
gonna chuck a wobbly.

515
00:45:34,093 --> 00:45:36,388
Hey mate, so let me tell you
about these sheilas, eh?

516
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:38,721
So the preggers one,
she seemed most interested.

517
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:41,258
Buggered if I know why, but
my willie's about as lonely

518
00:45:41,326 --> 00:45:43,689
as bandicoot on a burnt ridge.

519
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:45,588
I don't know
about these chicks.

520
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,852
They're quite different
in New Orleans, aren't they?

521
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:51,881
New Orleans all comes back...

522
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:55,391
to a pudgy kid by the
name of King Louis XV.

523
00:45:55,459 --> 00:45:57,789
King Louis XV,
he owned all this.

524
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:01,985
<i>...fellow Frenchman to
cross the ocean and visit.</i>

525
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,547
But it wasn't happening.

526
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:05,682
So in order to get
some use out of it,

527
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:10,589
finally he starts shipping over
boatloads of French prisoners.

528
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:13,251
What's crawlin'
up your ass, bugger?

529
00:46:13,325 --> 00:46:16,917
<i>Thieves, gamblers,
prostitutes, murderers,</i>

530
00:46:16,993 --> 00:46:20,720
<i>pirates, gypsies, pickpockets,</i>

531
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:22,122
and psychopaths.

532
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:25,284
<i>Is this me stop?</i>

533
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:35,116
Those are the pioneers
of this land,

534
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:39,125
and the forefathers
of this town

535
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,918
that you casually dismissed.

536
00:47:11,158 --> 00:47:13,556
<i>All the computers in this
building are tracked.</i>

537
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,386
This is the page
that corresponds

538
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:20,892
to the exact moment in the
video where he stops.

539
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:25,891
This is Agent Harland. I need an assault
team at apartment 9, 23 St. Claude.

540
00:47:43,258 --> 00:47:45,588
Billy, shut up!

541
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:47,750
Stupid, stupid dog!

542
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,519
I'm gonna skin you and make
a pair of shoes out of you!

543
00:47:50,592 --> 00:47:53,080
I hate you and your owner!

544
00:47:53,158 --> 00:47:54,146
Shut up!

545
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:00,721
Jesus, Will!
Shut up!

546
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:02,382
Drop the bag.

547
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,049
It's my lunch.

548
00:48:05,158 --> 00:48:06,749
And that's my gun.

549
00:48:06,826 --> 00:48:08,519
Drop the bag.

550
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:16,554
That's for the last
eight years.

551
00:48:21,158 --> 00:48:26,352
Where's Vincent? Vincent?
Vincent's dead, man.

552
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:29,391
Try again. I swear.
I swear on my life.

553
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:31,584
I haven't seen Vincent... Oh,
that's right, I forgot.

554
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,887
It's not your brain
that you care about.

555
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:35,857
A bullet to the stomach
is the most painful.

556
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:39,085
And it takes hours to die.

557
00:48:39,158 --> 00:48:43,591
Okay, look, man, what do you wanna know?
What does he have you doing?

558
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:46,886
Nothing, baby. You know, bag
drops, recon, stuff like that.

559
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,550
He told me to drop off the phone for
you, so I dropped off the phone.

560
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:52,591
And my daughter?
My daughter!

561
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:55,523
The whole bottom fell out of our
operation when you went away, Will.

562
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:58,182
Look around you. Does it look like
I'm puttin' on the Ritz here?

563
00:48:58,225 --> 00:49:00,589
We want our share.
Just our share.

564
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:08,418
So help me God, Hoyt.

565
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:13,083
You tell me where she is or I'll blow
your lunch all over this carpet.

566
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,920
He's driving around with her
in the trunk of his cab.

567
00:49:16,992 --> 00:49:20,186
In the trunk? And I gotta
be honest with you, Will,

568
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:23,224
'cause I didn't think the taking
your daughter part was right.

569
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:27,691
I mean, bad idea to steal from
America's greatest bank robber.

570
00:49:35,492 --> 00:49:40,254
After he lost the leg, something
changed in him, Will.

571
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:42,587
He said he just
felt numb to everything.

572
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:44,920
Numb like a statue.

573
00:49:44,992 --> 00:49:47,083
He blames that on you, Will.

574
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:51,488
He blames the leg on you. He said
he also blames the numb on you.

575
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:16,081
Go!

576
00:50:41,758 --> 00:50:43,224
Let the squirrels squabble,

577
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:44,780
and then we'll go
after their horde.

578
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:54,091
Hold it.

579
00:51:08,492 --> 00:51:09,321
Come on, go!

580
00:51:22,258 --> 00:51:24,417
Will, stop!
Stop!

581
00:51:24,491 --> 00:51:25,923
Stop, stop, stop!

582
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:06,614
Street level.
Go.

583
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:20,552
What the hell are you doing?

584
00:52:20,624 --> 00:52:22,988
Man, you listenin', Tapioca?

585
00:52:24,324 --> 00:52:25,483
Just go, please.

586
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:29,052
Medallion.

587
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,147
License and
registration, please.

588
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:53,955
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

589
00:53:56,257 --> 00:54:00,189
I do not.
Brake light's out.

590
00:54:00,257 --> 00:54:03,246
What's funny? Nothing.
It's just, it's Mardi Gras

591
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,586
and the streets are filled
with drunken lunatics

592
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:08,749
and you pull me over
for a broke brake light.

593
00:54:10,257 --> 00:54:12,086
Help!

594
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:15,089
Reminds me of when my father
was dying of bone cancer,

595
00:54:15,157 --> 00:54:17,715
all day he'd bitch about the
nick he got in his chin

596
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,086
from shaving that morning.

597
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:21,851
I know what you're thinking.

598
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,788
Why would a dying man shave?

599
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:27,021
No.

600
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:28,580
I wasn't thinking that at all.

601
00:54:28,658 --> 00:54:30,248
Get this vehicle
back to the barn.

602
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:32,222
Get that light taken care of.

603
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:37,888
Please!
Can you hear me?

604
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:41,446
<i>'Cause he had
tremendous vanity!</i>

605
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:47,415
Sir, do you mind coming around
here to open the trunk?

606
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:54,048
He did not go gently,
my father.

607
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,750
He screamed a lot.

608
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:58,824
The pain was agonizing,
searing.

609
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:03,184
Eels squirming
through his veins.

610
00:55:03,257 --> 00:55:05,246
Buddy, I really
don't give a damn.

611
00:55:46,957 --> 00:55:48,583
Somebody help me!

612
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:49,419
Help!

613
00:55:50,257 --> 00:55:52,314
Help!

614
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,913
Somebody please help!

615
00:55:53,991 --> 00:55:54,820
Gotcha.

616
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:58,923
Come here.

617
00:55:58,957 --> 00:56:02,685
You're more like him than I thought.
You don't remember me?

618
00:56:02,757 --> 00:56:05,383
You were young, I guess, and I
did look a little different.

619
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:09,254
I had all my fingers then,
and both legs.

620
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:13,586
Ah, nice fingers, sweetie.

621
00:56:13,658 --> 00:56:16,714
You know, the FBI, they use they
little lines in order to find people.

622
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,586
That's how they were
looking for me anyway.

623
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:22,021
But one day
I came up with a plan.

624
00:56:22,091 --> 00:56:24,080
Yeah, I dug up a body.
See, it wasn't hard.

625
00:56:24,157 --> 00:56:26,055
Resemblance was reasonable.

626
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:28,215
Then I cut him up
into small pieces.

627
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:31,257
And added a little
of myself to the mix.

628
00:56:31,324 --> 00:56:33,517
I was a golden boy, doll face.

629
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:36,580
Now I'm a freakin' Picasso.

630
00:56:41,657 --> 00:56:43,590
And don't ever mess
with my lights again.

631
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,590
What are you
looking at, shrimp?

632
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,553
Listen, brother, take the cab,
take the money in the cab,

633
00:57:00,623 --> 00:57:02,146
I don't give a crap,
but don't take me.

634
00:57:02,224 --> 00:57:04,053
What is this?
It's a meter.

635
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:06,749
No, I know what a meter is, asshole.
Not that, this.

636
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:09,585
It's a GPS. Everyone has 'em
in case the cars are stolen.

637
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:12,089
Tells you their location?
Within a few blocks, yeah.

638
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:15,714
All right,
call your dispatcher.

639
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,416
Man, you have got to clean out that
backseat before you sign off tonight.

640
00:57:19,491 --> 00:57:22,218
Yesterday I had
to put on a biohazard suit,

641
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:24,688
hip waders and rubber gloves,
and I got the garden hoe

642
00:57:24,757 --> 00:57:27,053
and scraped
that crap out there.

643
00:57:27,124 --> 00:57:33,920
Looked like boogers or jalapeño jelly, Bertrand.
I got a question for you.

644
00:57:33,991 --> 00:57:37,424
Nine inches, and can reload
after 14 minutes and a tickle.

645
00:57:37,491 --> 00:57:40,423
<i>What else do you want to know?</i>
About the driver.

646
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:43,581
Is this about me docking your pay
again 'cause of the fender bender?

647
00:57:43,657 --> 00:57:46,555
The same policy applies for
everybody, and I ain't lifting it.

648
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:53,048
No, it's not about that.
White guy with a fake leg.

649
00:57:53,124 --> 00:57:56,749
He's a white man with a fake leg.
Maybe some missing fingers.

650
00:57:56,857 --> 00:57:58,187
Really?
Tell him!

651
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,190
And maybe missing some fingers.

652
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:03,382
Are you messing with me today?

653
00:58:03,457 --> 00:58:06,049
<i>What you want him for?</i>
He cut me off at a light.

654
00:58:06,124 --> 00:58:08,056
<i>And you think
I give a snot, huh?</i>

655
00:58:08,124 --> 00:58:10,715
Tell him he's stealing money,
you saw him pocketing fares.

656
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:13,222
He's stealing fares.
Pocketing.

657
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,552
Wait, are you saying
that the creepy limping bastard

658
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:18,919
be running around
sneetching my dough?

659
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:21,582
Get his location.
Where is he right now?

660
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:23,680
What you wanna know that for?

661
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:26,087
I'll confront him for you.
Get the truth.

662
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,513
You would do that
for me, Bertrand?

663
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,817
You're a good boss.

664
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:42,189
He in the French Quarter. Burgundy and St.
Philip. Thank you.

665
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:43,688
Well done.

666
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:45,416
Get his medallion number.

667
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,218
And his medallion number.

668
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,415
Man, he a freaky deak dude.

669
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:52,513
<i>You best be
careful there, Berty-boy.</i>

670
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:53,749
Get out.

671
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:55,449
It's all yours, brother.

672
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:00,383
<i>Five-kilo-two-zero.</i>

673
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:05,651
Again, that's 5K20.
Thanks, pal.

674
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:09,884
Looky here, did you just turn
white on me all of a sudden?

675
00:59:09,957 --> 00:59:11,082
Who dat is?

676
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:05,915
Remember where
we dropped off Montgomery?

677
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:07,547
His daughter's address?

678
01:00:07,623 --> 01:00:09,418
Yes, Coronado and something.

679
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:12,217
Prentiss.
Hey, boss?

680
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,018
A guy matching
Montgomery's description

681
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:16,522
just jacked a cab
five blocks from here.

682
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,556
Get this, the cabbie said
he was sweating him

683
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:20,589
about a guy missing
a leg and his fingers.

684
01:00:20,657 --> 01:00:24,145
They're tracking the stolen
cab back into the Quarter.

685
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:54,913
Don't hurt me, man!
Whose cab is this?

686
01:01:55,023 --> 01:01:56,989
It's mine.

687
01:01:57,023 --> 01:01:58,649
But that ain't my number.

688
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:01,078
Open the trunk.

689
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,812
There he is. We got him.

690
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,649
Whoa.
That's somebody else's GPS.

691
01:02:12,123 --> 01:02:14,214
Montgomery! Get your God
damn knees on the ground.

692
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:17,688
Will Montgomery, you are under
arrest for violation of parole,

693
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:20,382
illegally accessing
confidential FBI records,

694
01:02:20,457 --> 01:02:24,253
<i>assaulting a federal agent,
and resisting arrest.</i>

695
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:27,221
We're bringing him back now.
You've gotta listen to me.

696
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:29,654
No we don't.
He's gonna kill her.

697
01:02:29,724 --> 01:02:31,349
<i>Oh, it's a neat story.</i>

698
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,412
Vincent Kinsey has
come back from the dead?

699
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,615
<i>Yeah.</i>

700
01:02:36,756 --> 01:02:38,222
Me, if I were
coming back from the dead,

701
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:40,222
it wouldn't be
for daughter killing.

702
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,881
It'd be to go to Rick's Cabaret
to see some naked ladies.

703
01:02:45,156 --> 01:02:48,054
I gotta take that. Ah, you
want me to take a message?

704
01:02:48,123 --> 01:02:51,248
I've only got eight rings to pick
up that call. Hey, sit back.

705
01:03:31,457 --> 01:03:33,752
Hello?

706
01:03:33,823 --> 01:03:35,982
Hi, I'm here.
I'm here.

707
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:43,522
I'm here.

708
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:46,385
Really coming down to the
wire on this one, eh, Gum?

709
01:03:46,457 --> 01:03:49,684
Have trouble getting it
out of your pocket?

710
01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:52,586
I'm not.
I just, I just...

711
01:03:52,656 --> 01:03:54,088
Sounds like
you're out of breath.

712
01:03:54,156 --> 01:03:55,883
Tell me something, Gum.

713
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:58,456
What's the scenery like
down there in Tuscaloosa?

714
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:00,479
<i>I always wanted to take
that ride along the Gulf.</i>

715
01:04:00,556 --> 01:04:02,420
I don't have it.

716
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:04,388
Or better yet, why don't you
tell me how Hoyt's doing,

717
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:06,218
<i>seeing as that's
where you were anyway?</i>

718
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,915
I don't have the money.

719
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:10,717
What did I say to you
about lying to me?

720
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:13,755
I'm sorry, I just, I just...

721
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:18,755
Your daughter's dead.
No, wait! Wait!

722
01:04:18,823 --> 01:04:22,017
You really
don't have it, do you?

723
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,578
- I'll get you the money.
<i>- Good.</i>

724
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:25,986
May I ask how?

725
01:04:30,456 --> 01:04:32,479
By going back to wrong.

726
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:43,889
He got away on foot.
He went down the alley, okay?

727
01:04:43,956 --> 01:04:45,546
We gotta set up a perimeter.

728
01:04:45,622 --> 01:04:47,588
Let's move.
Clear out!

729
01:05:32,923 --> 01:05:33,752
Hello?

730
01:06:26,456 --> 01:06:28,082
What's going on?

731
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:30,019
Why are the feds after you?
There's no time.

732
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,385
Vincent's alive. What? What
are you talking about?

733
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:36,718
He wants $10 million. He wants it
in three hours, and he has Alison.

734
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:37,584
Oh, my God.

735
01:06:39,556 --> 01:06:41,079
The bank we robbed that night,

736
01:06:41,155 --> 01:06:43,054
there was something else
in the vault.

737
01:06:43,122 --> 01:06:45,918
A gold reserve, there must've
been 100 million, easy.

738
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:47,751
There's no way
you can walk in there

739
01:06:47,823 --> 01:06:50,550
and steal $10 million
worth of gold bricks

740
01:06:50,622 --> 01:06:52,087
in the middle
of a business day.

741
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:54,713
But that's why
I need your help.

742
01:06:54,823 --> 01:06:56,846
I already told you,
this isn't my life anymore.

743
01:06:56,889 --> 01:06:59,753
I know. I know.
It's not yours either.

744
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:03,017
He's going to kill her.

745
01:07:03,089 --> 01:07:06,078
I, I can hear it in his voice.

746
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:09,383
He's not the same person.

747
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:13,251
He's going to kill
my little girl.

748
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:20,853
Okay.

749
01:07:20,923 --> 01:07:22,149
Okay.

750
01:07:33,656 --> 01:07:35,121
Oh, man.

751
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:44,247
You LeFleur? Yes sir, I am.
LeFleur, yes sir.

752
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:47,049
A guy jacked your cab a little while ago.
He was looking for someone?

753
01:07:47,122 --> 01:07:50,555
Well, he was looking for that
mope, Jimmy Morgan, sir.

754
01:07:50,622 --> 01:07:52,588
Be a peach and show me
his hack license, will you?

755
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:54,849
Yes, yes, officer, sir.

756
01:07:54,955 --> 01:07:56,785
I'll look it up
for you, inspector.

757
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,686
<i>He been with us two years.</i>

758
01:07:58,756 --> 01:08:00,914
Never any problem.

759
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:03,683
Although he do scare my kids

760
01:08:03,756 --> 01:08:07,381
when they come to visit
their daddy at work.

761
01:08:07,456 --> 01:08:09,251
My kids are in their 20s.

762
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,319
Vincent Kinsey.

763
01:08:17,622 --> 01:08:18,815
Much obliged.

764
01:08:20,155 --> 01:08:21,086
Let's go.

765
01:08:35,322 --> 01:08:38,254
Fat Tuesday,
everybody go crazy.

766
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:19,080
We're six blocks away from the
bank, you do realize that.

767
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,984
Have a little faith.
Okay.

768
01:09:24,255 --> 01:09:26,982
I've considered doing
this for the last 8 years.

769
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:08,285
Thirty meters, then we go left.

770
01:11:17,488 --> 01:11:21,216
Montgomery doesn't have the
money, but he needs the money,

771
01:11:21,289 --> 01:11:23,686
which means he's only got
one play left to make.

772
01:11:23,755 --> 01:11:27,915
Get me a list of every bank that he's
stepped into in the city of New Orleans.

773
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:30,716
My guess is one of them
he's going to step into again.

774
01:11:42,989 --> 01:11:43,784
We're through.

775
01:11:45,989 --> 01:11:48,285
Five minutes till the alarm.
Think that'll be enough?

776
01:11:57,388 --> 01:11:58,615
<i>Here it comes.</i>

777
01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:48,416
Fire alarm just went off
at Parish Community Bank.

778
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:50,818
<i>That's him.
Get us there now!</i>

779
01:12:57,188 --> 01:12:58,848
<i>Let's go, boys.</i>

780
01:13:17,388 --> 01:13:19,411
The alarm will have triggered by now.
We gotta go.

781
01:13:19,488 --> 01:13:21,888
I just want to see if I can get
a little more gold out of it.

782
01:13:25,588 --> 01:13:28,986
Come on, guys, let's go!
Go, go, go!

783
01:13:57,054 --> 01:13:58,418
Could you please hurry up, sir?

784
01:14:01,154 --> 01:14:02,983
Come on, Will, we gotta go.

785
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:06,819
Come on!

786
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:19,651
Huh.

787
01:14:22,054 --> 01:14:23,714
<i>Well, what do you know.</i>

788
01:15:06,555 --> 01:15:09,419
So, you worked all
this out from prison?

789
01:15:09,488 --> 01:15:11,078
I was bored.

790
01:15:14,655 --> 01:15:16,587
Boss, hey. Listen to this.
Say again.

791
01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:19,246
<i>We have the two suspects.
They're in Riley's truck</i>

792
01:15:19,321 --> 01:15:21,014
<i>on North Peters
headin' towards the ferry.</i>

793
01:15:21,088 --> 01:15:22,986
Do not take them
until they're off the ferry.

794
01:15:23,054 --> 01:15:25,918
I repeat, do not take them
until they're off the ferry.

795
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:28,420
We take them now.
We got 'em boxed in.

796
01:15:28,488 --> 01:15:30,885
<i>You don't corner a
weasel unless you wanna get bit.</i>

797
01:15:30,887 --> 01:15:33,046
I hope you know what you're doing.
Takes eight minutes

798
01:15:33,121 --> 01:15:35,916
to get across the river on that ferry.
Wait for strength in numbers.

799
01:15:35,988 --> 01:15:38,352
And when we get Montgomery,
he'll be as red-handed

800
01:15:38,421 --> 01:15:43,183
as the boy who put his palm on the gas
stove to see how hot it really was.

801
01:15:43,254 --> 01:15:44,242
Okay.

802
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:55,251
Don't make a move until all four
wheels touch Lousiana soil.

803
01:15:55,355 --> 01:15:56,548
<i>Copy that.</i>

804
01:16:25,154 --> 01:16:26,415
Hands in the air.

805
01:16:26,488 --> 01:16:27,646
Hands in the air now!

806
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:33,479
Happy Fat Tuesday, officer.

807
01:17:29,454 --> 01:17:31,545
Come on.
Come on.

808
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:34,745
Come on, get out.
Get out!

809
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:39,381
<i>Time is up, buddy.</i>

810
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:40,511
I've got it.

811
01:17:40,587 --> 01:17:43,883
Ah, I am impressed.

812
01:17:43,954 --> 01:17:46,385
You listen to a little
Creedence before you went in?

813
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:52,353
No, I didn't listen to CCR. That didn't
work out so well the last time, did it?

814
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,943
I missed you, old buddy.

815
01:17:54,054 --> 01:17:55,849
I want to talk to her.

816
01:17:55,887 --> 01:17:57,853
No, you'll talk to her
when you give me the money.

817
01:17:57,921 --> 01:17:59,546
I wanna talk
to my daughter now!

818
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:02,381
<i>I wanna hear her voice now!</i>

819
01:18:02,454 --> 01:18:03,920
It's your father.

820
01:18:03,988 --> 01:18:05,886
Hello?
Alison.

821
01:18:05,954 --> 01:18:07,749
Alison, did he hurt you?

822
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:10,878
No, but he scares me.

823
01:18:10,954 --> 01:18:13,182
I'm gonna be there soon.
I'm gonna get you outta this.

824
01:18:13,254 --> 01:18:15,685
<i>This is my fault.</i>

825
01:18:15,754 --> 01:18:19,743
Get my money
to the fairgrounds now.

826
01:18:33,954 --> 01:18:36,079
Sorry, boss.

827
01:18:36,154 --> 01:18:40,086
Finally starting to recognize the
skills of Will Montgomery, huh?

828
01:18:40,154 --> 01:18:42,244
You got those listings
from the cab dispatcher?

829
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,752
GPS breakdowns?
Yeah, why?

830
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:46,844
I told you Kinsey
ditched his GPS

831
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:48,910
in the back of a cab
in the French Quarter.

832
01:18:48,988 --> 01:18:51,510
I'm not interested in today's.
I wanna see the last few weeks.

833
01:18:51,587 --> 01:18:53,644
Kinsey's gonna get the
money from Montgomery,

834
01:18:53,754 --> 01:18:56,311
then he's gonna have to have
some kind of neutral rendezvous.

835
01:18:56,354 --> 01:18:58,752
And if that's the case,
he's been casing it for weeks.

836
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:01,049
Uptown, Lakefront,
Beauvoir, Gretna,

837
01:19:01,121 --> 01:19:02,882
West Bank.
Beauvoir?

838
01:19:02,954 --> 01:19:06,045
Is that the fairground?
Yeah, I think so.

839
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:08,177
Twenty minutes
from out of town?

840
01:19:08,253 --> 01:19:10,685
That doesn't sound like a cab ride to me.
Nicely done, boss.

841
01:19:10,754 --> 01:19:12,219
We might actually
catch this prick.

842
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,584
Where's Alison?

843
01:19:56,587 --> 01:19:58,280
In the trunk?

844
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:04,385
You look good, Will.
The same.

845
01:20:04,454 --> 01:20:06,886
Where is she?

846
01:20:06,954 --> 01:20:08,783
She's safe.

847
01:20:30,487 --> 01:20:32,715
The money.
Hand her over.

848
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,309
I said, hand her over!

849
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:40,878
You got the money.
You win.

850
01:20:40,953 --> 01:20:42,283
Vincent!

851
01:20:42,354 --> 01:20:44,377
Over a janitor.

852
01:20:44,454 --> 01:20:51,216
You piss away 14 years of
friendship over an old man janitor?

853
01:20:51,287 --> 01:20:53,878
We're not killers.

854
01:20:53,987 --> 01:20:55,783
Well, maybe not then.

855
01:20:55,821 --> 01:21:00,378
None of this has anything
to do with my daughter.

856
01:21:00,454 --> 01:21:02,215
But it does, Will.

857
01:21:02,287 --> 01:21:04,753
Because you truly love Alison.

858
01:21:04,821 --> 01:21:08,685
And in that single act
of betrayal eight years ago,

859
01:21:08,754 --> 01:21:14,414
you destroyed the only
thing I ever truly loved.

860
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,147
Me.

861
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:26,309
No! No!

862
01:21:29,654 --> 01:21:30,711
Daddy!

863
01:21:39,153 --> 01:21:40,380
<i>No!</i>

864
01:21:40,454 --> 01:21:41,613
Get me outta here!

865
01:21:46,654 --> 01:21:49,245
<i>Help!</i>

866
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,445
Help!

867
01:21:53,953 --> 01:21:55,976
<i>Daddy, get me outta here!</i>

868
01:22:02,287 --> 01:22:03,253
Help!

869
01:24:15,287 --> 01:24:17,616
I've gotcha.

870
01:24:57,053 --> 01:24:58,780
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

871
01:25:03,619 --> 01:25:05,380
I don't know what to do.

872
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:06,282
What do I do?

873
01:25:09,987 --> 01:25:13,078
No, no, no.
Don't die.

874
01:25:13,153 --> 01:25:14,641
Don't die.

875
01:25:18,486 --> 01:25:21,044
Somebody help us!

876
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,313
No, no, no.
You can't die.

877
01:25:25,953 --> 01:25:27,816
Just stay with me.

878
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:34,048
They're coming.
They're coming.

879
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:39,347
Just hang in there.
Over here! Over here!

880
01:25:39,419 --> 01:25:42,146
There.

881
01:25:44,152 --> 01:25:45,641
You're gonna be okay.

882
01:26:03,486 --> 01:26:05,247
Oh, Jesus.

883
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:08,047
No, no, no. He can't die.
You've gotta save him.

884
01:26:08,119 --> 01:26:10,813
Come on, let's
get him outta here.

885
01:26:27,486 --> 01:26:29,008
Are you gonna
send him back to jail?

886
01:26:29,086 --> 01:26:30,814
Now, why would I do that?

887
01:26:30,886 --> 01:26:32,715
I'm sure that Vincent
Kinsey stole that gold.

888
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:33,376
Take her up.

889
01:26:37,786 --> 01:26:39,581
Alison.

890
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,141
I'm here, Dad.

891
01:27:40,653 --> 01:27:43,517
<i>Hi, Dad.
I'll call a Hazmat team.</i>

892
01:27:43,586 --> 01:27:45,745
Why?
You're cooking again.

893
01:27:47,753 --> 01:27:49,809
Wake me up
if something happens.

894
01:28:08,486 --> 01:28:10,815
Don't you ever
clean your truck?

895
01:28:14,986 --> 01:28:18,214
Honey? Can you flip the
shrimp in three minutes?

896
01:28:18,286 --> 01:28:21,809
Let go of the control, Dad.
I got it. Letting go.

897
01:28:28,086 --> 01:28:30,881
Definitely more than $300,000.

898
01:28:30,952 --> 01:28:33,884
And the house can use
a new roof, kitchen...

899
01:28:33,952 --> 01:28:36,679
He's got it. He's got that
missing ten pounds of gold.

900
01:28:36,752 --> 01:28:39,218
That's what they're talking
about, somethin' enough for ya?

901
01:28:39,286 --> 01:28:41,650
Yeah, that is something.

902
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:45,674
Well, if you fence that gold... Oh, I know.
I know. They'll nail me.

903
01:28:45,752 --> 01:28:47,378
I can't see his lips.

904
01:28:47,453 --> 01:28:50,976
I'm gonna disappear it in the mud.
Okay.

905
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:54,478
Here.

906
01:28:56,752 --> 01:28:59,548
<i>He's not gonna throw it.</i>

907
01:28:59,618 --> 01:29:01,914
He just might, and if he
does, you ain't got jack.

908
01:29:01,986 --> 01:29:04,384
Don't throw it.
Throw it.

909
01:29:04,453 --> 01:29:05,931
<i>- Don't do it.</i>
<i>- Do it.</i>

910
01:29:05,952 --> 01:29:07,815
Throw it.
Don't do it.

911
01:29:07,885 --> 01:29:10,908
Do it. Throw it. Throw it.
Don't do it. No, no, no.

912
01:29:10,986 --> 01:29:11,815
Do it.

913
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:22,080
Sure, yeah, keep it, sell it.

914
01:29:22,152 --> 01:29:24,209
Get rich.

915
01:29:24,286 --> 01:29:25,649
And then go back to jail.

916
01:29:28,486 --> 01:29:31,475
Okay. All right.
It's going in.

917
01:29:43,618 --> 01:29:46,380
Oh, thank you, Will.

918
01:29:46,453 --> 01:29:48,282
I'll return to my life now.
