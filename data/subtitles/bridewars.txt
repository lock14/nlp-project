Do not touch



It all started 20 years ago,
in the Plaza hotel in the month of June



Two mothers were with
their daughters, Liv and Emma



here for a cup of tea



That afternoon was
a wedding instead



There was something blue, something borrowed
and something completely magical.



And two little girls from New Jersey
had a new dream



Once they discover that a
person on their side would ...



whatever happened.
And when the time comes ...



they will also get married in the Plaza



Thank you



And yes, Your Honor,
this neglected man



I knew my marriage is the most beautiful
day of my life



Now I want a creature until we have
six children and a house



They allow pets in the Plaza?



It is not that we marry
until we are sixteen, at least six times



- Can I be the bride?
- Emma, you know I always play the bride



- Not too shabbily,
- Cocktails, cigars, operation with white apron



- dancers and video recordings

that they are hurting right now.



Why should they?



- 20 years are inseparable .
- Okay, just slow down.



- I walk better with iPods .
- You can not run with iPods ...



because iPods are for people who
not have their own thoughts.

Complete.



And that brought these two brides
at my house that afternoon.



No, not now.
Forward.



I'm back in order.



I'm Marion St. Claire,
the most famous wedding planner in Manhattan.



Hi, we have an appointment for an hour.



We both married and
each other bridesmaid.



You are kidding,
that is incredible.



Ms. St. Claire can you
now received.



I'm Emma Allen.
- What an honor!



Put yours.
- Roger.



A wedding marks the first day,
for the rest of your life.



You were dead, until now.
You realized that?



You are now dead.



I understand.
- For example, Angela ...



will guarantee death.



I read the letter that they
you wrote about.



Two wedding in the Plaza.



Is there not a small possibility?
- If you went somewhere else ...



no chance.
But you're here.



Call me Dreamcatcher, I reply.



Dreamcatcher.



I happened to have
three options in the Plaza ...



in June.
Two first Saturday.



And last Saturday,
the sixth and 27th.



My parents their wedding anniversary
the sixth, it must.



My heaven.
- Yes.



Then I take the 27th.
- Fantastic.



Wil you discuss with your bruidegommen?
- No.



Okay, sign here and put
the date here.



This feels very good.



We need to discuss themes.
- Very little text.



And trendy fusion.



I am impressed.
- Really?



We love you.
Busted.



Your next customer is here.
- Thanks.



Very much.
- There are still front brochures for you.



Bride to bride, there is still
a room in June, at the Plaza.



Thank you, you are so sweet.



Mrs. St. Claire, first,
I'm obsessed by you



It is an honor ...
- Get down.



Yes.
- In June!



Watch them go, so blissful ignorance
of the difficulties ...



their marriage appointment.



June was three and
a half months removed.



A simple nod in marriage time.



My dear!



Miss Wang.



A corselet, ten layers of tulle ...



You have to adapt.
- No.



I am wearing my mother's dress.
- Emma, are you sure?



This is nice, but
her or your dream?



It is mine,
I want to surprise her.



But it is your day, send her
a box of chocolate on Mother.



And buy the dress you want?
- She is really beautiful.



And I love strapless.



It is as if I dress
my mother fraudulent.



I can not do
I think my decision.



Hang it back.



But if you want
you must apply again.



No, you saw him first.
- A terrible reason.



We apply this, right?
- I am fit.



It is perfect.



I know. Right?



I must continue to search.
- If there is a better than Vera Wang?



Hang it there, in addition to what
better than chocolate?



Buy the dress simply.
- What if you change your mind?



You must be careful with weight gain
for a wedding ...



you change so that he no Vera you fit
you change yourself into a Vera them.



Now seriously, I lost control?
See these eyes?



You know what that is?
Focus.



That's right.
Well, lenses and focus.



I buy it.
- Fantastic.



I get you some champagne.



Marion.



There is a terrible mistake.



A mistake never to
Marion St. Claire happened.



Your marriage has been made on the same day.



Say that again?
What?



Your wedding is booked for the same day.



Fl ...
- Are you crazy?



The Plaza is our life dream.



Angela confused the dates.



You are both on June 6 and
the other bride on June 27.



The next date is June 15.
- Well, that take me.



Within three years.



This is ...
- I can not ...



It is not a problem.
I consultations.



Production is my work, I rule that
the bride of date changes.



Believe me, you can not no
at that face.



Yes, but by trust obligation
I can not say who she is.



Which of you two choose
another date?



I am leaving now, Miss St. Claire.
- Good advice to you ...



use me as reference.



Hello, Angela.
- Tell us any other bride who is ...



and nobody touched injured.



How are you?
- You look beautiful.



You have been covered.
- You want me to adjust my date?



Yes.
- No.



You take the sixth,
give me the 27th ...



and it is your marriage partner.
- I have your fun, really.



Do not touch me.
- Let's talk.



Each marriage has a cost,
what is yours?



You can not buy.
- So again a thousand times no.



Good luck, ladies.



There is something wrong with you.



You is not leaving,
you until your ...



Only just the date.



Are you crazy?
- I think you're crazy.



You do not want to date once you adjust.



This is unnecessary.
- Will you.



Come on, a pleasant day.



We can sue.



We can sue them all,
the Plaza, the Marriott, all, and Angela.



That is not good.
It is up to us.



I want you on my marriage,
how this uitdraait ...



should any of us
take a different date.



Definitely.



I want you on my wedding, of course.



If we find no other way,
will any of us need to be flexible.



Someone of us should date change.



Right, that's a possibility.



Perhaps not one of us,
already ten years earn ...



because they compared with others
a hunger loontje deserves.



Where.



If the other of us,
not so desperate at the Plaza would ...



because the Plaza is the only pleasant
memory of her youth.



That is ...
- True.



Someone of us should date his herzetten.
- It will for sure.



And until one of us decided
we can not make concrete plans.



Agreed, there is some time
before we conclude.



Let's just do nothing.
Until someone's date herzet.



Talk to you soon.
Someone we call the other.



She has not called me.
They must date it.



She was always flexible, though as a child,
you know not?



Yes, she sounds not so flexible
I think.



Fletch I called and they took on.



He does my taxes tomorrow.
- You can not best friends.



Not now. Daniel can you
taxes yet do?



He is in finance.
- It is a 'hedge fund', honey.



We do not financially together.
- He is my accountant ...



for six years already, I will.
Do not be ridiculous.



Just do a double wedding.
- We are no 41-year-old twins.



Honey, a double wedding.



This is a great idea.
A great party.



No, I have my whole
life shared with Liv ...



I wish for once a date alone.



I know. Is this all the guest list?
- They are on the shoebox, no idea.



It is my dream
in the Plaza to marry.



I have been saving for my 16th.



I have only a few days,
so I find another dream.



It has better reasons than me.
- It's like 'American Idol' ...



Liv is the Simon ...
I mean nothing.



But you are Paula.
Even if they can not sing ...



give them a compliment about their clothes.
That is good.



But anyone listening to Simon.
- I would not marry Simon.



Give me Paula.



That is beautiful.
- Choose something ...



and find something. - Therefore, I
a bridesmaid. You may not care.



If you want to compete,
you know what to do.



The sooner the better.
We must let our guests know.



Exactly, so I kept the date back.



You do not worry.
- There is not.



Well, take your phone on it.
- Hello.



Men.
- Hey, Fletch.



No, not much. Only our
invitations to the rescue.



Is tomorrow still?
- Yes, you have some progress?



Liv is already there?
- No, she does not really admit.



They have a week more.
This is a century in the women's world.



What do they do with weddings?
- I have no idea.



Just the wrong time for your husband
to know that you are crazy.



Do you?
So I would not tackle.



She is here, I see you tomorrow?



Hi.
- Hello, darling.



How did the cheerleaders?
- I hate it.



I hate for teenage girls
insist on anything.



Aggressive, as if nothing else.



I call Liv.



Really?
- Yes.



Amie and Marissa will jointly
that party for us, and ...



it will be good for everything
behind us to have.



Are you sure?
- Yes.



Yes, I agree.
I spoke to Daniel, she is alone.



You can call her, they are
their invitations to save or something.



What?



Call her.



You must know real date ...



for you to send invitations.



We would wait.



And she ...
I believe it hardly.



Can you not believe?
It is Liv hear.



She wants to be the first.
- No, not this time.



I am also a bride.
I am also number one.



You're my number one.
If I think about it.



What are you doing?



Subject: Emergency,
this is not spam.



I go get married, six in June.
- You should not push so hard.



The Plaza hotel.
Be there ... XOXOKJA, SD



Address book. To everyone,
no, not you Liv. And send.



Emergency,
this is not spam.



I go get married, six in June.



KJA?



What is KJA, Emma?



'Great, Emma's wedding is
better than ours are, Glenn.



Perhaps our marriage
even better.



Not filled with loneliness and sorrow.



I hope you understand in
position Amy and I are.



We choose no side.
- Relax.



We plan not until
we have fish.



You go so well with it.
- Why not?



Without a way to choose is Emma's red
the day 'e-mail is not a bit tasteless.



I mean, the sixth in the June
Plaza and a smiley?



What next? A heart over the i.
What do they not?



That is so tasteless.



Is it not amazing.



Elizabeth, I think my ring great.



You sent your invitations?
- Yes, actually.



Surprised?



So both of us ...



moved its date?



You really surprised me, Liv.



You never asked me what I wanted,
you did just what you deemed best.



Emma is saying this ...
Well, Emma is the most tired.



Do not think that I have not noticed,
I fully panikeerde ...



since I first
dared to be engaged.



First and foremost, Daniel bought
the ring in December.



So officially, I was first.
- Pathetic.



Secondly, people can still
things you do not want.



As if you have no backbone.



Oh right, you have no backbone.



I do not accuse you of weakness.



You took the first date in June,
without me even asking.



I'm at least not as
afraid to be alone ...



people that I should order
through life to come.



Emma, you take pleasure.
- Say you, I take pleasure in Fletcher?



I thought not Fletcher.
Since you started on.



Herzet your date, Liv.
- Do you think it.



That has happened. You lose.



Your wedding can better be careful.



What did you just now?



I said that your wedding now
be very afraid.



If I was your wedding, then
I would sleep with one eye open.



Why do you
threats for Daniel?



Do you have his proposal
not removed, anyway?



So I did.
- Your wedding in the pot.



What you just said about my wedding?
- Your wedding in the pot.



Your wedding can ...
I mean ...



can not ...



Please say.



Bye, ladies.
- Hey, Liv.



Yes?



Your wedding will be huge.



Just like your ass on the prom
of school.



It is enough.



Emma and Fletcher, ...
On Saturday, the sixth of June, five hours ...



On Saturday, the sixth of June, five hours ...
Olivia and Daniel ...



Sixth of June at five o'clock.
Agreed.



Agreed.



Well, now only a
other bridesmaid.



And soon as you spend more
time with her than with the group.



Friends choose no party.
- Why should a friend?



No, no, just a bridesmaid.
Yes, eredame.



Yes, we were so close to the law school.



Honey, you are my second
best friend of my cousin ...



Of course, you first on my list.
Really.



Carla, Kaitlin?



Erin, no, I did not
he slept.



Okay, anyway.
Actually once.



Twice.



What is that?
He was a layabout.



He was lazy.



Is that so?
Really, I did not ...



Two children?
That must have been handsome.



Yes, tell him hello from me.



I'm actually in a taxi,
so I gotta go.



Kevin?



Yes.



I want you graduate.



Until erebruidsman.



Word you have paid?



It's just an honor.



I have a design for the classroom.
I think it is a great idea.



Because if you class something designed ...



Thankfully, you read on.



Read it for yourself.



Did you receive my note?
Can you take my late buscontrole?



Sure.



Deb ...
- Yes?



We are not really friends but ...
- Are we not?



Why I am proof you favor?
- That you do not.



Forget it.



Wil you be my bridesmaid?
- Can I choose my own dress?



All eyes are focused on me,
it must be good.



Absolutely.



I suggest something natural.
- I have a lot of help though.



What is the bride, do you think?
For the bridesmaid to help, right?



Come on, please?
- Okay.



Because you begged.
I'm your bridesmaid.



It is great.



It is great.



May I propose something?
Have you ever heard of Pinot Grigio?



This is a really good white wine,
very elegant.



Your music is still around.
DJ Humple is not available to date.



But I had an appointment with him.
In principle.



One of my other brides
gave a higher bid.



I can not say who, of course.
- The slut.



Not you, another.
The person.



She is frightening.



You do not think Liv ...
- Yes it is.



She knows what that meant for me.
It is too cruel.



Typically something for her.



Hey, I know.
Did you not think they would wear Vera Wang?



Yes.



I read that they are quite tight.
She was formerly quite thick?



No.



No, she is ...



This is good.



Great.



Just cream cheese.
It is cream, I test it.



Emma has her cake already chosen?
- Let us to remain.



As for the flowers ...
'U-Floria has ...



I do not have the same pie. And I want
white chocolate cake with seven layers.



Covered with marzipan.
With curls and flowers.



Then you're safe. Emma has a
smaller pie chosen.



And she wants people to
see how much they can spend.



I just checked my even ice sculptures.



My heaven.



That was a pitch to me.



Emma thinks that I want to show off.



I thought I had to show
how much money I earn.



Really, I did not understand.
- Marriott, eat it.



She Emma prefer.



Emma getting the sympathy vote.
I will never, right?



Maybe it takes too much of people.
- I was worried about cake.



In my chocolate
monticule with whipped cream.



Stop, what's that?



Dance lessons?
She is damn competitive.



Her dance will be better than ours.
Do just once canaries singing.



Lark, canary.
Why is there nothing in between?



Serve as a canary burnt.
- Video of their lives?



Really?



That must be Fletcher's idea.
Perhaps baby pictures of Emma ...



with a tooth or Fletcher
in a superheldenpak.



Tasteless.



Can I help you?
- Yes, order for Liv Lerner.



This is chocolate.
Admit it.



It is good.
You deserve this more, Liv.



Daniel Is not the sweetest?
I assume there is only one.



These.



Was she present?
- Yes.



And it is impossible to
of retrieval?



She has already eaten half the box.
That is 45 dollars.



That is what we had agreed.
But you do know ...



If you knew what is really going on,
would you my side.



Please do not tip?
- I thought that there Saturday



Anyway, I give you,
because I am a Paula.



Suppose you really Emma
its beginning to peddle dance.



Then there are ways.



Tell me more.



I do not know, maybe dance?



We know how to dance,
it is a slow. Just like in school.



It is a rod,
that should just accurate.



Anyway, Marion says that our
beginning of our relationship style dance shows.



Well, I am very concerned
on our relationship style.



Place.



I'm Rick Coo.
The Doctor of Dance. "



I get your emotion and rhythm.



I get your sex.



Put you please
on your feet and dance.



Are you ready for this?



Perhaps the Coo Rick Marion
'Doctor of Dance' is not so recommend.



That Ricky.



Well done, you warm up.



I received your voice-mail,
you of a lesson to four wanted.



How long are you here?



My heaven.



What?
