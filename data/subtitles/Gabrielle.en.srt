1
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,501
Today I'm coming home
earlier than usual.

2
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,601
I took the inner circle train

3
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:29,301
I worked hard.
I won't go by the Club.

4
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,501
I have the ease of contentment,

5
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,101
not disdainful, but confident.

6
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:37,601
A man with money and friends.

7
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,801
I'm tall and healthy.

8
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:44,301
Friends say I have the cold stare
of achievement,

9
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:47,501
like excelling in sports
or making money.

10
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:51,301
I'm not a sportsman,
but money comes easily.

11
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,301
l았e been married for ten years.

12
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:09,201
My wife is well bred and intelligent.

13
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:14,001
She was bored at home.
Her individuality had no play.

14
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,701
She seemed so much the right sort

15
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,901
that I succumbed to her charms.

16
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:23,201
Friends said I was very much in love

17
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,801
and I said so myself.

18
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:27,801
Every man falls in love
once in his life,

19
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,901
and that was the real first time.

20
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:34,101
Before, l았e had seemed
an unnecessary bother.

21
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,401
After we were married,
our circle of frends grew.

22
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:44,901
Fifty people became aware
of our existence.

23
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:48,201
Now thirty more invite us,

24
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,301
and we invite them.

25
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:54,001
Our dinners may be less famous
than others,

26
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,201
but many value ours more.

27
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:01,001
We're not being frivolous.

28
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,201
Those at our table are part of our set.

29
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:08,701
Men and women who fear
emotion and failure

30
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:11,701
more than fire, war, or fatal disease.

31
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,801
Let me give you the complete list:

32
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:37,201
A cuckold husband kills his wife.

33
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,001
A woman poisons her lover.

34
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,801
Infanticide. Patricide.

35
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:45,201
Virgins raped. Blood. Tears.
Death everywhere.

36
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:49,601
That압 theater today!
Revoltind stories that are all alike.

37
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,501
For there is my real misfortune

38
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:53,801
that looms up in life like a wall...

39
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,501
I look at my wife.

40
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,401
That placid face.

41
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,001
Gabrielle is perhaps paler today,

42
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,901
But that palor is part of her appeal.

43
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:08,201
l앐 proud of what she is: impassive.

44
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,301
She was like that ten years ago.

45
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,301
The same stol dity, the same smile.

46
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,401
You ove that.

47
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:19,201
t's monstrous! Like two hours
in your worst nightmares!

48
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:22,601
I always dream of very safe things,

49
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,701
with loving strangers.

50
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,001
I trust Gabrielle entirely.

51
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,601
She is candid and faithful.
I know her thoughts,

52
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:35,601
even her most secret ones,
and her dreams.

53
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,401
I never repeat what a stranger tells me.

54
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:41,901
I keep it to my self.

55
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,701
Not knowing me,
he didn't mean for me to repeat it.

56
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:48,601
There압 someone you still don앖 know?

57
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,901
What does it mean to know someone?
Who knows whom, in fact?

58
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:55,801
Well, I know Made eine,
and you, of course.

59
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:58,001
The others are enigmas.

60
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,801
Gnawing doubts are tiresome.

61
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,301
Take Jean, he압 an absolute fortress.

62
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:05,701
But not Gabrielle.

63
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,301
No, not Gabrielle.

64
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,901
Not Gabrielle, what?

65
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:15,201
I don앖 see the need to know people
to enjoy their company.

66
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,701
I have no taste for the secrets
Madeleine loves.

67
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,801
Jean's acquantance a one is enough.

68
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:32,501
I enjoy your company.
As you should ours.

69
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,901
Or should we do without it?

70
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:38,701
Idealist, sentimental,

71
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,401
and incensed.
not too much for one person?

72
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:59,001
One day,
to give her individuality fair play,

73
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:02,201
Gabrielle took up philanthropic work.

74
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:05,401
I took an active interest in politics.

75
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:08,901
Having met a literary man
related to an early.

76
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,401
I was induced to finance
a moribund newspaper.

77
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:15,701
It was utterly devoid of convictions.

78
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:18,201
And then it started to pay.

79
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,701
I'd made a good investment.

80
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,501
He said something...

81
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:25,401
Who, Francis?

82
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,501
He said he was tired of playing.

83
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,601
No one is obliged to play.
They can just watch.

84
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:34,601
Playing cards is normal.
Did he tell you?

85
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,501
He never speaks to me directly.

86
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:40,701
He압 afraid he might let himself go.

87
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,201
I think once let something slip
that he regrets...

88
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:48,501
Artist types started coming
to our house.

89
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:52,801
Our Thursdays became famous.
People from the paper joined us.

90
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:56,101
Why should Francis' attitude
affect your circle,

91
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,701
your home?

92
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,001
The editor, for one.

93
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,901
I must tell you about this editor.

94
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,001
Is it so important?

95
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,801
I don't like him.

96
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:10,201
He sits in the drawing room,

97
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,601
and taks for hours with a smile

98
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,401
on his thick lips.

99
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,101
He writes poetry.

100
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:18,601
He압 a jackass.

101
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:21,401
I shouldn't criticize, he's not alone.

102
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:23,901
That압 not what Francis said.

103
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,001
He said the game was over.

104
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,401
I remember now.

105
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,601
"Now, the game is over!" he said.

106
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:34,001
He also said he wanted
an illness to carry him off.

107
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:37,001
"But not too fast."
He wanted to be sure to die,

108
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:40,401
but to have t me to ponder his errors,

109
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:43,501
to take stock, so to speak.

110
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:48,001
What? A saint committing errors?

111
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,901
Then he's no saint.

112
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:52,001
"Stock" is no overstatement.

113
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:57,001
He hasn't spent an evening home
in the past 20 years.

114
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:58,401
A staggering notion.

115
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,301
If one is so clear-sighted,

116
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:04,101
how can one bear to go out so often?

117
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,101
What for?

118
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,901
- I'm going.
- Goodbye.

119
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:10,501
Especially if each outing
is chance to commit an error.

120
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,101
The Martineaus are expecting me.

121
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,601
Are they as good as us?

122
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:19,601
They're society people.

123
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,301
Aren't we all?

124
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,401
Some more than others.

125
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,501
You may never get invited
to the Martineaus.

126
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:28,701
If you are, we will be.

127
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,601
Don앖 worry about that.

128
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:36,301
Did Francis stop coming to us first,
or the Caste -Blanchets?

129
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,801
I'm lost.

130
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,701
The idea of it being us first!

131
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:43,601
Why come every other week?
Stop coming for good!

132
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:45,701
He압 not sure not to love us.

133
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,201
Francis never loved anyone.

134
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:49,901
So it압 easy to be a saint.

135
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,101
The love we give
makes us what we are.

136
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,601
How can you not love anyone?

137
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:57,601
Not knowing your own heart.

138
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,301
One day yes, one day no.
How awful.

139
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,001
I think he압 hiding.

140
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:04,401
Even his inflexibility,

141
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,601
everything people admire in him.

142
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,401
"Francis' love
is a step toward sainthood."

143
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,701
He invests energy in his mask.

144
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:16,001
The veneer's cracked.
Never hide your true nature.

145
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:20,501
We have a certain quantity of things

146
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:21,701
to do in life.

147
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,101
Some do them faster than others.

148
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,701
and after that, they collapse.

149
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:36,701
Did I tell you how met Gabrielle?

150
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,901
It was years ago, I remember well.

151
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:41,901
We were strolling up a lawn.

152
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:45,001
Groups of guests
were scattered in the sunshine.

153
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,301
Colored parasols
peeked through the trees.

154
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,501
It was a truly splendid day.

155
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:55,101
Nothing could possibly go wrong.

156
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:58,801
The women wore page summer dresses.

157
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,601
The men in their dark suits smiled.

158
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,101
It was like in a magic garden,

159
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:10,601
where animated flowers smile at bewitched knights.

160
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:11,901
Madam isn't in.

161
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:15,901
There was a sumptuous serenity
to it all.

162
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,901
I knew then

163
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,501
that hapiness was the lot
of all mankind,

164
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:25,201
and I wanted something
of that splendor for myself.

165
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,101
That day.
Gabrielle was crossing a meadow.

166
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,001
Seeing her
I thought nothing could go wrong

167
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,801
in a world of such distinction.

168
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:42,101
I was proud,
I wanted to grasp it firmly,

169
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:44,701
get what gratification I could.

170
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:47,801
That brutal desire seemed suddenly

171
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,001
the most noble of aspirations.

172
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:55,301
I checked to see
if we were being observed,

173
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:56,701
I felt inspired.

174
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,901
I spoke to her. I proposed to her.

175
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:03,001
And I married her. Ten years ago.

176
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,501
Gabrielle is no ordinary woman.

177
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:09,001
I ove her as a collector
does his most prized item.

178
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,001
Once acquired,

179
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:14,501
it becomes his so e reason to live.

180
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,201
In t me we came
to know each other enough

181
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:22,501
for all practice purposes.
That's important.

182
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:26,301
We have no intimacy, nor need of any.

183
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,601
My desire s appeased.
It's become a habit.

184
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:34,201
We share the same bedroom.
I insisted on that much.

185
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,701
I have no need for affairs,

186
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:41,301
just twin beds and two nightstands,

187
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,701
and Gabrielle in the other bed.

188
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:47,001
When we die, she will lie
in the grave next to...

189
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,301
Why write when she knows
i앏l be home for dinner?

190
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,201
A bit ridiculous, isn't it?

191
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,901
"Jean, in a hour I will have left...

192
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,701
"...go to a man...

193
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,801
"...hide it any longer...

194
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:49,301
"...it mey seem terrible and mad.

195
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,001
"It is terrible and right.

196
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:53,201
"Forgive me. Goodbye."

197
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:47,501
I'M NOT TO BE DISTURBED!

198
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:48,701
Youre muddy, there.

199
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:50,801
It's an ugly sight.

200
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,001
Why so silent?

201
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,001
Remorse?

202
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:00,901
Fear?

203
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,301
What's this letter?

204
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,801
A mistake.

205
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:09,901
A mistake? Three lines or so?

206
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,301
You leave as note
so there압 no turning back,

207
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:15,801
yet you do.

208
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:18,601
You, who always knows
the right thing to do...

209
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:21,801
But here you come back,
the ink still fresh.

210
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:26,601
I have no time to compose
the appropriate face.

211
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,301
You didn't accustom me to such folly.

212
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,701
There's nothing more to say.

213
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,801
It was honest.

214
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,101
Where's the honesty in all this?

215
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,501
When did you begin to be honest?

216
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:47,901
What are you now? Still honest?

217
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:50,001
There's nothing more to tell.

218
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:54,401
I couldn't do it.

219
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,701
Anyway, the law is on my side.

220
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:18,001
If at least you he died!

221
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:23,001
I would have beem offered condolences
and known how to reply.

222
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:24,701
That's a familar situation.

223
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,401
But no, you come back.

224
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,701
This is very humilliating.

225
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,701
Why on earth would my wife...

226
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,001
A cultured person,
mistress of the house...

227
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:40,401
throw away respect, comfort,

228
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,601
peace, decency, everything!

229
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,201
For what? For love?

230
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:48,401
There's no ove in it. It's passion!

231
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:57,701
Tomorrow every one will know
that you left. And why.

232
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:00,201
The servants will known tonight.

233
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:04,001
My wife is a monster,
and everybody will think me a fool.

234
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,401
In fact, youre a stranger to me.

235
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,801
What a horrible platitude!

236
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,601
Yet l앐 the one who said it.

237
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:22,501
You're a stranger, but I can be of help,

238
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:24,701
because l앐 prepared to listen.

239
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,801
Would it be of any comfort
if we talked about t?

240
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:32,701
Talked about him?

241
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:38,401
Good God!

242
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:41,401
One surprise after another.

243
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,301
But I know l앐 right.

244
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:53,601
You must be in pain.
It hurts to see you like this.

245
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:56,201
Would you like a glass of water?

246
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:04,001
I was just thinking,
do we entertain too much?

247
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,601
It crossed my mind.
But we must entertain.

248
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:10,301
What else can we do?

249
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:13,601
Are our attitudes and habits
out of proportion

250
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,201
with others in our circle?

251
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,901
Yes, all those men clinging
to your skirts.

252
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:22,901
As soon as I asked the question,

253
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,401
I knew the answer.

254
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,101
We simply do what we must.

255
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,101
Come over here.

256
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:35,201
Let압 talk.

257
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:52,401
You must tell me
what you really did today.

258
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:58,301
You won't tell me who, of course.

259
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:02,701
So just tell me
where the two of you were?

260
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:04,701
What did you say?

261
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:07,501
Thing like that are useful.

262
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,501
Nothing morbid about it.

263
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:14,301
I wrote
so as not to have to talk to you.

264
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:18,201
I don앖 know how to talk to you.

265
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:22,001
You don앖 believe that.
Of course you now how.

266
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,901
But youre reliving your meeting today.

267
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:29,101
Maybe youre starting to feel the shame.

268
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:31,901
Something must have gone on before.

269
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:33,701
You didn앖 just leave on a whim.

270
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:35,701
That압 not your style.

271
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:37,801
Look back at the circumstances.

272
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:40,901
Where were you?
Who? What? When?

273
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:43,401
The day the idea came up, the idea...

274
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:46,201
what sort of day was it?
Where you on your way to meet?

275
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:48,301
Or had you just parted,

276
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,301
surprised by a surge of love?

277
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,101
Was it something long-planned,

278
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,901
or just an idea out of nowhere?

279
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,001
Did he say something surprising,

280
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:01,101
and you backed away?

281
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,201
Or you walked n
and he'd forgotten you were coming.

282
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:07,901
He smiled. It wasn앖 planned,

283
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:09,601
but he was glad to see you.

284
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:12,601
Then he saw your imploring gaze...

285
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:17,301
Others have endured
such misunderstandings.

286
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:20,001
I thought you cleverer than that.

287
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:37,401
Your neck has such a lovely brush
when you're nervous.

288
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:43,001
Your skin reflects you every thought.

289
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:46,501
I can trace yourlife in each blue vein.

290
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,401
Theyre highly visible.

291
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:51,901
even the blood pulsing through them.

292
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:55,901
Some women never color.

293
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:59,401
Their skin reflects nothing.
not even light.

294
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,201
You have a friend like that,

295
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,301
white like some hideous candle.

296
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:16,201
The blood in your temples
appealed to me.

297
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,101
It did.

298
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:19,801
Appealed to me.

299
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:26,001
What should I say? That I forgive you?
is that it?

300
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,801
So here we are,

301
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:32,201
and I'm at leisure
to trace your thoughts and actions!

302
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,401
How far did you go?

303
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:44,801
What did you do?

304
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,801
and what brought you back?

305
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:49,801
I don't know.

306
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:05,601
And him? What did he expect?

307
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:10,201
When I decided to go to him,
I wrote the note.

308
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:13,601
So you saw a lot of him?

309
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,201
Then this letter is not the worst of it?

310
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:21,701
The worst is my coming back.

311
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:37,401
Temptation, Gabrielle,

312
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:40,101
excuses no one.
But there are the weak.

313
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:41,401
And there are

314
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,601
the envious and the fools.

315
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,201
I'm not to blame for this predicament.

316
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:54,701
But...

317
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,501
if nothing irreparable took place...

318
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:12,101
Well. I forgive you.

319
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,801
Stop it. Are you mad?

320
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:22,701
Enough!

321
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:25,701
They앏l hear you.

322
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:27,301
Drink this.

323
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:41,801
Are you mad?

324
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,901
Let압 go down to dinner.

325
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:46,201
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- It won't change anything...

326
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:48,801
Then you'I turn in, have a good cry.

327
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,601
I expect you for dinner!

328
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,601
No one should suspect a thing,

329
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:54,701
not even the servants!

330
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:58,401
Are we agreed?

331
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:03,001
I'll wait for you.

332
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:06,701
It압 already late.

333
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:36,201
You only have to wait on us.

334
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,101
Just wait on us.

335
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:47,001
Youre devoted
but don앖 enter my life.

336
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:49,001
I won't like you more for it.

337
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:54,001
Why enter my life?

338
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,601
Have I ever reached out to you?

339
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:17,001
Hurry up.

340
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,101
What do you think of the men
who come here,

341
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,201
who gravitate around us so much?

342
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,201
- Around us?
- You've seen them.

343
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:47,101
They come,

344
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:50,101
set eyes on us.
so we have to look at them.

345
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:52,801
Return their gaze.

346
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,301
Not smile, of course.

347
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,901
You don't smile, I hope.

348
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:10,901
What gentleness you have.

349
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:13,701
Why don't I have it?

350
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:17,001
Maybe I do, when I'm very tired.

351
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:22,501
When you want less,
it's easy to be gentle.

352
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:23,801
Isn't it?

353
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,601
Give me your hand.

354
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:40,101
How could he even look at me?

355
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,801
l았e always avoided people like him,

356
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:45,601
people with warm hands,

357
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,801
with voices that betray them,

358
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:50,301
and such emotions inside them.

359
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,801
People who act
as if things truly affected them.

360
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:57,301
Why did I notice him?

361
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:08,501
I was very happy,

362
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:10,001
once.

363
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:14,401
I was happy a second time.
so remembered the first.

364
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:17,101
I hadn앖 understood the first time.

365
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:23,501
Have you ever been happy, Yvonne?

366
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,201
Certainly, Madam.

367
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:27,001
Tell me about it.

368
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:29,601
Who gave you that happiness?

369
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,401
Were you already here?

370
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,201
Do I know him?

371
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:36,801
I don't know.

372
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,201
Happy?

373
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:43,301
Because of a man's love?

374
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,801
If that's it. Then I'm not sure.

375
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:50,701
mean,

376
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:53,701
if anyone has ever made me happy,

377
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:55,901
I couldn't say.

378
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:00,501
I figure l았e given more
than l았e received.

379
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:05,701
But I'm not calculating
who does what, either.

380
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:09,501
I wouldn앖 want to be like that.

381
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:17,401
So you think
we never know who does what?

382
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:22,501
Not bad, that haze, clever.

383
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:25,701
No one says thank you, no one says stop.

384
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:28,601
Not a word. That's good.

385
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:34,801
It's good to talk to you.

386
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:37,101
I should've done it sooner.

387
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:39,601
So close and so precious.

388
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:40,901
Excuse me,

389
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:43,401
I thought Madam
was really asking a question.

390
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:45,501
Maybe you're poking fun.

391
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,601
That압 it, l앐 poking fun.

392
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:54,201
You think just like Monsieur.
Maybe you read his mind.

393
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:58,201
Is that why you're so aloof
in his presence?

394
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:02,001
Is there too much to read?

395
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,001
Admit it.

396
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:18,601
The first time I was happy...

397
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,801
I hadn't taken the cabriolet.

398
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,801
Or else nothing would've happened.

399
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:31,801
But i had to walk so far.

400
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:41,401
So I ran into him.

401
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:53,401
Help me.

402
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:22,001
l앐 very hungry.

403
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,101
It's awful
to eat with someone who isn't.

404
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:31,501
Cou dn't he force himself?

405
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:34,801
Offer him some broth.

406
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:37,001
I'II have some with him.

407
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:40,001
Madam speaks odd y of what she did.

408
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:42,501
And what did Madam do?

409
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,701
Go on, Yvonne. Speak up.

410
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:52,501
Yvonne. A pretty name
for such a pretty soul.

411
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:58,501
But no one knows
what turn things will take.

412
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:06,101
Yvonne won't turn into a flower,
just a nasty little spy.

413
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:08,801
And Mrs. Hervey won't go all the way.

414
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:10,801
She'll stop short.

415
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:16,201
Did Mrs. Hervey
think of something today?

416
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,601
But then she turned back
on the boulevard.

417
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:25,001
Amazing how we rush back
from where we go.

418
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,401
What time did I leave?

419
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,201
At 3:30 p. M... Madam.

420
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,601
3:30, yes.

421
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:36,201
The right time.

422
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:39,001
And when did I come back?

423
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:40,601
At 7.

424
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:42,601
That's right.

425
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:46,701
It went fast.

426
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:53,101
Draw me a bath.
maybe it'll curb my appetite.

427
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:57,601
You ive in a house
where people love you.

428
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:00,401
Your life matters to us,
and you talk

429
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:02,001
as if you were gone.

430
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:09,801
Does Madam think
all this goes on without our noticing?

431
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:12,701
- We know what goes on.
- What goes on?

432
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:22,801
Monsieur is kind enough
to open his door to alk kinds.

433
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,101
He didn앖 see any reason to close it.

434
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:30,301
He'll close it now, of course.

435
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:34,401
Because one man
didn't respect the rules.

436
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,601
It's not Madam's fault.

437
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:40,201
This man played games. It's his nature.

438
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:53,701
I was walking back from church
the day I ran into him.

439
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,201
l앇 never really talked to him before.

440
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:01,401
Neither had he.

441
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:03,901
He was uncomfortable.

442
00:39:08,101 --> 00:39:10,201
I was glad to see him it at ease.

443
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:32,401
I began to suffer
when I realized nothing made him laugh.

444
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:38,801
Why did I notice at one point
that he never laughed?

445
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:41,401
And why not earlier?

446
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:51,101
That suffering
was when I began to love him.

447
00:39:53,401 --> 00:39:55,201
But I didn앖 know it yet.

448
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:00,701
l앐 so slow at everything.

449
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:06,301
I'm slow to feel pain.

450
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:10,901
I'm slow to feel happy.

451
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:23,001
Strange, it took me so long.

452
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,901
Seven months.

453
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:33,101
Two seasons.

454
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,801
And today a departure and a return.

455
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:40,601
Coming back I can do very quickly.

456
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:42,401
I ran.

457
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,001
I ran.

458
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:53,001
Think of the other time you were happy.

459
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:57,901
The other time. Good idea.

460
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,901
But that time's not for your ears.

461
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:15,401
Where is he?

462
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:18,501
- Who. Madam?
- I can't hear him now.

463
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:21,901
Go take a look.

464
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:24,701
Right away.

465
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:28,801
Leave me.

466
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:23,002
The surprise and distress
blinded me earlier,

467
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:24,602
when you came back.

468
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:31,402
I won't take back what I said.
Anyone would act that way.

469
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:35,202
But now it압 all over.

470
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:39,502
This morning, at this same table,

471
00:42:39,802 --> 00:42:43,002
we had breakfast together.
Now we're having dinner.

472
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,002
What happened between
must be forgotten.

473
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:50,102
Like things
that can only happen once.

474
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,902
Death, for instance.

475
00:43:00,402 --> 00:43:04,802
Nothing in my life
even vaguely resembles this.

476
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:06,502
Nothing.

477
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:11,802
It has its interest.

478
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:15,202
Are you listening?

479
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:17,602
Pull yourself together now.

480
00:43:17,902 --> 00:43:20,402
You've tried our nerves enough
for one day.

481
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:31,302
And there's this other man,

482
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,602
this man who's bound up with us now.

483
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:39,202
What is he doing? What is he thinking?

484
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,502
Who did he confide in?

485
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:44,802
And I won앖 even ask who it is.

486
00:43:46,302 --> 00:43:48,002
The quest on is simply this:

487
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:51,802
Do we count on the silence
of the man in question,

488
00:43:52,102 --> 00:43:54,602
or will he harm you
in your friends' eyes?

489
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:59,002
I believe this man,
if he is a man of the world,

490
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:01,202
will remain silent.

491
00:44:03,702 --> 00:44:07,202
But your girls,
who live off the crumbs of your life,

492
00:44:07,502 --> 00:44:09,802
will get ideas in their head.

493
00:44:10,502 --> 00:44:11,502
How did you hire them?

494
00:44:11,802 --> 00:44:14,002
Anyway, they'I gab to those boys

495
00:44:14,302 --> 00:44:16,202
who wait for them after their service.

496
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:19,402
How can we present this burning event?

497
00:44:22,902 --> 00:44:24,102
Have some wine.

498
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:26,902
I dislike that color in your cheeks.

499
00:44:53,102 --> 00:44:54,402
Do you remenber?

500
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:57,602
You were so sure of yourself
when you chose me.

501
00:44:58,602 --> 00:44:59,602
Weren't you?

502
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:05,002
You seemed to have thought it all out.
I was grateful,

503
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,902
I remember.

504
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:11,102
I figured nothing could happen to me.

505
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:14,502
Since you were sure. I was, too.

506
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,602
Then you left me on my own.

507
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:22,902
A most right after our wedding.

508
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:25,402
It took me time to realize it.

509
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:28,802
- You never came to me.
- And so?

510
00:45:29,002 --> 00:45:30,702
You betrayed me out of disappointment?

511
00:45:31,702 --> 00:45:33,902
A disapointment, indeed!

512
00:45:34,602 --> 00:45:36,802
And does this man know it?

513
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:38,502
Surely he must.

514
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,502
Everything turns out
better than expected.

515
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:43,902
The new Gabrielle is born,

516
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:47,302
and gives herse f to the first man
she meets. Honestly!

517
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:50,602
Wasn't the silent sufferer lovelier,

518
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:52,402
more awe-inspiring?

519
00:45:53,102 --> 00:45:55,002
Honestly. Look at yourself.

520
00:45:56,202 --> 00:45:57,602
It's not an improvement,

521
00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:59,202
is it?

522
00:46:01,702 --> 00:46:05,002
When I understood how you were,
why didn't I become like you?

523
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:08,802
I should have.

524
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:15,502
Why didn't you make me
really give everything up,

525
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:17,702
along with you?

526
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:20,102
Why did앑t you poison me, for real?

527
00:46:21,402 --> 00:46:23,802
Why didn't you killing me, for real?

528
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:25,902
Let's talk about t!

529
00:46:26,902 --> 00:46:30,402
Are we going to live together
like enemies now?

530
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:36,002
I can easily live here with you.

531
00:46:37,402 --> 00:46:40,302
You won't be my enemy or hurt me.

532
00:46:40,502 --> 00:46:42,502
I couldn앖 have come back otherwise.

533
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:46,602
I don't regret my life with you, Jean.

534
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:49,902
It led me to him.
Without you he doesn't exist.

535
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:52,302
My life with you pointed me to him.

536
00:46:57,102 --> 00:47:00,202
It occurred to me
he might be under your orders.

537
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,502
I even imagined you had chosen him.

538
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,002
It압 your editor.

539
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:23,502
I beg your pardon?

540
00:47:29,302 --> 00:47:31,102
l앐 hungry. Aren앖 you?

541
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:32,802
Yes,

542
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:34,302
no, a bit?

543
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:49,502
The first time I spoke to him,

544
00:47:50,402 --> 00:47:52,402
I felt the same as you did.

545
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:56,702
The same words came to mind.

546
00:47:58,902 --> 00:47:59,902
Two words you said.

547
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:01,202
Like what?

548
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:02,902
Olly?

549
00:48:03,602 --> 00:48:05,202
Olly and vengeful.

550
00:48:05,402 --> 00:48:08,502
Those were your words
the first time he came here.

551
00:48:09,002 --> 00:48:11,102
We both remember them clearly.

552
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,802
He압 had an unhappy life, I think.

553
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:24,302
And he does wipe his brow often,
even in private.

554
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:25,902
But sometimes he stops.

555
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:29,202
His hands don앖 shake
when they reach out to me.

556
00:48:30,402 --> 00:48:33,402
His mouth s hard and strong.
I want it to devour me.

557
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:43,402
I want to flow into him like blood.

558
00:48:51,302 --> 00:48:52,102
l앏l keep it.

559
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,202
Must we find something
to tell our friends?

560
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:02,902
Tomorrow is Thursday, remember.

561
00:49:05,202 --> 00:49:08,002
Shouldn't we come up with
an announcement?

562
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:12,602
To decide
what reaches the outside world.

563
00:49:14,002 --> 00:49:16,002
Yes, we should think of something.

564
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:21,802
That's something we can do together.

565
00:49:35,402 --> 00:49:38,202
My veins are barely visible.
Ever notice?

566
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:43,402
Very clear at the cuff, though,
then nothing.

567
00:49:45,002 --> 00:49:47,202
That must be why i'm so fond of yours.

568
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:53,202
The question, of course, is:

569
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:57,402
What appealed to him about you?

570
00:49:59,002 --> 00:50:00,902
No, let me guess.

571
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,902
Your hardness with people,

572
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,502
A hardness you don앖 really need?

573
00:50:08,402 --> 00:50:10,602
Who do you really need?

574
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:14,802
Who does Mrs. Hervey truly need?
No one.

575
00:50:15,602 --> 00:50:17,602
So you took time to notice him.

576
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:19,402
How excting to magine!

577
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:21,702
He, carrying on im my drawning room.

578
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:26,302
You. Back to him. In profile.
never really facing him.

579
00:50:27,302 --> 00:50:29,402
And all this for months, no doubt.

580
00:50:29,702 --> 00:50:32,402
The obstinacy of such people
is admirable!

581
00:50:33,002 --> 00:50:35,102
Can people like me really understand?

582
00:50:35,302 --> 00:50:37,702
Yes, but the effort of it!

583
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:42,002
And to go after you, my wife!
Rather than another...

584
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:45,502
I won't think him
as evil or merely stupid,

585
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:48,402
but it comes as a surprise.
Why you?

586
00:50:48,702 --> 00:50:50,302
Do you know?

587
00:50:51,102 --> 00:50:52,502
Won앖 you help me?

588
00:50:52,902 --> 00:50:54,502
I'll find out.

589
00:50:54,702 --> 00:50:58,402
Will you help, tell me if I'm close?
If I'm warm?

590
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:01,102
It makes no sense, Gabrielle!

591
00:51:01,402 --> 00:51:05,202
I want to believe you
when you say it's that damned editor,

592
00:51:05,502 --> 00:51:08,602
that fat, prissy fool,
and not someone else.

593
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,402
So it's really him?

594
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:15,402
Imagining that face
makes my head spin,

595
00:51:15,702 --> 00:51:18,102
his neck,
his teary eyes when he laughs...

596
00:51:18,802 --> 00:51:20,702
I want at least
to picture the right one.

597
00:51:25,302 --> 00:51:26,602
Al right?

598
00:51:34,702 --> 00:51:35,802
He's the one,

599
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:37,802
no one else.

600
00:51:40,302 --> 00:51:42,002
It was already ong ago.

601
00:51:44,002 --> 00:51:46,202
I'd run into him in town once.

602
00:51:46,502 --> 00:51:48,102
But this time it wasn앖 by chance.

603
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:52,202
I wanted him to hold me.

604
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,702
I asked him to.

605
00:51:55,902 --> 00:51:57,402
I had to persuade him.

606
00:51:58,802 --> 00:52:00,302
Then I wanted more.

607
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:09,902
Were making progress.

608
00:52:10,902 --> 00:52:12,002
And then?

609
00:52:14,702 --> 00:52:16,002
We undressed,

610
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:18,802
separately.

611
00:52:21,502 --> 00:52:24,502
His body was as I'd pictured it.
Isn't that odd?

612
00:52:28,602 --> 00:52:30,202
Heavy, rather thickset,

613
00:52:31,702 --> 00:52:33,602
very white, soft skin.

614
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:37,002
His veins show, too.

615
00:52:41,902 --> 00:52:43,202
His room is tiny.

616
00:52:44,702 --> 00:52:46,502
He cried the first time.

617
00:52:47,302 --> 00:52:50,202
Yes, the man's had an unhappy life.

618
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,802
He most likely

619
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:54,802
Iost his self-respect,

620
00:52:55,002 --> 00:52:56,802
his sense of situations.

621
00:52:58,402 --> 00:53:00,602
Unhappy affairs can do that.

622
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:03,702
Up to your ears in misery.

623
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:08,002
So like hungry children they grab.

624
00:53:08,302 --> 00:53:09,802
They hold out their hands

625
00:53:10,102 --> 00:53:13,702
out of habit
and eat without appetite.

626
00:53:15,602 --> 00:53:18,702
I wanted to experience love
once in my life.

627
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:20,702
Of course.

628
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:36,202
But you can't bear
to show yourself naked with me.

629
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:41,702
I don't understand.

630
00:53:44,102 --> 00:53:46,802
Why did you deny me for so long?

631
00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:53,602
The thought of your sperm
inside me is unbearable.

632
00:53:57,202 --> 00:53:58,602
But not his?

633
00:54:11,302 --> 00:54:14,602
THURSDAY

634
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:49,502
I'm amazed to see
how this powerful desire,

635
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:51,702
this absurd and sad desire,

636
00:55:52,002 --> 00:55:55,402
sheds an exciting new Illght
on all that concerns us.

637
00:55:58,302 --> 00:56:00,902
This passion forces us
to rethink everything.

638
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:03,802
And a new life might be fairly simple.

639
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:07,202
Your suffering will relieve me,

640
00:56:07,402 --> 00:56:09,802
and suffer you will.

641
00:56:10,002 --> 00:56:12,602
Every morning I'll make sure
you're in pain.

642
00:56:13,902 --> 00:56:15,802
It will eventually go away.

643
00:56:17,202 --> 00:56:20,202
l앏l see those dark clouds break up.

644
00:56:22,402 --> 00:56:24,002
And maybe l앏l let you know

645
00:56:24,302 --> 00:56:27,002
that your torment is ending.
Who knows?

646
00:56:27,602 --> 00:56:30,802
Imagine it:
Me, a bit surprised, saying,

647
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:34,102
"Gabrielle, you're back."

648
00:56:39,202 --> 00:56:41,602
I can see why my sadness intrigues you.

649
00:56:42,702 --> 00:56:44,302
l앐 not surprised.

650
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,602
But don't expect it to go away.

651
00:56:48,002 --> 00:56:50,702
If it does, however,
I won't let you see it.

652
00:56:51,802 --> 00:56:53,502
You'II see nothing but my pain.

653
00:56:54,602 --> 00:56:58,002
You'I only see this sad face,
if I so decide.

654
00:56:58,402 --> 00:56:59,202
And me?

655
00:56:59,402 --> 00:57:01,702
Can you read my heart on my face?

656
00:57:11,902 --> 00:57:12,802
The other way around!

657
00:57:13,102 --> 00:57:17,402
Let's look at it the other way around.
Your letter was ful of "I's".

658
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:18,702
But him in there!

659
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:20,802
You, I know now.

660
00:57:21,102 --> 00:57:23,502
Isn't it time to tell me about him?

661
00:57:24,602 --> 00:57:28,302
My wife압 mad about a tram conductor!

662
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,602
Who is this woman

663
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:39,202
under my roof, for whom a man...

664
00:57:40,402 --> 00:57:41,402
But in fact,

665
00:57:42,402 --> 00:57:44,602
he앏l tell me about you.

666
00:57:45,802 --> 00:57:46,402
Go on.

667
00:57:46,902 --> 00:57:48,102
Go talk to him.

668
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:50,802
You spoil my pleasure. I love music.

669
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,602
He앏l hear you out

670
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:56,002
and answer you.
I know he will.

671
00:58:09,902 --> 00:58:13,502
For once a recital
that resembles a real recital.

672
00:58:15,902 --> 00:58:17,602
So what have you seen lately
to loathe?

673
00:58:18,502 --> 00:58:20,402
Your loathings stimulate us.

674
00:58:20,702 --> 00:58:22,702
We're not saying
you're always wrong.

675
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:23,802
How good of you.

676
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,302
Nothing much.

677
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:29,702
A dreary affair about an inheritance,

678
00:58:30,502 --> 00:58:32,302
not worth getting angry about.
Sorry.

679
00:58:33,502 --> 00:58:36,202
But true lucidity, with all its dangers,

680
00:58:36,502 --> 00:58:38,202
is preferable to a life

681
00:58:38,702 --> 00:58:41,002
that keeps all its promises.

682
00:58:41,702 --> 00:58:43,602
Some promises are so vague.

683
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:49,002
Others we try to keep at all costs,
only to be hurt more.

684
00:58:49,702 --> 00:58:52,502
Some dishes should be turned down.

685
00:58:54,202 --> 00:58:58,102
Temperance is a virtue I honor
with an iron will.

686
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:00,502
You don앖 honor
"with an iron will"

687
00:59:01,502 --> 00:59:03,002
No, you act. I know.

688
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:06,302
You didn앖 just discover lucidity.

689
00:59:08,102 --> 00:59:10,002
But to me you았e always had it.

690
00:59:10,302 --> 00:59:11,402
Nearly.

691
00:59:11,902 --> 00:59:13,002
Yes, nearly.

692
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:15,702
So you hurt yourself, is that it?

693
00:59:16,502 --> 00:59:19,202
I won't let anyone else
have the honor.

694
00:59:19,502 --> 00:59:20,402
That압 more like it.

695
00:59:20,902 --> 00:59:22,402
Peace of mind guaranteed.

696
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:24,802
Everything a I right, Yvonne?

697
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:29,102
Me, too.

698
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:32,802
Here's something
for you to puzzle over

699
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,602
days on end.

700
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,402
The second time I was happy,

701
00:59:40,102 --> 00:59:41,202
very happy,

702
00:59:42,002 --> 00:59:43,802
is when I wrote my letter.

703
00:59:46,002 --> 00:59:47,602
You know there was a letter?

704
00:59:48,602 --> 00:59:49,802
That's when.

705
00:59:51,302 --> 00:59:53,702
Yesterday, or thereabouts.
Incredible.

706
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:01,102
Time doesn't matter, I've learned.

707
01:00:08,602 --> 01:00:09,602
It does it likes.

708
01:00:14,002 --> 01:00:15,002
Like all of us.

709
01:00:15,302 --> 01:00:16,402
Friends!

710
01:00:19,602 --> 01:00:21,602
Dear loyal friends...

711
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:25,202
Thank you for being here,

712
01:00:26,702 --> 01:00:29,102
for never missing an evening.

713
01:00:31,102 --> 01:00:32,702
We았e been together for years,

714
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:36,502
and we preserve

715
01:00:37,502 --> 01:00:38,702
one another

716
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,502
from the worst misfortunes.

717
01:00:43,302 --> 01:00:44,802
And, personally,

718
01:00:46,102 --> 01:00:48,502
I have never desired another life.

719
01:00:48,902 --> 01:00:50,402
I feel fine,

720
01:00:50,902 --> 01:00:52,202
I feel fine among you,

721
01:00:52,502 --> 01:00:54,102
and I just wanted to say so.

722
01:00:54,602 --> 01:00:56,002
I feel fine.

723
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:58,102
I wanted to certify it.

724
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:02,002
Madeleine can assure you
that I felt fine.

725
01:01:02,502 --> 01:01:03,802
I feel fine.

726
01:01:06,802 --> 01:01:08,202
That's my secret.

727
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,102
Oh, yes...

728
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:15,902
Gabrielle wanted...

729
01:01:17,202 --> 01:01:18,302
wants? ...

730
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:20,802
to make an announcement.

731
01:01:30,102 --> 01:01:32,102
Maybe she no longer wants to.

732
01:01:39,702 --> 01:01:42,102
No longer sure? No?

733
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:49,402
Yes, she's sure.

734
01:01:49,902 --> 01:01:52,202
The time was ripe earlier,

735
01:01:52,902 --> 01:01:54,802
and now it isn앖.

736
01:01:57,502 --> 01:01:59,402
And I won't address everyone

737
01:02:01,502 --> 01:02:03,802
when only two of you
are concerned.

738
01:02:06,402 --> 01:02:07,802
You'd be displeased with me.

739
01:02:09,502 --> 01:02:10,902
Jean. First of all.

740
01:02:14,602 --> 01:02:16,602
So we wait. S that it?

741
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,002
That's it.

742
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:37,802
Your niece had a winter wedding,
didn t she?

743
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:41,702
I never could understand why.

744
01:02:42,102 --> 01:02:43,602
It's not as nice.

745
01:02:43,902 --> 01:02:45,702
Everything압 so confined.

746
01:02:46,502 --> 01:02:49,902
The church, the reception halls,
the endless meals...

747
01:02:50,202 --> 01:02:52,202
May, June and July are better.

748
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,902
Especially June and July.

749
01:02:55,502 --> 01:02:56,802
I don't know.

750
01:02:57,002 --> 01:02:59,302
Cold wather
gives people rosy cheeks.

751
01:03:05,002 --> 01:03:06,002
Where are you going?

752
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:09,002
- I'm going.
- What? Where?

753
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:11,002
- To him?
- No, alone.

754
01:03:11,502 --> 01:03:12,302
Stay!

755
01:03:14,302 --> 01:03:15,402
It can't end ike this.

756
01:03:16,102 --> 01:03:17,202
Let me go!

757
01:03:20,302 --> 01:03:24,702
STAY!

758
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:56,602
I loved you.

759
01:03:57,102 --> 01:03:59,502
I love you, here and now.

760
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,402
You never loved me.

761
01:04:04,502 --> 01:04:06,502
You needed some woman,
any woman,

762
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,602
a wife, any wife.

763
01:04:12,902 --> 01:04:15,802
You married a woman I'm not,
that's all.

764
01:04:16,302 --> 01:04:17,902
Sometimes l앐 sorry.

765
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:20,602
What do you know of my thoughts?

766
01:04:21,802 --> 01:04:23,702
On returning, you seemed unhinged.

767
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,002
You listened so well.

768
01:04:27,302 --> 01:04:29,402
How you talk to me now!

769
01:04:30,702 --> 01:04:32,402
Had I believed you loved me,

770
01:04:35,002 --> 01:04:38,002
had I believed it for a moment,
l앇 have never come back.

771
01:04:44,602 --> 01:04:47,302
Had I thought
I mattered at all to you,

772
01:04:47,502 --> 01:04:49,002
l앇 have never returned.

773
01:04:50,502 --> 01:04:52,802
When you don't matter,
you can come and go,

774
01:04:53,202 --> 01:04:54,402
as if nothing had happened.

775
01:04:55,102 --> 01:04:57,002
Nothing. It압 so simple.

776
01:05:01,602 --> 01:05:03,102
We're alone, Jean.

777
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:06,402
Don't you see?

778
01:05:09,102 --> 01:05:11,202
Youre just trying to reassure yourself.

779
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:14,802
Stop it.

780
01:05:30,402 --> 01:05:33,802
I knew that
what we experienced together saved us.

781
01:05:42,602 --> 01:05:45,902
I knew we had the assurance
of a life without scandal

782
01:05:46,302 --> 01:05:47,602
and without crises.

783
01:05:52,102 --> 01:05:53,402
I knew it.

784
01:05:56,802 --> 01:05:58,802
That we'd sleep the same sleep.

785
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:02,902
I wanted it just as you did.

786
01:06:05,402 --> 01:06:08,202
No one knows
how well matched we were.

787
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:13,702
Much more than many others.

788
01:06:17,002 --> 01:06:18,202
Yes, we were.

789
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,002
Then why did you come back?

790
01:06:26,902 --> 01:06:28,402
I came back because...

791
01:06:31,702 --> 01:06:34,302
that other life, with that man,

792
01:06:35,702 --> 01:06:37,102
who is so kind,

793
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:39,602
attracts me...

794
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,202
That other life is too demanding.

795
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:53,502
My arms and legs aren앖 enough
to absorb it all.

796
01:06:55,402 --> 01:06:57,202
My body isn't big enough.

797
01:06:58,702 --> 01:07:00,002
What style!

798
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:03,802
Where did you get that from,
for God's sake?

799
01:07:07,102 --> 01:07:09,502
I must say it has a nice ring.

800
01:07:09,702 --> 01:07:10,902
At least,

801
01:07:11,302 --> 01:07:13,002
he didn앖 taint you.

802
01:07:18,602 --> 01:07:20,602
Poor helpless little thing.

803
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,602
But what you ve said
has nothing to do with love!

804
01:07:30,802 --> 01:07:34,102
Love's not this torment
that's made you act so oddly.

805
01:07:34,402 --> 01:07:36,202
You won't drag me down with you!

806
01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:40,802
I can still tell true fee ings
from utter confus on!

807
01:07:44,402 --> 01:07:45,902
I'm going to bed.

808
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:57,602
Good n ght, Jean.

809
01:08:11,302 --> 01:08:12,902
I have something to do.

810
01:08:32,802 --> 01:08:35,202
Did you fell any pleasure with him?

811
01:08:37,602 --> 01:08:39,402
More pleasure than with me?

812
01:08:42,302 --> 01:08:43,402
Of course I did.

813
01:08:48,702 --> 01:08:51,402
You never felt any pleasure with me?

814
01:08:56,902 --> 01:09:00,102
It wasn앖 that important to us, was it?

815
01:09:12,302 --> 01:09:13,902
Ten years of life together,

816
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:17,002
here. In my house...

817
01:09:17,902 --> 01:09:19,202
In this house.

818
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:22,602
So many memories come to mind...

819
01:09:24,502 --> 01:09:25,602
The way you walk,

820
01:09:26,202 --> 01:09:28,702
the way you say my name,

821
01:09:28,902 --> 01:09:31,802
your heaving breast...

822
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:33,702
Ten years

823
01:09:34,102 --> 01:09:36,102
should have appeased my desire.

824
01:09:36,902 --> 01:09:37,802
A long time ago,

825
01:09:38,302 --> 01:09:39,602
of course I... I mean we...

826
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:42,502
But that was the first five months.

827
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:44,602
Then habit sets in.

828
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:46,202
Habit of the person,
gestures, voice.

829
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:47,802
- The silence...
- Jean, please no!

830
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:49,902
- My wife's si ence...
- Stop it!

831
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,902
Is was all mine!

832
01:09:52,102 --> 01:09:54,402
It was all intimately mine!

833
01:14:25,902 --> 01:14:27,402
It's Yvonne.

834
01:14:48,102 --> 01:14:49,802
Leave it, Yvonne.

835
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:58,202
THE NEXT MORNING

836
01:16:51,502 --> 01:16:53,402
YOU MUST HELP ME.

837
01:16:53,702 --> 01:16:55,902
YOU ALWAYS HAVE...

838
01:17:04,002 --> 01:17:05,402
You'll help me.

839
01:17:06,802 --> 01:17:08,002
I need it.

840
01:17:09,702 --> 01:17:11,202
You left me,

841
01:17:12,402 --> 01:17:13,902
then you came back.

842
01:17:15,902 --> 01:17:17,402
I don't understand.

843
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:20,702
But I will.

844
01:17:24,902 --> 01:17:26,802
I make myself sick.

845
01:17:29,002 --> 01:17:30,202
Get out.

846
01:17:42,102 --> 01:17:43,602
Emotion s...

847
01:17:44,502 --> 01:17:45,702
revolting.

848
01:17:50,702 --> 01:17:52,202
You loved me, didn앖 you?

849
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,502
I mean...

850
01:17:56,302 --> 01:17:58,002
a little? Tell me.

851
01:18:01,202 --> 01:18:03,202
A long time ago, yes. I said so.

852
01:18:09,402 --> 01:18:11,102
But that's all passed.

853
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:17,502
I don앖 resent you
for no longer loving you.

854
01:18:21,002 --> 01:18:23,002
Once, yes that압 gone.

855
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:29,302
I don't resent you now.

856
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:09,002
Come.

857
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:24,002
Come.

858
01:19:26,302 --> 01:19:27,302
Lie down.

859
01:19:30,302 --> 01:19:33,102
If you come to me, now...

860
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:36,202
Maybe...

861
01:19:36,702 --> 01:19:38,002
I could...

862
01:19:39,902 --> 01:19:41,002
Now.

863
01:19:43,002 --> 01:19:44,002
Come.

864
01:22:16,702 --> 01:22:18,302
There's no love, is that it?

865
01:22:18,702 --> 01:22:20,202
There won't be any love.

866
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:22,402
ever?

867
01:22:25,902 --> 01:22:27,702
And you can live with that?

868
01:22:33,102 --> 01:22:34,202
Well, I can't!

869
01:22:53,102 --> 01:23:01,602
HE NEVER RETURNED.
