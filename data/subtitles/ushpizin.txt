Ushpizin
Lulavs, citrons, myrtles!
How much for this?
This citron is worth|at least 300 Shekels.
So bring another inspector!|Some would say even 500.
You want the truth?|100 Shekels, thaùs all.
OK, Wasserman.
Next.
Look at this one.
What do you say?
Marvelous! Really marvelous!
How much do you|think iùs worth?
Iùs been years since|I've seen one so beautiful.
I told you, no one else|has citrons like this.
Excuse me.|- Yes, rabbi, how can I help?
May I look at the citrons?|- Look over there,
there are some for 30,|40, 50. Very nice ones.
So, what do you say,|at least 500 Shekels, no?
More.|- How much, then?
This citron can get you... at|least...
800, even a 1000.|- A thousand?!
Who'd give a thousand|for a citron?
They'll give, they'll give.
May I have a look|at this one?
Iùs not for you, rabbi;|its expensive.
Can I look?
Easy... Easy.
May I?
How much did you say?
A thousand Shekels.
This really is|a beautiful citron.
You're not buying?|- With GoÔs help.
Next...
Hello, Moshe. - Hello, Ben Baruch.|- How are things?
Could be better.
Whaùs with the long face?|Yom Kippur's over!
Did you build a Succah?|- How? I'm dead broke.
Citron, lulav? 4 species?|- Nothing, don't you get it.
Wake up!|The Holiday is tomorrow!
Any way you can help me,|Ben Baruch?
No, really not.|- Come on, Ben Baruch
I spent it all on wood.
If I hear of something,|I'll tell you.
Moshe...
Give us a smile.
What can I tell you, Father.|The situation stinks.
Merciful Father, make him go away.|I can't take it anymore.
Make him go away, please...|Make him go away...
Thank you, Father.|Thank you very much.
I told you, I'm not built for|working in the sun.
I suffer from migraines.
So work the city;|go to houses, restaurants;
"When the evil urge|provokes one to anger,
"at that moment, good|wants to descend from above.
"The evil urge|wants to ruin that.
"Thus, one should always|guard himself against anger.
"Not to ruin the good that|Heaven wants to bestow."
Oh man. You have to keep|your eyes wide open.
We're all being|constantly tested.
Iùs not allowed.|- What?
This.|- Who told you that?
They announced|you can't smoke in here.
And what does a smoker do?|- He goes to the balcony.
How's it going, Moshe?|- Terrible! His name be praised.
I couldn't do anything. I tried.|- I'm sure you did.
What do they give, Moshe?|Pennies, nothing.
Nothing for you, maybe.|For me, iùs everything.
I promised my wife I'd bring|home some money today.
I can't face her.
900 shekels would at least|get me through the holiday.
What can we do? We'll pass|this, too. Thaùs His will.
I can't go back there.|- You don't have a choice.
Why are you standing there?|We'll be late.
I can't, Yossef.
The smell...
The smell is killing me.
Whaùs Lysol made from?|- I know? From Lysol.
Thaùs why I hate|going on leave.
I hate going back.
What are you doing? - I'm going.|- Going where? - Home!
They'll catch you in no time.
Not home, then! To hell!|Just not there.
Wait up!
Wait up!
This is perfect for you.|- How much is it?
Only 40 Shekels.|- 40 Shekels?
Iùs handmade.|I sell them for 60.
40 is a special price,|for neighbors.
What is it?
Mali, iùs me, open up.
OK. I'll be off now.|- Well, do you want it?
Iùs a bit expensive.|- Make it 30, then.
I'll consult my husband.|See you. Thanks.
So long, Mrs. Neiman.
She buy anything?|- Don't count on it.
Rothman was here.|- What did he want?
He wanted his rent!
Could you give him something?|I can't take it any more.
Where will I get|the money from?
Have you been to the Yeshiva?|- Yes.
And?|- What?
What do you mean, what?
Souisa's wife told me|they got the money!
We have nothing, honey.|- What?
The supervisors had a meeting.
They decided not to give me|anything this month.
Who decided? Why?|- I wasn't there enough.
And what did you say?|- What could I say...
You said nothing?|- What could I tell them?
Sure you said nothing!
You played the saint,|accepting it all with love!
You want me to start arguing?|That was their decision.
Whose decision?|- Thaùs what God wanted.
Stop! Give me a break!
Maybe God wanted you|to stand up for yourself?!
You know why they|didn't give you the money?
They knew that|you'd let it pass.
Leùs see them not give|Souisa the money!
He'd burn down the Yeshiva!|- Enough!
I don't understand|what you want.
What do you want me to do?|Start hitting people?!
We became religious,|we don't behave that way.
God will help!|Do we have faith or not?!
Be quiet there!|- OK, Weisglass, we heard you.
You're not alone here!|- You're right.
Blessed are You, Lord our|God, King of the universe,
Who sanctified us with His|commandments
and commanded us regarding the|washing of hands. - Amen.
Don't be upset, sweetheart.|I promise you, God willing,
we'll live to see a table|laden with delicacies... - Amen.
And a baby boy.
Stop it...
What do we do about a Succah?
God will not forsake us.|We'll have a Succah.
Tomorrow's Succoth eve.
I heard a nice saying|today by Rabbi Nathan...
how did it go..."Wherever|something is lacking,
"I know that either|it wasn't prayed for,
"or that it wasn't|prayed for enough."
Nice, isn't it?|- Nice.
Then, why don't you go pray?|- What, now?
When else? Tomorrow is|Succoth eve.
I wanted to get some sleep.|- Enough with this sleeping.
I'm beat, I'm telling you.|I stayed up all night.
So why are you bringing in|Rabbi Nathan?
Empty words!
Tomorrow is Succoth eve,|don't you get it? Go pray.
Go on.
We need a miracle.
We will see miracles, Moshe.
Truth be told, God Almighty,|I'm down in the dumps.
OK, I know you hate sadness,|but I'm sad as can be.
I'm all sadness.
A lump of sadness.
Not that I think you owe me|anything, God Almighty,
but I don't understand.|I really don't understand.
Sometimes I don't know what|you want from me.
Sometimes I think that|you're a bit rough on me,
a bit on my case.
"I shall cry,
and He will pay|heed..."
To be a good Jew, thaùs all.|Don't want anything more.
I want to have a Succah,|a lulav, 4 species,
food for the Holiday.|Not too much for you, is it?
If not for my sake,|then for my wife's.
Honestly, what has|Malka Bat Mazal
done to offend you?
Poor woman, she loves|and respects you so much.
What does she have?|What do I bring her? Nothing.
The Torah?|I don't give her anything.
Do I make a living?|Did I give her a child?
Six, seven, eight...
Hi Zwible.
Did you deliver everything?|- Almost.
I still have 1000 dollars.|- How come?
The old man from Musrara|passed away.
I heard! I forgot to tell you.
May he rest in peace.
So here's 1000 dollars.|What do I do with it?
You'll find someone|to give it to.
Zwible, I want to wrap it up;|I have to go out of town.
There you go; I'm sure|you'll find someone here.
I don't know...
Pick a number.
What do you mean?|- Come on, pick a number.
Do I know... 35.|- Start counting.
God Almighty...|We need a miracle.
A miracle, God Almighty,|a miracle
Please, a miracle,|Lord of the universe...
Please, a miracle...
Our holy Rabbi Nahman|from Breslau, God Almighty,
in his virtue, hear our|prayer, give us a miracle...
A miracle...
"He leads me beside|the still waters..."
A miracle, God Almighty,|a miracle, a miracle...
"I shall fear no evil|for you are with me..."
Moshe Belanga... you know him?
Yes...
From around Shmuel Hanavi?|- Yes, I think I know him!
A Breslau Hassid... Oh, well.|I'll go there now.
May you be rewarded.|- Stay well.
Where were you?!|- Whaùs the matter?
I've been looking|for you all day long!
I've been praying.|- You prayed well, my friend.
What is it?|- I found a Succah for you.
Get out...|- Iùs out of this world!
You won't believe it, thaùs|what I prayed for. Where is it?
Remember where the old|Yeshiva office used to be?
Hold it. Whose is it?|- Nobody's. - How come?
It belonged to Gabay.|But he isn't using it.
Are you sure?|- I'm sure!
Iùs a Succah like you|wouldn't believe, come on!
But how will we move it,|with movers? I'm broke.
God sent you a Succah,|he'll send a truck!
May you have an accident.
Nothing beats freedom.|- Jerusalem.
How did we end up here?|- C'mon, iùs the Holy City.
Holy city?|Iùs a pile of stones.
Don't turn around,|a pig just walked in.
Maybe they're|already looking for us.
Relax, who cares about you.|You think you're Al Capone?
He's sitting down.
Breathe, enjoy the freedom.
And then what? You know|anybody in Jerusalem?
I had an aunt up here...
But she's dead.|- So why did we come here?!
Good evening.|Are you into spirituality?
Sorry, bro, I'm broke.
Thaùs OK. Iùs the|thought that counts.
Come here a second.|- Yes?
Let me see the box.|- There you go.
"The Hidden Light."|- The Hidden Light.
Are you from this Yeshiva?|- I am, praise God.
Breslau, right?|- Yes, Breslau.
Know a guy named Moshe?|- Which Moshe?
There are lots of them.
Moshe Belanga, from Eilat,|tall guy, know him?
Yeah, sure, he studies there.
Where's "there," man?|- Shmuel Hanavi Street.
If I go there now, I'll meet him?|- No, bro, iùs already late,
but you could probably find|him there tomorrow morning.
Bless you, brother.
Who is this Moshe guy?
Moshe Belanga.
A friend.|- Close friend?
If we find him,|we've got it made.
Many roads I've taken
Searchin' for some truth
And I never hesitated
Doin' things I shouldn't do
We didn't find ourselves
Don't want to be a liar
This culture isn't for us
Our hearts are full of fire
And I am so small
Most wretched of them all...
You got a splinter?
I'm going for a second.|- Where to?
To make my wife happy.|She was worried about the Succah.
Go, go...
I stand here,|in wonder and awe.
For you are holy,|and your name is holy,
Saints praise your name|by day and by night...
For you are holy,|and your name is holy,
Saints praise your name|by day and by night...
Moshe, you saint,|God loves you so much!
Are you OK? Everything's OK?|- Better than OK.
Remember what I told you|before you left?
Whaùs this?|- Open it.
Whaùs this? Whose is it?
Someone slipped it|under the door.
Who's 'someone'?|- Don't know, didn't look, read!
"Rabbi Moshe Belanga,|Happy Holiday,
"Accept this gift,|which need not be repaid..."
How much is there?|- A thousand dollars.
Are you sure?
I've counted it 30 times.|An even thousand.
Do you understand what|has happened here, my wife?
See the power of prayer?
Iùs a miracle,|a real miracle.
Blessed be the Lord|who listens to prayers.
A miracle. - Blessed be the Lord|who listens to prayers.
I don't believe it. A miracle!
Iùs a miracle.|- A miracle!
A downright miracle!
1000 dollars,|His name be praised!
God Almighty, you're for real!
You did it big time!|- Father, thank you.
It is a miracle.|I can't believe it!
Father, thank you,|thank you very much!
It was a miracle.|A miracle, God Almighty!
This should be enough, right?|- Big time.
Look, I have it|all mapped out:
We'll pay back what we owe,|and with whaùs left,
Leùs make a big, beautiful|Succah for the Lord.
Moshe, whaùs wrong?|- Wait a second.
Have a look at something.|See that? Iùs ours.
Ours? From where?
Sing for Him, chant for Him,|talk of all His wonders...
Like that?|- Only like that!
Sing for Him, chant for Him,|talk of all His wonders...
Moshe!
A tenth for charity.
Ben Baruch! Ben Baruch!
Whaùs wrong?
Whaùs with you, Moshe?|Have you lost it?
Ben Baruch, how righteous|the Lord is, how merciful!
How righteous! Take!
Take it!
Iùs a lot of money, Moshe.
The lord has sent it to you!|Take it!
Why did we stop dancing?|- Beats me!
Sing for Him, chant for Him,|talk of all His wonders...
They just took it?|- They came with a pickup truck.
And you didn't tell them it|was mine?
I did, and they said it was OK.|- Nobody told me anything.
Do you know them?|- It was that Breslau guy,
that goes around in the|morning with the charity box.
Ben Baruch...|- Yes, Ben Baruch.
Some people...
Wow, iùs huge.
Thaùs good. Maybe God|will send you guests.
Does it fit?
Too bad, we lost|the door knob.
Enough?|- No, bring more.
When will you pay?
You worried, Elazar? Lùll be OK.|Bring some more.
May I help you?|- We're looking for Moshe Belanga.
Is he here?|- Not right now.
Thaùs his sister's kid.|Could you help us find him?
Sure, with pleasure.|- Thanks, man.
Is it sold?|- I beg your pardon?
That nice citron, is it sold?|- We have lots of nice ones.
No, I mean the nicest one.|It went for 1000 Shekels.
He means 'the diamonÔ.|- Yes, that 'diamonÔ. Sold?
Iùs right here.
Leùs have it.
There's a thousand.
How sweet is the Lord.
Happy Holiday.
Where have you been?|Iùs almost Succoth!
Shopping... Nick of time.
This is for you.
For me?
Iùs perfect. You shouldn't have.|- Put them on...
Have a look at something.
Iùs lovely.
'Lovely'? Just 'lovely'?
Iùs The Diamond.
The Diamond?|- Thaùs what they call it.
The most beautiful citron|in Jerusalem.
Let me see a second.
How much did it cost you?
You want the truth?|- Only the truth.
One hundred?
You're out of your mind.|- I had to.
Moshe, you're out of your mind!|- I had to.
Moshe, you're crazy.|- I had to!
But 1000 Shekels for a citron?
Honey, don't get angry.
Iùs a 'blessing'|for having boys.
Says who?|- Iùs written in the books.
A beautiful citron is|a blessing for having boys.
I better go before they close|the mikveh (ritual baths).
The earrings look good on you.|- Thanks.
What am I without you?
Nothing. A half-person.|- OK, OK, Moshe.
Happy Holiday.|- Happy Holiday, Moshe.
Why is the door open...
Moshe!
I can't believe it!|Iùs Moshe!
Eliyahu, iùs really you!
What are you doing here?
Visiting. I've missed you.|Is that illegal?
God forbid.
You don't seem too happy.
No, I just thought|you were still doing time.
Thaùs it? They released you?
Praise God. 'I've paid|my debt to society.'
Praise God.
What a surprise. Who's this?|- Yossef. A close friend.
Welcome.|- Pleased to meet you.
Eliyahu Scorpio. I don't|believe it.
How long has it been? Years...
We're in Jerusalem on business,
so I said to Yossef|I have to see you.
Wait... how did you find|out where I lived?
They told us in your Yeshiva.
Is this a bad time?
Just a minute,|let me get this straight.
Where are you spending|the Holiday? In Jerusalem?
We don't know yet.|Maybe in Tel Aviv.
Whaùs in Tel Aviv?|Succoth in Jerusalem.
Is anything better than that?|- The Holy City, after all...
Be my guests.
What, and just crash|your Holiday?
Crash my Holiday? If you|only knew how I prayed
that the Lord would send me|guests to the Succah.
And such guests he sent!
Praise God. Set the table|for four. We have guests.
Guests? Who?|- Friends.
From the Yeshiva?|- No. From the old days.
Actually, iùs one friend|and his friend.
Where are the yarmulkes?|I put them here.
Which friends from|'the old days'? - Mali, iùs OK.
Where did I put the yarmulkes?
The mikveh is about to close.|- From way back?
Mali, Iùs OK.|They're OK people.
Thanks.
You don't look happy.|- Sure I am.
I didn't prepare|for guests.
What can I do?|Do we run the world?
God sent guests to our Succah.|Should we send them away?
They'll wash hands|and bless the food.
They'll sit in a Succah, maybe|for the first time ever!
Does it get any better than that?
You tell me, does it?
You're all glowing.|- Like a torch.
I feel that we are about to|receive abundance from Heaven.
God willing.
Happy Holiday.|- Happy Holiday, sweetheart.
Say, Moshe, whaùs with the hat?|- The shtreimel?
You wear it on Shabbat,|or Holidays.
Whaùs it made of? Cat fur?
No. Fox tails.|- Get out of here!
Where do they|get that many foxes?
From abroad.
What, no foxes in Israel?|- Where do we have foxes?
We do. In the desert.|- How many? Seven?
They bring it from abroad.|Thaùs why iùs so expensive.
How expensive?|How much for one?
There are all sorts.|- How much is yours?
Mine is nothing special.|Iùs old. Second hand.
Looks like a flat tire.
Eliyahu, don't dare talk|that way about my shtreimel.
How much is that one?|- Could run up to 2000 dollars.
2000 dollars?|I don't believe it.
Did you hear that,|Eliyahu?! 2000 dollars!
What did you think?|Until you catch the fox,
relax him, skin him...|Ioads of work.
And if I bring you 10 pieces,|can you fence them?
Yossef has a criminal mind.|Iùs in his blood.
You go by on a motorcycle,|you can snatch a dozen.
Moshe knows people;|he could fence them easy!
This street alone is worth,|roughly, 200,000 dollars.
Thaùs not peanuts.
Snap out of it, Yossef.
Don't talk like that|around my wife.
Just kidding.|- Don't.
She's not into that.|No jail, no holdups, nothing.
Moshe, don't worry, we'll|pretend we met in college.
No 'I did time,' no 'we did time,|'None of that talk.
Trust me, Moshe.
Happy Holiday!|- Happy Holiday!
Eliyahu, Yossef.|Our Ushpizin.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Mali.|- Pleased to meet you.
Come Yossef, sit here.|Come in, Eliyahu.
Make yourselves at home.
So?|- Far out.
King of the universe,
King of the universe,
Who creates the fruit|of the vine. - Amen.
Blessed are You, Lord our|God, King of the universe,
Who chose us amongst nations,|Who gave us a holy tongue,
Who sanctified us|with His commandments...
And lovingly set forth,
joyous holy days...
such as this Succoth|holiday...
A time to rejoice and remember|the Exodus from Egypt.
Have some more.|- Gladly.
Oh, the fish. Heavenly.|- To your health.
You made it, Moshe?|- Heaven forbid. It was her.
Bless those hands.|- Thanks.
I like this 'kiddush' thing.|- Give me your glass.
Watch it with him, Moshe.
Whaùs with the looks?|Iùs just wine!
Why has the Lord commanded|us to stay in the Succah?
Not only stay there,|but everything:
Eat, drink, sleep,|all in the Succah.
Why is that?|God wanted us to feel
that just as the Succah|is a temporary dwelling,
so is this world,|temporary, passing,
where we're merely guests.
Now, he also explains...
Man, you're heavy, Moshe.
Well, OK. I'm done.
Go on, Moshe. I want to hear.
No, iùs OK. I'm done.|- Why? Iùs interesting.
Say, iùs all there, in the book?|- Iùs all there.
Let me have a look.
Watch it, Yossef, you'll|end up finding God.
Why not?
The yarmulke suits him, no?
Why not, really?
Iùs not a bad life.|This temporary stuff's cool.
You do your permanent stuff,|then we can talk temporary.
I'm hungry. I had 3 helpings,|and I'm still hungry.
There's plenty more.
I'll clear the dishes.
I'll get this...
How long you been married,|Moshe?
Almost 5 years.
Hey, we haven't met in ages.
Ages!
What about kids, Moshe?
None.|- How come?
With GoÔs help.|I don't pray enough for it.
With GoÔs help.|- But you have to!
Iùs a commandment, right?|- Sure it is: 'Pru U'rvu'.
Be fruitful and multiply...
'Children are such joy... '|- Will you quit it, Yossef?
Eat. Give him some bread.
Don't know whaùs wrong with me.|I can't stop eating.
Don't fill up on salad.|The meaùs on its way.
You know what,|maybe she needs help.
Wait, I'll be right back.
Nice guy, huh?
Don't be fooled. I don't|buy this saint routine.
I know Moshe Belanga.|- People change.
When did you last see him?|- Doesn't matter. I raised him.
We were close like this.
If he only thought you said|the wrong word, he'd attack.
And I don't mean just attack,|I mean ATTACK!
So now he's Moses?
Whaùs the matter?|- Leave me alone.
Whaùs with the face?|- What face?
This one.
The meaùs getting cold.|Leùs take it to the Succah.
So they aren't exactly|the Holy Ushpizin, so what?
So what?
Are we any better?
Iùs not just that.
What is it, then?
We will have a child.|- I'm not so sure anymore.
We will have a child.|- You have to go, Moshe.
I don't want to go.|I want a child with you.
Like that?|- Only like that.
Now leùs get to the Succah,|before Eliyahu eats the table.
Did you see how|they attacked the fish?
I wish them good health.
Tell me, who are they?
Eliyahu is from Eilat.|Yossef, I don't know him.
And you didn't know|they were coming?
So how come they|showed up like that?
Aren't you drinking,|Moshe?
Nothing left.|You finished it off.
Where's the strong stuff?
You want some strong stuff?|- Do you have any?
What do you think?|I'd go without?
Enough.|- You've hardly had any.
I've had enough.|- I can't believe it, Yossef.
If you only knew|who this man is.
He could toss back two|bottles without twitching.
What happened?|Does the Torah forbid it?
No, a little bit is fine,|a lot is forbidden.
Last one.
Good night.|- Good night.
Good night, Mali.
How will I make it|to synagogue tomorrow?
Every day, Moshe? No skipping?
Skipping? Why skipping?|Tell me, Eliyahu, seriously,
do you know what light will|descend upon us tomorrow?
Rabbi Nahman from Breslau|says that
the light descending is beyond|spirit, soul: Endless light!
A light that can never|be conceived. By the mind.
Except for one thing.
You know how one can conceive it?|Only through faith. Only...
You know what|I'm remembering now?
Now, as we're sitting here,|drinking...
That time, in the restaurant,|'The Fisherman's Boaù?
There were lots of times.|- No!
The time with the Americans,|remember?
Eliyahu, leùs not reminisce,|OK?
You hearing this, Yossef?
Just to give you an idea of|who this man is,
we're sitting, drinking,|having fun, when suddenly,
three Americans walk in,
big guys, huge, totally drunk.
We see they're making|fun of us. Provoking us.
I see Moshe starting|to heat up,
and when he heats up,|there's nothing you can do.
One of them steps up.
Before he knows what hit him,
Moshe...
You remember, Moshe?|Blood gushing...
Eliyahu, what are you doing?
I'm telling Yossef who you are.|- OK, but no need to break bottles.
Drop what you're holding.|- Whaùs wrong?
Drop what your holding!
You fight?
Hard to believe.|- This is nothing!
And this whole act.
And this whole act.
Moshe Belanga...
The entire City of Eilat|was afraid of him.
When he gets angry,|God have mercy.
God have mercy, indeed.
I hope I'll manage to repent|for all I've done in this world.
Come on! Get off it!
Beating people up;|- Drink!
Iùs disgusting.
Don't bring me down.|We were having a good time.
A hammer, a nail,|we'll quickly take...
A Succah, we'll build...
Happy Holiday, Moyshe.|- What can I say, Rabbi.
I didn't wake up.|- Better late than never!
Whaùs happening, Moyshe?
I'm a mess, Rabbi.|- Haven't seen you in a while.
I had problems...|- How are things at home?
Fine, thank God. The Lord|has been very generous.
No complaints.|We've seen miracles.
Nice.
How's your wife?|- My wife's fine.
Happy?|- Sort of happy.
You should make her happy.|Always remember that.
Your wife comes first.|She's the most important.
Iùs your way of worshipping.|Iùs your Holiday.
Rabbi, thaùs the problem.|You see, we have guests.
Guests for the Holiday?|Whaùs the problem?
Iùs good. Succoth is|a holiday of guests:
The Holy Ushpizin!|- Rabbi, my guests are not so holy.
Iùs a friend from|the old days, and his friend.
They're not into the Torah|and commandments.
All the better!|Thaùs the point.
Don't forget where you were|until not long ago.
I'm not forgetting.|I never forget that.
Good. The holiday will pass,|the guests will leave,
you'll have the intermediate|days, sit with her, talk,
make her happy,|thaùs what matters.
Go pray now.
Wait up, Gabay. Wait up!
Why are you angry at me?|- Drop it, iùs a holiday.
I don't want to get upset.|- I was sure you abandoned it.
Did you hear me say that?|- I saw you buy a new one.
So what if I did?!
Did I say I abandoned|the old one?
We have laws, man!
You know what you've done?
You've ruined|my holiday, Ben Baruch!
It wasn't even for me.|I wanted to help a friend.
He had nothing.|Talk about evil urge!
I wanted to help one Jew, and|ended up wronging another.
Forgive me, brother.|- OK. Whaùs done is done.
Happy Holiday.
No way.
What?
You can't just walk away.|Give me a hug.
Enough, Ben Baruch.|Whaùs done is done.
Give me a hug!
Who can resist you?! Ben Ba...
Nice here, no?|- Sure is.
Told you we'd manage.|- They must be looking for us.
Don't worry.|They won't get here so fast.
What would the cops look for|here, with the 'penguins'?
Suits me fine.|I'd stay right here.
I'm not sure it suits your friend.|- Who cares about him?
He wants to be a saint, right?|Let him exercise hospitality.
His wife's the problem.
She's a jinx.|- Some couple. Bert and Ernie.
Bert and Ernie! Good one!
I'm hungry.
Pass the salt.|- You have it. Leave some!
We ran out.
Is this piece available?|- That one's mine!
You've eaten enough.|- Look who's talking.
Blessed are You, Lord our|God, King of the universe,
Who distinguishes the|sacred from the secular,
light from darkness,|Israel from the nations,
the seventh day of rest|from the six days of labor.
Blessed is the Lord,
Who separates the sacred|from the secular.
Now, a cigarette.
I'm going away.|- Whaùs that again?
To my in-laws in Gedera.|What a drag.
Oh.
When?|- Now, in a bit.
Can't really blow it off.|We promised to come.
I didn't know we'd|have guests.
OK. So...
We'll also be off.|- Why so soon?
Leùs have some coffee|for the road.
Coffee, Eliyahu?
No need.|- Right, no need.
Leùs roll.
See you, my brothers.
I feel awful.|- What about?
About the way I treated the guests.|I don't know what came over me.
You treated them just fine.|They weren't too nice themselves.
Thaùs just it. Iùs clear|as day that it was a test.
Some test it woulÔve been|if they were nice guests.
They couldn't wait to leave,|huh?
No, they wanted to stay.|- You sent them away?
I told them we were going to|see your parents. In Gedera.
You lied.
I lied.
Shall we bake them?
A blessing for having sons.
What do we do now?
Don't know.
I don't like to plan.|Be spontaneous, Yossef.
Your friend pulled|a fast one on us.
Did you fall for that|Gedera line of his?
You think he lied?|- I'm sure!
Wanna bet?
To life.
To life.
Why aren't you drinking?|- Don't feel like it.
Oh, come on!
Pure evil urge.|What a disgrace.
We blew it, Moshe.|We blew it big time.
So we blew it.
Don't worry. The Lord|will send us other guests.
Look at Abraham and Sarah.|They had a rough time, too.
Think about it. Moshe.|They didn't have children.
Year in year out,|decade in, decade out...
What a rat...|- Told you so!
Eating fish. I'd love|to see them choke on it.
The worst people would|come to them. Heretics.
And they waited on them,|served them,
taught them that there is|a Master of this world.
Finally, they were granted a son.|- Eat, sweetheart, eat.
Who could it be this late?
You wanted guests,|maybe God heard you.
Who is it?
Is this a bad time?
Not at all.
Not at all. Welcome.
Please, come in.
If you prefer to be|left alone, thaùs fine.
Don't let us spoil|the romance.
Look, Eliyahu: Fish, wine,|candlelight. How romantic!
Moshe, nice one.
Thaùs the Moshe I know.|- You know what, Eliyahu,
I get this feeling|like we're not wanted here.
Why do you say that?|God forbid! Come, sit.
Maybe the rabbi's wife|would mind, huh, Mali?
Not at all, we're so|pleased to see you.
We didn't know|where you went, and...
Whaùs that?
Did you make that, Moshe?|Mullets?
Sea Bream.|- Oh, Sea Bream!
Good Lord!
What a smell of garlic!
Why didn't you go, then?
My wife didn't feel too well,|so we decided to stay.
You sick?|- I wasn't feeling too well.
Get well soon.
Thanks.|I feel a lot better now.
Great.
What about you?
We already ate,|Lord be praised.
Some salad would|work for me right now.
Salad on the way.
Heavy on the lemon, dear.|- No problem.
Why are you standing, Moshe? Sit!|- Wait.
Something to drink?
No soda.
Can't stand gases.|Bring something natural.
Would you go|for some orange juice?
I would run for it.|- Coming up.
Moshe.
What, bro?
Got it. On me.
Whaùs that?|- Moshe's French fries.
The Lord loves you so much.|- Can you believe it?
How they showed up.|I almost died.
Did you add lemon? - A bit.|- Add more. Eliyahu loves it.
Yes?
How merciful is God.
Lord, I love you so much.|What would I do without you?
Moshe's French fries...|- 'Moshe's French fries... '
Can I have a cigarette?
Scorpio, a cigarette? Light?
Yossef, more orange juice?
I'm beat.
Iùs OK if we sleep here?
Of course. Today, tomorrow and|the next day, as long as you want.
Right, Malka?
What a question!|As long as you want.
Are you sure? You don't|have to go anywhere?
Gedera, Hadera, somewhere?
Whaùs with them?|- Flow with it.
You know, Moshe, one could|say many things about you,
that you're a liar,|you're trash
but if someone tells me|that you can't cook fish,
I'd tell him you're a liar!|- Thanks.
Whaùs right is right.
I have to tell you:
You're sweet,
righteous, beloved.
I'm just crazy about you.
You did it big time. You've|given me another chance.
Father. I swear I'll do anything|not to let you down.
Anything.
Good morning.|- Good morning.
Is Moshe home?|- He's out. What do you need?
You got a grill?|- Huh?
A grill, A grill!|- A grill? Sure, wait a second.
Excuse me, here's the grill.
What, no meat?|- No. All gone.
So what gooÔs a grill?|- When Moshe comes we'll buy some.
Iùs noon. Eliyahu's hungry.|- What can I do?
Moshe read all these?|- He's trying.
Really nice.
When is he coming home?|- Soon, any minute.
Whaùs keeping you?|- There's a grill, but no meat.
So what gooÔs a grill?
What a mess.
Where is a butcher|around here?
There's one very close,|near the market...
I can show you, iùs simple...
Got any money left, Yossef?|- None.
So what do we do? I'm hungry.
You need money?
A small loan would help.|- Sure, why not.
Will this do?
If you can spare another...
Please.|To your health. Go and buy.
Thanks!|- Yes, go and buy.
Thanks a lot.
Shake a leg, Yossef,|before it closes.
Thanks, Father.
Now you tell me?|Now you tell me?
I didn't want to upset you.|Besides, we settled things!
Ben Baruch...|Now it all adds up!
That Succah brought me|nothing but grief.
Stress, nerves, had a fight|with my wife, guests came.
I threw them out. Lied to them.|Don't ask.
Now I understand.|I stole the Succah!
Where does he live?|- Who?
Gabay, the guy whose Succah|we took.
Near the market place,|by the Iraqi Synagogue.
I'm going over there.|- Why? I told you iùs settled.
Besides, he doesn't mind.|- I want to hear it for myself.
Now I get why|these two showed up.
Why are they staring at us?
Go on, break it up! Go on!
Get out of here! Animals!|- Listen to how you're talking.
I'll say what I want.|I want them out of here!
Thaùll get you nowhere!|Be nice. Let me, OK?
Righteous one,|holy righteous ones.
This is a religious neighborhood.
What you're doing is inappropriate.
Yeah, whatever. Beat it.
Why do you talk to me|like that?
Go! Go...
Lord have mercy on your souls...|and make you repent...
Whaùs going on?|Is it ready?
Turn off the tape!
Who's gonna make me?
Mrs. Belanga, this is|impossible.
What have you brought|into our neighborhood?
Turn off the tape, please.|- Why?
Iùs a religious neighborhood.|Turn off the tape.
"Thou shalt rejoice in your|in your Festivals." Whaùs wrong?
Wrong?!|Iùs a religious neighborhood!
Don't you get it?
You can't behave like this.
Villains! - Why are you shouting?|- Blasphemy! Criminals!
Profanity! Profanity!|- Thieves, Psychopaths!
What kind of talk is this?|Watch your mouth.
What you're doing, thaùs|blasphemy!
God Almighty, you're the best.|Now I understand everything.
Nothing is without reason.|No nature. Nothing by chance.
I'd have never taken|taken that Succah.
I asked Ben Baruch,|"Are you sure?"
He said, "I'm sure".
Lord, I'm begging you, open|Gabay's heart to forgive me,
because I cant take this test|any longer! Forgiveness.
Why are you doing this?
Get in the Succah,|I beg of you!
Sacrilege!|- Enough!
They are Jews!
No matter what,|I'm not turning it off.
Who's there?
Why are you shouting?|- Are you David Gabay?
Yes, I am.|- Iùs me, with the Succah.
What Succah? - I took your Succah,|with Ben Baruch.
He told me he spoke with you.
Iùs you. - Iùs me.|- I talked to him.
Atonement for my sins.
You absolve me?|You won't bear a grudge?
No.|- Say it.
Say what?|- That you absolve me.
I absolve you.|- No, my good man.
Say: "absolved, absolved,|absolved". Say it.
Absolved, absolved,|Absolved.
You've made me very happy.|Happy Holiday.
If you only knew...|- Happy Holiday, good man.
Forgiveness. Forgiveness.
Sacrilege!
I'm gonna kill him!!
No!
Drop what you're holding.|- She's nuts.
I said drop it!|- Fine!
Get in the house! Get in!
Mali, what? A few laughs.|- Get in!
Get in.|- OK, OK.
Take it easy.
Whaùs this?
Mali!
What happened?
Mali.
What happened here?
Give me a cigarette.
The neighbors, Mali...
They've seen everything.|Give me a cigarette.
What happened here?
Where were you?
Where were you the whole day?!
I had something|important to check.
Why did you leave me|alone with them?!
I left them in the Succah!
Like they'd stay|there all day!
Just know, Heaven will|judge you for this.
What did they do?
What did they do?!|- They tried to kill Wolf!
Animals!
Keep your friends on a leash!
Tell him what happened.
They called the cops.
I want law and order here!
Where are they now?|- In the house.
Go there, tell them to hide,|and don't open for anybody.
Why?!|- Do as I say!
Moshe, whaùs going on here?|- Do as I say. Quickly!
Whaùs going on, Mali?|- A neighbor called the cops.
Cops?!
So much for time|off for good behavior.
We lost that long ago!
Escaped convicts...
Moshe, I'll kill you.
They had a BBQ, they made|trouble, people got angry,
we sent them home.|We'll get over it.
No harm done? Nobody hurt?|- No, the guy's just a bit crazy.
Alright?
Whaùs your name?
Don't let it happen again.|- It won't.
Is the coast clear?|- Wait a minute.
My knees hurt. I'm coming out.|- Don't you dare!
Who is it?|- Mali, open up, iùs me.
He's gone. What miracles.
Where are they?|- Here, Moshe.
What are you doing?|Whaùs wrong?
Whaùs wrong?|What are you doing?
Liar.|- When have I lied?
You know very well.|- No, I don't.
Liar!
What did you tell her?|- Not a word. I swear, Moshe.
Wait, wait, I'll get to you.
What is this all about?|- I'm leaving.
But why? You can't just leave.
You bet I can.|- But I don't know why.
Step aside. - But what did I do?|- Let her go.
'Friends from the old days! '|Liar!
They are.|What do you want?
Like you didn't know they|were criminals on the run?
What? God forbid. Yossef,|Eliyahu, did you tell me this?
Still lying?!|Do you think I'm an idiot?!
He thinks I'm an idiot!
Why did you turn white|when you saw the cops?
Because you knew, right?
Right or wrong?
Mali, he didn't know.
Shut up! Stay out of it!|- OK, OK.
Shut up! Shut up!
Did you know or not?
I knew.|- Thaùs it. Now let me go.
No!
Let go of me,|or I'll beat you up!
Let me explain...|- Explain what?
Why you left me|here with killers!
They're not killers.
I don't care! Let me out!|- Mali, why the insults?
Shut up!|Stay out of it!
Moshe, Moshe!|- Shut up!
Mali...
Poor guy. We got him in deep.
My love, all this grief,|all this mess...
Iùs all because of the Succah.|Iùs over.
I talked to him.|Gabay absolved me.
What do you want from me?
Ben Baruch told me that|it was abandoned!
What was?|- The Succah!
Wait a minute, Mali.
My love, wait a minute,|don't go.
Wait a minute.
Look, I talked to him,|and he absolved me.
Who? Ben Baruch?|- No! Don't you get it!
Gabay! He lives|by the Iraqis' synagogue.
You lost it totally, Moshe.|Leave me alone, OK?
Mali?
Wait. Iùs a test, right?
Remember what you said|about Abraham and Sarah?
It was a test,|I didn't want to blow it.
Forget it.
I don't want to.
Forget it, Moshe. There won't|be a child. Not with me.
Only with you.|- Go away, Moshe.
Go find a new wife, make|a home, a family, children.
You can. Don't get stuck|with me out of pity.
Now, step aside|and let me go.
Please stop following me.|I'm asking you.
Like that?
Only like that.
Your wife left?|- She left.
Did she really leave,|or will she come back?
Don't know. I hope she'll|come back.
She'll be back, with GoÔs help.|- With GoÔs help.
Sorry, Moshe.|- For what?
You didn't do anything.|- Not true.
We came uninvited.|We messed up your life.
Sorry.|- You didn't do anything.
What are you? You're nothing.
No Yossef, no Eliyahu.|Nothing.
There's only God.|And he has his reasons.
You hear that, Eliyahu?
He said we were nothing.|And what are you?
Shut up, Yossef.|- Who does he think he is?
Nothing.
Just like you.
Hello?|- What time is it?
2 AM. You sleeping?|- No.
When are you coming back?
I'm not.
Get on a bus tomorrow,|come home.
I miss you.
I spoke with the Rabbi.|- What did he say?
That I should stay at my mother's.|Go to the Rabbi.
Who's out there?|- Belanga.
He wants to see the Rabbi.|I told him to wait till morning.
And?|- He said he'd wait.
Send him in.
Hello, Rabbi.|- To what do I owe the pleasure?
My wife told me the Rabbi|was looking me.
Sit down.
Rabbi, she doesn't want|to come home.
I told her to rest|for a few days.
The Rabbi told her.
Otherwise you wouldn't come.|I missed you.
Could the Rabbi|speak with her again,
tell her to come back?
You know, Rabbi, I love her.|I can't live without her.
You're a sweet man, Moshe.
If you only knew what happened.|- I heard.
I heard it all.|It will all be for the best.
With GoÔs help.
Rabbi, time for prayers.
Do you have a prayer shawl|and 4 species?
I left them at home.
Vaknin, get him a prayer|shawl and 4 species.
I want you to pray with me.
Look at what our|teacher wrote here,
a marvelous thing:
When a man passes a test,
he progresses. Right?
He thinks that he earned|some rest.
Iùs then that he's given|an even harder test.
No 'resù.|No rest in this world.
Above all, Moyshe,|don't get angry!
Don't get angry!
God Almighty,|save us from anger.
Save us from anger.
Thaùs a great lemon!
Come on.
Does it look OK?|- A 5 star hotel!
Do we wait?|- You bet!
Leùs make the man happy.|We messed him up for no reason.
Good morning!|- Happy Holiday!
Happy Holiday.|- Whaùs up?
Moshe, Moshe.|- Did you invite guests?
This is for you.|- For me?
Looking good...
Some more salad?|- Gladly.
This salad hits the spot.
Moshe,
from all my heart,|I want to tell you something.
You changed completely.|The truth...
At first you pissed me off.|I didn't believe you one bit,
but now I see iùs for real.|I have respect for that.
I respect that.|- Thanks.
How's the salad?|- Iùs pure health.
Lemon kills all diseases.|- You didn't overdo it.
Well, there was only one.|- None in the fridge?
No, I checked everywhere.
But suddenly, I see one on|a shelf. Luck!
Who'd put a lemon on a shelf?|- Thaùs what I thought!
And mind you, not in the|kitchen, in the living room!
In the living room?
No!
Oh, no...
Whaùs wrong with him?|- Moshe, whaùs wrong?
Moshe, whaùs wrong?!
Moshe, don't!
Moshe...
What?!|What, I don't understand!
I really don't understand!|I don't understand at all.
What do You want from me?|What?
I just don't get it!|Have mercy. Explain it to me!
I don't want to be angry,|God Almighty.
I don't want to be angry!|I don't want to be angry,
God Almighty.
Have mercy on me...
Have mercy on me...
Moshe.
Mali.
You look good.
I wanted to see you.
Whaùs so funny?
Nahman.
What about Nahman?
I want us to call him Nahman.
What, you're...
Are you sure?
Mazal Tov, Moshe.
Moshe, Mazal Tov.|- Mazal Tov, Mazal Tov.
My Nachman.
Blessed are You, Lord our|God, King of the universe,
Who sanctified us with His|commandments
and commanded us regarding|circumcision.
Say 'absolveÔ, Gabay.
Absolved, absolved,|absolved...
Moshe, I told you there'd|be miracles!
One must pass in this world|through some confusion,
some obstacles, some changes,|until he understands
a man has to pass this world|on a very narrow bridge
and the truth is sharp|like a strand of hair
and the main thing is|not to be afraid at all.
We've got to rejoice and|never forget what we really are.
There is God.|There's only God.
