2
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,279
What do you have for us?

3
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:14,767
I think I may have found
something of interest.

4
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:19,138
Look at this.

5
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:23,705
Some say she is an abomination
of nature.

6
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:25,912
Carnival freaks?

7
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:27,947
Julius, don`t waste our time.

8
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,611
Yes, sir.
What can I get for you?

9
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,869
A glass of absinthe.

10
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:33,887
Right away, sir.

11
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,789
Flame it, and make sure
the glass is clean.

12
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,156
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,333
I like you Brimstone people.

14
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,324
You never make a mess of the place.

15
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,998
This woman-
What have you heard?

16
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:02,553
What might only be
the tall tales of drunks.

17
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:06,833
This person has tricks
that go beyond the things...

18
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:09,733
normal people can do.

19
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:14,500
Come on, folks! Come on!

20
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,533
The amazing Amanda!

21
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,118
Yes!

22
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:25,691
Step right up!

23
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:28,520
See the freak of all freaks!

24
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,318
Ladies and gentlemen...

25
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:35,502
I give you the beautiful Rayne!

26
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:40,909
A creature so sensitive to water...

27
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:45,235
the very touch of it...

28
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:49,261
burns her skin!

29
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,338
Now-

30
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,160
Painful.

31
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:01,355
So look on.

32
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:07,352
You are about to witness
a horrifying spectacle!

33
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:15,627
Look! Look at that!
Look at that!

34
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:32,900
Her skin is healed!

35
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:35,576
Look! The miracle!

36
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:38,187
Look! The monster!

37
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,106
Inside.

38
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:07,146
Your fee.

39
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:11,608
How long do you think
it will take to get there?

40
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:21,150
Rayne, are you all right?

41
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:24,170
I`m working on a plan
to get us out of here.

42
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:26,172
My uncle- He`s a sailor...

43
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,198
and he once told me of a place
where people play all day...

44
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,570
and the trees grow fruits
in every color of the rainbow...

45
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:36,883
and the sunsets
set the whole sky on fire.

46
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,869
Doesn`t it sound wonderful, Rayne?

47
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,942
He`ll send for us soon.
I know it.

48
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:46,468
Until then,
keep this close to you...

49
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,678
for protection.

50
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,095
Good night, my friend.

51
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:17,591
Good evening, Master Kagan.

52
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,509
Domastir, how does the night find you?

53
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:23,263
I have some disconcerting news.

54
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:24,287
Out with it.

55
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:27,011
There was an incident of blood rage
at the Sherban Carnival.

56
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,910
A dhamphir.
Ayoung woman.

57
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,698
Where is the girl?

58
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,163
There is no girl.

59
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,644
- We`ll find her.
- No.

60
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,678
Then she is alive, the little one
who slipped through my fingers.

61
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:52,391
You must find her.
She poses a threat to my plans.

62
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:54,889
Send out your best spies, Domastir.

63
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,593
Master Kagan.

64
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:52,115
Lay still.

65
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:37,800
Get away!

66
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:25,089
Kagan is building an army of thralls,
and we`re on our way to a carnival.

67
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:29,612
Am I the only one
who thinks this is madness? Katarin?

68
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:32,636
Then how do you suggest
we deal with this army, Sebastian?

69
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:37,156
Brimstone is a shadow
of its former self.

70
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,012
I have yet to see the point
in finding this carnival.

71
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:45,600
Listen, you two, when has a vampire
ever been held in captivity...

72
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:47,752
let alone by a circus troupe?

73
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:50,739
- She may be the one.
- You`re focusing your energies on Kagan.

74
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:52,514
This is what I`ve decided to do.

75
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,520
Haven`t we wasted enough time
with fairy tales?

76
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:29,842
This is the work of a young vampire
out of control.

77
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:36,275
- Blood rage.
- Or, perhaps, a young dhamphir.

78
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,088
We have work to do.

79
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:06,116
Sit still.

80
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,995
Did you see who it was
that bit you?

81
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,560
Rayne, take my sword.

82
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,239
I didn`t see anything.
I don`t even remember what happened.

83
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:40,621
You were bitten by a vampire, and you
don`t remember anything that happened?

84
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,817
- We should kill her now.
- Please.

85
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:45,764
She didn`t mean to bite me.
She`s not a vampire.

86
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:48,833
She was wearing a crucifix
I gave her when it happened.

87
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,303
She is my friend.

88
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,393
We have more work to do.

89
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:07,537
We passed a small village
not too far back.

90
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:11,354
I will see if I can find her hiding there.
With your permission.

91
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:12,769
Yeah.

92
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:20,787
If she`s what I think she is, we`re
likely not the only ones looking for her.

93
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:49,001
You requested me, Viscount.

94
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,468
I have a message for my daughter.

95
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:56,163
Dearest Katarin-

96
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:00,383
All right, Katarin.

97
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,956
Although we`ve had our differences
in the past...

98
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:09,020
I beseech you now
to put away all grudges...

99
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:10,912
for the good of humanity.

100
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,283
It pains me to admit...

101
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:17,312
that our beloved but weakened
Brimstone Society...

102
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:19,240
can no longer defeat Kagan...

103
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:24,165
yet he must not be allowed to acquire
Beliar`s artifacts nor legacy.

104
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,951
Thus I turn to you, my daughter...

105
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:30,804
to help me protect...

106
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:33,264
the souls of this land.

107
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:38,957
You and I are the only ones
who know what is hidden...

108
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:42,696
in Brimstone Fortress-
its value, its importance.

109
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:45,665
I need you to bring
this artifact to me.

110
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,241
It must be protected from those
who wish to use it to undermine me.

111
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:51,019
Scratch that.

112
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:56,338
To undermine freedom
and humanity.

113
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,976
And together we will stop
this madness...

114
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,313
and bring peace to these lands.

115
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,498
Your beloved father,
et cetera, et cetera.

116
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,657
What do you think?

117
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:08,331
A very compelling argument, master.

118
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:12,135
You`re such a suck-up.

119
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,105
Find your own meal.

120
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,469
Keep away from us.

121
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:22,230
I will not harm you.
I only wish to kill vampires.

122
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:38,055
- I`m sorry about your friend.
- He was my brother.

123
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:41,388
I`m sorry that
we had to leave him there.

124
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,344
- Why did you save us?
- I don`t know.

125
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:49,377
- Where is your family?
- I don`t have a family.

126
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:08,069
Dhamphir, Dhamphir.

127
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:11,783
Follow me. Follow me.

128
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:22,090
- Got it.
- Come on.

129
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,377
I see a journey in your future.

130
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,860
Ajourney, perhaps, to within.

131
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:36,078
Dhamphir, you don`t know, do you?

132
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,725
- I will stand.
- I was expecting you.

133
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:44,871
- There`s a reason you`re here.
- What did you call me?

134
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,415
Most believe that your kind
are merely legends.

135
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:52,094
It is rare to see a live dhamphir.

136
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:54,284
Part vampire, part human.

137
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:58,963
Mostly they die at birth.
Generally they are exterminated.

138
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,141
You`ve hidden well.

139
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:07,623
My tales hold some truth, I see.

140
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:10,480
- There was a man.
- A man? Kagan?

141
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:14,155
Kagan`s not a man. He`s a vampire.
And you are his creation.

142
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:15,874
He killed my mother.

143
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:20,009
Dhamphirs are rarely a product of a happy
union between a vampire and a human.

144
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,007
You lie.

145
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,092
Your poor mother.

146
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:34,320
I will kill him.

147
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,691
Listen to me, Dhamphir-
and this is not easy to tell you...

148
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:42,907
and will likely result
in great danger for all involved-

149
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:47,235
Kagan has become
the most powerful vampire...

150
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,894
taking advantage of a land with no law.

151
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:53,490
I do not care.
How do I find him?

152
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:56,585
- You are naive.
- Tell me.

153
00:19:57,618 --> 00:20:00,718
He resides in a guarded castle
beyond the dark mountains...

154
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,687
but there are no safe entrances.

155
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:03,629
But...

156
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:06,941
there is an ancient talisman...

157
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,966
an eye that Kagan seeks.

158
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:14,015
If you possess it,
you will certainly get an audience.

159
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:17,402
- Why do you tell me this?
- Because it`s my purpose...

160
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:19,161
and the prophecy.

161
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:21,445
They say this Talisman of the Eye...

162
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,074
is kept in the Solambria Monastery
to the south.

163
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,356
Be careful, my child. The Eye
is far more than a mere trinket.

164
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,732
The talisman holds great power...

165
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,863
but it`s important
that you move quickly.

166
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:38,148
You will be doing the entire world
a great service keeping this from Kagan.

167
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:42,538
I`m not interested in the world.
Only in Kagan.

168
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,457
I thank you.

169
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:26,669
The fortune-teller had a visitor.
This dhamphir is now in search of the Eye.

170
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:28,688
Good. She can lead us to it.

171
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,906
I highly doubt that her intent
is to deliver it to her long-lost father.

172
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,030
Kill her. Let her find the Eye
or let her try, then kill her.

173
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,843
A dhamphir should be no match for you.

174
00:21:56,766 --> 00:22:00,065
Your suspicion was correct.
Domastir`s on the move.

175
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,729
What is it, my child?

176
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:16,876
I have been separated from my family...

177
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,239
and have been traveling for three days
and nights without food or sleep.

178
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:23,085
May I seek solace in your monastery
for a night`s rest?

179
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:24,818
Please come in, my child.
Welcome to the Solambria Monastery.

180
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,337
Enjoy your food,
and then you may rest.

181
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:44,200
Thank you.

182
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,886
I suggest you follow me.

183
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:28,845
You`re not one of Kagan`s, are you?

184
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,948
No. I mean you no harm...

185
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,353
but I must leave now.

186
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:35,329
I`m sorry.
You cannot leave.

187
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,264
It seems that you absorbed the Eye.

188
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:42,645
Our order has been guarding it
for centuries.

189
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:48,174
Why do you protect it?

190
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:51,538
Because the Eye holds powers.

191
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:54,533
Why do you think water
no longer burns you?

192
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:59,773
There are three talismans-
an eye, a rib and a heart.

193
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,991
They all belonged to a long-dead
vampire named Beliar.

194
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:09,331
He discovered a method to defy
those elements that destroy vampires-

195
00:29:09,518 --> 00:29:13,417
water, sunlight and a cross.

196
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,233
When he was finally defeated...

197
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:18,594
his body was quickly dismembered...

198
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,650
and parts of it were hidden
all over the lands...

199
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,989
out of the reach of vampires.

200
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:26,255
If they become united again...

201
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:31,372
they could make a vampire
powerful enough to control the world.

202
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:33,572
Beliar`s not my concern.

203
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:36,734
My mission is my own
and not of evil intent.

204
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,406
You are a vampire...

205
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:42,254
yet you are immune to the cross.

206
00:29:43,123 --> 00:29:44,520
I am a dhamphir.

207
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,009
So Kagan`s own offspring
is his enemy?

208
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:50,000
How is it you know about me?

209
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:52,935
There has been talk for years
that Kagan was in search...

210
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:54,805
of a prodigious child.

211
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:57,855
His bloodline is strong enough
to produce one.

212
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:00,914
He is our biggest threat.

213
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,404
He has an army of thralls-

214
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:07,928
humans who choose to work for him
rather than die.

215
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:11,535
And they can do things
vampires cannot.

216
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:15,709
Now you understand why
I cannot let you leave with the Eye.

217
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:19,439
Father! Father!
The monastery`s being attacked!

218
00:30:55,614 --> 00:30:57,113
Don`t let Kagan get the Eye.

219
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,721
Where`s the Eye?

220
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:29,076
You fool.

221
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:33,977
Kill her.

222
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:34,111
Hurry! Let`s go!

223
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,005
He`s taking her to Kagan`s.
You must go back to Brimstone.

224
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:58,187
Put them on full alert that
the monastery has been attacked...

225
00:33:58,386 --> 00:33:59,690
and the Eye is gone.

226
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,601
Brimstone.

227
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:37,004
Come closer.

228
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,115
Don`t be afraid.

229
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:45,892
- Leonid`s lair.
- Why would Domastir bring her here?

230
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:48,158
Perhaps she needs to feed,
or the sun.

231
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,216
Now that she has the Eye,
we must capture her.

232
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:54,725
Bring her back to Brimstone
before it`s too late.

233
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:15,816
Domastir, Domastir,
why do you come here...

234
00:36:15,886 --> 00:36:20,384
and insult my palace
with your stench?

235
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:22,376
I need shelter till nightfall.

236
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:44,585
Is that a gift you`ve laid
at my feet, Domastir?

237
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,206
How delightful.

238
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:50,377
No, Leonid, she is Kagan`s.

239
00:36:54,729 --> 00:37:02,829
Kagan, the mightiest...

240
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:07,345
of all vampires.

241
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,660
Funny, Domastir.

242
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:19,049
I do not see him.

243
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,054
Yes.

244
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:37,393
She`ll make a fine addition
to my collection.

245
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,561
Touch her and your fingers are gone!

246
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:43,948
Such a dedicated peon.

247
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:47,055
Fine. Take her, then.

248
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:50,662
I have more than enough...

249
00:37:50,724 --> 00:37:53,988
to satisfy my needs.

250
00:38:02,265 --> 00:38:04,778
But none with an eye like that.

251
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:07,971
She stays.

252
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:09,812
Remove him.

253
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:37,375
Help me.

254
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:38,396
Cut it.

255
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,178
Where did you acquire such a gem?

256
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:56,757
Give it to me...

257
00:38:56,805 --> 00:39:00,374
and I will let you live.

258
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:01,839
Give it to me.

259
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:13,700
You have the Eye!
You give it to me!

260
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:18,162
Give it to me,
or I`ll rip it out of your face!

261
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,964
So we meet again.

262
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:54,829
Vladimir, I`ve always admired your spirit.
It`s a shame you must die.

263
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:58,936
You fool, Vladimir!

264
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:11,015
The Eye. The Eye!

265
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:34,455
Let`s get her out.

266
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:04,204
How can you be certain
she`ll be useful to us?

267
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:08,164
She has already been useful.
She stopped Kagan from getting the Eye.

268
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:10,037
- Yes, Vladimir, but-
- Listen.

269
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:12,920
I`ve been hunting vampires
since before you were born...

270
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:19,105
and there was always one
that I suspected, or hoped, existed.

271
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:21,440
We have to consider
what she is, Vladimir.

272
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:25,385
If she was simply a vampire,
crossing the water would kill her.

273
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:27,897
And there`s also that...

274
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,330
which most vampires
are not fond of having.

275
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:33,305
Where are you taking me?

276
00:41:33,315 --> 00:41:34,930
You should be grateful you`re still alive.

277
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:39,172
We helped each other.
I do not need you anymore.

278
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:44,320
I should skin you
and hang you on display.

279
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:48,448
- Where`s the Eye?
- It has somehow become a part of her.

280
00:41:48,698 --> 00:41:50,342
It has assimilated.

281
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:52,098
She must be brought to me alive.

282
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:55,051
Leave me.
I`ll send further instructions.

283
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:59,794
Does she have a name, the dhamphir?

284
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,368
I have heard she is called Rayne.

285
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,651
Rayne?

286
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:10,457
What is this place?

287
00:42:10,498 --> 00:42:13,975
Welcome to the headquarters
of the Brimstone Society.

288
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:26,477
All in good reason, I hope.

289
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:30,016
There was a messenger killed
in the monastery.

290
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:41,584
Master, the talisman has arrived.

291
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,063
Excellent.

292
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:49,448
This dhamphir`s inconsequential.

293
00:42:49,476 --> 00:42:51,900
It`s Kagan you should be interested in.

294
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:54,884
There was a Brimstone in Rome.

295
00:42:55,402 --> 00:42:58,386
It has been completely annihilated.

296
00:42:58,448 --> 00:42:59,555
And that`s not all.

297
00:43:00,832 --> 00:43:02,114
Kagan has the Rib.

298
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:04,779
Release me.

299
00:43:07,145 --> 00:43:09,218
What would make us think
that you won`t attack?

300
00:43:09,268 --> 00:43:10,129
I told you...

301
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:13,549
I do not thirst for human blood.

302
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:19,309
If you have live animals here-
rats, even-

303
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,287
I will regain my strength quickly
and be on my way.

304
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,464
I don`t trust her.

305
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,093
I want what you want-

306
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:28,910
to bring Kagan to ruin.

307
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:32,523
I speak the truth.
He raped my mother...

308
00:43:33,522 --> 00:43:37,216
and murdered her
in front of my own eyes.

309
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:48,517
Where is she?

310
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,013
- Where is the girl?
- There is no girl.

311
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:24,900
I will find her.

312
00:46:01,047 --> 00:46:03,055
Sometimes
we must have faith in others.

313
00:46:04,376 --> 00:46:07,170
I believe you know that it`s useless
to fight Kagan alone.

314
00:46:07,744 --> 00:46:10,397
If you wish, you`re welcome
to stay here and train with us.

315
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:11,488
Thank you.

316
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:15,389
May I have my swords?

317
00:46:17,398 --> 00:46:19,406
All in good time.

318
00:46:19,562 --> 00:46:21,496
Give her what she needs.

319
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,214
Yes, Katarin?

320
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:41,849
What lies ahead? Will you be
opening up the gates to the thralls?

321
00:46:43,865 --> 00:46:45,051
That`s ridiculous.

322
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:46,742
I am loyal to you, Vladimir...

323
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:49,651
yet you`re breaking the very laws
and teachings you swore by.

324
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,102
Your newfound faith scares me.

325
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,990
What will happen to Brimstone
in the event of battle?

326
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:57,407
I don`t have all the answers.

327
00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:01,714
We`re growing weak.

328
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:17,024
Come on!

329
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:28,867
Control.

330
00:47:28,897 --> 00:47:31,722
Physical strength without control
means nothing.

331
00:47:31,777 --> 00:47:34,654
Once again, from the beginning.

332
00:48:48,209 --> 00:48:50,094
They belonged to a friend.

333
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:53,291
I know someone
that might be able to help.

334
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:08,721
Our seamstress has prepared
some clothing.

335
00:49:08,897 --> 00:49:10,236
I hope they`re to your liking.

336
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:16,602
Are you all right?

337
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,835
Ever since I got here, there are
these noises that persist in my head.

338
00:49:24,568 --> 00:49:26,258
I`m sure there`s some reason for that.

339
00:49:26,305 --> 00:49:27,362
I don`t know.

340
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:29,941
If you`re feeling up to it...

341
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:32,952
you`re more than welcome
to join us for dinner.

342
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,857
I don`t think the food you have there
will be of interest to me.

343
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,753
You act as though
you`re the only one who feels pain.

344
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:44,541
What do you know of pain?

345
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:46,923
My father`s Kagan.

346
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:49,899
My mother was killed
before my own eyes.

347
00:49:55,373 --> 00:49:58,625
My mother and father
were both killed...

348
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:01,848
by Vladimir.

349
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:05,746
They had turned,
and I was to be slaughtered.

350
00:50:06,615 --> 00:50:10,267
Had he not arrived,
I would not be here today.

351
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:35,677
Your food.

352
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,608
What, are we sitting
at the table of the children?

353
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:41,211
We`re running out of food.

354
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:44,351
We have to go to the mainland
and get supplies.

355
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:46,685
No. It`s not a good idea.

356
00:52:46,744 --> 00:52:49,921
- We`ll have to make do with what we have.
- We have to eat.

357
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:02,525
Perhaps your savior
can multiply our supplies.

358
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,418
Welcome.
Won`t you come sit with us?

359
00:53:20,183 --> 00:53:22,720
It seems you`ve become very popular.

360
00:53:23,065 --> 00:53:26,546
I think you`ve breathed
some new hope into the Society.

361
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:30,482
- This surprises you?
- I thought they would be afraid of me.

362
00:53:30,552 --> 00:53:32,844
They only fear what they do not know.

363
00:53:34,184 --> 00:53:36,012
Can I see your teeth?

364
00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:38,682
Darius.

365
00:53:39,954 --> 00:53:41,810
So you`re satisfied
with your new clothing?

366
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,527
Yes. Thank you.

367
00:53:55,534 --> 00:53:56,709
Father...

368
00:53:57,728 --> 00:54:00,194
in the days since
I received your letter...

369
00:54:00,392 --> 00:54:04,408
I have come to see certain truths
that now give me pause.

370
00:54:04,702 --> 00:54:07,145
I believe that you are right.

371
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:10,299
Brimstone is lost.

372
00:54:10,674 --> 00:54:13,184
Be sure this message arrives.

373
00:54:13,419 --> 00:54:16,276
- It is of grave importance.
- Yes, Katarin.

374
00:54:31,149 --> 00:54:32,957
The spoils of Rome.

375
00:54:33,415 --> 00:54:35,400
Only one Brimstone remains.

376
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:37,460
Bring me my thralls.

377
00:54:40,617 --> 00:54:44,081
The time has come to fulfiill your oaths,
my loyal thralls.

378
00:54:44,105 --> 00:54:46,917
Scour the land.
Find Brimstone and destroy it.

379
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:50,568
Bring the dhamphir to me.
Leave no human alive that crosses you.

380
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:53,383
The promise of eternal life
awaits those who succeed.

381
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,861
Those who fail will find only death.

382
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:05,838
- Nice form.
- Finally we agree on something.

383
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:11,586
Vladimir needs you.
He`s in the courtyard.

384
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:13,325
Good match.

385
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,749
Until we duel again.

386
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:22,338
You duel?

387
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:24,813
A little.

388
00:55:35,195 --> 00:55:38,400
Your form is weak.
You`re lacking passion.

389
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:41,626
It`s part of my plan.
I am tiring you out.

390
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,904
Your plan is lacking passion as well.

391
00:55:48,168 --> 00:55:49,707
I see they have taught you well.

392
00:55:50,675 --> 00:55:55,066
Hardly. I was trained in battle
by a great warrior...

393
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:58,294
one whom has long disappeared
fighting alongside Brimstone.

394
00:55:58,341 --> 00:55:59,656
My father.

395
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:05,411
- Where is this warrior now?
- He is now a cursed enemy.

396
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:08,240
A vampire.
My loyalties lie with Vladimir...

397
00:56:08,263 --> 00:56:10,917
and the Brimstone
my father protected as a human.

398
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:13,977
And what do your loyalties consist of?

399
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:18,327
You`re a curious one. My purpose
is to fulfill my father`s will-

400
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:20,230
killing the very thing he`s become.

401
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:26,374
It seems all this chatter
has veered me from the task at hand.

402
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:29,122
You should pay more attention.

403
00:56:31,982 --> 00:56:35,164
Keep your friends close,
enemies even closer.

404
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:37,632
Vladimir taught me that.

405
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:41,657
We shall continue this later.

406
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,913
Good evening, Viscount.
Kagan sends his regards.

407
00:57:00,186 --> 00:57:04,366
I assume you were expecting this message
from Brimstone from Katarin?

408
00:57:06,247 --> 00:57:08,055
Would you stop throwing things at me?

409
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:13,310
You know, Elrick, Kagan has
little patience for ambitious vampires...

410
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:15,741
especially those that were once Brimstone.

411
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,893
Can a vampire not receive word
from his own daughter...

412
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:20,609
without being cast as a rebel
in search of power?

413
00:57:20,715 --> 00:57:23,191
- Is that the plan?
- Plans are for humans.

414
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:25,690
I think destiny
is a more appropriate term.

415
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:29,519
Where is Brimstone? Tell me now,
or suffer the consequences.

416
00:57:29,566 --> 00:57:32,395
Even you must sense
that change is upon us.

417
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:34,822
This land has become unsettled.

418
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:38,257
The future must be held
in the hands of human-born...

419
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:40,054
and vampire-perfected.

420
00:57:41,365 --> 00:57:43,501
That is an invitation, by the way.

421
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,974
Spare Katarin, unseat Kagan...

422
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:53,626
and join me in a, shall we say,
more colorful reign.

423
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:58,248
Kagan`s gratitude or Kagan`s wrath.

424
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:00,014
Now, where`s Brimstone?

425
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:02,462
You honestly expect me...

426
00:58:03,495 --> 00:58:05,156
to betray my daughter?

427
00:58:05,212 --> 00:58:06,903
You know, it`s funny.

428
00:58:07,378 --> 00:58:09,660
You never struck me
as the paternal type.

429
00:58:09,672 --> 00:58:11,230
Now, get me the map.

430
00:58:12,862 --> 00:58:15,058
Give us our destiny.

431
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:18,638
We leave now,
and that will be the end of it.

432
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:21,327
You should travel with Sebastian.

433
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,755
Is there something
you want to speak about?

434
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:30,225
You should not travel with her.

435
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,654
She`s a danger to you.
Kagan is surely out looking for her.

436
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:37,477
You`re an important part
of the Brimstone Society.

437
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:40,608
Your work defending the fortress...

438
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:43,369
is essential to
our struggle and survival.

439
00:58:43,913 --> 00:58:47,152
And no one has ever questioned that.

440
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:49,254
I am not seeking praises.

441
00:58:49,478 --> 00:58:52,766
- I seek to feel secure.
- You are a leader.

442
00:58:52,934 --> 00:58:54,160
Rayne is a fighter.

443
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:57,404
I will take Sebastian if it pleases you.

444
00:59:16,675 --> 00:59:18,929
Iancu`s been a friend for many years...

445
00:59:19,215 --> 00:59:21,340
and a defender of the Society.

446
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:25,801
We`re very fortunate to have him.

447
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:32,035
Iancu has visitors.

448
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,796
Come for some chops, have you?

449
00:59:39,749 --> 00:59:41,252
We`ll be downstairs.

450
00:59:48,058 --> 00:59:50,806
Watch your step.
It`s a long way down.

451
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:52,992
Your kind of place.

452
01:00:06,594 --> 01:00:08,202
Domastir.

453
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:12,429
We must move quickly.

454
01:00:18,769 --> 01:00:19,826
What are those?

455
01:00:21,982 --> 01:00:24,867
Black powder from China.

456
01:00:25,843 --> 01:00:27,158
We will take them.

457
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,951
Is everything ready?

458
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:35,474
Take anything else you need.

459
01:00:36,294 --> 01:00:38,119
Holy water.

460
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:56,536
- A gift from Brimstone.
- Thank you.

461
01:01:38,178 --> 01:01:40,855
Brimstone`s attacked.
They`re all dead.

462
01:01:41,471 --> 01:01:45,780
- That`s not possible.
- It was Domastir and the thralls.

463
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:50,148
Are there any survivors?

464
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:54,217
You can`t go back.
There`s too many.

465
01:01:54,617 --> 01:01:58,413
- They came looking for you.
- How did they find us?

466
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:02,531
I have dressings for his wounds.

467
01:02:08,502 --> 01:02:10,063
This doesn`t feel right.

468
01:02:11,249 --> 01:02:15,059
- How would they know?
- This is what Kagan wants.

469
01:02:15,271 --> 01:02:18,425
To lure back
what`s left of Brimstone to him...

470
01:02:18,464 --> 01:02:20,543
so he can destroy us
once and for all.

471
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:23,431
Domastir will pay with his life for this.

472
01:02:23,509 --> 01:02:26,503
If they want a fight,
a fight they will get.

473
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,466
It was Katarin.

474
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:36,354
You must choose.
Bargain for freedom...

475
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:39,503
or leave your children motherless
as a Brimstone martyr.

476
01:02:39,597 --> 01:02:40,490
Never!

477
01:02:43,191 --> 01:02:45,140
She`s turned.

478
01:02:57,177 --> 01:02:58,210
He`s dead.

479
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:35,358
-Just let me go.
- I can`t.

480
01:03:35,703 --> 01:03:37,417
- You will.
- Where are you going?

481
01:03:37,534 --> 01:03:39,378
I`m going on my own.

482
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:43,246
Everyone who comes near me dies.

483
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,582
They came looking for me and the Eye.

484
01:03:45,644 --> 01:03:48,873
None of those people had to die.
You too will be dead if I stay with you.

485
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:52,545
- You don`t have to do this.
- I`m going to find the Heart.

486
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:56,252
With two of the talismans,
I will stand a chance against Kagan.

487
01:03:56,382 --> 01:03:58,895
How do you expect to find the Heart?

488
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,201
I can hear it.

489
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,711
Good-bye, Sebastian.

490
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:10,648
Just wait. Wait.
Stop. Here.

491
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,094
You can wear this with pride.

492
01:04:16,642 --> 01:04:17,887
Please?

493
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,322
And here.

494
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:27,890
This will protect you.

495
01:05:40,591 --> 01:05:44,583
Sir, we`ve searched the entire grounds.
There`s no sign of the dhamphir.

496
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:48,993
She is not amongst the dead either, sir.

497
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:51,984
Perhaps she was never here.

498
01:05:56,253 --> 01:06:00,105
We must return to Kagan.
She could be on her way there now.

499
01:06:00,547 --> 01:06:03,148
- Prepare the boats!
- Yes, sir.

500
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,332
The Heart.

501
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,862
Perhaps there`s some truth
to this prophecy after all.

502
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:42,754
Even if she has the Heart,
she can`t face Kagan alone.

503
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:00,239
Nothing yet.

504
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:03,438
- Are you certain that it`s down there?
- Are you questioning me?

505
01:07:03,572 --> 01:07:05,438
My grandfather placed it there.

506
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,484
I would not risk all on folktales.

507
01:07:07,618 --> 01:07:09,332
Why did we let the others die?

508
01:07:09,873 --> 01:07:12,708
It was them or all of us.

509
01:07:14,016 --> 01:07:17,703
We sacrifice animals to survive.
Brimstone is no different.

510
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:19,811
I will kneel before no one...

511
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:23,136
nor will I sit here under
Vladimir`s command and await death.

512
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:27,248
I will not allow Kagan
to take away our freedom.

513
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:30,004
The Heart will go to my father.

514
01:07:30,372 --> 01:07:34,153
And if you want to live, you will
secure the entrance until I return.

515
01:07:34,615 --> 01:07:35,989
Yes, Katarin.

516
01:09:38,184 --> 01:09:40,673
She`s not coming.
It`s too late.

517
01:09:40,773 --> 01:09:44,007
Have faith, Sebastian.
She will be here.

518
01:09:52,516 --> 01:09:54,488
I am here for Kagan.

519
01:09:55,138 --> 01:09:56,947
What is she doing?

520
01:10:02,194 --> 01:10:04,639
I have brought the Heart for my father.

521
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:07,463
Give it to me.
Come on.

522
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:14,394
You have what you want.
Now take me to Kagan.

523
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:16,979
All in good time.
Take her.

524
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,791
Well, Sebastian...

525
01:10:23,647 --> 01:10:26,371
I`m afraid there`s only one way in.

526
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:36,880
Get in!

527
01:11:02,709 --> 01:11:03,296
Master.

528
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:07,899
The dhamphir has come to her senses
and delivered the Heart.

529
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:10,109
Excellent.

530
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:15,001
- Shall I bring her in?
- No, not yet.

531
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:18,968
An historic night.

532
01:11:21,117 --> 01:11:23,465
Prepare to witness
the beginning of a new era.

533
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:25,590
Clear the room.

534
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:31,820
- Clear the room!
- Thralls! Forward!

535
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:33,314
March!

536
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:03,917
Capture them alive.
Take them to the dungeon.

537
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:05,709
To the dungeon!

538
01:12:17,149 --> 01:12:20,800
There may be more. Leave them
in the cell for now and scour the castle.

539
01:12:24,701 --> 01:12:26,815
The rats will be eating well tonight.

540
01:12:29,051 --> 01:12:30,495
Enjoy your stay.

541
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:36,424
And you, my dear,
you will stay here until the ceremony.

542
01:12:36,859 --> 01:12:39,886
- I know nothing of a ceremony.
- The Eye, dhamphir.

543
01:12:40,049 --> 01:12:42,121
The ceremony to extract the Eye.

544
01:12:46,754 --> 01:12:48,594
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

545
01:12:49,774 --> 01:12:51,605
It is good to know
that you are both alive.

546
01:12:51,709 --> 01:12:55,924
- I fear we`re the only ones.
- What of Katarin? Is she still alive?

547
01:12:57,328 --> 01:13:00,983
If not, then she died with honor...

548
01:13:01,265 --> 01:13:04,470
fighting for her people.

549
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,741
What do you know of this ceremony?

550
01:13:07,826 --> 01:13:11,431
It`s an ancient vampire ritual
created to protect the talismans...

551
01:13:12,045 --> 01:13:14,723
in case they fall
into the wrong hands.

552
01:13:14,798 --> 01:13:16,818
What will come of me?

553
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:23,833
It is only a legend
said to remove the soul.

554
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:33,329
Listen.

555
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:40,521
I do not know
what is going to happen to me now.

556
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:43,199
I hope that you know
that I am not foolish enough...

557
01:13:43,342 --> 01:13:47,323
to think that I`m going
to prevail against him.

558
01:13:48,066 --> 01:13:53,197
But I do not intend
to stop fighting for a second.

559
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,468
Nor will we.

560
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:17,601
Open up.

561
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:19,628
And bind her hands.

562
01:14:23,552 --> 01:14:25,125
It is time for the ceremony.

563
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,986
Come.

564
01:14:33,443 --> 01:14:37,623
- We`ve got to find a way out of here.
- Well, let`s get out then.

565
01:14:47,552 --> 01:14:49,853
Even in absolute defeat,
you`re still not humble.

566
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:52,359
If I`m defeated
and you`re so powerful...

567
01:14:52,475 --> 01:14:54,964
then why must I be shackled
when surrounded by your thralls?

568
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:58,624
You`re still a risk. I should thank you
now that Brimstone is eradicated...

569
01:14:58,685 --> 01:15:00,658
and you have so kindly
handed me the Heart.

570
01:15:00,749 --> 01:15:03,438
I would never have believed
it would have been so easy.

571
01:15:04,544 --> 01:15:06,834
If you live through this,
which is unlikely...

572
01:15:06,883 --> 01:15:08,750
you may remain here in my castle.

573
01:15:09,328 --> 01:15:12,839
I would sooner rot in your dungeon
than sit at your table.

574
01:15:14,192 --> 01:15:15,273
So be it.

575
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:17,224
Let us begin.

576
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:21,523
Thrall, my companion is gone.

577
01:15:21,706 --> 01:15:24,407
I don`t know
what`s become of him.

578
01:15:25,443 --> 01:15:27,357
Stand back.

579
01:15:37,597 --> 01:15:39,980
Can`t believe that worked.

580
01:15:49,267 --> 01:15:50,594
Savage!

581
01:15:53,397 --> 01:15:54,512
Please continue.

582
01:18:12,636 --> 01:18:14,949
This is the end of Brimstone.

583
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:02,737
You have the Heart.
Give it to me.

584
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:04,437
You will have to cut it from me.

585
01:19:04,514 --> 01:19:06,686
So be it.

586
01:19:18,544 --> 01:19:20,469
You`re strong, Rayne,
but not skilled enough.

587
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,348
Give me the Heart,
and I shall spare your life.

588
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:25,548
I would choose death
over seeing you as my ruler.

589
01:19:25,607 --> 01:19:28,131
You`re interfering with fate.
With the talismans joined...

590
01:19:28,552 --> 01:19:30,149
vampires shall rule the earth.

591
01:19:30,234 --> 01:19:32,369
As if your interests are noble.

592
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,440
For centuries, we`ve been cursed to
the shadows, slaughtered by the fearful.

593
01:19:38,476 --> 01:19:40,413
Have you not always longed for freedom?

594
01:19:40,524 --> 01:19:42,940
You condemned me
the day you raped my mother.

595
01:19:43,025 --> 01:19:45,388
I will see she has vengeance.

596
01:20:02,394 --> 01:20:04,085
Ungrateful bitch.

597
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:26,270
Choose to be human
and die like one.

598
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:48,878
I will find her.

599
01:21:30,554 --> 01:21:33,830
- The talismans.
- I don`t care. Kagan is dead.

600
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:35,556
But what about you?

601
01:21:35,902 --> 01:21:38,861
No! No, no.

602
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:42,344
Please. Please.

603
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:44,200
Please, you don`t have to leave me.

604
01:21:44,626 --> 01:21:46,552
It`s my time.

605
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:49,421
Kagan`s finished.

606
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,058
