2
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,199
1-nil!

3
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,195
Coming in, number 2!

4
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:02,786
This is what's wrong with the play.

5
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,389
Bye-bye, Hunter.

6
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:07,650
Bremner!

7
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,740
So it's sheer bedlam.

8
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:11,028
Oh, dear.

9
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:13,361
And now what?
More trouble off the ball.

10
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,659
This match has been riddled
with free kicks...

11
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:17,735
from the start.

12
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:19,703
Leeds have got
what they deserved.

13
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,613
They've taken the FA Cup
for the first time.

14
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:25,723
Domarski coming up square,
number 10.

15
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:29,951
And it's there. And England
are out of the World Cup.

16
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:35,888
The end of an era, Sir Alf Ramsey.

17
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:41,050
What sort of manager
is the FA now looking for?

18
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:43,131
I presume a new... A young...

19
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:47,790
With perhaps new ideas
and a track - suited manager.

20
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,942
Thank you.

21
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:17,550
I'm just gonna make
a brief statement.

22
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:21,087
Yesterday afternoon at 3:00...

23
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:23,356
I accepted the FA's offer
to become...

24
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,907
the next manager of the
England national football team.

25
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,300
Now, obviously, this involves me
leaving Leeds United...

26
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:35,023
after 13 happy and successful years...

27
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,591
which makes me very sad.

28
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:42,487
I'd like to think
I built the club into a family.

29
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:45,820
Now, there must be sadness
when anyone leaves a family.

30
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:47,597
However...

31
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:51,374
when one man leaves,
another steps into his place.

32
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,896
I know who I think
that person should be...

33
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,038
the man to replace me.

34
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,621
And I have made my feelings clear
to the board of directors.

35
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:04,077
Thank you. No further comments.

36
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:06,061
- Someone from the team?
- Billy Bremner?

37
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,663
Is it someone
from Leeds' team, Mr. Revie?

38
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,572
- Give us a name, Mr. Revie.
- Giles?

39
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,903
- Is it Johnny Giles?
- Is it Johnny Giles?

40
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,500
Can you give us a name, Mr. Revie?
Can you give us a name?

41
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:56,579
- When are we there?
- Any moment now. On the right.

42
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:02,791
- There it is!
- It's there, Dad!

43
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,569
Where are you going?

44
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,783
- Brian!
- Brian!

45
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,073
Stop!

46
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,487
- Dad?
- You missed it.

47
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,589
There's something else to do first.

48
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:19,371
It won't take long.

49
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:26,001
We welcome Brian Clough who starts
his job as manager of Leeds United...

50
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,708
taking over from Don Revie...

51
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:30,136
the most successful manager
in club history...

52
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:33,598
- under whom Leeds won everything.
- Not quite everything.

53
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,584
Not won the European Cup.

54
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,344
But pretty much everything else.

55
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:40,417
- Daunted?
- Daunted? Not at all, Austin.

56
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:41,947
Looking forward to it.

57
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:44,247
The biggest challenge of your life...

58
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:47,065
and you'll be without Peter Taylor
for the first time...

59
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:50,382
- a lifelong professional colleague.
- Yes, Pete's at Brighton now.

60
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:52,401
He had the opportunity
to come with me.

61
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:56,203
But Brighton was his choice,
Leeds was mine.

62
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,244
A surprising choice,
some might say...

63
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:00,126
because you've been very vocal...

64
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:02,284
in your criticism of them
over the years.

65
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,534
I have.

66
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,744
You've accused the players
of dirty tactics...

67
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,358
cheating, dissent, foul play.

68
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:11,307
You've called Norman Hunter
Norman " Bites Yer Legs" Hunter.

69
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,790
Peter Lorimer falls
when no one touches him.

70
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,973
- And I was right.
- But I'm curious.

71
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:18,543
Why do you now show such alacrity
to joining them...

72
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,610
after such vituperative criticism
of them for so long?

73
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,539
Goodness. It will take me half an hour
to explain all those words for a start.

74
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:30,224
Football is a beautiful game, Austin.

75
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,420
It needs to be played beautifully.

76
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:34,586
I think Leeds
have sold themselves short.

77
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:37,956
They've been champions,
but they've not been good champions.

78
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,259
In the sense of wearing the crown well.
They've not been loved.

79
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:46,356
But then, you know,
that's hardly surprising given...

80
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,491
the type of operation
that's been in place there.

81
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:52,817
"That type of operation"? I presume
you're referring to Don Revie...

82
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:55,676
who has long been regarded
as a father figure in Leeds.

83
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:57,754
Now you're coming in
as the outsider...

84
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,839
the enemy, even, after all the things
you've said in public.

85
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,849
Coming in and taking over
as a stepfather.

86
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:06,625
Wouldn't you expect some degree
of resentment to this?

87
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,897
I would accept...

88
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:12,142
and expect a strangeness...

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,719
initially.

90
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,462
Perfectly normal.

91
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:19,935
But it won't be long before they realise
I'm a fair man...

92
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:22,166
a kind man.

93
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:24,014
I'm a warm man.

94
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,610
And maybe under me...

95
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,636
they can experience what it's like
to be in a happy family after all.

96
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:33,088
But how can you be sure
they weren't happy with Don all along?

97
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:37,406
Well, they wouldn't have played
football that way if they were happy.

98
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:58,285
- Brian!
- Brian!

99
00:06:58,397 --> 00:06:59,596
- Brian!
- Brian!

100
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,208
Hey, get out of the way!

101
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:02,996
Now, out you go, lads.

102
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:06,150
Where have you been? The directors
been waiting for over an hour.

103
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,616
Brian, what's it like to be at Leeds?

104
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,009
It's a pleasure to be here...

105
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:14,165
and I'm looking forward
to a very good...

106
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:17,175
long - lasting relationship
with Leeds United.

107
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,902
There you go, young man.
Thanks very much.

108
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:23,375
Will Peter Taylor be joining you
at Leeds, Mr. Clough?

109
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,520
Wait there a second.

110
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:28,224
- Wait here a minute.
- Morning, lads.

111
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,041
Lovely Yorkshire weather.

112
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,771
It makes me wanna jump on a plane
right back to Majorca.

113
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:43,751
Thank you very much.

114
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,883
There are very important people
waiting.

115
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:47,254
Can't keep them waiting.

116
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,909
Not much of a welcome, is it?

117
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,259
- Not a smile from Johnny Giles.
- You're 5 days late.

118
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:56,099
And did you really have to say that
about Majorca?

119
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,680
He was Revie's first choice
to get your job.

120
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,678
- Who? Johnny Giles?
- Aye.

121
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:05,554
Was he now?

122
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:07,761
And Bremner?

123
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:09,203
Club captain.

124
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:12,038
Don's son and heir.

125
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,536
You'll never get any love out of him.

126
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:18,216
- Great.
- Come on, boys.

127
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,398
Here's to happy fucking families.

128
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,052
It should be just round here.

129
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:26,197
I want you two to behave for
your elderly Uncle Jimmy, all right?

130
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:27,691
- See you.
- Come in, Brian.

131
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,400
Sit down there, lads.

132
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,603
What?
No one gonna offer me a drink?

133
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,454
Like an undertaker's in here.

134
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:43,286
Why did you do it?

135
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,006
Do what?

136
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:48,722
The interview
for Yorkshire Television.

137
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,094
We've had a phone call.

138
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,883
Not so much a phone call,
more a bloody tirade.

139
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:55,361
From Don.

140
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:58,071
He quoted
some of the things you said.

141
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:02,571
" How unhappy the players were
under him."

142
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:05,943
"What bad champions."

143
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:09,292
- Looking for the response.
- Bloody got one as well.

144
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:12,001
- He's gone berserk.
- He had it coming.

145
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,834
He shouldn't have done that piece
in the Mirror about me.

146
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:17,512
Saying he thought
I was a daft choice.

147
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,503
- Well, he's entitled to his opinions.
- I'm entitled to mine.

148
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,802
And I'm entitled to mine.

149
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:28,871
I hired you to do this job...

150
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:31,613
because you're the best
young manager in this country.

151
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,249
Thank you. I'm the best old one too.

152
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,119
I also did it...

153
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,715
under the assumption...

154
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:41,181
that you would be coming here
wanting the best for this club.

155
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,528
For the city of Leeds.

156
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,864
So why do I get the feeling
this is all about you and Don?

157
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:49,604
Of course it's just about me and Don.

158
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:51,397
Always has been.

159
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:54,910
But instead of putting frowns
on your foreheads...

160
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,419
you elders of Leeds in your blazers
and your brass - fucking - buttons...

161
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:03,888
it should put big white Colgate
smiles on your big white faces.

162
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:08,114
Because it means
I won't eat, and won't sleep...

163
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,249
until I've taken whatever
that man's achieved, and beaten it.

164
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:16,061
Beaten it so I never have to hear
the name Don - fucking - Revie again.

165
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:17,378
Beat it.

166
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,629
The only name anyone sings
in the Yorkshire ale houses...

167
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:23,847
raising their stinking jars
to their stinking mouths...

168
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,261
is Brian Clough.

169
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:30,376
Brian Clough uber - fucking - alles.

170
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,995
Understand?

171
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,007
Number 25.

172
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:04,736
Manchester United...

173
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:09,293
Number 41.

174
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:12,357
will play Tottenham Hotspur.

175
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:16,017
- Number 22.
- Come on, Pete.

176
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,149
- Derby County...
- Derby County, second division.

177
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,691
Here we go, that's us.

178
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,669
will play...

179
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:27,625
- number 6, Leeds United.
- Against the mighty...

180
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:29,273
- Leeds!
- Leeds!

181
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:30,777
Leeds! Good God!

182
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,059
Don Revie's Leeds!

183
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:36,266
- Don Revie's Leeds
- I don't believe it.

184
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,365
Top of Division 1, here we come!

185
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,927
What do you say to that,
Mr. Chairman?

186
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,508
I can hear the cash registers now.

187
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:49,656
Happy days, sir! Happy days!

188
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:51,307
You've done well, Brian.

189
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:53,573
Take your family out for a meal.

190
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,429
Go to the Mumtaz.
Tell them it's on me.

191
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,428
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

192
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:02,713
Put the fish and chips in the bin.
Tonight's on Uncle Sam.

193
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:06,468
We're going posh.
Chicken bhuna in town!

194
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:13,710
Come on, Simon. Get your gloves,
Simon. Get your coat on.

195
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:17,008
- Leeds United!
- Leeds!

196
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,795
Right, you two, I want Billy Bremner
and Johnny Giles...

197
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,526
to be able to read that.

198
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:27,246
Come on.

199
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:37,059
And this door has gotta be fit
for Donald Revie to walk through.

200
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,792
Well, chop - chop.

201
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,315
There you are. Right, ladies.

202
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:52,224
Spick - and - span, remember.
Wash these walls down.

203
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:55,761
Give the floors a proper polish.
I'll be back! Come on, off you go!

204
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,479
I want it perfect.

205
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,504
Like a fucking carpet.

206
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,505
We've got proper footballers
coming...

207
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:08,781
who know how to keep the ball
on the deck.

208
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:12,129
Well, you can't fucking train
on it then.

209
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:25,552
What a joker.

210
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,229
Come on, Kev,
keep on your man. Pass it!

211
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:30,605
Yeah, yeah, again. Again.

212
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:33,060
You know,
he'll be making a file on us.

213
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:34,524
A dossier.

214
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:37,103
- Who?
- Don Revie.

215
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:39,372
Prepares a file on every game.

216
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:41,626
Leaves nothing to chance.

217
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:45,770
Knows every opponent's formations,
strategies, everything.

218
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:48,552
I've heard he's a superstitious twat.

219
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,409
We grew up just a few streets apart
in Middlesbrough...

220
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:53,287
close to Ayresome Park.

221
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,884
He'll have known my street,
Valley Road.

222
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:00,196
Probably bought sweets from Garnett's
factory where me dad worked.

223
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:03,093
I heard he wears the same suit
to every game.

224
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,625
His lucky blue suit.

225
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:08,642
Best manager in the country,
Don Revie.

226
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,364
Played for Sunderland, like me.

227
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:13,357
A centre forward like me.

228
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:16,638
- And England like me.
- Give it and go!

229
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:19,587
Peas in a pod, me and Don.

230
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:21,801
2 peas in a bloody pod.

231
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:24,644
Right, you saw that?
That's the way you do it!

232
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:00,209
They're here.

233
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,814
Well, almost.

234
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:08,316
Pass it!

235
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:10,389
Move!

236
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:19,210
I want Billy to sign
my autograph book.

237
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,452
What are they doing?

238
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,010
Ran out of petrol, boss.

239
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:29,474
No.

240
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:31,695
It's that superstition, ain't it?

241
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,428
Every away Cup tie...

242
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,179
Revie makes them walk
the last hundred yards.

243
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:38,628
Soppy twat.

244
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:47,757
Billy!

245
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,678
- Billy! Billy!
- How are you doing there?

246
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,368
All right?

247
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,098
All right?

248
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:08,066
Mr. Giles, quick picture!

249
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:10,596
Mr. Revie!

250
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:18,375
Welcome to Derby, Don.
A pleasure to meet you.

251
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,731
I'm... I'm Brian Clough.

252
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:23,796
Hello. Yeah, hello, hello.

253
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:34,088
It's the 3rd round of the FA Cup.

254
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:35,542
Here we go.

255
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:38,601
It's Derby County against
Leeds United at the Baseball Ground.

256
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,187
Come on, boys!

257
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,448
Derby County in the white shirt...

258
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:44,010
very much the underdogs...

259
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:46,353
as they face
the First Division champions.

260
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:51,743
Playing today in their away strip
of dark blue shirts and yellow shorts.

261
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,439
Remember what I said.

262
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:57,965
Giles dispossessed by Hector.

263
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:00,843
Well, the atmosphere
is absolutely electric.

264
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:02,574
But the pitch, as ever at Derby...

265
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:05,501
in poor condition
and heavily sanded.

266
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:08,495
Giles. Oh, that's a strong challenge
on McFarland.

267
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:11,693
That was diabolical! Diabolical!

268
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:14,826
There have been question marks
about some of Leeds players...

269
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:17,527
intimidating referees.

270
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:23,648
And it looks like McFarland
is out of the match.

271
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:26,094
That don't look good.

272
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:29,539
- You all right, Brian?
- Yeah.

273
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,101
Leeds with the free kick.
Delivered deep.

274
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,476
Oh, here's Clark e.
He's unmark ed at the back post.

275
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,418
Leeds lead by one goal to nil!

276
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,140
Well played, Billy.

277
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,860
Giles with the corner.

278
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,320
Bremner.

279
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:49,113
Fucking close him down!

280
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,619
Bremner's gone down!

281
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:54,043
- What?
- There didn't appear to be any contact!

282
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:57,865
- The referee has given a spot - kick.
- He never fucking touched him, ref!

283
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,187
He dived!

284
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,277
He fucking dived!

285
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,219
Well played, Billy.

286
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:05,937
And that penalty spot...

287
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:09,969
is lost somewhere in the middle
of a desperate patch of mud.

288
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,089
And it's 2- nil.
Leeds have won it now!

289
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,180
Don Revie sending a clear message
to his rivals.

290
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:20,548
Leeds is still
very much the team to beat.

291
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:23,448
- Unlucky, unlucky.
- Derby totally outclassed.

292
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,488
And for Brian Clough
and Peter Taylor...

293
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:28,791
it's been a sobering afternoon.

294
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,332
Didn't say goodbye.

295
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:40,257
Or pay me the respect of staying
for a drink.

296
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,671
Couldn't wait to get away.

297
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,486
Well, he cheats and all.

298
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,841
Neither of those goals
should've been allowed.

299
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:50,194
We're just gonna have
to beat him, Pete.

300
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:53,176
Beat him if it's the last thing I do.

301
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:55,403
Thanks a lot, boss.

302
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:59,625
- After you, Billy.
- Mr. Bremner, was that a dive?

303
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:04,463
We need to get up
into the same division first.

304
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:08,394
We need someone with a good head.

305
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,963
- Experience.
- I know.

306
00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:12,982
Our lot were like headless chickens.

307
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,625
First thing Monday morning...

308
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:18,027
I want you to go and find me
that player, a wise head.

309
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,959
- We haven't...
- No worry about money.

310
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:23,608
That's my problem.
Just you go and find him.

311
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,085
Well, Simon's eaten up
his mashed potato.

312
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,691
Not now, love. Please.

313
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:42,029
But it might be Pete.

314
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,871
- Pete.
- Of course it's Pete.

315
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,711
- Yeah, of course it's Pete.
- Don't be cheeky, Nigel.

316
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,350
But it might be important.

317
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:52,511
Come on, eat your carrot soup
for your mother.

318
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,299
- Hello?
- You asked me to find a player...

319
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,483
with a good head, experience.

320
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:02,372
Well, I found one.

321
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,878
He's perfect.

322
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:05,100
Dave Mackay.

323
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,190
Dave Mackay. He...

324
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,879
- He's 150.
- I admit he's not young.

325
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:12,391
Not young. He's old as bloody time.

326
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:13,976
But, oh, he's clever, Brian.

327
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,760
Keeps the ball well,
passes it better than anyone alive.

328
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,278
Pete.

329
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:21,558
That's enough. Come back.

330
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:23,706
He's the one, Brian.

331
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:25,173
Are you sure?

332
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:27,762
Never been more sure
of anything in me life.

333
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:30,096
All right.
I'll talk to Longson in the morning.

334
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:31,511
Haven't got till morning.

335
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:33,528
Hearts have already made him
an offer.

336
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:34,973
Want him as their manager.

337
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:37,444
Apparently,
the terms have been agreed.

338
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,062
Well, what did you
bloody call me for then?

339
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,086
Because when I asked Bill Nick
how done the deal was...

340
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:45,032
he said 99%

341
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:49,377
Meaning he hasn't signed.

342
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:52,013
Exactly.

343
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:55,860
Right, Brian, that's enough.
Come and sit down.

344
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,816
Your dinner's getting cold.

345
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:06,504
Brian?

346
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:08,484
Love?

347
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:14,966
Come on. Open.

348
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:16,990
There you go.

349
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:21,268
- Where will we play him, then?
- Somewhere he can see everything.

350
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,359
Use his loaf, tell the kids what to do.

351
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:24,884
- Play him at sweeper.
- Aye.

352
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:27,267
He won't have to run about
so much now, will he?

353
00:22:27,368 --> 00:22:29,540
Fat bastard.

354
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,541
What's all this I hear
about a tie shop?

355
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:37,108
He got a tie shop, ain't he, in London,
which he spends 2 days a week at.

356
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,219
Fucking tie shop?

357
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:41,464
It's his little nest egg for the future.

358
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:44,877
No one will be wearing fucking ties
in 20 years' time.

359
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:48,221
I hope his footballing brain
is better than his business brain.

360
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:51,455
Hey. Here, come on.
Get it down. Open.

361
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,665
You know, it's illegal
to sign someone on the Sabbath.

362
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:06,763
Is it?

363
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:09,168
Well, perhaps
you should just shake on it today.

364
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,549
And sign for it tomorrow.

365
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,765
What? And let Hearts in
again in the morning?

366
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,098
Fuck off.

367
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:17,531
I'm not leaving here
without a signature.

368
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:20,386
God, you'd bloody do that too
wouldn't you?

369
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:23,616
Come all this way
just to shake hands.

370
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,751
Dear, oh, dear.

371
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,998
What would you do without me?

372
00:23:28,092 --> 00:23:31,106
Hey, you wouldn't have found him
if it weren't for me.

373
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:34,710
Good job we're both wearing ties.

374
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,898
Jehovah's Witness, Dave.
May the Lord be with you.

375
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:46,217
- Who the bloody hell are you?
- My name's Brian Clough.

376
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,929
I've the pleasure
of playing for England against you...

377
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:51,340
in an under - 23 match.

378
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:54,865
I remember you now.

379
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:58,622
You had a black eye.
A right bloody shiner.

380
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,166
You never stopped fucking talking.

381
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:02,670
What are you doing here?

382
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,051
I've come to talk to you
about the promised land.

383
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,952
A land of milk and honey.

384
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:10,270
A little place up the M1
called Derby.

385
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:12,629
May we come in?

386
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,683
Aye.

387
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:20,067
- Come on, lads!
- Knees up.

388
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:21,774
That's it. That's it. Come on.

389
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:23,406
It's supposed to hurt.

390
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:27,489
- Faster. Come on.
- Come on, get those knees up.

391
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:29,984
Dave Mackay.

392
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,747
- You don't sound happy, Uncle Sam.
- I'm not.

393
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:36,224
What were you thinking going
over my head? Why didn't you call?

394
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,209
Because you'd have said no.

395
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,049
Bloody right I'd have said no.

396
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,405
The man's bloody crocked.

397
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:43,541
Pete reckons he's good for
3 more years.

398
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:44,951
Is he, fuck.

399
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,168
He's broken
more bones than Eve the Knieve.

400
00:24:48,306 --> 00:24:50,265
Trust me, Mr. Chairman.

401
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:52,550
It's money well spent.

402
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:54,086
Who the fuck are they?

403
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:57,348
That'll be Messrs. McGovern
and O'Hare.

404
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:59,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

405
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:01,763
Where did they come from?

406
00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:04,787
Me old stomping grounds,
Hartlepools and Sunderland.

407
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,556
Very reasonable too.

408
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:08,707
Just doing what's best for the club.

409
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,129
That'll be my club, Brian. My club.

410
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,698
5- a - sides.

411
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:16,724
- Okay, lads.
- Come on, move! Move now!

412
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:19,732
- Mr. Mackay, over here.
- Hey, you all right, fellas?

413
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:21,457
Give them a smile.

414
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:24,063
Pretend you're happy
to be here in Derby.

415
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:28,828
If you lot don't perform for us,
I'll feed you to these guys, all right?

416
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:32,383
- Who's got the prettiest face here?
- The one in the middle.

417
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:35,742
- I think it's Dave Mackay, isn't it?
- I'm not answering that question.

418
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:39,443
That's nice football, lads. Well done!

419
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:41,611
Now you're thinking about it!

420
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:45,886
Let's play some football!
Let's play some football!

421
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:47,586
You're a genius, Pete.

422
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:50,372
Bloody genius. How did you see it?

423
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:52,170
Don't know. It's just obvious.

424
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:55,523
McGovern in midfield.
Mackay at the back. O'Hare up front.

425
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:58,345
It's the skewer, isn't it?
In the shish kebab.

426
00:25:58,462 --> 00:26:00,061
Beautiful.

427
00:26:00,132 --> 00:26:02,051
A thing of fucking beauty.

428
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:04,626
- Hey, get off.
- Come on! That's the way!

429
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,366
Dave Mackay.

430
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,038
Out to McGovern.

431
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:12,927
Oh, he hit it just right!

432
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,952
O'Hare!

433
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,632
And it's there!

434
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,381
Yes! Come on!

435
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,854
Durban back to McGovern.
McGovern with the shot.

436
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,256
Durban. It's in!

437
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:28,919
Oh, and a magnificent goal!

438
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:32,190
And it's a goal!

439
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,146
O'Hare and Hector
in the penalty area.

440
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:36,548
O'Hare. Beautiful football!

441
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:38,408
Yes! Come on!

442
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:41,165
It was all so easy.

443
00:26:41,282 --> 00:26:43,001
- Yeah!
- That's it.

444
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:44,896
Derby win the Second Division.

445
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:50,667
It's a magnificent achievement
for Brian Clough's team.

446
00:26:50,964 --> 00:26:53,853
Go on, Brian. Fill it up. Fill it up.

447
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:32,451
Shush, shush, look, look, look.

448
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:34,473
Look.

449
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:42,034
For Leeds
to win the First Division title...

450
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:45,801
being named Manager of the Year
really is a dream come true.

451
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:50,931
I've a lot of people to thank.
I've had a lot of support, all year.

452
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,583
Yeah, you enjoy it, Don.

453
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:56,247
Go home, put your feet up
and enjoy it. There's a good lad.

454
00:27:56,404 --> 00:27:59,123
Because we'll be in the First Division
next season.

455
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:00,881
And we're gonna have you!

456
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:04,763
- Yes! Yes!
- We're with you!

457
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,457
Come on, boys. Let's go.

458
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,281
That's it.

459
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:37,067
Right.

460
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:40,865
Better go and make myself known.

461
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:45,656
Behave yourselves.

462
00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:47,254
Right.

463
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:48,480
See you, lads.

464
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:50,510
- See you.
- See you.

465
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,928
All right, gentlemen,
gather around, please.

466
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,898
Well, I might as well tell you now.

467
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:16,988
You lot may all be internationals...

468
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,998
and have won all the domestic
honours there are to win...

469
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:22,283
under Don Revie.

470
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:25,897
But as far as I'm concerned,
the first thing you can do for me...

471
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,289
is to chuck all your medals and all
your caps and all your pots and pans...

472
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:33,393
into the biggest fucking dustbin
you can find.

473
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,600
Because you've never won
any of them fairly.

474
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:40,112
You've done it all
by bloody cheating.

475
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:46,310
Mr. William Bremner,
you're the captain and a good one.

476
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:50,378
But you're no good to the team
and no good to me if you're suspended.

477
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:53,268
I want you fit for every game.

478
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:57,146
And I want good, clean,
attractive football from my captain...

479
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,669
starting next week
at the Charity Shield.

480
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:03,954
And you, Irishman.

481
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:09,367
God gave you skill, intelligence and
the best passing ability in the game.

482
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,819
What God did not give you
was 6 studs...

483
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,533
to wrap around
another player's knee.

484
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:19,844
Now, things are gonna be
a little different around here...

485
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:21,972
without Don.

486
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:23,697
Might feel strange at first.

487
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:26,464
Might pinch a little
like a new pair of shoes.

488
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:28,140
But...

489
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,032
if you want your grandchildren
to remember you...

490
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:34,315
as being something other than
the dirty buggers you once were...

491
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:38,092
If you wanna be loved
as real champions...

492
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:40,450
worthy champions...

493
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:44,106
you're gonna have to work
and improve...

494
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,940
and change.

495
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:48,576
Now...

496
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:52,374
let's start off
by playing some 7- a - sides.

497
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,340
Mr. Revie never made us do that.

498
00:30:57,908 --> 00:31:00,547
Well, I'm not Mr. Revie.

499
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:03,582
From now on, I don't wanna hear
that name again ever.

500
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:07,188
Next player who mentions it or what
he did or didn't do in the old days...

501
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,877
will spend a week
cleaning my boots.

502
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:14,746
7- a - sides.
Keep it nice and clean. Hey.

503
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:18,186
And sensible. No 50I50s.

504
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:20,573
Right. I'll play meself.

505
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:23,013
You might learn something,
Irishman.

506
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:28,212
251 goals in 274 starts.

507
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:39,670
I'd like to see Don - fucking - Revie
do that, eh?

508
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,169
- First seven over here. Come on.
- There you go.

509
00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:44,311
- Hope he's ready.
- Come on, pal. Let's do it.

510
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:46,440
Yes, Irishman, I'll have it here!

511
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,408
I see nothing on, nothing on.

512
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,610
Back to you, back to you!
Go, lad, come on!

513
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:53,382
Billy will have it, Billy will have it!
Give it to Billy.

514
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:55,938
- Yes, come on, Billy. I'm free!
- Here, come on!

515
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:58,564
- Close him down, close him down!
- Come on.

516
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:00,402
- Get that. Come on.
- Come on.

517
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:04,245
Hey, 50I50, Norman.

518
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,709
You deaf or what?

519
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:07,128
- Jesus.
- Good tackle.

520
00:32:07,188 --> 00:32:10,347
What's the matter with you?
He said no 50I50s.

521
00:32:10,485 --> 00:32:13,604
- What are you gonna do? Book me?
- Yes, I will.

522
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,699
You're a bunch of fucking bullies.

523
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:17,864
It's a fair challenge, Norman.
Fair play.

524
00:32:17,955 --> 00:32:19,954
Up. Up.

525
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,201
Easy, easy.

526
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:23,051
Come on. 1, 2.
Pass and move.

527
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,586
- Okay?
- Yeah.

528
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:34,802
"251 goals in 274 starts."

529
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:37,464
- "Goals."
- "Goals."

530
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:39,850
He should've stayed
with Peter Taylor.

531
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,522
I've heard he's the one
with all the talent anyway.

532
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:47,451
Well, I'll tell you. He's no Don Revie.

533
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,167
Best team in the country, Leeds.

534
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:08,938
Best players. Best stadium.
Best backroom staff.

535
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,610
Best everything, really.

536
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:15,771
Right.

537
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:19,400
Last time, there was a whole division
between you and Leeds.

538
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:21,835
Not now. Not today.

539
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:24,814
Today we're here
as Second Division champions.

540
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:26,778
And equals with Leeds.

541
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:30,338
John McGovern and Billy Bremner,
equals.

542
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,489
- Kevin Hector and Johnny Giles.
- Equals.

543
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,139
Good lad. Equals.

544
00:33:35,206 --> 00:33:37,485
Alan Hinton and Peter Lorimer...

545
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:39,704
- equals
- Equals.

546
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,756
John O'Hare and Paul Madeley.

547
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:43,441
- Equals!
- Now, come on.

548
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:45,310
Chins up, chests out.

549
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:47,908
- We can take this lot. Come on!
- Come on!

550
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:49,458
Equals, yeah!

551
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:51,720
- Come on!
- Go! Get out there!

552
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:53,816
- Come on. Get it, lad!
- Come on!

553
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:56,519
- Come on, Leeds.
- Come on.

554
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,579
Well, it's an achievement for Derby,
being promoted to the First Division.

555
00:34:09,762 --> 00:34:11,881
But the truth is...

556
00:34:11,974 --> 00:34:14,373
Leeds United have the habit
of reminding them...

557
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:16,557
just how far they still have to go.

558
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:19,528
They made us look like fools today.

559
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:21,453
I mean, our boys...

560
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:23,251
What was O'Hare doing?

561
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:27,216
Letting Madeley bully him like that,
pushing him around.

562
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:31,003
Madeley's half his bloody size.

563
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:33,210
O'Hare needs to toughen up.

564
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:35,820
He's from the Scottish dockyards,
isn't he?

565
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,529
What about McGovern?
He was useless in the middle.

566
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,442
Whose idea was that?

567
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:42,420
Yours.

568
00:34:43,442 --> 00:34:45,481
Good lad.

569
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:47,650
He was all over the place.

570
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:49,380
Like the wandering Jew.

571
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:53,331
Giving the ball to anyone but his own.
We need a ball player.

572
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,899
A natural in midfield...

573
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:58,259
who can hold on to it,
keep possession.

574
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:01,640
Giving it away too easily.

575
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:04,705
Someone like...

576
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,345
Colin Todd.

577
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,886
Oh, now you're talking.

578
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:11,759
Lovely pair of feet.

579
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:15,527
I've heard he wants out
of Sunderland too.

580
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:18,914
They're all jumping ship up there.

581
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:21,255
Go on, sign him then.

582
00:35:21,337 --> 00:35:22,896
What?

583
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:24,444
We can't.

584
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:26,268
Longson's already told us.

585
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:28,677
" Club's in debt."

586
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,889
Having said that, Derby had moments.
They played some football.

587
00:35:32,021 --> 00:35:35,780
They were brief moments perhaps, but
they did play some football at times.

588
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:39,183
- But when you come up...
- Oh, bollocks to that!

589
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:41,764
I didn't get us
all the way to the First Division...

590
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:45,790
so we could sit there mid - table and
be cannon fodder for sides like Leeds.

591
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,160
Sign the man.

592
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,572
Hang on, hang on. Brian...

593
00:35:48,632 --> 00:35:52,391
I'll handle bloody Longson.

594
00:35:52,555 --> 00:35:55,914
Oh, you are a disgrace!

595
00:35:56,061 --> 00:36:00,220
For missing the target from there,
you want bloody shooting!

596
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:01,960
Now, get in there!

597
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,918
That's what I pay you for!

598
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,799
170 grand for Colin - fucking - Todd?

599
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,712
Correction,
"The Almighty" Colin Todd.

600
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,830
Best technical footballer
in the country.

601
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,119
And his salary's 300 quid a week?
We can't pay a footballer that.

602
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,498
That's the way things are going,
Uncle Sam.

603
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:19,515
Football's all about money now.

604
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,798
I told you never to go
over my head again.

605
00:36:21,894 --> 00:36:24,053
I had no choice.
Windows opened up.

606
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,667
You were in the bloody West Indies.

607
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:28,096
Windows?

608
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:32,034
- You mean, there are others?
- Messrs. Gemmill and Hennessey.

609
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:33,722
Oh, for fuck's sake.

610
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:35,548
Let me ask you a question,
Uncle Sam.

611
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,344
What'd you come into football for?

612
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,819
Support the football club
of my hometown.

613
00:36:39,924 --> 00:36:42,363
The club I've supported all my life.

614
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,709
Well, I'm sure
we all admire your loyalty.

615
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:48,806
I didn't come to be lectured by some
cocky little twat from the North East.

616
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,579
The way I see it,
there's no point being in this game...

617
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:53,492
unless you want to beat the best.

618
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:54,770
And be the best.

619
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:56,662
That's all the people of Derby want.

620
00:36:56,743 --> 00:36:58,902
If you really
have their interest at heart...

621
00:36:58,996 --> 00:37:01,555
Not just impressing your friends
in the director's box.

622
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,706
...I suggest you keep your eyes
on your road haulage business.

623
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,558
Keep your opinions to yourself and
start signing some fucking cheques.

624
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:09,960
There's a good lad.

625
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:13,053
Leave the running of this football club
to the professionals.

626
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:15,985
Well, professionals
don't run the football club, Brian.

627
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,867
The chairman does.

628
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,223
If it's true football is all about money,
that's the way it's going...

629
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:24,965
well, that suits us chairmen
just fucking fine.

630
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:27,692
Because we're the ones
who've got it.

631
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:30,994
- Come on, to feet!
- Okay, come on. Do it.

632
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,129
That's it, lads!

633
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:35,630
Frighten the shit out of them.

634
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:38,604
Now, what was it last time?
5- nothing. Was it 5- nil?

635
00:37:38,728 --> 00:37:40,607
We'll hit double figures this time.

636
00:37:40,689 --> 00:37:44,568
- I'm taking the first penalty.
- It should be a smash - and - grab event.

637
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:48,217
I see they've driven all the way
into the car park this time.

638
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:51,144
Isn't a Cup game, is it?

639
00:37:51,707 --> 00:37:53,640
Tosser.

640
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:00,017
Hey, shut up, shut up. Come on.

641
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:02,017
All right. Right.

642
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,058
He's coming.

643
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:07,143
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

644
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:08,953
Come on, Derby!

645
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:12,106
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

646
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:15,120
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

647
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:18,465
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

648
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:44,793
- You know what your job is today?
- Yes, boss.

649
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:47,678
Stay in position. Keep the shape.

650
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:49,358
Stop being the wandering Jew.

651
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:50,825
Good lad.

652
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:53,326
Enjoy it. You deserve to.

653
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:56,447
You've worked hard. This week.

654
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:25,453
Do you know
what you're doing today?

655
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:27,487
Be big, be strong.

656
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:29,051
Any chance I get...

657
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,915
- flatten Paul - fucking - Madeley.
- Good lad.

658
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:36,325
He bullies you, you bully him back.

659
00:39:39,174 --> 00:39:42,188
- Near post those corners we worked on.
- Yes, boss.

660
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:46,905
Now...

661
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:52,890
come on!

662
00:39:52,946 --> 00:39:54,595
Come on, Derby!

663
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,672
Come on!

664
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,907
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

665
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:16,340
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

666
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:19,084
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

667
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:21,369
Come on, Derby!

668
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,169
And?

669
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:13,632
2- 1.

670
00:42:15,428 --> 00:42:17,627
You clever, clever, clever bastard.

671
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:19,523
You should've seen O'Hare's first.

672
00:42:19,602 --> 00:42:21,521
Turned Bremner inside out.
Beautiful.

673
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:22,804
I tell you what, Brian.

674
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:25,256
If we can beat this lot,
we could go all the way.

675
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:28,216
Oh, yeah!

676
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,598
And back again,
John Radford with him.

677
00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:34,925
O¡¦Hare!

678
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:37,403
Ceaseless Derby pressure.

679
00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:39,917
McGovern! Oh, yes!

680
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:43,416
How'd you define
your approach to management...

681
00:42:43,516 --> 00:42:46,246
apart from being brilliant?

682
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,589
- Good lad.
- 2 in the middle. O¡¦Hare!

683
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:53,935
How do you react when someone
says, "Boss, you're doing it wrong"?

684
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:57,794
Well, I ask him how he thinks
it ought to be done.

685
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:01,955
And then we get down to it
and we talk about it for 20 minutes.

686
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,780
And then we decide that I was right.

687
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,899
O¡¦Hare!

688
00:43:07,972 --> 00:43:11,411
And with that, Derby County
are the champions of England!

689
00:43:11,562 --> 00:43:14,622
It's an extraordinary story.

690
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:19,125
I wouldn't say I was the best manager
in the country.

691
00:43:19,282 --> 00:43:20,976
But I'm in the top one.

692
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:29,924
Some fella in London, England,
named... Some Brian...

693
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:31,411
Brian Clough.

694
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:34,428
I heard all the way in America
that this fella talks too much.

695
00:43:34,557 --> 00:43:37,676
They say he's another Muhammad Ali.
There's just one Muhammad Ali.

696
00:43:37,813 --> 00:43:39,892
Now, Clough, I've had enough.
Stop it.

697
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:44,032
- Are you gonna stop it?
- No, I'm going to fight him.

698
00:44:02,144 --> 00:44:04,343
The twin towers
of Wembley Stadium.

699
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:06,758
The cathedral of English football.

700
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,699
Good afternoon, everyone.
It's the Charity Shield.

701
00:44:09,823 --> 00:44:12,782
The opening Saturday
of the 1974 season.

702
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,110
And our first chance
to get a look at Leeds...

703
00:44:15,207 --> 00:44:17,926
under their new manager,
Brian Clough.

704
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:21,164
- Will you be supporting Leeds today?
- You'll expect nothing less...

705
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,219
having been the manager
for 13 years.

706
00:44:23,303 --> 00:44:25,262
Fact is, I'm here today
as England manager.

707
00:44:25,348 --> 00:44:28,867
Any words of advice for your
successor before his first game?

708
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:30,260
Win.

709
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:32,234
The people of Leeds
are used to winning.

710
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:34,251
- Thanks, Dave.
- Thanks, Don.

711
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:41,972
Right.

712
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,896
Right, gentlemen, thank you!

713
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:51,222
Team today is Harvey in goal.

714
00:44:52,434 --> 00:44:55,313
Reaney, Cherry, Bremner.

715
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:57,118
My captain.

716
00:44:57,192 --> 00:45:00,311
McQueen, Hunter, Lorimer, Clarke.

717
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,646
Jordan, Giles and Gray.

718
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:09,679
Obviously, all eyes will be on us
to see how things have changed.

719
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,268
Without Don.

720
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:15,489
What might be different under me.

721
00:45:15,806 --> 00:45:19,503
Let's show them some of the things
we've been working on.

722
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:22,780
Our changes in attitude...

723
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:24,890
to a new outlook.

724
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,220
New discipline.

725
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,536
New approach.

726
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:35,642
Let's see some of you playing
with a smile.

727
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,659
There on his right, the man
who takes over from Don Revie...

728
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:49,693
Brian Clough, who has one
championship to his credit...

729
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:51,178
with Derby County.

730
00:45:51,238 --> 00:45:54,957
Brian Clough,
starting I suppose at the top.

731
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,293
Not a bad way to open your account
with your new team at Wembley.

732
00:46:54,884 --> 00:46:56,883
Oh, beautifully played, Keegan.

733
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,969
Got to hit it now.

734
00:46:59,057 --> 00:47:01,832
There's a chance on here
and it's block ed.

735
00:47:03,105 --> 00:47:05,721
Boersma's shot.

736
00:47:09,115 --> 00:47:13,394
And that look ed very much
like a right hook by Johnny Giles.

737
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:14,780
That was shocking.

738
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,752
Keegan has been poleaxed
and it was a right hook.

739
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:19,918
That's a terrible foul.

740
00:47:20,008 --> 00:47:22,047
A minute afterwards,
watch as Bremner...

741
00:47:22,136 --> 00:47:24,095
appears to pat him
with his left hand.

742
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:26,740
That right hand in the kidneys.

743
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:30,291
And then down on the floor,
for no reason whatsoever.

744
00:47:30,442 --> 00:47:34,981
And Keegan's gonna get his little bit
of revenge there with a right cross.

745
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:38,732
Surely, we've got to get away
from this.

746
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:41,591
And Kevin Keegan,
having words with the referee.

747
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,709
It rather looks as though the referee
has taken stronger action.

748
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,377
Bremner is off,
and he's absolutely livid about it.

749
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:50,830
For fuck's sake.

750
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:53,050
They're both throwing
their shirts down.

751
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:55,944
And really,
this is a side of English football...

752
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:58,797
a face of English football
we do not want to see.

753
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:03,062
To dismiss the referee's authority
in such a manner...

754
00:48:03,203 --> 00:48:05,773
cannot be good for the game.

755
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,570
So the Cup winners...

756
00:48:09,672 --> 00:48:12,925
beat the League champions.

757
00:48:16,016 --> 00:48:17,665
William Bremner...

758
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:22,095
your conduct in the Charity Shield
match was deplorable...

759
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:25,006
and cannot be tolerated.

760
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:28,236
We understand Leeds United
are taking disciplinary action...

761
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:30,048
against you internally.

762
00:48:30,122 --> 00:48:34,921
However, the Football Association
has to be seen to make an example.

763
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,969
We have therefore decided
to impose a fine of 500 pounds.

764
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:40,496
Thank you.

765
00:48:40,556 --> 00:48:45,235
And a suspension
until September the 30th.

766
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:47,691
What?

767
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:50,063
September 30th?
That's over a month.

768
00:48:50,155 --> 00:48:51,914
That's 6 bloody weeks.

769
00:48:51,991 --> 00:48:55,085
I'll make it 7 if you carry on
with language like that.

770
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:58,833
Come on. Double the fine.
Treble it. Anything.

771
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:01,850
Just don't suspend him for that long.

772
00:49:02,216 --> 00:49:04,229
Gentlemen.

773
00:49:06,223 --> 00:49:08,222
He's my captain.

774
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:11,528
Hey, he's the best player I've got.

775
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:28,981
Hello?

776
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:31,428
I suppose you've heard.

777
00:49:32,474 --> 00:49:36,683
Suspended for 11 bloody games.

778
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:39,533
Well, you're buggered.

779
00:49:39,735 --> 00:49:42,534
Billy Bremner's the heart and soul
of that team.

780
00:49:42,657 --> 00:49:46,149
Plus, Mick Jones
and Eddie Gray are injured.

781
00:49:46,455 --> 00:49:50,014
Well, like I said, you're buggered.

782
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:52,500
What do I do, Pete?

783
00:49:53,383 --> 00:49:55,999
I need new players.

784
00:49:57,181 --> 00:49:59,478
Tell me who to buy.

785
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:02,063
No, Brian.

786
00:50:02,147 --> 00:50:06,401
No one scouts players like you, Pete.
You're the best.

787
00:50:06,613 --> 00:50:10,185
We can sort this place out together.

788
00:50:12,372 --> 00:50:14,828
You and me.

789
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:19,522
Turn it around.

790
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:22,826
It's too late, Brian.

791
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:26,317
I'd have helped you once,
but not now.

792
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:29,014
Not after what was said.

793
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:32,881
We're on our own now, remember?

794
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,650
Each man for himself?

795
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:41,208
And I think it would be better
if you don't ring here again.

796
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,329
These are heady days for
Brian Clough's Derby County...

797
00:51:01,452 --> 00:51:02,811
champions of England.

798
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:06,470
They have the biggest night in
the club's history coming up in Turin...

799
00:51:06,627 --> 00:51:08,386
in only 4 days' time.

800
00:51:08,463 --> 00:51:12,102
The semi - final of the European Cup
against Juventus.

801
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:15,060
But first today,
they've got quite a tricky challenge.

802
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:17,502
They face Leeds United
whom they unseated...

803
00:51:17,603 --> 00:51:20,922
as the First Division champions
at the end of last season.

804
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:24,798
Leeds, one would imagine,
will have revenge on their mind.

805
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:27,800
Get me today's team sheet,
could you, Joe?

806
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:30,991
There's always been a strong,
some might say unhealthy...

807
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:33,564
rivalry between the 2 teams...

808
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:35,350
and the managers in particular.

809
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:38,943
It's well known there's no love lost
between Don Revie and Brian Clough...

810
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,951
What's up, Uncle Sam?

811
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:45,201
A bit below stairs
for you here, isn't it?

812
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:47,806
Taken a wrong turn somewhere?

813
00:51:48,278 --> 00:51:49,477
Just seen the team sheet.

814
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,169
Hinton, O'Hare, Todd, Mackay,
that's our strongest side.

815
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:54,764
Of course it's our strongest side,
it's Leeds United.

816
00:51:54,872 --> 00:51:56,871
Would you prefer I send out
the apprentices?

817
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:59,998
We're at Juventus midweek,
semi - final of the European Cup.

818
00:52:00,131 --> 00:52:03,623
Biggest night in the club's history.
Couldn't you field...?

819
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:05,910
What?

820
00:52:05,974 --> 00:52:07,873
You know.

821
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:10,919
A weaker side?

822
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:14,353
Am I hearing right?
Is the chairman of this football club...

823
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:17,406
seriously asking his manager
to lose?

824
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:18,933
You know what I'm saying.

825
00:52:18,995 --> 00:52:22,034
Against their biggest rivals?

826
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,486
The chairman of this football club...

827
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:27,546
is asking his manager
to be pragmatic...

828
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:29,435
and manage his resources.

829
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:33,191
Prioritise. We've just embarked
on a huge programme of refurbishment.

830
00:52:33,352 --> 00:52:36,471
Improvement. New stand.
Better floodlights.

831
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:39,223
We need a good run in Europe
to pay for it.

832
00:52:42,116 --> 00:52:46,814
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear a word of this.

833
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:51,003
You've still got an hour
before kick - off.

834
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:54,568
I'd reconsider if I were you. I wouldn't
want my employer to be unhappy.

835
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,778
My employer?

836
00:52:57,224 --> 00:53:01,512
Chairman of Derby County. Chairman
long before you ever showed up.

837
00:53:01,731 --> 00:53:03,490
Oh, that's right.

838
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:07,686
You were chairman of Derby County
before I came here.

839
00:53:07,866 --> 00:53:09,025
I remember that.

840
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:13,235
When Derby County were at the
fucking foot of the Second Division.

841
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:15,696
When nobody had heard of them
for 20 years...

842
00:53:15,796 --> 00:53:19,115
and nobody had heard
of Sam - bloody - Longson ever.

843
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,819
Full stop. And that's where you'd
still fucking be if it wasn't for me.

844
00:53:24,017 --> 00:53:26,096
At the foot
of the bloody Second Division...

845
00:53:26,188 --> 00:53:27,867
where nobody remembered you...

846
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,539
and nobody had heard of you.

847
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:32,305
There would be no Derby County
without me.

848
00:53:32,615 --> 00:53:34,094
No League title.

849
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,718
No champions of England.

850
00:53:35,787 --> 00:53:39,404
Not without Brian Clough.

851
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:43,025
I'm gonna give you some good advice,
Brian Clough.

852
00:53:43,174 --> 00:53:45,773
No matter how good you think you are
or how clever...

853
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:48,445
how many fancy new friends
you make on the telly...

854
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:51,996
the reality of footballing life is this:

855
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:55,426
The chairman is the boss,
then comes the directors...

856
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:58,928
then the secretary, then the fans,
then the players...

857
00:53:59,074 --> 00:54:01,233
and then finally, last of all...

858
00:54:01,328 --> 00:54:03,527
bottom of the heap,
the lowest of the low...

859
00:54:03,624 --> 00:54:06,583
comes the one, who in the end,
we can all do without...

860
00:54:06,712 --> 00:54:09,521
the fucking manager.

861
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:17,553
What are you doing, Brian?

862
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:28,632
You are a bloody disgrace!

863
00:54:28,748 --> 00:54:32,027
Hey, Bremner, you should be
in the bloody book for that!

864
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,230
- Come on.
- Look at this!

865
00:54:47,069 --> 00:54:50,447
Fucking come on then, you bastard!

866
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:53,866
You see what your lads are doing?

867
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:56,924
They don't deserve to be
on the same pitch as my lads.

868
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,142
Brian.

869
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:07,446
Good luck in Europe.

870
00:55:08,062 --> 00:55:10,996
Peter, good luck in Europe.

871
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,094
You fucking knobheads.

872
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:19,548
Derby was unlucky, I can tell you.

873
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:35,320
You bloody fool.

874
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:50,086
- Are you disappointed, Mr. Clough?
- Disappointed, not a bit.

875
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:52,466
My players
were heroic out there tonight.

876
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:57,188
Effectively, we were playing the Italian
champions with a reserve team.

877
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,989
Many of my first team are injured
thanks to the brutality of Leeds United.

878
00:56:01,148 --> 00:56:03,227
This happens
when you have a chairman...

879
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,317
who authorises a multi - million - pound
refurbishment of the Directors' Box...

880
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:11,051
and hospitality suites before
he pays for a proper squad.

881
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:14,245
It depends on your priorities,
players or prawn sandwiches.

882
00:56:14,378 --> 00:56:15,817
I know which I'd prefer.

883
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:21,296
I know which honest working- class
Derby supporters would prefer too.

884
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:25,883
What I am say...

885
00:56:26,022 --> 00:56:30,356
We're taking you into hospital
now, love. Don't worry, okay?

886
00:56:32,241 --> 00:56:33,890
Heart attack, eh?

887
00:56:36,748 --> 00:56:40,638
Been having it for 3 weeks,
they reckon, one way or another.

888
00:56:42,424 --> 00:56:44,423
They ran all sorts of tests on me.

889
00:56:44,511 --> 00:56:46,710
I told them the only thing
they need to know...

890
00:56:46,806 --> 00:56:50,059
was that I share my professional
life with Brian Clough.

891
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:53,997
That seemed to satisfy them.

892
00:56:57,073 --> 00:56:59,848
I'm only half joking, you know.

893
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:08,043
- We still got jobs?
- We have.

894
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:12,072
Longson has tried to put
a gagging order on me, of course.

895
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:15,028
"Any further utterances in public...

896
00:57:15,144 --> 00:57:17,343
or media appearances
by Brian Clough...

897
00:57:17,439 --> 00:57:19,358
will be met with instant dismissal."

898
00:57:19,442 --> 00:57:21,121
Take notice and act accordingly.

899
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:24,234
Would you like to hear
my contrite reply?

900
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:27,006
- Go on, then.
- Written a letter to the board.

901
00:57:27,122 --> 00:57:30,601
You and I feel it is impossible
to continue our good work...

902
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:31,912
with Derby County.

903
00:57:31,963 --> 00:57:37,059
We therefore wish to tender our
resignations with immediate effect.

904
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,539
What?

905
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,579
What do you think?

906
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,369
I don't want to resign.

907
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:47,641
Don't worry, they won't let us.
We just won them the Championship.

908
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,499
But it'll strengthen our position
and force them to get rid of Longson.

909
00:57:51,662 --> 00:57:53,141
Oh, no.

910
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:56,805
No, Brian, they'll never do that.
He's chairman...

911
00:57:56,962 --> 00:57:58,281
Look, I can't do it, Pete.

912
00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:00,698
I can't work with me hands tied.

913
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:04,099
A chairman telling me
what I can and can't do?

914
00:58:04,558 --> 00:58:07,253
You're picking the wrong enemy,
Brian.

915
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:10,088
The enemy's not Longson.

916
00:58:10,192 --> 00:58:11,871
It's Revie.

917
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:13,904
And this obsession with Leeds.

918
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,109
Don't be daft.

919
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,401
We won the league, Pete.

920
00:58:17,454 --> 00:58:20,013
We're top dogs in Derby now,
Longson can't stand it.

921
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:22,284
- That's the problem.
- No, it's not. It's you.

922
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:25,217
This mad ambition.

923
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:26,780
It comes and it goes.

924
00:58:26,844 --> 00:58:28,843
Sometimes it's good. Oh, yes.

925
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:32,090
Like a fire that stirs everything up.

926
00:58:32,228 --> 00:58:35,387
Then there's this.
This thing that takes over.

927
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:38,459
Destroys everything
that's good in your life.

928
00:58:43,913 --> 00:58:46,051
Please, Brian.

929
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:50,289
Please tell me that this letter
is just a draught.

930
00:58:50,424 --> 00:58:52,596
You've not sent it.

931
00:58:53,178 --> 00:58:55,737
I'll be out in a couple of days.

932
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:58,180
Let me talk to them.

933
00:59:02,235 --> 00:59:04,194
You'll all get the chance to say...

934
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,359
...whatever it is you want to say
in due course...

935
00:59:07,493 --> 00:59:08,972
What are you doing?

936
00:59:09,038 --> 00:59:12,037
You weren't supposed to accept
our resignations.

937
00:59:12,168 --> 00:59:15,207
Shouldn't bloody well offer them,
then, should you?

938
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,179
Look, you can't get rid of us.
It'd be a disaster for the club.

939
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:21,065
For the whole of Derby.

940
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:24,060
You can't keep shooting your mouth
off the way you have been...

941
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:26,986
and issuing these ultimatums.

942
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:28,988
With great reluctance...

943
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,229
your resignations
have been accepted.

944
00:59:31,324 --> 00:59:34,338
Look, you can't do this.

945
00:59:34,496 --> 00:59:37,575
- It's madness.
- The decision stands.

946
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:41,148
Car keys on the table and out.

947
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:44,618
We're gonna create
a footballing dynasty here.

948
00:59:44,762 --> 00:59:47,121
Derby could be one of the greats.

949
00:59:47,225 --> 00:59:49,864
Alongside United, Liverpool, Leeds.

950
00:59:49,979 --> 00:59:51,878
Now!

951
00:59:52,483 --> 00:59:55,702
And don't dare
show your face here again.

952
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:15,110
We've just heard that the controversial
former manager...

953
01:00:15,229 --> 01:00:17,868
of First Division Derby County,
Brian Clough...

954
01:00:17,983 --> 01:00:20,542
has been sack ed with his assistant,
Peter Taylor.

955
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:23,653
The drama at Derby started
in the streets outside the ground...

956
01:00:23,784 --> 01:00:25,183
just before kick - off.

957
01:00:25,245 --> 01:00:27,576
3 quarters of an hour
before the match.

958
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,757
And there
in the stand is Brian Clough.

959
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:32,678
And listen to the crowd.

960
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:35,556
We want Clough!
We want Clough!

961
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:38,958
The chairman there answering
the catcalls of the Derby crowd.

962
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:41,460
A big mouth,
but he's a good manager.

963
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:43,722
We don't want to lose him
and we bloody lost.

964
01:00:43,817 --> 01:00:46,376
He might show off a bit sometimes,
but he's brilliant.

965
01:00:46,488 --> 01:00:49,167
- He brought this team up.
- Nobody on this world to touch him.

966
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:51,083
- I think it's terrible.
- You think...?

967
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:53,698
Yeah. The club will come to an end,
I think.

968
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:58,011
Derby County players have officially
now joined the protest...

969
01:00:58,174 --> 01:01:00,453
against the sacking
of manager Brian Clough.

970
01:01:00,553 --> 01:01:03,072
- Off to bed.
- The plotting's been done in black out...

971
01:01:03,182 --> 01:01:07,072
as the power cuts put in force by
Prime Minister Edward Heath continue.

972
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:08,671
Quiet, quiet.

973
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:12,509
"To the directors
of Derby County Football Club.

974
01:01:12,906 --> 01:01:15,825
We, the undersigned players,
are unanimous...

975
01:01:15,953 --> 01:01:19,092
in our support and respect
for Mr. Clough...

976
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:20,852
and Mr. Taylor.

977
01:01:20,919 --> 01:01:23,038
And ask that they be reinstated...

978
01:01:23,131 --> 01:01:25,650
as manager and assistant manager
with the club."

979
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,839
- Yeah.
- "Signed by... Signed by:

980
01:01:28,974 --> 01:01:34,653
John O' Hare, Roy McFarland,
Colin Todd, Kevin Hector.

981
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,710
- Alan Hinton..."
- But not Dave Mackay.

982
01:01:42,287 --> 01:01:44,646
Who's just accepted the job.

983
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,189
What?

984
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:48,411
Dave Mackay?

985
01:01:48,506 --> 01:01:50,345
It's in the evening paper.

986
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:53,224
I signed that fat fuck.

987
01:01:53,347 --> 01:01:56,786
Saved his professional life,
gave him 2 years as a player.

988
01:01:56,936 --> 01:02:00,428
Dave Mackay.
He wouldn't fucking dare.

989
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:08,779
What have you done, Brian?

990
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,338
I love this place.

991
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:14,671
I'm happy here.

992
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:16,656
So were you.

993
01:02:18,805 --> 01:02:20,404
It's not over yet, Pete.

994
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:23,353
Lawyers are issuing a writ tomorrow
against Longson.

995
01:02:23,479 --> 01:02:26,878
The players have called a meeting.
There's talk they're going on strike.

996
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:29,546
There's protest marches
arranged for this weekend.

997
01:02:29,656 --> 01:02:31,495
Why didn't you keep
your mouth shut?

998
01:02:31,576 --> 01:02:33,095
Hello, Derby - 220.

999
01:02:33,162 --> 01:02:36,401
We're never gonna find
another place like this again.

1000
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:39,158
Brian, it's Mike Bamber
on the phone.

1001
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,713
- Who's Mike Bamber?
- I don't know.

1002
01:02:43,846 --> 01:02:47,179
Chairman of Brighton
and Hove Albion.

1003
01:03:00,164 --> 01:03:01,323
Good. This way.

1004
01:03:01,374 --> 01:03:02,853
Big smiles, lads.

1005
01:03:02,919 --> 01:03:04,958
The Johns are back in town, eh?

1006
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,486
I've known this one since he was 16.

1007
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:10,527
This one just plays like he's 16.

1008
01:03:10,806 --> 01:03:13,565
- Are you gonna buy any more...?
- This one, Duncan McKenzie.

1009
01:03:13,686 --> 01:03:15,685
Take your hands
out of your pockets, son.

1010
01:03:15,773 --> 01:03:19,052
Remember that name,
28 goals last season.

1011
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,474
How many are you gonna get
this year?

1012
01:03:21,574 --> 01:03:23,173
Just more than 28, really.

1013
01:03:23,243 --> 01:03:25,362
Yeah. That's why I got you.

1014
01:03:25,455 --> 01:03:28,374
Not for your quick wits,
for your quick boots.

1015
01:03:28,502 --> 01:03:31,781
I think I scored 28 goals
in one game once.

1016
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:33,403
But they're gonna do the job.

1017
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:36,766
They'll be the saviours
of Leeds United, this lot.

1018
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:44,124
Lads.

1019
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:46,852
What you buy them for?

1020
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,308
A little poof and a pair of reserves.

1021
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:51,290
Waste of bloody money.

1022
01:03:51,372 --> 01:03:54,731
Duncan McKenzie scored 28 goals
last season.

1023
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:58,557
John O'Hare and John McGovern
are both internationals.

1024
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,517
We've got 2 strikers.
Allan Clarke and Mick Jones.

1025
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:02,998
They're internationals too.

1026
01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:06,537
Yeah, one's injured
and the other suspended.

1027
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:09,248
If you spent a bit more time
on the training ground...

1028
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,919
you wouldn't have to waste money
buying Derby rejects.

1029
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,030
I mean, we have a game on Saturday,
against QPR.

1030
01:04:15,161 --> 01:04:16,640
Or had you forgotten?

1031
01:04:16,705 --> 01:04:18,304
No, I hadn't forgotten.

1032
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:23,346
Well, you haven't told us a single
thing about how QPR are gonna play.

1033
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:26,890
Mr. Revie would've had files
and dossiers prepared.

1034
01:04:27,014 --> 01:04:29,013
Had the reserves
playing the Rangers' way.

1035
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:30,700
The first team looking out
for this and that.

1036
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:33,989
Bollocks to Don Revie!

1037
01:04:37,364 --> 01:04:39,923
You're professional footballers.

1038
01:04:40,035 --> 01:04:41,674
Stop Stan Bowles.

1039
01:04:41,746 --> 01:04:44,665
That's all you need to know
about QPR.

1040
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:47,792
And I don't have to justify myself
to you...

1041
01:04:47,923 --> 01:04:51,082
...not how or when
I conduct training...

1042
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,899
not who I buy or pick to play.

1043
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,819
No.

1044
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:59,148
No, not to us.

1045
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,799
But come Saturday afternoon,
there'll be 40,000 people out there...

1046
01:05:03,991 --> 01:05:07,210
who you do have to
justify yourself to.

1047
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:48,568
- Hello?
- You must be loving this.

1048
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:50,969
Loving every minute.

1049
01:05:51,067 --> 01:05:52,426
Who is this?

1050
01:05:52,486 --> 01:05:55,285
Watching it all fall apart.
It's Brian Clough.

1051
01:05:55,408 --> 01:05:57,007
What?

1052
01:05:57,077 --> 01:05:59,796
They won't play for me.

1053
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:02,354
Your boys.

1054
01:06:02,461 --> 01:06:05,395
Your bastard sons.

1055
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:07,390
And never will.

1056
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:09,748
What are you talking about?

1057
01:06:09,848 --> 01:06:11,417
It's...

1058
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:14,207
It's 2:00 in the morning.

1059
01:06:14,314 --> 01:06:15,993
Why are you ringing here?

1060
01:06:16,066 --> 01:06:20,185
They're loyal to you.
Thought you might like to know that.

1061
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:23,164
Loyal to big daddy Don.

1062
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:26,206
For God's sake, go to sleep, man.

1063
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,652
Where's your dignity?

1064
01:06:28,754 --> 01:06:31,404
And don't ring here again.

1065
01:07:35,487 --> 01:07:37,726
Look, the pub's just down there.
Not far to go.

1066
01:07:37,825 --> 01:07:40,544
- No, no.
- Just down there.

1067
01:07:40,663 --> 01:07:43,702
Oh, I don't like to be
Beside the seaside

1068
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:46,233
Hey, give it a chance.

1069
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:48,737
Brighton and Hove Albion?

1070
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:51,562
Have you seen where they are?
Bottom of the Third Division.

1071
01:07:51,681 --> 01:07:53,640
We can get them
out of there like that.

1072
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:55,645
We did it with Hartlepools,
with Derby.

1073
01:07:55,729 --> 01:07:59,408
We cared about Hartlepools
and Derby. We're from the North, Pete.

1074
01:07:59,568 --> 01:08:02,207
What do we care about Brighton?

1075
01:08:02,323 --> 01:08:03,962
Bloody Southerners.

1076
01:08:04,034 --> 01:08:05,273
Look where we are.

1077
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:07,527
- We're almost in France.
- Hey.

1078
01:08:07,623 --> 01:08:10,302
They've got money, this lot.
And ambition.

1079
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:13,418
Get a lungful of that air, eh?
Be good for me health.

1080
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:16,148
You can't manage a team
that's not your own people.

1081
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:18,061
Not what you know.

1082
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,979
Anyway, the protest movement
in Derby is still in full flow.

1083
01:08:21,103 --> 01:08:24,993
- We can still get our jobs back.
- No, we won't.

1084
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,134
It's over, Brian.

1085
01:08:27,823 --> 01:08:30,342
It's over, mate.
They're never gonna take us back.

1086
01:08:30,452 --> 01:08:32,510
Not now.

1087
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,280
Come on.

1088
01:08:40,635 --> 01:08:45,434
Sign today,
and I'll give you a bonus of 7 grand.

1089
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:46,962
Each.

1090
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:49,180
7 grand?

1091
01:08:49,274 --> 01:08:51,273
You hear that, Brian?

1092
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:54,534
Plus, a salary that exceeds by 20%

1093
01:08:54,783 --> 01:08:56,862
what Derby were paying you.

1094
01:08:56,953 --> 01:08:59,672
Very generous, Mike.

1095
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:00,950
Terrific.

1096
01:09:01,002 --> 01:09:03,572
But those are First Division wages.

1097
01:09:03,715 --> 01:09:06,514
First Division
is where I want this club to be.

1098
01:09:06,636 --> 01:09:09,206
You sure you can afford it?

1099
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:11,805
You sure you're worth it?

1100
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:15,323
Cheeky sod.

1101
01:09:18,155 --> 01:09:21,034
- We're gonna need a holiday first.
- Take as long as you like.

1102
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,959
2 weeks, somewhere hot, on you.

1103
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:27,175
I'll even throw in the bloody trunks.

1104
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:38,568
Right.

1105
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:58,108
Hey, come on. You get over there.

1106
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,130
Come on. Champions of the world.

1107
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,633
Peter. Hi.

1108
01:10:19,046 --> 01:10:20,774
Brian!

1109
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,325
Come on.

1110
01:11:08,835 --> 01:11:12,168
You're a hard man to find,
Mr. Clough.

1111
01:11:13,384 --> 01:11:15,263
Who's looking?

1112
01:11:15,346 --> 01:11:16,625
Keith Archer.

1113
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:20,651
I'm secretary
of Leeds United Football Club.

1114
01:11:23,275 --> 01:11:25,354
- Nigel, come on.
- Let me have a go.

1115
01:11:25,445 --> 01:11:28,044
I wanna have a go.

1116
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,997
I was sent by my chairman,
Mr. Cussins.

1117
01:11:32,165 --> 01:11:36,021
He wants me to speak to you
face - to - face.

1118
01:11:37,048 --> 01:11:39,220
Bloody hell.

1119
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,239
But we hate Leeds.

1120
01:11:41,304 --> 01:11:43,863
It's the top flight, Pete.
It's the First Division.

1121
01:11:43,976 --> 01:11:47,215
But we gave Brighton our word.
And they paid us the money.

1122
01:11:47,356 --> 01:11:49,195
We can give back the money.

1123
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:51,435
Bollocks to bloody Brighton.

1124
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:54,248
I'd go mad.
We'd all go mad down there.

1125
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,566
- Mike Bamber's a good man.
- Oh, do me a favour.

1126
01:11:57,706 --> 01:12:01,305
Look, he had faith in us. He offered
us a job when no one else would.

1127
01:12:01,462 --> 01:12:05,261
He offered us a job. Now someone
else has offered us a better one.

1128
01:12:05,427 --> 01:12:08,386
And not just anyone,
the best team in the country.

1129
01:12:08,515 --> 01:12:10,194
Come on, Pete.

1130
01:12:10,268 --> 01:12:13,027
That means it'd be
the Charity Shield at Wembley...

1131
01:12:13,148 --> 01:12:14,587
...in a month's time.

1132
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:16,769
You know, European Cup after.

1133
01:12:16,862 --> 01:12:19,621
But even if we won them,
they'd be Revie's achievements.

1134
01:12:19,742 --> 01:12:21,834
His team.

1135
01:12:22,956 --> 01:12:26,035
No, I gave Brighton my word, Brian.
I can't do it.

1136
01:12:26,169 --> 01:12:30,328
What? And you'd sooner fester down
there with all those bloody Tories...

1137
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:32,989
...in that blue - rinse
retirement home by the sea?

1138
01:12:33,097 --> 01:12:35,176
Brighton's a small club,
I'll give you that.

1139
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,546
- Bloody midgets.
- But at least we'd be together.

1140
01:12:37,646 --> 01:12:39,005
You and me, Brian.

1141
01:12:39,065 --> 01:12:40,584
We can build them up.

1142
01:12:40,651 --> 01:12:43,770
Make them our own.
Like we did with Hartlepools, Derby...

1143
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:46,385
Then? Bottle again soon
as it comes to the big time?

1144
01:12:46,494 --> 01:12:48,773
That's always been the trouble
with you, Pete.

1145
01:12:48,873 --> 01:12:50,408
No ambition.

1146
01:12:51,293 --> 01:12:53,892
That's the trouble with you, Brian.

1147
01:12:54,006 --> 01:12:55,725
Too much ambition.

1148
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:58,240
- Too much greed, everything.
- Yeah, you knock it.

1149
01:12:58,347 --> 01:13:00,906
But it's done you proud
over the years, my ambition?

1150
01:13:01,018 --> 01:13:03,577
Without me, you'd still be
in Burton - bloody - Albion.

1151
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:07,147
Yes, and without you,
I'd still have a job in Derby.

1152
01:13:07,612 --> 01:13:10,571
A job and a home that I love.

1153
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,739
Oh, yes. You're the shop window.

1154
01:13:13,872 --> 01:13:16,551
I grant you that.
The razzle and the bloody dazzle.

1155
01:13:16,668 --> 01:13:18,442
But I'm the goods in the back!

1156
01:13:19,047 --> 01:13:20,326
And without me...

1157
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:23,862
...without somebody to save you
from yourself, Brian - fucking - Clough...

1158
01:13:24,013 --> 01:13:25,532
...you're not just half!

1159
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:28,118
- You're nothing!
- I'm nothing?

1160
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:30,068
I'm nothing? Don't make me laugh.

1161
01:13:30,148 --> 01:13:32,827
What does that make you then,
Taylor? Something?

1162
01:13:32,945 --> 01:13:34,744
You're half of nothing.

1163
01:13:34,823 --> 01:13:36,382
Nothing's parasite.

1164
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:39,908
A big fat pilot fish
that feeds on nothing.

1165
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:42,491
A bloody nobody!

1166
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:44,624
The forgotten man!

1167
01:13:44,714 --> 01:13:48,524
History's fucking afterthought!

1168
01:14:02,618 --> 01:14:05,497
Boos here at Elland Road
for manager Brian Clough...

1169
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:07,342
which I'm sure won't worry him.

1170
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:10,909
Also boos for John McGovern.
Never nice to see a crowd get a player.

1171
01:14:13,177 --> 01:14:16,456
That will worry Brian Clough.
It takes time to settle into a new club.

1172
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:20,409
It's not McGovern's fault
that Billy Bremner is missing.

1173
01:14:30,246 --> 01:14:31,974
One Don Revie

1174
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:37,974
There's only one Don Revie
One Don Revie

1175
01:14:38,218 --> 01:14:43,617
There's only one Don Revie
One Don Revie

1176
01:14:43,852 --> 01:14:46,571
One Don Revie

1177
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,369
There's only one Don Revie

1178
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:52,448
One Don Revie

1179
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:55,103
There's only one...

1180
01:15:03,968 --> 01:15:06,007
Fucking O'Hare.
You're fucking useless.

1181
01:15:06,096 --> 01:15:09,394
Leeds doesn't want you.
Fuck off, Clough.

1182
01:15:09,769 --> 01:15:11,888
Fuck off, fuck off.

1183
01:15:11,981 --> 01:15:14,836
We don't fucking want you here.
Fuck off!

1184
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:25,497
- Clough.
- Players' lounge, Brian.

1185
01:15:25,586 --> 01:15:27,883
10 minutes.

1186
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:52,302
Close the door.

1187
01:15:56,637 --> 01:16:00,636
This is the worst start to a season
Leeds has had in 20 years.

1188
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:03,301
4 points from 5 games.

1189
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,299
Second from fucking bottom.

1190
01:16:10,618 --> 01:16:12,790
What's going on?

1191
01:16:13,164 --> 01:16:15,363
As far as I can see...

1192
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:17,698
there's no relationship,
no understanding...

1193
01:16:17,796 --> 01:16:20,685
between players and management.

1194
01:16:21,427 --> 01:16:23,519
Well, not a healthy one anyway.

1195
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:29,403
Perhaps if Mr. Clough
was to step outside...

1196
01:16:29,524 --> 01:16:32,140
we might be able
to speak our minds.

1197
01:16:37,203 --> 01:16:39,102
All right.

1198
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:41,743
If you wouldn't mind, Brian.

1199
01:16:42,712 --> 01:16:45,203
Just for a few minutes.

1200
01:16:47,762 --> 01:16:49,934
As you wish.

1201
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,509
Nobody likes him. The atmosphere
in the dressing room is non - existent.

1202
01:17:04,664 --> 01:17:07,383
He's banned us from doing
all the things we used to do.

1203
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:09,981
Like playing bingo, carpet bowls.

1204
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:12,009
Tactically, he's never prepared.

1205
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:15,452
Right, he doesn't even tell us
how he wants us to play.

1206
01:17:15,599 --> 01:17:19,375
We are not even allowed
to mention Mr. Revie's name.

1207
01:17:19,981 --> 01:17:22,980
What me and the lads
are trying to say, Mr. Cussins, is...

1208
01:17:23,111 --> 01:17:25,442
compared to Mr. Revie...

1209
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:28,224
he's just not good enough.

1210
01:17:28,495 --> 01:17:30,826
What's going on, boss?

1211
01:17:32,668 --> 01:17:37,366
The last 2 words of every story
ever written is what's going on.

1212
01:17:38,595 --> 01:17:41,893
"The fucking end."

1213
01:17:44,312 --> 01:17:45,801
Let's be honest, Brian.

1214
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:48,868
It's not working, is it?

1215
01:17:49,154 --> 01:17:51,531
The players aren't happy.

1216
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:54,038
We're not happy.

1217
01:17:54,162 --> 01:17:59,577
In truth, we should probably never
have hired you without Peter Taylor.

1218
01:18:03,969 --> 01:18:05,822
So...

1219
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:09,321
- what do you want to do about it?
- It's not working.

1220
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:13,089
We have to part company.

1221
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:15,510
Fine, it will cost you 25 grand.

1222
01:18:15,613 --> 01:18:17,212
What? For 6 weeks' work?

1223
01:18:17,283 --> 01:18:19,242
Plus 3 and a half grand
for Jimmy Gordon.

1224
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:22,247
And an agreement that Leeds United
will pay both our taxes...

1225
01:18:22,374 --> 01:18:25,293
- for the next 3 years.
- That is bloody criminal.

1226
01:18:25,421 --> 01:18:27,060
- Throw in the Merc and all.
- What?

1227
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:30,451
Might be a bit flash for a man out
of a job, but I've grown to like it.

1228
01:18:30,596 --> 01:18:33,007
Who do you bloody think you are?

1229
01:18:34,018 --> 01:18:36,076
Brian Clough.

1230
01:18:36,564 --> 01:18:39,259
Brian Howard Clough.

1231
01:18:42,365 --> 01:18:45,857
Come on. There's something
we have to do on the way.

1232
01:18:46,914 --> 01:18:49,006
Won't take long.

1233
01:18:56,931 --> 01:18:58,770
Thanks for agreeing to this.

1234
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,209
No problem.

1235
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:03,237
Go easy on me though.
There's a good lad.

1236
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:12,716
How are you feeling, Mr. Clough?

1237
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,689
Not bad. Not bad.

1238
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:18,490
Onwards and upwards,
and all that type of thing.

1239
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,730
What's this?
We expecting guests?

1240
01:19:32,322 --> 01:19:34,540
Take a seat there.

1241
01:19:34,784 --> 01:19:37,161
You bastards.

1242
01:19:42,046 --> 01:19:43,740
Stand by, studio.

1243
01:19:49,558 --> 01:19:54,157
Title's out in 5, 4, 3...

1244
01:19:54,358 --> 01:19:56,117
1.

1245
01:19:56,194 --> 01:19:58,513
The football world was stunned
by the news...

1246
01:19:58,614 --> 01:20:01,573
that Brian Clough has been sacked
as manager of Leeds United.

1247
01:20:01,703 --> 01:20:05,222
We'll be talking not just to Brian,
but also to the man he replaced...

1248
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:08,184
whose success he couldn't emulate,
Don Revie.

1249
01:20:08,756 --> 01:20:11,275
To Brian Clough, first of all.

1250
01:20:11,385 --> 01:20:14,664
What's your reaction
to being sacked in this fashion?

1251
01:20:14,807 --> 01:20:16,286
Well, obviously, Austin...

1252
01:20:16,352 --> 01:20:21,130
me initial reaction is one of shock
at finding myself here with him.

1253
01:20:22,069 --> 01:20:24,588
But in answer to your question...

1254
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:30,018
6 weeks is hardly a long time
to be given a chance in any job.

1255
01:20:30,249 --> 01:20:35,168
I would hope that Revie
will get a lot longer time in his.

1256
01:20:35,383 --> 01:20:38,102
Do you consider it was possible
to step into your shoes...

1257
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:40,180
Don Revie, to replace you?

1258
01:20:40,266 --> 01:20:42,757
Well, being very, very honest...

1259
01:20:43,312 --> 01:20:46,191
I think it was a very difficult job
for anyone to do.

1260
01:20:46,317 --> 01:20:47,796
I do feel that Brian Clough...

1261
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:50,940
Now, I'll not call him Clough,
I'll not take him down like that.

1262
01:20:51,075 --> 01:20:52,234
Thank you.

1263
01:20:52,285 --> 01:20:56,095
I believe that he made it more difficult
on himself than he need have.

1264
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:58,376
And how did I do that, Don?

1265
01:20:58,462 --> 01:21:01,981
All those accusations about
how dirty my players were, about...

1266
01:21:02,135 --> 01:21:03,654
Well, they were dirty, Don.

1267
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,879
That's not true. Oh, no.

1268
01:21:05,974 --> 01:21:07,213
Last 2 seasons...

1269
01:21:07,268 --> 01:21:09,907
we were top of the charts
for entertaining football.

1270
01:21:10,022 --> 01:21:12,781
Before that, you also topped
all the disciplinary charts.

1271
01:21:12,902 --> 01:21:15,661
Should've been docked points,
sent down to Second Division.

1272
01:21:15,782 --> 01:21:19,661
Listening to you, I'm struck this is not
just a business matter for you both.

1273
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:21,269
It's more than that.

1274
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:23,332
It's personal. Am I right?

1275
01:21:23,419 --> 01:21:27,018
Well, we're very different people,
Don and I.

1276
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:30,694
We have different styles
in football and in life.

1277
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:33,287
I'm a warm man...

1278
01:21:33,394 --> 01:21:34,833
an idealist.

1279
01:21:34,896 --> 01:21:36,775
I do believe in fairies.

1280
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:40,537
And that's my outlook.
Don is slightly different.

1281
01:21:40,697 --> 01:21:42,936
There's a hardness to him.

1282
01:21:43,035 --> 01:21:44,954
- He's a cold person.
- You don't know me.

1283
01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:47,197
That lack of warmth,
that coldness was there.

1284
01:21:47,291 --> 01:21:50,250
- It permeated the club when I arrived.
- I totally refute that.

1285
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:53,259
You ask any of my players.
I was like a father to them.

1286
01:21:53,385 --> 01:21:55,944
In that club every morning,
massaging those boys.

1287
01:21:56,056 --> 01:21:58,775
- Did you do that for them?
- They would never have let me.

1288
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:00,133
Did you try?

1289
01:22:00,187 --> 01:22:02,146
You didn't even try.

1290
01:22:02,232 --> 01:22:04,911
I soaped those boys down
with me own hands.

1291
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:08,708
You just went to Leeds, no thought for
the club, no thought for the players.

1292
01:22:08,868 --> 01:22:11,907
Just on some mad personal vendetta
against me.

1293
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,239
Are you surprised? What else was
I gonna do? After what you did.

1294
01:22:15,379 --> 01:22:18,518
- What did I do?
- Come on, Don, you know exactly.

1295
01:22:19,385 --> 01:22:23,878
January 27th, 1968.
See, I even remember the date.

1296
01:22:24,101 --> 01:22:28,230
You came to Derby County,
3rd round of the FA Cup...

1297
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:31,458
and you refused
to shake my hand.

1298
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:35,171
Never. A matter of principle, I always
shake the other manager's hand.

1299
01:22:35,328 --> 01:22:38,967
No, you shook Peter Taylor's hand
and me trainer, Jimmy Gordon's.

1300
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:41,165
- I probably didn't see you.
- You saw me.

1301
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:44,213
Considered me beneath you,
looked down on me, dismissed me...

1302
01:22:44,343 --> 01:22:47,262
just like you did every other club
and every other manager.

1303
01:22:47,389 --> 01:22:51,988
Never would I knowingly refuse
to shake a colleague's hand. No.

1304
01:22:52,189 --> 01:22:56,284
But the truth is you were down
in the Second Division at the time.

1305
01:22:56,487 --> 01:22:59,581
You know, I probably didn't know
who you were.

1306
01:23:00,828 --> 01:23:03,387
Didn't know who I was?
Pull the other one.

1307
01:23:03,499 --> 01:23:06,298
- That's the truth.
- Well, you certainly know now.

1308
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,819
Oh, we all know now.

1309
01:23:08,924 --> 01:23:11,243
We know you as the man
whose constant outbursts...

1310
01:23:11,345 --> 01:23:13,624
and defaming
of his fellow professionals...

1311
01:23:13,724 --> 01:23:17,123
has brought this game,
this beautiful game, into disrepute.

1312
01:23:17,271 --> 01:23:19,870
Who had a good job at Derby,
managed to get the sack.

1313
01:23:19,984 --> 01:23:22,463
Who had the best partner
in Peter Taylor...

1314
01:23:22,572 --> 01:23:24,291
and threw him away.

1315
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,725
Who was given one of the greatest
gifts in British football, Leeds...

1316
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:31,231
a club that in 10 years,
hadn't finished outside the top 4...

1317
01:23:31,378 --> 01:23:34,577
and took them
to the bottom of the First Division.

1318
01:23:34,716 --> 01:23:38,049
Oh, yes, it's fair to say
we all know who you are now.

1319
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:41,355
Okay, unfortunately,
we're gonna have to leave it there.

1320
01:23:41,477 --> 01:23:43,476
Let's see where we are
in a year's time.

1321
01:23:43,564 --> 01:23:46,923
- Oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Let's see where we both are in 5.

1322
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:49,669
That's it for tonight.
I'd like to thank my guests...

1323
01:23:49,783 --> 01:23:52,302
Brian Clough and Don Revie,
the England manager.

1324
01:23:52,412 --> 01:23:54,470
Thank you, Austin.

1325
01:23:57,086 --> 01:23:58,525
And we're out.

1326
01:23:58,589 --> 01:24:00,548
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1327
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:03,011
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1328
01:24:55,181 --> 01:24:57,319
Boys?

1329
01:24:57,518 --> 01:24:59,917
Do you think your old man is a fool?

1330
01:25:00,022 --> 01:25:01,591
No.

1331
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:03,829
No.

1332
01:25:04,029 --> 01:25:06,121
You're wrong.

1333
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:09,247
He bloody is.

1334
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:13,469
Who is the least mature person
in this car?

1335
01:25:13,586 --> 01:25:16,316
Who most needs to bloody grow up?

1336
01:25:20,305 --> 01:25:25,003
Who's been making a right arse
of himself in the past few months?

1337
01:25:30,822 --> 01:25:33,821
Who fancies a trip to the seaside,
to see Uncle Pete?

1338
01:25:33,952 --> 01:25:35,991
- Me.
- Me.

1339
01:25:36,081 --> 01:25:38,333
Yeah, me too.

1340
01:26:18,024 --> 01:26:20,503
Just wait in the car for a minute,
lads.

1341
01:26:20,612 --> 01:26:23,580
I'm just gonna have a chat
with Uncle Pete.

1342
01:26:41,187 --> 01:26:44,247
So chucked you out already,
have they?

1343
01:26:45,527 --> 01:26:47,506
They have.

1344
01:26:49,075 --> 01:26:51,194
So how long was that?

1345
01:26:51,287 --> 01:26:54,062
44 days.

1346
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:58,691
Impressive.

1347
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:09,072
So, what are you doing here?

1348
01:27:11,903 --> 01:27:15,122
Don't make this difficult for me,
Pete.

1349
01:27:16,453 --> 01:27:18,944
You know why I'm here.

1350
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:26,069
I won't bloody grovel.

1351
01:27:26,886 --> 01:27:28,819
All right.

1352
01:27:29,349 --> 01:27:32,647
Well, all right, I'm grovelling.

1353
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:35,902
I'm on me knees.

1354
01:27:40,033 --> 01:27:42,312
" I apologise...

1355
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:44,170
unreservedly...

1356
01:27:44,248 --> 01:27:46,659
for being a twat."

1357
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:54,117
- I apologise for being a twat...
- Unreservedly.

1358
01:27:55,391 --> 01:27:56,880
Unreservedly.

1359
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:00,950
" Because I can't do it without you."

1360
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,577
Because I can't do it without you.

1361
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:06,793
" I'm nothing without you."

1362
01:28:07,452 --> 01:28:10,261
I'm nothing without you.

1363
01:28:12,753 --> 01:28:14,312
" Please...

1364
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:17,379
please, baby, take me back."

1365
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:19,489
- Fuck off.
- All right.

1366
01:28:19,681 --> 01:28:20,960
Fine.

1367
01:28:21,016 --> 01:28:23,234
Please. Please...

1368
01:28:26,483 --> 01:28:28,575
baby...

1369
01:28:29,655 --> 01:28:32,032
take me back.

1370
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,039
Come on.

1371
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,139
You're gonna fuck me up again,
aren't you?

1372
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,119
I love you, you know.

1373
01:29:13,226 --> 01:29:15,205
I know.

1374
01:29:15,814 --> 01:29:18,225
But it won't stop you.

1375
01:29:19,862 --> 01:29:23,434
So would you sooner go through it all
without me?

1376
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,779
Never.

1378
01:29:51,205 --> 01:29:52,684
Hey.

1379
01:29:52,749 --> 01:29:55,285
Come here, you two. Come here.

1380
01:29:57,673 --> 01:29:59,731
Come here.

1381
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:04,553
Hey.

1382
01:30:06,521 --> 01:30:08,200
- Wanna see your Auntie Lily?
- Yeah.

1383
01:30:08,274 --> 01:30:10,173
Go on, then.

1384
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:12,810
Well, do you want a drink
while you're here?

1385
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,565
Well, I wouldn't say no.

1386
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:18,550
I got a drop of cooking sherry.

1387
01:30:53,932 --> 01:30:55,811
We've got several things in common.

1388
01:30:55,893 --> 01:30:59,572
But the main thing we've got in
common is we want the same things.

1389
01:30:59,733 --> 01:31:03,532
You do let him speak from time
to time? I'll put a question to him.

1390
01:31:03,698 --> 01:31:06,057
Do you find it difficult, Peter,
to get a word in?

1391
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:10,414
- He's quite a good talker, isn't he?
- Yeah. In public, yes, but...
