1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,036
ARE YOU READY?

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,337
READY.

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,638
ARE YOU READY?

4
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:06,506
YEP.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,807
READY?

6
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:08,675
READY.

7
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,844
TAKE TWO.

8
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,387
OKAY, SO WE'LL
MOVE BACK, OKAY?

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,555
A LITTLE MORE.

10
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,857
LIKE THIS.

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,592
A LITTLE MORE.

12
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,761
LIKE THIS.

13
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,797
TEENY BIT MORE.

14
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,833
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

15
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,641
LITTLE BIT MORE.

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,810
READY?

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,979
READY.

18
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,919
ACTION!

19
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,257
LIOR!

20
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,558
DO YOU WANT TO SING A SONG?

21
00:00:58,992 --> 00:00:59,426
'KAY.

22
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,293
OKAY.

23
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,329
WHAT SONG WOULD
YOU LIKE TO SING?

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,631
WHICH ONE?

25
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,498
WHICH SONG DO YOU WANT, LIOR?

26
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,800
UP!

27
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,535
UP?

28
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,270
SHOULD WE DO "OPEN, SHUT THEM?"

29
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,005
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

30
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,740
YOU WANT TO DO "OLD MACDONALD?"

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,210
DO YOU WANT TO DO
"GRANDMA'S FARM?"

32
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,511
NO!

33
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:23,283
DO YOU WANT TO DO
"EENSY WEENSY SPIDER?"

34
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:24,150
NO?

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,753
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SING?

36
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,488
SHOULD WE DO "SHALOM ALEICHEM?"

37
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,355
YES.

38
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,657
AH, READY?

39
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,563
I AM LUCKY.

40
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,732
I SUPPOSE MOST PEOPLE
DON'T THINK SO,

41
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,937
BUT WHEN I SIT BESIDE LIOR, AND
HE POURS HIS HEART OUT TO GOD,

42
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,841
I FEEL DEEPLY, DEEPLY BLESSED.

43
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:26,613
AND I AM MYSTIFIED ABOUT WHY
HE LOVES TO PRAY SO MUCH.

44
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,085
YAY!

45
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,820
YAY!

46
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,688
DAI DAI DAI.

47
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,989
DAI DAI DAI?

48
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:10,857
OKAY.

49
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,291
DID YOU GET THAT?

50
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,893
DID HE SAY YI DI DAI?

51
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,665
THERE ARE THOSE
SATURDAY MORNINGS

52
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,569
WHEN I ADMIT I WOULD
LOVE TO LIE IN BED.

53
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,737
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH TROUBLE
TO GET FOUR CHILDREN

54
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,906
OUT TO SYNAGOGUE.

55
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,376
I'M TIRED FROM THE PREVIOUS
WEEK'S CHEMOTHERAPY.

56
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,979
THERE ARE A LOT
OF GREAT EXCUSES.

57
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,582
BUT MOST OF THE TIME I CAN'T.

58
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,883
I GET THERE ON TIME

59
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,353
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MISS
DAVENING WITH LIOR.

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,717
WHEN HE LIFTS HIS VOICE WITH
UNWAVERING CLARITY,

61
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:15,922
HE GIVES EVERYONE IN THE ROOM
PERMISSION TO DO THE SAME.

62
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,660
"CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT HIS BAR
MITZVAH IS GOING TO BE LIKE?"

63
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,262
I HEAR SOMEONE WHISPER.

64
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,299
I FEEL A SURPRISINGLY STRONG
EMOTIONAL REACTION

65
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,335
TO THAT QUESTION.

66
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,504
I PRAY THAT GOD WILL
GRANT ME THE BLESSING

67
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,540
TO LIVE TO BE PART OF THAT DAY.

68
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,626
LIOR, IS YOUR LIFE
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

69
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,927
AFTER YOUR BAR MITZVAH?

70
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,096
IT IS.

71
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,338
REALLY?

72
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,205
YEAH.

73
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,109
HOW COME?

74
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,688
SO, YOU'LL GET
TO DRIVE A CAR?

75
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,930
man: I WANT YOU
TO TRY SOMETHING, OK?

76
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,099
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE
AT YOUR BAR MITZVAH

77
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,569
AFTER YOU READ FROM THE TORAH,
IT'S TIME FOR A...

78
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,304
A D'VAR TORAH, RIGHT.

79
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,039
YOU HAVE TO WRITE
A BAR MITZVAH SPEECH

80
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,774
ABOUT WHAT YOU LEARNED
IN THE TORAH.

81
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,075
AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
SOMETHING TO SAY, RIGHT?

82
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:16,943
YES.

83
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,244
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU WANT TO SAY?

84
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,413
I WANT YOU TO
IMAGINE, OKAY?

85
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,148
I DON'T WANT TO IMAGINE.

86
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,015
YOU DON'T WANT TO IMAGINE?

87
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,317
NO.

88
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:28,221
OKAY, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE GOING TO SAY?

89
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,390
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

90
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,257
THINK ABOUT IT?

91
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,860
YEAH.

92
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,777
IT TAKES A LONG TIME.

93
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,644
TO THINK ABOUT IT?

94
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,078
YEAH.

95
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,945
I'LL SIT HERE QUIETLY.

96
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,548
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT.

97
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,283
I'LL THINK A COUPLE OF DAYS.

98
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,151
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS?

99
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,452
YEAH.

100
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,488
SWEETIE, WE'VE STARTED TO DO
THIS A FEW TIMES BEFORE,

101
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,525
AND EVERY TIME WE START TO DO
IT, YOU SAY "PLEASE STOP."

102
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,693
WE CAN DO IT TOMORROW.

103
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,862
TOMORROW'S A SCHOOL DAY.

104
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,465
LET'S DO IT FRIDAY NIGHT.

105
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,067
FIRST LET'S JUST DO IT FOR
A FEW MORE MINUTES NOW, OKAY?

106
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,803
'KAY, THAT'S ALL.

107
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,670
OKAY.

108
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,574
IF YOU ACT IN THE RIGHT WAY...

109
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,442
YEAH?

110
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:27,213
...THAT MEANS THAT GOOD
THINGS WILL HAPPEN SOMETIMES,

111
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,249
THAT YOU'LL
GET BLESSINGS.

112
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,190
WHEN WE GOT
THE OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS

113
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,358
THAT LIOR HAD DOWN SYNDROME,

114
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,527
DEVORA AND I,
WE CRIED A LOT.

115
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:48,034
WE WERE MOURNING HOPE,
MOURNING POSSIBILITY.

116
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,203
YOU HAVE EXPECTATIONS

117
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,974
FOR A CHILD AROUND
SUCCESS OR ACHIEVEMENT --

118
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,709
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO
BE DIFFERENT SOMEHOW,

119
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,444
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

120
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,179
DO YOU WANT TO SAY BLESSINGS
FOR YOUR TWO SISTERS?

121
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:00,613
YEAH.

122
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,914
AND YOUR TWO BROTHERS?

123
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:04,951
HUH?

124
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,686
TWO OF THE CUTE BABIES.

125
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,553
CUTE BABIES?

126
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,421
TWO.

127
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,722
WHO ARE TWO CUTE BABIES?

128
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,023
I'M GONNA GET TWO.

129
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,325
YOU ARE GOING TO
GET TWO CUTE BABIES?

130
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,192
YEAH.

131
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,060
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO
GET TWO CUTE BABIES?

132
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,795
DADDY, STOP!

133
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,096
NO, DADDY!

134
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,397
PLEASE, STOP!

135
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,000
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A DADDY SOME DAY?

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,301
I'M GOING TO BE YOU.

137
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,603
DO YOU THINK I'M A GOOD DAD?

138
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,182
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO WHEN I'M A DAD?

139
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,784
GUESS WHAT, I'M GOING
TO WATCH SOME MORE TELEVISION!

140
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,520
YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH MORE
TELEVISION WHEN YOU'RE A DAD?

141
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,255
YES!

142
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,592
HE AIN'T STUPID.

143
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,460
HE'S RETARDED.

144
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,930
IT'S DIFFERENT, HE'S NOT STUPID.

145
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:57,003
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HIS ULTIMATE
CAPABILITIES ARE GOING TO BE.

146
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,473
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT REASONABLE
EXPECTATIONS ARE,

147
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,943
AND WHEN YOU'RE PUSHING
HIM TOO HARD AND WHEN NOT.

148
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,678
IT'S VERY UNCLEAR.

149
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,499
HI, MY BOY!

150
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,800
LOOK AT YOU!

151
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,836
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME
SO YOU PUT ON A TIE?

152
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,572
YOU NEED A HAIRCUT,

153
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,740
IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS LONG
SINCE HE WAS LITTLE,

154
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,909
SINCE HE WAS
A LITTLE FROG BABY.

155
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,379
LIOR, YOU LOOKED LIKE
A LITTLE FROG.

156
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,753
I'M GLAD I'M HOME, TOO.

157
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,657
LIOR'S MY BROTHER,
BUT HE'S ALSO LIKE MY CHILD.

158
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,959
LIKE I HELPED HIM GROW UP.

159
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,995
LIKE I WAS TAKING CARE
OF HIM AND BABYSITTING.

160
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,730
UM, SINCE I WAS
LIKE TEN YEARS OLD.

161
00:09:59,465 --> 00:09:59,899
NO WAY!

162
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,068
IS YOUR BIRTHDAY
COMING UP SOON, TOO?

163
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:02,935
YES!

164
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,236
THIS YEAR!

165
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:04,670
NO WAY!

166
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,839
YES!

167
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,309
LIOR, YOU HAVE SO MANY BOOGERS
IN YOUR NOSE RIGHT NOW.

168
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,779
YOU DON'T NEED BRACES?

169
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,514
OKAY.

170
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,418
I DON'T KNOW.

171
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,286
YES, OF COURSE.

172
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,153
LIOR!

173
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:21,587
WHAT?

174
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,756
THAT WASN'T NICE.

175
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,359
NO, HE DIDN'T.

176
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,226
NO, HE DIDN'T, LIOR.

177
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,094
LIOR.

178
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,395
APRIL FOOL'S!

179
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,130
LIOR, YOU ARE SUCH A FIBBER.

180
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,865
APRIL FOOL'S IS EVERY DAY.

181
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,600
FOR YOU IT IS BECAUSE
YOU'RE SUCH A FIBBER.

182
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,504
I DON'T KNOW, BUT ONLY
THIS YEAR IT'S EVERY DAY.

183
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:39,805
THIS YEAR IT'S EVERY DAY?

184
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,842
WHAT MAKES THIS YEAR SPECIAL?

185
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,878
BECAUSE, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY
AND MY BAR MITZVAH!

186
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,047
OH.

187
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,782
LIOR HAS BEEN TALKING
ABOUT HIS BAR MITZVAH

188
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,818
SINCE MY BAT MITZVAH.

189
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,288
MY DAD HAS BEEN THINKING
ABOUT LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH

190
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,891
SINCE LIOR WAS BORN.

191
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,927
HE'S GOING TO BE SHOWING OFF HIS
KID, HIS LITTLE BOY.

192
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,229
HIS LITTLE BOY
WITH DOWN SYNDROME

193
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,398
IS HAVING A BAR MITZVAH.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,301
I ASKED LIOR,

195
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,470
DO YOU THINK ANYTHING THAT YOU
SEE IN THE WORLD IS NOT FAIR?

196
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,507
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY.

197
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,411
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO GIVE HIM
EXAMPLES, AND IT WAS JUST,

198
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,881
ITS HARD FOR HIM TO
ENGAGE IN THAT, AND THEN --

199
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,314
OOH!

200
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,616
ALMOST A SCORE.

201
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,218
ALMOST A TOUCHBACK, ALMOST.

202
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,086
WHAT'S YOUR EXPECTATION?

203
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,255
THAT HE SHOULD TALK FOR...?

204
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,857
MY EXPECTATION IS THAT HE SHOULD
TALK FOR FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES.

205
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,026
I THINK YOU SHOULD
SHOOT FOR ONE MINUTE.

206
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,327
I'M SERIOUS!

207
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,930
I MEAN, MY HEART'S DESIRE

208
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,533
WOULD BE FOR HIM TO SPEND
A FEW MINUTES TALKING

209
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,569
ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE DOWN SYNDROME.

210
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,437
RIGHT.

211
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,738
YOU GO TO THOSE
DOWN SYNDROME CONFERENCES

212
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,340
AND THERE ARE THESE
AMAZING 20, 25-YEAR-OLD

213
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,509
YOUNG ADULTS WITH DOWN SYNDROME
WHO ARE, LIKE, PROUD

214
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,678
AND SELF-ADVOCATES.

215
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,847
BUT THE STARTING POINT IS THEY
KNOW THEY HAVE DOWN SYNDROME

216
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,148
AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

217
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:56,582
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD --

218
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,450
DOES HE THINK ABOUT THAT?

219
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,751
DOES HE TALK ABOUT THAT?

220
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,185
DOES HE KNOW HE'S DIFFERENT?

221
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,486
THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT SURE.

222
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,353
I THINK ITS AN EMERGING -

223
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,956
WHY DON'T YOU RATHER HAVE HIM
TALK ABOUT WHAT GOD IS TO HIM

224
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:04,390
AND WHAT DOES --

225
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,992
I'VE TRIED --

226
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,595
SO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE HEALTHY
FOR HIM TO KNOW HE'S DIFFERENT.

227
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,330
YEAH, I THINK IT'S HEALTHY FOR
HIM TO KNOW HE'S DIFFERENT.

228
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,631
BECAUSE?

229
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,234
WELL, IN PART,
BECAUSE HE EXPERIENCES

230
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,969
A LOT OF FRUSTRATION.

231
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,704
HE SAYS, "DADDY, IT HARD TO --
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T THINK."

232
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,005
OR, "DADDY, IT'S HARD TO THINK."

233
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,741
YEAH.

234
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,476
WHOA.

235
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,343
MISSED.

236
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,644
WHOA.

237
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,813
THAT'S WHY I TELL YOU, IT'S
GOING TO BE A CLOSE GAME.

238
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,717
THEY HAVE A REALLY
GOOD DEFENSE, CAROLINA...

239
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,922
interviewer: SO LIOR, THIS
MAY BE A HARD QUESTION.

240
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,091
WHAT DOES DOWN SYNDROME MEAN?

241
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:49,068
WELL, WHAT'S DOWN SYNDROME
AND UP SYNDROME, WHAT ARE THEY?

242
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,803
THEY'RE OPPOSITES.

243
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,104
OKAY.

244
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,141
APRIL FOOL'S.

245
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:00,780
YOU CHEATER!

246
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,683
GAME POINT LIOR,
THIS IS BIG.

247
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,418
WHO'S GOING TO WIN?

248
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,756
I KIND OF REMEMBER BEING TOLD HE
HAD AN EXTRA 21st CHROMOSOME

249
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,624
AND HE WAS GOING TO BE SLOWER.

250
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,359
BUT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
DOWN SYNDROME MEANT,

251
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,660
SO, IT WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE

252
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,564
HOW I LOOKED AT HIM,
TALKED TO HIM, ANYTHING.

253
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,733
HE WAS THE CUTEST LITTLE
THING I'VE EVER SEEN

254
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,335
AND HE WAS JUST
SO FUNNY LOOKING.

255
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,806
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO BE STEREOTYPICAL

256
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,107
TO ASIAN PEOPLE AND STUFF,

257
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,143
BUT HIS EYES WERE VERY SLANTY

258
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,746
AND HE JUST HAD THIS
FUNNY LITTLE FACE

259
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,782
THAT KINDA JUST REMINDED
YOU OF A FROG,

260
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,819
SO WE WOULD CALL
HIM A CHINESE FROG.

261
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,987
I BEAT YOU.

262
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:45,891
I'M THE CHAMPION.

263
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,193
NO, I'M CHAMPION.

264
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,060
WE'LL WRESTLE FOR IT.

265
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,795
IF I WIN, I'M CHAMPION.

266
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,530
WHAT IF I WIN?

267
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,398
THEN YOU'RE CHAMPION.

268
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,567
OKAY.

269
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,411
CHAMPION!

270
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,182
YOU'RE THE CHAMPION.

271
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,917
IF YOU GET A STAIN ON IT,

272
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,086
YOU WON'T EVER BE ABLE TO WEAR
IT AGAIN AS A DRESS SHIRT.

273
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:18,858
THERE'S NO REASON TO WEAR A
WHITE DRESS SHIRT FOR DINNER

274
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,460
WHEN THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT
IT IS GOING TO GET STAINED

275
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,930
SO I WILL COME UP WITH YOU...

276
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:31,437
LIOR, YOU NEED TO WALK
UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.

277
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,208
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU --

278
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,413
YOU KNOW WHAT?

279
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,450
YOU CAN WEAR THE SHIRT
IF YOU WEAR AN APRON.

280
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,317
THOSE ARE YOUR CHOICES.

281
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,619
OKAY.

282
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,655

MOMMY DEVORA.

00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,533
SHE STILL GETS A CANDLE.

331
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,871
YOU JUST LIGHT IT FOR HER.

332
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,172
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

333

EVEN THOUGH MOMMY DEVORA DIED,

00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,377
YOU'LL LIGHT A CANDLE

OKAY, REENA DID IT,

00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,016
YOU'LL HAVE ONE CANDLE
THAT'S SPECIAL FOR MOMMY.

338
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,354
RIGHT.

339
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,691
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE GONE THROUGH...

340
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,294
LYNNE'S VERY
DIFFERENT FROM MY MOM,

341
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,764
SO ITS HARD TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE
RAISING MY SIBLINGS,

342
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,066
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE LIOR

343
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,536
KIND OF TAKES AFTER MY MOM MORE
THAN ANY OF THE REST OF US.

344
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,284
LET'S REPEAT!

345
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,144
WELL, I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER

346
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,180
AND I WOULD JUST
SEE LIOR PRAYING,

347
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,216
JUST DAVENING HIS HEART OUT
AND PRAYING LIKE CRAZY.

348
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,759
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF A GOD DOES EXIST OR NOT,

349
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,795
BUT IF THERE IS A GOD,

350
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:28,133
THEN LIOR IS DEFINITELY CLOSER
TO GOD THAN ANYBODY ELSE I KNOW.

351
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,918
THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE
THAT LIOR IS CLOSER TO GOD

352
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,821
IS THE SENSE THAT
HE HAS LESS VEILS

353
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,424
BETWEEN HIM, YOU KNOW,
AND THE WORLD.

354
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,762
BETWEEN HIM, YOU KNOW, AND GOD.

355
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,679
LIOR, WHAT DO YOU THINK
GOD LOOKS LIKE?

356
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,751
WELL, DOES GOD HAVE
A COLOR OR A SMELL?

357
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,486
NO.

358
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,788
DOES GOD LOOK LIKE A PERSON?

359
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,390
NO.

360
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,294
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK GOD
LISTENS TO THE MOST?

361
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,066
IS THAT WHY YOU LIKE
TO DO IT SO MUCH?

362
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,367
YEAH.

363
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,668
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

364
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,403
THAT'S A VERY
INTERESTING IDEA.

365
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,705
NO.

366
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,006
IT'S NOT INTERESTING?

367
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,549
LIOR!

368
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,284
OKAY, LIOR,I'M TAKING
ANNA SOMEWHERE

369
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,585
AND YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME, SWEETHEART.

370
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:54,886
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

371
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,055
WE'RE TAKING ANNA
TO ROSA'S HOUSE.

372
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:01,393
LIOR, I NEED
YOU TO COOPERATE.

373
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,429
WHEN I CAME INTO
THIS FAMILY, SIX YEARS AGO,

374
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,731
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

375
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,032
TO HAVE A CHILD
WITH DOWN SYNDROME.

376
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,767
COME ON.

377
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,972
COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT.

378
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,274
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE

379
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,009
IS I DON'T THINK
HE'S HANDICAPPED.

380
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,310
AND I HAVE TO
SOMETIMES REALIZE

381
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,346
THAT HE IS A CHILD THAT
HAS DOWN SYNDROME,

382
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,515
HE IS A CHILD THAT IS SLOWER.

383
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,250
SOMETIMES HE SEEMS TO WANTS
TO JUST STAY REALLY

384
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,853
CUTE AND LOVEABLE.

385
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,757
AND I'M TRYING TO LET HIM KNOW,
AS HE COMES TO BE A BAR MITZVAH,

386
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,661
THAT HE CAN BE
LOVABLE AND MATURE.

387
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,336
LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH
GETS REALLY ANNOYING.

388
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,806
FIRST OF ALL, EVERYBODY
DOESN'T PAY ATTENTION TO ME.

389
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,107
LIKE, SINCE I'M THE YOUNGEST,

390
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,710
PEOPLE WOULD THINK I WOULD
GET THE MOST ATTENTION,

391
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,011
BUT SINCE
LIOR HAS DOWN SYNDROME,

392
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,614
HE BASICALLY GETS
THE MOST ATTENTION,

393
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,216
SO IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING.

394
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,398
SOMETIMES LIOR'S
REALLY EMBARRASSING.

395
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,435
HE SAYS RANDOM THINGS
SOMETIMES TO HIMSELF.

396
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,544
PEOPLE LOOK AT HIM
FUNNY AND STUFF.

397
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,881
I GUESS THEY'RE JUST THINKING
HE'S A WEIRDO OR SOMETHING.

398
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,520
LIOR,
DOES HAVING DOWN SYNDROME,

399
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,822
AND HAVING SPECIAL NEEDS,

400
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,424
DOES THAT MAKE YOU DIFFERENT
THAN OTHER KIDS YOUR AGE?

401
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,159
YES.

402
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,328
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?

403
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,437
WHAT, I DIDN'T HEAR WHAT YOU
SAID, "YOU HANG OUT" WHAT?

404
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,606
I HANG OUT FOR ONCE IN A WHILE.

405
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,341
YOU HANG OUT ONCE IN A WHILE?

406
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,642
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

407
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,619
BOY, IF EVERYBODY HAD
THE SOCIAL SKILLS OF THIS KID,

408
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,089
WE'D ALL GO AROUND
SMILING ALL THE TIME.

409
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,391
HEY, LIOR.

410
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,692
CAN YOU SAY HI?

411
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,294
DEVORA USED TO
SAY, "BOY, YOU KNOW,

412
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:20,198
WE'RE REALLY FORTUNATE THAT
LIOR HAD DOWN SYNDROME,

413
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,801
AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER MALADY."

414
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,970
OH, ANNA,
THAT'S A TEASE.

415
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,271
'CAUSE DOWN SYNDROME,

416
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,874
WHILE IT CERTAINLY
HAS ITS CHALLENGES,

417
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,778
THIS IS A KID WHO CAN CONNECT.

418
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,380
AND THAT MEANT SO
MUCH TO DEVORA,

419
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,115
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT
HER LIFE WAS ALL ABOUT,

420
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,417
WAS ABOUT CONNECTION.

421
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,393
AFTER DEVORA DIED, I REMEMBER
SPENDING TIME WITH MORDECHAI,

422
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,297
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
LIOR SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL.

423
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,900
I REMEMBER TALKING WITH
THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL

424
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,635
WHERE THERE'S
AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM

425
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,804
FOR KIDS WITH DOWN SYNDROME.

426
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,105
AND I SAID "WELL, YOU KNOW,

427
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,141
THEY'RE CONSIDERING AN ORTHODOX
JEWISH DAY SCHOOL."

428
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,178
AND THIS MAN SAID TO ME,
"THAT'S WHERE HE SHOULD GO."

429
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,346
AND THIS PERSON
WASN'T EVEN JEWISH!

430
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,817
HE SAID, "AT OUR SCHOOL, WE'LL
MAXIMIZE HIS READING LEVEL,

431
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:17,022
AND HIS MATH LEVEL, BUT THAT'S
NOT WHAT THIS LITTLE BOY NEEDS.

432
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:20,926
IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT THIS BOY
NEEDS IS TRADITION, AND RITUAL,

433
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,396
AND A COMMUNITY THAT'S
GOING TO EMBRACE HIM."

434
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,180
WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU
ARRIVE LATE TOMINCHA

435
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,349
AND THEMINYANIS ALREADY
DAVENINGSH'MONEH ESRAI?

436
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,217
WHAT'S THE THING YOU SHOULD DO?

437
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,952
YES?

438
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,687
DAVENSH'MONEH ESRAI
RIGHT WITH THEM.

439
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,723
WHAT IS THE LAST
T'FILAHOFMINCHA?

440
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,759
NOPE.

441
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,061
SHAUL COHEN?

442
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:56,928
WHAT?

443
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:57,796
ALEINUIS RIGHT.

444
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,965
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF COMING TO DAVENING

445
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,133
IS NOT TO HEARKIDUSHAH

446
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,435
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

447
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,471
IS TO DAVEN WITH PEOPLE
THESH'MONEH ESRAITOGETHER.

448
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,640
OKAY, UH, LIOR.

449
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,570
LIOR, HE DAVENS, LIKE,
OFF KEY, BUT IT'S GOOD.

450
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,378
SOME PEOPLE, THEY LIKE,

451
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,980
DO BATTING SCORES OF
THE PHILLIES GAME OR STUFF,

452
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:55,487
HE JUST DAVENS, HE JUST
DAVENS, THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

453
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,271
LIKE FOR ME, IT'S EASY.

454
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,006
I CAN JUST SIT THERE
AND JUST SAY THE WORDS.

455
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:18,043
FOR HIM, HE HAS DOWN SYNDROME
AND IT'S NOT AS EASY.

456
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,778
AND HE HAS TO STRIVE TO DO IT.

457
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,224
IT COUNTS DOUBLE.

458
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:41,466
LIOR, IS GOD LISTENING
WHEN YOU DAVEN?

459
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,840
DOES GOD LISTEN
WHEN YOUR DAD PRAYS?

460
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,575
YES!

461
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:53,178
DOES GOD LISTEN
WHEN ANNA PRAYS?

462
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,913
NOT -- NO.

463
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,214
HOW COME GOD LISTENS
WHEN YOUR DAD PRAYS

464
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,383
AND NOT WHEN ANNA PRAYS?

465
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,323
I WANT TO DAVEN AT
YOUR BAR MITZVAH.

466
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,625
COULD YOU TEACH ME HOW?

467
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,095
CUT CUT CUT!

468
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,697
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED
TO DO SOMETHING

469
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,734
ABOUT THE INVITATION LIST.

470
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,902
AND WHAT DO WE
WANT IT TO SAY?

471
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,071
"IN HONOR OF
LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH...

472
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,240
WE'D BE PLEASED IF
YOU MADE A DONATION

473
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,409
TO THE SPECIAL ED PROGRAM.

474
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,710
LIOR'S SPECIAL ED PROGRAM.

475
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,012
YEAH, LIOR'S SPECIAL ED PROGRAM.

476
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,614
LIOR'S SPECIAL ED PROGRAM."

477
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,915
OKAY.

478
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,269
HEY!

479
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,871
HE GOT IT!

480
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,427
IS IT HERE?

481
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,536
OH, NO.

482
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,573
OH, NO, NO YOU DON'T, NO!

483
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,742
NO.

484
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,947
WHERE IS MY SHOE?

485
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,983
NO!

486
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,586
NO, NO!

487
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,490
GET OUT!

488
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,900
I'D BETTER FIND IT,
I'D BETTER.

489
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,274
WAY TO GO, LIOR!

490
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,142
GOOD JOB.

491
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,744
TUCK YOUR SHIRT IN, BABY.

492
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,045
I'VE HAD A KID
IN LITTLE LEAGUE

493
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,082
FOR THIRTEEN YEARS OR SO.

494
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,684
LIOR GREW UP SEEING REENA
DO IT AND YONI DO IT

495
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,419
AND SO, WHEN HE WAS THAT AGE,

496
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,588
HE WANTED TO DO IT.

497
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,890
WHAT IS RULE NUMBER ONE?

498
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,058
GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP.

499
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,661
CHEER EACH OTHER ON.

500
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:02,300
LET'S GO JULIA, LET'S GO...

501
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,035
IF THE BALL IS UP
HERE DO YOU SWING?

502
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:04,903
NO!

503
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,204
IF THE BALL IS DOWN
HERE DO YOU SWING?

504
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,071
NO!

505
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,807
MY MAIN CONCERN IN
THESE GAMES IS THAT

506
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,240
THE BALL IS GONNA
COME RIGHT TO HIM

507
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:10,975
AND HE'S GONNA DROP IT,

508
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,710
AND THE OTHER TEAM
IS GONNA SCORE A RUN,

509
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,445
OR IF HE'S GONNA STRIKE
OUT WITH, YOU KNOW,

510
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,181
BASES LOADED
AND THEY'RE ONE RUN DOWN.

511
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,783
IF YOU HIT THE BALL DO YOU LOOK
AT THE BALL OR DO YOU RUN?

512
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,651
I RUN.

513
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,386
DO YOU LOOK AT THE BALL?

514
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,253
I RUN.

515
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,988
YOU HIT THE BALL
AND THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS --

516
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,422
RUN.

517
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,290
RIGHT.

518
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,157
YOU RUN.

519
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,025
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN
YOU HIT THE BALL?

520
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,760
RUN.

521
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,061
I WANT TO HEAR LIOR'S NAME.

522
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,796
LET'S GO, LIOR!

523
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,531
BASES LOADED!

524
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,435
LIOR, TAKE A COUPLE
PRACTICE SWINGS.

525
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,303
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO!

526
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,170
LIOR'S OUR GOOD HITTER!

527
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,471
COME ON, MAN!

528
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,508
JUST LIKE IN PRACTICE,
COME ON!

529
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,978
LET'S GO,
LIOR, LET'S GO!

530
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:47,846
THAT'S RIGHT.

531
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,581
GO, LIOR!

532
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,448
BASES LOADED!

533
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,484
WATCH THE BALL ALL
THE WAY IN, YOU CAN DO IT.

534
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:56,087
SWING ONLY AT STRIKES, LIOR.

535
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,388
ONLY AT STRIKES.

536
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,123
LIOR, WHAT'S
YOUR STRIKE ZONE?

537
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,425
LIOR, WHAT'S YOUR
STRIKE ZONE?

538
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,594
YOUR KNEES TO YOUR CHEST.

539
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,329
COME ON, LIOR!

540
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,196
GOOD TRY, LIOR!

541
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,064
GOOD TRY!

542
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,799
THAT'S OKAY.

543
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,716
YOU CAN DO IT, DAVID.

544
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,318
THROW STRIKES, DJ!

545
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,053
LIOR!

546
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,523
PAY ATTENTION!

547
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,692
PAY ATTENTION, LIOR!

548
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,861
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
LOSE THIS GAME.

549
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,596
LET'S PUT IT LIKE THIS.

550
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,199
I'M NOT GIVING UP HOPE YET
BECAUSE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

551
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:45,103
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

552
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:45,970
SECOND BASE.

553
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,440
THAT'S RIGHT, FORCE AT
SECOND BASE YOU GUYS.

554
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:57,682
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO GO!

555
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,659
LIOR!

556
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,261
GAME'S OVER, SWEETIE.

557
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,165
GAME'S OVER, SWEETIE.

558
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,009
I THINK MY DAD AND LYNNE
PUSH LIOR TOO HARD SOMETIMES.

559
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,046
HE NEEDS, LIKE, SOMEONE TO KINDA
BE LIKE THE CRUTCH FOR HIM,

560
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,781
JUST TO HELP HIM,
LIKE, GET ALONG.

561
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,950
AND KINDA JUST TEACH HIM
WHAT'S APPROPRIATE

562
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,420
OR BASEBALL AND SCHOOL WORK.

563
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,890
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY JOB.

564
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,963
'CAUSE ME AND HIM ARE
LIKE BEST FRIENDS.

565
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,565
AND WITHOUT ME AROUND,

566
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:52,337
HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
A CLOSE FRIEND ANYMORE.

567
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,012
LIOR, I HAVE TO WRITE A PAPER.

568
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,313
CAN YOU WRITE IT FOR ME?

569
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,181
YEAH.

570
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,482
OKAY.

571
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,217
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT?

572
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,687
IT'S ABOUT GAY MARRIAGES.

573
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,422
DO YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON IT?

574
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:11,856
YEAH.

575
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,591
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY?

576
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,459
HI.

577
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,796
YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE.

578
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,098
I SHOULD DO SOMETHING ELSE?

579
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:20,531
YEAH.

580
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,399
WHY, THAT'S BORING?

581
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,266
YEAH.

582
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,568
I CAN'T,
I WISH I COULD.

583
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,435
REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME
I WROTE ABOUT YOU?

584
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,303
YEAH.

585
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:26,604
REMEMBER THAT PAPER?

586
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,038
YEAH.

587
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,339
COULD YOU DO IT AGAIN?

588
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,640
COULD I WRITE ABOUT YOU AGAIN?

589
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,508
YEAH.

590
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,243
NO, I JUST TOLD
YOU I CAN'T.

591
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,846
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO COME TO MY SCHOOL?

592
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:37,882
YOU CAN COME FOR MY GRADUATION.

593
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,220
YOU'LL BE THERE WHEN I
GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL?

594
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,521
YEP.

595
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,690
WHERE SHOULD I GO TO COLLEGE?

596
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,124
GUESS WHAT.

597
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:46,991
WHAT?

598
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,292
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

599
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,594
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME WHERE?

600
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:51,763
YOU'RE GOING TO GO
TO COLLEGE WITH ME?

601
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,498
NO, YOU CAN'T!

602
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,030
GOODNIGHT, LIOR.

603
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,199
GOODNIGHT, MAMA LYNNE.

604
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,802
GOODNIGHT, LIOR.

605
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,911
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

606
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,646
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT IDEA?

607
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:42,947
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

608
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:43,815
WHY?

609
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,659
REALLY?

610
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,900
HER SPIRIT IS
GOING TO COME BACK?

611
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,069
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT WILL BE LIKE?

612
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,274
SO LIOR, YOU THINK ALL
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN

613
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,576
AT YOUR BAR MITZVAH?

614
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,744
YEAH.

615
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,046
SO YOU THINK THE MESSIAH
IS GOING TO COME

616
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,781
AND YOUR MOTHER'S SPIRIT
IS GONNA COME BACK?

617
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,516
YEAH.

618
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,552
ON THE DAY, OR A FEW
DAYS AFTERWARDS, OR WHEN?

619
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,132
OKAY, LIOR TAKE
A PENCIL, PLEASE.

620
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,602
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO GO
ON TO EMERGENCY WORDS.

621
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:38,903
OKAY LIOR, START FOR US.

622
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:41,939
VERY GOOD.

623
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,241
LEORA.

624
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,181
OKAY.

625
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,519
OKAY.

626
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,856
BUT YOU ARE WHAT?

627
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,326
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING.

628
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,061
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

629
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:04,929
YOU'RE RIDING.

630
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:05,363
YOU'RE RIDING.

631
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:06,664
OKAY, IN?

632
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,002
OR WHAT ELSE?

633
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,472
YOU COULD BE IN A CAR,
BUT YOU COULD BE IN WHAT ELSE?

634
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,773
A VAN.

635
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,942
AH, WHAT ELSE?

636
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:22,280
THINK PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

637
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,448
SO, WHAT'S PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION?

638
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,750
AN AIRPLANE.

639
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,617
IT COULD BE IN AN AIRPLANE.

640
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:27,485
VERY GOOD.

641
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,352
OKAY, NEXT ONE.

642
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,389
CAN YOU TELL ME
A LIVING THING PLEASE?

643
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,558
YES, MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO.

644
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,293
MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO?

645
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:35,726
YES.

646
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,594
WELL, MONKEYS ARE
LIVING THINGS.

647
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,461
OKAY.

648
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,067
GOD MAKES EVERY PERSON WITH
A DIFFERENT TEST IN THIS WORLD.

649
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,971
SO, GOD'S TEST PROBABLY
FOR LIOR IS MAYBE,

650
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,441
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,
BUT MAYBE WITH DOWN SYNDROME,

651
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,911
HE THINKS LIOR CAN PROBABLY
WITHSTAND THIS KIND OF TEST.

652
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,984
HASHEM JUST WANTED
HIM TO BE LIKE THAT.

653
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,887
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD'S DOING.

654
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,503
WHEN GOD MADE LIOR
HAVING DOWN SYNDROME,

655
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:57,275
IT ALSO BECOMES A TEST
TO US, HOW WE TREAT LIOR,

656
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:03,347
IF WE DO THINGS WITH LIOR,
THAT'S PART OF OUR TEST.

657
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,082
LIOR!

658
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,277
HIKE!

659
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,446
AARON!

660
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,101
YEAH?

661
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:30,968
MY DAD SAY THAT TO ME.

662
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,269
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

663
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,571
WHO'S THE BOSS?

664
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,438
YOU.

665
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:34,872
HUH?

666
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,173
YOU.

667
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:37,475
RIGHT.

668
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,077
ME AND YOU ARE THE BOSSES.

669
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,150
HE DID?

670
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,017
YES.

671
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,319
YOU GUYS ARE GETTING TOO OLD.

672
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,488
I'M SO YOUNG THAT I CAN'T
EVEN BELIEVE IT.

673
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,392
WHAT?

674
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,127
52...OR 60.

675
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,199
WHEN I'M GOING TO
BE 100, I'M GOING TO RETIRE

676
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,368
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU THE BARBERSHOP.

677
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,537
IT'LL BE YOUR SHOP,
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.

678
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:07,405
YEAH, BUT YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM.

679
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,573
WE'LL HAVE TO
CHANGE SOME RULES.

680
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,007
WHY?

681
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,176
SATURDAYS, SEE.

682
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,477
NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

683
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,779
WHY?

684
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,381
WELL, WHY?

685
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,550
WHY DO YOU THINK?

686
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,586
RIGHT.

687
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,755
SO YOU CAN OPEN ON
WEDNESDAYS 'CAUSE I CLOSE.

688
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,056
YOU CAN CALL
IT YOUR NAME, TOO,

689
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,225
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE DON'S ANYMORE.

690
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,431
AND IT WILL BE
YOUR BARBERSHOP.

691
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,033
A BOOK?

692
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,202
YOU HAVE A BOOK

693
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,503
WHERE'S IT AT?

694
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,973
YOU HAVE A BOOK ON YOUR HEAD.

695
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,347

00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:56,854
DID YOU READ
THIS ARTICLE

699
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,155
THAT THE SIXERS
ARE SINKING FAST?

700
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,457
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S OBVIOUS.

701
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,059
THAT'S THE GAME THAT WE
SHOULD HAVE WENT TO LIOR.

702
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,360
"SHOULD HAVE GONE TO."

703
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,963
TEACH HIM HOW TO SPEAK
CORRECTLY, PLEASE.

704
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,698
IT'S THE GAME WE SHOULD
HAVE WENT TO LAST NIGHT.

705
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,566
YONI --

706
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,433

707
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,036
TEACH HIM HOW TO
SPEAK CORRECTLY.

708
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:12,903
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

709
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,072
"SHOULD HAVE GONE TO,"
NOT "SHOULD HAVE WENT TO."

710
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,807
SHOULD HAVE GONE TO.

711
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,542
SOMETIMES, I JUST GET SO MAD AT
MY DAD BECAUSE, I'M LIKE,

712
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,844
"THIS ISN'T MY JOB."

713
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,446
LIKE HOW HE ASKS
ME TO PARENT LIOR

714
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,615
WHEN, AT TIMES, IT'S NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY

715
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,350
TO TEACH HIM
RIGHT AND WRONG

716
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,953
AND WHAT HE SHOULD
AND SHOULD NOT BE DOING.

717
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,989
WHAT'S BOONDOCK
HAVE TO SAY TODAY?

718
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,158
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

719
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,194
IF YOU WANT TO READ IT YOU
CAN READ IT ON YOUR OWN TIME.

720
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,171
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT COLLEGE.

721
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,773
I DON'T THINK I COULD BE
ANYWHERE THAT'S FAR FROM LIOR,

722
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,810
JUST BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO
SEE HIM ON A REGULAR BASIS.

723
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,979
LIKE I COULDN'T BE SOMEPLACE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY

724
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,714
WHERE I WOULD SEE HIM, YOU KNOW,

725
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,449
ONCE EVERY COUPLE
MONTHS 'CAUSE THAT JUST,

726
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,618
I MEAN, THAT WOULD
BE TOO HARD FOR ME.

727
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,389
IT'S FOR PROM.

728
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,257
OH.

729
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,124
WOULD YOU LIKE A BAG?

730
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,859
YES, PLEASE.

731
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:09,727
WANT TO SIT IN THE FRONT?

732
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,896
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

733
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,197
I'D PROBABLY
END UP BEING

734
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,932
IN THE NORTHEAST
PART OF THE COUNTRY

735
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,402
FOR I GUESS MY ENTIRE
LIFE PROBABLY, JUST 'CAUSE...

736
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,005
LIOR'S HERE.

737
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,475
IN MY ROOM.

738
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,342
YONI?

739
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,210
LIOR?

740
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,077
CAN I PLAY?

741
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:27,945
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

742
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,114
YOU WANNA DO
THE PRACTICE MODE?

743
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:30,548
NO.

744
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,415
NO?

745
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,283
YOU WANNA PLAY THE GAME?

746
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,150
YEAH.

747
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,584
OKAY, DON'T GO OFF SIDES.

748
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,319
YOU'RE OFF SIDES.

749
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:35,753
ALL RIGHT, TACKLE.

750
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,620
NICE.

751
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,355
WHAT QUARTER?

752
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,090
SECOND QUARTER.

753
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,825
HA!

754
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,561
PERFECT!

755
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,862
YOU'RE GOING FOR
A FIELD GOAL BLOCK, LIOR?

756
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:45,729
NO.

757
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,597
YES, YOU ARE.

758
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:47,464
YES, I AM.

759
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,766
DON'T GO OFF SIDES...

760
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,935
UH-OH, IT'S...

761
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:51,802
NO GOOD!

762
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,103
NO GOOD!

763
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,405
BIG PLAY.

764
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,706
PERFECT PASS!

765
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,309
IT WAS NICE PLAY, THOUGH.

766
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,044
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE PANTS?

767
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:00,911
LIOR?

768
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,646
LIOR, LIOR?

769
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,381
LI-OOR?

770
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,249
WHAT?

771
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:05,683
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MY PANTS?

772
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,285
LIOR, DID YOU EVEN LOOK?

773
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,189
TOUCHDOWN?

774
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:12,623
YOU SCORED?

775
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:13,924
YES.

776
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,659
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

777
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:21,732
GOOD!

778
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:22,600
OH, NO.

779
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,901
NO!

780
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,202
YES!

781
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,937
PERFECT!

782
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,238
YES.

783
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:32,142
OKAY.

784
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:33,444
IT'S HALFTIME.

785
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,613
TELL ME WHAT
YOU THINK, LIOR.

786
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,046
LIOR?

787
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:36,480
GOOD.

788
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:37,348
LIOR --

789
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,516
YOU LOOK...

790
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,794
NOW YOU LOOK GOOD.

791
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,433
AND DO NOT LET ANYONE
TO TOUCH YOUR HAIR.

792
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,735
DON'T LET ANYONE TOUCH IT.

793
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,036
DON'T LET ANYONE
TOUCH MY HAIR?

794
00:43:59,036 --> 00:43:59,470
NO.

795
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,205
AND DON'T EVEN MESS IT UP.

796
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,506
MESS ME UP?

797
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,615
THERE YOU GO, LET ME SEE.

798
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,784
I'M FEELING ALMOST SAD,

799
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,387
BITTERSWEET ABOUT
THIS BAR MITZVAH

800
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:20,724
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE HIGHLIGHT OF HIS LIFE

801
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:24,628
FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OR MORE.

802
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,363
LIOR THINKS HE'S
GOING TO GROW UP

803
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:29,400
AND DRIVE A CAR AND HAVE
A BABY AND GET MARRIED.

804
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,171
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE
THAT THEY CAN'T DO THAT?

805
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,472
ESPECIALLY SOMEONE

806
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,509
WHO PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO
EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT.

807
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,184
HIGH FUNCTIONING TEENAGERS
WITH DOWN SYNDROME

808
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,353
CAN BE PRETTY UNHAPPY.

809
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,257
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT
THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED.

810
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,426
THEY DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS.

811
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:10,174
I AM JUST SO CONCERNED ABOUT
HIM BEING SAD AND LONELY.

812
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,210
I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
HIM ENCOUNTERING A WORLD

813
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,511
THAT'S TOO CONFUSING.

814
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:18,849
AND ENCOUNTERING PEOPLE THAT
JUST DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.

815
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:25,789
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN PART OF
A COMMUNITY THAT'S KNOWN HIM.

816
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,610
LIOR'S REALLY THIS
LITTLE SPIRITUAL MASTER.

817
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,646
HE'S SO CLEARLY
IN RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD

818
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,948
WHEN HE'S DAVENING.

819
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,550
THAT'S THE GOAL THAT
I WANT TO REACH.

820
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,719
WHEN MY MIND IS WANDERING
AND GOING ASTRAY,

821
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,057
I JUST TAKE ONE LOOK AT LIOR
AND I GET RIGHT BACK ON TRACK.

822
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,865
SOMEHOW, HE TURNED
THE LEARNING INTO A DANCE,

823
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,467
INSTEAD OF A STRUGGLE.

824
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:28,685
THE ZOHAR TELLS OF STORIES
OF MIRACLE CHILDREN

825
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:33,023
WHO ARE SPIRITUAL,
YOU KNOW, GENIUSES.

826
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,059
WELL, THAT'S WHAT LIOR IS.

827
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,530
I HAVE
AN ALTERNATIVE

828
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,433
TO THE "LIOR IS A REBBE"
SPIRITUAL POINT OF VIEW.

829
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,036
HE GREW UP IN
A COMMUNITY IN WHICH,

830
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:49,072
EVERY TIME HE OPENED HIS
MOUTH WITH A HEBREW PRAYER,

831
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,675
BEAMING FACES RESPONDED.

832
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,711
HAD HE BEEN LIVING IN
A COMMUNITY WHERE, YOU KNOW,

833
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,880
CHRISTMAS CAROLS WERE
THE ORDER OF THE DAY,

834
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,483
HE WOULD BE DOING
CHRISTMAS CAROLS.

835
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,797
I'M CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE
PROJECT TOO MUCH ONTO HIM,

836
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:18,569
OR EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM HIM,
OR WANT THINGS FROM HIM

837
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,605
THAT HE'S REALLY NOT
ABLE TO GIVE THEM.

838
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,340
HE'S NOT A REBBE,

839
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,111
HE IS NOT A CONSCIOUS SPIRITUAL
TEACHER IN THAT SENSE.

840
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:32,449
HE IS A LOVING CHILD.

841
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,919
SO FAR, WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT --

842
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:36,353
BLESSINGS.

843
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,522
BLESSINGS, RIGHT.

844
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,691
SINCE THIS IS PART
OF YOUR D'VAR TORAH,

845
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,860
WHAT KIND OF LESSONS DO
WE LEARN FROM THE TORAH?

846
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,161
CAN YOU SAY?

847
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,065
THEN WHY IS IT IMPORTANT
TO STUDY THE TORAH?

848
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,704
OKAY, BUT WHAT DOES
THE TORAH TEACH US?

849
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,909
COMMUNITY, OKAY.

850
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,945
THE COMMUNITY, IN
THIS SORT OF LIFE,

851
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,415
AND WE DO IT IN OUR HEARTS.

852
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,150
I DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW
THAT, YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN?

853
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:08,452
IT SOUNDED VERY GOOD,

854
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,621
BUT I NEED YOU TO SAY IT AGAIN
SO I UNDERSTAND IT BETTER.

855
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,332
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD,
THAT SOUNDS VERY SMART.

856
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:22,766
YOU LIKE THAT?

857
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,200
YEAH.

858
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,501
OH, GOOD, OKAY.

859
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:25,802
I BET THERE'S MORE
YOU COULD THINK OF

860
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,104
BECAUSE THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

861
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:33,610
IN, AND THEN, IF YOU READ
THE TORAH IT GIVES US THE --

862
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,080
IT GOES FROM GENERATION
TO GENERATION.

863
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:40,550
SO THE TORAH GOES FROM
GENERATION, AND WHAT HAPPENS?

864
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:52,696
SO, NOW I HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

865
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,865
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
GENERATION MEANS?

866
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:55,299
NO.

867
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,467
"GENERATION TO GENERATION"

868
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:01,371
MEANS FROM GREAT-GRANDPARENTS,
TO GRANDPARENTS,

869
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,540
TO PARENTS, TO CHILDREN,
EVERY --

870
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,023
YOU'VE DEFINITELY LISTENED
TO TOO MANY SERMONS

871
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:23,060
IN YOUR LIFE ABOUT COMMUNITY.

872
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,301
...IN EVERY STEP.

873
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,771
IN EVERY STEP.

874
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,374
HALLELUJAH!

875
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:52,122
I WILL ADDRESS ENVELOPES,
AND YOU CAN FILL THEM...

876
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,291
YEAH.

877
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,460
NEXT PLEASE?

878
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,532
FOUR TO TWO.

879
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,125
HIS NAMELIOR
MEANS "MY LIGHT."

880
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,727
HE'S A LIGHT FOR US
AND FOR MANY OTHER PEOPLE.

881
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,330
KIND OF LIKE A SPOTLIGHT
ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT.

882
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,571
GOOD.

883
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:48,078
I GET THAT, FOR LIOR, DAVENING
WITH ME IS A CONNECTION TO...

884
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,680
UM...

885
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,151
TO THE MOMMY PART.

886
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,621
TO MATERNAL ENERGY.

887
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,826
SHE BROUGHT THESE
CHILDREN INTO THIS WORLD.

888
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:06,730
SHE GAVE THEM A CERTAIN
BEGINNING OF THEIR LIFE.

889
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:11,068
AND NOW, I'M PARENTING THEM.

890
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,538
AND IT'S A VERY AWESOME
KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY.

891
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:30,587
SO LIOR, THE D'VAR TORAH IS ALL
THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID TO ME,

892
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,322
THEY'RE ALL YOUR WORDS.

893
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,358
I PUT THEM IN AN ORDER,
SO ONE FOLLOWS THE OTHER.

894
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:35,792
OKAY?

SO THIS IS IT, AND LET
ME HEAR YOU SAY IT.

897
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,166
"THE TORAH GOES
FROM VENTERATION --"

898
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,034
"FROM..."

899
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,335
"FROM VENTERATION --"

900
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,203
GENERATION.

901
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,805
"GENERATION TO GENERATION."

902
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,540
LIOR, YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB

903
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:56,613
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO
IT SLOWER AND LOUDER.

904
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,914
EVERY WORD.

905
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,649
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO READ IT?

906
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,252
A HUNDRED TIMES.

907
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:04,855
HUH?

908
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,626

BREATH.

917
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,374

00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,844

THAT WORD "FEEL."

930
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:43,894
THAT'S THE WORD
I NEED TO HEAR.

931
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,797
THE TORAH IS
IMPORTANT BECAUSE...

932
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,834
FOR DORSHEI DERECH BECAUSE IT
MAKES ME WANT TO DAVEN --

933
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,135
TOO FAST, SLOW IT DOWN.

934
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:55,605

VERY DRAMATIC.

963
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,777
IT'S A VERY DRAMATIC TIE?

964
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,681
CAN I SHOW YOU

965
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,548

00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,670
DID YOU TELL BRAHMA WHAT

972
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,405
WHAT ARE THESE SHOES FOR?

973
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,875
BRAHMA MIGHT NOT KNOW
WHAT A BAR MITZVAH IS.

974
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,044
WHAT A BAR MITZVAH IS?

975
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:08,478
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT?

976
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:09,346
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

977
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,948
TO BE
BAR MITZVAH IS...

978
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:12,816
I FORGOT.

979
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,683
- GO ON YOU, CAN TELL HIM.

980
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:14,551
I FORGOT, DAD.

981
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,286
COME ON, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

982
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:17,587

00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:19,756

00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:21,057
WHAT'S THE TORAH?

987
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,792
IT'S LIKE A BOOK.

988
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,094
OKAY.

989
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,130
AND WHAT DO YOU
FIND IN THAT BOOK?

990
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,733
IT'S A BOOK...DAD.

991
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:30,600
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

992
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,468
WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS IT?

993
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,769
WHAT'S ANOTHER
NAME FOR THE TORAH?

994
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,203
A SCROLL.

995
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:34,504
A SCROLL.

996
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:35,805
WHAT'S ANOTHER NAME --
WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS IT?

997
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:36,673
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT IT'S CALLED?

998
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:37,974
DAD...

999
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,709
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO
TEACH BRAHMA SOMETHING.

1000
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:40,577
YEAH.

1001
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,312
WHAT ELSE DO YOU LEARN ABOUT
WHEN YOU READ THE TORAH?

1002
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:43,179
DAD...

1003
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,481
WHEN YOU STUDYCHUMASH,

1004
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,650
WHAT ARE THE THINGS

1005
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,252
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE STORY?

1006
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,421
I DON'T KNOW!

1007
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,024
DAD...DADDY.

1008
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:54,891
YOU CAN DO THIS, COME ON.

1009
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,927
DADDY, I CAN'T DO IT.

1010
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:04,000
OKAY, LIOR, WALK AROUND
AND TELL ME HOW THEY FEEL.

1011
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:10,073
CONCENTRATE ON HOW
THE SHOE FEELS.

1012
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,894
HE CAN WANDER AROUND.

1013
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:49,546
HOW DO THEY FIT?

1014
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:50,847
THEY FIT REALLY GREAT!

1015
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,715
DO YOU LIKE THESE SHOES?

1016
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:52,582
YES, I DO.

1017
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:53,883
AND YOU WANT TO WEAR THESE
SHOES TO YOUR BAR MITZVAH?

1018
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:54,317
YES.

1019
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,052
OKAY.

1020
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,969
SHOULD WE GO
OVER THE SERVICE?

1021
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,704
OR YOU WANT TO JUST GO
THROUGH THE QUESTIONS?

1022
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,005
WE CAN DO THE SERVICE

1023
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,307
AND I'LL ASK QUESTIONS
WHEN WE GET TO THEM.

1024
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:21,644
I'LL JUST BE UP THERE
THROUGH THE END OF THESH'MA.

1025
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,380
SO YOU'RE DOING A PIECE
OF THESH'MAWITH LYNNE?

1026
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,115
I WANT TO DO
THESH'MAWITH YOU.

1027

YOU WANT TO DO
THESH'MAWITH ME?

OKAY.

1030
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,320
I PRAY FOR THIS TO BE A RITE OF
PASSAGE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY

1031
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,055
AND NOT JUST
THE BAR MITZVAH STUDENTS.

1032
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,224
CAN WE DO, INSTEAD
OF "AS WE BLESS"

1033
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,393
AND WE DO "WE ARE OPENING UP"?

1034
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:39,863
♪ WE ARE OPENING
UP TO SWEET SURRENDER... ♪

1035
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:43,333
I THINK THAT THE FAMILY
SPENT SO MUCH TIME

1036
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,369
TO REALLY THINK THIS
BAR MITZVAH THROUGH WELL.

1037
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:51,574
TO LIKE, DO IT WITH JUST
TREMENDOUS INTEGRITY AND TRUTH.

1038
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:57,647
WE WANT TO DOPITCHU LI, THAT
WAS DEVORA'S FAVORITE SONG.

1039
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:58,515
GOOD.

1040
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,551
I KNOW I'LL FEEL DEVORA'S
SPIRIT PRESENT THAT DAY,

1041
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:09,359
OF JUST LIKE YOU KNOW,
THE JOY OF A MOM, YOU KNOW?

1042
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,829
A JOY OF A MOM FOR HER SON.

1043
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:21,504
YOU KNOW, AND THE JOY OF, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, ALL THE PEOPLE THERE

1044
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,673

00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,842
AND REALLY LIVED
HER LIFE WITH

1046
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,445
AND ALSO DIED
WITH, YOU KNOW.

1047
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:37,554
MOMMY HAS TO GO AWAY FOR
A LITTLE WHILE TO THE HOSPITAL.

1048
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,289
BECAUSE MOMMY'S SICK.

1049
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,193
AND MOMMY HAS TO GO BECAUSE THE
DOCTORS WILL MAKE HER BETTER.

1050
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:47,964
SO, WHILE MOMMY GOES AWAY,
IF ANYBODY GETS SAD FOR MOMMY,

1051
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,567
THEY CAN HUG THEIR TEDDY BEARS.

00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,291
YOU CAN GIVE YOUR
TEDDY BEAR A BIG HUG.

1060
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,003
WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART

1061
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,606

1070
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:25,995
NO.

1071
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:29,032
APRIL FOOL'S.

1072
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,876
AND THAT'S IT.

1073
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:49,852
♪♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

1074
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:55,925

OH, MY GOD,
HE'S 13.

1077
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,336
IT MEANS LIOR'S GROWING UP.

1078
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,071
AND I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST
REALLY HARD FOR ME,

1079
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:10,673
JUST 'CAUSE I
DEFINITELY ASSOCIATE

1080
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:14,143
LIOR BEING YOUNGER,
AND MY MOM AND EVERYTHING.

1081
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:15,445
LIKE, I KINDA, SOMETIMES
I JUST THINK ABOUT THAT

1082
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,180
AS, LIKE, MY GOLDEN YEARS.

1083
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,782
JUST BECAUSE EVERYTHING
SEEMED SO PERFECT AND STUFF.

1084
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:24,120
WITH LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH,
THERE'S A NEW PHASE, I GUESS.

1085
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:29,325
JUST KINDA, MOVING
ON, FROM MY MOM.

1086
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,229
MOMMY!

1087
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:11,834
WHERE?

1088
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,437
RIGHT THERE.

1089
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,076
DEVORA.

1090
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:30,486
RIGHT.

1091
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:35,258
SEVEN YEARS AGO, TODAY.

1092
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,427
DO YOU THINK IT WAS A LONG
TIME AGO SINCE MOMMY DIED?

1093
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,294
NO.

1094
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,162
NO?

1095
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,029
ACTUALLY, YES.

1096
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:43,066
IN THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS,

1097
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:46,536
THE JEWISH WORLD AND THE WORLD
OF THE STARS AND THE PLANETS,

1098
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,271
SEVEN YEARS IS A FULL CYCLE.

1099
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:53,042
SO EVERY SEVEN YEARS, ALL THE
CELLS IN YOUR BODY ARE REPLACED.

1100
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,814
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU
WANT TO SAY TO MOMMY?

1101
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,850
BEFORE YOUR BAR MITZVAH?

1102
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:29,045

1103
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:29,912
YOU REALLY FEEL SAD?

1104
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,515
YEAH, IT'S OKAY TO
FEEL SAD, SWEETIE.

1105
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,853

01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,918
HE'S AN AMAZING GUY.

1145
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:32,822
THE MOMENT YOU MEET HIM,
SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART SAYS,

1146
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:38,027
"OH, HE'S GOT A GREAT HEART."

1147
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,907
OH, WOW, WOW.

1148
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:55,378

1149
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,113

PLEASE BE MY WIFE?

1156
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:20,536
WHEN WE, WHEN I GROW UP.

1157
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,705
WHEN HE GROWS UP.

1158
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,609
LIOR, TOMORROW YOU'RE GIVING

1159
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,645
YOUR BAR MITZVAH SPEECH
TO 300 PEOPLE.

1160
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,681
IF IT WAS MY BAT MITZVAH,
I'D BE REALLY NERVOUS.

1161
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,417

BUT WHAT IF I WAS AFRAID
I WAS GOING TO MESS UP?

1164
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:50,032
DON'T GO FAST, GO SLOW.

1165
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:54,370
WHAT IF I WAS NERVOUS?

1166
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,648

1190
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,186
YOU DIDN'T BRUSH
YOUR HAIR YET?

1191
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,523

1199
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:32,695
"CAN YOU IMAGINE

1200

WHAT HIS BAR MITZVAH
IS GOING TO BE LIKE?"

1201
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,900
I HEAR SOMEONE WHISPER.

1202
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:48,310
I ALSO WONDER WHAT
IT WILL BE LIKE.

1203
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,648
WILL HIS CHARMING, CHILDLIKE
INNOCENCE BE ABLE TO EVOLVE

1204
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:58,721
INTO MATURE FORMS
OF EXPRESSION?

1205
01:10:58,721 --> 01:10:59,588
WILL LIOR CONTINUE TO CREATE

1206
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:03,492
A PLACE FOR HIMSELF
IN THIS COMMUNITY?

HE'S FIGURING IT OUT HIMSELF.

1211
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:29,084
IT'S MY JOB TO SIT
BACK AND TRUST HIM.

1212
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:34,290
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

1213
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,326
IT FEELS GOOD.

NOT TOO MANY 13 YEAR OLDS

1223
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:31,113
LIOR HAS BEEN DAVENING WITH
US AND INSPIRING US TO DAVEN.

01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:24,466
HE'S JUST TOTALLY
RISEN TO THE OCCASION.

01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,768
HE IS JUST SO AMAZING.

1231
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:31,840
UH-OH, I THINK
THIS IS IT.

1232
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,908
REMEMBER TO LOOK UP
AND GO VERY SLOWLY

1233
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:17,246
AND SAY EACH WORD CLEARLY.

1234
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:18,981

BRING THE PAN OVER TO HERE.

1247
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,370
THERE YOU GO, PERFECT.

1248
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:10,612
REALLY?

1249
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,347
NOPE.

1250
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:31,433
YOU LOOK
SO DIFFERENT TO ME

1251
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,734
THAN YOU DID BEFORE.

1252
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:35,771
YOU'VE GOTTEN TALLER,
NOW YOU HAVE TO SHAVE.

1253
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:36,638
DO I LOOK DIFFERENT TO YOU?

1254
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:37,506
NO.

1255
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:38,373
I LOOK THE SAME?

1256
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:39,241
YEAH, YOU DO.

1257
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:40,976
I DON'T LOOK LIKE
I GOT ANY OLDER?

1258
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,277
NO.

1259
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,880
HOW CAN I TELL THAT
YOU'VE GOTTEN OLDER?

1260
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:14,376
TODAY WE'RE DOING A REVIEW.

1261

WE HAVE A TEST TOMORROW
AND IT'S ON EMOTIONAL HEALTH

1262
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,015
AND KIDS ARE PLAYING
A JEOPARDY GAME.

1263
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,316
YOU WANT TO TRY IT?

1264
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,051
HAVE A SEAT, LIOR.

1265
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:24,786

01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:29,124
BECOMING STRONG IN ONE AREA

1268
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:32,160
TO MAKE UP FOR A WEAKNESS
IN ANOTHER AREA.

1269
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,461
WHAT DO YOU THINK, ERICA?

1270
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:34,763
WHAT IS THAT CALLED?

1271
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,498

1273
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:38,667
YEAH.

1274
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,402
TAP IT OUT, YOU KNOW IT.

01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:45,173
YES!

1277
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,041
ALL RIGHT.

1278
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:58,620
OKAY, THIS ONE IS HOW A PERSON
FEELS ABOUT HIMSELF OR HERSELF.

1279
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,921
SELF-IMAGE.

1280
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:00,789
