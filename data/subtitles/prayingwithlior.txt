ARE YOU READY?
READY.
ARE YOU READY?
YEP.
READY?
READY.
TAKE TWO.
OKAY, SO WE'LL
MOVE BACK, OKAY?
A LITTLE MORE.
LIKE THIS.
A LITTLE MORE.
LIKE THIS.
TEENY BIT MORE.
A LITTLE BIT MORE.
LITTLE BIT MORE.
READY?
READY.
ACTION!
LIOR!
DO YOU WANT TO SING A SONG?
'KAY.
OKAY.
WHAT SONG WOULD
YOU LIKE TO SING?
WHICH ONE?
WHICH SONG DO YOU WANT, LIOR?
UP!
UP?
SHOULD WE DO "OPEN, SHUT THEM?"
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
YOU WANT TO DO "OLD MACDONALD?"
DO YOU WANT TO DO
"GRANDMA'S FARM?"
NO!
DO YOU WANT TO DO
"EENSY WEENSY SPIDER?"
NO?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SING?
SHOULD WE DO "SHALOM ALEICHEM?"
YES.
AH, READY?
I AM LUCKY.
I SUPPOSE MOST PEOPLE
DON'T THINK SO,
BUT WHEN I SIT BESIDE LIOR, AND
HE POURS HIS HEART OUT TO GOD,
I FEEL DEEPLY, DEEPLY BLESSED.
AND I AM MYSTIFIED ABOUT WHY
HE LOVES TO PRAY SO MUCH.
YAY!
YAY!
DAI DAI DAI.
DAI DAI DAI?
OKAY.
DID YOU GET THAT?
DID HE SAY YI DI DAI?
THERE ARE THOSE
SATURDAY MORNINGS
WHEN I ADMIT I WOULD
LOVE TO LIE IN BED.
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH TROUBLE
TO GET FOUR CHILDREN
OUT TO SYNAGOGUE.
I'M TIRED FROM THE PREVIOUS
WEEK'S CHEMOTHERAPY.
THERE ARE A LOT
OF GREAT EXCUSES.
BUT MOST OF THE TIME I CAN'T.
I GET THERE ON TIME
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MISS
DAVENING WITH LIOR.
WHEN HE LIFTS HIS VOICE WITH
UNWAVERING CLARITY,
HE GIVES EVERYONE IN THE ROOM
PERMISSION TO DO THE SAME.
"CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT HIS BAR
MITZVAH IS GOING TO BE LIKE?"
I HEAR SOMEONE WHISPER.
I FEEL A SURPRISINGLY STRONG
EMOTIONAL REACTION
TO THAT QUESTION.
I PRAY THAT GOD WILL
GRANT ME THE BLESSING
TO LIVE TO BE PART OF THAT DAY.
LIOR, IS YOUR LIFE
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
AFTER YOUR BAR MITZVAH?
IT IS.
REALLY?
YEAH.
HOW COME?
SO, YOU'LL GET
TO DRIVE A CAR?
man: I WANT YOU
TO TRY SOMETHING, OK?
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE
AT YOUR BAR MITZVAH
AFTER YOU READ FROM THE TORAH,
IT'S TIME FOR A...
A D'VAR TORAH, RIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO WRITE
A BAR MITZVAH SPEECH
ABOUT WHAT YOU LEARNED
IN THE TORAH.
AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
SOMETHING TO SAY, RIGHT?
YES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU WANT TO SAY?
I WANT YOU TO
IMAGINE, OKAY?
I DON'T WANT TO IMAGINE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO IMAGINE?
NO.
OKAY, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE GOING TO SAY?
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT?
YEAH.
IT TAKES A LONG TIME.
TO THINK ABOUT IT?
YEAH.
I'LL SIT HERE QUIETLY.
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT.
I'LL THINK A COUPLE OF DAYS.
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS?
YEAH.
SWEETIE, WE'VE STARTED TO DO
THIS A FEW TIMES BEFORE,
AND EVERY TIME WE START TO DO
IT, YOU SAY "PLEASE STOP."
WE CAN DO IT TOMORROW.
TOMORROW'S A SCHOOL DAY.
LET'S DO IT FRIDAY NIGHT.
FIRST LET'S JUST DO IT FOR
A FEW MORE MINUTES NOW, OKAY?
'KAY, THAT'S ALL.
OKAY.
IF YOU ACT IN THE RIGHT WAY...
YEAH?
...THAT MEANS THAT GOOD
THINGS WILL HAPPEN SOMETIMES,
THAT YOU'LL
GET BLESSINGS.
WHEN WE GOT
THE OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS
THAT LIOR HAD DOWN SYNDROME,
DEVORA AND I,
WE CRIED A LOT.
WE WERE MOURNING HOPE,
MOURNING POSSIBILITY.
YOU HAVE EXPECTATIONS
FOR A CHILD AROUND
SUCCESS OR ACHIEVEMENT --
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO
BE DIFFERENT SOMEHOW,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
DO YOU WANT TO SAY BLESSINGS
FOR YOUR TWO SISTERS?
YEAH.
AND YOUR TWO BROTHERS?
HUH?
TWO OF THE CUTE BABIES.
CUTE BABIES?
TWO.
WHO ARE TWO CUTE BABIES?
I'M GONNA GET TWO.
YOU ARE GOING TO
GET TWO CUTE BABIES?
YEAH.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO
GET TWO CUTE BABIES?
DADDY, STOP!
NO, DADDY!
PLEASE, STOP!
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A DADDY SOME DAY?
I'M GOING TO BE YOU.
DO YOU THINK I'M A GOOD DAD?
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO WHEN I'M A DAD?
GUESS WHAT, I'M GOING
TO WATCH SOME MORE TELEVISION!
YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH MORE
TELEVISION WHEN YOU'RE A DAD?
YES!
HE AIN'T STUPID.
HE'S RETARDED.
IT'S DIFFERENT, HE'S NOT STUPID.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HIS ULTIMATE
CAPABILITIES ARE GOING TO BE.
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT REASONABLE
EXPECTATIONS ARE,
AND WHEN YOU'RE PUSHING
HIM TOO HARD AND WHEN NOT.
IT'S VERY UNCLEAR.
HI, MY BOY!
LOOK AT YOU!
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME
SO YOU PUT ON A TIE?
YOU NEED A HAIRCUT,
IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS LONG
SINCE HE WAS LITTLE,
SINCE HE WAS
A LITTLE FROG BABY.
LIOR, YOU LOOKED LIKE
A LITTLE FROG.
I'M GLAD I'M HOME, TOO.
LIOR'S MY BROTHER,
BUT HE'S ALSO LIKE MY CHILD.
LIKE I HELPED HIM GROW UP.
LIKE I WAS TAKING CARE
OF HIM AND BABYSITTING.
UM, SINCE I WAS
LIKE TEN YEARS OLD.
NO WAY!
IS YOUR BIRTHDAY
COMING UP SOON, TOO?
YES!
THIS YEAR!
NO WAY!
YES!
LIOR, YOU HAVE SO MANY BOOGERS
IN YOUR NOSE RIGHT NOW.
YOU DON'T NEED BRACES?
OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW.
YES, OF COURSE.
LIOR!
WHAT?
THAT WASN'T NICE.
NO, HE DIDN'T.
NO, HE DIDN'T, LIOR.
LIOR.
APRIL FOOL'S!
LIOR, YOU ARE SUCH A FIBBER.
APRIL FOOL'S IS EVERY DAY.
FOR YOU IT IS BECAUSE
YOU'RE SUCH A FIBBER.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT ONLY
THIS YEAR IT'S EVERY DAY.
THIS YEAR IT'S EVERY DAY?
WHAT MAKES THIS YEAR SPECIAL?
BECAUSE, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY
AND MY BAR MITZVAH!
OH.
LIOR HAS BEEN TALKING
ABOUT HIS BAR MITZVAH
SINCE MY BAT MITZVAH.
MY DAD HAS BEEN THINKING
ABOUT LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH
SINCE LIOR WAS BORN.
HE'S GOING TO BE SHOWING OFF HIS
KID, HIS LITTLE BOY.
HIS LITTLE BOY
WITH DOWN SYNDROME
IS HAVING A BAR MITZVAH.
I ASKED LIOR,
DO YOU THINK ANYTHING THAT YOU
SEE IN THE WORLD IS NOT FAIR?
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY.
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO GIVE HIM
EXAMPLES, AND IT WAS JUST,
ITS HARD FOR HIM TO
ENGAGE IN THAT, AND THEN --
OOH!
ALMOST A SCORE.
ALMOST A TOUCHBACK, ALMOST.
WHAT'S YOUR EXPECTATION?
THAT HE SHOULD TALK FOR...?
MY EXPECTATION IS THAT HE SHOULD
TALK FOR FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES.
I THINK YOU SHOULD
SHOOT FOR ONE MINUTE.
I'M SERIOUS!
I MEAN, MY HEART'S DESIRE
WOULD BE FOR HIM TO SPEND
A FEW MINUTES TALKING
ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE DOWN SYNDROME.
RIGHT.
YOU GO TO THOSE
DOWN SYNDROME CONFERENCES
AND THERE ARE THESE
AMAZING 20, 25-YEAR-OLD
YOUNG ADULTS WITH DOWN SYNDROME
WHO ARE, LIKE, PROUD
AND SELF-ADVOCATES.
BUT THE STARTING POINT IS THEY
KNOW THEY HAVE DOWN SYNDROME
AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT.
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD --
DOES HE THINK ABOUT THAT?
DOES HE TALK ABOUT THAT?
DOES HE KNOW HE'S DIFFERENT?
THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT SURE.
I THINK ITS AN EMERGING -
WHY DON'T YOU RATHER HAVE HIM
TALK ABOUT WHAT GOD IS TO HIM
AND WHAT DOES --
I'VE TRIED --
SO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE HEALTHY
FOR HIM TO KNOW HE'S DIFFERENT.
YEAH, I THINK IT'S HEALTHY FOR
HIM TO KNOW HE'S DIFFERENT.
BECAUSE?
WELL, IN PART,
BECAUSE HE EXPERIENCES
A LOT OF FRUSTRATION.
HE SAYS, "DADDY, IT HARD TO --
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T THINK."
OR, "DADDY, IT'S HARD TO THINK."
YEAH.
WHOA.
MISSED.
WHOA.
THAT'S WHY I TELL YOU, IT'S
GOING TO BE A CLOSE GAME.
THEY HAVE A REALLY
GOOD DEFENSE, CAROLINA...
interviewer: SO LIOR, THIS
MAY BE A HARD QUESTION.
WHAT DOES DOWN SYNDROME MEAN?
WELL, WHAT'S DOWN SYNDROME
AND UP SYNDROME, WHAT ARE THEY?
THEY'RE OPPOSITES.
OKAY.
APRIL FOOL'S.
YOU CHEATER!
GAME POINT LIOR,
THIS IS BIG.
WHO'S GOING TO WIN?
I KIND OF REMEMBER BEING TOLD HE
HAD AN EXTRA 21st CHROMOSOME
AND HE WAS GOING TO BE SLOWER.
BUT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
DOWN SYNDROME MEANT,
SO, IT WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE
HOW I LOOKED AT HIM,
TALKED TO HIM, ANYTHING.
HE WAS THE CUTEST LITTLE
THING I'VE EVER SEEN
AND HE WAS JUST
SO FUNNY LOOKING.
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO BE STEREOTYPICAL
TO ASIAN PEOPLE AND STUFF,
BUT HIS EYES WERE VERY SLANTY
AND HE JUST HAD THIS
FUNNY LITTLE FACE
THAT KINDA JUST REMINDED
YOU OF A FROG,
SO WE WOULD CALL
HIM A CHINESE FROG.
I BEAT YOU.
I'M THE CHAMPION.
NO, I'M CHAMPION.
WE'LL WRESTLE FOR IT.
IF I WIN, I'M CHAMPION.
WHAT IF I WIN?
THEN YOU'RE CHAMPION.
OKAY.
CHAMPION!
YOU'RE THE CHAMPION.
IF YOU GET A STAIN ON IT,
YOU WON'T EVER BE ABLE TO WEAR
IT AGAIN AS A DRESS SHIRT.
THERE'S NO REASON TO WEAR A
WHITE DRESS SHIRT FOR DINNER
WHEN THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT
IT IS GOING TO GET STAINED
SO I WILL COME UP WITH YOU...
LIOR, YOU NEED TO WALK
UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU --
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN WEAR THE SHIRT
IF YOU WEAR AN APRON.
THOSE ARE YOUR CHOICES.
OKAY.
Mordechai: WHAT SONG
DO YOU WANT TO SING?
♪ WE'RE MOVING
INTO SHABBOS TIME ♪
WE'RE READY, GUYS.
GOOD SHABBOS, SWEETIE.
IT'S A GOOD THING WE GOT
YOU LIOR, WE NEED YOU!
WE NEED YOUR PRESENCE
IN THIS WORLD!
I KNOW, I KNOW.
GOOD SHABBOS.
HEY, GOOD SHABBOS, LIOR.
I THINK REENA SHOULD
MAKE KIDDUSH,
BECAUSE REENA'S BEEN
AWAY FOR A LONG TIME.
I'LL DO IT, I WANT
TO DO IT FOR REENA.
NO.
I WANT TO DO IT FOR REENA.
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER,
WE'LL DO IT --
I WANT TO START.
LIOR, YOU NEED TO COOPERATE.
NO, I DON'T.
YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE WANTING IT
ALL TO BE YOUR WAY.
I WANT TO START.
YOU CAN START AND THEN WE
CAN ALL DO IT TOGETHER.
♪ AMEN ♪
L'CHAIM!
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIGURED OUT?
YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO WRITE
NEXT FOR YOUR BAR MITZVAH?
WHAT?
THE CANDLE LIGHTING?
YOUR CANDLE LIGHTING!
YAY!
LIOR?
WHO GETS A CANDLE?
LIOR, DO I GET
MY OWN CANDLE?
EVERY SIBLING GETS
THEIR OWN CANDLE.
NO!
THAT'S HOW EVERYONE
ELSE DOES IT!
WAIT.
THE LOBBYING BEGINS!
PLEASE STOP, PLEASE.
IS FOR REENA.
NO.
NO.
YES.
MOMMY.
WHAT MOMMY?
WHAT MOMMY?
MOMMY DEVORA.
SHE STILL GETS A CANDLE.
YOU JUST LIGHT IT FOR HER.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVEN THOUGH MOMMY DEVORA DIED,
ON YOUR BAR MITZVAH CAKE,
YOU'LL LIGHT A CANDLE
FOR MOMMY DEVORA.
YEAH, I WILL.
OKAY, REENA DID IT,
AND YONI DID IT,
YOU'LL HAVE ONE CANDLE
THAT'S SPECIAL FOR MOMMY.
RIGHT.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE GONE THROUGH...
LYNNE'S VERY
DIFFERENT FROM MY MOM,
SO ITS HARD TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE
RAISING MY SIBLINGS,
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE LIOR
KIND OF TAKES AFTER MY MOM MORE
THAN ANY OF THE REST OF US.
LET'S REPEAT!
WELL, I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
AND I WOULD JUST
SEE LIOR PRAYING,
JUST DAVENING HIS HEART OUT
AND PRAYING LIKE CRAZY.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF A GOD DOES EXIST OR NOT,
BUT IF THERE IS A GOD,
THEN LIOR IS DEFINITELY CLOSER
TO GOD THAN ANYBODY ELSE I KNOW.
THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE
THAT LIOR IS CLOSER TO GOD
IS THE SENSE THAT
HE HAS LESS VEILS
BETWEEN HIM, YOU KNOW,
AND THE WORLD.
BETWEEN HIM, YOU KNOW, AND GOD.
LIOR, WHAT DO YOU THINK
GOD LOOKS LIKE?
WELL, DOES GOD HAVE
A COLOR OR A SMELL?
NO.
DOES GOD LOOK LIKE A PERSON?
NO.
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK GOD
LISTENS TO THE MOST?
IS THAT WHY YOU LIKE
TO DO IT SO MUCH?
YEAH.
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?
THAT'S A VERY
INTERESTING IDEA.
NO.
IT'S NOT INTERESTING?
LIOR!
OKAY, LIOR,I'M TAKING
ANNA SOMEWHERE
AND YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME, SWEETHEART.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
WE'RE TAKING ANNA
TO ROSA'S HOUSE.
LIOR, I NEED
YOU TO COOPERATE.
WHEN I CAME INTO
THIS FAMILY, SIX YEARS AGO,
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
TO HAVE A CHILD
WITH DOWN SYNDROME.
COME ON.
COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE
IS I DON'T THINK
HE'S HANDICAPPED.
AND I HAVE TO
SOMETIMES REALIZE
THAT HE IS A CHILD THAT
HAS DOWN SYNDROME,
HE IS A CHILD THAT IS SLOWER.
SOMETIMES HE SEEMS TO WANTS
TO JUST STAY REALLY
CUTE AND LOVEABLE.
AND I'M TRYING TO LET HIM KNOW,
AS HE COMES TO BE A BAR MITZVAH,
THAT HE CAN BE
LOVABLE AND MATURE.
LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH
GETS REALLY ANNOYING.
FIRST OF ALL, EVERYBODY
DOESN'T PAY ATTENTION TO ME.
LIKE, SINCE I'M THE YOUNGEST,
PEOPLE WOULD THINK I WOULD
GET THE MOST ATTENTION,
BUT SINCE
LIOR HAS DOWN SYNDROME,
HE BASICALLY GETS
THE MOST ATTENTION,
SO IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING.
SOMETIMES LIOR'S
REALLY EMBARRASSING.
HE SAYS RANDOM THINGS
SOMETIMES TO HIMSELF.
PEOPLE LOOK AT HIM
FUNNY AND STUFF.
I GUESS THEY'RE JUST THINKING
HE'S A WEIRDO OR SOMETHING.
LIOR,
DOES HAVING DOWN SYNDROME,
AND HAVING SPECIAL NEEDS,
DOES THAT MAKE YOU DIFFERENT
THAN OTHER KIDS YOUR AGE?
YES.
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?
WHAT, I DIDN'T HEAR WHAT YOU
SAID, "YOU HANG OUT" WHAT?
I HANG OUT FOR ONCE IN A WHILE.
YOU HANG OUT ONCE IN A WHILE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
BOY, IF EVERYBODY HAD
THE SOCIAL SKILLS OF THIS KID,
WE'D ALL GO AROUND
SMILING ALL THE TIME.
HEY, LIOR.
CAN YOU SAY HI?
DEVORA USED TO
SAY, "BOY, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE REALLY FORTUNATE THAT
LIOR HAD DOWN SYNDROME,
AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER MALADY."
OH, ANNA,
THAT'S A TEASE.
'CAUSE DOWN SYNDROME,
WHILE IT CERTAINLY
HAS ITS CHALLENGES,
THIS IS A KID WHO CAN CONNECT.
AND THAT MEANT SO
MUCH TO DEVORA,
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT
HER LIFE WAS ALL ABOUT,
WAS ABOUT CONNECTION.
AFTER DEVORA DIED, I REMEMBER
SPENDING TIME WITH MORDECHAI,
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
LIOR SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL.
I REMEMBER TALKING WITH
THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL
WHERE THERE'S
AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM
FOR KIDS WITH DOWN SYNDROME.
AND I SAID "WELL, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE CONSIDERING AN ORTHODOX
JEWISH DAY SCHOOL."
AND THIS MAN SAID TO ME,
"THAT'S WHERE HE SHOULD GO."
AND THIS PERSON
WASN'T EVEN JEWISH!
HE SAID, "AT OUR SCHOOL, WE'LL
MAXIMIZE HIS READING LEVEL,
AND HIS MATH LEVEL, BUT THAT'S
NOT WHAT THIS LITTLE BOY NEEDS.
IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT THIS BOY
NEEDS IS TRADITION, AND RITUAL,
AND A COMMUNITY THAT'S
GOING TO EMBRACE HIM."
WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU
ARRIVE LATE TOMINCHA
AND THEMINYANIS ALREADY
DAVENINGSH'MONEH ESRAI?
WHAT'S THE THING YOU SHOULD DO?
YES?
DAVENSH'MONEH ESRAI
RIGHT WITH THEM.
WHAT IS THE LAST
T'FILAHOFMINCHA?
NOPE.
SHAUL COHEN?
WHAT?
ALEINUIS RIGHT.
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF COMING TO DAVENING
IS NOT TO HEARKIDUSHAH
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
IS TO DAVEN WITH PEOPLE
THESH'MONEH ESRAITOGETHER.
OKAY, UH, LIOR.
LIOR, HE DAVENS, LIKE,
OFF KEY, BUT IT'S GOOD.
SOME PEOPLE, THEY LIKE,
DO BATTING SCORES OF
THE PHILLIES GAME OR STUFF,
HE JUST DAVENS, HE JUST
DAVENS, THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.
LIKE FOR ME, IT'S EASY.
I CAN JUST SIT THERE
AND JUST SAY THE WORDS.
FOR HIM, HE HAS DOWN SYNDROME
AND IT'S NOT AS EASY.
AND HE HAS TO STRIVE TO DO IT.
IT COUNTS DOUBLE.
LIOR, IS GOD LISTENING
WHEN YOU DAVEN?
DOES GOD LISTEN
WHEN YOUR DAD PRAYS?
YES!
DOES GOD LISTEN
WHEN ANNA PRAYS?
NOT -- NO.
HOW COME GOD LISTENS
WHEN YOUR DAD PRAYS
AND NOT WHEN ANNA PRAYS?
I WANT TO DAVEN AT
YOUR BAR MITZVAH.
COULD YOU TEACH ME HOW?
CUT CUT CUT!
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED
TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE INVITATION LIST.
AND WHAT DO WE
WANT IT TO SAY?
"IN HONOR OF
LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH...
WE'D BE PLEASED IF
YOU MADE A DONATION
TO THE SPECIAL ED PROGRAM.
LIOR'S SPECIAL ED PROGRAM.
YEAH, LIOR'S SPECIAL ED PROGRAM.
LIOR'S SPECIAL ED PROGRAM."
OKAY.
HEY!
HE GOT IT!
IS IT HERE?
OH, NO.
OH, NO, NO YOU DON'T, NO!
NO.
WHERE IS MY SHOE?
NO!
NO, NO!
GET OUT!
I'D BETTER FIND IT,
I'D BETTER.
WAY TO GO, LIOR!
GOOD JOB.
TUCK YOUR SHIRT IN, BABY.
I'VE HAD A KID
IN LITTLE LEAGUE
FOR THIRTEEN YEARS OR SO.
LIOR GREW UP SEEING REENA
DO IT AND YONI DO IT
AND SO, WHEN HE WAS THAT AGE,
HE WANTED TO DO IT.
WHAT IS RULE NUMBER ONE?
GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP.
CHEER EACH OTHER ON.
LET'S GO JULIA, LET'S GO...
IF THE BALL IS UP
HERE DO YOU SWING?
NO!
IF THE BALL IS DOWN
HERE DO YOU SWING?
NO!
MY MAIN CONCERN IN
THESE GAMES IS THAT
THE BALL IS GONNA
COME RIGHT TO HIM
AND HE'S GONNA DROP IT,
AND THE OTHER TEAM
IS GONNA SCORE A RUN,
OR IF HE'S GONNA STRIKE
OUT WITH, YOU KNOW,
BASES LOADED
AND THEY'RE ONE RUN DOWN.
IF YOU HIT THE BALL DO YOU LOOK
AT THE BALL OR DO YOU RUN?
I RUN.
DO YOU LOOK AT THE BALL?
I RUN.
YOU HIT THE BALL
AND THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS --
RUN.
RIGHT.
YOU RUN.
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN
YOU HIT THE BALL?
RUN.
I WANT TO HEAR LIOR'S NAME.
LET'S GO, LIOR!
BASES LOADED!
LIOR, TAKE A COUPLE
PRACTICE SWINGS.
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO!
LIOR'S OUR GOOD HITTER!
COME ON, MAN!
JUST LIKE IN PRACTICE,
COME ON!
LET'S GO,
LIOR, LET'S GO!
THAT'S RIGHT.
GO, LIOR!
BASES LOADED!
WATCH THE BALL ALL
THE WAY IN, YOU CAN DO IT.
SWING ONLY AT STRIKES, LIOR.
ONLY AT STRIKES.
LIOR, WHAT'S
YOUR STRIKE ZONE?
LIOR, WHAT'S YOUR
STRIKE ZONE?
YOUR KNEES TO YOUR CHEST.
COME ON, LIOR!
GOOD TRY, LIOR!
GOOD TRY!
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN DO IT, DAVID.
THROW STRIKES, DJ!
LIOR!
PAY ATTENTION!
PAY ATTENTION, LIOR!
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
LOSE THIS GAME.
LET'S PUT IT LIKE THIS.
I'M NOT GIVING UP HOPE YET
BECAUSE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
SECOND BASE.
THAT'S RIGHT, FORCE AT
SECOND BASE YOU GUYS.
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO GO!
LIOR!
GAME'S OVER, SWEETIE.
GAME'S OVER, SWEETIE.
I THINK MY DAD AND LYNNE
PUSH LIOR TOO HARD SOMETIMES.
HE NEEDS, LIKE, SOMEONE TO KINDA
BE LIKE THE CRUTCH FOR HIM,
JUST TO HELP HIM,
LIKE, GET ALONG.
AND KINDA JUST TEACH HIM
WHAT'S APPROPRIATE
OR BASEBALL AND SCHOOL WORK.
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY JOB.
'CAUSE ME AND HIM ARE
LIKE BEST FRIENDS.
AND WITHOUT ME AROUND,
HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
A CLOSE FRIEND ANYMORE.
LIOR, I HAVE TO WRITE A PAPER.
CAN YOU WRITE IT FOR ME?
YEAH.
OKAY.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT?
IT'S ABOUT GAY MARRIAGES.
DO YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON IT?
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY?
HI.
YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE.
I SHOULD DO SOMETHING ELSE?
YEAH.
WHY, THAT'S BORING?
YEAH.
I CAN'T,
I WISH I COULD.
REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME
I WROTE ABOUT YOU?
YEAH.
REMEMBER THAT PAPER?
YEAH.
COULD YOU DO IT AGAIN?
COULD I WRITE ABOUT YOU AGAIN?
YEAH.
NO, I JUST TOLD
YOU I CAN'T.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO COME TO MY SCHOOL?
YOU CAN COME FOR MY GRADUATION.
YOU'LL BE THERE WHEN I
GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL?
YEP.
WHERE SHOULD I GO TO COLLEGE?
GUESS WHAT.
WHAT?
I'M COMING WITH YOU.
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME WHERE?
YOU'RE GOING TO GO
TO COLLEGE WITH ME?
NO, YOU CAN'T!
GOODNIGHT, LIOR.
GOODNIGHT, MAMA LYNNE.
GOODNIGHT, LIOR.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT IDEA?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?
WHY?
REALLY?
HER SPIRIT IS
GOING TO COME BACK?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT WILL BE LIKE?
SO LIOR, YOU THINK ALL
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN
AT YOUR BAR MITZVAH?
YEAH.
SO YOU THINK THE MESSIAH
IS GOING TO COME
AND YOUR MOTHER'S SPIRIT
IS GONNA COME BACK?
YEAH.
ON THE DAY, OR A FEW
DAYS AFTERWARDS, OR WHEN?
OKAY, LIOR TAKE
A PENCIL, PLEASE.
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO GO
ON TO EMERGENCY WORDS.
OKAY LIOR, START FOR US.
VERY GOOD.
LEORA.
OKAY.
OKAY.
BUT YOU ARE WHAT?
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE RIDING.
YOU'RE RIDING.
OKAY, IN?
OR WHAT ELSE?
YOU COULD BE IN A CAR,
BUT YOU COULD BE IN WHAT ELSE?
A VAN.
AH, WHAT ELSE?
THINK PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
SO, WHAT'S PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION?
AN AIRPLANE.
IT COULD BE IN AN AIRPLANE.
VERY GOOD.
OKAY, NEXT ONE.
CAN YOU TELL ME
A LIVING THING PLEASE?
YES, MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO.
MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO?
YES.
WELL, MONKEYS ARE
LIVING THINGS.
OKAY.
GOD MAKES EVERY PERSON WITH
A DIFFERENT TEST IN THIS WORLD.
SO, GOD'S TEST PROBABLY
FOR LIOR IS MAYBE,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,
BUT MAYBE WITH DOWN SYNDROME,
HE THINKS LIOR CAN PROBABLY
WITHSTAND THIS KIND OF TEST.
HASHEM JUST WANTED
HIM TO BE LIKE THAT.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD'S DOING.
WHEN GOD MADE LIOR
HAVING DOWN SYNDROME,
IT ALSO BECOMES A TEST
TO US, HOW WE TREAT LIOR,
IF WE DO THINGS WITH LIOR,
THAT'S PART OF OUR TEST.
LIOR!
HIKE!
AARON!
YEAH?
MY DAD SAY THAT TO ME.
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
WHO'S THE BOSS?
YOU.
HUH?
YOU.
RIGHT.
ME AND YOU ARE THE BOSSES.
HE DID?
YES.
YOU GUYS ARE GETTING TOO OLD.
I'M SO YOUNG THAT I CAN'T
EVEN BELIEVE IT.
WHAT?
52...OR 60.
WHEN I'M GOING TO
BE 100, I'M GOING TO RETIRE
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU THE BARBERSHOP.
IT'LL BE YOUR SHOP,
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.
YEAH, BUT YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM.
WE'LL HAVE TO
CHANGE SOME RULES.
WHY?
SATURDAYS, SEE.
NOT GOOD FOR YOU.
WHY?
WELL, WHY?
WHY DO YOU THINK?
RIGHT.
SO YOU CAN OPEN ON
WEDNESDAYS 'CAUSE I CLOSE.
YOU CAN CALL
IT YOUR NAME, TOO,
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE DON'S ANYMORE.
AND IT WILL BE
YOUR BARBERSHOP.
A BOOK?
YOU HAVE A BOOK
ON YOUR HEAD.
WHERE'S IT AT?
YOU HAVE A BOOK ON YOUR HEAD.
THANKS, YONI.
WHAT DID YOU GUYS
BUY ME FOR LUNCH?
GET OUTTA HERE.
DID YOU READ
THIS ARTICLE
THAT THE SIXERS
ARE SINKING FAST?
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S OBVIOUS.
THAT'S THE GAME THAT WE
SHOULD HAVE WENT TO LIOR.
"SHOULD HAVE GONE TO."
TEACH HIM HOW TO SPEAK
CORRECTLY, PLEASE.
IT'S THE GAME WE SHOULD
HAVE WENT TO LAST NIGHT.
YONI --
WHAT?
TEACH HIM HOW TO
SPEAK CORRECTLY.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
"SHOULD HAVE GONE TO,"
NOT "SHOULD HAVE WENT TO."
SHOULD HAVE GONE TO.
SOMETIMES, I JUST GET SO MAD AT
MY DAD BECAUSE, I'M LIKE,
"THIS ISN'T MY JOB."
LIKE HOW HE ASKS
ME TO PARENT LIOR
WHEN, AT TIMES, IT'S NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO TEACH HIM
RIGHT AND WRONG
AND WHAT HE SHOULD
AND SHOULD NOT BE DOING.
WHAT'S BOONDOCK
HAVE TO SAY TODAY?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IF YOU WANT TO READ IT YOU
CAN READ IT ON YOUR OWN TIME.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT COLLEGE.
I DON'T THINK I COULD BE
ANYWHERE THAT'S FAR FROM LIOR,
JUST BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO
SEE HIM ON A REGULAR BASIS.
LIKE I COULDN'T BE SOMEPLACE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY
WHERE I WOULD SEE HIM, YOU KNOW,
ONCE EVERY COUPLE
MONTHS 'CAUSE THAT JUST,
I MEAN, THAT WOULD
BE TOO HARD FOR ME.
IT'S FOR PROM.
OH.
WOULD YOU LIKE A BAG?
YES, PLEASE.
WANT TO SIT IN THE FRONT?
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
I'D PROBABLY
END UP BEING
IN THE NORTHEAST
PART OF THE COUNTRY
FOR I GUESS MY ENTIRE
LIFE PROBABLY, JUST 'CAUSE...
LIOR'S HERE.
IN MY ROOM.
YONI?
LIOR?
CAN I PLAY?
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
YOU WANNA DO
THE PRACTICE MODE?
NO.
NO?
YOU WANNA PLAY THE GAME?
YEAH.
OKAY, DON'T GO OFF SIDES.
YOU'RE OFF SIDES.
ALL RIGHT, TACKLE.
NICE.
WHAT QUARTER?
SECOND QUARTER.
HA!
PERFECT!
YOU'RE GOING FOR
A FIELD GOAL BLOCK, LIOR?
NO.
YES, YOU ARE.
YES, I AM.
DON'T GO OFF SIDES...
UH-OH, IT'S...
NO GOOD!
NO GOOD!
BIG PLAY.
PERFECT PASS!
IT WAS NICE PLAY, THOUGH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE PANTS?
LIOR?
LIOR, LIOR?
LI-OOR?
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MY PANTS?
LIOR, DID YOU EVEN LOOK?
TOUCHDOWN?
YOU SCORED?
YES.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
GOOD!
OH, NO.
NO!
YES!
PERFECT!
YES.
OKAY.
IT'S HALFTIME.
TELL ME WHAT
YOU THINK, LIOR.
LIOR?
GOOD.
LIOR --
YOU LOOK...
NOW YOU LOOK GOOD.
AND DO NOT LET ANYONE
TO TOUCH YOUR HAIR.
DON'T LET ANYONE TOUCH IT.
DON'T LET ANYONE
TOUCH MY HAIR?
NO.
AND DON'T EVEN MESS IT UP.
MESS ME UP?
THERE YOU GO, LET ME SEE.
I'M FEELING ALMOST SAD,
BITTERSWEET ABOUT
THIS BAR MITZVAH
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE HIGHLIGHT OF HIS LIFE
FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OR MORE.
LIOR THINKS HE'S
GOING TO GROW UP
AND DRIVE A CAR AND HAVE
A BABY AND GET MARRIED.
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE
THAT THEY CAN'T DO THAT?
ESPECIALLY SOMEONE
WHO PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO
EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT.
HIGH FUNCTIONING TEENAGERS
WITH DOWN SYNDROME
CAN BE PRETTY UNHAPPY.
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT
THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED.
THEY DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS.
I AM JUST SO CONCERNED ABOUT
HIM BEING SAD AND LONELY.
I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
HIM ENCOUNTERING A WORLD
THAT'S TOO CONFUSING.
AND ENCOUNTERING PEOPLE THAT
JUST DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN PART OF
A COMMUNITY THAT'S KNOWN HIM.
LIOR'S REALLY THIS
LITTLE SPIRITUAL MASTER.
HE'S SO CLEARLY
IN RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD
WHEN HE'S DAVENING.
THAT'S THE GOAL THAT
I WANT TO REACH.
WHEN MY MIND IS WANDERING
AND GOING ASTRAY,
I JUST TAKE ONE LOOK AT LIOR
AND I GET RIGHT BACK ON TRACK.
SOMEHOW, HE TURNED
THE LEARNING INTO A DANCE,
INSTEAD OF A STRUGGLE.
THE ZOHAR TELLS OF STORIES
OF MIRACLE CHILDREN
WHO ARE SPIRITUAL,
YOU KNOW, GENIUSES.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT LIOR IS.
I HAVE
AN ALTERNATIVE
TO THE "LIOR IS A REBBE"
SPIRITUAL POINT OF VIEW.
HE GREW UP IN
A COMMUNITY IN WHICH,
EVERY TIME HE OPENED HIS
MOUTH WITH A HEBREW PRAYER,
BEAMING FACES RESPONDED.
HAD HE BEEN LIVING IN
A COMMUNITY WHERE, YOU KNOW,
CHRISTMAS CAROLS WERE
THE ORDER OF THE DAY,
HE WOULD BE DOING
CHRISTMAS CAROLS.
I'M CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE
PROJECT TOO MUCH ONTO HIM,
OR EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM HIM,
OR WANT THINGS FROM HIM
THAT HE'S REALLY NOT
ABLE TO GIVE THEM.
HE'S NOT A REBBE,
HE IS NOT A CONSCIOUS SPIRITUAL
TEACHER IN THAT SENSE.
HE IS A LOVING CHILD.
SO FAR, WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT --
BLESSINGS.
BLESSINGS, RIGHT.
SINCE THIS IS PART
OF YOUR D'VAR TORAH,
WHAT KIND OF LESSONS DO
WE LEARN FROM THE TORAH?
CAN YOU SAY?
THEN WHY IS IT IMPORTANT
TO STUDY THE TORAH?
OKAY, BUT WHAT DOES
THE TORAH TEACH US?
COMMUNITY, OKAY.
THE COMMUNITY, IN
THIS SORT OF LIFE,
AND WE DO IT IN OUR HEARTS.
I DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW
THAT, YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN?
IT SOUNDED VERY GOOD,
BUT I NEED YOU TO SAY IT AGAIN
SO I UNDERSTAND IT BETTER.
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD,
THAT SOUNDS VERY SMART.
YOU LIKE THAT?
YEAH.
OH, GOOD, OKAY.
I BET THERE'S MORE
YOU COULD THINK OF
BECAUSE THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
IN, AND THEN, IF YOU READ
THE TORAH IT GIVES US THE --
IT GOES FROM GENERATION
TO GENERATION.
SO THE TORAH GOES FROM
GENERATION, AND WHAT HAPPENS?
SO, NOW I HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
GENERATION MEANS?
NO.
"GENERATION TO GENERATION"
MEANS FROM GREAT-GRANDPARENTS,
TO GRANDPARENTS,
TO PARENTS, TO CHILDREN,
EVERY --
YOU'VE DEFINITELY LISTENED
TO TOO MANY SERMONS
IN YOUR LIFE ABOUT COMMUNITY.
...IN EVERY STEP.
IN EVERY STEP.
HALLELUJAH!
I WILL ADDRESS ENVELOPES,
AND YOU CAN FILL THEM...
YEAH.
NEXT PLEASE?
FOUR TO TWO.
HIS NAMELIOR
MEANS "MY LIGHT."
HE'S A LIGHT FOR US
AND FOR MANY OTHER PEOPLE.
KIND OF LIKE A SPOTLIGHT
ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT.
GOOD.
I GET THAT, FOR LIOR, DAVENING
WITH ME IS A CONNECTION TO...
UM...
TO THE MOMMY PART.
TO MATERNAL ENERGY.
SHE BROUGHT THESE
CHILDREN INTO THIS WORLD.
SHE GAVE THEM A CERTAIN
BEGINNING OF THEIR LIFE.
AND NOW, I'M PARENTING THEM.
AND IT'S A VERY AWESOME
KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY.
SO LIOR, THE D'VAR TORAH IS ALL
THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID TO ME,
THEY'RE ALL YOUR WORDS.
I PUT THEM IN AN ORDER,
SO ONE FOLLOWS THE OTHER.
OKAY?
OKAY.
SO THIS IS IT, AND LET
ME HEAR YOU SAY IT.
"THE TORAH GOES
FROM VENTERATION --"
"FROM..."
"FROM VENTERATION --"
GENERATION.
"GENERATION TO GENERATION."
LIOR, YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO
IT SLOWER AND LOUDER.
EVERY WORD.
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO READ IT?
A HUNDRED TIMES.
HUH?
WELL, THIS WOULD BE ONE,
SO IT WOULD BE 99 MORE.
OKAY, SAY IT.
IT'S YOUR SPEECH.
NOT AGAIN.
OH, YEAH, AGAIN.
LET'S GO.
NO.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO...
BREATH.
NOT SO EXAGGERATED.
SHABBAT SHALOM.
SHABBAT SHALOM.
FOR MY SISTERS REENA-ANNA
REENA ANNA IS ONE PERSON?
REENA AAAAAAND ANNA.
LESS DRAMA.
DO --
DO WHAT?
YOU --
YOU WHAT?
WHEN DO YOU FEEL
CONNECTED TO HASHEM?
THAT WORD "FEEL."
THAT'S THE WORD
I NEED TO HEAR.
THE TORAH IS
IMPORTANT BECAUSE...
FOR DORSHEI DERECH BECAUSE IT
MAKES ME WANT TO DAVEN --
TOO FAST, SLOW IT DOWN.
FOR MISHKAN SHALOM BECAUSE I
CAN HELP WITH THE DAVENING.
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
SO WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU SOME SHOES
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT
THEY HAVE, OKAY?
'KAY.
THERE'S A TIE.
OH, MAYBE WE COULD
GET YOU A NEW TIE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DOES HE HAVE A SUIT?
YEAH.
WHAT COLOR IS IT?
IT'S BLUE AND BLACK.
WELL, HE'S GOT A LOT
OF OPTIONS, THEN.
HE CAN GO WITH BLUE,
HE CAN GO WITH YELLOW --
I WANT, I WANT THIS TIE.
WHICH ONE?
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE?
YEAH.
LET'S SEE WHAT THAT ONE'S LIKE.
YOU LIKE THIS TIE?
YEAH.
IT'S KIND OF A NICE TIE.
I LIKE IT.
OKAY, WE'LL BUY THIS TIE.
THANK YOU.
VERY DRAMATIC.
HUH?
VERY DRAMATIC.
VERY DRAMATIC.
IT'S A VERY DRAMATIC TIE?
CAN I SHOW YOU
SOME SHIRTS?
YES, YOU CAN.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"YES, YOU CAN?"
WELL, THANK YOU.
"YES, YOU CAN?"
LET'S START WITH
THE DRESS SHOES FIRST.
LET ME SEE...
DID YOU TELL BRAHMA WHAT
THESE SHOES ARE FOR?
WHAT ARE THESE SHOES FOR?
BRAHMA MIGHT NOT KNOW
WHAT A BAR MITZVAH IS.
WHAT A BAR MITZVAH IS?
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT?
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
TO BE
BAR MITZVAH IS...
I FORGOT.
- GO ON YOU, CAN TELL HIM.
- YOU CAN TELL ME.
I FORGOT, DAD.
COME ON, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
YOU HAVE TO CARRY THE TORAH.
YOU HAVE TO WHAT THE TORAH?
CARRY THE TORAH.
CARRY THE TORAH?
WHAT'S THE TORAH?
IT'S LIKE A BOOK.
OKAY.
AND WHAT DO YOU
FIND IN THAT BOOK?
IT'S A BOOK...DAD.
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS IT?
WHAT'S ANOTHER
NAME FOR THE TORAH?
A SCROLL.
A SCROLL.
WHAT'S ANOTHER NAME --
WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS IT?
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT IT'S CALLED?
DAD...
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO
TEACH BRAHMA SOMETHING.
YEAH.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU LEARN ABOUT
WHEN YOU READ THE TORAH?
DAD...
WHEN YOU STUDYCHUMASH,
WHAT ARE THE THINGS
YOU STUDY INCHUMASH?
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE STORY?
I DON'T KNOW!
DAD...DADDY.
YOU CAN DO THIS, COME ON.
DADDY, I CAN'T DO IT.
OKAY, LIOR, WALK AROUND
AND TELL ME HOW THEY FEEL.
CONCENTRATE ON HOW
THE SHOE FEELS.
HE CAN WANDER AROUND.
HOW DO THEY FIT?
THEY FIT REALLY GREAT!
DO YOU LIKE THESE SHOES?
YES, I DO.
AND YOU WANT TO WEAR THESE
SHOES TO YOUR BAR MITZVAH?
YES.
OKAY.
SHOULD WE GO
OVER THE SERVICE?
OR YOU WANT TO JUST GO
THROUGH THE QUESTIONS?
WE CAN DO THE SERVICE
AND I'LL ASK QUESTIONS
WHEN WE GET TO THEM.
I'LL JUST BE UP THERE
THROUGH THE END OF THESH'MA.
SO YOU'RE DOING A PIECE
OF THESH'MAWITH LYNNE?
I WANT TO DO
THESH'MAWITH YOU.
YOU WANT TO DO
THESH'MAWITH ME?
YES.
OKAY.
I PRAY FOR THIS TO BE A RITE OF
PASSAGE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY
AND NOT JUST
THE BAR MITZVAH STUDENTS.
CAN WE DO, INSTEAD
OF "AS WE BLESS"
AND WE DO "WE ARE OPENING UP"?
♪ WE ARE OPENING
UP TO SWEET SURRENDER... ♪
I THINK THAT THE FAMILY
SPENT SO MUCH TIME
TO REALLY THINK THIS
BAR MITZVAH THROUGH WELL.
TO LIKE, DO IT WITH JUST
TREMENDOUS INTEGRITY AND TRUTH.
WE WANT TO DOPITCHU LI, THAT
WAS DEVORA'S FAVORITE SONG.
GOOD.
I KNOW I'LL FEEL DEVORA'S
SPIRIT PRESENT THAT DAY,
OF JUST LIKE YOU KNOW,
THE JOY OF A MOM, YOU KNOW?
A JOY OF A MOM FOR HER SON.
YOU KNOW, AND THE JOY OF, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, ALL THE PEOPLE THERE
THAT SHE WAS SO
DEEPLY CONNECTED TO
AND REALLY LIVED
HER LIFE WITH
AND ALSO DIED
WITH, YOU KNOW.
MOMMY HAS TO GO AWAY FOR
A LITTLE WHILE TO THE HOSPITAL.
BECAUSE MOMMY'S SICK.
AND MOMMY HAS TO GO BECAUSE THE
DOCTORS WILL MAKE HER BETTER.
SO, WHILE MOMMY GOES AWAY,
IF ANYBODY GETS SAD FOR MOMMY,
THEY CAN HUG THEIR TEDDY BEARS.
AND HERE'S
YONI'S TEDDY BEAR.
THANK YOU, MOMMY.
AND HERE'S
REENA'S TEDDY BEAR.
THANK YOU, MOMMY.
OH, I LOVE -- I KNEW
HE'D GET A DOGGIE.
AND HERE'S ANNA'S.
WHEN YOU FEEL SAD
THAT MOMMY'S NOT HOME
YOU CAN GIVE YOUR
TEDDY BEAR A BIG HUG.
WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART
ABOUT GETTING READY
FOR YOUR BAR MITZVAH?
SO THAT'S WHY.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
I FEEL, YOU KNOW, LIKE SAD.
SHE SINGS BEAUTIFUL.
LIKE CHICKENS.
CHICKENS?
WHAT CHICKENS?
HER VOICE SOUNDED
LIKE CHICKENS?
NO.
APRIL FOOL'S.
AND THAT'S IT.
♪♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR LIOR
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
OH, MY GOD,
HE'S 13.
IT MEANS LIOR'S GROWING UP.
AND I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST
REALLY HARD FOR ME,
JUST 'CAUSE I
DEFINITELY ASSOCIATE
LIOR BEING YOUNGER,
AND MY MOM AND EVERYTHING.
LIKE, I KINDA, SOMETIMES
I JUST THINK ABOUT THAT
AS, LIKE, MY GOLDEN YEARS.
JUST BECAUSE EVERYTHING
SEEMED SO PERFECT AND STUFF.
WITH LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH,
THERE'S A NEW PHASE, I GUESS.
JUST KINDA, MOVING
ON, FROM MY MOM.
MOMMY!
WHERE?
RIGHT THERE.
DEVORA.
RIGHT.
SEVEN YEARS AGO, TODAY.
DO YOU THINK IT WAS A LONG
TIME AGO SINCE MOMMY DIED?
NO.
NO?
ACTUALLY, YES.
IN THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS,
THE JEWISH WORLD AND THE WORLD
OF THE STARS AND THE PLANETS,
SEVEN YEARS IS A FULL CYCLE.
SO EVERY SEVEN YEARS, ALL THE
CELLS IN YOUR BODY ARE REPLACED.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU
WANT TO SAY TO MOMMY?
BEFORE YOUR BAR MITZVAH?
YOU FEEL SAD?
YOU REALLY FEEL SAD?
YEAH, IT'S OKAY TO
FEEL SAD, SWEETIE.
YEAH, IT'S OKAY TO FEEL SAD.
YES, IT IS, IT'S YOUR
BAR MITZVAH WEEKEND.
YOU REMEMBERED, HUH?
HELLO!
MAZEL TOV!
THANK YOU.
IT'S VERY EXCITING!
BEN!
LIOR, COME OVER HERE.
THIS IS ESTHER.
HI.
ESTHER CAME HERE ALL
THE WAY FROM BOSTON
TO BE AT YOUR BAR MITZVAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS AT ESTHER'S BAT MITZVAH.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU TOO.
NOT TOO FAST.
C'MON.
HE HAS BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS FOR MORE YEARS
THAN ANY KID HAS EVER LOOKED
FORWARD TO A BAR MITZVAH.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU,
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU.
I DON'T LOVE YOU.
NOOO!
LIOR, DO YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY
IN THIS ROOM LOVES YOU?
EVERY SINGLE PERSON.
AND YOU TOO!
LIOR, I LOVE YOU.
I DON'T LOVE YOU.
ESTHER?
OH, MY GOD.
YONI, YOU MET ESTHER.
OH, YEAH?
WHO'S ESTHER?
OH, YOUR FRIEND.
SHE NICE?
ESTHER, YOU HAVE A BIG
CRUSH ON HIM DON'T YOU?
HE'S AN AMAZING GUY.
THE MOMENT YOU MEET HIM,
SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART SAYS,
"OH, HE'S GOT A GREAT HEART."
OH, WOW, WOW.
THAT WAS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING.
I'M GOING TO MARRY HER.
OH, YEAH?
MARRY WHO?
ESTHER!
REALLY?
ESTHER, ESTHER, ESTHER.
DID HE JUST SAY
PLEASE BE MY WIFE?
WHEN WE, WHEN I GROW UP.
WHEN HE GROWS UP.
LIOR, TOMORROW YOU'RE GIVING
YOUR BAR MITZVAH SPEECH
TO 300 PEOPLE.
IF IT WAS MY BAT MITZVAH,
I'D BE REALLY NERVOUS.
HOW COME YOU'RE SO CALM?
TO 300 PEOPLE.
BUT WHAT IF I WAS AFRAID
I WAS GOING TO MESS UP?
DON'T GO FAST, GO SLOW.
WHAT IF I WAS NERVOUS?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WHAT?
WHY DOES HIS FACE LOOK SO GOOFY?
LOOK AT THAT FACE.
GREAT PICTURE.
HE LOOKS SO CUTE.
HE LOOKS SO CUTE.
COME ON, SWEETIE.
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU --
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M GOING
TO DO IT FOR YOU,
SO I'D LIKE TO SAY
ASHEHECHIYANU.
BARUCH ATAH ADONAI,
ELOHEINU MELECH HA-OLAM,

AND THEN WE GET
THE BRUSH FULL OF LATHER.
YEAH, LIOR.
AND THEN YONI'S GOING
TO BE NEXT, OKAY?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT GOT
ALL OVER HIS FACE.
OKAY, GET IT OFF.
OKAY, SERIOUS.
I'M SHAVING.
YOU'RE SHAVING,
VERY COOL, OKAY.
LET ME SEE.
YOU DIDN'T BRUSH
YOUR HAIR YET?
YOU LOOK GOOD, LIOR.
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GET
DRESSED; HANG ON.
LIOR?
HMM.
NO -- LIOR, NO TV NOW.
WE HAVE TO GO.
READY?
YEAH, I'M READY.
"CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT HIS BAR MITZVAH
IS GOING TO BE LIKE?"
I HEAR SOMEONE WHISPER.
I ALSO WONDER WHAT
IT WILL BE LIKE.
WILL HIS CHARMING, CHILDLIKE
INNOCENCE BE ABLE TO EVOLVE
INTO MATURE FORMS
OF EXPRESSION?
WILL LIOR CONTINUE TO CREATE
A PLACE FOR HIMSELF
IN THIS COMMUNITY?
I AM READY!
AMEN.
I THINK HE'S DOING JUST FINE.
HE'S FIGURING IT OUT HIMSELF.
IT'S MY JOB TO SIT
BACK AND TRUST HIM.
HOW DOES IT FEEL?
IT FEELS GOOD.
GOOD SHABBOS, EVERYBODY!
GOOD SHABBOS!
WELCOME TO MISHKAN SHALOM AND
WELCOME TO LIOR'S BAR MITZVAH.
PAGE 273. AHAVA RABA:
A GREAT LOVE SURROUNDS US.
A GREAT LOVE FILLS US.
HE'S EXCELLENT.
HE'S AMAZING.
NOT TOO MANY 13 YEAR OLDS
COULD DO THIS.
LIOR HAS BEEN DAVENING WITH
US AND INSPIRING US TO DAVEN.
TODAY FOR THE FIRST
TIME, HE'S SAYING
"OKAY, TODAY I AM TELLING YOU, I
AM READY TO CARRY YOUR PRAYERS
ON MY SHOULDERS
AND IN MY HEART."
AND AREN'T WE ARE
A LUCKY COMMUNITY?
TO HAVE THIS GUY
CARRYING UP OUR PRAYERS.
HE'S JUST TOTALLY
RISEN TO THE OCCASION.
HE IS JUST SO AMAZING.
UH-OH, I THINK
THIS IS IT.
REMEMBER TO LOOK UP
AND GO VERY SLOWLY
AND SAY EACH WORD CLEARLY.
SHABBAT SHALOM.
SHABBAT SHALOM.
YESHIR KOACH!
YOU WERE SO GOOD.
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
THANKS, YONI.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

SEE YOU TONIGHT.
YEAH, YOU WILL.
BRING THE PAN OVER TO HERE.
THERE YOU GO, PERFECT.
REALLY?
NOPE.
YOU LOOK
SO DIFFERENT TO ME
THAN YOU DID BEFORE.
YOU'VE GOTTEN TALLER,
NOW YOU HAVE TO SHAVE.
DO I LOOK DIFFERENT TO YOU?
NO.
I LOOK THE SAME?
YEAH, YOU DO.
I DON'T LOOK LIKE
I GOT ANY OLDER?
NO.
HOW CAN I TELL THAT
YOU'VE GOTTEN OLDER?
TODAY WE'RE DOING A REVIEW.
WE HAVE A TEST TOMORROW
AND IT'S ON EMOTIONAL HEALTH
AND KIDS ARE PLAYING
A JEOPARDY GAME.
YOU WANT TO TRY IT?
HAVE A SEAT, LIOR.
WHAT CATEGORY, ERICA?
VOCABULARY WORD.
BECOMING STRONG IN ONE AREA
TO MAKE UP FOR A WEAKNESS
IN ANOTHER AREA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, ERICA?
WHAT IS THAT CALLED?
I'M TRYING A --
JUST TRY PRONOUNCING IT.
YEAH.
TAP IT OUT, YOU KNOW IT.
COM-PEN-SATION?
YES!
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, THIS ONE IS HOW A PERSON
FEELS ABOUT HIMSELF OR HERSELF.
SELF-IMAGE.
VERY GOOD, LIOR!
GO ONE UP THERE,
PUT YOUR INITIALS,
LIOR, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP?
WHAT WILL YOU BE LIKE
WHEN YOU'RE A MAN?
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE 16?
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE 20?
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE 25?
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE 35?
