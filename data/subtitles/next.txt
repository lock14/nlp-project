I've just got to hand this in
to Armstrong. I'll see you later.



So, I'm telling
my mom that joke...



you know, the one about the duck?



That one's pretty good.



And when I tell her the punchline,
she spews milk out of her <i>nose.</i>



Uh, Emma?



Milk. Out of my mom's nose. Funny?



Huh?



Oh, yeah. Funny, J.T.



What's going on?



Nothing. Just writing some emails.



Um, I wanted to ask you...



I saw you and Armstrong
this morning.



And what's your point?



Uh, it looked like...



Looked like what?



I had a few questions
about equations.



So?



Are you trying to read my emails?
No, not at all.



Emails are private.
Mind your own business.

Don't you think
you're being a bit obvious?



About what?
Sean.



If you stare any harder,
your eyeballs will pop out.



J.T., what do you think
of Armstrong?



I mean, as a person.



Teachers aren't people.



They're... teachers.



You know what I mean.



Do you think he's... OK?



Oh, yeah. Armstrong's given me
lots of extra help.



He's been really nice. To me, anyway.



Yeah. Come to think of it,
he's nice to everyone.



You going to eat that?
Huh?



No. You take it.



Something I said?



Hey, Sheila. Two specials, please.



What is that? Nuclear waste?



I don't want to hear about it,
Gavin.



Hey, guys. Did you see
the sign in the bathroom?



"Flush twice...
it's a long way to the cafeteria'.



Gavin.



It might take you
a few extra years,



but I can't wait
for the day you graduate.



Oh, man!



Eugh! What is it? Eugh! Eugh!



Sheila, there's a bug in my squash.



Yeah. I think the joke goes,
"Waiter, there's a fly in my soup."



I'm serious. It's right up...



Yeah. Nice try, Gavin.



By the way, don't forget to pay
for that. It's $4.99 plus tax.



Next.



So, Em, for Media Immersion,
should we use HTML?



Yeah, sure. Whatever.



Manny, has Armstrong
ever touched you?



What?! No.



Did he touch <i>you'?</i>



No, no, not me. Liberty.



I saw him touching Liberty.



Are you sure?



Yeah. I know what I saw.



I don't know, Em.



Armstrong's a pretty physical guy.



Maybe you got the wrong idea.



I hope so.



But this morning
he had his arm around Liberty.



And I saw him pass her a note
outside.



It really looked like
he was coming on to her.



Mr Armstrong?



You've got
to be making this up.



No, I swear.



It just so happens you're always
complaining about the food



and now you find a bug?



Hmm.
Paige. Come on.



Does this look like
the face of a liar?



You want an honest answer?



Why won't anyone believe me?



Tell her, Jimmy.



There was some kind of weirdness
on his plate.



Are you sure it wasn't just a hair?



A moth, I think.
An earwig, dude. An earwig.



See? You two can't even
get your story straight.



Boycott the caff!



Hey, guys. The caff has bugs.
Boycott the caff!



That's a serious accusation.



Ms Kwan, I found a bug in my food...
an earwig.



And where's this offensive creature
now?



Stuck to a kid's shoe.



Gavin, defamation
and rumour-mongering



are serious offences.



The next time you have an accusation
like that, you'd better have proof!



What's with you?
You look awful.



Thanks, Paige.



No. I mean, what's going on?



It's good to get things off your
chest. You'll feel way better.



I guess so, but...



Terri, we're friends, right?



Friends talk to each other.



OK. But you have to promise
to keep it a secret.



I really mean it.
Of course.



What is it?



You know Liberty?
That kid in seventh grade?



Well, I heard
Armstrong was coming on to her.



Eugh! You're kidding, right?



No. I overheard Emma.



She saw him with his arm around her.



And on the steps,
he gave her a love note.



So, what do we do? Report it?



Hon, you can't report a rumour.



Afternoon, everyone.



Is something wrong, girls?



Oh.
No, nothing, Mr Armstrong.



OK.



Today we're going to take a look
at distributive properties.



Alright, in review, you'll remember
the three main rules...



do the operations in the brackets,



multiplication, division...



Get this... Liberty and Armstrong
were seen kissing outside.



Yeah. They were in his car, kissing,
in front of everybody.



She got a ride in with him
this morning.



Do you think
they spent the night together?



How could Coach Armstrong do that?!



Dude, Liberty and Armstrong
are doing it!



There she is!



Next on the agenda, the motion that
Liberty put forward last meeting.



Right. About the talent show.



So, what do you think, Ashley?
Should we have one?



Sure. Sounds great.



Wow. That was easy.



We argued about it for hours
last week.



Yeah, I know.



Guys, you can stop whispering.
I know what you're talking about.



Um, you do?
Of course.



Everyone knows what happened,
so we might as well discuss it.



Um... OK. But don't you want
to discuss it in private?



It's no secret, Ashley.



We all know some microphones
were stolen at last year's show.



But it won't happen this year.
I promise.



Liberty?



If it's about the microphones...
It's not.



Do you even know what's going on?



People are talking
about you and Armstrong,



that you're pretty close.



What does that mean?



It means that people think
you two are, um...



...extra friendly.



They... they think
he's doing things to me?



Yes. Is it true?
Of course not!



If it is, we have to report it.



Liberty, please, just wait.
We can talk.



I <i>knew</i> something was going on.



You did?



We talked about it yesterday.



I just couldn't believe it.
I still can't.



Maybe we should report it.



Armstrong would be toast.



That's true. We should wait
and find out for sure.



This whole thing, it's disgusting.



Just the thought of it. Ugh!



It makes me want to take a shower.



That wouldn't be such a bad idea.



So, what do we do now?



Leave me alone, Emma.



Liberty, what you need right now
is a friend, someone to talk to.



But there's nothing to talk about.



It's OK. You can tell me.
I <i>am</i> telling you!



Are you sure you're not lying?



Because we really have to report it.



Emma! I swear on my life
that nothing's going on.



The whole school is talking.



I know. And it's just
a vicious rumour, honest.



What if it gets to Raditch?



To my parents?



What'll Mr Armstrong say
when he hears this?



Then there's only one way
to handle this...



stop the rumour
and track down its source.



Then give whoever started it...
A good, swift kick?



I was going to say a good talking-to,
but that'll do.



Hey, Spinner. Find any bugs
in your breakfast this morning?



Very funny.



So I made a mistake.



Why did you say you made a mistake?



Because I did.



What?!



I'm always complaining
about the food, right?



So I must've made it up.



OK. Now I'm completely confused.



It would've been totally different
if someone else found that bug.



Then everyone would believe it,
even the "Wrath of Kwan'.



I guess so.



Better not be tuna salad in here.



Ugh!



Today's special... earwig surprise.



It took me hours to collect them.



When I get done, the caff'll
be closed... permanently.



Are you sure it isn't true, though?



When I talked to Liberty yesterday,
she was really defensive,



like she was hiding something.



She was probably just upset.
Wouldn't you be?



Yeah, I would.



Poor girl.
Who would spread a rumour like that?



That's what I'm trying to figure out.



Who did you hear it from, Ashley?



It was Jimmy.
But he heard it from Spinner.



Hey. It wasn't me who started it.



Talk to this guy.
Sean?!



What?
He's the one who told me.



About Coach Armstrong and Liberty?



Oh, man. That's just sick!



It's not true, Sean.



It isn't?
No.



Man! I knew it sounded fake.



I should've never believed her.



Believed who?



I'm innocent. Talk to Paige.



I was merely imparting information.



And besides, I heard it from Terri.



She's the one you need to speak to.



I need to talk to you.



OK.



The whole school's gossiping
about Liberty and Armstrong.



Oh, no kidding. I have ears too.



Well, it's not true.
It's just a rumour.



Paige spread it around,
but she heard it from you.



I swore her to secrecy.



As if she'd keep quiet!
Paige lives for rumours.



I was upset, OK? I was shocked.



I had to tell someone. I'm sorry.



Well, too late. I hope you're happy.



Me?
Hello!



You're the one
who started the rumour.



I hate to tell you, but no.



It was right here yesterday.



You were talking to Manny about
Liberty and Armstrong, remember?



You started the rumour, Emma.



Spin, are you sure
you want to do this?



Don't you think it's a bit drastic?



Nope. All is fair in love and war.
And, dude, this is war.



You're eating
the cafeteria food again?



I decided to be, you know, mature.



I probably never even saw that bug.



Good for you, Spinner.



Jimmy, can you pass me the pepper?



Thanks.



What are you smiling at?



Oh!



You put bugs on <i>her</i> tray?!



Nobody believes me,
but they'll believe her.



Oh, Spinner, you idiot!



Ash, calm down. I told you...
there's bugs in the food.



Because you put them there.



What's in that container?



Nothing.



Ugh!



Gavin,
what is going on here?!



Math class.
I've been dreading this all day.



So, did you track down the rumour?



Yeah. But I need
to say something to you first.



OK. Today we're going
to be working on equations.



Now, in dealing with equations,
we always use the BEDMAS rule.



Now, who can tell me
what that stands for?



What's with everyone today?



OK. Why don't you tell us, Liberty?
You and I have been working on it.



What is so funny?



That's enough.



Mr Armstrong, could I have
five minutes of your time?



I was just about
to get started here.



Mrs Smith will take over the class.



Right. Uh, OK.



Uh, class, I want you to begin
working on



the order of operations exercises,
on page 129.



Liberty, would you join us, please?



What are you doing here?



Emma, go back to class.



I need to talk to you, Mr Raditch.



Well, it'll have to wait. I'm in
the middle of something right now.



It can't wait.



You see...



...I'm in the middle of it too.



You'll help me serve at every lunch



and then after school
you can help me clean up.



Oh, and, uh, don't forget about this.



I'm not wearing that.



Health regulations, princess.



You do know about health regulations?



Hey, Spin. How long are you...



Nice net, Spinner.



Oh, cheer up. It won't be for long...
only for about two months.



Two months?



You owe the school $300.



That's what it'll cost
to exterminate the cafeteria.



But the caff needed
to be exterminated anyway!



Sure it did, Gavin.
Sure it did.



Liberty?



I know you're in here.



I <i>was</i> responsible for the rumour
starting, but I didn't spread it.



And there's a difference?!



You're lucky Mr Armstrong
didn't lose his job.



And you know
what makes me really mad?



That you thought I could do that!



Do what? Be violated?



And what were you doing
with Mr Armstrong, anyway?



He had his arm around you.



Passed you a note.



You want to see my note?



"Dyscalculia'?



It's a learning disorder,
like dyslexia, but with numbers.



I've been really upset about it.



Mr Armstrong's been helping me.



So that's the explanation?



Why didn't you say something?



Because it means you're not perfect?



Because it means I'm stupid!



Stupid?! You're one of the
smartest kids in school!



Not in math, I'm not.



Who cares?
I do!



It's important to me to be the best.



You don't understand.



Liberty, I feel really bad.



Is there something
I can do... to help?



No, Emma. Go back to saving
rainforests and whales.



'Cause when it comes
to helping people, you suck.
