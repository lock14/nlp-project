1
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,549
My God.
Brother, what have you done?

2
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:52,320
Yet again we arrive to witness
this monster's aftermath.

3
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,492
l will not tolerate this
any longer, Marcus.

4
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,911
Your brother must be stopped.

5
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,163
lt ends tonight.

6
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,833
We must move quickly,
before they turn.

7
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,588
ls he still here?

8
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,673
Yes.

9
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,676
Viktor, he must not be harmed.

10
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,012
l gave you my word, did l not?

11
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,098
But William must be controlled.

12
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,645
Burn the bodies.

13
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,772
Search the outbuildings.

14
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,941
Form two groups.
You, douse them with fuel.

15
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,609
-Yes, sir.
-Marcus.

16
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,445
Stay with me.

17
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,779
Give me the torch.

18
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:26,372
They're turning !

19
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,012
-Retreat to the woods.
-l'll stay and fight. You need my help.

20
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,931
l need you alive.

21
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,432
lf you die, we all die.

22
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,767
Now, go.

23
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,811
Go!

24
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,421
-We found him.
-And?

25
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,132
-We need more men.
-Find Amelia.

26
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,435
Amelia, we found William.

27
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,588
Surround him !

28
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,468
Take him down.

29
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,144
No.

30
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,939
Leave him be.

31
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,070
Stop this, you're killing him.

32
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,616
More!

33
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,517
William.

34
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,976
Marcus!

35
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,355
He was not to be harmed.

36
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,857
Place him in my charge
as we agreed. . .

37
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,026
. . .or you will pay for your deceit.

38
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,904
And you will learn your place.

39
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,074
Your sympathy for this beast
is foolish.

40
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,035
Your brother is entirely
beyond control.

41
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,787
lt will be done my way.

42
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,457
You know well the consequences
if you murder me. . .

43
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,875
. . .or William.

44
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,504
lf you so much as speak
his name again. . .

45
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,090
. . .you will have chosen
that future for him.

46
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,561
What is thy will, my lord?

47
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,773
lmprisonment for all time.

48
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,235
Far from you.

49
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,291
For six centuries I was a IoyaI soIdier
of the Vampire cIan.

50
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,503
But I was betrayed.

51
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,049
The war was not as it had seemed.

52
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:34,096
In one night, the Iies that had united
our kind had been exposed.

53
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,057
Kraven, our second-in-command...

54
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,727
...had formed a secret aIIiance
with Lucian...

55
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,937
...ruIer of the WerewoIf cIan...

56
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,648
...to overthrow Viktor, our leader.

57
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,153
But Kraven's Iust for power
and domination had faiIed.

58
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,658
Viktor was not the savior
I had been Ied to beIieve.

59
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,246
He had betrayed us aII.

60
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,423
Soon the hunt will be on
for his kiIIer.

61
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,679
I have but one aIIy Ieft:

62
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,473
MichaeI...

63
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,309
...the human descendant
of Corvinus.

64
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,562
Neither Vampire nor Lycan...

65
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,564
...but a hybrid.

66
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,903
It's onIy a matter of time
before we're found.

67
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,512
My onIy hope now
is to awaken Marcus...

68
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,098
...our Iast remaining eIder...

69
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,975
...and expose the truth...

70
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,604
...before Kraven tries to murder him
whiIe he's stiII in hibernation.

71
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,818
Kraven knows
he's no match for him awake.

72
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,857
Perfect.

73
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,309
This thing's been dead for weeks.

74
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,187
l thought Lycans went back
to their human form when they die.

75
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,898
They do. lt's been given
a serum to stop regression. . .

76
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,900
. . .so it can be studied.

77
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,276
How can you tell?

78
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,161
Not quite your department, l guess.

79
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,748
l just killed them. l didn't pay
much attention to their anatomy.

80
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,043
-How long can we stay here?
-Not long.

81
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,754
These safe houses are
linked together on one mainframe. . .

82
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,507
. . .with motion sensors revealing
which ones are active.

83
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,051
Someone could have
picked us up already.

84
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,269
There's only about an hour
till daylight.

85
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,897
Can you make it back
to the mansion before sunrise?

86
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,775
-Just.
-Okay, let's get what we need and go.

87
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,944
No.

88
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,072
l'm going alone.

89
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,051
Open it.

90
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,699
Marcus?

91
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,746
The blood memories
of this wretched creature. . .

92
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:39,044
. . . have shown me that your treachery
knows no bounds.

93
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,881
My lord, l can explain.

94
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,593
Why would l listen to your lies. . .

95
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,721
. . .when the journey to the truth. . .

96
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,186
. . . is so much sweeter?

97
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,738
I kept his secrets,
cIeaned up the mess.

98
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,074
You'll go before Viktor. . .

99
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,618
. . .and tell him
exactly what l tell you to!

100
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,372
You just concentrate on your part.

101
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,009
Please.

102
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,137
l can assist you.

103
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,514
Oh, you already have.

104
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,772
lf l can plead my case. . .

105
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,066
. . .there's a chance
you'll be granted sanctuary.

106
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,153
Right now, you'll be killed on sight.
l'm not prepared to risk it.

107
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,738
What am l supposed to do, wait?

108
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,616
Kraven may still have men with him.
You're not going alone.

109
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,659
You're not as strong
as you might think.

110
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,495
-What?
-Michael, you're unique.

111
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,706
There's never been a hybrid before.

112
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,501
However ambivalent you feel about it,
your powers could be limitless.

113
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,919
But you depend on blood.

114
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,213
You need to feed.

115
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,967
Without it, you'll be growing weaker
by the second. Use the time for that.

116
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,178
Jesus Christ.

117
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,930
And what if l don't?

118
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,641
What if l can't?

119
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,726
Normal food could be lethal.

120
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,729
lf you don't anticipate your cravings,
you will attack humans.

121
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,066
And believe me, you don't want that
on your conscience.

122
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,693
There really is
no going back, Michael.

123
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,989
l'm sorry.

124
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,617
Look, l understand what you did.

125
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,577
l'm grateful.

126
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,747
You saved my life.

127
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,624
l wasn't ready to die.

128
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,214
l don't know.

129
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,548
Everything's changed.

130
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,468
l probably need a minute
to make it all fit in my head.

131
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,762
lt's a lot to process all at once.

132
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,642
Look, go. l'll be here.

133
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,728
You just make sure you come back.

134
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,231
Sir.

135
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,859
The innocent who witnessed. . .

136
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,360
. . .they've been silenced?

137
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,113
But otherwise unharmed,
as ordered.

138
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,912
-Show me what you have.
-Yes, sir.

139
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,835
Two Death Dealers were killed.

140
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,879
We found no Lycan bodies.

141
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,507
Apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition. . .

142
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,634
. . .some sort of UV round.

143
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,928
Amelia?

144
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,932
No one survived.

145
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,518
lt seems Kraven's men
might have been present. . .

146
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,521
. . . but they did nothing to prevent it.

147
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,564
And Viktor?

148
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,088
And no trace of Marcus
amongst the ashes?

149
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,007
lt seems he destroyed
his own coven, sir.

150
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,386
lt was never his coven.

151
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,537
We need to go.

152
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,124
Give me a moment.

153
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,389
There you are.

154
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,245
How you doing?

155
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,184
Thank you.

156
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,602
You've got to get away from me.

157
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,438
Get away from me!

158
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,952
Hello?

159
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,626
There.

160
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,129
Michael Corvin.

161
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,631
Get the men up there. Now.

162
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,143
Get the fuck away from me.

163
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,671
Stop. Stop.

164
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,678
Shit.

165
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,642
Michael. Oh, shit.

166
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,318
-Here. Take it.
-No.

167
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,570
Michael, you'll die.

168
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,931
Shit.

169
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,975
Can you move?

170
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,605
We need to go.

171
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,794
Marcus.

172
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,464
l know what you've done, Selene.

173
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,592
Viktor deserved his fate
and Kraven was no better.

174
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,930
Kraven has already reaped
the rewards of his own misdeeds.

175
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,932
And Viktor. . . .

176
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,810
Viktor deserved his fate. . .

177
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,395
. . . many times over.

178
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,024
A terrible business. . .

179
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,067
. . .the slaying of your family.

180
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,279
Yet so much effort was spent. . .

181
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,740
. . .to conceal this matter from me.

182
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,953
What do you suppose
Viktor had to hide?

183
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,208
Or perhaps it is you, Selene. . .

184
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,880
. . .as the last
of your wretched family. . .

185
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,925
. . .who has something to hide.

186
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,977
Go!

187
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,681
Get in.

188
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:43,252
Dead or alive,
you will give me what l want.

189
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,993
You okay?

190
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,166
-He's a hybrid, isn't he?
-Yes.

191
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,628
He wanted this. Why?

192
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,423
l don't know.

193
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,800
But we have another problem.

194
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,223
Turn off up here.

195
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,022
Shit. All right, get down.

196
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,109
Keep your foot on the gas,
but stay down.

197
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,710
Hold on.

198
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,059
Stay down.

199
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,157
Come on.

200
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,218
Give me your hand.

201
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,928
Jesus Christ.

202
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,390
There's really no need.

203
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,225
l'll be right back.

204
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,118
All right, let me see.

205
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,666
See?

206
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,459
No need.

207
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,855
Area secure, sir.

208
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,986
Sun's setting.

209
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,406
What's wrong?

210
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,041
The supplies were taken.
Used weapons were left behind.

211
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,586
The tavern events occurred before
dawn, so they couIdn't have got far.

212
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:30,547
Remain airborne for the moment.
l'm sure they'll reappear. . .

213
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,342
-...in good time.
-Yes, sir.

214
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,474
l've seen this before,
when l was a child.

215
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,226
l've held it.

216
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,936
When it was open, like this.

217
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,354
How is that possible?

218
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,358
l don't know.

219
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,278
But l know someone that might.

220
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,989
Andreas Tanis.

221
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,034
He was the official historian
of the covens.

222
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:05,290
He fell from favor after documenting
what Viktor considered malicious lies.

223
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,210
Of course, as it turns out,
he was probably telling the truth.

224
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,711
What happened to him?

225
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,005
He was exiled over 300 years ago.

226
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,132
Three hundred years?

227
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,093
What makes you think
we'll find him now?

228
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,928
l was the one who exiled him.

229
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,052
Looks like a monastery.

230
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,305
lt used to be.
More like a prison now.

231
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,391
Tanis has been hiding there
since Viktor's order.

232
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,144
We'll be the first people
he's seen in centuries.

233
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,116
-That's odd.
-What?

234
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,286
l don't remember this gate
being here before.

235
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,914
Take this.

236
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,689
Shit.

237
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,464
Go back!

238
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,135
Gotcha.

239
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,222
Fuck.

240
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,545
l knew it was you, Selene.

241
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:47,299
The stench of Viktor's blood
still lingers in your veins.

242
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,967
Tanis.

243
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,885
l see your aim hasn't improved.

244
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,348
You haven't changed.

245
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,267
You don't scare me, Selene.

246
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,186
Well, we're gonna
have to work on that.

247
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:11,698
We need to talk.

248
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,455
Your exile seems a bit more
comfortable than l remember.

249
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,249
How does a Vampire
have Lycan bodyguards?

250
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:22,876
A gift.

251
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,669
From a most persuasive client.

252
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,213
Lucian.

253
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,508
Why would Lucian
wanna protect you?

254
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,720
Because he was trading with them.

255
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,891
UV rounds.

256
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,727
How long have you been
in the business of killing your own?

257
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:44,022
l've done what's necessary
to survive.

258
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,526
My decision was made easy the day
your precious Viktor betrayed me.

259
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,529
Betrayal was something
he did very well.

260
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,617
Viktor's dead. l killed him.

261
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:57,202
You?

262
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,162
Kill Viktor?

263
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,210
No, l think not.

264
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,339
Oh, unless you've learned the truth.

265
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,263
So your eyes are finally open.

266
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,308
lsn't it interesting how the truth. . .

267
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,852
. . . is even harder to absorb
than light?

268
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,230
You know, l tried to stop him,
of course.

269
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,358
A travesty,
committing such a horrible crime.

270
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:31,611
And then turning you.

271
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,905
That was too much to take.

272
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:36,449
My protests are why he put me here.

273
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,536
Careful with that, dear.

274
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:40,912
Makes a terrible bang.

275
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,790
Open the blades and they're active.

276
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,459
Good to know.

277
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,049
Viktor put you here for a reason,
but l doubt it was. . .

278
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,552
. . . because you had moral qualms.

279
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,764
-What do you know?
-Very little of anything, l'm afraid.

280
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,357
Well, then, perhaps l'm mistaken
and there's no use for you at all.

281
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,736
Marcus was after this. Why?

282
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,283
Some history is based on truth. . .

283
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,577
. . .and others on deception.

284
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,999
Viktor was not the first of our kind,
as you were led to believe.

285
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,126
He was once human. . .

286
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,504
. . .the ruler of these lands.

287
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,799
Marcus...

288
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,343
...he's the one.

289
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,429
The source.

290
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,682
The first true Vampire.

291
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,560
So the legend is true.

292
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:31,523
Toward the end of his ruthless life. . .

293
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:36,694
...when the next breath meant more
to Viktor than siIver or goId...

294
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,739
...Marcus came with an offer...

295
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,701
...a reprieve from sickness
and death.

296
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,204
lmmortality.

297
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,958
And in return, Viktor was to use
his army-turned-immortal to help him.

298
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,627
To do what?

299
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,046
To defeat
the very first Werewolves. . .

300
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,258
. . .a dangerous
and infectious breed. . .

301
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,052
. . .created by Marcus' own
flesh and blood:

302
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,681
His twin brother, William.

303
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,351
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

304
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,937
Disgusting though
your brethren may be. . .

305
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,106
. . .they at least are evolved.

306
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,567
No, these were raging monsters.

307
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,070
Never able to take
human form again.

308
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,407
lt was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage.

309
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:26,327
And William's appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable.

310
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,038
He had to be stopped.

311
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,666
And so once Viktor's army
was turned. . .

312
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,252
. . .the legions of Vampires
under his control. . .

313
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,672
. . .tracked down
and destroyed the animals. . .

314
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,173
. . .then captured William. . .

315
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,259
. . .and locked him away.

316
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,928
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

317
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:47,849
Why let him live?

318
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:52,312
For the very same reason that Viktor
never conspired against Marcus: fear.

319
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,772
He was warned that,
should Marcus be killed. . .

320
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,276
. . .all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

321
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,279
So in Viktor's mind. . .

322
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,198
. . .William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans. . .

323
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,491
. . . his slaves.

324
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,995
Yes.

325
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,332
Yes, a clever deception. . .

326
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,293
. . . but one Viktor was hardly willing
to put to the test.

327
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:18,630
And so Marcus was protected. . .

328
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,049
. . .at all costs.

329
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,553
Yes, here we are.

330
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,811
-Vampires?
-Mortals.

331
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,982
Men loyal to Alexander Corvinus.

332
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,152
The father of us all.

333
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,495
What's this?

334
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,959
You should know.

335
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,962
lt's William's prison.

336
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:04,926
The prison your father
was commissioned to build.

337
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,601
So you've been the one keeping
a watch over this for me, have you?

338
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:16,062
l've been searching everywhere
for this, my darling.

339
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,276
What is it?

340
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,195
What's wrong?

341
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,241
She now understands
why her family was killed.

342
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,579
But that was many years later.

343
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,749
The winter of Lucian's escape.

344
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,960
Your father knew too much.

345
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,920
Or too much for Viktor to risk. . .

346
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:43,214
. . .especially when Lucian. . .

347
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,510
. . . had the key to William's cell.

348
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,388
And l'm the map.

349
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,765
Yes.

350
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:58,312
The only one still living
who has seen its location.

351
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,066
Oh, Viktor realized you'd be too young
to remember explicitly. . .

352
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:05,486
. . . but Marcus knows
that the memory. . .

353
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:09,323
. . .and therefore the exact location
of William's prison. . .

354
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,659
. . . is hidden away in your blood.

355
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,371
Why is Marcus looking
for him now. . .

356
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,123
. . .after all this time?

357
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,708
That l cannot answer.

358
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,554
But l do know someone. . .

359
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:34,599
. . .who could stop him.
Perhaps l could arrange a meeting.

360
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:40,563
ln exchange for your discretion,
of course.

361
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,316
Of course.

362
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,290
Tanis. You seem anxious.

363
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,293
Why do you flee
the very sight of me?

364
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,925
Please. . .

365
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,511
. . .sit.

366
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:57,640
There's no need
for this to be unpleasant.

367
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,310
l've always rather enjoyed
your company.

368
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,402
Now you're being rude.

369
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,196
Sorry.

370
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,498
Viktor struck two keys.

371
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,458
What do you know of them?

372
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,129
Keys?

373
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:32,008
l don't know of any keys.

374
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,483
Oh, yes.

375
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,194
Yes, those keys.

376
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,530
-Yes?
-Well, one was. . . .

377
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,826
One was kept in plain sight. . .

378
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,245
. . .draped around
his daughter's neck. . .

379
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,457
-. . . right there for you to see.
-And the other?

380
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:10,129
-Kept with Viktor at all times.
-Where?

381
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,924
Within him.

382
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,927
Beneath the flesh.

383
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,268
Please. Please.

384
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,603
l beg you. Please.

385
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,688
Please, l beg you.

386
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,832
--who could stop him.
Perhaps l could arrange a meeting.

387
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,502
Go to pier 1 7.
Ask for Lorenz Macaro.

388
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,153
How do we know Tanis
isn't setting us up?

389
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,781
He's not brave enough
to set me up.

390
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:45,933
You can go.

391
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,070
You're familiar with this, then?

392
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,288
lntimately.

393
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,464
You're Alexander Corvinus.

394
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,098
There was a time
that l was known by that name.

395
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:30,853
By any name,
l am still your forefather.

396
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,279
How have you stayed hidden
all these years?

397
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,865
For centuries l've stood by
and watched the havoc. . .

398
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:48,037
. . . my sons have wrought upon
each other and upon humanity.

399
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,082
Not the legacy l prayed for. . .

400
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,542
. . .the morning l watched them
enter this world.

401
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,004
And a tiresome duty. . .

402
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,383
. . . keeping the war contained,
cleaning up the mess. . .

403
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:04,720
. . . hiding my family's
unfortunate history.

404
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,223
-Couldn't you have stopped it?
-Yes.

405
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,601
Could you kill your own sons?

406
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,104
You know what Marcus will do.

407
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,357
lf he finds me,
he finds William's prison.

408
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,692
You need to help us stop him.

409
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,864
You are asking me
to help you kill my son?

410
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:25,449
You?

411
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,118
A Death Dealer?

412
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,286
How many innocents did you kill. . .

413
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,248
. . . in the six-century quest
to avenge your family?

414
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,792
Spare me
your self-righteous declarations.

415
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,047
You are no different from Marcus
and even less noble than William.

416
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,967
At least he cannot control
his savagery.

417
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:46,262
Anything l've done
can be laid at your feet.

418
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,557
Hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability to accept. . .

419
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,768
. . .that your sons are monsters,
that they create monsters.

420
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,104
You could've stopped all of this.

421
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,022
Do not come groveling to me. . .

422
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,901
. . .simply because you are weaker
than your adversary.

423
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,946
You know the devastation William
caused before he was captured.

424
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,489
He cannot be set free.

425
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,874
Wa-- No, wait.
You're no match for him.

426
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:20,981
Soon, brother.

427
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,309
No.

428
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:10,698
Father.

429
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,199
No.

430
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,161
They've gone.
There, there, my child.

431
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,830
You are safe now.

432
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,006
No. Michael.

433
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,008
Look at me.

434
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,845
Michael.

435
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:16,597
Shit.

436
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:47,920
Please.

437
01:06:56,888 --> 01:07:00,683
Come on.

438
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:06,230
Fuck.

439
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:53,777
Hello, Father.

440
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,406
You are unwelcome in my presence.

441
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:04,163
The predictable heart
that never thaws.

442
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:08,083
Pity it beats within such a fool.

443
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,836
The eldest of the immortals. . .

444
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:15,257
. . .yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

445
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:20,804
We are oddities of nature, you and l.
Nothing more.

446
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,557
This is a world for humanity.

447
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:27,895
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

448
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,564
Why you stood by
for over half a millennium. . .

449
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:34,318
. . .as William suffered alone
in darkness?

450
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,820
No, Father.

451
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,824
l have no respect
for your petty sentiment.

452
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,537
Viktor's key. Where is it?

453
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,499
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

454
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,835
-You cannot control your brother.
-Oh, l am stronger now.

455
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:55,422
And our bond is greater than you
have ever wanted to acknowledge.

456
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,924
You're wrong.

457
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,344
Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans,
just like before.

458
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,179
Oh, not Lycans, Father. . .

459
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,473
. . .or Vampires.

460
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:09,186
A new race, created in
the image of their maker. . .

461
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,897
. . .their new god:

462
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,860
Me.

463
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,250
And a true god. . .

464
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:37,589
. . . has no father.

465
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,586
You will fail.

466
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,165
-Get the kit.
-No.

467
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:03,800
Please, sir, let us help you.

468
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,303
The time has come, my friend.

469
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,431
Find the girl.

470
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,935
Bring her to me.

471
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:19,733
No, wait. Wait.

472
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,531
lf you want Marcus,
you'll need Alexander's help.

473
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,331
Don't leave him here.

474
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:58,689
-Did he get the pendant?
-Yes.

475
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,109
He's too powerful for you alone.

476
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,736
You are the only one
older than he is. . .

477
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,905
. . .the only one stronger.

478
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,491
You could have killed him yourself.

479
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,704
No matter what he's become. . .

480
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,498
. . . he is my son.

481
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:25,590
You are the last hope left.

482
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:29,845
There is only one way
to defeat him.

483
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:39,229
Quickly, now. . .

484
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:43,400
. . . before there is no more legacy
left in my veins.

485
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:54,077
What will l become?

486
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,539
The future.

487
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:42,167
Go now.

488
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,187
We're getting close.

489
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,661
Head back around
towards the river.

490
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:42,801
l don't see a way inside.

491
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,305
There used to be
a river entrance just there.

492
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,557
lt must be submerged now.

493
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,226
Looks like we're getting wet.

494
01:19:27,555 --> 01:19:29,139
Closer.

495
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,312
Selene.

496
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:50,845
William.

497
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,862
Wait.

498
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,369
No, William. Stop.

499
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,496
Be still, brother.

500
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:18,164
lt's me.

501
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:24,504
l'd no sooner harm you than myself.

502
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,204
Which way?

503
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,984
ls this it?

504
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,157
He's already here.

505
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,692
What is that?

506
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:13,112
Nothing. Let's go.

507
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,334
We're too late.

508
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:55,530
-After him.
-Get behind him.

509
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,582
lmpressive.

510
01:25:15,486 --> 01:25:16,986
MichaeI, you're unique.

511
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:22,158
There's never been
a hybrid before.

512
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:25,036
Your powers couId be IimitIess.

513
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:44,722
Hold it! Oh, fuck.

514
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:51,229
-Where is he?
-He went right through there.

515
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:55,691
All we have are UV rounds.
They won't take him down.

516
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,361
No, but they'll slow him down.

517
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,284
Let's go.

518
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:48,035
You all right?

519
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:06,656
Jesus Christ!

520
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:00,186
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

521
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:01,729
No, these were raging monsters.

522
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,065
Unable to take human form
ever again.

523
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:56,408
What are you waiting for?
Shoot them.

524
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:59,328
l can't. Not without taking her out.

525
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:00,704
l can't get a shot.

526
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:53,716
Michael.

527
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:32,087
Take her down.

528
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:05,329
Cut us loose!

529
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:10,793
We're going down !

530
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:51,852
William !

531
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:06,408
l knew Viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet.

532
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:10,287
He should have killed you
with the rest of your family.

533
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:01,750
An unknown chapter Iies ahead.

534
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:05,212
The Iines that had divided the cIans
have now been bIurred.

535
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:08,340
Chaos and infighting are inevitabIe.

536
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:12,094
