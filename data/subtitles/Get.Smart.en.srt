00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,500
greetings from roNy
300MBUNiTED

1
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,775
And this display is all that's left
of CONTROL, a secret spy agency...

2
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:31,643
...which once battled against
the criminal syndicate known as KAOS.

3
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,547
CONTROL was disbanded
at the end of the Cold War.

4
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:37,979
Okay, up next, an exhibit...

5
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:48,689
Judy, the elevator is still doing that thing
where it drops really fast.

6
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,522
Are you sure Maintenance fixed that?

7
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,027
Let me check.

8
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:53,960
Yep, they fixed it.

9
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,198
See you later.

10
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:02,035
- Hey, Max.
- Agent 50.

11
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:05,668
16 floors down,
how'd a fly even get in here?

12
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,209
- Hey, Max.
- Max!

13
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,710
Hey, Larabee, 91.

14
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,442
Yeah, big day. Could be
your last chance to push a pencil.

15
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,449
Field-agent test results are due.

16
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,716
Oh. Is that today?
I wasn't really thinking about it.

17
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,325
Can you imagine Max as an agent?
Little suit, little shoes.

18
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:24,284
Uh-oh. Two-nerd pile-up.

19
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,760
- Move!
- Ow!

20
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,697
Pretty boys. Nothing but empty suits.

21
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:33,895
- Good morning, Bruce, Lloyd.
- Why would you wanna be an agent?

22
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:37,838
I mean, lab guys like us, analysts like you,
we're the real soldiers.

23
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,376
We're the true guardians
of freedom and democracy.

24
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,014
And I hear we're getting
a new cappuccino machine.

25
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,615
No, that's only for agents.

26
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,343
Oh.

27
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,158
Hey, Agent 23 is back.

28
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,273
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

29
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,878
- Welcome back, 23.
- Maxie.

30
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,912
So how was the assassination?

31
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,880
Maxie, you know assassinations
are specifically prohibited...

32
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,917
...by executive order 12333.

33
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:27,055
23, you kill me.

34
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,456
- I could if I wanted to.
- Yes, you... Oh. Oh!

35
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:32,153
Did you see that face he made? Scary.

36
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,500
Six months' work. 18 million dollars.

37
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,805
Fricking agents, man.

38
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,305
Come on, let's see it.

39
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:48,276
A lot of chatter in this region
involves nuclear material.

40
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:51,974
You may remember
from page 627 of my last report...

41
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,948
...that there has been an uptick
in KAOS interest in nukes.

42
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,022
To wit, I offer
the following conversation.

43
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,353
What are you doing? Are you texting?

44
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,758
Yeah, letting my fiancée know
we won't be able to get married in June.

45
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,489
I'll still be in this meeting.

46
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,025
Can I see that a second?
- Yeah.

47
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:11,459
That's great.

48
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,863
That's weird. You lost your signal.

49
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,008
Sorry to interrupt, Maxie, go ahead.

50
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,772
Next time use your own damn phone.

51
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,206
Good morning, men. No, offense, Karen.

52
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,644
Snappy tie.

53
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,614
Sorry I'm late, but I just came out
of a budget meeting...

54
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:31,779
...with our incredibly abrasive, dismissive
and sarcastic vice president.

55
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:33,117
It's no problem.

56
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:38,286
I have obtained a snippet,
at great risk to a busboy in Balahd.

57
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,297
"Aftab, how is your coffee?"

58
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,137
"Good, Dalip, it's decaf.

59
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,271
How is yours?"

60
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,569
"It is good also.

61
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:56,277
How is your muffin?"

62
00:06:57,816 --> 00:06:59,181
Powerful stuff.

63
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:02,018
So "muffin," then, is a code word?

64
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,848
No, it is comfort food...

65
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:06,889
...and quite frankly, more
fattening than most people realize.

66
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,458
Which begs the question...

67
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:12,791
...why would two
hardened KAOS agents...

68
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:15,762
...risk the carbs?

69
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,259
Because they are under
a great deal of stress.

70
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,099
- Hence the decaf.
- For Aftab, yes.

71
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,639
Dalip takes his full-strength. Why?

72
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,607
Because he has been sleeping
on the couch for three days...

73
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:30,070
...because he called his sister-in-law
a "leathery hag."

74
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:33,074
People often say things
in anger they don't really mean.

75
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:37,244
Leathery hag, fat cow, ungrateful whore.

76
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:42,291
Just words, really, that shouldn't
be used against you in a custody hearing.

77
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:46,025
Let it go, man. Those kids
don't even look like you.

78
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:48,125
Can we put a pin in this, please...

79
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,064
...and go back to Max's
extraordinarily detailed report?

80
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,999
Thank you, Chief. All I'm saying is...

81
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:56,038
...that until we understand
that our enemies are also human...

82
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,869
...we will never defeat them.

83
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:03,709
Yes, they are bad guys, but that
is what they do, not who they are.

84
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:05,778
Let's continue listening...

85
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:09,819
...and bear in mind that the next 100 pages
can get a little bit dry.

86
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,785
Come on...

87
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:26,360
Easy, Durat! This stuff is radioactive.

88
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,506
One slip-up, and it's "ka-fricking-boom!"

89
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:29,833
Shtarker.

90
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:35,078
This is KAOS.
We don't "ka-fricking-boom" here.

91
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,207
Sorry, Mr. Siegfried.

92
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:40,818
Get it in the truck,
and let's burn this place to the ground.

93
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,477
But if we have what we want,
why burn the building?

94
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:53,126
Any more questions?

95
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,348
Missed me!

96
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,786
All right! All right! I'm out!

97
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,953
He was lying, Max. It was a good shot.

98
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,428
Thanks.

99
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,295
I am so sick of training.
I wanna get out in the field.

100
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:34,235
Give it up, 23! It's just you
and Maxi-pad against the six of us.

101
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:37,637
Oh, gee, Maxi-pad,
I've never heard that one before!

102
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,044
I never have actually heard that before.

103
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,279
23, you're bleeding.

104
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:52,348
It's a knife wound from the last mission.
My blood gets pumping, it seeps.

105
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:53,889
Hey, Maxine!

106
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,789
Come over here
and we'll play a game I like to call:

107
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:58,827
"Let's Go to the Dog Show."

108
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:01,124
I put a collar on you
and make you my bi...!

109
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:08,173
I think I really got inside his head.

110
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,004
I am not proud of what I just did.

111
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:11,802
Game over, Chatty Cathy.

112
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:19,815
Game over when I say it's over.

113
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,775
- Okay.
- Wet willy.

114
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,283
Okay. Who wants lunch?

115
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:28,824
Well, excellent work, 23,
but I could've handled it my...

116
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,366
- Max, the Chief wants to see you.
- It is nice to see you too!

117
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:44,172
You wanted to see me, Chief?

118
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:46,810
Yes, Max, yes, please, sit down.

119
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:50,505
Your field-agent test results
just came in and...

120
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,579
- Something wrong with your ear?
- Absolutely not.

121
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:57,187
Would you like me
to wait while you answer that?

122
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:58,447
Answer what?

123
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,557
Nothing. You were saying?

124
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,125
I was saying the results
are quite extraordinary.

125
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,287
In fact, your essay on existentialism
was quite amazing.

126
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:07,988
I left that section blank.

127
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,963
Blank? Brilliant.

128
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,625
Brilliant, Max.

129
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,465
- You passed with flying colors.
- Yes!

130
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,130
You know what, sir?
I can't say that I am shocked.

131
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,039
I felt good about this year's test,
in light of the fact...

132
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:22,907
...that in previous years,
my fitness has been an issue.

133
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:31,446
Personal best.

134
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:34,524
But not anymore. I'm ready for duty.

135
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,820
I know how hard
you've prepared for this...

136
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:38,792
...and how much this means to you...

137
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,125
...but I'm afraid I can't promote you.

138
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,826
- What?
- I can't afford to give up my best analyst.

139
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:48,200
I mean, the amount of chatter
you get through, and the reports...

140
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,500
...I mean, they go way beyond
the raw data.

141
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:57,273
So to be clear, you're not promoting me,
because I do such a great job.

142
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:01,552
Max, the way you and I work
is becoming a lost art form.

143
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,518
I spend half my days
trying to convince the vice president...

144
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:07,487
...that intelligence comes
from humans and not satellites.

145
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:11,095
Men with hunches,
that's where the real work gets done.

146
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:13,196
I'm very proud of you, Max...

147
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,893
...very proud of you...

148
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,932
...but I need you where you are.

149
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:44,224
<i>I am sorry, but we can never be.</i>

150
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,423
Despite today's setback,
I will at some point become a field agent...

151
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,862
...and when that happens...

152
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,300
...one phone call could take me
to the other side of the world.

153
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:57,739
Who am I kidding? I'm a middle-aged
man who's missed the train.

154
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,039
You don't deserve this.
I don't deserve you.

155
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,681
You're so young and so full of life.

156
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,876
Don't do it, Fang.

157
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,049
Don't love me.

158
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:12,853
Here.

159
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,992
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

160
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,628
That was my last mile.
I have no idea how fast it was.

161
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,128
You were moving.
It's not easy to knock me down.

162
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:22,528
I have a low center of gravity.
Pretty solid.

163
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,033
I'm just gonna call that one a 4:50.

164
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:29,196
Impressive. I once ran a 5:16.

165
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:32,241
Oh, really? That's, uh, slower.

166
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,900
Not everything's a competition.

167
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:35,908
Well, if it were, I'd win.

168
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,276
Ah. Are you flirting with me?

169
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,443
Not at all. Are you flirting with me?

170
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,382
That depends. Is it working?

171
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,753
Not at all.

172
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,392
Well, nice meeting you!
I admire your focus!

173
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,588
Am I invisible?

174
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,265
Bruce, Lloyd, what happened?

175
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,962
And what is that ungodly smell?

176
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,637
Fear.

177
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,673
I'll be back.

178
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:46,909
Freeze.

179
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,382
Freeze.

180
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,544
- No, you freeze.
- You freeze.

181
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,849
- I told you to freeze.
- Freeze times infinity.

182
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,321
Oh, my God.

183
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,525
- You.
- You.

184
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,491
- Are you CONTROL?
- I'm Maxwell Smart.

185
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:00,631
I am a CONTROL analyst. Who are you?

186
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,958
I'm Agent 99.

187
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:07,332
Oh, my word. You are Agent 99?

188
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:10,235
- I am a huge fan!
- Thank you.

189
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,514
What are you doing?

190
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:24,711
I'm right here, just talk to me!

191
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,323
I'm going to cause a diversion.
You run and get help.

192
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:29,460
- I really don't think that that's a...
- Shh.

193
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,561
- Did you just...?
- Shh!

194
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:50,941
Go, go, go!

195
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:52,473
Wait!

196
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,284
Somebody shut it off!

197
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:07,026
Good, 23, just in time.
I think I got one of them.

198
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,659
Is that the Chief?

199
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,730
Yes, it is.

200
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,133
Sorry about that, Chief.

201
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,731
Is that a dent in his head?

202
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,321
Hi. Hi.

203
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:39,327
Agent 13, you are in a tree.

204
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:42,762
Yeah, communications got knocked down,
so they put me in a tree.

205
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,925
- Old-school stuff.
- Glad to see you're okay.

206
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:46,127
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:50,004
Well, I have to get going.
Would you raise up the walkway, please?

208
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,472
You don't have to get going.
You don't have to go.

209
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,838
Yeah, I've got a meeting.

210
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,604
- How you been?
- I've been well.

211
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,510
- Everything good?
- It's great. Well, I gotta...

212
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,275
Could you come back this way?

213
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,147
Yeah, yeah, I think I will.

214
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,819
What time?

215
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,815
Well... Mm.

216
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:09,955
I get it.

217
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:13,053
Who wants to talk to a guy in a tree?

218
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:14,528
I get it.

219
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,431
Hang in there.
Don't cry, don't... Please don't cry.

220
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,550
Okay. Let's get started.

221
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,388
You'll have to bear with me,
I'm still a little fuzzy.

222
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:47,030
I got a pretty good
hit in the head yesterday.

223
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:51,191
Yes, it was dark in there.
You probably tripped.

224
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:54,429
I hurt my knee. It was smoky too.

225
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:57,932
All right, here's what we know.

226
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:00,907
Wait. Chief, I request
the cone of silence.

227
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,810
Max, not the cone of silence.
We're in a safe room, for God's sakes.

228
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,575
We thought CONTROL was safe.

229
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,683
Okay. Lloyd.

230
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:16,457
Okay, we have reason to believe
that our security was breached by KAOS.

231
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,891
- You have to speak up.
- Can you hear me?

232
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,894
- I'm not hearing anyone.
- What?

233
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,999
Can you hear me?
- What did you say?

234
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,727
- Bruce, it's not working.
- It's not working!

235
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,803
Chief! I hit you in the head
with a fire extinguisher!

236
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,942
No, no, no, we're not ready yet.

237
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,044
Okay. All right.

238
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,476
- It doesn't work, get rid of it.
- Turn it off.

239
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:39,241
This thing is no good.
It's a useless piece of garbage.

240
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,578
- Turn it off!
- Larabee, you all right?

241
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,687
Larabee wants out!

242
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:51,224
Today's the day, and we're gonna
get rid of this damn thing.

243
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,990
That is cold. That's cold.
- All right, easy.

244
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:55,792
All right, are we done?

245
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,332
Yep. I can hear now.

246
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:00,596
Sorry, Chief, someone led me to believe
the cone was ready.

247
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,468
For the record, I never actually
used the word "ready."

248
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:06,201
"I'll show them the cone.
The cone's the shizzle."

249
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:07,776
- You said that to me.
- All right, shut up.

250
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,503
Listen up, people.

251
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,012
There's been a rash of thefts
of nuclear material...

252
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,617
...especially yellowcake,
over the last three months.

253
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:19,416
Now, based on Max's intel, we were
able to get Agent 38 inside KAOS.

254
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,785
We must've been close
to uncovering something...

255
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,790
...so KAOS hit us and they hit us hard.

256
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:25,752
They hacked our system...

257
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,630
...and learned the identities
of all our field agents.

258
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,859
Around the world
our people are under attack.

259
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:41,939
Our only lead is the maker of the bomb
KAOS used against us.

260
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:43,637
Vladimir Krs...

261
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,749
- It's pronounced "Krstic," sir.
- Yes...

262
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:48,483
Krstic.

263
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:54,321
Yes. He is a Bosnian national, and one
of KAOS' favorite munitions suppliers.

264
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,290
Unfortunately, we have no idea
where he is.

265
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,589
Actually, sir, we do. He is in Russia.

266
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:02,790
- How do you know that?
- It was on page 482 of my report.

267
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:06,763
Doesn't anybody read my reports?

268
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:11,463
All right, our mission is clear, people.
Find Krs...

269
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,234
- Krstic.
- Yes. Find him!

270
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,402
- Kris Kringle. Fish stick.
- Yes, Krs...

271
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,172
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
- Krstic.

272
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:20,943
Use him to get to KAOS,
then recover the stolen nuclear material...

273
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,553
...before they can do something
less than friendly...

274
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:27,680
...and maybe, if we're lucky,
we can apprehend the man behind it all...

275
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,951
...Siegfried.

276
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,028
Pictured here with his
number two man, Shtarker.

277
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:35,029
How are we gonna do that
when our agents are compromised?

278
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,066
Put me out there, Chief.
I'm not afraid to expose myself.

279
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,295
Do you ever think before you speak?

280
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,871
No, I just whip it out there.
It's what's best.

281
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,701
Fortunately, we have other options.

282
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:49,643
99 recently underwent massive plastic
surgery, so her new face is not known yet.

283
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:52,749
We also have a new agent, Agent 86.

284
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,179
Who's that, sir?

285
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:55,979
It's you, Max.

286
00:20:57,788 --> 00:20:59,415
All right, Maxie.

287
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:01,715
You did it.

288
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,424
Lloyd, may I have the C.O.S. please?

289
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:11,428
I'm so happy!

290
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:15,698
I'm so happy!
This is the best day of my life!

291
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:21,378
Max, you didn't push
the button hard enough.

292
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,037
- So you could hear me?
- Yes.

293
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:27,215
- Right.
- Excuse me, Chief, just a thought.

294
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:31,321
- I'm not questioning your judgment...
- 99, I insist on complete honesty.

295
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:34,515
If you have something to say to me,
I wish you would just say it.

296
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:37,024
Max has no experience.
I don't want him as my partner.

297
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,596
Well, that is a sucker punch
to the gonads.

298
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,036
Hey, Max. We got you a lovely
parting gift for your first mission.

299
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,469
Oh, a pocketknife.

300
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,972
Not just a pocketknife, Swiss Army knife.

301
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,634
Comes with tweezers, pliers,
a tiny magnifying glass.

302
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:57,975
Fish scaler, a saw, a flamethrower,
chisel, a wire-crimping tool.

303
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:00,014
- What was that thing you said?
- Chisel?

304
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,947
Before that.
Did you say flamethrower?

305
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,450
- Yeah.
- Check it.

306
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,251
We also added a crossbow
that fires harpoons...

307
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:12,157
...connected to spider-silk nano-thread.
Has the strength of steel cable.

308
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,821
It's a time-consuming,
labor-intensive technology.

309
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,126
The spiders
have to be individually milked.

310
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,269
And they do not like it.

311
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:20,768
No, they don't.

312
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,906
Gentlemen, you're the best.

313
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:24,431
Thanks.

314
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:43,892
Ladies and gentlemen,
while you are in your seats...

315
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:46,256
...please keep your seatbelts fastened.

316
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,758
I feel really good about us as partners.

317
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,629
23 says that's important.

318
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,998
"Trust is a must." That's what 23 says.

319
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:56,196
Does he?

320
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,366
You and I share a bond, I think.

321
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:03,707
We both know what it feels like to look
in the mirror and not like what we see.

322
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:06,679
You with the surgery,
me with the weight loss.

323
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:08,942
I wanna show you something.

324
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,216
That was me.

325
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,292
Wow, impressive.

326
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,121
Congratulations.

327
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,786
Thank you.

328
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,335
This is me.

329
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,899
Wow.

330
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,972
Very impressive, 99.

331
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,235
You were truly hideous back then.

332
00:23:35,813 --> 00:23:38,338
Since we are going
to be portraying husband and wife...

333
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:40,882
...maybe we should get our story set.

334
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:42,708
Okay, good idea.

335
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:49,082
We met at a marketing convention in Vegas.
Married a year later. No kids.

336
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,160
I like your parents, but you hate mine.

337
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,694
Do we want kids?

338
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:55,730
Well, you do,
but I'm concentrating on my career.

339
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,664
I don't know if that's fair.
I mean, I'm older than you are.

340
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:01,862
- Well, not by much.
- Really?

341
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,774
When they gave me a new face,
I had them...

342
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,704
...take a couple years off.

343
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,370
You know, why not?

344
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:16,915
Well, if that's the case, then you are
at an advanced age, and you should be...

345
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,885
Well, no. I was never...

346
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:23,254
I'm just saying that your eggs could dry up
and fall out of your uterus.

347
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:25,793
So time is of the essence.

348
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:29,866
- That's your opinion.
- No, that is a medical fact.

349
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:32,730
There is a lot of time
for me to make this decision.

350
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:35,303
I will not be rushed into it
by you or my mother.

351
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,907
- You don't have much time.
- Where is the drink cart?

352
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:43,602
Uh-oh.

353
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,544
- What?
- Six o'clock.

354
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,012
Don't turn around, don't turn around.
Use your peripherals.

355
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:55,789
Do you see him?

356
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,325
I'm just widening my eyes.
I'm not actually seeing anything more.

357
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,931
The big guy that might as well
be holding up a sign:

358
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,896
"I'm an assassin, here to kill you."

359
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,468
Okay, 99, you know what?
That is profiling.

360
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:11,267
Just because he is large doesn't
necessarily mean that he is a bad guy.

361
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:15,737
Oh. Wow.

362
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:19,007
That's a bad guy.
That's a really bad guy.

363
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:20,946
- You don't say.
- Did you see his face?

364
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:22,142
Yes.

365
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,686
His head looks like
one of the Easter Island heads.

366
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:29,916
You know what?
I'm doing the same thing.

367
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:32,961
That's profiling,
and I will have none of it.

368
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,964
Darn it, I have gum on my new shoes.

369
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:44,304
- He's trying to light his shoe.
- It's a shoe bomb!

370
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:45,737
- Get him!
- It's gum.

371
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,402
- He's got a gun!
- Not... Gum! Not... No! Gum!

372
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,174
Gum!

373
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,376
Federal marshal, you're under arrest.

374
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,955
Sir, I believe you just shattered
my coccyx.

375
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:03,988
<i>Folks, we may</i>
<i>be experiencing a little turbulence.</i>

376
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:06,721
<i>The "fasten seatbelt" sign</i>
<i>has been turned on.</i>

377
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,330
Well, you were no help whatsoever.

378
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:15,199
How could I help?
I'm just a woman with a dusty old uterus.

379
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:17,670
I never said dusty.

380
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:20,368
We're close to the drop site.
I'll go first.

381
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,570
- Gonna be all right with your cuffs?
- No cuffs can contain me.

382
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:27,373
Excuse me, violent sky marshal.

383
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,547
What do you want?

384
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,187
I have to squeeze the lemon.

385
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:32,845
Ugh.

386
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:34,723
You heard me.

387
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:37,087
Squeeze the lemon.

388
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:53,608
- Do you work out?
- Occasionally.

389
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:55,938
Yeah, I'm big on protein. Protein's great.

390
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,926
I gotta get it out. I gotta get that out!

391
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,799
That's in there, that's in there.

392
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:27,237
No time for pain.

393
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,106
Over the drop zone.

394
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,150
Ball sack!

395
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,257
Son of a hamster.

396
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:50,662
You all right in there?
- Yeah. Yes, I am.

397
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,095
Everything's fine.

398
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:54,328
Mother of pearl!

399
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,237
That burns!

400
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:04,745
Last chance.

401
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,016
<i>Airlock activated. Three, two, one.</i>

402
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,425
First package away.

403
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,937
Absolutely, I love cats.

404
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:29,129
- Really?
- Yeah.

405
00:28:35,312 --> 00:28:36,779
Damn.

406
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,192
Second package away.

407
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,648
Oh, good, you heard me.

408
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,384
Third package away.

409
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:19,513
Third package?

410
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,890
99, Easter Island.

411
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:39,940
- I'll be right back!
- Where could you possibly be going?

412
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:08,166
Okay, never do that again!

413
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,363
Stop hanging on me!
- Never! Stop it!

414
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,377
Max, I can't reach my reserve!
Do something!

415
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:30,424
That would have definitely
worked on me.

416
00:30:30,594 --> 00:30:34,963
Are you crazy?
If I can't pull my chute, you'll die too!

417
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:56,813
Aim for the haystack.
- Stop talking.

418
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,751
- Aim for the haystack, it's softer.
- Stop talking!

419
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,924
You missed it.

420
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:33,816
Okay, not to keep dwelling on this...

421
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:36,323
...but that was some kiss.

422
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,017
How did you know that would work?

423
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:40,857
Have you kissed other men
who plummeted to their deaths?

424
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:42,055
Okay, you know what?

425
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:46,635
So far, our entire partnership has consisted
of me getting you out of trouble.

426
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,068
Do you know why?
It is because you keep leading.

427
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,701
So here's how we stop that. I lead now.

428
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,002
I'm the one with experience.
You know nothing.

429
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:55,868
I beg to differ.

430
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:58,742
I looked up your field agent exam,
and I scored...

431
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,907
- My what?
- Your field agent exam.

432
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:02,847
I scored eight points higher than you.

433
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,112
This is not a classroom.

434
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:06,813
That's the difference between
an A plus and an A minus.

435
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,721
- You'll get us killed if you don't listen!
- A minus!

436
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:14,328
Okay, you're faced with an assassin.
What do you do?

437
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:17,934
- I take out my gun, and I would shoot...
- You don't have a gun.

438
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,864
- I did until you took it.
- Bang. You're dead.

439
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:21,265
- No, I'm not.
- Bang. You're dead.

440
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:22,700
- Stop shooting me.
- You are dead.

441
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,841
- I don't like it when you shoot me.
- Bang. Bang. Bang.

442
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:26,168
- Stop it.
- Bang. Bang.

443
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:29,506
Stop shooting me more.
You already said I was... Hey.

444
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,537
Throw out your manual.

445
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:35,116
Out here there are no grades,
there's only dead, and not dead.

446
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,247
You know, I am not completely
incompetent without a gun.

447
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:43,450
I am a master in the art of Hwa Rang Do.

448
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:48,924
- I was not ready.
- That's my point.

449
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,396
Yeah, you know what? That...

450
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,728
Hey, what was that?

451
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:01,539
Max is halfway to Moscow. Don't tell me
you're still translating that Russian.

452
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:03,270
They talk fast, it's hard.

453
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:06,939
It takes like eight of these morons
to do what Max did.

454
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:09,312
I can't wait till we finish
the Hymie project.

455
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:11,511
All these stupid agents will be obsolete.

456
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:13,178
- Bye-bye.
- What's a Hymie?

457
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:16,451
Hybrid Mechanical Intelligence Entity.
Basically a robot.

458
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,561
It's a stolen KAOS technology.

459
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:21,129
Being reprogrammed. Top-secret.
Need-to-know.

460
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:22,993
And you don't need.

461
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,665
I'm a trained killer.
I can kill you with anything in this office.

462
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:29,806
You wanna die by Post-its?
Because I could make that happen.

463
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:31,668
And that's a slow death.

464
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:34,507
Larabee.
- Yeah.

465
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,407
- Were you the last one to use the copier?
- Yeah.

466
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,740
You left it jammed.

467
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,247
So? Why don't you...

468
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:41,914
...unjam it?

469
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:45,077
- Just open the door, read the instructions.
- This your stapler?

470
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:47,815
- Yeah, want me to show you how to use it?
- No.

471
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,583
Unjam that.

472
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,989
- 23.
- Yes.

473
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:54,687
- Can I have a moment, please?
- Sure.

474
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,526
Yes, Chief.

475
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,863
Let me tell you about a pattern
that's beginning to emerge.

476
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,232
As a former field agent,
I'm very much aware...

477
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:05,500
...of how difficult it is
to make the transition to office life.

478
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,200
He didn't unjam the copier.

479
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:10,642
We have rules here. If you don't
follow the rules, then what are we?

480
00:34:10,814 --> 00:34:14,978
I'll tell you what we're not. We're not
people who jam staples into people's heads.

481
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,779
That's CIA crap.

482
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,149
All right, look, Chief, I'm your best guy.

483
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,815
I don't belong in an office making copies.
I should be out there with Max.

484
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:25,427
Look, 23, no more stapling today.

485
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:28,160
Just hold on.

486
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:36,563
So how do you know this place?

487
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,038
Well, as an analyst,
I like to keep my ears open.

488
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:40,608
It's amazing what you learn...

489
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:44,577
...listening to chatter.
In fact, Ladislas Krstic loves this place.

490
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:49,685
As do many KAOS agents.
Café Minsk-Pinsk in Smolensk.

491
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,048
It doesn't get any better than "thinsk."

492
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:55,391
You see what I just did?

493
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:58,187
I added an "insk" at the end,
made it sound Russian.

494
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,920
Should've smacked you harder.

495
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,428
Is that your default setting?

496
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:04,066
Do you just punch people
in the face willy-nilly?

497
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:06,202
"It's Tuesday,
I'll punch Max in the face."

498
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,066
"A box of kittens,
time to punch Max in the face."

499
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,571
"I'm having bread,
time to punch Max in the face."

500
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,266
You know, I love bread...

501
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:15,775
...and I know bread
has a few carbs, but...

502
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:18,005
...l've never really been afraid of carbs...

503
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:22,618
...because it seems like no matter
how many I eat, I stay "thinsk."

504
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,063
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

505
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:41,966
No <i>sprechen Sie</i> Russian.

506
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:29,018
Boy, you know what? I will tell you,
I love your country.

507
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:32,485
No more Communism.
No rules of any kind, really.

508
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:36,319
I'm filling my suitcase with steroids
and art from ancient Mesopotamia.

509
00:36:36,493 --> 00:36:40,122
Ran over an old woman yesterday.
Best vacation I've ever had.

510
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,825
Time to take my pill.

511
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:54,641
There was a guy in the bathroom
who's really hot.

512
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,803
Okay...

513
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:00,108
No, no, no. Radioactive hot.

514
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:03,548
Although he did have a certain
rugged quality that some find appealing.

515
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,688
How did you know he was radioactive?

516
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:09,548
My watch is a Geiger counter.
You don't have one of these? Huh.

517
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:12,962
Listen, I think he was part
of the nuclear theft in Chechnya.

518
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,324
We should follow him.

519
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,125
I gotta say, Max...

520
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,334
...you picked a good restaurant.

521
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:57,431
Of course.

522
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,674
Tripe soup.

523
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:02,937
- This must be Ladislas Krstic's house.
- What?

524
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:06,674
Tripe soup is his favorite dish.
It was in the mission dossier.

525
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,943
Let's just see what we're
up against, okay?

526
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:19,518
I didn't get to eat at the restaurant.

527
00:38:19,696 --> 00:38:22,893
And if you skip a meal,
the next meal you overindulge.

528
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,125
- Well, let me. I've got nails.
- It's a recipe for...

529
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,401
You owe me $3.

530
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:33,436
More guards.
We'll have to figure out a way in.

531
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:40,373
Miniature blowgun.

532
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,745
You don't have one of these?

533
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:46,980
These darts are tipped with a tranquilizer
derived from the skin of a lizard...

534
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,284
...known as <i>los zapatos de la muerte.</i>

535
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:50,551
"The shoes of death."

536
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:52,758
Excuse me.

537
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:56,493
They're 40 yards out,
that's definitely the edge of my range.

538
00:38:56,666 --> 00:39:00,329
I'm going to have to give this one
a little something extra.

539
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:17,576
Wow.

540
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,312
You look spectacular.

541
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:20,615
Thanks.

542
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,755
You don't look too bad yourself.

543
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:25,289
Is that a wig?

544
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:26,986
Yeah, it came with the dress.

545
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:31,691
- How did I get into these clothes?
- That's not important. Let's go.

546
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,268
Am I wearing boxers?

547
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:42,540
For future reference,
I usually prefer briefs...

548
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:45,146
...for their security and peace of mind.

549
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:47,647
Going free-bird is not exactly ideal.

550
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,645
I don't like it.

551
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,469
There must be 200 people here.

552
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:10,731
Finding Krstic will be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

553
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:20,911
I'd love to dance.

554
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:25,043
English? But you understand Russian?
Very impressive.

555
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:27,314
Shall we?

556
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:29,853
I hope your date doesn't mind.

557
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:31,926
Oh, he's not my date.

558
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:35,258
He's just a local horse groomer
I hired to drive me around.

559
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:39,425
It's a tragic story. He's quite deaf.
Really not bright.

560
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,931
I am going to dance now.

561
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,176
You go get yourself some punch.

562
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:50,845
Okay.

563
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,550
I don't even know
how much gets through.

564
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:04,916
Chief, I need your help.

565
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,426
You're on. Go ahead.

566
00:41:06,596 --> 00:41:07,722
<i>We have found Krstic.</i>

567
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:10,457
<i>I searched his house.</i>
<i>I can't find his computer network.</i>

568
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:12,262
Get me an infrared satellite scan.

569
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:15,529
I have to get back to 99,
she is in grave danger.

570
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,708
Your house is so beautiful.

571
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:23,444
It must be difficult to go to work.

572
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,881
I don't have to go very far.

573
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:04,281
I don't think so.

574
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:06,179
I wasn't talking to you.

575
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,484
Me?

576
00:42:13,263 --> 00:42:14,423
I don't know.

577
00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:16,155
It'll be fun.

578
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:17,590
Trust me.

579
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:11,216
You are so light on your feet.

580
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:12,820
I recently lost 150 pounds.

581
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:14,953
So did I.

582
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:17,354
Isn't it great?
I have so much more energy now.

583
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:18,994
Me too.

584
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:27,923
- Thanks for jumping.
- No problem.

585
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:53,813
Thank you for the lovely dance.

586
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:17,443
Did you see anything
while I was dancing?

587
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,981
Just once, but I don't think you expected
him to lift you so high.

588
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,378
Anyway, I found out that the office
is in the guest house.

589
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,147
Really? How'd you do that?

590
00:45:27,323 --> 00:45:29,985
Show him a little décolletage,
cleavage, bat your eyes?

591
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,150
I'm not judging, just detecting a pattern.

592
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:34,694
- Ready to work?
- I'm ready to work. You ready?

593
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:36,798
- Oh, my God.
- You're just having fun showing your:

594
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:47,572
Six guards.
We are going to need another way in.

595
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,905
Stand by, Max. Larabee, let's go. Move it.

596
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:52,473
- What'd you do?
- I can't find the right screen.

597
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,844
It was here a second ago,
then it went away.

598
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,680
- What did you hit?
- Don't yell at me. It's not helping!

599
00:45:57,854 --> 00:45:59,321
If you don't find that screen...

600
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,424
...l'm gonna have you hunting
for land mines, with a hammer!

601
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:07,419
<i>Got it, Max. There is one other entrance.</i>

602
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:08,655
What kind of entrance?

603
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:11,732
The kind where you'll wanna
throw your shoes out afterwards.

604
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:16,395
Oh, great, rats.
It's not enough that there's poop.

605
00:46:16,572 --> 00:46:21,509
You know what, I never saw James Bond
in rats or poop, let alone rats and poop.

606
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:25,279
Look, a rat riding on a piece of poop.

607
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:28,178
Stop it. It's just a storm drain.

608
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:33,888
Here it is.

609
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:48,897
Exploding dental floss.
You don't have this? Hm.

610
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:00,381
Three, two...

611
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,074
...one.

612
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:26,601
Right.

613
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:33,608
Come on.

614
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,132
Are you staring at my butt?

615
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:54,799
No, I am not.

616
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:57,303
I might have been before, but I am...

617
00:47:57,473 --> 00:48:00,203
Now I am again. All right, I'm stopping.

618
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:03,436
Pay attention to what I'm doing,
so that you can follow me exactly.

619
00:48:03,846 --> 00:48:05,108
Yep.

620
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,799
Okay, Max. Little heads-up.

621
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:31,030
High-intensity lasers. Whatever
part of you does touch gets sliced.

622
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:34,370
One more reason
why boxers were a bad idea.

623
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:49,056
All right, so do I have to do it
exactly like that?

624
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:50,419
Just come on.

625
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,540
That's impressive. Wow.

626
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,540
Careful, this one's tricky.

627
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:12,180
Good.

628
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:13,372
Very good.

629
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,745
Okay, it's not that good.

630
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:37,633
Max. Max.

631
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,136
Stay calm.

632
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:43,739
Max, keep it together. Keep it together.

633
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,304
Max. Max.

634
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,476
Careful! No, no.

635
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:51,552
He's nibbling. That's not cheese!

636
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:54,584
Max, be quiet!

637
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,890
Okay, shall we?

638
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:44,829
Did I hear something?

639
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:48,277
Yes, there were some
tap dancers in the hallway.

640
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:53,707
Damn it. I can't get into their system.
Biometric security.

641
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:55,646
If you don't mind, 99...

642
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:04,952
The old "steam sticks to everything
but the oil from the last thumb print" trick.

643
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:06,151
Here we go.

644
00:51:06,395 --> 00:51:09,626
- Shipments of explosives.
- Your boyfriend is a very bad man.

645
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:12,962
- And a really good kisser.
- Ignoring that.

646
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,802
Look at that shipment of detonators.
It's a little odd.

647
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,875
Well, he is a bomb-maker.

648
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:24,240
No. What is odd is that it was shipped
to a bakery in Moscow.

649
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:26,973
These detonators can also be used
for nuclear bombs.

650
00:51:27,149 --> 00:51:28,980
I think this is our connection to KAOS.

651
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:43,588
I set that up.

652
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,672
Let her go.

653
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,511
No.

654
00:52:01,517 --> 00:52:05,009
I'm not totally incompetent
without a gun, you know.

655
00:52:29,745 --> 00:52:30,871
Thanks for the help.

656
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:34,439
That's enough. Pity.

657
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:39,282
I'm about to shoot beautiful woman
and her retard stable boy.

658
00:52:39,488 --> 00:52:40,512
And yet...

659
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,585
...I will sleep like baby.

660
00:52:49,565 --> 00:52:52,090
- Not bad for a rookie.
- Not bad for an old lady.

661
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:03,938
Siegfried here.

662
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:06,240
<i>How could you possibly screw this up?</i>

663
00:53:06,415 --> 00:53:07,905
Krstic was a fool.

664
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,813
- And they got lucky.
- <i>Who's that? Who's speaking?</i>

665
00:53:10,986 --> 00:53:12,112
That's no one, sir.

666
00:53:12,288 --> 00:53:15,086
<i>They're heading towards you.</i>
<i>Don't disappoint me again.</i>

667
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:16,747
Don't worry, sir. They won't get pa...

668
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:19,586
Why does he do that?

669
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:21,627
Don't look at me. I'm no one.

670
00:53:21,797 --> 00:53:23,287
And don't you forget it.

671
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,829
Everyone here can be replaced.

672
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:27,662
I even have backup for you.

673
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,828
It's called a rhinoceros.

674
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:58,462
I think it's time to find new wheels.
Pull over.

675
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,873
I feel good about the mission so far,
don't you?

676
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:08,304
So far, sure.

677
00:54:08,477 --> 00:54:10,377
I think we work very well together.

678
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:11,877
Like at the mansion.

679
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:16,177
The way I held that guy's hair
while you punched him in the throat.

680
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:18,217
That was nice.

681
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:19,912
Nice?

682
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:21,750
Yeah, well, good teamwork.

683
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:23,391
What are you doing?

684
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:26,084
I'm just saying that I think
we're very compatible.

685
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:29,698
I think that you are confusing adrenaline
with, I don't know...

686
00:54:29,865 --> 00:54:31,423
...some other kind of hormone.

687
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,000
- No. That's not...
- Know what, Max? Just stop it.

688
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,901
Let me give you a lesson
that I had to learn the hard way.

689
00:54:38,073 --> 00:54:40,234
You can't trust anyone out here,
not even me.

690
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:43,105
I mean, you know,
I could be a double agent.

691
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,011
The break-in at CONTROL
was probably an inside job.

692
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:49,242
It happened just as I got back.
How do you know that it wasn't me?

693
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:52,779
- What are we talking about here?
- Let's just find a car.

694
00:54:52,955 --> 00:54:55,617
Which one's gonna attract
the least attention?

695
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,720
All right, well, we have
a couple Soviet-era sedans here...

696
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:03,296
...we have that tractor, that cart...

697
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,294
...and... That'll work.

698
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:10,170
- No.
- Yes.

699
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:11,738
No.

700
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:13,268
Yes.

701
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:19,904
- Oh, yeah, we are really under the radar.
- Will you relax?

702
00:55:20,082 --> 00:55:22,949
Since the fall of Communism,
everybody has one of these here.

703
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:52,142
There's our little KAOS bakery.

704
00:55:52,314 --> 00:55:55,442
I don't have to remind you,
but this isn't like the last place.

705
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:59,145
There's no party, there's no dancing.
Everyone in there is a trained killer.

706
00:55:59,321 --> 00:56:01,186
Do you understand? Okay.

707
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,825
Did they explain to you
how your belt buckle works?

708
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:07,019
No, but the technology for holding
up pants hasn't changed much.

709
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:09,164
- Max.
- Hey, what?

710
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,430
This one has a compartment.
Inside there's a pill.

711
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:15,661
If captured, it would cause death
in nine seconds.

712
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:16,862
Great.

713
00:56:17,406 --> 00:56:20,375
But how exactly do I get them to take it?

714
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:26,413
- Not much of a laugher, are you?
- Here. Put this on.

715
00:56:26,582 --> 00:56:27,981
- On what?
- On your molar.

716
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,278
It's a tooth radio. It sends sound
up your jawbone, into your ear.

717
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:35,617
I can't hear anything outside your mouth,
so if you get in trouble, you have to say so.

718
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:36,780
Is it working?

719
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:42,127
- Is it working?
- Yes.

720
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:43,526
Good.

721
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:44,723
Okay.

722
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,596
Well, you know what to do.
Good luck in there.

723
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,431
You too.

724
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,430
Free <i>rugelach?</i>

725
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:22,365
No, thank you.
I am here for something else.

726
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,002
Bread?

727
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:28,109
- Something hot.
- We have rolls that just came out.

728
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:30,905
Even hotter. Much, much hotter.

729
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:33,407
I already have boyfriend.

730
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:36,810
- All right...
- Although, I could make exception.

731
00:57:36,985 --> 00:57:38,009
No, that's okay.

732
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:41,384
Sure? Flour sacks in back,
very comfortable.

733
00:57:41,557 --> 00:57:45,049
I don't think we are on the same page.

734
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:49,353
I'm here because Ladislas Krstic sent me.

735
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:52,193
Ah. Take number.

736
00:57:53,502 --> 00:57:55,571
But I'm the only one here.

737
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:01,902
Oh.

738
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:32,804
Who are you?

739
00:58:32,975 --> 00:58:35,671
My name is Nudnik Shpilkes.
Who are you?

740
00:58:35,844 --> 00:58:38,438
- I am Siegfried.
- Did you say Siegfried?

741
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:40,771
Max!

742
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:42,040
Yes.

743
00:58:42,217 --> 00:58:44,117
I understand that you're
the man to see...

744
00:58:44,286 --> 00:58:47,346
...if someone is interested in acquiring
items of a nuclear nature.

745
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:51,084
- How do I know you're not CONTROL?
- lf I were CONTROL, you'd already be dead.

746
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,194
If you were CONTROL, you'd be dead.

747
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:57,321
Well, neither of us is dead,
so I'm obviously not from CONTROL.

748
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:02,990
That actually makes sense.

749
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:07,396
Follow me, Mr. Shpilkes.

750
00:59:13,612 --> 00:59:15,637
Test. Test.

751
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,648
Ah. The "Ode to Joy"
from Beethoven's Ninth.

752
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,813
Stone deaf when he wrote it.
Syphilis. Fun stuff.

753
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:30,986
Yes, a personal favorite.
A bit familiar, but it ends with a bang.

754
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,820
You're doing great, Max.

755
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:38,059
What I'm about to show you is
the inner sanctum of our entire operation.

756
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:40,761
The inner sanctum
of the entire operation?

757
00:59:44,643 --> 00:59:45,701
Yes.

758
00:59:54,586 --> 00:59:56,053
This is it?

759
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:57,654
Of course not. I lied.

760
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,120
He does that.

761
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:02,260
I'm going to kill you,
and then I'm going to kill your partner.

762
01:00:02,427 --> 01:00:04,190
I don't know who you're talking about.

763
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:12,996
Ah. Mrs. Shpilkes must be lost.

764
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:16,436
I think it's only fair to warn you,
this facility is surrounded...

765
01:00:16,608 --> 01:00:19,509
...by a highly trained team
of 130 Black Op snipers.

766
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:21,646
- I don't believe you.
- Would you believe...

767
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:23,804
...two dozen Delta Force commandos?

768
01:00:23,982 --> 01:00:26,507
- No.
- How about Chuck Norris with a BB gun?

769
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:28,518
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.

770
01:00:31,189 --> 01:00:34,886
Well, Mr. Shtarker,
I think you've underestimated me...

771
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,051
...and the element of surpr...!

772
01:00:47,138 --> 01:00:49,868
99, we've been compromised. Get out.

773
01:01:09,761 --> 01:01:11,456
<i>Access denied.</i>

774
01:01:41,293 --> 01:01:43,818
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

775
01:01:43,995 --> 01:01:46,463
<i>Access denied.</i>

776
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:00,535
Max, where are you?

777
01:02:00,712 --> 01:02:02,942
99, I found the yellowcake.

778
01:02:03,114 --> 01:02:04,775
Of course you did, it's a bakery.

779
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:07,612
No, not yellow "cake" cake,
yellowcake uranium.

780
01:02:07,786 --> 01:02:12,280
Although there is yellow "cake" cake
here as well.

781
01:02:13,124 --> 01:02:14,386
Oh, Max.

782
01:02:41,201 --> 01:02:42,828
Max, do you read...?

783
01:02:43,003 --> 01:02:44,265
99!

784
01:02:44,438 --> 01:02:46,269
What happened to your radio?

785
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,432
I swallowed it. I can get it back,
but you may not want it.

786
01:02:49,609 --> 01:02:51,433
- Good Lord.
- Listen...

787
01:02:51,611 --> 01:02:54,142
...l've placed charges
at points all over the building.

788
01:02:55,535 --> 01:02:59,232
What? Max, you can't blow up a building
full of radioactive material!

789
01:02:59,406 --> 01:03:03,308
I know that, 99. I've placed only enough
charges to safely bury the weapons lab.

790
01:03:04,344 --> 01:03:05,538
Max, that's brilliant.

791
01:03:05,712 --> 01:03:09,512
Wow. That's maybe the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

792
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:41,847
- I don't get it, I thought he was dead!
- I will say this, he is not a quitter.

793
01:03:58,331 --> 01:04:00,856
This is just ridiculous!

794
01:04:07,073 --> 01:04:08,097
99!

795
01:04:08,274 --> 01:04:09,400
Wake up, 99.

796
01:04:09,576 --> 01:04:11,737
Maybe you should kiss him again.

797
01:04:14,681 --> 01:04:17,980
Wait, I know that voice.
The chatter! Dalip.

798
01:04:25,759 --> 01:04:26,953
Ow! That was me!

799
01:04:30,864 --> 01:04:32,888
- Max?
- I'm... Yep, still fighting.

800
01:04:51,985 --> 01:04:56,445
Now, Dalip, I can prove that I know you.
Your favorite dish is chicken tikka!

801
01:04:57,223 --> 01:05:00,249
Like me, you enjoy
<i>American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.</i>

802
01:05:14,474 --> 01:05:16,204
Ow.

803
01:05:25,952 --> 01:05:29,115
Wait, wait, Dalip,
there's something else that I know.

804
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:30,449
Max. Max.

805
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:34,354
Your marriage is in trouble.
Your darling wife, Zeenat, is leaving you.

806
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:37,156
But there is still hope.

807
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:38,797
Do you love her?

808
01:05:44,037 --> 01:05:47,871
- Wha...?
- Then show her. Go home for lunch.

809
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:50,601
Take her with you the next time
you go to kill someone.

810
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,602
She just wants to be with you...

811
01:05:52,779 --> 01:05:55,043
...and that means
less time with her sister...

812
01:05:55,215 --> 01:05:57,911
...who we both know is undermining
your relationship.

813
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:01,185
Kick the gun to me.

814
01:06:01,354 --> 01:06:02,912
99, please.

815
01:06:03,656 --> 01:06:05,214
Big people feel pain too.

816
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:18,701
What are you doing?

817
01:06:19,506 --> 01:06:21,906
Oh, no. Oh, no.

818
01:06:22,075 --> 01:06:23,702
Max!

819
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,709
Okay. Okay. That's all right. That's okay.

820
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:35,982
Her sister's such a bitch.

821
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:45,828
- You all right?
- Yeah. That was amazing.

822
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:48,498
Thank you.

823
01:06:50,603 --> 01:06:52,127
We gotta go.

824
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,704
99.

825
01:07:08,555 --> 01:07:11,251
- What was that?
- I cramped up.

826
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,250
Come on. Come here.

827
01:07:15,628 --> 01:07:17,289
Good idea.

828
01:07:17,463 --> 01:07:21,194
We will climb up with you,
and we'll all go... together.

829
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:32,508
He left us here.

830
01:07:32,845 --> 01:07:34,472
What a douche.

831
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:55,099
Missed it by that much.

832
01:07:58,905 --> 01:08:01,840
Well, that's convenient. Shoot them.

833
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:12,648
Whatever you do, 99, don't look down!

834
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:16,448
I'm gonna try to get us over to that ledge!
We can do this, 99!

835
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:18,848
Max.

836
01:08:19,492 --> 01:08:20,516
Right.

837
01:08:25,365 --> 01:08:26,593
Thanks, Chief.

838
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,724
Okay, no problem.

839
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:31,734
The Chief is thrilled.
He sent 23 out to observe the cleanup.

840
01:08:31,904 --> 01:08:32,928
Great.

841
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:38,406
Listen, is it possible that you could
answer a personal question?

842
01:08:38,578 --> 01:08:40,409
It's possible.

843
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,340
Why did you change your looks?

844
01:08:44,484 --> 01:08:48,113
Oh. Um...
That's not really a personal question.

845
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:51,913
Things from my non-work sphere
spilled into my work sphere.

846
01:08:52,091 --> 01:08:56,027
Facts became known, identities were
compromised, and I became a brunette.

847
01:08:56,195 --> 01:08:59,255
Wow. That is a great story...

848
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:02,833
...in which you revealed
absolutely nothing about yourself.

849
01:09:08,274 --> 01:09:09,901
I blew a mission.

850
01:09:11,678 --> 01:09:16,342
I was involved with someone from work.
I lost focus. The mission blew up.

851
01:09:16,516 --> 01:09:20,976
I broke it off with that person,
but my identity had already been revealed.

852
01:09:21,154 --> 01:09:22,712
So I had two choices.

853
01:09:22,889 --> 01:09:25,585
I could either spend the rest of my life
behind a desk...

854
01:09:26,459 --> 01:09:28,427
...which would be like
eight hours a day...

855
01:09:28,594 --> 01:09:31,290
...of scraping a cheese grater
against my forehead.

856
01:09:31,464 --> 01:09:33,295
- Oh, you know.
- Yes.

857
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:36,094
Or I could change my face,
so that's what I did.

858
01:09:38,938 --> 01:09:43,602
And it was painful,
but it needed to be done, and s...

859
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:51,346
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
- Okay.

860
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:57,085
I used to look like my mom.

861
01:10:02,462 --> 01:10:05,454
I used to look like
two of my moms put together.

862
01:10:43,703 --> 01:10:46,536
Sir, if I may ask...

863
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:48,867
...how did you choose the target?

864
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:51,407
- Why Los Angeles?
- Major city...

865
01:10:51,577 --> 01:10:53,442
...lots of media attention...

866
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:55,507
...and the president will be there.

867
01:10:56,015 --> 01:10:59,280
Still, it's too bad
about all the dead movie stars.

868
01:10:59,452 --> 01:11:00,749
Yes.

869
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:05,289
What will we do without
their razor-sharp political advice?

870
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:12,890
Oh, my God, have you eaten the crew?

871
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:15,959
Oh, look, it understands.

872
01:11:16,135 --> 01:11:17,796
Get back to work.

873
01:11:34,053 --> 01:11:38,217
No, that's not possible.
No, no, no. Max said that...

874
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:41,820
No.

875
01:11:45,565 --> 01:11:47,499
That doesn't make any sense.

876
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:52,203
Yellowcake uranium, warheads,
an entire production line.

877
01:11:52,371 --> 01:11:55,340
There's nothing here
but what used to be a bakery.

878
01:11:55,508 --> 01:11:58,068
There are no weapons?
No radioactivity of any kind?

879
01:11:58,244 --> 01:12:01,008
Nothing. I've swept the entire area,
and it's clean.

880
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,377
- But Max said that he s...
- Did you see the evidence yourself?

881
01:12:04,884 --> 01:12:06,215
No.

882
01:12:06,619 --> 01:12:09,417
No, every time he found something,
he was alone.

883
01:12:15,628 --> 01:12:17,425
What do you want me to do with Max?

884
01:12:17,597 --> 01:12:19,087
- Do with Max?
- Max?

885
01:12:21,701 --> 01:12:24,192
You were right when you said
I shouldn't trust you.

886
01:12:26,038 --> 01:12:27,232
Give me the phone.

887
01:12:31,544 --> 01:12:34,012
And who might this be? Siegfried?

888
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,340
<i>Hello, Max.</i>

889
01:12:35,514 --> 01:12:36,538
Chief?

890
01:12:38,985 --> 01:12:40,748
Knockout gas, 99?

891
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,287
Please. I have trained my body
to be impervious to...

892
01:12:44,457 --> 01:12:45,788
That's new stuff.

893
01:12:48,728 --> 01:12:50,252
Oh, Max.

894
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,695
I'm very disappointed, Max.

895
01:12:59,872 --> 01:13:02,773
I thought you and I were supposedly
cut from the same cloth.

896
01:13:02,942 --> 01:13:05,137
How can you think
that I am a double agent?

897
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:07,779
You lied about finding evidence
of radioactivity.

898
01:13:07,947 --> 01:13:10,245
Killed Krstic before
anybody could question him.

899
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:13,613
There's a matter of your
stoving my head in with a fire extinguisher.

900
01:13:13,786 --> 01:13:18,087
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me,
because you were in a mini coma.

901
01:13:18,257 --> 01:13:19,952
You've made CONTROL a laughingstock.

902
01:13:20,126 --> 01:13:22,924
The vice president wants to shut us down,
you know.

903
01:13:25,698 --> 01:13:26,722
99.

904
01:13:27,433 --> 01:13:29,025
This whole week...

905
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:30,931
...last night...

906
01:13:31,871 --> 01:13:33,065
...you know me.

907
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:34,672
Apparently not.

908
01:13:35,474 --> 01:13:36,668
Oh, my God!

909
01:13:36,842 --> 01:13:38,935
You two? You and Max?

910
01:13:39,111 --> 01:13:41,807
You said we had to break up
because we work together.

911
01:13:41,981 --> 01:13:43,175
Oh, my God! You and 23?

912
01:13:43,783 --> 01:13:46,251
I am so sexually threatened right now.

913
01:13:51,724 --> 01:13:53,214
<i>You have reached...</i>

914
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:55,257
<i>... the United States</i>
<i>Department of Homeland Security.</i>

915
01:13:55,428 --> 01:13:57,896
<i>For threats against</i>
<i>the continental United States, press 1.</i>

916
01:13:58,064 --> 01:14:00,828
<i>For threats against Hawaii, press 2.</i>
<i>For threats against Puerto Rico...</i>

917
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:05,937
You know, you're the only human being
I know who snores when he's awake?

918
01:14:06,105 --> 01:14:07,732
<i>If you're calling from a rotary...</i>

919
01:14:07,907 --> 01:14:10,501
Okay, today's threat assessment.

920
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:15,170
- There are 72 threats on the list. Mike?
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

921
01:14:15,348 --> 01:14:18,613
Okay, we have a deteriorating situation
in Venezuela.

922
01:14:18,784 --> 01:14:21,344
We have a deteriorating situation
in Afghanistan.

923
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,216
What about the deteriorating situation
in North Korea?

924
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,255
- I was getting to that.
- When? Next week?

925
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:28,757
Yes, next Tuesday,
right after I kick your ass.

926
01:14:28,928 --> 01:14:33,160
Gentlemen, when we argue,
the terrorists win.

927
01:14:36,635 --> 01:14:39,399
Anyway, last night at a private dinner...

928
01:14:39,572 --> 01:14:43,269
...President Kim Jong-il
made a very odd threat to, and I quote:

929
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:46,036
"Make a pudding from the bones
of Americans."

930
01:14:46,212 --> 01:14:48,043
That guy's insane.

931
01:14:48,214 --> 01:14:52,241
Doesn't he know bones are crunchy?
Who'd want a crunchy pudding?

932
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:55,310
War room.

933
01:14:55,488 --> 01:14:59,481
Finally. My name is Siegfried,
and I represent KAOS.

934
01:14:59,658 --> 01:15:03,856
<i>Over the past few months, we have</i>
<i>assembled a stockpile of nuclear weapons...</i>

935
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:08,933
<i>... which we have distributed</i>
<i>to 20 unfriendly, unstable dictators.</i>

936
01:15:09,702 --> 01:15:12,967
For the moment, KAOS retains
the bomb activation codes...

937
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:17,041
...but we will release the codes
unless our demands are met.

938
01:15:17,209 --> 01:15:18,267
What are your demands?

939
01:15:18,444 --> 01:15:20,503
200 billion dollars by 3 p.m.

940
01:15:20,679 --> 01:15:23,204
200 billion dollars by 3 p. m?

941
01:15:23,382 --> 01:15:24,781
<i>You seem a bit slow.</i>

942
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:28,147
- Is there someone else I can talk to?
- Good one.

943
01:15:28,721 --> 01:15:31,451
Look, Siegfried,
we don't negotiate with terrorists...

944
01:15:31,624 --> 01:15:33,956
...and you're obviously bluffing.
Take a hike.

945
01:15:34,126 --> 01:15:35,753
What? Are you kidding me?

946
01:15:35,928 --> 01:15:39,557
You spent the morning talking about
pudding, and you ignore a credible threat?

947
01:15:39,732 --> 01:15:42,200
Credible? Come on.
KAOS has been defunct for 20 years.

948
01:15:42,368 --> 01:15:44,893
With all due respect,
the CIA knows nothing about KAOS.

949
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:47,505
CONTROL has to be in charge here.

950
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:50,665
- Like when you bombed that bakery?
- Muffins of mass destruction.

951
01:15:52,545 --> 01:15:54,706
That's it!
I've been waiting for this since Nixon.

952
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,111
- Here we go.
- I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!

953
01:15:58,284 --> 01:16:00,343
- Okay!
- Okay! Come on!

954
01:16:03,656 --> 01:16:06,250
It seems like they don't believe you.

955
01:16:06,826 --> 01:16:11,160
Which is why we've arranged
for a little demonstration.

956
01:16:59,145 --> 01:17:00,942
Chief, you wanted to see me?

957
01:17:01,113 --> 01:17:04,514
Yes. You and 23 are coming with me
to see the president.

958
01:17:04,683 --> 01:17:07,413
- Can't you call him?
- Vice president won't let me through.

959
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:10,653
I can't believe we have to go
all the way to Los Angeles.

960
01:17:10,823 --> 01:17:12,654
Why is the president never here?

961
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:15,385
I'm sure whatever he's doing
is vital to the nation.

962
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,626
"Good night, moon.

963
01:17:18,397 --> 01:17:21,332
Good night,
cow jumping over the moon."

964
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:25,633
Actually, I think you would suck
as my teacher.

965
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:28,295
Well, from wh...

966
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:31,971
Hey, Smart. Happy birthday.

967
01:17:39,218 --> 01:17:40,981
I'm fat!

968
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,363
Gentlemen.

969
01:17:54,633 --> 01:17:57,431
Oh. Good, the itchy kind.

970
01:17:57,603 --> 01:17:58,695
My favorite.

971
01:17:58,871 --> 01:18:00,668
Does this one also have smallpox?

972
01:18:03,842 --> 01:18:05,969
And that was a human tooth.

973
01:18:06,145 --> 01:18:09,842
<i>American Top 40.</i>
<i>- With Ryan Seacrest.</i>

974
01:18:10,015 --> 01:18:12,848
<i>Here's a sweet dedication</i>
<i>from a little lady named Dalip.</i>

975
01:18:13,018 --> 01:18:14,485
<i>It's to her boyfriend, Max.</i>

976
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:19,181
<i>"Meet me in L.A.</i>
<i>Things will be very hot. Nuclear hot. "

977
01:18:19,358 --> 01:18:22,725
<i>I don't know, if I were Max,</i>
<i>I would get myself to L.A.</i>

978
01:18:32,538 --> 01:18:34,904
Hey! Dumb guards!

979
01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:39,306
Why don't you come in here so I can
make you my pretty little girlfriends.

980
01:18:39,478 --> 01:18:40,945
You'll have to shower for weeks!

981
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:44,945
But you will never get the smell off...

982
01:18:45,117 --> 01:18:47,347
You two seem very angry.

983
01:18:49,088 --> 01:18:51,215
Thank you, sir, may I have another?

984
01:18:53,525 --> 01:18:55,116
I was kidding.

985
01:19:03,235 --> 01:19:06,830
9-4-3-6-8.

986
01:19:10,442 --> 01:19:13,377
9-4-3-6-8.

987
01:19:30,429 --> 01:19:32,192
Turn around slowly.

988
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,699
Guys, you have to believe me.
I am not a double agent.

989
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:40,361
- We never thought you were.
- Yeah, we love you, man.

990
01:19:40,539 --> 01:19:43,303
Then what's with the firearm
and the freak-show expressions?

991
01:19:43,475 --> 01:19:44,874
For the security cameras.

992
01:19:45,044 --> 01:19:48,309
If it looks like we let you go,
we'd totally get fired.

993
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,538
Got it.

994
01:19:52,184 --> 01:19:53,651
So where are the Chief and 99?

995
01:19:53,819 --> 01:19:55,787
They flew to L.A.
to talk to the president.

996
01:19:55,954 --> 01:19:58,354
I need to get out of here
before someone stops me.

997
01:19:58,524 --> 01:20:00,116
- Overpower us.
- Good idea.

998
01:20:00,292 --> 01:20:01,953
Bruce, I will smash you in the face.

999
01:20:02,127 --> 01:20:04,721
- Thank you.
- Lloyd, I'll simulate your disembowelment.

1000
01:20:04,897 --> 01:20:06,421
Ready? One...

1001
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:08,998
Not yet! I haven't punched yet.
React when I punch.

1002
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:10,533
- Oh, yeah.
- One...

1003
01:20:10,703 --> 01:20:12,466
...two, three.

1004
01:20:13,906 --> 01:20:15,533
- Wrong way.
- Okay, wait.

1005
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:18,176
- Sometimes I faint.
- I'm not going to hit you.

1006
01:20:18,344 --> 01:20:21,939
No, but when I see blood, or when
I talk about blood, or think about blood...

1007
01:20:22,114 --> 01:20:24,776
There will be no blood.
Hang in there. Hang in, buddy.

1008
01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:13,758
What are you doing, dummkopf?

1009
01:21:13,932 --> 01:21:17,698
Running out in the middle of the road!
You could get hit by a car!

1010
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:20,695
Well, that was ironic.

1011
01:21:34,987 --> 01:21:36,477
Chief, I'm not buying it.

1012
01:21:36,655 --> 01:21:39,647
With all our satellites,
there's no way anybody could possibly...

1013
01:21:39,825 --> 01:21:42,089
...have nuclear bombs
that we wouldn't know about.

1014
01:21:42,261 --> 01:21:43,660
"Nuclear!"

1015
01:21:44,062 --> 01:21:45,620
- What's that?
- Sorry.

1016
01:21:45,798 --> 01:21:49,131
Mr. President, if I could just
please show you some data, you'd agree...

1017
01:21:49,301 --> 01:21:50,825
Well, just back up here a second.

1018
01:21:51,003 --> 01:21:52,994
First thing I'd like to know is...

1019
01:21:53,172 --> 01:21:55,333
...what did the vice president
say about this?

1020
01:21:55,507 --> 01:21:59,238
I'm afraid the vice president and I had
a less-than-cordial encounter yesterday.

1021
01:21:59,411 --> 01:22:01,174
- Less-than-cordial, you say?
- Yes, sir.

1022
01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:02,370
I'll say.

1023
01:22:03,749 --> 01:22:06,445
The chairman of joint chiefs
sent me this little movie.

1024
01:22:06,618 --> 01:22:08,279
Put it right here on my cell phone.

1025
01:22:08,454 --> 01:22:10,445
Let me share this with you.
This is my favorite part.

1026
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:13,113
<i>I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!</i>

1027
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:16,187
Oh, Chief.

1028
01:22:16,361 --> 01:22:17,521
Very sweet tackle.

1029
01:22:17,696 --> 01:22:20,187
Look. Look at the surprise on his face.

1030
01:22:20,365 --> 01:22:22,697
I probably owe you an apology
for that, sir.

1031
01:22:22,868 --> 01:22:24,460
No. Please, just save your breath.

1032
01:22:24,636 --> 01:22:26,900
But I have to agree
with that son of a bitch.

1033
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:29,404
We cannot respond to every threat.

1034
01:22:30,776 --> 01:22:32,209
Case closed.

1035
01:22:55,801 --> 01:22:56,825
Max?

1036
01:22:57,002 --> 01:22:58,128
<i>Hello, 99.</i>

1037
01:22:58,303 --> 01:23:00,134
Trace 99's call, now!

1038
01:23:00,305 --> 01:23:02,170
- Where are you?
- <i>That's not important.</i>

1039
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:06,243
<i>What is important is that KAOS has planted</i>
<i>a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles.</i>

1040
01:23:06,411 --> 01:23:08,379
We got him. He's still in Washington.

1041
01:23:08,547 --> 01:23:11,812
<i>Listen, while I was in my cell,</i>
<i>I had some time to think.</i>

1042
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:19,015
<i>I realized that even though I was accused</i>
<i>of something I didn't do, I was happy.</i>

1043
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:24,327
<i>Because at least for a little while,</i>
<i>I got to live my dream of being an agent.</i>

1044
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:27,093
<i>And I got to be with you.</i>

1045
01:23:27,266 --> 01:23:30,099
<i>I learned that you have</i>
<i>a mean right cross...</i>

1046
01:23:30,269 --> 01:23:33,466
<i>... you are almost as good</i>
<i>a dancer as me...</i>

1047
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:36,870
- <i>... and you used to look like your mom.</i>
- Max.

1048
01:23:37,042 --> 01:23:40,375
<i>Please, 99. All I'm asking is for you</i>
<i>to look me in the eyes...</i>

1049
01:23:40,546 --> 01:23:43,140
<i>... and tell me that</i>
<i>you don't feel something too.</i>

1050
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:45,076
Freeze!

1051
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:49,016
Oh, Max. How could I look in your eyes?

1052
01:23:50,389 --> 01:23:51,651
Just turn around.

1053
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:01,055
Why are you talking into your shoe?

1054
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:04,634
The old "call forwarding
from the shoe phone to the cell phone...

1055
01:24:04,803 --> 01:24:08,136
...so you don't know where I am,
then I appear on the roof behind you...

1056
01:24:08,307 --> 01:24:10,298
...and surprise everyone" trick.

1057
01:24:10,475 --> 01:24:12,340
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

1058
01:24:12,511 --> 01:24:13,535
How did you get here?

1059
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:18,808
Do you have another one of these?

1060
01:24:22,621 --> 01:24:23,645
It doesn't matter.

1061
01:24:23,822 --> 01:24:26,791
What matters is that there is a bomb,
and I'm here to find it.

1062
01:24:26,959 --> 01:24:29,120
- How do you know this?
- I'd rather not say.

1063
01:24:29,294 --> 01:24:31,285
Max, there are millions of lives at stake.

1064
01:24:31,463 --> 01:24:34,660
If you have credible information
from a reliable source...

1065
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:37,028
...I wanna know it,
and I wanna know it now.

1066
01:24:38,103 --> 01:24:40,970
I heard it from America's sweetheart,
Ryan Seacrest.

1067
01:24:41,139 --> 01:24:42,470
- Whoa.
- Come on.

1068
01:24:42,641 --> 01:24:44,233
It was a coded message.

1069
01:24:44,409 --> 01:24:47,776
Max, we're running out of time here.
What are you talking about?

1070
01:24:47,946 --> 01:24:51,780
I received a tip from a KAOS agent
who I befriended at the bakery.

1071
01:24:57,289 --> 01:24:59,052
I think we should trust him, Chief.

1072
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:01,192
Absolutely, Chief.
I'm with 99 on that one.

1073
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,158
Every time I look at Max's puppy eyes,
I'm a goner.

1074
01:25:04,329 --> 01:25:08,129
Oh, my God. You've really never
had anyone break up with you, have you?

1075
01:25:09,701 --> 01:25:12,602
Chief, you said that you and I are alike.

1076
01:25:12,771 --> 01:25:15,137
That we are both old-fashioned men.

1077
01:25:15,807 --> 01:25:17,934
Well, I have an old-fashioned hunch.

1078
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:22,672
I have a hunch that you have a hunch
that I am telling the truth.

1079
01:25:23,782 --> 01:25:24,874
Max...

1080
01:25:26,318 --> 01:25:29,549
Any double agent who escapes
from a high-security holding situation...

1081
01:25:29,721 --> 01:25:33,316
...only to fall into the arms of
the people that got him in the first place...

1082
01:25:33,492 --> 01:25:37,292
...is either an idiot or not a double agent,
and I don't think you're an idiot.

1083
01:25:38,063 --> 01:25:39,087
Thank you, Chief.

1084
01:25:39,731 --> 01:25:43,064
Now, we know that the president
is in town.

1085
01:25:43,235 --> 01:25:47,035
- But what exactly is he doing here today?
- Max.

1086
01:25:47,205 --> 01:25:51,505
- Yes. We need to find out his itinerary.
- But, Max, the...

1087
01:25:51,677 --> 01:25:54,407
I know, 99. I need to go get a paper.

1088
01:26:03,789 --> 01:26:05,313
We're in position. More or less.

1089
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:08,425
Roger. I have the whole
security system online. Just remember...

1090
01:26:08,593 --> 01:26:12,359
Yes, we know.
How about a little radio silence?

1091
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:16,530
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

1092
01:26:16,702 --> 01:26:21,162
By the way, I reviewed the security tapes
from the explosion at the bakery...

1093
01:26:21,339 --> 01:26:25,366
...and I know that you let those
CONTROL agents get away.

1094
01:26:25,544 --> 01:26:27,808
So unless you do your job today...

1095
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:34,111
...your lovely wife, Zeenat,
will have eaten her last kebab.

1096
01:26:55,807 --> 01:26:59,709
<i>Blue team, check for access violation</i>
<i>at quadrant three, sector seven.</i>

1097
01:26:59,878 --> 01:27:00,902
Copy that.

1098
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,440
Go.

1099
01:27:20,932 --> 01:27:22,627
That's it. You're there.

1100
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:56,128
Door secure.

1101
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:30,931
We need to get everyone out
and shut this place.

1102
01:28:31,102 --> 01:28:32,569
We've swept the building.

1103
01:28:32,737 --> 01:28:36,503
The Secret Service doesn't make mistakes
like the fabulous bakery boys.

1104
01:28:36,675 --> 01:28:38,609
Who told you about that? Who told you?

1105
01:28:38,777 --> 01:28:41,041
Take it easy.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

1106
01:28:41,213 --> 01:28:43,841
And this day will not include
me blowing into your mouth.

1107
01:28:44,015 --> 01:28:47,007
- You want a piece of me?
- Come on, Chief! he's not worth it.

1108
01:28:47,185 --> 01:28:48,812
- Hey.
- I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

1109
01:28:48,987 --> 01:28:50,011
You better watch it.

1110
01:28:50,188 --> 01:28:51,678
Let me at him!

1111
01:29:01,099 --> 01:29:02,999
<i>From Los Angeles, California...</i>

1112
01:29:03,168 --> 01:29:05,025
<i>... we welcome you to a live broadcast...</i>

1113
01:29:05,203 --> 01:29:07,194
<i>... of our concert for the president.</i>

1114
01:29:07,372 --> 01:29:09,840
<i>Dignitaries from around the world</i>
<i>have gathered.</i>

1115
01:29:10,008 --> 01:29:14,445
<i>We will be broadcasting from the Walt</i>
<i>Disney Concert Hall throughout the evening.</i>

1116
01:29:14,613 --> 01:29:17,047
There has got to be another way in.

1117
01:29:17,215 --> 01:29:20,116
Why are we even still here?
There are 50 other perfect targets.

1118
01:29:20,285 --> 01:29:23,686
The Golden Gate Bridge, Space Needle.
There's no chatter to support this.

1119
01:29:23,855 --> 01:29:26,653
And you know what,
I'm done with this. Stop!

1120
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:30,283
Wait a minute, 23.
You're radioactive hot.

1121
01:29:30,462 --> 01:29:32,521
When were you exposed to radioactivity?

1122
01:29:32,697 --> 01:29:35,996
I just got back from Russia.
Half the people there are radioactive.

1123
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,191
The bakery.

1124
01:29:37,369 --> 01:29:39,997
You said you swept the area
and everything was clean.

1125
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:42,571
- I did, and it was.
- Really?

1126
01:29:42,741 --> 01:29:45,335
Was there anyone else there,
or do we just trust you?

1127
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:46,834
23.

1128
01:29:48,013 --> 01:29:49,708
Your knife wound is seeping.

1129
01:29:50,315 --> 01:29:52,146
Sudden rise in blood pressure?

1130
01:29:52,317 --> 01:29:55,650
Perhaps you're nervous because
there is a bomb here and you know it.

1131
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:59,278
And what is with the briefcase?
Could that actually be the football?

1132
01:29:59,457 --> 01:30:02,449
You mean the computer
containing the bomb activation codes?

1133
01:30:02,627 --> 01:30:06,495
Exactly. I have no interest in a real football
unless it is signed by Joe Montana...

1134
01:30:06,665 --> 01:30:08,860
...and I don't believe that's the case.

1135
01:30:10,602 --> 01:30:12,365
Well, 23?

1136
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:15,196
You know what? We're out of time.

1137
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,767
You follow us, she dies.

1138
01:30:28,586 --> 01:30:30,281
Stop this car!

1139
01:30:30,689 --> 01:30:34,090
Max! You idiot!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1140
01:30:34,259 --> 01:30:37,592
You don't just slap your hands
on a government vehicle!

1141
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:43,499
All right, that's it! When we get back
to Washington, you morons are through!

1142
01:30:46,638 --> 01:30:50,096
Damn it. How have you gotten
away with this for so long?

1143
01:30:50,275 --> 01:30:52,641
I can't believe none of us saw it,
especially me.

1144
01:30:52,811 --> 01:30:55,211
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll be dead soon anyway.

1145
01:30:57,749 --> 01:30:59,808
Chief, he's heading
southbound on Grand.

1146
01:30:59,985 --> 01:31:01,577
Thanks, Bruce. Keep us posted.

1147
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:05,849
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>CONTROL assholes who just stole my vehicle!</i>

1148
01:31:06,024 --> 01:31:10,461
<i>I know you're listening! You two dickwads</i>
<i>put one scratch on that car...</i>

1149
01:31:11,663 --> 01:31:13,028
<i>What was that?</i>

1150
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:14,961
Sorry, I'm losing you.

1151
01:31:15,734 --> 01:31:16,758
What the?

1152
01:31:18,236 --> 01:31:20,727
All right, fellas.
20 dollars if you hit the car.

1153
01:31:22,741 --> 01:31:26,575
Chief, I have to say,
this whole thing really steams my clams.

1154
01:31:26,745 --> 01:31:29,441
I cannot get over the fact
that 23 is a traitor.

1155
01:31:29,614 --> 01:31:31,013
Sand trap!

1156
01:31:31,182 --> 01:31:34,015
Now I know how you felt
when you thought I was a traitor.

1157
01:31:34,185 --> 01:31:35,447
Tractor!

1158
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:38,487
I don't know how I missed it.
I'm usually very observant.

1159
01:31:38,656 --> 01:31:39,987
Swordfish!

1160
01:31:47,165 --> 01:31:49,565
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I don't know.

1161
01:31:49,734 --> 01:31:53,602
Were you thinking, "Holy shit, holy shit,
a swordfish almost went through my head?"

1162
01:31:53,772 --> 01:31:55,296
If so, yes.

1163
01:31:55,473 --> 01:31:56,770
Come on.

1164
01:32:19,297 --> 01:32:22,858
On behalf of the United States Government,
I hereby commandeer this plane.

1165
01:32:23,768 --> 01:32:25,668
The device is armed.
I hope you're moving.

1166
01:32:25,837 --> 01:32:28,806
Don't worry, sir. I'll be well clear.

1167
01:32:33,278 --> 01:32:35,212
<i>Chief, they're headed</i>
<i>southbound on l-47.</i>

1168
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:37,211
Thanks, Bruce. I got them!

1169
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:39,812
I need to get down to that car!

1170
01:32:39,984 --> 01:32:43,476
No, no good. If I get too low,
he'll hear me coming!

1171
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:49,260
I have another idea.

1172
01:32:50,095 --> 01:32:51,756
What are you doing?

1173
01:32:54,265 --> 01:32:56,961
Get back in the plane!
You're gonna kill yourself!

1174
01:32:58,269 --> 01:32:59,566
Hang on!

1175
01:33:16,087 --> 01:33:17,679
Hang on! We're going in!

1176
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,586
Sorry, Max.

1177
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,862
Tuesday's not gonna work.
Cannot do Tuesday, I'm already...

1178
01:33:32,036 --> 01:33:34,004
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Sean! Sean! Sean!

1179
01:33:34,172 --> 01:33:36,197
See how annoying that is?

1180
01:33:56,528 --> 01:34:00,419
See, this is your problem.
Some men like women more feminine!

1181
01:34:00,598 --> 01:34:02,065
- I'm not feminine?
- No.

1182
01:34:02,233 --> 01:34:03,359
I'm not feminine?

1183
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:15,837
Freeze!

1184
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:17,809
That was so cool.

1185
01:34:18,716 --> 01:34:20,047
Max!

1186
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,584
Damn it to hell.

1187
01:34:39,404 --> 01:34:41,531
You know, I might be more help
if you untie me!

1188
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:44,172
There's a knife in my right front pocket!

1189
01:34:50,648 --> 01:34:51,876
Stop it! Stop it!

1190
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:53,374
What?

1191
01:34:54,619 --> 01:34:57,213
That's not my knife! That's not my...

1192
01:34:57,755 --> 01:34:59,052
I got it!

1193
01:35:05,763 --> 01:35:07,424
No, 99, don't touch that!

1194
01:35:10,768 --> 01:35:12,258
Oh, my Lord.

1195
01:35:33,958 --> 01:35:36,051
Yeah! The kid's still got it.

1196
01:35:41,866 --> 01:35:42,890
Max, hurry!

1197
01:35:44,969 --> 01:35:46,732
Hold on, 99!

1198
01:35:52,777 --> 01:35:56,645
Chief, we can't stop the car! We have
the football, but we do not know the code!

1199
01:35:56,814 --> 01:35:58,281
We need to figure out something!

1200
01:35:58,449 --> 01:36:01,282
These tracks are taking us back downtown,
towards the bomb!

1201
01:36:05,723 --> 01:36:08,590
We gotta get you out of there,
and you won't survive the jump!

1202
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:09,784
I'm coming to get you!

1203
01:36:34,819 --> 01:36:36,878
- Oh, God!
- Hold on, 99!

1204
01:36:38,356 --> 01:36:41,154
It's not over, Max!
I'll take that briefcase!

1205
01:36:41,326 --> 01:36:43,385
If you want it, you'll have to take it!

1206
01:36:43,828 --> 01:36:47,355
- That's what I just said!
- I know, I'm just trying to annoy you!

1207
01:37:36,114 --> 01:37:38,014
Unusual but effective.

1208
01:37:45,790 --> 01:37:47,690
- You all right?
- I'm fine!

1209
01:37:53,998 --> 01:37:55,431
Max!

1210
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:57,191
Max, your foot!

1211
01:38:03,141 --> 01:38:06,110
- I wish we had more time!
- What?

1212
01:38:26,464 --> 01:38:29,627
- Max!
- No!

1213
01:38:50,488 --> 01:38:51,955
Oh, Max.

1214
01:38:58,029 --> 01:38:59,519
No. No!

1215
01:39:05,169 --> 01:39:07,637
I wish we had more time too.

1216
01:39:10,341 --> 01:39:12,138
So you did hear me?

1217
01:39:14,946 --> 01:39:15,970
Max?

1218
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:21,982
But the train...

1219
01:39:22,987 --> 01:39:25,182
Missed it by that much.

1220
01:39:44,509 --> 01:39:46,409
"Operation Joy"?

1221
01:39:47,912 --> 01:39:51,746
The "Ode to Joy" will end with a bang.

1222
01:39:56,821 --> 01:39:59,984
- Chief!
- Yeah, Maxie! Are you okay?

1223
01:40:00,157 --> 01:40:04,218
Listen, I think the final notes
of the "Ode to Joy" trigger the bomb!

1224
01:40:04,395 --> 01:40:06,192
We have to stop the concert!

1225
01:40:06,364 --> 01:40:07,661
I'm on it.

1226
01:40:44,168 --> 01:40:47,729
My buttocks are really stinging
from being dragged.

1227
01:40:56,981 --> 01:40:59,415
Hey, grandpa, I already told you...

1228
01:41:00,151 --> 01:41:03,348
Speak up, son.
I'm an old man, you know.

1229
01:41:14,599 --> 01:41:16,863
I like that tackling part.

1230
01:41:21,172 --> 01:41:23,936
I am so, so sorry about that.

1231
01:41:24,108 --> 01:41:25,905
Wait! No, no, let him go.

1232
01:41:26,877 --> 01:41:28,970
- There is a bomb.
- Where?

1233
01:41:29,146 --> 01:41:32,138
Would you believe in the piano?

1234
01:41:37,455 --> 01:41:39,821
Whoa. How did we miss that?
That is huge.

1235
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:44,785
- Max. Was that...?
- A total guess, yes, it was.

1236
01:41:53,571 --> 01:41:56,062
That old son of a gun
can take a hit, huh?

1237
01:42:03,414 --> 01:42:07,817
- Do you think I should tell him?
- No. Let's just savor the moment.

1238
01:42:16,494 --> 01:42:18,826
He's a funny son of a bitch, isn't he?

1239
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:21,998
This is the proudest moment of my life!

1240
01:42:24,935 --> 01:42:26,493
Bomb not go off.

1241
01:42:26,671 --> 01:42:29,231
Oh, really, bright-eyes?
What alerted you?

1242
01:42:29,407 --> 01:42:32,535
Was it no "Boom, boom," or the lack
of a mushroom cloud?

1243
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:35,406
It was the mushroom cloud for me.

1244
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:41,249
Well, you did your job,
so I suppose I can't kill your wife.

1245
01:42:41,652 --> 01:42:45,247
Although to be honest,
I'd be doing the sighted world a favor.

1246
01:42:53,698 --> 01:42:55,996
What good hang time, huh?

1247
01:42:56,734 --> 01:42:59,965
Yes, Mr. President.
Thank you and goodbye, sir.

1248
01:43:00,171 --> 01:43:03,698
86, the President wanted me
to convey his personal thanks...

1249
01:43:03,874 --> 01:43:07,605
...and to tell you how impressed he was
with that dragged-by-a-train thing.

1250
01:43:07,778 --> 01:43:11,874
Well, sir, as an agent, I have trained
myself to be impervious to pain.

1251
01:43:13,284 --> 01:43:15,514
Ah! Hey, it's Fang.

1252
01:43:15,686 --> 01:43:18,348
I wanted him to be a surprise.

1253
01:43:18,522 --> 01:43:21,650
99, please, nobody here
knows that we're dating.

1254
01:43:21,826 --> 01:43:23,384
Yes, they do.

1255
01:43:24,662 --> 01:43:25,959
On the cheek.

1256
01:43:27,064 --> 01:43:28,793
- Let's go.
- Maybe a little one?

1257
01:43:29,767 --> 01:43:33,669
Hey, new guy. Hold up a second.
Welcome to CONTROL.

1258
01:43:33,838 --> 01:43:37,069
We have a tradition called "pick on
the new guy." Here's how it works.

1259
01:43:37,241 --> 01:43:40,233
- We pick on the new guy.
- And you can't do anything about it.

1260
01:43:40,411 --> 01:43:41,776
Let's try one.

1261
01:43:42,613 --> 01:43:45,605
- You dropped your pencil.
- Did you hear the man?

1262
01:43:46,016 --> 01:43:49,281
I don't see a man, I see two little girls.

1263
01:43:49,453 --> 01:43:53,480
I think I'll call you Maureen,
and you Brittany.

1264
01:43:53,657 --> 01:43:56,990
- New guy did not.
- New guy did.

1265
01:43:57,161 --> 01:43:59,152
Okay, new guy...
- I got this.

1266
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:01,120
And I'm going to enjoy it.

1267
01:44:01,298 --> 01:44:03,289
That will make me happy, Maureen.

1268
01:44:03,701 --> 01:44:04,725
Maureen.

1269
01:44:06,203 --> 01:44:07,465
Ow! What's in there?

1270
01:44:08,038 --> 01:44:09,869
- And just for the record.
- What's in there?

1271
01:44:11,442 --> 01:44:12,932
My name is not "new guy."

1272
01:44:14,178 --> 01:44:15,543
My name is Hymie.

1273
01:44:15,713 --> 01:44:18,113
Now, if you ladies will excuse me.

1274
01:44:20,518 --> 01:44:22,281
This is gonna be so fun.

1275
01:44:22,453 --> 01:44:24,045
Make him high-five me.

1276
01:44:58,422 --> 01:44:59,650
Max, we're gonna be late.

1277
01:45:03,661 --> 01:45:06,323
Oh, Max. Let Maintenance
take care of it.

1278
01:45:10,467 --> 01:45:11,559
Ah!

1279
01:45:11,735 --> 01:45:14,907
<i>You've gotta
be kidding me!</i>

1280
