00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,270
Are you one of the patrol?

3
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,670
Yes

4
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,036
Good.

5
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,310
One of Ritai ' s men?

6
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,310
Yeah.

7
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,393
Fine, then cut him loose.

8
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,392
What are you looking at!
Don' t stop.

9
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,395
Hold the leg up.

10
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,269
Turn the head a bit.

11
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,155
Give me the knife.

12
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,595
Kekexi I i,

13
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,951
the last virgin
wi lderness of China.

14
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,518
This plain nearly
four mi les high,

15
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,476
is the only remaining habitat
of the Tibetan antelope.

16
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,115
In 1985

17
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,191
Poachers began hunting
antelopes for their fine wool

18
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,518
which was prized in
foreign markets.

19
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,069
Within a few years,

20
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,513
the number of antelopes plunged
from one mi I l ion to
under ten thousand.

21
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,074
To fight the poachers, a volunteer
civi I ian patrol was formed in 1993.

22
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,994
It was led by Ritai
a retired Tibetan army officer.

23
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,191
The patrol fought fierce
battles with the poachers

24
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,558
and aroused the attention
of the outside wor ld.

25
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,149
In the winter of 1996,

26
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,432
Poachers murdered
one of the patrolmen.

27
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,191
My newspaper quickly
sent me to cover the story.

28
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,272

Wait a second!

42
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,556
You want this place to be
declared as a nature preserve area

43
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,634
Maybe I can help.

44
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,912

64
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,431

Maybe.

91
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,676
We' re close to the
antelope breeding grounds.

92
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,116
They often pass by this road.

93
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,236

We don' t have the power
to arrest anybody,

110
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,151

Three years...

138
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,469
We are short of hands.

139
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,914

Hualong.

190
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,590
How old are you?

191
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,833
Have you ever
ki I led any antelopes?

192
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,799
Please help me!

193
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,759
(Tibetan prayer)

194
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,309
Take them across the r iver.

195
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,154
Hurry! Kneel down!

196
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,358
Ma Zhanl in, do you have
anything to say this time?

197
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,559
Let me have another coat...

198
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,399
I ' m freezing cold.

199
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,390
Where' s your boss?

200
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,512
We just skin them.

201
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,476
Don' t I ie!

202
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,069
That' s al I l do...

203
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,991
Tel I us the truth.

204
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,516
I don' t know anything...

205
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,116
re you the gunman?

206
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,117
No!

207
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,752
You' re the gunman!

208
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,512
No, I ' m not.

209
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,198
Then what do you do?

210
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,071
I ' m a dr iver.

211
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,951
Who' s the gunman?

212
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,270
I don' t know

213
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,112
Who knows?

214
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,757
My son i s not the gunman!

215
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,472
Who i s the gunman?

216
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,072
I rea I ly don' t know.

217
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,156
Who knows?

218
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,594
He knew! He h i red us.

219
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,154
Ma Zhan I i n, cut the crap!

220
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,509
I ' m just a dr iver...

221
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,351
You' re the gunman?

222
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,238

223
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,033
Then te I l us who

224
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,953
I don' t know.
They' re lying.

225
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,229
I real ly don' t know.

226
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,669
They say you' re in charge.

227
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,234
They' re lying to
save themse lves.

228
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,312
Why are you st i I l
here if you' re the dr iver?

229
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,916
The truck broke down,
I couldn' t fix it.

230
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,877
They can' t see you now.
Talk!

231
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,999
I real ly don' t

232
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,310
This is your last chance...

233
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,599
I real ly can' t help.

235
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,717

236
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,876
I just dr ive the truck...

237
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,356
I don' t know. I real ly don' t...

238
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,072
Talk to us!

239
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,839
I don' t know anything...

Talk!

241
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,796
I know nothing...

242
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,196
Talk to us!

243
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,878
I know nothing...

244
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,275
Let me go

245
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,636

246
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,471

247
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,193
I don' t know anything...

248
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,229
I know nothing...

249
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,832
Talk now or I ' I l shoot you!

250
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,989
Alr ight I ' I l tel I you.
Don' t ki I l me.

251
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,110
The pelts are here..

252
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,596
Dig!

253
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,995
They' re al I here.
There are more underneath...

254
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,073
How many do we have?

255
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,273
547, mostly female.

256
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,950
Now it' s the breeding season.
What a shame.

257
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,150
The gunman got away.

258
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,830
What about the
men you captured?

259
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,155
They were from
sma I l ca I i ber r i f les.

260
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,951
The real gunmen
use machine guns.

261
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,673
I ' ve been chas i ng
them for years.

262
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,994
Can I have one?

263
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,590
Thanks.

264
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,151
What do you do?

265
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,112
I skin the animals.

266
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,114
How much do they pay you?

267
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,196
Five Yuan for each pe lt.

268
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,716
I ' m the fastest
skinner in Ge' ermu.

269
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,195
Al I my chi ldren
are here too.

270
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,314
He' s my oldest,
the middle one and the youngest.

271
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,354
They' re al I skinners.

272
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,594
In the past,
I was a shepherd.

273
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,308
I herded sheep,
cattle and camels.

274
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,595
Now the grasslands
have turned into desert.

275
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,509
The sheep and cattle are
al I gone dead or sold off.

276
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,873
It' s tough to survive here.

277
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,953
I need to pee.

278
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,317
Me too.

279
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,437
Alr ight stop yel I ing.

280
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,159
Gayu hand me the bucket.

281
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,517
I want to pee.

282
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,074
Take your turn.

283
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,269
The gunman had to
cross this r iver...

284
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,308
if they' re head ing north.

285
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,990
It' s crossable.

286
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,679
(Tibetan) 1, 2, 3

287
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,469
Get up and he lp!

288
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,394
Who wants a dr ink?

289
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,950
Day 9

290
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,114
Rope.

291
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,070
Everyone gets a half.

292
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,673
I want more!
I haven' t had anything in days!

293
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,271
We are shar ing our food
with you! That' s al I you got!

294
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,630
Thank you.

295
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,549
(Tibetan song) Like
flowing water...

296
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:16,437
Oh, dear mother...
no matter how far I travel...

297
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,033
I shal I return...
no matter how far I travel...

298
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,757
Clouds of br i I l iant white
please del iver my message,

299
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,680
I long for home...

300
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,878
I pray for you
in my heart...

301
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,994
Get inside! Turn around!

302
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,675
Can' t sleep?

303
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,238
Air is thin up here.
It' s better outside the car.

304
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,796
Your nose is
bleeding again.

305
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,194
It' s alright.

306
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,795
It' s beautiful!

307
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,189
Isn' t it.

308
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,598
I get homesick every time
I go out on patrol.

309
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,429
Even the I ights in the
highway remind me of home.

310
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,236
But when I ' m home
I start thinking of Kekexi I i.

311
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,953
Do you know what does
Kekexi I i mean in Tibetan?

312
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,192
It means beaut iful
mountains and gi r ls.

313
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,870
Isn' t it.

314
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,791
In Kekexi I i,

315
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,156
each step may be the
first human footpr int ever,

316
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,916
ever in that spot
since the wor ld began.

317
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,679
Those are not my words.

318
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,396
Two years ago a geologist
came from Be i j ing.

319
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,192
I took him to Kekexi I i
and he said that to me.

320
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,876
Later the geologist
was miss ing.

321
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,355
No one has seen him since then.

322
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,233
There' s a lot of
quicksand around here.

323
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,393
(Tibetan)You idiot!

324
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,434
Where are the poachers?

325
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,869
Where are they?

326
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,954
Ma Zhanl in escaped with his sons.

327
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,156
When did you fal I asleep?

328
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,269
Around 5 AM.

329
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,198
Captain...

330
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,514
Let go of me!

331
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,354
Hunt them down!

332
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,988
Stop!

333
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,670
Stop! Did you hear me.

334
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,592
Get down! Down!

335
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,709
Watch him!

336
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,719
Get up!

337
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,630
Where' s the key?

338
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:47,876
I don' t have it.

339
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,470
I real ly don' t have it.

340
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,238
What' s this?

341
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,955
What' s wrong?

342
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,515
Pulmonary edema.

343
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,589
Water?

344
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,799
There isn' t any.

345
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,429
I can help...

346
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,753
Let him try, he was
a vet in Ge' ermu.

347
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,279
Hold his arm.

348
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,990
(Tibetan)Liu Dong, you take
Dawa back to see the doctor.

349
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,755
(Tibetan)Ping Cuo,
you should go back too.

350
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,873
(Tibetan)My shoulder
wound isn' t that bad.

351
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,754
(Tibetan) I can he lp
watch the pr isoners.

352
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,234
(Tibetan) Alr ight.

353
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,714
(Tibetan)We need money
for the doctor.

354
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,715
Give him some money.

355
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,190
It' s not enough.

356
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,430
Do we have more?

357
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,715
One the fine for the county.

358
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,910
Give it to him.

359
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,509
Sti I l not enough.

360
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,634
Se I l the pe lts.

361
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,239
I ' m going after the gunman,

362
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,873
you take the route
through Huatugou.

363
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,395
(Tibetan)OK

364
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,839
(Tibetan)Good Luck.
Good Luck.

365
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,469
(Tibetan)Goodbye.
Goodbye.

366
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,036
(Tibetan) Be safe.

367
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,637
Captain,

376
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,031
That should be
enough to catch them.

377
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,198
Step back.

378
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,512

379
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,234

00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,477
If you can' t make
it then it' s your fate.

392

00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,190
Out of oi l.

398

401

424
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,999
You miss me but you

00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,878
Did you spend my money

432

442
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,192
They' I l never find us.
We' re going to d ie here.

443
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,910
Shut up!

444
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,156
Your whole situation
looks pretty desperate.

445
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,829
We' re short of money,
short of men, short of guns.

446
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,632
My guys haven' t got
paid for almost a year.

447
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,119
Can the county he lp?

448
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,348
We' re not official ly employed.

449
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,878
How do you pay for the patrol?

450
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,632
We have to come up
with the money ourse lves.

451
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:54,750
What do you do with the pelts?

452
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,674
We hand most of them
to the author it ies.

453
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,836
Do you se I l some to
raise the money?

454
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,909
Se I l ing the pe lts is i I legal.

455
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,717
How should I wr ite
the art icle?

456
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,599
I always thought
I ' m a good journal ist...

457
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,835
I know you' re a reporter.

458
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,191
You think Kekexi I i is
protected by you reporters?

459
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,912
I ' I l go to pr ison if
I have to.

460
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,715
I know sel I ing
pelts is i I legal.

461
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:29,110
But I can' t worry
about that now.

462
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,194
Ever seen prostrators
on a pi lgr image?

463
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,952
The i r faces and
hands are fi lthy.

464
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,871
But their hearts are pure.

465
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,116
I sold pelts before,
I had no choice.

466
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,394
It' s highway on the other
side of the mountains.

467
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,399
We have to catch them
before they get there.

468
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:29,916
(Tibetan)Look around
for something to eat.

469
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:41,996
How much bul lets do we have?

470
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,795
A few dozen.

471
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,554
Yixi, what d id you do
before this?

472
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,669
I was a student.

473
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,551
Where?

474
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,630
Qinghai Normal University.

475
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,233
You should be a teacher.

476
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,709
This job is more interesting

477
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,355
Gayu, are you married?

478
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,356
No.

479
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,311
Girlfriend?

480
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,990
We broke up right before
I came here.

481
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,550
Just I ike my patrol,

482
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,556
each time they go out their
girlfriends leave them.

483
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,069
There are plenty nice girls
out there.

484
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,389
Isn' t that right, Yixi?

485
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,396
Right.

486
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,357
What did Bading do before?

487
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,874
A professional rabbits hunter.

488
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,910
Nonsense.

489
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,030
He worked at a
highway checkpoint.

490
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,953
For logging trucks.

491
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,029
They worked al I kind of
jobs before joined the team.

492
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,437
Liu Dong was a Taxi dr iver,
AWang was a soldier,

493
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,509
Songj i was a herder.

494
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,596
For you.

495
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,189
Have some!

496
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,555
Up in those mountains,
there' s nothing to eat.

497
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,155
Day 17

498
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,829
Can Yixi and Bading
find their way out?

499
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,714
I think so.

500
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,269
Should we wait for them here?

501
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,229
Ma Zhanl in, you' re sti I l al ive.

502
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,589
I am. But many died
on the way out.

503
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,958
My team got separated too.

504
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,239
This is captain Ritai,

505
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,154
This is our boss.

506
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,549
Captain, have a smoke.

507
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,918
I ' ve been chasing you
for years.

508
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,233
Why?

509
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,994
You ki I led my antelope.

510
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,874
So did a lot of people.

511
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,190
That' s no excuse.

512
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,194
So what do you want?

513
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,554
You come with me.

514
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,390
Captain,
if you let me off the hook.

515
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,878
I ' I l buy you two cars,

516
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,192
And I ' I l bui ld you
a new house too.

517
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,670
Our boss is kind,

518
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,433
And he' s r ich... Shut up!

519
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,914
Surrender your guns
and come with me.

520
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,994
Sure! Let' s give the
Captain our guns.

521
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,596
We' I l join his
mountains patrol...

522
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,435
Who fired?

523
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,435
Who fired the gun?

524
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,269
I did.

525
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,431
Fuck you.
You almost hit me.

526
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,556
He' s sti I l al ive.

527
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,516
Are you a patrolmen?

528
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,194
No, he' s not Ritai ' s guy.

529
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,952
You' re a dead man if you are!

530
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,310
He' s not.

531
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,278
Fol low our footpr ints for five
ki lometers to find the highway

532
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,098
