2
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,608
When I die, I am going to go
straight to heaven,

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,538
and you're going to ask me why.

4
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:41,007
Did I
pray enough?

5
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,408
No.

6
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,917
Did I share enough?

7
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:48,319
Not really.

8
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,707
Was I humble enough?

9
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,127
Definitely not.

10
00:00:56,231 --> 00:01:01,567
"So, what makes you so sure you're going
straight to heaven," you ask me.

11
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:05,335
And I will tell you.

12
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:09,309
Because I told the truth.

13
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:12,934
And five, six, seven, eight, and:

14
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,774
<i>Humanity seems to be divided</i>
<i>into two categories.</i>

15
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:20,772
<i>People trying to be good</i>
<i>and people trying to be bad.</i>

16
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:24,180
Three, four and five.

17
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,219
Borey, get those back legs under.

18
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:31,052
<i>But personally, I don't</i>
<i>always see so much difference,</i>

19
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:33,626
<i>Because if you spend your
whole life as a saint,</i>

20
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:38,755
<i>eventually you will crave the opposite,</i>
<i>and the filth will appear</i>

21
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,833
<i>as an oasis in the desert.</i>

22
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,232
That was a bit better, but the arms:

23
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,973
Yes, keeping the shoulders down.

24
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,872
But if you'll spend
your life in the gutter,

25
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,708
sooner or later,
you will be searching for wisdom.

26
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:00,743
<i>Like a pig sniffing for truffles.</i>

27
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,583
Hanky-panky, goddamn bastard.

28
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,054
Filth and wisdom.

29
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:41,127
They are two sides of the same coin.

30
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:09,981
<i>And you know</i>
<i>whichever side is facing up</i>

31
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:14,625
<i>eventually will lead
to your salvation.</i>

32
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:17,790
<i>In my country, we have a saying:</i>

33
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:22,429
He who licks the knives
soon will cut his tongue.

34
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:42,081
So if you want to be saved,
you've got to go to hell first.

35
00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:45,589
Drop and give me 20,
you skinny little fuck.

36
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,755
You worthless piece of shit.
You're fucking pathetic.

37
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:52,528
You'd never make it into
my platoon.

38
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,294
Sir, yes, sir.

39
00:04:56,938 --> 00:05:00,271
What the fuck did you just call me?
Did you tell me to fuck my mother?

40
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:02,534
No, sir.

41
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,200
Uh-huh.

42
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,506
So you're saying
that my sister is a whore?

43
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:08,841
Do you know what?

44
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:15,251
I fucked your sister
and I fucked her in the ass.

45
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,617
Lick my boots, you fucking pencil-dick!

46
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:24,321
You gotta fucking lick them!

47
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,962
Fucking disgusting.

48
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,813
Your time is up.

49
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:03,697
Oh, he is guilty who is not at home.

50
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,109
Thank you.

51
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,053
Can it just be true
that when we tip our head to the left,

52
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:27,790
the liquids inside run this way,

53
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,925
and so we pretty much think
that shit is this way?

54
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,032
Then we tip our head to the right

55
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,564
and the liquids inside flow other way,

56
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,210
and we think
pretty much the opposite?

57
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,951
Or just keep your head all straight,

58
00:06:54,522 --> 00:06:57,184
like dear old Daddy says,

59
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:02,290
and pretty soon you'll get yourself
a swamp up there.

60
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:10,463
Take Professor Flynn.

61
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,670
<i>He live on the ground floor.</i>

62
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:19,205
Andre?

63
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,440
The one and only. Here I come.
- Andre!

64
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:28,021
<i>He write many books</i>
<i>and has much respect as a poet,</i>

65
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:31,090
<i>but he sit in darkness and alone.</i>

66
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:36,259
- What took you so long?
- Come in, come in.

67
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,734
I'll just put away this for you.

68
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:44,463
- <i>I'm his errand boy.</i>
- Thank you.

69
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,166
At your service any time.

70
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,309
<i>And not in a kinky way.</i>

71
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:53,413
A little bit noisy upstairs
last night, Andre.

72
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,175
<i>He's got a swamp up there.</i>

73
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,374
Andre?

74
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,515
How many times? My name is A.K.

75
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,890
- Why can't you just call me A.K.?
- I thought we had an arrangement.

76
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:12,965
Yeah, an arrangement is that
I get paid to be your errand boy.

77
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,658
- Overpaid.
- Overpaid.

78
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:17,134
- Overpaid.
- Overpaid.

79
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:22,469
And not that you get to call me a name
that a dog of a father gave to me.

80
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:26,739
- Stop being so dramatic, Andre.
- But I love dramatic.

81
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:29,314
And I love words.

82
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:34,247
There is more to love than words.

83
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,720
For instance?

84
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,098
For instance,
a back of a woman's neck.

85
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,825
Ah.

86
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,235
But you needed words
to tell me that.

87
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,410
Mm? Naughty, naughty, naughty.

88
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,206
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

89
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,917
Touché, professor.

90
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:14,157
I don't mean to be rude,
but if you love words so much,

91
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:16,421
how could you stop writing?

92
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:23,496
The day I stopped seeing
is the day I stopped writing.

93
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:30,874
Well, then you're just
wasting your talent.

94
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:36,711
How, may I ask, are you wasting yours?

95
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:44,917
The last time a man put his hand on me
did not end very nicely.

96
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:51,793
Strange how every branch has desire
to imitate its root.

97
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:15,919
<i>Where Rimsky and Korsakov they met</i>

98
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:21,084
<i>On the Sturm and Drang banquet</i>

99
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:33,871
<i>Still I miss Carpaty!</i>

100
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,976
<i>Miss Carpaty, miss Carpaty</i>

101
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:40,204
<i>Miss Carpaty, miss Carpaty</i>

102
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:44,944
<i>Sojuzivka is the best</i>

103
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,020
<i>Oh, how I miss Carpaty!</i>

104
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:15,380
Have a nice day, professor.

105
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,667
- Morning, Sardeep.
- Morning, morning. Please hurry.

106
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:36,894
- We have many bloody customers today.
- Okay.

107
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,198
- Come, come, come.
- Okay.

108
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:41,603
Okay. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

109
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:43,971
- Give me a minute.
- All right.

110
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,958
Oh, Juliette.

111
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,299
Bloody hell.

112
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,934
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

113
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,042
Hello.

114
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:19,109
It'll just be a few moments, okay?

115
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,611
Sardeep.

116
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,642
Hi, Chloe.

117
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,945
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

118
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,284
I'm a little busy right now.

119
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:34,918
- Dad says hello.
- Hello, Dad.

120
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,631
Yeah, he's hoping you'll get sick
of this hideous job,

121
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,327
change your mind about going
to medical school.

122
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:46,632
Since when did you become his
step-and-fetch-it dog?

123
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,672
I'm not going to medical school.

124
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:55,276
I want to help people,
not rip them off on Harley Street.

125
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,310
Dad helps people.

126
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,852
Yeah, he has the healing touch.

127
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:02,249
We both know that.

128
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,690
Juliette?

129
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:10,360
Thank you. Miss? Excuse me?

130
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:13,028
Thank you.

131
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:14,659
Spare change?

132
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,330
Why can't you just let go
of the past?

133
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,803
That's exactly what I'm doing.

134
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,006
I miss you.

135
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,604
Are you all right there, Sar?
Deep in thought, are we, my son?

136
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,214
Hello, Mickey. You all right?
I didn't see you there.

137
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,850
- Good, thank you.
- Just this?

138
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:05,713
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

139
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:10,281
Can I? Thank you very much,
and here's your change.

140
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:12,322
- Thank you.
- And a bag. You want a bag?

141
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:15,929
- Yes, please.
- Of course you want a bag.

142
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,154
- Your bag.
- Thank you.

143
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:20,266
- By the way, how is the wife and kids?
- Fine.

144
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,062
Nice, liking your style. Quality.

145
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:24,901
Ta-da.

146
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,898
Why is everyone obsessed with
these bloody, starving Africans?

147
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:33,204
Oh, hello.

148
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,439
- I'll have the money by next week.
- Yeah, no worries.

149
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:39,984
I mean, you know, there's no rush.
Just when you can.

150
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,985
I'm sorry. You know I'd give it to you.

151
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:44,283
<i>Take Holly, for example.</i>

152
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,689
<i>She's got herself
a swamp there too.</i>

153
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:49,560
She's beautiful.

154
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,858
She ballet dancing for 16 years.

155
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:58,403
She is everything I've ever wanted,

156
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,638
but she's broke.

157
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,044
Okay, will someone please tell me
why I still don't have a job?

158
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,708
Maybe I can try. Let's see.

159
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:14,146
It's not 1800s anymore,
we're not in Russia,

160
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:17,154
and nobody gives a fuck about ballet.

161
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:19,554
Heh. Yeah, we're all fucked.

162
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:22,924
Heh-heh. Speak for yourself,
fucking Florence Nightingbird.

163
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,156
I'm this far away from
transcontinental superstardom.

164
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:30,168
And I'm this far away
from telling the rest of your band

165
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:32,828
what you do to make money.

166
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,807
- Did you take your medication?
- Yeah, did you?

167
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:44,983
You know, in my country,
there is a saying:

168
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,918
If you want to reach the sky,
fuck a duck and try to fly.

169
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,948
Listen, blondie pretty girl.

170
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:55,794
You don't need to lead this
mouth-to-hand existence.

171
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:58,261
You have a whole cash box
on your body.

172
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:02,528
A good stripper can make
a lot of dough in just one night.

173
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,463
You have the body for it,

174
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:08,808
so dance, sweet baby girl.

175
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:14,714
- You are a vile, disgusting gypsy.
- Yeah, yeah.

176
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:17,077
I'd never even contemplate
taking my clothes off

177
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,219
for a bunch of dirty old men.

178
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:26,950
How much?

179
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,025
That's my girl.

180
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,332
I knew you were a filthy slut.

181
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:51,536
Excuse me, do you know where
I can find Harry Beechman?

182
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,246
Mr. Beechman?

183
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,420
- I'm Beechman.
- Oh.

184
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:02,885
I'm here for the audition.
We spoke on the phone.

185
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:04,648
Ah.

186
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:07,626
You must be Holly.

187
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,956
<i>Enchanté,</i> Holly.

188
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,762
<i>Enchanté,</i> Holly.

189
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:17,665
Mmm. Um...

190
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,402
Do you have a costume?

191
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:22,542
I have a leotard.

192
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,108
Oh, dear.

193
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,574
Knickers and bra will do.

194
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:30,749
Right. Do you have a changing room?

195
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:34,418
- No.
- No.

196
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,151
Come on.

197
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,959
That's it, lovely.

198
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,123
Undress for me, Holly.

199
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,428
Hit it, Ade.

200
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:56,600
That's it.

201
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:11,988
Ooh.

202
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:14,290
No. No.

203
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:25,166
The pole, the pole. Work the pole, dear.

204
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:32,407
No, no. Ooh.

205
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:34,379
Uh...

206
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,020
Take them off. Off.

207
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:50,296
Turn around.

208
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:52,892
Turn it.

209
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:56,259
Fantastic.

210
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:59,605
Okay, that'll do, Ade.

211
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:03,332
Um...

212
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,603
Not exactly Cirque du Soleil.

213
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,944
Perhaps we can work
on a speciality act.

214
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,784
Oh, no, no, no.

215
00:20:15,956 --> 00:20:18,254
Otherwise the glue factory's
waiting for you, Mr. Frisky.

216
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,993
And now let's kick it up,
kick it up and let's kick it up.

217
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:30,262
And now, perhaps a little bit
of honey oats.

218
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:42,343
<i>The problem with having</i>
<i>a cash box in your body</i>

219
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:46,509
<i>is that you always feel empty,</i>
<i>even when it's full.</i>

220
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:51,854
<i>And sooner or later</i>
<i>you'll end up feeling ripped off.</i>

221
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:56,325
Oh, Francine. Impeccable timing.

222
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:58,555
Um, this is Holly.

223
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:03,500
She needs a bit of tutoring,
so I'll leave you two alone for a while.

224
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:06,229
Uh...

225
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,872
And see what you can do with it.

226
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,282
Right, let's get down to business.

227
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,184
First thing's first.
Take those fucking tights off.

228
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,961
Before Christmas would be nice.

229
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:44,205
Okay, right. Grab the pole,
keep your arms straight, lean out

230
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,939
and walk slowly round.

231
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:53,142
Arch your back, tits out,
ass out, chin up,

232
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,220
maintain eye contact
with your audience.

233
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,155
Well, look like you're
enjoying yourself, then.

234
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,523
I am.

235
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:06,231
Tracey.

236
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,232
- Come here and show her how it's done.
- Hi.

237
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:10,461
Hi.

238
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,430
You ain't as bad as you think you are.

239
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,694
You should see the slappers
that turn up here.

240
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,395
At least you've got class. Ah.

241
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:53,106
Look, all you got to remember
is one, Japs tip best,

242
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,443
two, what happens in the club
stays in the club,

243
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:59,050
and three, stay away from teenagers.

244
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:02,552
- They never have any money.
- I just can't get my head around the pole.

245
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:07,116
You'll get the hang of it, Mary Poppins.
It ain't your head you gotta get round it.

246
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:06,807
Who's there?

247
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:11,841
Andre?

248
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,429
Andre.

249
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,604
Good, up with the knees.

250
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:40,473
<i>It's true.</i>

251
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:43,211
<i>There is duality in everything.</i>

252
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:47,710
<i>But perhaps I should ask myself</i>
<i>this question:</i>

253
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:55,061
<i>Am I consciously or unconsciously,</i>
<i>actively or passively,</i>

254
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,364
<i>collaborating at this very moment</i>
<i>with some behavior</i>

255
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:06,471
<i>that is destined to wreak havoc</i>
<i>on another human being?</i>

256
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:09,034
And good.

257
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:19,751
That's better, yes. <i>Échappé</i>
to escape, not these mini little things.

258
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,717
That's better. Right open.

259
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,751
Thanks.

260
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,684
Oh.

261
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,032
Typical bloody Jew.

262
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:46,102
You know, Juliette, there are over
1 million orphans living in Mumbai.

263
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,773
You obviously haven't been
reading the bloody news.

264
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:52,112
Is that so? Well, why don't you tell me
the bloody news?

265
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:55,482
Last night on Channel 4, documentary,
45 minutes with John Snow.

266
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,452
Really, really fantastic.

267
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:00,752
Oh, bloody chutya.

268
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:07,361
I told her not to come to work.
One moment, please.

269
00:28:55,642 --> 00:29:00,272
Just get the fuck out of here.
Just get the fuck out of here!

270
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,675
- Fuck!
- Get off me.

271
00:29:01,848 --> 00:29:04,578
Get the fuck out of here!

272
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:55,958
- Sorry we're late, sir.
- Sit down, girls.

273
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:01,830
- Has everybody done their prep?
- Yes, sir.

274
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,833
Rothschild hasn't.

275
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:08,538
"Sir." What, "sir"?

276
00:30:09,616 --> 00:30:11,413
No, sir.

277
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:14,510
You, Rothschild.

278
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:20,121
What is 947 divided by the
square root of power of 10?

279
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:23,523
Don't know, sir.

280
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:28,627
- You don't know.
- No.

281
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:31,569
Well, come out here, guttersniper.

282
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:36,701
Assume the position.

283
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,347
The other position, imbecile.

284
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,479
The other position, you moron!

285
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:53,224
What is the square root

286
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:59,923
of 947 divided by the square root

287
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,260
of power of 10?

288
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,163
- Four.
- No.

289
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,330
Three?

290
00:31:08,508 --> 00:31:09,532
- Twenty?
- No.

291
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:10,733
- Thirty-four?
- No.

292
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,172
Forty-two.

293
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:14,445
Right.

294
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:16,878
- Right?
- No.

295
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,449
Sixteen.

296
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:21,420
Sit down.

297
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:10,558
"I traveled the world looking
for lovers of the ultimate beauty

298
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:13,137
and never settled in."

299
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,330
"I..."

300
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:21,003
"I've traveled the world looking
for lovers of ultimate beauty."

301
00:32:26,386 --> 00:32:31,915
"I've traveled the world
looking for lovers of the ultimate beauty

302
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:34,150
but never settled in."

303
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:04,387
I am a wonderlust king.

304
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,668
<i>Let me be gone</i>

305
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:42,551
Whoo!

306
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:34,076
<i>I've traveled the world</i>

307
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:51,964
<i>I stay on the run</i>

308
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:57,432
<i>Let me out</i>

309
00:34:57,603 --> 00:34:59,332
<i>Let me be gone</i>

310
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:08,141
<i>Beat-up road sign</i>

311
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:16,481
<i>History of time</i>

312
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:40,810
<i>I am a wonderlust king</i>

313
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:50,878
So, what's your schedule like
for today, then?

314
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:53,685
I thought I'd take another look
at a few more properties.

315
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,819
How many times do you have to look at
a property before you start to develop it?

316
00:35:57,997 --> 00:36:00,158
Lot of details to work out.

317
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:03,268
Square footage,
investment value, neighborhood.

318
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:06,234
Will you put that fucking
newspaper down?

319
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,104
That's better. Now...

320
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:18,840
You were saying?

321
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:20,883
I was saying...

322
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:25,187
- Details. Mm-hm.
- Details to work out.

323
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,055
Structure, expansion capabilities.

324
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,593
Uh-huh.

325
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:35,157
Sorry. Sorry, darling.
What was I saying?

326
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:41,204
Something about capability
to expand a structure.

327
00:36:44,844 --> 00:36:45,970
Ooh.

328
00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:49,410
Look at the time. I'd better be...

329
00:36:58,824 --> 00:37:01,315
Better. Better.

330
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:03,553
We all want to be better.

331
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,825
I want to be better.

332
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,602
We want to be better.
The whole world would like to be better.

333
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,762
We'd all be better
if it was a better world.

334
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,702
You think you're too good for this?

335
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,175
It's bad enough
I have to get my tits out.

336
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:02,405
I'm shit.

337
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:08,213
I'm never gonna be as good as Tracey.
It's just so humiliating.

338
00:39:11,157 --> 00:39:12,249
Do you mind?

339
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:17,761
- It's a gents', isn't it?
- Yeah, so be a gent and fuck off.

340
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:28,937
Don't you ever feel guilty doing this?

341
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:31,303
Devil's already got his piece, isn't it?

342
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:35,436
I don't need to give him another one
by feeling guilty about it.

343
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:38,874
Anyways, it's not about what you
show men,

344
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:43,382
it's about what you don't show them.
Men like mystery.

345
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,416
Oh, and by the way,
no one wants you to be like Tracey.

346
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,688
Just be yourself.

347
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,529
Now stop your fucking crying.
I'll give you a lift home.

348
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:02,601
I treat her like a princess.

349
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,175
You don't know how to treat anybody
like a princess.

350
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:07,972
- Ah, Holly, please sit down.
- I've really got to get going.

351
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:10,115
Why? The night is young.

352
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,649
The moon is but a twinkle
within thine eye.

353
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:18,122
- Please. What time is it, Ade?
- Hmm.

354
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,851
- Tick-tock, it's a drink o'clock.
- On the dot.

355
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:26,521
Come on. You know, you've been
making such splendid progress.

356
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,896
- Let's celebrate.
- Okay, but I'm not drinking.

357
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:32,435
Just one little sip?

358
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:33,629
There.

359
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:38,633
You've got a phenomenal look about you.
You could be an actress.

360
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,080
- Really?
- Absolutely. I've done a couple...

361
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:45,183
Sometimes I throw VIP parties,
and it's an opportunity

362
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:49,879
for my most talented girls
to make rather a lot of cash on the side.

363
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:51,079
Or on top.

364
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:54,416
So what am I,
an actress or a prostitute?

365
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:55,992
No need to get defensive.

366
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,323
- Are you two at it again?
- Uh...

367
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,192
- No.
- Yeah.

368
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:04,166
You, you couldn't even pull
your own fucking hair, darling.

369
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,463
Pull your hair.

370
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,665
- Pathetic.
- Pathetic?

371
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,675
That don't even touch the fucking sides.

372
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:36,264
Stop fussing with me.
I know how to walk up the stairs.

373
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:37,993
Come on.

374
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,738
Something to drink?
- Yes.

375
00:41:42,908 --> 00:41:44,205
Shall I get the sommelier?

376
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,072
No, you can get us a nice bottle
of Pinot Grigio.

377
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,979
Do you know what you're gonna order?

378
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,920
Sorry, do you want me
to read you the menu?

379
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:57,021
That won't be necessary.

380
00:41:57,189 --> 00:42:00,090
I'll have the faggots in brine.

381
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,657
I'm kidding, Holly.

382
00:42:05,264 --> 00:42:07,698
I thought prostitutes
and minge-munchers

383
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:11,359
and strippers were supposed
to be good fun.

384
00:42:11,537 --> 00:42:13,596
Don't call me that.

385
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:18,468
Anyway, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

386
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:21,772
I'm still in denial that I have to
take my clothes off to make a living.

387
00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:25,940
Ah. Well, for one thing, you don't have to,
you've chosen to do it.

388
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:31,088
And secondly, stop being
so bloody puritanical.

389
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,954
Isadora Duncan danced naked
in front of prime ministers and kings.

390
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:37,588
Wasn't she strangled to death
by her own scarf?

391
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:44,191
Yes. If you play your cards right,
you too can have a glamorous death.

392
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,431
That doesn't make me feel any better
about being a pole dancer.

393
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,542
The road to success is paved
with humiliation.

394
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:55,435
The sooner you accept that,
the easier the journey will get.

395
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:59,243
Now, let's have a toast
to your new profession.

396
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:03,718
Christopher Flynn, the wunderlust king.

397
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,649
What bloody cave
have you been hiding in?

398
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:12,229
Holly, this is Lorcan O'Neill,
a very old crony of mine.

399
00:43:12,398 --> 00:43:14,559
He's won a Pulitzer Prize.

400
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:20,501
He also taught me the finer art
of fellatio as an undergrad at Oxford.

401
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:25,340
Relax, Holly, I'm kidding again.

402
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:28,709
No, he's not.

403
00:43:29,882 --> 00:43:33,784
- I'm loving the gray, by the way.
- I hadn't noticed.

404
00:43:33,953 --> 00:43:36,581
Been too busy fumbling around
in the dark.

405
00:43:36,755 --> 00:43:38,382
Sir?

406
00:43:38,557 --> 00:43:41,856
So how have you been puffing
yourself up these days?

407
00:43:42,027 --> 00:43:45,485
Haven't you seen the series I've had
published in the <i>Telegraph</i> this month?

408
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:49,862
- No. Very good, thank you.
- Shame, it's fucking good.

409
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:52,961
Actually, I'm here with my publisher

410
00:43:53,138 --> 00:43:57,598
to celebrate the fact that my new novel
has been short-listed for the Booker Prize.

411
00:43:58,277 --> 00:43:59,869
How very nice for you.

412
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,843
So you'll be needing a new mantelpiece

413
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:07,952
in your six-storey, semi-detached
Chelsea manor, won't you?

414
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,715
Well, it's seven, old boy,
and distinctly detached.

415
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,690
- I'm starving, can we order?
- Forgive me, I'm going.

416
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,488
Holly, it was lovely to meet you,

417
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:21,724
and, Christopher, such a very nice
surprise to see you after all these years.

418
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,529
Nice to see you too. Nice.

419
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,569
Are you ready to order?

420
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,972
- Um, I'll have a hamburger and fries.
- And I'll have the pheasant, thank you.

421
00:44:32,144 --> 00:44:34,704
Burger and fries are not going to look
very good in your G-string.

422
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,905
Maybe I'm trying to get fired.

423
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,715
They'll never fire you.
You're too beautiful.

424
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,978
How do you know what I look like?

425
00:44:42,154 --> 00:44:45,248
Andre may have mentioned it
once or twice.

426
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:47,289
Oh, yeah?

427
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:50,917
- What color's my hair?
- That's a tough one.

428
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:54,793
Let me see. I'll have to guess. Uh...

429
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:57,731
- Blond?
- No, I'm not. I'm a brunette.

430
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,371
You're not clever enough
to be a brunette.

431
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:05,442
You know he's in love with you,
don't you?

432
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,207
I think it's you he's in love with.
He can't stop talking about your poetry.

433
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,083
Well, he lives in a fantasy world,
doesn't he?

434
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,279
Don't we all?

435
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:09,772
I love this guy.

436
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:05,862
Property developer, my ass.

437
00:47:09,434 --> 00:47:12,733
Filthy little excuse for a man.

438
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:41,258
That's it.

439
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:43,986
I'm never doing this again,
you fucking gyppo.

440
00:48:44,162 --> 00:48:46,790
You fucked it up.
Who the fuck told you to open the door?

441
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,627
Find someone else
to do your dirty work.

442
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:53,532
Speaking of dirty work, I've gotta go.
I'm gonna be late.

443
00:49:00,212 --> 00:49:03,409
You know, in my country,
we have a saying

444
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:04,981
that a man without a mustache

445
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,381
- is like woman with mustache.
- I'm sick of your Ukrainian folklore.

446
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:10,384
Fuck you!

447
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:14,948
Take Juliette.

448
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:17,322
She's a nice girl.

449
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,725
She's also got a swamp up there.

450
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,702
<i>She cares a lot about
starving children in Africa,</i>

451
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,065
<i>and she don't know</i>
<i>she's starving too.</i>

452
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,582
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

453
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:42,014
What are you doing here?

454
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:46,452
- I've come to tell you something.
- Well, make it fast. I've got work to do.

455
00:49:46,992 --> 00:49:48,550
I'm leaving.

456
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:50,024
Leaving what?

457
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:55,233
School, home, everything.
I'm gonna travel the world,

458
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,662
find out who I am.

459
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,205
You wouldn't leave the driveway
without Mummy and Daddy's permission.

460
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,871
I've told Mum everything.

461
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:10,346
Aren't you the brave girl?

462
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:17,153
- I've gotta start somewhere.
- I just can't believe you'd do it, that's all.

463
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:18,983
I'd thought you'd be happy for me.

464
00:50:20,926 --> 00:50:22,223
I am happy for you.

465
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,565
But how can you afford
to travel the world?

466
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,765
Mum gave me money.

467
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:39,508
You're so weak.

468
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,942
So how does that work?

469
00:50:45,884 --> 00:50:50,514
You stick around for a few more years
of fatherly affection.

470
00:50:51,556 --> 00:50:56,687
You don't say anything about it
and get a nice prize.

471
00:50:58,663 --> 00:51:00,062
Well done.

472
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:10,330
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

473
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,372
Good for you.

474
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:19,744
Is it okay if I leave some
things with you before I go?

475
00:51:20,252 --> 00:51:22,914
Yeah, come by whenever.

476
00:51:23,088 --> 00:51:25,420
I've got to get to work.

477
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,869
Get out.

478
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,173
Mom, how do I look?

479
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,746
Where did you get these clothes?

480
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,897
It's for you.

481
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:10,296
Who the bloody did this to you?

482
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:12,460
I'll bloody fix him good.

483
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:15,003
I'd better get out front.

484
00:52:20,045 --> 00:52:22,206
I told you not to call me at work.

485
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,473
Yeah, well, I'm busy, busy, busy.

486
00:52:28,987 --> 00:52:30,682
Daughter, bloody prostitute.

487
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,120
I'll deal with Lakshmi
when I get home, all right?

488
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:34,883
Yeah, enough, all right.

489
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,835
Dinner is served.

490
00:53:44,729 --> 00:53:46,219
Oh, Juliette.

491
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,428
Bloody hell.

492
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:00,277
Sardeep.

493
00:54:05,016 --> 00:54:08,281
Sardeep.

494
00:54:32,377 --> 00:54:35,574
- What the bloody is this?
- What does it look like?

495
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:39,014
What are they doing
in your bloody pocket?

496
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:40,845
What are you doing
in my bloody pocket?

497
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,112
- You, with your preoccupation
- Excuse me.

498
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:44,983
with starving children of Africa.

499
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,886
Bloody Africa?
You can't even look after your bloody self.

500
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:50,892
Excuse me.
- You're a hypocrite.

501
00:54:51,062 --> 00:54:53,758
- Look who's talking.
- I put you on a pedestal.

502
00:54:53,932 --> 00:54:55,957
But it's your pedestal,
Sardeep, not mine.

503
00:54:56,134 --> 00:55:00,400
Don't you bloody interrupt me.
This is a respectable establishment.

504
00:55:00,572 --> 00:55:02,130
You can't show up here with pills

505
00:55:02,307 --> 00:55:04,537
and a black eye,
frightening off the customers.

506
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:06,472
- Quite right.
- Thank you.

507
00:55:06,645 --> 00:55:10,206
I'm an Indian, and this is
a bloody Indian establishment.

508
00:55:10,815 --> 00:55:14,683
I work so very hard every day.
Every day, for what, huh?

509
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:18,311
My wife screams at me from the moment
I get up to the moment I go to sleep.

510
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:22,859
All I want is a little bloody
peace and quiet in my life.

511
00:55:23,662 --> 00:55:27,564
And this is not a bloody ashram!

512
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,371
I will not work for a bigot.

513
00:55:38,076 --> 00:55:40,067
I'm going to Africa,

514
00:55:40,245 --> 00:55:44,079
and I don't care what you, or you,
or anyone else thinks about it.

515
00:55:44,249 --> 00:55:47,685
If I have to rob a bank
to pay my way, then so be it.

516
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,090
This is not...
- Piss off.

517
00:56:01,032 --> 00:56:03,660
Listen, if women
weren't so fucking boring,

518
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:05,234
Harry wouldn't be in business.

519
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:10,033
I hates woman, just like
my mommy and my sister.

520
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:13,302
I don't hate women.
I just feel sorry for them.

521
00:56:13,478 --> 00:56:16,106
They don't use their imagination,
you know?

522
00:56:16,281 --> 00:56:21,014
Men like strange, they like new.
I see it every night, don't I?

523
00:56:21,186 --> 00:56:23,552
You know how much pizza
I eat every week?

524
00:56:23,722 --> 00:56:27,317
Forty-nine for the delivery
to find one I like.

525
00:56:27,492 --> 00:56:29,016
What, you like the delivery boy?

526
00:56:29,194 --> 00:56:30,889
I love the delivery boys.

527
00:56:31,062 --> 00:56:33,929
In one night, I eat 20 pizza
because the same boy's coming.

528
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,226
You know what I say to him?

529
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:38,801
No.
- Call me Margarita tonight.

530
00:56:39,904 --> 00:56:42,304
Honey, you show me a beautiful girl

531
00:56:42,474 --> 00:56:44,874
and I'll show you a man
who's tired of fucking her.

532
00:56:45,043 --> 00:56:46,635
- Are you sure?
- You want varnish?

533
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:49,075
- Talk is cheap.
- Simple, isn't it?

534
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:52,011
Variety is the spice of life.

535
00:56:52,183 --> 00:56:53,707
Am I right or am I right?

536
00:56:54,352 --> 00:56:55,944
She's forever right.

537
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:08,657
Hi, Holly. Late again?

538
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,892
So how much do we know?

539
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:25,375
Is that Holly?

540
00:57:35,426 --> 00:57:37,553
Good girl.

541
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,640
Come on, Britney.

542
00:58:48,132 --> 00:58:50,100
Yo, professor.

543
00:58:59,444 --> 00:59:01,469
Delivery boy.

544
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:24,133
We've got ripe olives from Turkey.

545
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,468
We've got one loaf
organic bread, brown.

546
00:59:30,475 --> 00:59:32,466
We've got

547
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:36,810
a fruit basket from the Lord,
all sprinkled with nectars.

548
00:59:37,649 --> 00:59:39,913
A special for my blind man.

549
00:59:58,102 --> 01:00:00,127
Rubbish, isn't it?

550
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,170
No.

551
01:00:02,707 --> 01:00:04,231
In fact, it's brilliant.

552
01:00:06,277 --> 01:00:09,508
- I wanna read more.
- There aren't any more.

553
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,819
There are such things as Braille,
you know?

554
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,857
What's the point of sitting here
feeling sorry for yourself?

555
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:29,024
I would give my eyes
to write like you.

556
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:34,001
Okay, okay. Go, go.

557
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:38,465
Thank you for helping
the fucking blind man.

558
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:41,935
Can I just put away this for you?

559
01:00:42,113 --> 01:00:45,446
Please, just go.

560
01:00:45,616 --> 01:00:46,640
Go!

561
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:58,258
<i>Using the time. Good, ladies.</i>

562
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:09,736
Up. That's it. Right round.
Good. Oh, good.

563
01:01:10,742 --> 01:01:12,175
One, two.

564
01:01:14,145 --> 01:01:18,445
<i>And around. And four.</i>

565
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:26,122
Tight fifth, through,
and back to the last.

566
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,228
Good. Two.

567
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:34,522
Over.

568
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:58,052
And through.

569
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,955
<i>And...</i>

570
01:02:03,494 --> 01:02:04,552
Good.

571
01:02:04,729 --> 01:02:08,790
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Shaun.

572
01:02:08,966 --> 01:02:12,060
Right, see you tomorrow, thanks.

573
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,225
<i>Excellent choice.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

574
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,265
<i>Now, you know</i>
<i>what you should try with that?</i>

575
01:02:48,439 --> 01:02:51,033
<i>Just a little virgin olive oil,</i>

576
01:02:51,209 --> 01:02:53,939
<i>and just slowly dip in bread.</i>

577
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:04,349
<i>No, try this one.</i>
<i>Another one of Deb's recipes.</i>

578
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:07,252
<i>Pork pie and guacamole.</i>

579
01:03:50,301 --> 01:03:51,700
Ow!

580
01:03:54,105 --> 01:04:01,034
I'm so, so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
I'm sorry.

581
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:05,581
Have you done your homework?

582
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:09,713
Oh...

583
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,321
Mrs. Goldfarb,

584
01:04:12,823 --> 01:04:15,223
are you trying to seduce me?

585
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,091
Come here, you naughty little boy.

586
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,773
Come on. Over.

587
01:04:31,943 --> 01:04:33,501
- What are you?
- Naughty.

588
01:04:33,678 --> 01:04:37,409
A naughty little boy. Say it.

589
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,574
- Naughty.
- Naughty little boy.

590
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:43,811
Ah! Not that hard. Ow! Stop it.

591
01:04:43,988 --> 01:04:46,252
Fucking hell.

592
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:36,301
Two men fall through the chimney.
One is dirty, one is clean.

593
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,601
Which one needs to take a bath?

594
01:05:38,776 --> 01:05:41,404
You need to take a bath.

595
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:45,843
And stop sneaking around
like some perv.

596
01:05:46,017 --> 01:05:49,009
Why don't you just tell her?

597
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,951
How can you take that dude seriously

598
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:56,593
when he stopped getting laid
when he was 32?

599
01:05:57,695 --> 01:05:59,492
Sex isn't everything.

600
01:06:01,032 --> 01:06:03,262
It is in Africa.

601
01:06:06,904 --> 01:06:08,599
You're a sick man.

602
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,604
Thank you. Finally.

603
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:16,008
I traveled seven seas
to hear this, you know?

604
01:06:17,248 --> 01:06:20,445
And you traveled nowhere
and you're lost.

605
01:06:21,285 --> 01:06:22,843
Just don't get everyone lost with you.

606
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:36,189
By appointment only.

607
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:40,599
- I'm here to speak to Miss Juliette.
- That's also by appointment.

608
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:41,795
Do you beat her?

609
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:45,906
Only if she pays me.

610
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:49,840
Look at you, you piece of scum.

611
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,576
Know how lucky you are
to have a girl like this?

612
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,413
You should bloody well treat her better.
With <i>izat.</i> You know, respect.

613
01:06:56,587 --> 01:06:59,579
Is that right, randy Gandhi?

614
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:03,723
You bloody foreigner,
don't you talk to me like that.

615
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,657
Sardeep?

616
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:07,723
Hello.

617
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,832
Juliette.

618
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,265
He's all right. Let him in.

619
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:29,282
How are you? You okay?

620
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,186
- Fine, thank you.
- Good.

621
01:07:58,883 --> 01:08:03,411
Please forgive me for saying
those horrible, horrible things to you.

622
01:08:03,754 --> 01:08:09,090
You're a very nice girl, Juliette,
and I really want to make it up to you.

623
01:08:18,436 --> 01:08:19,494
Well, bloody open it.

624
01:08:28,179 --> 01:08:30,875
"Dear Miss Honan.

625
01:08:31,048 --> 01:08:33,175
Thank you for your interest
in the Peace Corps.

626
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:37,986
Your application has been accepted,

627
01:08:40,257 --> 01:08:43,454
and we are delighted to offer you
a post in Nairobi

628
01:08:43,627 --> 01:08:45,788
working as part of
the health-care program

629
01:08:45,963 --> 01:08:49,160
that focuses on children
orphaned by AIDS."

630
01:08:51,068 --> 01:08:54,595
Oh, my god, Sardeep.

631
01:08:55,706 --> 01:09:00,109
- I don't understand. I didn't...
- I did.

632
01:09:00,277 --> 01:09:03,371
And I hope you don't mind
I forged your bloody signature.

633
01:09:06,817 --> 01:09:12,016
And you're going to need one of these.

634
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:28,431
Oh, thank you.

635
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:36,308
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

636
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,813
My charity can was heavier than yours.

637
01:09:43,187 --> 01:09:46,054
Oh, my... Thank you so much.

638
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,050
Oh, Juliette.

639
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,392
I so wish I was coming with you.

640
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:56,431
It's going to be wonderful
with all those black, African,

641
01:09:57,134 --> 01:10:01,537
undernourished, skinny, skinny,
rickety children.

642
01:10:03,774 --> 01:10:08,336
Oh, Juliette,
you're such a wonderful girl.

643
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:16,353
- Oh, look what dragged in the cat.
- All right, Russki. Is the schoolgirl in?

644
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,455
Yeah, yeah, she is in her room
skinning foxes.

645
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:24,121
Making you a nice new
Russian hat, is she?

646
01:10:26,964 --> 01:10:31,094
Everyone east of Berlin
is making fur Russian hats for KGB...

647
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:34,431
Oh, excuse me.
Am I interrupting something?

648
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,665
No, no, that's all right.

649
01:10:38,642 --> 01:10:42,476
This is for Holly.
She forgot her tips last night.

650
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:45,215
I am her manager.

651
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:53,254
Yes, my little slut.

652
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,758
I heard that, man-whore.

653
01:11:02,099 --> 01:11:05,830
Envelopes, envelopes.
Everybody's getting envelopes.

654
01:11:06,003 --> 01:11:07,903
Where the fuck is my envelope?

655
01:11:21,852 --> 01:11:24,514
They're just in.

656
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:36,156
<i>Only when you eat a lemon</i>
<i>do you appreciate what sugar is.</i>

657
01:11:36,867 --> 01:11:39,335
<i>Life is a paradox,</i>

658
01:11:39,937 --> 01:11:42,167
<i>but is it, really?</i>

659
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:48,376
<i>Is the contradictions within and
around us really a form of dissonance,</i>

660
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:54,643
<i>or just another word for "accord"</i>
<i>in a language we are yet to discover.</i>

661
01:11:54,818 --> 01:12:00,051
<i>A language we're yet to learn.</i>
<i>A language we have been deprived of.</i>

662
01:12:02,092 --> 01:12:07,894
<i>We live in a mistaken world,</i>
<i>and it doesn't have to be so.</i>

663
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:13,333
<i>You can be an academic and come</i>
<i>to this realization by reading books,</i>

664
01:12:13,504 --> 01:12:15,870
<i>or you can discover</i>
<i>this new rebel intelligence</i>

665
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,009
<i>by waking up in your own vomit.</i>

666
01:12:19,777 --> 01:12:23,144
<i>Either way, you cannot lose.</i>

667
01:12:24,014 --> 01:12:28,178
<i>Without filth,
there can be no wisdom.</i>

668
01:12:28,452 --> 01:12:32,183
<i>Without darkness, no light.</i>

669
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:37,492
<i>In my country we have a saying:</i>

670
01:12:37,661 --> 01:12:42,792
<i>If the devil is powerless,</i>
<i>send him a woman.</i>

671
01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:46,159
Oh, I forgot.

672
01:12:50,307 --> 01:12:53,140
This came for you
in the post yesterday.

673
01:12:57,347 --> 01:13:00,908
And then, I get my envelope.

674
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,282
Yeah, yeah, who the fuck am I?

675
01:13:04,455 --> 01:13:09,688
But this song, the next song
is dedicated to a dead poet.

676
01:13:25,342 --> 01:13:31,076
Oh, you know it's easy for a
soul-searcher to leave his hometown,

677
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:34,307
where the folks bang their head
and figure much,

678
01:13:34,485 --> 01:13:36,510
men like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.

679
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:40,214
All these poor bastards that
never even get laid are taken seriously.

680
01:13:43,761 --> 01:13:47,253
Like, what the fuck can you
learn from them?

681
01:13:47,998 --> 01:13:50,296
Like, where is the true artistic gurus?

682
01:13:58,776 --> 01:14:04,510
Well, I prefer madmen,
like this bum on the street.

683
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:07,582
<i>I met the other day</i>

684
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:12,319
Who says, "That's so, like,
battles of the rose."

685
01:14:14,224 --> 01:14:16,556
Well, some of them are from the east.

686
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:21,130
<i>And some of them are from the west</i>

687
01:14:22,065 --> 01:14:25,193
<i>Just need to charge one another</i>

688
01:14:25,369 --> 01:14:28,861
<i>And stick it closer to the center</i>

689
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,703
<i>Where some kind of</i>
<i>Mystical cross-pollination</i>

690
01:14:33,877 --> 01:14:35,344
<i>Going on</i>

691
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:39,448
<i>Creating something out of nothing</i>

692
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:44,553
<i>Like works of art or the religion</i>

693
01:14:44,721 --> 01:14:47,189
<i>Straight out of nothing</i>

694
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:51,386
<i>My strange uncles from abroad</i>

695
01:14:51,562 --> 01:14:58,161
<i>Yes, I never met them, ooh</i>
<i>I took everything they wrote</i>

696
01:14:58,335 --> 01:15:01,793
<i>And I'll never forget them, ooh</i>

697
01:15:01,972 --> 01:15:05,464
<i>Through the mystical communication</i>

698
01:15:05,642 --> 01:15:08,975
<i>Deep within it all comes through</i>

699
01:15:09,146 --> 01:15:15,415
<i>Forming underground railroad</i>
<i>For our ultimate breakthrough</i>

700
01:15:43,013 --> 01:15:46,346
<i>My strange nephews from beyond</i>

701
01:15:46,516 --> 01:15:49,917
<i>I'll meet them on a cosmos street</i>

702
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:53,022
<i>And we will drink</i>
<i>To how we never told you</i>

703
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:56,920
<i>Don't trust a plastic beat</i>

704
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,359
<i>Through the mystical communication</i>

705
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:03,829
<i>Deep within it all comes through</i>

706
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:06,697
<i>Forming underground railroad</i>

707
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:10,601
<i>For our ultimate breakthrough</i>

708
01:17:19,242 --> 01:17:22,473
<i>Bright open eyes</i>

709
01:17:22,646 --> 01:17:25,979
<i>They are still looking</i>
<i>They are still finding</i>

710
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:29,016
<i>A few unpoisoned hearts</i>

711
01:17:29,586 --> 01:17:32,885
<i>No matter where you are exiled</i>

712
01:17:33,056 --> 01:17:36,548
<i>No matter where you are exiled!</i>

713
01:17:47,637 --> 01:17:53,075
Straight out of nothing.

714
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:08,119
Straight out of nothing.

715
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:15,525
You see, my friend, feeling good
is just as contagious as feeling bad.

716
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,497
Two sides of a same coin.

717
01:18:22,973 --> 01:18:24,838
The lesson.

718
01:18:26,643 --> 01:18:30,443
So if your ship comes in, <i>ohuenno.</i>

719
01:18:30,947 --> 01:18:34,439
Let's get as many people
onboard as possible.

720
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:39,212
We're all in the same <i>pizdetz</i>
boat here, and if it sinks,

721
01:18:39,389 --> 01:18:41,983
we're all going down together.

722
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:46,460
<i>Extra maximum, double radical
respect straight out of Ukraine</i>

723
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:49,724
<i>to my new neighbor
who jam, rewind.</i>

724
01:18:55,038 --> 01:18:57,097
When I die?

725
01:18:57,908 --> 01:19:00,035
When I die.

726
01:19:00,744 --> 01:19:03,611
I don't know, but when I die...

727
01:19:04,314 --> 01:19:05,713
Uh...

728
01:19:06,349 --> 01:19:09,477
- Straight to fucking hell, man.
- And action.
