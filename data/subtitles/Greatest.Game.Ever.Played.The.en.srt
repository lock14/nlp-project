1
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:25,229
This is a true story...

2
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:34,557
ISLE OF JERSEY - ENGLAND - 1879

3
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:58,340
VARDON COTTAGE

4
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:47,741
Who are you?

5
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:49,745
What are you doing?

6
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:52,746
There's a golf links
going in here.

7
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,831
What's golf?

8
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,335
Golf is a game
played by gentlemen.

9
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,421
Not for the likes of you.

10
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:03,340
Now, run along, boy.

11
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,783
THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED

12
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,329
Here it is, sir.

13
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,846
Come on! Let's go!

14
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,456
HARRY VARDON,
THREE TIME BRITISH OPEN CHAMPION

15
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:50,646
That's it.
Sit up straight, Sarah.

16
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,230
Lightly on the reins. There.

17
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,036
This is how we do it, Francis.

18
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:07,331
We work hard, and we bring
home the money.

19
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:16,465
Work hard.
Bring home the money.

20
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,043
Guillermo!
- Yes, sir!

21
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:53,461
Come on!

22
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:44,265
Francis, what in the world
are you doin'?

23
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,062
It's after midnight!

24
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,439
You're keepin' your
brother up. Go to bed.

25
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:57,070
Raymond, go to sleep.
No talkin'.

26
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:59,448
No noises. I mean it.

27
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:07,456
What have you got there,
Francis? Hmm?

28
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,752
Francis.

29
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,467
Can I see him, Father? Please?

30
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:17,969
What's he talking about?
See who?

31
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,054
Harry Vardon.

32
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,936
Any gentleman
who plays this game

33
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,147
is not a friend to you.

34
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:31,775
I know.

35
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:33,651
But he's the greatest ever.

36
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:37,363
Arthur, I don't see the harm in...
- Not another word.

37
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:41,450
The boy goes to school today.

38
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:43,534
That's the end of it.

39
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,338
Mrs. Darcy, mind the little one!

40
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:54,548
He'll try to climb those stairs.

41
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,969
Francis, leave your books.

42
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:01,346
I've got shoppin' to do.
You come with me now.

43
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:03,475
Father said
I had to go to school.

44
00:10:03,558 --> 00:10:05,142
You can miss school for one day.

45
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:08,145
Besides, I need help
with me packages. Come along.

46
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:31,880
What could be
causing such a fuss?

47
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,552
Go on. I'll find ya.

48
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,749
Oooh!

49
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,970
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

50
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,055
I'll now presume
upon your goodwill

51
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:22,265
and request the services
of a volunteer.

52
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,268
Anyone?

53
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,446
Oh!

54
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:35,949
Hello. What's your name?

55
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:38,784
Francis.
- Hello, Mr. Francis.

56
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:43,873
Now, do you know
what this is?

57
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:46,457
A brassie.

58
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,044
So it is.
Have a bash.

59
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:04,560
Go on.

60
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:11,150
That's all right, Francis.
Even in our darkest hour,

61
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:14,152
we must always remember,
you never despair.

62
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,657
Have you held
a live bird in your hands?

63
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:19,868
Not too hard to hurt her.

64
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:22,871
Just firm enough to stop it
from flying away.

65
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,960
Try it again.

66
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:38,679
Oooh!

67
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:39,848
Did you see that?

68
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,962
Hail the conquering hero!

69
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,379
Mr. Darwin.

70
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,051
Is this what I think it is?
- I'm not sure, Harry.

71
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:18,474
I received a summons
from Lord Northcliffe,

72
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:21,058
just as you did.
- Keep the change, mate.

73
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:23,686
He's waiting inside.
- Today's the day.

74
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,856
But, Harry, no professional
has ever been asked

75
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,150
to join a gentlemen's
golf club as a member.

76
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:31,152
First time for everything, Bernard.

77
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,987
Yes.
- Look at this place.

78
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,989
Why else would they
want you here?

79
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:37,575
He doesn't confide in me.
I only work for him.

80
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:43,164
Ten years ago,
I was clippin' hedges.

81
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,752
Mmm.

82
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:53,094
Marvelous.

83
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,681
Brilliantly done, Harry.

84
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,558
Thank you, sir.

85
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:03,271
I'd be honored if you
gentlemen would consider

86
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:06,481
adding it to your trophy case.
- A glittering addition.

87
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:09,569
We'd be pleased to keep it for you.
Wouldn't we, Neville?

88
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:11,277
Handsome.

89
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:15,074
But you might not get it back
without a tussle.

90
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:17,867
Don't plan on handing it back
myself without a fight.

91
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,160
Harry,
I'll come to the point.

92
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,371
We've had an opening at our club.

93
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:26,170
Lord Bullock chairs
the membership committee.

94
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,589
What does
your father do?

95
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:30,590
Uh, he's a gardener on Jersey, sir.

96
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:32,594
I'm told you're Church of Rome.

97
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:35,470
Mother's French?
- Yes, sir.

98
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:39,182
I believe we can work around it.

99
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:43,770
It's decided, then.
You're just the man for us.

100
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,573
Well, I don't know
what to say, sir.

101
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:56,576
Well, say yes.

102
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,994
We want you to work for us.
Decent wage.

103
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,666
You can run your own shop.

104
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,791
Lessons, of course.
Charge what you like for those.

105
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,795
You're the only man in England
who can set me right.

106
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,173
You'll have your work cut out.

107
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:11,174
I think it's drinks all around.

108
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,970
I'm told you'll work for us...

109
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:15,972
Golf is a game
played by gentlemen.

110
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:18,473
Not for the likes of you.
Played by gentlemen.

111
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:20,977
Run your own shop. Decent wage.

112
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,394
Run along, boy.

113
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:47,379
Francis. It's after midnight.

114
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:49,090
Just one more, Mother.

115
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:19,291
Mr. Hastings!

116
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:22,292
Ah, Master Francis.
- Sir.

117
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:24,794
We now lack but one essential

118
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:27,379
to complete the swift
appointment of our round:

119
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:30,301
Your clubs.
- My clubs, sir?

120
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:34,177
Caddies aren't allowed on the course.
If Mr. Campbell sees me out there...

121
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:38,182
You let me worry about Campbell.
Go. Get those clubs.

122
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,392
You go, boy.
Get those clubs.

123
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,979
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

124
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,875
Well struck, lad.
- Thank you, sir.

125
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,394
What did you shoot?

126
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:00,395
Uh, an 81, sir.

127
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,481
What did you take on 15?

128
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:03,982
A nine, sir.

129
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,983
So you shot an 81
first time around

130
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,988
on the toughest golf course
in New England?

131
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:12,075
With a nine?
- Well, I... I think I...

132
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:15,787
I saw you standing there, knowing
caddies aren't supposed to play...

133
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:17,705
Go on.

134
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:21,083
I... I think I got
a little nervous, sir.

135
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,670
We needed to see how
you handled yourself.

136
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,671
Handled myself?

137
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:29,303
National Amateur Championship's
here next month.

138
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:34,890
Are you saying that I can...

139
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:36,893
What do I have to do?

140
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:39,979
You have to play in the qualifier.
- That's the easy part.

141
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:42,606
You have to be approved
by the executive committee.

142
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,484
You're a caddie here?

143
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,695
Yes, sir.
For ten years.

144
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:50,699
I recently resigned to preserve
my status as an amateur.

145
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:53,367
What, no plans
to turn professional?

146
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:56,287
Uh, no, sir. I plan
to have a career in business.

147
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,788
Oh, business?
- Yes.

148
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,499
What sort of business?

149
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:02,587
Howard, we need...

150
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,298
Sorry. Carry on.

151
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,008
What's your home club?
I don't see it here.

152
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,011
They have to sponsor you.

153
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:11,471
My home club?

154
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:16,601
I'm between clubs at the moment.
- Look, see here.

155
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:18,602
you may have qualified
as a player,

156
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:21,773
but this just isn't the sort
of thing that caddies do.

157
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:24,276
You're a caddie?

158
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,778
Yes, sir, I was.

159
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:29,279
Caddies don't play in the Amateur.
It's not for your kind.

160
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,075
Members only.

161
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,077
We need to discuss the opening
on the greens committee.

162
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:35,995
I'm sorry.
But there must be a way

163
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,584
for somebody who's not
a member to compete.

164
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,501
Not this year.

165
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:49,094
As if he could afford
the $50 entrance fee.

166
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:53,307
Excuse me. Sir...

167
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,892
...if I were to pay the $50,
would I need to belong to a club?

168
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:58,103
Technically, no.

169
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:05,902
You would still need a club member
in good standing to sponsor you, and...

170
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:08,990
And... that would be me.

171
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:12,994
Fifty dollars to play golf.

172
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,414
I'll pay back every penny
from my earnings.

173
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:18,709
Is this how I failed you?
Is that all you've learned from me?

174
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,710
No, sir.
But it's just a game.

175
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,879
A game?

176
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:27,009
A game doesn't give a man what he
needs to make a life, feed his family. - Yes

177
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,011
But if I win,
great things could happen.

178
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,096
Nothing will happen.

179
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,474
They'll use you
for their own amusement.

180
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,603
I can do this. This is
something I'm good at.

181
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,606
What if you do?

182
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,691
What will you get for your $50?

183
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:48,617
I had dreams too, Francis.

184
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:51,075
No matter what you do,

185
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:53,412
they'll never let you
cross that street.

186
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,791
All I want is a chance.

187
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:05,716
OK.

188
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:09,303
OK, we make a bargain.

189
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:13,391
You promise me if you lose,
no more golf.

190
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,975
You give up this fool's game.

191
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:17,810
You finish your schooling,
you learn a trade,

192
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:21,316
and you bring home
an honest wage.

193
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:24,611
If I don't qualify?

194
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:27,281
Yes, I promise.

195
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:00,108
It's the English edition.
It's not even in print here yet.

196
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:02,987
Harry Vardon.

197
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:06,906
Thank you.

198
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:09,200
Read it, study it.

199
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:12,619
You'll need a 78 to qualify.

200
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,288
Stiffer competition.

201
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,792
These are the best
amateurs in the country.

202
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:19,793
Do you think I'm ready?

203
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:22,714
I don't know, and neither
will you until you're in it.

204
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:25,717
There's golf, and there's
championship golf.

205
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,892
Keep it for me.
I'm going to the party.

206
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,398
They said all the players
are invited.

207
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,612
What's it like in there?

208
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,405
I couldn't tell you.
I'm not allowed inside.

209
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,790
Do me a favor, would you?

210
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,501
Hi.

211
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:42,090
Hi. This boy I used to see
before I left for college is after me.

212
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,094
Pretend you asked me to dance.
- There you are, you peach.

213
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,388
You know, you can't
avoid me all evening.

214
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:51,014
I... I said a dance, Phillip.

215
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,602
Not this one.

216
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:55,313
I promised this one to...
- Francis Ouimet.

217
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:58,398
Do I know your family?
- I don't know.

218
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:00,402
Phillip Wainwright?
- Wainwright?

219
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:02,403
Oh, yes. Wainwrights,
good people.

220
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:03,697
Wainwrights.

221
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:11,287
Well, the evening's young.
She'll catch up with you.

222
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:19,087
You're a real sport for helping.

223
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:20,505
It's no trouble.

224
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:27,014
I had the craziest day.

225
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:31,310
I take a train from Philadelphia,
my bags end up in Baltimore.

226
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:34,103
My tux is in the bags
in Baltimore.

227
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:37,814
I'm wearing the houseman's suit.

228
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:42,902
I think you look just fine.

229
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,904
You too.

230
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,994
Is he gone?

231
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,291
No, he's still watching.

232
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,000
Shall we dance?

233
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,892
You said you were
going to college?

234
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:14,104
Smith. First semester.

235
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:15,522
Oh.

236
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:18,023
Where are you going?

237
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,027
To college?

238
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:21,906
Oh, uh, um,

239
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,200
I'm taking the year off
to consider my options.

240
00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:28,496
I think that's so wise.

241
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:30,330
Perhaps you'll go to Europe.

242
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:33,625
Perhaps I will.
'Cause I have family in France.

243
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:38,712
I'm sorry. What did you
say your name was again?

244
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:41,299
Francis. Ouimet.

245
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:46,011
Oh, look!
There's my brother!

246
00:25:50,893 --> 00:25:54,105
Freddie, you must know Francis.
- Freddie.

247
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:57,526
Caddie Boy.

248
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,611
Freddie, you're such a kidder.

249
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:04,323
Dad, Mother, this is Francis Ouimet.

250
00:26:04,408 --> 00:26:06,034
How do you do?

251
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:07,995
That's a beautiful dress.

252
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:10,123
Francis is playing
in the tournament.

253
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:12,000
Yes, yes, I know.

254
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,713
Well, you boys chat.
Mother and I will be right back.

255
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,930
Swell girl, your daughter.

256
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:31,103
Young man, you may
have been invited,

257
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:33,607
but don't get the idea
that you belong here.

258
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,209
There are only
two types of player:

259
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:58,423
Those who keep their nerves
in control and win championships,

260
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:00,216
and those who do not.

261
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:36,109
Five or less,
and you make the cut.

262
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:39,613
Eighteen? I can make
five here in my sleep.

263
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,044
That's the one.

264
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:54,942
Congratulations.

265
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,610
That's too bad, Caddie Boy.

266
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:58,823
You could caddie for me
in the tournament.

267
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,408
You're available, right?

268
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,247
Congratulations, son.
Well played.

269
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,726
Empire, Harry.

270
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,730
The sun never sets on us,
all that rubbish.

271
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:53,026
Consider the glory that was Greece
of Alexander the Great.

272
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,654
Now you can't even
find it on a map.

273
00:31:56,821 --> 00:31:59,741
Greece
introduced sport to the world,

274
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,620
pure expression
of their superiority.

275
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:05,038
We've trodden that same road.

276
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:08,543
Football, cricket, rugby, golf.

277
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:12,128
All the major championships
remain in British hands.

278
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:13,547
Save one.

279
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:17,344
What are you proposing?

280
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,055
The U.S. Open.

281
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:23,226
You won it before.

282
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:25,728
I want you to mount
a new campaign

283
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:27,646
to do to the Americans

284
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,649
what Alexander
did to the Persians.

285
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:33,526
Lay waste to 'em.

286
00:32:35,238 --> 00:32:37,448
My papers get exclusive coverage.

287
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:40,951
Bernard here comes along
to chronicle your conquest.

288
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:42,619
It's our game, man.

289
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:46,539
Win their Open and
bring back that trophy.

290
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:50,339
You pocket
your winnings, of course.

291
00:32:50,422 --> 00:32:51,839
Hmm.

292
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:55,343
Wouldn't pay for the crossing, sir.
- All expenses paid.

293
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:58,721
As part of an exhibition tour,
all sponsors arranged.

294
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:00,556
Does that cover it?

295
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:05,935
Yep. That'd do it.

296
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,522
And I hear there's talk

297
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:10,149
of an honorary
membership at the club.

298
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:11,941
This would clinch it.

299
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:15,238
And I daresay His Majesty
might want to show his gratitude

300
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:17,323
to England's greatest sportsman.

301
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:20,118
Harry Vardon,
Order of the British Empire.

302
00:33:20,243 --> 00:33:22,955
Has a nice ring to it.

303
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:30,046
I'll need a partner.
Somebody to share the workload with.

304
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:32,048
My thoughts exactly.

305
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:35,051
Wilfred here is your man.
Top amateur in the British Isles.

306
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:36,719
Delighted, old chap.

307
00:33:36,845 --> 00:33:38,846
Jolly good wheeze, what?

308
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,058
Giving the Yanks
a thorough thrashing.

309
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:48,856
I had someone else in mind.

310
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:53,652
Ted Ray?

311
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:55,154
Christ, he's a Visigoth.

312
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,656
No, he's a Jerseyman.

313
00:33:57,948 --> 00:33:59,245
'Scuse me.

314
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:13,633
All bets off!

315
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:25,062
Come on!
- Come on!

316
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,825
Ha ha ha ha ha!

317
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,748
Ted!
- Harry!

318
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,956
Hey! Look at you!

319
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,545
What's this, another night out
with your ruling class masters?

320
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,254
Ted Ray, Lord Northcliffe.

321
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,924
Lord Northcliffe?
The honor is entirely mine.

322
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:57,054
Mmm!

323
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,223
What brings you down
this way, Harry?

324
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:32,049
Can you believe they moved
the Open back three months

325
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,927
just so one guy can play in it?

326
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,846
Well, he's Harry Vardon,

327
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,763
The Stylist, The Greyhound.

328
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:39,848
I don't care if he's
the man in the moon.

329
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:42,142
They wouldn't do that
for an American.

330
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,230
Ask Francis.
He used to play.

331
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,358
You did?
- No, not really.

332
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:50,861
Ah, he's being modest.

333
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:53,029
He used to be good
before he gave it up

334
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:55,950
for the glamour of retail.
Isn't that right, Francis?

335
00:35:58,245 --> 00:35:59,538
Francis!

336
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:02,038
Francis!

337
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:16,974
Oh, well.
It was glorious.

338
00:38:17,058 --> 00:38:19,560
Wasn't it glorious?
- Yes, it was.

339
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,063
Have you ever heard
such a voice?

340
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:28,360
It was like the... the music
was coming through her

341
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:30,655
from someplace else.

342
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:34,448
That's the feeling
I've always wanted...

343
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,166
Francis, for what? Hmm?

344
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:58,477
There he is.
Francis! Come here.

345
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,768
Meet Robert Watson,

346
00:38:59,852 --> 00:39:02,648
president of the
United States Golf Association.

347
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:06,275
Francis, pleasure.

348
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,153
Well, the pleasure's mine, sir.

349
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:10,740
Uh, let me have a salesman
show you our equipment.

350
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:14,078
It's the best selection in Boston.
- He's not here to buy clubs.

351
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,162
I hear you live in Brookline,
not far from the country club.

352
00:39:17,246 --> 00:39:18,539
Right across the street.

353
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:22,167
We're holding our Open Championship
there in two weeks.

354
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:25,171
Your name came up.
- My name, sir?

355
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,673
I'm looking to add
a local amateur to the field.

356
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,343
Harry Vardon's playing.
And Ted Ray.

357
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,060
Mr. Watson, thank you,
but I can't accept.

358
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,564
Why not?
- I'm awfully busy here.

359
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:46,151
And, uh, I don't
play golf anymore.

360
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:50,280
How old are you, Francis?
- I'm 20, sir.

361
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:54,244
Awfully young to be giving up
on your dreams, aren't you?

362
00:39:54,244 --> 00:39:56,662
I just have different ones now,
that's all.

363
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:00,167
I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.

364
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,752
There's no need
to explain, Francis.

365
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:05,463
All the best.

366
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:08,572
That swing looks familiar.

367
00:41:08,656 --> 00:41:09,948
Hey!

368
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:11,575
What are you doing here?

369
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:14,163
Father's taking me out
for our annual round.

370
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:16,873
My brother said that
you were working here.

371
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:20,166
Your brother. I've seen him
in here a couple times.

372
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:23,671
I was hoping you could
sell me some equipment.

373
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:26,465
I'm not actually the salesman.

374
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,470
Still considering your options?

375
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,054
Yeah.

376
00:41:35,684 --> 00:41:37,978
I'll go get you a salesman.

377
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:03,672
All right.

378
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:12,389
Harry Vardon.

379
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:15,266
The Stylist.
Practice round.

380
00:42:21,983 --> 00:42:25,863
We're expecting a big turnout, so it's
important we have marshals here...

381
00:42:25,988 --> 00:42:27,364
Mr. Watson.
Francis Ouimet.

382
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:29,992
Can I speak to you, sir?
- What is it?

383
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:32,786
If that offer is still good,
I'd love to take you up on it.

384
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,453
We have to think about that.

385
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:37,585
I'm not asking for favors...
- Can you give us a moment?

386
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,253
What about Grove Street?

387
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:54,683
Meet me here, sunup.

388
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:57,480
You've got some work to do.

389
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:57,459
Billy, where do we stand?

390
00:43:57,585 --> 00:43:59,296
Cut line's 76.

391
00:43:59,379 --> 00:44:01,380
Six holes to
make up four shots.

392
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:35,958
What is it?
What's wrong?

393
00:44:36,082 --> 00:44:38,961
You just made six straight birdies.
- I did?

394
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:42,089
Congratulations, lad.
You're in the Open.

395
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:52,057
Gentlemen?

396
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:56,565
I want to welcome you all,
professionals and amateurs alike,

397
00:44:56,689 --> 00:44:59,777
to the 18th United States
Open Championship.

398
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:08,493
Four rounds of golf to be played
over the next two days

399
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:11,080
to identify the best
player in the world.

400
00:45:11,163 --> 00:45:13,163
Let's give a special welcome

401
00:45:13,288 --> 00:45:16,668
to the British Amateur Champion,
Mr. Wilfred Reid...

402
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,089
...and our famous
professional visitors,

403
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:22,964
Harry Vardon and Ted Ray.

404
00:45:27,178 --> 00:45:30,975
I'll yield the floor
to our defending champion,

405
00:45:31,101 --> 00:45:34,188
a professional from Philadelphia,
John McDermott.

406
00:45:44,363 --> 00:45:46,783
If you read the papers,
there's a lot of talk

407
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:51,078
about the great English champions
sailing over here to play in our Open.

408
00:45:51,163 --> 00:45:53,289
As the only born American
to win this cup,

409
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:55,793
I'd like to say
to you boys, welcome.

410
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:58,169
We're happy to have you.
- Hear, hear.

411
00:45:58,293 --> 00:46:00,171
We know Harry Vardon
was winning Opens

412
00:46:00,296 --> 00:46:02,590
back when most of us
were learning our ABC's.

413
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,264
He's a genius in
the history of our game.

414
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,270
Mr. Vardon, I know you won
this baby once before.

415
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,895
I see your name here.

416
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:16,982
It's a long time ago,
by the look of it.

417
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,863
Well, we hope you boys
have a nice time here in Boston.

418
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,868
Personally, I don't think you will.

419
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,870
I don't care if you whupped us
the last six weeks.

420
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:33,665
I'm tired of people saying all you
have to do to win is show up!

421
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,669
This time you're not
taking our damn cup back!

422
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,178
Might just have
to kill that one.

423
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,305
Good luck, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

424
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,890
Billy.

425
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,101
See you first thing
tomorrow morning?

426
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:53,186
I can't.
- Well, why not?

427
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:56,397
This English fella offered me
20 bucks, 50 if he wins.

428
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:01,905
Well, I can't give you
anything like that.

429
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:04,990
I'm sorry, Francis.
I've got two kids at home.

430
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:13,875
Mr. Campbell?
I just lost my caddie.

431
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:15,503
Do you know somebody?

432
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:18,798
Sorry, all the lads are taken.
- What am I supposed to do?

433
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,176
Hitch up your knickers.
You think Vardon and Ray

434
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:23,594
will take pity because you
carry your own bag?

435
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:26,473
This is the Open.
Every man for himself.

436
00:47:29,475 --> 00:47:30,892
What am I doing here?

437
00:47:34,272 --> 00:47:35,774
Hey, Francis!

438
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:37,607
Jack! What are you doin' here?

439
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,778
Me and Eddie hooked school
to come watch the practice round.

440
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:43,072
Are you still caddying
out at Franklin Park?

441
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:44,989
That's right.
- Any chance you can

442
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:46,700
carry for me tomorrow?

443
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:48,496
In the Open?
- Yeah.

444
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,709
Well, what happened to your guy?

445
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:54,710
He got a better offer.

446
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:56,796
Then that guy's
a big, fat jerk! What?

447
00:47:58,005 --> 00:47:59,673
Jack, if you're gonna do this,

448
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:02,509
you gotta be here
tomorrow at 7:30 sharp.

449
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:03,678
Do it!

450
00:48:03,803 --> 00:48:05,887
Can Eddie come too?

451
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:07,891
Jack, I can't change the rules.

452
00:48:07,974 --> 00:48:10,186
You're only allowed
one man on the bag.

453
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,900
Maybe he could walk
with us and keep score.

454
00:48:18,985 --> 00:48:20,778
We'll figure it out.

455
00:48:20,903 --> 00:48:23,700
Is that OK with you?
- Sure.

456
00:48:23,783 --> 00:48:25,702
Francis, you got yourself a deal.

457
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,580
That's great, Jack.
That's great.

458
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,873
I'll see ya, Eddie.

459
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:35,003
I'll get it, Henry!

460
00:48:38,298 --> 00:48:39,798
And what do you want?

461
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:42,303
I was hopin' to speak
to Sarah. Is she here?

462
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,597
She left for college.

463
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,475
When, today?
- Yeah.

464
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:51,393
Give her a message for me.

465
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,481
Who was that, Freddie?

466
00:48:55,606 --> 00:48:58,488
Ah, it was... it was no one.
It was a peddler.

467
00:48:58,612 --> 00:49:01,114
Did you hear about the caddie
playing in the Open?

468
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:04,409
It should never have happened.
Reflects badly on all concerned.

469
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:06,411
I say, if he wants
to go out and play

470
00:49:06,494 --> 00:49:09,081
and make a fool of himself again,
so much the better.

471
00:49:09,205 --> 00:49:12,209
Who are you talking about?
- It's a club matter.

472
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:13,794
Caddie Boy.

473
00:49:13,877 --> 00:49:15,295
Ouimet.

474
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:19,176
Insists he's an amateur.
What is the world coming to?

475
00:49:19,176 --> 00:49:22,593
More bisque, sir?
- Thank you, Henry.

476
00:49:22,678 --> 00:49:26,015
And what kind of pie does
Audrey have for us tonight?

477
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:29,393
Huckleberry, sir.
- Ah. Splendid.

478
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:41,698
Did you think you could
keep it from me?

479
00:49:43,282 --> 00:49:44,411
I didn't try to.

480
00:49:44,494 --> 00:49:47,912
Your name is in the newspaper,
sneaking around behind my back.

481
00:49:47,912 --> 00:49:49,497
No, no, no, Father...

482
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:51,710
You're going to stop this now.

483
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:55,503
A man knows his place
and makes his peace with it.

484
00:49:55,586 --> 00:49:58,089
I can't talk about this.
- Then you listen.

485
00:49:59,217 --> 00:50:00,510
This is for your own good.

486
00:50:00,593 --> 00:50:02,385
I am trying to protect you.

487
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:04,012
Protect me from what?

488
00:50:04,095 --> 00:50:08,101
Francis, those men don't have
to earn a place in this world.

489
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:09,687
It's given to them.

490
00:50:09,812 --> 00:50:12,690
We're not those kind of people.

491
00:50:12,814 --> 00:50:15,984
Now, you go tell them
that you can't do this.

492
00:50:15,984 --> 00:50:17,402
It's a mistake.

493
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,617
I won't do that.

494
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:28,415
You gave me your word.

495
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:32,712
You gave me your word.

496
00:50:32,794 --> 00:50:34,713
I can't quit now. I'm sorry.

497
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:41,095
Then so help me,
when this is over,

498
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:44,390
you find somewhere else to live.

499
00:50:58,112 --> 00:50:59,489
Fine.

500
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:23,890
Make sure these people
get the etiquette guide.

501
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,601
Most of them have never been
on a golf course before.

502
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,311
God help us.

503
00:51:29,688 --> 00:51:30,896
Mr. Ouimet!

504
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,982
Mr. Ouimet!

505
00:51:36,986 --> 00:51:38,822
Eddie!

506
00:51:38,904 --> 00:51:40,908
Where's Jack?
I tee off in ten minutes.

507
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,119
Truant officer caught him.
He's in school.

508
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:46,288
Why aren't you with him?
- Come on! This is the U.S. Open.

509
00:51:46,413 --> 00:51:47,996
Thanks for coming to tell me.

510
00:51:48,123 --> 00:51:50,920
Mr. Ouimet,
I can caddie for you.

511
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:53,798
Eddie, my bag
is as big as you are.

512
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:55,215
But I can do it!

513
00:51:55,298 --> 00:51:58,011
I carry for lots of fellas
at Franklin Park. Ask 'em.

514
00:51:58,094 --> 00:52:00,303
I came to make good
on what Jack promised.

515
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:04,015
I hooked school, took three
streetcars and I am big enough!

516
00:52:04,015 --> 00:52:06,517
I'm in 5th grade,
and I want to caddie for you!

517
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,395
Calm down for a second.

518
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,899
How about this? I'll carry my bag,
and you walk next to me.

519
00:52:11,899 --> 00:52:13,691
No, Mr. Ouimet!
- Call me Francis.

520
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:15,692
I can do it, Mr. Ouimet.
- Francis.

521
00:52:15,818 --> 00:52:17,903
I know your game.
I've seen you play.

522
00:52:17,988 --> 00:52:20,406
I can carry that bag!
- All right. All right.

523
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:24,787
You can caddie for me. OK? But you're
gonna have to call me Francis.

524
00:52:24,913 --> 00:52:27,498
OK, Francis.
- All right.

525
00:52:32,005 --> 00:52:34,088
You got a problem?

526
00:52:34,213 --> 00:52:36,506
This is
the 9:45 tee time.

527
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:39,011
The professional from
Cattawaukee Golf Club,

528
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:40,596
Albert Murray.

529
00:52:46,018 --> 00:52:47,811
From Brookline, Massachusetts,

530
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:50,397
amateur Mr. Francis Ouimet.

531
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,124
Whatever you decide, Francis,

532
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:48,418
keep your head down
and I'll watch the ball.

533
00:53:48,502 --> 00:53:50,210
We're gonna par this hole.

534
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:14,696
That's the stuff.
One shot at a time.

535
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,922
One putt, we'll get that par.

536
00:54:32,922 --> 00:54:34,717
Nice and steady now.

537
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,802
Make it roll,
it'll seek the hole.

538
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,032
Easy peazy, lemon squeezy.

539
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:52,424
He's not supposed to miss those.

540
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:53,799
Third one this morning.

541
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:56,636
What the devil's wrong with him?

542
00:55:57,638 --> 00:55:59,014
I'm sure I don't know, sir.

543
00:56:45,939 --> 00:56:48,816
It's in the bleedin' trees,
you great bunch o' ninnies.

544
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:52,234
Ted! Rotten luck, old boy!

545
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:56,032
Just one of those days, what?
- Still a lot of golf to play yet!

546
00:56:57,699 --> 00:56:59,538
Toffee-nosed git.

547
00:57:09,214 --> 00:57:11,840
There are only
two types of player:

548
00:57:11,924 --> 00:57:15,135
Those who keep their nerves in
control and win championships,

549
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:16,638
and those who do not.

550
00:57:39,913 --> 00:57:44,042
Hey, Francis,
who's that big, fat guy?

551
00:57:45,627 --> 00:57:48,714
Oh, my gosh.
It's President Taft.

552
00:57:48,714 --> 00:57:51,425
Get out!
President Taft?

553
00:57:51,507 --> 00:57:54,010
The United States
President Taft?

554
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:57,223
You ever seen a president before?
- First time.

555
00:57:57,305 --> 00:57:59,641
Hey! How you doin' there,
Mr. President?

556
00:58:03,228 --> 00:58:06,816
Francis! Did you just
birdie your last hole?

557
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,610
I guess I did, Frank.

558
00:58:08,737 --> 00:58:11,237
Holy smokes, Francis,
you're tied with Vardon.

559
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,614
You're in second place.
- I am?

560
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:17,537
President Taft is talking
about you. President Taft.

561
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:18,912
Isn't it incredible?

562
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,040
OK, we're working here, buddy.

563
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:22,541
Don't listen to him.

564
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,335
We play our game, let those
guys worry about theirs.

565
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,631
I'm tied...

566
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:42,814
You're tied
with Vardon. You're in second place.

567
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:54,616
Oh, God.

568
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:33,825
Thanks for nothin'.

569
00:59:59,935 --> 01:00:02,021
We gotta settle down now, Francis.

570
01:00:02,021 --> 01:00:04,150
Oh, yeah?
How are we gonna do that?

571
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:07,652
You're just gonna
have to play better.

572
01:00:09,611 --> 01:00:11,114
Keep your head down.

573
01:00:34,014 --> 01:00:35,015
Whew.

574
01:00:52,824 --> 01:00:54,327
All right, gimme the mashie.

575
01:00:54,452 --> 01:00:56,120
You're not gonna
reach with that.

576
01:00:56,245 --> 01:00:57,537
If he can, I can.

577
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:26,526
In round two,
Harry Vardon's pulled even

578
01:01:26,653 --> 01:01:29,153
with the defending champion,
John McDermott,

579
01:01:29,238 --> 01:01:33,827
but Mr. Wilfred Reid
is matching him shot for shot.

580
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:35,955
After a poor showing
this morning,

581
01:01:36,037 --> 01:01:38,958
Ted Ray's stalking the grounds
like a mad brute.

582
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,625
He... Mad brute.

583
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,630
He may yet have something
to say about this championship.

584
01:01:55,725 --> 01:01:57,352
Quiet.

585
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:11,826
Go, go, go, go!

586
01:02:11,951 --> 01:02:12,953
Get in there.

587
01:02:18,959 --> 01:02:20,250
Blimey.

588
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:23,045
They're easily entertained.

589
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:24,838
I'm counting on you, old boy,

590
01:02:24,922 --> 01:02:27,425
if Vardon and that great ape
of his can't deliver.

591
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:29,553
Quite. All for England.

592
01:02:29,635 --> 01:02:32,346
Save that patriotic gibberish
for the newspapers.

593
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:35,223
The prime minister has promised me
a seat in his cabinet

594
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:36,725
if I bring back this trophy.

595
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:39,854
And rest assured, Wilfred,
you will be remembered.

596
01:02:41,438 --> 01:02:43,148
Ah. Bravo, Harry.

597
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:44,944
You're tied with me for the lead.

598
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:48,948
Very well played, sir.
- All for King and country, what?

599
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,327
Wilfred played splendidly,
more than can be said for your man Ray.

600
01:02:52,451 --> 01:02:53,746
Wild as a Hottentot.

601
01:02:53,294 --> 01:02:56,213
After his appalling first round,
he won't survive the cut.

602
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,803
What on earth are they
going on about?

603
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:03,388
Ted Ray's just broken
the course scoring record.

604
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:08,811
By Jove,
Ray's tied for second!

605
01:03:19,031 --> 01:03:22,118
Mr. Ouimet?
One question, sir!

606
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,119
Francis!

607
01:03:24,202 --> 01:03:26,996
Hey! I thought you'd
gone back to college!

608
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:30,207
I thought you quit playing!
- I guess I changed my mind, huh?

609
01:03:30,292 --> 01:03:32,001
That's wonderful!
- Yeah.

610
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:34,504
It's great to see you.
Can you come tomorrow?

611
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:37,924
I have to leave tomorrow!
- Come back tomorrow!

612
01:03:44,723 --> 01:03:46,015
Are you his caddie?

613
01:03:48,101 --> 01:03:50,228
Give this to him, would you?

614
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:54,693
For luck.

615
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,327
Dames. Who needs 'em?

616
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:23,223
Fine play today, Mr. Ouimet.

617
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:25,807
Thank you, sir. You too.

618
01:04:28,104 --> 01:04:29,814
It's mostly dumb luck, though.

619
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:34,401
On my part.
Not on your part.

620
01:04:34,526 --> 01:04:36,530
You don't need luck.
I need luck.

621
01:04:40,032 --> 01:04:41,325
Well, good luck, then.

622
01:04:42,825 --> 01:04:43,826
Thank you, sir.

623
01:04:52,294 --> 01:04:55,799
I cleaned 'em good.
Wiped the grips too.

624
01:04:57,801 --> 01:04:59,509
You did just fine
out there today.

625
01:04:59,592 --> 01:05:01,011
You too, Francis.

626
01:05:01,094 --> 01:05:03,807
You gonna be able to skip
school again tomorrow?

627
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:05,519
Let 'em try and stop me.

628
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:08,229
All right,
well, you get home safe.

629
01:05:08,312 --> 01:05:10,106
Hey, don't you worry about me.

630
01:05:10,231 --> 01:05:11,733
I'll meet you right here.

631
01:05:11,816 --> 01:05:13,400
Early bird gets the worm.

632
01:05:13,525 --> 01:05:14,610
Deal.

633
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:39,012
All I can say, ladies,
is that when the day began,

634
01:05:39,138 --> 01:05:41,305
I scarcely imagined
that I'd find myself

635
01:05:41,431 --> 01:05:44,226
tied for the lead with
the immortal Harry Vardon,

636
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:47,812
and two strokes ahead of
the ever-so-capable Ted Ray.

637
01:05:47,936 --> 01:05:51,026
Ah. Speak of the devil,
and up he pops.

638
01:05:51,108 --> 01:05:53,819
Excuse me, ladies.
I'll be with you presently.

639
01:05:58,114 --> 01:06:01,033
I simply adore Americans.

640
01:06:01,116 --> 01:06:05,204
The exuberance,
such charming naivete.

641
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,625
How do you find them, Ted?

642
01:06:07,707 --> 01:06:10,501
I should imagine
you feel right at home.

643
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:14,340
They clasp all manner of the huddled,
yearning masses to their bosoms.

644
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,218
Even the lowly golf professional.

645
01:06:17,302 --> 01:06:19,428
You know, I can foresee a day,

646
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:22,430
given their democratic standards,

647
01:06:22,515 --> 01:06:25,520
when they invite your kind
into their clubhouses.

648
01:06:25,603 --> 01:06:27,729
Well,
how could they resist?

649
01:06:27,813 --> 01:06:30,941
Two poor lads from Jersey,
up from nothing.

650
01:06:31,024 --> 01:06:33,903
Working-class heroes
to the great unwashed.

651
01:06:34,028 --> 01:06:36,112
When all Jersey's ever given us

652
01:06:36,237 --> 01:06:38,322
are potatoes and dairy cows...

653
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:43,828
Don't look over there.

654
01:06:43,911 --> 01:06:47,042
Sorry, Harry.
I couldn't contain myself.

655
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:48,710
Neither could he.

656
01:06:48,835 --> 01:06:51,630
He shouldn't have
brought Jersey into it.

657
01:06:57,929 --> 01:07:01,139
My God. My nose.

658
01:07:05,935 --> 01:07:07,437
Do I look all right?

659
01:07:08,729 --> 01:07:11,108
Quite frankly, Mr. Reid,
it's an improvement.

660
01:07:15,027 --> 01:07:18,406
So, did you really
see the President?

661
01:07:18,531 --> 01:07:19,824
He waved at me.

662
01:07:19,906 --> 01:07:20,829
No.

663
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:24,039
Yes, he did. President Taft.
- Can you believe Francis?

664
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,124
Why don't I sleep
downstairs tonight?

665
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:27,835
No. You sleep upstairs.

666
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:30,921
You'll need your sleep for tomorrow.
- I'm OK.

667
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,631
Oh! Arthur.

668
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:40,723
So, they call you Mr. Ouimet.

669
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:44,228
The others,
it just says their names.

670
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,315
Well, Father,
they're professionals.

671
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:50,233
I'm an amateur.

672
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:51,609
Let's have some dessert.

673
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,819
No, wait, wait. Sit, sit.

674
01:07:55,407 --> 01:07:57,409
They're all talking
about you now.

675
01:08:01,037 --> 01:08:04,333
It say here that if you win,
you get no money.

676
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:07,626
The others make money,
you get nothing.

677
01:08:07,711 --> 01:08:09,213
What does that prove?

678
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,131
What does that prove?

679
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:18,221
They don't even pay you!
What kind of work is that?

680
01:08:18,346 --> 01:08:19,638
Arthur.
- What?

681
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:21,723
I'll fix you a plate.

682
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,317
Come on, you! Pull!

683
01:09:27,627 --> 01:09:28,711
Morning, Harry.

684
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:31,924
Dreadful English weather.

685
01:09:35,135 --> 01:09:37,430
How'd you sleep?
- Like a baby.

686
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:40,516
Woke up every two hours and cried.

687
01:09:55,616 --> 01:09:57,034
Hey, Francis!

688
01:09:57,117 --> 01:10:00,038
I had a dream last night
that you shot a 72!

689
01:10:00,121 --> 01:10:02,539
Yeah? It won't be easy
in a nor'easter.

690
01:10:02,622 --> 01:10:05,541
You've played this course
in weather like this.

691
01:10:05,627 --> 01:10:07,419
You're right.
It's a good day for a 72.

692
01:10:07,544 --> 01:10:09,838
Okeydokey,
pipe and smokey.

693
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:44,123
If the Brits beat us, they'll say
it was a fluke I ever won it.

694
01:10:44,123 --> 01:10:47,126
They'll say it's their game,
and we're not good enough.

695
01:10:47,126 --> 01:10:48,922
This is our Open.

696
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:19,038
Yes. Marvelous.

697
01:13:28,342 --> 01:13:31,927
Ouimet. Ouimet.
O- U-I-M-E-T.

698
01:13:32,052 --> 01:13:35,348
He's only one stroke behind Vardon
and Ray after three rounds.

699
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:39,226
Move it!
Put your backs into it now!

700
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:44,525
Go a little deeper there!
There we go.

701
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,241
Not here. Over there.

702
01:13:52,366 --> 01:13:54,451
Watch that end go through!

703
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:57,163
And move on down!
- Yes, sir!

704
01:14:31,866 --> 01:14:33,035
Thank you.

705
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,253
Ray needs that putt
for the lead.

706
01:14:42,462 --> 01:14:44,838
I don't want to hear how
anyone else is doing.

707
01:14:44,838 --> 01:14:47,757
We play our own game.

708
01:14:49,636 --> 01:14:50,638
Where do we stand?

709
01:14:50,763 --> 01:14:54,641
You'd still have to par the last
five holes to tie Ted for the lead.

710
01:14:54,766 --> 01:14:56,434
Dreadful conditions, Harry.

711
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,354
No one would blame you
if you came...

712
01:14:58,354 --> 01:14:59,564
Thank you, Bernard.

713
01:16:50,637 --> 01:16:52,974
He's done for in there.

714
01:16:53,056 --> 01:16:55,769
No chance he catches him now.

715
01:17:30,347 --> 01:17:31,972
Whoa!

716
01:17:39,938 --> 01:17:42,068
What's got into you, old thing?

717
01:17:42,151 --> 01:17:44,279
You had to go
and get me angry.

718
01:17:44,362 --> 01:17:46,238
Oh, yes. My mistake.

719
01:17:46,363 --> 01:17:48,239
When I par this one,

720
01:17:48,367 --> 01:17:50,243
we'll have to go at it
again tomorrow.

721
01:17:50,243 --> 01:17:52,244
A playoff? What a bother.

722
01:17:52,369 --> 01:17:54,747
Yes, but there it is.

723
01:17:54,872 --> 01:17:57,042
Never seen you smoke
on the job before.

724
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:59,252
Should've started
four holes earlier.

725
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:54,477
Ah, all square again.

726
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:57,146
Not a chance
this stripling bears up.

727
01:18:58,482 --> 01:18:59,984
Probably not.

728
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,472
Let 'em look.

729
01:19:29,558 --> 01:19:31,977
We're tied, and you're
the one still playing.

730
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:50,577
Might as well get out of this
beastly New England weather

731
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,663
and raise a glass
to British victory.

732
01:19:52,747 --> 01:19:55,582
What's that carrying
his bag, a Pygmy?

733
01:20:06,388 --> 01:20:09,348
We need two strokes.
One here, one at the 16th...

734
01:20:09,473 --> 01:20:12,768
Francis, don't think so much.
You can't play 'em all at once.

735
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,354
You gotta take 'em
one at a time.

736
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:17,357
One at a time, two down.
Two down, six to play.

737
01:20:17,481 --> 01:20:19,484
I can get one here
and another on 16.

738
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:21,778
That girl wanted me
to give you this.

739
01:20:21,778 --> 01:20:24,280
What girl?
- Sarah.

740
01:20:24,363 --> 01:20:25,948
Sarah gave you this?

741
01:20:26,074 --> 01:20:28,869
Just put it on.
Don't get all sloppy over it.

742
01:20:38,462 --> 01:20:40,464
To England.

743
01:20:42,174 --> 01:20:44,551
What the hell was that?

744
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:46,679
It's not over yet.

745
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:15,167
Well, well.
Look who's back.

746
01:21:43,657 --> 01:21:45,868
Nice.
- Nice shot!

747
01:21:47,661 --> 01:21:50,457
Let us through.
It's Ouimet's mother.

748
01:21:58,255 --> 01:21:59,757
What's happenin'?

749
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:02,885
He hit it stone dead at 16.

750
01:22:02,968 --> 01:22:04,969
He's only down one.

751
01:22:06,473 --> 01:22:08,765
What does that mean?
Is it good?

752
01:22:08,892 --> 01:22:11,185
If he makes this, it's a playoff.

753
01:22:11,268 --> 01:22:14,355
Dear me, it's almost beyond
one's ability to calculate.

754
01:22:15,688 --> 01:22:17,568
Ah, don't mind if I do.

755
01:22:25,076 --> 01:22:27,369
He can't keep this up.
It's impossible.

756
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:36,859
I'll be damned.

757
01:23:39,695 --> 01:23:41,864
Yeah!

758
01:23:43,074 --> 01:23:44,200
Oh, Francis!

759
01:24:05,264 --> 01:24:08,186
There will be
an 18-hole playoff tomorrow

760
01:24:08,186 --> 01:24:11,479
between Vardon, Ray
and Mr. Ouimet

761
01:24:11,563 --> 01:24:13,689
to decide the Championship.

762
01:24:17,609 --> 01:24:20,108
OUIMET TIES WITH
BRISTONS FOT TITLE

763
01:24:25,468 --> 01:24:27,366
That boy's a gift
from the gods.

764
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:30,374
They're printing 'round
the clock at home.

765
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:32,792
Cripes! Imagine what
they're selling here.

766
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:35,966
Should have bought one of these
rags when I had the chance.

767
01:24:37,884 --> 01:24:41,386
It's a bold charge,
but he's spent his powder.

768
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:44,181
It's a two-man game now,
my lads.

769
01:24:44,265 --> 01:24:46,891
An all-English final.

770
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:49,478
Well, we'll see.

771
01:24:49,603 --> 01:24:52,065
Come on, Harry.
It's inconceivable.

772
01:24:53,564 --> 01:24:56,486
The man's a bloody amateur.

773
01:24:56,569 --> 01:24:58,781
When was the last time
you were beaten...

774
01:24:58,781 --> 01:25:00,990
Have you ever been
beaten, man-to-man,

775
01:25:01,073 --> 01:25:03,368
in your entire career
by an amateur?

776
01:25:03,493 --> 01:25:05,579
Amateurs do not win Opens.

777
01:25:05,704 --> 01:25:08,080
Hell, the last one
who won it back home

778
01:25:08,163 --> 01:25:10,168
was 40 years ago,
and he was a gentleman.

779
01:25:10,294 --> 01:25:13,797
This one's nothing of the kind.
He's a peasant. Common clay.

780
01:25:13,797 --> 01:25:16,173
He'll fold like an accordion.

781
01:25:16,298 --> 01:25:18,467
I need my rest.

782
01:25:23,304 --> 01:25:26,977
If he couldn't hit the ball
a country mile, he'd be digging ditches.

783
01:25:31,773 --> 01:25:34,274
Where are you going, Harry?
Sit down with me.

784
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:37,193
Eat with me.
Enjoy yourself.

785
01:25:37,277 --> 01:25:39,279
I came here to win a trophy.

786
01:25:39,405 --> 01:25:41,990
On the face of it, Ted Ray
or I should carry it off.

787
01:25:42,073 --> 01:25:43,867
Not for you, not for England,

788
01:25:43,991 --> 01:25:47,082
but for bloody pride at being
the best. That's why we do this.

789
01:25:47,206 --> 01:25:50,875
And if Mr. Ouimet wins tomorrow,
it's because he's the best,

790
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:53,171
because of who he is.

791
01:25:53,296 --> 01:25:56,007
Not who his father was,
not how much money he's got,

792
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:58,091
because of who he bloody is!

793
01:25:59,092 --> 01:26:01,596
And I'll thank you
to remember that.

794
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:08,103
And I'll thank you to show the respect
a gentleman gives as a matter of course.

795
01:26:09,979 --> 01:26:10,980
Good night.

796
01:26:36,675 --> 01:26:38,301
Do you want him to fail?

797
01:26:40,096 --> 01:26:43,973
Is that the only satisfaction
you can take from what he's doin'?

798
01:26:46,475 --> 01:26:49,479
You think I want him
to break his heart?

799
01:26:52,691 --> 01:26:55,111
What will you do,
Mary, when he fails?

800
01:26:55,194 --> 01:26:57,196
How will you help him then?

801
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:00,410
All you ever do
is encourage him.

802
01:27:03,287 --> 01:27:06,872
That's right.
I do encourage him.

803
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,002
He has a God-given talent,

804
01:27:10,086 --> 01:27:12,589
and this is his one chance
to give a voice to it.

805
01:27:16,593 --> 01:27:18,886
He's just tryin'
to make you proud.

806
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:50,587
"It seems impossible to believe
that this untested boy

807
01:27:50,711 --> 01:27:53,713
could hope to beat
two seasoned champions. "

808
01:27:56,592 --> 01:28:01,512
One David against two Goliaths.

809
01:28:04,685 --> 01:28:07,312
He'll have to face
Vardon and Ray alone,

810
01:28:07,396 --> 01:28:10,107
with a night to sleep
on the incredible situation

811
01:28:10,107 --> 01:28:13,277
in which he so shockingly
finds himself.

812
01:28:14,695 --> 01:28:17,490
Although, I suspect,

813
01:28:17,614 --> 01:28:20,202
from the unearthly calm
he showed today,

814
01:28:20,284 --> 01:28:22,286
he will sleep
better than most.

815
01:28:25,206 --> 01:28:28,877
I am not certain I believe
Ouimet can win,

816
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:32,715
but I have given up
all attempts at prophecy.

817
01:28:32,798 --> 01:28:37,007
I will start tomorrow's round
with an open mind.

818
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:42,517
It should be
the greatest game ever played.

819
01:29:17,596 --> 01:29:21,308
Young man.
We've been talking this over.

820
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:22,683
Talking what over?

821
01:29:22,808 --> 01:29:26,604
The members feel you need as much
help as you can get out there today.

822
01:29:26,604 --> 01:29:28,898
What kind of help?
- According to the rules,

823
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:31,692
your caddie is the only person
who can give you advice.

824
01:29:31,817 --> 01:29:35,280
You need someone with you today
who really knows our course.

825
01:29:35,406 --> 01:29:38,199
Exactly.
- Eddie's doin' a great job for me.

826
01:29:38,284 --> 01:29:39,785
For God's sake, Ouimet!

827
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:41,286
This is the U.S. Open,

828
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:43,996
not some junior
club championship.

829
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,210
You told Eddie this
before talking to me?

830
01:29:46,293 --> 01:29:48,421
Oh, you can't reason
with a boy like that.

831
01:29:48,504 --> 01:29:51,715
We'll take up a collection
for him and pay him handsomely.

832
01:29:51,798 --> 01:29:54,010
I understand
his family could use it.

833
01:29:54,092 --> 01:29:56,095
Don't let 'em do it, Francis!

834
01:29:56,095 --> 01:29:57,803
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

835
01:29:57,888 --> 01:30:00,309
Is it true? You know
I can't pay you, Eddie.

836
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:03,392
I wouldn't do it for ten bucks.
I wouldn't do it for a hundred!

837
01:30:03,517 --> 01:30:05,686
Hey, listen.
You think I'd replace you?

838
01:30:05,812 --> 01:30:07,689
But they said you'd want to.

839
01:30:07,815 --> 01:30:10,192
Who cares what they said?
Who cares?

840
01:30:10,316 --> 01:30:13,904
This is me and you.
We're a team. OK?

841
01:30:13,988 --> 01:30:16,198
They don't get a vote in this.

842
01:30:16,282 --> 01:30:17,782
All right?

843
01:30:19,202 --> 01:30:20,914
I'll meet you outside.

844
01:30:28,795 --> 01:30:31,215
Don't ever talk to my caddie again.

845
01:30:46,188 --> 01:30:48,817
Mr. Ouimet will play first.

846
01:30:50,819 --> 01:30:54,197
Mr. Darwin will act as honorary
marker and keep your scores.

847
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:00,997
Gentlemen, it's time.

848
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:10,798
Here he comes!
- Good luck, son!

849
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:16,512
Come on, young man!
- Come on, Ouimet!

850
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:18,805
Come on, Francis!
Come on!

851
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:27,188
Give us a strong show, son.

852
01:32:33,426 --> 01:32:35,719
Five for you there?
- That's right.

853
01:32:38,222 --> 01:32:39,892
You can do it, Francis.

854
01:32:40,018 --> 01:32:41,728
What?
- Wha... Sorry.

855
01:32:41,813 --> 01:32:43,897
Did I say something?

856
01:32:44,022 --> 01:32:45,398
That was big.

857
01:33:01,498 --> 01:33:02,915
They're human.

858
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:04,418
What's that?

859
01:33:04,502 --> 01:33:06,296
I can play these guys, Eddie.

860
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,214
Yeah? Who said you couldn't?

861
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:22,104
Oooh!

862
01:33:23,815 --> 01:33:25,815
Maybe they're not human.

863
01:33:35,116 --> 01:33:37,202
This is where he fell
apart the last time.

864
01:33:47,128 --> 01:33:48,799
That was yesterday.

865
01:34:04,608 --> 01:34:05,815
Sarah!

866
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,821
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in school.

867
01:34:08,904 --> 01:34:10,614
Don't be ridiculous, Father.

868
01:34:15,536 --> 01:34:17,704
He's not cracking, Harry.

869
01:34:17,829 --> 01:34:19,621
The thought
occurred to me.

870
01:34:20,623 --> 01:34:22,628
"An all-English final. "

871
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,305
Quiet, please.

872
01:35:08,424 --> 01:35:09,717
Stymied.

873
01:35:23,523 --> 01:35:25,734
What are you doin'?
- I'll show you.

874
01:35:47,132 --> 01:35:50,136
Come on, now. Finish him.

875
01:35:54,514 --> 01:35:56,807
Let's see if he cracks now.

876
01:36:06,236 --> 01:36:08,907
Fore right!

877
01:36:14,411 --> 01:36:16,829
He's dead in those trees.

878
01:36:32,804 --> 01:36:34,014
Mid iron.

879
01:36:53,618 --> 01:36:56,914
Done in by the monarch
of the forest.

880
01:37:21,525 --> 01:37:24,111
Down to you, old thing.
I'm done.

881
01:37:24,235 --> 01:37:26,237
Pity. It's a great match.

882
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:29,450
That's the spirit, Harry.

883
01:37:33,037 --> 01:37:34,621
Come on, Ouimet.

884
01:40:19,921 --> 01:40:21,631
Where you going with that?

885
01:40:21,755 --> 01:40:24,549
Gonna cut the corner.
- There's a bunker down there.

886
01:40:24,549 --> 01:40:26,220
If he's over it,
he's a chip away.

887
01:40:26,344 --> 01:40:28,638
We don't know he's over it.
It's a trick.

888
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:36,751
This is
our chance, Francis.

889
01:41:36,834 --> 01:41:38,837
Run it in there,
just like yesterday.

890
01:43:33,334 --> 01:43:36,964
My God. Francis has
a one-stroke lead with one to play.

891
01:44:36,943 --> 01:44:38,737
Hold the line, please.

892
01:44:38,861 --> 01:44:41,154
Hold the line!
Hold the line!

893
01:45:27,163 --> 01:45:28,663
Take your time.

894
01:45:37,965 --> 01:45:39,842
Let me have that towel, Eddie.

895
01:47:55,943 --> 01:47:57,364
Well done.

896
01:49:17,864 --> 01:49:21,162
You need this for 72.
You can do it.

897
01:49:21,162 --> 01:49:24,372
Read it, roll it and hole it.

898
01:50:03,081 --> 01:50:04,581
Yeah!

899
01:50:26,854 --> 01:50:29,982
Yeah! Yeah!

900
01:50:30,068 --> 01:50:31,569
Yeah!

901
01:50:40,577 --> 01:50:42,372
Yeah!

902
01:50:42,455 --> 01:50:44,374
Thank you! Thank you!

903
01:50:44,457 --> 01:50:46,374
You did it!
- Thank you!

904
01:50:47,459 --> 01:50:50,170
Look, Eddie, we did it!
We did it!

905
01:51:13,778 --> 01:51:15,781
No! No! I can't take it!

906
01:51:15,864 --> 01:51:17,658
Pass the hat for Eddie!

907
01:51:17,783 --> 01:51:20,286
Pass the hat for Eddie! Here!

908
01:51:24,666 --> 01:51:29,170
Pass the hat for Eddie!
Pass the hat for...

909
01:53:44,397 --> 01:53:48,192
Well played, Mr. Ouimet.
That was a great game.

910
01:53:48,192 --> 01:53:49,902
I enjoyed it.

911
01:53:50,987 --> 01:53:52,571
So did I.

912
01:53:52,695 --> 01:53:54,073
Yes, you did.

913
01:53:55,494 --> 01:53:58,705
Congratulations on your success.
You deserve it.

914
01:53:58,788 --> 01:54:00,081
Thank you.

915
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:10,299
We'll play again sometime.

916
01:54:26,981 --> 01:54:28,567
Look at this thing.

917
01:54:28,692 --> 01:54:31,405
It's a whopper.
- Isn't that something?

918
01:54:31,405 --> 01:54:33,075
They let you take it
home with ya?

919
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:34,701
Nobody's tried to stop me.

920
01:54:34,783 --> 01:54:36,787
Well, they'd have to get past me.

921
01:54:38,078 --> 01:54:39,999
You know somethin', Eddie?

922
01:54:40,081 --> 01:54:42,000
You and I are gonna be
great friends.

923
01:54:42,083 --> 01:54:44,086
You said it, Francis.

924
01:54:50,419 --> 01:54:55,827
The following year Harry Vandon won
his sixst British Open Championship,

925
01:54:55,828 --> 01:54:57,673
a record witch stands to the day.

926
01:54:58,185 --> 01:55:01,370
Altrough he died in 1937, he is still considered
the greatest English player of all the time.

927
01:55:01,903 --> 01:55:07,404
Francis Ouimet became a prominent businessman.
He went on to win two American Amateur Championships..

928
01:55:07,405 --> 01:55:11,405
and became the game's most admired ambassador.

929
01:55:12,405 --> 01:55:19,405
Eddie Lowery became a multi-milionaire.

930
01:55:21,572 --> 01:55:29,071
Francis and Eddie remained friends
their entire lives.
