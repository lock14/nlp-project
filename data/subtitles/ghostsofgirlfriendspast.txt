1
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,970
- Good morning, Connor.
- Versace is on 1.

2
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,555
Okay.

3
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,434
- Clear out.
- Good, good, good. Oh, I like this.

4
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,687
Okay, ladies,
do not look at me or the camera.

5
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:08,442
Just keep doing what you do.
On three. One, two, three.

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,945
All right. Reset, I'll be right back.
Pull the backlight down, and stop.

7
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,239
And more martinis around.
Nice work, gentlemen.

8
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,992
- Connor wants a re- light on one.
- We're moving to Stage 2.

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,286
And the Vanity Fair cover
is waiting on two.

10
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,164
- Oh, hey, you.
- Hi, Mr. Mead.

11
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,999
Hey. Good morning, ladies.

12
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,251
So do you wanna have dinner
With us after?

13
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,003
I'd love to' but I can't.

14
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,631
I'm booked solid, ladies.
But I will find you, okay?

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,466
Okay.

16
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,259
You want me to book them?

17
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,761
- Yes.
- Bye.

18
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,306
- Separately or together?
- Yes. Ha, ha.

19
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,186
- Good morning, Kalia.
- Hello.

20
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,479
I'm Connor Mead.

21
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,606
- You're ravishing.
- Well, thank you.

22
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,691
Stand here, please.

23
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,069
All right.

24
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,988
Let's get started.
Get rid of the green screen.

25
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,032
- Um, let's cozy up. Give me key light.
- Wha?

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,452
- Bring it over and down six inches.
- Excuse me, what are you doing?

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,124
And keep the set medic on cue just in case.
Can I have the' um...?

28
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,333
Apples.

29
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:11,046
- This is my wardrobe.
- That's the one. Oh, an ode to Billy Tell.

30
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,216
I just wanna let you know
that I'm a huge fan.

31
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,303
Likewise. I mean, I'm not 12 years old
and tone- deaf, so I don't like your music...

32
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,722
...but I really dig your look.

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,559
Can we come here and strengthen up
these eyebrows a touch?

34
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:28,897
Stay right there. Stay right there.
- So this is it?

35
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,899
This is the picture?

36
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,237
- I'm half naked with an apple on my head.
- Yes, you are.

37
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,490
This is the cover of Vanity Fair
from the great Connor Mead?

38
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,242
Well' not quite.

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,204
I'd like to introduce you to Kako Tatsumi.
She's a Japanese archery champion.

40
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,039
She's gonna be helping us out today.

41
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,418
And you have nothing to fear.
She placed sixth in Beijing.

42
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,964
Are you joking?

43
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,382
Is he? Is he joking?

44
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,760
Kalia' chin down, eyes here,
arms to your side.

45
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,098
- Somebody tell me he's joking.
Don't move.

46
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,600
Kako, on my count.

47
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,521
She didn't even medal!

48
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,987
Just listen to my music.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,617
I am more than my look. I am.

50
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,203
Sweetie, you are already gorgeous.

51
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,122
Why do you need
to be good at two things, huh?

52
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,832
Connor.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,543
- Need your select on the mayor's proofs.
- Now?

54
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,629
And I'm juggling three of your buddies...

55
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,714
...on iChat.
- Does she knock?

56
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,134
Sorry. You told me to make sure
you were on the road by 2.

57
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,469
Why?

58
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,304
Your brother's wedding in Newport?

59
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,681
- That's today?
- The rehearsal dinner's tonight...

60
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,935
- ... at your Uncle Wayne's old estate.
- Oh, God, I gotta get up there.

61
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:52,898
And I have Kiki' Charlece and Nadja
on your IM. They keep calling.

62
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,276
- Nadja. Remind me who Nadja is again?
- Nadja was dinner Friday night.

63
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:01,615
- Right. Very pretty girl. Didn't say much.
- She's Romanian. Barely speaks English.

64
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,326
Well' that explains it.
Scan these to Mike right away.

65
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,121
I am a touch busy' if you could
take care of those calls, I'd appreciate it.

66
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,375
No. No way. I'm not breaking up with girls
for you, Connor.

67
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,835
That's where I draw the line.
I believe in karma.

68
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,420
Okay.

69
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,673
- Conference them.
- Conference them?

70
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,175
Conference them.
Oh, no, you wouldn't.

71
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,219
Oh, yes, I would.

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,806
They're conferenced.
Click here to disconnect.

73
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,017
- Hello, ladies, it's Connor Mead.
- Hi, Connor.

74
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,104
- Hi.
- Whoa, is there anyone else on the line?

75
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,732
Listen' I'm sincerely pressed for time
right now' so I'm gonna-

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,568
Well' I'm gonna have to do this in bulk.
Um...

77
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,196
It's not gonna work out for us.

78
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,948
- Wait, are you kidding me?
- What?

79
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,867
Tell me you're not breaking up
With me on a conference call.

80
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,037
But I thought things were going great.
You are a womans hater.

81
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,539
Connor Mead hates womans.

82
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,501
No, no, no, I love womans.
I mean, "women," all right?

83
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,712
I love all women.
That's the problem here.

84
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,716
No. The problem is you date a girl for
two weeks, get her to fall in love with you-

85
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:05,470
He takes the love and he hoard it,
like a miser.

86
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,849
Jesus, doesn't anyone
just wanna have fun anymore?

87
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,058
I like to have fun.

88
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,395
All right, then don't listen to these ladies.
They are crazy.

89
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,231
We can still hear you
When you cover the camera, you know.

90
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,317
- Right.
- Emotionally retarded.

91
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,402
- You really need therapy.
- You stupid boy.

92
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,447
Ladies, it sounds like you have
an awful lot to discuss, okay?

93
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,200
So I'm gonna jump off,
but feel free to keep talking, okay?

94
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:33,332
Kiki' Nadja, Charlece, I had an amazing time
With each one of you.

95
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,417
I wish you all the best.

96
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,753
- Goodbye.
No, we are not done-

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,505
You really are as bad as they say.

98
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,176
Oh, no, dear, I am just a little bit worse.

99
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,720
Of course, you'd never treat me
that way, right?

100
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,932
No. I just did that for you.
I'm cleaning my plate for the main course.

101
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,937
You're the biggestjerk ever.
In fact, you're even famous for it.

102
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,232
No, really, why am I doing this?

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,319
Well' it usually has something to do
With your father.

104
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,447
Oh, please.
I've never even met my father.

105
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,033
Well' come to papa.

106
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,132
Okay, here we go.

107
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:10,262
This will have gone like clockwork,
so at 1529 I will say:

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,930
"You may kiss the bride. "

109
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,974
Oh, we should practice that,
shouldn't we?

110
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,727
- Oh, God.
- Paulie. Hey.

111
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,439
- Connor. Go around.
Yeah.

112
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,149
He came.

113
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,694
- He came.
- He came.

114
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,945
- What's wrong?
- What?

115
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,198
Well' you and all but one of my bridesmaids
have slept with him...

116
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,868
- ... so he can't be that bad' right?
- No.

117
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,328
Jenny' soothe the nervous bride.
- Oh, it's fine.

118
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,248
Hey.

119
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,333
Connor.

120
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,211
- Good to see you. Yeah.
- You made it.

121
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,838
- You look great.
- Thank you' man.

122
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,924
What do you think about what
We did to Uncle Wayne's old karate dejo?

123
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,718
Whoa.
- I'm psyched.

124
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,887
I didn't think
you were gonna make the rehearsal.

125
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,722
Well' I wanted to get here early...

126
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,808
...make sure you had time
to think about our last conversation.

127
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,312
You know, the one about marriage' love,
never- ending lifelong monogamy?

128
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,105
Yes, I definitely thought about it.

129
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,815
You did? Good' good.
- Yes, I did.

130
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,860
If you're having second thoughts,
here's the key to my Jag.

131
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,738
You give me the word, I'll block.

132
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,407
- Oh, my God, you're serious.
- You're damn right.

133
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,410
an' I'll do anything for you.
Who's got your back, huh?

134
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,039
Hey, it's you and me
against the world, right?

135
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,874
Why is he giving him keys?

136
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,835
- Why's he giving him keys?
- Oh, I bet he's giving you a car.

137
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,546
- I'm just gonna go check on that.
- Okay.

138
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,467
Connor, we've talked about this.
I wanna get married. I love Sandra.

139
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,094
- You say that now, okay?
- Everything okay here, guys?

140
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,472
Because we're still,
you know, rehearsing.

141
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,682
- Jenny Perotti.
- Connor Mead.

142
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,810
- I'll be damned.
- That's probably true.

143
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,855
- Hey, the bride's unsupervised.
- I'm on it.

144
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,234
- Buddy' we're not done talking about this.
- Done talking about what?

145
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,320
- Options.
- Options.

146
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,656
Yeah, listen to me, Connor.

147
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,952
This is the biggest weekend in Sandy's life.
If you detract from her wedding...

148
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,705
...I will sneak into your room
and cut off your favorite appendage.

149
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,624
Now, the first part sounds nice.

150
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,210
I can make it look like an accident.
Don't push me.

151
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,548
Just try to be supportive. Normal.
Just not a train wreck for once.

152
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,967
- I'll be on my best behavior.
- That worries me.

153
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,135
I will, I'll be supportive. Whatever.

154
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,637
Really?
Yes.

155
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,055
Come on.

156
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,975
See? I knew there wouldn't be
any weirdness between you two.

157
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:24,312
- Connor, you remember Sandra?
- Yes, I do. How are you, Sandra?

158
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,732
You know, it's not too late
to get out, gorgeous.

159
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,150
He's joking.

160
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,152
And you know the bridesmaids.

161
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,656
Oh, yes, I do. Deena, Donna.
How are you?

162
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,991
- And, uh...?
- Denice.

163
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,743
Nice to meet you, Denice. Ladies.
- Me too. How are you?

164
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,746
My groomsmen.
Guys, this is my brother' Connor.

165
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,915
- We've heard the stories, man.
Oh, okay.

166
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,168
- An honor to be serving with you.
- And with you.

167
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,963
It's "mice" to "neet" you.
Damn it, I blew it.

168
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,215
Sorry to break up the bromance,
guys, but...

169
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,010
...I need you right here
Where I can keep my eyes on you.

170
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,721
- bsolutely.
- Are we ready?

171
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,014
Yes, sorry, sarge.

172
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,683
Sarge?
Are they getting married by a cop?

173
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,061
Sergeant Major Volcom,
United States Marine Corps.

174
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,023
I am not a cop.

175
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,361
- Where'd you find this ray of sunshine?
- He's Sandra's dad.

176
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,615
Sarge, this is my brother, Connor.
Connor, this is the sarge.

177
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,783
He was ordained right after the war.

178
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,329
Little war called Korea.
Perhaps you've heard of it, slick?

179
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,331
Lost more men than Nam.

180
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,875
We didn't get a wall.
We didn't get a movie.

181
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,503
We got a sitcom with Alan Alda
Which was all nonstop laughs...

182
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,048
.. unless you were the one
Watching his friends die.

183
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,759
The war's over, Dad. It was a tie.

184
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,803
You know, we should probably try
to keep going on schedule.

185
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,348
- Hua.
- Hua.

186
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:45,560
Following the kiss at 1530 hours,
on my mark...

187
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,729
...groom will take bride's left forearm...

188
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,941
...rotate 180 degrees,
orienting north by northwest.

189
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,986
Then I will announce you
as husband and wife.

190
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,155
Following which...

191
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,994
Following which,
you will live happily ever after.

192
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,206
Oh, Daddy.

193
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,209
- So sweet. Oh' my God.
- That is sweet.

194
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,046
- I'm surrounded by huggers.
- There we go.

195
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,132
- No, we're cool, man.
- Come on.

196
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,897
Hey, Uncle Wayne.

197
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,904
Ah, the world's a lot less fun
Without you in it, buddy.

198
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,994
Oh, no. Oh, no.

199
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,665
No decorations in here. No.

200
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,334
No. No.

201
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,753
And' yes.

202
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,963
No.

203
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,760
- No! Wha? What did? What the?
- Something wrong?

204
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,724
I got over 30 scented candles
in my room.

205
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,643
- Oh, the wedding scent is lavender.
- The wedding scent?

206
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,730
- And people wonder why I'm not married.
- Not really.

207
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,608
I mean, seriously, Jenny, my Uncle Wayne
is rolling over in his grave right now.

208
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,736
No, come on. Wayne loved a good party.

209
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,990
Party, yes. A wedding? No.
Back in the day that man used this place...

210
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,661
...for mind- numbing, clothing- optional,
Weeklong orgies, okay?

211
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,164
Do you know Dean Martin
slept in that bathroom?

212
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,459
He drank from the bidet
and sang the Canadian national anthem...

213
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,918
- ... in Spanish.
- In Spanish.

214
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:39,674
- Yeah, I remember Wayne telling us that.
- Yeah. Now that, that was a party. Not this.

215
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,971
You know, people were taking bets
on whether or not you'd even show up.

216
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,515
- Miss my kid brother's wedding?
- That's what I said.

217
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,186
The whole asshole thing you do
is to get insecure women to sleep with you.

218
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,190
- Deep down, you're a big sweetheart.
- Oh. Look who's got me pegged.

219
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,152
And there's the sarcasm to cover up
the accidental display of affection for Paul.

220
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,779
Hey.

221
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,156
I'm not covering anything up.

222
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:09,037
And I would also be more than happy to
take off the rest of my clothes to prove it.

223
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,458
Then there's the cheap sexual innuendo.
All the old Connor Mead tricks are back.

224
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,795
Well' don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

225
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,964
I won't tell anyone you have feelings.

226
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,719
Hua!

227
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,389
Oh, gosh.

228
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,894
- Okay. Yeah, it didn't work. Still nervous.
- Let's do another one.

229
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,439
Sandy' what about him?
- Dan Palumbo. Married.

230
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,024
Oh. Kids?

231
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,485
hat? They're not really married
unless they have kids.

232
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,903
Hua.

233
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,906
- Heard, understood, acknowledged.
- Sandy.

234
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,034
Save some liquor
for the rest of the guests.

235
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,245
- Bye, Mrs. Mead.
- Clean my room, pledge.

236
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,086
Slow down. Slow down.

237
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,004
- Hey.
- Here you are, sir.

238
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,258
If you can keep those coming
all night. Thank you.

239
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,343
And now we're off.

240
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,886
- Excuse me, Mr. Mead?
- Mm- hm.

241
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,389
I just wanna tell you,
I'm a huge fan of your work.

242
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,267
- Thank you.
- Gonna photograph your brother's wedding?

243
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,770
No. No, I'm not a wedding photographer.

244
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,107
- Right, but it's your brother.
- Right.

245
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,944
He's not good at taking pictures of people
With their clothes on.

246
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,280
- Look who's funny.
- It's not his specialty.

247
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,575
- Ah.
- Turn your phone off.

248
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,451
Connor Mead.

249
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,704
No, I would not like to cut my quota.

250
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,164
- Connor.
- Look, just tell him to go screw himself.

251
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,876
- Yeah, I said, tell him to go screw himself.
- Hey.

252
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,337
Like when a man and a woman-
I gotta go. Gotta go.

253
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,381
- Hi.
- Oh' my God.

254
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,592
- Sit down before you-
- Oh, my God.

255
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,427
What?
- What is this?

256
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:51,723
- Endive arugula salad. You did well-
- No, no, no. The salad I ordered had figs.

257
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,810
Yeah, because fruit is the new crouton.
This is-

258
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,732
This is a disaster. My friends and family
didn't come all the way over here...

259
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,651
.. to be met with some lackluster salad.
Where are the figs?

260
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,404
Excuse me, where are the figs?
Because I want some figs!

261
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,489
Sweetie? Sweetie. Hi.

262
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,991
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

263
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,659
Hi.

264
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,370
Okay, look, you're right, okay?
You did order figs.

265
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,624
But, uh, everyone seems
to be loving the salad, right?

266
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,293
- Anybody missing figs?
- The dressing is a panoply...

267
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,837
- ... of flavors.
- It's really good salad.

268
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,507
- A lot to recommend, this salad.
- Okay. Sorry.

269
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,178
- There she is. All right, she's back.
- I'm sorry, everyone. I just-

270
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,057
It's my wedding and-
Well' I'm not usually a massive bitch.

271
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,601
- She kind of is.
- Ha, ha. Stop it.

272
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,188
I just really want everything
to start out perfectly.

273
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,274
I mean, I only plan on getting married
four or five times' tops.

274
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,360
Oh, sweetie.

275
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,111
Oh, which reminds me, Connor.

276
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,156
Sandy and I wanted to know
if you would make a toast tomorrow.

277
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,658
What?

278
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,703
- Yeah. We'd like that.
- I know it's not really your thing...

279
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,040
...but it is kind of a tradition
for the best man to give a toast.

280
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,834
- Could be super short.
- Super long, whatever you want.

281
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,545
- They kidding? Are you kidding?
- Yes.

282
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,755
- No.
- Yes.

283
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,842
No, you're the only family I got here,
so I thought you could say something.

284
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,387
I don't think this is the best idea
you've ever had.

285
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,889
- I'm with Jenny.
- You can scrounge up a cousin-

286
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,891
No, no, no. Come on, you're my brother.

287
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,227
ou're funny, you're articulate,
you're smart.

288
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,898
- True, true and true. Um, I'm flattered, but-
- If you're not gonna take pictures...

289
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,193
- ... it's the least you can do.
- Who the hell is this guy?

290
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,569
Who's that?
- Jeff.

291
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:33,074
I'm not toasting anyone tomorrow' okay?

292
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,869
I can't toast this.

293
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,914
- Come on.
- This always happens. All Scotch, no carbs.

294
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,418
Is there a bread basket? You know what,
let's talk about something else.

295
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,086
So, um' when do you catch your flight?

296
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,172
Paulie, you know where I come out
on all this, buddy.

297
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,760
To me, marriage is an archaic
and oppressive institution...

298
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,054
...that should a been abolished years ago.

299
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,934
and love? It's magical comfort food
for the weak and the uneducated.

300
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,270
Yeah, it makes you feel all warm
and relevant...

301
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,691
...but in the end, love leaves you weak,
dependant and fat.

302
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,862
- Yeah, that might not make the best toast.
- Are you saying I'm fat?

303
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,905
No. Are you kidding?
- No' no' no.

304
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,450
No, sweetie, sweetie,
he's being funny, I think.

305
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,745
Better hold your next words
real close, Paco.

306
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:25,126
Believe me, all right? For Paul's sake'
I wish I could believe in all this crap. I do.

307
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,795
And I also wish I could believe
in the Easter bunny...

308
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,424
...the missile shield,
and strippers with a heart of gold, all right?

309
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:36,137
but, unfortunately, I am condemned
to see the world as it really is.

310
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,723
And love? Love is a myth.

311
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,977
Oh, good. Because I was afraid you were
gonna make a really long, cynical speech.

312
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,896
Truth hurts, baby.

313
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,316
- Why don't you go?
- Yeah. Why don't I do that?

314
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,485
And I think I'll take my salad with me.

315
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,572
Mm. Some figs would've been nice.

316
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,168
This is gonna be tougher than I thought.

317
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,672
You got that right, kid.

318
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,761
Uncle Wayne?

319
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,974
Uncle Wayne.

320
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,268
- Uh...
- Ha, ha.

321
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,478
You're dead.

322
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:30,274
Players never die, Dutch.
They just try their luck at a difforent table.

323
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,110
Whoa, whoa.

324
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,029
Never touch a man
When he's hanging a wire.

325
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,864
You kidding me?

326
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,829
Oh, God.

327
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,041
Aqua Velva.

328
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,129
What are you? What are you?
What are you? What are you doing here?

329
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,548
I'm here to warn you, kid.

330
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,800
Don't waste your life like I did.

331
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,846
What are you talking about?
You had a great life, man.

332
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,558
You're a legend.
The money, the parties, the women, you-

333
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,145
Listen' kid. When the music stops
and you're looking for your slacks...

334
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,939
...none of that stuff matters worth a lick.

335
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,734
Well' there was this one party. Um...

336
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,903
New Year's '68, Philippines.

337
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,865
Me, Stevie McQueen,
17 Lufthansa stewardesses...

338
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,577
...and a pile of blow the size of a toaster.

339
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,203
Now that was a good night.

340
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,289
Aw. That sounds like a great night.

341
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,959
Oh, no, I've had a few laughs,
I've chased some tail but, trust me, Dutch...

342
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,752
...you don't wanna end up like me.

343
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,755
- What are you talking about?
- No, no. Save it for the sandman.

344
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,886
I've been watching you'
and you are definitely turning out like me.

345
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,971
Frankly, I mean, who could blame you?

346
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,100
But tonight-
Tonight, things are gonna change.

347
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,355
Tonight you're gonna be visited
by three ghosts.

348
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,858
You have got to be kidding me.

349
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,571
And you're gonna be forced to feel things
that you haven't felt for a long time.

350
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,365
Things like feelings, for example.

351
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:06,120
Remember, no matter how much it hurts,
it's all for your own good.

352
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,625
and the stuff that's not for your own good,
it's for my entertainment.

353
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,002
Look, Uncle Wayne, you-

354
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,798
Where'd he go?

355
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,017
All right, that didn'tjust happen. Okay.

356
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,902
Uh- oh.

357
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,324
Melanie! Melanie? Where are you?
I need you up here, all right?

358
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,286
Look, you are my assistant
and I need assistance.

359
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,539
Blue Label and give it wings, brother.
Call me.

360
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,267
You feel so real.

361
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,311
Well' they are, honey. A hundred percent.

362
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:17,483
I'm not sure what you've heard about me,
but I usually like to be bought a drink first.

363
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:23,322
- You're not who I thought you were.
- Vonda Volcom, mother of the bride.

364
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:30,955
Connor Mead, brother of the groom.
Please, sit, Vonda Volcom.

365
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,707
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

366
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,252
- Champagne for the lady.
- Lovely.

367
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,463
- So how long have you been divorced?
- I beg your pardon?

368
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,632
Please. I mean, you're ravishing.

369
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,385
No married woman your age
keeps her form this fine.

370
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,683
I've been divorced eight years now.

371
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,519
Sarge and I aren't talking just yet.

372
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,523
- It's juvenile and sad.
- Honey, stop right there.

373
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,358
It's not your fault, okay?

374
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:03,654
Marriage is a corrupt
and hateful institution.

375
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,741
I covered all of this earlier
at another table.

376
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,745
I wanna ask you something.
When did casual sex become a crime?

377
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,914
I mean'
nowadays being single means...

378
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,709
...what, you've lost your way?
That something is missing?

379
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:21,964
Never mind that every night
I swim in a lake of sex...

380
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:26,052
...and they fall asleep
in each others' arms, spooning.

381
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,931
Connor, spooning is nice.

382
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,018
Yeah, but not as nice as forking.

383
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,395
- Am I right?
- Ha, ha. It's true.

384
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,482
Hey, you know what the owner of this place
once told me?

385
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:43,527
He said, "Keep it light, Dutch.
Keep it light. "

386
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,365
I never understood
Why he called me Dutch...

387
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:52,036
...but I believe his wisdom still holds.
- That's nice.

388
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,080
- I like that.
- Mm.

389
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,211
Listen' darling, before we take this
to the next level, are we off- limits?

390
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,797
I mean, technically we're not family
until tomorrow.

391
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,925
I am extremely flattered.

392
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,096
But, yes, we are definitely off- limits.

393
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:14,058
That's a shame. I bet you know
your way around a bedroom.

394
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,976
You always talk to women like this?

395
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,104
Yes.

396
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,648
- Does it work?
- Yes.

397
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:27,655
Well' while I can't be of service to you,
I am sure that she can.

398
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:32,243
Blonde, six o'clock?
Blue dress, legs up to her chin?

399
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,414
That's the one. She's been eyeing you
the whole time we've been talking.

400
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,667
- It's been a real pleasure talking to you.
- Likewise.

401
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,670
You are truly an inspiration.

402
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,633
Hi. Excuse me.
I'm gonna steal her away just for a second.

403
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,719
Jenny, come with me.
I have to give you your maid- of- honor gift.

404
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,097
Remember that guy
I was telling you about, Brad?

405
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,766
No, no. I told you,
I do not want to be set up again.

406
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,644
I've been through it too many times.
Please don't make me.

407
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,855
That's Brad.

408
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,110
Okay, but this is the last time.

409
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,029
- How are my teeth?
- Clear. Perfect.

410
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,908
- Just try to play it cool. Just no big deal.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

411
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,703
Brad. This is Jenny.

412
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,581
- Right. The hot, single doctor.
- Hi.

413
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,791
Paul and Sandra
have been talking about you.

414
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,962
I know what car you drive' where you
Went to school, how many dogs you have.

415
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,841
That is right. You're both animal people.
What are the odds?

416
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,051
- So glad this isn't awkward.
- Right. Ahem.

417
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:36,557
Oh, I forgot to tell you. Brad loves
to run triathlons too. I know, right?

418
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,728
- Do you wanna go anywhere else?
- Yeah, I thought you'd never ask.

419
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,814
- Bye.
- You guys have a good time, you crazy kids.

420
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,735
- Hey, Connor.
- Hey.

421
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,195
How you been?

422
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,574
Well' I'm at a wedding,
I'm seeing ghosts in the john.

423
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,743
- I've been better.
- All right.

424
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,830
Well' what were you and Sandra's mom
talking about so intensely?

425
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,832
Casual sex.

426
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,254
So, what's your stance
on casual sex, bridesmaid?

427
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:11,175
On top. I mean- I'm for it.

428
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,845
Well' speaking of which,
I think I owe you an apology.

429
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:19,391
I've enjoyed the company
of all the other bridesmaids except you.

430
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,435
I mean, you must feel terribly left out.

431
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,104
I do.

432
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:29,443
Well' I do hope that there's some way
to rectify this injustice.

433
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:34,240
Well' you know what I always say is,
"To think globally, act locally. "

434
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,786
Listen' before I, uh, commence
the launch code:

435
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:44,041
Are you the one my brother slept with?
Because I don't like to cross swords.

436
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:48,879
Wait, what? Your brother slept
With one of the bridesmaids?

437
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,549
Okay, I guess it wasn't you.

438
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:56,178
Okay, from now on, I don't cross swords.
Listen' forget I even brought it up.

439
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,516
Hey, why don't you scamper up
to my room, boil some water...

440
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,186
...get the chicken claw out of my suitcase,
do some light stretching...

441
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,146
...and I will be up in 5?

442
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,857
Chicken claw. Okay.

443
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,569
- Chicken claw.
- Okay.

444
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:16,156
Suitcase. Stretching. Scamper.
Five minutes.

445
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:20,786
And that's how it's done, son.
That is how it's done.

446
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,413
Does it work on guys?

447
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,291
Probably.

448
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,918
- Excuse me, mind if we take these seats?
- No, please.

449
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,504
All right.
- Oh, hello there, friend.

450
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,506
- Hey.
- Connor Mead, brother of the groom.

451
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,134
- This is Brad.
- Frye. Nice to meet you.

452
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,011
Nice to meet you.

453
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,847
You must be the wedding sex
they flew in for Jenny here.

454
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:44,018
And' uh' you must be the wedding sex
they brought in for everyone else.

455
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:50,691
He's getting his little blush. He's gotten
that ever since he was a kid. It's adorable.

456
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,528
Oh, honey, if I was jealous, why am I,
at this very moment, heading upstairs...

457
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,780
.. to close out my hat trick
of bridesmaids?

458
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,163
Maybe you're terrified of being alone with
your empty hollow soul for even a minute.

459
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,459
- You got a live one here' Brad.
- Yeah, look, maybe I'd better go.

460
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,462
- No, Brad, you're staying.
- I'll go.

461
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,297
Run along, Connor.

462
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,300
There's a bridesmaid waiting
to be partially satisfied.

463
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,801
Absolutely.

464
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,889
Brad, it's a pleasure. I hope you enjoy
pillow fights, talking about your feelings...

465
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,558
.. and sharing massages
With your clothes on.

466
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,644
Jenny.

467
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,145
Connor.

468
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,490
I know...

469
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,246
Brad. Guy probably irons his jeans.

470
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,582
Well' that's more like it.

471
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,879
And how is my little 6- foot'
legs- to- her- chin...

472
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,132
...blond- haired, blue- eyed,
Happy Meal of a bridesmaid?

473
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,009
- Hi, Connor! Ha, ha.
- Whoa!

474
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,387
- Have you missed me?
- Who are you?

475
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,640
What, you don't? You don't remember?

476
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,442
Allison Vandermeersh?

477
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,446
Connor Mead...

478
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,115
...remembers me.

479
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,076
I can die now. I'm just kidding.
I'm totally kidding.

480
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,453
- What are you doing here?
- I'm like a ghost now.

481
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,789
Yeah, the ghost of girlfriends past,
in fact.

482
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,295
Oh, it tickles a little bit.

483
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,800
- There.
- Connor?

484
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,388
Really? You're gonna outrun a ghost?

485
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,480
We could do this all day, dude.

486
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,692
All right, you're not real.

487
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,569
No, you can't be. You're...

488
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,530
You're just a repressed memory,
activated by all the booze...

489
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:06,660
...and the trauma of Paulie getting married.
But you, you are not real.

490
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,329
All right. Well, have a nice trip.
- Whoa.

491
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,832
See you next fall. Ha, ha.

492
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,003
Is that real enough for you' dude?
- Whoa, watch it.

493
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,756
Be cool. All right,
What are you gonna do to me?

494
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,466
Oh, no, it's gonna be rad, okay?

495
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,469
I am gonna take you back
through all your past girlfriends...

496
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,097
...then you and I can figure out
how you got your head so far up your ass.

497
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,849
Ready, Freddie?

498
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,569
Ta- da!

499
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,404
All right, what the hell's going on?

500
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,949
We're still at your Uncle Wayne's,
only now we're in 1982...

501
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,369
...which is, of course,
the summer of your first relationship.

502
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,038
Connor.

503
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:58,295
Oh. Look at how cute you were.
I wanna squeeze you.

504
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,505
- Yes!
- Oh.

505
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,381
And we knew who she was, of course.

506
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,716
Jenny Perotti.

507
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,930
I win' 1:26 for you, 1:20 for me.
I beat you by 6.

508
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:12,059
No way. It's your birthday.
I let you win as your gift.

509
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,728
Uh- huh. Then what's that?

510
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:21,527
- Can they see us?
- No, we're ghosts.

511
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,989
Get out.

512
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,827
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's great.

513
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,247
- You're the best, Jenny.
- Really?

514
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,249
What else do you think of me?

515
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,668
Oh.

516
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,419
I don't know.

517
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:43,048
- You see how young they start?
- Shh. Watch.

518
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,425
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,846
Line it up, buddy. Get in there.

520
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,996
This doesn't even look like you.

521
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,956
You look like a girl.

522
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,584
What, Connor?

523
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,336
This is my favorite part.

524
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,213
I'm gonna keep it forever.

525
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:29,303
- "I'm gonna keep it forever. "
- I don't think I said that. Did you edit this?

526
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,472
I'm gonna keep it forever.

527
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,810
You sure that wasn't my brother?
He always said fruity stuff like that.

528
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,813
I'm gonna keep it forever.
Forever. Forever.

529
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,815
Okay, I get it. I said it.

530
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,984
I'm gonna keep it forever.

531
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,446
Not as dumb as he looks' folks.

532
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,911
Go.
- Wait. This doesn't count.

533
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,496
I wasn't ready' cheater.

534
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,336
Mom and Dad.

535
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,300
This was the summer
before their car accident.

536
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,679
Look how happy they were.

537
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,648
The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want. He maketh me...

538
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:26,360
Uncle Wayne, Paul and Jenny
Were all you had left.

539
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,447
She knew you before you became...

540
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,366
...you.

541
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,870
All right.

542
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,956
All right, what's next?

543
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,550
Middle school? Really?

544
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,726
- You remember this, right?
- Pretty sure I intentionally blocked it out.

545
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,728
Whoo!

546
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,563
Surely we don't have time for this.

547
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,234
As you and Jenny got older, you
tried to make that super- tough transition...

548
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,696
...from being best friends
to maybe being boyfriend/girlfriend.

549
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,573
- This dance is so lame.
- Totally.

550
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,745
I don't know why, but there's something
creepy about the white- glove thing.

551
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,706
Oh, yeah.

552
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,918
Nice move.

553
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,171
Who's "ooh- ing" who,
Franklin Middle School?

554
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,133
I'm gonna slow it down right now...

555
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:37,931
...so guys, grab that special girl
and head on out to the dance floor.

556
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,685
Ask her to dance, man.

557
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,312
She's begging for it. Ask her.

558
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,982
- So-
- Jenny! Oh, my God, Jenny.

559
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,111
Neil just told Suzy that Pete Hastings
Wants to slow dance with you.

560
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,613
Pete Hastings is totally gorge.

561
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:59,453
No, Pete Hastings is now bald and doing
Civil war reenactments on the weekends.

562
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,581
Yeah, and he's gonna wanna make out.

563
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,208
Yeah, and he's a ninth grader,
so that means tongue.

564
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,628
Oh, my God, I can't believe
how lucky you are. Pete Hastings.

565
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,637
Okay, I guess.

566
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,139
Yes! Ha, ha.

567
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,141
Yeah, but

568
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,484
That dude used to get boners
in the gym shower. Don't sweat it.

569
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,486
But at least he didn't choke.

570
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:36,656
Hey, I didn't choke, all right?
I could've closed if I wanted to.

571
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,161
I was being a gentleman.

572
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,164
I can't breathe.

573
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,590
You know what? You didn't wanna
hit that anyway, little man.

574
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,153
Hey, kid. What's with the waterworks?

575
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,863
Jenny.

576
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,659
- Pregnant?
- No.

577
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,410
Crabs?

578
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,287
No.

579
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,582
Took her to the coat room,
found out she had a tenpin up her dress?

580
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,543
Don't worry, it happens to all of us.

581
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,795
Wait, what?

582
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,881
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
So, what happened?

583
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,635
Jenny kissed Pete Hastings tonight.

584
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,930
Her first kiss. Now everything is ruined.

585
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,558
I don't even know
if we're gonna get married anymore.

586
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,518
Trust me, kid, you dodged a bullet.

587
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,605
You don't wanna be anybody's first kiss'
or their last.

588
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,025
Say what you will,
that man was a visionary.

589
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,903
You know he invented the word "MILF"?

590
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,657
What am I gonna do?
I've never felt this way before.

591
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,618
I feel like someone has punched me
straight in the stomach...

592
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,080
.. and I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
God, I hate girls!

593
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,669
That's sissy talk.

594
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,423
Never talk like that
in the stabbing wagon.

595
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,719
- Uncle Wayne, where are your seat belts?
- Again with the sissy talk.

596
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,099
He never wore seat belts. Never.

597
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:31,479
Look, kid,
I'm, uh, sorry I raised my voice at you.

598
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:35,400
Being a parent ain't exactly
my chosen profession, you know?

599
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:41,781
I mean, I can't teach you algebra,
or camping, or even ethics.

600
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,328
But when it comes to dames...

601
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,916
- ... I've got a gift.
- Really?

602
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,545
Because I will do anything you say.

603
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,633
I never wanna feel like this again. Ever.

604
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,927
Okay, Dutch.

605
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,054
Never again.

606
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,263
Hang on.

607
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:17,400
- Are we in a bar?
- Think of it like a classroom.

608
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,842
Hiya, Tommy. Two Jacks. Up, please.

609
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,680
Dutch, try that old saddle out for size.

610
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,102
Rule number one: Don't look at them.

611
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,522
Dames, they're like horses.
They spook easy.

612
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,524
Cheers, Dutch.

613
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,572
Rule number two:
Never soil your wingman.

614
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,992
- Sorry.
- You're learning on your feet.

615
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,869
You know, if we were actually out,
uh, chasing tail tonight...

616
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,539
...I'd turn your gaffo into a funny.

617
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,793
Girls, they love to laugh.
Especially at men.

618
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:21,589
Makes them feel more powerful' which
in turn makes them feel more comfortable.

619
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,718
Which in turn makes them prone
to massive errors in judgment...

620
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,888
...like, having sex with a complete stranger
in the port authority bathroom. Ha' ha.

621
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,308
But I'm not even supposed
to talk to strangers.

622
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,727
No, that's good, that's good.
No talking is good.

623
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,731
No phone numbers, no last names.
Hey, no first names if you can swing it.

624
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,275
Will somebody please
call Child Protective Services?

625
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,152
Shh. Quiet, the prophet speaks.

626
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,864
See' kid, an ugly broad, you might as well
take her out behind the shed...

627
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,575
.. and put one behind the ear.
That dog won't hunt.

628
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,328
But any dude with a johnson,
he's got a shot...

629
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:56,416
- ... because cool comes from the inside.
- God, I miss that man.

630
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,043
So here's a couple of tips.

631
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,048
When you first meet a girl, you give her
two compliments, above the neck.

632
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,676
You tell her she's got nice lips,
nice eyes' nice hair...

633
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,430
...she's intelligent, her moral ethics,
Whatever crap comes to your mind.

634
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,808
Then, just when she begins to think
that you're another, you know...

635
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,896
.. vanilla- nice guy that she can tool around
With all night without getting naked...

636
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:24,569
...you insult her. Flip the power dynamic,
and you let her know you're here to play.

637
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,990
- Well, Jenny said she doesn't like games.
- Forget about that broad.

638
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,869
- I thought all this was to get her back.
- That's why you gotta forget about her.

639
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,456
It's your feelings for her
that are killing your game.

640
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,794
If there's one thing
that you learn tonight, it's this:

641
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:46,216
The power of a relationship lies
With whoever cares less.

642
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,178
Amen to that, brother.

643
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,972
One day you're gonna wake up
With some chick, spooning...

644
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,808
...you know, thinking about love.

645
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,102
And at that moment,
you have gotta get up.

646
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,146
Do not walk, don't get your shoes,
run the hell out of there.

647
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,607
Because maybe not the next day
or the next week...

648
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,486
...but sometime in the future,
you're gonna get crushed. Again.

649
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,322
- You don't wanna feel that way, do you?
- No.

650
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,241
- No.
Yep.

651
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:16,413
Okay, so, uh, let's get down
to brass tacks here.

652
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:21,376
Say I wanted to pick up
on that ice- cold blond at eight o'clock.

653
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,504
Eight o'clock? How did you even see her?

654
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,465
We'll deal with reflective surfaces
at another time.

655
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,468
Should I, uh, get a handful a daisies,
then go:

656
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,595
"Hi, you wanna go to the disco with me?"

657
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,347
Uh...

658
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,515
No?
- No.

659
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,060
No, because I might as well say'
"I'm a fag. Let's be friends. "

660
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:44,107
So, what would be a smart play?
Have some fun with it. What do you think?

661
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,651
I don't know. I mean...

662
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,447
...you could maybe
talk to the girl next to her?

663
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,365
You know, maybe make her feel jealous?

664
00:40:56,036 --> 00:41:02,000
Hand to God, kid, I never felt
like you were my son until now.

665
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:09,424
Man' I don't know why we didn't have
this conversation years ago, huh?

666
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,635
Well' that's enough for one night.
Let's hit the bricks.

667
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,679
- But what about the blond?
- No, no, no.

668
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,141
- You gotta throw the small ones back.
- Come on.

669
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,060
- I mean, itjust wouldn't be right.
- Please?

670
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,398
This elevator's going down.

671
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,735
Here we go.
Watch this move. Watch this move.

672
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:36,201
I gotta say, I remember
the ladies being a bit more glamorous.

673
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:48,004
And that, Dutch, is how it's done.
That's how it's done.

674
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,089
But you just struck out.

675
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:54,594
You know, just because she's not into that
doesn't mean I'm not.

676
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,014
I've got a gift.

677
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:04,145
Oh, well' hello, darling.
What took you so long? Hi.

678
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,772
And you were never the same.

679
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,358
Come on. Whoo!

680
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,282
Vicky's basement.

681
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,953
Yeah, I'd recognize that bachy smell
from anywhere.

682
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,789
Oh, I know, it smells good.
Oh, there's Jenny.

683
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,960
You didn't see her for two years
While you learned at the hand of the master.

684
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,257
Hey, Connor's here.

685
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,309
I, uh, got the new Poison.

686
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,689
It's Connor Mead.

687
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:51,109
I heard his uncle homeschooled
him in Vegas for the last two years.

688
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,152
Really? I heard it was Bangkok.

689
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,283
Okay, it has been too long.
Yeah!

690
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,994
Yeah!
All right!

691
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,872
- Nice move, buddy.
- Yeah.

692
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,876
See' the worst part about your
uncle's advice was it actually worked.

693
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,503
Thank God, Uncle Wayne.

694
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,674
He so doesn't wanna talk to you.

695
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,802
He looks like Duran Duran, both of them.

696
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,640
Look, it's me.
Oh, my God, it's me, it's me. Ha, ha.

697
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:30,023
Oh, my God.
We dated for the next 39 minutes...

698
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,943
...and it was the best two- thirds of an hour
in my young life.

699
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,156
Look at how happy we were.

700
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:43,036
But, alas' our love was not meant to be.

701
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,457
I mean, you didn't get the girl
that you really loved...

702
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,335
...but you did get every other girl
in high school.

703
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:54,380
Starting with me that very night.
You remember that' your first time?

704
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:59,469
- No, no, no. I don't wanna see that.
- Oh, no, don't worry, it didn't last very-

705
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,678
It's over.

706
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:12,315
Connor Mead's first sex partner.
It's like' I feel...

707
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,319
I feel like Neil Armstrong.
It's really the only thing I could equate...

708
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,322
...you know, to what I did for you.

709
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,035
You know, him on the moon,
me with you, it's like he was the first.

710
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,746
You know, like,
Jenny was your first love...

711
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,667
...but you had to grow 12 inches of hair
before you saw her again.

712
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,671
Now, to my way of thinking,
every woman is beautiful in some way.

713
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,174
I just have to figure out how.
I've gotta see it, I've gotta frame it...

714
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,425
...I've gotta focus it.

715
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,762
And then I shoot it.
Yeah, and it's immortalized.

716
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,598
Jenny, you want another Zima?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.

717
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,767
Jenny Perotti.

718
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,852
Connor Mead.

719
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,355
- Hey.
- Hey, it's me.

720
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,108
- You look gorgeous, darling.
- Oh.

721
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,610
Thank you, darling.

722
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,446
Uh, ladies, you're gonna have to excuse me
for a moment.

723
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:04,409
I must buy a drink for the girl who blew
me off for Pete Hastings in high school.

724
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,495
- I didn't blow you off, you choked.
- I was slow playing you.

725
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,080
- You choked.
- Excuse us for-

726
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,624
Slow playing me?
For what, 10 years? Please.

727
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,001
All right, maybe I choked.

728
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,713
- So- Yeah.
- Jenny Perotti.

729
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,965
What are you doing with all the women?

730
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,051
I work for Herb Ritts.
You know, the famous photographer?

731
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,637
- You're a photographer?
- I am.

732
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,099
- I gave you your first camera.
- You sure did.

733
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,977
- So, what are you? What are you doing?
- I'm a doctor.

734
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,646
Well, first- year resident, but...
- Yeah.

735
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:37,066
- But Herb Ritts. God, that's impressive.
- Yeah, I'm his second shooter.

736
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,986
- That's great.
- I bank north of 150K a year.

737
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,656
- It's totally killer' I love my job. Hector.
- Yeah?

738
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,788
- I can't believe you just said that.
- I can't believe I just said that either.

739
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:54,292
You told me your salary, and then
spoke Spanish to the old white guy.

740
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,170
- You're totally cheesy now.
- Get out. I am not.

741
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,465
- You gonna try to get me in the sack now?
- I'm the same old Connor.

742
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,134
Damn right I'm gonna try
and get you in the sack now.

743
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,762
Look at you, you are gorgeous.
What did you think?

744
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,182
I was inviting you over here to have a drink
just to see how you been?

745
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,935
- How have you been?
- Great.

746
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,355
Pete Hastings and I are still together,
madly in love.

747
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:20,109
- Damn it. I knew it.
- We live in a split- level in Jersey. It's love.

748
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,863
- That son of a bitch.
- Lot of slow dancing, making out, tongue.

749
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,199
And every now and then
I put on the red dress...

750
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,826
- No, pink. Pink dress.
- ... let him cup my bottom.

751
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,204
- The hot- pink dress.
- What?

752
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:36,417
That's the dress you were wearing when
you were dancing with Pete instead of me.

753
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,211
Hey, Jen?

754
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,213
We're leaving.

755
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,757
But we can wait...

756
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,801
Um...

757
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,971
Nope. I'm going, thanks.

758
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:53,100
- Whoa, just like that?
- Well, it was great seeing you.

759
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,852
- Jenny.
- Take care.

760
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,021
- Hang on a second.
- Come on.

761
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,440
You gotta at least give me your number.

762
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,235
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do, doc.

763
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:06,405
I have a medical condition that I need to see
you about, and by law you have to help me.

764
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,407
- What's your medical condition?
- Broken heart.

765
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,453
Come on. Come on, we'll go out.
We'll have fun.

766
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,957
We'll have a little dinner,
have a little sex.

767
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,835
- Okay, okay, just sex.
- How aboutjust dinner?

768
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,420
Fine. Suit yourself.

769
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,549
He's all yours, girls.

770
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,678
All right, dinner's good. Dinner's good.

771
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,389
Yeah. I love dinner.

772
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,808
You know what?
I'm pretty hungry right now.

773
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,894
- What do you say?
- All right. Well, on one condition.

774
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,104
We gotta-

775
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,107
We gotta button you up.
You look like a gay pirate.

776
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,487
- Am I gonna have to call a cab for you?
- No, no, I live here.

777
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,697
Oh, nice building.

778
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,740
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- You could upgrade...

779
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:53,244
- ... if you banked north of 150K a year...
- And fifty thousand dollars!

780
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,954
...like I do!

781
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,374
You gotta learn to say that
in Spanish for Hector.

782
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,878
Wow, that self- deprecating shtick
really works.

783
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,922
I might have to put that back
in my playbook.

784
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,551
I'm genuinely concerned that you might be
missing the entire point of this.

785
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,346
- Good night.
- Well, hang on a second.

786
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,224
Let me help you carry your luggage up.

787
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:20,021
- No. We just met today, sort of.
- What are you talking about?

788
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,230
- No.
- Hey.

789
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,941
We've known each other our whole lives.

790
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,235
It's been too great a night
to end it out here.

791
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,531
You've gotten really good at this.

792
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,328
But you cannot come up.
I don't want this to be a one- night thing.

793
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,664
So you've gotta woo me.

794
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:42,335
Why woo when we can just do?

795
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,961
- Ha, ha.
- Huh?

796
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,756
The wooing is actually not for my benefit.

797
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,676
Mm.

798
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:01,062
I can't believe she called me
on my crap like that.

799
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,066
That is not at all how I remember it.

800
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,737
So, what's next?

801
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:13,824
Well' now we're gonna watch
a romantic montage of you and Jenny...

802
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,619
...set to Cyndi Lauper's
"Time After Time. "

803
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,108
Awake me when
there's an action sequence, will you?

804
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,734
Shh.

805
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,825
- Hello, ladies, how are you?
- Oh, good.

806
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,078
Great. Thank you so much.

807
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,540
Everything was great.
Do you have a dessert menu?

808
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,336
What are you?

809
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:17,596
And then,
after several weeks of wooing...

810
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,186
Ah, here we go.

811
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,605
Whoo!

812
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,278
Oh, yeah.

813
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,114
That was amazing.

814
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:39,285
I can't imagine why.
We only had 20 years of foreplay.

815
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,593
Oh, yeah.

816
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,642
- hat are you doing?
- Uh, I gotta get home.

817
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,479
I got something early in the morning
I gotta take care of.

818
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,398
Yeah, me too. The alarm is already set.

819
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,319
Look, Jenny, I don't, uh, stay over,
you know what I mean?

820
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:17,323
Wait, Connor, listen.
There are two types of women in this world.

821
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,160
Women you shag and leave,
and women you shag and snuggle.

822
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,288
Regrettably,
I'm the shag- and- snuggle kind.

823
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,459
So you have 3 seconds
to get back in this bed where you belong...

824
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,295
.. and where, deep down,
you actually wanna be.

825
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,882
Or you can march out of my apartment
and never call me again.

826
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,592
One...

827
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,677
...two...

828
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,850
Three.

829
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,525
Not as dumb as he looks' folks.

830
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,363
This is the moment
you truly fell in love with Jenny.

831
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,990
You completely let her in.

832
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,995
And this is the moment that you realized
you were spooning.

833
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,959
So you did what you do best.

834
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,240
All right, I don't wanna see this.

835
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,408
Of course not.

836
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,996
I called.

837
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,623
Good. I don't remember calling.

838
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,417
Hello?

839
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,419
Oh.

840
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,755
No, this is Dr. Perotti.

841
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,925
Okay. Yup.

842
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,178
I'll be there in 15.

843
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,763
Okay, good.

844
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:18,694
And that was the last stop
before you officially became Connor Mead.

845
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:23,449
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

846
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,420
after Jenny, your relationships
grew shorter and shorter.

847
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,465
So short, in fact, that it would be easier
to do this in bulk.

848
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,176
- You remember Amy, the stewardess?
- Hey, Connor.

849
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:47,556
We had plane sex somewhere over Albany.
And Rochester. And South Bend, Indiana.

850
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,308
Triple whammy.

851
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,102
You slept with my sister.

852
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,813
I was Shawna back then.
A waitress at the Palm.

853
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,816
- We had coatroom sex on my smoke break.
- That was you?

854
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,949
We dated for two days.

855
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,825
- For an hour.
- For 48 seconds.

856
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,078
- We had sex in your car.
- On your car.

857
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,621
While I washed your car.

858
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,998
- You never called me again.
- Never called again.

859
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,752
Every time you slept with me,
you called me Jenny.

860
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,338
Right. How much more of this do I have?

861
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,756
Um, a lot.

862
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,676
Oh, wow.

863
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,595
Okay, this is getting kind of weird.

864
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,682
We miss you, Connor.
Connor, stay with us.

865
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,476
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

866
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,104
I need you' Connor.
Hey, back off.

867
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,900
Get off!
I'm obsessed with you, Connor.

868
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,443
Get off!

869
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,279
- I love you, Connor!
- Get

870
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,322
Ow!

871
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,076
Nightmare.

872
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,329
Alcohol.

873
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:56,333
It's not complicated.
Our guests are represented by the Allies.

874
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,169
Paul, you and your guests are Nazis.

875
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,921
I'll try not to read into that, sir.

876
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,008
Blue frogmen are non- requisite
support personnel.

877
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:07,386
Waiters, photographers, caterers,
band members and so forth.

878
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,139
Oh, Donna, look.
You got a grenade launcher.

879
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,475
Oh, my God, I love grenade launchers.
Thank you.

880
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,312
Daddy, you're not showing off
your seating chart, are you?

881
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,899
Oh, come on. It's perfect.
It's really impeccable.

882
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,069
I didn't even get a machine gun.

883
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,405
Alcohol. Alcohol.

884
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,161
Alcohol.

885
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,627
What's left in here?

886
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,921
All right.

887
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,476
Oh. Oh. Uh...

888
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,353
Not good.

889
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,106
Okay, not good. Not good.
Where's the leg?

890
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,233
Okay.

891
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,620
Something to hold you up.

892
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,246
Bottle.

893
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,582
Okay, that'll work.

894
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,464
Okay, sarge and Sandy.

895
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,383
Yeah, there you go.

896
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,843
And Paul and Mrs. Volcom.

897
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,470
Try to keep up, son.

898
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,306
- Then the rest of the wedding party joins in.
- Hey.

899
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,600
- ll right.
- Here we go.

900
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,396
Watch out for the flowers.

901
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,651
- Would you like to dance?
- Oh, thank you...

902
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,903
- ... but I'm just watching the-
- Jenny' dance.

903
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,696
Come on.

904
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,951
Oh, nice frame.

905
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,702
I see.

906
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,165
Where'd you learn to dance?

907
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,168
- I spent some time in Colombia.
- What, are you a drug mule?

908
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,920
No, Doctors without Borders.

909
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,174
- I know, he's perfect.
- Shut up.

910
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,520
Hey! Shh, shh.

911
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:32,698
- What else are you ridiculously good at?
- He's certified in shiatsu massage.

912
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,199
Is it weird that I know that?

913
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,160
- Yeah.
- A little. Ha, ha.

914
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,689
What's going? Oh, God.

915
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,192
Oh, my God, the cake.
Did you see what happened?

916
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,693
Oh, my God.

917
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:13,113
Okay, look, these things
are not very well- engineered, all right?

918
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,866
They're very rickety.

919
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,495
- Here we go.
- No!

920
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,581
I can totally fix this.

921
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:29,171
If it's any consolation,
the cake really wasn't very good.

922
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,885
You had a piece?

923
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:38,931
Look, it splattered into my mouth
upon impact, all right?

924
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:45,270
- It was unavoidable.
- It is a wedding cake, you stupid bitch.

925
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,106
Not a rehearsal- dinner cake!

926
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,442
- I hate you!
- No, no, no, Sandy, Sandy. Release.

927
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,027
- Release. Release.
- Aah! Aah!

928
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,780
He's not worth it, sweetheart.

929
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,616
I'm fine. I'm fine.

930
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,035
I am a lady.

931
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,788
I am a professional.

932
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,582
And I'm fine.

933
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,753
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay, see if you can stabilize the bride.

934
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,173
I've got the cake and childcare.
Brad, some shiatsu for Sandra, please?

935
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,925
Let's see some happy faces.

936
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,385
Big happy, big happy.

937
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,595
Oh, where do you think you're going?

938
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,431
- Breathe.
- Let me know if the pressure's okay.

939
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,267
There you go.

940
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,478
- Thank you' Denice.
- Thank you.

941
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,772
- Okay. Oh' that's good.
- She's freaking out.

942
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,400
- I know.
- Connor is ruining the wedding.

943
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,611
He is also ruining
Operation Sex For Every Bridesmaid.

944
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,655
- I almost hooked up with Connor.
- What?

945
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,366
When he told me to go by his room,
the door was locked.

946
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,285
I could hear him talking to himself.

947
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,036
Dude, that guy takes mind games...

948
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,163
...to the next level.
- Old school.

949
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,583
- So who's next?
- I'm up.

950
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,043
Oh, wait. Are you the one
that slept with Paul?

951
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,920
- No.
- Because he won't go there.

952
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,924
- Ew. What?
- That would be me.

953
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,178
- Shut up. Shut your face.
- No. You never told us that.

954
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,849
Well' I'm paying the price. Looks like
I'm gonna have to get plastered...

955
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,685
...and downgrade
to one of Paul's desperate work friends.

956
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,438
I can transmit, page' pilot
and sync channels now.

957
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,858
- What channel are you on?
- Hey, guys, holster them.

958
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,611
Why?
- Women.

959
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,945
Oh.

960
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,156
- Say it isn't so.
- They're so weird.

961
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:26,747
- Yeah, somebody is enjoying this a little bit.
- Ha, ha. Are you kidding me?

962
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,709
Connor Mead, cleaning up his own mess.
I am loving it.

963
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,212
You know what? I'm sorry.

964
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,299
It's a cake.
There'll be a bakery open in town.

965
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,344
I'm not talking about this.

966
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:44,848
I'm talking about us. You know?

967
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,476
How it played out.

968
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,978
You're actually apologizing, aren't you?

969
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,065
Okay, we don't need
to make a production out of it, now.

970
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,901
How are things looking? Spick- and- span?
Any more spots?

971
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:00,739
You know, it was probably'
in some small way, partially my fault.

972
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,742
- I was always attracted to assholes.
- Thank you very much.

973
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,704
Well' you know what I mean, though.
Prejects. Guys that I thought I could fix.

974
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,332
Probably has something to do
With my dad.

975
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,460
- Probably.
- After you left, I made a vow to myself...

976
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,338
...to date only fully functional,
Well- adjusted men.

977
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:22,052
- No more works- in- progress. No dirtbags.
- So basically, women.

978
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,887
Basically women.

979
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:29,601
So how strong of a vow
is your no- dirtbags policy?

980
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,312
I had it tattooed on my ass.

981
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,650
- Can I see?
- No.

982
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,861
- Wait, what are you doing?
- What?

983
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,446
- hat?
- What am I doing? Wha?

984
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:46,243
Okay, look. I know I dropped the ball
before a bit, but I have changed, I swear.

985
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,869
- No, you haven't.
- No, I have.

986
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:52,249
Jenny, I'm seeing things
in a whole different way tonight.

987
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:56,002
ll right? I love you. I think.
I mean, I always have.

988
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:59,631
- You're the one I was supposed to be with.
- Wait, Connor, stop it. Just-

989
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:03,927
I hear what you're saying,
and I think right now you actually believe it.

990
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,556
- Yeah.
- But I know you.

991
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,309
Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up.

992
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,396
You won't be there.

993
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:19,234
Okay, but, Jenny, I really, really don't
Wanna be alone tonight' you know?

994
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,737
- Okay. No, I get it.
- Will you please stay with me?

995
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,490
Seriously!
Jenny, I've got ghosts in my bedroom!

996
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,496
- Hello, Connor.
- Aah!

997
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,666
Dude.

998
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,670
What does a girl have to do
to get laid at this wedding?

999
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:45,343
Yeah. Four Seasons, please.

1000
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,476
- Come on, start. Aah!
- Where do you think you're going?

1001
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:59,524
Oh, Mel. God, you don't know
how happy I am to see you.

1002
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,860
Aah!

1003
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,113
Really, did you learn nothing
from the last ghost?

1004
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,616
- You're the ghost of girlfriends present?
- Mm- hm.

1005
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,118
- That makes no sense.
- Oh, tell me about it.

1006
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,538
But as sad as it is,
I'm the only consistent woman in your life.

1007
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:17,876
So here I am,
just working on the weekend. Again.

1008
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,544
But we never...

1009
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,213
I mean, you...

1010
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,423
- You're totally gay, right?
- What?

1011
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,633
You're not?

1012
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,887
No. There was just one time in college.
I went to Barnard.

1013
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,639
- Okay.
- I had no choice.

1014
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,390
Hey, I'm sorry, Mel.

1015
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,143
If I'd have known,
I would of hit on you a lot sooner.

1016
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,229
Aw. Ha, ha.

1017
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:41,066
- Ow! What was that for?
- Because tonight, I'm the boss.

1018
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,692
You ready?

1019
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,407
What are you doing?

1020
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:54,913
Aren't we gonna, like,
fly off or something?

1021
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,834
It's the present, you idiot.
We're here already.

1022
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:05,173
Mel.

1023
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,094
Okay, no. That is not what I said.
I don't care.

1024
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,429
He's a beautiful piece of a man.

1025
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:15,725
Hey, look at how much fun they're having
now that you're gone.

1026
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,727
- He's not shallow.
- Shallow?

1027
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,730
Honey, he spends every Christmas alone
at the Knicks game.

1028
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,023
Yeah, he is all surface.

1029
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,777
Yeah, but in his defense,
it's a really hot surface.

1030
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,071
- Well, yeah.
- Okay, he's not that bad.

1031
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,658
- Thank you' Paulie.
- Paul, he hit on your mother in law.

1032
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,619
- I've banged worse.
- Thank you' Vonda.

1033
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,371
Oh!

1034
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,791
You guys just don't know him like I do.
You don't.

1035
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,294
You know, that guy practically raised me.

1036
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:48,008
I was 2 when our parents died.
Connor was just 7.

1037
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:54,097
You know, at an age when he's supposed
to be a kid, he's busy taking care of one.

1038
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,641
He taught me how to read.

1039
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:00,979
He taught me how to ride a bike.

1040
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:06,067
He beat the crap out of any kid
Who ever teased me.

1041
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:10,572
You know, he always said,
"Paulie, it's you and me against the world. "

1042
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:17,162
My point is, I had the opportunity
to be a nice kid and Connor didn't.

1043
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:21,166
Now, I know he seems like a joke
to you guys...

1044
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:26,588
...and trust me, you all have fair points,
but that guy is the only family I've got.

1045
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,590
And if there's one thing family does...

1046
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:33,678
.. it is believe, against all odds'
in the best of each other.

1047
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,185
I love him.

1048
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:44,356
And as long as I live,
I'll believe he can change, because he's...

1049
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,359
He's my big brother.

1050
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,032
I'm gonna call my brother.

1051
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,784
It's been a while.

1052
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,371
Of course,
that doesn't mean anything to you.

1053
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:02,040
Because love doesn't exist, right?

1054
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:06,336
It's just, "magical comfort food
for the weak and uneducated"?

1055
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:11,758
Wow, that is as close as I will ever come
to feeling something for Connor Mead.

1056
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,386
- Kudos.
- I saw you chatting him up at the bar.

1057
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:20,058
Well' I still wanna do him,
but now I'll be scrumping a tragic figure.

1058
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:24,479
Ooh, like when Denice hooked up
With Gary Coleman at Lollapalooza.

1059
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:29,234
I was drunk
and he had such delicate hands.

1060
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,613
Denice, you think that's bad? I mean,
look at what Connor is doing to poor Jenny.

1061
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,825
He has got that girl so twisted up
into a pretzel...

1062
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,245
...she can't even appreciate
that fine slice of wedding beefoake...

1063
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,248
...that Sandy has flown in for her.

1064
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,916
Hua! Ha, ha.

1065
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,087
Heard, understood, acknowledged?

1066
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,259
Jenny, she's just-

1067
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,805
Jenny.

1068
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:10,233
- Oh, Jesus. Is she okay?
- What do you think?

1069
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,776
Jenny?

1070
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:16,364
Oh, of course.
Sensitive Brad to the rescue.

1071
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:21,119
Now, wait a second, are you actually trying
to repair this wedding cake?

1072
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,121
Maybe.

1073
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:27,792
- I mean, a little.
- I used to moonlight as a pastry chef.

1074
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,962
- Tell me this guy's gay.
- He's not. Trust me.

1075
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,214
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1076
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,969
You wanna talk about it?

1077
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,139
As your designated wedding sex'
everything you say is privileged.

1078
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,099
No, I just...

1079
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:47,479
I mean, it's been like a decade
since Connor and I- You know.

1080
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,733
But I see him again, and I am just right back
to where I was before.

1081
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,153
My attending in med school used to say
that doctors never break up...

1082
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:59,616
.. We just go into remission. We're naturally
drawn to the most hopeless patients.

1083
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,660
The irredeemably screwed up.
The terminal cases.

1084
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:06,831
- We get the point, Brad.
- It's just embarrassing, you know?

1085
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:09,084
I think you only really
get over somebody...

1086
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,670
...when you find somebody else
that you care about more.

1087
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,507
All right, this is a nightmare.

1088
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,175
I'm bringing them together.

1089
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,803
- This is a mess.
- He's really cute too.

1090
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,681
No, no, no. No way.
Jenny doesn't go for guys like this.

1091
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,935
No, clearly not. Come on, let's go.

1092
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,687
No, no, no. Now hang on.
Let's see how this plays out.

1093
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,481
Okay. You're the boss.

1094
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,691
Really?

1095
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,195
- Such a shvantza.
- What the hell was that fo?

1096
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,533
I just can't believe he broke up with us
on a conference call.

1097
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,284
How did he fool all of us?

1098
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,453
Yeah, but the weirdest thing, really...

1099
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,164
...it seems like he wanted us
to fall in love with him.

1100
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:53,711
And once we did, or thought we did,
he just disappeared.

1101
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,548
How messed up is that?

1102
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,842
Come on, Kiki. Don't cry.

1103
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,219
t least Connor brought us
all together, right?

1104
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,639
Hey, there we go, Charlece.
That's the winning attitude, huh?

1105
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,558
Way to look on the bright side.

1106
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:10,728
You've already got new relationships,
new friendships, right?

1107
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,522
Here we go.

1108
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,817
It's so exciting to have people over.
Martini?

1109
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,069
- Oh, this is your apartment?
- Liquor, good.

1110
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,279
Mel.

1111
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:23,992
I've got apple, bubble gum or tandoori.

1112
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,744
I know it sounds gross'
but drink two of them...

1113
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,247
...and you won't be able
to feel your face. Cheers.

1114
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,874
You brought them together?

1115
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:35,628
Come on. Don't be sad, you whiny bitches.
Connor's not worth it.

1116
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:38,923
He's like the Tin Man.
He was born without a heart.

1117
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,593
And' ladies, know this:

1118
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,345
That wherever
Connor lays his head tonight...

1119
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:48,850
.. When the sun comes up in the morning,
he will be all alone.

1120
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,854
Well' I'll drink to that.
I feel much better.

1121
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,236
So how you holding up, Dutch?

1122
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,615
- Not too great.
- Yeah.

1123
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,119
Why do all these women hate me?

1124
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,622
You know, I don't hate them.

1125
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:14,417
Woman love to be screwed,
they just don't like to be screwed over.

1126
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,878
I know, it's annoying.

1127
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:22,383
Yeah. I mean- Look, all right,
maybe I've hurt a few women in my time.

1128
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:27,972
few women? Dutch, please.
Don't con a con man.

1129
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:36,856
- Oh, is this weather tricks?
- No tricks' Dutch.

1130
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:42,487
These are all the lady tears
that have been shed for you in your life.

1131
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:51,996
And these...

1132
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:58,336
These are the tissues they used
to dry those tears.

1133
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,674
And these are the chocolates you sent.

1134
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:08,179
Right. You don't send chocolates.
They go straight to the hips.

1135
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,347
Right.

1136
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,684
And these are all the condoms you used.

1137
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,018
No.

1138
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:17,355
No! No! No!

1139
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:32,620
No, don't!
Get off! Get off!

1140
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:35,415
Don't! You're out of control!
Shut up!

1141
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:36,874
Man' oh' man.

1142
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,545
You guys are not gonna believe
Whatjust happened to me in my car.

1143
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,050
Is this about the cake?

1144
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:49,804
This is not about the cake. This is about
the fact that Paul slept with Donna.

1145
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,057
Information that you so kindly shared
With Denice earlier tonight.

1146
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:56,561
Come on. All right, number one,
that was years ago.

1147
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,188
There seems to be some debate
about the time line.

1148
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:03,109
No, there is no debate. We were going out.
We were together.

1149
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,820
- You cheated.
- We had just met. But you're right.

1150
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:10,033
You're right. That's not important. What's
important is that I hurt you. Listen, baby-

1151
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,161
You know what? Don't "listen, baby" me.
You had sex with her...

1152
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:17,206
...and then you didn't even tell me.
I mean, what else don't I know about you?

1153
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:20,043
Nothing. Nothing. There is nothing else.

1154
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,546
Okay, I am so sorry.
Sweetie, I never meant to hurt you.

1155
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:28,926
Cool. Right there. Hey, he said it.
He's sorry. He means it. Case closed.

1156
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:33,598
"Case closed. " Because one apology
makes everything all better, right, Connor?

1157
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:38,353
No, Jenny. What makes it okay
is that Paul still clearly loves her.

1158
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,272
Oh, you're the expert on love.
You don't even believe in it.

1159
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,485
If I can tell that you two love each other,
then you must really love each other.

1160
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,945
You know I do, honey.
I love you so much.

1161
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:52,283
That girl's been acting like a mental patient
for 12 hours. He's still here.

1162
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,659
- Shut up.
- The point is...

1163
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:55,745
...how does she even trust him anymore?

1164
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:59,123
Whoa, are you talking about my brother,
or are you talking about me?

1165
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:03,252
Let's not forget, this all went down
With your dear friend Donna over there.

1166
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,798
fact your little estrogen lynch mob
seems to have forgotten.

1167
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:12,095
Seriously, if you ruled out marrying anyone
that your bridesmaids have slept with...

1168
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,597
.. you're gonna have to go abroad
to get a husband.

1169
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,599
Go to hell, Connor.

1170
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,975
Sandy-
- Paulie, come on-

1171
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:22,313
- Connor, I want you to leave.
- You better air these things out-

1172
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,315
Connor, leave!

1173
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:29,112
God, you have done nothing
but make this weekend worse for everyone.

1174
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:33,741
- Sandy!
- Paulie!

1175
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,995
Hey, come on. Hey, Paulie.
Hey, hey, man. Look, I'm sorry.

1176
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,998
They were right.
I never should have invited you.

1177
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,419
You know, for years
I keep trying to convince myself...

1178
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,004
...there's something redeemable in you.

1179
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:48,631
I'm done. There isn't.

1180
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,300
I was just trying to get your back
in there, okay?

1181
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:57,265
- It's you and me against the world, right?
- You don't wanna be here.

1182
01:13:58,016 --> 01:13:59,851
And nobody wants you here.

1183
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:02,603
So just go. Jus- Please?

1184
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,272
Sandy!

1185
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:13,156
I know I've got
one more ghost left on my contract...

1186
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:16,200
...but I've been asked
to leave the premises!

1187
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:19,454
So if you want me, come on!

1188
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:23,666
Of course, I wouldn't mind seeing
my future girlfriends.

1189
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:28,171
Frankly, that was the ghost
I was most looking forward to!

1190
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,047
But whatever!

1191
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:47,523
Whoa.

1192
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,531
Are you my future girlfriend?

1193
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:03,706
Would you like to be?

1194
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,635
Oh, hell, no.

1195
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,554
I get married?

1196
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:08,312
Oh.

1197
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,982
Okay, this could work.

1198
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:16,612
As a matter of fact, this may be all right.

1199
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:20,199
Brad?

1200
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,076
No.

1201
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,955
No, no, no.

1202
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:30,084
and now, if anyone here knows any reason
Why these two should not be wed...

1203
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,086
I do.
... let them speak now...

1204
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,255
No, Jenny,
you're supposed to be with me.

1205
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:39,760
She was always supposed to be with me.
No. Don't do this. This is wrong. No.

1206
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:44,557
No! I'm here. I'm here.
Jenny. I'm here. No.

1207
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,976
No!

1208
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:19,133
Oh, Paulie.

1209
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,973
No wedding ring.

1210
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,394
Wait a minute. He didn't get married?

1211
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,647
Why?

1212
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,067
Me?

1213
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:39,695
What did I do?

1214
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:44,408
You don't say much, do you?

1215
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,877
Looks like we're' uh' all here.

1216
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,797
Let's begin.

1217
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:43,467
Lord, we are gathered here today
to lay to rest Connor Mead.

1218
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,889
Connor Mead was a great man
and a great friend of the Church.

1219
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:52,977
- There's only one person at my funeral?
- That's the way it works, Dutch.

1220
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,856
Guys like us...

1221
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,774
...we don't get the big funeral.

1222
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:03,112
I didn't expect big, Uncle Wayne,
but this is ridiculous.

1223
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:07,616
Yeah, I don't know how
to soften this one for you, Dutch. Uh...

1224
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,287
Nobody's really gonna miss you.

1225
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:16,375
efore the burial, would you like to say
a few words about the deceased?

1226
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,680
Connor Mead...

1227
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,600
...was a lot of things to a lot of people.

1228
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:35,352
Not all of them good things...

1229
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,814
...but to me he was a great brother.

1230
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:44,612
Guess it's just me against the world now.

1231
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:48,616
No, it's not, Paulie. No, it's not.
Look, it doesn't have to happen like this.

1232
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,203
- It's not gonna happen-
- Nothing you can do about it, Dutch.

1233
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:55,748
You made your bed, now you gotta bang
Whatever crawls into it.

1234
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:59,126
That's what I keep trying to tell you.
What can I say?

1235
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:02,880
Life, you know,
it's like a quick cup of coffoe.

1236
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,883
You haven't got the guts
to love someone with all you got...

1237
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,719
- ... then you end up drinking alone.
- No. No, Uncle Wayne-

1238
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:11,388
- Sorry, kid. Party's over.
- Aah!

1239
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,183
- Ladies, let's take it away.
- Whoa.

1240
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:18,187
No! No! I can change! I swear!

1241
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,565
No! No!

1242
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:25,653
I can change! I swear! I can change! Aah!

1243
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:32,868
I'm alive.

1244
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,335
I'm alive!

1245
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,339
You there, young man. What day is it?

1246
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:46,590
Is it Christmas?

1247
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:50,636
No, it's Saturday, you moron.

1248
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:53,430
That's the day of my brother's wedding.

1249
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:56,433
All right, I haven't missed it, thank God.

1250
01:20:56,601 --> 01:21:02,773
Let's get ready for nuptials!

1251
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:08,696
Hey, hey, Paulie. Hey. Hey.

1252
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:12,700
- Did I miss the wedding?
- No. You got your wish.

1253
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,119
Sandra called it off.
- What?

1254
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,079
- hy?
- Why do you think?

1255
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,248
- The thing I let slip about Donna?
- Yeah.

1256
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,459
No, no, no. You can't split up.

1257
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:25,129
You are meant
to spend the rest of your lives together.

1258
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:29,425
- You're gonna be miserable without her.
- You can be a real sarcastic prick.

1259
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:33,137
I am not being sarcastic, okay?
Where's Sandra?

1260
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:37,057
Sarge is taking her and the bridesmaids
to the airport. It's over.

1261
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,559
No.

1262
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,811
No, no, no.

1263
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,482
Whoa.

1264
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,078
Sandra!

1265
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,271
What are you doing?

1266
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:34,198
Whoo! Whoo!

1267
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,661
Aah! No seat belts!

1268
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,542
Sandra!

1269
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,128
Hey!

1270
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:51,382
Sandra, you're making a huge mistake!

1271
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,717
Was that Connor?

1272
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,013
Sandra!

1273
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:00,808
Come on.

1274
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:02,851
Oh, shit.

1275
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:13,654
- Dad, stop!
- Aah!

1276
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:16,240
Sarge, stop.

1277
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,742
- Is that Connor?
- You could a killed us back there.

1278
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,161
- Sandra, lock the door. Get away.
- Sandra.

1279
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:25,374
- Sarge' I need to talk to your daughter.
- Over my dead body, Paco.

1280
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,876
All right? Relax.

1281
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,379
Oh, my God.

1282
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:34,091
- I'm sorry, sir. I've come too far. Sandra.
- Sandra, stay in the car.

1283
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:36,010
Did he just lock us?

1284
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,387
- Don't you touch me.
- Now, you listen to me.

1285
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,764
Okay, first off:

1286
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,934
I am sorry about destroying
your wedding cake...

1287
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:48,105
...going to second base with your mother,
knocking your dad unconscious right there...

1288
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,275
...and basically
breaking up your wedding.

1289
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:55,279
I'm sorry.
That being said, I am begging you...

1290
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,115
...begging you, don't run away' all right?

1291
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:02,077
You and Paul have something so rare,
all right, so powerful.

1292
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:04,872
- Don't chicken out now.
- Chicken out? He cheated.

1293
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,415
Oh, get over it.

1294
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:10,377
It was years ago' all right?
With some slutty friend of yours.

1295
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,046
Yeah, well, that's true.

1296
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,840
A friend, incidentally,
Who you're not even mad at.

1297
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:18,260
And you know why?
Because you don't actually care.

1298
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:21,764
You love Paul so much,
you forgave him the second you heard.

1299
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:23,223
And that's what scares you.

1300
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,517
You have no idea how I feel.
You have no idea.

1301
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:29,396
Yes, I do. I've been in your shoes.

1302
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,107
You know what?
It scared the hell out of me too.

1303
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:37,154
What if she hurt me?
You know, what if she left me?

1304
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,448
What if she died?

1305
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,408
It'd have been the end of me.

1306
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:46,497
So I cut it short, before she ever could.
And you know what?

1307
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:50,459
It was the biggest mistake
I have ever made.

1308
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,377
You're making that same mistake now...

1309
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:55,005
...and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit by and watch.

1310
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,966
You gotta risk love, Sandra. Risk it.

1311
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:05,140
I didn't. Look at me.
I'm an empty, lonely, ghost of a man.

1312
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:09,311
It doesn't mean
that you're never gonna get hurt.

1313
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:12,064
But I can guarantee you this:

1314
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:13,982
Any pain that you feel...

1315
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:19,363
...will never, ever compare to the regret
that comes from walking away from love.

1316
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,534
As someone who's felt a lot of both'
trust me.

1317
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,077
Pain...

1318
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:31,041
...beats regret every day of the week,
and twice on Sunday.

1319
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:33,961
Don't run away.

1320
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,046
Don't do it.

1321
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,553
I can't believe I'm saying this...

1322
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,889
...but, uh, I think you might be right.

1323
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:48,934
So...

1324
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,854
...you wanna get married?

1325
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,400
- I do.
You do?

1326
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,652
- Yeah, I do.
- You do?

1327
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,779
Yes.

1328
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:02,281
- Yes.
- Okay.

1329
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,577
Whoo!

1330
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:15,919
Oh, baby.

1331
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:22,467
Flowers, check. Cake, check.
Dinner, check.

1332
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:26,722
- Photographer?
- Ooh, I know a pretty good photographer.

1333
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:47,367
Shall we begin?

1334
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:51,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
We are here to witness the union...

1335
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:55,334
...of Sandra Marie Volcom and Paul Mead.

1336
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:58,128
At them.

1337
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:09,598
It was cold and dark.
We'd been taking fire for hours.

1338
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,309
We took an incoming mortar hit.

1339
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:15,687
I opened up his jacket
and his insides fell out...

1340
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:18,774
...and I had his bloody guts in my hand.

1341
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:22,152
They were warm and mushy and squishy.

1342
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:25,656
And I pushed them right back
into his body cavity...

1343
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:28,992
...and willed him to live with my tears.

1344
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,870
And that is what true love is.

1345
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:33,538
Hua!

1346
01:27:37,168 --> 01:27:38,669
I've heard that story a hundred times.

1347
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:42,798
Um...

1348
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:47,803
I guess now's as good a time as any
for me to make my best man's toast.

1349
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:53,183
I've never given one of these before,
so, uh, bear with me.

1350
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,311
Someone once told me...

1351
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:00,649
.. that the power in all relationships
lies with whoever cares less.

1352
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:03,026
And he was right.

1353
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,404
But power isn't happiness.

1354
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:07,030
And...

1355
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:09,574
...I think that maybe happiness comes...

1356
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:15,205
...from caring more about people,
rather than less.

1357
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:20,669
And nobody proves that better
than my kid brother, Paulie.

1358
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:25,215
Buddy, you give love to everyone...

1359
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,718
...and you require none in return.

1360
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:33,598
From this day on'
I wanna be more like you.

1361
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:36,727
I want you to be proud of me again.

1362
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:38,729
Yeah.

1363
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:43,025
And here's to my new sister.

1364
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:47,279
You know, Sandra, all I can really say...

1365
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:51,074
...all that I know for sure...

1366
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:54,036
...is that Mom and Dad...

1367
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,581
...they would've loved you.

1368
01:28:58,082 --> 01:29:00,834
And I'm glad you're part of our family.

1369
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:04,171
- Here's to Paul and Sandra, right here.
- Yeah, to Paul and Sandra.

1370
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,019
Look here. Look right here.

1371
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,771
Okay. And how old are you?

1372
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:24,691
Who's in the middle? Look over here.

1373
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:27,694
All right. Go dance, drink eggnog.

1374
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:29,863
- Hey, sexy cameraman.
- Hey, ladies.

1375
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,949
- Connor, we're really worried about you.
- Need we remind you...

1376
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:36,787
...as man- Whore in residence, you have
certain duties to the single ladies here?

1377
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:40,916
That is very tempting, ladies, it is.

1378
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:43,919
- But, uh, I'm out.
- No.

1379
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:46,755
Ladies, thank you, but no thank you.
Hmm?

1380
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:50,842
Hey, hard- to- get only works
if you eventually give in.

1381
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,220
One more time.

1382
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,306
- Hey.
- Good night.

1383
01:30:20,623 --> 01:30:24,126
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

1384
01:30:24,293 --> 01:30:27,295
You did it.
You pulled off a great wedding.

1385
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,673
We pulled off a great wedding.

1386
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:33,468
Of course, if I wouldn't have broken it,
it wouldn't have needed fixing.

1387
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:36,221
- True, true, true.
- Ha, ha.

1388
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:40,517
- Okay, I have to know.
- Mm.

1389
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,812
What happened to you last night?

1390
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,816
Because yesterday, you were just
your usual handsome, awful self.

1391
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:51,027
But then today,
you became the guy I used to know.

1392
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:56,867
The one I always thought, deep down,
you actually were.

1393
01:30:57,034 --> 01:31:00,537
I honestly don't know
What the hell happened to me last night.

1394
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:05,542
I don't. But I do know that
I'm seeing things more clearly today...

1395
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,961
...than any time that I can remember.

1396
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,046
Like the way I feel about you.

1397
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:14,676
That's something that has never changed.

1398
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,764
I wish I could believe you.

1399
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:23,894
We've just been through this before...

1400
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:30,066
...so how do I know it's notjust
another line from the Mead- family playbook?

1401
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,402
Hmm.

1402
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,750
You remember her?

1403
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:53,965
You kept it.

1404
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:57,052
Yeah.

1405
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:00,555
I've had that on me
since the day I took it.

1406
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:03,558
I can't believe it.

1407
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:07,354
Give me one more chance.

1408
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,606
I'll do better.

1409
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:14,528
Whatever it takes.
The wooing' the spooning, I am all in.

1410
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:17,280
Even massages with our clothes on?

1411
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:20,575
No. No, that's where I draw the line.

1412
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:22,619
- ell?
- No massages with clothes on.

1413
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,788
Not a chance.

1414
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:27,666
I promise you this:

1415
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:30,210
When you wake up in the morning...

1416
01:32:32,672 --> 01:32:34,214
...I'll be there.

1417
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,716
Every time.

1418
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,576
What?

1419
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:04,452
What is it?

1420
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:06,037
Ha, ha. Nothing.

1421
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,166
I just recognize this song.

1422
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,837
Oh, yeah.

1423
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:18,758
- May I have this dance?
- Finally.

1424
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:22,387
- Pete Hastings, eat your heart out.
- Ha, ha.

1425
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:28,143
That's how it's done, Dutch.

1426
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:30,770
That's how it's done.

1427
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:36,901
Well' work's over. What do you say, doll?
Let's get naked.

1428
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,696
Mm.

1429
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:43,074
Dry. I love it.

1430
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,536
You know, I'm interviewing
for a new secretary.

1431
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:49,706
- Mm?
- How good is your dictation?

1432
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,208
You get it? "Dick- tation"?

1433
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:56,880
Please, I'm actually at this party.

1434
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:11,645
Hi.

1435
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:22,656
Looks like it's just you and me, sweetie.

1436
01:34:23,407 --> 01:34:26,534
Oh, I love those scrunchies.

1437
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:29,329
Ew, ha, ha.

1438
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,581
I'm, like' 16.

1439
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:35,919
We're ghosts, baby. We're ageless.

1440
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:57,691
Okay, Connor Mead's out. Who's next?

1441
01:34:57,858 --> 01:34:59,442
Paul's desperate work friends?

1442
01:35:00,444 --> 01:35:02,779
- Yeah. I'm back to you.
- I think I'm loosening up.

1443
01:35:03,447 --> 01:35:05,573
- Let's do this thing.
- Yeah, all right.

1444
01:35:05,741 --> 01:35:07,909
Okay, I get the little one.
- You can have him.

1445
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:11,705
- Okay.
- I said, I get the little one.

1446
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

1447
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:17,836
- You're so cute.
- You lookjust like my sister. Why would I?

1448
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:21,297
Mind if I cut in?

1449
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:33,810
You know, it makes me happy.

1450
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:39,315
You did a wonderful job with her, Von.

1451
01:35:39,483 --> 01:35:42,152
So did you, Mervis.

1452
01:35:44,363 --> 01:35:47,991
You repeat that name to anyone,
you're a dead man.

1453
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,168
- Sandy' right here.
- No, no.

1454
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:08,219
Kako.

1455
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:15,018
Yes.

1456
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,816
What? What did?
