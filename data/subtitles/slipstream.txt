1
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,721
I was talking
to Noah last night.

2
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,785
You know, Noah,
my brother-in-law.

3
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:06,320
Yeah, and he was telling me
about this storm they were having,

4
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,699
and he said to me,
"Bette, Bette dear,

5
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,501
this is retribution
from on high."

6
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,202
Yeah, I know, I know.

7
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,539
What's that, dear?

8
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,979
Oh, yes, I heard.

9
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,016
Poor old Felix.

10
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,881
How are the boys taking it?

11
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,750
No, well, you never know, do you?

12
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,450
Yeah, you've gotta enjoy life.

13
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,623
You know,
when my little Ruthie died,

14
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,391
I started looking in the mirror
every morning...

15
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,763
<i>You are bringing</i>
<i>the writer up here.</i>

16
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,827
...and I'd say,
"Bette, Bette, honey, this is it, girl.

17
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,394
"The show's on the road,

18
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,670
and you've to get get up
and get at 'em."

19
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,233
Yeah...

20
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,906
Oh, it'll be lovely to see you again...

21
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,711
Well, do you think you'll ever
get out this way?

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,786
Oh, I'm going to Las Vegas.

23
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,192
Tomorrow. Going up to see
my sister-in-law...

24
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,958
my sister-in-law, Sandra, yeah.

25
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:16,832
And Gina, my niece...
well, I call her my niece...

26
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,667
is driving me up there
in the morning.

27
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,730
We're going to take Sandra
to a show.

28
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,901
Sandra's lived there all her life,

29
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,706
and she's never been to a show!

30
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,609
Isn't that something, huh?

31
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,646
Listen, I'll talk to you soon,
sweetie pie.

32
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,379
Bye.

33
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,316
Did you see that?

34
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,089
Felix?

35
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,463
Can we go now?

36
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,135
- What happened?
- It's over.

37
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,474
- It's over?
- Do a rewrite!

38
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,946
- Yeah?
- Let's get out of here.

39
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,979
Come on, Felix.

40
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,278
Come on.

41
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,927
One decaf, no sugar,
extra-foam latte.

42
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,057
- One iced tea.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,431
- Thanks, Lily.
- You're welcome.

44
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,764
How did the reading go?

45
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,498
My agent thinks I have a really
good chance, so who knows?

46
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,870
- You'll do fine.
- Thanks.

47
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,670
From your mouth to God's ear.

48
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,142
<i>- Cut!</i>
- This is my friend Felix.

49
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,612
Hi, Felix. Like the cat.

50
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,615
- That's funny.
- Felix the Cat.

51
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,715
Nine lives.

52
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,880
That's Lily. She's sweet.

53
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,753
She's from Russia
and wants to be in movies.

54
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,314
She's my new best friend.

55
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,724
Hello?

56
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,820
Hello? Hello?

57
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,795
Anyway, where was I?

58
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,465
Right, this woman Shelley.

59
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,973
She says you go back
through past lives, incarnations,

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,134
and you get in touch with everything
that makes you do stuff in this life.

61
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,610
Say you were an addict or nuts
or, like, stuck in old habits.

62
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,772
You have fears of elevators
and spiders and snakes

63
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,373
or stuff like clowns and opera singers,
anything freaky...

64
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,544
it all comes up through
past-life regression

65
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,747
so you get pulled back
through the slipstream.

66
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,052
It's karma... Indian stuff
from millions of years ago.

67
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,955
The Akashic records
or something like that.

68
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,516
This woman,
she is totally awesome.

69
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,357
It's awesome.
Totally awesome.

70
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,023
...past-life regression,
pulled through the slipstream.

71
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,034
...walk you through this stuff,
get you to clean your side of the street.

72
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,593
My yoga teacher told me about her.
You ought to try yoga.

73
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,035
You ought to try yoga,
and wheatgrass and colonics.

74
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,202
She charges $300 an hour.
She's got this place in Culver City.

75
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,372
Her name's Shelley something.
It's one of those names you can't say.

76
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,042
- Anyway, her first name's Shelley...
- Hello?

77
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,484
A poodle called Tiddles,
but you go into her place,

78
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,454
and she does this channeling,
these aura readings.

79
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,957
- Oh, she says that all this...
- Where was I?

80
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,254
...an illusion, a dream.

81
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,124
Felix? That's all it is.

82
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,757
"A dream within a dream."

83
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,358
What?

84
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,371
"A dream within a dream."
Edgar Allan Poe.

85
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,999
Sorry, I overheard you talking.

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,277
A dream within a dream.

87
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,948
That's so cool.

88
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:28,960
Anyway, she's got this really stinky dog,
but cute, called Tiddles.

89
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,530
Felix!

90
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,361
- What's your problem, man?
- No problem.

91
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,958
- What's your problem!
- No problem.

92
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,333
Get out of there.

93
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,165
What's your problem?
What's wrong with you!

94
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,208
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:22,904
We've lost the plot!
We've lost the plot!

96
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,780
We've lost the plot.

97
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,616
Hey, you! Get out of my car.

98
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,348
Call 911, please! Somebody help!

99
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,085
Do something, please!

100
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,683
Help, help.

101
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,394
No! We've lost the plot!

102
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,032
Watch out. My name's Gavin.
You mind? This is great!

103
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,043
Hey, this is digital, man.
Film is out. It's obsolete.

104
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,976
This is digital, man.

105
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,377
Welcome to America.

106
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,043
Oh, my God, this is insane.

107
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,106
Awesome.

108
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,363
Can you tell us what happened?

109
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,834
This is guy was getting out
of his car and going crazy.

110
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,565
...have any reason why,
he started shooting.

111
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,199
- He really...
- I was trying to call 911,

112
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,867
and no one was helping me.

113
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,706
Then these guys
came out of nowhere...

114
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,643
He got off a few shots.

115
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,443
<i>Shooting mostly Democrats.</i>

116
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,575
I mean, I didn't know what to do.

117
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,212
It was complete pandemonium
on this freeway, man,

118
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,190
and there was a man
sitting in a car, staring at...

119
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,885
Of course, I was terrified. I mean...

120
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,918
Can you describe what happened?

121
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,659
I saw the guy in this vehicle, the beat-up
one with Pennsylvania plates,

122
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,394
just get out and lose
his fucking mind.

123
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,302
- La-la land.
- I was terrified.

124
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,599
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

125
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,849
We're here.

126
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,423
We are?

127
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,517
Yeah.

128
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,757
What do they put in that stuff,
what is it, "blatte"?

129
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,958
What do you mean?

130
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,627
You've been out of it
for three hours, dead to the world.

131
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,672
I didn't sleep much last night.

132
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,273
- <i>Felix?</i>
- Wh...

133
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,139
Look at that sky.

134
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,114
<i>Felix!</i>

135
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,047
You want to come in?

136
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,085
No, I've gotta get back.

137
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,676
I've gotta get back.

138
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:46,850
Okay.

139
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,099
See you tomorrow.
Same time.

140
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,396
Same time.

141
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,529
- See you.
- Drive safe.

142
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,698
I will.

143
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,786
Hello?

144
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,833
What?
Channels four and seven.

145
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,531
Come on, you're not serious!

146
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,444
Oh, my God, I am on TV!

147
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,072
<i>... and he shoots</i>
<i>this woman in a car,</i>

148
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,708
<i>and he's yelling something,</i>
<i>I don't even know what.</i>

149
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,542
<i>Police commended the men...</i>

150
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,645
Oh, my God, I look horrible!

151
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,589
God! Not that bad.

152
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,060
Stormy!

153
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,793
Mommy's gonna be a movie star!

154
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,532
Look! Look, look.

155
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,563
Oh, listen, where are you?
Are you in the bar?

156
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,907
<i>- Are you in there now?</i>
- Gina!

157
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,343
Why didn't he wake me?

158
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,346
I can't believe you slept through it.

159
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,403
Who were you with?

160
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,382
- Felix Bonhoeffer.
- Who's he?

161
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,045
The older gentleman
in the red convertible Impala.

162
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,849
- Gina!
- Okay.

163
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,085
Listen, I've gotta go. Mort's being
a real pain in the butt tonight.

164
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,752
<i>... shot him at point-blank range.</i>

165
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,422
<i>The gunman was heard</i>
<i>screaming at other drivers,</i>

166
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,896
<i>"We've lost the plot!"</i>

167
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,364
I'm not going to be here next week

168
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,060
because I'm driving
my aunt up to Vegas.

169
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,160
I'll call you as soon as I get back.

170
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,569
Gina, would you come on
and get off the phone now?

171
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,664
Look, I'm sorry...

172
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,072
It's playing in there now?

173
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,042
<i>... and that, folks,</i>
<i>is the way it happened.</i>

174
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,169
<i>Well, I'm not a crook.</i>

175
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,577
<i>Thanks so much forjoining me</i>
<i>and have a great night.</i>

176
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,240
- Women!
- Yeah!

177
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,213
I need you here.

178
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,720
Hey, Gav, how's Brian?

179
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,814
How you feeling?

180
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,660
<i>Right, this woman Shelley.</i>

181
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,220
<i>Good night.</i>

182
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,811
<i>Good night.</i>

183
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,558
So, you taking off tomorrow?

184
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,327
Yeah, early, about 8:00.

185
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,096
All right. You know not
to get in no trouble.

186
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,333
- Yeah, I know.
- Try to drive safely, okay?

187
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,896
I'm a pretty safe driver.

188
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,738
I should charge you extra
for the security work, you know?

189
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,143
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Good night.

190
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,475
Good night.

191
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,459
- Are you Bette Lustig's niece?
- What?

192
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,926
Are you Bette Lustig's niece?

193
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,259
- Oh, my God!
- Are you Bette Lustig's niece?

194
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,663
What's your problem?
Why you bothering the lady?

195
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,826
I'm not bothering anyone...

196
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,495
You opened up her car door.
I would say that was bothering her.

197
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,505
- I want to talk to her.
- Wait a minute.

198
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,835
He was in the bar earlier.

199
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,875
Yeah, he was quiet, no trouble.

200
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,638
So what's the deal then, brother?

201
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,201
Is she Bette Lustig's niece?

202
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,644
Leave him, Mort.

203
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,445
It's okay. My name is Bonhoeffer,
Felix Bonhoeffer.

204
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,679
- Bonhoeffer?
- Yeah, Felix Bonhoeffer.

205
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,120
I saw you on the news
just now with my friend.

206
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,384
- Tracy Abbott.
...and at the racetrack.

207
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,289
- That's right, yes.
- What is all this?

208
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,454
- I know you.
- Okay, look, I gotta go.

209
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,521
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

210
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,191
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

211
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,963
- Easy does it, now, fella.
- I will. Okay.

212
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,638
Hey, Gina,
are you sure you're okay?

213
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,910
I'll be fine.

214
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,726
<i>... crossfire shootout</i>
<i>on the Morning View Freeway.</i>

215
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,127
Gina, you know how to reach me.

216
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,665
I do!

217
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,821
You're a real good citizen,
Mort, the best.

218
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,293
Ray, can we talk?

219
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,260
Nothing to talk about, baby.

220
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,756
I need more time.

221
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,491
Time's up, old pal,
know what I mean?

222
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,593
It's zippo.

223
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,528
So what do I do now?

224
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,868
Just drive.

225
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:02,930
Where?

226
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,669
You know where. Drive.

227
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,048
It's not meant to happen
for me like this, Ray.

228
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,090
I got a wife, two kids.

229
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,250
It was just business.
I can pay you back.

230
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,693
Say bye-bye, little birdies,
fly, fly far away.

231
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,458
Stop! Don't do this!

232
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,021
Bye-bye.

233
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,993
Did you get through to Sandra?

234
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,332
No.

235
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,636
No, I left her a message, told her
we'd be there around 4:00, 4:30,

236
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,108
and that tomorrow
we'd take her to a magic show.

237
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,303
What did she say?

238
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,577
I told you she wasn't there.

239
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,482
- It's so hot.
- You want some water?

240
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,990
Your Uncle Bernie used to say
I was like a cat on a hot tin roof,

241
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,926
like Elizabeth Taylor
in that picture with Richard Burton.

242
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,724
- Paul Newman.
- Who?

243
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,128
Paul Newman.

244
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,167
You know, he had
the most beautiful blue eyes.

245
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,829
- Who?
- Richard Burton.

246
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:20,997
Ready?

247
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:25,874
I'll have a glass of milk,
two poached eggs for my friend,

248
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,139
and is it too late for oatmeal?

249
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,646
No, you could get oatmeal.

250
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,479
Great, I'll have it
with honey and a banana

251
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,485
and a glass of orange juice, please.

252
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,020
Alrighty.

253
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,457
Hey, Joanie,
I'm gonna take five minutes, okay?

254
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,590
All right, Mel, we got two poached,
oatmeal with a side of banana,

255
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,859
and a milk and an OJ.

256
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,891
Okay. Busy out there?

257
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,699
Yeah, packed to the rafters.

258
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,638
My feet are killing me.

259
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,474
Hey, Bonnie, what time is it?

260
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,709
My watch stopped.

261
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,845
Call Joanie when my order's ready.

262
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,787
I'm gonna get some air.

263
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,788
She needs to move her ass, anyway.

264
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,659
Hi, Bonnie.

265
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,063
Hey, Eddie.

266
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,846
How's your daughter doing, Eddie?

267
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,347
She's fine, thank you.

268
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,422
<i>How's your daughter doing, Eddie?</i>

269
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,923
<i>She's fine, thank you.</i>

270
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,361
Good morning.

271
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,106
Take it easy, Bonnie.

272
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,239
- Bonnie.
- Yeah?

273
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,350
You still want Joanie
to take it out?

274
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,908
Forget it. I'll take it.

275
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,489
Hey, are you okay?

276
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,956
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

277
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,823
Hey, thanks a bunch, Joanie.

278
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,624
Sorry, Bonnie, I forgot.

279
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:30,396
All right, ladies, here we are...
poached eggs.

280
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,097
There's your oatmeal
with bananas and honey.

281
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,298
Thank you.

282
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,474
Hello there, gentlemen.

283
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,241
The house is open.
You can sit anywhere.

284
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,385
There you go.
Anything to drink?

285
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,978
Coffee.

286
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,647
Okay, coffee.

287
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,387
Sir, anything for you?

288
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,157
Okay. One coffee coming up.

289
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,256
Would you like some water?

290
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,425
No.

291
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,128
Bonnie.

292
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,231
Yes, sir?

293
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,172
That is your name, is it not?

294
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,300
Excuse me?

295
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,310
- Bonnie.
- Take it easy, Bonnie.

296
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,005
That is your name, is it not?

297
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,878
Oh, yeah, it is.

298
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,611
What do you call the other one?

299
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,679
Sorry, my friend can be
quite rude sometimes.

300
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,690
- Isn't that right, Fat Man?
- Wish you wouldn't call me that.

301
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,782
- Call you what?
- Fat Man.

302
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,690
- But you are fat.
- I'm not fat.

303
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,991
Bonnie, don't you think
my friend here is fat?

304
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,294
Don't you think he's fat, Bonnie?

305
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,758
No, sir.

306
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,928
Thank you, lady, thank you.

307
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,164
So, what'll it be?

308
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,830
I would like...

309
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,340
Let's see here, I would like...

310
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,282
Omelet, Denver style.
Would you recommend Denver style?

311
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,890
...side of bacon, real crisp,
like my mom used to make it.

312
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,793
Oh, I see hash browns
are included.

313
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,560
That's good,
and toast included also.

314
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,262
Ray, toast is included also.

315
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,634
Isn't that something?
So, let's see here.

316
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:20,004
Not your sourdough
but your whole wheat,

317
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,568
and real well-done.

318
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,274
Like his mama used to make it.

319
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,339
Yes, how my mommy
used to make it.

320
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,243
For you, sir?

321
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,653
We're making
little Bonnie nervous, Fat Man.

322
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,156
Are we making you nervous?

323
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,692
We're real sorry, Bonnie.

324
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,228
Look, I don't want any trouble.

325
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,593
Who's causing trouble?

326
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,962
I know what it is.
She thinks you're Dr. Phil.

327
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,330
It's making her all of a dither.

328
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,028
You think I look
like Dr. Phil, Bonnie?

329
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,002
- Probably turning her on.
- I don't know, sir.

330
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,902
I mean,
is my resemblance to Dr. Phil

331
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,773
making you hot, bothered,
bewildered, and juicy?

332
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,808
'Cause if it is, Bonnie,
we can find a cozy little place,

333
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,372
and we can get <i>really</i> acquainted.

334
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,088
Look, please, do you...

335
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,457
Do you want to order?

336
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,093
I think not.

337
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,934
I'm just happy being here,

338
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,702
if that's all hunkety-dunkety-doo
with you, Bonnie.

339
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,505
So...

340
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,278
what <i>do</i> you call the other one?

341
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,584
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

342
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,062
Isn't it just a beautiful day
out there?

343
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,361
<i>Come and get me, copper!</i>

344
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,061
<i>Don't, Johnny! No!</i>

345
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,128
What a beautiful day!

346
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,001
Wouldn't you agree, ladies?

347
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,440
Just drink your milk.

348
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,499
Beautiful day?

349
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,371
You can look at me all you want,
ladies, no problem with that.

350
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,915
You got a problem, Bonnie?

351
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,712
No, sir.

352
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,653
Well, okay. If there are no problems,
then what the fuck are you staring at?

353
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,919
Look, we don't want
any trouble here.

354
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,426
How about rustling up
Boo Boo's breakfast?

355
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,985
I like that, Yogi.

356
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,963
Smarter than
your average bear, eh, Boo Boo?

357
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,966
Boo Boo. So silly.

358
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:28,267
- What's your name, baby doll?
- Joanie.

359
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:34,779
That's what you've been
drooling over so lustfully.

360
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,870
Joanie.

361
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,713
Ain't that cute.

362
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,151
Little sad, too,
now I gotta be honest.

363
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,155
Still wanna be
Mommy's little treasure?

364
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,020
Am I right?

365
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:53,163
Not quite ready to let go
of all your little girly yesterdays?

366
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:57,190
Pretty soon, sweetie pie, you're
gonna have to give up all that shit

367
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,205
when you join the festering parade
of tired old broads...

368
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,311
the Bette Anns, the Mary Lous,
the Patsys, the Cindys...

369
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,371
the Bonnies.

370
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,211
Just talking about you.

371
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,478
Come on, get a move on!

372
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,349
Boo Boo tends to get a little snarly

373
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,388
when he hasn't eaten,
right, Boo Boo?

374
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:23,761
So we got the Joanies,
the Bonnies, and we got the Bettes.

375
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,059
How you doing, old gal?

376
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,723
It is Bette, isn't it?

377
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,959
Not "Bett"?

378
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,661
And her name's Gina, right?

379
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,327
Good morning.

380
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,430
Or should I say, good afternoon.

381
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,367
Hello.

382
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,580
What's your problem, pointy head?

383
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,743
Got no problems.

384
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,378
Then what are you staring at?

385
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,979
Nothing.

386
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,117
Heck of a lot of staring going on
in this place, eh, Boo Boo?

387
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,855
Makes me feel real itchy
and twitchy all over.

388
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,260
You don't have to be sorry.

389
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,199
Be conscientious, be American,
with American values... industry, valor!

390
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,758
That's what I like to see.

391
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,066
That's all I ask
of my fellow Americans.

392
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,469
"I am not a crook!"

393
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,302
Bonnie, where's
my friend's breakfast?

394
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,038
I'm just preparing it now.

395
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,943
Good! Continue the preparation.

396
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,544
- What is your name, pinhead?
- Mel.

397
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,914
That's an all-American name to me, Mel.

398
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,620
Got a ring of authenticity.

399
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,889
Kinda cracker barrel,
know what I mean?

400
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,421
Chill Wills, Slim Pickens,
Andy Devine, and Big Mac Mel.

401
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,428
Nice cozy little setup
you got here.

402
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:44,635
Tell me something, if you're not
too much of a whacked-out old fairy:

403
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:49,009
What exactly is your relationship
to sweet Bonnie Daydream, here?

404
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,208
- Nothing.
- She your little piece of ass?

405
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,309
I'm gonna keep my eye
on you, Mel baby.

406
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,112
Bonnie, come on out.

407
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,024
Mel, this way.

408
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,795
Mel, let me introduce you
to Abe Geekman.

409
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,461
His friends, and in this regard
I would count myself

410
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,471
as one of his closest
and dearest buddies, call him Geek.

411
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,462
Hi, gang.

412
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,372
You okay, Geek,
ol' Snuggly Boo?

413
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:21,640
Let's put up the Closed sign
on the old diner door

414
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,738
and keep out
Mr. Forest Ranger, Boo Boo?

415
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,306
- I sure did, Yogi.
- Smart little bear, Boo Boo.

416
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:27,282
Come on.

417
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,955
Now that we're all snug and cozy,
like... one, two, three, four,

418
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,020
five, six, seven little peas in a pod...

419
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,463
Speaking of pods reminds me:

420
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,001
You guys ever see
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers?</i>

421
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,401
Long time ago? Anyone?

422
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,304
No? Never saw it.

423
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,866
How 'bout that, Geek? They never saw
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</i>

424
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,241
That is so sad.

425
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,145
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers!</i>
<i>For pete's sake, never saw that?</i>

426
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,547
- It's a great movie.
- Kevin McCarthy was the star.

427
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,882
- And Dana Wynter.
- Oh, beautiful Dana...

428
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,477
What's with you people?

429
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,319
It's Geek's favorite movie.
We watch it every Thanksgiving.

430
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,825
And Fourth of July.
See, it stars Kevin McCarthy.

431
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,418
He was a big star
back in the '50s,

432
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,828
and I met him once
in New York a long time ago.

433
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,388
You never told me that, Geek.

434
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,935
Yeah, he gave me his autograph,
gave me a picture.

435
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,096
Lucky son of a gun.

436
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,732
He amazes and astonishes me,
my old pal.

437
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,541
You're a regular old sly boots,
aren't you?

438
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,104
Look at him.

439
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:34,015
He's blushing,
like "Aw, shucks" blushing.

440
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:37,612
My old pal, a real sly boots.

441
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,283
Anyway.

442
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,397
Where was I?

443
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,963
Body snatchers, these people
lived in giant pea pods, you see?

444
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,374
- <i>Dinner's ready.</i>
- The movie is about

445
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,743
these pod people
who invade us from outer space.

446
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,282
Right, these creatures,
these parasites,

447
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,715
'cause that's what they are.

448
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,650
Goddamn parasites.

449
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,121
These parasites take over the bodies
and souls of fellow travelers,

450
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,023
- good, decent people.
- Compassionate, caring, sharing,

451
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,151
like you and me.

452
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,559
Men, women,
piddling old grandpappies,

453
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,622
- decaffeinated pussies.
- You and me.

454
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,224
Decaffeinated pussies.

455
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,929
- Men and women...
- Uncle Ira mowing his lawn.

456
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,768
And all the Aunt Beas
from all the Mayberrys.

457
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,968
- Talk show hosts and anchormen...
- Geek.

458
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,305
Sorry, anchorpersons.

459
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,073
- He is so bad.
- Sorry, folks.

460
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:40,243
People like <i>Larry King Live,</i>
<i>Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer,</i>

461
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,684
Dan Rather, Paula Zahn,

462
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,654
Katie Couric, Martha Stewart.

463
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,658
- Everyone from Oprah to...
- Donald Trump.

464
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,126
Fire!

465
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,165
They take over the bodies
and souls of people,

466
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,464
and you know what?

467
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,705
They become them.

468
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,767
First we had the Trekkies...

469
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,972
...now we have the Poddies...

470
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,310
and they run
the whole goddamn show.

471
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,248
- You want to know why?
- Why?

472
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,288
'Cause they are mainstream.

473
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,883
Mainstream.

474
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,721
That's not the real deal, right?

475
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,420
Better believe it, old son.

476
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,056
Mainstream. Gee whiz.

477
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,530
But Kevin is on to them.

478
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,726
Let us make no mistake.
Let it be understood.

479
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,063
Our Kevin is on to them.

480
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,330
Science, science...

481
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,893
Have no fear about Kevin.

482
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,803
Kevin is one smart cookie.

483
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,569
No flies on our Kevin.

484
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,234
Reporting for duty.

485
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,073
Yes...

486
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,809
What?

487
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,152
Don't forget about
the problem, Ray.

488
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,415
Problem?

489
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,824
He has to stay awake.

490
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,522
Right.

491
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,132
He has to stay awake.

492
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,258
That's his problem.

493
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,530
- <i>Felix!</i>
<i>- Dinner's ready.</i>

494
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,199
Once you fall asleep,
they get you!

495
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,005
- Parasites.
- Run, critters!

496
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,568
That's it, shazam,
pop goes the weasel.

497
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,239
- What?
- Pop goes the weasel.

498
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,078
It almost happens
to our Kevin.

499
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,549
Yeah, he's gotta stay awake.

500
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:24,019
You wanna know why?
Because they are mainstream, baby!

501
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,815
You've already done that bit.

502
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,622
- What?
- You've already done that bit.

503
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,856
Well, I'm doing it again, okay?

504
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,024
- Okay.
- Okay?!

505
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,203
If you're so smart, Boo Boo,
why don't you tell them?

506
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,297
Well, no, you tell them.
You tell it much better than I do.

507
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,399
It's so hot in here.
It's like a goddamn furnace.

508
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,569
The air conditioning
is broken, baby.

509
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,273
- What!
- She said the air conditioner is broken.

510
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,111
Why don't you go in there?
It's cooler.

511
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,743
Give us a break,
for pete's sake.

512
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:58,411
You were telling us
why Kevin has to stay awake.

513
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,050
Ever since he was an itsy-bitsy
little snot-nosed kid,

514
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,617
our Kevin had bought
the whole stupid fairy tale,

515
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,756
hook, line, sinker, and the grand piano,
you know what I mean?

516
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:08,821
Hello?

517
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,425
Suddenly he became
a grassroots goody two-shoes,

518
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:16,030
a noble champion of non-profit
advocacy organizations, etc., etc.

519
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,233
And why?

520
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,971
Because it made him feel
kind of cozy and mushy inside.

521
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,206
You know the feeling.

522
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:29,516
But sadly, Kevin, our hero,
had these core issues to deal with.

523
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,647
You've all heard about core issues?
Sure you have.

524
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,091
Kevin had tons of these things
all buzzing around inside him,

525
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,323
because secretly
he knew the truth.

526
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,356
He'd sort of cottoned on
to the big, fat Huckleberry Finn lie

527
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,561
that runs our world
and as a result,

528
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,935
he became bipolar,

529
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,703
had problems with rage
and so on and so forth.

530
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,936
Poor schmuck couldn't relate.

531
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,672
And that's awful.

532
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,948
Poor schmuck probably
should've married Dana Wynter.

533
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,613
- Yeah, right.
- Know what I mean?

534
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,820
Dana could've got him
through his stuff, you know,

535
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,657
got him to clean up
his side of the street, you know?

536
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:13,853
<i>Hello?</i>

537
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,230
She also had her own stuff
that kept coming up.

538
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,327
What time is it?

539
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,168
Let's make no mistake about that.

540
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,038
Let it be understood!

541
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,672
- Hey... that's my line.
- So?

542
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,909
You stomped all over
my train of thought,

543
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,508
you stupid son of a bitch.

544
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,610
You stomped all over
my keynote speech.

545
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,680
This is supposed to be
my stupid keynote speech!

546
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,224
- I'll kill you!
- I'm sorry.

547
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,351
- Jesus Christ!
- What does he want from us?

548
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,986
- It's Bette?
- What do I want from you?

549
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,928
- Her name's Gina.
- How does he know our names?

550
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,727
- You write this shit, dude?
- I'm bipolar.

551
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,358
Oh, I'm bipolar. Are you bipolar?

552
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,732
I'm bipolar. I'm a schmuck.

553
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,668
I'm a schmuck,
and I'm bipolar.

554
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,467
- He was a...
- I'm Boo Boo. I'm bipolar.

555
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,768
He's also co-dependent.

556
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,775
I'm Boo Boo.
I'm the bipolar bear.

557
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,902
- Very funny.
- I'm the bipolar bear!

558
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,607
- Adult child of alcoholics.
- Stop this!

559
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,945
- Stop doing this!
- Would you shut the fuck up!

560
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,041
Cool it!

561
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,199
- This is boring.
- I'm hungry.

562
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,737
Hey, Matt, Matt, are you okay?

563
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,075
What do I say next?

564
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,775
"It's quite simple, really."

565
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,477
I know that. What comes next?

566
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,314
- Cut, cut.
- Cut. Let's cut.

567
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,147
Burt, come on, wake up!

568
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,985
Matt, you're killing us.

569
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,855
Okay, back to first positions,
everyone. Burt!

570
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:53,160
- Put on the air conditioning!
- What do I say next?

571
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,823
Boo Boo! I'm Boo Boo.

572
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,833
- Going down.
- Wait for the camera, folks.

573
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,731
- Matt. Matt just went down.
- What's going on?

574
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,943
- Shouldn't you get the...
- I have no idea...

575
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,773
He went down, huh?
I'm hungry.

576
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,403
Jesus, now what?

577
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,639
He's nuts.

578
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,705
Matt?

579
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,576
Grab his arms.

580
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,586
Actors.

581
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,319
Real nice!

582
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,022
Watch his head!

583
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,997
Oh, I can't feel my face!

584
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,466
Let's loosen his shirt. Breathe!

585
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,127
- Let's break for lunch.
- Give him air.

586
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,932
Break for lunch, everyone!

587
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,768
One hour, everyone.

588
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,105
You! You want my part.

589
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,008
I don't want your part.
Want some water?

590
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,512
I don't want any water!

591
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,605
- Let him breathe.
- You don't have to have water.

592
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,348
- Can we get Monica in here, please?
- Who's Monica?

593
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,979
- The production nurse.
- She's never here when you need her.

594
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,956
- I'll get her.
- Try craft service. She's usually there.

595
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,652
- All right.
- Thanks, Bonnie.

596
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,853
- I need an ice pack.
- Come on.

597
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,489
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah. Shit, it still hurts.

598
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,931
Abby, I need you to get me
an ice pack for Gavin.

599
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,400
- I just gotta figure out where...
- Give him to me.

600
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,837
You can't work like this anymore.
You're driving everybody crazy.

601
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,373
- I know that.
- Come here.

602
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,669
Come here, Michael.

603
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:12,834
My good little...

604
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,502
How are you, sweetie?

605
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,241
Jennifer, can you call Marcia,
the baby's mom,

606
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,079
and tell her that she needs
to come down here ASAP?

607
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,085
- Right this second.
- Well, where is she?

608
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,053
Probably at the motel
sunning her ass. Go!

609
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,180
Okay, calm down.

610
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,655
I am calm!

611
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,385
You're pulling my chest hairs!

612
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,448
Listen to me!

613
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,654
You are the leader.
I need you to act like one.

614
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:32,821
You're hurting my nipp...

615
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,559
From now on, you are gonna do
what I say, you understand?

616
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,622
Yes.

617
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,761
We are printing the second take.
We are printing the two last takes.

618
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,828
We need to match that last take

619
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,897
with the milk spilled
and the oatmeal,

620
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,604
and then when we come back from
lunch, we're gonna do a pick-up shot.

621
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,703
Yes, I get it, I get it.
I get it!

622
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,273
You are such an infant.

623
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,250
You're a baby!

624
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,910
Very touchy, isn't he?

625
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,852
<i>Gavin, go down</i>
<i>to the production trailer.</i>

626
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:58,946
Whoopsy daisy.

627
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,456
Drop dead, Lars.

628
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,924
I love you too!

629
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,618
Evan. Evan, darling...

630
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,027
- It's Gavin!
- Sorry, sweetie.

631
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,760
Listen, Evan, what are we
going to do about this wig?

632
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,200
- I mean, it doesn't even match...
- I don't care!

633
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,670
- What!
- Please excuse me for breathing!

634
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,866
Gavin, I'm really sorry
that I came in on that line,

635
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,806
but I don't know
what's going on around here.

636
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,537
- Who does?
- What line?

637
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,976
"Stop it! Stop doing this!"

638
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,877
I thought Mort
was gonna do that line.

639
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,506
No, that changed last night.

640
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,881
- Well, I didn't know!
- Well, you should've!

641
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,544
You should've said something!

642
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,646
- Come on, Florence Nightingale.
- Stop calling me that!

643
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,226
The nurse is coming over now,
and you were right, Barbara,

644
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,094
she was over there at craft service
just stuffing her face.

645
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,189
Unbelievable.

646
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,359
Hey, what are you doing?

647
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,266
Looking at your continuity sheets,

648
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,464
if that's what these
are supposed to be.

649
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,938
You're such an asshole, Lars!

650
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,668
I don't look through your shit.

651
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,437
How's Marlon doing
out there, anyway?

652
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,105
- Should we get a doctor, too?
- I'm gonna talk to Burt about it.

653
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,910
Honey, oh! Honey, come here.

654
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,712
- How do you feel?
- Get him a chair.

655
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,015
Get him in the chair.
There we go.

656
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,349
Back it in, back it in.

657
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,117
I've done this before like this.

658
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,179
Déja vu.

659
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,154
Should we start the scene
in the kitchen?

660
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,425
We finished it, man.
We just have a pick-up shot.

661
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,021
- We started the scene?
- Yeah.

662
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,088
You were terrific.

663
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,829
No, no, I didn't think
you'd started the scene yet.

664
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,928
You scared the shit out of me.

665
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,031
Hey, hey! If you ever touch me
that way again,

666
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,507
I will eat your heart for lunch!

667
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,711
What are you talking about?!

668
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,271
Don't you touch me!
Don't anyone touch me!

669
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,648
That's lunch, everyone!
One hour.

670
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,708
One hour!

671
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,219
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick, everyone!

672
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,519
You need to lie down.

673
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,254
- You want my part?
- Maybe we should all lie down.

674
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,454
What happened, honey?

675
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:46,791
He was overacting.

676
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,560
Leave me alone!
Don't you understand?

677
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,398
- Time's gone all weird...
- That's it. I'm outta here.

678
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,199
Gotta get outta here!

679
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,739
Oh, Jesus Christ!

680
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,330
Anybody know what's for lunch?

681
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,103
Get him to his trailer.
Come on.

682
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,981
Buddy, I need to call a doctor.

683
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,538
I need a cell phone, someone!

684
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,252
You should have a fucking phone!

685
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,651
That motherfucker!

686
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,487
Did you see that?
He just grabbed my titties!

687
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,156
This whole thing is going
to hell in a hand basket.

688
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,232
Okay, so we're clear?
Pick-up shot after lunch?

689
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,295
Yes, and we're gonna print
the last two takes.

690
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,738
If it were up to me,
we'd do a safety of the whole scene.

691
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,709
Anything for safety,
please, anything.

692
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,576
Come on, Lars, please,
give me a break.

693
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,945
I'm just kidding, old chum.
I'm just kidding.

694
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,142
Are you?

695
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,582
No.

696
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,554
- Who loves you, baby?
- Stop it!

697
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,717
Come on, sexy.

698
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,419
Who's that woman?

699
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,984
That's Lily. She's Russian.

700
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,792
What's she doing on my set?

701
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,798
Gavin, she financed half your film.

702
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,300
- That's why she wants a bigger part?
- Yeah.

703
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,563
What's she doing with Lars?

704
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,231
Giving him aid and sustenance
whenever he wants it.

705
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,871
Shit, directing sucks!
Where's my wife?

706
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,434
I'm here. Where's the baby?

707
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,605
- Jennifer has him.
- Where were you?

708
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,980
I was out buying diapers for him
and baby wipes for you, bonehead.

709
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,212
Oh, that's funny.
That's really funny!

710
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,982
Gavin.

711
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,956
I'm sor... I'm sorry. Sorry.

712
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,593
That's 45 minutes, people.

713
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,527
Back at 4:00. Back at 4:00!

714
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,226
Back at 4:00, copy that!

715
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,233
Gavin, this is Dr. Cohen.

716
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,670
Hi, Dr. Stuart Cohen.
Can we talk a moment, please?

717
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,264
- What's up?
- Privately.

718
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,473
- What's going on?
- What's the problem?

719
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,445
- Dead?
- Yeah.

720
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,508
I don't believe it.

721
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,521
Yeah, I don't know what to say. It was...

722
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,578
What happened?

723
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,853
It could have been
severe heat stroke, heart, anything.

724
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,894
I took Dr. Cohen to Ray's trailer...

725
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,486
Yeah, he was lying down there...

726
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,155
- Who was laying down?
- What?

727
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,257
- Who was laying down?
- Matt, Matt Dobbs.

728
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,858
Right, and he didn't look good.

729
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,597
I asked him to sit up.
I needed to get his blood pressure.

730
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,660
I gave him some water.

731
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,833
I turned around to get my stuff,
and he had collapsed onto the floor.

732
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,309
It was awful.
I called an ambulance.

733
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,675
Are you sure he's dead?

734
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,476
What do you mean?
Of course I'm sure. I'm a doctor.

735
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,779
He's dead, extremely dead.

736
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,944
Okay, so what do we do now?

737
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,251
There's gonna have to be an autopsy,
coroner's report, all the procedures.

738
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:29,383
Did he have an insurance medical
before you started filming?

739
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,552
I guess so.

740
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,119
Did he or didn't he?
Don't you people check this out?

741
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,028
I don't know.
Don't get in my face!

742
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,464
Gavin, calm down!

743
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,662
All I'm saying is they have
strict laws up here in Nevada.

744
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:43,366
I'm sure they do.
Dr. Cohen, I'm Jeffrey, by the way.

745
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,306
I'm an actor in the film,
and this is...

746
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,843
Bonnie.

747
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,936
...Gavin, but he's a little stressed.

748
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,709
Okay, but hell, he doesn't
have to jump down my throat.

749
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,773
Does he have a family
or relatives?

750
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,842
Yeah, I have a wife and a child.

751
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,147
- He means Matt.
- Matt?

752
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,624
You know, the deceased?
What's his name, Dobbs?

753
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,887
Does he have a family?

754
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,589
Yes, he does. He has a wife
and two young kids.

755
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,926
I think they're divorced.

756
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,660
- His kids are divorced?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

757
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,765
Do you laugh at everything?
I mean, a man has died.

758
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,831
She thinks this is funny.

759
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,435
- Are all you movie people like this?
- Go, go!

760
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,912
Who's in charge of things?

761
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,175
I'm the director.

762
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,717
- You've gotta be kidding.
- He is, doc.

763
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,845
He's in charge.
We can all vouch for that.

764
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,583
- Who the hell was that?
- That was the production asshole.

765
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,023
I thought as much.
Is there a producer around here?

766
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,085
Well, no. He's in LA.
His name is Harvey Brickman.

767
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,597
I'm gonna have to talk to him.

768
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,657
You know what, I'm gonna call
Harvey and break the news.

769
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,203
- I'll wait for the ambulance.
- I'll go with you.

770
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,898
No, it's okay. Go to lunch.

771
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,372
Copy that.

772
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,466
Gavin!

773
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,605
Your ice pack.

774
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,624
Why has he got
that ice pack on his knee?

775
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,092
He had an accident
surfing over in Malibu.

776
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,150
He surfs?

777
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,253
Oh, yeah.

778
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,093
<i>- Harvey Brickman's office.</i>
- Harvey.

779
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,393
<i>- He's not here.</i>
- Where is he?

780
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,662
- <i>Would you like me to try his cell?</i>
- Put me through!

781
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,260
God!

782
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,805
He's on medication, isn't he?

783
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,272
He's on everything.

784
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,071
Thought as much.

785
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,634
Vicodin?

786
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,304
Yeah.

787
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,905
Yeah, you got it.

788
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,112
That's why he's wacko.

789
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,777
He's wacko?

790
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,685
Hello.

791
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,223
Hey, Harvey, it's Gavin.

792
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,724
- <i>Marvin?</i>
- Gavin.

793
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,453
- <i>Gavin?</i>
- That's right.

794
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,290
I'm directing one of your films.

795
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,387
- <i>Which one?</i>
- <i>Slipstream.</i>

796
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,091
Yeah, out here in the desert.

797
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,329
- <i>Garvin?</i>
- Gavin, not Garvin.

798
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,166
- Right, no, I'm directing...
- <i>Hot?</i>

799
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,001
- It's very hot out here.
- <i>Where?</i>

800
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,233
- Near Vegas.
- <i>Vegas?</i>

801
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,435
Listen, Harvey,
we have a problem.

802
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,535
Actually, we have
a very big problem.

803
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,443
One of your actors, Matt Dobbs,

804
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,914
well, he collapsed
about an hour ago...

805
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:06,972
<i>Who's he?</i>

806
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:10,375
Playing...

807
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,285
Well, he's dead.

808
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,382
What do you mean? He can't die.
We're in the middle of a movie.

809
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,222
Nobody dies until I tell 'em to die.

810
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,455
- <i>It could've been a heart...</i>
- Heart attack!

811
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,590
Hiya, Francis!
How you doing?

812
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,794
You. Call me.
We'll have dinner.

813
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,028
<i>Or heat exhaustion.</i>

814
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,507
What do you mean,
heat exhaustion?!

815
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,043
<i>We're already three weeks in.</i>

816
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,512
What do you want me to do, recast?
You're breaking up, Harvey.

817
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,481
You'd break up
if you had my problems.

818
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,110
We can't recast.
Jeez, what's the matter with you?

819
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,654
John! John, take this away.
It's rubbish!

820
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,986
- <i>What should I do?</i>
- How the hell should I know?

821
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,423
You're the director!
Do a rewrite!

822
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,393
Everybody wants to be
a writer these days.

823
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,827
- <i>What should I do!</i>
- I don't know.

824
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,887
Get somebody
from catering to do it,

825
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,990
maybe transpo,
just get on with it.

826
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,898
- Get on with what?
- What?

827
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,630
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

828
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,434
Could you come up here?
We've got no line producer or anything.

829
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:04,667
Shut it down.

830
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,836
Okay, I'll shut down production
this afternoon. Great.

831
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,378
You have my cell phone number.

832
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,539
Actually, production
has my cell phone.

833
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,708
Or you could call
my hotel in Vegas.

834
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:17,220
<i>Well, it's not really in Vegas.</i>
<i>It's actually a motel... hello?</i>

835
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,720
Hello, Harvey?

836
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,574
Hey, Gav, catch!

837
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,542
Where the hell am I?

838
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:43,079
- Matt Dobbs just died.
- Who's he?

839
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,205
He's an actor.

840
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,805
He was your bright idea,
wasn't he?

841
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,373
What do I know?
I'm just the writer.

842
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,079
You'd better get up there
to the desert and do a rewrite

843
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,951
before some other idiot
gets hold of it.

844
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,617
Very nice to meet you.

845
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,191
So unprofessional.

846
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,327
Hey, Gav!

847
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,769
- Okay, this is the situation.
- Evan, darling.

848
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,603
This is what the deal is.
We're shutting down production.

849
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,075
- Harvey is coming up on Monday.
- That should be lots of fun.

850
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:17,307
And what are we supposed to do,
Superman, sit around and wait?

851
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,406
I'm not sure
what the legal deal is in this case.

852
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,815
- Will you recast?
- Don't even say that word.

853
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,513
- Harvey wants to do a rewrite.
- You're bringing the writer up here?

854
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:27,216
- Yes, we're gonna do a rewrite.
- I'm down with that.

855
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,851
Oh, you would say that, Jeffrey.
You're so nice.

856
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,758
- So nice!
- We need a rewrite.

857
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,888
I have no idea what
I'm doing in this thing.

858
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,932
You need to bring
the real writer up here.

859
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,365
- Yes, the real writer.
- Do we get paid?

860
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,995
Yeah, well, speak to your agent.
Call your agent.

861
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,973
You don't understand, man.
I have to be paid. I need the money.

862
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,374
Well, what's that thing called, force...

863
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,877
<i>Force major.</i>

864
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,141
He knows that.
He knows everything.

865
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,706
Bette, here's an idea.
Why don't you have a drink?

866
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:56,685
I gotta be paid. I'm gonna get
a deputy on the set!

867
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,814
Oh, babycakes, you're gonna get paid.
Don't worry your little head.

868
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,519
Mommy'll look after that.
Mommy'll look after that.

869
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,721
Bette, will you go fuck yourself?

870
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,030
You too, darling.

871
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,125
And that girly horse
you rode into town on...

872
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,467
Why don't you just drop dead?

873
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,905
I've enough of this shit!
I'm gonna get a lawyer.

874
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,502
I think it's a pretty healthy group.
What about you?

875
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,807
I'll sue their ass.

876
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,183
Burt, can we see dailies tonight?

877
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,549
I don't know, Gav.
The projector's broken.

878
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,088
- Like everything else on this movie.
- Any other questions?

879
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,818
- Yeah, I got a question.
- Yeah, Lars?

880
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,723
Who wrote this piece of crap?

881
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,690
You guys figure it out.

882
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:44,228
Yeah, baby!

883
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,558
My God, this place
must be a million years old.

884
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,173
Will that be it, sweetie?

885
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,304
I think this gentleman's next.

886
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,179
No, sir. You're next.

887
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,342
Thank you.

888
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,552
That'll be $1.35.

889
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:46,646
What?

890
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:47,985
$1.35.

891
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,060
- That's all?
- Did you want to pay more?

892
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,289
No, it's just so cheap.

893
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,958
That's the way it is out here,
sweetie, free and easy.

894
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:01,664
Yes, sirree, home on the range
where the buffalo roam.

895
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,501
The deer and the antelope play.

896
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,543
Dolly's Little Diner.
Home from home.

897
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,306
Home from home.

898
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,806
What's your name?

899
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,248
Dolly Parton Lookalike.

900
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,851
Dolly Parton Lookalike.

901
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,788
Dolly Parton Lookalike...

902
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,586
My, my...

903
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,023
Thank you very much.

904
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:31,333
Have a good day,
and enjoy it.

905
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,935
Catchy little tune, isn't it?

906
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,031
Yeah.

907
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:39,835
Thanks.

908
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,313
Beautiful day.

909
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,247
Yeah, you could say that again.

910
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,307
<i>Beautiful day.</i>

911
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,115
Waiting for your lady friend?

912
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,419
Yes, I am.

913
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,052
She'll be out soon.

914
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,198
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

915
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,309
<i>Mommy?</i>

916
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,171
Felix?

917
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,212
That bathroom was so gross
I couldn't use it.

918
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,380
The place had flooded.
The john overflowed.

919
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,617
There was stuff everywhere.
Are you okay?

920
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,320
God, you look like
you saw a ghost.

921
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,624
It's just the heat. I'm okay.
You all right?

922
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,822
Yeah.

923
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,524
Can I go behind the car?

924
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,260
Yeah, why not?

925
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,562
Okay, you stand guard.

926
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:46,966
Yeah. What?

927
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,504
Stand guard.

928
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,972
- No peeking!
- Okay.

929
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,167
<i>Hello.</i>

930
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,642
Who's that man
you were talking to back there?

931
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:55,700
I don't know.

932
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,145
He said he thought
he knew me from someplace.

933
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,876
He was kind of cute.

934
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,713
That's better.

935
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,218
Whose car is this?

936
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,049
I don't know.

937
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,752
Does it smell kind of funny?

938
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:09,814
Yeah.

939
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:13,887
Ready?

940
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,090
- Yeah.
- Good.

941
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,154
Let's go.

942
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,536
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

943
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,897
Hello, my friend.
We meet again.

944
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,399
Could you possibly give me
a ride to Las Vegas?

945
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,301
I fear that my car
is about to expire.

946
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:57,636
I seem to be lost. I don't know
if this goes to Las Vegas.

947
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:01,143
Oh, it does.
Take my word for it, yes sir.

948
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,873
You're doing the right thing,
just a little off-track,

949
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,312
but I can get us there.

950
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:06,849
Good, then get in.

951
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,820
To the land of Babylon
and fair fortune.

952
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,789
I love the desert.

953
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,159
You came into that diner
this afternoon, right?

954
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,925
Way down there on the highway.

955
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,295
We spoke briefly.

956
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,061
Where's your girlfriend?

957
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,727
She's in the back.
She's sleeping.

958
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:32,173
Does she always sleep
with her eyes open?

959
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,504
I never noticed.

960
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,272
She's not my girlfriend.

961
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,812
Oh, I apologize.

962
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,611
"Not having seen the dawn,
I open every door."

963
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:43,847
- You're Kevin McCarthy, aren't you?
- That's what they tell me.

964
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,387
I saw you in a great movie once.

965
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,787
It was called <i>The Invasion</i>
<i>of the Body Snatchers.</i>

966
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,222
Was I in that?

967
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,089
Yeah, and Dana Wynter.

968
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,629
She was your girlfriend,
and she was so beautiful.

969
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:54,925
Indeed she was.

970
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,193
- You were the hero.
- I was?

971
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,996
Yeah.

972
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,661
How do you like that!

973
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,952
Why doesn't he listen to you...
what's his name?

974
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,256
- Gavin.
- Right, Garvin.

975
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,024
I can never remember his name.

976
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,693
Morty! Morty!

977
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,761
Yeah, where you been,
Morty baby, yeah?

978
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,500
Yeah, I saw Francis yesterday.

979
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,337
He looks terrific.

980
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,274
You can't talk?
You with Bobby?

981
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,335
And Leo! What, you having an orgy?

982
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:48,483
I got you! I got you, you bastard!

983
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,677
You call me, now!

984
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,687
Call me! All right, don't forget.

985
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,086
I love you more.

986
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,158
So why doesn't he
listen to you?

987
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,660
I tend to rattle his cage.
He doesn't like it.

988
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,788
So was it like this before the actor...
what was his name... died?

989
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,493
- Matt Dobbs.
- What was going on then?

990
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,400
Anarchy.
Dobbs was rewriting the script.

991
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,530
He'd call script conferences
every morning before shooting.

992
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:11,733
It made everyone crazy.

993
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,106
I thought we had a script!
What was the problem?

994
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,941
He's an actor, what can I tell you.
He wasn't even good at it.

995
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:20,005
He was the "look at me
scratch my balls" school of acting.

996
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,448
They're all such assholes.

997
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,043
I asked this guy, Matt Dobbs,
I asked him last week,

998
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,384
- I said, "Why are you doing this?"
- What'd he say?

999
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,287
He said it was a generational thing.

1000
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,259
- What's that mean?
- Beats the hell outta me.

1001
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,627
Little puke. Come on!

1002
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,666
You couldn't do anything to stop it?

1003
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,463
What could I do?
Gavin had no control.

1004
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:41,764
He was terrified.

1005
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,137
Couldn't make decisions about
anything, even about breakfast.

1006
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,869
I could've helped him,
you know?

1007
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:51,312
Camera set-ups, lots of...
but he wouldn't listen.

1008
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,814
That's too bad.

1009
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:54,741
Dino!

1010
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,012
Dino, is that you, Dino?

1011
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,951
Dino! How you doing?

1012
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,218
You doing <i>Hannibal 4: Blue Dragon</i>
<i>with Hopkins? He's in or out?</i>

1013
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,758
He wants more money?
Fuck him.

1014
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,384
It's sad.

1015
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,520
He's a nice little guy
with a big heart.

1016
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,587
- What's his name?
- Gavin.

1017
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,133
I think he's trying
to prove himself somehow.

1018
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,102
Yeah, with big brother Mikey.

1019
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,536
Some hot shit producer,
richer than God,

1020
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,904
with three big awards
stuck up his ass.

1021
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,603
This poor schmuck's been trying
to get even all his life.

1022
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,669
Let's have lunch.
Enough with this garbage.

1023
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,978
Why do people play this game?
It is so boring!

1024
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,142
It eases tension.

1025
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,413
Well, I'd rather enjoy my tension.

1026
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,250
It gets things done!

1027
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:33,914
When does Bonhoeffer get here?

1028
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,958
- I thought he was here!
- Maybe he is.

1029
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,186
I never know what the hell
that guy's talking about

1030
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,592
with his stupid accent.

1031
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,095
What is he, Icelandic?

1032
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,188
No, he's Welsh.

1033
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,233
Why do I always end up
with the space cadets?

1034
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,564
- Where you shooting tomorrow?
- Lucky Dice Motel.

1035
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,127
Let's start kicking some ass, man!

1036
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,007
Where's the director?!

1037
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,512
Let's get on with it!

1038
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:00,640
Cut, cut, cut!

1039
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,517
- Cut!
- That was cut.

1040
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:08,546
Hey, Harvey!
It's... well... I didn't know you were...

1041
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,150
Today's Monday, isn't it?
I'm sorry, but you got in the shot.

1042
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,127
What shot?
What are you talking about!

1043
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,994
The shot where Bette and Gina
leave the motel and go back to LA.

1044
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,295
Script check. Script check!

1045
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,796
There's no such scene!

1046
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,066
I'm in Room 419.

1047
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,608
You think that I was
born yesterday?

1048
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:29,708
Shut up!

1049
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,145
- Harvey...
- It's Mr. Brickman to you,

1050
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,207
you little putz!
What's that thing around your neck?

1051
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,312
It's my baby boy, actually,
Mr. Brickman.

1052
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:39,548
His name is Michael Joshua...

1053
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:44,252
I don't wanna know his name!
What's he doing around your neck?

1054
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:47,160
You try to direct my movie
with a baby around your neck?

1055
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,323
But my wife is suffering
from post-partum...

1056
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,526
- Post-what?!
- She can't cope.

1057
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,728
It's post-partum depression,
Mr. Brickman.

1058
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,065
It's like Brooke Shields.

1059
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,730
- Your brother was right!
- Brother?

1060
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,671
Yes, your big brother,
the producer.

1061
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,005
He said you're a loser, an idiot.
He's right!

1062
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:04,103
You bet your sweet ass
I'm right, Harvey!

1063
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,579
Mikey!

1064
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,717
Stop the car! Stop the car!

1065
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,515
I mean, you asked me
to do a rewrite...

1066
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,021
Harvey! Harvey!

1067
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,216
Ask the schmuck
about his knee surgery!

1068
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,815
- What?
- I had this knee surgery

1069
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,622
and that why I have
this titanium plate...

1070
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:22,028
Well, here's the darn card
that has the x-ray photo of it.

1071
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,396
It has my little...
this one gets me through

1072
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,731
clearances and concerts
of course, and...

1073
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,810
Why are you doing this to me?

1074
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,175
- I lost my way.
- Wake up.

1075
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,744
<i>Hello, Felix.</i>

1076
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,060
Are you ready, love?

1077
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,723
Let's go have some breakfast.

1078
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,734
- Hi.
- <i>Bonhoeffer, is that your name?</i>

1079
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:02,032
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

1080
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,333
Yeah.

1081
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,332
What are you looking at?

1082
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,639
Nothing.
Where'd you get that hat?

1083
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,942
You got this for me
last year in Texas.

1084
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,607
Don't you remember?

1085
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:14,945
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,816
Are you all right, love?

1087
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,651
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just a little tired, that's all.

1088
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,714
Aren't you gonna be hot
in this jacket?

1089
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,521
No, I'm all right.
I like being hot.

1090
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,093
Can we sit anywhere?

1091
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,758
- Anywhere you please, honey child.
- Thank you.

1092
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,198
<i>There he goes again.</i>

1093
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,735
Can we sit anywhere?

1094
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,294
- Anywhere you please, honey child.
- Thank you.

1095
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,465
Be with you in a moment.
Would you both like coffee?

1096
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,601
Latte, extra hot, no foam, please.

1097
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,111
Mr. Bonhoeffer?

1098
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,510
I'd like an orange juice.

1099
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,310
- Mr. Bonhoeffer?
- Yeah.

1100
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:49,010
Lars Munsen.
Cinematographer extraordinaire.

1101
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,053
Oh, hi.
You know my wife, Gina.

1102
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,918
Gina's been our moral support
in these troubled times.

1103
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,048
Oh, Lars.

1104
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:58,355
She's our lucky mascot.
Isn't that right, little one?

1105
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,452
Totally amazing.

1106
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:03,329
There you have it.
Totally phantasmagorically amazing.

1107
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:04,593
Thank you, Lars.

1108
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:05,964
I should have introduced you.

1109
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,832
This young beauty's
gonna be a movie star.

1110
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:11,340
She's my protégé. Her name's Lily.
She's from Russia.

1111
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,897
- Hi, Lily.
- Hi-Io.

1112
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,048
So, how is everything?

1113
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,949
Fantasia, old man.

1114
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,988
- Lunacy.
- That bad, huh?

1115
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:27,579
A looking glass world.

1116
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,249
Mad Hatter's tea party.

1117
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:30,553
Yeah?

1118
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,219
One orange juice.

1119
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,729
- Latte, no foam, sweetie pie.
- Thank you.

1120
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,859
It's my pleasure.

1121
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,737
- Who the hell was that?
- The waiter?

1122
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,070
That's Aaron.

1123
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,738
So, what's the latest development?

1124
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,302
You are, Mr. Bonhoeffer.

1125
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,871
- I am?
- Of course.

1126
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:56,578
Hurtling up here from tired old
Tinseltown to rewrite our little saga.

1127
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,247
Maybe you can write me
a part, Mr. Bonhoeffer.

1128
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,780
- Me too.
- Well, I'll give it a go.

1129
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:03,985
Oh, yes, please.

1130
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,090
Harvey's coming up
this afternoon, I believe.

1131
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,427
He's here.

1132
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,762
Flew in this morning.

1133
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,064
I doubt he'll help matters much.

1134
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:17,106
Harvey experiences road rage
even in the bathroom.

1135
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,801
Heads will tumble,
limbs will snap asunder,

1136
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,936
and many a tear will fall,
I have no doubt.

1137
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,446
Hi-ho, and merrily we go.

1138
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,278
Godspeed.

1139
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,215
Don't forget, now.

1140
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:30,850
See you guys later.

1141
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,113
Done with the paper?

1142
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,453
It's yours, old chum, all yours.

1143
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,617
Thanks.

1144
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,751
Bye.

1145
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,625
So that's Lars Munsen, huh?

1146
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,599
Lars and Lily.

1147
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,225
What do you know.

1148
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:51,903
God, it's hot.

1149
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,359
This is where it all started.

1150
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,465
It's Bette, honey,

1151
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,968
your old friend, Bette Lustig.

1152
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,597
Bette, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1153
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,038
I had something to tell you.

1154
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:28,600
I know, honey. Gina told me
you were looking for me.

1155
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:29,975
Gina?

1156
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:35,116
I can't remember
what it was I had to tell you.

1157
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:36,173
Look!

1158
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,914
Gina said you had
a spot of trouble, too.

1159
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,183
Remember?

1160
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,555
We drove up here three days ago.

1161
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,526
We're heading back
to LA tomorrow.

1162
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,926
You wanna come with us?

1163
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,226
<i>That's 45 minutes!</i>

1164
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,594
<i>Felix...</i>

1165
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,602
Are you okay, honey?

1166
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,765
<i>Don't think so.</i>

1167
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,535
Let's go and say hello to Gina.

1168
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,578
- Gina, yeah.
- You remember Gina, my niece.

1169
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,840
I think so.

1170
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,211
Of course you do.

1171
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,681
Are you in pain, honey?

1172
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,978
No, not anymore.

1173
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,746
- Gina.
- Hello.

1174
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,980
You remember Felix.

1175
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,248
Of course I do.

1176
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,584
- Hello.
- Hello, Gina.

1177
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,852
Would you like to join us
for tea or coffee?

1178
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,393
- No, I can't.
- No?

1179
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,326
Why not, honey?

1180
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,455
You look pale.
You have breakfast?

1181
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,194
I can't remember.

1182
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,564
Can't remember.

1183
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,534
- What's going on around here?
- What do you mean?

1184
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,840
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1185
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,969
Don't do that, please.

1186
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:37,603
- Why not?
- 'Cause it hurts me.

1187
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,580
You shouldn't play
with the big boys.

1188
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,446
- Right, Gina?
- Word from the wise.

1189
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:44,042
- You're next.
- You should get a little rest.

1190
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,553
Yes, try to rest.

1191
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,958
- <i>Remember?</i>
- I just feel so cold.

1192
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:52,416
I feel so cold.

1193
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,963
Godspeed.

1194
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:02,504
They're making a movie
around here somewhere.

1195
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:03,664
So I've heard.

1196
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:07,231
I tried to get a part in it,
but with my reputation...

1197
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,609
I hear my friend Tracy
plays a very important part in it.

1198
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,147
Isn't that right, Felix?

1199
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,842
A very important part.

1200
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,349
Isn't that right, Felix?

1201
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,444
- Hello, Felix.
- Very important.

1202
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,749
Will you have tea with us?

1203
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,465
<i>I love the desert.</i>

1204
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,995
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

1205
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,734
<i>I love the desert.</i>

1206
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,571
Don't look at the camera, Felix.

1207
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:43,544
Just be real. Like John Ford
said to Ben Johnson,

1208
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,047
"Just be real."
Isn't that right, Mr. Brickman?

1209
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:48,913
Beats the shit out of me.

1210
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:51,419
That is such a crock.

1211
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,095
Are we in a movie?

1212
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,897
Everything's a movie.

1213
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,528
Talking pictures.

1214
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,301
- That's all it is.
- Talking pictures.

1215
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,104
Cheesy dreams...

1216
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:17,907
while Huckleberry Finn goes
fishing on the edge of the moon.

1217
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,379
Who's Ben Johnson?

1218
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:21,541
He was in <i>The Last Picture Show.</i>

1219
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:22,777
Just like us.

1220
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:26,720
- Don't move, my love. Be still.
- Be real.

1221
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:31,724
He's gone.

1222
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,906
You know, when my little Ruthie died,

1223
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,277
I'd look into that mirror and I'd say,

1224
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,316
"Bette, honey, this is it, girl.

1225
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,443
The show's on the road,
and you've got to get up and get at 'em."

1226
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,544
- It's so sad.
- Oh, I don't know.

1227
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:36,387
Something...
insurance or credit fraud,

1228
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,017
something like that, honey.

1229
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:42,554
<i>- How fast will your car go?</i>
<i>- In honest miles-an-hour...</i>

1230
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,030
I have to go now.

1231
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,227
I'll see you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

1232
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,133
Okay. Thank you, dear.

1233
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,832
Are you sure you don't need me
to help you pack?

1234
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:51,964
No.

1235
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,474
What are you looking for?

1236
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,100
Are you okay?

1237
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,475
- Yeah.
- You take care of yourself.

1238
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,806
Take care.

1239
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,552
Okay. See you.

1240
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,217
I just...

1241
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,916
need to find my...

1242
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:12,825
money.

1243
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,966
What a moron!

1244
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,149
It's not too hot for you,
is it, lady?

1245
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,122
Oh, it is a bit.

1246
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,351
But it sure is beautiful out here.

1247
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:51,723
Pretty warm.

1248
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,592
I got us some candy bars.

1249
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,688
Hi. How you doing?

1250
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,768
Nuts, potato chips.

1251
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,326
Oh, good. That's great.

1252
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:05,237
- Have a nice day, sir.
- Thank you.

1253
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,383
Something bothering you, mister?

1254
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:22,083
No, something bothering you?

1255
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,023
Yes. I don't like being watched

1256
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,583
or stared at, for that matter.

1257
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,810
Detective Buzz Larabee.

1258
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,612
I need you to identify a body.

1259
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,850
So...

1260
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,691
how well'd you know him?

1261
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,493
I worked part-time at his bar,
the Chelsea.

1262
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,592
And when did you see him last?

1263
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,000
Tuesday night.

1264
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,301
- This was at the bar?
- Yes.

1265
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,701
So, what did you talk about?

1266
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,243
We didn't talk much.

1267
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,176
When I got off work that night,

1268
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,807
Mort escorted me to my car
in the parking lot.

1269
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:57,147
He was like that... polite,
always looking out for me.

1270
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:00,552
He told me to take care and...

1271
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:03,615
gave me a few days off
to bring my aunt up here to Vegas.

1272
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,627
- Anything else?
- Yes.

1273
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,668
A man called Bonhoeffer.

1274
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,400
Freaky, the whole
day had been like that.

1275
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:23,467
How?

1276
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:27,140
I'd seen this man earlier on TV,
Felix Bonhoeffer...

1277
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,081
- Who?
- Felix Bonhoeffer.

1278
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,675
That's what he called himself.

1279
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:33,051
- I don't think it was his real name.
- Why not?

1280
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,919
He was involved in a shootout.

1281
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,548
Now, involved in a shootout?

1282
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,058
What do you mean?

1283
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,062
He was with my friend Tracy
in his car when it happened.

1284
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:43,688
Well, what's this
got to do with Mort?

1285
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:44,790
Who?

1286
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,834
The guy on the slab, lady,

1287
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,427
your friend in the freezer.

1288
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,240
Are you okay?

1289
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,610
No. Can I sit down?

1290
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,171
Let me get you some water.

1291
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,876
Tiddles!

1292
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,753
Hi, Shelley.

1293
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,026
Where's the kitchen?
I gotta get this lady some water.

1294
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,396
It's through there.

1295
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:20,527
Are these two okay?

1296
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:23,036
- They're channeling.
- All right.

1297
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:43,615
There you go.

1298
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:44,920
Thanks.

1299
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:50,257
What happened next?

1300
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,300
He calmed down
after a few minutes,

1301
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:55,531
so Mort asked if it was okay
to leave us together.

1302
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,595
You know, was it safe.

1303
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,140
He said he had to go.

1304
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,233
Okay. Then what?

1305
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:05,838
He got into his car and started
to drive out of the parking lot.

1306
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,508
"...he started to..."

1307
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:11,576
He got into his car
and started to drive...

1308
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:15,180
"...of the parking lot...

1309
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,919
and then..."

1310
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,498
<i>Dinner's ready.</i>

1311
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,860
Dinner's ready.

1312
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,065
Okay. I'll be there in a moment.

1313
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,403
How's it going?

1314
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,042
I don't know. It's a...

1315
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,602
little strange.

1316
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,272
Like you.

1317
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,449
Hi, Stormy.

1318
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,047
<i>Hello.</i>

1319
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:51,490
Do you want to read
what I've just written?

1320
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,120
No. Later, love.
Come on, dinner's ready.

1321
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,357
- Come on.
- I will, I'll be there.

1322
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,640
That was nice, thank you.

1323
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:17,549
Eat your salad, it's good for you.
It's organic.

1324
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,519
I hate salad.

1325
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:22,648
- Bunny food.
- <i>The actor died.</i>

1326
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:25,659
<i>You know, he was falling all over</i>
<i>the place, he was perspiring,</i>

1327
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:28,161
<i>and I don't know,</i>
<i>his gun fell from his hand...</i>

1328
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,221
<i>And then the next thing,</i>
<i>he collapsed.</i>

1329
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,393
<i>He collapsed, and so that was...</i>
<i>I don't know, that was it.</i>

1330
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,834
<i>You know, the actor died.</i>

1331
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:38,168
<i>We were left high and dry, literally.</i>

1332
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,265
<i>- Wow.</i>
<i>- Yeah, wow.</i>

1333
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:43,209
<i>But the spooky thing was...</i>

1334
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:44,905
<i>What?</i>

1335
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,540
<i>Well, I don't know how</i>
<i>to describe it. It's like...</i>

1336
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:50,449
<i>it's like we have no control</i>
<i>over anything.</i>

1337
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,818
<i>It's like we're being</i>
<i>pushed about by something.</i>

1338
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,754
<i>Everybody on the set felt it.</i>

1339
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,724
<i>It was like a big joke.</i>

1340
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:58,885
<i>Ajoke?</i>

1341
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,521
<i>- Yeah, a joke.</i>
<i>- It was really strange.</i>

1342
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:04,157
<i>- How?</i>
<i>- Well, the guy who wrote it...</i>

1343
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,100
<i>- He did it for a laugh.</i>
<i>- That's what we heard, anyway.</i>

1344
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,228
<i>Who wrote it, Gavin?</i>

1345
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,399
<i>- I don't know.</i>
<i>- Nobody knows, really.</i>

1346
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:15,910
<i>Nobody knows who he is</i>
<i>or where he came from.</i>

1347
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,539
<i>It's kinda scary.</i>

1348
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,081
How do you mean, scary?

1349
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:22,139
Like when you're a little kid...

1350
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,247
and it's dark...

1351
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,422
you keep thinking that you see
somebody you don't know

1352
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,117
looking at you through a window.

1353
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,887
It's kinda like a dream.

1354
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,465
Oh, shit!

1355
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,333
Can't you control your pages?!

1356
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,802
Oh, my God.

1357
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:58,479
<i>Where the hell is he?</i>

1358
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:05,684
<i>Felix!</i>

1359
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:09,187
<i>Hey, Felix! Felix!</i>

1360
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,526
<i>So?</i>

1361
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:15,053
What?

1362
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,621
<i>What happens next, man?</i>

1363
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,667
Search me.
I don't have a clue.

1364
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,799
<i>You schmuck. Schmucko!</i>

1365
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:28,702
You talking to me?

1366
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:31,371
<i>Who in the hell do you think</i>
<i>I'm talking to?</i>

1367
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,380
Leave me alone.
Give me a break, will you?

1368
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,177
<i>You just killed Barbara.</i>

1369
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,378
- Who?
- <i>My script supervisor, dummy!</i>

1370
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:39,886
- So what?
<i>- She's the one person</i>

1371
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:42,185
<i>who's been holding</i>
<i>this thing together.</i>

1372
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,691
<i>There's a lot of people</i>
<i>with their dicks flapping in the breeze,</i>

1373
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,159
<i>and they're pissed off at you, man!</i>

1374
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,958
<i>What... what... what's...</i>
<i>what's going on around here?</i>

1375
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:52,991
<i>I don't know this place.</i>
<i>I don't know this place.</i>

1376
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,628
<i>Garvin, baby!</i>

1377
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:01,135
- <i>Where am I?</i>
<i>- We're inside Bonhoeffer's computer.</i>

1378
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,369
<i>Like viruses.</i>

1379
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:03,706
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1380
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:06,043
<i>We're inside his hard drive, man.</i>
<i>Think about it.</i>

1381
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:07,376
<i>You are nuts.</i>

1382
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:09,542
<i>Okay, so I'm nuts,</i>
<i>but look in the corner.</i>

1383
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,018
<i>Do you see?</i>
<i>That's Felix sleeping in that chair.</i>

1384
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,180
- <i>Who's Felix?</i>
<i>- He's the writer.</i>

1385
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,824
<i>I eat writers for breakfast.</i>

1386
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:21,624
<i>Listen, I can't talk right now.</i>
<i>I'm in somebody's hard drive.</i>

1387
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,222
<i>Did somebody say Felix Bonhoeffer?</i>

1388
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:27,291
<i>- Well, who the hell are you?</i>
<i>- Buzz Larabee, detective.</i>

1389
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,860
<i>I've gotta question</i>
<i>this Bonhoeffer guy, whoever he is,</i>

1390
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:31,997
<i>and what do you two</i>
<i>know about him, anyway?</i>

1391
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:33,598
<i>He's a writer.</i>
<i>What's there to know?</i>

1392
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,973
<i>He was involved</i>
<i>in a shootout on the freeway.</i>

1393
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,439
<i>- A shootout?</i>
<i>- A shootout.</i>

1394
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:41,505
<i>I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!</i>

1395
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:46,543
<i>Yeah, I knew there was something</i>
<i>about that guy with the stupid accent.</i>

1396
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,179
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

1397
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,520
<i>Look in there, over there to the left.</i>

1398
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:53,686
<i>See him sleeping in the chair?</i>
<i>That's him. There he is.</i>

1399
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:56,458
<i>So that's him.</i>
<i>How can I get to him?</i>

1400
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:58,624
<i>- No, don't disturb him.</i>
<i>- Why the hell not?</i>

1401
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,260
<i>- Because he owes me, that's why.</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

1402
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:03,497
<i>A conclusion.</i>
<i>He keeps killing people off.</i>

1403
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,869
<i>Tell me about it, huh?</i>

1404
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,374
<i>Especially when he's tired.</i>
<i>He needs to sleep.</i>

1405
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:10,673
<i>He's extremely dangerous,</i>
<i>especially when he's tired.</i>

1406
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:14,011
<i>That's why I have to lock</i>
<i>this creep up... he's dangerous.</i>

1407
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:19,110
<i>I hate writers. I always have.</i>
<i>Did he write this garbage?</i>

1408
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:21,485
Would you mind
taking out the garbage?

1409
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:22,818
<i>- Who's that?</i>
<i>- Who is that?</i>

1410
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,483
<i>- His wife.</i>
<i>- Wife?</i>

1411
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,356
<i>His wife.</i>

1412
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,622
<i>I know that voice.</i>

1413
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,357
Love, the garbage?

1414
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,558
<i>Gina, don't wake him, Gina.</i>

1415
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,692
<i>Gina, please don't wake him.</i>

1416
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,793
Love?

1417
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,709
Love, can you please
take out the trash?

1418
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,311
What? Sorry.

1419
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:56,380
Can you please take out
the kitchen trash before you go to sleep?

1420
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,050
I don't want it to smell up the house.

1421
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,388
Okay. Hi, Stormy.

1422
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:02,122
- Come on, love.
- All right.

1423
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,433
God Almighty.

1424
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,205
Why'd you kill me off like that?

1425
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,541
What?

1426
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,672
Why'd you kill me off like that?

1427
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,580
I didn't kill you off.
What are you talking about?

1428
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:26,382
Shit, man, you killed me in scene 23.
I got the script right here.

1429
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:27,978
Keep your voice down.

1430
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,647
There, see?

1431
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:33,159
I was supposed to go to scene 32.

1432
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:35,351
You were?

1433
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,660
Yeah, man, my part
was a lot bigger than this.

1434
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,597
I had three more scenes.

1435
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,158
Oh, I don't remember that.

1436
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:43,768
Look at scene 32.

1437
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,238
That was supposed to be me.

1438
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:48,901
I was supposed to come in and yell...

1439
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,569
Stop doing this!

1440
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,140
So they didn't shoot it
the way I wrote it?

1441
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:57,014
Man, Matt Dobbs
was rewriting everything.

1442
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,815
He was all over the place...
all over the director, everyone.

1443
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,753
- Who was the director?
- Gavin.

1444
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:04,087
Gavin, yeah, I remember.
He was very good.

1445
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,626
He was a pussy on this thing.

1446
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,719
Nice guy, but he had no control.

1447
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:10,492
Matt Dobbs was directing
the fucking movie.

1448
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,557
He was? Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know that, Mort.

1449
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:17,162
My name's not Mort, it's Phil.

1450
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:18,729
Phil Henderson?

1451
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,900
Phil, I'm sorry, Phil. I didn't...

1452
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:22,841
So, who's Mort?

1453
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,138
Mort is the character
I was playing, man.

1454
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,148
What's wrong with you?

1455
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,582
Oh, the hole in the head.

1456
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:35,155
So, this guy was directing everything?

1457
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,485
Everything, man.

1458
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,253
He had us doing line readings.

1459
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:41,420
He kept saying he knew
Pacino and Scorsese.

1460
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:42,986
Big fucking deal.

1461
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,793
He kept saying things like,

1462
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:47,266
"I was out last night,
and I was talking to Bobby,

1463
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:48,859
- "and Marlon was there..."
- Hey, Leo!

1464
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,167
"...and Marlon said this,
and Bobby said that,

1465
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,366
and Al, you know he loved improv."

1466
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:54,840
- All that crap.
- Actors.

1467
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,003
Maybe that's why the jerk-off died.

1468
01:21:57,078 --> 01:22:00,275
He had to have total control,
you know what I mean?

1469
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:04,512
A power freak.
Even Gavin went nuts at one point.

1470
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:08,181
You remember that speech about
<i>The Invasion of the Body Snatchers?</i>

1471
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,553
Body snatchers? No.

1472
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:12,286
- You didn't write that?
- No, I didn't write it.

1473
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,727
I knew it. I knew it.
This guy was a piece of work.

1474
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:19,528
He just took off on this speech
about body snatchers in a movie.

1475
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,795
Don't you see the dailies?

1476
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,860
No, I'm not allowed
near the set, that's why.

1477
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,372
Well, you wrote the movie,
and it was a good script.

1478
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,464
It was very good.

1479
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,941
In fact, that's the only reason
I took the movie.

1480
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,477
It was a big break for me.

1481
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,206
So, someone died?

1482
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,683
Yeah, Matt Dobbs.

1483
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:39,186
You wrote the part of Ray
for an African-American, right?

1484
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:40,312
I did?

1485
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:43,050
Yeah, man, what's wrong with you?
Are you on drugs?

1486
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:44,421
No, no, I'm not on drugs.

1487
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:48,019
Ray, the character that Matt Dobbs
was playing, was black.

1488
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,360
Matt Dobbs
wasn't a black actor, man,

1489
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,559
he was white, like her.

1490
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:55,395
Oh, my God.

1491
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,700
Why did you kill me off, Felix?

1492
01:22:57,772 --> 01:23:01,230
- Barbara.
- I was just the script supervisor.

1493
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:02,776
That's all I was.

1494
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:04,038
It's Barbara.

1495
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:05,875
Now you have no continuity.

1496
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,740
Nothing makes sense anymore.

1497
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,587
It's so unfair.

1498
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,420
It's just so unfair.

1499
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:23,428
So unfair.

1500
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,092
<i>Go.</i>

1501
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,670
Mommy.

1502
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,073
Oh, my God.

1503
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:37,236
Let's get a doctor, an ambulance.

1504
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,301
Oh, God.

1505
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:46,481
It's okay, man. It's okay.

1506
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,022
Yeah, they gave him
a thorough checkup.

1507
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:52,958
Bloodwork was fine,
and the heart is great.

1508
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,191
They even gave him
a brain scan, but he's fine.

1509
01:23:57,132 --> 01:24:00,260
What happened was
I went into the den...

1510
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:04,237
Love, can you take out the trash
before you lock up, please?

1511
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:05,897
The kitchen trash.

1512
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:09,034
Love, can you please take out
the trash before you lock up?

1513
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,099
Are you okay?

1514
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,174
I can't move.

1515
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:16,115
I couldn't wake him up.
He said he couldn't move,

1516
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:18,015
so I just called the ambulance,

1517
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:19,781
and we got him to the hospital.

1518
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:21,344
I guess he's just stressed out.

1519
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:24,517
He's been working so late
on this project of his, but he's fine.

1520
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:25,820
I'll see you at the hospital.

1521
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,420
No escape.

1522
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,159
<i>We got him to emergency,</i>

1523
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:06,496
<i>but couldn't find</i>
<i>anything wrong with him.</i>

1524
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,126
<i>He's right as rain.</i>

1525
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:09,465
<i>Terrible pain.</i>

1526
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:12,729
<i>So, when they gonna</i>
<i>let you go, honey?</i>

1527
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:15,139
<i>Maybe Tuesday.</i>

1528
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:18,805
<i>Maybe not today, maybe tomorrow.</i>

1529
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,245
<i>Life.</i>

1530
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:38,529
<i>Hi, Felix.</i>

1531
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:50,908
<i>Felix.</i>

1532
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:13,762
Hi.

1533
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,003
I'm Dr. Geekman, and this is
my associate, Dr. Stuart Cohen.

1534
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:23,543
So, you're ready to go home?

1535
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:27,975
The good news is we can find nothing
physically, organically wrong.

1536
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,450
- Absolutely nothing.
- It could be just stress, right, Stu?

1537
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:34,147
Right, stress, anxiety, perhaps.

1538
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:35,814
Has he been under stress?

1539
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:37,881
I'm sorry, you're his wife?

1540
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:39,790
- Gina, hello.
- Hi, Gina.

1541
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,624
Has he been under stress,
under pressure?

1542
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,425
He's been writing a screenplay.

1543
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:47,298
He's a bit obsessive about it,
stays up most nights writing,

1544
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:49,996
but other than that
he's actually okay, Doctor.

1545
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:53,598
- You're an all-or-nothing kind of guy?
- Yes, he is.

1546
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,836
Lots of people
around this town like that.

1547
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,003
Need to relax, let go.

1548
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,138
Yeah, let go.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

1549
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:04,980
Has your husband ever been diagnosed
as suffering from bipolar disorder?

1550
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,749
He just thinks he's losing his mind.

1551
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:11,656
He thinks he's going crazy, Doctor.

1552
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,719
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Is there anything you can do?

1553
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:18,197
Well, like Stu said, just complete rest.

1554
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:19,426
Yes, complete rest.

1555
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,468
Lots of sleep and easy does it.

1556
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:25,131
Moderation in all things.
You know, the golden rule.

1557
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:32,676
<i>You're next!</i>

1558
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,478
Okay, well, no physical activity
for a few days,

1559
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:39,486
and complete rest,
lot of sleep, you know?

1560
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:42,451
We could try some medication.

1561
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:45,287
- Oh, no, Doctor, no drugs.
- Does he smoke?

1562
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,453
- No.
- Alcohol?

1563
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:49,257
No.

1564
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:52,595
Be good to yourself. Relax.

1565
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:53,861
Thank you.

1566
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,159
Hello?

1567
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,001
Thank you, Doctor.

1568
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:48,445
Are you okay?

1569
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:50,817
Yeah.

1570
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:53,553
Are you sure?

1571
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:03,898
Hello, Felix.

1572
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:10,867
What are you doing?

1573
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:12,412
I've gotta get out.

1574
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,971
- I've gotta get out of here.
- What are you doing?

1575
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,385
God!

1576
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:23,487
Don't!

1577
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:24,752
Please stop.

1578
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:26,794
Love. Love!

1579
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:27,919
I've got to get back.

1580
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:30,828
It's 4:00.
It's 4:00, my time's up.

1581
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:32,593
My time's up. I've gotta go back.

1582
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,897
- Please don't be crazy.
- My time's up.

1583
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:36,129
Hold it.

1584
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,831
I've gotta get back.

1585
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:38,894
We're almost home.

1586
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:40,804
- I'm here to help.
- Please don't hurt him!

1587
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,003
We're not gonna hurt him.
Is he on some kind of medication?

1588
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:46,808
No, he's just been released
from the hospital, officer.

1589
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:48,644
Okay, so he's not
on anything right now?

1590
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:50,240
No, he's just been under
a lot of stress.

1591
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:51,876
Morning View Highway.

1592
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,615
All right, take it easy.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

1593
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,623
Hey! Wait, wait!

1594
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,724
What's that, dear?

1595
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:35,729
Oh, yes, I heard.

1596
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:37,128
I heard.

1597
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:39,496
Poor old Felix.

1598
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:47,908
Cut. That's lunch, everyone.

1599
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:48,964
That's it.

1600
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:38,753
You're pulling my chest hairs!

1601
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:44,550
You're next.

1602
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:50,556
Go, go, go.

1603
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:04,490
- Hi.
- Hello.

1604
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:06,423
So, you're ready to go home?
