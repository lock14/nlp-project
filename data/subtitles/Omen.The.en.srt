00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,395
Do you notice anything unusual?

494
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,441
No. Sorry.

495
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,653
At first, I thought this was
just a fault in the film.

496
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,244
It was a strange coincidence.

497
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,503
Then it happened again.

498
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,757
<i>Interesting, don't you think?</i>

499
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,303
And this...

500
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,638
I took on the day that you
were at the rugby match.

501
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,349
- Same thing.
- Only it's more pronounced this time...

502
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,935
and it's actually making
contact with the body.

503
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,066
And the rest, ofcourse— history.

504
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,069
I can't explain it.

505
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,993
And that's why I started digging.

506
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:21,205
The coroner's report shows that
he was riddled with cancer...

507
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,624
high on morphine most ofthe time.

508
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,960
- Injected himselftwo or three times a day.
- He knew that he was dying?

509
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,046
Apparently, yes.

510
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,468
He said that he wanted to be
forgiven by Christ.

511
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,264
Externally, his body
was perfectly normal...

512
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:43,060
except for one small thing in
the inside of his right thigh.

513
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:46,438
- What is it?
- Three sixes.

514
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,942
<i>666.</i>

515
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,697
- Concentration camp?
- That's what l thought.

516
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,367
But the biopsy says
it's a birthmark.

517
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,162
The best is yet to come.

518
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:15,592
Pages ofthe Bible—
thousands ofthem.

519
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,303
Every inch ofwall space covered,
even the windows.

520
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,227
<i>He even needed to be</i>
<i>close to his church.</i>

521
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:33,860
There are 47.
l counted them.

522
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:37,281
I think he was trying to keep
something out. Don't you?

523
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:41,577
The police thought he was insane,
so they didn't mind me coming here...

524
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,663
and rummaging around
to see if l could find anything of use.

525
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,005
The first item...
is a diary.

526
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,760
It didn't say anything about him.

527
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,513
It's about you—
what time you left the house...

528
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,932
where you went,
what restaurants you had your lunch in...

529
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:07,227
what time your speaking
engagements were.

530
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:12,524
The last entry says that he was supposed
to have met you in Bishop's Park...

531
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,693
and that was dated the day he died.

532
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,406
But the really important
items are here.

533
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,492
lfwe're to get to the bottom ofthis,
we've got to start here.

534
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:29,333
This first clipping is from
<i>the Astrologer's Monthly.</i>

535
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,836
It reports
an unusual phenomenon—

536
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,632
a comet changing shape
into a glowing star...

537
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,593
like the Star of Bethlehem
2,000 years ago.

538
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,970
Only this one was on
the other side ofthe world—

539
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,057
the European continent—
five years ago.

540
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:48,852
The sixth ofJune, to be exact.

541
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,981
Does that date mean anything to you?

542
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,108
Yes.

543
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:58,487
Then you'll recollect
this other clipping.

544
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:02,658
It's a birth announcement
from a Rome newspaper...

545
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:06,078
also dated the sixth ofJune,
five years ago—

546
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,747
the day your son was born.

547
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:12,501
Sixth month, sixth day.

548
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,089
Was your son born at 6:00 a.m.?

549
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,844
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out
this birthmark— the three sixes.

550
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,519
My son is dead.

551
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,442
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

552
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,448
lfyou wouldn't mind, Mr. Thorn,
l'd like to help you try and find out.

553
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:48,120
No. It's my problem.

554
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,500
No, sir, you're wrong.
It's my problem too.

555
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:00,924
When l came here with the police,
l took some photographs.

556
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,554
I happened to catch sight
of my own reflection in that mirror.

557
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,407
I know you must think I'm crazy,
but I'm so frightened.

558
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,161
Don't be afraid.
You'll be all right here.

559
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,413
You'll be perfectly all right.

560
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,961
Oh. Some all right.

561
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,339
What about Damien?

562
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:45,260
I'll speak to Mrs. Horton.
She'll look after him.

563
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,520
<i>Mrs. Horton.</i>
<i>Mrs. Horton?</i>

564
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,942
- Mrs. Baylock.
- Sir?

565
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,069
- Where's Mrs. Horton?
- Gone.

566
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,949
- Gone out?
- No, no. They've gone. Theyjust got up and went.

567
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,286
They left an address foryou
to send their last month's wages to.

568
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,499
Didn't Mrs. Horton say anything?

569
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,294
- Didn't Horton leave any explanation?
- No.

570
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,880
But don't worry, sir.
l can manage.

571
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:35,352
- I'll look into this when l get back.
- Just as you wish, sir.

572
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,813
<i>- And, Mrs. Baylock.</i>
<i>- Sir?</i>

573
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,649
Last night, I saw that dog
in Damien's room.

574
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,151
- I clearly told you—
- He's gone now, sir.

575
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,862
They took him away this morning.

576
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,235
No. No.

577
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,701
This is the right address.

578
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,213
Apparently, there was a terrible fire
and the old hospital burned down.

579
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:54,514
Five years ago.

580
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,728
- [ Italian ]
- Okay.

581
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,909
<i>Well, surely the fire</i>
<i>didn't destroy everything.</i>

582
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,870
- There must have been some records.
- [ Speaking ltalian ]

583
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,498
I sorry. I think everything
was destroyed.

584
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,835
Isn't it possible that there were
some papers stored elsewhere?

585
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,297
- I do not know, signore.
- Sister.

586
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,591
This is most important to me.

587
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,760
I adopted a child here.

588
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,012
l'm searching
for some records of-

589
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,806
- There were no adoptions here.
- There was one.

590
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:40,060
<i>- No, signore.</i>
- It wasn't an actual adoption.

591
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,604
- You are "mistake."
- Wait.

592
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,689
Birth records.

593
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,067
- lf l gave you a date, an exact date.
- No.

594
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:49,069
- No.
- lt's no use.

595
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,613
The fire started in the hall of records,
in the basement.

596
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,449
All the paperwork was there—
went up like a torch.

597
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,669
Shot up the stairwells.
The third floor became an inferno.

598
01:05:57,754 --> 01:05:59,996
- The third floor?
- The nursery and maternity wards.

599
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,208
- Nothing left but ashes.
- You will excuse me, uh?

600
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,669
- What about the staff?
- Hmm?

601
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,254
- Surely some survived.
- Sí, some.

602
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,299
There was a tall man,
a priest—

603
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,760
dark eyes, piercing eyes.

604
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:16,638
<i>Ah, sí!</i>
<i>Padre Spiletto.</i>

605
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:19,140
- Yes.
<i>- Hewas principale.</i>

606
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,810
- Yes, he was in charge. Is he—
- Yes, he is alive.

607
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,895
- ls he here?
- No.

608
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,316
<i>- Where?</i>
- He's in a monastero in... Frosinone.

609
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,862
<i>Many were taken there.</i>
<i>Many die.</i>

610
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:36,700
<i>Perhaps he is die since,</i>
<i>but he lived through the fire.</i>

611
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,995
I remember. People say
<i>itwas un miracolo.</i>

612
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,621
Frosinone?

613
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:45,667
<i>Sí. Il Monastero di San Domenico.</i>

614
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,794
<i>- Mille grazie, signora.</i>
<i>- Prego.</i>

615
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:14,654
- Here we are.
- What is it?

616
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,657
- "When theJews return to Zion" —
- That's it— the poem.

617
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:20,368
"When theJews return to Zion."

618
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,538
And there was something
about a comet.

619
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:27,834
Yes. That's here too. The shower
ofstars and the rise ofthe Roman Empire.

620
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:31,254
These are supposed to be the events
that signal the birth ofthe Antichrist—

621
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,339
the devil's child.

622
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,598
<i>[Jennings ]</i>
<i>It's making more sense.</i>

623
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:45,643
<i>TheJews have returned to Zion,</i>
<i>and there has been a comet.</i>

624
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,937
And as for the rise
ofthe Roman Empire...

625
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,191
scholars think that could well mean
the formation ofthe Common Market.

626
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:54,069
- The Treaty of Rome.
- Bit of a stretch.

627
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,404
Well, what about this?
ln Revelations, it says...

628
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,074
"He shall rise from
the eternal sea."

629
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,869
Well, that's the poem again—
"From the eternal sea, he rises...

630
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:06,206
creating armies on either shore"—
That was the beginning of it.

631
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:09,042
And theologians have already interpreted
the "eternal sea"...

632
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,377
as meaning
the world of politics—

633
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:15,673
the sea that constantly rages
with turmoil and revolution.

634
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:21,679
So the devil's child will rise
from the world of politics.

635
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,829
Looks like this is as far as we go.

636
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,914
Let's have a look.

637
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,586
Found him?

638
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:40,902
<i>His mind is active, but, since the fire,</i>
<i>he has not made a sound.</i>

639
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,571
We feed him
and take care of his needs.

640
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:47,779
- And we pray for his recovery
when his penance is completed.

641
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:48,910
- What penance?

642
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,829
"Woe to the shepherd
who abandons his sheep.

643
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,041
May his right arm wither
and his right eye lose its sight."

644
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:58,002
He's fallen from grace.
Can you tell us why?

645
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,255
<i>For abandoning Christ.</i>

646
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:03,299
- How do you know he's abandoned Christ?
- He told us.

647
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,301
But he doesn't speak.

648
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,553
There is some movement
in his left hand.

649
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,764
He was able to write it down.

650
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:17,438
You will notice the curved line
over the head.

651
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:21,567
This indicates the hood
ofthe monk— his own hood.

652
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,904
- The three sixes.
- Six is the sign ofthe devil.

653
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,906
But why three ofthem?

654
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,575
We believe it signifies
the diabolical trinity:

655
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,454
the devil, Antichrist
and false prophet.

656
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,540
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, huh?

657
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,792
For everything holy,
