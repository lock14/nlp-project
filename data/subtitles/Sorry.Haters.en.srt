1
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,158
Sorry. Haters.

2
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,560


3
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,293
S-s-sorry. Haters.

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,668
Sorry. Haters.

5
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,726
Gotta go.

6
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,581


7
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,121


8
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,460


9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,432


10
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,026


11
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,230


12
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,866


13
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,358


14
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,079
But even those two things
is still not the reason why

15
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,019
this is the favorite room.

16
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,147
So let's show you.

17
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,658


18
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,818
Excuse me.

19
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:53,332
Um, is it much certain if I deposit now
the money is banked for me tonight?

20
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,513
Only thing can say is
ain't mad at ya.

21
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,710
Sorry. Haters.
Gotta go.

22
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,723
Please, officer.

23
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,229
If I have ticket,
it make the whole day I work for nothing.

24
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,287
Mm-hmm.

25
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,422
Can you just drive uptown and I'll let you
know in a minute where we're going?

26
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,997
Uptown, the west or east?

27
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,107
We have passed
93rd Street, miss.

28
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,215
Uh, Englewood Cliffs.
In New Jersey.

29
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,845
Um, I can give you directions
if you need.

30
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,065


31
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,539


32
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,512


33
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,974


34
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,027
Just pull over right here.

35
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,728
Can you stop here, please?

36
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,933


37
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,732
Thank you.

38
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,651
How's the painting
coming, sweetie?

39
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,884
Um, would you mind
if we just sat for a while?

40
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,486
Miss, I'm sorry, but, uh, it is late.

41
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,861
No, I'm gonna need to go back
to the city.

42
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,093
Just not now.
Just in a minute or two.

43
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,426
Okay?

44
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,270
Look, whatever amount
you made last night,

45
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,709
I'll pay you
with a 15% gratuity, all right?

46
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,512
I think that's more than fair.

47
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,474
So, h-how much do I owe you?

48
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,180
Um...

49
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,219
Uh, I made 160 last night, miss.

50
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,826
And I think
that you can pay me half now.

51
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,192
That is to me fair, too.

52
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,168

Mommy's here.

53
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,910
What do you think?
Should we keep it? Huh?

54
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,449
You know how to tell
whether a car's good or not?

55
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,711
You gotta kick the tires.

56
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,856


57
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,557


58
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,862


59
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:44,050
I prefer that if you're gonna cheat me, that
you don't insult me at the same time, sir.

60
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,715
'Cause there's no effin' way...

61
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,225
There's no effing way
you made 160 last night.

62
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:55,025
I'm sorry, but I told only the truth of it.

63
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,967
Look, I don't care, okay?

64
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,801
I don't care, because if I were you,

65
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,273
I'd be cheating all of us, too,
every second I got.

66
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,534
So, can we go now?

67
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,003
Can we go?

68
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,248
No, hold it.

69
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,353
48th and 10th, please.

70
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,121
And I do appreciate that you waited.

71
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,265
Miss?

72
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,108
Uh, Mrs.

73
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,272
Madam...

74
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,247
Uh, w-w-would you mind this much?

75
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,877
If I could stop to drop something.

76
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,942
Sure.

77
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,545


78
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,015


79
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,007
Oh, I've gotta make a stop, too.

80
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,136
You want something?

81
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,978
Oh. You sure
you need something just now?

82
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,176
Oh, yeah.

83
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,652


84
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,148


85
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,530
Sorry.

86
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,495
You forget how things are
so much cheaper outside the city.

87
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,577


88
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,446


89
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,579
Oh, and, um, she doesn't have to
go to all the trouble to dress the baby.

90
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,385
You know, if you wanna go up,
I can wait down in the cab.

91
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,192
Vous parlez français?

92
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,954
Uh, no. 
No, I don't speak it.

93
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,722
Three years of it in school.

94
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,668
You know, I pick up a word or two
when I hear it, but no.

95
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,974
You might try to speak it, you know.

96
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,572
Languages are one of the many best thing
each person can have.

97
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,682
Yeah, well, let me keep working on this.
We'll see how brave I get.

98
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,777


99
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,414


100
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,482


101
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,405
Um, can you just leave some music on
or something?

102
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,375
Oh, I'll be just a minute.

103
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,206
Sorry, but I need my same keys.

104
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,743


105
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,360
Hi. Okay.

106
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,727


107
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,129
Okay.

108
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:30,764
Ow.

109
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,008
Certified postal check.

110
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,485
Certified postal check.

111
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,546
Mm-hmm.

112
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,356
- Okay?
- Non.

113
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,752


114
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,819
- Okay?
- Okay.

115
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:52,886
Merci.

116
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,829
Okay. 

117
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:03,902
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I just... I forgot to give you something.

118
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,001
I am coming down.
We can go now.

119
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,071
No, no, I didn't bring it for you.
L... I got it for you to give to the baby.

120
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,005


121
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,847
I'm sorry, but I got it at a liquor store,

122
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,116
so it has a rum sticker on it,
but it's still sort of cute.

123
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,486
Yeah.

124
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,583
Um, would you mind
if I used your bathroom?

125
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,884
Please? The toilet?

126
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,055
Uh, no.

127
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,730
Great. Okay?

128
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,394
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted to be home.

129
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,403
Yes, but I don't live here.

130
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,005
Oh. Well, then I'd best
make it quick. Okay.

131
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,110
I also have... I have an extra one of these
if anyone's game.

132
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,272
I don't know.

133
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,988
Can I hold him?

134
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,091
Can... Will you ask her
if I can hold the baby?

135
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,164
Um... 

136
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,568
Here. Hi.

137
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,631


138
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,199


139
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,304
Is this your only nephew?

140
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,909
Uh, uh, in the United States, yes.

141
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,884
But where... where's your brother?

142
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,513
Doesn't he live here, too?

143
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,153
N-no, no.

144
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,320
But... we think soon.

145
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,724
I'm sorry.
I know it's rude of me to pry.

146
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,857
It's okay.

147
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,826


148
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:45,074
She... she like to know
if you really are fan of the Q-Dog?

149
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:49,911
Um, it's complicated, but mostly
because I'm responsible for it now.

150
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,576
Um, last year I was made
head of programming,

151
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,712
which means that I choose
all the new shows, so...

152
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,689


153
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:02,056
W-w-we don't understand so much.

154
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,324
Ask her is she's seen any
of Sorry. Haters.

155
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,124
It's my biggest hit.

156
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,293
It's about how rich and famous people
spend their money

157
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,736
on the most ungodly cars and houses
and diamond-studded scooters

158
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,866
just so everybody who can't get that stuff
feels like nobodies.

159
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,933


160
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,374
Sh-she likes that show.

161
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,608


162
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,207
Thank God, because
if it doesn't stay hot, I'm finished.

163
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,185
You know what?
Let me just run through this.

164
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,515
It's interesting that you ask

165
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,819
because I just wrote all of it down
yesterday from the shrink.

166
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,886
So we make fat kids
wanna kill themselves,

167
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:40,330
we make high school kids spend their
college money on nose jobs and implants,

168
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,923
made it cool for grade school boys

169
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,435
to call little girls
and their teachers B's and H's.

170
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,667
Historically speaking, we've now
reassigned the birth of Christ to 1981.

171
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,868
Humiliating reality shows,
and last but not least,

172
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,312
we've made sure that music sucks
progressively every year we've been on.

173
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,612
And that, good people,
is all I've got to show for my sorry life,

174
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,379
so what do you guys do?

175
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,613
I mean, I guess
I know what you do, but...

176
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,747
Oh, no.

177
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,815
I... I have a PhD in chemistry.

178
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,597
In Syria,
I work with... with the casting of metals.

179
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,098
Wow.

180
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,467
So are you submitting resumes
to U.S. Companies now or?

181
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,166
I hope to start again sometime, yes.

182
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,401
Wow.

183
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,900


184
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,844
Aw.
Everybody's a crybaby tonight, huh?

185
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,906

But I think I'm still the champ.

186
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:32,973
Don't you?

187
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,622
I was surprised that you didn't kick me out
of your cab back in Englewood,

188
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,125
so... thank you.

189
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,889
It's not our life.

190
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,988
We can ask if you don't want.

191
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,358
You better
hold him a minute for this one.

192
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,131
Anyway...

193
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,065
Long story short,

194
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,077
the man who was my husband
wanted to paint.

195
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,246
Uh, art?

196
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,510
While I wanted to be a big, fat success.

197
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,015
And it's all we thought about.

198
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,350
It was...

199
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,652
But eventually, we beat all the odds,
and we both won.

200
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,217
And we rewarded ourselves
with our daughter

201
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,663
who came to us
seven years ago tomorrow.

202
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,365
Oh. Almost today.

203
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,494
Ah, well, happy birthday, Smitty.

204
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,129


205
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,299
And it's funny,
'cause we agreed with you, A-shade,

206
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,104
that languages are truly
probably the most important...

207
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,644
Ashade.

208
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,736
Sorry?

209
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,007
Ashade.

210
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,481
Oh, Ashade.
Sorry. 

211
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,177
Okay. Ashade.

212
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:46,183
So, we wanted Smitty to learn Mandarin
as all us hip couples do these days.

213
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:53,027
And we hired a native Chinese tutor,
and the first year,

214
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:57,057
this woman worked very hard

215
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,730
to win my daughter's affections over me.

216
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:05,766
And then the next year, she worked not so
hard to win my husband's affections, too.

217
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,480

So sorry, Mrs. Maclntyre.

218
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,515
Oh, so sorry. So sorry.

219
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:15,519
Um, uh, now, uh, your daughter,
she's not with you?

220
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,282
Not as yet.
No, not as yet.

221
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,290
She's, uh...

222
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,521
No, I was doing my job and...
you know, which for me means

223
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,427
that I smoke
an occasional marijuana cigarette

224
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,989
with whoever today's
rapper/convicted felon du jour might be,

225
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,592
and Paul got it on camera,

226
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,504
and in so doing,
he got my daughter and the house

227
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,510
and a nice fat allowance
to share with his little yellow Yoko.

228
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,411
Uh... 

229
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,675


230
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,143
Is that right?
Is that... did I say that right?

231
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,654
- It's her turn?
- Yes.

232
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,013
Come on.

233
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,986
We don't need to stay too much.
It's to us a family problem.

234
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,757
And mine wasn't?

235
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,800
Has she lost her husband, too?

236
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,462
P-please don't...

237
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,402
If I can, I would like to pray
and drive you home.

238
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,739
Oh, yes. Yeah.

239
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,073
Ashade.

240
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,239


241
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,907
No, no.

242
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,507


243
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,610
Uh, you know, you should let me see it.

244
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,679
'Cause I'm very good at proofreading,
and maybe I could help somehow.

245
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:25,745
Yes.

246
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,876
Hello?

247
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,277
Harry, are you there?
It's me... Philly.

248
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,053
Listen, please call me
as soon as you get this,

249
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:03,857
'cause, um, well,
'cause I've got some new friends, Harry,

250
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,760
and they need that favor you owe me.

251
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,829
Actually, it's on a complete freebie,
because we've got, I don't know,

252
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:16,067
probably about, oh,
about a whole $720 for ya,

253
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,439
which is a lot more
than you're worth these days.

254
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,570
Anyway, the deal as far as I know it is

255
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,276
that my friend's brother
is from Syria originally,

256
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,749
but is a Canadian citizen.

257
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,945
Uh, more than 10 years.

258
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:33,754
For over 10 years living in Canada,
and was changing planes at JFK

259
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,090
and just because many years ago
somebody he hardly knew

260
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,824
witnessed a lease he signed,

261
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,525
and that guy is on some FBI list,

262
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,262
they took him to Guantanamo
as a suspect.

263
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,065
Uh, second tier.

264
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,935
A second tier suspect,

265
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:51,840
which means
that they just deported him to Syria,

266
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,209
uh, where's he's probably
gonna be tortured and maybe even killed,

267
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,372
and they know that.

268
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:01,511
Um, so his wife has now written a letter
to the state department,

269
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,383
which we want you to execute.

270
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,516
She's here, she's Canadian,
and she doesn't have a Visa.

271
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:11,653
So we wanna know if we need to have it
sent to you from Quebec somehow.

272
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,255
You know what? Just call me as soon
as you get this message, all right?

273
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,301
And I'll be up late. Okay.

274
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,596
All good.

275
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,902
MAN ON RADIO:
# see the clock in shadow #

276
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,537
# And see your face #

277
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:34,142
# You and me belong
in the same time and place #

278
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:40,158
# People never celebrate
the things they've got #

279
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:45,390
# Honey. Without you.
Wouldn't have a lot #

280
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:53,769
# feel beautiful #

281
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,966
Yeah, I've got a place not far from here,

282
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,533
but like I said,
I'd like for us to sit, wait for a bit.

283
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,870
You don't have to do that.

284
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,946
I mean, honestly, Ashade,

285
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,506
it would kill me to see you
give your money to some other lawyer

286
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,678
that's just gonna rubber stamp
some papers.

287
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,412
And Harry will call soon.
I know it.

288
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,949
You want coffee?

289
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,553
Oh. I would like much
if I get it for you.

290
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,427
Oh. Thank you.

291
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,274
I have some cream and sugar.

292
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,871
Oh, no, black is good for me.
Thank you.

293
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,317
Oh, thank you.

294
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:22,850
You should know that Eloise is so happy
for what you do for us.

295
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,129
She doesn't sleep.

296
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,166
But maybe now she knows
that there is nice people, too.

297
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,664
I just... I feel so horrible for her.

298
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,364
I ca... I can't imagine.
Can't imagine.

299
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,339
Their first baby and everything.

300
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,470
What?

301
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:48,713
My brother also has 20-years son
from the time he married before.

302
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,948
Ashade, that needs to be in our letter.

303
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:55,492
You're right, but my brother
and the first son of his

304
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,755
were together at the airport.

305
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,965
And we believe they are together now.

306
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,092
Jesus. Ashade...

307
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:09,234
In my country,
when they do some torture,

308
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,366
they do it by the mind.

309
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:18,012
They... they show you your mother
or your son

310
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:24,886
and then they take them in the next room
and you know nothing.

311
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,989
You hear things,
but you don't know anything certain.

312
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,724
Just your imaginations.

313
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,935
Can you take me to my office now?

314
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,095
Now?

315
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,504
Did you think
it was gonna break down?

316
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,706
I know.
I've been here 11 years.

317
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,278
A lot of things break down,
but never the elevator.

318
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,847
Anyway, this is it.

319
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,690
My creative team's over there,
my PR guys there.

320
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,956
Accounting in here.

321
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,990
Those clowns you need to avoid
like the plague.

322
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,056


323
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,237
You can leave the door open.

324
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,638
Oh, sorry.

325
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,000
Have a seat.

326
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,581
Oh, yeah.

327
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,316
There it is.

328
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:35,853


329
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,916
Please, sit.

330
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,163
Hey, Harry Fine.
It's me, Philly again.

331
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:44,565
Listen, um, I left you a really long message
on your other number

332
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:48,436
about an urgent situation,
so just call it, get it, call me back.

333
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,996
Got it?
And you know what?

334
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,703
I'm gonna beep you, too,
so don't make me wait.

335
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,211
Just to show you I'm not
a bitter woman through and through.

336
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,341


337
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,612
That's me and Paul
and our daughter

338
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,450
and the lovely little homewrecker
on the left.

339
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:14,459
So, Ashade, is it like a Muslim rule
that you have to wear the beard?

340
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,692
Oh, no, but, um...

341
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,036
uh, as a sign of my devotion.

342
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,668
I try again.

343
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,941
Well, I can't blame you for trying,
but you know, you're not an old man.

344
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,411
No.

345
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:35,312
And the man has to wear the beard
and the woman has to wear the...

346
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,718
Wow.

347
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,948
Allah must really be something, huh?

348
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,052
He's not something.

349
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:46,587
For us, we find him...
he's everything.

350
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:50,198
And he's not passive,
like a lot of the other ones.

351
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,860
I really like that.

352
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,938
- But Eloise is not Muslim, right?
- No.

353
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,408
No. And that's not a problem
for your brother?

354
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:05,677
I would not say so much,
but, uh, the whole family loves Eloise.

355
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,915
So it's all very complete.

356
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,249
Mmm.

357
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:14,717
But you would never find yourself with
one of us Western women, would you?

358
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,624
Um, do you have... do you have a wife?

359
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,256
Or a woman somewhere?

360
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:27,430
At the moment, I'm sending money home
and keeping watch of Eloise.

361
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,235
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I can see that.

362
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,236
See what?

363
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,642
Oh, nothin'. Nothin'.

364
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,012
Um, when was the last time?

365
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,051
That you had a girlfriend of your own.

366
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,012
Not so long.

367
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,612
Are you lying to me?

368
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,680
'Cause, remember,
I caught you once before.

369
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,555
160 bucks?

370
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,421


371
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,555
Shoot! We have to go.

372
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,499
Otherwise, I have to
fill out papers till dawn.

373
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,327
Come on, come on.
Come on.

374
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,735
We're gonna go to the roof.

375
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,531
Hurry.

376
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,906
Okay.

377
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,717
Don't worry,
they never come up here.

378
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,781
Oh.

379
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:23,983


380
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,155
Yep. He's stuck at the beach house.

381
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,596
I felt it vibrate when we were running.

382
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,870
So... 

383
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,040
You think you can
call Mr. Fine still or no?

384
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,638
Yes, I can.
If you still want.

385
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,179
Yes.

386
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,974
I feel that you feel he will help us.

387
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,076
I do wanna ask you a question, though.

388
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:54,248
But don't take this as anything
but a simple question.

389
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,728
Are you sure that your brother
is completely clean?

390
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,224
Clean?

391
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:10,031
That he doesn't have anything to do
with any kind of threats?

392
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,336
Oh, of course, no.

393
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:15,573
My brother is a holy man.
He's a doctor.

394
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,971
Okay.

395
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:21,976


396
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,255
Hey, Harry.

397
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,692
So you thought you could run away
for the weekend already, huh?

398
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,130
And you got my message?

399
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,801
What do you mean you looked into it?
How do you look into it at five...

400
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,565
Well, call him back!

401
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,839
Yes! And tell him
that my friend's brother and his son

402
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,207
probably have got their testicles
hooked up to a car battery

403
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,745
in some Damascus basement.

404
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,115
What? I shouldn't have to
spell out for you

405
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,953
how much money I generated
for your firm this year, Harry.

406
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:03,919
All right, fine. Fine.

407
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,724
You go back to sleep,
but you think long and hard

408
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,265
about who really paid
for that little beach house.

409
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,527


410
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,466
It's okay.

411
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,869
No, it's not okay.
It's not okay.

412
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,733
I just... I feel bad
that we let us rely on him.

413
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,102
But you know why
he's not interested?

414
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,337
Because he knows we can't win.

415
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,150
Even if we get your brother back,
unscathed, where is our satisfaction?

416
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,183
What do we have to show
for his pain and suffering?

417
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,921
Please, don't go to be too stressed.
It's all right.

418
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,089
What do you want me to be?
You want me to be passive?

419
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,057
I mean, come on, Ashade.

420
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,226
Don't get me involved
and then expect me to just roll over

421
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,634
because some Jew boy
doesn't wanna do his job.

422
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,501
Ashade, do you...

423
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,839
You hate Americans, don't you?

424
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,202
No.

425
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,204
- No?
- No.

426
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,783
With you,
I'm disappointed very much, but, uh...

427
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,184
Disappointed?

428
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,288
Disappointed?
Did you really just say that?

429
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,389
How...

430
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,957
I don't understand.

431
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,998
Do you really care,
what they're doing to your brother?

432
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,936
In any country and in any religion,

433
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,946
the punishment is supposed to
fit the crime, right?

434
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:33,472
Your brother has committed no crime,
so there is a miscarriage of justice.

435
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:38,454
And in turn, where there is an injustice,
there needs to be a retribution.

436
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,991
L... I don't understand "retribution."

437
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,795
I'm not talking about doing
anything more or anything less

438
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,989
than what they've already accused
your brother of doing.

439
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,626
I'm not talking about hurting anyone.
Really, I'm not.

440
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:55,635
I am talking about
causing a little damage, symbolically.

441
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,906
Now, I don't know anything
about munitions,

442
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,947
but that's what the Internet's for, right?

443
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,142
So that people like us can learn things
that they don't want us to know?

444
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,610
I want to go now. Thank you.

445
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,356
You're gonna need a code for that.

446
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,558
So, let me just finish.

447
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,132
Okay?

448
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,168
Look...

449
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,303
We do an act of retribution,

450
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,144
we get you out of the country,

451
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:42,277
we tell the people that sent your brother
to Syria what you've done,

452
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,820
they have to let him go.

453
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:45,646
They will listen.

454
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,588
I'm telling you.

455
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,593
You dial the code,
and I'm go home now.

456
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,163
Go ahead. I'm not your doorman.

457
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,104
342 is the code.

458
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:12,679
Oh, and I hope you have fun telling
the security guards what you're doing here.

459
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,378
I'm sure they're gonna believe
every word you say.

460
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,458
I'm going to fucking kill you,
you little punk!

461
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,227

Go, go, go, go!

462
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,655


463
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,129


464
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,035


465
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,903


466
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,674
Oh, sir, yes, yes. Yes.

467
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:52,273
Yes, you will have certified
postal check today, yes.

468
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,982
Yes. And for you,
I have almost, uh, uh, 500...

469
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,322
O-oh, sir, sir.

470
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,587
L-I'm sorry to be bother, but...

471
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,087
If I may, I call back.

472
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,690
L... I will soon. Sorry.

473
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,033


474
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,262
Ashade.

475
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,597


476
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,958
Hi.

477
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,937
Okay, pretty dog.

478
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:25,703
Let the lady put her things down
and we'll take of you and only you.

479
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,806


480
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,791
This is the stairway to my room.

481
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,732


482
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,539


483
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,576
Keep it stocked
for the late night booty calls.

484
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,408
Can actually see Japan from here
if needed to.

485
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,607
This is my collection.
These are my toys.

486
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,082
That's my home base. Q-Dogs.

487
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,244
Sorry. Haters.
You gots to go.

488
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,311


489
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,880
I think stainless is masculine...

490
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,783


491
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,192
All right, Q-Dogs.
We're gonna keep rocking.

492
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,235
Moving on to the '90s.

493
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,771


494
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,741
# Tell me that you wanna hold me #

495
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,640
# Tell me that you wanna bore me #

496
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,205
# Tell me that you gotta show me #

497
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:50,014
# Tell me that you need to slowly #

498
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:53,750
# Tell me that you're burning for me #

499
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,553
# Tell me that you can't afford me... #

500
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,815
Come here, Smitty.
Come here.

501
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,177
Don't ignore me.

502
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,411
Don't ignore me.

503
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,862


504
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,202


505
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,595
Yes?

506
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,004
Ashade?
T's me. Philly.

507
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,639
How you get to this phone?

508
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,304
Your number is listed
on the letter that we wrote,

509
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,712
which I still have, by the way,

510
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,513
and which I still think
it would be very smart of you to use.

511
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,953
Are you there?

512
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,548
I am, yes.

513
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,185
Listen. It's the money
you're mad about. Isn't it?

514
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,355
I'm sorry about that, okay?
But Harry is a very good lawyer,

515
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,491
and he does require a consulting fee.

516
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,035
And he will help my family?

517
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,969
Well, no. See, the fee was for
what he did the other night.

518
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,269
For making that call
about what the laws are.

519
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,638
You return our money.

520
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,939
I need this money for us today!

521
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,343
Okay, listen,
I can get you some money, okay?

522
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,540
That's not a problem.

523
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:28,278
And I realize that it was wrong
to leave you with nothing,

524
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:32,083
but first I feel like we should talk...

525
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,783
about what I was suggesting.

526
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,520
Just want the money
returned to me!

527
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,255
Why could you try to hurt us more?!

528
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,819
Hurt who. Ashade?

529
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,195
I mean, do you really think
that we can get something done

530
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,166
by just writing a bunch of letters?

531
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:49,036
Depending on lawyers is for losers,
and I'm just not one, okay?

532
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,802
Now. would just go
and get retribution on my own.

533
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:56,370
But it wouldn't mean anything unless
people believed a brave Muslim did it.

534
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,177
People are terrified of you, Ashade.
You have that power.

535
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,718
You stop, you stop, you stop!
You stop!

536
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,776
You know what?
You don't make any sense.

537
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,049
Unless your brother
did something to hurt you.

538
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,490
He did. Didn't he?

539
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,860
He got to be a doctor while you need to
drive a cab so you can send money home.

540
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,230
Bet you're just so jealous of him.

541
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,737
'Cause he gets to have sex
with sweet white Eloise

542
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,362
if we bring him home.

543
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,404
And all you get to do
is masturbate to her

544
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,205
if you get ten minutes
to yourself. Right?

545
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,439
Never you call to me again, okay?!

546
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:32,277
You apologize to me right now.
Do you hear me?

547
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,375
- You apologize to me right now.
- Fuck you!

548
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,851
Fuck you! You crazy!

549
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,287
You bitch! Fuck you badly!

550
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:44,685
You know that I don't speak like that,
and I don't wanna be spoken to like that.

551
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,561
Do you know who I am? Huh?

552
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,192
You little cabby nobody.

553
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:55,363
You sorry little camel jockey.

554
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,134
You apologize to me right now

555
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,937
- before I find a reason to hurt you.
- You bitch!

556
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,376


557
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:38,671


558
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,756


559
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,655


560
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,722


561
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:41,600
Merci.

562
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,583


563
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,466


564
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,419


565
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,895
I got it.

566
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,138


567
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,880


568
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,247


569
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,911
Listen. We know
that's his cab, all right?

570
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,649
If he's hiding somewhere in the building,
we're gonna find him.

571
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:00,849
Mrs. Mouhanna.

572
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,986
Shh! Shh.

573
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,688
Shh.

574
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,894
Just relax, ma'am.
Your son is fine.

575
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,195
No!

576
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:15,996
No!

577
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,072
#... breeze like a motherfucker #

578
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,940
# Young thugs and OG's
like a motherfucker #

579
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,511
# Got a girl that roll deez
like a motherfucker #

580
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,310
# But no cheese. Oh. Please.
You's a motherfucker #

581
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,147
# He don't care. 'cause
'm a dawg like a motherfucker #

582
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,949
# Small talkin'.
And got charm like a motherfucker #

583
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:22,005
Um, can you drive uptown
and I'll let you know where in a minute?

584
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,363
Sure. Why not?

585
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,033
I'm on till midnight.

586
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:41,387
You know what? Um, can we
just go to 48th and 10th, please?

587
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,556


588
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,659


589
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,431
Never mind.
I'll just get out here, okay?

590
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:01,132
Here you go.

591
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,007
Keep the change.

592
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,435
If it's true that you really don't
speak any English,

593
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,444
we'll find an interpreter
for you tomorrow.

594
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,742
An A-shade somebody.

595
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:22,183
Medallion number 67 GDT34.

596
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,050
The phone call she's talking
about here, it may be you.

597
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,522
... oveneard him talking to a woman
on his cell phone

598
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:32,528
about causing some real damage
and waking up the arrogant Americans.

599
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,587


600
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:40,220
Thank you.

601
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,321
Ma'am.

602
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,901
Aah! Motherfucker!

603
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,067


604
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,645
I imagine it's for you.

605
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,046
No, not at all.
I don't have that problem.

606
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,811
Oh, geez. I wish.

607
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,344
Yes?

608
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,480
This is for me to deliver to Philly.

609
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,545
Who?

610
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:54,962
Uh... Philly.

611
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,090
You mean Phyllis?
Phyllis Maclntyre?

612
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:02,304
Oh, please.
Nobody is helped if we waste the time.

613
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,881

# Ten. Twenty. Thirty. Forty #

614
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,977
# Tell me that you wanna scold me... #

615
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,988
Next time, make sure they call
so have it scheduled.

616
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,300
So after everything Q-Dog
did for you last year...

617
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,600
Have a seat.
She'll be right with you.

618
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:38,106
You gotta give me the cover.

619
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:41,200
Listen, I really hope that this is
the last time we have to go over this,

620
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,973
and I left all the info
on your other number,

621
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,742
so call it, get it, call me back.
Got it?

622
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,575
Uh, so, who was it
that told you to call me Philly?

623
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,087
It wasn't Caymen, was it?

624
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:57,190
Hi. Come on, 'fess up.
No one's called me that in ten years.

625
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:01,888
Um...

626
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,294
Phoebe? She was the one
who told you to call me that?

627
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:07,358
Yes.

628
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:10,464
You're joking.

629
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,003
And how do you know Phoebe?

630
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:19,245
W-we passed the night once
a few days before.

631
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,740
Really?

632
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,147
God bless you, man.

633
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,189
Someone needed to take her
off the shnide, didn't they?

634
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,150
I'm sorry. That was mean.

635
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,424
It's okay.

636
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,758
So is that for me
to listen to, or, um?

637
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,230
Oh, no, no. Uh...

638
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,427
I was only trying to
see Phoebe a moment.

639
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,904
She was to help me
to write a letter in English.

640
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,702
Oh. Yeah.
She was always good for that.

641
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:49,108
Myself, I can't even write a postcard
without one of my secretaries.

642
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,476
Scott, can you help us out

643
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:54,142
and, uh, get Phoebe Torrence up here
before she runs away to lunch?

644
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,878
MAN ON SPEAKER:
Sure thing. Philly.

645
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,385
Okay, don't call me that.

646
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,479
Please, sit down.
It'll be just a second.

647
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,317
Hello. It's Mac for Connors.

648
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,487
Connors. Maclntyre.

649
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:07,689
Good news.

650
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,429

Yeah, 'cause we got the cover.

651
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,366
Thank you.
I am a genius.

652
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,234
Oh, 'cause it's gonna be perfect.
We're talking about perfectly with...

653
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,766


654
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,174


655
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,555
Connor, you heard
the good news, didn't you?

656
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:37,116
Well, that's okay,
'cause I already bumped them.

657
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,119
No, I bumped them from...
you know, to October's cover.

658
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,686
It's not gonna be that big of a deal.

659
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:47,134
'Cause I... you know, because I promised
the girls in marketing.

660
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,467
That's how we got the cover.
W-well, it doesn't matter.

661
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,530
I've seen them five times.
I've already given up my tickets...

662
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,942
Phoebe, I'm very sorry
I don't call you first, but, uh...

663
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:04,409
I have lost the number
for the home you have in Englewood Cliffs.

664
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,149
That's fine. That's fine.
It's nice to see you again.

665
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,247

Hey, Phoebes.

666
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,313
Hi.

667
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,155
Glad you could find my office.

668
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:14,924
Oh. Yeah, no, I stopped by
not too long ago, but you weren't here.

669
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,024
Yeah, right.
I'm so hard to track down.

670
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,069
So, um...

671
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,694
Habib.

672
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:25,298
Habib says you spent a night with him...

673
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,433
helping him write a letter.

674
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,840
Oh! Yeah.

675
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:33,042
Uh, I was helping him, and, um...
but I thought we finished.

676
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,916
Well, according to what he tells me,
um, you're not.

677
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,419
Oh.

678
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,786
Well, I'm sorry.
It's just for the long hours,

679
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,724
it's hard for me
to do a lot of edit work.

680
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,886
Oh. Right!

681
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,159
Like you're so busy now
that the tax report is already filed.

682
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,497
Oh, I was just, uh, you know,
making sure that he was okay with you.

683
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:55,003
L... You didn't introduce me
so I didn't know what to think.

684
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,596
Oh. No, it's... it's fine.

685
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,006
So are you guys going to lunch?

686
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:03,637
Paul and Devon are on their way in,
so you're more than welcome to join us.

687
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,305
Oh, today's not so good.

688
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,544
Oh, hey. You always say that.

689
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,176
Look, if you have to feed Smitty,

690
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,380
uh, we can even go to Peppe's,
and you can just run upstairs.

691
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,047
How's that for accommodating?

692
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,649
Phoebe...

693
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:19,820
Paul's gonna have his guy who does,
you know, his frames for him there.

694
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,057
- Okay, okay.
- Great.

695
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,656
I'll see you guys downstairs
in a couple of minutes.

696
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,894
Oh, uh, very sorry. I can't.

697
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,797
Um, but, uh, it was very nice
to see both of you.

698
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,605
- Very nice.
- Oh, okay.

699
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,177
Phoebe.

700
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,548
If you leave our letter for me down,

701
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,452
I will pick it down from there tomorrow.

702
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,552
- It's nice to meet you, Habib.
- Great.

703
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:51,482
Bye.

704
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,531
Uh, Phoebe.
Wait, Phoebe.

705
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,499
- Yeah?
- Are you okay?

706
00:58:58,568 --> 00:58:59,899
Yeah.

707
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,371
Was that not cool?
Like, l... I'm sorry, I didn't know him so...

708
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:07,000
No, no, it's fine.
I'm just helping him out a little bit.

709
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,737
Write a letter.

710
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,005
And did it work?

711
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,910
I... I...

712
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,848
Well, if it's a legal thing,
I could just call good old Harry Fine for you.

713
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:15,907
Oh, good.

714
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:19,682
I'm so glad you're coming to lunch.
I'll meet you down there, okay?

715
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,096
Someone might pick this up tomorrow.

716
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,637
- There she is.
- Hey!

717
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:45,545


718
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,015
Let's run for pasta.
Run for pasta!

719
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,483
Run for pasta!

720
00:59:58,227 --> 00:59:59,785
- Up on the curb!
- Wow, that was pretty high.

721
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:03,093
I just don't think it's gonna be a problem.
I think you have enough pieces for January.

722
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,226
- It's not a matter of quantity, it's quality.
- I know, but it's a great...

723
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,032
Paul, don't talk to me about quality.
Your stuff is so great.

724
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,334


725
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,139
Yeah, you tell her.

726
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,772
Paul and I mentioned
a couple of times, that Gary,

727
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,646
the guy we're meeting for lunch,
he might not be a bad hookup for you.

728
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,686
But, you know, don't worry, because...

729
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,948
He's a very nice guy,
but there's no pressure.

730
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,580
If you don't wanna see him again...

731
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,458
- No. Fine. Fine.
- Good.

732
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,727
I'm gonna go feed Smitty really quick.
I'll be right back.

733
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,635
We'll wait for you,
so you don't have to walk in alone.

734
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:44,900
Okay.

735
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,217
What do you want for lunch?

736
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,221
Meatballs?

737
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,757
- Spaghetti and meatballs.
- Spaghetti and meatballs.

738
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,417
Spaghetti and meatballs.

739
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,702
He's here.

740
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,400
Here, I got it.

741
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,873
You wanna hold my hat, honey?

742
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:34,820
I want you to be totally honest.

743
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,052
Not about the paintings,
but about the pictures.

744
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,684
This is a part of a new series.

745
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:41,389
Very clean. Very simple.

746
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,489
- That's at...
- An insane asylum?

747
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:44,658
Yeah, upstate.

748
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,895


749
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,984
The New York Times Magazine
is doing a story

750
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,185
on artists who've moved out of the city
to get more room.

751
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,420
Oh, wow.

752
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,098
Phoebes,
don't you know that menu by heart?

753
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:20,033
They didn't suddenly fly in a new chef
from Bologna or anything, did they?

754
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,767
So, did you, uh...
did you go to school for accounting?

755
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,813
It's just something
that I thought I could do, you know?

756
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:35,246
How many years have you
worked at, uh... at, uh, Q-Dog?

757
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:39,379
Well, actually, we started
the exact same day eleven years ago.

758
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,184
They used to call us
the Phoebe and Philly show.

759
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,246
Paul didn't tell you that?

760
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:43,622
No.

761
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:46,093
Wait, you were an accountant, too?

762
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,322
Worse. A sales rep.

763
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,385
You're not serious.

764
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:51,661
I was just this, uh, little
loser nerd girl from Queens.

765
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,065
It's true. She was.

766
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,730
And, uh, Phoebe was this...
can you believe this?

767
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:58,865
This straight-laced Calvinist
from Buttstuck, Michigan.

768
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,375
They just stuck the two oddballs
together in the same cubicle

769
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,969
because they didn't know
what the heck else to do with us.

770
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,411
I don't even really know anymore.

771
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:11,976
I was talking to my shrink about it,

772
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,490
and about how people are saying
that the reality of what we do

773
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,890
is making, you know,
fat kids wanna kill themselves

774
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,326
and, you know,
little girls wanna get implants...

775
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,590
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
Hold on... I just...

776
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,132
Oh, it is. It's time for my wife to try
talking like she hates her job again.

777
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,531
Oh, oh! Okay!

778
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:28,035
You know what,
I don't hate my job, all right?

779
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:32,063
I answer to no one, and I'm
very well compensated for it, thank you.

780
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,235
Actually, if you want to know how well,
you can ask your new friend in accounting,

781
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,508
because she can probably
tell you to the dime.

782
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:42,607
I'm good, though.
I'm pretty good at it.

783
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:47,088
Anyway, I thank God
I have a life to go with it,

784
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,989
and a very dear old friend
to thank for it.

785
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,493
I still owe you my life, sunshine.

786
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:53,756
No, you don't.

787
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,623
Oh, no.

788
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,997
Oh, you bet
your sweet little tuckus I do.

789
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:02,697
You know, the truth is is that Phoebe
was the first to meet Paul

790
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,866
when she took
a painting class for fun at...

791
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:07,876
- At F.I.T.
- F.I.T.

792
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,037
God, man, if it wasn't for that,

793
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,672
I would've never had
my shot at the prize.

794
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,181
- The prize?
- Yes.

795
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,274
I'm a trophy husband.

796
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,684
Yeah. You're like a...
you're the heavyweight champion.

797
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,119
Mmm!

798
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,019
Actually, no.
Sorry, you're not the prize.

799
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,753
Devon is the prize.

800
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:25,851
Devon's the prize!

801
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,486
- Who's gonna eat one more tortellini.
- Yes.

802
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,030
- No.
- Come on, one more.

803
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,751


804
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,242
You hate him, don't you?

805
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,982
Who, Gary?

806
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,853
Of course you hate him.
Look, I know he's no heartthrob,

807
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:05,655
but, you know, I think he's at least,
you know, a good boost for you.

808
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,754
Anyway, I promise I'll run interference
on the way out of here.

809
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,822
Oh, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

810
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,889
- Oh, I can make it.
- Are you sure?

811
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,435
Yeah. It's fine.

812
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,697
Hey. Hey.

813
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,666
I really miss hanging out with you.

814
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,142
Don't you?

815
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,507
Oh, you're vibrating.

816
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,942
Oh, shit.
You know, it's our car mechanic.

817
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,314
- Do you mind?
- No.

818
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:30,374
I'm so sorry.

819
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,184
Hi. Yes.
Just let me get out of the restroom.

820
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,316
I needed it by... lf you can't have it for me
by this weekend,

821
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:41,523
then you need to park it in front of
my house before 9:00 A.M. On Monday.

822
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,994
An entire week
to paint one lousy door.

823
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:47,296
Phoebe, can you believe this?

824
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,201
The night that I brought
the new Lexus home,

825
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,932
you know, the one that's
supposed to shine like a diamond?

826
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,304
- Have you seen this car?
- Oh, no.

827
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,364
But you saw a picture of it, right?

828
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,103
You're not a Jazz fan, are you?

829
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,301
Honey, I didn't tell you.

830
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,610
The day that the ratings came out
and they gave me the car,

831
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:03,174
Connor sent a picture of the Lexus
to everyone at Q-Dog,

832
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,880
letting them know
that he rewards exceeding expectations.

833
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,479
It looked pretty good
for about a minute and a half.

834
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:08,887
I'm sure it'll be fine.

835
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,391
Some jealous kid
from the neighbonood

836
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:14,225
scratched A-L-Q-something
into the side door,

837
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:17,493
which I guess is supposed to mean
All Q-Dog, all the time.

838
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:18,726
Or Al Qaeda.

839
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,063


840
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,194
The car's all right now, though, right?

841
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,500
- Oh, it's fine.
- Listen, thanks for lunch.

842
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:26,166
Oh, but, Phoebe...
Where...

843
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:32,936
Smitty?

844
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:41,478


845
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,156
Where's my dog?

846
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,423
Call to him.

847
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:51,355
Please do.

848
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,129
I left your money at the desk!

849
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,727
Don't tell lie.
Call your dog.

850
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,501
What did you do to my dog?

851
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,439

What did you do to my dog?!

852
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,280


853
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,921
He did nothing to you.

854
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,617


855
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,385
Harry Fine is a real lawyer.

856
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,488
Ashade, I promise he is gonna
help you and Eloise, I swear.

857
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:23,793
You stop!

858
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:25,966
Call your dog!

859
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:27,326
Smitty!

860
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:29,337
Smitty! Smitty!
Call your dog!

861
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:30,429
Smitty!

862
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,303


863
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:40,642
Smitty!

864
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:42,810
Smitty!

865
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,123


866
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,159


867
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,383
Go outside, okay?

868
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,793
Go on, pretty dog. Go on.

869
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,125
Go to your spot.
It's okay.

870
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,858
It's okay.

871
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,894


872
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,235
If you're praying, don't do that here.

873
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:51,779
You're not better than me,
and I don't need you being better than me.

874
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:00,118
If you came here to fuck me,
then fuck me.

875
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,831
If you came here to kill me,
then you oughta just do it!

876
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:06,360
Do it!

877
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,536
I don't want it anymore.

878
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:13,574
I just want
what I deserve from you over with.

879
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,470
All right, fine.
I'll do it myself.

880
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:30,782
Oh, no.

881
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,722
Oh! Oh!

882
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:37,957
No!

883
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,433
Oh, no.

884
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:56,748
It would help me much

885
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,982
if you could tell to me why.

886
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,181
Why is it you could?

887
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,251
Why?

888
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:08,421


889
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:09,828
Tell me.

890
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,559
No! No, no, no, no.

891
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,659
No! Please! Tell me why!

892
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,226
Tell me why!

893
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:17,238
I have come here only to know.

894
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,069
No, it's Maclntyre.
It's the lawyer calling.

895
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:20,904
- Stop it.
- No, it is. It's the truth.

896
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:22,603
- Stop it! Stop it!
- It's the truth.

897
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,238
It can't be anyone else.
Ashade...

898
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,715
She said she'd call Mr. Fine for us.

899
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,014
Look.

900
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:33,145
Look.

901
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,621
Why?

902
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,157
Why you hurt me?

903
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,353
Why you hurt my family?

904
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:43,261
I have nothing now!

905
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:46,165
Not an idea what can I do for my life!

906
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,998
I have nothing!

907
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,939
You don't know why?

908
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:59,581
Well, you should know.
You should know.

909
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,727
Were you here that day?

910
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:22,626
Were you?

911
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,132
Well, I was here.

912
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,699
And I was piecing myself together for work
and the phone rang

913
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,802
and it was Philly.

914
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,307
And she was scared.

915
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:42,652
She never calls me when she's weak,
but she did.

916
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,488
She called me on that day.

917
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:55,301
And I had a dried-out cigarillo
from when her daughter was born.

918
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,375
And I smoked it and I felt fine.

919
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,405
I felt just fine.

920
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:11,810
Can't you see?

921
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:16,256
Can't you see what a cruel joke
that I'm stuck with?

922
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:21,785
Every day I ring up huge money
and never once is it mine.

923
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:22,990
Never once.

924
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,933
No savings,
no inheritance, no prospects.

925
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,597
And not a soul alive
that gives a hoot about me expect my dog.

926
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:42,875
So I think maybe all I can say
is that I just...

927
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,655
...hate me.

928
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:56,057
I just effing fucking hate me.

929
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,295
And I know it's wrong.

930
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:02,837
I know it's wrong
what I did to you and Eloise.

931
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:03,929
It was wrong.

932
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,198
It was wrong.

933
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,669
And I know I need help.

934
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,776
I know I need help, Ashade.

935
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:21,856
It's just that day,
that day I wasn't a failure, okay?

936
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,789
I was not a nobody.

937
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:28,957
I wasn't powerless
because everybody was powerless.

938
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:31,028
Everybody was.

939
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,107
I just wanted that day back.

940
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,503
I just wanted it back.

941
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,972
Can you do something for me, please?

942
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:52,053
Can you let me show you my phone?

943
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,701
You see what it says?

944
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:09,636
At least today I'm not a liar.

945
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:13,632
Yes.

946
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,950
You know that for Eloise...

947
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,780
I did nothing.

948
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:10,364
Not a... a thing of what you say.

949
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,139
But I think of her...

950
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,311
...in the wrong ways in my mind.

951
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,980
Too many times.

952
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:31,375
Too many times.

953
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:37,149
It's very good
my brother should come back to her.

954
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:29,669
Smitty? Pretty dog.
You in your spot?

955
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:33,314
Come here.

956
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,610
Come on. Come here.

957
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,087
Okay. Come on.
We have to go get breakfast.

958
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:49,553


959
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,933
How is it today you speak French?

960
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,536
Well, isn't it obvious?

961
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,310
It'd be too difficult in Arabic.

962
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,209
Oh, there's no ham.

963
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:15,222
Oh. I'm not worried.
Only hungry.

964
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:21,254
Mmm.

965
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:25,394
The message from Mr. Fine

966
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,867
only said to call to him, no?

967
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:30,700
Oh, no, the message said
to contact him first thing.

968
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,173
But it's up to you.

969
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,209
I don't have a problem
with going down to the office

970
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:38,303
and just waiting until he can see us.

971
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,473
What do you think?

972
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:43,309
With you I can go.

973
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,115
- C'est bonne?
- Mm-hmm.

974
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:50,590
It's delicious.

975
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:56,730
Um, Phoebe Torrence
left an envelope for me.

976
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,506
I think Harry's office is there.

977
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:44,402
Okay.

978
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,881
Come quick.

979
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,420
I just want you to look nice.

980
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,790
Jealousy!
You stop that right now!

981
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,592
You can't go into Harry's office
dressed like that.

982
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:04,131
You get in here.

983
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,824
There you go.

984
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,199
Okay.

985
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:10,827
Wait.

986
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,070
I have something for you.

987
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,344
What is this?

988
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:31,525
Something my parents gave me and for
some reason, I want you to have it.

989
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:47,264


990
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,218
Guy, you all right?

991
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,724
Go! Go! Go!

992
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,158
Go! Go!

993
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,831
# Tell me that you wanna scold me #

994
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:15,666
# Tell me that you adore me #

995
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:19,366
# Tell me that you're famous for me #

996
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:23,172
# Tell me that you're gonna score me #

997
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:26,806
# Tell me that you gotta show me #

998
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,682
# Tell me that you need to sorely #

999
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:34,518
# Time to tell your love story #

1000
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:38,286
# Time turning over and over #

1001
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:42,421
# Time turning four leaf clover #

1002
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,966
# Betting on the bull in the heather #

1003
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,409


1004
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:25,003


1005
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:44,852
# I feel beautiful #

1006
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,357
# Because you love me #

1007
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:58,037
# I water the tomatoes
and I think of you #

1008
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:03,939
# No one's ever watered me
the way you do #

1009
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:13,114
# I feel beautiful #

1010
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:19,192
# Because you love me #

1011
01:23:20,962 --> 01:23:26,264
# I feel like a creature
that is sleekly groomed #

1012
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:31,863
# Not some poisoned soul
that is alone and doomed #

1013
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:40,946
# I feel beautiful #

1014
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:47,614
# Because you love me #

1015
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:55,354
# I see the clock and shadow
and I see your face #

1016
01:23:55,430 --> 01:24:00,891
# You and me belong
in the same time and place #

1017
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:06,635
# People never celebrate
the things they've got #

1018
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:12,442
# Honey, without you,
I wouldn't have a lot #

1019
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:21,218
# I feel beautiful #

1020
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:26,484
# Because you love me #
