1
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:29,547
- We're not all descended from the Puritans.
- No?

2
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:32,759
There was another colony,
30 miles from Plymouth.

3
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:35,536
It's not on the maps today.
Merrymount.

4
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,489
Ah, right,
you mentioned in your book...

5
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,660
The colony where anything goes... went.

6
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,569
There was booze...

7
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:43,176
There was booze, fornication,
there was music...

8
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:45,390
They even...

9
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:47,472
you name it...

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,074
They even danced round the Maypole
once a month, wearing masks,

11
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:54,546
worshiping god knows what, Whites and
Indians together all going for broke.

12
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:56,587
Who was responsible for all of this?

13
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:59,843
A character by the name of
Thomas Morton.

14
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:03,444
Ah... The Hugh Hefner of the Puritans.

15
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:05,744
You can say that.

16
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:09,218
I will read you a quote of what the
Puritans thought of

17
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:11,256
Morton's followers.

18
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:14,772
"Debauched aliens and atheists
falling into great licentiousness

19
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,681
and leading degenerate lives. "

20
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:21,543
When I heard that, I packed my bags,
I left Oxford, I came straight to America.

21
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,236
America the licentious.

22
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,841
So what happened
to all of those people?

23
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:29,269
The Puritans shut them down,
they sent in Miles Standish,

24
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:32,307
Leading the militia, who chopped down the
Maypole, cut down those coloured ribbons,

25
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:35,259
Banners everything.
The party was over.

26
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,426
And we became a nation of
strait-laced Puritans.

27
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,379
Well...

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,679
Isn't that your point though?

29
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:45,718
The Puritans won.

30
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,582
They stamped out, all things sexual
How would you say?

31
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:52,273
- Sexual happiness.
- Exactly.

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,572
Until the 1960's.

33
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:58,045
Until the 1960's, where it all
exploded again all over the place.

34
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,996
Right, everyone was dancing

35
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:03,124
around the Maypole,

36
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:06,379
then, "make love, not war".

37
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,722
If you remember,
only a decade earlier,

38
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:12,324
If you wanted to have sex,
if you wanted to make love in the 1950s,

39
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:15,015
You had to beg for it,
you had to cop a feel...

40
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,533
Or get married.

41
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:19,616
As I did in the 1960's.

42
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:22,915
Any regrets?

43
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:25,128
Plenty.

44
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,124
But that's my secret.

45
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:29,946
Don't tell anybody.

46
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:32,333
That's just between you and me.

47
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,699
I think it was Bette Davis who said:

48
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:49,477
"Old age is not for sissies"

49
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,989
But it was Tolstoy who said that

50
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,897
"the biggest surprise in
a man's life is old age".

51
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,977
Old age sneaks up on you,

52
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:07,099
and the next thing you know you're
asking yourself, I'm asking myself,

53
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:10,006
Why can't an old man act his real age?

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,220
How is it possible for
me to still be involved

55
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,606
in the carnal aspects of the human comedy?

56
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,641
Because, in my head,
nothing has changed.

57
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:45,510
Her name was Consuela Castillo

58
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:48,201
and she was my student.

59
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:04,087
This course is called
"Practical Criticism".

60
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,558
So... Let's go!

61
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:10,293
Right to the big question, shall we?

62
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:12,853
Does "War and Peace"

63
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,586
become a different book
because we read it?

64
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,884
Yes, of course.
But why?

65
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:25,136
Because we bring something to the book?

66
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,350
We bring ourselves.

67
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:31,386
What's more, if you read the book again
in 10 years, it will change again,

68
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:33,383
because you've changed.

69
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,508
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

70
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,415
I've always been vulnerable
to female beauty,

71
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:42,888
Ms. Castillo was different,
her posture was perfect.

72
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,405
And she dressed like a
young associate

73
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,226
of a prestigious law firm.
There was a sophistication,

74
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:51,048
that set her apart.

75
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:53,695
She knows she's beautiful.

76
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,603
But she's not yet sure what
to do with her beauty.

77
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,292
No, don't take notes.
Because honestly, it's not worth it.

78
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,896
Really, don't give it a thought.

79
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,930
A work of art reminds you of
who you are now.

80
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:14,095
Since they posted the sexual harassment
hotline number down the hall from my office,

81
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:16,959
I never make private contact
with any of my students

82
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,389
until they've received their grades.

83
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,124
Afterwards I always throw a cocktail party

84
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:23,990
for the class.

85
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:25,769
And it's always a success.

86
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,492
Professor Kepesh,
we saw you on TV last night.

87
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:37,576
You were great.

88
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,137
Thank you. Charlie Rose was pretty
good too wasn't he?

89
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:42,740
Well, yes.

90
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,909
- You were great.

91
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,035
- Have a lovely evening.
- Thank you.

92
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:52,246
It's a colossus of perspective. It depends
on who's observing, right professor Kapesh?

93
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:55,110
Westerners see Islamic integralists as

94
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:57,107
primitive and dangerous while,

95
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,842
Islamic integralists see
Americans as depraved and corrupt.

96
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:05,006
Nothing's changed since the crusades.
We need an alliance of civilizations...

97
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,479
- Ms. Castillo.
- Hi, professor.

98
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,649
- Is this a real letter from Kafka?
- Yes.

99
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:13,774
Yes, it's one of the original letters

100
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:16,594
that he wrote to Milena.
It was a gift from someone.

101
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,201
Someone close to you.

102
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,936
Someone who was close
to me, Miss Castillo.

103
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:21,152
Consuela.

104
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:23,712
We're not in class.
We don't need to be so formal.

105
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,362
Consuela.

106
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:29,789
- Do you play the piano?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,393
Would you play for us?

108
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:35,431
Too many people.
I'd freeze.

109
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:43,070
You know there's something about you
that invites a kind of formality.

110
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:45,891
What do you mean?

111
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,060
You have a kind of elegant austerity.

112
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:51,967
Austerity?

113
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,703
Something like that.

114
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:56,222
Well, I guess I got that from my father.

115
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:58,217
He is austere...

116
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:01,039
and proud.
Very Cuban.

117
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:02,904
Cuban?

118
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,686
My whole family is Cuban.

119
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,985
I was 11 years old when I came.

120
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,415
Did you go straight to college
from high school?

121
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:13,496
No, I was a legal secretary
in a law firm.

122
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:15,752
You worked.

123
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,966
I tried it, but I didn't like it.

124
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,134
My parents always hoped
I would go to college,

125
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:24,388
So I made up my mind
and here I am.

126
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,899
I want to show you something.

127
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:36,542
- Here we are.
- Goya.

128
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:42,706
- What's this one called?
- "La Maja Vestida."

129
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:45,527
And?

130
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:48,781
- And?
- She resembles you.

131
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:50,691
You resemble her.

132
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:54,425
Really?

133
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:56,767
Yes.

134
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,764
I think so.

135
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:03,321
What do you think?

136
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,534
I don't know.

137
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,961
The eyes, maybe.

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,773
Why all this talk about Kafka,
Goya and her Cuban family?

139
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,852
Don't get me wrong, it's great that her
family's Cuban and she enjoys my class.

140
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:26,586
But I go on yakking away mainly
because I want to fuck her.

141
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,363
- What can I say?
- True.

142
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,490
The room is full of spies.

143
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:34,615
I love music.

144
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,523
Excuse me.

145
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:42,341
I love opera, my grandfather
takes me to the Opera,

146
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:44,945
And I adore theater.

147
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:48,633
I review plays for a magazine.

148
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:51,758
Would you like to go with me
sometime to the theater?

149
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,664
- Yes.
- Sorry.

150
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,091
Go to the theater?

151
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,347
- Why don't you take her to the prom?
- I get it.

152
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,604
This girl is...

153
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:10,032
She's a throw-back to a completely
different time. She has to be wooed.

154
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,896
I thought we were talking about sex.

155
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:15,543
You know for a Pulitzer Prize winning poet,

156
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,061
sometimes you display a
remarkable lack of imagination.

157
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:20,708
That's why they gave me the fucking prize.

158
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:24,875
Don't tell me you've never been
through the process of talking the talk.

159
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:28,997
That's why I have a family for
Christ's sake. I talk to them.

160
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:30,994
Maybe you should get married again.

161
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,034
George!

162
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:40,586
Talk the talk with your wife if you
feel like it, go to the museums,

163
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,018
look at all the Goyas that you want,

164
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,144
but keep the sex part just for sex.

165
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:48,833
Alright.

166
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:54,822
Do you really still talk
to your wife, George?

167
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:57,774
No. One all.

168
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,111
I'm not hitting that.

169
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:06,523
Sneaking off for a smoke?

170
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,908
- You know you shouldn't smoke.
- You tell me that

171
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:13,382
in this bed, every 3 weeks.

172
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:18,156
- I'm under a lot of pressure.
- I like to be consistent.

173
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,195
So do I.

174
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:23,668
You've been trying to get me
to quit smoking for 20 years.

175
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:26,316
Since the first day of your class.

176
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:29,397
Oh my God, your class made me smoke.

177
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,169
I'm under a lot of stress.

178
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,643
- Oh, how was Chicago?
- Cleveland.

179
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:41,203
Chicago was last week.
Atlanta's next week.

180
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,503
You sound like Cary Grant

181
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:49,320
in "North by Northwest".
Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha!

182
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:53,355
Ha ha, laugh, just try being a
woman running your own business.

183
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:55,786
I thought you liked
being your own boss.

184
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,956
I do. Oh, I do, I do.

185
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,990
Thank god for these little interludes.

186
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:04,944
That's all I can say.

187
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,660
Aren't you going to get that?

188
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,960
There's only one person in the world that
would call me at 2 o'clock in the morning

189
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,956
Leave a message.

190
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:27,209
Did you get my email?
I really need to talk to you.

191
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:33,112
Ah, I should have known better than
to think you'd be home at this hour.

192
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:36,715
Or maybe you are home and listening

193
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:39,232
to this, all snug and smug.

194
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,093
35 years old and he still hates my guts.

195
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:46,133
Well, you ran out on him.

196
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:48,434
I ran out on a marriage that
I got myself into out of youth

197
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,473
and fear a million years ago.

198
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,036
Sometimes you pay for liberation.

199
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:53,728
That's the price he pays
for being turned into

200
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,986
the heroic...

201
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:58,372
defender of the abandoned mother.

202
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:00,976
I mean if any one of us
could make it over the wall.

203
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,103
He sat on my case,

204
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:05,968
isn't there some statute of limitations?
I've tried.

205
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:08,789
Really, I've tried.

206
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,176
When he was 12 or 13 one time,

207
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:13,433
he came to spend the summer
with me, I took him to the Mets.

208
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:17,035
He spent the next five innings
throwing up in the men's room,

209
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:18,858
he's been throwing up ever since,
that phone call was him throwing up.

210
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:20,421
You know what's wild?

211
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:21,983
He's successful.

212
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,851
Kenny Kepesh,

213
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:26,845
A well respected doctor,
my son, the doctor.

214
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:30,230
He speaks passable French,
he's married with children.

215
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:34,136
It's only with me that he
regresses to what you just heard.

216
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:37,608
I'm sorry, he gets me going.

217
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:45,811
I thought you stopped reviewing plays.

218
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,242
Well, that one looked
kind of interesting.

219
00:13:51,757 --> 00:13:53,493
Too bad I'm going to be in Atlanta.

220
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,621
I'll go with George.

221
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,745
Religion, family,

222
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,870
Church, self-help books.

223
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,083
Men with teeth so white you'd think
there's a flashlight in their mouths.

224
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:08,381
Love, especially romantic love.

225
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,981
Flowers, mini-malls.

226
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,540
There is nothing more
depressing than a mini-mall.

227
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,798
- Mini-malls.
- Except perhaps

228
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:23,875
your flaws, your vices,
your mortgages,

229
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:28,303
your furtive looks to your
sleeping BlackBerry

230
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,473
- I do like blackberries.
- And this man,

231
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:35,898
who finds himself here,
dandruff falling of his head.

232
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:39,197
That was wonderful.

233
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:41,975
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

234
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:43,754
Thank you.

235
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,658
You'd like to go somewhere for a drink?

236
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,127
We don't have to...

237
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,855
I'm just not used to being
out with a celebrity.

238
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:03,545
Talking about literature on
public television once a week,

239
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:05,716
and writing the occasional review

240
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:08,798
for the New Yorker, doesn't
make me much of a celebrity.

241
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:14,007
Don't forget your history books
"The Origins of American Hedonism."

242
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,738
Look, if you don't like the
idea of being stared at,

243
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:20,126
We can go to my place.

244
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,120
Then the only person
staring would be me.

245
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:36,053
If I go to your place will you
do something for me?

246
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:34,084
That was awful.

247
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:38,467
It was OK.
That was amazing.

248
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,506
I wish I could play.

249
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,241
Take lessons.

250
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,976
You'd enjoy playing if

251
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:48,188
you knew you wouldn't have such
a high opinion of my playing.

252
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,663
Now you're fishing for compliments.

253
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:52,876
Is this a metronome?

254
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,698
It's like a heart beat.

255
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,564
Even...

256
00:16:57,998 --> 00:17:02,078
great pianists have a problem
with their core acceleration.

257
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:11,540
You're a very charming man.

258
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:15,880
You know, don't you?

259
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:21,913
If this is all for showing you a metronome,
I swear I didn't invent it.

260
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:57,937
Can you find anyone that
enchanting without sex?

261
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:00,889
Nobody.

262
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,966
What is this?

263
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:09,527
My dark room.

264
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,386
I used to develop my own pictures.

265
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,469
- You don't anymore?
- No, no time.

266
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:23,371
I should go digital, but I can't
really understand that stuff.

267
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:26,974
Of course you can.

268
00:18:28,536 --> 00:18:29,664
Thank you.

269
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:41,730
Something relates little princess
because she's...

270
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:44,204
the center of the picture,

271
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:48,501
Not her parents,
The queen and the king.

272
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:51,366
They are just...

273
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:54,490
ghostly reflections in the mirror.

274
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:24,204
Well she must have been curious
about going to bed with you.

275
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:26,634
Yes, so she could tell
her girlfriends

276
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:29,847
what a man of our age,

277
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:31,713
is like, close up.

278
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:35,011
I'm merely an experience for her.
One of many to come.

279
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:37,311
She'll remember me as...

280
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:40,958
the old guy who gave her
some culture on the way.

281
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:43,302
Well, that sounds about right.

282
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:46,036
You should chalk it up to
the same thing, right?

283
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:48,857
Yeah.

284
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,544
Gotta stop worrying about growing old.

285
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:56,626
Worry about growing up.

286
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:03,701
Oh, thank your lucky stars for
such a one-shot encounter.

287
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,260
It wasn't a one-shot encounter.

288
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:11,513
She came back for more?

289
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,909
You have the most beautiful
breasts I've ever seen.

290
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:04,117
You like them?

291
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,807
I worship them.

292
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:19,134
And you have a beautiful face,

293
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:24,256
I can't stop looking at.

294
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,773
You know something?

295
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:32,763
You're a work of art.

296
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:39,099
A work of art.

297
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:47,520
A real work of art.

298
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,484
Let's talk about you.

299
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:12,867
Have you had many women?

300
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:15,340
Why?

301
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,986
More than 50 or less?

302
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:22,068
More.

303
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:25,410
Who's counting?

304
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,012
How about you?

305
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:32,528
Not many.

306
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:34,221
How many?

307
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,668
Five.

308
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:55,098
Five boyfriends.

309
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:57,528
Five.

310
00:23:58,092 --> 00:23:59,437
Five.

311
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,386
I see.

312
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,030
So, who were they?

313
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:11,808
They were young, right?
Younger than me?

314
00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:15,800
Of course they were younger.
They were boys.

315
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:17,926
Boys?

316
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:20,141
Sure.

317
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:30,731
You want to know the most
extreme thing I ever did?

318
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,074
Hmm well...

319
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:37,155
Once I went to bed
with two guys together.

320
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:40,496
Two together?

321
00:24:41,017 --> 00:24:44,447
They were my childhood
friends and...

322
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,354
that's how we ended up one night.

323
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,608
The three of us were drunk and
we ended up in bed together.

324
00:24:52,953 --> 00:24:54,603
All three of you?

325
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:57,857
Well, when you're 17,

326
00:24:58,204 --> 00:25:02,936
You do a lot of things just to feel
secure and emotional.

327
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,191
Right.

328
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:58,751
Consuela.

329
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:02,398
My whole life was
dedicated to independence

330
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:05,131
and at some cost I had achieved my goal.

331
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,952
Nevertheless, it was in that moment,

332
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,553
That my terrible jealousy was born.

333
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:15,288
That is when I realised that
I would never, ever,

334
00:26:15,765 --> 00:26:19,108
really possess her.

335
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:21,928
I feel anxious unless I speak
to her on the phone every day,

336
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:24,879
and then I feel anxious
after we've spoken.

337
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,439
What are you wearing?

338
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,303
Where are you?

339
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:39,202
I knew it's only a matter of time

340
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:41,937
before a young man found
her and took her away.

341
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:47,232
I knew.

342
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:51,269
Because I was once that young
man who would have done it.

343
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,131
Well, at least does
it makes you feel young?

344
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:22,301
It's like playing soccer
with a bunch of 20 year olds.

345
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:26,035
It doesn't make you feel 20 because
you're playing with huge difference,

346
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:28,074
every second of the game.

347
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:30,331
You have to leave her.

348
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:33,152
Your hands will always be
tied by this girl.

349
00:27:33,543 --> 00:27:35,887
She's going to leave you
sooner or later, anyway.

350
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,011
So it's always better to
keep one step ahead.

351
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:42,527
Take her to a nice romantic spot

352
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:45,088
tell her it's over.

353
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:46,998
That's what I'd do.

354
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:56,155
My parents talk about all these
places they wanted to go to.

355
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,627
They have all the money to go
wherever they want, but...

356
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:03,925
leaving Cuba was their first
and last trip.

357
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,004
I don't want my life to be like that.

358
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,306
Let me take you places.

359
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:13,169
<i>What the hell are you saying?
You brought her here to say goodbye.</i>

360
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:15,165
- Where would we go?
- Europe.

361
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:19,722
We could go to Paris this summer,
or Rome, or Madrid.

362
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:23,889
We can visit the Prado and see the
real Velasquez, the real Goya.

363
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:26,321
<i>The Prado?</i>

364
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:28,446
Do you mean it?

365
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:31,224
Of course I meant it.

366
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,306
And we can finish our trip in Venice,
you'll love Venice.

367
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,076
- And you would ride a gondola with me.
- Maybe.

368
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:44,722
Maybe.

369
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:49,238
"Maybe" may be your favorite word.

370
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:53,403
I'll sing to you in the gondola.

371
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,178
We'll see.

372
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:11,502
What's this from:

373
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:14,628
"They're making a beast with two backs".
What's that from?

374
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,842
William Shakespeare!

375
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,576
"Othello, The Moor of Venice".

376
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:23,482
And we're making a monster
with four legs.

377
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:26,477
Where shall we have dinner?

378
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:28,603
I can't, I'm going out tonight.

379
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:31,034
- You are? With whom?
- With my brother.

380
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,072
We're going to go dancing
to that place "Kalimas".

381
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,285
Your brother...?

382
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:40,582
You never mentioned a brother.

383
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,707
Well, there is a lot of things
you don't know about me yet.

384
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,430
Thank you.

385
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:02,414
Here we are.

386
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,233
I really had a great
time with you today.

387
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,532
Me too.

388
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:17,951
Thank you.

389
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:28,976
Bye.

390
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:31,407
Bye.

391
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,604
Are you really going out with
your brother tonight?

392
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:45,469
David!

393
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:47,379
That was a joke.

394
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:49,462
Bye.

395
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:12,422
On the nights she isn't
with me I am deformed,

396
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,808
thinking of where she might be.

397
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,712
And all this because this girl
will tell me a thousand times

398
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:24,228
how much she adores me and means it.

399
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,610
This girl will never once tell
me she yearns for my cock.

400
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:51,596
How are you?

401
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:54,159
What are you doing here?

402
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,240
I was on my way to see a friend,

403
00:32:57,804 --> 00:33:00,494
who lives near here.
How's things?

404
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,404
What's the matter?

405
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:06,007
- Did you came here to check on me?
- I told you.

406
00:33:06,397 --> 00:33:08,785
I was down in the neighborhood
and I saw this place.

407
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:12,735
Do you want to ruin everything?

408
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:16,727
No.

409
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:20,894
So then you're going to have
to start trusting me.

410
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:24,930
I'll call you tomorrow.

411
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,404
No, I'll call you.

412
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:55,833
I never behaved like such an
idiot even when I was her age.

413
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,481
Good thing is, at least now,

414
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:02,734
it's finished, she won't want to
see me anymore. I understand her.

415
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:05,729
I mean, even I wouldn't want to
see me anymore if I was her.

416
00:34:07,986 --> 00:34:09,679
Maybe it's just as well.

417
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:12,978
- Yes.
- Just as well.

418
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:16,796
Oh, my God.

419
00:34:33,853 --> 00:34:34,678
Hello?

420
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,849
David, it's Consuela.

421
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:44,488
During the last two days

422
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:46,658
I've been thinking a bit about us.

423
00:34:47,048 --> 00:34:48,437
Have you?

424
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,564
Yes.

425
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:54,992
And what were you thinking?

426
00:34:58,289 --> 00:34:59,982
That it's all over.

427
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,804
What do you really want from me?

428
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:04,799
What do I really want from you?

429
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,531
You spend you whole life

430
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:14,087
going through relationships without

431
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:16,519
ever really bonding with anyone.

432
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:20,425
So, at least I would like to know,

433
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:22,637
who I am for you.

434
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:32,708
The fact that you're jealous and
possessive doesn't help me, at all.

435
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:38,436
Even little kids are jealous of their
toys until they get tired of them.

436
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,173
and want new ones. So...

437
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:44,340
is that how it's going
to be between us two?

438
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:53,150
Have you ever imagined...

439
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,270
a future with me?

440
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:04,695
A future with you scares me.

441
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,905
- It scares you?
- Yes.

442
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,377
Why?

443
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:26,528
Because, there's a 30 odd
year age difference

444
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:30,303
between you and me,

445
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:33,428
and you have your whole
life ahead of you.

446
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:36,986
It's just a matter of time
before you realise it too.

447
00:36:37,377 --> 00:36:42,064
I didn't ask you what I was going to do,
I asked what you wanted to do with me.

448
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,125
When you make love to a woman you
get revenge for all the things

449
00:36:58,471 --> 00:37:00,945
that defeated you in life.

450
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:50,164
I spent my whole life jumping
from one relationship to another,

451
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:56,501
because this made me believe that I was
never alone, and that time was not passing.

452
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,881
I've always surmised,
for example,

453
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,178
that D.H. Lawrence, when he was writing

454
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:09,695
"Lady Chatterley's Lover"...

455
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:12,516
"Who am I for you?",
she asked me one day.

456
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,728
I was to afraid to ask
who I was for her.

457
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:22,585
How long could it have lasted?

458
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:34,695
Surprise.

459
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:44,981
Yes. Let me... wow!

460
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,882
Thank God for Carolyn.

461
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:32,377
Carolyn is my only point of contact
with the self-confident man I used to be.

462
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:45,137
How was that play?

463
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:47,611
Which play?

464
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:51,386
The one you took George to.

465
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:54,469
Oh, unremarkable, just...

466
00:40:00,285 --> 00:40:01,804
Here I go.

467
00:40:02,282 --> 00:40:03,887
Oh, hit and run.

468
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:05,667
Just the way you like it.

469
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:08,574
Good thing I don't have pets.

470
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:10,571
Only you.

471
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,974
Which one was Carlos Alonzo?

472
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,444
- From high school.
- What was his thing?

473
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,918
What did he want you to do?

474
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:44,034
He liked...

475
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,725
to watch me menstruate.

476
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,805
What?

477
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:53,930
- He liked to watch me menstruate.
- I don't believe this.

478
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:57,794
The respectable Cuban-American girl
whose parents worship Ronald Reagan,

479
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:01,873
who enforce an 8 o'clock curfew on their
daughter, in summer time, no less,

480
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,825
there she is in high school,
aged 15...

481
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:06,171
16.

482
00:41:06,777 --> 00:41:09,555
I'm so sorry.
That makes all the difference.

483
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:14,460
- I think you're being ridiculous.
- How did you manage it?

484
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:15,979
David...

485
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,105
I'm really curious.
What do you do?

486
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:21,231
You find yourself having your period,
pick up a phone, you ask him to come over?

487
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,271
"Hey Carlos, I'm starting."

488
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,265
And then he appears,
all Cuban and "respectable",

489
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:28,957
And the pair of you retire to the
bathroom where you have the ceremony

490
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:30,866
of the pulling down of the tampon.

491
00:41:32,211 --> 00:41:34,771
Yeah, it's just like you were there.

492
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,548
Just filling in...

493
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:42,454
the missing...
just filling in the blanks.

494
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:44,712
Which blanks?

495
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:47,316
Five. Now we're down to 3.

496
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,570
Because of the two guys who...

497
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,654
I have to go, sorry.

498
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:00,120
What is this?

499
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,376
- What?
- This.

500
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:07,715
You're fucking other women.

501
00:42:08,714 --> 00:42:11,318
I had two husbands who
fucked other women.

502
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:15,267
I didn't like it then, I don't
like it now, least of all with you.

503
00:42:15,571 --> 00:42:19,391
You have everything with me David.
Pure fucking.

504
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,688
No hidden agendas,
No icky entanglements.

505
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:26,161
How could you do this?
There aren't many like me.

506
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:30,110
I actually understand you.

507
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,541
I am one in a million.

508
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,755
How could you possibly fuck...?

509
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:36,230
I don't know whose that is.

510
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:38,402
Why don't you put it
on a bagel and eat it.

511
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,050
I have a pretty good idea.

512
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,131
I'm sure you do.

513
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:45,605
You know my friend
George O'Hearn, the poet?

514
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:48,079
George uses tampons?
Since when?

515
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:51,031
No, listen. George...

516
00:42:51,508 --> 00:42:54,894
has the keys to this apartment.
He gives poetry readings, he meets girls.

517
00:42:55,285 --> 00:42:58,365
He can't bring them home,
to his wife in New Rochelle.

518
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,448
And since he's always short on funds...

519
00:43:00,796 --> 00:43:03,574
- And since some of them are married...
- George fucks all these women in your bed?

520
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:06,352
Not all, some.
He uses the bed in the guest room.

521
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:08,825
His marriage isn't paradise.

522
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:10,866
Probably a bit like mine and he
wasn't desperate enough to get out.

523
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:13,426
I don't believe a fucking
word you're saying.

524
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,334
Everything in your life
is so meticulous.

525
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:20,111
- It's so orderly...
- I don't know whose tampon this is.

526
00:43:22,107 --> 00:43:23,625
You have to believe me.

527
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,531
You're all I'm holding on to.

528
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,916
<i>In this at least I was
telling the truth.</i>

529
00:43:56,785 --> 00:43:58,739
<i>Of course the whole situation
was ridiculous.</i>

530
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:29,079
Do I snore?

531
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,766
- Yes?
- It's worse.

532
00:44:34,286 --> 00:44:35,631
What?

533
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:38,192
Well...

534
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,145
You drool.

535
00:44:40,796 --> 00:44:41,750
Yes.

536
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:43,791
- You drool on...
- Not true!

537
00:44:44,008 --> 00:44:45,180
You drool in your sleep.

538
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,695
Beautiful women are invisible.

539
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:51,343
Invisible?
What the hell does that mean?

540
00:45:02,758 --> 00:45:04,059
Invisible.

541
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:07,922
They jump out at you. A beautiful
woman stands out... stands apart

542
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:12,740
- You can't miss her.
- But we never actually see the person.

543
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,171
We see the beautiful shell.

544
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:18,339
We're blocked by the beauty barrier.

545
00:45:21,377 --> 00:45:23,417
Look at you.

546
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:36,135
What?

547
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:38,738
What did you say?

548
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:45,205
- You're deaf, Mr Kepesh.
- No. What?

549
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:48,331
Or maybe you do not want to hear.

550
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:51,282
Maybe that's the problem with you.

551
00:46:05,084 --> 00:46:10,249
Yes. We're so dazzled by the outside,
we never make it inside.

552
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,359
Do you always work in black and white?

553
00:46:22,922 --> 00:46:26,612
Mainly.
I like the theatricality.

554
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:29,302
Is that how you see the world?

555
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:31,516
In black and white?

556
00:46:31,864 --> 00:46:33,296
No.

557
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:37,375
That distinction belongs to my son.

558
00:46:39,198 --> 00:46:41,932
You always speak of him
with such bitterness.

559
00:46:43,323 --> 00:46:46,577
In my family,
that would be so strange.

560
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,007
Take a look.

561
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:57,210
Beautiful picture.

562
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:00,206
Beautiful woman.

563
00:47:01,724 --> 00:47:04,025
Look, my hands are huge.

564
00:47:05,717 --> 00:47:07,628
I want you so much.

565
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:14,832
David...

566
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:18,174
Your fridge is empty.

567
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,863
If we are staying in,

568
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,333
we have to go shopping.

569
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:32,758
Excuse me, Professor,
but your Spanish is awful.

570
00:47:33,322 --> 00:47:35,621
- Then teach me.
- Yeah, I'll teach you.

571
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:38,225
I'll teach you "maana".

572
00:47:43,173 --> 00:47:46,038
- Isn't that your poet friend?
- Keep walking.

573
00:47:51,421 --> 00:47:54,285
- That woman is not his wife?
- That's right.

574
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:58,582
- I find that disgusting.
- It isn't our business.

575
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:01,663
- And that's the end of it?
- Let's not discuss it here.

576
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:05,135
- Are you OK with that?
- With what?

577
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:10,257
For all you know he's just having
a cup of coffee with a friend.

578
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:12,167
You know,
you're jumping to conclusions.

579
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:16,463
David, being younger than you
doesn't make me a child.

580
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,415
In any event, it's not our business.

581
00:48:19,806 --> 00:48:22,106
You keep saying that,
but what do you think about it?

582
00:48:24,406 --> 00:48:26,403
What I think is...

583
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:28,921
that marriage...

584
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:32,088
is a problematic institution at best.

585
00:48:32,697 --> 00:48:34,606
Which is why you married your wife.

586
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,863
Which is why I don't cheat on her.

587
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:42,072
- But you were married once.
- Yes, yes! Yes! Yes!

588
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:44,502
What do you want me to say?

589
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,671
I was married.

590
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:48,885
It was a mistake.

591
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,098
Did you try?

592
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:54,918
Did you really try?
Where I come from...

593
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:59,910
I know, where you come from the
rules are different, but they're not.

594
00:49:05,205 --> 00:49:07,289
You're such a cynic.

595
00:49:07,722 --> 00:49:09,936
I'm such a realist.

596
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,757
I think you're just infantile.

597
00:49:13,277 --> 00:49:15,492
I'm sure you're right.

598
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:28,425
I hung in there for over a year.
It was a real roller coaster ride.

599
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:31,464
And like all rides,
sooner or later, it has to end.

600
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:42,660
What are you doing a
week from Sunday?

601
00:49:43,616 --> 00:49:44,918
I don't know. Why?

602
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:46,264
Something to drink?

603
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:50,170
- Yeah, two Bellinis, please.
- Okay.

604
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,078
What's a week from Sunday?

605
00:49:53,556 --> 00:49:55,422
My parents are throwing
me a graduation party,

606
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,069
to celebrate my MFA.

607
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,020
I'd like you to come.

608
00:50:04,145 --> 00:50:05,101
David...

609
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:06,923
Everyone knows about you.

610
00:50:07,443 --> 00:50:09,484
For a whole year and half

611
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:11,567
they've been asking me about
this mystery man I'm seeing.

612
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,169
They're going to start thinking
I'm with some drug dealer,

613
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:16,863
if you don't stop hiding.

614
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,729
I'm not hiding.

615
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:23,156
- You didn't come to my birthday.
- Well you didn't ask me.

616
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:27,931
I asked you to Christmas dinner
with my parents. You had plans.

617
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:30,751
Then I invited you to Thanksgiving
dinner, you couldn't come.

618
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,007
Whoa, Thanksgiving I really couldn't.

619
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:49,978
David...

620
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:51,411
Huh?

621
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,972
I want you to meet my family.

622
00:50:54,405 --> 00:50:56,228
But I'm not going to insist.

623
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,961
I just want you to say yes
because you want to come.

624
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:04,259
- Here we go.
- Thanks.

625
00:51:04,823 --> 00:51:06,342
Enjoy.

626
00:51:09,162 --> 00:51:10,378
Listen to me.

627
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:14,110
Listen to me.

628
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,447
When I come to your party,

629
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:24,571
you have to promise to do something.

630
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,341
What?

631
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:34,596
Don't take your eyes of me,

632
00:51:35,074 --> 00:51:37,375
When the Cubanates come,

633
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:40,499
Stampeding towards me.

634
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,491
That's all?

635
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:47,270
That's all.

636
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,482
Okay.

637
00:51:51,263 --> 00:51:52,566
So...

638
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,341
- That means yes?
- That means yes.

639
00:51:57,946 --> 00:51:59,032
Okay.

640
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:17,696
I'm happy.

641
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,561
Good.

642
00:52:21,081 --> 00:52:23,076
And now the food.

643
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:29,327
Her parents will be there, I hope,

644
00:52:29,718 --> 00:52:31,498
grandparents will be there,

645
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,009
Cuban relatives, all her childhood
friends... and who knows,

646
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:41,394
Carlos Alonso and the two guys who
made her the meat of their sandwich.

647
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:43,433
And I'll be introduced as...

648
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,994
"The Teacher Who's on Television."

649
00:52:47,296 --> 00:52:48,555
What's wrong with that?

650
00:52:48,946 --> 00:52:51,680
What's wrong is I'll be
judged for my age.

651
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:54,024
They'll say all the horrible
things they say in these cases.

652
00:52:54,327 --> 00:52:56,628
She's with me because she
wants something in return,

653
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:59,883
and I'm with her
because I like new girls.

654
00:53:00,274 --> 00:53:01,402
Pathetic.

655
00:53:01,836 --> 00:53:04,613
It's about time to face your situation.
That's what I think.

656
00:53:09,735 --> 00:53:11,733
Who is Carlos Alonso?

657
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:14,943
Some guy.

658
00:53:21,844 --> 00:53:23,537
- Hello?
- Hi.

659
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:26,097
- Did I wake you up?
- No, I was reading.

660
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:31,784
I just wanted to say goodnight...

661
00:53:32,738 --> 00:53:34,910
and tell you how happy I am that
you're going to come tomorrow

662
00:53:35,387 --> 00:53:39,336
and how important it is for me.

663
00:53:40,203 --> 00:53:41,852
And for me too.

664
00:53:43,155 --> 00:53:44,415
Okay.

665
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:46,237
See you then.

666
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,232
See you then.

667
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:50,534
- Good night.
- Good night.

668
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:58,415
- Consuela...
- David, where are you?

669
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:01,149
You won't believe what
just happened, my...

670
00:55:01,628 --> 00:55:04,492
I'm stuck on the
George Washington bridge.

671
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:08,138
My car's broken down.

672
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:12,174
Consuela?

673
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:17,860
I called AAA.

674
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:20,724
They say they're going to
be at least an hour.

675
00:55:21,158 --> 00:55:24,804
And then they're going to have to get
me off the bridge and tow me some place.

676
00:55:25,152 --> 00:55:28,320
I'll call you right after, Okay?

677
00:55:28,971 --> 00:55:30,706
Consuela?

678
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:35,048
Why are you doing this to me?

679
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,344
Consuela?

680
00:55:41,732 --> 00:55:43,034
Hello?

681
00:56:41,237 --> 00:56:43,405
One new message.

682
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:46,141
First new message...

683
00:56:47,096 --> 00:56:49,830
I saw you today on television,

684
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:52,217
playing the wise old man

685
00:56:52,695 --> 00:56:53,953
who knows everything.

686
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,557
The one who always knows better.

687
00:56:57,165 --> 00:56:59,942
The one who knows what's good culture,
and what people should read,

688
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,888
and all about music
all about art...

689
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:10,533
You know so many things.

690
00:57:13,398 --> 00:57:15,915
But I'm here,
trying to celebrate

691
00:57:16,654 --> 00:57:20,950
this important moment
of my life.

692
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:24,553
And I decide to have a party
and I want to have you here.

693
00:57:26,895 --> 00:57:27,937
Why?

694
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:31,018
Why, Consuela, why?

695
00:57:33,796 --> 00:57:37,703
Because you mean
everything to me.

696
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,436
You do.

697
00:57:42,173 --> 00:57:45,429
But, anyway, you are not here.

698
00:57:46,947 --> 00:57:50,464
I just wanted you to know something...

699
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:54,976
that I loved you.

700
00:57:56,149 --> 00:57:58,450
Very much.

701
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:02,572
Very, very much.

702
00:58:34,733 --> 00:58:35,992
Consuela?

703
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:38,597
It's me. Open up.

704
00:58:39,117 --> 00:58:41,808
- Kenny.
- Come on, open up.

705
00:59:10,888 --> 00:59:12,364
Hello.

706
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,402
Why are all the lights off?

707
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:37,147
I'm having an affair.

708
00:59:40,879 --> 00:59:42,963
Did you hear what I just said?

709
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:44,959
You!

710
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,256
- Is that all that you have to say?
- Congratulations.

711
00:59:49,603 --> 00:59:50,601
Congratulations...

712
00:59:51,035 --> 00:59:52,163
You're a riot, you know that?

713
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:55,247
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what to say.

714
00:59:57,632 --> 00:59:58,892
This is awful.

715
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:01,756
I'm coming apart.

716
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:04,838
I thought you were happily married,
you always told me you were happily married.

717
01:00:05,142 --> 01:00:06,747
- I am.
- Well...

718
01:00:07,181 --> 01:00:10,263
Forgive me, but I can't see how
that can be entirely true.

719
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:13,302
Anyway, you don't look
terribly happy right now.

720
01:00:13,866 --> 01:00:16,122
- But you don't understand.
- Kenny...

721
01:00:16,556 --> 01:00:18,814
I'm trying to understand.
You're having an affair.

722
01:00:19,335 --> 01:00:22,762
So you come here, because,
what, I'm the expert.

723
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,888
There's no-one else to talk to.

724
01:00:26,279 --> 01:00:27,885
I'm sorry.

725
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,098
What you going to do?

726
01:00:31,746 --> 01:00:33,092
I don't know.

727
01:00:36,783 --> 01:00:38,345
Would you like something to drink?

728
01:00:41,773 --> 01:00:43,119
What will you have?

729
01:00:43,596 --> 01:00:47,286
Glenfiddich, bourbon, vodka,
Cointreau, Grand Marnier,

730
01:00:47,675 --> 01:00:49,151
Armagnac...

731
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,799
No. Diet coke.

732
01:00:52,103 --> 01:00:53,579
Diet coke it is.

733
01:00:55,315 --> 01:00:58,830
This isn't some kind of irresponsible fling.

734
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:03,084
I love Lisa, I really do,
and the kids are my whole life.

735
01:01:04,558 --> 01:01:06,122
Knowing you,

736
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,247
it's probably simplest if you
just break off the other...

737
01:01:09,898 --> 01:01:11,200
Oh, I can't.

738
01:01:11,808 --> 01:01:14,455
This woman is...

739
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:16,973
like no-one else on earth.

740
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,184
I've never felt so alive,
so full of energy.

741
01:01:20,575 --> 01:01:22,355
And she's a great person.

742
01:01:22,832 --> 01:01:25,176
She has degrees in
chemistry and art history.

743
01:01:25,176 --> 01:01:27,606
She plays the oboe, for chrissakes.

744
01:01:27,997 --> 01:01:29,474
And her kids are...

745
01:01:29,863 --> 01:01:32,207
- fabulous
- She has children?

746
01:01:32,554 --> 01:01:35,288
Three. Scott, little Shawn...

747
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:39,412
Hold on Kenny! What are we talking
about here? Her children or your adultery?

748
01:01:39,673 --> 01:01:41,538
- Don't call it that.
- Well, what would you call it?

749
01:01:41,886 --> 01:01:45,880
See, you sound like Lisa. You try to
over-simplify a complicated situation.

750
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:47,918
I...

751
01:01:48,396 --> 01:01:49,785
I'm committed to this relationship,

752
01:01:50,176 --> 01:01:52,694
unlike you, who's terrified
of committing to anyone.

753
01:01:53,128 --> 01:01:55,514
Dana is a real person

754
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:57,988
so don't equate what's happening
to me with your serial tom-catting.

755
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:00,507
- What have I got to do with it?
- Plenty!

756
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,372
Anyway,

757
01:02:02,807 --> 01:02:07,103
Dana isn't one of your little
star-struck students.

758
01:02:10,012 --> 01:02:12,094
If you want my advice,

759
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:14,741
Lisa mustn't know a word of this,

760
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:17,954
- until you've made up your mind...
- Lisa already knows.

761
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:20,168
Why on earth did you tell Lisa?

762
01:02:20,644 --> 01:02:23,683
- You expect me to lie to my wife?
- Now you can't retreat even if you want to.

763
01:02:25,723 --> 01:02:26,851
God!

764
01:02:27,546 --> 01:02:30,410
I don't know why I came here. I don't
know what help you could possibly be.

765
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:32,407
Except maybe, maybe...

766
01:02:34,447 --> 01:02:36,530
I hoped that you might relate to me,

767
01:02:37,527 --> 01:02:39,047
as a father...

768
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,912
- for just once.
- I don't know how to relate to you.

769
01:02:42,303 --> 01:02:44,212
You're so morally superior
to me in every way.

770
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:46,121
Even our adulteries can't compare.

771
01:02:46,511 --> 01:02:48,509
Yours plays the oboe, what have I
got to put up against that

772
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:51,330
She probably writes poetry in her
spare time, and her kids do too.

773
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:52,936
You're such a jerk.

774
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,281
However, if you are,
as you say, committed...

775
01:02:54,628 --> 01:02:56,235
You're going to have to end your marriage.

776
01:02:56,582 --> 01:02:59,403
How can I? If I walk out on
Lisa and the kids...

777
01:02:59,751 --> 01:03:02,745
If I do what you did,
then I'll destroy them.

778
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:06,434
Why do you say that? You survived.
Your mother survived.

779
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:08,952
Are you trying to tell me

780
01:03:09,473 --> 01:03:14,246
that you did the morally correct
thing by walking out on us?

781
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,374
It was honest.

782
01:03:16,634 --> 01:03:17,892
God!

783
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,267
- I'm leaving.
- There's the door.

784
01:03:28,569 --> 01:03:31,608
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

785
01:03:48,709 --> 01:03:51,139
<i>Consuela didn't call the next day.</i>

786
01:03:54,524 --> 01:03:56,954
<i>and not even the day after.</i>

787
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,990
<i>She never called again.</i>

788
01:04:25,688 --> 01:04:26,903
You've gotta eat something.

789
01:04:28,682 --> 01:04:31,027
You gotta get out of this fucking bed.

790
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:34,889
- I ruined everything, George.
- You didn't ruin anything.

791
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,666
It just came to its natural end.

792
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:39,230
You were her teacher,

793
01:04:39,577 --> 01:04:41,574
her big growing-up experience.

794
01:04:42,094 --> 01:04:44,828
You called the whole thing from day one.

795
01:04:45,695 --> 01:04:47,780
It was bound to end
sooner or later. Eat.

796
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,126
I miss her.

797
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:51,903
Well, that's easy for you to say
now that she's out of the picture.

798
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,028
I was in love with her, George.
I never felt anything like that in all my life.

799
01:04:55,636 --> 01:04:58,804
Well, it's better late than never.
Now you gotta get back with your own life.

800
01:04:59,194 --> 01:05:00,886
You're gonna be feeling better soon.

801
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:02,884
Time heals all wounds.

802
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:05,271
Now,

803
01:05:05,705 --> 01:05:06,920
open wide cause here comes.

804
01:05:07,355 --> 01:05:09,307
The train entering the station.

805
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:13,300
Open wide. There you go...

806
01:05:14,168 --> 01:05:18,248
How does that taste like?
I added a little oregano and some chives.

807
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:21,329
You're going to make somebody
very happy one day.

808
01:05:24,498 --> 01:05:25,887
You know,

809
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:29,142
after a long time of
silence and betrayal,

810
01:05:30,704 --> 01:05:32,701
lately Amy and I...

811
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:36,781
- have been finding each other again.
- You and Amy?

812
01:05:37,172 --> 01:05:40,513
- Your wife? Are you feeling OK?
- Yes, I feel OK.

813
01:05:40,948 --> 01:05:44,420
That's the most incredible thing I've heard
you say in all the years I've known you.

814
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:47,675
Life always keeps back more surprises

815
01:05:48,847 --> 01:05:51,495
than we can ever imagine.

816
01:05:52,146 --> 01:05:52,970
Yeah.

817
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:54,402
Dave...

818
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,095
I need a favor.

819
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:57,571
I gotta go give a poetry reading

820
01:05:58,049 --> 01:05:59,655
at NYU next month,

821
01:06:00,045 --> 01:06:01,390
and they want somebody to introduce me.

822
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,690
George, I understand you
wanting to distract me,

823
01:06:04,037 --> 01:06:07,467
but this is transparent
occupational therapy.

824
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:10,635
This is no joke.
I want you to present me in the

825
01:06:11,242 --> 01:06:15,670
most embarrassing, flattering terms
all those portly pandering profs.

826
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,447
Present you?
Who's going to present me?

827
01:06:19,922 --> 01:06:23,743
Forrest Lawn?
George, you're a champ for asking, but...

828
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:26,997
I can't write anything now.
I'm finished.

829
01:06:27,388 --> 01:06:29,559
I may never teach another class.
Find somebody else.

830
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,944
I spent half of life
playing Horatio,

831
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:36,025
to your third rate Hamlet.

832
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:40,193
Listening to your endless naval gazing,
your moaning about Kenny, the father-hater,

833
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,185
the women who don't know
when goodbye means goodbye.

834
01:06:44,705 --> 01:06:47,441
And for this you owe me big-time.

835
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:50,912
Now I expect you to do this
in the name of our friendship.

836
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,777
Now would you fuckin' eat something?

837
01:07:06,537 --> 01:07:09,359
The Poetry of George O'Hearn

838
01:07:10,704 --> 01:07:13,569
makes no apology for itself.

839
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:25,938
As A.E. Housman wrote

840
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:28,369
in his celebrated essay,

841
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:30,626
"I don't know what poetry is,

842
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,838
but I recognize
it when I hear it. "

843
01:07:34,272 --> 01:07:38,352
There can be no question that
this evening's guest writes what

844
01:07:38,742 --> 01:07:41,781
we all instantly recognise as poetry.

845
01:07:42,302 --> 01:07:45,730
Since the publication 25 years ago
of his first work in the New Yorker,

846
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:49,896
George O'Hearn's vigorously
masculine voice

847
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:53,109
has become a fixture

848
01:07:53,456 --> 01:07:55,583
of the American poetic landscape.

849
01:07:56,016 --> 01:07:59,055
Poetry which is one and the same time,
the language of the street,

850
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:01,182
potent,

851
01:08:01,485 --> 01:08:04,133
urban and impatient.

852
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,083
But also the un-selfcentered promptings

853
01:08:08,473 --> 01:08:10,860
of an unquiet heart.

854
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:14,203
In 1988, that
unique combination

855
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,414
of sensibilities
earned George O'Hearn,

856
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:20,279
The Pulitzer Prize.

857
01:08:21,538 --> 01:08:24,445
But rather than procrastinate further,

858
01:08:24,836 --> 01:08:27,483
or damn him with praise

859
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:29,568
he will inevitably consider feint,

860
01:08:30,089 --> 01:08:33,950
I turn the proceedings
over to New York's own,

861
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:35,469
or, should I say,

862
01:08:35,948 --> 01:08:39,029
America's own,
George O'Hearn.

863
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:51,614
George!

864
01:08:55,739 --> 01:08:57,301
I'll call an ambulance.

865
01:09:20,044 --> 01:09:21,781
Hi, David.

866
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:32,718
He just woke up a little while ago.

867
01:09:55,418 --> 01:09:56,806
Hi, David.

868
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:02,187
George...

869
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,913
It's Kepesh.

870
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:17,161
I'm here, George. I'm here.

871
01:10:58,525 --> 01:10:59,827
George...

872
01:11:04,817 --> 01:11:06,598
I owe you.

873
01:11:53,734 --> 01:11:57,291
I wonder who he thought I was.

874
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,460
I think he knew perfectly well.

875
01:12:04,713 --> 01:12:06,363
You're sweet.

876
01:12:10,834 --> 01:12:12,830
I took him as he was.

877
01:12:13,177 --> 01:12:15,217
He so appreciated that.

878
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:18,213
He took me the same.

879
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:31,884
- You're going where?
- I just told you. Florida.

880
01:12:32,621 --> 01:12:34,011
To meet her parents,
just for the week-end.

881
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:37,482
- The girl's...
- Her name is Dana.

882
01:12:38,264 --> 01:12:39,913
You're going to meet her folks?

883
01:12:40,434 --> 01:12:42,604
Well I think they should know
I'm not just some kind of pervert.

884
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:46,509
Kenny, you're nearly 40 years old.
You don't need

885
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:50,504
the approval of the parents of a
girl who has three children of her own.

886
01:12:51,068 --> 01:12:52,760
Does she want her parents' approval?

887
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,452
If you want my approval,
fine, you've got it.

888
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:57,015
I just wanted you to understand.
This doesn't mean that

889
01:12:57,578 --> 01:13:00,660
I don't love Lisa.

890
01:13:01,007 --> 01:13:02,916
Kenny, what are you doing?

891
01:13:03,394 --> 01:13:05,218
You're going to escape from one prison

892
01:13:05,564 --> 01:13:09,514
and race headlong into another
maximum security facility.

893
01:13:09,905 --> 01:13:12,726
Where did you get the idea
that marriage is a prison?

894
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,937
From serving time.
It wasn't about your mom.

895
01:13:16,241 --> 01:13:19,322
- I just wasn't cut out for it.
- Is this your version of approval?

896
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:23,186
Kenny, listen to me.

897
01:13:23,707 --> 01:13:25,182
I'm the only father you have.

898
01:13:25,746 --> 01:13:27,308
I'm the only one you'll ever have.

899
01:13:28,525 --> 01:13:29,957
What a comfort that is.

900
01:13:30,825 --> 01:13:32,952
I know I disappointed you.

901
01:13:33,385 --> 01:13:36,248
But you're not a child,
you've got to get past this rage.

902
01:13:37,248 --> 01:13:41,111
If you ever want there to be anything
between us you've gotta turn the page.

903
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,364
Now excuse me,
I have an appointment.

904
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:47,187
I'm not finished.

905
01:13:48,272 --> 01:13:49,618
I really have to run.

906
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:51,701
- What appointment?
- George's funeral.

907
01:13:52,005 --> 01:13:53,003
George who?

908
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,783
- Your friend George?
- Yeah.

909
01:13:55,043 --> 01:13:57,300
- He died?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

910
01:13:57,647 --> 01:13:59,470
We'll finish this later, OK?

911
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:01,033
I'm sorry.

912
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,342
Hello?

913
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,378
I happened to be in town,
I saw the obit in The Times and I...

914
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,852
In two columns.

915
01:14:30,589 --> 01:14:32,327
Not bad for a poet, I guess.

916
01:14:34,452 --> 01:14:36,188
How are you holding up?

917
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:39,444
Not so good, but I'll be OK.

918
01:14:40,052 --> 01:14:41,614
How's everything?

919
01:14:42,786 --> 01:14:47,212
Seattle is a great place to
build a business. I'm exhausted.

920
01:14:48,733 --> 01:14:50,208
But I love it.

921
01:14:55,285 --> 01:14:57,500
What're you thinking about, Dave?

922
01:14:57,804 --> 01:14:59,150
Nothing.

923
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:03,055
We kept acting like teenagers
all our life, that's all.

924
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:09,782
- Who's we? Me and you?
- Yes, you and I.

925
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:13,949
We spent our life

926
01:15:15,035 --> 01:15:17,941
chasing after what?

927
01:15:19,462 --> 01:15:22,803
The only time you got pregnant you had
an abortion because the time wasn't right.

928
01:15:22,803 --> 01:15:26,014
That was 15 years ago.

929
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:30,269
Did the right time ever come?

930
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,955
Not the right person.

931
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,780
Do you remember that tampon
you found in my bathroom?

932
01:16:01,909 --> 01:16:04,209
That thing belonged to a
young girl I was in love with.

933
01:16:06,336 --> 01:16:07,290
What...

934
01:16:09,895 --> 01:16:11,891
What kind of chance did we have?

935
01:16:12,847 --> 01:16:14,974
She and I? None.

936
01:16:15,754 --> 01:16:17,925
At best we could have dragged it out
a couple of years but in the end

937
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:21,961
she'd have realized
there was little room

938
01:16:22,743 --> 01:16:26,649
in her life for a man thirty
odd years older than she.

939
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:31,033
Nothing

940
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:34,938
ever should have happened
between me and that girl.

941
01:16:36,544 --> 01:16:38,671
It was just a mistake.

942
01:16:52,516 --> 01:16:54,296
You're getting old David.

943
01:16:57,509 --> 01:17:01,414
The way men look at me
changes every day.

944
01:17:05,928 --> 01:17:08,357
There are women my age,

945
01:17:08,748 --> 01:17:11,136
a lot of women who are on

946
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:13,350
these dating...

947
01:17:13,784 --> 01:17:15,736
websites.

948
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:19,686
You're guaranteed a certain
number of dates per year.

949
01:17:21,249 --> 01:17:24,070
And you pay for the silence...

950
01:17:27,412 --> 01:17:29,322
and...

951
01:17:30,581 --> 01:17:33,401
the same conversation,
every time.

952
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,169
I like them like that.

953
01:17:44,339 --> 01:17:48,809
Is it possible that this is really the
first time we talked to each other?

954
01:17:51,544 --> 01:17:52,846
Well...

955
01:17:55,451 --> 01:17:59,096
After 20 years of sleeping together,
it's not bad.

956
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:01,222
I know a lot of people who

957
01:18:02,308 --> 01:18:06,084
never got that far in 40 years of marriage.

958
01:18:29,131 --> 01:18:31,257
What time is your flight?

959
01:18:31,951 --> 01:18:33,688
9:30.

960
01:18:34,513 --> 01:18:36,031
I'll take you.

961
01:18:40,589 --> 01:18:41,804
No.

962
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:46,883
Why start now?

963
01:20:03,356 --> 01:20:05,658
<i>I concentrated on my work.</i>

964
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:09,695
<i>I kept asking myself if it was right</i>

965
01:20:10,258 --> 01:20:14,946
<i>not to go to that fucked up
graduation party of hers.</i>

966
01:20:20,328 --> 01:20:23,670
<i>It took two years but I finally got
past the death of George.</i>

967
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:28,098
<i>I even accepted the loss of Consuela.</i>

968
01:20:28,576 --> 01:20:32,133
<i>I recovered my equilibrium
and my independence.</i>

969
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:38,557
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

970
01:20:53,488 --> 01:20:55,701
The paintings and sculptures
of the day

971
01:20:56,221 --> 01:20:59,261
would literally and figuratively
absorb the energy.

972
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:03,253
They were almost a self-contained
slice of life, if you will.

973
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:06,898
That, you put beautifully

974
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:09,200
in your opening chapter.

975
01:21:09,591 --> 01:21:12,150
But also you're making a comment

976
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:14,103
on the relationship
between art and ownership.

977
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:15,667
Well, that's exactly right.

978
01:21:16,144 --> 01:21:20,397
The people who buy these paintings,
they think that they own the pictures.

979
01:21:20,874 --> 01:21:23,610
But, in reality, the pictures own them.

980
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,953
The pictures own them.

981
01:21:26,518 --> 01:21:28,122
they're allowed to live,
they're allowed to house them all.

982
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,683
They're really custodians for

983
01:21:31,031 --> 01:21:33,679
a period of time.
They're free to admire it,

984
01:21:33,982 --> 01:21:35,805
- they're free to worship it if they like...
- In theory...

985
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:39,018
- you could purchase the Great Pyramid.
- I take your point.

986
01:21:39,408 --> 01:21:43,227
But at the end of the day, the pyramid
will still be around and you'll be...

987
01:21:44,356 --> 01:21:46,265
With the Pharaohs.

988
01:21:46,786 --> 01:21:47,872
My guest today

989
01:21:48,435 --> 01:21:50,867
is Susan Reese, her novel is
"Blue Hyacinth."

990
01:21:51,257 --> 01:21:52,299
This is "Book Chat"

991
01:21:52,602 --> 01:21:53,990
I'm David Kapesh.

992
01:21:55,206 --> 01:21:57,333
Then that's it, that was lovely.
Thank you.

993
01:21:58,028 --> 01:21:59,460
Not too painful.

994
01:21:59,937 --> 01:22:01,370
Indeed!

995
01:22:05,276 --> 01:22:06,448
Thank you.

996
01:22:07,229 --> 01:22:09,746
- Oh, and happy New Year.
- Thank you and congratulations.

997
01:22:10,136 --> 01:22:12,046
It's a really... it's a good read.

998
01:22:13,218 --> 01:22:14,304
Thank you.

999
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,871
One new message.

1000
01:22:38,305 --> 01:22:41,387
Six saved messages.
The first new message.

1001
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:47,767
Hi, David, it's Consuela.

1002
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:49,632
How are you?

1003
01:22:50,502 --> 01:22:53,887
Feels strange to call you, but...

1004
01:22:55,405 --> 01:22:58,184
I want to talk to you,
I want to tell you something.

1005
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:02,480
I want to tell you myself
before you...

1006
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:05,997
hear it from someone else.
I don't know...

1007
01:23:07,559 --> 01:23:10,119
Please, call when you can.
My cellphone number is

1008
01:23:10,466 --> 01:23:12,419
555-0122.

1009
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:15,024
Please call.
Thanks. Bye.

1010
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:19,059
Hi, David, it's Consuela.

1011
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:24,833
I realized that I lived all these years
just to listen to these words.

1012
01:23:26,611 --> 01:23:29,867
I collapsed to the floor,
listening to her message,

1013
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:34,467
again and again, fearing the worst.

1014
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:40,024
She was in love, she was getting married.

1015
01:23:40,632 --> 01:23:43,452
Perhaps she even wanted my blessing.

1016
01:23:57,255 --> 01:23:59,251
David?

1017
01:24:01,421 --> 01:24:03,418
David...

1018
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:05,935
Where are you?

1019
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:12,098
I'm in the car. I was in front of your
building when I left the message.

1020
01:24:13,226 --> 01:24:16,265
What are you doing driving around
New York on New Year's Eve?

1021
01:24:18,088 --> 01:24:19,737
I don't know.

1022
01:24:21,387 --> 01:24:23,513
I don't know what I'm doing.

1023
01:24:23,947 --> 01:24:26,725
What's the matter, Consuela?

1024
01:24:28,765 --> 01:24:30,631
I need to see you.

1025
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:33,149
Then come.

1026
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:35,970
- Do you have time?
- Always.

1027
01:24:36,273 --> 01:24:39,398
- Okay. I'm coming now.
- Yes.

1028
01:25:11,516 --> 01:25:12,341
Hi.

1029
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,903
Hi.

1030
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,210
So...

1031
01:25:39,512 --> 01:25:41,420
how have you been?

1032
01:25:45,978 --> 01:25:47,627
That one's new.

1033
01:25:48,539 --> 01:25:49,840
Yeah, it's...

1034
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:52,402
Edward Weston.

1035
01:25:54,789 --> 01:25:56,916
I like your hair.

1036
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:01,864
I cut a little each day.

1037
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:06,767
So when it disappears
I won't miss it as much.

1038
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,648
I'm sick.

1039
01:26:28,165 --> 01:26:30,032
I have...

1040
01:26:31,378 --> 01:26:33,590
cancer, breast cancer.

1041
01:26:42,054 --> 01:26:44,355
I'm having surgery in two weeks.

1042
01:26:44,702 --> 01:26:46,481
Cancer?

1043
01:26:47,611 --> 01:26:48,998
This is...

1044
01:26:51,256 --> 01:26:52,731
Are you...?

1045
01:26:53,121 --> 01:26:54,381
Afraid? No.

1046
01:26:54,988 --> 01:26:56,291
- No?
- Not exactly.

1047
01:26:56,682 --> 01:26:59,545
That's not what I meant.
I meant...

1048
01:27:01,628 --> 01:27:03,322
What happened?

1049
01:27:07,878 --> 01:27:11,091
I was in the shower one morning and I...

1050
01:27:11,569 --> 01:27:13,348
I felt this...

1051
01:27:13,607 --> 01:27:15,951
thing under my arm.

1052
01:27:16,255 --> 01:27:21,465
So I went to the doctor and he said
it was probably nothing to worry about.

1053
01:27:21,985 --> 01:27:24,415
I went to a second doctor
and a third doctor and...

1054
01:27:24,849 --> 01:27:26,542
You know the story.

1055
01:27:27,194 --> 01:27:29,190
The third doctor said

1056
01:27:29,754 --> 01:27:32,271
it was something to worry about.

1057
01:27:32,834 --> 01:27:34,572
And did you panic?

1058
01:27:36,438 --> 01:27:38,392
Yes, I panicked.

1059
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:43,165
I spent a whole month in pure fear.

1060
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,813
Tonight I was going

1061
01:27:46,074 --> 01:27:48,373
to go to this party,

1062
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:52,106
thinking it would be better than
staying by myself, but...

1063
01:27:54,493 --> 01:27:56,402
David...

1064
01:27:57,097 --> 01:27:58,269
David, no.

1065
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:00,049
Don't cry.

1066
01:28:01,004 --> 01:28:03,174
Do not cry.

1067
01:28:05,386 --> 01:28:09,554
Why didn't you call me? Why didn't
you call me when this happened?

1068
01:28:13,156 --> 01:28:14,719
I couldn't tell you.

1069
01:28:15,934 --> 01:28:18,668
I couldn't tell you of all people.

1070
01:28:21,271 --> 01:28:22,965
You know what's funny?

1071
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:27,870
I feel older than you now.

1072
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:31,689
You promise me one thing,
that if you should ever

1073
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:36,594
start to panic, during the night or during
the day or any time, you'll phone me.

1074
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:40,240
What can I do?

1075
01:28:41,151 --> 01:28:42,323
What can I do?

1076
01:28:48,182 --> 01:28:49,397
It's...

1077
01:28:57,557 --> 01:29:01,029
It's like not being able...

1078
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:04,198
to get into a...

1079
01:29:04,545 --> 01:29:07,323
a comfortable position, because

1080
01:29:07,713 --> 01:29:11,533
no matter which way you turn,
you're stuck.

1081
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:15,612
I'm stuck inside myself.

1082
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:30,065
When I think of all the things
I used to think were so important,

1083
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,974
All the arguments I got
into with my mom,

1084
01:29:33,886 --> 01:29:37,140
It's stupid all the time I wasted.

1085
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:39,223
sleeping...

1086
01:29:39,744 --> 01:29:42,913
sleeping my life away.

1087
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:53,287
David...

1088
01:29:57,366 --> 01:29:59,233
I need to ask you a favor.

1089
01:30:00,709 --> 01:30:02,747
Something I can only ask you.

1090
01:30:04,744 --> 01:30:07,522
Anything.
What is it?

1091
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,281
After you,

1092
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:25,708
I never had a boyfriend.

1093
01:30:28,876 --> 01:30:32,479
who loved my body
as much as you did.

1094
01:30:32,782 --> 01:30:34,693
I find that hard to believe.

1095
01:30:35,907 --> 01:30:37,774
Were there many?

1096
01:30:38,989 --> 01:30:40,552
No.

1097
01:30:40,985 --> 01:30:43,547
What about work?
Never fooled around at work?

1098
01:30:43,894 --> 01:30:45,977
- they all did.
- Well of course they did.

1099
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:51,706
I just wasn't interested.

1100
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:59,475
I know you loved me.

1101
01:31:01,082 --> 01:31:03,771
And you loved my body.

1102
01:31:05,204 --> 01:31:07,244
So...

1103
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:09,501
before the doctors...

1104
01:31:11,107 --> 01:31:13,016
- ruin it...
- Stop.

1105
01:31:13,624 --> 01:31:17,097
Stop talking that way and
stop thinking that way.

1106
01:31:17,618 --> 01:31:20,135
Consuela no-one's going to ruin you.

1107
01:31:27,339 --> 01:31:28,989
Consuela...

1108
01:31:30,898 --> 01:31:33,329
What is it you want me to do?

1109
01:34:19,952 --> 01:34:21,948
That's the Paris Opera House.

1110
01:34:29,804 --> 01:34:31,280
I missed you.

1111
01:34:34,362 --> 01:34:37,182
I missed all the places
we never went.

1112
01:34:58,363 --> 01:35:00,273
Would you like to stay here
tonight?

1113
01:35:06,739 --> 01:35:07,738
No.

1114
01:35:10,082 --> 01:35:11,384
I have to go.

1115
01:35:16,244 --> 01:35:19,674
Would you like me to go with you
when you go to the hospital?

1116
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:24,621
Consuela...

1117
01:35:26,444 --> 01:35:28,702
You can't do this alone.

1118
01:35:32,304 --> 01:35:33,692
Why do you say that?

1119
01:35:34,517 --> 01:35:36,817
You do everything alone.

1120
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:46,714
David...

1121
01:35:47,365 --> 01:35:48,884
Poor man.

1122
01:35:51,184 --> 01:35:53,354
You're more scared than me.

1123
01:36:04,292 --> 01:36:08,067
Will you still want to fuck
me if I lose my breast?

1124
01:36:12,104 --> 01:36:13,666
Will you be up for that?

1125
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:16,140
Will you?

1126
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:34,848
I'm sorry David.

1127
01:36:38,276 --> 01:36:40,141
Really sorry.

1128
01:36:46,869 --> 01:36:48,650
I'm scared, David.

1129
01:36:49,213 --> 01:36:52,903
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1130
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,984
Happy New Year!

1131
01:37:13,606 --> 01:37:15,254
Happy New Year.

1132
01:38:25,004 --> 01:38:26,957
- Dad...
- Hi.

1133
01:38:27,304 --> 01:38:28,474
What are you doing here?

1134
01:38:28,865 --> 01:38:30,774
I wondered if you could
spare me a few minutes?

1135
01:38:32,338 --> 01:38:35,072
- er...

1136
01:38:36,809 --> 01:38:38,154
Alright, come here.

1137
01:38:42,017 --> 01:38:43,059
Yep, uhuh.

1138
01:38:44,535 --> 01:38:47,269
Thanks, I owe you one.

1139
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:49,135
Bye.

1140
01:38:52,087 --> 01:38:53,778
She's in very good hands.

1141
01:38:54,169 --> 01:38:56,036
- I know her surgeon.
- And?

1142
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:57,946
They're going to operate tomorrow.

1143
01:38:58,467 --> 01:39:00,420
She told me in two weeks.

1144
01:39:01,331 --> 01:39:02,284
No.

1145
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:05,845
- They're going to do it tomorrow.
- What does that mean?

1146
01:39:06,235 --> 01:39:07,798
I'm not her doctor. So...

1147
01:39:08,623 --> 01:39:11,791
I don't know exactly, but it's
probably not a good thing.

1148
01:39:14,004 --> 01:39:15,741
It's a nightmare.

1149
01:39:20,688 --> 01:39:22,295
Have you known her long?

1150
01:39:22,988 --> 01:39:25,940
I hadn't seen her for a couple of years.

1151
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:28,935
She called me out of the blue
on New Year's Eve with the news.

1152
01:39:31,539 --> 01:39:36,357
I've got all her phone numbers, but I
don't want to make the wrong move here.

1153
01:39:37,355 --> 01:39:38,787
She... when she left...

1154
01:39:39,264 --> 01:39:42,999
she told me she didn't want me to call her.
She was quite definite about that.

1155
01:39:46,469 --> 01:39:47,467
I'm sorry.

1156
01:39:48,466 --> 01:39:51,635
Yep, I know, I'm coming.

1157
01:39:53,631 --> 01:39:55,367
I'm sorry to have barged
in on you like this.

1158
01:39:55,367 --> 01:39:57,016
I know you're strapped for time.

1159
01:39:57,493 --> 01:40:00,793
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Stay strong.

1160
01:40:01,573 --> 01:40:03,440
That's what you tell your patients.

1161
01:40:04,785 --> 01:40:08,952
It must be really tough. Oncology.

1162
01:40:09,343 --> 01:40:12,467
I was your son.
I was prepared for it.

1163
01:40:12,815 --> 01:40:14,595
- I'm glad to see you again.
- Yeah.

1164
01:40:14,986 --> 01:40:18,067
- And I'm sorry that it was under such uh...
- Me too.

1165
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,930
How are things at home?

1166
01:40:21,278 --> 01:40:23,102
We're still together.

1167
01:40:23,405 --> 01:40:24,968
Thanks for asking.

1168
01:40:25,358 --> 01:40:26,877
I'm glad to hear it.

1169
01:40:31,566 --> 01:40:33,128
Dad...

1170
01:40:36,382 --> 01:40:38,379
What are you gonna do?

1171
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:54,438
Why did she have me
take these photographs?

1172
01:40:54,438 --> 01:40:56,001
Did she want them for herself?

1173
01:40:56,956 --> 01:41:01,686
Or did she intend for me to keep them?

1174
01:41:03,292 --> 01:41:05,289
Well that makes sense.

1175
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,631
Did I ever tell you my theory
about beautiful girls?

1176
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:10,540
A million times.

1177
01:41:10,975 --> 01:41:12,624
No-one can see them.

1178
01:41:13,883 --> 01:41:14,925
Well?

1179
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:17,659
Did you ever see her?

1180
01:41:18,353 --> 01:41:20,784
I mean all of her.

1181
01:41:21,217 --> 01:41:23,388
I didn't understand what I saw.

1182
01:41:24,777 --> 01:41:26,730
A lawyer's answer.

1183
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:29,117
You're over-analysing it.

1184
01:41:29,508 --> 01:41:31,591
Who would end a relationship

1185
01:41:32,198 --> 01:41:34,889
because I missed her graduation party.

1186
01:41:35,323 --> 01:41:38,883
She was this weird clutch
of inconsistencies.

1187
01:41:39,316 --> 01:41:42,485
You're talking about her in the past tense.

1188
01:41:51,078 --> 01:41:53,466
So do you think they will let me in today?

1189
01:41:53,899 --> 01:41:57,720
She just got out of intensive care.
You can go today.

1190
01:41:58,501 --> 01:42:00,367
Kenny, thank you.

1191
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:02,146
You're welcome.

1192
01:42:05,228 --> 01:42:07,875
Time passes when you're not looking.

1193
01:43:20,575 --> 01:43:21,920
David...

1194
01:43:22,398 --> 01:43:23,700
Yes.

1195
01:43:27,867 --> 01:43:30,644
They took the whole thing.

1196
01:43:37,111 --> 01:43:39,237
I didn't think you would come.

1197
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:41,755
Why?

1198
01:43:47,659 --> 01:43:49,828
Why did you think that?

1199
01:43:51,737 --> 01:43:54,689
Because I'm no longer beautiful.

1200
01:43:55,211 --> 01:43:56,774
Yes you are.

1201
01:44:00,549 --> 01:44:02,675
You know Hipolita,
the beautiful Amazonian queen?

1202
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:05,628
She actually cut off her right breast

1203
01:44:06,017 --> 01:44:12,571
so she could shoot her arrows faster
and she was no slouch.

1204
01:44:25,721 --> 01:44:30,540
Will the book be different if
we read it 10 years later?

1205
01:44:32,059 --> 01:44:35,662
You remember my first class.

1206
01:44:41,086 --> 01:44:45,427
- I remember everything.
- Me too.

1207
01:44:46,165 --> 01:44:48,117
Every second.

1208
01:44:59,446 --> 01:45:01,617
I'm gonna miss you.

1209
01:45:26,008 --> 01:45:27,701
I'm here.
