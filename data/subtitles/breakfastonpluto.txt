1
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:12,882
You can throw a fast one.

2
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:26,466
How about it, kitten?
What's the chance of a bit tonight?

3
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,771
Oh, why, yes, of course, boys.

4
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:33,037
I'll leave the front door open,
and you can all troop in and give me a jab.

5
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:35,338
Not up to it, then?

6
00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:40,281
You innocent, shovel-wielding,
horny-handed sons of the native sod.

7
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,381
Not many people are, munchkin.

8
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:47,656
Not many people can take the tale
of Patrick Braden...

9
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,522
a.k.a. Saint Kitten...

10
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:53,929
who strutted the catwalks,
face lit by a halo of flashbulbs...

11
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:57,628
as, "Oh!" she shrieked,
"I told you, from my best side, darlings. "

12
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:00,769
<i>I was born, you see, munchkin...</i>

13
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:03,775
<i>in a small town near the Irish border.</i>

14
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:07,242
<i>I was left in a basket
on a certain doorstep...</i>

15
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:09,337
<i>and only the robins knew why.</i>

16
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:12,848
<i>Oh, but then,
they knew everybody's business.</i>

17
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,549
<i>Those red-breasted busybodies.</i>

18
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:20,325
<i>Every secret
behind every lace-curtain window.</i>

19
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:52,854
Robins! Would you believe it, Father?
Pecking at the cream.

20
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:55,516
I suppose it's Christmas morning, after all.

21
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:58,795
Is your breakfast all right?

22
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,868
Well, I'll get ready for Mass, so.
God bless.

23
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:07,173
God bless.

24
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:15,639
He hasn't been himself lately, so.

25
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:42,108
<i>- Just the job.
- Mr. Steed?</i>

26
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,146
<i>- Cutex coral pink.
- Yes.</i>

27
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:48,050
<i>What a charming atmosphere you have here.</i>

28
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:50,749
<i>- Do you mind?
- Not at all.</i>

29
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:53,490
<i>- Thank you.
- Will you have a love seat?</i>

30
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:55,185
The love seat? Why not?

31
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:00,790
<i>Mr. Lovejoy will see you in a moment.</i>

32
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,266
<i>He's just congratulating
one of our happy couples.</i>

33
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,130
<i>- How very encouraging.
- Yes.</i>

34
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,500
<i>Perhaps you'd like a glass of champers?</i>

35
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:10,064
<i>- Champers? Now you're talking.
- Or...</i>

36
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,908
<i>- a piece of wedding cake?
- No, thank you. I've just had breakfast.</i>

37
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,406
<i>Mr. Steed?</i>

38
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,920
My good shoes!
My good shoes, you little brat!

39
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,855
Do it harder, Mammy.
Teach him not to wear my dress again.

40
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,360
He'll make a disgrace of us?
Well, you'll not!

41
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,860
Do you really have to?

42
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,262
I'll march you up and down the street
and disgrace you in front of the whole town.

43
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,322
Promise?

44
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,827
Hit him with it, Ma!
Give him the brush again!

45
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,894
- Say, "I am not a girl. "
- I'm not a girl.

46
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,965
- "I am a boy. I'm not a girl. "
- I'm a boy, not a girl.

47
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,237
Say it right.

48
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:43,502
Make him say it right, Ma.

49
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,978
My heart broke
from the cursed day I ever took you in.

50
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:51,218
<i>A short one by Gareth Carey,
up along the far wing to Tony Haddon.</i>

51
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,778
<i>Tony Haddon, 40 yards out now, from the...</i>

52
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:56,185
<i>Off he goes then,
the ball across him towards the center.</i>

53
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:58,250
<i>And coming, Alfred Whitney.
He's capped there.</i>

54
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,353
<i>Well down over his eyes is Nick Brady.</i>

55
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,125
<i>The ball comes over.
Who's got it? Reid Morgan.</i>

56
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,687
<i>Reid Morgan gets the 35-yard...</i>

57
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,132
Brother Barnabas says he'll try you
on the football team...

58
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:07,829
and I want you to read this.

59
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:10,134
<i>Heading high and to the right,
and yes, it is...</i>

60
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:13,233
<i>It's gone over the bar
for the first goal of the game.</i>

61
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:14,670
<i>Paddy Gardy.</i>

62
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,747
<i>The first goal of the game.
Paddy Gardy took one from this side.</i>

63
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:23,480
<i>It had a curl on it, and one had to wait
until the umpires gave their decision...</i>

64
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:25,384
<i>as to whether it was in or not. It was.</i>

65
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,788
And I call my mother names.

66
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,725
Well, you know,
you shouldn't do that, my son.

67
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:31,819
What do you call her?

68
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:33,490
Hairy Arse.

69
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:38,699
Hairy Arse and Bockedy Hole.
And Cunthooks.

70
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,576
- Stay where you are! You must not proceed.
- Jesus!

71
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:56,281
You must not curse.
If you curse, you'll be exterminated.

72
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:57,343
Holy fuck!

73
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:00,358
You've been warned, earthling.
Now you must die!

74
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:01,894
No, Dalek, please.

75
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:12,038
- Sausages, sausages, stay where you are.
- Yes, yes, of course! Please don't shoot!

76
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,504
- Lawrence, come on.
- Not now, I'm busy. I'm busy.

77
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,646
- Come on.
- I'm busy.

78
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,447
Oh, figgly boogles, I'm dead.

79
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:23,411
Die for Ireland?

80
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,007
I'm sorry, but it appeared to me...

81
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:26,918
that someone here
had taken leave of their senses.

82
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,819
Are you playing the game or not, Braden?

83
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,622
Me play! Dying for Ireland.
Earthling, stay where you are!

84
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:35,221
Well, come on, Englishman, a bullet, please.

85
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:41,730
And next up is the dashing Feely...

86
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:46,538
sporting a smoking jacket,
fedora hat, and sunglasses by Gucci.

87
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:47,869
Madam.

88
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:54,148
The man himself.

89
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:58,420
- Your mother will be back in a while.
- Oh.

90
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,427
So how's Patrick
and the Braden household?

91
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:05,755
They're well, Mr. Feely.

92
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:09,461
Especially my mother, wherever she is.

93
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,038
So someone's told you something, Patrick?

94
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:15,863
They don't have to.

95
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:19,271
Hairy Arse Braden tells me every day.

96
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:20,810
Patrick, now...

97
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,305
I'm sorry, Mr. Feely.

98
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,159
You know, I saw her once,
your real mother...

99
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:36,827
long after the day she left.

100
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,129
It was in London.

101
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,231
I was doing work for Genie McQuillan.

102
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:46,702
I was going home through Piccadilly...

103
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:50,240
and there, passing by, was Eily Bergin.

104
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:53,706
<i>Lovely as the day she left,
I swear it to God.</i>

105
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,910
<i>Did you talk to her, Mr. Feely?</i>

106
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:02,721
What did she say?

107
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:06,091
I shouted after her, Patrick,
but she didn't hear.

108
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,162
London swallowed her up.

109
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,461
The most beautiful girl in the town.

110
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,770
Biggest city in the world...

111
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,501
it swallowed my mother up.

112
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,039
What about my father, Mr. Feely?

113
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:27,674
I wouldn't know about that, son.
Things be complicated, you know.

114
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:31,914
What did she look like?

115
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:38,783
Mitzi Gaynor, son.

116
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:41,759
That's who she looked like, Mitzi.

117
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,071
Mitzi Gaynor.

118
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:49,595
Well, fuck me pink with a hairy arse!

119
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:04,544
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

120
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,001
You see, once upon a time...

121
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,566
there was a young girl named Eily Bergin...

122
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:29,745
who looked not unlike
the well-known film star Mitzi Gaynor...

123
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:33,277
<i>who sang I'm Gonna Wash That Man
Right Outta My Hair.</i>

124
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:38,450
And she went to London,
the biggest city in the world...

125
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,250
which swallowed her up.

126
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,524
But before she vanished...

127
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,900
I think she worked
as a priest's housekeeper, Father.

128
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:50,929
But I could be wrong there, couldn't I?

129
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,601
I mean, I could be wrong. After all, I...

130
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,120
All I wanted was her address.

131
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:10,123
<i>There between the Po
and the Apennines, boys...</i>

132
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:12,226
<i>the climate is always the same.</i>

133
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:15,094
The landscape never changes...

134
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:18,326
and in country like this
you can stop along any road for a moment...

135
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,235
and look at a farmhouse
sitting in the middle of maize and hemp...

136
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:25,802
and immediately a story is born.

137
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:29,568
Now, when you're writing your essay for me
this morning...

138
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:32,136
whatever form it takes is up to you.

139
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:36,618
It can be called
"I Fought in the Easter Rising"...

140
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:40,913
"I Was Dracula's Girlfriend"...

141
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:44,822
or even "A Day in the Life of an Old Boot".

142
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:50,292
You've got one hour, so learn to write.

143
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,725
"God bless us.

144
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,360
"It's yourself"...

145
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:20,331
- God bless us. It's yourself, ma'am.
- It is indeed, Father.

146
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,594
<i>...remarked...</i>

147
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:26,626
randy Father Liam...

148
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,033
<i>as he opened the door...</i>

149
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:32,309
<i>to a young woman...</i>

150
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:35,480
<i>who bore a startling resemblance...</i>

151
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,380
<i>to Mitzi Gaynor.</i>

152
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,176
So you are the replacement
for Mrs. McGlynn?

153
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,846
I am indeed, Father.

154
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:45,520
Destroyed with the lumbago, she is.
Destroyed, and that's a fact.

155
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:48,062
But sure she'll be back on her feet soon,
please God.

156
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,893
Please God she will, now.

157
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,591
But tell me this...

158
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,695
have I begun to dote...

159
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:58,037
or do you remind me of someone special?

160
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:01,701
<i>When she sensed a movement...</i>

161
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:05,908
<i>underneath his black serge trousers.</i>

162
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,073
Oh, Father, please, how could I?

163
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,514
When I've gone out of my way...

164
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:13,578
knowing that your dicky doodle,
naughty poopster that he is...

165
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,619
given the slightest encouragement...

166
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,592
would be only too eager
to get up to mischief...

167
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,128
Down, boy! Naughty dicky...

168
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:23,932
to camouflage myself and look like
any ordinary old curate's drudge.

169
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,802
"And most definitely not...

170
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:31,437
"a perfume-sprayed vision...

171
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:34,638
"named Mitzi Gaynor...

172
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:38,777
<i>"with a head of bubble-cut curls...</i>

173
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:43,745
<i>"that would make any man's privates
go sprong. "</i>

174
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,686
I've got the standard uniform, Father.

175
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:48,385
The blue housecoat
with the bow at the back...

176
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:51,690
the tan stockings, color of stale tea...

177
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,890
the old hairnet,
which says to all them Mickies...

178
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,990
whose duty it is to stay inside
and wear black serge...

179
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,004
"No Mickies today.

180
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,870
"Down, boys. That's it, my sweets,
off with you and say your prayers. "

181
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,772
Breakfast, Father?

182
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:05,400
By God, and now you're talking.

183
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,149
Mickey is devious...

184
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:13,847
<i>and no matter how much you tell him...</i>

185
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,755
<i>he simply won't stay down.</i>

186
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:20,457
<i>But drab old housecoats...</i>

187
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:24,158
<i>and tea-colored stockings
might well have kept him down...</i>

188
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:27,565
<i>if it wasn't for that pesky spot of grease.</i>

189
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,962
Oh, this is powerful altogether.

190
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:35,607
I would do jail for another rasher.
Do you know that, Eily?

191
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:38,475
I'll fry you some more
this minute, then, Father.

192
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:43,947
Come here till I tell you. Did you hear
the one about peanuts at confession?

193
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,078
No, Father. At least I don't think so.

194
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:49,648
Says the priest to the young fellow, "Did
you throw peanuts in the river, too?"

195
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:53,491
To which the young lad says,
"No, Father, I am Peanuts. "

196
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,693
<i>Not a very funny joke...</i>

197
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,004
<i>but she laughed and she laughed.</i>

198
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:09,813
<i>In fact, you could say
she laughed until she cried.</i>

199
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,942
My skirt and housecoat are riding up.

200
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,610
Better abort this task at once...

201
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:19,213
or we could have an exploding clergyman
filling the air with pent-up sexual energy.

202
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,316
Oh, no!

203
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:22,451
- Priest grows wings in latest miracle.
- Eily!

204
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:26,988
<i>"When she found herself enveloped
by his skirts. "</i>

205
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:30,365
Now, Father, is this another joke?

206
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:33,028
That hurt, Father.

207
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:37,475
Frank Sinatra wouldn't do this, Father.
Neither would Vic Damone.

208
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,207
I'm all wet, Father.

209
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,911
What are you doing down there, Father?

210
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:45,345
Are you playing squidgy
with my Fairy Liquid?

211
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,519
<i>But she was soon to realize...</i>

212
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:52,284
<i>it wasn't Fairy Liquid
he'd been playing with down there.</i>

213
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,889
<i>The end.</i>

214
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:58,821
<i>No...</i>

215
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:02,534
<i>it wasn't Fairy Liquid at all.</i>

216
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,471
"... privates go sprong. "

217
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:11,840
"Privates go... "

218
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:13,380
How dare you?

219
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:16,578
When I said,
"develop your literary skills"...

220
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:19,521
I did not, repeat, not, mean this.

221
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,317
Why did you write it?

222
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,122
I thought there was a moral, sir.
A lesson, if you will.

223
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,194
Young girls in mortal danger.

224
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:31,894
Get out of this classroom, Braden!
To the Dean's office!

225
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:34,538
Hello, class. My name is Miss Kitten...

226
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:38,372
and I'd like to tell you about the perils
of being a priest's housekeeper...

227
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:41,308
especially when you look like Mitzi Gaynor.

228
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:43,869
Hands up who can tell me
who Mitzi Gaynor is.

229
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:46,415
So, you see, Patrick, we're on your side.

230
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,847
We're here to help you.
I don't think you understand that.

231
00:17:49,922 --> 00:17:51,786
Well, no, you're wrong, Father. I do.

232
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:55,815
So, if you can think of anything
that would help us to help you, well...

233
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:58,518
Well...

234
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,990
there is one thing, Father.

235
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:06,467
- Instead of PE...
- Yeah.

236
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:10,765
...I could take Home Economics
and Needlework class.

237
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:15,070
And you think that would help you...

238
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:17,942
knuckle down and apply yourself?

239
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,445
What's that, Patrick?

240
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:26,057
Oh, and you can call me Kitten, Father.

241
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:28,116
Kitten?

242
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:31,891
Yes, Patrick Kitten Braden,
after Saint Kitten.

243
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:39,873
Well, now,
there was no Saint Kitten, Patrick.

244
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:42,271
Oh, no,
but there was a Saint Cettin, Father...

245
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,369
and some have been known to call him...

246
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,414
or was it a her...

247
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:47,741
Kitten.

248
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,413
Saint Kitten?

249
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:55,257
He or she was an acolyte of Saint Patrick.

250
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:59,761
Wore a dress. As did Saint Patrick,
actually. A hairy dress.

251
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:02,327
Quite ruined her complexion.

252
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:06,130
And they're for your sister, Patrick?

253
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:10,637
Oh, she really needs a bit of glamour
in her life, Mrs. Coyle.

254
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,644
But then again, don't we all?

255
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:19,009
<i>The trouble broke out as the Minister of
State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Channon...</i>

256
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:21,711
<i>was visiting Derry
to see businessmen there...</i>

257
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,080
<i>for the second time inside a month.</i>

258
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:27,221
Jesus, Mammy, I'm exhausted.

259
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:29,959
At least you have a job...

260
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:33,395
which is more than that waster yonder
is ever likely to have.

261
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,432
Now, one more complaint from that school...

262
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,367
and it'll not be good for you,
by Christ, it'll not.

263
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,363
Oh, Mammy?

264
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,500
Do you have the price of the dance
and a cup of coffee?

265
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:47,044
Price of the dance and a cup of coffee?

266
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,704
Price of the dance and a cup of coffee?

267
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:51,478
Well, do you think I'm made of money?

268
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,541
Do you think I'm made of money?

269
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,413
Will you just hand over the cash?

270
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,888
Will you just fork out the money...

271
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,825
and stop blathering,
you fucking whiskery old whore.

272
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:03,727
Here. And don't ask me again.

273
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:07,798
Well, thank you so much, Mammy.
Thank you so much.

274
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:54,278
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- Why not?

275
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:57,219
I'm not obliged to give you any reasons,
but I'll give you two anyway.

276
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,686
Him and her.

277
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,752
Don't have to stand for this, do we, Paddy?

278
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,816
Oh, Paddy's her name.
Well, that's reason number three.

279
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:06,422
- Did you ever ride a man, Lukie?
- No, but I rode a man that did.

280
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,530
Fuck you.

281
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,362
- Evening.
- How you doing?

282
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,099
Mikey, go get the lads.

283
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,243
I'm warning you, get out of here!

284
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,752
Fuck them and their Rob Strong.
We'll go to the glen.

285
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,421
Excuse me. Can we have a lift?

286
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,157
Get on.

287
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,561
Moving out.

288
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:06,752
Druids, man. We're like the Border Knights.

289
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,990
Knew all about the space-time continuum.

290
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,134
- No, Lawrence! No. Excuse me, please.
- Open his eyes.

291
00:22:16,907 --> 00:22:18,932
- What do you see, bro?
- Sausages.

292
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:20,873
No stars?

293
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:23,040
Stars and sausages.

294
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:27,884
Now you're talking.

295
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:30,151
Gotta get behind the surface.

296
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:31,944
Yes, surface.

297
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,189
I see four green fields,
Brits in one of them.

298
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:41,424
- Not for fucking long.
- Hey, no politics, man.

299
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,924
Border Knights don't allow them.

300
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,864
Jams the astral highway.

301
00:22:47,072 --> 00:22:50,041
So why do you call yourselves
the Border Knights?

302
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:53,044
Because the only border that matters...

303
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:56,709
is the one between what's in front...

304
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,414
and what you've left behind.

305
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:02,883
When I ride my hog,
you think I'm riding the road?

306
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:04,115
No way, man.

307
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:08,391
I'm traveling from the past into the future
with a druid at my back.

308
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:13,528
- Druid man or druid woman?
- That doesn't matter.

309
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:18,501
What matters is the journey.

310
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,910
- You know where it goes, baby?
- Where?

311
00:23:25,546 --> 00:23:29,210
<i>We'll visit the stars and journey to Mars</i>

312
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:32,015
<i>Finding our breakfast</i>

313
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,880
<i>On Pluto</i>

314
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,221
Pluto?

315
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:38,648
Pluto.

316
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:44,499
No, not Pluto the dog. Pluto the planet.

317
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:50,328
Named by Percival Lowell
and William H. Pickering...

318
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:54,566
after the invisible king of the underworld.

319
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:04,048
You think about that.

320
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:16,531
Oh, kiss me, Joseph.
Kiss me, Joseph Hanratty.

321
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:18,330
I'll beat your fucking...

322
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:27,875
Now, boys and girls...

323
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:31,814
a retreat is time for prayer and reflection.

324
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:35,916
Some of you may have already noticed
that your bodies are...

325
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,589
going through some changes...

326
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:42,351
and I would like you to feel free
to approach us...

327
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,090
about any problem that concerns you.

328
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:48,965
So, I will leave this problem box...

329
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,730
here by the altar rails.

330
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:54,942
No problem should be precluded.

331
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:59,042
After all, that is why we are here.

332
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,740
Now, does everyone remember last week
we were talking about...

333
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:14,924
You'll not bring my retreat into disrepute,
do you hear me?

334
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,488
How dare it. How dare you, you pup, you...

335
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:18,759
Sir, you're hurting me.

336
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:26,474
- What did you write on the paper, Patrick?
- Nothing.

337
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,766
Nothing.

338
00:25:28,411 --> 00:25:31,539
Just, did he know any place
that does a good sex change?

339
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:51,527
Disgraced!

340
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:55,005
Disgraced in front of the whole town,
so we are! Oh, Jesus!

341
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:58,134
How could you do it, Paddy?
Mammy has a bad heart!

342
00:25:58,343 --> 00:26:01,005
- And now you've broken it.
- Oh, God, oh, God!

343
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:03,412
Oh, Jesus Christ. My arm!

344
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:06,411
- She's not my mammy.
- What did you say?

345
00:26:07,153 --> 00:26:10,681
I'm sorry, Caz.
Sorry, Mammy, wherever you are.

346
00:26:10,757 --> 00:26:12,987
Oh, stop it, Patrick, please!

347
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:15,458
Why won't you stop it
and let us get on with our lives?

348
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:18,054
I'm sorry, Caz. I never meant to hurt you.

349
00:26:18,698 --> 00:26:21,565
- After all, we've both been through this...
- Get away!

350
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:23,865
Get your hands off me, you creature!

351
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:27,640
Oh, figgly boogles. What's the point?

352
00:26:28,576 --> 00:26:30,941
That's it, I've tried my best. I'm off.

353
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,119
Are you going to Scotsfield, by any chance?

354
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:51,565
We'd better be. We're playing there tonight.
Get in the back.

355
00:26:57,173 --> 00:26:58,161
Hello.

356
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,713
What do you think of this trouble up North?

357
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:18,894
- Oh, I think it's an absolute terror.
- Do you think so, yeah?

358
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:22,023
Oh, I do it.
A terror to the living world, so it is.

359
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,295
I don't think you care either way...

360
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:26,462
my good-looking young friend.

361
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:28,800
No, I know how serious it is.

362
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,509
They think they can break us, don't they?

363
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:36,147
Hang Paddy from the ceiling.
Fuck him from a helicopter.

364
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:38,645
Give him a dose of white noise.

365
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:41,144
Shove electrodes up his arse.

366
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:45,022
- Now, really, Mr...
- Hatchett. They call me Billy Hatchett.

367
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:48,619
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Hatchett.

368
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,295
You really don't know who I am, do you?

369
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:54,561
I haven't had the pleasure.

370
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:59,195
Do you hear that, lads? He's never heard
of Billy Hatchett and the Mohawks.

371
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:50,951
So, have you somewhere
to stay tonight, Paddy?

372
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:54,426
Or should I call you Patrick?

373
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:58,693
You can call me Kitten, darling.

374
00:29:58,901 --> 00:29:59,924
Kitten?

375
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,903
After Saint Cettin.

376
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:06,805
He or she was an acolyte of Patrick,
Saint Patrick.

377
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:10,038
So you have somewhere to stay, then?

378
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,209
Mammy threw me out, I'm afraid.

379
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,016
Well, I could always put you up in the van.

380
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:21,818
- It's not much, but I could.
- Mr. Hatchett!

381
00:30:27,097 --> 00:30:28,565
Thank you.

382
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:33,863
You're welcome, Kitten.

383
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:41,109
I'll be off to the hotel, then, Kitten.

384
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:47,448
I'd stay the night.
I'd stay the night, but the boys...

385
00:30:47,518 --> 00:30:49,644
The boys might get the wrong idea.

386
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:51,447
No, I've gotta go.

387
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:54,220
- I've gotta go.
- Oh, please don't go just yet.

388
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,692
Oh, Kitten. I gotta go. I really have.

389
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,364
Billy! Billy, Billy.

390
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:11,133
It's Bobby Goldsboro.

391
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,571
Used to help me get to sleep.

392
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:21,077
His wife dies. You see,
she dies when he's away from home.

393
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,823
- Oh, Kitten, I've gotta go now.
- Billy.

394
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:28,156
I really have.

395
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:32,958
If you were away with the band...

396
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:38,734
and you came home
and you found me lying there...

397
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:43,267
like Bobby's wife...

398
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:47,714
What about it?

399
00:31:49,086 --> 00:31:52,781
- Would you take me to the hospital?
- Oh, of course I would.

400
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:54,718
Of course I would, Kitten.

401
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:57,691
Oh, I wish that could happen.

402
00:31:58,362 --> 00:32:02,230
I've seen it all now. I tell you,
I've fucking well seen it all now.

403
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:04,061
Where the fuck
do you think he disappeared to...

404
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:06,067
when we were in San Francisco?

405
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,061
I'd even bring you flowers.

406
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,733
- Roses?
- Roses.

407
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,613
Oh, Billy.

408
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:20,443
Oh, Kitten.

409
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:22,276
Billy.

410
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:30,387
For I ask you, Billy Bobby, nicest man...

411
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:33,131
what's an Indian band without a squaw?

412
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,757
"A squaw?"

413
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,551
- Name, please?
- Paddy Kitten. What's yours, darling?

414
00:34:02,662 --> 00:34:05,357
I could tell you were a Paddy all right.

415
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:17,103
- What about Geronimo?
- What would I know? I'm just a Mick.

416
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,701
Thirteen of your lot shot in Derry.
What do you know about that?

417
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,614
Maybe you'd know about thirteen less
to deal with.

418
00:34:24,717 --> 00:34:27,186
Fuck off, mate.

419
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,157
Fuck off.

420
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:07,586
Get off the fucking stage, you stupid bitch.

421
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:22,173
Patrick, I don't know
how to say this to you.

422
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,210
It's the boys, the boys in the band.

423
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:28,177
They feel a squaw just isn't working out.

424
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,420
It could be they have a point.

425
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,150
They say it doesn't feel right.

426
00:35:34,226 --> 00:35:37,422
I don't know,
they've been with me so long and...

427
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:39,623
I'm sorry.

428
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:42,097
But I have a little proposal.

429
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:45,460
- A ring, perhaps?
- Oh, Patrick, Patrick...

430
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:50,032
I told you not to call me that.

431
00:35:51,077 --> 00:35:53,476
I'm sorry, Kitten.

432
00:35:57,016 --> 00:36:02,010
Bobby Billy,
would you bring me sweeties, too?

433
00:36:02,422 --> 00:36:03,788
You know I would.

434
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:07,353
- What kind would they be?
- Oh, for the love of Jesus.

435
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:10,760
- No. No, Quality Street.
- Quality Street?

436
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:32,646
It was my mother's.
She left it to me in her will.

437
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:36,713
Nobody stays here, and I need somebody
to look after it, Kitten.

438
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:40,728
- What do you reckon?
- House of dreams and longing.

439
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,960
I wouldn't exactly call it a house,
but tell us what you think.

440
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:56,367
Oh, to have a little house.
To own the hearth, stool and all.

441
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,317
So, Kitten, can I come and visit you
every now and again?

442
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,945
Of course you can,
you great, big, silly Bobby Goldsboro.

443
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,184
You don't even have to ask.

444
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:50,331
Well, goodness gracious, icky-oakie me.

445
00:38:16,465 --> 00:38:18,990
- What?
- What's with Diana Ross?

446
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:20,862
Leave him be, he knows nothing.

447
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:22,871
- Keep it that way.
- No problem.

448
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:53,802
If I volunteer, Irwin,
could I have pink glasses, please?

449
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:56,202
Can't you take anything serious?

450
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:59,407
Oh, serious, serious, serious.

451
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:01,775
You might have to soon enough.

452
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:05,918
<i>So fucking what, Charlie?
I sell Republican News.</i>

453
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:08,954
A few fucking papers, big deal.
What are you, my fucking wife?

454
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:11,784
Don't you lie to me, Irwin.
I don't believe your stories.

455
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:15,989
I'm involved in nothing! I sell their paper,
for all the difference it makes in this kip.

456
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,757
Nobody gives a fuck!

457
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,059
Soon enough they fucking will.

458
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:21,760
If I find out you're lying to me,
I'll finish with you, I swear!

459
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:24,804
Yeah, well, finish it with me,
see if I fucking care!

460
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:35,706
Come on, move off the road.
There's a vehicle coming through.

461
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:37,945
Get back. It's for your own safety.

462
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:45,054
<i>Get these people off the street!</i>

463
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:48,527
<i>I want everyone to move away
from the red van!</i>

464
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,996
Come on, folks. Stand back, please. Move!

465
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:53,967
Bring it down careful now. Yeah, gently.

466
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:57,496
- Please, move back.
- Move back.

467
00:39:57,974 --> 00:40:00,943
<i>Now let the Army go to work.
Get back, now, get back.</i>

468
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,942
Move back and clear the area.

469
00:40:04,014 --> 00:40:06,572
<i>- There may be other devices.
- You're to get away now. Get back, now.</i>

470
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,913
<i>Get away from the street.
Get off the street now.</i>

471
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,646
Clear this area for your own safety.

472
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:11,813
Move back.

473
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:15,257
- It's a Dalek. Exterminate.
- Lawrence!

474
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:19,523
Exterminate. Exterminate.
Exterminate. Exterminate.

475
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,190
Exterminate.

476
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:53,534
Dust thou art,
and unto dust thou shalt return...

477
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:56,697
until the Lord raises
you up on the last day.

478
00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:00,400
Let us pray for our brother Lawrence
to our Lord Jesus Christ...

479
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:04,505
who said,
"I am the resurrection, and the life.

480
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:07,840
"The man who believes in me will live
even if he dies. "

481
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,043
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

482
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:14,844
Thy kingdom come...

483
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,818
thy will be done on earth,
as it is in heaven.

484
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:20,288
Give us this day our daily bread.

485
00:41:51,228 --> 00:41:53,253
Serious, serious.

486
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:56,231
Time for some serious spring cleaning.

487
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,268
Fuck.

488
00:42:03,074 --> 00:42:04,371
Don't you know what this means?

489
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:06,967
Do you know
what these guys are like, Paddy?

490
00:42:07,146 --> 00:42:10,273
- Don't let this come between us, Billy.
- Shut up!

491
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:15,543
Jesus, what the fuck am I gonna do?

492
00:42:17,222 --> 00:42:20,751
- Fucking Jesus!
- Tell them I was spring cleaning, darling.

493
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:24,161
Where are they, Paddy?
Tell me, where are they?

494
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,494
Now, what is this you mean, my darling?

495
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:29,195
The guns, you little fucking whore,
where are they?

496
00:42:29,268 --> 00:42:32,362
The guns! It's all too fucking serious!
Don't go fucking me around.

497
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,168
Oh, all of a sudden
everybody's getting serious.

498
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:37,072
Serious, serious, serious.

499
00:42:37,143 --> 00:42:38,942
I'm not fucking joking, Patrick!

500
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:42,141
- Where are they?
- I told you to call me Kitten.

501
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,956
Don't fucking know me.

502
00:42:53,094 --> 00:42:54,822
You don't know where I've gone.

503
00:42:54,896 --> 00:42:58,387
And if they come, if they fucking come,
you tell them nothing.

504
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:01,268
- I mean nothing.
- Whatever you say, darling.

505
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:03,702
You're way out of your league, Patrick.

506
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:06,931
You don't know what you're dealing with.
Don't fucking know.

507
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,137
Oh, I do. I know, all right.

508
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:13,581
I know you were only joking
about the roses...

509
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,617
and sweets, too, probably.

510
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:23,019
But it was nice while it lasted.

511
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:44,277
Are you happy now?

512
00:43:44,684 --> 00:43:46,947
Are you happy now
that you got what you wanted?

513
00:43:47,018 --> 00:43:49,146
Now that they've bombed down here?

514
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:51,413
Are your Republican friends
good and happy...

515
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:53,652
now they can see what they've done?

516
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:56,253
What the fuck are you talking about?

517
00:43:56,862 --> 00:43:59,161
It had nothing to do with Republicans.

518
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:03,094
What the fuck would they bomb
a southern town for, huh?

519
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:06,628
You hear me, Charlie?

520
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,900
And if you want out, just say so.

521
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:37,666
Open the door.

522
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:42,570
- I can't, go away. Come back in the
morning. - Open it, bitch! This is serious!

523
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:46,206
- Open the fucking door!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I'm coming.

524
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:09,067
- Where did he put them?
- I'm afraid I don't understand.

525
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,836
The guns, Nancy boy.
Where did he put the guns?

526
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,240
Oh, yes, the guns.

527
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,907
Oh, Billy buried them outside
just to be safe.

528
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,074
Go.

529
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,347
There's no fucking guns down here.

530
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:27,987
- I think they might just be...
- The little cunt!

531
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,617
- He's taking the hand out of us.
- ... over here.

532
00:45:29,695 --> 00:45:32,492
I'll nut him! I swear to God I'll nut him!

533
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:37,034
Say goodbye to my friends, will you?

534
00:45:37,103 --> 00:45:39,367
Charlie lives in Sunbeam Heights
and Irwin's up The Backs.

535
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,498
Irwin who?

536
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:41,900
Why, Irwin Kerr, of course.

537
00:45:41,974 --> 00:45:44,911
- The big-time Volunteer.
- How do you know Irwin Kerr?

538
00:45:44,978 --> 00:45:47,914
Oh, nothing. Never mind.
Well, come on then.

539
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:51,550
Just do it. I've nothing left to live for
in this stupid, serious world.

540
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:52,641
Oh, fuck him.

541
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:55,211
Leave him be. He's not worth the bullet,
the mental Nancy boy.

542
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:58,190
Oh, what is it with Nancy boys
that you can't be bothered killing them?

543
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:00,251
- You kill everyone else.
- Look, I'm fucking warning you.

544
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:02,853
Do you know what you're doing here?
Are you on dope or what?

545
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:05,990
Wish that I was, Mr. Killing Man.
Why, do you have any?

546
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,733
You're way out of your league, sunshine.

547
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:10,931
Not that again.
"Out of your league, out of your league. "

548
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:13,134
"Oh, you're in over your head.
You're in over your head. "

549
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:14,675
Oh, for heaven's sake!

550
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:17,235
Surely you've one bullet to spare
between yous.

551
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:19,041
Bollocks!

552
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:29,489
- Where are we going?
- You hit us, we hit you.

553
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:31,550
- It's simple.
- Right.

554
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:34,391
The bomb was made up here
and driven across the border.

555
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:37,126
Wee Bobby Anderson.
Likes killing Catholics.

556
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:39,396
It'll be the last fucking bomb he'll make.

557
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:41,735
Turn the lights off. Keep it running.

558
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,469
Oh, Lord.

559
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:32,086
Get us the fuck out of here, will you?

560
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:35,219
- What's the smell?
- He shat himself.

561
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:36,956
You not toilet trained?

562
00:47:38,467 --> 00:47:42,164
What do you think you are, Kerr?
What the fuck do you think this is?

563
00:47:47,643 --> 00:47:48,836
Tell me you're not serious.

564
00:47:48,945 --> 00:47:51,572
You see, there is that word again.
It's everywhere.

565
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:54,081
But you don't know a soul
in London, Paddy.

566
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,481
There's only one soul I need, Charlie.

567
00:48:00,789 --> 00:48:02,724
You really think you'll find her?

568
00:48:02,793 --> 00:48:04,885
How many Eily Bergins can there be?

569
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:06,862
Maybe she's changed her name.

570
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:09,697
She won't have changed her eyes, Irwin.

571
00:48:12,902 --> 00:48:14,393
How will you get by?

572
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,007
Saint Anthony will guide me.

573
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,940
The thing is, you come to the city
that never sleeps...

574
00:49:27,016 --> 00:49:29,349
and you think it's open all the time,
but it does sleep.

575
00:49:29,418 --> 00:49:30,909
Excuse me?

576
00:49:31,855 --> 00:49:33,115
Of course it does.

577
00:49:33,188 --> 00:49:36,748
I'm looking for my mother, please.
Eily Bergin. Phantom Lady.

578
00:49:38,862 --> 00:49:42,297
I've just got two Bergins for 1956.

579
00:49:42,364 --> 00:49:45,528
Bergin, Ellen,
and Bergin with a simple initial E.

580
00:49:46,036 --> 00:49:48,903
Well, that's her.
I mean, it has to be one of them.

581
00:49:49,172 --> 00:49:52,938
One's from Aldgate
and the other's from East London.

582
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,873
Will you be going back home
after you've found her?

583
00:49:57,947 --> 00:50:00,974
Oh, yes, of course.
Maybe she'll come with me.

584
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:06,347
- And, son, will you promise me something?
- Yes.

585
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:11,288
- Take care of yourself.
- Oh, I will, Mrs. Henderson.

586
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:12,588
Thank you.

587
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:44,663
No, mate,
they knocked those houses down years ago.

588
00:51:35,952 --> 00:51:36,943
I'm...

589
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,824
The man himself.

590
00:52:47,396 --> 00:52:48,795
About time, too.

591
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,103
Are you here for the job, kid?

592
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,731
What job?

593
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,503
This is showbiz, kid.
You gotta be on the ball.

594
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:03,978
You try that with Stephenson,
now, you've no fucking chance.

595
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,240
Who's Stephenson?

596
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,681
He thinks he's in charge.
RAF, my bollocks! I'll give him RAF.

597
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:12,380
- You're Irish, you are.
- Tyreelin, County Cavan.

598
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,353
Well then, County Cavan...

599
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,327

I told you before,
these are your responsibility.

- Fuck!

623

630
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:59,670
"I'll have to dock it from your pay. "
I broke no fucking mallet.

631

- You're out of your league here, friend.
- Oh, not that again.

00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:10,934
And my name is Patricia Kitten Braden.

674
00:57:11,146 --> 00:57:14,012
Pleased to meet you, Patricia Kitten Braden.

675
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:17,382
Just what were you doing back there?

676
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:19,443
I was looking for the Phantom Lady.

677
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:21,512
You found the right street, then.

678
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:24,557
Why, what's it called? Phantom Lady Street?

679
00:57:24,693 --> 00:57:28,219
You could call it that.
And just who is this Phantom Lady?

680
00:57:28,496 --> 00:57:31,465
Well, it's my mother, really.
I call her that.

681
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,628
To pretend it's a story
that's happening to someone else, you see.

682
00:57:35,704 --> 00:57:37,536
And why do you pretend that?

683
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:40,336
Because otherwise I might cry
and never stop.

684
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:43,110
If you cried, I'd make you stop.

685
00:57:43,478 --> 00:57:44,945
Oh, you would?

686
00:57:45,181 --> 00:57:47,150
Oh, how kind, kind sir.

687
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:50,315
Yes, I'd definitely make you stop.

688
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:57,452
And just what is it you do, then?

689
00:57:57,829 --> 00:58:01,286
Oh, this and that.
Showbiz, kind of. Singing.

690
00:58:02,266 --> 00:58:05,894
- What do you like to sing about?
- I sing about true love.

691
00:58:06,603 --> 00:58:07,936
That's nice.

692
00:58:08,606 --> 00:58:10,233
Have you ever found it?

693
00:58:11,844 --> 00:58:14,311
I thought I had, once.

694
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:19,213
Here's one about true love.

695
00:58:23,655 --> 00:58:25,213
Ever heard this one?

696
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:28,523
Nice, isn't it?

697
00:58:29,295 --> 00:58:31,387
I just love love songs.

698
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:37,094
Take it off.

699
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:42,364
- Don't you like it?
- Take it off, there's a good lad.

700
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:46,945
As you wish, sir.

701
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:56,449
- Now, isn't that more comfortable?
- Yes, sir.

702
00:58:58,726 --> 00:59:01,753
Of course it is, my love-loving friend.

703
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,630
Here, feel that.

704
00:59:11,072 --> 00:59:13,302
Good old-fashioned silk.

705
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,501
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

706
00:59:25,121 --> 00:59:26,485
It's beautiful.

707
00:59:29,726 --> 00:59:32,523
- You like it?
- It's beautiful.

708
00:59:33,364 --> 00:59:34,661
Like it?

709
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:50,007
<i>But did true love save Kitten
from the hands of the beast...</i>

710
00:59:50,081 --> 00:59:52,447
<i>in that worst of all fairy tales?</i>

711
00:59:52,516 --> 00:59:55,315
<i>No, what saved Kitten...</i>

712
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:57,947
<i>was her precious perfume spray...</i>

713
00:59:58,224 --> 01:00:02,090
<i>bought for Ł2.99
in Roches Stores on Henry Street...</i>

714
01:00:02,161 --> 01:00:04,996
<i>before she left her beloved Emerald Isle.</i>

715
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:16,632
Hello.

716
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:20,340
I'm sorry to interrupt...

717
01:00:20,414 --> 01:00:23,440
but are you all right, miss?

718
01:00:26,186 --> 01:00:28,018
Yes, fine, thank you.

719
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:31,920
Just tired after my hard day's work.

720
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:35,655
You have been sitting there
for four hours now.

721
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:40,590
Yes, busy at my desk.

722
01:00:42,036 --> 01:00:43,766
Busy at your desk?

723
01:00:46,742 --> 01:00:48,438
Writing my little book.

724
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:51,813
Your little book?

725
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,818
What type of book?

726
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:00,853
Well, it's a...

727
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:04,018
It's a mystery thriller, sir.

728
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:06,221
About a woman who disappears.

729
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:10,762
May I ask what it's called?

730
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,099
Yes.

731
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,034
It's called...

732
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,603
<i>Footprints in the Custard.</i>

733
01:01:23,581 --> 01:01:26,414
No, I'm only joking.
It doesn't have a name yet...

734
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:30,487
because I don't know what's gonna happen
if the mystery is ever solved.

735
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:32,952
But the lady has a name?

736
01:01:34,893 --> 01:01:36,327
Phantom Lady.

737
01:01:37,664 --> 01:01:39,096
"Phantom Lady. "

738
01:01:41,867 --> 01:01:45,702
No, her real name's Eily Bergin.
She was my mother.

739
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:47,465
- Your mother?
- Yeah.

740
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:49,666
And then she went away
to the city of all cities...

741
01:01:49,742 --> 01:01:52,041
that never sleeps from dusk till dawn.

742
01:01:52,378 --> 01:01:56,440
- So, you think she's here in London?
- No, I know she's here in London.

743
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:57,882
Fantastic!

744
01:01:59,586 --> 01:02:02,213
The fantastic tale of Eily Bergin.

745
01:02:02,856 --> 01:02:04,882
I can't wait to hear the ending.

746
01:02:05,327 --> 01:02:09,318
- But you haven't even heard the start.
- I can't wait to hear that, either.

747
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:14,835
- So, are you a writer, too, then, sir?
- Oh, good Lord, no.

748
01:02:17,172 --> 01:02:19,936
But something similar, maybe.

749
01:02:20,175 --> 01:02:23,576
Something similar?
I wonder what that could be.

750
01:02:30,219 --> 01:02:31,811
You're a magician!

751
01:02:32,822 --> 01:02:35,382
Bertie Vaughan at your service.

752
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,958
Now, the first thing that has to be said,
Bertie dearest...

753
01:02:41,231 --> 01:02:45,599
is that you bear absolutely no resemblance
to Marlon "Margarine" Brando.

754
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,965
We all have our off days.

755
01:02:49,706 --> 01:02:52,472
So, tell me more about the Phantom Lady.

756
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:55,041
Why? What's in it for me?

757
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,405
I'll take you to see my show.

758
01:02:57,581 --> 01:03:00,277
Oh, it's a deal, Magic.

759
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:05,152
So, where were we? Yes, the Phantom Lady.

760
01:03:05,356 --> 01:03:07,826
Eily Bergin had just arrived in Dublin...

761
01:03:07,893 --> 01:03:11,954
and just realized that her boat
didn't sail for another four hours.

762
01:03:22,976 --> 01:03:24,876
Lo and behold, not a scratch.

763
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:26,643
Thank you, my dear.

764
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:29,942
Pick a card.

765
01:03:30,717 --> 01:03:31,742
Anyone?

766
01:03:32,385 --> 01:03:34,378
Come along, madam, pick a card.

767
01:03:34,521 --> 01:03:35,920
Any card.

768
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:44,262
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, yes, blimey.

769
01:03:44,331 --> 01:03:45,891
"Oh, my God" is right.

770
01:03:45,967 --> 01:03:49,903
<i>I do believe you've
chosen the 101 of hearts.</i>

771
01:03:49,972 --> 01:03:52,496
Thank you, my dear, I'll take care of that.

772
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:57,067
Time, of course.

773
01:03:57,512 --> 01:03:59,309
The time.

774
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:02,715
Looks like it's up, you lovely people.

775
01:04:03,485 --> 01:04:07,012
Come on, help me, please, my loves.

776
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:12,884
Anyone out there
willing to encounter the great watch?

777
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:20,369
- Hello, young lady.
- Hello.

778
01:04:21,172 --> 01:04:24,766
And what's the story
behind those beautiful blue eyes?

779
01:04:28,143 --> 01:04:33,014
- What's your name, young lady?
- Patricia Kitten Braden.

780
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:36,413
- And where are you from, my dear?
- Ireland.

781
01:04:36,721 --> 01:04:39,985
Keep your eye on the watch, young Patricia.

782
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:43,492
The whole world is in there.

783
01:04:45,429 --> 01:04:47,193
Tick-tock.

784
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:51,565
Swing-swong.

785
01:04:53,206 --> 01:04:54,969
And, dare I say it...

786
01:04:55,608 --> 01:04:57,371
ding-dong.

787
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:02,605
And let the great watch guide you.

788
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:17,893
And what brings you
to our great metropolis?

789
01:05:18,565 --> 01:05:20,327
I'm looking for my mammy.

790
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,971
Oh. And where did Mummy go?

791
01:05:24,938 --> 01:05:28,739
- The city swallowed her up.
- Oh, fancy that.

792
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,443
Well, it will do that to people.

793
01:05:33,148 --> 01:05:35,844
But do you know what, Patricia?

794
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:39,552
- I think I see your mother.
- Where?

795
01:05:39,655 --> 01:05:42,853
Why, down there
by that table by the jukebox.

796
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,983
Mammy!

797
01:05:48,465 --> 01:05:51,159
On second thoughts, Patricia...

798
01:05:51,233 --> 01:05:54,032
she's not your mother,
she's your great-aunt Ida.

799
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:56,637
That's your mother over there.

800
01:05:57,074 --> 01:05:58,405
Mammy?

801
01:05:59,943 --> 01:06:01,411
Mammy!

802
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,239
Oh, Mammy.

803
01:06:06,516 --> 01:06:07,813
Actually...

804
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:12,585
Patricia, that's your second cousin Ronnie,
just out of the Scrubs.

805
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:15,257
In fact...

806
01:06:16,494 --> 01:06:18,690
your mummy is right up here.

807
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:22,228
Up here on stage.

808
01:06:23,135 --> 01:06:24,864
Come to Mummy.

809
01:06:25,938 --> 01:06:27,873
Come to Mummy.

810
01:06:28,675 --> 01:06:30,574
Come to Mummy.

811
01:06:30,809 --> 01:06:32,800
Come to Mummy.

812
01:06:33,177 --> 01:06:36,876
You love your mummy and your poppy.

813
01:06:38,418 --> 01:06:40,717
Good to have you back, darling.

814
01:06:41,322 --> 01:06:43,311
And Mummy's never leaving again.

815
01:06:43,389 --> 01:06:44,619
Never.

816
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,817
Never.

817
01:06:47,659 --> 01:06:50,025
Never, I promise. Never.

818
01:07:11,052 --> 01:07:13,681
Just call me Old Sawbones.

819
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,597
- You all right, dear?
- Yes.

820
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,318
Those of a nervous disposition...

821
01:07:41,385 --> 01:07:44,878
should now close their eyes.

822
01:07:49,461 --> 01:07:50,655
Oh, dear.

823
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:00,634
Are you all right, Kitten?

824
01:08:02,172 --> 01:08:04,802
No, I'm actually quite heartbroken.

825
01:08:10,983 --> 01:08:13,144
I think I see the problem.

826
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,779
Gee, thanks, Cupid.

827
01:08:51,565 --> 01:08:54,363
And the other thing
about the Phantom Lady was, Bertie...

828
01:08:54,435 --> 01:08:58,132
she realized,
in the city that never sleeps...

829
01:08:58,206 --> 01:09:00,198
What did she realize, Kitten?

830
01:09:00,408 --> 01:09:04,573
That all the songs that she'd listened to,
all the love songs...

831
01:09:05,113 --> 01:09:07,377
well, they were only songs.

832
01:09:07,515 --> 01:09:11,077
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing, if you don't believe in them.

833
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:13,815
But she did, you see.

834
01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:16,551
She believed in enchanted evenings...

835
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:20,721
and she believed that a small cloud
passed overhead...

836
01:09:20,796 --> 01:09:23,356
and cried down on her flowerbed.

837
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:27,328
And she even believed
there was breakfast to be had.

838
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:28,391
Where?

839
01:09:29,538 --> 01:09:30,734
On Pluto.

840
01:09:31,676 --> 01:09:35,578
The mysterious, icy wastes of Pluto.

841
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:42,085
You know, Kitten,
I made a decision a long time ago.

842
01:09:43,255 --> 01:09:44,881
What decision was that?

843
01:09:46,024 --> 01:09:49,960
That I wasn't destined
for the sentimental side of things.

844
01:09:51,764 --> 01:09:52,752
But...

845
01:09:53,465 --> 01:09:57,731
But if I did let myself
ever fall for someone...

846
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:01,398
I think it would be a girl like you.

847
01:10:01,474 --> 01:10:04,306
Bertie, please, I have to stop you.
There's something you should know.

848
01:10:04,377 --> 01:10:07,038
Or maybe what I should say is...

849
01:10:08,782 --> 01:10:10,443
it would be a girl...

850
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:15,212
- not a million miles away from...
- No, please don't.

851
01:10:15,355 --> 01:10:16,948
...where I'm standing.

852
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:19,581
No.

853
01:10:23,264 --> 01:10:25,230
What's the matter, princess?

854
01:10:27,536 --> 01:10:29,969
Well, you see, the thing is, Bertie...

855
01:10:31,506 --> 01:10:32,939
I'm not...

856
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,130
Yes?

857
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:38,601
I'm not a girl.

858
01:10:39,514 --> 01:10:41,483
Oh, I knew that, princess.

859
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:45,443
- You did?
- Of course.

860
01:10:46,721 --> 01:10:48,189
What I said was...

861
01:10:49,559 --> 01:10:51,753
it would be a girl like you.

862
01:11:00,804 --> 01:11:03,829
<i>I do believe I see Mummy over there.</i>

863
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:08,175
Mammy!

864
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:16,448
<i>Actually, she's just walked in. There.</i>

865
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,488
Mammy! Mammy.

866
01:11:22,126 --> 01:11:23,492
Bastards!

867
01:11:24,662 --> 01:11:26,596
Think you can make fun of her?

868
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,425
You're coming with me.

869
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,430
Wait!

870
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,398
Please don't leave me.

871
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,368
What about the Prince of Magic?

872
01:11:39,813 --> 01:11:42,872
- Please don't go.
- Some fucking Prince of Magic.

873
01:11:42,983 --> 01:11:45,884
No, maybe I should...
He doesn't mean bad, Charlie.

874
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:48,819
For Christ's sake, Paddy,
what is happening to you?

875
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:50,917
Kitten!

876
01:12:17,953 --> 01:12:19,045
Excuse me.

877
01:12:26,296 --> 01:12:28,922
John Joe. John Joe!

878
01:12:29,164 --> 01:12:30,154
John Joe!

879
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:33,257
Not a Womble anymore.

880
01:12:34,037 --> 01:12:37,997
Don't talk to me about fucking Wombles!
I'm in the Tower of London now.

881
01:12:39,342 --> 01:12:43,779
Thirty smackers in the paw, boy,
no questions asked.

882
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:45,849
Hey, they're looking
for a Mary Queen of Scots.

883
01:12:45,914 --> 01:12:49,148
- Would you be up for it?
- They'd chop my head off, surely.

884
01:12:49,587 --> 01:12:51,782
And here's the man to do it for you.

885
01:12:53,556 --> 01:12:54,957
Smiley, huh?

886
01:13:34,902 --> 01:13:36,333
Where's Irwin gone?

887
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:39,898
Him and his fucking revolution.

888
01:13:52,988 --> 01:13:55,684
- How'd you carry it?
- Bottom of my sleeping bag.

889
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,485
There won't be much sleeping
with this baby.

890
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,564
So you haven't seen her, then?

891
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:07,595
She's here, though, somewhere.

892
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,831
I know it. I just know it, Charlie.

893
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:12,029
Big fucking city.

894
01:14:13,842 --> 01:14:15,640
I'm losing Irwin, you know.

895
01:14:16,846 --> 01:14:17,904
How?

896
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:21,818
He's up to something. I know it.

897
01:14:23,753 --> 01:14:25,381
He's got these secrets.

898
01:14:27,591 --> 01:14:29,525
So why did you come over, Charlie?

899
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:31,255
Wasn't just to see me.

900
01:14:32,797 --> 01:14:34,925
Was it something to do with Irwin?

901
01:14:37,368 --> 01:14:38,836
You might say that.

902
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:44,069
I'm pregnant.

903
01:14:48,648 --> 01:14:50,309
Oh, Jesus, Charlie.

904
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,378
Does he know?

905
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:57,118
You know all he knows about.

906
01:14:58,324 --> 01:14:59,757
Or cares.

907
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:11,292
But you didn't come here to have the baby?

908
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:16,274
I came here to get rid of it.

909
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:25,886
You have to tell him, Charlie.

910
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:28,520
I can't.

911
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:31,389
He's all fucked up. He's...

912
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,823
So, how are the homeless?

913
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,065
Homeless are fine.

914
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:43,305
That's what keeps him out late, Kitten...

915
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:45,703
working with the homeless.

916
01:15:46,443 --> 01:15:47,704
Right, Irwin?

917
01:16:05,326 --> 01:16:08,261
- I can't have it, can I, Paddy?
- No.

918
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:11,527
No, you can't.

919
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,934
Irwin's involved in shit
I don't wanna think about.

920
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,164
I know.

921
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:22,237
What would it turn out like, Paddy?
You know what I mean, don't you?

922
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:27,371
It'd be an absolute disaster, like me.

923
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:33,546
Now, I want you to read this leaflet.

924
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:37,052
It outlines all aspects
of the termination procedure.

925
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:39,287
Termination?

926
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:43,430
- You mean this is an abortion clinic?
- Yes, of course it is.

927
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,001
I thought it was a fertility clinic.

928
01:16:54,045 --> 01:16:56,479
I think she changed her mind. Thank you.

929
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:08,820
You said it'd be a disaster, like you.

930
01:17:09,427 --> 01:17:11,760
Worse, probably.

931
01:17:12,297 --> 01:17:16,826
- But I love you, you fucking disaster.
- Oh, Charlie.

932
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:27,106
- Promise you won't get lost again?
- I promise.

933
01:17:28,981 --> 01:17:29,970
Tell him.

934
01:17:31,685 --> 01:17:32,912
Tell me what?

935
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:37,320
Charlie's joining the Sandinistas.
Aren't you, Charlie?

936
01:17:37,425 --> 01:17:40,484
- Sandinistas?
- They're a rock band.

937
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,291
- Aren't they, Charlie?
- Where can I reach you?

938
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,465
Try Cambridge Circus.

939
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:03,845
See you, Paddy.

940
01:18:54,305 --> 01:18:58,173
- You and me, darling. What do you say?
- I don't quite know what to say.

941
01:19:00,579 --> 01:19:02,207
Christ, you're a bloke!

942
01:19:02,282 --> 01:19:04,909
Ten out of ten, Sherlock.

943
01:19:25,972 --> 01:19:27,940
You fancy a drink or something?

944
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:32,947
Campari and soda, if you don't mind.

945
01:19:33,146 --> 01:19:34,581
Of course I don't.

946
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:37,015
Wouldn't have asked you otherwise,
would I?

947
01:19:37,086 --> 01:19:39,077
Campari and soda, please, mate.

948
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:46,461
There you go, mate.

949
01:19:47,564 --> 01:19:48,551
Cheers.

950
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,662
Thank you.

951
01:19:57,975 --> 01:20:01,307
- Crowded tonight.
- Oh, yes.

952
01:20:01,377 --> 01:20:04,939
- Football supporters?
- No, Royal Engineers.

953
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:06,912
Oh, soldiers.

954
01:20:07,184 --> 01:20:09,377
Just come back from a tour of duty.

955
01:20:09,653 --> 01:20:13,646
- Aden? Cyprus? No, let me guess.
- Fucking Ulster.

956
01:20:15,793 --> 01:20:17,819
I haven't got anything
against the Irish, though, mind.

957
01:20:17,895 --> 01:20:21,457
- I hear they're very friendly.
- Don't know. Maybe.

958
01:20:24,034 --> 01:20:27,493
It's the politicians what
fuck it up, though, isn't it?

959
01:20:31,377 --> 01:20:33,072
Do you wanna dance?

960
01:20:34,814 --> 01:20:36,440
Yes, I'd love to.

961
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:54,497
- You okay?
- Oh, yes. Super.

962
01:20:56,304 --> 01:20:58,465
You seem a little bit tense.

963
01:21:01,842 --> 01:21:03,902
Would you do something for me?

964
01:21:04,912 --> 01:21:06,278
Yeah, of course.

965
01:21:08,983 --> 01:21:11,542
Would you pretend your name's Bobby?

966
01:21:12,822 --> 01:21:13,880
Bobby who?

967
01:21:15,824 --> 01:21:17,292
Bobby Goldsboro.

968
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,261
It's his song, you see.

969
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:24,760
Bobby it is, then.

970
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:30,265
All you have to do is plant a little tree...

971
01:21:30,606 --> 01:21:33,234
surprise me with a puppy...

972
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:35,911
I'll hug your neck.

973
01:22:26,966 --> 01:22:29,230
Back. Go to the back end.

974
01:22:29,802 --> 01:22:31,737
Get as many men down as you can.

975
01:22:31,805 --> 01:22:33,829
All right, my love,
we're gonna get you out of here.

976
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:36,434
Come on, my love. Can you stand?

977
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,943
That's it.

978
01:22:41,015 --> 01:22:42,949
As many people as we can get out
through the door.

979
01:22:43,018 --> 01:22:44,645
Take my shoulder, love.

980
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,653
You're all right, mate, I've got you.

981
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,779
My tights.

982
01:22:47,855 --> 01:22:49,518
- Easy, easy.
- Steady down there. Steady.

983
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:51,287
My tights! They're in ribbons.

984
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:53,885
You're alive, love, that's the main thing.
Come on.

985
01:22:53,962 --> 01:22:56,523
I know what I'll have to do,
I'll have to get a new pair.

986
01:22:56,599 --> 01:22:59,033
There's no other way, I'm afraid.

987
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:04,139
Keep still, darling.
Don't try and move, okay?

988
01:23:04,207 --> 01:23:06,333
Please, let us through now!

989
01:23:06,442 --> 01:23:07,807
Watch out.

990
01:23:09,145 --> 01:23:12,204
- I told you, from my best side, darlings.
- Bring the other ambulance.

991
01:23:12,282 --> 01:23:13,646
Slow down.

992
01:23:13,984 --> 01:23:15,884
That's it. Slowly now.

993
01:23:16,853 --> 01:23:19,822
Come on, get out of the way, please!
Come on.

994
01:23:20,257 --> 01:23:23,694
- Out of the way.
- Please, nurse, he's in so much pain.

995
01:23:25,329 --> 01:23:28,765
No, they're Christian Dior.
Do you really have to?

996
01:23:38,475 --> 01:23:42,936
How silly can you get,
putting an "X" across my weenie.

997
01:23:43,015 --> 01:23:48,010
Not so silly as 11 fucking people
blown to pieces...

998
01:23:48,087 --> 01:23:49,885
you twisted little cunt!

999
01:23:49,956 --> 01:23:53,585
Fucking baby-faced, fucking Irish murderer!

1000
01:23:57,363 --> 01:23:59,695
I'm sorry, did you call?

1001
01:24:00,734 --> 01:24:04,466
I can't quite see where you are.
I'm over here, you see.

1002
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:09,006
Millions of miles up here
with Sirius guarding my head.

1003
01:24:09,076 --> 01:24:11,373
Tell him what he wants to know!

1004
01:24:12,012 --> 01:24:15,539
It's free. Everyone thinks
it's cold up here...

1005
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:17,083
but it's actually quite warm.

1006
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:20,679
Yes, it's warm as toast up on Pluto.

1007
01:24:20,988 --> 01:24:21,978
Pluto.

1008
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:27,984
Don't try the fucking blarney on us, Paddy!

1009
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,226
We know you planted the fucking bomb!

1010
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,966
But of course I did, my darling.

1011
01:24:34,037 --> 01:24:36,436
Why, I've planted hundreds of them.

1012
01:24:36,506 --> 01:24:39,532
Have you now? Well, plant this!

1013
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:46,180
Hello, officer.

1014
01:24:46,716 --> 01:24:48,206
I'm over here.

1015
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:51,148
Just take a left at the Milky Way.

1016
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,988
<i>We'll travel to Mars and visit</i>

1017
01:24:55,059 --> 01:24:57,220
Christ, I can't fucking stand this!

1018
01:24:57,293 --> 01:25:01,993
Listen, son,
why don't you just make a statement?

1019
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,865
A statement, officer?
Why didn't you just say so?

1020
01:25:06,938 --> 01:25:10,896
Attaboy. There's no point
making it hard for all of us.

1021
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:14,604
Of course not.
After all, we're all friends here.

1022
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:26,246
Let's start with where you were
on Thursday, October 17th.

1023
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:32,588
I was in my little cell
working with my active service unit.

1024
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:35,426
But I was working undercover.

1025
01:25:36,036 --> 01:25:37,435
Undercover?

1026
01:25:43,043 --> 01:25:46,502
Oh, it's all coming back to me now.
Pen and paper, please.

1027
01:25:55,789 --> 01:26:00,228
<i>Patricia Kitten,
a.k.a. Deep Throat...</i>

1028
01:26:00,295 --> 01:26:04,993
<i>had penetrated the deepest recesses
of the Republican sphincter...</i>

1029
01:26:07,703 --> 01:26:11,002
<i>with her secret anti-terrorist spray...</i>

1030
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:15,404
<i>named after Gabrielle Coco Chanel's
lucky number.</i>

1031
01:26:17,779 --> 01:26:20,078
The stability of Semtex
will be compromised.

1032
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:23,448
<i>Oh, but, Lord, was she sick of that black.</i>

1033
01:26:25,155 --> 01:26:28,648
<i>What is it with freedom fighters
and couture anyway?</i>

1034
01:26:43,408 --> 01:26:45,706
You've got fuse support and booster charge.

1035
01:26:45,777 --> 01:26:48,644
What can I say?
We've got here the pressure plate...

1036
01:26:57,289 --> 01:26:58,416
<i>Stop</i>

1037
01:27:43,372 --> 01:27:45,168
Is there anyone here?

1038
01:27:45,274 --> 01:27:47,242
Why won't he just talk to us?

1039
01:27:47,309 --> 01:27:50,369
Did he or didn't he, dressed as a woman,
get caught by his own bomb?

1040
01:27:50,445 --> 01:27:53,381
We've held him six days now.
Seven's the max.

1041
01:28:04,595 --> 01:28:05,788
Paddy?

1042
01:28:07,797 --> 01:28:11,564
- You all right?
- Fine. Absolutely wonderful.

1043
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:16,867
Meet us halfway, will you, Paddy?
Tell us why you came over here.

1044
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:20,474
Well, I was just looking for someone.

1045
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:24,002
- I was just looking for Eily Bergin.
- Who's Eily Bergin, Paddy?

1046
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:28,051
She's gone undercover now.

1047
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:30,747
The biggest city in the world
swallowed her up.

1048
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:33,757
Could she help us
with our inquiries, Paddy?

1049
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,221
She could help me with mine.

1050
01:28:35,295 --> 01:28:38,264
Do you want us to find her?
Have you got an address?

1051
01:28:39,864 --> 01:28:43,426
- You could try The House That Vanished.
- The House That Vanished.

1052
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:48,831
Oh, Christ. I think we're all losing it.

1053
01:28:57,184 --> 01:29:00,983
We're gonna get some sleep now, Paddy.
We're gonna get some sleep.

1054
01:29:01,323 --> 01:29:05,384
Look, I think we may have made a mistake.

1055
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:09,090
- Officer?
- What is it now?

1056
01:29:09,963 --> 01:29:14,297
If you came home from the office
and you found me lying on the floor...

1057
01:29:14,969 --> 01:29:18,564
- would you take me to the hospital?
- Well, of course I would.

1058
01:29:19,341 --> 01:29:21,902
And would you carry me
like you're doing now?

1059
01:29:22,545 --> 01:29:23,908
Well, yeah.

1060
01:29:24,512 --> 01:29:29,381
So if I wasn't a transvestite terrorist,
would you marry me?

1061
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:31,918
No, for fuck's sake.

1062
01:29:40,329 --> 01:29:43,560
Well, is Officer Wallis
gonna be a happy man or what?

1063
01:29:43,632 --> 01:29:46,659
We've held you too long
by all accounts. Look.

1064
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,265
Oh, no, you can't.

1065
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:53,707
You can't. Not when I'm settling in so well.

1066
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:01,144
Take your head off my shoulder, son.

1067
01:30:04,555 --> 01:30:06,921
You don't understand, Paddy.
We can't keep you here.

1068
01:30:06,992 --> 01:30:08,960
It's impossible.
We couldn't even if we wanted to.

1069
01:30:09,027 --> 01:30:12,121
Fuck this, I'm going on a long holiday.
Wife says I need it.

1070
01:30:12,197 --> 01:30:13,460
Come on!

1071
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:16,797
Come on, just for one day.
It wouldn't kill you.

1072
01:30:16,868 --> 01:30:18,962
Sorry, Paddy. It's impossible.

1073
01:30:19,405 --> 01:30:22,431
- Okay, a half-a-day, please?
- No.

1074
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,740
Look, do you mind me asking?

1075
01:30:27,814 --> 01:30:31,613
I mean, why do you wanna...
I mean, it don't make any sense.

1076
01:30:32,118 --> 01:30:34,780
- It just makes me feel secure.
- Secure?

1077
01:30:35,122 --> 01:30:36,487
Yes, you see, in the cell...

1078
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:40,390
sometimes I think my legs
are turning into air...

1079
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,689
and I'm floating in space,
and I'm all alone.

1080
01:30:43,832 --> 01:30:46,027
"Galactic aloneness,"
I've heard that called.

1081
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,796
Please, Routledge.

1082
01:30:49,304 --> 01:30:51,100
I just wanna belong.

1083
01:30:52,506 --> 01:30:57,240
I'd be your best prisoner.
I'd cook and I'd clean and I'd sweep...

1084
01:30:57,313 --> 01:30:59,837
and I'd iron all the uniforms. I...

1085
01:31:00,649 --> 01:31:02,548
- Hey, Paddy!
- I just wanna...

1086
01:31:06,521 --> 01:31:08,887
No, I'm afraid it's goodbye now.

1087
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,932
All right, go get that bus there.

1088
01:31:20,703 --> 01:31:21,863
Go on!

1089
01:31:33,184 --> 01:31:35,652
Jennifer Jones and William Holden.

1090
01:31:40,492 --> 01:31:42,824
<i>Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing?</i>

1091
01:31:46,398 --> 01:31:48,524
Have you ever been in love?

1092
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:55,237
Once I thought I was.

1093
01:31:56,009 --> 01:31:57,771
He was a lucky man.

1094
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:03,814
I'd pay you.

1095
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:08,886
I'd give you whatever you wanted.

1096
01:32:10,557 --> 01:32:13,025
Whatever you wanted, I'd give you.

1097
01:33:12,591 --> 01:33:14,990
That's my mammy! That's my mammy!

1098
01:33:17,261 --> 01:33:19,059
Excuse me! Excuse me.

1099
01:33:20,365 --> 01:33:22,800
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1100
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:28,833
Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me.

1101
01:33:39,586 --> 01:33:40,779
Hello!

1102
01:34:15,457 --> 01:34:18,324
Hello, sir. Can I be of assistance?

1103
01:34:18,395 --> 01:34:21,886
I don't do anything heavy,
but aside from that I'd be more...

1104
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:25,162
I could have you arrested, you know.

1105
01:34:25,234 --> 01:34:27,498
Well, icky-oakie me.

1106
01:34:28,104 --> 01:34:29,297
Get in.

1107
01:34:33,444 --> 01:34:35,912
This is no life
for a young man like you, Patrick.

1108
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:39,279
Well, cuff me then.
Carry me to my sweet cell.

1109
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:40,337
No.

1110
01:34:41,284 --> 01:34:44,082
Oh, wait, you're not an actual punter,
are you? How exciting.

1111
01:34:44,154 --> 01:34:48,421
No, it's not... It's not that either.
It's a lot more serious than that, Patrick.

1112
01:34:48,493 --> 01:34:52,054
Well, of course it is, of course
it's serious. Everything's serious.

1113
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:54,564
Oh, you're gonna die out there, Paddy!

1114
01:34:58,738 --> 01:34:59,966
I know.

1115
01:35:05,677 --> 01:35:08,078
Why don't you try and get a regular job?

1116
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:12,275
Well, to tell you the truth, Inspector,
I'm not that employable.

1117
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:13,841
So I gathered.

1118
01:35:17,423 --> 01:35:18,913
Fucking hell.

1119
01:35:26,934 --> 01:35:28,425
Come with me.

1120
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:39,872
A group of girls
got themselves off the street, Patrick.

1121
01:35:40,148 --> 01:35:41,707
Set up a co-op.

1122
01:35:42,484 --> 01:35:43,850
What do you mean, "co-op"?

1123
01:35:43,917 --> 01:35:47,547
You know, like... Sort of like...
A union, you could call it.

1124
01:35:49,859 --> 01:35:51,052
Girls?

1125
01:35:52,394 --> 01:35:54,487
Hello. Come on.

1126
01:35:56,966 --> 01:35:59,868
It's not ideal, but it's safe...

1127
01:36:00,804 --> 01:36:02,065
and legal.

1128
01:36:02,139 --> 01:36:03,399
Casandra.

1129
01:36:05,141 --> 01:36:07,042
Goddess of Destruction.

1130
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:11,774
- Girls? Hello.
- Hello.

1131
01:36:11,847 --> 01:36:12,975
This is Patrick.

1132
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:14,539
- Hello, Patrick.
- Hello.

1133
01:36:14,618 --> 01:36:16,746
He's a friend of mine, so be gentle.
Hello, Sam.

1134
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:19,654
We're always nice.
Patrick, do you wanna play poker?

1135
01:36:19,724 --> 01:36:21,088
Love poker.

1136
01:36:21,591 --> 01:36:23,389
- Yeah, we'll put him in.
- Are you all right?

1137
01:36:23,461 --> 01:36:26,363
- You'll be working with us?
- I hope so. If you'll have me.

1138
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:27,761
We're a nice bunch here.

1139
01:36:27,832 --> 01:36:30,494
- No bitchiness or nothing here.
- Look at his hair.

1140
01:36:30,569 --> 01:36:32,695
- So where are you from?
- Cavan.

1141
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:35,261
Very nice. I'm from Dublin.
You'll do well here.

1142
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:38,365
You'll like us girls.
So you'll definitely like it here.

1143
01:36:44,016 --> 01:36:46,952
<i>Dear Charlie,
sorry I haven't been in touch...</i>

1144
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:49,750
<i>and I hope that everything
is going fine with you.</i>

1145
01:36:49,823 --> 01:36:51,586
<i>How's the bump?</i>

1146
01:36:51,658 --> 01:36:54,354
<i>Just writing to say
that I've got a new address.</i>

1147
01:36:54,427 --> 01:36:57,396
<i>It's Xanadu on Old Compton Street...</i>

1148
01:36:57,529 --> 01:37:00,158
<i>and you can reach me there at any time.</i>

1149
01:37:00,234 --> 01:37:04,068
<i>I'm saving like mad
to get over to see you when it happens in...</i>

1150
01:37:04,137 --> 01:37:07,699
<i>What is it?
Four months, two weeks, and three days.</i>

1151
01:37:08,944 --> 01:37:10,137
Hello.

1152
01:37:10,612 --> 01:37:12,238
<i>Show me your bazoozums.</i>

1153
01:37:12,314 --> 01:37:14,747
<i>- I beg your pardon?
- You know.</i>

1154
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,753
<i>What's that?</i>

1155
01:37:20,988 --> 01:37:24,720
Now, listen, sir,
we can't all have big bazoozums.

1156
01:37:24,793 --> 01:37:27,627
Some of us are what you might call svelte.

1157
01:37:27,762 --> 01:37:31,289
<i>- Svelte?
- Yes. That's a Swedish word, I believe.</i>

1158
01:37:32,435 --> 01:37:35,871
<i>- There's also a French one.
- Aye, give me the French.</i>

1159
01:37:35,936 --> 01:37:37,235
Gamine.

1160
01:37:37,407 --> 01:37:40,569
<i>- Gamine?
- Yes, and that's what I am, sir.</i>

1161
01:37:40,644 --> 01:37:42,612
A svelte gamine.

1162
01:37:44,014 --> 01:37:48,609
<i>How much is that doggy in the window?</i>

1163
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:53,154
<i>The one with the waggly tail</i>

1164
01:37:53,222 --> 01:37:57,091
Not "waggly," "waggedy. " "Waggedy tail. "

1165
01:37:58,262 --> 01:38:00,229
Dear sir unseen, I know my music...

1166
01:38:00,297 --> 01:38:04,394
<i>and I'm willing to bet you 10 times
whatever pathetic price you paid in here...</i>

1167
01:38:04,469 --> 01:38:07,064
that the dog's tail is waggly.

1168
01:38:08,673 --> 01:38:10,698
Now I wanna hear you bark.

1169
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:24,551
<i>- Hello.
- Please don't do that.</i>

1170
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:29,854
As you wish, sir.

1171
01:38:34,301 --> 01:38:37,362
<i>I don't do this sort of thing often.</i>

1172
01:38:37,438 --> 01:38:40,703
That's all right, sir,
we've got lots of time.

1173
01:38:47,014 --> 01:38:51,384
<i>- I knew a boy like you once.
- Oh, I'm not a boy, sir, I'm a girl.</i>

1174
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:56,149
<i>- Oh, you're a girl.
- Yes.</i>

1175
01:38:57,259 --> 01:39:01,286
You can call me Patricia.
That's my name, sir.

1176
01:39:02,265 --> 01:39:06,792
<i>Can I tell you a story, Patricia?</i>

1177
01:39:06,868 --> 01:39:09,394
Oh, please do. Stories are what I love.

1178
01:39:10,073 --> 01:39:13,474
<i>- You love stories?
- Love stories.</i>

1179
01:39:14,444 --> 01:39:16,435
Even more than mysteries.

1180
01:39:16,779 --> 01:39:19,442
<i>Don't do that, please, please.</i>

1181
01:39:21,985 --> 01:39:24,476
Very well, sir, I'm all ears.

1182
01:39:28,224 --> 01:39:32,822
<i>Once upon a time, there was a boy
who never knew his father and mother.</i>

1183
01:39:33,596 --> 01:39:38,466
Oh, how sad. How unbearably sad.
Was he an unbearably sad little boy?

1184
01:39:39,869 --> 01:39:44,069
<i>He didn't seem so.
No, he laughed. He laughed a lot.</i>

1185
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:48,475
Perhaps the kind of laughter
that disguises tears?

1186
01:39:50,015 --> 01:39:53,952
<i>Maybe laughter was the only way to...</i>

1187
01:39:57,122 --> 01:39:58,613
<i>deal with...</i>

1188
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:02,689
Please go on. To deal with...

1189
01:40:03,563 --> 01:40:06,225
<i>To deal with his circumstances.</i>

1190
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:12,565
You seem to understand this boy
quite well, sir.

1191
01:40:13,608 --> 01:40:15,302
<i>I knew his father.</i>

1192
01:40:17,878 --> 01:40:18,970
And?

1193
01:40:19,912 --> 01:40:21,108
<i>And...</i>

1194
01:40:21,748 --> 01:40:25,412
<i>though his father loved him very much...</i>

1195
01:40:25,485 --> 01:40:30,185
<i>he could never tell the boy how much...</i>

1196
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:32,119
How much?

1197
01:40:35,463 --> 01:40:38,661
He could never tell the boy
how much he loved him.

1198
01:40:40,002 --> 01:40:42,368
Well, this can't be a true story.
It can't be.

1199
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:43,599
Why not?

1200
01:40:43,672 --> 01:40:46,140
Why could he not tell the boy
how much he loved him?

1201
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,006
Because he didn't know how.

1202
01:40:49,112 --> 01:40:54,048
<i>He had the words for many things, you see,
but he didn't have the words for that.</i>

1203
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:57,746
There are only three words for that.
They're easy to say.

1204
01:40:57,921 --> 01:40:59,389
<i>Sometimes they are.</i>

1205
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:03,524
Other times, they're not.
Other times, they're...

1206
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:05,661
They're impossible.

1207
01:41:07,131 --> 01:41:11,966
And he loved the boy's mother, too,
but that was equally impossible.

1208
01:41:18,643 --> 01:41:20,667
So he never told the boy?

1209
01:41:23,613 --> 01:41:26,483
He never told him and then the boy left...

1210
01:41:27,153 --> 01:41:31,521
and came to England, and the father had...

1211
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:44,832
lots of time to think
about all the things...

1212
01:41:45,872 --> 01:41:50,002
all the things that might have been,
should have been.

1213
01:41:50,444 --> 01:41:53,277
He had all the time in the world to think.

1214
01:41:54,515 --> 01:41:56,643
And what did he think about?

1215
01:41:57,252 --> 01:42:01,951
He thought, he imagined perhaps,
that the boy had come to England...

1216
01:42:02,023 --> 01:42:03,922
looking for his mother.

1217
01:42:06,327 --> 01:42:08,659
And what was his mother's name?

1218
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:12,722
- Her name was Eily. Eily Bergin.
- Oh, God.

1219
01:42:13,368 --> 01:42:16,634
And so the father thought
the one thing he could do...

1220
01:42:16,704 --> 01:42:19,672
was tell him where he could find his mother.

1221
01:42:22,811 --> 01:42:25,905
- Where to find the Phantom Lady?
- What?

1222
01:42:25,981 --> 01:42:27,916
Please, go on.

1223
01:42:29,152 --> 01:42:31,381
She married, had two children.

1224
01:42:31,654 --> 01:42:35,091
- Probably won't want to see him.
- But where does she live?

1225
01:42:36,426 --> 01:42:39,828
19 Spencer Rise, in Kilburn.

1226
01:43:00,985 --> 01:43:03,420
'Cause you know what I want,
I want English...

1227
01:43:03,488 --> 01:43:08,448
- I want conservative, I want
East Finchley... - Yeah.

1228
01:43:08,528 --> 01:43:11,963
...I want powerful.

1229
01:43:12,864 --> 01:43:15,925
- You think it works?
- I think you look better than her.

1230
01:43:16,402 --> 01:43:18,733
- I do look better than her, don't I?
- You do.

1231
01:44:03,753 --> 01:44:05,516
Do you need help, miss?

1232
01:44:07,457 --> 01:44:12,326
Yes, I'm doing a survey for British Telecom.

1233
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:18,760
- Do you know where 19 Spencer Rise is?
- That's my house. There.

1234
01:44:18,969 --> 01:44:20,460
It's your...

1235
01:44:20,738 --> 01:44:24,673
- Can't you read numbers?
- No, yes, I can read numbers.

1236
01:44:25,743 --> 01:44:27,643
So, what's the survey?

1237
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:31,539
Well, it's about telephones.

1238
01:44:32,784 --> 01:44:35,810
- Do you have a telephone?
- Everyone has a telephone.

1239
01:44:35,921 --> 01:44:40,016
No, not everyone, young man.
Some people can't afford one.

1240
01:44:40,257 --> 01:44:41,747
Well, we can.

1241
01:44:43,028 --> 01:44:44,221
I see.

1242
01:44:47,867 --> 01:44:50,836
- And so what is your name?
- My name's Patrick.

1243
01:44:53,206 --> 01:44:54,466
Patrick.

1244
01:44:55,074 --> 01:44:57,007
Patrick.

1245
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:59,512
And how many phones
do you have, Patrick?

1246
01:44:59,579 --> 01:45:02,012
Shouldn't you be asking my mother?

1247
01:45:03,216 --> 01:45:05,878
Yes. Yes, of course I should.

1248
01:45:07,654 --> 01:45:09,452
And where would I find her?

1249
01:45:10,824 --> 01:45:14,091
Mum, there's a nice lady here
doing a survey...

1250
01:45:17,931 --> 01:45:19,832
Are you... Oh, my God!

1251
01:45:24,472 --> 01:45:26,703
- You feeling better, love?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

1252
01:45:26,774 --> 01:45:29,301
- Some more tea?
- No, thank you.

1253
01:45:31,546 --> 01:45:35,381
So, what's this survey about, then?

1254
01:45:37,487 --> 01:45:41,389
- It's about phones, Mum.
- Phones? With Telecom?

1255
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:44,122
Yes, British Telecom.

1256
01:45:52,802 --> 01:45:56,762
- Are you a multi-phone household?
- Yes. Yes, we've got three.

1257
01:45:56,908 --> 01:46:00,673
One in the bedroom, one in the kitchen,
and one in Geoffrey's office.

1258
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:06,472
- Geoffrey...
- Is my husband.

1259
01:46:14,193 --> 01:46:15,386
Sorry.

1260
01:46:18,764 --> 01:46:21,061
How frequently is your telephone used?

1261
01:46:22,435 --> 01:46:26,099
Very. Laura's never off it.

1262
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:27,868
Laura?

1263
01:46:29,376 --> 01:46:31,935
My daughter. She's 13.

1264
01:46:32,712 --> 01:46:34,474
I see, I see.

1265
01:46:35,414 --> 01:46:37,849
You don't have much use for the phone,
though, do you, Patrick?

1266
01:46:37,917 --> 01:46:39,783
No, I suppose not.

1267
01:46:46,194 --> 01:46:50,323
- Well, Miss...
- Johnson. Delia Johnston.

1268
01:46:50,664 --> 01:46:51,962
Johnston.

1269
01:46:53,567 --> 01:46:56,595
If you've any other questions,
don't hesitate to call.

1270
01:46:57,538 --> 01:47:00,599
No, I think I have more than enough,
thank you.

1271
01:47:06,381 --> 01:47:08,907
- Thank you for the tea.
- Oh, you're welcome.

1272
01:47:09,018 --> 01:47:10,177
Bye.

1273
01:47:30,474 --> 01:47:32,703
Shouldn't you have a uniform?

1274
01:47:33,844 --> 01:47:36,176
No, I shouldn't have a uniform.

1275
01:47:36,546 --> 01:47:39,210
The men who put the phones in
have a uniform.

1276
01:47:39,283 --> 01:47:40,716
Do they, now?

1277
01:47:40,851 --> 01:47:43,685
- Aren't they from Telecom?
- Yes, they are.

1278
01:47:44,523 --> 01:47:46,889
Then how come Telecom don't know
how many phones we have?

1279
01:47:46,957 --> 01:47:49,391
Well, because
it's from a different department.

1280
01:47:49,461 --> 01:47:52,295
Why don't you just phone up, then,
and ask the questions?

1281
01:47:52,364 --> 01:47:54,798
Because there's nothing
like the personal touch, now, is there?

1282
01:47:54,867 --> 01:47:55,890
Why don't...

1283
01:47:55,967 --> 01:47:59,596
Young man,
I get the feeling you don't like me.

1284
01:48:00,472 --> 01:48:02,907
You're wrong. I think you're nice.

1285
01:48:04,909 --> 01:48:07,243
Well, I think you're nice, too.

1286
01:48:07,514 --> 01:48:11,381
- Why are you crying?
- It's conjunctivitis.

1287
01:48:12,519 --> 01:48:15,750
<i>I gave your address to Father Liam,
and I hope you don't mind.</i>

1288
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:19,780
<i>He's been very kind to me, Kitten,
and I need all the kindness I can get.</i>

1289
01:48:20,094 --> 01:48:23,188
<i>The Special Branch lifted me
on a dope charge, you see.</i>

1290
01:48:23,264 --> 01:48:25,788
<i>And they used that to get to Irwin.</i>

1291
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:29,301
They lifted Charlie on the dope charge.

1292
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:33,662
They said she'd be having the baby
in prison, if I didn't...

1293
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,801
If you didn't what, Irwin?

1294
01:48:39,081 --> 01:48:41,878
If I didn't inform them about operations.

1295
01:48:44,052 --> 01:48:45,577
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

1296
01:48:45,654 --> 01:48:48,555
I can't. I went to school with his brother.

1297
01:48:48,858 --> 01:48:50,792
Hey, lads, did you hear the one
about the Cavan man?

1298
01:48:50,859 --> 01:48:53,192
- What Cavan man?
- Cavan man in...

1299
01:49:44,082 --> 01:49:45,914
What will I call you?

1300
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,448
Father.

1301
01:49:52,192 --> 01:49:54,091
You call me "Father. "
Come in.

1302
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:03,198
I can't.

1303
01:50:04,405 --> 01:50:07,375
I prayed, you know.
I prayed you'd come back.

1304
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:10,667
Did you find her?

1305
01:50:10,744 --> 01:50:14,306
Yes. No. Kind of.

1306
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:18,578
Where's Charlie?

1307
01:50:19,822 --> 01:50:21,813
She's upstairs. Come on.

1308
01:50:26,561 --> 01:50:28,724
After the drugs charge,
there were problems at home...

1309
01:50:28,798 --> 01:50:30,426
so I took her in.

1310
01:50:31,201 --> 01:50:34,226
She hardly eats a thing, you know.
She's wasting away.

1311
01:50:41,912 --> 01:50:43,676
Maybe you could...

1312
01:50:45,048 --> 01:50:47,881
- Where do you sleep, Father?
- Don't worry about me.

1313
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:53,578
Charlie.

1314
01:50:57,796 --> 01:50:59,592
Is that you, Kitten?

1315
01:51:00,198 --> 01:51:04,396
Charlie. Take it easy now.

1316
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:06,961
Swann's Cross.

1317
01:51:07,972 --> 01:51:11,373
- They put a rubbish bag over his head.
- Hush, Charlie.

1318
01:51:12,277 --> 01:51:14,768
My parents told me
to go back where I came from.

1319
01:51:14,847 --> 01:51:17,078
Don't think about it, Charlie.

1320
01:51:17,382 --> 01:51:19,908
Your baby, that's all that matters now.

1321
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,511
And I'm here to help you.

1322
01:51:54,756 --> 01:51:58,248
Robins, Father. Would you believe it?
Pecking at the cream.

1323
01:51:58,326 --> 01:52:00,658
I'm sure the poor things must be starved.

1324
01:52:00,729 --> 01:52:01,719
Ta.

1325
01:52:13,543 --> 01:52:17,002
You have your mother's eyes,
do you know that, Patrick?

1326
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:20,381
Color of the ocean beyond Rosses Point.

1327
01:52:24,389 --> 01:52:26,118
You took her there?

1328
01:52:30,595 --> 01:52:31,993
Many times.

1329
01:52:34,899 --> 01:52:37,630
Things could have been so different.

1330
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:40,832
Don't say anything.

1331
01:52:43,074 --> 01:52:45,542
Because, you know, the strangest thing...

1332
01:52:46,244 --> 01:52:47,974
I went looking for her...

1333
01:52:49,515 --> 01:52:51,141
but I found you.

1334
01:53:04,497 --> 01:53:07,056
No, in the end it was a blessed release.

1335
01:53:07,134 --> 01:53:11,092
She was a lovely woman.
She never missed a day at Mass.

1336
01:53:11,171 --> 01:53:13,902
When they opened her up,
they found a lump as big as a melon.

1337
01:53:13,975 --> 01:53:15,943
A melon? That big?

1338
01:53:16,344 --> 01:53:19,438
Maybe it was a grapefruit.
I get them mixed up.

1339
01:53:19,646 --> 01:53:23,105
So, we're not exactly blessed with choice,
Father, dear.

1340
01:53:24,286 --> 01:53:27,345
And is there any rule
that says that when you're pregnant...

1341
01:53:27,421 --> 01:53:29,412
you need to dress like a lollipop lady?

1342
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:33,324
- I know of no such rule, Patrick.
- No, so I thought.

1343
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:38,329
This little hippy number
might give her the lift she needs.

1344
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,527
Very nice.

1345
01:53:39,601 --> 01:53:40,829
Velvet, Father.

1346
01:53:40,904 --> 01:53:42,667
Like crushed grass.

1347
01:53:43,072 --> 01:53:44,561
Look, Father.

1348
01:53:48,478 --> 01:53:50,810
Oh, can we try the silver fur, missus?

1349
01:53:51,614 --> 01:53:53,081
Is it for yourself?

1350
01:53:55,519 --> 01:54:00,421
Twenty-five different colored Babygros.
Four teddy bears, I can understand...

1351
01:54:00,556 --> 01:54:03,685
- but I don't need a pram yet, Kitten.
- You will.

1352
01:54:04,695 --> 01:54:08,029
- Where did you get the money?
- Oh, singing.

1353
01:54:09,701 --> 01:54:12,828
<i>How much is that doggy in the window?</i>

1354
01:54:13,203 --> 01:54:15,762
<i>The one with the</i>

1355
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:20,467
- Is it waggedy or waggly, Charlie?
- Waggly.

1356
01:54:21,413 --> 01:54:23,404
No, wait a minute.

1357
01:54:23,582 --> 01:54:26,210
- Oh, Father?
- Yes.

1358
01:54:26,284 --> 01:54:31,244
You know the doggy with the tail?
Is it waggly or waggedy?

1359
01:54:31,524 --> 01:54:32,822
The song?

1360
01:54:33,694 --> 01:54:37,595
Waggedy, I seem to remember.
Your mother never stopped singing it.

1361
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:39,029
Aye, waggedy tail.

1362
01:54:39,099 --> 01:54:40,225
Waggedy.

1363
01:54:40,298 --> 01:54:44,327
<i>How much is that doggy in the window?</i>

1364
01:54:44,438 --> 01:54:48,136
<i>The one with the waggedy tail</i>

1365
01:54:48,542 --> 01:54:52,171
<i>How much is that doggy in the window?</i>

1366
01:54:52,246 --> 01:54:54,680
Oh, Jesus Christ and his holy mother.

1367
01:54:55,382 --> 01:54:57,543
- Why doesn't the Bishop do something?
- The Bishop!

1368
01:54:57,618 --> 01:54:59,916
The Bishop we have isn't worth a damn.

1369
01:55:15,337 --> 01:55:17,328
Do you know something, Thomas?

1370
01:55:17,407 --> 01:55:20,604
There are times
when I wish I was a bus conductor.

1371
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:43,954
...the welfare state and all.

1372
01:57:44,029 --> 01:57:46,054
Can't stay here, anyways.

1373
01:57:46,166 --> 01:57:49,158
But you'll come and see us, Father?
After the baby's...

1374
01:57:49,234 --> 01:57:54,229
Well, the only parish I've been offered
is in Kilburn, so you might see a lot of me.

1375
01:58:03,048 --> 01:58:05,109
You saved my life, Father.

1376
01:58:07,288 --> 01:58:08,586
And mine.

1377
01:58:14,328 --> 01:58:16,387
Great, big, fireproof man.

1378
01:58:34,818 --> 01:58:38,015
Come on, Charlie, push! Push!

1379
01:58:38,087 --> 01:58:40,681
I am pushing, Kitten, fuck you!

1380
01:58:40,756 --> 01:58:42,782
- I am pushing!
- Breathe.

1381
01:58:42,859 --> 01:58:45,019
- Jesus!
- Come on.

1382
01:58:45,295 --> 01:58:47,024
It's tearing me apart!

1383
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:59,873
Hey, you're the telephone lady.

1384
01:59:02,613 --> 01:59:06,210
If it isn't the young boy
from the multi-phone household.

1385
01:59:06,452 --> 01:59:07,680
What are you doing here?

1386
01:59:07,752 --> 01:59:11,917
Mum's with the doctor.
She's, you know, got a bun in the fireplace.

1387
01:59:13,993 --> 01:59:17,760
- I think you mean the oven, young man.
- Okay, then, the oven.

1388
01:59:17,963 --> 01:59:19,625
What's your name?

1389
01:59:24,136 --> 01:59:25,627
Phantom Lady.

1390
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:29,640
- That's a funny name.
- I know that. I'm a funny lady.

1391
01:59:30,944 --> 01:59:34,676
- Is that your baby?
- No, it's hers.

1392
01:59:37,018 --> 01:59:39,885
She's having her fireplace checked.

1393
01:59:40,488 --> 01:59:42,854
Isn't she? Yes, she is.

1394
01:59:44,125 --> 01:59:47,356
- Charlie, darling, this is...
- Patrick.

1395
01:59:48,195 --> 01:59:50,220
This is my young friend Patrick.

1396
01:59:50,631 --> 01:59:52,622
So, how's your fireplace?

1397
01:59:55,970 --> 02:00:00,841
And your little bun is just fine, too,
aren't you? Yes, you are.

1398
02:00:07,015 --> 02:00:10,850
Patrick, there's your mum. You'd better run.

1399
02:00:11,386 --> 02:00:12,512
Okay.

1400
02:00:13,256 --> 02:00:16,748
Patrick, will you tell her that...

1401
02:00:17,194 --> 02:00:21,755
the telephone lady says...
that she hopes it's a girl this time.

1402
02:00:21,832 --> 02:00:23,527
- Okay.
- Okay.
