1
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:44,631
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are gathered here today

2
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:50,895
to berieve the loss
of something dear to us.

3
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:57,646
We are here today to say
goodbye to a special friend,

4
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:00,907
to say goodbye to an idea.

5
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:05,512
Some might say that
to be here gathered today

6
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:10,321
to mourn the loss of a car
would be going too far.

7
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:35,173
<i>In 1996, electric cars began to appear
on roads all over California.</i>

8
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:38,345
<i>They were quiet and fast,</i>

9
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,380
<i>produced no exhaust
and ran without gasoline.</i>

10
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:47,818
<i>Ten years later, these futuristic
cars were almost entirely gone.</i>

11
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:51,630
<i>What happened?</i>

12
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:55,899
<i>Why should we be haunted
by the ghost of the electric car?</i>

13
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,867
<i>This wasn't the first time
the electric car was killed.</i>

14
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:06,775
<i>One hundred years ago,
there were more electrics on the road</i>

15
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,976
<i>than there were gas cars.</i>

16
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:12,819
<i>For many people electric
cars were the car of choice.</i>

17
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:17,290
<i>They were quiet an smooth,
and could be charged at home.</i>

18
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:22,964
<i>Gas cars by comparison required
cranking and produced exhaust.</i>

19
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:28,768
I'm so old I remember electric cars,

20
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:31,270
when they were around in the beginning.

21
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,935
<i>I would've been about six years old
on the way to the symphony</i>

22
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,844
<i>in that darling little electric car.</i>

23
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:42,808
<i>They were very quiet, and it
had beveled glass windows.</i>

24
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:47,078
It was almost like
sitting inside a huge lamp.

25
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,220
<i>What happened?</i>

26
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:54,353
<i>Why did the gas car win
over the electric car?</i>

27
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:57,731
<i>As the 20th century gathered speed,</i>

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,234
<i>the electric car lost momentum.</i>

29
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:04,065
<i>Automatic starters, cheaper
oil and mass production</i>

30
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,768
<i>gave the edge to the gasoline car.</i>

31
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,876
<i>By 1920, the internal combustion
engine had won the race</i>

32
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:13,437
<i>for control of the roads.</i>

33
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:17,080
<i>And the modern automobile age was born.</i>

34
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:29,826
<i>Of the hundreds of millions
of cars built in the 20th century,</i>

35
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,799
<i>almost none were electric.</i>

36
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:36,128
<i>They were sleek.
They were fast.</i>

37
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:39,299
<i>And they gave Americans the open road.</i>

38
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:45,204
<i>But as time went on, their
number one flaw became apparent.</i>

39
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:49,416
<i>Smog.</i>

40
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,693
<i>California has the worst
air quality in the nation.</i>

41
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:06,166
And it impacts some of our
largest population centers.

42
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:09,735
In my district, we have what is
called the "black cloud of death"

43
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:14,299
<i>that hangs over the port areas
and the areas surrounding the ports.</i>

44
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:18,539
We are seeing some
tremendously debilitating effects:

45
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:23,913
asthma rates, cancer rates,
lung development in children,

46
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,920
<i>children not being
allowed to play outside.</i>

47
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,856
<i>In 1989, a study found</i>

48
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:34,624
<i>that one out of four 15 to 25
year-olds in Los Angeles county</i>

49
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:39,031
<i>had severe lung lesions
and chronic respiratory disease.</i>

50
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:43,829
<i>In 1990, there were 41
stage one smog alerts.</i>

51
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,906
<i>No matter what kind of car we drive,</i>

52
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:50,036
<i>every gallon of gas we burn,</i>

53
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:53,980
<i>adds 19 pounds of carbon dioxide to the air.</i>

54
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,350
<i>The more gas we burn,
the more CO2 we create.</i>

55
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:02,646
If you don't do something with
that CO2, if you don't sequester it

56
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:05,418
it's going up into the atmosphere

57
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:07,359
and CO2 is a global warming gas.

58
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,727
<i>I believe the problems of
global warming will be far greater</i>

59
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,167
than the problems of social security

60
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,901
or even the problems of war on terrorism.

61
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:24,379
<i>We've got the equivalent of a nuclear time bomb</i>

62
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:27,142
<i>on our hand,
with global warming.</i>

63
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:30,046
If lung disease from air
pollution is unimportant,

64
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:34,418
if all those things don't count,
we're going to be in bad trouble.

65
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:36,252
<i>And there's a public health crisis.</i>

66
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:38,885
But we have to have incentives
and we have to have alternatives.

67
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,663
<i>Car companies experimented
with alternatives over the years,</i>

68
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:47,133
<i>but none of them ever seem to
make it out of the proving grounds.</i>

69
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:53,168
I remember, I was the chairman of the
board of the Tennessee Valley Authority,

70
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:57,508
and we were promoting the electric
car back in the late 70's.

71
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,107
I had even planned a race

72
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:04,209
from Gatlinburg, Tennessee
to Nashville

73
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:07,050
between Paul Newman
and Robert Redford.

74
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:12,025
And I had it all lined up, and then
I realised that we'd get a lot of national publicity,

75
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,722
but there were no cars in the showrooms.

76
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:21,162
<i>It would take a different kind of race to
make the electric car the car of the future.</i>

77
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:26,297
The Sunraycer was a solar-powered vehicle
that was developed here, at AeroVironment,

78
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:28,939
for the purpose of winning a race.

79
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,413
<i>In 1987, GM won the World Solar
Challenge race in Australia</i>

80
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,112
<i>with a one-of-a-kind solar-powered
electric vehicle, the Sunraycer.</i>

81
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:43,591
<i>Emboldened by their success,
GM C.E.O. Roger Smith</i>

82
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:48,961
<i>challenged the same design team to
build a prototype for a practical electric car.</i>

83
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:52,057
<i>If we were to go full speed
ahead with electric cars</i>

84
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:56,264
the electronics had to be good enough
in order to warrant that concept,

85
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,802
and that's where the work
of Alan Cocconi came in.

86
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:03,503
You've built the prototype
for this in your garage?

87
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:05,570
Yes. Well, my garage
isn't quite the average garage,

88
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:09,482
it's a pretty good machine shop and electronics
lab. But yes, I've built it there.

89
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:13,419
It's like a three-channel stereo amplifier.
It provides the right size sinus waves

90
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:17,323
at right frequency to drive the motor
for all the different driving conditions.

91
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:20,420
So it's a 100 000 watt stereo amplifier.

92
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:24,632
<i>Alan's breakthrough power system
helped create an electric car</i>

93
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,726
<i>unlike any that had
ever been driven before.</i>

94
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:35,733
They've kept this car also a secret,
much better than any Detroit secret

95
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,712
because it was all developed
out here in California.

96
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:41,249
<i>So it truly was a surprise
when it was introduced</i>

97
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:43,046
<i>to Los Angeles auto show.</i>

98
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:46,281
This is going to represent a great step
forward for people in terms of

99
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:50,085
commuting to work,
from work

100
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,094
<i>if you don't have to go more
than 120 miles a day.</i>

101
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:54,729
Other than the jokes that we made

102
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:58,126
about the wisdom of calling a vehicle the Impact

103
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:04,371
it was very impressive, it was very high-tech
and it had an interesting premise

104
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:08,500
that we've got this Corvette
electric-type car,

105
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:12,946
two-seater, slick styling, and that
we can make a business out of it.

106
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,073
It was interesting.

107
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,651
Program manager called me and said:

108
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,847
"Would you like to be on the
electric vehicle program?"

109
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:22,513
<i>"That's fine. What do
you want me to do?"</i>

110
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:26,687
And he said: "Develop demand for
electric vehicles worldwide."

111
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:28,820
I said: "Do you have any instructions?"

112
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:31,832
He took a blank piece of paper,
shoved it in front of me and said:

113
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,098
"No instructions. You go figure it out." At
that point I joined the program.

114
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:40,906
It got a lot of interest
flowing in the industry,

115
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,103
but it did something else.

116
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:47,376
It caught the attention of the
California Air Resources Board.

117
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:50,281
<i>California's Air Resources Board,</i>

118
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:52,442
<i>or CARB as it was known,</i>

119
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:56,958
<i>saw the electric car as an
opportunity to solve another problem.</i>

120
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:59,790
<i>Since GM had already announced</i>

121
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:03,320
<i>that they were going to
produce an electric vehicle</i>

122
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,368
<i>before we even adopted the mandate,</i>

123
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:11,399
the electric vehicle technology
became the technology

124
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:13,373
of greatest promise.

125
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:16,741
<i>Knowing a modern electric
car was now possible,</i>

126
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:20,839
<i>California regulators took a bold
and unprecedented step.</i>

127
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:24,181
<i>They passed the Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate.</i>

128
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:25,843
<i>The mandate was simple.</i>

129
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:30,221
<i>If automakers wanted to
continue to sell cars in California,</i>

130
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:34,418
<i>some of those cars would have
to be vehicles with no exhaust.</i>

131
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:35,963
<i>They've decided to ramp it up.</i>

132
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:39,660
They said 2% in 1998, 5% in 2001

133
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:41,635
and 10% in 2003.

134
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:44,934
<i>For the car companies there
were only two options;</i>

135
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:47,373
<i>Comply with the law or fight it.</i>

136
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:50,568
<i>In the end, they would do both.</i>

137
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:11,690
<i>The electric car is here.</i>

138
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:15,001
The EV1 from General Motors.

139
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:18,232
<i>The Impact prototype became the EV1,</i>

140
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:21,003
<i>the first modern electric
production car</i>

141
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:25,137
<i>from a major US car company
in nearly a century.</i>

142
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,411
<i>GM chose its Saturn division to market
it in California and Arizona.</i>

143
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:33,547
<i>I'd bought my first Saturn at 17,
and they'd said;</i>

144
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:34,953
<i>"Do you want to come work here?"</i>

145
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:37,558
I thought it would be a good college job,

146
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:39,491
I'll put myself through college this way.

147
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:42,654
It turned out I loved the cars
more than what I was studying,

148
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:46,633
<i>and three years later they announced
the EV1 program and I jumped on it.</i>

149
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:51,937
<i>There were the 13 of us, most of
whom were mid-twenties, unattached,</i>

150
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:55,966
single, no kids - willing to do
anything for a little money.

151
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:00,541
<i>We all handled a particular
geographic region.</i>

152
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,243
Mine started as Los Angeles,

153
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:06,913
and I've worked with everybody:
from engineers and students to celebrities.

154
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:10,618
<i>I say, I say, I say Alexandra !</i>

155
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,182
I have a picture of myself...

156
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,022
just hearing the Saturn song...
Just being so happy!

157
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:19,466
I had one of those early EV1's,
and I used it here in the capital.

158
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:21,132
I love the car.

159
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:25,030
<i>It's everything Americans want in a car.</i>

160
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:29,611
They're cool, fast, sexy.
I got in the car and felt like...

161
00:11:33,615 --> 00:11:38,245
It was fairly reasonably priced.
It was between 250 $ and 500 $ a month.

162
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:41,750
I haven't tried accelerating too much,
because there is too many cops around.

163
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,291
I'm afraid I'll get a ticket,
I'll be too excited.

164
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:46,685
<i>Believe it or not, that sucker goes.</i>

165
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:49,890
It will take you down the Pacific Coast
Highway so fast you could get a ticket.

166
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:57,499
<i>I did kind of feel like Batman...</i>

167
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:01,374
And the way it takes
off out of the cave.

168
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,570
You know, I have this gate that opens...

169
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:08,311
<i>You'd get inside,
and the console was really near you,</i>

170
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:10,851
and the lighting is beautiful.

171
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,714
It was quiet.

172
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:22,423
The car was so fast it looked like it
would outrun its own shadow.

173
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,596
It's an awesome car to drive.

174
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,330
It was the crust of a wave that
we'd thought was coming in.

175
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:35,376
It was going to change the
way everybody travels.

176
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:40,504
<i>Other car companies began to comply,
often with conversions of gas cars</i>

177
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:44,207
<i>but with many of the same
advantages of the EV1.</i>

178
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:54,393
I'm not mechanical at all but I love dealing
wih my electric car, because it's so easy.

179
00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:59,298
I plug it in at night and when
I need to drive it I unplug

180
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,396
<i>and drive it away.</i>

181
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,267
They're for people who
love the environment.

182
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:05,329
I said they're for people who love cars.

183
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,965
They're for people who have to go somewhere.

184
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:08,133
<i>This is amazing.</i>

185
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,770
What you do with this electric car is,
you put the key in,

186
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,742
- and you turn it.
- Wow.

187
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,850
And there's this thing on
the floor called the pedal.

188
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:19,011
The exciting thing about this is
that the cost of operating a car

189
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:22,682
<i>is the same as if you're
driving a typical gasoline car.</i>

190
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:25,486
<i>But the gasoline only
costs 60 cents a gallon.</i>

191
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,690
Going to the gas station is a hassle,
believe it or not. Plugging a car in is not.

192
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:34,495
The battery, that you charge at home,
gets between 70 and 80 miles per charge,

193
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:38,300
which for me is more than all the driving that I
need to do in the course of a day.

194
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:42,104
<i>People started seeing
the cars on the road</i>

195
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:44,475
<i>and getting a better
understanding of what they could do.</i>

196
00:13:44,546 --> 00:13:46,275
<i>Friends and neighbors
and relatives are saying;</i>

197
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:49,374
"Hey, that's a neat idea.
I should get one of those."

198
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:52,351
And we started seeing the
momentum building for this,

199
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:55,822
<i>and the waiting lists
being created for these cars.</i>

200
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,321
- Cut two.
- Cut two.

201
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:03,296
I go online to look for other Toyota
RAV4's and I see Toyota RAV4 EV.

202
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:08,097
And wow!
My whole world opened up.

203
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,569
It's this electric vehicle.

204
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:12,940
It goes 100 miles to a
charge, blablabla...

205
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:17,104
I was like
"I didn't know this existed."

206
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:20,271
"How come I don't know about this?
Have you seen this on tv?"

207
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:22,841
When I first tried to buy the Honda EV Plus,

208
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:26,715
I drove in it and said:
"Hey, this is a great car."

209
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:30,591
The person who was trying to
sell it to us was dumbfounded.

210
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:33,594
He didn't know what to do.
He'd never leased one before.

211
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:37,063
Didn't know how to do it,
and it took me six weeks of negotiations

212
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,498
before I was able to get
the car from their hands.

213
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:43,729
There's nothing like driving a car
where you realise, as you sit in the traffic

214
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:46,137
<i>there's no pollution
coming out of your tailpipe.</i>

215
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,574
<i>It's just the battery sound.</i>

216
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:52,308
<i>By driving an electric car,
what are you sparing us from?</i>

217
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:54,144
I'm saving America Dave,
that's what I'm doing.

218
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:57,947
I am saving America
by driving an electric car.

219
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:02,883
<i>Not everyone was sure that
electric cars would save Ameica.</i>

220
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:08,085
<i>Even as GM rolled out its first
batch of EV1's, there were skeptics.</i>

221
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:12,323
Consumer acceptance and understanding
has been a key issue in all of this.

222
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:17,604
And what we discovered is that people
are very cautious about the electric car.

223
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:20,266
I would consider it, but I
haven't done enough research,

224
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:25,279
I don't know if they're going to
be strong, big and dependable.

225
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:27,338
I have to know where do
I have to go to recharge it,

226
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,646
what do I have to do for the battery...

227
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:35,179
People don't want a mini, tiny car
that has 15 inch wheels.

228
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:39,327
How's he gonna fix that up and
go around town and parade it?

229
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:43,854
<i>While some consumers expressed
skepticism about electric cars,</i>

230
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,594
<i>California was pressured
to drop the mandate.</i>

231
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:50,661
<i>A group called "Californians
against utility company abuse"</i>

232
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:54,368
<i>fought a small utility
surcharge to build charging stations.</i>

233
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:57,139
They would go to local city
council meetings and say:

234
00:15:57,212 --> 00:15:59,840
"You don't want to put an electric
vehicle charging station there.

235
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,042
<i>"That's a waste of taxpayer money."</i>

236
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,351
<i>They had this list of supporters.</i>

237
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:07,013
Companies like Trader Joe's,
and others for which you'd say

238
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:08,919
"Why would they
support something like this?"

239
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:11,389
So the EV drivers got together
and started writing letters

240
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,826
to some of these people that
were listed on their web site.

241
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:17,387
as being supporters, and said
"Do you realise what you're supporting here?"

242
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:20,264
And they got all these names
removed from the list.

243
00:16:20,402 --> 00:16:23,098
<i>Further investigation
revealed that these groups</i>

244
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:26,265
<i>were consumer
organizations in name only</i>

245
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:29,844
<i>funded almost
exclusively by the oil industry.</i>

246
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:36,648
<i>Oil companies also paid for
editorials in national publications.</i>

247
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:42,220
<i>They even argued that the
environmental benefits of EV's were dubious.</i>

248
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,649
With electric vehicles we're going
to have this shift of energy away from oil.

249
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,555
And if we shift it to coal,

250
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:52,623
there are some environmental
problems that are just very disconcerting.

251
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:57,532
<i>Right now, in the United States,
we're 55 percent coal.</i>

252
00:16:57,606 --> 00:17:00,097
If you run the numbers with
standard coal power plants,

253
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,937
you don't end up with a better
environmental performance,

254
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:04,069
but with a longer tailpipe.

255
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:06,340
There have been numerous studies conducted

256
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:08,575
by the California Energy Commission,

257
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,212
that clearly show that electric
drive is substantially more efficient

258
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:18,282
and less polluting, even if you get
your electricity from coal plants.

259
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:22,395
<i>But the arguments against
electrics didn't stop there.</i>

260
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:25,364
They even made the
ridiculous argument

261
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:28,493
that there was an environmental
justice issue involved,

262
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,904
because they said only rich
people could buy electric cars.

263
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:38,202
<i>Well, the air doesn't know a boundary
between Brentwood and south L.A.</i>

264
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:41,874
<i>Car companies began to argue
that the mandate was too strict.</i>

265
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:44,542
We had to help with the regulations.

266
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:46,951
The regulatory people knew
nothing about this stuff,

267
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:53,621
and we began to get the eerie feeling
that we were going over a cliff.

268
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:57,296
It wasn't going to be possible.

269
00:17:57,465 --> 00:18:00,992
California was faced with the
prospect of "What do you do

270
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:03,534
"...if the car companies don't comply?"

271
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:07,464
So rather than do brinksmanship

272
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:11,137
about what would happen
if they didn't comply and stick with it,

273
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:13,339
they started negotiating,

274
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:18,108
a certain flexibility in the mandate.

275
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:21,785
<i>California compromised
with the automakers</i>

276
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:24,051
<i>adopting a memorandum of agreement.</i>

277
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,628
One of the agreements with the state
was that the automakers would build

278
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:32,724
<i>and market electric vehicles
in accordance with demand.</i>

279
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,792
<i>If they didn't want to build more of them,</i>

280
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:39,033
<i>the car companies would have to make
the case that there was no demand.</i>

281
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:40,797
The person will go unnamed,

282
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:45,869
but we were having a lunch in the executive
dining room at the GM tech center one day.

283
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:48,916
Just the two of us,
and he leans over to me and says:

284
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:52,249
"Dabels, you know something?
You are my worst enemy."

285
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:55,015
I asked why, and he said:

286
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,686
"I'm out there lobbying to show that
there's no demand for electric vehicles,

287
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,854
"and you're out there proving me wrong."

288
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,232
We would sit down with Hal Riney
or with executives from GM and discuss

289
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,997
how fast, how far, how much.
These were the three questions we were getting.

290
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,732
"Please put it in the advertising.
It's not rocket science."

291
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:14,001
And they would go back
and do the exact opposite.

292
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:17,142
We never saw a tv ad

293
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:20,204
with an electric car scampering
up the side of a hill

294
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:23,079
with a good looking man or
woman draped around it.

295
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:25,085
That's the way they sell cars.

296
00:19:33,428 --> 00:19:35,658
<i>How does it go without gas and air?</i>

297
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:40,726
<i>How does it go without
sparks and explosions?</i>

298
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:45,027
<i>How does it go without
gears or transmissions?</i>

299
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:48,802
<i>How does it go, you ask yourself?</i>

300
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:54,040
<i>And then, you will ask;</i>

301
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:57,551
<i>How did we go so long without it?</i>

302
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,811
<i>The electric car.</i>

303
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:01,889
<i>It isn't coming,</i>

304
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:04,924
<i>it's here.</i>

305
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:13,257
<i>What was the objective
of these advertisements?</i>

306
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:17,028
<i>Was it to entice consumers
or to scare them away?</i>

307
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:21,403
Our goal at GM was to make the full
functioning, battery electric vehicle

308
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:24,570
a commercially viable business
opportunity for General Motors.

309
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:29,674
<i>GM spokesman, Dave Barthmuss,
has worked for GM for nearly ten years.</i>

310
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:34,252
We spent in excess of one billion
dollars to drive this market.

311
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:37,485
That means award-winning
advertising, developing the vehicle,

312
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,460
developing the recharging infrastructure.

313
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:44,487
In a four-year timeframe,
from roughly 1996 to 2000,

314
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:46,761
we were able to lease 800 EV1's.

315
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:49,837
We started this waiting list
in order to prove demand to GM,

316
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:52,737
but no matter how many
people we got on that list,

317
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:56,610
that was never considered enough demand.
Everything was anecdotal to GM.

318
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:58,872
We have heard about
these long waiting lists,

319
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:01,916
and frankly, we did have a
list of roughly 4000 people

320
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:05,146
that raised their hands and said:
"I would be interested in getting a new EV1

321
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,710
"and being an EV1 lessee."

322
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:10,246
We contacted each of those folks
and we riddled that list down.

323
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:12,589
And when we got down to
a point when we were able to have

324
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,457
somebody sign on the dotted line,

325
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:17,555
that list from 4000 people
shrunk to about 50.

326
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:22,963
<i>Only recently did they finally
admit there actually was a waiting list</i>

327
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,367
<i>and tried to explain
it in the way of;</i>

328
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,706
"By the time we explained all the limitations
of the car to them only 50 would sign up."

329
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:31,937
If you sincerely want to
market a product,

330
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:35,414
you don't start out by describing
the limitations of the product.

331
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:39,184
<i>Tom Everhart is president
emeritus at Caltech.</i>

332
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:42,923
<i>He served on GM's board
of directors for 13 years.</i>

333
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,521
I do not think General Motors tried hard

334
00:21:46,928 --> 00:21:49,521
to get the electric cars out rapidly.

335
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:54,295
Whether the C.E.O. of General Motors
understood that, I don't know.

336
00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:57,530
We had to ask permission of
who everyone to give a car to,

337
00:21:57,605 --> 00:22:01,905
and by the end we were low on cars,
we had to write case statements.

338
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,540
<i>We tried to put the cars
in hands of celebrities,</i>

339
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:08,571
because they were the only ones
that stood a chance of getting the car.

340
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,118
The 3rd grade science teacher
didn't stand a chance.

341
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:14,981
<i>I had to write a resume for Mel Gibson,
and what he'd done and accomplished,</i>

342
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:18,583
because the people I was talking to
didn't believe that he warranted a car.

343
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,990
I was wondering: "Why do I
have to fill this out?"

344
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:23,360
You had to tell them where
your birthmarks were.

345
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:25,524
I mean it was everything.

346
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:29,233
"Have you recently had
a proctoscope inserted into your..."

347
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:30,999
"Well, no."

348
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:35,474
You had to get really specific
about a whole bunch of things.

349
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,746
Consumers wanted it, but they
regarded it as a limited vehicle

350
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:42,647
and they expected to
pay a limited price for it.

351
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:46,551
And there's nothing irrational about
the consumer that said that to us.

352
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,949
That's a perfectly
reasonable statement.

353
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:52,882
"You're giving me a vehicle that
does less, I wanna pay less."

354
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,020
Okay.

355
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:58,095
But unfortunately, I
couldn't make it for less.

356
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,166
They argue things like money and that
they're too expensive to build,

357
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:05,195
yet they're building four a day.
They were very hand built cars,

358
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:06,934
<i>with specialized components.</i>

359
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:10,033
And had they mass-marketed them,
they of course would have come down.

360
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:14,474
<i>As car companies made the
case there was no demand</i>

361
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:18,246
<i>electric vehicle advocates thought
they had a sympathetic ear</i>

362
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,278
<i>with the appointment of environmental
scientist, doctor Alan Lloyd</i>

363
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:25,758
<i>as chairman of the California Air Resources Board.</i>

364
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:29,024
First time I presided over that,

365
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:32,999
I felt that the car companies
weren't making significant effort,

366
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:37,868
so i felt: "Flog them harder.
Flog them often. They need to do better."

367
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:42,136
For the regulation - we felt it needed
to be changed drastically.

368
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:46,969
And there was some movement that way,
but it didn't go away.

369
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:50,176
<i>While the car companies
fought the mandate in Sacramento,</i>

370
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:54,119
<i>GM quietly closed its EV1 assembly line</i>

371
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:56,656
<i>and began laying off its sales force.</i>

372
00:23:56,724 --> 00:24:00,717
<i>All of a sudden, we were not only taken
off the project, but taken out of the company.</i>

373
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:02,921
They started with the
ones with the most...

374
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:05,427
the biggest waiting lists,
and the most customers.

375
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,628
The primary areas were
the ones that they dismantled first.

376
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:10,933
And so, at the end of 2001,

377
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:13,166
that was it in terms of my
employment with General Motors.

378
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:15,801
Studying general Motors
practices over the years,

379
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:18,775
and I don't speak for
the engineers and scientists

380
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:22,475
who would really have liked to have done
a better job with motor vehicle technology,

381
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,713
but the executives at the top,
their motto seemed to have been:

382
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:27,880
"Going backwards into the future."

383
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:30,891
And that's what they've
been doing for decades.

384
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:35,896
<i>As a veteran consumer advocate,
Ralph Nader used grassroots campaigns</i>

385
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:38,660
<i>to make cars safer
and more fuel efficient.</i>

386
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:43,427
<i>He's familiar with the tactics used
by the car industry to resist change.</i>

387
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:47,474
<i>There are all kinds of ways to take
and bring politicians to their knees.</i>

388
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:50,306
Once the car companies
get a long delay time,

389
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:53,176
then they go to work,
eroding, eroding.

390
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:55,875
And than when the deadline is
approaching they say they can't do it

391
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,316
and there are going to
be terrible consequences.

392
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:01,348
<i>Automakers took
the fight to a new level.</i>

393
00:25:01,756 --> 00:25:05,157
<i>They sued
California's Air Resources Board.</i>

394
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,965
<i>GM led the lawsuit, soon joined
by Chrysler and several auto dealerships.</i>

395
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,362
<i>As California withered
under the pressure,</i>

396
00:25:15,436 --> 00:25:17,666
<i>the carmakers
found a powerful new ally,</i>

397
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:21,134
<i>the federal government.</i>

398
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:24,301
<i>Shortly after joining the suit,</i>

399
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,212
<i>the Bush administration
made another announcement.</i>

400
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:30,773
<i>Tonight, I'm proposing 1.2 billion
dollars in research funding</i>

401
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:33,250
<i>so that America can</i>

402
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:37,485
<i>lead the world in developing clean,
hydrogen-powered automobiles.</i>

403
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:43,760
<i>The federal government joined
the car and oil industries</i>

404
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:47,164
<i>to embrace a new
clean car of the future.</i>

405
00:25:47,335 --> 00:25:50,361
<i>With more than a billion
federal dollars up for grabs,</i>

406
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:55,265
<i>over the next few years,
the campaign for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles</i>

407
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:57,470
<i>began to sway California.</i>

408
00:25:57,712 --> 00:26:00,772
<i>Hello there and welcome
to the California Fuel Cell Partnership</i>

409
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:05,444
<i>where we're fuelling the future in
a new and enviromentally friendly way.</i>

410
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:08,344
<i>Automakers, energy
and technology providers,</i>

411
00:26:08,423 --> 00:26:12,382
<i>along with government agencies
are voluntarily working together</i>

412
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:15,826
<i>to commercialize the
fuel cell for cars and buses.</i>

413
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:17,955
<i>Soon you may see some of these cars</i>

414
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,296
<i>cruising through your
very own neighborhood.</i>

415
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:23,235
<i>We will not just dream about
the hydrogen fuelling stations.</i>

416
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:27,066
<i>We will not just dream about the
hydrogen cars. We will build it.</i>

417
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:31,475
The hydrogen Hummer is not a production
vehicle, it's a concept vehicle.

418
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:35,170
<i>It's a way for governor
Schwarzenegger to have a property</i>

419
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:37,410
<i>at various events that ge
goes to when he unveils</i>

420
00:26:37,485 --> 00:26:41,114
a new hydrogen refuelling station.
At LAX for example.

421
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:44,922
<i>I am going to encourage the
building of a hydrogen highway</i>

422
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:47,586
<i>to take us to the
environmental future.</i>

423
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:52,688
<i>While hydrogen fuel cells offered an exciting
alternative sometime in the future</i>

424
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:56,132
<i>what would happen to
the technology of today?</i>

425
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,795
<i>What would happen to the electric car?</i>

426
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:04,270
<i>It all came down to a decisive meeting
at California's Air Resources Board.</i>

427
00:27:04,545 --> 00:27:07,378
<i>Citizens and industry alike</i>

428
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:11,111
<i>testified as CARB prepared to
vote on the fate of the electric car.</i>

429
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:14,245
<i>I'd also like to thank
all the other stakeholders,</i>

430
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:17,450
<i>particularly also,
the auto industry</i>

431
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:20,551
<i>who is going to have a major impact here.</i>

432
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:24,422
<i>I like the fact that
hydrogen might be in a position</i>

433
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:28,435
<i>to displace the petroleum products.</i>

434
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:31,733
<i>I share your optimism on fuel cells,
just not to the extent.</i>

435
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:36,243
<i>I think it's a bait and switch
strategy. I hope I'm wrong.</i>

436
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:41,910
<i>I'm concerned that we've picked numbers
that are based entirely on fuel cells.</i>

437
00:27:43,084 --> 00:27:44,745
<i>What if fuel cells don't work?</i>

438
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:50,614
<i>It seems that most of the
recent changes to the mandate</i>

439
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:52,886
<i>have been designed to ease
the burden on the automakers.</i>

440
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
<i>You're part of the
environmental protection agency,</i>

441
00:27:55,596 --> 00:27:58,121
<i>not the corporate profit protection agency.</i>

442
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,492
<i>I think that we've been a
contributor to this marketplace to...</i>

443
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:04,732
<i>I agree. But remember
there are many of you.</i>

444
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:07,865
<i>We're not giving more time
to the auto manufacturers.</i>

445
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:12,977
Lou Browning had the job
to present the report,

446
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:15,038
<i>and he'd been promised ten minutes.</i>

447
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,279
<i>- One of the things we've found is...
- Dr Browning,</i>

448
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:20,047
<i>I would appreciate if you could
summarize this in three minutes.</i>

449
00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:22,089
<i>Okay, I thought I had ten, but...</i>

450
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,286
Alan Lloyd cut him off,
whereas he had given the automakers

451
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,658
unlimited time earlier in the day.

452
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:33,489
<i>The improvements we need in
fuel cells are mainly to get the cost down.</i>

453
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:38,366
<i>In addition, we have recently certified and
introduced the Honda FCX fuel cell vehicle.</i>

454
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:43,375
<i>Largely this work has been pushed forward
through the California Fuel Cell Partnership</i>

455
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:46,242
<i>which has been very valuable in
pulling together the diverse interests.</i>

456
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,610
Any new information on
batteries that didn't mesh

457
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:55,622
with overall conclusions was just
shut out very fast by Alan Lloyd.

458
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,421
<i>Let's get it clear. I'm not trying
to show any bias or anything here.</i>

459
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:02,527
There were 80 people who came
to speak for electric cars,

460
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:07,034
and only two industry representatives
on the side to kill the mandate.

461
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:11,569
<i>We have four people out of 78</i>

462
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:14,399
<i>who are supporting this proposal.</i>

463
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,672
<i>How did we end up with this?</i>

464
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:21,238
<i>This is a tough, tough program.
It's a revolutionary program.</i>

465
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:23,749
<i>It pushes the automakers hard.</i>

466
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:25,979
<i>And they don't like it,
and they push back hard.</i>

467
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:29,022
<i>As you deliberate today
on the fate of this program,</i>

468
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,927
<i>I urge you to summon
all of your political courage</i>

469
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:37,624
<i>to make the hard choices that you
know you need to make on this program.</i>

470
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:41,532
<i>Because when it comes to protecting
the health of the people of California,</i>

471
00:29:41,602 --> 00:29:44,435
<i>there are simply no more
easy choices to make.</i>

472
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:08,257
I saw this as losing
a wonderful opportunity

473
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:13,096
that we have really invested a great
deal in the infrastructure, in the technology...

474
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:15,034
It was like the rug was pulled out.

475
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:19,004
They gave it away.
And to me that is just sad.

476
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:23,500
It's a sad commentary on
the way our society

477
00:30:23,577 --> 00:30:26,671
and our system in the United States works.

478
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:29,112
When GM introduced the EV1,

479
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:32,619
California was setting the toughest auto
pollution standards in the nation.

480
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:37,952
10% of all cars sold here this year
were to be zero emission vehicles.

481
00:30:38,092 --> 00:30:42,296
But California dropped those standards
after being sued by automakers.

482
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:46,130
A lot of the vehicles, the Honda vehicles,
the General Motors vehicles,

483
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:49,327
were all leased, and
nobody had the option to buy.

484
00:30:49,403 --> 00:30:54,204
<i>So the automakers took advantage of
that and pulled all the cars off the road.</i>

485
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:57,005
They weren't willing to
let people take the cars

486
00:30:57,078 --> 00:30:59,876
and actually drive them and
keep driving them like normal cars.

487
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:03,041
When I noticed that GM was losing interest

488
00:31:03,117 --> 00:31:07,451
was when I wanted to re-lease
my car, and they wouldn't let me.

489
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:11,355
I've never had a product
I've had to beg and fight

490
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,523
and cajole and persist so much to get.

491
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:21,232
And then I had to try and beg and fight

492
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:24,032
and find any way
possible to try and keep.

493
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:27,334
- They didn't give you the option...
- They didn't give you an option to buy.

494
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:31,071
They said: "Thank you for leasing the car.
Goodbye. That's it."

495
00:31:31,145 --> 00:31:34,046
"Turn it in by such and such a date,
or you're going to be held liable."

496
00:31:34,115 --> 00:31:39,519
<i>GM had very quietly gone about taking
cars back, without anybody saying very much</i>

497
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:41,077
<i>other than some of the drivers</i>

498
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:43,146
<i>that complained
having their cars taken away</i>

499
00:31:43,224 --> 00:31:45,124
<i>but never in a big, organized fashion.</i>

500
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:46,989
They had no choice but to turn them in

501
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:51,521
or face legal consequences of stealing a car.

502
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:55,668
<i>To my knowledge all the cars were
turned in because people had too much to lose.</i>

503
00:31:55,736 --> 00:31:59,797
To this day, the automakers
have fought anyone understanding

504
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:02,468
how much demand there was,
and how much demand that there is.

505
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:05,307
So we decided we were going to fight them

506
00:32:05,513 --> 00:32:09,074
in whatever way we could,
and we became organized.

507
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:13,920
<i>Across California drivers held
protests to save electric cars.</i>

508
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:16,923
<i>"...it turned my head around
about electric cars."</i>

509
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:19,687
<i>"And it broke me of my addiction to oil. "</i>

510
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,047
<i>Unable to change policy,</i>

511
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:51,819
<i>activists staged a funeral
to raise public awareness.</i>

512
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:56,385
<i>It was the same month as
the first stage 1 smog alert</i>

513
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:59,433
<i>in southern California in five years.</i>

514
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:05,035
I was an EV1 driver, still am, from
1998 until December of this year,

515
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:09,773
when GM will have to pry it
out of my charger's dead cold hands.

516
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:14,244
What the detractors and the critics of
electric vehicles have been saying for years

517
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:19,146
is true. The electric vehicle
is not for everybody.

518
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,221
Given the limited range, it can only meet
the needs of 90% of the population.

519
00:33:29,096 --> 00:33:31,155
People used to ask me:
"Why do you do what you do?"

520
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:34,030
And I say, especially
after my son had told them:

521
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:36,362
"I figure if I do my job well enough,

522
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:40,305
"my son will never know a time before
there were electric cars on the road."

523
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:44,376
And he rode in an EV1 on the
way over here, and he said:

524
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:47,346
"I wish we could keep the EV1 for a long time."

525
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:49,574
And all I could say was: "Me too."

526
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,885
<i>By the summer of 2004,</i>

527
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:05,898
<i>there was only a single EV1 left in
private hands in southern California.</i>

528
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:08,992
<i>Today is D-day. Today is the end.</i>

529
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:13,234
<i>GM did do it right.
They did create a great, great car.</i>

530
00:34:13,307 --> 00:34:17,471
<i>It's well engineered, it's well designed,
and it's enjoyable to drive.</i>

531
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:22,949
I've never seen a company be so
canniballistic about its own product before.

532
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:26,445
It's such an odd experience.

533
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:44,026
What makes that car go?

534
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:48,702
- We press this button.

535
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,608
It's an electric car like daddy's.

536
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,581
Hey, you got here just in time.

537
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:57,981
I know. I see that.

538
00:34:58,619 --> 00:34:59,984
It's so sad.

539
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:05,823
This is the EV specialist I was talking
about, who gave me her car.

540
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:08,794
It's really sad, heartbroken.
Are you kidding me?

541
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:11,488
They are my babies, every one of them.

542
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:22,702
A lot of human potential just drove off.

543
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,944
- The fight continues.
- It does.

544
00:35:37,424 --> 00:35:40,052
<i>With no more electric cars on the road,</i>

545
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:44,393
<i>General Motors now had
possession of their entire EV1 fleet.</i>

546
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:46,829
<i>Pourquoi vouloir toutes les récupérer ?</i>

547
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,334
<i>Why did they want them back?
What were they going to do with these cars?</i>

548
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:53,464
We have discovered 78 EV1's
parked in the back parking lot

549
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,839
<i>of a facility that GM owns in Burbank.</i>

550
00:35:57,378 --> 00:36:01,178
Taking off the cars that were
on the road, that were running fine...

551
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:04,684
Just let those people drive those
cars until they can't drive them anymore.

552
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:13,819
- Where are you guys from?
- We're members of the EV1 club,

553
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:16,761
and we want to come
and take a look at our cars.

554
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,798
I know they are being mothballed here.

555
00:36:18,866 --> 00:36:22,563
I have no authorization for you guys to
come back there and look at the cars.

556
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:24,934
- Can we just go and...
- No.

557
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:28,202
<i>There were no clues as to
where the cars were going,</i>

558
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:30,971
<i>until a rumor surfaced on the Internet.</i>

559
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:35,579
We had the understanding,
through back channels

560
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:39,915
that these vehicles were about to be
taken to the Arizona proving grounds.

561
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:43,514
<i>Many EV1's had apparently
been trucked out of state</i>

562
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,458
<i>to GM's vast proving
grounds in Mesa, Arizona.</i>

563
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:50,895
...so large, it has the track denoted on it...

564
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,690
<i>The location was off-limits to the public,</i>

565
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:57,259
<i>and there was no way of knowing
where the EV1's might be.</i>

566
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:06,168
<i>We're flying over GM.</i>

567
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:15,779
<i>There they are.</i>

568
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:18,289
<i>Wow.</i>

569
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:24,257
<i>We flew over General Motors,</i>

570
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:28,028
<i>and looking down, we could see,
right next to the racetrack</i>

571
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:31,435
<i>where the EV1 was
first tested, we saw</i>

572
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:34,303
<i>I don't know, maybe 50 EV1's crushed</i>

573
00:37:34,374 --> 00:37:38,276
<i>and put on top of semi-flatbeds,
right next to the yellow crusher.</i>

574
00:37:39,613 --> 00:37:42,309
<i>General Motors is
almost finished off i think.</i>

575
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,951
<i>I imagine there isn't many EV1's
left that haven't been crushed out.</i>

576
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:48,978
<i>It's pretty sad.</i>

577
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:58,126
<i>There are one of four
things that will happen with the EV1's.</i>

578
00:37:58,198 --> 00:38:01,133
They'll go to colleges and
universities, to engineering schools.

579
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:04,261
<i>They'll go to museums and
other displays across the country.</i>

580
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:07,637
Other EV1 vehicles are
being driven by our engineers.

581
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:11,166
And the other option for the EV1's
at the end of their life is recycling.

582
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:14,806
<i>But know that ever part of
the EV1 is going to be recycled,</i>

583
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:18,249
dismantled through a third party and then
reused. Everything is going to be recycled.

584
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:21,287
We're not just going to go crush
it and then send it off to a landfill.

585
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:31,155
When I saw the picture
of the pile of pressed cars,

586
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:35,395
it hurt. I thought it
was pretty spiteful.

587
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:40,867
To see on the computer,
on the Internet,

588
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:44,034
the crushed EV1's that GM did...

589
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:47,774
- It was wrong.
- Tragic. That was tragic.

590
00:38:47,848 --> 00:38:51,545
<i>But more wrong is the reasons for it.</i>

591
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:56,419
"What do we do now?"

592
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,186
At the time that most of this
was going on, no one had any idea

593
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:01,693
that every automaker
was going to jump ship.

594
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,899
<i>More internet tips
revealed that the EV1's</i>

595
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:09,231
<i>were not the only
electric vehicles in jeopardy.</i>

596
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:12,270
<i>A number of Ford Th!nks
and Ranger electric trucks</i>

597
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:16,833
<i>were discovered in Palm Springs,
and rumored to be set for destruction.</i>

598
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:23,149
<i>In Los Angeles, activists spotted
a truckload of Toyota RAV4 EV's.</i>

599
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:27,214
<i>Fearing the destination was
a crushing facility, they chased it.</i>

600
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:29,585
<i>The next morning the truck turned back.</i>

601
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,524
<i>That guy was going as fast as he
possibly could in a big transporter like that,</i>

602
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:36,526
<i>trying to lose us, it was clear.</i>

603
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,789
but wasn't able to do it and, of
course, that did change Toyota's plans.

604
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:44,831
<i>It was so inconsistent,
they didn't know what the hell to do.</i>

605
00:39:46,573 --> 00:39:50,942
Then he goes to the end of the pier,
and these two big security guards come out,

606
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:53,146
<i>they open this locked gate,</i>

607
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:57,343
<i>the truck goes inside, and then the
security guards come out and survey us.</i>

608
00:39:58,485 --> 00:40:01,283
<i>Somehow we ended up
at this god forsaken place.</i>

609
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:02,413
She has everything.

610
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:06,391
It has spewing smoke into the
harbor that kids have to breathe.

611
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,952
<i>It has an oil well, and it has
Toyota, which is supposed</i>

612
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,989
<i>to be the greenest car company,
but which is simultaneously crushing</i>

613
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:18,003
and hiding the fact that they're
crushing, clean RAV4 EV's,

614
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:20,904
<i>instead of selling
them to willing customers.</i>

615
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:25,644
<i>No one had seen Honda's electric car
since they were taken from customers.</i>

616
00:40:26,313 --> 00:40:30,147
<i>Then, an episode of
"California's Green" aired on PBS.</i>

617
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:35,084
So we're going to be able
to see cars shredded today.

618
00:40:35,155 --> 00:40:36,179
Absolutely.

619
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:38,622
Which is not something
most of us get to see.

620
00:40:38,692 --> 00:40:42,924
We shred the car, about a car a minute,
1000 cars a day on a good day.

621
00:40:42,996 --> 00:40:47,399
And what's interesting, the first thing
we noticed when we drove up here,

622
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:50,129
you're going to be shredding
some new cars, too.

623
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:54,264
These look like perfectly good cars.
Why are you shredding them up?

624
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:57,708
A little bit of a mystery really,
since I've been here last eight years.

625
00:40:57,778 --> 00:41:00,303
They bring us these cars
from the dealerships,

626
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,041
and they say that they're test cars.

627
00:41:02,115 --> 00:41:04,879
And they've been brought
over to test various emissions

628
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:06,977
and the insurance
companies won't reinsure them

629
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:08,954
so they have to watch
them destroyed here.

630
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:13,789
Boy, that seems like a shame. I'd like
to drive off in one of these things.

631
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:20,029
Ladies and gentlemen, that's the
sound of a crushed automobile

632
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,331
being shredded into a million pieces.

633
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:40,114
There's no precedent for a
car company rounding up

634
00:41:40,187 --> 00:41:42,018
every one of a particular kind of car

635
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:44,853
and crushing them, as if they're
afraid one might get away.

636
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:47,525
I think they wanted to be sure

637
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:50,324
that none of them were driving
around the streets any more

638
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:54,595
to remind people that there
is such a thing as an electric car.

639
00:41:54,735 --> 00:41:56,794
<i>People keep making
all these analogies,</i>

640
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,499
"Crushing the EV is a
betrayal of the American dream."

641
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:02,667
But it's not a dream.
It's here now!

642
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:07,476
It may be a betrayal of my dream,
but it's a betrayal of the American reality.

643
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:11,684
<i>After the discovery of the
crushed EV1's in Arizona,</i>

644
00:42:11,752 --> 00:42:14,084
<i>electric car drivers took action.</i>

645
00:42:14,154 --> 00:42:17,317
<i>They vowed to keep watch
over the remaining EV1's</i>

646
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:20,622
<i>being stored at the GM
facility in Burbank.</i>

647
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:23,686
There are about 70 cars left in California.

648
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:28,463
They're in the parking lot behind me,
and they have plans to crush those as well.

649
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:35,168
And we need to make a call to action
on General Motors to give them back.

650
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:37,469
We ended up rallying enough troops

651
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:40,445
in terms of interest and
organizations to join our coalition

652
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:45,349
<i>and then we simply didn't leave,
and stayed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</i>

653
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:50,482
It's 6 A.M., and I've been here
for an hour, part of a vigil.

654
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:54,887
We're making sure that GM doesn't
sneak out their cars in the back lot.

655
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:58,754
The first two weeks we
were pretty much ignored.

656
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:00,265
<i>It was like monsoon rains,</i>

657
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,927
<i>it was kind of depressing
to be out there,</i>

658
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:05,267
<i>but at the same time there
was such a sense of mission.</i>

659
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:08,501
I was here this morning
from about 5:45 A.M.,

660
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:11,202
and it's pretty quiet.

661
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:16,607
Finally, on day 15, we did this
announcement of this offer.

662
00:43:16,817 --> 00:43:21,049
<i>As the EV activists recorded the
VIN numbers of the cars in storage,</i>

663
00:43:21,254 --> 00:43:25,452
<i>Chelsea led a last ditch
effort to buy the cars from GM.</i>

664
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:29,295
<i>"Okay, General Motors contends
that no one wants these EV1's here."</i>

665
00:43:29,362 --> 00:43:32,627
<i>"Would anybody be willing to buy them
for the residual price of the lease?"</i>

666
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:36,328
<i>And within 48 hours,
over 80 people had signed up.</i>

667
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,233
There were only 78 cars in that lot,

668
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:41,672
and already we had a waiting list
for a car that wasn't available.

669
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:44,005
It was a tremendous déjà vu moment.

670
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:47,774
<i>At this point we thought
it would be appropriate</i>

671
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:51,682
<i>to some full circle.
Join me in holding this check</i>

672
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:55,585
<i>offering 1.9 million
dollars to General Motors</i>

673
00:43:55,655 --> 00:43:58,484
<i>to put these cars back on the road.</i>

674
00:44:01,695 --> 00:44:04,721
<i>Despite the offer,
GM did not respond.</i>

675
00:44:05,899 --> 00:44:09,630
<i>The fate of the last
78 EV1's remained in doubt</i>

676
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:13,838
<i>A small group of activists
would continue their vigil,</i>

677
00:44:13,907 --> 00:44:16,467
<i>to keep the dream
of the electric car alive.</i>

678
00:44:19,346 --> 00:44:21,041
Who controls the future?

679
00:44:23,884 --> 00:44:28,446
Whoever has the biggest club.
In more ways than one.

680
00:44:29,422 --> 00:44:31,413
One they can bash you with,
and one they can belong to.

681
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:35,185
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

682
00:44:36,396 --> 00:44:39,456
I know you're all worried,
and I agree.

683
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:44,863
There's plenty to be worried about.
Like this solar power plant

684
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:48,196
already operational
outside Los Angeles.

685
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:50,872
Photovoltaic cells,

686
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:54,410
they converts sunlight
directly into electricity.

687
00:44:55,248 --> 00:44:59,309
Fluorescent, lasts ten times as
long as a conventional light bulb.

688
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:01,479
uses only a quarter of the power.

689
00:45:01,821 --> 00:45:06,258
Superwindows, insulate as
well as ten sheets of glass.

690
00:45:06,693 --> 00:45:10,754
An electric car, partially
powered by solar panels.

691
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:14,733
But the truth is, gentlemen,

692
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:18,463
I'm not worried about
any of these things.

693
00:45:19,105 --> 00:45:22,700
Because no one is ever
going to know about them.

694
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:28,648
There's all these conspiracy theories
out there about who killed the electric car.

695
00:45:28,715 --> 00:45:31,013
So really, who killed the electric car?

696
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:33,743
Unfortunately, I can't
summarize that in one sentence.

697
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,015
What killed the electric vehicle,

698
00:45:36,089 --> 00:45:38,319
very simply, I think,
is lack of corporate wisdom.

699
00:45:38,425 --> 00:45:41,223
In my opinion it's big oil
that killed the electric car.

700
00:45:41,294 --> 00:45:44,354
Alan Lloyd killed the electric car project.
I was there when he did it.

701
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:47,592
The California Air Resources Board
killed the electric car

702
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:51,103
under huge pressure
from the auto companies.

703
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:53,298
They were an accessory
to the murder,

704
00:45:53,373 --> 00:45:56,103
but the murder was commited
by the General Motors.

705
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:58,243
I don't believe that for a minute.

706
00:45:58,745 --> 00:46:04,911
GM would sell you a
car on pig shit if it sold.

707
00:46:10,991 --> 00:46:15,360
<i>Carmakers argue that there was not
enough demand for the electric car.</i>

708
00:46:15,428 --> 00:46:18,591
<i>Claiming to have spent millions
of dollars on advertising,</i>

709
00:46:18,665 --> 00:46:20,860
<i>they said buyers weren't interested.</i>

710
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:24,368
<i>But did consumers even know
that the car existed?</i>

711
00:46:24,437 --> 00:46:27,372
Did you ever see this
car advertised?

712
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,206
Never. That's what I'm trying to say.
It's totally under the scope of the radar.

713
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:33,903
I don't know who drives
an EV1 actually.

714
00:46:34,147 --> 00:46:35,637
- You don't know anybody?
- Anybody.

715
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:39,283
Maybe Fernando. I know Fernando...
Did you ever drive an EV1?

716
00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:41,850
- I've heard of them.
- He's heard of them.

717
00:46:41,955 --> 00:46:44,515
They're not making these
cars in California anymore?

718
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:46,388
No. They're not
making them anywhere.

719
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:48,654
That's really too bad.
We need those cars.

720
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:50,955
Why are they getting rid of it?

721
00:46:52,565 --> 00:46:55,432
They said that there was
no demand for the car.

722
00:46:55,502 --> 00:46:56,867
Are they insane?

723
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,762
That's a no-brainer.
Of course there's a demand.

724
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:02,137
Save gas, save people, save air,
save oxygen, save the world.

725
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,800
All sounds good to me.

726
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:09,104
<i>We've been selling
vehicles for a century,</i>

727
00:47:09,215 --> 00:47:12,810
<i>and as you might imagine,
we've figured out what people wanted.</i>

728
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:15,980
If you ask them, they say:
"I want a 300 mile range."

729
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:19,389
<i>"I want to be able
to go 85 or 90 mph</i>

730
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:22,622
<i>"I want to carry four passengers
and have a big trunk. "</i>

731
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:25,859
Which is basically
what we were already selling.

732
00:47:25,932 --> 00:47:27,559
<i>I've said this
time and time again.</i>

733
00:47:27,634 --> 00:47:29,829
<i>People will buy anthing
you convince them to buy.</i>

734
00:47:31,004 --> 00:47:35,373
Feed people enough, and
they believe that's a diet.

735
00:47:36,476 --> 00:47:38,876
Consumers, they
couldn't see the difference

736
00:47:38,945 --> 00:47:41,175
between electric car and
the car they're already driving

737
00:47:41,247 --> 00:47:43,738
because they don't
read environmental impact.

738
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:46,818
They don't read political instability
caused by oil production

739
00:47:46,886 --> 00:47:47,910
in the Middle East.

740
00:47:47,987 --> 00:47:51,582
All they read is does this car
work and how much does it cost.

741
00:47:52,992 --> 00:47:55,825
<i>What really killed EV's,
is American consumers</i>

742
00:47:55,895 --> 00:47:59,558
because they did not accept this
idea, did not embrace it,

743
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,631
that vehicles could have
these limited ranges

744
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:06,103
and still be functional,
useful, practical.

745
00:48:12,412 --> 00:48:16,041
<i>Did the electric car die
because of the battery technology ?</i>

746
00:48:16,116 --> 00:48:18,846
<i>Did EV's really not
have enough range?</i>

747
00:48:18,918 --> 00:48:22,251
<i>Did car companies use
the best batteries available?</i>

748
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:26,281
<i>Battery technology at that
time was lead accid batteries</i>

749
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:29,021
<i>and allowed the car to go 60 miles.</i>

750
00:48:29,195 --> 00:48:33,553
If you started out on a trip knowing
that you were going to go dead in 60 miles,

751
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:35,858
you'd be nervous about
making the trip.

752
00:48:37,003 --> 00:48:40,029
<i>People think that they need
a car that will go 300 miles</i>

753
00:48:40,106 --> 00:48:43,405
and be able to charge it up
or refuel it in five minutes.

754
00:48:43,643 --> 00:48:48,335
<i>For virtually 90-95% of your driving,
you really don't need that.</i>

755
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:51,549
You need a vehicle that will go
at least 60 miles or so,

756
00:48:51,618 --> 00:48:54,610
and that way your daily
commute is covered.

757
00:48:54,687 --> 00:48:59,147
<i>For those who wanted greater
range from an EV, a 100 miles or more</i>

758
00:48:59,225 --> 00:49:01,489
<i>a better battery already existed.</i>

759
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:04,894
<i>Developed by a well known
inventor working in Troy, Michigan,</i>

760
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:07,558
<i>about 30 miles from
General Motors headquarters.</i>

761
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,602
- I'm Stan and...
- And lris Ovshinsky.

762
00:49:12,472 --> 00:49:13,734
I think you shouldn't do that.

763
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:16,742
You should say you're Stan Ovshinsky,
and I'll say I'm Iris Ovshinsky.

764
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,402
Don't do that. It's funny.

765
00:49:18,478 --> 00:49:23,677
<i>With over 200 patents to his name,
Stan Ovshinsky had pioneered a new battery</i>

766
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,776
<i>and GM purchased
controlling share of his company.</i>

767
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:31,286
We were chosen over
60 different big companies,

768
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:33,119
like Westinghouse and others,

769
00:49:33,293 --> 00:49:37,389
who wanted to win the
race to make the batteries

770
00:49:37,764 --> 00:49:41,359
that would be used in pure electric cars.

771
00:49:41,868 --> 00:49:44,837
And we were chosen
because we had a battery.

772
00:49:45,438 --> 00:49:49,772
<i>And to us,
putting it into a car</i>

773
00:49:49,843 --> 00:49:52,505
<i>was not the most
gigantic thing.</i>

774
00:49:52,712 --> 00:49:54,441
What were we supposed to do?

775
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:56,641
But you did expect
champagne and roses.

776
00:49:56,716 --> 00:49:58,741
I expected
champagne and roses.

777
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:03,583
When I said that we were going to
put a paragraph into a newspaper,

778
00:50:03,656 --> 00:50:05,317
that said we had achieved this,

779
00:50:05,391 --> 00:50:09,054
I really expected
congratulations to flow in.

780
00:50:09,429 --> 00:50:13,388
And then I knew that something was
different when the opposite happened.

781
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:18,130
<i>Ovshinsky was censored for publicizing
his battery advances without permission</i>

782
00:50:19,272 --> 00:50:22,639
<i>and asked not to run
advertising in national publications.</i>

783
00:50:23,409 --> 00:50:26,310
<i>The EV1 debuted
with a weaker battery.</i>

784
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:29,344
<i>It would be another 2 years
before Ovshinsky's batteries</i>

785
00:50:29,415 --> 00:50:31,178
<i>were installed in the EV1.</i>

786
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,348
The first version of the EV1
had defective Delco batteries,

787
00:50:36,422 --> 00:50:37,616
and they kept failing.

788
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,181
That was GM's failure,
on those batteries.

789
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,854
Once they put good batteries in,
they didn't have any problems.

790
00:50:42,962 --> 00:50:46,625
<i>Ultimately, GM sold its
share in Ovshinsky's company</i>

791
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:48,394
<i>to an unlikely buyer.</i>

792
00:50:48,668 --> 00:50:51,102
<i>Then, when the Ni-MH
batteries were improved,</i>

793
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:55,903
so that they're now lasting longer than
the life of the car and cheaper than an engine,

794
00:50:56,576 --> 00:51:01,673
Chevron Texaco stepped in and
purchased control from General Motors

795
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:03,645
<i>of Ovshinsky technology.</i>

796
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:07,450
<i>The oil companies do not feel
threatened by battery technology,</i>

797
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:10,418
because they
effectively crushed it.

798
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,685
The electric car is an
interesting case study.

799
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:15,793
It was such an abysmal failure,

800
00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:18,825
that there are a lot of people
involved in the initial decision making

801
00:51:18,898 --> 00:51:21,958
that are pointing fingers
at whose responsibility it is.

802
00:51:32,378 --> 00:51:37,111
<i>To Basrah and all of Iraq comes good
news with the opening of a new oil field.</i>

803
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:41,210
<i>The pipeline runs across the
desert to the Persian Gulf at Al Faw.</i>

804
00:51:41,988 --> 00:51:46,220
<i>There, tankers load up with the
precious fuel the world needs so badly.</i>

805
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,021
<i>Yes, it's a big day for Iraq,
and there's a feast to celebrate.</i>

806
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:54,559
<i>Sheep stuffed with rice
and host of other good things.</i>

807
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:59,765
<i>But that's only the first of the good
things that will come to Iraq, thanks to oil.</i>

808
00:52:02,141 --> 00:52:04,974
<i>Oil companies have rarely
shied away from global issues.</i>

809
00:52:05,044 --> 00:52:08,502
<i>But why did they lobby so
hard to build a public opposition</i>

810
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:10,606
<i>to the electric car in California?</i>

811
00:52:10,683 --> 00:52:13,277
I find it difficult to rationalize

812
00:52:15,188 --> 00:52:17,884
why the oil industry got so
intimately involved in this.

813
00:52:17,957 --> 00:52:21,324
Other than maybe
they saw it as a threat

814
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:25,797
to the monopoly they had on
providing the transportation fuel.

815
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:29,999
There's no question that the oil companies
who control the market today

816
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:34,398
have a strong incentive
to discourage alternatives,

817
00:52:34,974 --> 00:52:38,000
except the alternatives
that they themselves control.

818
00:52:38,144 --> 00:52:41,204
Just as General Motors,

819
00:52:42,582 --> 00:52:46,279
<i>40 or 50 years ago, bought up
the trolley systems and shut them down,</i>

820
00:52:46,352 --> 00:52:51,915
<i>the oil companies have opposed
the creation of an electric infrastructure.</i>

821
00:52:53,826 --> 00:52:57,284
I differ strongly with that.
We did not kill the electric car.

822
00:52:57,363 --> 00:52:59,126
The petroleum industry
did not kill the electric car.

823
00:52:59,198 --> 00:53:02,258
<i>What killed the electric car
was antiquated technology.</i>

824
00:53:02,702 --> 00:53:06,001
It's a good example of
something we should not repeat,

825
00:53:06,072 --> 00:53:07,937
an example we need to avoid.

826
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:15,709
<i>There's still roughly a trillion barrels
worth of oil in the Earth's crust.</i>

827
00:53:16,082 --> 00:53:20,985
And if you figure that the average price
of that subsequent oil will be 100 $ a barrel,

828
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:24,751
that's a 100 trillion dollars
worth of business yet to be done.

829
00:53:26,793 --> 00:53:30,820
<i>However, at some point when
an alternative is good enough,</i>

830
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:35,630
<i>people will snap over, and that's
what the oil companies fear the most.</i>

831
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:39,466
<i>We use 180 million gallons
of gasoline a week in California.</i>

832
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:44,340
Right now, the price is 2,20 $.
A year ago, it was 1,20 $.

833
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,410
There's a dollar more a gallon.

834
00:53:46,479 --> 00:53:50,677
Somebody's making 180
million dollars more a week.

835
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:54,151
<i>It's the same gas, the same
pipeline, the same refinery.</i>

836
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,085
The profits are outstanding.

837
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:06,859
<i>What the oil companies feared,</i>

838
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:11,666
is that electric vehicles would
become successful six years from now.

839
00:54:11,738 --> 00:54:13,968
What the automobile
companies feared,

840
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,134
was that they'd be losing money
on electric vehicles in the next six months.

841
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:28,111
<i>Even as car companies made electric
cars, they fought them at every step.</i>

842
00:54:28,387 --> 00:54:29,820
<i>What was their motive?</i>

843
00:54:29,889 --> 00:54:32,983
<i>Why were they so determined
to take them off the road?</i>

844
00:54:33,426 --> 00:54:35,394
I think in the beginning,

845
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:37,827
General Motors didn't believe
the car would catch on.

846
00:54:37,897 --> 00:54:40,422
I don't think they'd thought
they'd ever have to worry about

847
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,402
something like a conspiracy to keep it
from happening. They hated the mandate.

848
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:47,132
They hated it so much that they
ended up not really wanting

849
00:54:47,206 --> 00:54:48,639
to be in the business of EV's.

850
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:53,475
What I detected was a huge
resentment about being told

851
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,139
<i>what type of motor
vehicle had to be made.</i>

852
00:54:56,215 --> 00:55:00,743
<i>And it became a fight of
principle rather than one of trying</i>

853
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,721
to technologically
solve the problem.

854
00:55:04,056 --> 00:55:08,425
I do know that I was surprised
at some of the stances they took

855
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:11,156
in Sacramento in arguing.

856
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,224
End of comment.

857
00:55:17,069 --> 00:55:20,232
<i>In a confidential 1995 memo</i>

858
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:23,742
<i>the American Automobile
Manufacturers Association</i>

859
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:27,473
<i>sought to hire a PR firm
to manage a so-called </i>

860
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:30,380
<i>"grassroots and educational campaign"</i>

861
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,416
<i>to create a climate
to repeal the mandate.</i>

862
00:55:33,786 --> 00:55:35,981
<i>The challenge,
according to the document,</i>

863
00:55:36,055 --> 00:55:39,616
<i>was "greater consumer
acceptance of electric vehicles."</i>

864
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:45,126
<i>Why would the car companies campaign
so hard against their own creation?</i>

865
00:55:45,398 --> 00:55:48,799
I made the case at the
General Motors board,

866
00:55:49,769 --> 00:55:53,899
that the reason for the EV1
was to give General Motors

867
00:55:53,973 --> 00:55:58,774
<i>a very big head start
in how you transform electricity</i>

868
00:55:58,845 --> 00:56:01,370
<i>into the drive power of a car.</i>

869
00:56:01,447 --> 00:56:04,712
And we give them two or three years lead,

870
00:56:04,784 --> 00:56:07,082
and in my judgement it did.

871
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,656
<i>But my frustration was
they didn't capitalize on the lead.</i>

872
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:13,917
<i>And the reason, which
was discussed with the board,</i>

873
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:18,859
was that there was not a
profit seemed to be coming out

874
00:56:19,031 --> 00:56:21,556
<i>of either electric cars or hybrids.</i>

875
00:56:21,801 --> 00:56:26,295
<i>They could not understand how
Toyota could possibly make a profit</i>

876
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:30,138
<i>out of the Prius, for example.
They were gonna lose their shirt.</i>

877
00:56:30,676 --> 00:56:35,510
<i>And as evidence have shown,
I don't think Toyota is losing their shirt.</i>

878
00:56:36,382 --> 00:56:39,078
<i>If loss of revenue
worried car companies</i>

879
00:56:39,218 --> 00:56:42,847
<i>than the electric car posed
another problem altogether:</i>

880
00:56:42,922 --> 00:56:47,859
<i>it had no internal combustion engine,
the cornerstone of the auto industry.</i>

881
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:50,994
These parts represent a large
part of a dealership's income,

882
00:56:52,131 --> 00:56:55,132
through the replacement
and the maintenance.

883
00:56:55,234 --> 00:56:59,102
Esentially, this group of parts
is a visual representation

884
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:02,663
of the profits the auto industry
doesn't make when they sell an EV1,

885
00:57:02,742 --> 00:57:04,232
or an EV in general.

886
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:08,576
I can actually identify a lot of these
that didn't get used on the EV1 program.

887
00:57:08,648 --> 00:57:10,616
<i>Oil filters you need
four times a year.</i>

888
00:57:10,683 --> 00:57:11,980
<i>It was the most prominent thing,</i>

889
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:14,781
<i>along with several
quarts of oil every time.</i>

890
00:57:14,987 --> 00:57:17,615
I didn't enjoy working on the
internal combustion engines,

891
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:19,555
just due to the fact
you got so dirty.

892
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:23,288
And working on the EV1, I
basically go home looking like this.

893
00:57:24,497 --> 00:57:27,898
<i>Servicing the EV1 was pretty simple.</i>

894
00:57:27,967 --> 00:57:31,061
It came in about every 5000 miles.

895
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:36,973
We'd rotate the tires, add washer fluid
to it, and send it back out on the street.

896
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:42,010
It's amazing. Look how dirty
I've gotten just handling this stuff.

897
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:43,541
It's kind of sad.

898
00:57:43,616 --> 00:57:45,641
<i>In order to sincerely
market a clean car,</i>

899
00:57:45,718 --> 00:57:48,812
you have to suggest
that your core product is dirty,

900
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:51,253
that it uses oil, that it uses gas,

901
00:57:51,324 --> 00:57:53,884
and that increases our
dependance on foreign oil.

902
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,257
And here's this
product that doesn't.

903
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:58,793
It looks very schizophrenic,
but I think, when it started...

904
00:57:58,864 --> 00:58:01,230
"We can show the people in California

905
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,066
we can meet the zero
emission requirements."

906
00:58:05,271 --> 00:58:08,468
And later on: "Do we
want to show them?"

907
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,168
"That means, all of
our other cars..."

908
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:13,276
But the more it caught on, the more
that there was this dichotomy

909
00:58:13,346 --> 00:58:18,716
between clean and efficient and
non-polluting versus a Suburban.

910
00:58:19,552 --> 00:58:21,713
<i>Car companies
had convinced themselves</i>

911
00:58:21,787 --> 00:58:25,518
<i>that they couldn't make money
in the short term with the electric car.</i>

912
00:58:25,591 --> 00:58:29,789
<i>In order to do that, they would
need an entirely different vehicle.</i>

913
00:58:30,296 --> 00:58:33,356
<i>General Motors made a
commitment to the Hummer,</i>

914
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:36,694
because they could see that
the Hummer would make them money.

915
00:58:40,106 --> 00:58:43,166
When SUV's first came out,
people said: "I can't drive that."

916
00:58:43,242 --> 00:58:45,301
- "That big old truck?"
- Especially for the ladies.

917
00:58:45,378 --> 00:58:47,403
- "I can't see out of there."
- "I'm going to murder somebody in that."

918
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,176
- "That's too big."
- "That's too big for me."

919
00:58:50,249 --> 00:58:53,412
- But they convinced people. "This is safer."
- "You need this car."

920
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,420
- "You need a big car."
- "This is a safe car."

921
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:57,046
- "You need this for your family."
- "Bigger, safer."

922
00:58:57,123 --> 00:59:03,187
The idea of a penny-pinching EV1
that was super-green,

923
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:04,695
that didn't get a lot attraction.

924
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:08,222
Whereas the idea of a gigantic SUV

925
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,565
that would crush your neighbor,
that did get a lot attraction.

926
00:59:11,637 --> 00:59:14,470
<i>Basically, that tells us
what the 90's was about.</i>

927
00:59:16,142 --> 00:59:21,580
<i>What began as a 25 000 $ tax
break, grew to a 100 000 $</i>

928
00:59:21,747 --> 00:59:25,945
<i>when Congress passed the President's
economic stimulus package last spring.</i>

929
00:59:26,085 --> 00:59:28,850
We think small businesses need
to have support at this time

930
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:31,487
to keep them afloat, to
keep the economy moving ahead.

931
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:34,184
But there's an encouragement
for the small business person,

932
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,889
not just to stay afloat, but to go
the biggest gas guzzler there is.

933
00:59:37,963 --> 00:59:42,093
The 6,000-pound car, the biggest.
Does that make sense?

934
00:59:42,301 --> 00:59:46,135
I don't think we can dictate
what vehicles people buy.

935
00:59:46,205 --> 00:59:48,173
- The goal here is...
- This is encouraging them!

936
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,834
You can almost buy the
whole car for the tax break.

937
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:53,470
I'm not going to concede

938
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:56,106
that that would be the
way that this would be used...

939
00:59:56,182 --> 00:59:58,013
There is some evidence that
is how they are being used.

940
00:59:58,084 --> 01:00:00,211
I don't know. We'll have
to wait and see what happens.

941
01:00:39,525 --> 01:00:43,086
I don't want to see Hummers driven
off the market by the government.

942
01:00:43,529 --> 01:00:47,863
I want to see everything given
a level, equal chance.

943
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:51,960
The thing that bothers me is that
it's not a level, equal chance.

944
01:00:52,037 --> 01:00:54,870
We're using our military
to ensure the flow of oil.

945
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,933
We're using tax dollars to support
the car companies in different ways,

946
01:00:59,011 --> 01:01:03,607
and we're not using our tax money to do
the things that we really need to do

947
01:01:03,682 --> 01:01:04,950
to prepare for the future.

948
01:01:11,757 --> 01:01:16,285
<i>Federal policy has always had
tremendous power to shape the future.</i>

949
01:01:16,762 --> 01:01:20,129
<i>As it gave enormous
incentives to buy SUV's</i>

950
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:24,898
<i>the federal government also sued
California to stop the electric car.</i>

951
01:01:25,571 --> 01:01:29,863
<i>Some pointed to the influence
of the oil and auto industries.</i>

952
01:01:30,843 --> 01:01:34,507
<i>They control things in Washington,
they and the automobile industry.</i>

953
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:37,542
<i>Now they've got Andy Card there,</i>

954
01:01:37,616 --> 01:01:41,643
<i>former lobbyist, as chief
of staff in the White House.</i>

955
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,689
I guess they don't have to
pay the lobbyists anymore.

956
01:01:44,757 --> 01:01:46,588
So they're saving a little money there.

957
01:01:46,792 --> 01:01:48,851
<i>Andrew Card was chief of staff</i>

958
01:01:48,928 --> 01:01:52,523
<i>when the Bush administration
joined the suit against California.</i>

959
01:01:52,831 --> 01:01:55,629
<i>Card had also been
president and C.E.O.</i>

960
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:59,262
<i>of the American Automobile
Manufacturers Association</i>

961
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:03,536
<i>during its campaign to kill
California's electric car mandate.</i>

962
01:02:04,009 --> 01:02:08,446
Industries began to see if we
don't kill this cancer in California,

963
01:02:08,514 --> 01:02:10,505
<i>it's going to spread to
the rest of the country.</i>

964
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:14,849
<i>I think it became a strategy
on the part of many companies</i>

965
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,150
<i>to make it a national issue.</i>

966
01:02:17,256 --> 01:02:19,850
I was even told once by a very
prominent congressman

967
01:02:19,925 --> 01:02:21,722
who I shall not mention
by name, that

968
01:02:21,794 --> 01:02:26,595
"I could understand and tolerate
what you're doing in California,

969
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:30,465
"but if you ever try to spread
your California program"

970
01:02:30,536 --> 01:02:34,131
"to the rest of my country,
I'm going to have to do battle with you."

971
01:02:35,307 --> 01:02:38,640
Sometimes, I listen
to the energy debate

972
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:43,648
and I think I'm watching an old
movie that was made back in the 70's.

973
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:50,550
Because the discussion is exactly
the same as it was 30 years ago.

974
01:02:50,923 --> 01:02:53,983
<i>Our average vehicle,
average car on the road,</i>

975
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:56,584
<i>is less efficient than
it was 20 years ago.</i>

976
01:02:56,829 --> 01:02:59,161
And this is just a complete
abdication of leadership.

977
01:02:59,231 --> 01:03:01,096
Political leadership, really.

978
01:03:01,467 --> 01:03:06,302
Because it's impossible to get fuel economy
standards passed through the U.S. Congress.

979
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,976
<i>After the OPEC
oil embargo in the 1970's,</i>

980
01:03:12,044 --> 01:03:15,844
<i>the U.S. government created
Corporate Average Fuel Economy</i>

981
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:20,582
<i>or CAFE standards, to improve
fuel economy in American vehicles.</i>

982
01:03:20,986 --> 01:03:27,289
<i>As a result, in less than 10 years, fuel
economy increased by more than 50 percent.</i>

983
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:31,996
<i>Unfortunately, two decades later,
there has been virtually no change.</i>

984
01:03:32,064 --> 01:03:34,259
Jimmy Carter was the last president

985
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:38,895
that really made
energy a high priority.

986
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:43,806
He devoted his first 90 days in office
to put together an energy plan.

987
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:46,107
I was there as part of it.

988
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:49,837
No president since then
has put that kind of effort into it.

989
01:03:50,182 --> 01:03:55,551
I am tonight setting a clear goal for
the energy policy of the United States.

990
01:03:56,121 --> 01:04:00,182
Beginning this moment, this
nation will never use

991
01:04:00,259 --> 01:04:05,754
more foreign oil than
we did in 1977. Never.

992
01:04:14,506 --> 01:04:18,704
<i>There was a radical change
when Ronald Reagan came in</i>

993
01:04:18,777 --> 01:04:23,476
<i>and took down the solar panels off the
White House roof that Jimmy had put up,</i>

994
01:04:23,549 --> 01:04:26,609
and esentially, declared
war on the sun.

995
01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:30,684
I've put a freeze on pending
regulations and set up a task force

996
01:04:31,123 --> 01:04:34,149
under vice president Bush
to review regulations

997
01:04:34,226 --> 01:04:36,922
with an eye toward getting
rid of as many as possible.

998
01:04:37,196 --> 01:04:40,996
I have de-controlled oil, which should
result in more domestic production

999
01:04:41,066 --> 01:04:43,193
and less dependance
on foreign oil.

1000
01:04:43,268 --> 01:04:46,795
When Reagan came in, he was not
a supporter of fuel economy,

1001
01:04:46,872 --> 01:04:49,238
of conservation,
of renewables.

1002
01:04:49,475 --> 01:04:53,343
In the mid 1980's, he basically
stopped any improvement

1003
01:04:53,412 --> 01:04:55,744
in fuel economy
standards for cars.

1004
01:04:55,948 --> 01:04:58,610
And then, in 1985,
the prices of oil collapsed.

1005
01:04:59,051 --> 01:05:03,314
I would not lay all of the blame
at Ronald Reagan's feet, by any means.

1006
01:05:04,456 --> 01:05:08,017
I think he had his share of
responsibility, but so did the Saudis,

1007
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:11,718
who made a very
calculating decision,

1008
01:05:12,297 --> 01:05:14,731
to drop the price
of oil dramatically,

1009
01:05:15,434 --> 01:05:19,336
<i>principally to ensure that
none of these alternative fuels</i>

1010
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:26,569
<i>and energy saving measures
really produced the desired results.</i>

1011
01:05:27,246 --> 01:05:31,876
<i>So they kept the junkie
hooked up, in other words.</i>

1012
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:37,479
<i>And as a result, we are
today still addicted to oil.</i>

1013
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:41,656
When Clinton came in,
and I worked for Clinton,

1014
01:05:41,727 --> 01:05:46,391
we were definitely quite interested
in trying to come up with alternatives

1015
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:48,490
and improve the fuel
economy of the fleet.

1016
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:51,468
<i>Politically, it was still very unattractive.</i>

1017
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:54,004
<i>The automobile lobby
was quite powerful then,</i>

1018
01:05:54,072 --> 01:05:57,940
<i>so the administration kind of made
a bargain with the automobile companies,</i>

1019
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,672
<i>this partnership for
new generation of vehicles</i>

1020
01:06:00,746 --> 01:06:02,737
<i>where we would develop
hybrid vehicles,</i>

1021
01:06:02,815 --> 01:06:06,114
<i>a combination of a gasoline
engine and an electric drive train.</i>

1022
01:06:06,218 --> 01:06:09,654
<i>In return, we wouldn't really
pursue fuel economy standards.</i>

1023
01:06:10,322 --> 01:06:12,654
I've never met a five year
old kid like this in my life.

1024
01:06:12,724 --> 01:06:15,693
He said: "I'm glad
to meet you, Mr. President."

1025
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:19,356
"I want you to make a car that runs
on electricity and doesn't pollute the air."

1026
01:06:20,766 --> 01:06:22,893
I was so impressed,
I went to get Al Gore

1027
01:06:22,968 --> 01:06:24,697
and I introduced him
to this five year old boy,

1028
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:29,469
and he said: "Hello, Mr. vice président.
I intend to spend my life working on this."

1029
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:32,510
"I am going to help you
develop an electric car"

1030
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:34,273
"that has no pollution."

1031
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,811
Al Gore says: "That means
we're going to be partners."

1032
01:06:37,883 --> 01:06:39,441
He said: "Yes, I guess so."

1033
01:06:39,518 --> 01:06:42,578
"But you don't understand. I'm
going to spend my whole life on this."

1034
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:51,157
For 8-9 years, we've spent about
a billion dollars of taxpayers' money

1035
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,027
to develop hybrid vehicles.

1036
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:58,660
Ironically, the U.S. car companies
didn't put any hybrids on the road.

1037
01:06:58,737 --> 01:07:01,399
<i>In fact, the minute George Bush
got elected president,</i>

1038
01:07:01,473 --> 01:07:04,033
<i>the U.S. car companies
walked away from hybrids.</i>

1039
01:07:04,109 --> 01:07:06,441
But, and this is the irony,

1040
01:07:06,512 --> 01:07:09,879
the U.S. program got the
Japanese very nervous.

1041
01:07:09,948 --> 01:07:14,385
So Toyota and Honda, in
response, developed hybrids,

1042
01:07:14,553 --> 01:07:16,714
because they didn't
want to be beaten by the U.S.

1043
01:07:23,295 --> 01:07:26,662
Now, they lure people into
thinking they're doing something

1044
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:28,893
but they sweet-talk.

1045
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:32,427
I remember way back we
used to have this joke,

1046
01:07:32,671 --> 01:07:34,502
<i>but it's not a joke anymore.</i>

1047
01:07:34,573 --> 01:07:38,031
<i>We're giving the environmentalists
the music and the industry the action.</i>

1048
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:41,238
<i>The second step toward making
America less dependant on foreign oil</i>

1049
01:07:41,313 --> 01:07:44,305
<i>is to produce and refine
more crude oil here at home</i>

1050
01:07:44,383 --> 01:07:46,977
<i>in environmentally
sensitive ways.</i>

1051
01:07:48,453 --> 01:07:50,717
<i>By far the most promising
site for oil in America</i>

1052
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:54,122
<i>is the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.</i>

1053
01:07:59,898 --> 01:08:04,028
<i>While it is predicted that
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</i>

1054
01:08:04,102 --> 01:08:08,732
<i>could supply America with slightly
more than one year's supply of oil,</i>

1055
01:08:09,107 --> 01:08:13,567
<i>simply raising fuel economy
standards to 40 miles per gallon</i>

1056
01:08:13,645 --> 01:08:17,672
<i>could save the same
amount of fuel within 15 years.</i>

1057
01:08:25,824 --> 01:08:29,760
<i>The oil industry and
the automobile companies</i>

1058
01:08:29,828 --> 01:08:31,489
<i>are resistant to change.</i>

1059
01:08:31,563 --> 01:08:36,398
The American people need to be reminded
that it took a law to get seatbelts in the cars.

1060
01:08:36,568 --> 01:08:39,002
It took a law to get airbags in the cars.

1061
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:43,371
It took a law to get the mileage up
from 12 to 20 miles per gallon.

1062
01:08:43,442 --> 01:08:47,105
<i>It took a law to get catalytic
converters to control the pollution.</i>

1063
01:08:47,512 --> 01:08:51,471
I think clean cars are too important
to be left to the automobile industry.

1064
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:03,485
<i>The California mandate forced
automakers to make electric cars.</i>

1065
01:09:03,695 --> 01:09:07,222
<i>When California changed it,
the cars vanished.</i>

1066
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:12,236
<i>Why did California retreat
from the bold law it created?</i>

1067
01:09:12,704 --> 01:09:15,537
Having visited all the car
companies, they were saying:

1068
01:09:15,807 --> 01:09:19,607
"Look, we can't produce
these increasing numbers of the

1069
01:09:19,678 --> 01:09:21,646
<i>battery electric vehicles."</i>

1070
01:09:21,713 --> 01:09:23,908
<i>And I became convinced that...</i>

1071
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,916
What are we supposed to do here?
Is our job to clean the air?

1072
01:09:27,986 --> 01:09:33,083
Or is it to force a certain number of a
type of technology out on the road?

1073
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:38,195
<i>Alan Lloyd failed in his
leadership to really steer</i>

1074
01:09:38,263 --> 01:09:42,097
the zero emission vehicle mandate
toward a successful outcome.

1075
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:43,634
Oh, I know Alec very well.

1076
01:09:43,702 --> 01:09:46,193
I know Alec very well. And we had some...

1077
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:49,729
heartfelt memos come back.

1078
01:09:49,808 --> 01:09:53,335
And it pained me, because I
have the utmost respect for Alec.

1079
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,207
And it pained me to be accused

1080
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:01,410
of basically abanding
the battery electrics.

1081
01:10:01,753 --> 01:10:05,553
<i>In addition to his role as
chairman of the Air Resources Board,</i>

1082
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:08,057
<i>Alan Lloyd had another position.</i>

1083
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:11,994
<i>Just four months before the
meeting that killed the electric car,</i>

1084
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:16,790
<i>Lloyd accepted the chairmanship
of the California Fuel Cell Partnership.</i>

1085
01:10:18,136 --> 01:10:20,297
<i>I've been involved with
hydrogen since the early 90's.</i>

1086
01:10:20,372 --> 01:10:24,832
When I became chair of ARB ten years
later, I knew a lot about hydrogen.

1087
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:29,140
So for me, I'm very much
fact-technology driven.

1088
01:10:29,281 --> 01:10:33,012
Maybe you can say that's an asset
or a handicap in the terms of hydrogen

1089
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:35,815
because I knew what could be done.

1090
01:10:44,596 --> 01:10:47,190
Excuse me while I watch
my baby get off here.

1091
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:49,495
<i>Carmakers convinced California</i>

1092
01:10:49,568 --> 01:10:54,427
<i>that the facts supported the
development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.</i>

1093
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:57,436
<i>Were they a better
option than electric cars?</i>

1094
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:02,104
<i>Toyota's national manager of
advanced technologies, Bill Reinert,</i>

1095
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:06,708
<i>took their prototype hydrogen
fuel cell SUV on a press tour.</i>

1096
01:11:06,985 --> 01:11:11,684
One of our customers didn't really like this
car anywhere nearly as much as the EV1.

1097
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:16,985
And the reason was not because it
would have anything bad about the car,

1098
01:11:17,062 --> 01:11:18,689
the reason was because his EV1,

1099
01:11:18,764 --> 01:11:21,392
he could charge it at home,
charge it at work,

1100
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:24,367
and even though it provided limited range,

1101
01:11:24,436 --> 01:11:27,633
he didn't have to worry about
getting his car charged up.

1102
01:11:27,706 --> 01:11:31,403
With this car, with a limited access
to a hydrogen filling station,

1103
01:11:31,476 --> 01:11:34,377
he said he'd spend his whole day
planning how to get hydrogen

1104
01:11:34,446 --> 01:11:35,470
in the car and how to get back.

1105
01:11:35,547 --> 01:11:37,242
It's growing humbly.

1106
01:11:37,315 --> 01:11:39,749
The more you know, the more you realize

1107
01:11:39,818 --> 01:11:43,515
you really don't know what
issues are going to be put forward.

1108
01:11:43,722 --> 01:11:45,383
The number one worst question is:

1109
01:11:45,457 --> 01:11:48,085
"When can...
When will that be on the market?"

1110
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:52,227
When will that be on the market?
That's the worst question.

1111
01:11:52,464 --> 01:11:54,591
Consumers are probably
going to want to know

1112
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:57,260
how long it would be for
this to be mass produced.

1113
01:11:57,335 --> 01:11:58,734
That's quite a ways off.

1114
01:11:58,804 --> 01:12:01,932
We've got some real technical issues
we've got to solve, with hydrogen storage

1115
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:03,941
with durability,
with cost reduction.

1116
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:06,477
Is it a practical solution at this point?

1117
01:12:06,578 --> 01:12:08,341
The cars have a limited range,

1118
01:12:08,413 --> 01:12:12,907
the durability of the car isn't very good...
Let me see, what else?

1119
01:12:12,984 --> 01:12:15,009
They don't do well in cold weather.

1120
01:12:15,086 --> 01:12:17,020
Other than that, they're great.

1121
01:12:17,455 --> 01:12:18,945
Have you ever been to a dog race?

1122
01:12:19,024 --> 01:12:21,857
There's the mechanical
rabbit that's out in front

1123
01:12:21,927 --> 01:12:23,986
and the dogs never quite reach it.

1124
01:12:24,062 --> 01:12:28,658
Well, the fuel cell is the equivalent
of that mechanical rabbit.

1125
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,824
We're going for it.

1126
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:34,964
For the last 15 years they've been telling
us the fuel cells are 10 to 15 years off.

1127
01:12:36,374 --> 01:12:37,363
<i>You're an oil company.</i>

1128
01:12:37,442 --> 01:12:39,600
<i>Your business is to be selling a fuel.</i>

1129
01:12:40,212 --> 01:12:42,646
They think that it's a long time off, 30 years,

1130
01:12:42,914 --> 01:12:44,575
and they want to have a product that sells.

1131
01:12:44,649 --> 01:12:46,742
From that point,
they're protecting themselves

1132
01:12:46,818 --> 01:12:50,117
but the other side is that
they're protecting the status quo.

1133
00:12:50,489 --> 01:12:53,118
<i>We see in Scientific American</i>

1134
01:12:53,191 --> 01:12:56,888
<i>a double page ad by
General Motors and Shell both</i>

1135
01:12:56,962 --> 01:12:59,396
<i>touting both the fuel cell
that General Motors is doing</i>

1136
01:12:59,464 --> 01:13:02,365
<i>and also Shell as a potential
supplier of hydrogen.</i>

1137
01:13:05,804 --> 01:13:10,366
<i>If hydrogen can do a better job
as an energy carrier than electricity,</i>

1138
01:13:10,542 --> 01:13:14,308
<i>then by gosh, it should
be the carrier of choice.</i>

1139
01:13:15,113 --> 01:13:17,308
The problem is, it's not even close.

1140
01:13:17,382 --> 01:13:20,010
How far would this car ride
on environmental fuel?

1141
01:13:20,085 --> 01:13:25,022
It's approximately about a 100-125 miles.

1142
01:13:25,257 --> 01:13:28,090
Good. Interesting.

1143
01:13:28,326 --> 01:13:32,353
<i>A fuel cell car powered by
hydrogen made with electricity</i>

1144
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:37,197
<i>uses three to four times more
energy than a car powered by batteries.</i>

1145
01:13:38,103 --> 01:13:40,833
This is the beginning of a fantastic technology,

1146
01:13:40,906 --> 01:13:43,397
and thanks for having us out here.

1147
01:13:43,475 --> 01:13:45,705
We're going to look at
some other vehicles in a minute,

1148
01:13:45,777 --> 01:13:49,907
but, hydrogen is the way of the future.

1149
01:13:50,015 --> 01:13:53,416
<i>Today, there's a lot of
enthusiasm for hydrogen cars</i>

1150
01:13:53,685 --> 01:13:56,620
<i>but, I wrote the whole book
"The Hype About Hydrogen".</i>

1151
01:13:57,023 --> 01:14:01,615
I think it's pretty clear that hydrogen
is a much tougher alternative fuel

1152
01:14:01,693 --> 01:14:04,457
than any other alternative
fuel we've ever pursued.

1153
01:14:04,529 --> 01:14:06,497
<i>These are the five miracles that you need</i>

1154
01:14:06,564 --> 01:14:08,293
<i>for a successful hydrogen
car in the marketplace.</i>

1155
01:14:08,834 --> 01:14:12,329
<i>First, your average hydrogen
car costs a million dollars.</i>

1156
01:14:12,604 --> 01:14:13,730
<i>That's got to drop.</i>

1157
01:14:15,173 --> 01:14:19,837
<i>Second, no known material to humankind
can store enough hydrogen onboard the car</i>

1158
01:14:19,911 --> 01:14:21,401
<i>to give you the range people want.</i>

1159
01:14:21,781 --> 01:14:25,848
<i>Miracle number three.
The fuel is wildly expensive.</i>

1160
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:30,877
<i>Even hydrogen from dirty fossil fuels
is 2 or 3 times more expensive than gasoline.</i>

1161
01:14:31,257 --> 01:14:34,691
<i>Fourth, you have to have
the fueling infrastructure.</i>

1162
01:14:34,759 --> 01:14:37,023
We have a 180 000 gas stations.

1163
01:14:37,095 --> 01:14:40,758
Someone's going to have to build at least
10 or 20 thousand hydrogen fueling stations

1164
01:14:40,832 --> 01:14:43,426
before anybody is going to be very interested.

1165
01:14:43,769 --> 01:14:46,127
<i>Miracle five is - you have to hope and pray</i>

1166
01:14:46,204 --> 01:14:49,696
<i>that the competitors in the
marketplace don't get any better.</i>

1167
01:14:49,774 --> 01:14:54,643
Because right now, the best car in
the marketplace just got a lot better,

1168
01:14:54,713 --> 01:14:55,737
the hybrid vehicle.

1169
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:58,405
<i>Still runs on gasoline,
you can fuel it everywhere,</i>

1170
01:14:58,483 --> 01:15:00,178
<i>it has twice the range of a regular car.</i>

1171
01:15:00,386 --> 01:15:03,115
<i>Current hybrid vehicles
depend on gasoline,</i>

1172
01:15:04,255 --> 01:15:07,713
<i>but use an electric motor
to increase their fuel economy.</i>

1173
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:11,855
<i>And if battery technology
keeps getting steadily better,</i>

1174
01:15:12,597 --> 01:15:16,897
<i>than the best hybrid, and then
plug-in hybrid in the year 2020</i>

1175
01:15:16,968 --> 01:15:20,734
will be vastly superior
to the best hydrogen car.

1176
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,507
You guys have filmed me long enought to know

1177
01:15:25,577 --> 01:15:28,740
that I'm not going to
dance around the issue.

1178
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:32,271
And these could be a
long ways out into the future.

1179
01:15:34,819 --> 01:15:37,617
Toyota says: "Fuel cell
cars, 30 years away."

1180
01:15:37,689 --> 01:15:40,886
Then I get the calls from the Department
of Energy and the State of California:

1181
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:42,221
"What the hell are you doing?"

1182
01:15:42,293 --> 01:15:44,591
And all the other fuel cell manufacturers:

1183
01:15:44,662 --> 01:15:48,393
"We're trying to make a living here..."

1184
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:49,728
It's awful.

1185
01:15:50,869 --> 01:15:53,838
<i>Just because a lot of people
want it to work, it's no guarantee.</i>

1186
01:15:53,905 --> 01:15:56,772
That's Disneyland, you know -
wishing makes it come true.

1187
01:15:56,841 --> 01:15:58,934
I don't work in Disneyland.

1188
01:15:59,277 --> 01:16:01,939
I work in the real world, where
wishing doesn't make it come true

1189
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:05,949
and you really have to work hard
to make it come true. Hopefully we do.

1190
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:18,185
<i>On the 27th day of their vigil,
activists finally heard from GM.</i>

1191
01:16:27,539 --> 01:16:31,771
Paul Scott called: "Are you guys busy?
They're hauling in the cars right now."

1192
01:16:31,843 --> 01:16:34,403
<i>"GM is loading the cars
on trucks right now!"</i>

1193
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:35,468
"What, what?"

1194
01:16:35,547 --> 01:16:38,710
"Yeah, we'll drop everything
and run on out there right now."

1195
01:16:45,924 --> 01:16:47,516
They've loaded them up,

1196
01:16:47,592 --> 01:16:50,652
tires screeching, and panels
cracking against each other

1197
01:16:50,728 --> 01:16:52,889
as they shoved them onto the tracks.

1198
01:16:57,802 --> 01:17:00,032
<i>We're up against most
of the money in the world.</i>

1199
01:17:00,105 --> 01:17:03,404
We're up against the oil industry,
the automobile industry.

1200
01:17:03,808 --> 01:17:08,336
<i>It's David versus Goliath
in a very big way</i>

1201
01:17:09,114 --> 01:17:12,777
but if there are enough
Davids in the world, we can win.

1202
01:17:20,225 --> 01:17:22,557
<i>GM, shame on you!</i>

1203
01:17:25,563 --> 01:17:29,431
<i>General Motors is taking the EV1's out of here,</i>

1204
01:17:29,934 --> 01:17:31,265
<i>destroying them,</i>

1205
01:17:31,336 --> 01:17:33,497
<i>doing the work of the oil companies.</i>

1206
01:17:34,839 --> 01:17:38,172
We're going to ask you guys just
to give us some grass area

1207
01:17:38,243 --> 01:17:40,234
If you could just get out
of the driveway for us

1208
01:17:40,311 --> 01:17:43,439
so we don't have to put
cuffs on anybody. Thank you.

1209
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:09,570
Don't crush the EV1.

1210
01:18:25,123 --> 01:18:31,255
<i>On March 15th, 2005,
the last EV1's in the Burbank lot</i>

1211
01:18:31,329 --> 01:18:33,490
<i>were taken away and destroyed.</i>

1212
01:19:39,899 --> 01:19:42,762
- Alright, come on in.
- Cool.

1213
01:19:42,834 --> 01:19:45,428
We'll go down to the vault
and I'll show you the car.

1214
01:19:46,971 --> 01:19:48,370
I miss this little car.

1215
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:50,873
Yeah. We love having it.

1216
01:19:50,942 --> 01:19:54,070
We have a number of electric
vehicles in the collection, and the hybrids,

1217
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:56,477
but we're especially happy about this.

1218
01:19:57,815 --> 01:19:59,840
This is a special one.

1219
01:20:00,451 --> 01:20:03,284
- There she is.
- My baby!

1220
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:09,752
Number 99.

1221
01:20:11,429 --> 01:20:14,262
- You might recognize this car.
- I do. It was Chris's car.

1222
01:20:14,332 --> 01:20:15,424
Sure was.

1223
01:20:17,969 --> 01:20:19,197
Please, have a seat.

1224
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:22,000
There's only one challenge,
it doesn't start up.

1225
01:20:23,374 --> 01:20:26,366
You know that General Motors disabled them.

1226
01:20:26,444 --> 01:20:28,708
- I know.
- We wish they didn't, but they had to.

1227
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,941
So we understand that.
We're just happy to have it.

1228
01:20:31,015 --> 01:20:32,004
Yeah.

1229
01:20:32,283 --> 01:20:34,615
That is such an important
part of automotive history.

1230
01:20:34,686 --> 01:20:36,153
- It is...
- To have a manufacturer like

1231
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:39,280
General Motors participate
in this program. It's wonderful.

1232
01:20:39,357 --> 01:20:42,588
The thing is, it shouldn't be
a part of automotive history.

1233
01:20:59,444 --> 01:21:02,545
Ever since 1939, they
would dangle this electric car.

1234
01:21:03,081 --> 01:21:04,514
They'd have a few models out there.

1235
01:21:04,582 --> 01:21:07,073
They'd say that's something
in another few years.

1236
01:21:07,151 --> 01:21:09,984
And it never came. Because
they never intended it to come.

1237
01:21:10,054 --> 01:21:13,182
They make too much money
with the technological stagnation

1238
01:21:13,257 --> 01:21:14,815
in the internal combustion engine.

1239
01:21:18,796 --> 01:21:23,199
If somethin becomes scarce, then there's
economic pressures to find alternatives.

1240
01:21:23,301 --> 01:21:25,769
And as long as no alternatives exist,

1241
01:21:26,371 --> 01:21:29,499
the scarce item can become
increasingly profitable.

1242
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:36,006
These are the same batteries that
are used in your laptop computer.

1243
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,674
We have 6800 cells.

1244
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,412
And it can go 300 miles on one charge,

1245
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:43,710
running along at 70 mph.

1246
01:21:43,888 --> 01:21:46,379
It's now 0-60 in 3.6 seconds.

1247
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:50,757
It's an amazing performance for
any car, not just an electric car.

1248
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:52,386
<i>Those same batteries could be put in EV1</i>

1249
01:21:52,463 --> 01:21:55,091
and make it a 300-mile-range car very easily.

1250
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:58,726
It's a shame seeing these cars destroyed
when you could upgrade them.

1251
01:22:01,773 --> 01:22:04,003
I know what I did and why I did it.

1252
01:22:04,308 --> 01:22:07,539
And if I had to do the same
thing again based on the data,

1253
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:09,077
and I've seen what has happened to date,

1254
01:22:09,147 --> 01:22:11,115
I would do exactly the same thing.

1255
01:22:14,452 --> 01:22:16,784
When we talk about sensible energy policy

1256
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:20,017
most people hear is: "You're going
to make me drive a small car,

1257
01:22:20,091 --> 01:22:21,854
"you're going to make
me keep my house cold,

1258
01:22:21,926 --> 01:22:24,019
"and essentially, you're going
to make me live like a European."

1259
01:22:28,766 --> 01:22:30,597
It's a lack of leadership.

1260
01:22:30,902 --> 01:22:34,429
It's a lack of being able
to take on the oil industry,

1261
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,698
and the automobile industry,

1262
01:22:36,774 --> 01:22:39,106
and recognize that they are not Uncle Sam.

1263
01:22:39,177 --> 01:22:41,338
Uncle Sam has to be Uncle Sam,

1264
01:22:41,446 --> 01:22:44,006
and Uncle Sam is acting
like they're General Motors.

1265
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:50,448
They're squandering
huge amounts of money

1266
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:54,150
on hydrogen cars, which,
by any reasonable estimate,

1267
01:22:54,225 --> 01:22:56,591
are not going to be
selling in the consumer market

1268
01:22:56,661 --> 01:22:58,993
for two decades at the earliest.

1269
01:22:59,096 --> 01:23:02,031
<i>I think it will go down as
one of the biggest blunders</i>

1270
01:23:02,099 --> 01:23:04,567
<i>in the history of the automotive industry.</i>

1271
01:23:08,906 --> 01:23:12,398
Have you never heard that expression:
"Death by a million cuts"?

1272
01:23:12,477 --> 01:23:15,742
Little tiny cuts, eventually
someone will bleed to death.

1273
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:23,578
<i>The fight over electric cars was
quite simply, a fight about the future.</i>

1274
01:23:24,655 --> 01:23:29,217
<i>Goliath won this round, but
now Goliath has new problems.</i>

1275
01:23:30,094 --> 01:23:32,528
<i>Oil prices have soared.</i>

1276
01:23:32,597 --> 01:23:35,896
<i>America is further
entangled in the Middle East,</i>

1277
01:23:36,801 --> 01:23:40,066
<i>and global warming is an
increasingly serious threat.</i>

1278
01:23:40,705 --> 01:23:43,469
<i>What can we do to reshape the future?</i>

1279
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:47,671
<i>This city is replete with famous
names that are no longer here.</i>

1280
01:23:48,846 --> 01:23:52,174
<i>Why? Because they
couldn't adapt to change.</i>

1281
01:23:52,683 --> 01:23:54,545
We all have to adapt to change.

1282
01:23:55,086 --> 01:23:58,454
<i>Don't debate about
who's to blame or what to blame.</i>

1283
01:23:58,723 --> 01:24:00,315
Let's build new industries.

1284
01:24:00,391 --> 01:24:02,757
Let's make America strong again.

1285
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:07,190
<i>Chelsea continues her work with
a new group called Plug In America,</i>

1286
01:24:07,398 --> 01:24:09,696
<i>working with citizens
across the political spectrum</i>

1287
01:24:09,767 --> 01:24:12,702
<i>to promote an independant energy future.</i>

1288
01:24:13,304 --> 01:24:16,330
I met Jim Woolsey at an
event, and as it turns out

1289
01:24:16,407 --> 01:24:18,739
he was already a bit of a fan
of stuff that we were doing,

1290
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:21,039
<i>and he's come to work
with Plug In America.</i>

1291
01:24:21,112 --> 01:24:24,775
That's one example of the types
of relationships that have to exist

1292
01:24:24,849 --> 01:24:27,044
in order to further what we all want.

1293
01:24:27,352 --> 01:24:32,413
I've served in four administrations,
with presidential appointments,

1294
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:35,687
<i>all in different aspects
of national security.</i>

1295
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,593
And the fact that two thirds of
the world's proven reserves of oil

1296
01:24:38,663 --> 01:24:42,064
are in the Middle East, and that we're
so dependant on that part of our world,

1297
01:24:42,133 --> 01:24:44,624
<i>is a very big national security question.</i>

1298
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:46,768
Behind me there are two things.

1299
01:24:46,837 --> 01:24:50,398
One is a Prius, hybrid
gasoline-electric Toyota,

1300
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,767
<i>and an electrical substation.</i>

1301
01:24:52,843 --> 01:24:55,107
<i>Today, they don't have
much to do with one another,</i>

1302
01:24:55,179 --> 01:24:58,910
but there's a chance that they might be able
to have something to do with one another

1303
01:24:58,983 --> 01:25:00,314
in a positive way.

1304
01:25:00,384 --> 01:25:05,185
And that's where I think that the
plug-in hybrid is the natural next step,

1305
01:25:05,489 --> 01:25:07,719
<i>and that it is avilable to us today.</i>

1306
01:25:08,492 --> 01:25:10,517
<i>This is a plug-in hybrid Prius,</i>

1307
01:25:10,595 --> 01:25:14,656
which is a modification
to a normal Toyota Prius

1308
01:25:14,732 --> 01:25:17,166
that allows you to travel...

1309
01:25:17,234 --> 01:25:21,364
<i>Which gives you up to
150-180 miles per gallon</i>

1310
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:23,463
<i>for the first 50 to 60 miles of the day.</i>

1311
01:25:24,275 --> 01:25:27,403
<i>We don't need an expensive
charging infrastructure to use this car.</i>

1312
01:25:27,478 --> 01:25:29,742
<i>You can just plug it in
anywhere in your garage.</i>

1313
01:25:29,814 --> 01:25:32,977
So we make the environmentalists
happy because it's cleaner.

1314
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:38,317
We make the neo-conservatives
happy because it uses less gasoline.

1315
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:40,880
Well, everyone's happy
because it uses less gasoline.

1316
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:44,951
<i>Plugging in could go a long way to
reducing our dependence on oil.</i>

1317
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:49,595
<i>And generating that electricity
with the wind and the sun</i>

1318
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:52,227
<i>would create even less pollution.</i>

1319
01:25:52,903 --> 01:25:57,931
<i>With his battery technology in most
hybrid cars, Ovshinsky has also built</i>

1320
01:25:58,009 --> 01:26:01,445
<i>one of the largest thin-film
solar factories in the world.</i>

1321
01:26:01,512 --> 01:26:03,946
This is just an ordinary steel roof.

1322
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:07,778
And this is with the adhesive.

1323
01:26:07,852 --> 01:26:11,310
You just put the shingles down.

1324
01:26:11,389 --> 01:26:13,755
You're in there. You've
run your wires down.

1325
01:26:13,824 --> 01:26:15,655
Everything is plug-and-play.

1326
01:26:16,594 --> 01:26:20,428
Anybody that wants to make a
revolution shouldn't grab a gun.

1327
01:26:20,731 --> 01:26:23,859
Just go and start
working like we do

1328
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:27,267
to change the world by
using science and technology.

1329
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:31,403
I am so optimistic about the future.

1330
01:26:31,475 --> 01:26:34,842
Even given everything that we've
seen, and all of the EV wars,

1331
01:26:34,912 --> 01:26:36,436
I remain an optimist.

1332
01:26:37,615 --> 01:26:39,879
<i>One of the things that makes America work</i>

1333
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:47,020
is this rampant grassroots
agitation for things that are new.

1334
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:51,220
When you get a coalition of that size,
and that surprising character,

1335
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:52,853
<i>you get politicians' attention.</i>

1336
01:26:53,131 --> 01:26:55,259
<i>And here we have a serious problem:</i>

1337
01:26:55,332 --> 01:26:57,391
<i>America is addicted to oil.</i>

1338
01:26:57,468 --> 01:27:00,835
I call all this a potential coalition
between the tree-huggers,

1339
01:27:00,905 --> 01:27:04,636
<i>the do-gooders, the sod-busters,
the cheap-hawks and the evangelicals.</i>

1340
01:27:05,343 --> 01:27:08,243
That's a pretty good-sized coalition.

1341
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:14,615
We are about to enter into a world that
is truly renewable and completely clean

1342
01:27:14,685 --> 01:27:17,552
if we just had the willpower to implement it.

1343
01:27:17,621 --> 01:27:20,282
You don't have to wait for major
auto companies. You can do it yourself,

1344
01:27:20,424 --> 01:27:21,721
like I'm doing here.

1345
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:23,191
<i>Old cars, new cars -
doesn't really matter.</i>

1346
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,887
<i>I can convert anything.</i>

1347
01:27:25,096 --> 01:27:26,461
You haven't seen anything yet.

1348
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:28,397
The future is going to be
very bright in this area,

1349
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:30,827
<i>and the forces are all
pushing in that direction,</i>

1350
01:27:30,901 --> 01:27:33,962
<i>both the economic
and technological forces.</i>

1351
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:36,172
Once people see these things,

1352
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,401
they say: "Wow, I want to do this!"

1353
01:27:38,576 --> 01:27:40,567
And so the word is getting out.

1354
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:43,772
<i>That gives us hope.</i>

1355
01:27:44,415 --> 01:27:49,614
Hope that we can end up our lives
having achieved what we set out to do.

1356
01:27:49,687 --> 01:27:50,779
And we have.

1357
01:27:50,855 --> 01:27:53,619
And you still have so many
years you want to do things.

1358
01:27:53,691 --> 01:27:54,749
I wouldn't have enought time..

1359
