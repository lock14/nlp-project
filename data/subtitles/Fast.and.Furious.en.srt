<i>Two decades had passed since
the creation of both species ...</i>

3
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,560
<i>The war had begun ...</i>

4
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,939
<i>Victor increased his army,</i>

5
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:59,450
<i>Creating a legion of vampires to protect
them against the very first clan of werewolves.</i>

6
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:05,622
<i>A vicious and infectious breed,
unable to take human form ever again.</i>

7
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:09,009
<i>Until he was born.</i>

8
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,881
<i>Lucian.</i>

9
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:25,923
<i>And even though every fiber bit of his soul
wound him to slay this child,</i>

10
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:28,688
<i>he did not.</i>

11
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,550
<i>Over the years, this child grew...</i>

12
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:42,307
<i>He posses the strength and focus
that the ones before him did not.</i>

13
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,370
What do you think, son?

14
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:12,657
Shall we make more?

15
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:16,372
From him?
- Like him!

16
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,584
Lucian will always be
the first of the breed.

17
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,675
The first of the Lycans.

18
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:34,090
<i>Victor would used  Lucian's infectious
blood to his benefit.</i>

19
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:36,191
<i>Taking advantage
of the child's thirst,</i>

20
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:39,475
<i> pity it against him
as he was forced to feed on humans, </i>

21
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,728
<i>Victor  slaves.</i>

22
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:13,284
<i> Instead, he created a
new race of immortals. </i>

23
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,686
<i> Lycans.
Werewolf, but also human. </i>

24
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:22,844
<i> Unlike the others,
this new breed could be harness. </i>

25
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,306
<i> In slaves to guard them in
the daylight hours to their masters. </i>

26
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:32,775
<i>Or so Victor thought ,
so long very ago ...</i>

The Rise of the Lycans
subs by iskandar.tama@yahoo.co.id

29
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:59,408
The nobles were upset, my lord.
Williams Hestilands has not been checked.

30
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:01,361
Werewolves have killed their slaves.

31
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:03,187
Humans upset, Tanus.

32
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:06,595
Please take note of what pain that brings me.

33
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,646
Yet, their lost slaves
means our lost...

34
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:14,467
Enough! have I note our share increase ten folds
since Marcus and the media is took their sleep?

35
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:19,258
We deal with the wolves as
we always have.

36
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:36,839
Have you nothing better to do, blacksmith,
than to play with weapons of war?

37
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,091
At least make your self useful.

38
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:43,124
A little gratitude, Sonja,
to the one who saved your life.

39
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,305
I need it no savior.

40
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:50,532
Tell me, Lucian, does it burden your heart
to you kill your own kind?

41
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,467
Not at all.
They are mindless beasts, my lord.

42
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,986
No relatives of mine.
- Really?

43
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,328
Father.

44
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:11,924
You are a credit to your race.
Do you know how to remain so?

45
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,301
Keep your eyes on the ground.

46
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:18,522
Get rid of that.

47
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:24,042
You were sorry missed the council.

48
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:27,054
There are other demands
of my time as you know.

49
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,601
I see it. I hope you have enjoyed
your little moonlit ride.

50
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:31,855
I was out patrolling.

51
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,179
You would disobey. I told
you to stay within these walls.

52
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:37,724
You risk too much,
for a father to ignore!

53
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,077
You would lead the wolves to the death dealers.

54
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:43,217
And why father, is my risk
any greater than that?

55
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:45,293
They are not my daughters.

56
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,931
And they are not council members.
You are.

57
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:53,246
And one day you will become an elder,
your birthright.

58
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,269
Sonja, you are well forth on that council.

59
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,975
But that is very precarious thing.

60
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:04,600
They grow tired of your games
and your absence.

61
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:09,206
The dangers of the forest are not
greater than those of the council tribe.

62
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:14,470
You will learn the dance of politics,
to be ruthless and cunning.

63
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:19,109
And above all, you will be loyal
your the family.

64
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:22,883
To me.

65
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:26,055
After all, without
the loyalty between us ...

66
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:29,985
we are no better than the
beast at our door.

67
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,607
Lycan!

68
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:34,001
No! Westdog!

69
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,183
Enough!

70
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:46,106
You dare to raise your hand to me?

71
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:49,391
I said that is enough.
- So says the master's dog.

72
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,681
You will not always be his favorite.

73
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:55,321
If you fall I will be there.

74
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:57,814
Let us hope so.

75
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,475
Where you looking at?
Get back to work!

76
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:04,141
Go back to work!

77
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:16,254
The matter before the council is simple.

78
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,216
We are under attack.

79
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,284
Six times in half as many weeks ...

80
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,696
William's kind has reached our very walls.

81
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:26,653
What mayhem would follow
if one of them got through?

82
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,370
Your fear Coloman, is misplaced.

83
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,785
Are we not protected by
an army of immortals?

84
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:34,927
Superbly, my lord.
However, the nobles are not.

85
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:38,171
And as I appointed out, they are the grass
in which we graze.

86
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:41,443
If we cannot protect our humans
that makes us no weak.

87
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,152
And how would you project strength?

88
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:46,017
As our death dealers
patrol the night ...

89
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,319
so our daylight guards
can patrol the day.

90
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:52,343
Lycans patrol outside the walls?
Have you lost your mind?

91
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,245
They are born of beasts ...

92
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:57,888
and this savagery of this dispicable fact
cannot be bred away!

93
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:00,861
I think you fear
of this idea is misplaced.

94
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:03,949
We can create a priviledge class of Lycans.

95
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:06,338
greater rations, finer cortex...

96
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:09,516
and put them under the hands
of one we trust.

97
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,899
Thats your pet Lucian, the one who saved
your daughter's life today.

98
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:18,370
In fact, I think we should
hear her thoughts on this matter.

99
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:26,606
She seems to be needed elsewhere.
- Find her.

100
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:32,295
I would take your suggestion...

101
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:35,167
under advisesment.
- Thanks, my lord.

102
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:39,295
It would be gratifying to be able to re-assure
the nobles when they arrive tomorrow,

103
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:42,860
that we have their interest at hand.

104
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,232
Lady?

105
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:44,830
Is it true what you told my father?

106
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,563
That you feel nothing when you kill them?

107
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,651
They're just animals.

108
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:55,530
Incapable of social fitting.

109
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:59,767
So why should I feel anything to them.

110
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:05,622
Sonja, if I were to leave from here...

111
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,867
Would you come with me?

112
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:14,102
Leave?

113
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,756
Do not say that.
Do not even think it.

114
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:20,606
They will hunt you down and mark you
like all the others.

115
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:22,817
Not if I can remove this.

116
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:25,123
Look!

117
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:29,941
I made it.
This will be my freedom!

118
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,233
Lucian, promise me
you won't use it!

119
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:39,455
Please!
- Is that your answer then? You will not come?

120
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,046
So you want me to stay here for you?

121
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,664
Like this?
As an animal?

122
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,730
Lucian.

123
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:55,504
Vampire and Lycan, we are both
children of Corvinus.

124
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,576
But my family are slaves.

125
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:01,256
I will use this key ...

126
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:04,726
and will leave this place.

127
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:10,779
But I can never be without you now.

128
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:05,021
Any news of my daughter?
- It is hard to find.

129
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,340
She refuses to see me.

130
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,713
And she won't answer her door.
Why are the young so blind?

131
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,258
She risk her sit in the council
and for what?

132
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:17,239
I cannot imagine.

133
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:22,442
You must prepare, my lord.
Human's noble are on their way.

134
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:17,573
Its sharp.
No wolf will stand before it.

135
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:22,156
Ready the horses!

136
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,447
Let someone else go.
- Why?

137
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:28,702
Last night, after I left ...

138
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,750
Just let someone else go.

139
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:33,549
In case it has escape
your notice, blacksmith ...

140
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:37,193
I am quite capable of looking after myself.

141
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:43,813
And besides...

142
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:48,112
you can watch over me from the wall.

143
00:18:56,656 --> 00:19:00,324
Lady Sonja, your father has ordered
you to stay behind.

144
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,400
I intend to our guest safely
through the gate.

145
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:06,420
Gate Master!
- This is not a request.

146
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:08,211
Your father is ruler of the covenant.

147
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:12,133
So, he keeps reminding me.

148
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,471
Careful, blacksmith.
There's two eyes between your secret.

149
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,376
Shut it my child!
Shut it.

150
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:17,906
Get your men out there, now!
- Down boy. Your leech is too tight?

151
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,747
Step away!
- Its too many of them ...

152
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,858
They will be massacre!

153
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:29,730
Stop him!

154
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:56,521
Dimitri!

155
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:03,310
Lucian!

156
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:20,053
Sonja!

157
00:22:37,244 --> 00:22:40,739
Lucian, no!

158
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,490
No!

159
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,467
He did it to save me.

160
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:44,791
Am I not master of this house?

161
00:23:44,877 --> 00:23:47,684
You know you are forbidden
to remove your shuckle.

162
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,670
Yes.

163
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:52,882
Yet you break my law
after I gave you your life?

164
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:57,456
Your days of flush living are over!
Slave!

165
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:59,973
Father, leave him be.
I told you already ..

166
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,342
Hold your tongue!

167
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:06,074
You have to fight me
for the last time.

168
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,839
Get her outta here!

169
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:22,371
<i>Burn the bodies.
Burn them all.</i>

170
00:24:55,727 --> 00:25:00,653
<i> for removing the collar ...
30 lashes!</i>

171
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,962
You've stung me, Lycan,
with your betrayal.

172
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,388
You were like a son to me.

173
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:26,535
I gave you your life.
- You gave me chains.

174
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:30,523
I wouldn't thought that after all these years
you would have known ...

175
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:34,227
you can not have one
without the other.

176
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:39,920
Do it!

177
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,332
I've told you I'll be there
when you fell.

178
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:02,445
Stop this. He is one of our protectors ...
- They are just beast themselves.

179
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:05,189
This could stir up the others.
- Let them stir

180
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:08,070
Do you fear and believe me,
it will be worst if we do not punish them

181
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:11,316
Do you see now, Coloman?
You would trust them outside the walls?

182
00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:13,365
We can not even trust them inside!

183
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:16,844
By my count, that's 21.

184
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,787
Continue.

185
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:47,567
Stay away from him.
Or they'll punish you too.

186
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,217
Your concern for Lucian
was most touching.

187
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:10,274
A slave.
- He had just saved my life.

188
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,423
Was it not you, who told me to show
a little gratitude?

189
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:18,316
And yourself? Have you no gratitude
for the one who saved our daughter's life?

190
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:23,199
I am awashed with it
That it lives shows the breath of my Magnalimita.

191
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:29,165
Where it other circumstances, I would have had him
fed into pieces to his own kind.

192
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:32,355
But his punishment is now over.

193
00:28:33,852 --> 00:28:36,247
He will be freed.
- Freed?

194
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,642
Your judgement is clouded, Sonja.

195
00:28:38,728 --> 00:28:40,333
We did not keep order with sentiment.

196
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:44,009
Lucian forbidden to remove his collar
and yet he did so.

197
00:28:44,095 --> 00:28:47,441
For however finer reason ...

198
00:28:47,988 --> 00:28:50,760
he will remain in prison.

199
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,664
Janosh and other nobles
will soon arrive.

200
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:03,311
Your presence is expected.

201
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:11,837
I saw what you did out there.

202
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,591
Very brave ...
for human.

203
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,043
How you come across it preformed?

204
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,301
Only in stories.

205
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:30,505
Were you not afraid of them?
- Yes.

206
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:36,411
But I wanted to live.
- Are you afraid of me?

207
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,917
Yes.

208
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:44,131
Well then, help me.

209
00:29:44,722 --> 00:29:49,444
I will not bite.
Much.

210
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:54,485
You are like them?
- No.

211
00:29:57,245 --> 00:29:59,113
A Lycan, yes.
But not like them.

212
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:03,054
As you fought with tonight, were animals,
less born of William ...

213
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,016
a pure blood.

214
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:10,484
No trace of man left.
Savage, mindless beast.

215
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:15,032
As you are told.
- I saw you.

216
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:20,810
They obeyed you.

217
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:24,082
Yes.

218
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:28,180
Yes, they did.

219
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:46,551
You should not be here.
- I had to.

220
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,696
My love, I'm sorry.

221
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,397
I'm allright.

222
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:52,318
This is my fault.
If I had not gone out ...

223
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:55,345
Then you would not be who you are.

224
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:59,169
This is not your fault.

225
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:03,062
I can not remain here.
I have to leave this place.

226
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:04,903
My father will never permit.

227
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:07,407
And your death dealers?
Is there anyone you can trust?

228
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:11,059
Their loyalty to my father is much
greater than their loyalty to me.

229
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:14,334
Tannis?
- Tannis, can not be trusted.

230
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,853
No. Tannis know about us.

231
00:31:18,405 --> 00:31:20,287
How?
- I have no idea, but ...

232
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:23,724
if he has not told your father,
then that means he wants something.

233
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,934
Sonja, find out what it is.

234
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:54,697
Bring them in.

235
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:36,355
Janosh!

236
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,484
Do you not own
the largest silver mine in this land?

237
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,950
It has been overrun, my lord.

238
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:49,392
Our workers, infected, turned to beasts.

239
00:32:49,478 --> 00:32:52,892
Most unfortunate and costly.

240
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:58,439
I think half the rights to your mine
should cover the expense of our assistance.

241
00:32:58,525 --> 00:33:00,413
Your assistance?

242
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,839
We have all seen the fires
on the way here.

243
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:06,037
And have learned of the death of
baron Cavasher and his family.

244
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:09,103
The wolves are at your door as well.

245
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,103
So why should I
pay tribute?

246
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,873
You can not so much
protect your own house!

247
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:17,043
You are all but bled me dry already.

248
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,606
We have all heard the stories.

249
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:23,279
Look in his eyes!
They are true!

250
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:26,020
This place is cursed!

251
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:30,691
They are no more human than the
devils that invade our land!

252
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:33,920
If devil you should call us rest assure ...

253
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:36,380
better the devil you know.

254
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:39,648
Unhand me!
- Certainly.

255
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:51,285
Will anyone else like to be heard?

256
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:32,409
We are not animals!

257
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:38,164
Is this what you want?
Be their entertainment, their play things?

258
00:34:38,752 --> 00:34:40,864
Their pets?

259
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,510
Cowering beneath the whip ...

260
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,289
and then fighting amongst ourselves?

261
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:50,216
Is this what you want?

262
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,600
I live by their rules
my entire life.

263
00:34:57,259 --> 00:35:00,638
I'd protected them,
envied them...

264
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,029
And for what?

265
00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:05,986
To be treated like an animal.

266
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,632
We are not animals!

267
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:12,460
We do have a choice!

268
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:16,037
We can choose
to be more than this!

269
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:18,388
We can be slaves ...

270
00:35:18,836 --> 00:35:22,043
or we can be Lycans!

271
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:31,254
The mourning is upon us, my child.

272
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:35,036
it's time that we
leave this night behind.

273
00:35:35,122 --> 00:35:38,819
Gladly.
- There are some difficult decisions ahead.

274
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:40,905
I would like your help with one of them.

275
00:35:40,991 --> 00:35:42,822
Of course, Father.

276
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,111
With Lucian gone...

277
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:48,354
we must promote another Lycan
in his place.

278
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:50,905
Gone?

279
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:53,462
Coloman think will
stir the others.

280
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:55,741
We must remove him.

281
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:01,125
That will be difficult.

282
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:05,191
He has been with us so long.

283
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,781
Perhaps, Gyorg.

284
00:36:15,226 --> 00:36:17,153
Or Thrasos.

285
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:21,178
They would be...

286
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:25,525
trustworthy.
- Excellent suggestions.

287
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,975
I will  consider them strongly.

288
00:36:56,748 --> 00:37:02,153
<i> You, my child, are
the most precious thing in my heart.</i>

289
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:27,386
What did you told my father?

290
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:29,414
What have you told him?
- Nothing.

291
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,018
Why?
- Why what?

292
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:33,913
Why have you told him nothing?

293
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:37,988
Would your father welcome the man
who bought him the news...

294
00:37:38,074 --> 00:37:40,843
that his beloved daughter was consorting with ...

295
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,462
a Lycan?

296
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:50,739
He isn't well known
for his "gratitude".

297
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:06,076
And I am not yet in a position
to use this for my benefit.

298
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:11,488
What sort of benefit?

299
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:18,159
There are 12 council seats.
- And we don't die often.

300
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,255
Sadly, no.

301
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:24,688
So what if I give up my seat on the Council
and this simply left it to you?

302
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:28,973
Why would you do that?
- Can you keep a secret?

303
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:35,053
I would need something in return.

304
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,264
Two minutes. Any longer is too risky.

305
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:09,906
I'm sorry.
There was no other way.

306
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,423
Tannis?

307
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:20,042
You were right. He will helps us in exchange
for a sit on the council.

308
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:21,948
And your father knows nothing?
- I'm sure!

309
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:24,438
Sonja, this is won't work!
Lucian it has to.

310
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:28,052
A knew some of the others will come with me:
Sabas and Xristo, the human race.

311
00:39:28,138 --> 00:39:30,520
My Love, Lucian there is no time!

312
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:33,814
My father will have you killed tomorrow
after the humans return.

313
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,390
You must leave at sunrise.

314
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,908
And you?
- The important thing is that you stay alive.

315
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:42,896
The best chance you have is when
Victor and death dealers are sleep.

316
00:39:42,982 --> 00:39:45,160
I will be safe with my father side when you go.

317
00:39:45,246 --> 00:39:46,852
Hurry!

318
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:49,678
If this plan works, I'll met you in
three days time after the sunsets.

319
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:52,662
There is a clearing by the river.
I'll meet you there.

320
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:03,539
And if it doesn't?
- I will meet at the clearing.

321
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,958
Get up.
Dumb animals.

322
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:34,480
Be brave.

323
00:40:39,548 --> 00:40:42,166
You know what your problem is?

324
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:47,907
You don't understand the natural order
of things.

325
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,672
Things changed.

326
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,362
Be ready when they do.

327
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:02,794
Consider it a parting gift.

328
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:45,036
Wait!

329
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:50,973
Do you not realize
this a gift I'm giving you?

330
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:53,386
It is a curse!

331
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:07,845
What have they done to us?
-You'll find out soon enough.

332
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:11,126
They turned us into them, like you?

333
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:12,581
Yes.

334
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:16,565
Why?
- He wants to use you for his own protection.

335
00:42:16,651 --> 00:42:20,868
I would die first.

336
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:25,111
The time has come. By sunrise
I leave this place.

337
00:42:25,197 --> 00:42:28,211
And if you are willing to take the risk,
you may follow me

338
00:42:32,106 --> 00:42:35,913
There is a new life waiting
behind these walls, my friend.

339
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:39,285
And you can be a part of it.
One of us.

340
00:42:39,371 --> 00:42:42,459
Or stay and serve them.

341
00:42:52,498 --> 00:42:55,812
New dogs today.
Let's see how they look.

342
00:42:55,898 --> 00:42:57,796
It come too late.

343
00:42:57,882 --> 00:42:59,911
He's already gone.

344
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:35,234
Are you with me?

345
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:12,246
Sabas, Xristo, free the others
The rest of you, with me!

346
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:21,607
Freedom is yours.
Move!

347
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:28,360
This way!

348
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,706
Right Here!

349
00:44:56,654 --> 00:44:58,572
Run! Run!

350
00:45:07,614 --> 00:45:10,946
Keep moving!

351
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,568
Raze!

352
00:46:03,272 --> 00:46:06,178
There is nothing you can do!

353
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:09,878
I will come back. I promise you!

354
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:12,034
No!

355
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:17,148
My lord!

356
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:24,293
My lord, Lucian has escaped.

357
00:46:50,152 --> 00:46:51,657
The forest, go!

358
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:53,918
Go!

359
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,392
My lord!

360
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:35,237
Move! Move!

361
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:42,884
Tannis!

362
00:47:43,086 --> 00:47:44,638
Come on, come on!

363
00:47:44,724 --> 00:47:46,775
Yes, my lord?

364
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:49,508
Where is the key
I gave you for this?

365
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,262
I locked it in the armory myself

366
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:53,550
How then is it open?

367
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:56,936
I have no idea.
- I think I have.

368
00:47:57,848 --> 00:48:00,015
Kill him!
- No!

369
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:02,394
Please ...

370
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,347
Check the armory.

371
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:09,013
There has to be an explanation.

372
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:20,649
I have never been outside the walls.

373
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,983
Enjoy it while you can Xristo,

374
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,649
because soon enough we
got to fight our way back in.

375
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:28,243
We did not all make it out.
Now, we will not leave or brothers rot back there.

376
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:31,208
We have humiliated Viktor
they will pay the cost.

377
00:48:31,294 --> 00:48:33,560
We were lucky to make it
out alive

378
00:48:33,646 --> 00:48:37,765
There is a handful of us, we have no weapons.
- true.

379
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:40,747
The nobles had brought you here
can you lead us back to its state?

380
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,333
Yes.
- Good. Come on.

381
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:14,780
It has to be here.

382
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:25,350
Here.

383
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:30,692
He must have made another one.

384
00:49:31,908 --> 00:49:34,873
I never doubted you.

385
00:49:41,994 --> 00:49:45,468
I have no wish one shuckle
to remove around your neck

386
00:49:45,554 --> 00:49:48,774
only to replace it
with one of my own.

387
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,288
You have a choice.

388
00:49:50,374 --> 00:49:54,274
You can run away and hide
or stay and fight.

389
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,178
Any man who fights with me
shall have his freedom ...

390
00:49:58,264 --> 00:50:03,058
and if he wishes it...
immortality.

391
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,607
There are other states
to the west of here.

392
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:25,175
I want you to go there.
See how much will join us.

393
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:29,459
I will meet you back here
in two days time.

394
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,147
Father!

395
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:52,625
Did I startle you?
- No!

396
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:56,759
You did not.
- It occurs to me ...

397
00:52:56,845 --> 00:53:00,867
That I had been thoughtless.

398
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,728
So deep about being in my own
anguish of Lucian's betrayal

399
00:53:05,814 --> 00:53:08,559
I gave no thought ...

400
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:11,483
to your feelings.

401
00:53:11,569 --> 00:53:15,652
My feelings?
- They worm their way into our lives ...

402
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:19,379
and we forget...

403
00:53:20,216 --> 00:53:23,328
I myself had feelings towards Lucian.

404
00:53:23,414 --> 00:53:28,532
It could had been anything
but "death dealer" perhaps.

405
00:53:28,854 --> 00:53:31,424
Yes.

406
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:34,877
Perhaps.

407
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:39,072
But he was not as we hoped.

408
00:53:39,158 --> 00:53:42,043
Was it?

409
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:47,211
Did you help him escape?

410
00:53:48,396 --> 00:53:50,867
Help him?

411
00:53:50,953 --> 00:53:53,484
Of course not!

412
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:57,874
Are you lying to me?

413
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,874
There are many things
That I have done against you.

414
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,913
But he is a Lycan.

415
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:11,083
I'm sorry, my dear ...

416
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:14,886
but you leave me no choice.

417
00:54:23,781 --> 00:54:26,526
Father, please!

418
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:28,560
I wanted to believe your lies!

419
00:54:28,646 --> 00:54:31,273
But I knew it cannot be true,
not my own daughter

420
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,530
How could you?
- Father ...

421
00:54:35,298 --> 00:54:41,345
I love him.
- No! You have betrayed me!

422
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:45,178
To be with an animal!

423
00:54:45,264 --> 00:54:49,686
I love you more
than anything!

424
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:53,664
She does not leave this room.

425
00:55:11,202 --> 00:55:14,137
We have received orders
to wait.

426
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:24,650
At this rate, we'll have enough
men by the end of the week.

427
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:28,852
Is there have been any sign of Sonja?
- Nothing.

428
00:55:31,552 --> 00:55:32,927
She should been here by now.

429
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:36,217
With all due respect, Lucian, I do not see
why we are waiting for her.

430
00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:37,715
She is not one of us.

431
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,943
Have you forgotten she was the one
who set us free?

432
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,239
But she is a vampire.

433
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:46,382
She has deceived you.
She could lead him here!

434
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,976
Death dealers were undoubtedly
beyond the hunt.

435
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:54,281
And they will eventually find us.
But not by her doing.

436
00:55:58,434 --> 00:56:02,840
I trust Sonja with my life
and as long as I make command, so shall you.

437
00:56:05,522 --> 00:56:08,479
I told you not to say anything.

438
00:56:11,277 --> 00:56:14,088
Lucian has sack two estates in brashoff, my lord.

439
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:16,644
And has made up with
the contents of their armories.

440
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:19,499
The slaves had joined his ranks.
- Freedom is as much as deceased...

441
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,500
as William's pestilents.
- You need to bring your pet back.

442
00:56:22,586 --> 00:56:25,655
Thank you, Coloman!
The obvious escape man.

443
00:56:25,741 --> 00:56:31,925
I do not need to lift a finger.
Lucian will return as of his own free will.

444
00:56:33,177 --> 00:56:36,755
I have something he wants.

445
00:56:37,552 --> 00:56:39,866
My Lady.

446
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,524
Luka!
What is it? Where is she?

447
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,800
Sonja has been arrested.

448
00:56:55,352 --> 00:56:58,775
He knows about the two of you.

449
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:01,351
He will kill her.

450
00:57:01,437 --> 00:57:03,966
I thought you should know.

451
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:25,735
Nothing in, my lord.

452
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:31,803
It is a trap and you know that.
- I will not let her die alone.

453
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:34,648
They followed you here, Lucian.
If you go we will lose.

454
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:37,178
Let me tell you a secret, my friend.
The only thought they followed me ...

455
00:57:37,264 --> 00:57:40,901
But they truly followed is the idea of being free free.
That is what brought them here.

456
00:57:40,987 --> 00:57:42,857
You can hold them together until I get back.

457
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:45,559
And they leave them if I do not.

458
00:59:42,842 --> 00:59:45,344
Are you alright?
- Yes.

459
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:49,404
Lucian, you were Free
- Not without you.

460
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:52,526
We have to go now!

461
01:00:27,431 --> 01:00:29,627
My lord!

462
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:35,236
Your daughter has escaped.
- Yes, of course.

463
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:01,634
This way!

464
01:01:08,405 --> 01:01:11,478
That one!
- Yes!

465
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:49,263
Now!

466
01:02:33,108 --> 01:02:35,631
How dare you rise your hand to me?

467
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:38,569
I do not want this.
- I am your father!

468
01:02:51,845 --> 01:02:56,586
Think you can defeat me?
I don't want to defeat you ...

469
01:03:08,335 --> 01:03:10,923
Killing me won't save
your precious Lycan.

470
01:03:11,009 --> 01:03:15,265
Please call up your men!
For the sake of your grandchild!

471
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,711
A miracle, father!

472
01:03:22,797 --> 01:03:25,561
A union of the bloodlines.

473
01:03:29,018 --> 01:03:30,607
I curse the day
that your mother gave her life ...

474
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:32,523
and to bring you into this world.

475
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:35,558
That thing inside you ...

476
01:03:35,886 --> 01:03:38,711
is a monster!

477
01:03:40,735 --> 01:03:43,026
Sonja!

478
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:46,183
This is over. Remove him!

479
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:51,287
Do you understand what you done?
This night was not about you, It was about him.

480
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:55,370
I could have given Lucian to the council
and need never have known of your indepression.

481
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:58,060
But after this, never!

482
01:04:00,632 --> 01:04:03,357
No!

483
01:04:12,364 --> 01:04:16,682
If I had not left none
of this would have happened.

484
01:04:17,548 --> 01:04:20,178
And you would not be who you are.

485
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:22,704
You're right.

486
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:25,680
Noone should live a life like this.

487
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:29,132
Some are free, because to you.

488
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:33,021
Things are forever changed
for this is what you had done.

489
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:35,546
But I have failed you!
- No.

490
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:37,855
Lucian, my love ...

491
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:41,601
You have not failed me.

492
01:04:43,228 --> 01:04:46,043
The choices I made
have led me here.

493
01:04:46,129 --> 01:04:48,415
Not you.

494
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:53,253
This are the risk you are willing to take for me.

495
01:04:54,567 --> 01:04:56,468
I would also do for you.

496
01:04:56,554 --> 01:04:58,911
For us.

497
01:04:59,722 --> 01:05:02,316
Open the door!

498
01:05:04,158 --> 01:05:05,375
No.
- Get her!

499
01:05:05,461 --> 01:05:07,120
No. No!

500
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:08,461
No!

501
01:05:08,546 --> 01:05:12,023
I kill you!
All of you!

502
01:05:36,088 --> 01:05:39,836
The accused has committed high treason
against this covenant.

503
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,240
She has consorted with animals!

504
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:48,666
She has something to make their escape.
- I have saved this covenant many times over.

505
01:05:48,752 --> 01:05:51,188
You have killed your own kind!

506
01:05:51,274 --> 01:05:57,735
And you've comingled bloodlines
resulting in the thing germinating within you.

507
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:01,586
Your past glory doesn't excuse
your present guilt...

508
01:06:01,782 --> 01:06:04,898
nor your station as a council member.

509
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:09,467
The punishment for these crimes,
is death!

510
01:06:18,758 --> 01:06:20,550
I.

511
01:06:20,636 --> 01:06:21,934
I.
- I.

512
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,071
I.
- I.

513
01:06:28,126 --> 01:06:30,856
She is your daughter.

514
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:42,182
I.

515
01:06:42,268 --> 01:06:44,252
Take her to the chamber!

516
01:06:44,615 --> 01:06:48,162
No!
You can not do this!

517
01:06:49,984 --> 01:06:53,326
Viktor.
Viktor, no!

518
01:06:53,412 --> 01:06:56,484
No, Viktor!

519
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:49,103
No!

520
01:08:43,299 --> 01:08:45,711
Lucian!

521
01:09:12,312 --> 01:09:15,643
No, Sonja!
Just.. Just look at me!

522
01:09:15,729 --> 01:09:18,963
Keep your eyes on me.
Sonja, look at me!

523
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,812
I love you.

524
01:09:31,324 --> 01:09:34,039
And I love you.

525
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:51,930
Goodbye, my love!

526
01:09:53,371 --> 01:09:55,330
No!

527
01:10:00,308 --> 01:10:02,930
No!

528
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:06,939
No!

529
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:11,019
No!

530
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:16,472
Sonja!

531
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:54,035
my knives.
- Yes.

532
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,863
My lord.

533
01:15:58,276 --> 01:16:01,570
Freed the others.
Go!

534
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:12,032
Follow me!

535
01:16:15,835 --> 01:16:18,274
You want your revenge?
- Yes!

536
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,141
Its out there.
Now go!

537
01:16:44,986 --> 01:16:48,402
We have greater concerns
than your precious scrolls!

538
01:16:48,488 --> 01:16:50,898
Go to the elders.
Now!

539
01:17:19,997 --> 01:17:23,906
Kill that dog!

540
01:17:24,002 --> 01:17:26,322
Viktor.

541
01:18:49,567 --> 01:18:52,391
You have defiled my daughter!
- I loved her!

542
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:55,395
You killed her!

543
01:20:05,692 --> 01:20:09,070
I should have crushed you under  my heel
the day you were born.

544
01:20:09,156 --> 01:20:12,889
Yes, you should have.

545
01:20:16,827 --> 01:20:19,717
But you didn't!

546
01:21:08,324 --> 01:21:10,767
Lucian!

547
01:21:10,953 --> 01:21:14,105
Lucian!

548
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:26,860
Lucian ...

549
01:21:26,946 --> 01:21:29,664
it is finished.

550
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:33,938
No.

551
01:21:34,446 --> 01:21:37,816
This is just the beginning.

552
01:22:33,887 --> 01:22:38,409
<i> Let me tell you of something
about your beloved dark father...</i>

553
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,212
<i> He is the one
that killed your family...</i>

554
01:22:42,298 --> 01:22:44,544
<i> not the Lycans. </i>

555
01:22:44,788 --> 01:22:46,936
<i> But when he got to you ...</i>

556
01:22:47,022 --> 01:22:51,224
<i> he just couldn't bear the thought
draining you to dry. </i>

557
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:56,708
<i> You reminded him so much
his precious Sonja.</i>

558
01:22:57,455 --> 01:23:01,929
<i>The daughter he
condemed to death. </i>

559
01:23:02,305 --> 01:23:08,644
