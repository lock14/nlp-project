1
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,600
Did you see it? I think I got it.

2
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
That little piggy was fast.

3
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,901
Hey, everybody, this is all of our kill.
We all take credit.

4
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,701
- I got a side ache.
- You hit Enmebaragesi.

5
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,001
I'm pretty sure he had that
when he left the village.

6
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,601
That's not my spear.

7
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:20,201
My spear has feathers...
Okay, that one's got a feather.

8
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:22,801
Okay, that is my spear.
I'm sorry, man.

9
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:26,702
Great. Two spears.
Twice the killing power.

10
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:30,902
Thanks a lot.
Next time don't block my shot.

11
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:35,302
What? I didn't say...
Come on, not my fault.

12
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:38,102
Who stands in front of a boar
on a hunt?

13
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:47,203
Hey, there you are.

14
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:50,803
I don't think you wanna be gathered.
You wanna be eaten.

15
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:56,403
Hi, Marlak.

16
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,603
Well, there won't be any berries
in the fruit salad now, so we all lose.

17
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:03,303
Hey, Oh. How's it going?

18
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:05,704
Hunters think they're so cool.
You know, they...

19
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:09,404
They don't think this is challenging?
Gathering? It's extremely challenging.

20
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:13,004
You have to find all the fruit with
the least amount of bird shit on it...

21
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:14,404
...and put it in the basket.

22
00:03:14,604 --> 00:03:15,704
Are they picking on you?

23
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,404
If they're picking on you,
I will straighten them out.

24
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:21,004
- All right. Yeah, would you?
- You're right.

25
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:22,504
Let it slide this time.

26
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,705
Next time, though, they will feel the tip
of my short spear.

27
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:30,205
- What happened to your spear?
- I modified it. Made it a snub nose.

28
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:34,405
It's lighter. It's a better killing tool.
Anyway...

29
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:37,905
Oh, there's Maya.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

30
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:41,906
I'll be right back.
Unless something goes horribly right.

31
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:46,206
- Hello, Maya.
- Hey, Zed.

32
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:48,906
What do I gotta do
to make you my woman?

33
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:55,206
Look, you're a special guy.
You've got a lot of personality.

34
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,506
When my parents
were killed by that pack of wild dogs...

35
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,407
...you really helped me
see the funny side.

36
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:05,007
"No, no! He's got my ankle!"

37
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:09,407
"Get off. " That's your mom.

38
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:14,707
So, yeah, you make me laugh,
but that's not enough.

39
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:16,507
I'm an old-fashioned kind of girl.

40
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:19,607
I need a man who can protect me
and take care of me.

41
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:21,308
What do you mean?
Like Marlak?

42
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:24,208
Well, I mean, he is the best hunter
in the village.

43
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:26,208
- Debatable.
- People voted.

44
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,408
Maybe I'm not the greatest hunter.

45
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:31,008
- Or gatherer.
- Yes. Or gatherer.

46
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,608
Zed, those are the only two jobs
that we have here.

47
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:36,608
I can take care of you.
Does it look like I'm starving?

48
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:40,509
Come on.
Tell me you can say no to this.

49
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,909
Give it a second. Let it work on you.

50
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,309
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely can say no to that.

51
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,509
Maya. Can I see you later?

52
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,409
I think I have to wash my hair.

53
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,810
You washed your hair last year.

54
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,810
Tonight, we feast.

55
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,310
Maya. For you.

56
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,010
Thanks, Marlak.
Another severed boar's head.

57
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,311
- It's a different color.
- Yeah, this one is...

58
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:21,711
- Left the tongue in.
- Yeah, this is really nice, Marlak.

59
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:25,811
Look at Marlak flirting with Maya.
He doesn't know her at all.

60
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,911
Head's not even the best part
of the boar.

61
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:32,811
It's the back fat, stupid.
Muscleheaded idiot.

62
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:37,312
Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema.

63
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:41,212
Yeah. She doesn't even know I exist.

64
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:44,112
There's like 60 people
in the village. I mean...

65
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:47,412
...you have to go out of your way
to not know that somebody exists.

66
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,612
I just wanna lay with her so badly.

67
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:53,112
I don't see it. She's cute,
but I don't think I'd lay with her.

68
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:56,313
She's your sister. I mean,
that'd be like laying with your mother.

69
00:05:56,513 --> 00:05:59,413
Which was a big mistake.
I see that now.

70
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:04,113
You think it's not gonna be awkward
in the morning, but... Trust me, wow.

71
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,913
Listen, you wanna impress Eema?
Do the fertility dance with her...

72
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:11,413
...at the feast tonight
then drag her back to your hut.

73
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:14,213
My hut's a mess right now,
and what if she struggles?

74
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:17,114
You give her a little tap on the head.
Women respond to that.

75
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:19,114
I still live with my parents.

76
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:22,214
I don't wanna keep them up all night
with my raucous lovemaking.

77
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:25,014
I'd get an earful in the morning.
She only likes hunters.

78
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:28,214
She doesn't like gatherers.
She's a gatherer herself is the irony.

79
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:29,914
She's a self-loathing gatherer.

80
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:36,315
- That's pretty suggestive.
- I wouldn't read too much into that.

81
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,315
Okay, now she's just asking
for some splinters.

82
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:43,915
Hey, hey... Squanto.
Give me a break, would you?

83
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:46,315
You got the whole forest.

84
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:49,615
Why does everybody always have
to take a crap right behind my hut?

85
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:53,916
I could be wrong, I think what it is
is that all the poop in the area...

86
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:58,416
...fertilizes the ground and it gives
the leaves a softer feel for wiping.

87
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:03,016
It's not that nobody respects you.
I haven't heard that from everyone.

88
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,816
I've had it. Let's go.

89
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:08,216
Where are we going?
We're not supposed to go this far.

90
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:10,816
I'm sick of the whole village
treating me like a joke.

91
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,317
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Change villages.

92
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,217
No. I'm gonna change my head.

93
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,817
I don't think that's possible.
Your head is attached to your body.

94
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:22,717
Not the whole head.
I mean, my mind.

95
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,017
Mind...

96
00:07:24,217 --> 00:07:26,817
Don't tell me you're thinking
about eating forbidden fruit.

97
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:29,517
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

98
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,718
Zed, that's the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

99
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,218
You don't eat from that one.
It's forbidden.

100
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:36,618
But why is it forbidden?

101
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:38,718
What is it they don't want us
to have?

102
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:42,318
It's not the fruit. It's about the rule.
It's about doing what you're told.

103
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:44,918
We've been doing what we were told
our entire lives.

104
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,618
- How's that worked out?
- I like doing what I'm told.

105
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,119
It gives my day
some much-needed structure. Wait.

106
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,019
Zed. Stop.
It's just a piece of fruit.

107
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,219
Eating a fruit
is not gonna change your life.

108
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,219
What if it's magic fruit?

109
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,219
What if this makes me the smartest
man the village has ever known?

110
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,719
That's a pretty low bar.

111
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,219
Then all the hunters
would have to bow down to me.

112
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,919
Maya would lay with me like that.

113
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,019
That's what this is about?
Laying with Maya?

114
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:10,820
I have a great destiny,
I'm about to find out what it is.

115
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,120
Put the fruit down.
What if somebody sees us?

116
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,120
They'll peel our skin off
and tie us to an anthill.

117
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,620
Now you've done it.

118
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,820
It's got sort of a knowledge-y taste.

119
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,920
Does it have a sort of forbidden taste?
That's what it is.

120
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,121
- Oh, I definitely feel something.
- What?

121
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:34,921
Less hungry, for one,
but also more intelligenter.

122
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,221
It's like
I feel like maybe I know everything.

123
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:43,521
Ask me something. Anything. Go.
Test me. Go.

124
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,921
All right, where does the sun go
at night?

125
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:48,222
Pass. Next question.

126
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,722
- Okay, where do babies come from?
- Pass. Next question.

127
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,122
- There's a snake on my foot.
- In the form of a question.

128
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:58,122
There's a snake on my foot?

129
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,922
- Correct.
- What do I do?

130
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:06,223
I got a lot of ideas. I'm bursting
with ideas on the subject.

131
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,923
- It's constricting me.
- You could stick your finger in its hole.

132
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:12,923
You know what, you could eat it
before it eats you. Try that.

133
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,723
Eat the snake first.
That's what my new brain tells me.

134
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,023
- It's preparing to eat me.
- Go for the eyes.

135
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:20,123
It's big.

136
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:22,523
Zed, please help me.

137
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,024
I'm dying a virgin.

138
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:29,524
Wait right here.
I'm gonna go eat more fruit.

139
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:47,125
- This was a bit of a rough day for me.
- Yeah. There's gotta be more to life.

140
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:50,325
This is a lot. I don't think I can handle
too much more than this.

141
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,625
No way. Look at these people.

142
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,225
They're like animals.
We're way too good for this.

143
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,825
Now that I'm smarter
I'm going straight to the top.

144
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:01,225
I'm bringing you.
You're gonna be my right hand.

145
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,726
I've seen what you do
with your right hand. No.

146
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:06,626
Don't you wonder what's on
the other side of the mountains?

147
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:09,426
There's nothing on the other side
of the mountains, okay?

148
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,826
The world ends. Everybody
knows that. You'd fall right off of it.

149
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,226
But what if it doesn't?

150
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:17,126
It makes my stomach go:

151
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,626
I've been thinking a lot
ever since I ate that fruit.

152
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:23,227
Why is there fruit? What is fruit?

153
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:26,527
It's a thing that you eat.
Why do we eat?

154
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:30,127
What are we? What are we?
Why do I have these?

155
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,227
Everything is weird.

156
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:36,027
When you really stop and look at it,
everything gets very, very strange...

157
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,627
Why am I talking? What is this?

158
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:40,027
My lips make a movement
and then a sound...

159
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,128
...and you know what I mean.

160
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:44,128
Blows my mind.

161
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:48,228
That just sounds like crazy fruit talk.
I don't wanna hear it right now.

162
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,428
Boy, she looks nice tonight.

163
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:55,328
Do it, man. Dance for her.

164
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:57,628
I don't know.
They're doing the jackal dance.

165
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,228
It's not my strongest.

166
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,729
What, are you kidding me?
You have an amazing jackal dance.

167
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,929
Go. Jackal dance.

168
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,230
Get into it.

169
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,430
<i>Over the head.</i>

170
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:57,532
I'm gonna go and eat.
I'm gonna come back.

171
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:04,632
Your father was a great hunter.
But you, you're like a little girl.

172
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,132
Good one, Marlak.

173
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:11,432
Enmebaragesi says
he saw you in the garden.

174
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:14,832
Really? Well, what if I told you
that Enmebaragesi was a liar?

175
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:17,533
I saw him eat the forbidden fruit.

176
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:20,233
Oh, that.

177
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:25,633
- Hey, what's going on here?
- I will kill you where you stand.

178
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,633
Oh, a shooting star. That's the best.

179
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,634
- You really ate the fruit?
- One bite. What's the big deal?

180
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:47,034
You don't eat the fruit.

181
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,634
It's the number one rule
since the beginning of time.

182
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:52,934
Since the Great Turtle climbed out
of the sea with Earth on its back.

183
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:56,035
I know, but I'm a little fuzzy
on the exact details.

184
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,735
Forbidden. Forbidden fruit.

185
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:04,635
You ate... You did the one thing
you're not supposed to do. Forbidden.

186
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:08,635
But the word "forbidden" implies
there's a little wiggle room.

187
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,935
There's no wiggle room
with forbidden. You're cursed, man.

188
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:16,436
If you stay here, we'll all be cursed.
You have to leave.

189
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:19,236
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I didn't eat the fruit.

190
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:20,436
My hands are tied.

191
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:24,136
I know I'm being a dick right now, man,
but I'm just trying to help you.

192
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,636
Do I detect a little bit of jealousy
because I now have...

193
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:29,136
...the knowledge of good and evil
and you don't?

194
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:32,336
You think it's easy being the shaman
of the village?

195
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:34,537
You think I like putting on
a boar's head every morning?

196
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:36,537
Putting a bone through my face?

197
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:39,837
I know we've known each other for
a long time. We throw the rock around.

198
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:43,637
We have fun together, man,
but I can't be...

199
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:45,037
You know what I mean?

200
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:49,337
Plus, wanna know something?
I am high as shit right now, dude.

201
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,938
I just licked like three toads.

202
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:55,238
I've been up for like 27 suns up
and suns downs.

203
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:57,338
- Okay.
- I just wanna get a meal...

204
00:13:57,538 --> 00:14:00,238
...I wanna take a fucking nap.
- This is bullshit.

205
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:04,138
You really... You fucked the pooch
on this one.

206
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,838
- Hard.
- I say what I did...

207
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,138
...was a good thing.
- Oh, yeah?

208
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:11,039
Yeah. Really, really very good thing.

209
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,739
And I should know because I have
the knowledge of good and evil.

210
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,239
- Oh, okay.
- So I ought to know...

211
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,039
...when I know what I'm saying
is what I know what I'm saying.

212
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,139
- Good.
- And I'm not leaving.

213
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,039
You better get out of here.

214
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,640
Okay, but before I go,
I just wanna say one thing.

215
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,340
I know I'm not the greatest hunter.

216
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,040
- Or gatherer.
- Or gatherer. Thank you.

217
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,840
But there's gotta be more to life
than this.

218
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,840
I'm going, but because I choose to.

219
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,440
And anyone who wants to join me
is welcome.

220
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,741
I don't know where we're going,
but I will lead us.

221
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:54,041
Yeah, light up the darkness.

222
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:56,041
So who's with me?

223
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,641
Anyone?

224
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:04,441
Anyone named Oh?

225
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:08,442
Okay. Looks like
I'm gonna be going it alone.

226
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,042
Which is fine with me.

227
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,642
Better, in fact...

228
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:14,642
...because having a partner
would just probably slow me down.

229
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,842
I'm gonna start a new tribe,
10 times better.

230
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,342
There's gonna be 10 times
more dancing and fun.

231
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:25,542
It's gonna be called Muscle Tribe
of Danger and Excellence.

232
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:29,643
And you're not invited. I don't even like
any of you guys. I never did.

233
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:33,843
Unless anyone changes their mind.
Does anyone wanna come?

234
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,343
- We're good.
- Fine. Good. Bye-bye.

235
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,143
Don't... Nobody panic.

236
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:52,444
No! That's... That's...
Oh, it's not my house.

237
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:23,445
I see you.

238
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:28,746
Go away, Marlak.

239
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,946
- Really, animal noises?
- Badger.

240
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:37,346
This is just insulting.
It's time I killed you.

241
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,946
Fine. But then, tell me this:
Who's that behind you?

242
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:43,747
You think I'm gonna turn around?
I'm gonna gut you like a pig.

243
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:54,347
Nice whack on the head.
You should try hitting Eema that hard.

244
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,947
We can discuss that later.
We should run away.

245
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,247
Yes, yes, of course.

246
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:04,648
So you decided to come after all.
Was it the speech?

247
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:07,948
- It was the fire. I lost everything.
- Yeah.

248
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:09,548
I wish we didn't have to leave.

249
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:11,448
Probably never gonna see
Eema again.

250
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:14,848
That's not true. We'll go back.

251
00:17:14,948 --> 00:17:16,748
Those hunters are idiots.

252
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:19,148
They're gonna forget the whole thing
in an hour.

253
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:21,749
Will you get real, man?
There's no going back, okay?

254
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,449
There's nothing to go back to.
It's just ashes.

255
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,849
Like it's hard to build
one of those huts.

256
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,749
It's just a pile of sticks and dung.

257
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:31,549
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung.

258
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:34,849
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's okay.

259
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,449
- I don't mean that, obviously.
- I know you're mad...

260
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,849
...but this is a great
opportunity for us.

261
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:42,150
They didn't appreciate you
back there.

262
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,450
You're the genius who thought up
drinking water from a gourd.

263
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,450
They were all drinking from their
hands.

264
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,350
Well, it just seems practical.
I mean, I don't know.

265
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,750
We have an incredible destiny.

266
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,450
You don't even know where we are.
We're lost.

267
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,851
Of course I know where we are.

268
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:06,751
It's a cougar.
Don't move a muscle.

269
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:09,551
- What do we do?
- Don't move your lips.

270
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:13,551
Rule number one: Show no fear.

271
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:14,951
You're showing fear.

272
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,152
Much better. Very good.

273
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:22,252
- Now what?
- There's two opinions on this one.

274
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:26,552
Some say run,
others say stay perfectly still.

275
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:32,152
- Which one are you gonna do?
- I'm going to run!

276
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:53,053
You should put some maggots
on those scratches.

277
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:54,653
They look pretty deep.

278
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:57,754
They are very deep.
That's why they appear that way.

279
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,354
- You're still mad at me, aren't you?
- I wish I hadn't come.

280
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:02,954
Maybe you shouldn't have come...

281
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:05,854
...if you're gonna keep whining
about every little cougar...

282
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:07,654
...that attacks you.

283
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:13,254
Oh, what does this look like?

284
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,555
You making your own fire?

285
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,055
No, I'm making arrows.
We're gonna need them.

286
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:21,455
- You still coming?
- Yeah.

287
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:25,055
Yeah!

288
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:30,755
Yeah. You're my buddy. Yeah.

289
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,655
You're saying we're gonna walk...

290
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,856
...and eventually we're gonna get
to a spot where the world ends...

291
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:39,056
...and it's like... What is it?
What are we looking at?

292
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:42,656
First of all, why are you talking to me
in that tone like I'm an idiot?

293
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:44,456
This is general knowledge.

294
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:57,757
- I knew it!
- This is incredible.

295
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,857
You still think the world just ends?

296
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,857
Come on, admit it. The fruit man
has the knowledge.

297
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:05,157
Whoa, whoa, be careful.

298
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,557
Did you learn a lot when you ate
the fruit?

299
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:13,758
Yeah. I can see, like, 10 minutes
into the future now.

300
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,258
- So what am I doing in ten minutes?
- You're having sex with a zebra.

301
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,958
- That's not funny.
- I'm not joking.

302
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:21,258
Hope you're ready to bone some zeeb.

303
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,158
People. More than one.

304
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,558
Walking that way.

305
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:32,159
You think? There's about
a thousand footprints there.

306
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,559
- I mean, it's kind of obvious.
- Oh, yes.

307
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,859
- They stopped here to poop. Look.
- No, I don't want to.

308
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,359
Two men, maybe three. A child.
Or a small woman, maybe.

309
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,359
What are you doing?
You don't know where that's been.

310
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,659
- I know where it's been.
- Don't touch it.

311
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:49,859
You don't know if a squirrel
has peed on it.

312
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:52,860
Still warm.
Almost hot in the center.

313
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Looks like they had some nuts.
Apples, maybe.

314
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
What are you doing?

315
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
- Yep, apples.
- What difference does it make?

316
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
That doesn't help us to know that.

317
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,160
You can tell if they ate some shit.
There's a lot of shit in that shit.

318
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,761
My mistake, this is bear poop.

319
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:13,761
What's that, though?

320
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,861
This one's mine.

321
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,361
Tonight, we feast.

322
00:21:39,162 --> 00:21:40,762
We're gonna need
some arrowheads.

323
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:50,763
This is where you die!

324
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,063
Easy, easy.

325
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:58,463
He won't get far.

326
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:03,363
- Did you shoot my cow?
- Oh, no.

327
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:07,063
Yes. Well, we're hunters.

328
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:08,864
Well, he's a hunter. I'm a maker.

329
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:13,964
- A maker?
- I made this loincloth. I make arrows.

330
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:16,564
I've made a shelf unit for my hut.

331
00:22:16,964 --> 00:22:20,764
I welcome us to you.

332
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:23,664
- What do you do?
- What does it look like?

333
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:26,465
- We're farmers.
- Well, he's a farmer, I'm a herdsman.

334
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:28,065
You're a suck is what you are.

335
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,565
- My brother Cain. I'm called Abel.
- You are called "suck. "

336
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:34,265
There you go with that "suck. "
What does that mean?

337
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:37,065
Short for "suckle. "
Short for "suckle up. "

338
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:41,065
You're suckling up to God.
You're a suckle-up.

339
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:44,165
Somebody's upset because God
looked on my sacrifice with favor.

340
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:46,966
"God looked upon my sacrifice
with favor. " I mean...

341
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,666
- Is he a total suck or what?
- Hard to say. We just met.

342
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,666
Why are you bringing these guys
in it?

343
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,466
- They live in a tree.
- Oh, see?

344
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:57,066
I mean, come on. You just gotta be
so superior to everyone else.

345
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,666
No, but superior to... Than you.

346
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:02,666
Superior... Let's see how superior
you are when I kick your ass.

347
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,667
- Oh, yeah?
- You want some of that?

348
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,467
- Yes, I do.
- Guys.

349
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,767
- I'm right here. I'm right here.
- No, come on.

350
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:14,167
No. This smug asshole insulted you,
and I want him to take it back.

351
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,667
- We're not that insulted.
- Why don't you make me?

352
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,567
No, no. Boys, boys.
You are brothers. Let's just relax...

353
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,367
...and let's all just get
some perspective...

354
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:26,168
Yeah. Yeah. That's how we do it.
That's how we do it. That's...

355
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:28,768
- There are rules that we abide by.
- Yeah, right.

356
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:34,868
- Should we do something?
- Just let them settle it.

357
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:36,868
I tripped.

358
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:45,569
Well, I guess that settles it.

359
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:46,969
- What?
- Nothing.

360
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:52,769
It's... He's all right.
He's just... He's resting.

361
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,869
Well, he's tuckered out
from the fight.

362
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:58,069
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's... You know what?

363
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,769
Let's cover him up with a little dirt
and some straw...

364
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:03,370
...to keep him warm
until he wakes up and...

365
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,470
Hey. Abel, what are you doing
with my foot? Playing possum?

366
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,870
Hey. Oh, hey, stop it.
He's choking me.

367
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,270
Stop it, Abel. Are you trying
to choke me to death, Abel?

368
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,870
"Yes, Cain, I am. "
Come on, stop it!

369
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,971
Self-defense. Clearly. Self-defense.

370
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:27,671
What have I done?
What have I done?

371
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:38,571
What have I done again?
What have I done some more?

372
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,472
What have I continued to do?

373
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,972
Oh, guys.
Guys, we're in some real trouble here.

374
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:57,772
What do you mean, "we"?

375
00:24:57,972 --> 00:25:00,373
I don't wanna play the blame game
but you hit him.

376
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:02,973
No, no, no. There's two of you
and there's one of me.

377
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:06,173
- You could have stopped me.
- Didn't know you were gonna kill him.

378
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:09,573
- Are you calling me a murderer?
- Did I say that?

379
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:12,873
It was an accident. Right?

380
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:15,273
Yeah, you were holding a rock...

381
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,774
...and he ran into it
with his face repeatedly...

382
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,474
...until he just couldn't pull through.

383
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:22,474
- It was horseplay.
- It was horseplay.

384
00:25:22,674 --> 00:25:24,474
It was two horses playing.

385
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:27,474
One murders the other one...

386
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:33,274
Yeah. It's probably best if we
didn't mention this accident to anyone.

387
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:35,974
Because, you know,
people don't understand, and...

388
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:37,275
Who am I gonna tell?

389
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:39,475
I can't think of one
who'd be interested.

390
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,875
I'd only tell him
and he's a witness as well.

391
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,175
- Why even bring it up?
- Okay.

392
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:47,175
- It's like he killed himself.
- Cry for help, if anything.

393
00:25:47,475 --> 00:25:49,975
All right. Good.

394
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:55,776
I like you guys. I do.
I like you guys a lot. I do.

395
00:25:55,976 --> 00:25:58,176
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

396
00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:01,376
- We already have dinner plans.
- Damn.

397
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:04,376
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

398
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,576
We'll come over to your place
for supper.

399
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:09,076
I mean, how many times
do we see you?

400
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:11,576
- Just don't kill me.
- No horseplay.

401
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:13,576
- What?
- Nothing.

402
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,877
What are these big,
round things for?

403
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,677
They're wheels, numbskull.
They make the cart roll.

404
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,278
I feel like a bird.

405
00:26:41,678 --> 00:26:43,278
Bring it forth.

406
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,479
Hello.

407
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,679
I'm gonna yak.

408
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:07,679
Hey. What's wrong with you?

409
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:11,079
- Let me get your hair.
- That was too fast.

410
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,080
Cain, I ask you again,
where is thy brother Abel?

411
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,280
I don't know.
I haven't really seen him at all.

412
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,681
Have you... You guys...
You guys haven't seen him, have you?

413
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:35,881
- Don't know who that is.
- I don't... Never...

414
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:38,981
- Don't know who you're talking about.
- What's his name?

415
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:42,581
- Sure he's out there somewhere...
- I haven't seen anybody anywhere.

416
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:45,781
Never had the pleasure.
Sure he's in the prime of his life.

417
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:49,381
This is good soup. Really good.

418
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:51,882
Lilith said she saw you
in the field with him.

419
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:54,682
Oh, man, this bread is good.

420
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:59,782
Oh, really? That... Oh, yeah.
No, that was yesterday, right.

421
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:02,382
No, this day.
She said you both made offerings.

422
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,182
- Oh, that was Boaz. Yeah.
- No.

423
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:07,082
- Japheth. It was Japheth.
- No.

424
00:28:07,282 --> 00:28:08,682
- Enoch.
- No.

425
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:10,283
- I'm sure it was Gilgamesh.
- No.

426
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:11,883
- Ishmael.
- No.

427
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,283
- Ezidia?
- No.

428
00:28:13,383 --> 00:28:14,683
- Jennifer?
- No.

429
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,983
Now I'm remembering correctly.
It was Tishbaven.

430
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:19,683
It was you. She said
it looked like you were arguing.

431
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:25,083
Yeah, well, let's be honest.
Lilith is a lying bitch.

432
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:28,584
Look, I mean, we're brothers.
We're gonna argue, it's human nature.

433
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:31,884
- Show me the perfect family.
- His flock goes untended in the field.

434
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:34,484
Okay, look. Enough.
Am I his keeper?

435
00:28:34,684 --> 00:28:37,684
I mean, just get off my back, Father.

436
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:42,284
I wish you were dead too.
Even though Abel's not dead at all.

437
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:46,184
I fear the worst for Abel.
I'm sorely vexed.

438
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:49,285
You're welcome to spend this night
with us.

439
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:51,285
You may lay with my daughter Lilith.

440
00:28:52,685 --> 00:28:53,985
She is without a husband...

441
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:56,685
...and as the Lord said,
"Be fruitful and multiply. "

442
00:28:58,185 --> 00:28:59,185
What about me?

443
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:01,585
You may share the bed
of my son Seth.

444
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:03,785
- Thanks, Papa.
- Yeah, there you go.

445
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,886
I multiplied with sheep.

446
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:08,586
Smell that.

447
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:11,886
Hello.

448
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,386
Feeling fruitful?

449
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:21,086
My bed is small but you're welcome
to share it. It's the way of my people.

450
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:23,486
That is such a good way to be.

451
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:30,887
In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty
girl like you is sleeping alone, anyway.

452
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,487
I'd have thought
guys would be lined up at the door.

453
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:37,887
- Oh. I don't like men.
- Maybe...

454
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:40,787
...you just ain't met the right one yet.

455
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:45,488
Loincloth rising.

456
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:56,088
- No, I like girls.
- We have that in common.

457
00:29:56,288 --> 00:29:58,988
No, I'm attracted to women.

458
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,989
I don't even know what that means.

459
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:12,789
- What does that mean?
- I like to have sex with other women.

460
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:16,889
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
All my brain blood was in my boner.

461
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:24,790
That was such a good one.

462
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,390
Okay, here we go. Ready, ready?

463
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,090
No, wait.

464
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,290
Little surprise on the end
of that one, right?

465
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,591
- Very good.
- One more, ready?

466
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:50,091
No, we're good.
Oh, do you wanna see a trick?

467
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,791
Do I have to?

468
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:57,591
Your brother Seth
is an interesting guy.

469
00:30:57,991 --> 00:31:00,391
Did you know he can put
his own penis in his mouth?

470
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:01,992
I did not know that.

471
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,392
Whole thing. Right in there.

472
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:06,992
It's been a great sleepover...

473
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:11,092
...and thank you
for the gruel and the garb.

474
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:15,292
- Where's everybody going?
- To look for thy brother Abel.

475
00:31:15,492 --> 00:31:17,492
- Good luck.
- What?

476
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:20,693
I said, good luck, Father.
I'm really worried about him.

477
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:21,993
You're not coming?

478
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:25,293
I'm just gonna stay here
and finish toiling...

479
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:29,093
...and then we'll be right behind you.
- Good.

480
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:35,093
Hey, I'm heading to the coast.
You guys should come with me.

481
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,493
They're gonna try to blame this
whole Abel-killing business on you.

482
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:40,794
- Why blame it on us?
- When they find him...

483
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:44,594
...and see his head, they're gonna
start pointing fingers. You're drifters.

484
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:46,594
They're gonna put two
and two together.

485
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:49,894
Now stop asking so many questions
and let's go. Go, go, go.

486
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:02,495
Cain. After him.

487
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:12,095
- They're gaining on us.
- They're getting away.

488
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:16,095
- Eat my dust, Father.
- This is really too fast.

489
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:18,396
- Oh, no, no.
- Hold tight. Hold tight.

490
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:22,596
Cain! My justice will be swift.

491
00:32:24,296 --> 00:32:27,996
No. No! Damn you, Cain.

492
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,596
Who's in God's favor now, Father?

493
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:41,697
What are the odds of that?
Hey, am I lucky or what?

494
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:42,897
Your head's smoking.

495
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,697
Hey, it didn't leave a mark, did it?

496
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:50,597
Just a pink, red hole.

497
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:54,097
- Your bangs are gonna cover it.
- All right. Whatever.

498
00:32:57,698 --> 00:32:59,698
This is the biggest place
I've ever seen.

499
00:32:59,898 --> 00:33:03,098
It's called a town. Just act normal.

500
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:06,398
- Hi.
- Hello. Greetings, seafarer.

501
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:07,998
- That's not normal.
- Hello.

502
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:10,598
Would you stop saying
hi to everybody? It's annoying.

503
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,199
All right, this is a market.
Over there is a Build-A-Bear.

504
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:18,899
That's a really good container store.
Oh, this place has killer hemp.

505
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,899
- Yes, please.
- Next up is an unusual item.

506
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:28,899
- He's big. He's strong.
- It's Marlak.

507
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:32,399
Oh, do not worry. He is not fighting,
he is having fun.

508
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,900
Okay, maybe he's
little bit depressed.

509
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
Maya and Eema.

510
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,900
- Zed.
- Eema.

511
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,800
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi. Gosh.

512
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,200
What happened?
How did you get here?

513
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,501
After the fire that you started,
the hill tribes raided the village.

514
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:53,801
They held us captive...

515
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:57,001
...and traded us to the boat people,
who brought us here.

516
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,401
So it's such a coincidence
to run into you guys like this here.

517
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:03,001
- You think it's a coincidence?
- What do you think?

518
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:07,901
I'm not sure, but I'm beginning to think
that everything happens for a reason.

519
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:11,702
God wanted me to have
knowledge of good and evil.

520
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:14,702
- Why would he want that?
- Why are we assuming God's a he?

521
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:20,102
I don't know what to say to that.

522
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:22,702
You kidding?

523
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:26,202
Anyway, don't you guys see
what I'm saying?

524
00:34:26,302 --> 00:34:27,402
Why would he choose you?

525
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:29,702
Why wouldn't he choose
someone stronger?

526
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:32,503
Chosen doesn't have to be strong.
I'm big like this.

527
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,903
- You have a fat face.
- My brain. It's enormous.

528
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:37,203
I'm smarter than you are.
I don't talk as much.

529
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:39,103
I'm the smartest guy in the village.

530
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:41,403
I'm the smartest guy
that was in the village.

531
00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:44,203
Excuse me,
you are interested in some slaves?

532
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:46,203
Yes.

533
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:50,004
- This one looks pretty good.
- And her little friend. Very good.

534
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:51,704
- Just how I like them.
- Hey.

535
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:53,304
Feisty.

536
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:55,504
So how do we do this
if we want them?

537
00:34:57,904 --> 00:34:59,204
You have money?

538
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:01,104
That depends
on what you mean by money.

539
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:04,104
Excuse me.
Perhaps I could be of some help here.

540
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:08,204
You guys, let me deal with this guy,
see if I can work out a deal.

541
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:10,305
What happened to your forehead?

542
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:14,105
I didn't murder my brother. I didn't.

543
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:15,805
All right, I'm just gonna...

544
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:18,105
We're gonna get you out of this.
You trust me?

545
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:23,105
- I want to trust you.
- Fair enough.

546
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:30,306
Next up is a twofer.
It is two for price of one.

547
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,906
Have a great vacation.

548
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:34,606
Never trusted that guy.

549
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:36,906
Because he murdered his brother
with a rock?

550
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:40,406
Is that why you didn't trust him?
You got great instincts.

551
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,707
Sorry, do you think you could move
your hands, please?

552
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:55,507
Yeah.

553
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:59,107
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

554
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:03,707
Enmebaragesi, can you move that way
a little bit? We're crowded back here.

555
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:06,508
Oh, yeah, no problem.
How's that?

556
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,708
Look, I want you to know...

557
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:12,708
...I blame myself for everything
that's happened.

558
00:36:12,908 --> 00:36:17,408
- Yeah. So does everybody else.
- Stay away from my woman.

559
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,808
Not gonna be possible, Marlak.

560
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:24,809
She's not your woman.
You can't own people.

561
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:28,009
Except for the guy who bought
all of us. Apparently, he can.

562
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:29,309
- That's it.
- What?

563
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:31,409
- I'm gonna kill you!
- "I'm gonna kill you. "

564
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:34,409
You always say, "I'm gonna kill you"
and you never do.

565
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:40,309
Be still. Don't make me come in there.

566
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:42,909
I'd like to see you try.

567
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,110
Take the slaves!

568
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:04,911
Go!

569
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:11,811
Eema, run like a cougar
is chasing you.

570
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:14,911
- Zed!
- Eema.

571
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:17,411
Come here, you two.

572
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:19,911
Go, go, go, go.

573
00:37:31,612 --> 00:37:34,612
Sir, shall we pursue the slaves?

574
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:37,812
Let the desert have them.
They won't get far.

575
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:39,712
Yes, sir.

576
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,913
- Orders, sir?
- Tend to the slaves.

577
00:37:56,113 --> 00:37:58,213
- We leave for Sodom before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.

578
00:37:58,413 --> 00:37:59,613
I wonder who they are.

579
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:02,414
Their hats are really great,
aren't they?

580
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,914
Their hats?

581
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:06,114
When that guy
cut the other guy's head off...

582
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:08,314
...I wasn't thinking about
what a great hat.

583
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:12,314
It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd
be lying if I said it wasn't up there.

584
00:38:12,514 --> 00:38:14,514
I'm just saying, if I can snag one,
I'm going to.

585
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:18,214
Now I just have to figure out a way
to rescue Maya and Eema.

586
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:21,715
How are we gonna rescue them?
These guys are killers.

587
00:38:22,415 --> 00:38:25,715
Even killers have to sleep sometime.

588
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:35,415
That was refreshing.

589
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,016
Shit!

590
00:38:42,716 --> 00:38:43,716
They're gone.

591
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,916
Now where do we go?

592
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:50,116
They said they were going to Sodom.
We're going to Sodom.

593
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:55,516
I think I have sand in my ass,
but there's no way of knowing for sure.

594
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:58,717
I'll take a look in it
when we get to Sodom.

595
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:02,817
We making a burnt offering
or something?

596
00:39:03,017 --> 00:39:06,317
Yes, Isaac.
As God has commanded me.

597
00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:08,217
But I don't see the sheep anywhere.

598
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:13,017
The Lord. The Lord shall provide
the sheep, my son.

599
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,417
What is this?
Is this some sort of magic trick?

600
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:18,618
In a way. In a way.

601
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:23,018
If this is because I didn't clean up
my tent, I'm sorry.

602
00:39:23,218 --> 00:39:25,118
I'll do it right when I get home.

603
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:26,818
Oh, Dad, why are you doing this?

604
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:31,218
The Lord has spoken unto me, Isaac,
and I must obey him.

605
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:34,618
If the Lord told you to jump off a cliff,
would you do it?

606
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:36,819
- Forgive me, Isaac.
- My God.

607
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:39,419
Stop! What are you doing
with that kid?

608
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:43,519
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

609
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:46,419
This is my son, sir.
We were playing a game.

610
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,619
All right?
It's called Burny Burny Cut Cut.

611
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,019
You weren't.
You were gonna kill him.

612
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:56,820
I was not going to kill him.
I was going to sacrifice him.

613
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,520
- There is a tremendous difference.
- Not to him.

614
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:05,320
By what right dost thou interfere?
Art thou sent by the Lord?

615
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,220
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.

616
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,720
- Aye. Aye, verily, thou art.
- Verily. Yea.

617
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,921
Thou were sent by the Eternal One
to stay my hand.

618
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,821
- All of that.
- This is Isaac.

619
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:25,321
And I am Abraham, the son of Terah
of the House of Nahor.

620
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:30,021
We were two doors down from Nahor.
We were Nahor's neighbors.

621
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,021
And I am Zed, son of Zero.

622
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:36,322
And this is Oh, son of Ooh
from the House of Sticks and Dung.

623
00:40:36,522 --> 00:40:38,922
The tents of my kinsmen
lie just beyond.

624
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,722
Come. Come, my friends.

625
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:43,422
We are the Hebrews.

626
00:40:43,622 --> 00:40:47,322
A righteous people,
but not very good at sports.

627
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:49,022
This way, friends. Come.

628
00:40:50,522 --> 00:40:51,823
Brothers, brothers.

629
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:56,423
Let us give thanks
unto the Lord thy God...

630
00:40:56,523 --> 00:41:00,623
...for staying my hand on the mountain
this very day.

631
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:03,823
Praise be to God,
hallowed be his name.

632
00:41:04,023 --> 00:41:05,423
And let us also praise him...

633
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:08,723
...for the bounty
which he hath bestowed unto us.

634
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:10,424
He hath increased our wealth...

635
00:41:10,624 --> 00:41:12,124
...and blessed us with...

636
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:15,324
Thanks. Thank you.
A lot of loving things.

637
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:16,924
- Kind loving kindness.
- Yeah.

638
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:19,024
Friends, whence comest thou?

639
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:23,424
- He wants to know where you're from.
- Thou comest not from...

640
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:26,524
...the Cities of the Plain,
from Sodom and Gomorrah.

641
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:28,924
- Heard of them, never been there.
- Are they nice?

642
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:30,325
"Are they nice?"

643
00:41:30,425 --> 00:41:33,225
They have been cursed for all time
by the Lord thy God...

644
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:35,825
...for their abominations.
- I did not know that.

645
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:39,225
They worship idols
and they bow down before false gods.

646
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:41,325
- Abdominal.
- It's the worst.

647
00:41:41,525 --> 00:41:44,525
The men of that city
are weak and soft...

648
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,925
...fat with rich food,
intoxicated by strong drink.

649
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:50,226
I'm not hearing the bad part.

650
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:52,726
The women are whores.

651
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:55,326
Their shameless lust
knows no bounds.

652
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:56,726
They flaunt their flesh...

653
00:41:56,926 --> 00:42:00,326
...and any man may have knowledge
of them whenever he so chooseth.

654
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:03,326
Which one of the two cities
has the most whores?

655
00:42:04,326 --> 00:42:07,927
Just so we know to stay away
from that one especially.

656
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:11,327
Walk you not the path of Sodom.

657
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,927
For the Lord thy God
has said unto me...

658
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:17,027
...that he shall send a holy fire
to destroy that city...

659
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:20,027
...and all who dwell within
for their iniquity.

660
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:23,127
He shall smite them.

661
00:42:23,327 --> 00:42:27,028
Them, and all of their seed.

662
00:42:28,228 --> 00:42:31,128
So when do you think
this smiting's gonna go down?

663
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:33,928
- Because we have some friends there.
- Their fate is sealed.

664
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:37,228
But for my faith and devotion...

665
00:42:37,428 --> 00:42:38,628
...that self-same God...

666
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:42,528
...has promised unto me
the whole of this land.

667
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:47,029
From the Heights of Golan in the north
to the Sinai in the south.

668
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:50,329
From the river of Jordan
to the great sea.

669
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:53,529
- This is all your land?
- For all of eternity.

670
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:56,029
But apparently God
forgot to tell anyone else.

671
00:42:56,229 --> 00:42:58,129
We're at war with someone
every other day.

672
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:01,329
Excuse me. I and my kinsmen
have vanquished our enemies...

673
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:04,129
...by the mighty hand
of God, blessed be he.

674
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:06,530
- Praised is his name...
- Unto us.

675
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,030
...and glory his graciousness.
- Wealthy bounty.

676
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,230
Therefore, to signify my covenant
with the one true God...

677
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,030
...I shall on this day
circumcise the flesh of my penis.

678
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:23,630
And of you. And you, and of you,
and every male who dwelleth hereby.

679
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:26,931
- Excuse me?
- I don't know what you mean.

680
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:30,231
We shall grasp the foreskins
of our penises...

681
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:33,831
...and we shall cut therefrom
the extra flesh. Amen.

682
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:38,431
I don't think I have any extra.

683
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:41,231
- Couldn't we pierce our ears?
- No, no, no.

684
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:43,832
So it shall be written,
and so it shall be done.

685
00:43:43,932 --> 00:43:47,632
Let me get this straight. You're saying
you have too much cock?

686
00:43:47,732 --> 00:43:49,232
And you wanna:

687
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:54,632
You know, Abe, it's been a long day,
we've all had a lot to drink...

688
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:58,232
...and I know that this foreskin thing
sounds like a good idea now...

689
00:43:58,432 --> 00:44:00,532
...but you might wanna sleep on it.

690
00:44:00,732 --> 00:44:02,533
We can always cut it off
in the morning.

691
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:05,933
But if we do it now, there's just no way
to get it back on there.

692
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:08,933
No, no, no, trust me, it's gonna be
a very, very sleek look.

693
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:13,333
This is gonna catch on. I'm gonna go
get my good knife.

694
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:19,033
Just wait right there. I'll be right back
to cut your penises.

695
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:23,634
Not the whole thing,
you understand. Just the very tip.

696
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:26,934
And after, we're all gonna have wine
and sponge cake.

697
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,434
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

698
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:33,734
Going to Sodom.
We have to save Maya and Eema.

699
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:36,434
He said that God
was gonna smite Sodom with holy fire.

700
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:38,834
God also told him to chop off
the tip of his dick.

701
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:44,435
Dad, no! No! No!

702
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:48,935
So listen, I've been thinking,
what constitutes the tip of the penis?

703
00:44:49,035 --> 00:44:51,835
Because his definition
might not be the same as mine.

704
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:55,635
- What if the tip is your favorite part?
- The tip is your only part.

705
00:44:59,536 --> 00:45:01,336
Come out here.

706
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:05,036
Hey, you caught me. Guilty.

707
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,336
What are you doing here?

708
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:08,836
- I'm gonna come.
- You don't know where we're going.

709
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:10,636
- You're going to Sodom, right?
- No.

710
00:45:10,736 --> 00:45:13,436
How stupid you think I am?
You've had a boner for Sodom...

711
00:45:13,636 --> 00:45:16,536
...since my dad mentioned it.
If I take you, get me some wine.

712
00:45:16,636 --> 00:45:18,137
Aren't you a bit young?

713
00:45:18,337 --> 00:45:20,737
Do you like hanging out
with this little girl?

714
00:45:22,037 --> 00:45:23,937
My dad just trimmed my dick skin.

715
00:45:26,437 --> 00:45:28,937
That's Sodom right there.
The Unholy Land.

716
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:33,137
The devil's playground,
where the sinners are winners.

717
00:45:34,537 --> 00:45:37,037
Me and my boys sneak in here
on the weekends sometimes.

718
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:39,838
Pick up on the babes,
drink some wine, smoke some herb.

719
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:42,438
- Shouldn't be smoking either.
- Thanks a lot, Grandpa.

720
00:45:42,638 --> 00:45:45,438
I've been smoking for four harvests
now, so I think I'm good.

721
00:45:48,338 --> 00:45:49,838
These doors are enormous.

722
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:53,638
- It looks like they're not open, so...
- You just gotta knock.

723
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,738
- They let me in all the time.
- Yeah, knock.

724
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:57,439
- Why don't you knock?
- You knock.

725
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:00,539
- What if we're waking somebody?
- Eema and Maya might be in there.

726
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:02,439
I gave them our word
we'd rescue them.

727
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,239
I want to get my dicky sticky.

728
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:10,339
- Halt. Halt.
- Get help. Tell your father.

729
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:13,239
Like I'm gonna tell my father
I came with you guys to Sodom.

730
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:14,639
So long, suckers.

731
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,240
I kind of get why his dad
wanted to kill him.

732
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,340
Get in.

733
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,940
- What's this, then?
- They were banging on the gate.

734
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,040
- Hebrews from the look of them.
- Well, we're not really Hebrews.

735
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,440
We are Hebrews?

736
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,741
I get it. No talking.

737
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:38,041
- Should we wake the commander?
- Oh, no.

738
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:42,341
Don't want to wake the commander.
He gets mean when you wake him.

739
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,541
Meaner than this?

740
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:50,441
Let go of his titty.

741
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,542
Yeah. Okay. All right, good one.

742
00:46:53,742 --> 00:46:57,942
What the bloody hell
is going on out there?

743
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:05,542
Who screamed?
Sounded like a woman.

744
00:47:06,342 --> 00:47:09,842
But you don't look like a woman.
You wanna kiss me?

745
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:12,142
Like in a romantic way?

746
00:47:13,843 --> 00:47:16,343
By tomorrow morning,
you'll wish you hadn't been born.

747
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:18,543
- I already feel that way right now.
- Yeah.

748
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:20,643
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

749
00:47:20,843 --> 00:47:25,243
Because that I would pay to see.
You versus a guy your size.

750
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:29,243
Give me my stick.

751
00:47:32,944 --> 00:47:35,744
Bumpy. You got a smoother one?

752
00:47:36,544 --> 00:47:37,744
Yeah.

753
00:47:37,944 --> 00:47:40,444
Turn around
and put your hands on the table.

754
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:42,944
Now!

755
00:47:43,644 --> 00:47:45,744
I'll take that kiss now.

756
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:50,044
- We'll start with the fat one.
- Relatively fat. I mean...

757
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:53,845
- Welcome to Sodom.
- Hey, I want a piece of that.

758
00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:57,845
- Cain?
- You know them?

759
00:47:59,645 --> 00:48:01,045
Brothers.

760
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:08,145
I missed you so much. Oh, you guys.
Promise you'll never leave me again.

761
00:48:11,746 --> 00:48:13,846
- This is amazing.
- And this is a Monday.

762
00:48:14,046 --> 00:48:15,846
You should see this place
on a Thursday.

763
00:48:16,046 --> 00:48:19,246
- Because Thursday's the new Friday.
- Well, thanks for saving us.

764
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:23,246
- What are you gonna do to us now?
- Excuse me? Do I detect a tone here?

765
00:48:23,746 --> 00:48:25,446
You did sell us into slavery.

766
00:48:25,646 --> 00:48:28,847
Hold a grudge much?
That was, like, a fortnight ago.

767
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,147
It was less than a fortnight.
Half a fortnight.

768
00:48:31,347 --> 00:48:34,447
- It was a sevennight.
- Oh, give me a break.

769
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:36,347
I was dealing with the death...

770
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:39,847
...of a close, personal family member
and I needed some space.

771
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:44,047
But hey, now I realize that you guys
are like my real brothers.

772
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:48,748
And it's so rare to have a brother
that you love and don't wanna kill.

773
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:50,748
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

774
00:48:50,948 --> 00:48:52,448
Hey, who's hungry?

775
00:48:52,548 --> 00:48:53,848
- I'm hungry.
- Don't kill me.

776
00:48:54,048 --> 00:48:55,648
Yeah? Okay.

777
00:48:56,348 --> 00:48:58,748
Excuse me, I was...

778
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:02,748
Yeah, that's two for flinching.
Hey, let's go.

779
00:49:05,448 --> 00:49:07,649
Here. Now we're even.

780
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:12,349
Check out the woman across the way.
She's looking at us.

781
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:16,349
She's totally eye-knowing us
with her eyes right now.

782
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,350
Well, she's really making
that banana last.

783
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,851
- Go talk to her.
- I kind of have a girlfriend right now.

784
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:50,051
A girl that I'm going to marry.

785
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:53,851
Make my wife, make her my girlfriend
one day when I get enough strength.

786
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:57,551
What transpires within the confines
of the walls of Sodom...

787
00:49:57,751 --> 00:50:00,651
...stays within the confines of the walls
of Sodom.

788
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:05,352
If you guys are gonna stay here,
you should join the guard.

789
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:08,752
- Hey!
- Hey, hey what, hey? Huh? Yeah.

790
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:12,017
I mean, the pay's not great
but the perks, tons of them.

791
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:15,852
I'm telling you, it's the only way to go.
Come on, let's go talk to the sergeant.

792
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:19,752
- Let's go.
- Hurry now.

793
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:27,953
This is great. How do I look?

794
00:50:28,353 --> 00:50:31,953
I can't see. This is too big on me.
I wonder if I can get a smaller size.

795
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:36,153
Yeah, someone's gotta be
the hat person around here.

796
00:50:36,353 --> 00:50:38,053
- Find a...
- Excuse me.

797
00:50:38,253 --> 00:50:41,453
Hey, my helmet is way too big
for me. It looks really silly.

798
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:44,454
- Think I can get a smaller one?
- Line up!

799
00:50:46,454 --> 00:50:51,054
- What are you doing? In the line.
- Wait, he's not...

800
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:53,854
In the line. Face forward in the line.

801
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:56,254
- Guys. Guys?
- I don't know where to...

802
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,254
- Guys.
- You too!

803
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:02,355
- Guys.
- Find a hole, you stupid bastards.

804
00:51:02,555 --> 00:51:04,555
- It's kind of obvious, isn't it?
- Not to me.

805
00:51:04,755 --> 00:51:07,155
Soldiers. Present arms.

806
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:14,755
I never got a sword.
I only got the holder.

807
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:18,255
I didn't know
that that's what it was for.

808
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:21,756
- So this is it? We just walk around?
- Yeah, pretty much.

809
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:23,256
Just look for troublemakers.

810
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:27,456
If you see a thief or a pickpocket,
we'll slap them around a little bit.

811
00:51:27,556 --> 00:51:31,656
Maybe cut off a finger, you know,
or tip of the nose sometimes.

812
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:36,456
Lower lip. Just anything you can grab
and slice in one fluid motion.

813
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:37,856
It seems kind of harsh.

814
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:42,757
Hey, just remember it's the palace
that pays us, not the people. Come on.

815
00:51:42,957 --> 00:51:45,257
Feed us!

816
00:51:47,757 --> 00:51:53,157
Six sacrifices in the last 10 days
and still no rain.

817
00:51:53,357 --> 00:51:57,357
Majesty, there's talk of revolution
in the streets.

818
00:51:57,457 --> 00:52:00,058
Oil and grain are scarce,
prices are high.

819
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:04,658
Starving peasants are pouring
into the city in search of food.

820
00:52:05,158 --> 00:52:07,758
We could actually have a riot
on our hands.

821
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:11,158
Poverty has a bitter taste,
but it is a flavor they are born to.

822
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,458
It is the will of the gods.
What do the entrails predict?

823
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:22,959
Well, the liver is streaked with gray,
which is not a good sign...

824
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:26,559
...but his poor rectum
is absolutely pulverized...

825
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:29,659
...which is not unusual
for a sheep in this region.

826
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:31,659
The genitals are enormous.

827
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:34,159
That's of no significance,
I'm just commenting.

828
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,059
If you do look at this intestine...

829
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:38,660
...his large intestine
is arranged in an arc...

830
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,560
...then the two massive balls
of the sheep are like eyes.

831
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,360
To me, I see a happy face.
That makes me happy.

832
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,160
What does it mean?

833
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,260
Well, could mean a surprise visit
from a former friend or sweetheart.

834
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,760
Or that you're going
on a long sea voyage.

835
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,761
Could I come?
I've never been on a boat.

836
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:58,361
How did you become high priest?

837
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:00,661
I'm your brother-in-law.

838
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,261
Perhaps it's time
for a new high priest.

839
00:53:08,761 --> 00:53:13,061
Perhaps it's not time
for a new high priest.

840
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:25,162
Let that be a warning to you.

841
00:53:25,362 --> 00:53:29,962
Next time, I shall hurl a lightning bolt
right in your face.

842
00:53:30,162 --> 00:53:31,962
Or a fireball.

843
00:53:32,262 --> 00:53:35,763
And you know what's the best part
about Sodom? The sodomy.

844
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,863
You guys are in for a treat.

845
00:53:56,964 --> 00:53:58,464
Down.

846
00:53:58,664 --> 00:54:00,864
Did you see that girl?

847
00:54:01,164 --> 00:54:02,564
That was Princess Inanna.

848
00:54:02,764 --> 00:54:05,364
She's totally hot.
Don't even think about it.

849
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:06,764
Why not?

850
00:54:06,964 --> 00:54:09,864
Why? Because she's royalty
and you're a caveman.

851
00:54:09,964 --> 00:54:11,264
Where's everybody going?

852
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:13,665
To the temple.
You guys have to see this.

853
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:16,065
- Will she be there?
- Yeah, everyone'll be there.

854
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,165
There she is.

855
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:41,366
The princess isn't eating.

856
00:54:41,466 --> 00:54:44,066
I find it hard to eat
when so many are hungry.

857
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:47,466
- You can't keep starving yourself.
- Why not?

858
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:50,567
Everybody else is starving.
Present company excluded.

859
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:52,367
Careful, princess.

860
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:55,867
You may be my stepdaughter,
but these are dangerous times...

861
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:59,567
...and those are dangerous words.
- Whatever.

862
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:01,767
Hi.

863
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,467
Yeah.

864
00:55:14,368 --> 00:55:17,068
- What's happening?
- They're picking a virgin.

865
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,068
Oh, please. If you're a virgin,
then I'm a fuzzy little gerbil.

866
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:28,669
Back to the whorehouse with you.
Quick as a bunny. There you go.

867
00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:30,269
What do they need a virgin for?

868
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:33,669
- To throw her in the fire. Are you new?
- What? Why?

869
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:36,869
An offering to the gods.

870
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:39,669
- Are you serious?
- There's a famine going on...

871
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,269
...so if we make
a good enough sacrifice...

872
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:45,869
...then the gods give us rain.
You get rain, you get harvest...

873
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:48,670
...you get harvest, you get food.
You know what food is?

874
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:51,270
Yeah, you know food.

875
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,470
So they're gonna throw a virgin
into the fire so that it rains?

876
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,670
Where do you think rain
comes from? Clouds?

877
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,370
My 6-year-old knows.

878
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:04,470
- Hey, how do you get rain?
- Burn a virgin.

879
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:08,171
I didn't think
it was anything related to...

880
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:10,571
Yeah, yeah. "I didn't think,
I didn't think. "

881
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:13,471
It's the gods and it comes
from virgins being burned.

882
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,571
Did I do something to offend you?

883
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:19,171
I come here, I get a great seat
at the sacrifice, and you're ruining it.

884
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:24,071
Seems like a waste
of a perfectly good virgin to me.

885
00:56:24,271 --> 00:56:27,672
Hey, guys? I'm trying to enjoy
the sacrifice with my family.

886
00:56:27,772 --> 00:56:29,872
Do you mind? Do you mind?

887
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:31,272
For the love of the gods...

888
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,172
...we commit this fair maiden...

889
00:56:34,772 --> 00:56:38,072
...to Moloch's holy fire.

890
00:56:43,272 --> 00:56:45,573
These virgins, it's always a girl?

891
00:56:45,773 --> 00:56:48,973
I'm really happy for her.
She was always the runner-up.

892
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:50,173
True success story.

893
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:53,473
My lord,
the princess wishes to see you.

894
00:56:53,673 --> 00:56:55,473
Me? What about my friend?

895
00:56:55,673 --> 00:56:57,373
Can the two of us come?
We're a pair.

896
00:56:57,573 --> 00:57:00,373
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The three of us are like a pair.

897
00:57:00,573 --> 00:57:03,974
No, not you.
The two of you, follow me.

898
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:05,774
Great.

899
00:57:06,574 --> 00:57:09,474
- I'll try to put a good word in for you.
- Yeah, do.

900
00:57:09,674 --> 00:57:13,474
If we never, ever see you again,
it's not because we're avoiding you.

901
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:15,374
Don't forget about me.

902
00:57:18,974 --> 00:57:22,375
This is Zaftig, the eunuch.
You, go with him.

903
00:57:22,975 --> 00:57:24,375
Oh, can't I go with him?

904
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:29,275
- Why? Is he your lover?
- No, we're just friends.

905
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:30,675
That would be weird.
We're both guys.

906
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,775
- Come with me.
- What do you do?

907
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,475
I've been a palace eunuch
since I was 9 years old.

908
00:57:38,675 --> 00:57:41,376
- How would I become a eunuch?
- They cut off your testicles.

909
00:57:41,476 --> 00:57:43,276
Why all the genital mutilation?

910
00:57:43,476 --> 00:57:47,676
Well, you get to keep them.
I always keep mine close at hand.

911
00:57:47,876 --> 00:57:49,676
Would you like to see?

912
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:51,176
No.

913
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:02,877
Can I ask your opinion?

914
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:06,277
What do you think?
Ponytail or no ponytail?

915
00:58:06,477 --> 00:58:10,477
- I don't know and I really don't care.
- Okay. I just wanted to know...

916
00:58:10,677 --> 00:58:14,177
...what the ladies of Sodom
were into nowadays, but...

917
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:17,877
This party is insane.

918
00:58:18,177 --> 00:58:21,978
It's more of a hair-down
kind of scene, I'd say.

919
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:25,178
Hi.

920
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:35,878
Be sure to try the fruit.

921
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:40,879
Maya. What are you doing here?

922
00:58:41,379 --> 00:58:43,879
Okay, I'm still alive,
thank you for asking...

923
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,679
...and I'm still a slave.

924
00:58:45,879 --> 00:58:49,079
I was coming to rescue you. Really.
That's why we were here.

925
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:50,679
- We were gonna find you.
- Yeah?

926
00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:53,679
You seemed worried
about your ponytail just a second ago.

927
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:55,879
I was just...

928
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,480
- You were just chosen again.
- I was.

929
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,280
I would love to join you at this orgy,
but I can't...

930
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,080
...because I have to go be a slave,
and I don't get any breaks.

931
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,980
And the princess has crabs.

932
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,681
Oh, yes, it's steamy.

933
00:59:18,781 --> 00:59:20,881
God, that's realistic.

934
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:22,881
Watch it, jerk.

935
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:25,581
A real woman, that's...

936
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:27,781
Oh, excuse me, Miss...

937
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:32,481
Ter. Mister. Awkward.

938
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:37,482
Good concentration.

939
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:40,482
You're good. You're real good.

940
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:48,182
- Oh? Is that you?
- I'm not supposed to talk, I'm a statue.

941
00:59:48,382 --> 00:59:53,482
- Yeah, you look so gold.
- It's all the gold paint.

942
00:59:53,582 --> 00:59:55,583
- How's it going?
- It's going great.

943
00:59:55,683 --> 00:59:59,783
I just had my entire body
painted by a fat guy with no balls.

944
00:59:59,883 --> 01:00:03,083
- Oh, how did that go?
- He was extremely thorough.

945
01:00:03,483 --> 01:00:05,483
- How's it going with you?
- Not bad.

946
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:08,583
Just had a little rub and scrub.
Now I'm up for some grub.

947
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:10,283
- Sounds luxurious.
- Hey.

948
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:14,184
You remember that woman
who brought us in with the face dress?

949
01:00:14,284 --> 01:00:17,784
That was Maya. She's working here
now and she looks great.

950
01:00:17,984 --> 01:00:20,384
- Kind of mad at me, though.
- And there's Eema.

951
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,484
Come here, wench.

952
01:00:22,684 --> 01:00:24,484
Let me have a look
what's up that skirt.

953
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:29,884
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.
- It was no accident.

954
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:35,085
Hey. You. Slave girl.
I told you to fetch me more wine.

955
01:00:35,285 --> 01:00:38,885
- Apologize to this officer now.
- I'm sorry.

956
01:00:39,085 --> 01:00:42,985
Good. Now go fetch.
Wait over there by the skinny statue.

957
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:46,085
I'll deal with you later. Go!

958
01:00:49,385 --> 01:00:51,185
Slaves. What are you gonna do?

959
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:54,086
Wait a minute.

960
01:00:54,286 --> 01:00:56,586
Don't I know you?

961
01:01:09,686 --> 01:01:12,087
- What are you, crazy?
- I will not serve these people.

962
01:01:12,287 --> 01:01:14,787
- I'd rather die.
- Keep it up. You will.

963
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:16,187
Have you joined them?

964
01:01:16,387 --> 01:01:18,687
I haven't joined anything.
I'm not having fun.

965
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,287
I'm just checking it out.
A lot to learn here.

966
01:01:21,487 --> 01:01:25,487
- What, human sacrifice?
- No. No human sacrifices.

967
01:01:25,687 --> 01:01:27,787
I've been chosen
to do something great.

968
01:01:27,887 --> 01:01:29,187
Yeah, here we go.

969
01:01:29,387 --> 01:01:33,888
I'm pretty sure it's not hunting pigs
and weaving baskets.

970
01:01:34,288 --> 01:01:36,188
- Oh?
- Hello, Maya.

971
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:42,388
She wants to see you. Now.

972
01:01:42,488 --> 01:01:44,088
Don't think
I'm interested in her.

973
01:01:44,188 --> 01:01:46,588
- Whyever would I think that?
- It's part of my plan.

974
01:01:46,788 --> 01:01:48,788
I'm gonna get us out of here
soon as I can.

975
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:52,089
- The princess awaits you.
- And I await her.

976
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:56,889
You two, await me.
Stay out of trouble. Stay gold.

977
01:01:56,989 --> 01:01:59,089
He has no idea what he's doing,
does he?

978
01:01:59,189 --> 01:02:03,089
- It's nice to see you like this.
- It's nice to see you too.

979
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:05,589
We should do something.
When do you get off?

980
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:10,090
- Never. I'm a slave.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

981
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:12,690
Slave girl, bring me a towel.

982
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,490
Yeah, I should go be a slave.

983
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,190
I'm gonna strike a specific pose,
I guess.

984
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:21,090
- Okay.
- I love you.

985
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:32,191
You there. Golden boy.
Come here.

986
01:02:40,491 --> 01:02:42,391
Rub me with oil.

987
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:45,691
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
That's not...

988
01:02:45,891 --> 01:02:48,092
I'm not one of the oil rubbers,
I'm just a guard.

989
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:50,092
Rub me with oil or die.

990
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:03,492
- Is that enough?
- Much more. Baste me like a chicken.

991
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:08,293
Oh, yes. Pour it all over me,
you little bronze bitchlet.

992
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,293
Yeah, okay. You got the whole thing
on you now.

993
01:03:11,393 --> 01:03:12,893
Marvelous, I love it.

994
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:16,493
All right, well, have a good evening.
I'm glad I could help you out.

995
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:18,893
Now rub it in.

996
01:03:20,493 --> 01:03:21,793
With my hand?

997
01:03:21,993 --> 01:03:25,494
No. With your nutsack.
Of course, with your hand.

998
01:03:29,694 --> 01:03:31,794
Oh, yes.

999
01:03:31,994 --> 01:03:33,694
Oh, yes, the oily oiliness.

1000
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:37,194
The musky, precious,
smoky, oily oiliness.

1001
01:03:37,294 --> 01:03:40,494
Yes, that's right.
Oh, God, paint a picture on my body.

1002
01:03:40,594 --> 01:03:42,394
- Tell a story on my nipples.
- Yeah.

1003
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:45,195
That's right, take me down
the smoky Euphrates.

1004
01:03:45,395 --> 01:03:47,695
Do something
you'll be ashamed of later...

1005
01:03:47,895 --> 01:03:50,395
...you naughty little goat.
All right, charm the snake.

1006
01:03:50,595 --> 01:03:52,895
- Eema. Hey...
- Oh, just like that. Now slap me.

1007
01:03:54,395 --> 01:03:55,995
- This isn't what it looks like.
- My tummy. Go ahead, slap me.

1008
01:03:56,195 --> 01:03:59,395
- Slap me. Slap the tummy.
- No, it's fine. I mean, I understand.

1009
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:02,796
Go on. I love it, I love it.
Oh, you're very gifted.

1010
01:04:02,996 --> 01:04:06,296
No, no, no. I'm just rubbing oil
on this man's chest. Eema.

1011
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:09,696
A gift. I don't know,
you've got some sort of gift.

1012
01:04:15,496 --> 01:04:20,296
- Good luck.
- Look, Maya. Maya.

1013
01:04:21,597 --> 01:04:22,997
Come to me.

1014
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:28,397
Beautiful, isn't it?

1015
01:04:28,597 --> 01:04:30,997
You can see Gomorrah
just over the hill.

1016
01:04:31,097 --> 01:04:34,197
Yep. Twin cities.

1017
01:04:34,397 --> 01:04:36,797
People think that the gods
are gonna wipe them out...

1018
01:04:36,997 --> 01:04:40,297
...because they're so evil.
- And what do you think? Am I evil?

1019
01:04:40,498 --> 01:04:44,398
Well, I don't really know you,
but you don't look evil.

1020
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:46,298
Do you find me attractive?

1021
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:50,098
Yeah.

1022
01:04:50,198 --> 01:04:51,598
Let me ask you one thing.

1023
01:04:51,698 --> 01:04:54,298
What would a girl like you
want with a guy like me?

1024
01:04:54,998 --> 01:04:59,899
I don't know.
I just find you interesting.

1025
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,299
They say it's the will of the gods...

1026
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:04,999
...that some men should suffer
while others rule.

1027
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:07,699
That we're all just victims
of our own fate.

1028
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:09,599
I believed that until this morning...

1029
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:13,399
...when I saw you standing up alone
in the square and I said to myself:

1030
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,399
"Yes! Finally, here's one man
who refuses to bow down to anything.

1031
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,400
A man with the courage
to question the order of things.

1032
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:26,900
A man chosen by the gods
to do something great. "

1033
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,900
That's exactly
what I've been thinking.

1034
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,400
You would not believe the stuff
happening to me.

1035
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,200
- I just didn't know why.
- I know why.

1036
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,601
To bring you here. To this place.
To me.

1037
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:42,701
I could not agree more.

1038
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:46,401
I'm trying to agree more, but I can't,
because that's how much I agree.

1039
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,901
Come.

1040
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:53,801
This must be difficult
for you to understand...

1041
01:05:54,001 --> 01:05:56,702
...but my life is devoted
to the service of the gods...

1042
01:05:56,902 --> 01:06:00,002
...and the good of the people.
I keep nothing for myself.

1043
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:05,502
- That's very unselfish of you.
- It is unselfish of me, isn't it?

1044
01:06:05,602 --> 01:06:07,702
You're so perceptive
for one so young.

1045
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:11,902
- Yeah. What are those doors there?
- Behind these doors...

1046
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:16,003
...is the Holy of Holies,
earthly domain of the gods.

1047
01:06:16,203 --> 01:06:18,403
A place so ineffably sacred,
so powerful...

1048
01:06:18,603 --> 01:06:20,703
...that to enter is instant death.

1049
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:24,403
- Who cleans it?
- Needs no cleaning.

1050
01:06:24,603 --> 01:06:27,103
Kind of makes you think
about the people that built it.

1051
01:06:27,303 --> 01:06:29,003
Like, did they die instantly...

1052
01:06:29,203 --> 01:06:31,103
...or were they given
a courtesy second...

1053
01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:33,103
...to get out of there by the gods?

1054
01:06:33,303 --> 01:06:36,004
They were allowed to finish,
given four and a half seconds...

1055
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:38,104
...then the gods descended.

1056
01:06:39,404 --> 01:06:42,104
- What if a bug goes in there?
- Instant death for the bug.

1057
01:06:42,304 --> 01:06:45,204
Are there dead bugs all over?
Because nobody cleans it.

1058
01:06:45,304 --> 01:06:47,304
They're vaporized immediately...

1059
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:51,704
...by a holy beam
of vapory fire vapor.

1060
01:06:52,404 --> 01:06:54,805
- Can we go in?
- I just told you.

1061
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:58,605
To enter is instant death,
you gorgeous little dunce.

1062
01:06:59,005 --> 01:07:00,305
Can't even poke our heads in?

1063
01:07:00,505 --> 01:07:02,405
You're so young and curious,
aren't you?

1064
01:07:02,605 --> 01:07:06,005
You want to know it all and
taste it all, explore it all, be it all...

1065
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:09,105
...dance with it all, suck it all,
don't you?

1066
01:07:09,805 --> 01:07:11,605
I've got a riddle for you.

1067
01:07:11,705 --> 01:07:13,506
What has two thumbs...

1068
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:15,806
...and is desperate
for another hot-oil rub?

1069
01:07:16,606 --> 01:07:18,906
- What?
- This person.

1070
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:21,306
Come on. Let's go.

1071
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:26,406
- Come. Come quick.
- That will not be a problem.

1072
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:31,006
What are we doing here?

1073
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:34,207
I want you to enter
the Holy of Holies.

1074
01:07:34,307 --> 01:07:36,207
Oh, that is quite a coincidence...

1075
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:39,407
...because I want you to sit
on the Poley of Poleys.

1076
01:07:41,207 --> 01:07:44,707
- Oh, no. That's the Holy of Holies.
- I thought you were talking about...

1077
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:48,107
You have to go in there
and speak to the gods.

1078
01:07:48,307 --> 01:07:50,807
- The gods are in there?
- So they say.

1079
01:07:50,907 --> 01:07:53,308
The only one who goes in there
is the high priest.

1080
01:07:53,508 --> 01:07:56,208
They say it's instant death
for anyone else to enter.

1081
01:07:56,408 --> 01:08:00,708
- Then why am I going in?
- Because you've been chosen.

1082
01:08:00,908 --> 01:08:03,708
If the gods wanted you dead,
they would've killed you already.

1083
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:06,808
- Right.
- This is what you've been chosen for.

1084
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:09,308
To speak to the gods,
divine their purpose...

1085
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:12,809
...and plead with them
to end this terrible famine.

1086
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:15,409
Then come back out
and tell me what it's like inside.

1087
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:16,609
- Okay.
- Okay.

1088
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:18,109
Right.

1089
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:27,309
I'm pretty sure I'm chosen,
but I'm not "sure" sure.

1090
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:29,109
You're chosen.

1091
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:32,610
Okay. I'm gonna go in,
but you gotta do something for me.

1092
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:35,810
- You gotta let my friends go.
- Anything.

1093
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:52,011
Don't kill me, don't kill me,
don't kill me...

1094
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,711
Get up. You look ridiculous.

1095
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:01,111
- Oh? What are you doing here?
- I'm hiding from the high priest.

1096
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,511
I spent the last two hours
rubbing oil on him.

1097
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:06,311
Is that chest hair?

1098
01:09:06,511 --> 01:09:08,712
Not all of it. Just don't ask, okay?

1099
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,912
I've lost my sense
of right and wrong.

1100
01:09:12,112 --> 01:09:14,612
How did you get in here
without getting fried?

1101
01:09:14,812 --> 01:09:16,212
- I don't know. How did you?
- Because I'm a chosen.

1102
01:09:17,312 --> 01:09:20,612
Probably why God didn't kill you:
He knew you were my follower.

1103
01:09:20,712 --> 01:09:23,512
- I'm not your follower.
- Why are you always following me?

1104
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:27,213
I'm not following you. I walk
behind you at the same pace as you.

1105
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:29,613
Not following.
I could be leading from the rear.

1106
01:09:29,713 --> 01:09:32,913
Come on. I'm the leader.
I always have been.

1107
01:09:33,113 --> 01:09:35,213
Some leader.
Told us you were gonna get us out.

1108
01:09:35,413 --> 01:09:38,613
- Just been messing around at orgies.
- Messing around at orgies?

1109
01:09:38,813 --> 01:09:40,013
No, no. I'm not like you.

1110
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:42,913
I don't get to prance around
in gold paint and have fun.

1111
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:46,214
- I have no downtime.
- Please. Your whole life is downtime.

1112
01:09:46,414 --> 01:09:48,814
That's what you think?
That's what everybody thinks.

1113
01:09:49,014 --> 01:09:52,014
I'm about to show you something.
Observe.

1114
01:09:57,214 --> 01:10:01,414
Almighty God, or gods,
whatever the case may be...

1115
01:10:01,814 --> 01:10:03,914
...I need to ask a favor of you.

1116
01:10:04,114 --> 01:10:05,815
I know
I've really messed things up...

1117
01:10:06,815 --> 01:10:10,515
...but I really need to come through
on this one...

1118
01:10:11,315 --> 01:10:14,815
...and I wanna ask you to please give
me the strength to free my friends.

1119
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:18,815
- And that's it, that's the favor.
- Oh, shit.

1120
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,716
And also,
if you could just make it rain...

1121
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:28,616
...or like drizzle without us having
to kill a virgin, you know what I mean?

1122
01:10:28,816 --> 01:10:32,116
Because we need our virgins
at the moment.

1123
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,516
And also, if you could give me
the power...

1124
01:10:35,616 --> 01:10:38,416
...to see through women's clothing
without them knowing...

1125
01:10:38,516 --> 01:10:40,516
...that would be really great.

1126
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:43,517
Hello?

1127
01:10:43,617 --> 01:10:46,017
Hasn't it occurred to you
that it might be silent...

1128
01:10:46,217 --> 01:10:49,917
...because God is not in here?
Look around. There's nothing in here.

1129
01:10:50,117 --> 01:10:52,717
That doesn't prove anything.
Maybe he stepped away.

1130
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:54,717
- For what?
- God stuff.

1131
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,317
If he needs something,
he can create it from nothing.

1132
01:10:57,517 --> 01:11:00,317
What's the point of being God
if you keep running for things?

1133
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:04,518
Let me just put something out there.
Maybe God doesn't exist.

1134
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:09,218
What? So everything is just random?

1135
01:11:09,318 --> 01:11:11,118
Then nothing would mean anything.

1136
01:11:11,318 --> 01:11:13,418
- What would be the point?
- That is the point.

1137
01:11:13,618 --> 01:11:15,518
That there's no point? That's stupid.

1138
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:16,718
- You're stupid.
- No.

1139
01:11:16,918 --> 01:11:20,118
- There's something bigger than me.
- There's nothing bigger than you.

1140
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,319
- Don't touch my belly to make a point.
- Fine.

1141
01:11:22,519 --> 01:11:26,019
- Okay. I'm sorry, I have a man's body.
- I'm maturing at my own pace.

1142
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:29,719
- You are so jealous of me.
- Jealous? That you're a bullshit artist?

1143
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:32,919
That every time you speak,
it's bullshit coming out of your mouth?

1144
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,319
You would believe in God
if you've ever been with a woman.

1145
01:11:36,419 --> 01:11:38,919
- I'm a virgin by choice.
- Not your choice.

1146
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:40,820
- Take that back.
- I won't.

1147
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,320
- Take back what you said.
- Take back what you said.

1148
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,820
Everything you've ever said.

1149
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,320
Don't stand close.
Get your belly off of my belly.

1150
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:48,720
Don't touch my belly.

1151
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,120
I don't want to touch bellies with you,
ever.

1152
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,020
Take everything
you've ever said back.

1153
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,220
- You're out of control.
- You're a freak.

1154
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,921
- Stop screaming, stop screaming.
- You're a freak! Get off me.

1155
01:12:02,521 --> 01:12:06,121
I can pull this thing together.
The princess is right out there.

1156
01:12:06,321 --> 01:12:07,721
And if I play this right...

1157
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:11,021
...I'm gonna get us all out of here,
Maya and Eema too.

1158
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:13,321
Just trust in me. Have a little faith.

1159
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:17,121
Fine, but not for you. For Eema.
And I'm too tired to argue right now.

1160
01:12:17,321 --> 01:12:20,822
I had a long hot bath with the
high priest, and I'm lightheaded.

1161
01:12:21,022 --> 01:12:23,422
I'm sorry for squeezing you so hard.

1162
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:26,622
Let's go. Freak.

1163
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,522
God, if you do exist,
if you make Eema love me...

1164
01:12:33,822 --> 01:12:37,023
...I would be very grateful. Okay?

1165
01:12:37,723 --> 01:12:39,523
If you do exist.

1166
01:12:43,723 --> 01:12:45,223
You guys waiting to go in there?

1167
01:12:45,423 --> 01:12:47,523
Because I gotta say:
Not that big a deal.

1168
01:12:47,723 --> 01:12:50,523
If you see a broken penis,
it was like that when we went in.

1169
01:12:50,623 --> 01:12:51,723
Seize him.

1170
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:54,823
I'm seized.

1171
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:04,124
I wish I was upside down.

1172
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:08,024
Looks kind of fun.

1173
01:13:09,124 --> 01:13:11,024
Is it fun?

1174
01:13:13,424 --> 01:13:15,525
So you're not talking to me?

1175
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,325
We're not friends anymore,
after all I've done for you?

1176
01:13:18,425 --> 01:13:21,325
- What have you done for me?
- I brought you out of your shell.

1177
01:13:21,425 --> 01:13:24,825
Yeah? I liked my shell.
I liked the village.

1178
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:28,525
Because of you, I'm in this horrible
place where brothers kill brothers...

1179
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:31,425
...and they burn women
and they make people slaves.

1180
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,625
People cut off
the ends of their penises...

1181
01:13:33,825 --> 01:13:36,726
...and their testicles and I'm
never gonna see Eema again...

1182
01:13:36,926 --> 01:13:38,426
...and it's because of you.

1183
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:42,126
Please forgive me.
I mean, you are my best friend.

1184
01:13:42,326 --> 01:13:44,526
I hate the world! I hate you!

1185
01:13:44,726 --> 01:13:48,526
And now I'm hanging upside down
and I really have to pee.

1186
01:13:48,726 --> 01:13:50,126
I know I'm not perfect.

1187
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:54,627
And maybe I made a few wrong turns,
but you gotta understand I'm chosen.

1188
01:13:54,727 --> 01:13:57,427
That's a lot of responsibility.
You can't even imagine.

1189
01:13:57,627 --> 01:14:01,127
The only one that thinks that you're
chosen is you. So shut up already!

1190
01:14:01,327 --> 01:14:05,427
I'm gonna get us out of this thing
if it's the last thing I do.

1191
01:14:19,228 --> 01:14:21,428
That was just my first idea.

1192
01:14:21,828 --> 01:14:23,328
I'm also accepting ideas.

1193
01:14:23,428 --> 01:14:27,328
Guard!
The upside down prisoner has to pee!

1194
01:14:27,928 --> 01:14:30,528
Oh, I'm peeing.

1195
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:34,529
Oh, no.

1196
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:36,329
Try to keep your mouth closed.

1197
01:14:40,729 --> 01:14:42,429
Oh, no. In the nose.

1198
01:14:46,129 --> 01:14:51,230
Hey, I'm peeing on my face too,
on the inside.

1199
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:53,130
I hate you.

1200
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,630
Observe, my dear...

1201
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:07,430
...since it was you
who lured him to his death.

1202
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:12,431
"For the crimes of blasphemy...

1203
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:15,231
...heresy...

1204
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:17,431
...conspiracy... "

1205
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,031
- What you thinking about?
- "Treachery...

1206
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:21,431
...leprosy... "

1207
01:15:21,631 --> 01:15:22,931
Trying to make conversation.

1208
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:24,731
"Puppetry...

1209
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:28,532
...hyperbole... "
- Your hair looks really good today.

1210
01:15:28,632 --> 01:15:31,732
- I peed all over it.
- Then that's the secret, I guess.

1211
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:33,532
"Sodomy... "

1212
01:15:35,132 --> 01:15:38,932
- Oh, it's "refusal of sodomy. "
- Yeah!

1213
01:15:39,932 --> 01:15:41,432
Can you just forgive me?

1214
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:43,232
I think I hate you too much.

1215
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:46,532
"Lechery
and the murder of my brother, Abel. "

1216
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:48,433
- Oh, come on!
- Shut it!

1217
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:51,833
For these, and other crimes...

1218
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:55,133
...the prisoners shall be stoned...

1219
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,733
...to death!

1220
01:15:58,733 --> 01:16:02,633
- Wait! Can I make a suggestion?
- What?

1221
01:16:02,733 --> 01:16:06,033
Just have one person throw stones
at us.

1222
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:11,334
In fact, I think it would be fair if you
let us choose who gets to stone us.

1223
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:15,034
No. That doesn't make any...

1224
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:17,534
- We want that guy.
- That guy.

1225
01:16:17,734 --> 01:16:19,734
- Me?
- That's our stoner.

1226
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:22,934
What, just because I'm a eunuch
you don't think I can throw?

1227
01:16:23,134 --> 01:16:25,134
I'll show you throwing.

1228
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:28,535
No, no. No, no, no! Gross.

1229
01:16:28,735 --> 01:16:33,035
Did he just hurl his own ball at him?
How spectacular.

1230
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:35,635
No! That doesn't count.
That was a testicle.

1231
01:16:35,835 --> 01:16:37,035
I think it counts.

1232
01:16:37,135 --> 01:16:39,535
- Pick somebody else.
- What is that idiot doing?

1233
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:42,535
- I pick that guy!
- Nice.

1234
01:16:42,635 --> 01:16:44,335
- This guy?
- No, no, the shorter man.

1235
01:16:44,535 --> 01:16:46,436
Right in front of him.

1236
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:48,136
It's a kid. This is a kid.

1237
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:50,936
So? You got something against kids?
This guy hates kids.

1238
01:16:51,136 --> 01:16:53,836
- Let me smite him!
- Kid hater!

1239
01:16:54,436 --> 01:16:57,336
- One shot!
- No, they're our future!

1240
01:16:57,436 --> 01:16:59,936
All right. Hey, go ahead and...

1241
01:17:00,936 --> 01:17:02,036
Okay. I'm hit.

1242
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,437
Holy shit, that kid's got an arm.

1243
01:17:06,637 --> 01:17:08,637
God. There's two of us.

1244
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:09,837
Are you guys happy now?

1245
01:17:10,037 --> 01:17:16,137
Okay! Everybody on this side,
on the count of three! One, two...

1246
01:17:16,337 --> 01:17:19,337
Wait! I have a question for the king.

1247
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:24,538
Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies?

1248
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:32,338
Yes! I entered the Holy of Holies
and, lo, I did not die.

1249
01:17:32,538 --> 01:17:37,938
Why? Because I was chosen
by the gods!

1250
01:17:39,138 --> 01:17:43,539
<i>Spare the chosen one!
Spare the chosen one!</i>

1251
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:47,939
<i>Spare the chosen one!
Spare the chosen one!</i>

1252
01:17:48,139 --> 01:17:50,939
- Spare the chosen one!
- And his friend!

1253
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:54,239
- And his young friend.
- Don't kill either of them.

1254
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:57,039
Everyone knows
the chosen gets a plus one.

1255
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,139
Is it possible? Is he truly chosen?

1256
01:17:59,339 --> 01:18:02,540
Well, of course it's possible.
Highly doubtful.

1257
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:04,940
Majesty, with respect...

1258
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,840
...whether he is chosen or not
is no longer the issue.

1259
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,840
If you were to kill him now,
given the public mood...

1260
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,040
...it could inflame the situation
so as...

1261
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:20,541
...to cause a radical regime change.

1262
01:18:21,341 --> 01:18:24,241
If you take my meaning.

1263
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:27,941
Yes, that will do.

1264
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:38,441
It is the judgment of our merciful king
that the prisoners be enslaved...

1265
01:18:38,641 --> 01:18:45,042
...to toil at hard labor until they die
of starvation or exhaustion!

1266
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:46,242
Yes!

1267
01:18:46,442 --> 01:18:48,442
And how is that better?

1268
01:18:59,643 --> 01:19:02,343
You seem to enjoy your work.
How long have you been a slave?

1269
01:19:02,543 --> 01:19:04,743
Oh, I'm not a slave. I'm a volunteer.

1270
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:10,743
Marlak. Enmebaragesi.
Long time no see.

1271
01:19:13,543 --> 01:19:14,543
I deserve that.

1272
01:19:14,743 --> 01:19:18,044
Take these bricks up top.
The masons are waiting.

1273
01:19:18,244 --> 01:19:22,044
I would but I did something to my
neck. I think I slept on it funny.

1274
01:19:22,144 --> 01:19:25,544
I should probably take it easy,
or I'll be no good for work tomorrow.

1275
01:19:25,644 --> 01:19:27,644
Move!

1276
01:19:27,744 --> 01:19:30,244
You know,
the mud's really good for your skin.

1277
01:19:30,944 --> 01:19:32,944
- Yeah.
- Ask me why my skin's so good.

1278
01:19:34,044 --> 01:19:35,444
- Why's your skin?...
- The mud.

1279
01:19:35,544 --> 01:19:37,045
I knew you were gonna say that.

1280
01:19:41,745 --> 01:19:44,045
You gotta love being outside.

1281
01:19:44,645 --> 01:19:46,545
Move it!

1282
01:19:47,645 --> 01:19:49,045
Faster!

1283
01:19:52,945 --> 01:19:56,046
- Want some water?
- You're from the village, aren't you?

1284
01:19:57,246 --> 01:19:59,546
I'll bet you wish you were back there
right now.

1285
01:19:59,946 --> 01:20:01,746
- Yeah.
- Don't give up.

1286
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:03,546
You'll get home someday.

1287
01:20:05,746 --> 01:20:08,346
Who's gonna take him there?
The chosen one?

1288
01:20:23,347 --> 01:20:25,847
You two, up! Get on line. Now.

1289
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:28,347
- Where are we going?
- To watch the sacrifice.

1290
01:20:28,547 --> 01:20:31,047
- The king demands it.
- Is it compulsory?

1291
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:35,348
There was some work that I wanted to
finish doing, get a jump on tomorrow.

1292
01:20:36,148 --> 01:20:38,848
I'd like to see how big you are
without that whip.

1293
01:20:40,348 --> 01:20:41,748
Same basic size.

1294
01:20:43,448 --> 01:20:45,148
All is in readiness, Your Majesty.

1295
01:20:45,348 --> 01:20:47,348
What now?
More virgins to sacrifice?

1296
01:20:49,548 --> 01:20:53,149
Yes, two. Your own handmaiden
and another slave.

1297
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:57,249
Followers of the chosen one.
Discovered by this loyal soldier.

1298
01:20:57,449 --> 01:21:00,949
Oh, I was just doing my job.
It's what I do.

1299
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:06,749
And one more to demonstrate
our own faith and charity.

1300
01:21:09,349 --> 01:21:12,350
For the love of the people,
and the heavenly gift of rain...

1301
01:21:12,385 --> 01:21:15,550
...we offer a humble sacrifice:

1302
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:18,650
...our own stepdaughter...

1303
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,550
...the Princess Inanna.

1304
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:28,050
- You're insane.
- For the good of the people, darling.

1305
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,050
- You wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't I?

1306
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,351
If you like,
I can arrange for you to join her.

1307
01:21:35,651 --> 01:21:36,851
Mother.

1308
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:39,651
How long did you think
I would tolerate your insolence?

1309
01:21:40,551 --> 01:21:42,451
Burn her.

1310
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:51,652
Drink it. You won't feel a thing.

1311
01:21:57,652 --> 01:22:00,652
Are they booing me?
How dare they.

1312
01:22:00,752 --> 01:22:02,752
They love you.
They're wooing you.

1313
01:22:09,753 --> 01:22:12,153
That's fine. You know?

1314
01:22:23,853 --> 01:22:28,054
It's Maya! And Eema!
Wait, Maya's a virgin?

1315
01:22:28,154 --> 01:22:29,254
No, don't kill them!

1316
01:22:29,354 --> 01:22:32,054
- Far enough, slave.
- No, kill me! I'm a male virgin.

1317
01:22:32,254 --> 01:22:34,654
Marlak, we can't let them
do this! Eema!

1318
01:22:34,854 --> 01:22:37,654
Eema. Eema!

1319
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:42,354
- I gotta get down there.
- Over my dead body.

1320
01:22:42,454 --> 01:22:46,454
- No problem.
- No. Hey! Hey! Hey!

1321
01:22:48,855 --> 01:22:52,655
- Thanks, Marlak.
- Now what?

1322
01:22:52,855 --> 01:22:57,055
We implore the great gods
to show us a sign...

1323
01:22:57,155 --> 01:22:59,455
...so that we may honor
your divine will.

1324
01:22:59,655 --> 01:23:02,455
Take this end. Lower me down.

1325
01:23:20,856 --> 01:23:22,356
Oh, dear.

1326
01:23:22,556 --> 01:23:24,156
Oh, no.

1327
01:23:58,558 --> 01:24:00,158
- What is it?
- It's a sign.

1328
01:24:00,358 --> 01:24:04,959
The chosen one comes! It's a sign!
He's going to end our suffering!

1329
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:07,059
Fight the power! Yes, we can!

1330
01:24:13,559 --> 01:24:14,759
All together!

1331
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,059
Let's cut some foreskins!

1332
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,960
I knew
I could depend upon your loyalty.

1333
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,960
Assholes.

1334
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,160
Burn them. Burn them now.
Burn them all!

1335
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,461
Don't struggle,
it's the will of the gods.

1336
01:24:41,661 --> 01:24:42,861
I don't think so.

1337
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:44,761
Zed!

1338
01:24:44,961 --> 01:24:46,661
Guards!

1339
01:24:47,661 --> 01:24:49,561
- Sorry!
- Stupid.

1340
01:24:50,161 --> 01:24:53,961
Ma'am? Okay? All right?
Get the message?

1341
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:57,061
Okay, we should be safe in here.

1342
01:24:57,461 --> 01:24:59,261
Thank you.

1343
01:25:09,362 --> 01:25:11,662
So, Eema, this might be a bad time
to say this...

1344
01:25:11,862 --> 01:25:14,462
...but that stuff
that you saw the other night...

1345
01:25:14,662 --> 01:25:16,862
...with the high priest, that...

1346
01:25:17,062 --> 01:25:20,363
He's a friend.
That was totally not a gay thing.

1347
01:25:29,363 --> 01:25:31,963
I always thought
that you and I had a connection.

1348
01:25:32,063 --> 01:25:33,763
So I just wanted to mention it now.

1349
01:25:33,863 --> 01:25:35,963
I always thought that we had
one and maybe...

1350
01:25:36,163 --> 01:25:38,264
...thought you might've
felt the same.

1351
01:25:38,364 --> 01:25:41,564
I just wanted to maybe bring it up
and see what you would say.

1352
01:25:53,164 --> 01:25:56,464
But I always thought... I always
have felt a certain way about you.

1353
01:25:56,664 --> 01:25:58,565
I don't know if you know or not
but you...

1354
01:25:58,765 --> 01:26:02,265
All those dead birds
that were always outside of your hut...

1355
01:26:02,465 --> 01:26:04,165
...those were from me.

1356
01:26:04,365 --> 01:26:06,565
- Just kiss me.
- From me like a gift for you.

1357
01:26:06,665 --> 01:26:09,065
I don't know,
I thought you'd like those.

1358
01:26:16,065 --> 01:26:18,766
I always thought that you could
maybe use the dead birds...

1359
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:20,166
...in a soup or something.

1360
01:26:20,366 --> 01:26:22,766
Or, I don't know,
I thought they were practical.

1361
01:26:29,366 --> 01:26:31,366
Should I take off my undercloth?

1362
01:26:35,367 --> 01:26:38,567
Oh, tough guy, huh?
You want a piece of me?

1363
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:41,367
I'm gonna bash your head in.

1364
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:47,367
That was a nice shot.

1365
01:26:51,767 --> 01:26:53,067
Hey.

1366
01:26:53,467 --> 01:26:54,468
Hey.

1367
01:27:02,668 --> 01:27:04,468
Zed!

1368
01:27:06,468 --> 01:27:08,468
Get up and die like a man.

1369
01:27:08,868 --> 01:27:11,568
Nobody harm this woman.
She's not a virgin anymore.

1370
01:27:11,668 --> 01:27:15,169
- He's not either.
- I saved her life with my lovemaking.

1371
01:27:16,669 --> 01:27:19,369
Sit tight, Mama. Daddy's gotta fight.

1372
01:27:25,269 --> 01:27:28,169
Okay. No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, don't kill him!

1373
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,369
What?

1374
01:27:30,569 --> 01:27:32,670
I just had sex with my new girlfriend.

1375
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:34,870
- So?
- I had to tell somebody. It was great.

1376
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:38,470
I loved it. I'm hoping
I'm gonna get another opportunity.

1377
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,270
- What's going on behind you?
- I'm not falling for that.

1378
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:46,870
Sodomize this!

1379
01:28:01,871 --> 01:28:03,371
Hey, Zed!

1380
01:28:04,471 --> 01:28:05,571
- Stop! No!
- Get back!

1381
01:28:05,771 --> 01:28:06,871
- Let her go!
- No!

1382
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:09,171
The gods demand a sacrifice.
You're ruining it!

1383
01:28:09,371 --> 01:28:11,572
- How about a little more oil?
- Yes, darling?

1384
01:28:20,372 --> 01:28:22,572
I always knew you'd break my heart.

1385
01:28:23,372 --> 01:28:25,072
A little hot!

1386
01:28:34,473 --> 01:28:36,173
That was ironic.

1387
01:28:43,473 --> 01:28:45,673
So...

1388
01:28:46,473 --> 01:28:48,173
...on behalf of the whole city...

1389
01:28:48,273 --> 01:28:51,174
...I'd like to thank the high priest
for his sacrifice.

1390
01:28:51,274 --> 01:28:53,774
That was really something,
wasn't it?

1391
01:28:53,874 --> 01:28:56,274
Come on. Put your hands together,
it makes a sound.

1392
01:29:13,275 --> 01:29:18,675
<i>The chosen one! The chosen one!
The chosen one! The chosen one!</i>

1393
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:27,376
Okay, that was a little confusing,
wasn't it?

1394
01:29:28,976 --> 01:29:30,376
Was that a sign from the gods?

1395
01:29:31,276 --> 01:29:33,076
Everybody wants to know.

1396
01:29:34,176 --> 01:29:36,876
Well, I should know,
because I'm the chosen one, right?

1397
01:29:36,976 --> 01:29:39,176
Yeah!

1398
01:29:40,176 --> 01:29:41,276
You respect me.

1399
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:42,976
Yeah!

1400
01:29:43,776 --> 01:29:44,876
You love me.

1401
01:29:44,976 --> 01:29:46,677
Yeah!

1402
01:29:47,177 --> 01:29:48,577
You fear me.

1403
01:29:48,777 --> 01:29:50,977
Yeah!

1404
01:29:51,177 --> 01:29:52,877
You would worship me.

1405
01:29:53,077 --> 01:29:54,677
Yeah!

1406
01:29:56,477 --> 01:29:58,177
Yeah!

1407
01:30:06,978 --> 01:30:08,078
Well, don't.

1408
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,778
- Yeah!
- No.

1409
01:30:10,978 --> 01:30:13,978
And I'm not saying, "Don't" like,
"I'm the chosen one, so don't. "

1410
01:30:14,178 --> 01:30:17,378
I'm saying, "Don't"
because I'm not the chosen one.

1411
01:30:18,678 --> 01:30:23,178
I thought I was, but I'm not, sorry.

1412
01:30:23,378 --> 01:30:25,279
Turns out I'm just a guy
from the woods...

1413
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:30,379
...who was lucky enough to have these
great friends to watch my back.

1414
01:30:33,579 --> 01:30:35,679
I'm telling you, you don't need me.

1415
01:30:35,779 --> 01:30:39,479
You know what? Maybe we can all
make our own destiny.

1416
01:30:40,179 --> 01:30:42,579
Yeah. Maybe we could all
be chosen.

1417
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:44,380
Yeah.

1418
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:48,580
- You! You could be chosen!
- Yeah!

1419
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:52,480
- And you! And you!
- Yeah!

1420
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,480
Way over in the back! You, little guy!

1421
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,980
Yeah!

1422
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:28,982
- So you're queen.
- Couldn't have done it without you.

1423
01:31:29,182 --> 01:31:30,182
Yeah, you could've.

1424
01:31:30,382 --> 01:31:32,382
No, really, I tried for years and...

1425
01:31:32,582 --> 01:31:36,982
All right, maybe you couldn't have.
I was pretty amazing with the old...

1426
01:31:37,682 --> 01:31:41,083
Sorry about almost luring you
to your death.

1427
01:31:41,283 --> 01:31:43,783
Oh, please.

1428
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,583
All right.

1429
01:31:48,983 --> 01:31:50,283
Okay.

1430
01:31:51,383 --> 01:31:53,083
See you later.

1431
01:31:55,383 --> 01:31:56,783
Come on, people.

1432
01:31:56,983 --> 01:31:59,083
- Pick up that bag of camel dung.
- Yes, sir.

1433
01:31:59,183 --> 01:32:00,584
Hang on to it all day.

1434
01:32:00,784 --> 01:32:02,884
Hustle up.
These donkeys don't pack themselves.

1435
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:05,584
- I will kill you where you stand.
- Relax.

1436
01:32:05,784 --> 01:32:09,284
They cut a little off the end but there's
plenty more where that came from.

1437
01:32:09,484 --> 01:32:11,984
This is my woman.
Stay away from her, or I'll kill you.

1438
01:32:12,184 --> 01:32:14,184
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
- Just go.

1439
01:32:14,384 --> 01:32:15,984
Get out of here or I'll kill you.

1440
01:32:16,084 --> 01:32:17,684
Cranky today.

1441
01:32:17,884 --> 01:32:21,085
So are you still thinking
about going to Egypt?

1442
01:32:21,285 --> 01:32:24,185
Supposed to be a real happening
place. You coming with or not?

1443
01:32:24,385 --> 01:32:28,685
Well, I mean, I was kind of
planning on going anyway, so...

1444
01:32:31,985 --> 01:32:34,385
Let me show you this new style.
Everyone's doing it.

1445
01:32:34,585 --> 01:32:37,786
You open your mouth really wide.
It makes it way sexier.

1446
01:32:40,986 --> 01:32:45,286
I'm thinking about introducing the
tongue, but I haven't perfected it yet.

1447
01:32:45,486 --> 01:32:48,086
- You know, we'll work on that.
- All right.

1448
01:32:51,486 --> 01:32:54,286
Look at us. Two men.

1449
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:57,687
One going to lead a village and
the other going to explore the world.

1450
01:32:57,787 --> 01:32:59,887
You sure you don't wanna come back,
help me?

1451
01:33:00,087 --> 01:33:03,787
You don't need me. Everybody knows
you're the smartest guy in the village.

1452
01:33:03,987 --> 01:33:07,087
Gonna know you're the most
incredible warrior anyone's ever seen.

1453
01:33:07,287 --> 01:33:10,587
The way you punched that lady? Man!

1454
01:33:10,787 --> 01:33:11,787
I mean, you know...

1455
01:33:11,987 --> 01:33:15,488
She left me no choice, so I had to,
you know, punch her in the face.

1456
01:33:17,488 --> 01:33:19,988
Well, we'll tell stories about you
around the fire.

1457
01:33:20,588 --> 01:33:23,788
Strangers shake hands.
Get that thing out of here.

1458
01:33:28,488 --> 01:33:31,288
- I'm gonna miss you, little guy.
- I'm gonna miss you more.

1459
01:33:31,788 --> 01:33:34,689
Just trying to sniff you.
I wanna remember your scent.

1460
01:33:35,089 --> 01:33:37,789
That's probably the urine in my hair.

1461
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:44,389
I can't let them see me cry.
They respect me too much.

1462
01:33:44,589 --> 01:33:49,189
Me too. On three.
One, two, three, break.

1463
01:33:52,489 --> 01:33:54,690
Well, may the gods smile on you.
See you around.

1464
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:56,790
Whatever. Later.

1465
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:58,590
- Oh?
- What?

1466
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:03,390
I want you to have babies
with my sister.

1467
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:08,290
- Try and stop me.
- All right, man.

1468
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:12,490
- Zed, may the gods smile on you.
- You said that.

1469
01:34:12,591 --> 01:34:14,591
- May they. Yeah.
- Thank you, though.

1470
01:34:15,991 --> 01:34:19,791
All right come on, folks. We're heading
out now because I say so, all right?

1471
01:34:19,891 --> 01:34:23,391
What's the deal? Come on, Lindsey.
Come on, everyone's looking.

1472
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:26,891
Please. Go. Good.

1473
01:34:27,091 --> 01:34:29,091
To the north!

1474
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:32,692
You know that that's west.

1475
01:34:32,892 --> 01:34:34,792
I was just checking to see
if you knew.

1476
01:34:34,992 --> 01:34:36,892
To the west!

1477
01:34:37,492 --> 01:34:39,792
I'm already glad you're here.

1478
01:35:00,093 --> 01:35:02,993
One, two, three, foreskin!

1479
01:35:03,393 --> 01:35:06,393
Invoke your blessing
and do your will.

1480
01:35:06,593 --> 01:35:08,893
What's the fucking line? What is it?

1481
01:35:09,093 --> 01:35:10,994
It was a game.
It was a game of chance...

1482
01:35:11,094 --> 01:35:13,494
...and he hit his head
and he killed himself.

1483
01:35:13,594 --> 01:35:16,694
If anything, it was a suicide.
Okay.

1484
01:35:16,894 --> 01:35:18,894
I let one go.

1485
01:35:20,294 --> 01:35:26,294
In honor of the chosen one,
as my first official act as your queen...

1486
01:35:26,494 --> 01:35:28,594
...I'm going to go back
and say the line again.

1487
01:35:28,794 --> 01:35:32,095
- Let's go back. Do you wanna try it?
- Yeah.

1488
01:35:32,295 --> 01:35:33,595
You just want it all.

1489
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:36,395
You want to taste it all
and know it all and feel it all.

1490
01:35:36,595 --> 01:35:39,595
And suck it all in and blow it all out
your backside, don't you?

1491
01:35:39,795 --> 01:35:41,395
Sorry.

1492
01:35:45,295 --> 01:35:48,296
It's like the Great Turtle coming out
of the sea, you know?

1493
01:35:48,496 --> 01:35:52,096
It's like with the earth on its back,
you understand?

1494
01:35:52,296 --> 01:35:54,496
I'm an oilman.

1495
01:35:55,096 --> 01:35:59,196
You're cursed, Zed, and if you don't
leave here we're all gonna be cursed.

1496
01:35:59,396 --> 01:36:02,796
And it drank up the ocean,
then pooped out the mountains...

1497
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:05,596
...and the first man
fell from the stars.

1498
01:36:05,796 --> 01:36:09,097
This is... I don't... This doesn't make
a lot of sense, guys.

1499
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:11,297
Can I talk to Harold?
Is that?...

1500
01:36:28,798 --> 01:36:29,998
What's that?

1501
01:36:30,198 --> 01:36:34,098
What's that?
A strange Gorgon from another time!

1502
01:36:34,298 --> 01:36:37,898
I weep for the suffering
of my people.

1503
01:36:38,898 --> 01:36:39,998
We're getting boned...

1504
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:42,498
...by the planes, the trains,
and the what, huh?

1505
01:36:42,598 --> 01:36:43,698
Zed?

1506
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,699
- Oh, that's great.
- Zed? It's constricting me.

1507
01:36:46,999 --> 01:36:49,899
Can I show you this new kiss
I been thinking about?

1508
01:36:50,099 --> 01:36:53,299
- Yeah.
- It's called a tongue kiss.

1509
01:36:57,599 --> 01:37:00,799
- It's strange. Yeah. Okay.
- Still perfecting it, yeah.

1510
01:37:00,999 --> 01:37:03,299
- It's fine.
- All right.

1511
01:37:03,499 --> 01:37:05,100
What?

1512
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,000
And camera reloading!
