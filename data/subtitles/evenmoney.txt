<i>find their dream...</i>

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>and work backwards.</i>

5
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,200
<i>We're all chasing something.</i>

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>More money...</i>

7
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>more love.</i>

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,700
<i>I don't know,
maybe just one more chance.</i>

9
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
<i>What we're looking for is...</i>

10
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,700
<i>more life.</i>

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,500
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,000
<i>More of this beautiful life.</i>

13
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,900
<i>But if you're not careful...</i>

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,300
<i>you might go looking for more...</i>

15
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,000
<i>and wind up with less.</i>

16
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,200
Come on. Come on.

17
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,700
This time.

18
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
I know. I know.

19
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
I know.

20
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,000
We'll talk about it later.

21
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>- Half an hour, I'll be home.
- Good evening...</i>

22
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,300
<i>- basketball fans...
- Love you too. Bye.</i>

23
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,900
<i>And welcome
to basketball action.</i>

24
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,400
<i>One of the better games
you will see all season.</i>

25
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,500
The Eagles of Saint Francis
taking on the Matadors of Loyola.

26
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,200
Here we go!

27
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,800
Here we go!

28
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
Here we go!

29
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,800
Matadors. Matadors.

30
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,400
What? What? What?

31
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
- What? What?
- All right.

32
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
Bring it on in here.

33
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,000
<i>A match up featuring two
of the premier guards in the league...</i>

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,700
<i>Godfrey Snow and Darius Jackson.</i>

35
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,400
<i>- St. Francis on the breakaway.
- There you go!</i>

36
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,000
<i>Godfrey Snow!</i>

37
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,100
<i>- What a jump!
- Godfrey!</i>

38
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,400
<i>Darius Jackson...</i>

39
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
<i>manhandles through the lane.
No one can stop him.</i>

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,900
<i>Up for the lay-up.
It's good.</i>

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
<i>Godfrey Snow working
two defenders.</i>

42
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,700
Come on, Godfrey.
Make it look easy.

43
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,800
<i>Wide open in the corner.
For three.</i>

44
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
<i>It's good.</i>

45
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,100
That's right.

46
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,900
That's right.
That's my little brother.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Careful, it's hot.

48
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,700
It needs more salt.

49
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,700
- A little.
- Dad, I eat salt with everything.

50
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,700
- I know.
- Mom's finally home.

51
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,200
- You know, I never liked him anyway.
- Dad, you told me you did.

52
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,500
You're too good for him,
Nicole.

53
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,900
He told me he likes
this Rebecca Simons girl.

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
She's such a slut.

55
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
She's got pierced nipples.

56
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,800
What?

57
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,800
Why would someone do that
to herself?

58
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Pain's pleasure.
Haven't you ever heard that, dad?

59
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,300
- No, I have not.
- Dad, do you think I'm pretty?

60
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,700
Tell the truth.

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
- Nicole Carver, you are beautiful.
- You have to say that.

62
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,200
I absolutely do not.

63
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Hey, guys.

64
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

65
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,900
Thanks for waiting.

66
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,100
I'm starving, mom.
I feel like an Ethiopian.

67
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,100
I know, baby. I know.

68
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,000
Please tell me you finished
the great American novel already.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Almost. Almost.

70
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,300
What are you doing?
It smells delicious.

71
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,600
It's African groundnut stew.

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
It's the recipe from the magazine
section. I'm the best, aren't I?

73
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,300
I'll say.

74
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,400
Mom...

75
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,300
do you want my advice?

76
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,700
What?

77
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,900
Put a lot of sex into it so that
people actually want to read it.

78
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,100
Not like the last one.

79
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
- Nicole.
- What?

80
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,700
Aren't we supposed to be honest
in this house all the time?

81
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,100
That's the rule, right?

82
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,600
Uh, that's the rule.

83
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,500
I'm just trying to help, mom.

84
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,400
And I love you for it.

85
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,000
You smell like smoke.

86
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, that's the coffee shop.

87
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
Hey, come on! Come on.
Come on. Come on.

88
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,300
<i>Snow finding room behind
the three-point arc.</i>

89
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,800
<i>It's good.</i>

90
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,800
<i>No one can stop Darius Jackson
from getting to the hole.</i>

91
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,800
- Do something with the ball.
- Back up.

92
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,500
- What?
- Back up.

93
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on, do something.

94
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,200
What? What?
Whatcha got?

95
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,900
<i>Snow, nice through the defense.</i>

96
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,900
<i>Another dunk. The Matadors down one.
Fifty-eight, fifty-seven.</i>

97
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,800
<i>Jackson, all the way to the basket.
Loyola takes the lead!</i>

98
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,800
That's it.

99
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,300
<i>You know they say big time players
make big time plays.</i>

100
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,500
<i>Who's going to make the play now?</i>

101
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,200
All right. All right, G.

102
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,200
You are a rookie.
You heard me?

103
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

104
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,600
<i>Roberts on the inbound
over to Snow.</i>

105
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,800
<i>He can't find anything.
Gives it up.</i>

106
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,800
<i>Snow working up the baseline.</i>

107
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,400
<i>Off the corner for the three
and the win.</i>

108
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,400
<i>It's no good. It's no good.</i>

109
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,200
<i>Loyola wins it.</i>

110
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,600
<i>A heartbreaking loss
for St. Francis...</i>

111
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,100
<i>and more specifically
for Godfrey Snow.</i>

112
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,800
That's a nice shot. Rookies always choke
under pressure, punk.

113
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,200
Too-da-Ioo.

114
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,000
Damn.

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,700
All right, Clyde

116
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,000
How could you have missed
that shot?

117
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,100
You've been doing that shot
a hundred times everyday.

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,100
This ain't no game.

119
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,800
You got scouts
looking at you.

120
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,300
That's what you've been working for.
What's going on?

121
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,600
I don't know, man.

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,700
You're going to hit
that shot next time, right?

123
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
I choked in there, Clyde.

124
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,300
I don't care about that game.
That game's over.

125
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
We can't get that back.

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,700
You're going to run against these boys
again in the next tournament.

127
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,400
And you know
what's going to happen?

128
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,100
It's going to be about you.

129
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,400
It's going to be about you.

130
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,600
Ain't nobody in this world can stop
Godfrey Snow but Godfrey Snow.

131
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,400
Nobody.

132
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,200
And you got to own that.

133
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,600
Can I hear it? Let me hear it.

134
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,900
Let me hear it.

135
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,800
Where's Godfrey Snow?
I'm sorry, did anybody see Godfrey?

136
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,900
Where's Godfrey Snow?
Godfrey!

137
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,400
Come on...

138
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,700
you see that boy Jackson?

139
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,000
He got pro scouts looking at him.

140
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,700
And you held your own.

141
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,500
What's that say about you?

142
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,700
You're going to have say something
or I'm gonna slap you upside your head.

143
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,700
- I own it.
- I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.

144
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,000
I own it!

145
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,000
- Can I just get a little bit of noise?
- I own it.

146
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,300
- One more time.
- I own it!

147
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,300
That's what I'm talking about.
You own it. You're Godfrey Snow.

148
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,700
You're Godfrey Snow. All right?

149
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,500
Cool. Cool. Here.
Why don't you...

150
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,200
go get yourself something to eat
with your friends.

151
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,600
I gotta roll because I got a call
about a busted pipe.

152
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,600
They got you working
overtime again?

153
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,700
I'm a black man.
I work all the time.

154
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,300
Clyde, you know there ain't going to be
no more working once I get to the NBA.

155
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,200
That's what I'm talking about.
There he is.

156
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,600
- I own it.
- You own it!

157
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
That's my man.
Yeah!

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,100
Godfrey Snow!

159
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,400
Hit him hard this time, Murph,
so he finally understands, huh?

160
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,200
You know what the fucking doctor said?
The doctor said I suffer from stress.

161
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,600
Stress.
I don't feel any stress.

162
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,800
I hate doctors.

163
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,800
Maybe I have stress
and I don't even know I have stress.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
Is that even possible?

165
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
- Is he here?
- No.

166
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
This guy. We never should have taken
this guy's action, man.

167
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,600
He's a pain in my ass.

168
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,500
Oh, he's all right, man.
I know him from way back.

169
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,100
We're trying to run a business here,
Murph. Remember?

170
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,600
She's something, Aug.

171
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,100
I can't stop thinking
about her, man.

172
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,400
Murph, what did I say?

173
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,300
It's not going away.
I really love her, man. No shit.

174
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,800
It'll pass.
It always passes, Murph.

175
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
But this is different.
It's like...

176
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,800
- It's like in here, you know.
- In here you mean.

177
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,800
- Oh, fuck you!
- Fuck me.

178
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,800
You'll see, Murph.
It'll pass. It always does.

179
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,200
He's here.

180
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,400
We'll both hit him.

181
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,800
I told you I'll get you
the money, Murph!

182
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
I don't get it, Clyde.

183
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,400
I pay plumbers a lot of money.
So, what's the fucking problem?

184
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Murph, what you hitting me for?
You're my boy!

185
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
- Oh, you're his boy?
- Shut up, Clyde.

186
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,900
What is this?

187
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,100
We got history!

188
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
I think what Murph
is trying to explain to you...

189
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,800
is that we are running
a fucking business here.

190
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,800
What do we look like the Red Cross?
You people.

191
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,800
- Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Enough!

192
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,400
Listen to me, Clyde...

193
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,200
just get the money.
You got 'til the first of the month.

194
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't make things harder
on yourself, Clyde.

195
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
Is that the way
it's going to be?

196
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Is that the way
this is going to be?

197
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
You're supposed to be my friend!
We go way back!

198
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,300
And you were supposed to be
my friend!

199
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,900
You already did that, baby.

200
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,900
No, this is something else.

201
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,800
I don't want to get wrinkles.

202
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,300
Wrinkles?

203
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I don't see any wrinkles.

204
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,400
I just see a beautiful...

205
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,800
sexy woman.

206
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Come here.

207
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Tom?

208
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,500
It's just the book.

210
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,400
I can't think of anything else.

211
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,300
- Okay.
- I'm consumed by it.

212
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,000
It's okay.

214
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Dr. Carver?
Dr. Carver?

215
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,800
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

216
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,400
Sure, Jill.

217
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,700
Goodnight.

218
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,500
I can't fail your class,
Dr. Carver.

219
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,900
Will you promise me
that I won't fail?

220
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
Jill, I can't pass you
if you don't do the work.

221
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
You're not doing anything.

222
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Look...

223
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,700
my parents will kill me if I fail.

224
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
Isn't there anything I can do?

225
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Do the work.

226
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,800
That's all you could do.
Do your best and you'll be fine.

227
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,300
But you have to do something.

228
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Isn't there anything else
I can do?

229
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,400
Jill...

230
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,200
just do the work.

231
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,200
That a boy.
There you go.

232
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,000
Double jabs.
Double jabs. Double jabs.

233
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Nice.

234
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Who wants my man?
He's ready.

235
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Hey, babe, Brunner's here.

236
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,900
Murph, you better be careful.
You're going to hurt yourself.

237
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,400
He doesn't care. He's in love.

238
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
Congratulations.

239
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
You guys hear?
Wing Loh is dead.

240
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,300
Shit.

241
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,900
We didn't do it.

242
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,800
I know you didn't do it, Murph.

243
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
I'm just wondering.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,500
A nothing bookie, dead.

245
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,500
How does that happen?

246
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
Maybe somebody owed him a lot of
money and wanted to clean the slate.

247
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,400
Yeah, maybe.

248
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,600
Any other ideas?

249
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,400
What about Ivan?

250
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,600
Is Ivan worried about a fellow
like Wing Loh? I don't think so.

251
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,600
Ivan's sitting someplace
nice and warm right now...

252
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,000
- counting his gold. Trust me.
- King fucking Ivan.

253
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,000
You should pay his boy, Victor,
a visit.

254
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
I might just do that.

255
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
Be in touch you hear anything,
okay?

256
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,400
And...

257
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,200
you guys watch yourselves,
okay?

258
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
You especially, Murph.
Being in love and all.

259
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,500
Try one, Sticks?

260
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Pass.

261
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,200
Wing Loh is dead.

262
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,700
You hear anything, Victor?

263
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,100
When I stand outside alone at night
I hear voices.

264
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,700
But I think that's just the boys
in the harbor.

265
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,400
Are you accusing Ivan of involvement
in the death of Wing Loh?

266
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Ivan's smart enough
not to bother.

267
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Why you here then?

268
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,600
Just a hunch.

269
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,700
There's something for you
on the coffee table.

270
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,800
No, thanks.

271
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Well, I want you to know
that's always there for you, my friend.

272
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,800
Give it to charity.

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,100
Why don't you give it to charity?

274
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,700
Why don't you give it to one
of those heartwarming organizations...

275
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,000
that support...

276
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,600
war heroes such as yourself?

277
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,800
I'm no hero.

278
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
This was...

279
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,200
friendly fire.

280
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,800
I think you killed Wing Loh.

281
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,100
You're a lousy detective, Sticks.

282
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Ivan would never bother
with a nothing like Wing Loh.

283
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,300
Ivan wouldn't.

284
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,200
But...

285
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,700
you're not Ivan.

286
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,200
It's game time, Murph.
Let's make some money.

287
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
Murph.

288
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
You got it.

289
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,900
Barry G.,
one hundred on Utah...

290
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,600
minus three and a half.

291
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,400
One-ten wins one, Bar.
Later.

292
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Murph.

293
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Hey, Jimmy!

294
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,800
How the hell are you, man?

295
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,900
- No shit!
- Enough with the chit chat.

296
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,100
- What color?
- Murph, please, please...

297
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,100
who cares what color?

298
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,300
- Come on, get his money.
- What do ya got?

299
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,900
Three hundred on the Red Wings...

300
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,700
minus two goals.

301
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,400
That's three to win in three.
No juice, split line.

302
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,400
Later.

303
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,000
- Hey, Aug.
- What?

304
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,500
You know what she said to me
this morning?

305
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,200
Murph, come on. Not now.

306
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,300
She said I am the best
she's ever had.

307
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
What is she supposed to say?
You're still in the room.

308
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
The best.

309
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,500
The best, Aug.

310
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,500
You're the best.

311
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,000
Fuck me, please.
Do me the favor...

312
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,500
- after we're done making all this money.
- You're just jealous.

313
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,600
Murph.

314
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,600
What's the matter?

315
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
It's Victor.

316
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,900
He wants you.

317
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,500
Give me the twenty. Give me
the twenty, twenty dollars. Okay.

318
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,400
Here we go. Right?
Here's the magic marker.

319
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,300
Here's your twenty. I'm going to make
a nice, big "X" on that twenty.

320
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,400
Okay? I am starving.

321
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,300
Thank you, sir.

322
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,600
I have very expensive tastes.

323
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,700
Here we go.
Like that and...

324
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
thank you.

325
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,300
Hey, buddy.
I want that twenty back.

326
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,400
That was a loan?

327
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,400
Not funny.

328
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,200
You want it back?

329
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,700
M'am, could you please give the kind,
generous gentleman...

330
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,600
- his money back?
- Me?

331
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,800
In your purse.

332
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,200
Right there in your wallet.
That's it. Yeah.

333
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,900
There you go. There you go, sir.

334
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,400
Here's a five for you, sir.

335
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,500
Remember,
I have very expensive tastes.

336
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,900
All right, here's a ten.
Now get the heck out of here.

337
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,700
Thank you.
You're a good sport.

338
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,400
Thank you.
Appreciate it. All right.

339
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
There you go.

340
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,100
Thanks.

341
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,400
Detective...

342
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,900
what brings you to this glorious
part of the world?

343
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,200
Certainly not the cuisine.

344
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,400
Walter.

345
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,700
Well, I'm absolutely fantastic.
Thanks for asking.

346
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,800
I couldn't ask for anything more
out of this life.

347
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
You ever hear of a guy
named Wing Loh?

348
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,600
Never.

349
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
But I love Chinese food.

350
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,300
You hear any mention
of that name...

351
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,800
Wing Loh...

352
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,800
I want you to listen
real closely, okay?

353
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,000
For you, anything, detective.

354
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
Whoa, cowboy.

355
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
It's the best thing here...

356
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,600
the ice cream.

357
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,200
You got a little...

358
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,100
little schmutz right there.

359
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Just a teeny...

360
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,600
- Did I get it?
- No, not yet.

361
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,500
It's...

362
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,700
up... to the...

363
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,300
- Now?
- Just missed. It's like...

364
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
do you mind if I...
Allow me to...

365
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Oh, there's a lot of it.

366
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,000
Feel better?

367
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That was cute.

368
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
That was really cute.

369
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,600
- My name's Walter.
- I'm married, Walter.

370
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,000
- What's the point?
- No point.

371
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,800
Oh, what do you think?
That I want to make love to you?

372
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,800
- You're not my type.
- Ditto.

373
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,000
I was just in the mood
for a little conversation.

374
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,200
I thought you might be in the mood
for a little entertainment.

375
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,300
But if you don't want it, I'm gone.
I'm out of here.

376
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,200
Invisible man, whoo!

377
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,900
You hear about the one where the horse
goes in the bar and the bartender says...

378
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,900
What's with the long face.

379
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,000
That's old.

380
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,400
And I'd really appreciate it
if you just leave me alone.

381
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,700
Two cannibals eating a clown.

382
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,600
One cannibal says
to the other one...

383
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,600
This taste funny to you?

384
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,700
I saw you at the slots.
You don't want to play the slots.

385
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,700
- No, I do. I have fun.
- Fun how?

386
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,000
It's just fun for me. I like it.

387
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,000
You got to get the human element
involved to win.

388
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,400
See, the more human element...

389
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,300
the more chance you got to win.

390
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,300
These are for you.

391
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,600
Looks like you need
a breath mint.

392
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,100
That's hilarious.

393
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,300
- Where you going?
- None of your business.

394
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,300
Hey, my name is Walter Markowitz.
I'm a magician.

395
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,000
Bye, Walter.

396
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,800
I can't eat while
you're looking at me like that.

397
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,500
I can't help it. I need to.

398
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,300
No, no, no. No. No. No.
Not again, please. I can't.

399
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,900
"Amigos", something nice and romantic
this time. "Cielito Lindo"?

400
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,200
Hey, Victor.
How are you doing, buddy?

401
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,800
You never give up, do you?

402
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,000
I want to talk to Ivan.

403
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,700
He owes me.

404
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,300
Come on, Victor.
Throw me a bone.

405
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,900
Just a little something to tie me over.
Times are tough.

406
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,900
I did his kid's birthday party
three years in a row.

407
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,100
Who was working with Ivan
when he was nothing?

408
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,300
I know all the guys on the take.

409
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,900
All those cops...
I give him that information.

410
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,900
I can help you guys.

411
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Is that so?

412
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,300
I know there are people
trying to take Ivan down...

413
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,600
coming after Ivan.

414
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,400
Now that's important information,
Walter.

415
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Take a seat.

416
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,700
No, no...

417
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,100
No, really. No, I won't bite.

418
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,400
Sit down.

419
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,300
This steak...

420
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,700
it's a wonderful piece of meat.
It's...

421
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,100
like eating butter.

422
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,000
See the marbling?

423
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
It's probably aged for six weeks.

424
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,600
And these fries.

425
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,000
They're perfect.
They're thin and...

426
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,700
they're crispy.

427
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,800
You know, I think I'm going to have
them put it in a doggy bag.

428
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,600
It's your lucky day, Walter.

429
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,300
They're all yours.

430
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,300
Fuck you, Victor.

431
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,400
It's...

432
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
a wonderful steak, Walter. It's just
the way it should be cooked.

433
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,400
It's medium rare.

434
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,400
Fuck you, Victor.

435
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,100
Hey, Walter.
Will you show me a magic trick?

436
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Let me see a bunny wabbit.

437
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,400
Can you... can you make
a bunny wabbit appear?

438
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,400
Where's my wabbit?

439
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
Go to hell.

440
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,600
Wait a minute.

441
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,300
It is you.

442
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,200
Claudia.

443
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,600
Veronica Cruz. Oh, my God,
it's been a long time, girl.

444
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,200
Only twelve years.

445
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,500
- Oh, my God, you look exactly the same.
- And I have two kids.

446
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,200
So, tell me about you.
What's going on with you?

447
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,000
Still stuck on zero.

448
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,600
I just haven't found
the right guy yet.

449
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Who's the guy
you're having dinner with?

450
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,500
He may be the right guy.

451
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,400
We're going on six months.

452
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,300
Got my fingers crossed.

453
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,000
I hate to tell you this but...

454
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,900
the guy's an asshole, Veronica.

455
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,500
He broke my husband's jaw
last year.

456
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,500
I'm sorry, I...

457
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,600
I'll see you around, okay?

458
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,600
Shit.

459
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,100
Baby,
he owed us a lot of money.

460
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,500
- It's sick.
- It had to be done.

461
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,500
That is bullshit.

462
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,700
Normal people don't beat people up
because they owe them money!

463
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,900
- They do. Where I'm from, yes they do.
- No they don't!

464
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Yes, they do.

465
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,700
Listen, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

466
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,900
Listen.

467
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
I love you, Cruz.

468
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,400
I want to be with you forever.

469
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,200
Don't touch me!

470
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,900
Fuck!

471
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,900
Wait! Veronica, wait!

472
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,500
Wait!

473
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,800
- Carolyn.
- Jesus...

474
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,300
- you scared me.
- Carol, it's one o'clock in the morning.

475
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,800
Where were you?

476
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,000
The coffee shop.

477
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
- Coffee shops are open this late?
- No.

478
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,200
After it closed...

479
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,400
I wrote in the car.

480
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,800
- What?
- I don't know...

481
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
it's amazing.

482
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,200
I write really well in the car.

483
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,700
I was worried about you.
All you had to do was call me.

484
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,300
I'm sorry. I'm...

485
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to wake you.

486
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,900
- I promise next time.
- Just call.

487
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Okay.

488
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,500
Okay.

489
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,700
Hey, you.

490
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,100
Writing in the car.

491
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
Goodnight.

492
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,800
I promise.

493
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,800
Yeah? Let me hear it.

494
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,900
We got to add tennis courts.

495
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Hey, we got to add a putting green
at the crib.

496
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,000
All that. Heliports.

497
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,000
- Swimming pool.
- What's up with the pool?

498
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,500
Olympic size one.
I'm going to put some fish in it.

499
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,000
- Can you put fish in a pool?
- Yeah, you could put fish in the pool.

500
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,900
How about a Jacuzzi?

501
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,600
I mean 'cause I'm not going to visit you
if you don't got a Jacuzzi.

502
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,400
That's what I do.
I'm a Jacuzzi swimmer.

503
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,100
What do you mean "visit"?
You going to be there all the time.

504
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,500
They going to put a Jacuzzi
in your room for you.

505
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,600
- We got to have our own chef.
- Now you're talking my language.

506
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,900
- A white guy, right?
- Hell, yeah.

507
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,300
- What? French?
- French? I don't know 'cause...

508
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,500
I don't know if French people
can make collard greens.

509
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,300
Come on. One more.

510
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,900
One more. Come on.

511
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,200
All right,
let's get out of here, man.

512
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,500
Western College...

513
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
- Thursday night. You feel it?
- Oh, yeah.

514
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,000
'Cause the line's
got you guys up by eight.

515
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
You boys getting
some respect now.

516
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,100
About damn time.

517
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,500
What if you win by less
than eight?

518
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,500
A win's a win, right?

519
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,900
Yeah, yeah.
That's what I'm saying.

520
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,100
What I'm saying Godfrey is...

521
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,500
what if you win by less
than eight?

522
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,100
A win's a win, right?

523
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,800
Clyde, man, don't tell me you got
money riding on the game.

524
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,700
You always accusing me of stuff.

525
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,400
Come on, man.

526
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Don't worry about me.
You need to focus on the game.

527
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,200
- You need to concentrate.
- Clyde.

528
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I believe in you, G.
Who else am I gonna bet on?

529
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,200
I got to bet on you.

530
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
You said you was done.

531
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,600
I thought you was supposed
to be clean.

532
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,300
I'm trying to get there.
That's what this is all about.

533
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm not doing it.

534
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,800
You see this?

535
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,700
Do you see this?

536
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,400
I didn't get this from hitting
my head on some fucking pipe.

537
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,100
These guys,
they want their money.

538
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
And I'm in the hole.

539
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,100
I'm going to get hurt really bad
if I can't figure my way out of this.

540
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,700
Come on, Godfrey.
Come on.

541
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Look, we'll borrow the money.

542
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
Who the fuck going to lend us
the money?

543
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,500
I don't know. Coach.

544
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm down twelve thousand,
all right?

545
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,400
Twelve thousand dollars?

546
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,300
- How you down twelve thousand dollars?
- I don't know. I don't know, man.

547
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,200
I just got out of control.
I just got out of control, you know?

548
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
You said you was done.

549
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,100
I'm trying, all right? I'm trying.

550
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,100
You swore to me. I guess your word
don't mean shit, then. Huh?

551
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,900
You know what? Fuck it, Godfrey!
Fuck it! All right? Fuck it!

552
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,900
I'm not perfect! Look at me.
I'm not perfect!

553
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,900
Who is? Who's perfect?
You perfect?

554
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,800
You make every shot
you ever take?

555
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Did you make that shot
against Loyola the other day?

556
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
No.

557
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,300
You didn't hit that shot.
You fucked up.

558
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,700
You lost the game.
You...

559
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,400
You're not perfect.
I'm not perfect either.

560
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,200
Got me all messed up, man.
This is all messed up. I'm sorry.

561
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,400
That's not right.
I shouldn't have said that.

562
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right?

563
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm sorry. I'm just...

564
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,500
I'm just trying to get straight.

565
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,200
I'm just trying not to get hurt.
That's it.

566
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
What you need me to do?

567
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,500
Forget it, all right?

568
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,200
Come on. Come on. Forget it.

569
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,700
No, no, no, let's go.
Let's go home.

570
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,900
Let's get out of here.

571
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,500
Clyde, man,
what you need me to do?

572
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,600
I just need you to win
by less than eight.

573
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,900
Move your feet. Move your feet.
Come on. Come on.

574
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
All right. It's all right.

575
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,400
It's all right.
Let's go. Let's go.

576
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
It's all right.

577
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
Oh, God damn it.

578
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,100
- What's the matter?
- I got this indigestion...

579
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,100
this acid reflux. It burns.

580
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,100
- It hurts like a son of a bitch.
- That's stress.

581
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,800
Yeah, I know. That's what all
the genius doctors keep telling me.

582
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,300
You know...

583
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,300
Augustine...

584
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,900
the reason I invited you here tonight
is because I think you're an astute guy.

585
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,900
And I like the way
you do business.

586
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,900
- I'm just trying to make a living.
- Well, I think we should work together.

587
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,600
<i>Pull our resources, so to speak.</i>

588
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
<i>Wow, that's quite an offer Victor.</i>

589
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,200
But, you know, Murph and I, you know,
we got a good thing going now.

590
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,700
Murph's a liability.

591
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,000
You work with me,
you'll retire before you're forty.

592
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,700
Did you offer anybody else
this deal?

593
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,300
What do you mean?

594
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,100
Wing Loh.

595
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,400
Now,
why would you ask me that?

596
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,900
If we're working together, I should know
about the operation. Don't you think?

597
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,100
Wing Loh was offering
better lines.

598
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,200
He was stealing from both of us.

599
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
I heard something about that.
But it didn't really bother me.

600
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,700
I figured there was enough action
for all of us. Didn't you?

601
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,900
What do you think of my offer?

602
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,300
I think Murph and I...

603
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,300
pretty happy as we are.

604
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,900
Well, I think
you should think about it.

605
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,600
I think you should think...

606
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
about where you want to be
in five years.

607
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,300
Have a good night, Augustine.

608
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,100
You too, Victor.
Thanks for the game.

609
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,200
How's my boy, Ivan, doing?

610
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Would you like me to say
"hello" for you?

611
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,500
Actually I don't know him.

612
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,000
I never met him.

613
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I didn't think you did.

614
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,800
You know what? I have a theory
about Ivan, Victor. Just hear me out.

615
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,600
There is no Ivan.

616
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,500
It's like the Wizard of Oz.
You're Ivan.

617
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,900
Good night, Augustine.

618
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,900
- Come on, come on!
- Yeah!

619
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,800
Walter the magician.

620
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,100
- They're pretty loud, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

621
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,500
Cute again.

622
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,700
- That's for you.
- Thank you.

623
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,900
- And you are?
- Carolyn.

624
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,000
Carolyn.

625
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,600
Do you play, Carolyn?

626
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,400
- No.
- Come on, sit down.

627
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,700
This is my game.
I'll teach you.

628
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,700
Blackjack!

629
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,500
- What are you gonna do?
- Yeah. More.

630
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,700
- You want more? Let it ride?
- Let it ride.

631
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,300
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on!

632
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,600
Blackjack!

633
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,700
It's her first time playing.

634
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,500
It's her first time!

635
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,900
All right. What? What? What?

636
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,100
- Again.
- Enough? Again?

637
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,600
- Again.
- Again?

638
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,300
Going again.

639
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,400
Okay. Okay.

640
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,200
Remember what I told you
about the odds.

641
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,300
Let the dealer bust.

642
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
- Let the dealer bust.
- I feel lucky.

643
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,900
- I feel lucky.
- You got to play the odds.

644
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
- One more.
- You want a hit?

645
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,100
One more.

646
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,700
- She wants a hit.
- Hit it.

647
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,800
Oh! Oh! Medic!

648
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,300
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Nicole. Is your mom there?</i>

649
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,900
<i>She's not here.</i>

650
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,400
All right. Well, I'll see you
in a little while, okay? Bye.

651
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,700
Yes! Yes! Yes!

652
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,800
<i>Hello?</i>

653
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,600
Hey, baby. Where are you?

654
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,500
Hi, honey. The coffee shop.

655
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,900
<i>- Are you going to be home soon?
- Yeah, soon.</i>

656
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,200
Well, I miss you.

657
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,300
I miss you too. Bye.

658
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,700
- You're very good under pressure.
- Hey, lady luck, are you in or you out?

659
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,600
- Are you gonna play this game or what?
- No, I'm in. I'm, I'm in.

660
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,400
That was so fantastic.

661
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,700
Thank you so very much.

662
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,800
Come on.

663
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,900
Did I give you enough?

664
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,800
Oh, yeah. I'm a simple guy.
You sure you want to quit?

665
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,400
Because, you know,
when you're on a roll like that...

666
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,100
No, I really have to go home.

667
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Home is where the heart is.

668
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,800
Okay, well, I'll be here,
Carolyn Carver, okay?

669
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,500
I'm here!

670
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,800
Hey, you.

671
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,900
Are you my lover?

672
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,900
Are you my angel man?

673
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,200
- Did you finish?
- Almost.

674
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm just happy.
Can't I be happy?

675
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,100
Carolyn.

676
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,800
I decided on the way home from the game
to get a Starbucks.

677
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,900
You weren't at the Starbucks.

678
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,800
I don't always go to Starbucks.

679
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,800
Portfolio on Main?

680
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,500
Did you try there?

681
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,700
No.

682
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,500
I'm sorry.

683
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,200
I cannot work
at the same place everyday.

684
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,900
It would drive me crazy.

685
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,400
- Where did you think I was?
- I don't know.

686
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,000
It's just that we don't get to see
much of you around here these days.

687
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,500
I'm almost finished.

688
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,500
I really am.

689
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,600
We just miss you, baby.
That's all.

690
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,900
How about the other guy?

691
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,300
Does he miss me too?

692
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,600
Yeah? Does he?

693
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,400
- I don't know. Let me ask him.
- Oh, no, no.

694
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,800
Let me ask him.

695
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,700
How are you doing?

696
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
All right.

697
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,800
Let's finish strong. Finish strong.
Come on, finish strong.

698
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,700
Push it out. Push it out.
Yeah.

699
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,700
All right. All right.

700
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,800
Good work, men.

701
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,400
Good work. All right,
you all go and hit the showers.

702
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,600
- Get back to your dorms. Hit the books.
- Yeah, all right.

703
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,400
Fill your brains with knowledge...

704
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,100
and you will succeed
on this planet.

705
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,400
There he is!

706
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,900
Godfrey Snow!

707
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Madison Square Garden...

708
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,100
one free throw
from the World Championship.

709
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,000
And the crowd screams.

710
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,200
And he shoots!

711
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,200
And it's in!

712
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
He hits it!

713
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,500
Godfrey Snow!

714
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,900
- The man!
- You know, I be doing my thing.

715
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,500
- The man!
- Doing my thing.

716
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,300
I'm going to need a little more help
from you, all right?

717
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,300
Just a little bit, okay?

718
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
How much more?

719
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,100
I don't know, you know.
I can't...

720
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,300
get it all back at one time,
right?

721
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,800
I mean,
they be all over me for that, right?

722
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,200
You know that, right?
Come on.

723
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,400
Hit me.

724
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,900
Hit.

725
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
I'm out.

726
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,100
Hit.

727
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,700
Hit me.

728
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,800
Fuck it.

729
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,500
Oh, God.

730
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,300
Mrs. Snyder,
doctor will be right with you.

731
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,000
Cruz, hey, I got you something.

732
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,000
I don't want it.

733
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,400
Hey, hey, how come you
didn't call me back last night?

734
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
- Excuse me.
- Let's not do this here, okay?

735
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,900
But how come
you didn't call me?

736
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,000
How come?

737
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,800
I want to slow things down.

738
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,800
Why?

739
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,700
Because...

740
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,800
because, Murph,
I need some time alone.

741
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,200
Look, what I got you.
Look.

742
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,700
This is going to look beautiful
on you. Look.

743
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,300
I can't.

744
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,200
- I don't want it.
- You love me, Veronica.

745
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,000
- You said so yourself.
- You're a bookie.

746
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,400
- You hurt people.
- I love you.

747
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,900
I don't want to be with a bookie
for the rest of my life you know.

748
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,600
- I want more.
- Oh, all right, I'll quit.

749
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,100
- You tell me to quit and I'll quit.
- Okay, then quit.

750
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,400
- Exactly.
- Wait, wait, wait.

751
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,900
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

752
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,000
I don't love you.

753
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,200
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

754
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,200
Cover up, Murph.
Come on, Murph.

755
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,400
Stop dancing. Get out of there.
There you go.

756
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,100
Come on, bitch.
Let's go.

757
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,700
Let's go.

758
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,600
- Nice.
- Come on, huh? You want me, huh?

759
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,000
All right, easy. Let's be nice.

760
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,000
Murph, Murph, Murph,
Murph, Murph!

761
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,900
- Calm down, man.
- Break it off.

762
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,300
<i>Over to Henson...</i>

763
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,700
<i>he goes behind his back...</i>

764
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,500
<i>Ray opens on the course...</i>

765
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,100
It hurts like hell, Murph.
I've been there.

766
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,500
You'll be all right.
You'll get through it, man.

767
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,600
Pretty soon, you won't
even remember her name.

768
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,000
- I'll always remember.
- You'll see.

769
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,900
I want out.

770
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,700
I'm done with booking, Aug.

771
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,700
No, you don't.
And no, you're not.

772
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,100
I made a decision.
I don't want to do it anymore.

773
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,700
- That's Veronica Cruz talking.
- Fuck you.

774
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,900
- Fuck me?
- Yeah.

775
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,300
Fuck you, man.

776
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,400
You know what? This has gone on
long enough. This is crazy.

777
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
What are you going to do, Murph?
Join a band? Med school?

778
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,800
- I love her.
- She doesn't love you back.

779
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,500
- What? You got to say that?
- Yeah, I do have to say it, man.

780
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,700
This is getting crazy now.
I'm tired of it.

781
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,100
You're my best friend.
You're my business partner.

782
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,300
Look, man...

783
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,600
we got a really good thing
going here.

784
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,100
We're on the rise, man.
We're on the rise.

785
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,700
And it is only going to get better
and better and better. I promise.

786
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,200
It doesn't feel right anymore.

787
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,500
You love booking, Murph.
Tell me you don't.

788
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,600
It's not good what we do,
Aug.

789
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
I'm talking to
Veronica Cruz's puppet.

790
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,000
It's not good what we do, Aug.
How could you say that, man?

791
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,800
Look at what these other guys do.
These bigwig, these hotshot...

792
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,300
businessmen and politicians.

793
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,300
They screw people
over for billions of dollars.

794
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,400
And then they go run behind
their million dollar lawyers.

795
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,000
And you got the balls to tell me
that what we do...

796
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
that what we're doing is wrong?

797
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,300
Come on, Murph.

798
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,300
You...

799
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,900
fuck.

800
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,900
- You all right?
- Yeah, just...

801
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,600
Let me tell you something...

802
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,700
Motherfucker.

803
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,800
What we do is good.
Okay?

804
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,400
Following me?
It's good.

805
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,300
We provide a service.
People like to bet.

806
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,900
We let them bet.

807
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,000
It's good.

808
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,300
It's good.

809
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,500
It's good.

810
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,300
It's good.
It's good.

811
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,300
I'll tell you something else. Okay?
Ready for this?

812
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,100
Ivan's going down.

813
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,400
Ivan's never going down,
you told me.

814
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,400
No. Ivan told Victor
to kill Wing Loh.

815
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,400
That's conspiracy to commit murder.
Bye, bye, Ivan.

816
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,500
Wait, wait, wait.

817
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,500
- How do you know Ivan did it?
- 'Cause I know.

818
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,100
That's how I know because I know.
All right?

819
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,200
Now you envision a world
with me and you booking.

820
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,500
No Ivan. No Victor.

821
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,500
Wing Loh's already out.

822
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,100
Forget about it. Out of the park.
Nothing can stop us.

823
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,000
Undisputed heavyweight champions
of the world.

824
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,100
Put your hand up.
Put your hands up.

825
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,300
All right?

826
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,600
- Let me get in that robe, big boy.
- Get the fuck away from me.

827
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,000
- You're in a good mood, when I act gay?
- Yeah.

828
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,400
Here it is!

829
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,500
- That's great.
- That's great.

830
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,400
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Wonderful.

831
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,800
Thank... Oh, that's so generous.

832
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,600
Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

833
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,600
Thank you so much.
Have a good night.

834
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,400
Walter.

835
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,500
- Walter.
- Oh, Carolyn.

836
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,400
My lucky lady.
Are you hungry? I'm buying.

837
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,100
Walter.

838
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,900
I'm listening.

839
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,600
I lost everything we won
last night.

840
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,300
- I don't believe it.
- No, I did... I...

841
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,100
I should have stayed like you said,
when I was on a roll.

842
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,800
- You're only a beginner once.
- Over the last six months...

843
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,900
I lost my family savings.

844
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,300
- All of it?
- Almost.

845
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,700
- Don't worry. You'll get it back.
- No, I don't...

846
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,700
You'll get it back
if you believe you'll get it back.

847
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,700
It's so much money, Walter.

848
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You want to make some
of that money back today?

849
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,500
No. No, Walter,
I don't feel lucky today.

850
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,300
You don't have to be lucky
for this.

851
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,700
This is guaranteed.

852
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
You like to step into my office?

853
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,200
I know it's not much,
but I call it home.

854
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,600
We're going to play a little game
of hanky poo.

855
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,300
One for me
and two for you.

856
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,400
Here's the game.
Watch the lady.

857
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,100
Find the Queen.

858
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,400
Okay, two black cards.
One red.

859
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Okay? There she is.

860
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,800
Simple as that.
Easy game.

861
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,100
In? Who's in?

862
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,800
Anybody? No?

863
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,700
I'll tell you what, two for one.

864
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,800
Two for one?
What do you mean?

865
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,000
Madam, that means if you bet twenty,
you tell me where the Queen is...

866
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,600
I give you forty.
You bet forty, you get eighty.

867
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,600
Eighty, you get one-sixty.
And so on, and so forth.

868
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,500
You in or out?

869
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,000
Yes or no.
Anybody?

870
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,200
Play or go. I see green.

871
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,400
- Okay. The end.
- Here?

872
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,300
Put it down.

873
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,500
Okay, is that your choice?

874
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,700
That's it.

875
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,300
Any other takers?

876
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,500
No?

877
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,600
Congratulations, Madam.

878
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,500
I think I owe you forty dollars.

879
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,700
There you are.

880
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,400
- I think I've had enough. I think I...
- No, no, no.

881
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,600
No, I...
No, I know when to quit.

882
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,800
Come on.

883
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,700
All right.
Okay, one more time.

884
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,300
Here we go.
Keep your eye on the lady.

885
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,200
There she is.

886
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,300
Just keep your eyes on her.
All right?

887
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,600
Okay.
All right, make your bet.

888
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,400
Okay? Here?
All right? Fine.

889
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,200
All right. Everybody. Okay.

890
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,200
Do you miss mom?

891
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,700
She's your wife, you know.

892
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,400
Yeah, of course I miss her.

893
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,300
Your mother's an artist.
You know artists are inspired.

894
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,200
They must force
the rest of the world out of their lives.

895
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,800
The way I see it...

896
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,800
if Mom were so inspired
she'd be able to write at home.

897
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,000
There's too many distractions here.

898
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,600
Like us?

899
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,100
Yeah, like us.

900
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,700
I wouldn't want
to take it anywhere.

901
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,500
I wouldn't want to take it on the road
or anything like that.

902
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,900
It's kind of stable.
It stays in one spot.

903
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,300
It is a mobile home
but it doesn't move.

904
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,700
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

905
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,500
Home sweet home.

906
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,900
You...

907
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,100
were a natural.

908
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,500
You were great.

909
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,600
You were really something
out there, Carolyn. I mean it.

910
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,100
This is yours.

911
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,600
- No, no, no. No, I can't.
- You earned it.

912
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
- No, no, no, keep it, really.
- We were partners out there.

913
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,900
And I couldn't have done it
without you.

914
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,900
Come on, we were a team.

915
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,300
- Okay, thanks.
- The maid comes on Tuesday.

916
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,300
Oh, my gosh.
Walter, is that you?

917
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,900
The Amazing Abraham?

918
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,700
That's me in the Catskills
back in the day.

919
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,600
I did two shows a night,
seven nights a week.

920
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,400
I packed them in
with five hundred people in a show.

921
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,600
I came this close
to being a big star.

922
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,800
- What happened?
- Magic changed.

923
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,900
I'm a slight of hand guy.

924
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,800
Everybody wanted bigger.

925
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,700
They wanted elephants disappearing.

926
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,700
- I don't make elephants disappear.
- That's good!

927
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,700
Thank you.

928
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,000
- That's really good.
- Yeah, I don't think that's magic but...

929
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,200
the Amazing Abraham's day
will come again.

930
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,100
The amazing Abraham's time
will come.

931
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,400
It's hardware store,
you know.

932
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,300
That thing gave me a rash
last time.

933
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,600
Stay cool.
You start getting nervy...

934
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,100
just think of a beach in Hawaii
and a pretty brown woman.

935
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,500
I can do that.

936
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,500
You do this right Augie,
you're off the hook.

937
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,500
Why the sudden change of heart?

938
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,600
Well, I thought it over, Victor.

939
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Retire in a few years,
that sounds awfully good, man.

940
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,700
<i>Besides, Murph wants out,
so I'm going to play ball with you.</i>

941
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,400
<i>Well, that's wonderful news,
Augie.</i>

942
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,400
<i>I knew you'd come around.
You're a very smart man.</i>

943
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,600
<i>Victor, I need to know
what you have in mind.</i>

944
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,000
<i>I need details...</i>

945
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,800
<i>about what
I'm getting myself into here.</i>

946
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,300
Of course.

947
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,200
Let's talk in the steam room.

948
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,200
It'll do wonders for your health.

949
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,800
Okay, guys.
This thing's about to get a bath.

950
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,300
You and I, we work together.
We carve out a business.

951
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,300
Ivan's not involved.

952
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,300
He'll kill us.

953
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,600
He never needs to know.

954
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,300
A year together, the two of us...

955
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
you'll be a millionaire.

956
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,700
That's an attractive offer.

957
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,500
Did you whack Wing Loh?

958
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,600
<i>I'd understand if you did.</i>

959
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,800
<i>I mean, me and Murph
we couldn't stand the guy.</i>

960
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,400
You did, right?

961
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,300
Somebody had to do it.

962
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,500
Got you, motherfucker.

963
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,600
<i>- Okay, I'm ready. Say something.
- What?</i>

964
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,600
Introduce me.

965
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,200
Introduce you.

966
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,100
What do you want me to say?

967
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,000
You're the writer.

968
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,500
Ladies and gentlemen...

969
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,600
let's give a warm welcome
to this next performer.

970
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,000
The one...

971
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,300
the only...

972
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,800
the mystical, the magical...

973
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,000
The Amazing...

974
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,600
Abraham!

975
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,800
Carolyn...

976
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,300
my captive audience.

977
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,700
Ready for a shower of cards?

978
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,500
Hearts for you.

979
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,300
A heart, yes.
There you are, my dear.

980
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I love it!

981
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,600
Pan of fire.

982
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:55,384
Better than Tinder on
