1
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
When do you stop
looking at each other?

2
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,799
Shouldn't there be a warning?

3
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,200
Shouldn't somebody say to us,

4
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,200
"Hey, watch out, pay attention"?

5
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,200
Because you can be thinking,

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,399
"I'm okay, we're okay,
we're good."

7
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,399
Then you turn around and...
a distance between you.

8
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,099
Zorany! Miro!

9
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,099
I've got a little job for you.

10
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,599
The Speed Merchants?

11
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,699
I'm sorry, I apologize.
Traffic.

12
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,500
Yeah, bad traffic
for three days?

13
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,500
Hi, Bea.

14
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,000
Hi, Dad.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
Very exciting.

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Okay, Bea.

17
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,099
- No, I want...
- Stop with the balloon.

18
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,199
No, stop, stop.

19
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,400
Who's that?

20
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,099
- That's one of the cleaners.
- Yeah.

21
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,099
It's the cleaner, yeah.

22
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,199
Yeah, you know her--
Erika.

23
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,199
She's staggering.

24
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,800
Staggering.
Why do you have a picture

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,417
of one of the cleaners
on your computer?

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
I was just experimenting
with my camera.

27
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,400
I was just, um, you know,

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,699
"Can I just...?
Oh, that's good."

29
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,500
Come on.

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
It's all right for you, mate,

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
you've got a gorgeous,
Swedish wife.

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Girlfriend.

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Half Swedish.

34
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,400
You cannot say girlfriend
after ten years.

35
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:26,900
You all right?

36
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,900
I mean, isn't that true?

37
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,900
You've been there,

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,599
are you gassed in Sweden
if you're ugly?

39
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,300
Or maybe just given a penis,

40
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:43,061
because some of the men
can be very ugly,

41
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,800
but I've never seen
an ugly Swedish woman.

42
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Jesus, look at Liv.

43
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,699
Oh, I love this space.

44
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,899
We do. We think it's
a steal. Thanks for coming.

45
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,300
That's us. Let's go!

46
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,600
Are we crazy?

47
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
No.

48
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,800
About what?

49
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,500
King's Cross.

50
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,399
Sandy still thinks we're
crazy to move there.

51
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,600
It's so... the area.

52
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,199
It's a great office, isn't it?

53
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,600
And it was a...

54
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,500
It's a great project,
it was a great night.

55
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
I don't know.

56
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
It's all great.

57
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,199
Thank you for making
an effort tonight.

58
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,699
The launch,
I know it's not your...

59
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,399
but it really helped.

60
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,800
It's okay. It's fine.

61
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,300
Was it an effort?

62
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,500
What? That's her.

63
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,800
That's Bea.

64
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:33,000
No, that's a fox.

65
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,600
No, it's her,
she was exhausted.

66
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,600
They're taking over London.
I hate that noise.

67
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,300
It's so late.

68
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,100
How can she just not sleep?

69
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,500
I don't think going
to her always...

70
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I don't know if that helps.

71
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,699
I know you don't.

72
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,500
Let's go back and see someone.

73
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,800
I've seen too many someones.

74
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,399
Sorry.

75
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,500
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,399
Listen, what you're doing,
the whole project, for London,

77
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,800
the office, everything--
it's wonderful.

78
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,199
I think it can genuinely
be something...

79
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
Rubbish.

80
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,500
- Terrible.
- ...genuinely rubbish-like.

81
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,600
Crap.

82
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,100
I'll come back.

83
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,600
Down, hold...

84
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,500
one, two, three.

85
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,700
Turn, one, two, three.

86
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,000
Bea, darling, it's 3:30
in the morning.

87
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
We have to stop this.

88
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,299
One, two...

89
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,600
Hello?

90
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Yeah, well, no, I mean,
I'm his partner, so...

91
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,799
Yes, I am.

92
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,200
What?!

93
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,100
Hi.

94
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,500
Officer, this place
is my business.

95
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,799
Go on, go ahead.

96
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,100
- My partner's in there already.
- Okay.

97
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,899
I had everything on that laptop,
my life is on that laptop.

98
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,100
I'm very sorry, sir.

99
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,299
Will! Will!

100
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,899
All the computers, my laptop,
the petty cash...

101
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,200
Well, how did they get in?

102
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,299
Through the roof.

103
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,000
- What about the alarm?
- They turned it off.

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,399
Well, how do they know
the code?

105
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,600
I wasn't here.
I don't know.

106
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,799
- Jesus Christ.
- Do you have cleaners?

107
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,700
It's not the cleaners.

108
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,200
This is covered in glass.

109
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:31,200
It's not the cleaners.

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,799
I know it's...
I know the cleaners.

111
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,299
How can we have a break-in
on our first day?

112
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:37,399
Unless the cleaners have turned
into a bunch of acrobats.

113
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Who is it?

114
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,200
It's Zoran and Miro.

115
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,799


116
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,299
- Hey.
- Hey.

117
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,899
How's my best nephew, hmm?

118
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,299
- Dragan.
- Huh?

119
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,799
See my hands? See his?

120
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,799
Uh-huh.

121
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,700
His dad had the big brains.

122
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,299
I had the big hands.

123
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:26,399
Your dad had hands
like a girl's.

124
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,600
And the girls loved him.

125
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,100
It's the same with you two.

126
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,600
My son is the clumsy one.

127
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
This is for you.

128
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Wipe everything.

129
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,899
You know how to do that?

130
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,000
Erase everything?

131
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,500
They'll be delivering
new computers,

132
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,399
and then you can go back in,
my little monkey.

133
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,000
Hi, Mom.

134
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,700
How was school?

135
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,500
It was okay.

136
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,799
Lots of homework?

137
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,799
No, not really.

138
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,799
Not really?

139
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,700
Mirsad,

140
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,399
you've not been
at school for weeks.

141
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,200
They sent another letter.

142
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,700
It's a mistake-- half the time

143
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,500
they don't know who's there
and who's not there.

144
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,400
Now we have
to go back to see people
at the Social Services.

145
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,399
We survived.

146
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,700
Do you understand?

147
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,399
We survived,

148
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,500
and that's not free.

149
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,399
I didn't ask to survive.

150
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,100
Imagine your father.

151
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,600
If we could offer him
just one day,

152
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,700
one hour-- imagine...

153
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,799
You have a life and you are
throwing it away.

154
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,700
I don't even remember him.

155
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,299
I don't remember him.

156
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,200
Where do you go?

157
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,799
Where do you go every day?

158
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,100
I'm working, I'm earning money.

159
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,600
You have to go to school.

160
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,408
That's what we promised,
with police and the court.

161
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,100
Otherwise, they'll
put you in prison.

162
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,799
I'll be 16 in three months.

163
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,799
Mirsad...

164
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,000
You're a clever boy.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're clever,
you've got a brain.

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,200
I have to go. I'm late.

167
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:38,200
If somebody,
if one of his family,

168
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
if any of our people are
leading you, I'm telling you,

169
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,600
if anyone of them is,
I'll kill them!

170
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,000
And I wouldn't care!

171
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,700
We've never really
had a proper diagnosis,

172
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,100
but I've always known
Bea was special.

173
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,799
Yeah!

174
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,799
She's double happy, double sad,
double excited, double awake,

175
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,399
double needy-- well, no,
triple needy, actually.

176
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,399


177
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,500
I know even...

178
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,100
even when Bea
was ten months old,

179
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,700
she, she was... already
distressed by noise.

180
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,399
Sh-She would only sleep with
a particular blanket next to her

181
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,600
or-or eat
with a particular spoon.

182
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,000
Lately it's been getting worse
and she can't sleep at all.

183
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,799
She can't manage at school,
where, uh...

184
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,899
all of us, just completely
at our wits' end.

185
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,399


186
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,799
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm late.

187
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,899
...eat foods of a certain color.

188
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,799
Sorry.

189
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,500
Sorry.

190
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,100
I'm Rosemary McCloud.

191
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,500
Hi, Rosemary.
I'm Will.

192
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,799
Where's Bea?

193
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,299
Oh, no, Bea...

194
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:45,000
No, the structure is
that before I begin
any sort of diagnosis,

195
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,299
I'd like to meet
the parents first, alone.

196
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:48,700
Right, great.

197
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,299
So I'm just, uh,
finishing with Liv.

198
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,600
Um...

199
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,899
Well, I'd like to, uh, listen
to these documentaries.

200
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I must have heard them
in the past.

201
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,899
Uh, no, they're mostly
World Service.

202
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,899
Liv explained that she's going
to semi-retire until Bea gets...

203
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,899
That's not true.

204
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,100
- Effectively.
- Will...

205
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,399
It's, it's either
Bea's gymnastics,

206
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,799
Bea's art therapy,
Bea's music therapy,

207
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,399
it's a sacrifice
is all I'm saying.

208
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,299
Liv won prizes for the work
she did, did she tell you that?

209
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,700
It's a big sacrifice
is all I'm saying, hmm.

210
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,200
I was just explaining
to Rosemary...

211
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,799
She's up all night.

212
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,600
...that, um, in these past few
months, that Bea's gotten worse.

213
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,500
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

214
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,399
And, uh, she's not sleeping,
and... it's intense.

215
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,100
Yes.

216
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,600
Hav-Have either
of you-- therapy--

217
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
have either of you considered

218
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,200
ever-ever thought
about doing that or...?

219
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
I did see someone.

220
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,799
When?

221
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,299
For a while,
'cause I can get low sometimes.

222
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,299
- I just go into low...
- Wow.

223
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:50,100
Um, my father died
and my mother died

224
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,600
- and my sister died and...
- Hmm.

225
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,899
It's family with
a short life expectancy.

226
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,399
And a grandmother of 93.

227
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,799
And a grandmother
of 93.

228
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,799
But some days the cup is empty
and some days its 93% full.

229
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,799
Were you, um, were you
brought up in Sweden or...?

230
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:16,399
Oh, my father was American,
and I went to university there.

231
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
- Uh-huh.
- Chicago.

232
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,100
Addicted to cold.

233
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,500
No.

234
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,000
Uh, are you concerned about Bea?

235
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,799
Sure, you know, but Liv is...

236
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,700
Liv worries so much, there's,
there's not much room... for...

237
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,700
You know,
but a 13-year-old girl

238
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,600
who collects batteries,

239
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,700
doesn't sleep, doesn't let us
sleep, won't eat anything,

240
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,000
spends all day wanting
to do somersaults, I mean,

241
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,500
yeah, sure, I'm concerned.

242
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,799
Of course I'm concerned.

243
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,600
Liv says that you're wrapped up
in your work.

244
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,899
Wrapped up?
Wrapped up?

245
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,700
That's fair.

246
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,399
I love how working hard,
working really hard,

247
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,500
becomes wrapped up,
becomes something selfish.

248
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,500
I love that.

249
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,200
When you say that you love it,

250
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,500
do you mean
that you don't love it?

251
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,900
Let's just back up.

252
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,500
We love Bea.

253
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
It's not a competition to see
who loves her the most.

254
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,500
If it were a competition,
I would happily let Liv win.

255
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
You win.

256
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,799
It says here your father
died, your husband,
your sister.

257
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,000
This was where? Sarajevo?

258
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,599
Um, Miro and I left
with the Red Cross.

259
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,700
My husband stayed
behind and was, uh,

260
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,700
he stayed behind
and was murdered.

261
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,400
You're Serbs?

262
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,799
My husband was Serb.
I'm Muslim.

263
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,500
Uh, it's complicated.

264
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,200
We're Bosnian,
we're all Bosnian...

265
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,700
It's complicated.

266
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,799
Do you have
relatives in Britain?

267
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,400
My husband's family.

268
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,400
His brother, sisters and aunt.

269
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,799
Was a time when
a smack around the ear

270
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,599
or my auntie would
give me a thump.

271
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,500
Matter of fact, she punctured
my eardrum at one point,

272
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,900
but you knew where you were.

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,200
Simple, we're all simple.

274
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,799
What about you, Sonny Jim?

275
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,299
What have you been up to while
you've not been at school?

276
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,200
Back thieving,
stealing again? Hmm?

277
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,700
See, things are not things.

278
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,400
Things are always
somebody's things.

279
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Car is Jack's car,
'cause he worked for it.

280
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,099
Your Prada jacket is little
Kevin's Prada jacket,

281
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:45,599
before it was his-- I can see
your little brain ticking over.

282
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,700
His Prada jacket
belonged to Mr. Prada.

283
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,299
What about before that?

284
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,799
Before what?

285
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,400
Before it was Mr. Prada's?

286
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
Did it belong to the women
who made it?

287
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
'Cause my mom does that--
makes clothes for other people,

288
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,099
slaves for other people.

289
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:07,000
Or like when prisoners
make trains.

290
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,299
Next time you're going down.

291
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,599
We'll catch you,

292
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,700
and then you can discuss
who owns the trains
with your cell mates.

293
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,400
Back in a minute.

294
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,000
Sorry I'm late again,
but everything is here.

295
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
- All the Macs. Everything
- It's okay.

296
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,299
- Excellent. Thank you.
- Thank you.

297
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,799
Excuse me.
You dropped this.

298
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,799
Oh, thanks, Erika.

299
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Oh, please, come up, Erika.
It is Erika, isn't it?

300
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,299
- Yes, sir.
- Sandy.

301
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,700
We set the alarm, sir.

302
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,299
I did it myself.

303
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,500
You have my word.

304
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,799
I'm not accusing you.

305
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,000
The police have already
called my mobile phone,

306
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,400
asking me questions.

307
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Yeah, that is normal.

308
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,900
About this thing
and then that thing.

309
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm so sorry.

310
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
It was like Kafka.

311
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,099
"Where did you get your car?"

312
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,099
"Why are you ordering takeaway?"

313
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,099
You know, we try
to do a good job.

314
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,900
You-you do, you do do
a very good job.

315
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
Erika, listen.

316
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,799
We have to have a new code
for the alarm.

317
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,700
Now, we're going to give you
your own code,

318
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,099
You're going to choose it,
not us,

319
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,200
so there's absolutely no way
of you being wrongly accused
of anything.

320
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,099
- Is that a deal?
- Okay, thanks.

321
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,299
Oh, listen.

322
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,799
I had your picture
on my computer.

323
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,500
What would the burglar
make of that?

324
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,900
My photograph?

325
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,200
Yeah. Well, from when I was,
um, trying my camera out,

326
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,599
if you remember.

327
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:41,299
So, the burglar, someone
who didn't know the context,

328
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,599
would think you were
a friend or a girlfriend.

329
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,700
I mean, someone standing over
there who couldn't hear us,

330
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,900
what would he make of this?

331
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,299
Well, apart from my uniform.

332
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:51,799
Of course apart
from the uniform, yeah.

333
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,299
But say, if we were too far away
to see the uniform.

334
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Y-You know? And I could give you
this book, and you know,

335
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,900
for all matey-boy over there
knows, that's a collected works

336
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,099
of Franz Kafka,
that's your birthday...

337
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,900
- Or the Bible.
- Or the Bible.

338
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,299
Uh...

339
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,599
The model hasn't changed.

340
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,599
Of course I know.

341
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,700
Because we'd have to plant...

342
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,799
Why isn't she moving?

343
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,799
You can't take a fish
out of the water.

344
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,000
I have 50 e-mails.

345
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,400
- Why isn't she moving?
- She's dead.

346
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,299
You can't take
a fish out of the water.

347
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,900
- Okay, put her down.
- Darling, listen to Mommy.

348
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
No, no, you can't take
a fish out of the water.

349
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,500
No, no, don't
put her back in.

350
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,099
You can't take
a fish out of water!

351
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,299
She needs water.

352
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,299
Sandy, no, I can't
get to the office.

353
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:54,200
If you can get
to the office for me.

354
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,599
Well, I can't because
I'm needed here.

355
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,200
You're right, you
can't take a fish out.

356
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,900
You can't, but she's dead.
See? She's dead.

357
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,000
You can go? Okay,
that's great. Thank you.

358
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
- It's okay. We'll bury her.
- I'll speak later.

359
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,799
Okay, this is what
we're going to do.

360
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,700
We're going to put her
in a little box.

361
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,799
Oh, don't cry, darling.

362
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,200
Don't cry.

363
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,299
Come on, we're going
to put her in a box...

364
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:27,799
New code.
Two, one...
seven, eight.

365
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,700
It's my date of birth.

366
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,500
Now what are you doing?

367
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's go! Leave it.

368
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
Come on, let's go!

369
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Come on!

370
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:24,000
Get the door!

371
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,099
Oh!

372
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,500
Jesus Christ!

373
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,700
Fucking hell.

374
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,599
Oh...

375
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,599
This is brilliant.

376
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,400
You're really going
to do all this, I mean,

377
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,799
put a canal right
through the middle?

378
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah.

379
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
It's brilliant.

380
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,700
I'm Bruno Fella, CID.

381
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,799
Are you Sandy or Will?

382
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,799
- I'm Will.
- Hello, Will.

383
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,799
- Hi.
- You know what?

384
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,400
I was born right there,
just about there.

385
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,599
I'd have drowned.

386
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,000
Mm.

387
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,000
I love it.

388
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,299
I think it's really nice.

389
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:19,599
This is Sandy, um,
Hoffman, my partner.

390
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,799
- Sandy.
- Hello.

391
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,799
Detective Bruno Fella, CID.

392
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,000
Hi, Bruno.

393
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm just saying this
is a fabulous building.

394
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
I think it's brilliant.

395
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,700
Thank you.

396
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,400
Was it you had
the scrape with the villains?

397
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,000
No, I wouldn't say
it was a scrape.

398
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,200
Well, they scraped my car.

399
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,099
No, I was running late
for the first break-in.

400
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,500
I wasn't quite
prepared for the second.

401
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,599
Well, I get it, completely.

402
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,799
You know,
completely get it, you know?

403
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,000
You're, um, disgruntled.

404
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:42,000
I would be, you know,
putting all that effort

405
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,599
into making such a fabulous
building, you know,
in an off-style community.

406
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,500
You know, you don't
need the grief, do you?

407
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,900
Well, it's no fun, Bruno.

408
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
You know, financially
it's a disaster.

409
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,799
The insurance is gonna be
through the roof.

410
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,099
You know your problem, Sandy?

411
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,799
What's my problem?

412
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,799
King's Cross.

413
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,099
Is what?
What is it?

414
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I mean... that's you there.

415
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,400
You got a British
Library over there

416
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,900
with Eurostar,
and bang in the middle

417
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,200
you got crack village
with a load of Somalians
walking about with machetes.

418
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,700
It's an area in flux.

419
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,500
Oh, they left
a computer disk, the burglars.

420
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,200
Did you know that?
With my photographs.

421
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,700
Oh. What do you mean? Where?

422
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,500
Sorry, they <i>returned</i> it.

423
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,525
More than that, they downloaded
my personal photographs
off my laptop, that they
stole the first time,

424
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,599
and they brought it back.

425
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Well, can we see it?

426
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,799
Yeah.

427
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,500
Lovely.

428
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,599
So they got compassion.

429
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,299
I won't go that far.

430
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,599
Well, I'm not saying you gotta
show them compassion.

431
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,400
You know, you're just like
my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend.

432
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,900
<i>They're</i> the criminals,
<i>they're</i> the bad guys.

433
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,200
Can I have a go?

434
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,000
There...
Don't you just love a Mac?

435
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,200
Sweet, huh?

436
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,099
And what do you say
to your girlfriend?

437
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:50,500
I'm the Old Bill,
Will, you know?

438
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,900
I've been on the beat,
undercover, in a suit,

439
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,200
you know, it's the law.

440
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,000
It's, uh, Einstein's
law of relativity.

441
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,900
What does that mean,
exactly, sir? Relativity?

442
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,900
Well, relatively speaking, um,
it means, if me and Sandy here

443
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,700
break the law, you know, we're
gonna get a decent lawyer.

444
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,799
Hmm.

445
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,200
Now these guys
who broke in here,

446
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,299
they go straight to jail.
"Do not pass Go."

447
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,099
One law for us, one for them.

448
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:18,299
Except we haven't
broken the law.

449
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,900
Everyone's broken the law.

450
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,900
Our vision for King's Cross,

451
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,200
for the public spaces
of King's Cross,
starts with the premise

452
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,099
that we acknowledge an urban
landscape is a <i>built</i> landscape.

453
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:35,900
It starts as an argument
with society's
phony love affair with nature.

454
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,900
We are against the mistaking
of grass for nature,

455
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
of green for nature.

456
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,700
King's Cross is
an area of North London

457
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,599
associated with poverty,
crime, vice and urban decay.

458
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,500
Our job is to
transform the landscape,

459
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,599
not decorate it with green...

460
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,000
because how we feel about
ourselves, how we behave,

461
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:07,299
is directly affected
by the space around us.

462
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
How we design
the outdoors of our city

463
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:13,500
is as important
as how we design the indoors.

464
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,099
We're gonna take the canal,
and use it like calligraphy,

465
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,900
like ink, to write
around the development.

466
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:27,500
We think it's the cleaners.

467
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
What about the cleaners?

468
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Breaking in.

469
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
They don't even clean properly.

470
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
It's true.
They don't.

471
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,799
They never empty
the dishwasher--

472
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,099
or load it,
for that matter.

473
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:36,799
They bring their kids,
their boyfriends.

474
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,400
- Come on.
- They do.

475
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,799
And to be honest, Will,

476
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,200
it's getting
a little traumatic.

477
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I'm staying late
at the office and worrying

478
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,500
that the place is gonna be
ransacked while I'm in it.

479
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,400
Look, they're cleaners
and they're not clean.

480
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,700
Okay.

481
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,200
Good, thanks.

482
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Thanks for the tea,
thanks for the theory.

483
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,900
I'm sorry, but what
does that mean?

484
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,500
It means <i>your</i> boyfriend's
been to the office, Ruby,

485
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,900
and yours, Wei Ping,

486
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,200
and yours, actually, Joe,

487
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,500
so where do the rules say
we <i>can</i> have boyfriends,

488
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,799
but the cleaners can't?

489
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,799
Or kids.

490
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,599
And... explain this
to me, please.

491
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,099
How the cleaners are
getting up onto the roof

492
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:11,299
then swinging through the
roof line, and <i>why</i> they are,

493
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:16,200
when they've already
got the keys and codes?

494
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
All right.

495
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,799
Hi.

496
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,799
I've just been trying
to defend our cleaners.

497
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,200
Uh-huh.

498
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,700
Well, I've just spoken
to the alarm company.

499
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,099
Whoever broke in used
the cleaners' code.

500
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:36,700
What do we actually do
if we see a burglar?

501
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,500
Call the police?
Kill them?

502
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,000
There's a weird ecology,

503
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,799
of course, to these break-ins.

504
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,799
The new computers,
they're upgrades,

505
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,200
you know, they're new models.

506
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
You could argue that...

507
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
a break-in every,
oh, say, six months,

508
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,500
it's good business, isn't it?

509
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,200
Just not every six days.

510
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,200
I wish they would steal
this car, for instance.

511
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,000
42,000 miles.

512
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,799
I've got the criminal mind.

513
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,700
Lots of wanting to be bad.

514
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,500
See an ass, want to bite it.

515
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,599
I just never do.

516
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Good.

517
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,000
Good.

518
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:25,700
What you've done,
there is you strayed
from the moral to the criminal,

519
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,900
and you crossed
the moral-criminal divide.

520
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,589
Wanting to bite an ass
is a <i>moral</i> issue,
and then only if the ass
belongs to someone

521
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,799
who objects to the idea.

522
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,799
Criminal would be biting
the ass without permission.

523
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,799
You're such a lawyer.

524
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,500
Yeah.

525
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,299
Anyway, then what?

526
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,299
Then what, what?

527
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,000
You bite the ass, then what?

528
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:47,099
Well, then... they bite yours.

529
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,000
Is the theory.

530
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:54,799
It's so long since
I've bitten or been bit...

531
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,200
It's good to talk about that.

532
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,500
Mm.

533
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,799
The problem is, you find out
we're all so miserable.

534
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,200
Hello, hello.

535
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,099
He doesn't look happy.

536
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:12,400
Do you recognize him?

537
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Uh... no.
I don't know.

538
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,400
God, I wish I could lip-read.

539
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,500
Hang on.

540
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,700
I think I <i>can</i>.

541
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,099
"I don't like you anymore.

542
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:27,500
"I like Sandy.

543
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,900
"He's everything
I want in a man.

544
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,500
"And stop burgling
his bloody office."

545
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,200
God.

546
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,900
Hello.

547
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,900
Got a light?

548
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,299
We don't smoke. Sorry.

549
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:45,599
But there is the car lighter.

550
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:50,299
All right.

551
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,700
So is it?

552
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,900
'Course it is.

553
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
I don't believe it.

554
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,099
Okay.

555
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,900
I've got nothing on
under my coat.

556
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Well, this,
this might warm you up.

557
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,500
Christ.

558
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh, God.

559
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,599
Okay?

560
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,400
Have a good night.

561
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Christ.

562
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,500
Can I get inside?
It's cold.

563
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,500
Sorry. Come on, this is a car.

564
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,299
It's not a community
cent... Jesus Christ.

565
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:26,900
Hey. Come on.

566
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,700
- Um...
- So what are

567
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,000
- you guys looking for?
- Huh?

568
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,599
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

569
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,299
Are you spying on us?

570
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
- No.
- Not at all.

571
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,000
- Who's this?
- It's insulting.

572
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:43,200
- No, we're...
- Seriously, we've been...

573
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Did you not trust us.

574
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:45,200
This your girlfriend?

575
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,400
No, she's not my girlfriend.

576
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,099
Trust-- if you have to say it,
it means there is none.

577
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,400
Use a condom.

578
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,900
That's my answer to trust.

579
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,000
Sure, I trust you--
use a condom.

580
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,400
One minute you're nice to me,

581
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,200
the next you're spying on me.

582
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,299
No, Erika. Erika, listen.

583
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:02,700
Erika.

584
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,799
Uh-oh.

585
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,299
Please, please,
can you just listen? Please.

586
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:10,299
50 pounds, <i>whatever</i> you want.

587
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,200
What's your name?

588
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,700
Except talk.

589
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,200
What if I want to talk?

590
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,599
Call the Samaritans.

591
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,500
Oh, please.

592
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,299
You know, I don't
have time for this.

593
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,500
Humans.

594
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.

595
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,200
We talk.

596
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,299
Why?

597
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,700
I don't know.

598
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,400
Animals don't talk,
because they don't lie.

599
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,500
Erika!

600
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,500
A ridiculous idea.

601
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,500
That was good?

602
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,599
You really helped.

603
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,799
We should, uh...

604
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,799
We need,
we, we need to lock up.

605
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,799
You work here?

606
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,799
Yeah.

607
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,799
Yes.

608
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,099
Bad place for an office.

609
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:00,700
What's your project about?

610
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,400
I don't really know.

611
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,799
A place I'd like to live in...
or run through.

612
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,200
I would love
to jump, you know...

613
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,200
Chik, chik, chik...
jump from...

614
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,500
building to building.
Chika-chik, chik.

615
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
This is amazing.

616
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,799
But what?

617
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,200
No buts. Is that amazing?

618
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,200
Yeah.

619
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,500
But dangerous.

620
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,700
Oh.

621
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,599
No buts.

622
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,900
You see the city?

623
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,400
What is it like?

624
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,000
Better.

625
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,500
Did my dad just
not want to come with us?

626
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,700
Uh... He, um...

627
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,200
He loved you,

628
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,299
but, uh, he was engineer.

629
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,200
He was needed.

630
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,299
Every bridge was blown up. So...

631
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,400
Anyway,

632
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,599
it's more complicated.

633
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,900
No story from Sarajevo
is simple.

634
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,500
No! No!

635
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,000
I don't want to.

636
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,400
No! No!

637
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,500
There's no bread.

638
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,699
No bread, no butter,
no flour, no dairy.

639
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,500
Nor last night.
You didn't notice.

640
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,800
I did.

641
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,800
Hmm.

642
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,500
We're trying a diet.

643
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,199
How's the chicken?

644
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,400
Chicken's good.

645
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,699
Good.

646
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,500
Ice cream is dairy.

647
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,800
Ice cream <i>is</i> dairy,

648
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,800
That's right.

649
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
Sweetie, try the chicken.

650
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,199
Try the chicken first.

651
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,199
This is a diet just for you.

652
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:33,699
Bea, put those
things back, now.

653
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,099
Have some chicken.

654
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,900
Rosemary suggested
we try this.

655
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
- Where is it?
- Remember her?

656
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,199
- Where <i>is</i> it?
- Therapist Rosemary.

657
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,099
What have you done
with the ice cream?

658
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,900
There's amazing stuff
about the affect
of food on mood,

659
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,199
on the brain.

660
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,199
Rosemary.

661
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,199
I chose it!

662
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,199
She said that?

663
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,300
Wow.

664
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
It's not fair!

665
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,900
Every time I say
something in this house,

666
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,199
it gets repeated
back as a question.

667
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,400
You know I like ice cream!

668
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
If I say "good morning,"
people ask me

669
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,599
what makes me think
it's a good morning.

670
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,900
- What?
- No ice cream!

671
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,199
I'm trying to hold
this family together, Will.

672
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,400
There's no ice cream, Mama.

673
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,000
Who are "people"?
Who are these mysterious people?

674
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
I feel a fool
with my sun box, I do,

675
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,199
but it's the only sun
you can rely on in this house.

676
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,300
- I want the ice cream!
- No, Liv... Hey, Liv, come on.

677
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,900
- What are you talking about?
- Why have you taken it away?!

678
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,900
I wanted a slice of bread.
You know what? Really?

679
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,300
Can we, can we just try this?

680
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,800
Can we try this
as a family, please?

681
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,199
Just as a family for a week?

682
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,400
Don't say try together
if we don't decide together.

683
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,699
Well, don't take
a side together,

684
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:24,699
if we don't cook together

685
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:26,199
or talk together
or do anything together.

686
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,800
- It's not fair!
- We don't do anything together.

687
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,000
- There we are.
- Exercise...

688
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
- Exercise...
- "There we are" what?

689
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,000
- Stop that.
- Exercise. Exercise...

690
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:32,400
You don't even hear it, Will.

691
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,199
- You don't even hear it.
- Exercise, exercise...

692
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,199
Eat your chicken first!

693
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,599
- No!
- Stop yelling.

694
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,099
Chicken?
I'm a vegetarian.

695
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,300
- Don't you yell at me.
- You don't eat vegetables.

696
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,800
- It's disgusting!
- You don't eat vegetables.

697
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
- Disgusting! Disgusting!
- Will you stop?

698
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:49,099
No, it's disgusting!
No, leave me alone!

699
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,900
Now, what we know is,
if we smash things

700
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and we scream and we shout,
we get our own way.

701
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,500
That's what we know.
Or run away.

702
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,099
Great... Great.

703
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,500
That's great.

704
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,400
Liv.

705
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,900
Liv, darling.

706
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,300


707
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,900
Or we just say nothing!

708
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,500
Because God forbid we ever...

709
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,400
we ever say
what we actually meant!

710
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
No, just let
the shutter come down!

711
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:32,599
Anyway...

712
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,800
I really have
to get back to the office.

713
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,000
Bea, my car keys.
Where's the battery? Bea.

714
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Hey, I need the battery.

715
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,699
We're human.
Don't punish us.

716
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,000
We get fed up.

717
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,500
Fed up.
Is that about the diet?

718
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,000
No. It means upset.
I don't know why.

719
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,599
It's a metaphor, remember?
We spoke about those.

720
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,599
"Cried your eyes out" doesn't
mean your eyeballs fall out.

721
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,800
Metaphors. "Fed up."

722
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,099
It's nothing to do with food.

723
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,199
Where's my battery, Bea?

724
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,000
- It's in my box.
- Where's your box?

725
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,599
It's my box.
You can't go in my box.

726
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,000
- Well, you go get the battery.
- Bea.

727
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,800
It's all right.
We're working it out.

728
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,699
Bea, go and get
Will's battery.

729
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
"Will's battery"?

730
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,300
Can you explain to me

731
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,199
why you suddenly need
to go to the office?

732
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,599
- You know why.
- You're not the police.

733
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,199
No, and the police
are not night watchmen.

734
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,099
Nor are you.
Most wives would worry

735
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,599
if their husbands went
cruising in King's Cross

736
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:01,300
- every night.
- Come on.

737
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,900
Hire a security company, Will.

738
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,500
Most wives are married
to their husbands, as we're
being so accurate tonight.

739
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,500
Dads, wives, Will's battery.
Thanks for that.

740
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,199
I don't see the real father
around much.

741
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,659
I love your sun box,
whatever the fuck
it's supposed to do.

742
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I keep hoping
it'll warm you up.

743
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,500
Skinny cup, extra shot, right?

744
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
Right.

745
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,199
Thanks.

746
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,500
Oh. I brought a CD.

747
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,000
I've got some CDs.

748
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,500
No. For dancing.

749
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,000
I like to dance.

750
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,900
In cars?

751
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,300
Inside, outside, upside down.

752
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,199
I can dance on your lap,
but it's not

753
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,500
- for free.
- Absolutely.

754
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,300
I still make you come,
but not inside me.

755
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,599
Some guys think
that's not cheating.

756
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,099
Hmm?

757
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:29,099
 I need a man

758
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,300
 To make me love

759
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,300
 To make me sing

760
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:43,000
 I sing, I need a man

761
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,900
 To make me feel
 Like I'm a queen.

762
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,099
- That's good.

763
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:52,500
You are. You're very good.

764
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,000
You're great.

765
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:04,199
That's okay. It's fine.

766
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,000
What do you mean?

767
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:06,599
It's okay.

768
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:28,599
Hi.

769
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,400
I'm sorry.

770
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,199
You smell of perfume.

771
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,000
I don't know how I do.

772
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,599
Nor do I.

773
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,599
I love you.

774
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:51,000
Is that an answer?

775
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:54,000
It's the truth.

776
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:55,400
What do you need?

777
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,900
What do you want ever?

778
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,699
I feel as if I'm
tapping on a window.

779
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,000
You're somewhere
behind the glass,

780
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,300
but you can't hear me.

781
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,000
Even when you're
angry, like now,

782
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,800
it's like someone a long, long
way away is angry with me.

783
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,300
Well, glass is better than ice,
which is where we were earlier.

784
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,599
Sweden, ice, depression,
the high rate of suicide?

785
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:18,099
Mm-hmm.

786
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:21,300
I never got close to anybody who
didn't want to talk about that.

787
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,000
- Mm.
- Or free love.

788
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,699
- Liv Ullmann.
- Liv Ullmann.

789
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:28,000
Who's Norwegian, by the way.

790
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,000
Well, there are no other
Swedes to talk about?

791
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,400
Nobody lives there.

792
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,699
You could drive for hours
before you pass another Volvo.

793
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,900
Abba.

794
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,699
Let's face it.
It's a sad old list.

795
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:42,199
What about the English?

796
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,900
You brought us what? Sarcasm?

797
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,699
- Mm.
- And the Beatles.

798
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,099
 Knowing me, knowing you.
A-ha.

800
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,300
Lager louts.

801
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,500
No. You invented lager.

802
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,000
Excuse me. The Danes.

803
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,900
Yeah, same difference.

804
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,599
No, no, no.

805
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,400
I love your laugh.

806
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
I love your laugh.

807
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:14,199
I'd like to gather up all your
laughs and lock them in a box,

808
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:16,099
like Bea's, and nobody
would be allowed the key.

809
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,199
Where are you going?

810
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,900
- The shower.

811
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,400
Or to kill that fucking fox.

812
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,599
Come back here.

813
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,199
- Mama?
- I'll take you.

814
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,898
- I'm taking you.
- Mom takes me.
No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

815
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,500
I'm taking Bea. I want to.
Go back to sleep.

816
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,500
Mom takes me.

817
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:16,699
Daddy will take you today.

818
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:18,400
It's fine. It's fine.

819
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,199
See? I'm up.

820
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,000
It's okay.

821
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:26,300
Seat belt, Bea.

822
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
What's that?

823
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,099
Is that a CD?

824
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:39,199
Yeah.

825
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:40,800
Yes, it's a CD.

826
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,800
Is it yours?

827
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,400
N... Yes.

828
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:47,099
Shut up!

829
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,900
"Shut up" is good, isn't it?

830
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,199
Excellent.

831
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:07,300
I did it!

832
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,099
I did it! I did it!

833
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:10,699
You watch, I'm going
to do it again.

834
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,500
Paul?
Paul, are you ready?

835
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,000
Are you ready?

836
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,000
Sweetie, you're still wet.

837
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You're dripping.

838
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yellow towel.

839
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,699
It's not yellow.
Is it yellow?

840
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,199
Yellow stitching.

841
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,800
Oh.

842
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,699
You have to dry yourself.

843
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
I did. I used the hair dryer.

844
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,099
Well, how about my sweater?

845
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:45,099
It's kind of a towel.

846
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,599
Is it a good color?

847
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,500
It's a good color,
and it's a sort of towel.

848
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,900
But <i>you'll</i> be cold.

849
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,099
No. If I get cold,
I'll wear the towel.

850
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,800
Hey, look.
Those guys-- they're amazing.

851
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:22,300
I want a lesson.

852
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,900
Oh!

853
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,599
- Mom, are you okay?

854
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:40,599
You okay? Get up.

855
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,900
Oh, you're soaked.

856
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,699
Excuse me. We would like
to donate our towel.

857
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:49,300
No, I'm fine, thanks.

858
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,800
Really, we hate our towel.

859
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,699
We hate our towel.
We do. We hate it.

860
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:54,699
It's looking for a new home.

861
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:56,900
Thank you.

862
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,800
Come on, lovey.

863
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,400
That was good.

864
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,000
You should join the circus.

865
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,199
Get off me!

866
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,500
It's cold.

867
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,400
It's a bit cold.

868
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,800
Why wind down the window?

869
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,599
To get some air.

870
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,199
Why?

871
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:22,400
You know.

872
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,000
Quite a strong perfume.

873
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,199
- Actually...
- It's my job.

874
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,000
I got you a present.

875
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,800
In return for the CD,
the coffees...

876
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,300
It's good, I think.

877
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,000
My wife uses it.
She says it's good.

878
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,300
That's fucked up.

879
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,300
What man wants
to be with a girl
that smells like his wife?

880
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,900
No, I didn't say I wanted
to be with a girl.

881
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,300
You think I like
to smell like this?

882
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,199
You think I like to wear panties
which cut my pussy in half?

883
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,099
I didn't mention your...

884
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:52,000
Men are incredible!

885
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,800
Thank you.

886
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,315
Ow!

887
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,900
So what, you clean this area up?

888
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,400
- Is that the plan?
- Not exactly.

889
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,000
If you work with nature,
why are you so against nature?

890
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Well, A: I'm not,
and B: I'm absolutely not.

891
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,000
The fox in your garden.

892
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,900
What about the fox in my garden?

893
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The one wild thing in your life
and it makes you crazy.

894
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:35,400
You know, turn the whole world
into a park,

895
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,099
- like Disneyland.
- That's not what we do.

896
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:38,800
- With flowers...
- Oh, that's ironic,

897
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,400
because that's the
opposite of what we do.

898
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,400
Go ahead, clean up,

899
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,800
because we will move
to another alley,

900
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,300
and we'll take
the foxes with us.

901
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,099
Good.

902
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:47,699
Because this is the human heart.

903
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,500
This is the world.
It's light and dark.

904
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:53,800
They're putting fortune cookies
in with the crack now, are they?

905
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,800
This is what, the human heart?
This is the world?

906
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,900
This is shit.

907
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,199
You're talking shit.

908
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:00,000
I have to charge you.

909
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,099
- Huh?
- No, I have to charge you.

910
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:03,400
You crossed the line.

911
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,500
- What do you mean?
- We have chit chat, it's free.

912
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,800
I keep warm, I buy coffee.

913
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,699
It's a trade.

914
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:12,500
You abuse me, that's business.

915
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,599
How did I abuse you?

916
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,099
Men abuse me, I get paid.
50 pound.

917
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:17,800
No way am I giving you
50 pounds.

918
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,699
50 pound.

919
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm not giving you 50 pounds.

920
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:21,099
50 pounds!

921
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,099
No.

922
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:23,599
- Fuck!
- Oh.

923
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,500
Uh-oh.

924
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:28,599
- He's like a monkey.
- I've got to call the police.

925
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:29,800
What? To say what?

926
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
To say what?!

927
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,199
There's a man
breaking into my building!

928
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,199
It's not a man, it's a boy.

929
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,800
I've got a special thing,
a code,

930
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,400
four-three, uh...

931
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,199
No, I'm Hoff...
Yes, I'm Hoff...

932
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,500
Well, my partner's Hoffman.

933
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,300
Where am I?!
I'm in my car!

934
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,800
I'm looking at him!

935
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,800
I'm... four...!

936
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,000
Hey!

937
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,199
Wait!

938
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,400
Come here!

939
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,400
Fuck.

940
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,900
Hey!

941
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:26,099
We're getting out of here.

942
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,500
- What about Miro?

943
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,500
What about Miro?

944
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:35,599
What happened to your hand?

945
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,599
Forgot my keys.

946
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:37,699
You're bleeding.

947
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:40,000


948
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,000
No.

949
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:46,699


950
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:49,199
I didn't fall, Mom.

951
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,300


952
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,500
Why can't you do it?

953
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,099
You're a tailor.

954
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:35,199
Dad!

955
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,900
Dad! Dad!

956
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,500
I'm too old to chase robbers.

957
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:40,300
Dad!
All right, hey.

958
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,900
Oh. Hey, what are you
crying about?

959
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,800
Where the hell
have you been?

960
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,000
We've been worried sick.

961
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,199
Why is Mommy crying?

962
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,099
Why aren't you in bed?

963
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:52,400
I near... I could've caught him.
I nearly caught him.

964
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,599
The police weren't
going to get here,

965
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:56,000
so I followed him.

966
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I mean, I imagine,
it's just a boy.

967
00:52:58,099 --> 00:52:59,699
What did the police
do with my car?

968
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:00,800
The police?

969
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,300
They were here for probably
about a minute.

970
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,099
So what are you telling me?

971
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,800
Somebody's stolen my car?

972
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,800
- Eh?
- Oh...

973
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,199
My bag's in there,
the wallet, my keys.

974
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,199
Oh, Jesus Christ, Will.

975
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,800
You left the car open?

976
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,800
Yeah, well, I was
chasing a thief, Liv.

977
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,599
Did you get a look at this boy?

978
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,400
No, not really.

979
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,199
Hey, hey...

980
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,000
it's okay.

981
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,400
Reminds me of when
I first met you,

982
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,800
driving around,

983
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,099
trying to get her
to sleep in the back.

984
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:44,199
You in your nightgown.

985
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:48,599
Remember?

986
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:53,800
So beautiful.

987
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,400
Will, a boy can still stab you.

988
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,099
Now, what if you'd
caught up with him?

989
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:08,900
I don't know.

990
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,099
Anyway, he's not going
to come back.

991
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,800
It's probably all over now.

992
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:19,800
Zoran...

993
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,800
Zoran, watch.

994
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,099
Hey, did you see that?

995
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,800
Did you see that?
I just landed it.

996
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,500
Yeah, yeah, nice.

997
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:39,500
You're in the wrong place, man.

998
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:56,199
I telephoned earlier
about my jacket.

999
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,300
Yes.

1000
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,599
This is strange.
You probably don't remember,

1001
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,099
we bumped into each
other the other day

1002
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:05,199
at the sport center.

1003
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:07,000
We gave you our towel.

1004
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,300
Oh, that's right.

1005
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,699
So, I've, uh, I tore my jacket.

1006
00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:16,099
Oh, I can't repair that.

1007
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:20,199
Well, I can, but...
you'd always see the tear.

1008
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,800
I don't think, the cost,
I don't think is worth doing.

1009
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,300
Really?

1010
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,500
It's a favorite.
I'd hate to throw it away.

1011
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,500
I can try.

1012
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,699
Come back Friday.

1013
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,800
Great. Friday.

1014
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,699
Good, I'll see you on Friday.

1015
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,900
Friday.

1016
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,800
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

1017
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,099
Your wallet.

1018
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,099
It was in your jacket.

1019
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:56,300
Oh, thank you.
It's new.

1020
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,800
I've already lost
one wallet this week.

1021
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Thank you.

1022
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:02,000
I was rude, I'm sorry.

1023
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
This city, you know,

1024
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,099
you see someone in one place,
and then another,
it makes you very...

1025
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:07,099
Sure.

1026
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:09,699
- I have to get back.
- All right.

1027
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,500
Can you...

1028
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:17,000
if I, if I brought a suit, can--

1029
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,099
I lost some weight-- if I
brought it tomorrow, say?

1030
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:21,300
I'm out tomorrow.

1031
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,500
Friday then?

1032
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,900
Okay.

1033
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,099
Thank you for this.

1034
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,699
Will, she's asleep.

1035
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,800
- Huh?
- It's a miracle.

1036
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,000
I can't believe it.

1037
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:47,199
That's great, huh?

1038
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,699
Why are you trying on suits?

1039
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:55,300
Nothing really fits me.

1040
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,400
It looks fine.

1041
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,500
Can I say "Rosemary says"?

1042
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,900
Absolutely.
What does Rosemary say?

1043
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,699
She says...

1044
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,300
Well, you know, it's:
Bea says "I need."

1045
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,800
I say "I'm here,"
she says, "I need,"

1046
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,400
I say "I'm here."

1047
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,300
I'm not talking about going
to work tomorrow, I'm just...

1048
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,500
thinking about
going back to work.

1049
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,099
Good.

1050
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:26,800
And start thinking about you.

1051
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,300
About us.

1052
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,800
Bea can come
with me sometimes.

1053
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,699
She can dig, make a mess.

1054
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,199
No, that's great,
but you're busy and distracted.

1055
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:37,599
And?

1056
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:38,699
Go on.

1057
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,300
And...

1058
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,199
she's not my daughter.

1059
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,500
And right now
when she's such a, she's so...

1060
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,500
you can't trust me
to take care of her.

1061
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,599
If you were measuring how far...

1062
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,599
away from where we need to be,
you and me...

1063
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,099
is that a long way?

1064
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,800
I don't think you can ask
a question like that. It's...

1065
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,400
Put on a suit,
sound like a suit.

1066
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,099
It feels a long,
long way right now...

1067
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:19,800
from where it needs to be.

1068
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:26,599
I wish we could
unsay and unhurt
back to wherever that is,

1069
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:29,300
and start again.

1070
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,599
And how far back?

1071
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,800
I remember you bit me.

1072
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,699
You were angry with me
and you bit me.

1073
00:58:37,699 --> 00:58:39,099
I don't remember why.

1074
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,699
I don't know why either,
but I remember I bit you.

1075
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,500
You really bit me.

1076
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:55,099
And I thought
we were very close.

1077
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,599
We were.

1078
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,099
Yeah, but that's just teeth.

1079
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,699
It's not invisible, but...

1080
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,099
That's amazing.

1081
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,300
Astonishing, great.

1082
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,599
- Shall I put it on?
- Yes.

1083
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:43,800
Is there, somewhere?

1084
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,000
Uh, yeah, my son's room.

1085
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:46,000
Just there.

1086
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:47,300
Is he in...?

1087
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,900
No, no, he's at school.

1088
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,599
Your son, is he studying
to be an architect?

1089
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,500
No, he's only 15.

1090
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,500
It's a school project.

1091
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,199
I'm an architect...

1092
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:28,000
of sorts.

1093
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,199
Hmm.

1094
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,500
Funny.

1095
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Your son's project.

1096
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,099
We use those figures.

1097
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:43,099
They're scale figures.

1098
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:44,099
They're from Japan.

1099
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:45,800
Hard to find in London.

1100
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,099
Oh.

1101
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:48,800
He must get them from school.

1102
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,099
Uh, your trousers?

1103
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:03,800
You have, uh, children?

1104
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,000
Oh, you were with a little girl.

1105
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,699
- My daughter.
- Uh-huh.

1106
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:10,800
I remember her.

1107
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,000
This will take
a week, at least.

1108
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,300
I'll have to remove the lining.

1109
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,599
That's fine.

1110
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:19,400
I'll write you a bill
for the jacket.

1111
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,699
Should I just write "repairs"?

1112
01:01:27,699 --> 01:01:29,000
Yeah.

1113
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:35,699
What's this?

1114
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:39,000
A practice keyboard.

1115
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:40,500
No space for piano up here.

1116
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:43,300
You can play electric
or electronic keyboard?

1117
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,400
Um, no, I'm happy with this.

1118
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,500
You know, I imagine.

1119
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:51,599
You know, so.

1120
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,400
Not a good place to make noises.

1121
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,400
You could always use headphones.

1122
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:07,199
I'm fixing this and I, um,
should mind my own business.

1123
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:17,699
People like me from my country,
we-- I'm Bosnian--

1124
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,300
we think it's dangerous
not to be able to hear.

1125
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,000
Tell your son
if he's interested,

1126
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,800
he can come and see our office,
you know, to look around.

1127
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,000
We're very close.

1128
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,300
King's Cross.

1129
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,500
I might do that.

1130
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Will Francis is your name?

1131
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,099
- Mm.
- Hmm.

1132
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,500
She'll never be his daughter.

1133
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,000
You wish Bea was
Will's daughter, is that it?

1134
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,400
I wish she was.

1135
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:55,599
I wish she was.

1136
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,300
Then maybe we'd all be happy.

1137
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,800
I don't want to be cold.

1138
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,599
I don't want to be sad.

1139
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:08,400
I don't want to be angry
with him anymore.

1140
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,400
I have this light box.

1141
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,599
What kind of light box?

1142
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,199
For depression.

1143
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,400
The doctor prescribed it

1144
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,500
and I sit in front of it
for hours.

1145
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,000
It's supposed to stop me
from getting down.

1146
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,099
Give me an image of that change
that you hope for in Will.

1147
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:34,699
He's looking at me.

1148
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Sugar?

1149
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,900
Uh, no, thank you.

1150
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,900
I think you'll want sugar.

1151
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,199
Okay.

1152
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:55,099
Are you unhappy?

1153
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,800
What makes you say that?

1154
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,400
You always seem, when you
come here, I don't know.

1155
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,900
I'm happy enough.

1156
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,699
Happy enough.

1157
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:13,099
So English.

1158
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:32,099
I think it was
the happiest day, really...

1159
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:34,900
when Bea was born.

1160
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,900
And then sometimes I think...

1161
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,699
sometimes I think
Bea was punished

1162
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,800
because I left my husband
and I left Sweden.

1163
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,599
And then I met Will,
and he was kind.

1164
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,800
And we were happy,
we really were.

1165
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,699
But then I just push him away,
I don't know why.

1166
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:05,699
I just push him away from me.

1167
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,300
Oh, this is, um, this is going
to sound really stupid.

1168
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,000
I forgot the shirt.

1169
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,699
I was going to bring a shirt

1170
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,000
for you, you to copy and...

1171
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,300
I forgot, I forgot it.

1172
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,300
Um, all right.

1173
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,900
Should I go back and get it?

1174
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,099
I can go back and get it now.

1175
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:30,300
And I'd be, like, two seconds.

1176
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,300
Okay.

1177
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,099
Or perhaps when you come
for the suit?

1178
01:06:33,099 --> 01:06:35,199
It's a bad time?

1179
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,900
You mean without the shirt?

1180
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,300
Right, that doesn't make
any sense, does it?

1181
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,500
Uh...

1182
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:46,400
I'm going to the supermarket.

1183
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,000
- Right.
- I have to go to work.

1184
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
How do you get
the shopping home?

1185
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:51,500
Uh, bus.

1186
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,199
I'm practically driving a bus.

1187
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:55,900
My car's stolen,
so I have a company van.

1188
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,199
It's electric.

1189
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,300
You could probably walk faster.

1190
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,500
Pedestrians will overtake us.

1191
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,099
Say yes, and what's the worst
thing that could happen?

1192
01:07:04,099 --> 01:07:05,400
Yes.

1193
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,900
Tell me about your son.

1194
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,400
- Mirsad?
- Mirsad?

1195
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,099
It's, um...

1196
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:26,300
He hates his name,

1197
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:30,599
but was a name for
Sarajevo, not for London.

1198
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:35,199
Now his name's Miro.

1199
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,500
But I think
he should love his name.

1200
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,000
You know, names in my country,

1201
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,199
they're like flags.

1202
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:45,599
You can live or die
because of your name.

1203
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,500
Mirsad-- it's a Muslim name.

1204
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,199
It should be Serbian
because of his father,

1205
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,300
but, you know,
I can be stubborn sometimes.

1206
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,300
You what?

1207
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,300
Stubborn sometimes.

1208
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,000
But that name saved his life.

1209
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,699
When we,
when we were getting out

1210
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:07,699
of Sarajevo, we came out with
Red Cross, leaving the siege.

1211
01:08:07,699 --> 01:08:12,099
The guards, the Serbs, stopped
us at one of the checkpoints,

1212
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:14,400
and they took him,
they took my son,

1213
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,699
and they said what's your name?

1214
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:20,199
And he said, "Mirsad, my name
is Mirsad," his Muslim name.

1215
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:24,199
Well, if he told
his family name,

1216
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,100
the Serbian name, "Simic,"

1217
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,199
they might have taken him
as a son of a traitor.

1218
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:36,899
Anyway, since then, I don't
think he's ever really...

1219
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,399
He-he gets in trouble.

1220
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,100
That's another story.

1221
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:45,000
I can't talk about siege
in supermarket, sorry.

1222
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,800
We had a break-in.

1223
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:05,399
Several, actually,
in our office.

1224
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,699
Something gets smashed,

1225
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:11,699
I mean, I mean,
not just the windows.

1226
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:18,199
But not all breaking's bad,
is it, you know?

1227
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,500
I mean, you break habits.

1228
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:25,100
Maybe, maybe before
you repair the window,

1229
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,600
you should smash a few more.

1230
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,399
That's all I do, you see,
in my job, I tidy up.

1231
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:34,600
There's a mess between
buildings, and we come in.

1232
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:39,199
Squeeze in bits of green,
like dressing.

1233
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,899
Like lipstick,

1234
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,300
like pretty.

1235
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:52,000
Anyway, that's a roundabout way
of saying...

1236
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,500
the shape of your mouth,

1237
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,300
I could probably
draw it by heart.

1238
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,199
What are you thinking?

1239
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:09,500
I was thinking,
uh, that was a roundabout way

1240
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,500
of saying you're married,
which I know,

1241
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,199
and I was thinking

1242
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:17,300
Bosnian men would say less,
but, uh...

1243
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,600
would want more.

1244
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,100
They love to talk, they love
talk, believe me, but, uh,

1245
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:28,100
talk for them is politics,
women for them is not talk.

1246
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,000
That's crushing.

1247
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,199
I didn't mean it bad.

1248
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,399
She's going to be
disappointed, but okay.

1249
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,100
Yeah. I have to take
the boys to cricket.

1250
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,399
Here's Mom.

1251
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:57,600
Dad can't make it.

1252
01:10:57,699 --> 01:10:58,699
Aw...

1253
01:10:58,699 --> 01:10:59,699
But here's what
we're going to do.

1254
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,699
It's okay.
Look, sweet...

1255
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:01,899
Why can't Dad come?

1256
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,800
Because he's working.
He can't make it in time.

1257
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,800
He never comes.

1258
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,199
We have the videos,
video, video, video.

1259
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,699
Hey! Hoopla.

1260
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:10,399
Stop. That stop there
is very good.

1261
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,000
I know. I realize.

1262
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,899
Again, again.

1263
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,600
- Again?
- Again.

1264
01:11:18,699 --> 01:11:20,600
What do you think?

1265
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,100
- She's great, eh?
- Great.

1266
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,300
It's good, too,

1267
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,100
because the batteries
are back in the remote.

1268
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,600
It's a mystery how these
batteries finally went home

1269
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,800
just when we need them.

1270
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:33,600
Big mystery.

1271
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:37,100
How did you video this

1272
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,699
and be in the picture
at the same time?

1273
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,899
Paul was cameraman.

1274
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,399
- Paul?
- Bea's trainer.

1275
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,800
You've met him a hundred times.

1276
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,100
Paul loves Mom.

1277
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,600
No, Paul loves Bea.

1278
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:50,100
But...

1279
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,399
does Paul love me?

1280
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:14,500
If you could do anything
right now, what would it be?

1281
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,800
I have to work,
I have to get back.

1282
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,399
Oh, come on.

1283
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:20,699
Let me think.
I don't know, uh...

1284
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,300
Change everything up
until this moment.

1285
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,699
Uh, not my son, everything else.

1286
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,000
I can't do that for you.

1287
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
You didn't say
what could you do.

1288
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,899
What would I do is what you
said, not what you could do.

1289
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:39,000
What could I do?

1290
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,100
Why?

1291
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,399
I-I-I don't understand.

1292
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,699
I don't understand, either.

1293
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:57,699
If I had a magic
wand, I don't know,

1294
01:12:57,699 --> 01:13:00,100
persuade my son to come
to Sarajevo with me,

1295
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:02,500
start a new life.

1296
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,600
And you, if you could
do anything right now,

1297
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,699
what would you do?

1298
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:18,300
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1299
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,000
I'm sorry.

1300
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,600
Hey, are you waking up?

1301
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:03,699
Mm-hmm.

1302
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,699
I made bread.

1303
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,199
I can smell them.

1304
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's hot. Careful.

1305
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:21,199
You're happy.

1306
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,899
Is that so strange?

1307
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,500
Put on the telly;
it might be on the news.

1308
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,300
Ha! You are not so big
I can sit on you.

1309
01:14:34,452 --> 01:14:36,078
Mm...

1310
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,699
Ah, Miro.

1311
01:14:38,523 --> 01:14:41,423
Hmm...

1312
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:44,600
We should go home this
summer to Sarajevo.

1313
01:14:44,699 --> 01:14:47,699
I think you would love it.

1314
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:51,000
Tanja says there are
flights for a few pounds.

1315
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,399
Maybe.

1316
01:14:53,203 --> 01:14:56,296
Hmm.

1317
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,600
Maybe.

1318
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,399
Your grandmother
would cry for weeks.

1319
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:04,399
Great.

1320
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:46,699
What's this?

1321
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:49,399
Oh, uh, I-I forgot.

1322
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,199
- I put it in your room.
- Where'd you get it?

1323
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:52,399
It's a customer.

1324
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,399
I sewed his jacket.

1325
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,699
He's an architect.

1326
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:56,500
He said, uh, you could go
and look at his office.

1327
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,199
What's the matter?

1328
01:15:58,199 --> 01:15:59,199
I have to go out.

1329
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,199
What did you say to him?

1330
01:16:00,199 --> 01:16:02,800
Wh-Wh-What do you mean?

1331
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:03,899
Did he go in my room?!

1332
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
No. Just to try some trousers.

1333
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,800
Why do people have
to go into my room?!

1334
01:16:07,899 --> 01:16:09,899
Miro, <i>dushma</i>, he's a good
person, he's a good man.

1335
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,199
He was just trying to help.

1336
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,699
You think everyone is good.

1337
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:14,000
No one is good.

1338
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,300
What are you...

1339
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,699
What is it?

1340
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,699
I'm in such shit.

1341
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,399
She's taken back the laptop.

1342
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:39,699
She what?

1343
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:41,899
She's taken back the laptop.

1344
01:16:41,899 --> 01:16:45,399
That is so fucked up.

1345
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:47,699
She says they're friends.

1346
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,300
Yeah, but that's like,
"Hello, my son did it.

1347
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,199
Lock him up."

1348
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,600
She says she's going to talk
to him, do some sort of deal.

1349
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:01,100
Papa.
Papa.

1350
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,100
Will!

1351
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,199
What?

1352
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:12,500
Lady looking for you.

1353
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,000
What?

1354
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,100
A lady is looking for you.

1355
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:35,500
Are you okay?

1356
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,000
What is it you want from me?

1357
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,399
Nothing, I don't want anything.

1358
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:40,399
Because you don't just walk
into someone's life

1359
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:42,399
and knock on their door
and kiss them.

1360
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:43,699
- You cannot do that.
- I know that.

1361
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,399
What? What-what's the matter?

1362
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:46,699
You used me;
you have someone else.

1363
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,300
- Oh, you mean Liv?
- Promise me, promise me.

1364
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:49,500
That's the last thing I want,
believe...

1365
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,800
Promise you what?

1366
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,199
Promise you I'm not flirting?

1367
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,699
- I know what that is.
- I don't believe you.

1368
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,000
I know what that is,

1369
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,500
- and this is not what it is.
- I don't believe you.

1370
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,100
I don't...

1371
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,500
I can't talk anymore.

1372
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,300
I want to go somewhere
and not talk.

1373
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,800
Not talk.

1374
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,699
I have a friend;
she... she works.

1375
01:18:12,699 --> 01:18:16,000
Maybe she would lend her place.

1376
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,300
It's close to here.

1377
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,699
Call her.

1378
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:20,000
It's not a hotel,
it's not a palace

1379
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,000
Call her.

1380
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,000
What's her number?

1381
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:03,199
The clothes under my
clothes, they're not...

1382
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:07,199
I've always wanted to
make something in silk.

1383
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:17,000
I'm, uh, giving myself to you.

1384
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,699
I want it to be worth something.

1385
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:25,199
Come here.

1386
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,800
Hi.
- Hi.

1387
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:22,699
I'm, uh, I never met somebody
when I was already in their bed.

1388
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,199
I'm Will.

1389
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,300
Thank you.

1390
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:27,899
I'm Tanja.

1391
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,199
It's good to have
a man in my bed.

1392
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,199
I hope it's contagious.

1393
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,899
I'll get my, uh...

1394
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:04,800
"Don't kill the boy,"
Brave Benoit said,

1395
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:06,699
"but Dai replied,

1396
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,699
"'Why not? I come
from the Isle of Wight.

1397
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:12,899
"We eat young boys a lot.'

1398
01:23:12,899 --> 01:23:18,899
"But secretly, Dai had a heart.
"He kept it in a jar.

1399
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,300
"He hadn't seen
that jar for years.

1400
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:23,699
He found it in his car."

1401
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,199
Great reading.

1402
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,899
That's not reading,
that's knowing by heart.

1403
01:23:27,899 --> 01:23:29,399
There's a metaphor.

1404
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:30,800
Where?

1405
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,600
To know by heart.

1406
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:40,500
"'Forgive, forget, and eat more
jam,' the jar said on the lid.

1407
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:44,199
"Dai ate some jam
and thought a lot,

1408
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:47,000
"and in the end, he did.

1409
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
"Go home and be a better boy,

1410
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,199
"although sometimes,
it's tricky.

1411
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:57,699
"There is a moral to this tale:

1412
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,199
Jam makes fingers sticky."

1413
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,500
Well done.

1414
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,899
Sticky jam.

1415
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:09,600
Okay, my sweetie.

1416
01:24:09,699 --> 01:24:16,100
It is now time
for you and bunny
to get some sleep.

1417
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,100
You're a monkey,
be a wise monkey.

1418
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:32,600
Somebody asks you a question,
you know nothing,

1419
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:34,100
you see nothing,

1420
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,300
you hear nothing.

1421
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:38,000
I'm not a monkey for sure.

1422
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:41,399
Your mother's a Muslim dog.
They have loose tongues.

1423
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,100
Are you my brother's son,
or your mother's?

1424
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:45,399
We'll find out.

1425
01:24:46,899 --> 01:24:48,199
And you don't come
to the car wash.

1426
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,600
You don't come to our house...

1427
01:24:50,699 --> 01:24:54,699
If the police find anything,
we're all going to prison...

1428
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,100
Hurry up!

1429
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,300
You're a thief-- I'll kill you!

1430
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,899
Go ahead, dent the dents.

1431
01:25:15,899 --> 01:25:18,300
Get away from my boy!

1432
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,800
It's no wonder my brother
was fucking someone else.

1433
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:29,500
I don't want you
in this house!

1434
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,000
- Sure, whatever.
- Understand?

1435
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:39,100
Mirsad.

1436
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,199
Why didn't you give it back?

1437
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:48,800
I will, I will.

1438
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,699
I will give it back.

1439
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:52,300
I don't get it.

1440
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,000
He knows, doesn't he?

1441
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,399
Why doesn't he just
tell the police?

1442
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,699
I don't get it.

1443
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:31,000
Will?

1444
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Yeah.

1445
01:26:34,699 --> 01:26:36,000
You should come and see this.

1446
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,600
- What?
- Come... come see.

1447
01:26:46,199 --> 01:26:48,600
Just left here.

1448
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,000
Keys are inside.

1449
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,300
 I need... a man

1450
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,300
What does that mean?

1451
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,300
I don't know.

1452
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,899
Will, is there something
going on with you?

1453
01:27:25,899 --> 01:27:28,300
I don't know.

1454
01:27:31,899 --> 01:27:33,699
Something's going on with me.

1455
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:36,399
Erika, you know, Erika...

1456
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:40,399
...forgave me, and, uh, well...

1457
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,399
It's early doors, but you know,

1458
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:47,399
you know,
lattes have been drunk.

1459
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,899
- That's great.

1460
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,600
Sandy, can we go somewhere?
Can we drive somewhere now?

1461
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,199
- Will...
- Anywhere?

1462
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,100
Don't tell me
you're fooling around, okay?

1463
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,100
I'm just entering fidelity;
don't exit.

1464
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,699
It's not about fooling around.

1465
01:28:00,699 --> 01:28:02,600
It's always
about fooling around.

1466
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,000
- Fucking hell.

1467
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:21,500
Will, I've, I've got to...

1468
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,399
and so have you.

1469
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,800
Oi!

1470
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,699
Where do you
think you're going?

1471
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,100
Get on the back.

1472
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,300
I'm late for school.

1473
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:50,399
Yeah, two years late--
get on the back.

1474
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:53,500
You're in a lot of trouble, son.

1475
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,100
Put your helmet on;
it makes you invisible.

1476
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:02,699
And don't stab me
while I'm driving.

1477
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,500
You'll fall off.

1478
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:11,600
Everybody's chasing around
looking for evidence--

1479
01:29:11,699 --> 01:29:13,199
fingerprints, DNA.

1480
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:14,600
I just look at the buildings

1481
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:17,100
and I know it's you.
I know.

1482
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,899
Someone's doing very well,
and you're not.

1483
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,300
I mean, what do you earn,
a few quid, pair of trainers?

1484
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:26,000
You're the bit
you spit out to your friends--

1485
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,199
whoever they are--
and I know who they are.

1486
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:30,100
They're not your friends.

1487
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,300
How long are we staying?

1488
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:34,699
Ah... she's lovely.

1489
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,399
They should tip London on its
side and let a few million

1490
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,899
people slide right off, you see?

1491
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,100
There's no air.

1492
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:48,100
There's no air in a cell.

1493
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:50,000
None.

1494
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:53,699
And that's where
you're going, no question,

1495
01:29:53,699 --> 01:29:56,800
and that's a tragedy.

1496
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Which of us is lying the most?

1497
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,500
About what?

1498
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,899
That's not even
the right question.

1499
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Which of us is lying
to themselves the most?

1500
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,699
What?

1501
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,100
About this.

1502
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,500
I'm not lying.

1503
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,399
I have, um...

1504
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
a photograph.

1505
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,300
What photograph?

1506
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:39,300
Of us.

1507
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,000
It's, uh...

1508
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:44,300
incriminating is-is
the right the word.

1509
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:46,699
I don't know
if it's the right word,

1510
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,399
unless I know
what you're talking about.

1511
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:51,800
It took me a...

1512
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:55,399
a little while to make
sense of the jacket.

1513
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:59,199
You suddenly
appearing at my door.

1514
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:02,100
That you'd been
following my son.

1515
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,199
You must know that mothers

1516
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:09,300
will do anything to protect
their children.

1517
01:31:09,399 --> 01:31:12,199
Why-Why would you
take a photograph?

1518
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:14,899
Was that when your
friend came back?

1519
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,300
Why would you do that?

1520
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,000
Why would you do this?

1521
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,399
You steal someone's heart;
that's a real crime.

1522
01:31:25,399 --> 01:31:28,100
And then what?
You call the police?

1523
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:29,699
No.

1524
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,000
I don't know... No!

1525
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:36,600
Did you know how long...

1526
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:43,100
Do you know how long
since anybody touched me?

1527
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:47,899
I should have told you, I know.
I should have said something.

1528
01:31:47,899 --> 01:31:50,199
It wasn't a plan.

1529
01:31:50,199 --> 01:31:53,000
It wasn't a plan--
it was you, that's the truth.

1530
01:31:54,699 --> 01:31:56,300
I have to get out.

1531
01:31:56,399 --> 01:31:58,300
Is that why you come
to bed with me?

1532
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,000
For what, a photograph?

1533
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,300
How squalid.

1534
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,399
The water is cold.

1535
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,100
But what about...?
But it...

1536
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:10,300
It doesn't make any sense.

1537
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:11,399
What about today?

1538
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
Or now?

1539
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,399
Look, a lie, that's
right. That's my...

1540
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,399
That's me--
I lie, I lie.

1541
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,000
Can't we drawn a line and
say no more lies between us?

1542
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,600
No more lies.

1543
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,300
No, I have to ask you to lie,
to continue to lie.

1544
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:28,000
I have to beg you
not to report my son.

1545
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,500
That's what this is: a bribe.

1546
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,399
If you like.

1547
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,500
I'm, um... not stopping.

1548
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:49,000
Old Bill's been at our place.

1549
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,600
He says he's going to
try and charge my dad.

1550
01:32:52,699 --> 01:32:54,300
You shouldn't be here.

1551
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:56,500
What if they followed you?
Then what?

1552
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:00,600
So? There's nothing for them
to find here, is there?

1553
01:33:00,699 --> 01:33:02,000
They've been down
the car wash, as well,

1554
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
making out with
all this evidence.

1555
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,399
They've got nothing.
Trust me, nothing.

1556
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,600
Hey!

1557
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:13,800
Zoran! The laptop!

1558
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,899
They'll find my laptop!

1559
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,100
Oi!

1560
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:22,899
Up there!

1561
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:24,199
Come on!

1562
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,100
Get to the other end.

1563
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,100
- Come on!
- Come on!

1564
01:33:38,899 --> 01:33:39,800
Don't do it!

1565
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:41,500
Hey!

1566
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,399
Little bastards are going

1567
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:48,699
through Eastern Avenue,
Eastern Avenue, on their way!

1568
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:05,399
The towpath!

1569
01:34:07,699 --> 01:34:08,899
Miro!

1570
01:34:08,899 --> 01:34:11,000
- Miro!
- I'll head him off.

1571
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:14,100
Miro!
Miro!

1572
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,500
Don't, don't move him.

1573
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,500
Come on!

1574
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,100
Don't move!

1575
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,500
I'm sorry.

1576
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,100
You going to be okay?

1577
01:35:58,199 --> 01:35:59,300
Uh-huh.

1578
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,100
Show Mommy she can go
to her work,

1579
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:03,100
we can do ours.

1580
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,500
Hmm?

1581
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,899
Wei Ping, can you just...?

1582
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,399
...exactly as it says
on the model.

1583
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:10,699
Number nine needs to go left.

1584
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,899
All right, take it back, please.

1585
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,899
Yeah, way left.

1586
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,899
To the very end.

1587
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:17,699
At least three feet to the left.

1588
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,800
The model's not bad.

1589
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:19,899
Number nine is.

1590
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:20,800
Way back!

1591
01:36:20,899 --> 01:36:21,800
- Will?
- Yeah?

1592
01:36:21,899 --> 01:36:22,899
A couple colleagues of mine.

1593
01:36:22,899 --> 01:36:24,399
This is Erin and Lorna,
this is Mr. Francis.

1594
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

1595
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,399
Was a fair result all
around on the burglary,

1596
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:30,699
and the DNA matched, and we got
most of your stolen goods back.

1597
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,899
Yes, Sandy said, um,
he's a young boy?

1598
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:35,000
Yeah, he's 15.

1599
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,199
He's been in and out of trouble.

1600
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,000
You know, final warning.

1601
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,199
He's going to prison.

1602
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,199
If he gets
convicted he will, yes.

1603
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,899
He'll go to Youth
Detention Center.

1604
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:44,500
Is this your computer, Will?

1605
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,899
It's got all your files on it.

1606
01:36:45,899 --> 01:36:47,500
Well, then it must be.
Great.

1607
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,600
Well, I'm afraid
we're going to have to keep it

1608
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,899
just until the case
comes to court.

1609
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,300
Bea? Bea, no!

1610
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,500
- Bea!
- Wei Ping, could you just...?

1611
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,600
I'm okay, I'm fine.

1612
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,300
Darling, stay with Wei Ping.

1613
01:36:57,399 --> 01:36:58,899
This is a hollow victory for us,
ain't it, girls?

1614
01:36:58,899 --> 01:36:59,899
It is, yeah.

1615
01:36:59,899 --> 01:37:02,600
I mean, he's just
the little runt
who's done all the dirty work.

1616
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,000
We can't make a case
against the adults.

1617
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,699
They're the real villains.

1618
01:37:06,699 --> 01:37:07,699
Yeah, it's hollow.

1619
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,100
Well, you may find it hollow,

1620
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,000
we find it whatever
is the opposite of hollow.

1621
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,199
Of course, we understand.

1622
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:13,699
Because actually, it's been
like a siege, okay?

1623
01:37:13,699 --> 01:37:16,300
We have felt under siege,
and worse than that,

1624
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:18,300
innocent people have been
wrongly accused, our cleaners,

1625
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:19,600
you know, it's very degrading.

1626
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,899
It's because we know the boy,
you know?

1627
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,399
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with him.

1628
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:24,600
Nothing wrong? He's a thief,
that's what's wrong with him.

1629
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,600
Well, there's no question.

1630
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,600
Will, all this
is about some court...

1631
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:32,500
- It's not a court.
- Conciliation court.

1632
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,100
Whereby, if we go along
to meet the boy...

1633
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,000
What is it?

1634
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,500
Explain, it's a Camden thing.

1635
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,000
He gets let off, hooray.

1636
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,300
It's not a court.

1637
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:42,300
Me and Lorna, we work
on the Youth Offenders team,

1638
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,000
and we encourage the offenders
to face their victims.

1639
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,199
Right, so we go to the court,
arrange to meet him...

1640
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,899
Not a court, sorry,
whatever court it is,

1641
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,399
and he might not go to prison?

1642
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:51,399
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

1643
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:53,899
The law's an ass.

1644
01:37:53,899 --> 01:37:55,600
Look, he's a boy.

1645
01:37:55,699 --> 01:37:57,300
The last thing he needs
is prison.

1646
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:01,000
You know he's a Bosnian
boy, and his mom, well,

1647
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,399
well, they're refugees,

1648
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,399
and his mom's,
his mom's in pieces.

1649
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:06,300
Mr. Francis,
what do you think?

1650
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:07,800
You've been very quiet.

1651
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:11,000
I just, I want to draw a line
under the whole thing.

1652
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,199
Bea!

1653
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,899
Somebody call an ambulance!

1654
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,899
I'm so sorry! I am so sorry!

1655
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
All right, don't move.

1656
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,300
It's gonna be all right.

1657
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:29,000
I'm here, I'm here.

1658
01:38:33,899 --> 01:38:35,199
I'm so sorry.

1659
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:46,800
Hi, sweetie.

1660
01:38:46,899 --> 01:38:48,300
My fibula's broken, two places.

1661
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,600
Ouch.

1662
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,300
And they have to put wires in
to fix it.

1663
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,300
Oh.

1664
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,600
The doctor said, she said what?

1665
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,500
She said that I'd be up
and climbing again in no time.

1666
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,800
Hmm. We've got an X-ray
if you want to see.

1667
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:01,699
Definitely.

1668
01:39:01,699 --> 01:39:03,800
Sorry.

1669
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,100
Oh, sweetie, don't be sorry.

1670
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,199
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

1671
01:39:06,199 --> 01:39:07,800
I'm sorriest.

1672
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,199
- Daddy cried.
- I did not.

1673
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:11,899
I laughed on the wrong
side of my face.

1674
01:39:11,899 --> 01:39:14,000
- Is it hurting?
- It did.

1675
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,100
We had painkillers.

1676
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,500
Bea had two, daddy had four.

1677
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,100
You did not.

1678
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,600
So, listen, Mommy's going
to stay, okay?

1679
01:39:23,699 --> 01:39:24,699
And I brought everything.

1680
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,399
I brought Stuffy.

1681
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:29,199
This hospital's very peculiar.

1682
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:30,399
They don't understand
color, do they?

1683
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:32,399
Tried to put us
in a yellow room.

1684
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,800
I need to speak to Mommy.

1685
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,000
Mommy's here.

1686
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,600
I need to speak
to Mommy by myself.

1687
01:39:37,699 --> 01:39:39,800
Will?

1688
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,800
Okay.

1689
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:50,199
You have four new messages.

1690
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:52,100
Hello, Will, it's Amira.

1691
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:53,300
I need to see you.

1692
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:55,399
Uh, call me. Thank you.

1693
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,800
Hello, Will, it's Amira. Uh...

1694
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:06,300
I'm sorry.

1695
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:12,600
First of all, I want
to give you this,

1696
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,800
which are the pictures.

1697
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:20,600
I wish, I wish
they hadn't caught him.

1698
01:40:20,699 --> 01:40:24,399
I wish I hadn't hurt you.

1699
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,300
Truly.

1700
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:27,600
Then help me. Help him.

1701
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,600
I can't.

1702
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:33,600
This meeting with Miro and
police, if you came, it would...

1703
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,699
I really can't.

1704
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,199
He'll go to prison.

1705
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:41,500
He's agreed, Miro.

1706
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:44,300
If you help him, he'll come
back with me to Sarajevo.

1707
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:46,500
He won't say anything in court
except he's sorry,

1708
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:47,800
I promise you.

1709
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,699
You're a good person;
I know you.

1710
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,199
- Don't do that. Don't do that.
- Please.

1711
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:54,500
- Don't do that.
- Please.

1712
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,399
Amira, I can't,
I can't do what you want.

1713
01:40:56,399 --> 01:40:57,699
How can I?

1714
01:40:57,699 --> 01:41:00,500
If I meet your son, it will come
out that I know you,

1715
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,100
how I know you.

1716
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,100
Please, help me.

1717
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:05,800
I can't help you.
I can't help you.

1718
01:41:05,899 --> 01:41:07,199
I can't.
I'm sorry.

1719
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:08,899
Please! Please!

1720
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Listen, I really tried
to get him out of trouble.

1721
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,399
They've got too much evidence.

1722
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:16,399
Come on. I can't.

1723
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:17,600
Please, please, please,
I'm begging you.

1724
01:41:17,699 --> 01:41:18,600
I can't.

1725
01:41:18,699 --> 01:41:21,600
- I beg you. I beg you.
- Amira, please.

1726
01:41:21,699 --> 01:41:23,600
I beg you!
I beg you!

1727
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:25,600
Please, please help.

1728
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,399
I can't. I can't.

1729
01:42:33,699 --> 01:42:36,899
I was determined
not to blame you.

1730
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,800
And I know it wasn't your fault,
I know it wasn't this afternoon.

1731
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:43,600
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

1732
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,000
No, it's me
who should be saying sorry.

1733
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:58,100
I've been looking for love...

1734
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:00,199
out there.

1735
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:05,699
I thought I might have found it.

1736
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,899
And did you?

1737
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,000
I think I might have lost
the love I did have.

1738
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,399
The love of my life.

1739
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,300
Did I?

1740
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:35,300
Liv, I need to tell you
everything.

1741
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,800
I need to tell you
what I've done.

1742
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,800
I thought you were going.

1743
01:44:20,899 --> 01:44:24,899
I can't go.

1744
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,899
I slept with her.

1745
01:44:27,899 --> 01:44:30,699
It was hard enough
to tell you that last night.

1746
01:44:30,699 --> 01:44:32,600
That was bad enough
without saying it in public,

1747
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:36,899
without hurting you twice.

1748
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:43,899
When you hurt this much,
you can't be hurt twice.

1749
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,600
I was looking at you...

1750
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:54,199
and I was thinking how long
since I'd looked at you.

1751
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:00,100
I don't even know how
to be honest.

1752
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:02,600
Maybe that's why
I like metaphors.

1753
01:45:02,699 --> 01:45:07,699
Because what I want to say
is there's a circle--

1754
01:45:07,699 --> 01:45:10,800
yours and Bea's--
and I'm not in it.

1755
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:19,300
But that's just to justify it,
because there's a part of me

1756
01:45:19,399 --> 01:45:23,899
so dark,
that sees that circle as a cage.

1757
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:39,800
Thanks.

1758
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,699
Will.

1759
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,000
You made it.

1760
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,800
Come in and sit down.

1761
01:45:57,899 --> 01:45:59,600
I'm sorry, there, um...

1762
01:45:59,699 --> 01:46:01,699
th-this is, there's
been a big mistake.

1763
01:46:01,699 --> 01:46:03,399
- Mistake?
- Yeah, um...

1764
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:06,000
Yeah. This boy is definitely
not the burglar.

1765
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,800
I know him, and I know
his... I know his mother.

1766
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,899
What do you mean
you know them?

1767
01:46:10,899 --> 01:46:13,500
They came to our office.
They came to the office.

1768
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,699
Well, how can that be?

1769
01:46:14,699 --> 01:46:15,800
You were told their names,

1770
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,899
yet you never said
you recognized them.

1771
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,300
I don't remember you
saying the name "Simic."

1772
01:46:19,399 --> 01:46:20,899
You definitely
didn't say "Simic."

1773
01:46:20,899 --> 01:46:22,000
Miro and I know each other.

1774
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:24,500
Actually, very well.

1775
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,600
Um, Miro is,

1776
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,800
um, interested in architecture.

1777
01:46:27,899 --> 01:46:29,600
Mrs. Simic?

1778
01:46:29,699 --> 01:46:30,899
He is, yes.

1779
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,199
No, I'm asking is it true
that you and Mr...

1780
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,100
Um, Francis.

1781
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:36,600
Francis-- know each other?

1782
01:46:39,699 --> 01:46:43,699
Mr. Francis is, um,
I've done some work for him,

1783
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,300
adjusting his suit.

1784
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:48,000
I think this Mrs.-- Mrs., um,

1785
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Amira is being... discreet.

1786
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,699
What do you mean, discreet?

1787
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:03,600
Amira is being discreet about
the nature of our relationship,

1788
01:47:03,699 --> 01:47:06,899
which was not
an appropriate one,

1789
01:47:06,899 --> 01:47:10,000
and I think she's trying to
save me from embarrassment,

1790
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,899
from the embarrassment
of myself and my family.

1791
01:47:13,899 --> 01:47:18,300
And that's why she, um,
that's why she's not saying

1792
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:20,600
sh-she came to the office
with Miro.

1793
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:23,399
I remember it, though; it was
the day of the last burglary.

1794
01:47:24,899 --> 01:47:25,899
And Miro cut his hand,

1795
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,100
and that's obviously
where the, uh,

1796
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:31,300
well, that's where the
DNA confusion occurred.

1797
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,699
Mr. Hoffman?

1798
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:37,699
Mr. Hoffman, do you know
anything about this?

1799
01:47:37,699 --> 01:47:40,699
No. No, I can't say I do.

1800
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:41,899
Is this some sort of--

1801
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,100
I mean, are we supposed
to believe this?

1802
01:47:44,199 --> 01:47:47,600
Actually, I've met
both of them at the office.

1803
01:47:47,699 --> 01:47:50,399
Yes.

1804
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,399
And I-I dressed
the boy's cut, didn't I?

1805
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:56,899
Yeah.

1806
01:47:56,899 --> 01:47:59,199
Wai-- hang on a minute.

1807
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:03,600
We recalled a computer,
which you claimed
had been stolen.

1808
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,100
Yeah, I lent

1809
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:08,199
I lent Mrs. Simic my laptop

1810
01:48:08,199 --> 01:48:11,100
sometime when we
were, um, together.

1811
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:13,399
She takes photographs,

1812
01:48:13,399 --> 01:48:15,300
and I was showing her
how to store them,

1813
01:48:15,399 --> 01:48:19,399
um, what to do with them,
how to delete them.

1814
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:24,300
I'd completely
forgotten; I was, um...

1815
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,100
I was confused.

1816
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,300
I'm sorry.

1817
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,300
Really sorry.

1818
01:49:51,399 --> 01:49:54,100
What you did back there,

1819
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:57,899
you gave that boy back
his life.

1820
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:08,399
Stop the car.

1821
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:09,699
What?

1822
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:10,800
Liv, what are you doing?

1823
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,000
You just don't get it,
do you?

1824
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:14,199
- What?
- Oh, God.

1825
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,000
We just go home, right?

1826
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,800
We just go home, nothing
happened, nothing happened.

1827
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,100
- Liv?

1828
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:21,199
- Go, go to Bosnia, go!
- I can't hear you.

1829
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,199
Get back in the car, Liv.

1830
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,899
Just go, go.

1831
01:50:26,399 --> 01:50:28,100
Why were you looking for love?

1832
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:30,000
Ask yourself. Why?

1833
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,800
Why weren't you looking for me?

1834
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,100
Liv, get back in the car.

1835
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,300
No. I don't want you
in the house!

1836
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:39,100
I don't want you in the house!

1837
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:40,800
God!

1838
01:50:40,899 --> 01:50:43,199
God, you drive me out.

1839
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,500
You marry me then!

1840
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,899
No, I don't want a husband!

1841
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,100
I want a good night's sleep.

1842
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:48,600
No. Marry me.

1843
01:50:48,699 --> 01:50:49,699
- No.
- Marry me.

1844
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:50,899
- I'm sorry.
- No!

1845
01:50:50,899 --> 01:50:52,000
I want you back.

1846
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:53,600
- Then win me back.
- How?

1847
01:50:53,699 --> 01:50:54,699
I don't know.

1848
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,000
How? What will I do?
What do I do?

1849
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,899
- I don't know!
- I've been such an idiot.

1850
01:50:58,899 --> 01:51:00,399
Just tell me what I have to do.

1851
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:02,300
I don't know!

1852
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:05,899
Look, I love you.
I love you.

1853
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,500
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1854
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,300
I'm so sorry.

1855
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,199
Mirsad.

1856
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,800
We never met, did we;
I'm Will.

1857
01:51:41,899 --> 01:51:43,399
Hi.

1858
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:44,899
So you're off to Sarajevo?

1859
01:51:44,899 --> 01:51:46,500
You wanted to say something,
right?

1860
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,800
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

1861
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,899
- And...
- Wait.

1862
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,100
Sandy, have you got
a minute?

1863
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,399
I just wanted to say
that I was sorry

1864
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:06,100
and thanks for what you did.

1865
01:52:06,199 --> 01:52:09,199
You've given me another chance.

1866
01:52:10,199 --> 01:52:12,399
Okay, thanks for coming in.

1867
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,800
Thank you.

1868
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,300
This, I think, is the stuff
my mom mended for you.

1869
01:52:21,699 --> 01:52:24,300
Tell her...

1870
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:28,000
tell her thanks
for mending stuff for me.

1871
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I thought maybe your
mother would come with you.

1872
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:40,100
Yeah, she was going to,
but she's packing.

1873
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:42,800
Is she?

1874
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,500
Thank you.

1875
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,100
What is this?
