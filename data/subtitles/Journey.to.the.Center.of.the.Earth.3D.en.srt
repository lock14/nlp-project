1
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,500
Trevor!

2
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,800
Max.

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,900
Although Wegener was ridiculed
by the scientific community...

4
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,200
...he was eventually found
to be correct...

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,300
...in his theory of an original
supercontinent called Pangaea.

6
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,500
Yeah. Okay.

7
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,600
Come to papa.

8
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,700
Hey, Leonard.

9
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,300
Hey, man.

10
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,600
- Dude, you ain't gonna be happy.
- Why?

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,100
- It's Kitzens.
- I see.

12
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
- Hello.
- Trevor, there's my favorite colleague.

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,100
- How are you, Alan?
- I'm good.

14
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,600
- How's that Con Drift class of yours going?
- Fine.

15
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,300
Does it get echoey in there
with so few students?

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
So, what do you got on the books?
I'm busy.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,700
No, no, I can see how busy you are.

18
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,000
So I'll try to be
as quick as possible here.

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
The university is pulling the plug
on your brother's lab.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,100
Pulling the plug?

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, it's gonna finally give us
all the storage space we need.

22
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,200
Let's get something straight here,
this facility is dedicated...

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,200
...to the research of Maxwell Anderson's
theories predicting the volcanic fissures...

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,100
Which have never been proven.

25
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,200
I mean, how many of your late brother's
sensors are even still active? One, two...?

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,900
- Three.
- It used to be 29.

27
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,000
This is the wrong time to shut us down.

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,100
I have got seismic activity in Bolivia.
I got a 13 millimeter shift in Mongolia.

29
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,300
Alan, you can't shut us down.
Keep the lab open.

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
- It's all I've got left of Max.
- It's been 10 years since Max, Trevor.

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,300
I am sorry about all this. I really am.

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,600
<i>Trevor, are you there? It's Elizabeth.</i>

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,100
<i>Pick up, please.</i>

34
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,100
<i>Okay. Well, uh, we are on the 95,
and we're heading your way.</i>

35
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,900
<i>You wanna say hi
to your Uncle Trevor, Sean?</i>

36
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,800
<i>No.</i>

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
<i>Just say hello.
- No.</i>

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,300
<i>I don't want to.
- Oh, no.</i>

39
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,700
<i>Hey, it's your sister-in-law again.</i>

40
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,200
<i>Just wanted to make sure
what time you'd be home...</i>

41
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
<i>...because we'll be there around 6.</i>

42
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
<i>Okay. Well, we'll be on my cell.</i>

43
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
<i>- Oh, boy.
- Sean's looking forward to seeing you.</i>

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,900
<i>- Right, Sean?
-Negatory.</i>

45
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,700
<i>I'm getting worried that
we might've gotten our signals crossed.</i>

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,100
<i>Please call me.</i>

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,900
<i>I'm not home. Leave me a message.</i>

48
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,800
<i>Trevor, we're pulling up
in front of your building.</i>

49
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,700
Trevor, you in there?

50
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,700
Hi.

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
- Hey.
- How are you, Elizabeth?

52
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,800
- Oh, you're home.
- It's so good to see you.

53
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
You too.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,400
How are you? I just got your messages.

55
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,700
- You forgot, didn't you?
- I didn't forget.

56
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,100
How could I forget?

57
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,700
- You didn't forget?
- I...

58
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,000
I forgot.
It doesn't mean I haven't been...

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,300
...looking forward
to time with my nephew.

60
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,200
I haven't seen him since he was 9?

61
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,700
- Seven.
- Wow. Ha-ha.

62
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,100
So how long
is he gonna be staying again?

63
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,800
- Ten days.
- Is that what we said?

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey, Sean. How are you?

65
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,000
Looking good.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,300
- Is that one of those Game Boys?
- It's a PSP.

67
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
- Cool.
- Sean, get up, say hi to your uncle.

68
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,700
Hi to your uncle.

69
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,700
Last time I saw you,
you were about this high.

70
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,500
Yeah, good one.

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,700
You got that?
Okay, you've got all my numbers.

72
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,200
You've got your ticket
and passport in your bag.

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
I will be there to pick you up in Ottawa.

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,400
And by then I'll have found us a house
and we can start on this big new adventure.

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
- Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
-Yeah, it's great.

76
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
We get to be Canadians. Thrilling, eh?

77
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
Just let yourself in.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,300
- It will be good for him, being with you.
- Yeah.

79
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,400
Who knows?
Maybe it will be good for you too.

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,500
This is for you.

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,700
What...? Is this Sean's?

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,700
No, it's Max's.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,200
- Max's?
- Yeah.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,700
So, hey, dude. This is gonna be fun.

85
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,100
A couple of dudes hanging out.

86
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
Five days, maybe a week.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
You know, doing dude stuff,
what dudes do.

88
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,700
You like baseball?
You know what we should do?

89
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,500
We should go get in a batting cage.

90
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,500
Yeah, okay, listen.
I don't like this any more than you do.

91
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,800
As long as you keep stocked
with Mountain Dew...

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
<i>...and TiVo Family Guy,
we'll get along fine.</i>

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,400
- Sure.
- Oh, wow.

94
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
That's an awesome coin collection.

95
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,800
Well, kind of a pet project of mine.

96
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,700
- Yeah, it's really nifty.
- Thanks.

97
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,400
You hungry?
We could order in, you know.

98
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,200
Maybe some pizza, Chinese, Thai food?

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,800
Subs? Or something like that?

100
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,900
- Wow.
- What's that?

101
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,700
Well, it's a box of possessions
of a really great guy.

102
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,200
Your dad.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
His old ball glove.

104
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,400
Mom doesn't talk about him very much.

105
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Well, you can take my word for it.

106
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,700
He was one of those few people...

107
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,500
...who are just exceptional
at everything they do.

108
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,300
You see this?
This was your old man's PSP.

109
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,000
- A yo-yo?
- Don't be dissing the yo-yo.

110
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
This is physics at work.
You got your centrifugal force.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Your gravitational pull,
you got your potential energy.

112
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,600
And in ancient times, did you know...

113
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,000
...that this was actually used
as a hunting implement?

114
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Watch.

115
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,000
- Hey, here, let me try.
- Yeah, you should probably take it.

116
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,200
I have no idea what this is.

117
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,500
Hello.

118
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,300
This was his favorite book.

119
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,500
<i>Jules Verne's
A Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>

120
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,400
You know, I think that was
on my summer reading list once.

121
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,600
- I never got to it.
- That's too bad, it's a good read.

122
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,800
To him, it wasn't just science fiction,
it was inspiration.

123
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,900
He used to read this to me
when I was a really little kid.

124
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
Hello. What are these notes?

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,600
"Magma temperatures reach 1150
in Mongolia"?

126
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,400
"Bolivia. "

127
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,800
"Hawaii. "

128
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,600
Look out!

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Hey, Sean, let's go check out my lab.

130
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
So it couldn't wait for tomorrow?

131
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,700
Your dad used to say:

132
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,400
"Tectonophysics is the science of now,
not tomorrow. "

133
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,100
It's about seismic events
that occur in an instant.

134
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,100
Here, look at this.

135
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia.

136
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,500
And the conditions today are almost
exactly what they were in July '97.

137
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
What's the big deal about July '97?

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,700
Sean, that was the year
that your dad went missing.

139
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,000
Now, look, you see this column
of numbers here?

140
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,100
If the 753, right here, was a 752,
then it would be...

141
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,100
Exactly the same.

142
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,300
What do these little blips mean?

143
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,400
Don't touch anything.
Those little blips are my life's work.

144
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,000
These four little blips
are your entire life's work?

145
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Three. Three little blips.

146
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,800
One, two, three, four.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Iceland.

148
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,000
This makes sense.

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,100
Max saw the readings 10 years ago,
and he took off to investigate.

150
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,800
Now, if the readings are the same today
as they were then...

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,700
...this may be my only chance
to find out what happened.

152
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,800
- I'm gonna need your passport.
- For what?

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,300
I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada
a little earlier than we planned.

154
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
What are you talking about?

155
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,000
<i>I'm talking about this.
A Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>

156
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,300
It's all set in Iceland,
which is where he must've gone.

157
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,900
These are all my dad's notes?

158
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,700
Look...

159
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,500
...Max and I...

160
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,600
Your dad and I were talking about
the possibility of volcanic tubes existing...

161
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,400
...that went down past the mantle,
towards the center of the Earth.

162
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,900
And that's what I think
he went looking for.

163
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Sorry, I gotta put you on a flight
to Ottawa in the morning.

164
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
- And I'm calling Icelandair.
- No, no, look.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
- Hey.
- I just got here, okay?

166
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,200
You're not gonna go and ditch me.

167
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,800
I was the person who found your life's work
fourth little blip thingy in the first place.

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
- This is my brother we're talking about.
- It's my dad.

169
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,800
Now, I don't have to be in Ottawa
for 10 days. I'm going with you.

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,400
Know how much to book
a last-minute flight to Reykjavík?

171
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,300
Something tells me you got it covered.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,800
"Descend, bold traveler,
into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels...

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,700
...which the shadow of Scartaris touches
before the kalends of July...

174
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,900
...and you will attain
the center of the Earth. "

175
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,900
Sorry.

176
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,800
What are you doing?

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm deciphering these notations
that your father made in this book.

178
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,800
I think there's a code
behind the pairing of letters.

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,500
It might have something to do
with the periodic table.

180
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,600
For instance, I've got S-A, I-S, G-G.

181
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,900
I believe that P-B is on the periodic table
and that's plumbum.

182
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,400
- Plumbum means lead.
- What's "Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson"?

183
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,000
What?

184
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, it's right here. Read it down.
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson.

185
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, that's...

186
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,000
That's a clue. Maybe that's a place.

187
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
It could be a thing.

188
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,500
- What are you doing?
- I am Googling at 30,000 feet.

189
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,100
- Are you supposed to be doing that?
- Welcome to the 21 st century.

190
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,600
- Okay. Here.
- It's a person.

191
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,000
"Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson,
executive director...

192
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,700
...of Ásgeirsson Institute
for Progressive Volcanology. "

193
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,400
Max would've known this guy.

194
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,400
I knew it was a good thing to bring you.
His institute has gotta be our first stop.

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,300
Are we there yet?

196
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there.

197
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,200
- You know, you're going kind of slow.
- I'm going kind of safe.

198
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,800
I just saw a goat in the passing lane.

199
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,200
When's the whole adventure thing
gonna begin?

200
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Let me give you something fun to do.

201
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Navigate.

202
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,700
Where are we?

203
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,300
Have we passed Havanschlicht?

204
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,900
- Havanschlicht?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I don't know.

206
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,500
Have we passed Eingarsstadir?

207
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,400
- I don't know.
- Reynivír?

208
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,000
- I don't know.
- Húsavík?

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
-No.
- Grundarhol?

210
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,700
- No.
-Stifflarschtarder?

211
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,100
Stifflardschtarder?

212
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,800
-How about Koldukardarskinoquue?
-What?

213
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,900
-We're definitely lost.
-We're not lost.

214
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,500
Just look for an institution.

215
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,400
-What's an institution look like?
- I don't know, it looks big and institutional.

216
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,800
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

217
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Hey, look, there's a little shack up there.
We can stop there and ask for directions.

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,900
- We're not lost.
- Oh, no, definitely not.

219
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,000
What's this? A ski shack?

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,100
"Ásgeirsson...

221
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,300
...Institute for Progressive Volcanology. "

222
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,100
I told you I'd find it.

223
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,700
Alrighty.

224
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,900
- Not too shabby.
- All right.

225
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.

226
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,200
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hello.

227
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
- I'm Hannah.
- Oh, how do you do? Hi.

228
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm Trev... Professor Anderson.
I'm visiting from America. Um...

229
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
- This is Sean, my nephew.
- I'm Sean.

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
Hi, Sean.

231
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,100
I was wondering if I could
possibly speak with, forgive me here...

232
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,200
...Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson?

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,400
Um...

234
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,800
Well, Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson is dead.

235
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,100
- Dead?
- Yeah, he died three winters ago.

236
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
So do you run the institute?

237
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Nobody does. There is no institute.

238
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,700
- There's a sign down the road that says...
- Progressive volcanology was a failed idea.

239
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,900
Like, you know, the Berlin Wall
and eight-track tapes.

240
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,800
I see.

241
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,900
Well, did you work with him?

242
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,000
No, no. He was my father.

243
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,300
Yeah? I know it. What about it?

244
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,200
Well, this book belonged
to my late brother, Max.

245
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,300
Max Anderson?

246
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,200
We believe that he may have been
in contact with your father.

247
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
- Your brother was a Vernian.
- What's a Vernian?

248
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,200
Someone that believes that the writings
of Jules Verne were actual fact.

249
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,900
I mean, the guy
was a science fiction writer.

250
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,600
And yet this society of believers
regarded Verne like a visionary.

251
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
My father
was the biggest Vernian of them all.

252
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,200
My brother was no Vernian.

253
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,200
This was my father's copy.

254
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,100
Take a look.

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
See, the markings are exactly the same.
Your brother was a Vernian.

256
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,500
Wow, my dad was kind of out there.

257
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,900
- You didn't know him, Sean.
- I'm starting to think you didn't either.

258
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,800
He was no member
of some secret society.

259
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,200
- What are you guys doing here?
- I'm a scientist, I'm a professor.

260
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,900
I'm here because there are seismic sensors
going off 30 klicks north of here...

261
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,000
...that we think
that we should check into.

262
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,800
And that's the reason that we're here,
plain and simple.

263
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,200
Okay.

264
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,700
You know,
there are no roads to the north.

265
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,500
Well...

266
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,400
I'm a mountain guide.
I can take you there, professor.

267
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,800
- Great.
- That's great, I love hiking.

268
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,600
- I would appreciate that. That'd be great.
- Good.

269
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,200
- Call me Trevor.
- You can call me Sean.

270
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
So it will be 5000 kronur to go up there.

271
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,400
Five grand a day? No problem.

272
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,300
An hour.

273
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,400
Do you accept rolls of quarters?

274
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Come on, boys.
I wanna be home by sundown.

275
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,900
Hey, you think you can slow down
a little bit, please?

276
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,100
- Dibs.
- What?

277
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
I got dibs on the mountain guide.

278
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,000
- You're 13.
- Sorry, called it.

279
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,100
- Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs.
- Get over it.

280
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,000
We're getting closer.

281
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,300
All right, just watch your step there.
Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous.

282
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,500
- What's Sneffels?
- Well, why don't you tell him, professor?

283
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,300
Sneffels is the name of the mountain
where this character Liedenbrock...

284
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,900
...apparently found a portal
to the center of the Earth.

285
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,700
Let's just find that sensor of yours,
professor.

286
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,800
There it is.

287
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,100
Yes.

288
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,300
Well, what do you need to do with it?

289
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,000
I gotta unlock it.
It's got, like, a black box...

290
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,700
...that has recorded
all of the seismic activity...

291
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,000
...that's transpired in the last 10 years.

292
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
Could tell me a lot about Max.

293
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,700
And what he was doing
when he went missing.

294
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,400
Trevor, I'm really sorry,
we're gonna have to go now.

295
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,800
Must be corroded.

296
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,700
Trevor, we need to...

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Okay, we need to take cover.
Come on, Sean. Right now.

298
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,600
I'll be right there.

299
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,700
- Trevor, just leave it for now.
-I've almost got it.

300
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,900
We need to take cover now.

301
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
Come on. Trevor.

302
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,900
- Uncle Trevor.
- Get in here.

303
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,200
- Yes. Oh!
-Watch out.

304
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
Hurry up. Come on.

305
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,600
Trevor,
the sensor's attracting the lightning.

306
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
- Drop it. Drop the sensor.
-What? I'm not gonna drop it.

307
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,300
-Hurry!
-It's attracting the lightning!

308
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Trevor?

309
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,900
- Trevor?
-I'm all right.

310
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,900
Sean?

311
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,800
- Sean, you all right?
- I'm good.

312
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,600
- Okay, everybody, just stay calm.
- Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.

313
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,200
Come on.

314
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,900
- Forget it, it's no use.
- Forget it?

315
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,000
She's right.

316
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,000
There must be about 60 or 70 tons
of boulders on top of us.

317
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,700
Take us about a month
to dig out of here.

318
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,900
- We have to find another way.
- What if there is no other way?

319
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,600
There's always another way, Sean.

320
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,500
What else have you got?

321
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,000
Signal flares, first aid, some rope, blankets
and a couple of protein bars.

322
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
But they're on a ration.

323
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,200
- Don't know how long we'll be trapped for.
- Trapped? Is that what we are?

324
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,700
She... No, she didn't mean that.

325
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,300
- Sean, hey, what are you doing?
- God, I'm not getting any service.

326
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,200
Sean, you're not gonna get any signal
down here, okay?

327
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,000
Put this away.
Okay, don't worry about it.

328
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
- We'll find another way out, all right?
-Okay.

329
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,700
One of these
might snake back to the surface.

330
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,400
How do we know which one to take?

331
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,800
My gut says we go right.

332
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,400
Come on.

333
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,000
Looks promising.

334
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,300
Just put one foot in front of the other.
We'll be out of here in no time.

335
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,700
Looking good.

336
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,800
Don't worry, direction is my sixth sense.

337
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,300
Pay attention, Sean.
It's just like doing field work.

338
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,900
I used to love doing field work.

339
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Watch out.

340
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,800
You're not studying rocks in a lab,
professor.

341
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,400
- This is life or death here.
- Yeah, thanks.

342
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
You owe me one.

343
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,500
What does this say?

344
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
That means keep out.

345
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,500
- Maybe that's decent advice.
- No, no. This is great news.

346
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,100
This might lead us to an old mine shaft
and that could be our way out.

347
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,300
- How deep do you think it is?
- Can you give me one of those flares?

348
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,400
Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.

349
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,900
I'm gonna light this
and drop it over the edge...

350
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,200
...and I want you to tell me
how many seconds pass before it stops.

351
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
Okay.

352
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,100
Here we go. Three, two...

353
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,800
Oh, God!

354
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,400
What?

355
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,400
What was that?

356
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,000
Yup, magnesium.

357
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,500
Must run in veins
all through these walls.

358
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Magnesium is kind of flammable,
isn't it, professor?

359
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, used in flares,
used in gun powder, matchsticks.

360
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,900
Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares
aren't such a good idea down here.

361
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,800
Thank you.

362
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
It's the same principle.

363
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,600
- You ready, Sean?
-Yeah, go ahead.

364
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,300
Three, two...

365
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,100
One.

366
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Two.

367
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
Almost three.

368
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,600
Thirty-two squared by... It's 200 feet.

369
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,300
That's no problem.

370
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,100
It's about your basic 20-story high-rise.

371
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,600
- You got enough rope?
- I always have enough rope.

372
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Well, no problem for what?

373
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,300
Rappelling down in there.

374
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,700
We're gonna rappel down
that deep, dark hole?

375
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,700
What, you got a problem with that?

376
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,700
What's the matter?

377
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,900
There's no way
we should be rappelling down.

378
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,400
What are you talking about? You're
man enough to call dibs on the guide.

379
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,500
- But not enough to climb down a rope.
-Guys.

380
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,300
- Calling dibs on the mountain guide...
- No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.

381
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,300
We're going down there.

382
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,500
Steady, steady.

383
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,500
Remember, we're all connected.

384
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
It's okay.

385
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,000
Looking good.

386
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
It's all good down here.

387
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,400
Way down here.

388
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,800
You guys are coming down, right?

389
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,400
All right, Sean, I'm gonna start
lowering you down really, really slowly.

390
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,200
So just lean back
and keep your feet up high.

391
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,800
You're okay, Sean.

392
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,800
We're tethered together,
so nothing bad is gonna happen.

393
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,400
Yeah, sure.

394
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,800
Good.

395
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,400
Sean, keep walking.

396
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,800
You have to keep walking.

397
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
Good.

398
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,100
Hey, you're looking pretty good there.

399
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,400
- Sure you haven't done this before?
- Shut up.

400
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,700
Hey, you mind?
Watch your step, will you?

401
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,500
I'm hanging on for my life here.

402
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,300
Okay, Sean,
just make conversation with me.

403
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,900
So, Hannah, do you come here often?

404
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh, give me a break.

405
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,100
That can't be the best line
you can come up with.

406
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,100
- I'm making conversation with her.
- No, Sean, I do not come here very often.

407
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,200
Ready?

408
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Hey.

409
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,000
Look at all this schist.

410
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,900
- What?
- It's a metamorphic rock.

411
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,800
Green schist, garnet schist,
mica-garnet schist.

412
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,500
- Oh. Schist.
- It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...

413
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,500
Trevor.

414
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,100
-Get to the wall, Trevor.
-I can't.

415
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,700
- I can't, the walls widen out down here.
- Your rope is caught on mine.

416
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,200
You're gonna take us down.
I gotta cut you loose.

417
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,600
-What?
- Hannah, no.

418
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,800
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

419
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
- Don't.
-Don't, don't, don't.

420
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,300
- Uncle Trevor.
- Ah!

421
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,600
Hey, guys, found it.

422
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,100
The bottom's right here.

423
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,200
Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right?

424
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,400
Right?

425
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,000
Hannah?

426
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,100
Guys, what's this?

427
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Looks like
an abandoned mine tunnel to me.

428
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,900
That's Old Bla'gils Mine.

429
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,300
It was shut down 60 years ago
after the big disaster.

430
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,900
Disaster?

431
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,800
How big?

432
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Eighty-one dead.

433
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,500
That's pretty big.

434
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Come on.

435
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,300
Cowboy up.

436
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,500
Hey, Trevor,
was there a mine like this in the book?

437
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,300
No, don't think so.

438
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,600
- Hannah?
-Yup?

439
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Can I ask you something?

440
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,500
Do you wonder if your father
and my brother weren't wrong?

441
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,100
Let me make something very clear
to you.

442
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,100
I am not my father.

443
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,400
And the world that he belonged to
has nothing to do with me.

444
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,600
I understand, of course.

445
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,600
I didn't mean to say that it was
or that it would be...

446
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,300
- You know I'm still on the clock, right?
- You're still billing me?

447
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,300
I bill you until I'm safe in my house.

448
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,800
- Huh.
-Hannah?

449
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,900
What's that?

450
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,100
- This is the old generator for the mine.
- Hey, you don't want to touch that.

451
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,700
What are you doing?

452
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,400
There might be some
volatile compounds there, you know.

453
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,500
- Serious generator.
-Hannah, that thing could blow up.

454
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,900
Stop throwing switches.

455
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,300
Don't do that. No, wait.

456
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
Get away from that thing.

457
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
Okay, I take it back.

458
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,700
This is it, right? I mean, the miners,
they had to get their stuff out somewhere.

459
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,900
-Yeah.
-These tracks could lead us out.

460
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,700
Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?

461
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,200
One.

462
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,900
That's a start. I call front.

463
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,900
What? No, no, no.

464
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,200
Come on, don't get in there.

465
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
We don't even know
if these things work.

466
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,600
They're not safe.

467
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,000
The tracks might not be safe.

468
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,700
Track ahead looks good. Get in.

469
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe.
I wouldn't do that.

470
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,600
I think I see something. It's...

471
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,900
Please tell me it's daylight.
Otherwise, I don't wanna know.

472
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,100
No, it's not daylight.

473
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh, we're in deep schist.

474
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,400
I wish there were seat belts
on this thing.

475
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,700
You're worried about seat belts?

476
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,000
Watch it.

477
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,400
- Hannah.
- I know.

478
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,100
- Pull the brake, pull the brake.
- No, don't.

479
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,300
We won't make it.

480
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,500
Yeah.

481
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,100
Hey, great job. Thanks.

482
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,500
-Guys.
-Stay put, Sean.

483
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,500
Trevor, you okay?

484
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,400
Hannah, your track ends.

485
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,000
Jump in my car.

486
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,700
What?

487
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,000
Quick, you have to do it.

488
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
- Just jump.
- I know that.

489
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,600
Ready?

490
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,500
Trevor, your track ends too.

491
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

492
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,300
Showing the proper way
to save someone's life. Come on.

493
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,700
- Can I help?
- Okay.

494
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,600
Ready?

495
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

496
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,900
Luckily, I had a soft landing.

497
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,800
That's two you owe me now.

498
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,400
- Who's keeping count?
- I am.

499
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,700
That was awesome.

500
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,800
- What happened to you guys?
- Don't ask.

501
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
What's that?

502
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,300
Where are you going? Don't go in there.

503
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,200
What are you guys talking about?
This could be our way out.

504
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,700
There's a hole in the wall.

505
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,600
Guys, check it out.

506
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,500
Rubies.

507
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,300
Emeralds.

508
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,000
Feldspar.

509
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,900
Uh, guys, there's more.

510
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,600
Diamonds.

511
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,900
Bling.

512
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,400
Crystals are frequently formed
and found...

513
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,300
...in volcanic tubes.

514
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,800
This tube could take us back up, right?

515
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,900
We're not far from the surface.

516
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,900
When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.

517
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Money is not the only thing that matters,
Sean. People matter too, you know.

518
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,900
- Something like that.
-Not if you have a Maserati.

519
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
Did you guys hear that?

520
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,200
Nobody move.

521
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,600
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

522
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,300
Muscovite.

523
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
Muscovite.

524
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,800
What's muscovite?

525
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,800
- Muscovite is a thin type of rock formation.
- How thin?

526
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,700
Well, so thin that the slightest change
in weight and pressure...

527
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,600
...can cause it to shatter.

528
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And we're standing on a lot of it.

529
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,600
Just stop. Stop.

530
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Okay, they're stopped.

531
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,700
I need you to walk back
exactly the way we came from.

532
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,000
Very, very calmly, okay?

533
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,500
Tread lightly.

534
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,700
Heel, toe. Doing good.

535
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,400
Doing great. Very slowly.

536
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,500
Good. Come on.

537
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,500
That's it.

538
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That's great.

539
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,600
- Really careful.
- Keep going.

540
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,000
No!

541
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,700
It's actually thicker than I thought.

542
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,100
We're still falling!

543
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,200
Trevor, what's at the bottom?

544
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,100
Well, if what Verne wrote was right...

545
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,900
...these tunnels could go for hundreds,
thousands of miles.

546
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,400
Verne was not right.

547
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,500
Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?

548
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,800
Most likely theory is that it just ends.

549
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,100
Ends? Got any other theories?

550
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,500
Well, the walls of this tunnel
could have gently eroded...

551
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,700
...by water which still runs through it...

552
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,900
...providing a gradual break to our fall.

553
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,800
- Kind of like a water slide.
- Water slide.

554
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay, that's a theory.

555
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,600
But wouldn't the water have formed
stalagmites pointing straight up at us?

556
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,100
- We'll be skewered.
- That is also possible.

557
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,200
Is that water?

558
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,700
Yes. Water.

559
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,600
Water slide, water slide.

560
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,900
Here it comes. Hang on.

561
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,900
Sean! Sean!

562
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,800
Sean, Sean, you all right?

563
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,800
We didn't get skewered.

564
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,900
Make for the rocks.

565
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,500
Where's Hannah?

566
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,800
Hannah! Hannah!

567
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,900
My backpack was too heavy.

568
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,100
Thank you.

569
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,600
So where does that put us now?

570
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Back to one.

571
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,300
Guys, where are we?

572
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,800
Are those stars?

573
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,700
No.

574
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,700
That's just the ceiling of the cave.

575
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,300
Is it just me, or is the cave ceiling...

576
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,900
...moving?

577
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,600
Yeah.

578
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,400
It does look like it...

579
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
...doesn't it?

580
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,500
They're birds.

581
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,400
Electric birds?

582
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,000
<i>They look like Cyanis rosopteryx.</i>

583
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Only they're bioluminescent,
like fireflies or glowworms.

584
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,700
It's incredible.

585
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,900
Cool.

586
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,300
Glow... birds.

587
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,100
Have you seen
these creatures before?

588
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,500
Yeah, in the museum,
but they were fossilized.

589
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,700
These things have been extinct
for over 150 million years.

590
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,500
-Where are they going?
-Hey, a tunnel.

591
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,200
Guys, come on.

592
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,100
Sean, wait. Wait for me.

593
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the center of the Earth.

594
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,500
Max was right.

595
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,200
He was right.

596
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,300
Max was right!

597
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,300
Your dad was right.

598
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,900
He was right.

599
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,700
Hannah, your dad was right too.

600
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,100
They both believed...

601
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,700
...in something
that everyone told them was impossible.

602
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,900
He was right.

603
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,500
- What's that light up there?
- I can't tell.

604
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:27,500
It must be some sort
of luminescent gas combination.

605
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,800
I don't know.

606
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,900
It's like a terrarium.

607
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,100
A terrarium thousands of miles
beneath the crust of the Earth.

608
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,400
A world within the world.

609
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,300
"The waterfalls, which for a long time,
could be heard flowing from afar...

610
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,200
...now cascaded along
the towering canyon walls...

611
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,800
...streaming along the rock
with no end. "

612
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,600
I mean,
it's the same thing Liedenbrock wrote.

613
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Are we saying that Liedenbrock
the character was real?

614
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,100
That he existed?

615
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,900
Someone came down here.
Someone saw all this.

616
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,000
Someone got out
and someone told Verne.

617
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Somebody got out?

618
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,200
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

619
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,400
Doesn't this
just completely blow your mind?

620
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
My mind is blown, yes.

621
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Enormous fossilized mushrooms.

622
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,100
Sort of like humongous fungus.

623
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,800
- Everything in the book is real?
- Probably.

624
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
- And the really dangerous parts?
- I was thinking about that too.

625
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,400
Right.

626
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,000
Trevor, come quick.

627
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,400
- Sean?
- Sean?

628
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,900
- I'm going in.
- Yeah, wait up.

629
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
Hey, slow down.

630
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,300
I'll be right there.

631
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,600
Someone actually lived here?

632
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,600
That somebody...

633
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,200
...was Liedenbrock.

634
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,300
Look at all his gear.

635
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,200
All this, state of the art...

636
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,800
...a century ago.

637
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,200
Hey, Trevor.

638
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,600
I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.

639
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,900
Look.

640
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,100
Looks like on the other side of those trees
there's some sort of underground ocean.

641
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,900
Yeah.

642
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,200
I don't think
that's Liedenbrock's handwriting.

643
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
It's my dad's.

644
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,700
Trevor?

645
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,600
Trevor?

646
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,400
Can I talk to you for a minute?

647
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,600
Out here.

648
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,200
Can you wait here for a minute?

649
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,900
Hey, I think I found Max.

650
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,600
I never really got a chance to know him.

651
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,500
I mean, I wish I did.

652
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,800
He wrote something
and I want you to hear it.

653
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,500
"August 14, 1997.

654
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,600
Today was Sean's third birthday.

655
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,600
Six weeks ago, I promised myself
I would be home in time...

656
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,700
...to give him his first baseball glove.

657
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,700
Now I'm worried...

658
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,900
...that I'll never get the chance.

659
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:05,300
I set out to make an incredible discovery
to share with Trevor and the world.

660
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,300
But now, I would trade it all...

661
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,100
...just to be able to watch you grow up...

662
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,300
...to be the brave and caring man...

663
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,500
...I am certain you will become.

664
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,100
Happy birthday, Sean.

665
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,900
I love you.

666
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,900
Daddy. "

667
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,100
Goodbye, Max.

668
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,600
Come on.

669
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,100
According to Max's journal...

670
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:28,700
...we're here in this giant air pocket
that's surrounded by lava.

671
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,500
And during periods
of intense seismic activity...

672
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,400
- Like the one we're in now.
- That's right.

673
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,000
The magma that surrounds us...

674
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,300
...turns this place
into pretty much just a big oven.

675
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,700
Was that what happened to my dad?

676
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,400
Look, I know I'm just a kid,
but I can handle this, really.

677
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,300
Sit down.

678
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,100
Max was planning an escape.

679
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,800
His notes say that temperatures down here
can easily hit 200 degrees.

680
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,400
A human being can't survive
beyond 135.

681
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,000
- It's already 95 degrees.
- It was 82 when we got here.

682
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,500
- Temperature's rising quickly.
- So, what do we do?

683
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,800
I say that we follow Max's plan.

684
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,300
Here's what he wrote:

685
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,400
"My analysis of the original Verne text...

686
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:25,100
...leads me to believe that across the ocean
due north of my current position...

687
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,800
...is a geyser-like river which could be used
to return to the surface. "

688
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,400
So, what we have to do
is get across this ocean...

689
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,600
...and find the geyser
and just hitch a ride topside.

690
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,000
Topside sounds good.

691
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,700
It's a little trickier than that.

692
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,100
It could get so hot
that the water'll evaporate.

693
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,900
How much time do we have?

694
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,200
Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two, tops.

695
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,900
Probably less.

696
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,200
Okay, so the question is:

697
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,700
What is the fastest way
to get across the ocean?

698
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,600
There's no way we can get around it,
because if we hike...

699
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,000
Oh, we don't have time.

700
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
There's no time to do that.

701
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,000
It's all in the book.

702
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,800
Hey, you all right?

703
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,800
What's the temperature doing?

704
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,500
It is a hundred degrees.

705
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,900
Eat your trilobite, Sean.
We gotta keep our strength up.

706
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,000
Attaboy.

707
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,300
Hey.

708
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,900
Don't we need a center mast?

709
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,100
No. We don't need it.

710
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,300
The wind that we want is way up there.

711
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,900
Thermal. It's a lot faster
than what we got down here.

712
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,100
Good job. That should just about do it.

713
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,300
Hey, I got something for you.

714
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,800
-What is this?
-It's a compass.

715
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It was your dad's.

716
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,700
I remember the Christmas
that your mom gave it to him.

717
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:12,300
She wanted to make sure
that he could always find a way back home.

718
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,400
And maybe it will help you
find a way back to her.

719
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,100
- Thanks, Trevor.
- You got it.

720
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,000
- It means a lot to me.
- Me too.

721
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Oh, there's one thing you should know.
Down here, the polarity is reversed.

722
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,700
I mean, north is south, south is north...

723
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,900
...and we need to bear due north
across the sea.

724
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,800
You mean, south.

725
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,000
Exactly.

726
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,500
All right, it's starting to pick up now.

727
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,800
Okay, hold it. Hold it really steady.

728
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,200
Good, good, good.

729
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
- Good. Ready?
-Yeah.

730
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,700
Three, two, one, go!

731
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,300
- Yeah.
- All right.

732
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,600
Yeah. All right.

733
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,100
Yeah.

734
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,700
Go, go, go.

735
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah. Keep going.

736
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
We're going, we're going.

737
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,300
Hey, well, can you wait for me?

738
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,400
-Well, get on.
-Come on, come on, let's go.

739
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,100
He's back.

740
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,200
Hey, little guy.

741
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,600
Seen those clouds?

742
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah.

743
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,200
The current's pulling us in the direction
we wanna go. We should lower the kite.

744
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,200
Can't do that.
It's a hundred and nine degrees.

745
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,200
It's getting hotter.

746
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,600
We need all the speed we can get.
Leave it up.

747
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,900
It's just a little storm.

748
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,400
Ain't no big deal.

749
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,500
Something moving down there.

750
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,500
Phosphorous and plankton.

751
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,600
It's the same thing we saw
back at the beach.

752
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,100
I don't know.
It looks kind of big for plankton.

753
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,200
Sean, we're not at SeaWorld,
so back off a little bit.

754
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,500
- All right?
- I think it's some sort of fish.

755
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,900
No.

756
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,200
They're everywhere.

757
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,500
Sean, I told you
we'd get to the batting cage.

758
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,000
Batter up.

759
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,000
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

760
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,100
Yeah. Line drive.

761
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,700
- Sean!
- Do you hear something?

762
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,100
<i>- Hello?
- Sean.</i>

763
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,200
<i>- Mom?
- I think we have a bad connection.</i>

764
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,000
Mom, I can't hear you.

765
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,600
<i>Where are you?</i>

766
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,300
Uncle Trevor and I, uh...

767
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,800
...we're sort of on a fishing trip and...

768
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,400
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

769
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,500
Whoa, no, you don't.

770
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,000
<i>- Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one.
- Sean?</i>

771
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,200
- My phone.
- Sean, do you know how to switch hit?

772
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,900
- Ready?
-Yeah.

773
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,200
Out of the ball park.

774
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,300
- Sean.
- Look out.

775
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,600
I got it, I got it.

776
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,100
-Sean.
-No, no, don't.

777
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,200
Get away from the sides.

778
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,400
Look what they're doing.

779
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,900
They don't want us. They want the fish.

780
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:41,200
Listen up. Sean, you take the tiller,
we'll get the line.

781
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,800
Hannah, hold the slack.

782
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Sean, you wanna take us hard starboard?

783
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,400
What?

784
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,700
That way.

785
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,200
Come on.

786
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,100
- Okay.
-Doing good.

787
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,100
Now just let it out gently.
Let it out gently.

788
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,300
Let it out slowly.

789
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,800
It's working.

790
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,600
We're pulling clear of them.

791
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,700
You're the man, Uncle Trev.

792
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,800
That's what I've been telling
the scientific community for years.

793
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,500
Hannah.

794
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,300
Let me see.

795
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,600
The lines.

796
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,200
-Got it.
-Sean.

797
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
Sean, don't do that. No, Sean.

798
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,700
Sean!

799
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,400
- No, Sean!
- Trevor!

800
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,900
- Sean!
-Hang on!

801
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,500
Don't let go!

802
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,900
No.

803
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,400
Trevor?

804
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,100
Trevor?

805
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,900
Hello?

806
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,400
Hello?

807
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,700
Hey, little guy. Where are we?

808
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,100
Hey, do you know
where I can get some water?

809
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,300
I'm talking to a bird.

810
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,500
I must be losing it.

811
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,600
Sean!

812
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,500
Sean!

813
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,000
Wait.

814
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,100
The wind blew him this way.

815
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,500
We still heading north?

816
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,700
Yeah, still north.

817
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,700
He's a smart kid. He knows the plan.

818
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,400
I'm sure he'll be waiting by the river.

819
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,300
Let's find that river.

820
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,700
Hey, come on, wait up.

821
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Where'd you go?

822
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,800
Good job.

823
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,900
Okay.

824
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,200
Now which way?

825
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,300
South.

826
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,600
That's good.

827
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,700
The river's north.

828
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,000
Okay.

829
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,700
Here, let me take that.

830
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,000
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Come on, let me take it.

831
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,100
- Trevor, I'm fine.
- Hannah, Hannah, I got it.

832
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,200
Let's just stop for a second.

833
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,800
Hey, we're gonna find him.

834
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,300
Drink that.

835
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,600
- Is that the last of the water?
- Yeah.

836
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,300
We're gonna need that. Keep it.

837
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
Hannah, drink it.

838
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,300
Come on.

839
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,700
Duck!

840
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
- What the...?
-What was that?

841
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,000
Large carnivorous plant?

842
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,900
Hannah.

843
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,200
Hannah?

844
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,300
Hannah.

845
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,700
Hannah.

846
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,000
Hannah.

847
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,300
Hang in there.

848
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,200
That's one point for me, right?

849
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,600
Right.

850
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,900
Who's keeping track, right?

851
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,200
I get it.

852
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,400
It's a magnetic field.

853
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,100
No way.

854
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,400
Magnetic rocks?

855
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,100
No, no. No, no, no.

856
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,800
No. No.

857
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,500
You try that without wings.

858
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,900
That's the river.

859
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,700
Geyser must be inside that cave.

860
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,900
Sean!

861
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,900
Where is he?

862
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,600
Where is he?

863
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,500
Trevor?

864
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,900
Trevor?

865
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,200
Man, I really wish I'd read that book.

866
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,600
I don't see him anywhere.

867
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,700
Trevor? Trevor.

868
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,700
Hang on a minute. What are you doing?

869
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,900
I'm going to get my nephew.

870
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,300
Hannah.

871
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,800
This is all my fault.

872
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,400
Save yourself.

873
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,800
Just go home.

874
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,900
I'll wait for you at the river...

875
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,600
...for as long as I can.

876
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,200
What did you do that for?

877
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,400
Just in case.

878
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:02,100
Sean!

879
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,700
Sean!

880
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,800
Sean?

881
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,800
Sean!

882
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,600
Sean!

883
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,600
Sean! Sean!

884
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,700
Come on!

885
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,800
Oh, God, I'm glad to see you.

886
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,100
Yeah, you too.

887
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,500
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

888
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,700
We should go.

889
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,600
Wait, wait, wait.

890
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,600
- Is that the geyser?
- Yeah, that's where we're going.

891
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,100
Come on.

892
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,900
- Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?
- Not with skin on it.

893
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,900
He's too fast. We're not gonna make it.

894
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,100
- Trevor, what are you doing?
- That's muscovite.

895
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,500
Same thing that we fell through before.

896
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,500
There's no way it's gonna hold you.

897
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,000
It can't hold him either. Now you run.

898
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,900
Trevor, no.

899
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,800
It's not breaking, Trevor.

900
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,900
Keep running!

901
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,900
- He's gaining on you.
- I know.

902
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,200
Keep going.

903
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,900
Trevor, it's working.

904
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:18,000
Look out!

905
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,700
Trevor!

906
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,900
I just remembered something.
I hate field work.

907
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,200
Trevor, come on.

908
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,500
That was like... And then you were like...

909
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,900
Yeah, I know. I'm really lucky.

910
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,800
Okay, that way.

911
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,500
That, no good. That, worse.

912
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,200
Let's go.

913
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,700
The river.
How are we gonna get to the geyser?

914
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,000
- Water's boiling.
- We need something that floats.

915
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,800
Anything. I could use a log or...

916
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,200
What we really need is a boat.

917
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,100
Who had dibs again?

918
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,400
Come on, jump in.

919
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,700
- The best mountain guide on the planet.
- Got that right.

920
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,200
You didn't really think
you were gonna scare me away, did you?

921
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,100
You'll have to work harder than that.

922
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,900
I'm afraid I'll have to charge you extra
for this bit.

923
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,100
Can I open a tab?

924
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,300
What was that?

925
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,800
It's not good. That's the river bed.

926
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,800
We're running out of water.

927
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,600
Well, guys,
you might wanna hang on to something.

928
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:14,200
This ride is about to get a little bit...

929
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,100
Bumpy.

930
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,200
- Is everybody all right?
-Yeah.

931
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,300
Where are we?

932
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,300
What's that light down there?

933
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,000
That's lava.

934
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,200
It's magma, and it's rising.

935
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,600
There's supposed to be water in this tunnel.
Steam, water shooting up.

936
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,200
We're too late for the geyser,
we missed it.

937
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,800
- What do we do?
- Do you have any suggestions, professor?

938
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,100
Without water, no steam.
Without steam, we're not going anywhere.

939
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,800
This place looks like there hasn't been
water here in two, three hours now.

940
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
- But the walls are still wet.
- That's impossible, it's 130 degrees.

941
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,700
- Trevor. Behind you.
- What?

942
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,100
It is wet.

943
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,000
It's cold. There's water behind here.

944
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,100
There's gotta be water behind some pocket
or underground river.

945
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,600
Trevor, it's getting closer.

946
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,300
Hey, that's magnesium.

947
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,900
- We're slipping.
- How many flares you got left?

948
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,700
Three.
What do you wanna do with them?

949
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,700
Gonna light the magnesium. On purpose.

950
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,400
Hang on.

951
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,700
Oh, come on. It's too wet.

952
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,600
Got to get further down.
Give me another one.

953
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,300
Hold my legs.

954
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,600
Come on.

955
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,300
You're gonna have to tie me off.
I gotta get down lower.

956
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,000
Trevor, it's getting closer.

957
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,200
That's good. All right, ready.

958
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,800
It's the last one.

959
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,700
Trevor, be careful.

960
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,900
-How's that?
-Little more.

961
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,500
Hurry.

962
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,400
- Lower?
- Little more.

963
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,300
Okay, hold off.

964
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,700
- Come on.
-Come on.

965
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,700
- Come on, light.
-Come on.

966
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,600
Come on, Trevor.

967
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,300
Still wet. Gonna have to
throw it to the other side.

968
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,900
What?

969
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,500
No.

970
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,200
No!

971
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,400
Trevor, come on.

972
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,700
- Trevor, come on.
- It's lit, it's lit.

973
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,200
Pull!

974
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,600
- Pull me up.
- Hurry.

975
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,000
Pull me up. Pull me up.

976
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,300
-Come on, pull it. Pull it.
-Pull.

977
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,900
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.

978
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,100
Sean! Come on!

979
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,600
Get down, it's gonna blow.

980
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,400
This thing's heating up.

981
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,100
I know!

982
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,400
- Hang on!
- Trust me, I'm hanging on!

983
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,900
Is that sky?

984
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,400
Hang on, everybody!

985
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,900
- Stop saying that!
- It just keeps coming up!

986
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,900
That's Mount Vesuvius.

987
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,800
Hey, Sean, if your mom asks you
what you did this weekend...

988
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
-... you tell her Uncle Trevor took you to Italy.
- Italy?

989
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,200
Sean?

990
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,300
Sean?

991
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
What? I just took
a few geological samples.

992
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,400
A few geological samples?

993
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,000
A few pounds of samples, but what
do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.

994
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,500
Look. Look.

995
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,300
You take this.

996
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:16,500
You take. We are sorry.

997
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,600
You want slide again?

998
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,300
Slide is okay. It's fine.

999
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,700
Anything what you want.

1000
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,500
What was that for?

1001
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,700
Now we're even.

1002
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,200
Leonard, I'm back.
Stop doing what you're doing.

1003
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,200
What am I doing?

1004
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,200
Oh, look, you're looking for work.

1005
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,500
You don't need to,
because you have a job...

1006
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:10,300
...with the Ásgeirsson-Anderson Institute
for Tectonophysical Exploration.

1007
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,800
The Ásgeirsson-Anderson... What?

1008
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,500
Still working on the name.

1009
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:17,100
But the point is,
rising tide lifts all boats.

1010
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,900
Man, that's awesome.

1011
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,400
I think... Am I a boat?

1012
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,300
- You're a boat. We're back in business.
- All right, dude.

1013
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,000
Well, well, well.
What's all the excitement about?

1014
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,000
- Oh, hey, Alan. How are you?
-Good.

1015
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,800
- What you doing?
- Oh, me?

1016
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,300
I'm moving into my new lab.

1017
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,600
More importantly, where have you been?

1018
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,400
I heard you missed your Monday lecture
and both of your students complained.

1019
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,300
I took a quick vacation.
Best thing I could've done.

1020
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,600
That is exciting.

1021
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,000
You'll have to promise
to tell me about it, okay?

1022
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:52,200
<i>Not sure if I'll have time, but you can read
about it in Scientific American.</i>

1023
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,100
<i>Scientific American?</i>

1024
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,800
Look, I just want to say,
no hard feelings, okay?

1025
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,200
About the laboratory moving
and expansion thing.

1026
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,000
So I'm actually looking
for my own building anyway.

1027
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
How exactly
are you going to do that, Trevor?

1028
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,100
Well, let's just say
I fell into a small fortune.

1029
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,900
So tomorrow
you're gonna be a Canadian.

1030
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,400
Yep. Looks that way.

1031
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:26,100
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding
packed into very little time.

1032
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,700
What do you say
we take a couple weeks next time?

1033
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,500
A couple weeks?

1034
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,000
- What are you doing over Christmas break?
- Nothing. I'm free.

1035
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,300
I just found this in your dad's stuff.

1036
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,200
Give it a read.

1037
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,400
"Lost City of Atlantis. "

1038
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,200
We'll talk.

1039
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,400
Sean, what is that?

1040
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,300
- I'm just feeding my pet.
- What pet?

1041
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,400
Sean.

1042
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,100
- You think my mom will let me keep him?
- I don't know.

1043
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,400
Might not even stay here.

1044
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,500
- Look at it.
- Hey, come on.

1045
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,800
- This is your problem.
- Where are you going?

1046
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,000
I got some food for you.
Come on. Come back down here.

1047
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,800
Come on.
