INNOCENT



Carriage for Mr. Hermil



-Very good, Mr. Hermil - Thanks



- Here is your carriage, Sire - Thanks



Continue tomorrow. I must rush,
by now I am late. I must go



- agreed, tomorrow - tomorrow



Please?



On guard



I have not understood



Well yes, I said that for me the
coldness of English is a myth...



... pure invention - and
who would be the inventor?



- The Italians, perhaps - and
why invent such a thing?



- For envy - Indeed?  Why do you say that?



You don't say?



- Good evening - Good evening



- And how did it end, contessa?
- and he said endure or not



Is it tonight for her to sing Speranza?



- Not, next tuesday
- That's a pity, I shall not be there



- They say that she is extraordinary
- As singer or as woman?



I only mean of song



If the princess knew the little
invites that you come for music...



She knows very well they are
like a penance that inflicts us



We come here to court the
contessa Teresa Raffo...



... for penance Mozart, two
Schubert and four Liszt



- That appeals too - Good Evening,



Good evening, beloved



- What sin makes you arrives late
- The guilt is mine, princess



I am more than convinced



You missed a beautiful Liszt and Mozart.
Sit near me.



She interprets Chopin very well



I wanted to thank you,
princess, I have to leave



Go already?  That's too bad!



- She is an extraordinary pianist
- I think so



Goodbye



Where do you go?



Stay if you are with her



- I did not know that she would come
- Yes I know



Farewell.  Enjoy yourself



- Teresa, please - You come walk with me?



I cannot, you understand



you come out with me now, or this
is the last time that you see me...



... the last time, and I speak seriously



Tullio Beloved, don't forget that the
Princess invited him, if he goes



It does not matter to me, prince



I have an other festivity



- You want to tell Conte Egano
that I am waiting for him?



I will Contessa



It doesn't matter, here he is



Stefano Beloved!  I want to go early



Come, Tullio



I want to go back in before
the ossessa recommences



My wife takes much offense
if she does not see me...



... little enough to make them happy



Thanks



I will return to take you later



But, why?
- I will send back the carriage...



... I don't believe that I
will return, I am not well



I'll come with you
- Let's not complicate. Later



Come in



As you see I know you enough well...



... I knew that you would come



Ah, I would have preferred to wait
for you before leaving again...



... more rather than to risk
finding you on my return tonight



Give me the keys of the house



I could not come here come with you



My wife wanted me to accompany her
to the concert of her best friend



Why have you not told me that
you would have gone too?



I went just because I knew
that you would have gone



It was time for you to face the situation.
Don't you think?



Up to now you have succeeded,
with the ability of prestige...



... to not understand
things as they truly are



- and therefore I have taken the initiative
- What did you want to discover?



That I am married?  You have always known



- I accept - Then?



But from what you say, is
that much of the time...



... that the relationships between
you and your wife would be... formal



- So they are - Not true



Enough to see you together to see it



You are like all the bourgeois
husbands of this world, my beloved



You vow to the lover not to have
relationships with the wife...



... and to the wife swear
to not have a lover



Is it not mean, that denial



I am a free woman, really,
not only a word... like you



You are jealous of her?



I do not share a man with an other woman...



... even if she is his wife



You do not share me with
anyone, and you know



Do not think that I do not
have you within me, always



That presence is made felt
continuously, obstinate...



...even an enemy.



You must leave. You return to your wife.
You leave me



No, I do not leave you



You remain with me



- Still wide awake ?
- You had said that you were not well...



Stupid me , I was worried



I have opened the window one hundred
times in order to see you return



See what I was doing?  I was writing to you



But now that you are here...



Tomorrow I leave for Florence, I do
not know how long I will be away



This time is no laughing
matter, I must tell you



- You go forever?
- Forever. Such a large word



I feel, Giuliana...



... I have not never spoken
to you of it but I am sure...



... that some pious spirit will have
told you of my acts of infidelity to you



I have not spoken you of it because they



were not important and above
all because between us



...since the beginning is clearly a pact.
From our wedding



Love is hard until ...



... after become common affection,
esteem, friendship, interests...



Always that it is possible, clear



and therefore have been
because you have accepted...



... without to rebel to you, a
situation that exists from much time



Were history without
importance, like you say



for I have tried to ignore them,
do not give matter to us...



- For me marriage must...
- Yes, our marriage had...



... to be defended also
from own resentments



and you have reason.  You are extraordinary



although my love for you has...



... faded , as is fated to happen...



... the affection and the
respect I have only increased



I love you and I respect you..



... as the sweetest sister of
which I could not make less



I understand that you would
have the right to leave me...



... but I would suffer
much if you abandoned me.



I want you to continue living with me?
To help me?



To help you?  In what sense?



Support me.  To face a situation that...



...according to the ways of our
society, I would surely be criticized



- the woman who I love - Teresa Raffo



- Yes, Teresa - She is a widow, free...



... Then what prevents you living
with her, if you have want?



I have said to you that I love
Teresa, not that I want to marry her



She is a sensual woman, beautiful



I desire her



No woman has ever succeeded in
occupying me with herself... like she



But how would it be? I
arrive and she leaves.



Hey, anyone home?



Federico



- Tullio - Federico



I have three days of leave,
I arrive, and you leave?



No, I go alone



- Fortunate that you are here
- Must you go?



Truly...  How many leave days have you?



Three, three and half, exactly



I feel, I...



... I am in one situation...



... that I do not know how to define



I must leave and Giuliana remains alone



I do not want to martyr her, but...



... to only know that you
are here will calm me a lot



I want to pass the three days in
Rome, but not with my sister-in-law



- a delicious, adorable Creature...
- No, you can do what you want...



... To me it is enough to
know that you are here



Enough that in the evening before going
out, you step into her apartment



say hello and tell her what you do. She
will be content, it is a delicate gesture



You are the only tenant in this house?
From outside it seems therefore large



I will explain how they happen, if
it will not disappoint you too much



I promised to show them one of the
most beautiful houses in Rome and...



I did not say that it is not beautiful,
is very beautiful, only that...



Not, it is not beautiful



This villa was made to
instructions of my mother...



... wanted trees around...



... to see the green even
if we were in cities



My father did all in order to please her...



... but, died he, my mother returned to
Badiola, the house in the country...



... where there are many more
trees, much more green than here



When my brother married, he
came here here with his wife...



... I have held for me these three
rooms, I am really independent



Then this is not truly your house



Yes, yes, this is true also I assure you



Federico!  Federico!



Giuliana, what has happened? What
happens to you, Giuliana? answer



Please, help me



- I go to call the doctor
- Wait here, Gentleman



She has not passed out.
Must have taken something



is nobody at home, you are alone?



Not, they already have
gone to sleep except me



I was depressed and I have taken
something in order to sleep



and instead calming me...



... it brought anguish, fear...



- I did not want to remain alone
- We are here, how do you feel?



- It is nothing, I am stupid - Feel better?



Yes, better



Forgive me for having disturbed you



Do not raise you



This is my friend Filippo
D'Arborio, he is a writer...



... you do not think that you
had such important friends, eh?



Ulterico Vinicci



Signora Elviretta, my
sister-in-law Giuliana



- Good evening



I ask excuse all...... I
have ruined your supper...



... return to table,
- You cannot remain alone, this evening



Come



When you have to sleep as I say...



... or, you can sleep here,
rocked from our voices



- When I was intern with Filippo...
- You were in college together!



I was a poor boy...



... my family did not have
sufficient means for me to study



I lived in college, in a room
by reputation the smallest



- next to which there was Federico
- He went to sleep before me always



Just so, as soon as I began to
speak he fell asleep. Perhaps



... it was the tone of my voice
that produced this effect



it would appeal to me that also this time
it would succeed in making her sleep



breakfast is served



What scent!



They are lillies?



In this season?  How you have found them?



How kind !



They are from, it appears, Stefano Egano



How can you allow that imbecile?



It's not good to read the letters of others



You are being foolish...



... if I have wanted someone,
I would be with him, not you



I did promise to go to see
his horses race at Cascine



and instead I am here with you



Are you complaining?



I hoped to see you yesterday at the races



my horses won prizes



There are too many people, I have had fear



Tomorrow are the steeplechases



I have two horses entered. I can
make them to have the major places



I'm afraid that will not be possible for me



In case you change your mind...



I can assure you that Contessa
Raffo will not change her mind



- I would like to talk to the contessa
- I explain to you, that's enough



If you change your mind...



She is busy



Of course



Many friends of Egano say
that he has returned to Rome



and also it seems



She has broken with Tullio.
You have done well to come



Forget those that make comments.
They do not commiserate with you



Do not accept the role of the
betrayed and abandoned wife



You are here in order to
demonstrate to contrary



I hoped to arrive on time
to say not coming...



... would have certainly come ..



...but my train was delayed



While I fought with some idiot in
Florence, she left saying nothing



she wants to see again
the cost of a scandal



She is a liar, false, unseizable



In the moment that you feel
she is yours, she escapes



You already feel that I am
chasing other fantasies



I must find the strength to make
it finish, not to see her anymore



and you must help me.



- What I can do?
- I do not know, many things



To remind me of my purpose not
to see her more, to convince me



Nobody can less convince you than me



Not true



The most dangerous thing is the
desperation which I find, that makes...



... me feel therefore unhappy but at
the same time renders me alive, vital



This is the first time that I find
myself in a situation as this



It is true that a man ends by
selling his soul for his youth



and then finds himself
in love without defense



You talk as if I never existed



You have reason, I am unjust. Excuse
you must have patience with me...



... like with a sick



sick one that felt sorry
for it's own disease



- Was it you singing?  - Yes



- You go out?  - Yes.



- Where are you going?
- To the auction of Di-Castro



I do not succeed to pin
my veil, help me, please?



Thanks



You have a new scent?  What is?



Crab-apple, an English scent



La Fiamma



To Giuliana Hermil, Turris
Eburnea dishonourably I offer...



... Filippo D' Arborio - You do not leave?



- Do you know D'Arborio?  - Yes



- I did not know, from when?
- Your brother introduced me to him.



- Have you read it?
- Yes, I have leafed through some pages



He is a mediocre writer...



... does he not seem to you?  - No



He has a haughty, emphatic style ...



... insufferable
- How can you talk like that?



He has an extraordinary style,
bewitching to me, like music



you cannot judge an artist
having read only a few pages



You take him to heart!



He may be a great writer, like you
say, but he is badly educated...



... this I will acknowledge to you



The dedication that he has written
to you is not only emphatic...



... but also inopportune if it
is believed that it is meant...



...for a lady met a single time



I have seen him other times
since Federico introduced me



Take the carriage?



No, I prefer to walk



See you later



I have seen all



4500 Liras and 4500 Liras twice



- Contessa Raffo, compliments!  - Thanks



Now a pin in dove shape.
Diamonds, rose and rubies



Value estimated at 5-6000
we start from 1000 for this



1000, 1100, 1400, 1600...



... 2000, 2200 mrs.



2400, 2800, 3000...



... 3500 here in bottom, 4000 in
front of the bench, 4500 the mrs....



... 5000 here.  I feel the room heating up



Good evening, Mr. Hermil.
6000, I adjudicate to 6000...



6500, 7000, 7500.  It makes it appeal to



8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 11000



Selling for 11000, 11000 and
one and two, 11000... sold!



Now for auction a beautiful fashionable
bracelet, of most recent invoice...



... with more than one hundred diamonds
and sapphires, mounted in platinum



Estimated 10000.  Start with 1000



Who offers more? Thousands, thousand
Liras, two thousand, two thousand Liras



-Good evening my lady - Good evening Emilio



- Mr. Tullio is at home?
- No, my lady, he has gone out



Tell the kitchen that I
have already had supper



- Good night - Good night , my lady



I have passed entire nights
downstairs, watching your windows



I know,  I have seen you



and you have not called me



Why are you so cruel to me?



You are one of those men made to suffer



Egoist, proud...



... controlling, and master of love



If you knew how much it has
cost to me to resist...



... to want to call to you



But they have succeeded...



... so you had to come to seek for me today



But I did not seek for you today



I was at home



- it is not true - Yes, I swear to you



I was at home from where I did not leave



My wife has said me that she
went to the auction, and then...



That was what your wife said?



But she was not there, I assure you



I did not have anything to do,
and arrived half an hour early



I , that arrives everywhere late



I saw all enter, one by one



Oh God, I ruined it



Your wife does not say the
truth to you, she deceives you



perhaps she has a lover



Sorry, I joke



I have only seen people that were within



... and I have not seen
those that arrived after



Not after I had seen you



- Good evening, Sir - My wife has returned?



Yes, an hour ago, but then she has left



She made to take the train at 20:30



She said that she went to see
your mother in the Badiola...



... I believe she has
left a note in the study



Mr.Hermil, is waiting



He is the only punctual roman,
I introduce Filippo D' Arborio



- Tullio Hermil - D'Arborio



- Do you make an academic bout?
- If it appeals



- Yes - Please



Blades in line?  Salute



Mask...



...on guard



Gentlemen, to it



Tell me if I have done well



Who do you want next to you at table?



To right Prince Fondi, who
you prefer on the left?



But I do not know



- That book  appeals to you?  - No



To me, yes. And also the
person who has written it



I had invited him this
evening, but he is not in Rome



D'Arborio?



I will see what will remake his
life, as soon as he returns



I will organize another evening, I
want you to get to know each other



- I know him, thanks
- So how can I have known that?



- You are in a bad humor?  - Not at all



Then, give your approval to
me for the table places?



Do not forget that we must give an
answer this evening to Dampierre



What do you say? Are we
going to Paris or not?



It was you that was invited



I'll go if you come also



How many things you want me to do? To
give a lunch to D'Arborio, travels...



To become a bachelor again and give to me



I am here, the ambassador to my
right and Dampiere on the left...



... Good?  - Yes, its good...



I have put Dampierre close to
me to talk about next week...



...if we will go to Paris with them - OK



Thanks



Tullio



- How are you, Giuseppe?  - Well, thanks



- Tullio, beloved - Mother, how are you?



You are all alike, you arrive all
at once when one least expects you



- and Giuliana?
- Well, also she waited for you



Where is Mrs. Giuliana?  - In the garden



Go to call her. Tell her please
that Mr. Tullio has arrived



Yes, my lady.



How is Giuliana? How
does she spend her days?



- Fortunately she has friends - Friends?



Her friends from Rome are
staying with the Torrigiani...



... Giuliana says that they
are likeable persons...



... and therefore at least pass the time.
I never do go out, I see nobody



I have said to her to invite who she
wants, but in order not to disturb,



Giuliana goes out



It will be a beautiful surprise
for her to find you here



- I find You well - I was not expecting you



To tell the truth, not even I wait for you



I was at the station, I had
already a ticket for Paris...



... Then I saw a train that came
here and I have changed my route



I know that Tullio was a little
crazy, but until this point



Wait



Will it displease you if he
occupies a room in the left wing?



Tullio reads until late and
keeps me wide awake...



... therefore in order not to disturb
each other we sleep in separate rooms



As you want, there are many rooms



Take them there please



- You want tea?  - No, thanks



Thanks



Ever been to Villalilla?
- No, I never go there



- Like never?  - We have not been



We will have to speak about Villalilla



There is a former English diplomat who is
in love with it and it wants to buy it



I said that an optimal
transaction could be made...



... but I am contrary to sell it.
I should rent it but



Think how much that costs ourselves...



... when just married you
said that you wanted



to live there six
months of the year...



I have never thought of us there



If I rent it we recover
expenses of maintenance



uninhabited houses suffer
depreciation before time



Think about it. I do
not speak for interest



For me it will be always your house



Mother is right, for less I
would have to go to see it



If tomorrow you do not have
other engagements, I will go



Welcome Sir.  Welcome Mrs.



Hello, Callisto



Give a drink to the horses



and also a little graze



For fifteen days I open the windows
to give air to the house...



... I knew that the
gentleman was at Badiola



I have been late to come, because
I waited for that time, so..



Do you have to do like you told your mother



Rent it



Yes, would be the more reasonable thing



If the diplomatic Englishman would take it



I would be sorry



Are you not very well?



You have the same air,
halting and afraid...



... of before the time that we have come



here were the same flowers, same scent



Yes, it was the same season



Try to be two new persons,
at their first encounter



Depend only on us...



... if we do not succeed we
will return to our unhappiness



... to our miseries



It is not possible, do not torment me



Because? You are my wife, my sister...



... but you are never my lover



love is not just this... above all this



and I have not never taught you...



... has been guilt mine, has mistaken



Tell me that you want to
make love with me, tell me



Tell me that you want me also, tell me



I began to think you stayed,
I wanted to send someone



How goes it?



- You want me to accompany you?
- No, thanks



Hello, mother



Giuliana is not well, I wanted to
remain, but she did not want to



- She is ill?  - Nothing serious...



a light malaise, perhaps
she has caught a chill



You are right when you say that it
is a sin to leave the villa empty



But not for the English diplomat,
we would go to live there....



... at least some months of the year



- But...
- Yes... I know you don't believe me



... But you should see. It
was there beautiful today...



... The scent of the lillies
will be why Giuliana felt ...



...a little unwell, the
scent went to her head



I will go to tell Giuliana to
remain in bed, it is prudent



I will get the doctor to come quickly



I wanted to get him to come last
week, but Giuliana did not wish it.



Giuseppe will not have detached
the gig yet, tell himi to go for



... Doctor Milani, it will
please me if he comes tonight



Calm, calm, mother, you are
exaggerating without need



... Giuliana is well, you
worry about nothing.



Giuliana has forbidden
me to speak to you of...



... until we were sure, but
by now there are no doubts...



... and I will speak to you of it ...



... why she does not ride
the gig for that journey



Giuliana is pregnant



- Pregnant ?  - Yes



She has told you?



No, I have worked it out. She has
had many malaises, like today...



... Nausea, dizziness, insomnia,
the things that you imagine...



... I have asked. She has said to
me that perhaps she was pregnant...



... but wanted to be sure of
it before speaking with you...



... in order to not deceive you and
to not disappoint you, naturally



I myself recommended she see the doctor...



... because even if I tell her to take
precautions, she does not believe me



She will be in the third month. But you,
do not betray me, wait for her to tell you



I have asked for this
with much insistence...



I am so happy!



I have yearned for this moment!



Now we must be prudent, the first
months are most dangerous...



... above all for her, she is so  delicate,



Beloved, our beloved creature



Goodnight mother.  I go to sleep



If Giuliana is awake, I hear it



Yes, did you see the doctor?



If Giuseppe had found him ,
he already would have arrived



- If you have need of something
- No, thanks, goodnight



Tullio...



...do not go away, I fear to be alone



you have taken something in order to sleep?



Tullio, you have slept here all night?



- What has happened? - you have
asked to me to remain here



I?  When?



You do not remember?



I had taken a sleeping pill...



... perhaps more than usual



Since when do you take sleeping pills?
The doctor knows it?



Yes



- Show me what you take
- I do not remember where I have put it



I waiting



I believe..



... I have finished all and I
have thrown out the bottle



Is it true what my mother has said to me?



That you are pregnant?



Yes, it's true



I wanted to tell you. I tried
to say it to you at Villalilla



- For this you left Rome?
- Yes, but still I did not know



- and he has followed you
here - followed? Who?



We were already all ended
before I came here...



... before I knew that I was...



... so.  I had found the strength...



... to overcome the loss.  I was alone, sad



I do not want to justify
myself, or to accuse to you



I was deprived of hope, so desparate



But I came after, you rather...



That which I have always said
for me, were worth also for you



We  are two friends, two free persons



At least you could...



It would have not been in order to reclaim
a right, but I never thought to have



I swore fidelity to you for always



For you it was different...



... but I...



There is one thing that I want to know



And it is uniquely important



Our life until now does
not interest me anymore



In these last days I have
returned from you many changes



- and yesterday at Villalilla...
- I pray to You... You I pray



I felt I have found you again and I
believed that you were agreed ...



... that it would have been beautiful
to recommence all from the beginning



For a moment I believed that
all that had happened...



... was that not a dream, a nightmare



It was you and I, like when we just married



You are sincere?



Nobody must suspect anything



Why?



You want that I remain with you?



Yes



I see that you are wide awake



I came to tell you that I am enrolled
in the international championship



I have need of your help. You will not
want that I dishonour the family?



I will have to be at least well placed.
You will come down?



- I'll catch up to you soon.
Good day, Giuliana



Good day, Federico



Touche, Bravo



Why do you not go you to the
championship in my place?



You still fence beautifully



In guard, Tullio



Calm boys, be careful



What are you doing?  Are you crazy?



Not right, tell me what's happened



Not now, I am tired



Boys now enough!



The doctor is with Giuliana .
If you want to speak to him,



All is good



But he wants Giuliana to
remain in bed some days...



... is more prudent. So, he
will talk to you. You go!



No, I am sweating, I want to change...



... I would make him wait
for me, make my excuses



It is useless to pretend



As you can yourself imagine,
mother has told me already



I am really happy. Also because therefore
she will stop tormenting me...



... to marry



An heir has been assured. Congratulations



Do you allow me to speak
them also to Giuliana?



Best not now



Better Mother had kept quiet.
Giuliana is not well



It is probable that she will not
carry this pregnancy through



But the doctor?  What does he feel?



There was another time, when
Giuliana was pregnant...



... a little after we were married...



... said that all was good



and it did not go at all well



If you left suddenly, against
the advice of the doctor well,



... my mother would make a tragedy.
Therefore



you will remain
here for some days



I meanwhile will go to Rome to
speak with Professor Magli...



... and to prepare all



However I will have to ask some details...



- In what month are you?
- I have ended the second...



... a few days ago



For how much of it I know,
it is not still dangerous...



... if  due precautions are taken



I do not understand



My love, you do not want to
carry the pregnancy ahead?



you have already had a miscarriage...



... and that will make a
second pass unnoticed



I speak for my mother, my brother and
for all those that I know already



To professor Magli I know what I must say



But I cannot



- you cannot what?  - I cannot



Because you cannot? Why you have
fear or because you do not want?



I cannot because it is a crime



A crime?



How can you think that I...?



While you can calmly give my name,...



... my affection to a stranger



This for you is not a crime?



Why do you not answer



I have said that I want to help you



I love you and I do not have
rancour for what you have done



I am grateful to you, very grateful, but...



But what?



you have said that is history...



... those refusals, that you
do not want to remember



are not true, because
if therefore it were...



... as you can think that...?
- Impossible, in fact. I recognize



I must always allow you.



Giuliana , the true crime
is what you want to commit



Before the remorse of having been
with another man torments you



... But of this guilt you
acquit yourself alone...



... and begin to torment to you instead for
the consequences of the relationship...



... and conditions acquittal with such
a hard punishment all the life...



... not only for you. You see
the absurdity of your behavior?



I am atheist...



... That does not mean that I do
not have moral problems, indeed



I face them with full knowledge
of all that it involves



Because I do not delegate to divinity
the decision of what is right



I Assume awareness of the responsibility...



... I know that my sins if sins I have...



... are not redeemed with repentance...



... or the inflicting  of punishments



I am a free man



the earth is my single country
because it does not live temporarily



my story begins and ends here...



... I do not have a hell to fear...



... neither heaven in which to hope



Secondly we can only count on ourselves



that is not a comfortable
solution that I propose to you...



... a solution that faces the
truth of the existence...



... that it is not
sheltered in the faith...



... of a God manifactured
from our fantasy...



... and of another life that
assigns the prize or pain



If I could think like you...



... to have your security



To live in fundamental freedom...



... without fears



Reflect, it is for you to decide



However, tomorrow I go to to you Rome
and I arrange all as I have said



You come after me soon



you must do me a favour



you must let me meet your
friend Filippo D'Arborio



and I must go to Rome for this?



If you write a letter, he will
be happy to come, we are friends



He will run, with the hope
of seeing Giuliana again



They met one evening at my house
and was as if struck by lightning



when he took her for a walk...



I do not want to invite him, I want...



... to see him at your house.
You invite him



and I will visit your house



It is a delicate matter which
I cannot explain to you



The mistake is mine. With this
warmth, we said to ourselves...



... that the gentleman will
not come back for sure



and since there was need, one
covered up downstairs...



... to make to beat the carpets,
therefore I have thought...



I want you to replace them



In about a week Madam arrives



- Who is in house? - the
cook, Virginia, Alfredo...



Sir has instructions?



Like?



Ah yes, I have need someone
to deliver a telegram



I will send the coachman
or if you want, I will go



OK I call when it's ready



Then?



I would have caught up to You, as I wrote
to you and as I have telegraphed to you...



Not even for a moment I have thought
that you would be returned so soon



you are contradicting yourself



you had thought of us



In fact today you have sent the
waiter here, then to Paris



I was not in anxiety, I did not have
your news, before I started my journey



You want to make me believe



... that you wanted truly
to catch up to me to Paris?



- No - you see?  I have done good to return



I believe that the truth never
does not say itself to four eyes



So many factors takes part in
the intimate relations, and...



... most times nothing is understood more



- But to understand what?
- That for you it is finished, my beloved



Time for the truth...



...  soon



It is not beautiful for a woman to be left



There are those ready companions
and they do not appeal to me



There are those that will put
in doubt her fascination



and this does not please me



You sent me a note when I was
already on the train, saying...



... that serious transactions of family...



Not even an employee of the land
registery would use such little words



has sincerely believed, to a catastrophe



I wanted to go to Paris, yes,
in order to amuse myself



I arrived in Paris and I
have not even unpacked



I am returned immediately, I
thought that you had problems...



... you would intend to have come to me



my friends will laugh for sure...



... when I will tell the
history to them of my defeat



What you say ? You still want
to have supper together?



As you prefer



- No compliments - Please, Teresa...



... You are only person in the world to
which I will perhaps be able to say...



has left me. I hope that there
is not another day, for us



Good evening.  I ask to excuse



My brother Federico, Contessa Raffo



Contessa. Osvaldo has said
to me that you were here



You are upset.  Insomnia,near enough



I have gone to do what you know,
but have not found my friend



I did not seen him again
before he left for the field



I did not know not even that he
had gone to Africa. In Africa,



to do what? Now he is found
in isolation in hospital



He has been taken by a very serious disease



also you perhaps know my friend



- writer Filippo D' Arborio
- I was introduced to him



I am one of his admirers



He is between life and
death, they have said to me



The truth is that they understand
nothing of tropical diseases...



... To the danger of the disease add
that too many do not know how to cure it



Sad news



I am sorry to be bearer of these... indeed



Come to me when you go



We will meet tomorrow, too late tonight



You come to me, I will wait for you
- As you wish



Good night



Know what I say to you?



I suffer less than how much you believed



Perhaps will come a day I will
listen what you have to tell me



What's happening?



- Nothing - What nothing?



the door was open . You said
to me to come to any hour



Ah yes, I wanted...



... I wanted to know in what
hospital is D'Arborio recovering



In the Policlinico block, they
do not allow approach to anybody



Now you must explain to
me what you want from him



When you asked me to know it...



... I do not hide to you
that I have thought



you feared that there was
something between...



... D'Arborio and Teresa Raffo



Logical , in as much as all the
gentlemen of Rome of are in love



On the other part, your Teresa Raffo,
without offenses, of course...



... are not at all type to refuse a whim



and instead nothing. They are
informed to me, who meet her



She has seeen only you...



... did not know not
even that you were sick



and so?  What are all these mysteries?



I cannot tell you anything



Is a issue that regards a personal friend



Beh, I go to sleep, day is made, by now



at least tell me when...



... when he has left for Africa



I inquire myself, but advise
your friend to leave it in peace



D'Arborio is ill, very ill. He
is a man who deserves respect



He is not only a great
writer also he is an angel



the only person , thinking next
to which I have a sense of shame



because?



It is those thoughts makes
us understand us, even you



We are intelligent, we have
travelled, we have studied...



... we amuse ourselves well
therefore, we are rich...



... and then?
- That piffle you are saying?



I do not know even that.  Goodnight



At what time are we going to the circle?
You must fight me again



I do not know



I do not know what happens tomorrow



- Goodnight - Goodnight



Good day. Mrs. Giuliana has
need of lighter clothes...



... and has sent me to take them.
The weather is warm in Badiola



mrs. has not said to you that she will
come in the next few days to Rome?



No, Sir



My excuses, my head!



These are from Mrs.



I have some jobs to do
on behalf of your mother



I hope to be able to leave this evening,
if the gentleman has instructions...



No, not anything, I will arrive before



I cannot do what you ask me



I prefer to go, to disappear
from your life...



... but I cannot commit a crime



- I have spoken about it also ...
- With who have you spoken of it ?



With my priest



Has it been him that advised
you to go through with it?



He approves of it, but he has let me decide



I hope that he will help to
give my name to the child



and why not its father?



He does not know anything
neither must he know it



Is that true or do you say words?



you know what it will happen
if you decide to leave me?



It is not important to me, none
of the scandal, that's very clear



But your situation as a single woman...



... that has deceived to save its
child depriving it of father



Be sure that your decision is
dictated only from yours...



... religion, or morals,
call them as you want...



... if I felt you were mine only mine...



... I could support anything



the sons are of him who
educates them and raises them



Hello?  Good day madam, it is nine o'clock



Come, come, I'm wide awake



have you seen it



It was known in Rome that
he was seriously sick



You have nothing to  say?  strange



What!



I would have sworn you
would have said about it



One disease taken in Africa?



Why you do not look at me?



What are you thinking?



Why do you torment yourself



Here is the doctor



I'll go meet him



Good evening, is the
obstetrician here already?



Yes



Come with me doctor



The doctor has come, the doctor!



- He comes at last, - doctor.
I must say one thing



and want to declare it
in presence of my mother



the last time that you visited my wife...



... you said to me that an
alternative could be introduced



It is very clear, and I assume
all the responsibility for it...



... that if this unfortunate
circumstance were to occur...



... we want to save the life of the mother



I hope that we will not face this choice



We are grateful however of being
exempt from all responsibility



- I know that the catholic religion...
- I know. No there is no need



It is an immoral, criminal law.
I do not regard it



Come doctor



Breaths



Good, long breaths



Calm



So , good



Mr. Tullio!  Mr. Tullio!



Mr. Tullio!  Mr. Tullio it's a boy



he has already opened his eyes



here safe and sound both.  we have done



Compliments.  A most beautiful child



All has gone well



Go also to the Madam, but do
not let anybody enter the room



She had a fleeting crisis. She
is well, but she is very weak



It is nothing, do not worry.



Yes, insomnia has one curious
psychical reaction...



... do not want to see the child, cry



How beautiful! God bless him



Raimondo, Raimondo, of grandmother



Tell the truth! he is not the most
beautiful child of the world?



Look at the eyes, I pray you make
a good impression of your uncle



Don't cry, treasure. Nothing
but to eat and to sleep



Look at the hands. It comes high, eh?
But how beautiful ,eh?



Like all the babies. The
foals distinguish themselves



- You saw what has been born to Zara - Beh?



Gray silver, one splendor.  But a child...



you say that in order to make me angry.
What do you know of children?



When you had been born you were most ugly.
Red, wrinkled...



... you were not at all like he.



Talk to Tullio, instead of making humour



You must say: Tullio your son
is as beautiful as the sun



- That must say I?  - Yes



Nanny, you close the windows against
the cold, it is an ugly day



You have fear of saying to him that
the foal is better than Raimondo?



Don't worry, Mother. I will say
that never has a wonder similar



been seen and that he is
proud of coming from father



Who is?



You joke, but I am deprived
of hope, deprived of hope



- But what do you say?
- But you do not have any idea



I do not take with Giuliana why
she has told the doctor...



... it was the reaction
to the state of tension



But your brother! So strange!



Before he was taking care for
her, and can understand it...



... but now that all has gone well



Do you know that he never
looked at the child?



Like if it did not exist,
nor even speak of it



only thing that your brother
has known tells me..



... is that if we want to christen
it, we do it on our behalf...



... without receptions, nothing



you had made me scared, that's all?



You know that Tullio is not religious.
He has his ideas



You want to say that the reception
we will make on an other occasion



- You care about this?  - Yes, a lot



and above all



Always blocks from him about that...
Hostile



But no, these are good news



For a while we will not have
the trouble of reception



and then Tullio and Giuliana
come to agreement...



... and are forgotting
even they have a son.



On, then all will be well



Tullio will come into church,
good like when he married



and Raimondo, it is decided that
Raimondo he will be called?



Your crazy husband has has decided
to make mother deprived of hope



It was better if you did not come, if you
had to make that apparition from devil



I have said to mother and the nanny to
come to drink a little champagne...



... therefore calm down



Are champagne,  not holy water



Come in



Oh!  Bravo, come, come



No, not here, go



Giuliana must not be made tired.
You go also



Let's go, Federico



Indeed, does it not please you if
we are here with you, Giuliana?



The doctor has said that if you can move
little, the effort would do you good



Come, make an effort



-Come away, Federico - For me



Go on, see you later



I want to prepare a beautiful
christmas to make peace with mother



You have some ideas



Do not count on me, I won't be here



So? You do not remain
here for the festivities?



Mother has told me for sure



I am sorry to disappoint her
but I have changed my mind



I do not make it



There is an atmosphere here,
than does not appeal to me



I wish well to all, but
I too have my problems



and I need to pass the few days
leave that I have peacefully



I will celebrate elsewhere



He has fed



I hoped to find him awake



He is well covered? It seems
to me that he has cold hands



- Shall we put his mittens on?
- No, no, Madam, do not worry



...he is beautifully warm



He is fast asleep, do not have fear



It is soothing for children
to hear our voices...



... to know that are not alone



I am going to sleep also , goodnight



Goodnight, Madam.



Nights I spy on you and that
I see you goto cosset it



Scream to the four winds
what you want , do not lie



have at least the courage to say truth



I have come here because
I seemed to feel a call



This has happened other times to me



I seem to feel a call as
if something had happened



It is not true, you were seen also
when you get up hidden in the dark...



... trying not to make noise
- What bad have I done?



Also you come here in the
night, the nanny has told me



It's true, it's true



But it is not the same thing



I try to discover your
secret by watching you



I try to overcome, to forget.
But I do not succeed!



Cursed be the day on which
I accepted this torture



You are not the same as when he is there.
You are happy!



So why do I not satiate
myself here to watch



and you are not the cure for my suffering



You I do love, and loving him
you think and love his father



You know that is not true



I have even wished that
he died when he was born



That is horrible, but is so



Also I feel anguish in his presence



Yes, I also hate him for the
suffering he brings to me



You cannot see that, why
do you not believe me?



It's true, I hate him.  I swear



You think thus?



Yes, because he has been put between us...



... and I would want that you and I...



Let's go away. We will
be happy away from here



We will leave after Christmas.
I promise you



Mother is downstairs.  We go to mass



- Fine. I will wait for to you here
- Your cape, madam.



Take that away.  You do not wear my gift?



It does not seem the right
event, it is too opulent



Nonsense, it pleases the peasants
to see their masters well dressed.



The bells have already played twice Madam!



We must hurry. - I am coming



Nanny, you can go to mass if you want.
I remain here



Thank you, Sir. I will go.
The child is fast asleep.



Goodnight, Sir.  Happy Christmas



Goodnight



Giuseppe, serve supper immediately



Of course,Madam...Immediately



and so this Christmas is passed



and we will leave here, as we have promised



After Christmas, but when?



When you want, tomorrow even



- Madam!  Madam!  - What is it?



- Come. The child does not breathe
- My God!



He does not breathe!  My God !?



Oh my God !  Oh my God!



I do not want you to go in there



Why?



Stay with me, I am so afraid.



Come



Mr. Hermil, Mr. Hermil!



No!  It is not true!  It is not true!!



He is dead?



Yes



Get off, do not touch me



- I am not your accomplice
- Be quiet, Giuliana, I beg you



- It is you
- Why do you say this? You knew all



The guilt is yours, yours. I hate you



Not, you have also said you hate him



No, I wanted to save him, with
all my strength, from you



- All I have done in order to save him
- But what are you saying



Yes, everything I have done with you,
I have only done in order to save him



and now, and for the rest of my days...



... I will have to living
with this sin on my spirit



My God, help me!



It will make you as unhappy as I am Tullio



You lie to yourself . You
have always wished him to die



Not even a moment have I
wished to be free of him...



... because I loved him



My poor creature, a thousand
times I disown those words



And well that you know that , therefore
you will understand that it is all ended



I have loved and I will love
always the father of that creature



Until the end of my days, you
I can only hate, hate...



... and despise you



Is extraordinary, the
faculty that women have ...



... to adapt the truth to the romantic
ideals of the worst literature



The adventure of my wife with
Filippo D'Arborio lasted...



..the time of a sigh



So like many of your friends have said...



...it would have been whimsy
of our fashionable writer...



... that it has been his fate to catch
a horrendous disease in Africa...



... that he has paid respect to his creator



All here. I am sorry to
only have contributed ...



... to supply elements for
this pessimistic serial



They will not think that really



it would have been you to have
caused the death of that innocent?



I do see it as strange when



a newly born child has...



... extraordinary resistance. It
takes more than the cold to kill it



And therefore, do not make remorse



If he is dead, it is sure
because it had one...



No, that does not have importance



What more concerns me are
the intentions that drive



and in my intentions there
are no possible doubts



I have I acted with perfect
clarity of conscience...



I do not have remorse,
I am not justifying it



The justice of men does
not touch me because



... no court on earth will
be able to convict me



I have bored you?  Sorry



Is still early.  We still can be together?



you would give me great pleasure



Your house pleases me



You know how many times I
have tried to imagine it...



... without ever succeeding



It's strange, because it is similar



Indeed



- With all that which is in you
- so beautiful... and so ugly



What is there ugly.  What we feel



slowly without haste



I must watch well...



... and to reflect



- you offer me something to drink?  - Sure



So?  You have decided?



What is ugly in me?



You want me to tell you



let me drink



I should not. I have drunk
a lot with supper...



you have put to Me a lot of...



... melancholy



Give me another



A little ago you have asked to me what
I thought about what you have told me



Now I say to you



I think you will always
be in love with your wife



Enamoured to make pity



That is not my spirit.



I admit I have had, in these past months...



... a drunken, clouded
experience, if you want morbid



Only pure ones are capable of such excesses



Think of the life of ascetics



You are still enamoured of her



Since the first time you were defeated



you are still fighting...



... because he has died.



Poor Tullio



But that nonsense you say?



If there is one defeated in
this lugubrious history...



... It is my wife



she that decides to live with
the ghosts of the cemetaries...



... instead of living her life freely



Refusing to believe



... that our problems are
resolved on the earth...



... and not in a hypothetical afterlife



I instead am what I am



Without illusions, without repentances



The day in which I will no
longer have pleasure for life...



... no curiosity...



... I would make an end of it.



There are those that say



instead when the moment comes
in which you stop living...



... you are only begun to exist



But if of it we do not explain



and if unfortunately we do not notice it...



... we hope for eternal life



That is not my case,  I swear



What do you know of it? It will
always be the same for you



and instead we know nothing of what



the future reserve us



Not even a little



... crazy with desire and jealousy



I committed many platitudes...



In order to suffocate my love for you



Goodness knows because you men...



... with one hand us you want
to always raise us to stars...



... and with the other drag us down?



Why do you not let us walk beside you?



Creature beside creature,
woman beside her man



None more, none less



Sure



I have decided to live with you...



Live with me?



But I do not love you more treasure



You are a monster



Not for what you have told me this evening



Further, that is not the
natural conclusion of all



You are the most attractive man who
has never held me in his arms...



... But if one day you persuaded me
of being the arbitrator of my life...



... I would not want to feel dishonourable



Now leave me Tullio



What happens if I lived here?



You sleep?  Perhaps



I have drunk too much



Do not sleep.  I beg You



Impossible.  I must sleep



Do not sleep, Teresa



I want to make you to see
that I know how to finish
