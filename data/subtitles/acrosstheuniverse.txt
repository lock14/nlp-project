1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,300
<i>Is there anybody
Going to listen to my story</i>

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>All about the girl who came to stay</i>

3
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
<i>She's the kind of girl
You want so much</i>

4
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,900
<i>It makes you sorry</i>

5
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>Still you don't regret a single day</i>

6
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
<i>Hold me tight</i>

7
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,600
<i>Tell me I'm the only one</i>

8
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,200
<i>And then I might</i>

9
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,500
<i>Never be the lonely one</i>

10
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,200
<i>So hold me tight</i>

11
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
<i>Tonight</i>

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
<i>Tonight</i>

13
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,100
<i>It's you</i>

14
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,300
Who will take me out next week?

15
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,100
You'll be halfway around the world.

16
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, it better not be Phil Scully.

17
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Come here.

18
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll be back soon.

19
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,200
They give you a furlough
after boot camp.

20
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
And after that?

21
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,500
- Yeah. All right.
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

22
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,100
All right, then.

23
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,900
Don't spend it all at once.
Last one for a while, eh, son?

24
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,600
- Last one ever, Cyril.
- I felt the same at your age.

25
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,600
I told myself, "When I'm 64,
I'll be long gone from this place."

26
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,800
- But I'm still here.
- Move it along.

27
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,500
Some of us are thirsty and
the pubs have been open five minutes.

28
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,500
Hi, Charlie.

29
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,700
You're gonna miss this place.

30
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Don't count on it, Phil.

31
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,500
I've ironed your best shirts.

32
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I'll be shoveling coal in a furnace,
Mum. I don't think I'll be wearing them.

33
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,400
You'll be wearing them
when you go ashore in America.

34
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,300
Yeah, well, that could be
months from now.

35
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
If you wanted a seafaring life...

36
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,700
couldn't you have
signed up for the Mersey Ferry?

37
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,800
At least you'd be home
for your supper every night.

38
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,400
I sometimes feel
you're not telling me everything.

39
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
I just need a break
from the yard, Molly.

40
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,800
I'll be back before you know it.

41
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,500
Or do you need a break from me?
Is that what this is about?

42
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,500
Come here.

43
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,000
<i>Close your eyes and I'll kiss ya</i>

44
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,200
<i>Tomorrow I'll miss ya</i>

45
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
<i>And remember I'll always be true</i>

46
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,100
- Pull the other one.
- What?

47
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,200
<i>And then while I'm away</i>

48
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,600
<i>I'll write home every day</i>

49
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,500
You better.

50
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,300
<i>And I'll send all my loving to you</i>

51
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,600
You bastard.

52
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,200
- Bye, sweetheart!
- Bye!

53
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,900
Goodbye, Danny!

54
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,800
Bye.

55
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,300
- Go deep!
- Let's go...

56
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,900
Wildcats!

57
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
All right, ladies, let's take a break.
Come on.

58
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,500
<i>Yeah, I'll tell you somethir</i>

59
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,300
<i>I think you'll understand</i>

60
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,100
<i>When I say that somethir</i>

61
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,800
<i>I wanna hold your hand</i>

62
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,200
<i>Oh, please say to me</i>

63
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,300
<i>You'll let me be your man</i>

64
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,300
<i>And please say to me</i>

65
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,700
<i>You'll let me hold your hand</i>

66
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:32,900
<i>And when I touch you
I feel happy inside</i>

67
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,100
<i>It's such a feeling that my love</i>

68
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,400
<i>I can't hide</i>

69
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,300
Hop in.

70
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,700
Thanks, mate. Appreciate it.

71
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,600
Sorry. Excuse me.

72
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,800
Shit! Goddamn it.

73
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,600
Thanks, man.

74
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,600
Excuse me, you don't where I
could find Professor Huber, do you?

75
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,400
No such person.
Not that I'm aware of.

76
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,300
Professor Wesley Huber?

77
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,100
Listen, I've pissed off
every professor in Princeton...

78
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,000
and he's not one of them.

79
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,900
Oh, wait a second,
there's a Wes Huber.

80
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,500
That's him right over there.

81
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,900
Can I have a word?

82
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,100
If you're looking for work here,
check with administration.

83
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,400
I got a job, thanks.

84
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,400
You sound like a limey.

85
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
I am, yeah.

86
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,300
I was stationed there during the war.
I had some good times.

87
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
Yeah, I know.

88
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,800
At Burtonwood, right?

89
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,000
How would you know that?

90
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,300
I... I believe I'm your son.

91
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,300
I don't think so.

92
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,400
Me mother's Martha Feeny.

93
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,000
How'd you track me down?

94
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Through Army records.

95
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,300
If I would have known about you...

96
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
What? You would've come back,
is that it?

97
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,000
You know, she said that wouldn't
have proved that you loved her...

98
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,700
only that you felt obligated.

99
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,200
Well, it would have been better
than raising a kid on her own.

100
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,100
Yeah, well, she wasrt the only one
in those days.

101
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,100
You could excuse a bastard by saying
his dad was killed in the war.

102
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,600
Did she find someone else?

103
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,600
There were a few hopefuls
over the years, yeah.

104
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,300
I think I scared them off.

105
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
- Listen, kid, l...
- It's Jude.

106
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,200
Jude.

107
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,500
I got a family.
I got a wife, I got two kids.

108
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,400
Yeah, look. Mr. Huber,
I didn't come here to derail your life.

109
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,300
You know? And I'm not here
for your love or your approval.

110
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm just here so that we both...

111
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,500
Both know
that the other one exists.

112
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,300
All right.

113
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,400
- Fifteen bucks says you miss this shot.
- Fifty says your sister still marries me.

114
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Yeah, well, maybe.

115
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,900
All right, window. Let's go.

116
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,600
- All right, ladies.
- There you go.

117
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,100
- Ready?
- Yep.

118
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay.

119
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,300
Fore!

120
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,500
Run!

121
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,200
You missed!

122
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
- Whatever.
- It was the wind.

123
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
- Set me up.
- I believe in you.

124
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,400
You couldn't hit the barn side
of a broad, man. Come on.

125
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
There you go.

126
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,700
Fore!

127
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,100
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

128
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,900
- How do you like me now?
- We're gonna get you, asshole!

129
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,400
How do you like me? Go to bed.
Go to bed, you ain't got nothing.

130
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,500
- Yeah, they're going back into...
- They're not going back to bed.

131
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,400
- No, they're not.
- Go, go, go.

132
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,100
Go, go, go.

133
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
They went this way. Come on!

134
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,400
Shit, I'm out of shape.

135
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,400
You're the guy who was
asking for the janitor, right?

136
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Yeah.

137
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,400
So, what are you,
like the assistant janitor?

138
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,800
I'm just bunking down here,
you know, temporarily.

139
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
- Why?
- Why do you need to know?

140
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,200
You're wanted by the cops, huh?
FBI?

141
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,100
You know, it looks to me as though
you're the one who's on the run.

142
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,200
Yeah.
Thank you for that, by the way.

143
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
What would they have done
if they caught you?

144
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I don't know. Something involving
genitalia and shoe polish.

145
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,700
- Nasty.
- Yeah.

146
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,500
- Where's that accent from?
- Same place as me. Liverpool.

147
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,900
And do you have a name?

148
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,100
Yeah.

149
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,900
- It's Jude.
- Max.

150
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm pleased to meet you.

151
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,100
Well, Jude,
as a stranger to our shores...

152
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,200
the least I can do is offer you
some Ivy League hospitality.

153
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
Cheers.

154
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,300
Welcome to the nursery.

155
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>What would you do
If I sang out of tune</i>

156
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,700
<i>- Thank you.
- Would you stand up</i>

157
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,000
<i>And walk out on me?</i>

158
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
<i>- Hey. I'm Chris.
- Lend me your ears</i>

159
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,700
<i>- And I'll sing you a song
- Thanks.</i>

160
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>- And I'll try not to sing out of key
- There we go. All right.</i>

161
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,200
<i>I get by
With a little help from my friends</i>

162
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,200
<i>He gets high
With a little help from his friends</i>

163
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,900
- Take it easy, man.
- Hold it in.

164
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,500
I can't believe her.

165
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
I'm never having children.

166
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,700
- Really?
- No.

167
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,400
Think about it, it's pure narcissism.

168
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,800
I mean, people putting out little
carbon copies of themselves, going:

169
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,900
"Oh, doesn't he have
his father's eyes?

170
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,000
Doesrt he have his mother's lips?"
It's...

171
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,100
It's disgusting.

172
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,900
Well, what about adoption?

173
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,700
Luce!

174
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,200
Lucy!

175
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,900
<i>Every night
When everybody has fun</i>

176
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,200
<i>Here am I Sitting all on my own</i>

177
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,300
<i>It won't be long, yeah</i>

178
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
<i>Till I belong to you</i>

179
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,500
<i>Since you left me, I'm so alone</i>

180
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,300
<i>Now you're coming
You're coming on home</i>

181
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,400
<i>I'll be good like I know I should</i>

182
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,700
- Do you know when?
- Next weekend.

183
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,800
He got a pass
before his outfit ships out.

184
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,700
I tell you, man,
this is my favorite time of day.

185
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,500
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

186
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,300
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

187
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,900
- Hey.
- Max!

188
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,600
Jailbait.

189
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,200
- How are you? Good.
- I'm good.

190
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
- Damn.
- Max, you're such a pervert.

191
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
What? Some of them
are kind of cute.

192
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,700
When did Emily get tits?

193
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,800
Emily.

194
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,400
This is Jude. I asked him over
for Thanksgiving.

195
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,100
We don't have it in England.
Is it...? Is it a big deal?

196
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,000
Well, it's a heartwarming
American tradition.

197
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Yeah. It celebrates the time...

198
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,200
when the Indians shared their food
with the early settlers.

199
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,200
And how did we repay them?
We slaughter them in thousands...

200
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,400
and then ship them off
to the shittiest bits of real estate.

201
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm Lucy.

202
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,300
I went to the closet under the stairs
and my clubs werert there.

203
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,300
- If you'd asked...
- You'd have said no.

204
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,400
I never knew Princeton
had a golf program.

205
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
They don't.

206
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,300
It's just my way of unwinding,
you know?

207
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,600
Whack a few balls around
at the end of the day.

208
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,500
Those lectures can fry your brains.

209
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,600
"Lectures." What lectures?
He dropped two courses.

210
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
Is that fashionable?

211
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Is what fashionable?

212
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,400
- Your haircut, or lack of one.
- Androgyny suits you, Max.

213
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,300
These kids are so spoiled.

214
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,600
I washed dishes
to put myself through college.

215
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,700
You've never washed one since.
More stuffing, Jude?

216
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,600
I'm stuffed enough, thanks.

217
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,700
You have any idea what your father
pays for those tuition fees?

218
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,100
- Please.
- You know, Uncle Teddy...

219
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,500
he won't have to
pay them much longer.

220
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,500
- I'm dropping out.
- The cranberry sauce isn't as tangy...

221
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I am not cut out...

222
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,400
for this collegiate crap.

223
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,700
No problem. What are you...?
What's your plans?

224
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,400
You gonna buy a broken-down
station wagon...

225
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,700
and drive across America
like Jack...

226
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
- What is it?
- Kerouac.

227
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,900
- Mom.
- I read.

228
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,500
Well, actually, I was hoping to borrow
your car, Dad. It's got AC and stereo.

229
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,000
Goddamn it, Max!

230
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Be serious for once.

231
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,900
What do you actually intend
to do with your life?

232
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,600
Why is it always about,
"What will you do?"

233
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
"What will you do? What will he do?
Oh, my God, what will he do?"

234
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,500
Do, do, do, do, do.

235
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,500
Why isn't the issue here who I am?

236
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,000
Because, Maxwell,
what you do defines who you are.

237
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,300
No, Uncle Teddy,
who you are defines what you do.

238
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,600
Right, Jude?

239
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,800
Surely it's not what you do...

240
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,200
but it's the way that you do it.

241
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,300
Sorry you had to sit through that.

242
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,600
Is it like that at your house?

243
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,600
Not really, no.

244
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
It's just me and me mum...

245
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,500
so me education
is rarely a topic of conversation.

246
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,400
Max said you came here
to find your father.

247
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,800
- You jumped ship.
- Yeah, I did. Yeah.

248
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,300
It was weird when I got
this Princeton address, you know.

249
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,900
I had it in my head that he might be
some kind of Einstein or something.

250
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,600
But it turns out he's just
a working stiff like meself.

251
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,300
How'd it go?

252
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,300
It was okay.

253
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,500
I mean, he didn't invite me back
for Thanksgiving.

254
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Might've been a bit tricky anyway. I've
spent half me life trying to hate him.

255
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,300
He walked out on me mum
when I was just a bun in the oven.

256
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,000
I never realized I had it so easy.

257
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,100
I mean, we're so... normal.

258
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,700
Oh, yeah?

259
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,400
I don't know, dinner was quite lively.

260
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,200
You know, when do that lot start
chucking plates at each other?

261
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,200
- Dessert. Yeah.
- Oh, dessert. All right, yeah.

262
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,200
My God, you...
You have perfect teeth.

263
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,300
No, you do, they're perfect.

264
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,400
People in Liverpool,
they only seldom do.

265
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,800
They stick out in all different
directions. It's horrible.

266
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,100
You never heard of braces?

267
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,800
Yes, I have, thank you very much.
We use them to keep our trousers up.

268
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,600
Goddamn it! It's like this
every time I come home.

269
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,500
I mean, what the hell do they
talk about when I'm not here?

270
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,600
You, mainly.

271
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,700
Jude, shit. I'm sorry, man.

272
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,700
Come on, we gotta
do something with him.

273
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,300
He's a sailor on leave. He needs
a bar, a brawl and a brothel.

274
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
<i>I've just seen a face</i>

275
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,900
<i>I can't forget
The time or place where we just met</i>

276
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
<i>She's just the girl for me</i>

277
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,300
<i>And I want all the world to see
We've met</i>

278
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,700
No.

279
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,600
Why, thank you.

280
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,300
Oh, yes!

281
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,900
What will you do
if you don't go back to college?

282
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
What any irresponsible, unmotivated
dropout would do:

283
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,200
Go to New York. Like, tonight.

284
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,500
What's the rush?

285
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,700
I mean, I like it here.

286
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,500
Come on. The most exciting thing
that ever happened here...

287
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,800
was when they got automatic
pin setting. I'm talking the Village.

288
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,500
Think about it.
Great music, great dope, orgies.

289
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,100
It'll be a gas!

290
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,300
Yeah!

291
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,800
She's got a boyfriend.

292
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,500
That's okay. I've got a girlfriend.

293
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
Forget it, man.

294
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,500
I'm not living here.

295
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,100
You must be the two who called.

296
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,400
<i>Yeah. We saw your ad
in Rat Magazine.</i>

297
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,700
Right. Come on in.

298
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,000
It's our kitchen through here.

299
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,600
This would be our main room...

300
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,100
living room, whatever room.

301
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,000
Real bummer losing my last tenant.

302
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,700
He played sax at the Gaslight.
Out all night, slept all day.

303
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,100
We could do that.

304
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,700
You'd have to, man,
because I'm a singer.

305
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,100
I can't have no one screwing up
my beauty sleep before 2:00.

306
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,200
Someone can take this bedroom.

307
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,300
I'm gonna need two weeks in advance,
guys. Is that a problem?

308
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,300
- No, no, no, that's not a problem at all.
- You look kind of clean-cut.

309
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,600
Then again, could've murdered
your granny with a hammer.

310
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,000
Actually, we're students.

311
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,900
I'm Jude and he's Max.

312
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,300
I'm Sadie.

313
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,900
That's me. Out of bounds.

314
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,300
- Are you famous, Sadie?
- Man.

315
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,100
Not yet.

316
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,300
You guys have
a good memory for faces?

317
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Yeah, I think so. Why?

318
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,700
There's no mirror in your bathroom.

319
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,500
- Oh, man! What a fox!
- Yes!

320
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,500
I mean, for an older woman, huh?

321
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,900
Max, I will pay for my share of the rent
just as soon as I get a job, man.

322
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,000
Jude, don't worry about it.
Look where we are, man.

323
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Move it, pal. Come on.

324
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Get out of here.

325
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,700
Get on the ground! Get down!

326
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,500
<i>Attention.</i>

327
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,200
<i>The 7:05 Northeast Limited
leaving for New York City...</i>

328
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,700
<i>now ready for boarding

329
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:55,100
<i>Platform 20, Northeast Limited
now ready for boarding.</i>

330
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,700
Check it out, man.

331
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Check it out.

332
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,700
<i>Rat.</i>

333
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,700
What the hell are you doing, man?

334
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Desmond, this boy
wants to talk to you.

335
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,900
Hey.

336
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,700
I love it.

337
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,500
"Just stand on your head."
She said, "Why?"

338
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,100
"I wanna see what it'd look like
through a beer."

339
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,700
- Get off me.
- Oh, man.

340
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,900
Hey, do you write your own songs,
Jo-Jo?

341
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,300
Yeah.

342
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,000
I got 20 in a notebook...

343
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,100
another 10 in my head.

344
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,800
Leave room for anything else?

345
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,400
Music's the only thing
that makes sense anymore, man.

346
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,400
Play it loud enough,
it keeps the demons at bay.

347
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,300
Hello, hello. Who are you?

348
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,300
- Prudence.
- Where you from, Prudence?

349
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,600
Nowhere.

350
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,900
Oh, and before nowhere?

351
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,900
Ohio.

352
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,900
Then I was living
with this guy across the street.

353
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,100
Did he do that to you?

354
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,500
He was a mistake.

355
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,100
Where'd she come from?

356
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,800
She came in
through the bathroom window.

357
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,200
Thanks.

358
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
I understand you need to get away...

359
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,900
but why not come to Europe
with your father and me?

360
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,100
I'd rather be with Max.

361
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,000
In New York?

362
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,000
Just for the summer,
till I go to college.

363
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,600
I shudder to think how Max lives,
or what he's up to.

364
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,200
He always attracts
the most dubious people.

365
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,800
He's probably surrounded by
promiscuous dope fiends.

366
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,700
Mom!

367
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,100
You know me. I don't even smoke.

368
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,100
The big, bad city's
not gonna get me.

369
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,000
Isn't she fantastic?

370
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,100
Amazing.

371
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
She's our landlady.

372
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,400
- You live with my brother too?
- Yeah, him and Jude took me in.

373
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,900
I don't sleep with them anymore.

374
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,400
Thank you.

375
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,700
Hey, Lucy?

376
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,300
How do you like New York so far?

377
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,400
This is all I've seen. I only
got off the train three hours ago.

378
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,000
- Oh, yeah?
- Let's hear it for the Po Boys, y'all.

379
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,300
Do you wanna go out
and get some fresh air?

380
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,900
- Yeah?
- How about another one?

381
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,000
- All right, bring it home!
- All right!

382
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,000
Man, it's packed in there.

383
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,300
Your girlfriend didn't look too happy
about us leaving together.

384
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,600
She... She's not my girlfriend.

385
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,200
Well, you know, she's a friend
who's a girl.

386
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
I thought you'd gone home.

387
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,200
No, no. I like it here.

388
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,800
Although I'm not really here.

389
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,600
You know, without a visa
I don't officially exist.

390
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,100
It's exhilarating in a way. It's like
a weird kind of freedom. You know?

391
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,000
Hey.

392
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,900
Are you okay?

393
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,300
I mean, you know,
I heard what happened.

394
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah.

395
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,100
But...

396
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,000
a letter came for Max
before I left home...

397
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,800
and I haven't been able
to bring myself to give it to him yet.

398
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,200
- Scrub the floor, right, Jo-Jo?
- That's disgusting.

399
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,200
That was great, man.
You got a really good sound.

400
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,300
You shouldn't have
dropped out of college, Max.

401
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,000
Your sister's right. You had that
whole Ivy League thing going for you.

402
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,400
- And your father's a lawyer and shit.
- Max, what exactly does it say?

403
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,500
It says I have to report to
an induction center on the 7th.

404
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Bummer.

405
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,000
You got a week to contract
some fatal disease.

406
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,500
Guys tried all kinds of stuff
when I did my time.

407
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,200
- You were in the military, Jo-Jo?
- No escaping it where I'm from.

408
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,600
I went in when I was 17.

409
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Say you're a homo.
They don't take homos.

410
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Just say you're a pedophile.
Say you wanna go into the villages...

411
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,100
and you wanna rape and pillage
all the little girls that look like me.

412
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,800
I remember this one cat.

413
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,400
He ate a ton of beets
the night before the physical.

414
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,100
- Looks like blood when you piss.
- Well, I hate beets.

415
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,500
- Can we get the check, please?
- In a minute.

416
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,400
- What is with these pricks?
- Calm down.

417
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,900
My mate's brother swallowed
a ball of cotton to get out the army.

418
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,300
What does that do?

419
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,000
It shows up as, like,
a shadow on the x-ray.

420
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,500
- Track marks. They won't take a junkie.
- You want him to shoot up?

421
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,400
No. We could just jab his arm
with a needle a few times.

422
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,800
Make it a rusty needle.
Then it'll get infected.

423
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
- That could work.
- Yeah. Gets all nasty.

424
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,000
- Max.
- Oh, man, Max, what are you doing?

425
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,500
You can burn that paper, boy...

426
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
but you still gotta show.

427
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,500
Daniel couldn't wait to go.

428
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,700
He saw it as his patriotic duty.

429
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,500
And I went along with it.

430
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,600
I was proud of him, I guess.

431
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Apparently, he did
something brave...

432
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,600
so he wore a medal
when they buried him.

433
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,200
You don't have to talk about this.

434
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,500
I want to.

435
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,900
I can't pretend like it didn't happen.

436
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,700
He was my first boyfriend.

437
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,800
He was the first person
I ever knew to die.

438
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,400
I'd never even been
to a funeral before.

439
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,700
I'm so scared for Max.

440
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,000
Listen, no one and no gun
is gonna get Max.

441
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,600
You know, he's so twisted,
he'll bend his way out of this fix.

442
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,900
Hope you're right.

443
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,000
I am right.

444
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,100
I love the bugger.

445
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,000
- Do you have the draft in England?
- Not anymore.

446
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,600
Well, I'd have been exempt
as a shipyard worker.

447
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,200
You should've studied art.

448
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah.

449
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,000
Well, I had to bring money
into the house.

450
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,500
So I joined the ranks
of the great unwashed.

451
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,500
Here. Come here.

452
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Come here.

453
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,400
A little closer.

454
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,100
I just wanna get your eyes right.

455
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,600
You two, scram!
You're defacing city property.

456
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,100
- Oh, shit.
- What are you talking about?

457
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,800
This was just a crappy wall
and now it's a work of art.

458
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,500
You want me to come down there?

459
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,400
Please do come down.
You'll scuff up them shiny black boots.

460
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,800
Idiot.

461
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,800
Shit! Come on, you don't want to
get in trouble with the law.

462
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,300
- Let's go!
- Go! Go, go, go.

463
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,400
Jude, Jude, come here. Come here.

464
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,800
<i>If I fell in love with you</i>

465
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,400
<i>Would you promise to be true</i>

466
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:11,000
<i>And help me understand</i>

467
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,400
<i>'Cause I've been in love before</i>

468
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,500
<i>And I found that love was more</i>

469
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:27,300
<i>Than just holding hands</i>

470
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:35,500
<i>If I give my heart to you</i>

471
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:44,600
<i>I must be sure from the very start</i>

472
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:53,600
<i>That you would love me
More than her</i>

473
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,700
<i>If I trust in you</i>

474
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:09,400
<i>Oh, please, don't run and hide</i>

475
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,700
<i>If I love you too</i>

476
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:23,500
<i>Oh, please, don't hurt my pride
Like her</i>

477
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:30,100
<i>'Cause I couldn't stand the pain</i>

478
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:38,500
<i>And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain</i>

479
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,000
So that's the way it is.

480
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,900
Yeah. That's the way it is.

481
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,900
Yeah, well, speaking as a brother,
I think she could do better.

482
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,100
Max, get out.

483
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,400
Well, excuse me, but as blissful as
you are in the throes of young love...

484
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,600
I'm just letting you know
I got a date with Uncle Sam.

485
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,100
<i>I want you</i>

486
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,700
<i>I want you so bad</i>

487
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,500
<i>I want you so bad</i>

488
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,600
<i>It's drivir me mad</i>

489
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,100
Any reason you shouldn't
be in this mars Army, son?

490
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,600
I'm a cross-dressing homosexual
pacifist with a spot on my lung.

491
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,600
Long as you don't have flat feet.

492
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,500
You know what really pisses me off?
Is I swallowed all those cotton balls...

493
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,300
and they never even
took an x-ray.

494
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,000
- You still have options, man.
- Yeah, jail or Canada...

495
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,600
and they both suck.

496
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,100
I mean, I could never come home.
So, what is it?

497
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,700
It's a choice of a 6-by-4 cell or an
endless wasteland of frozen tundra.

498
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,900
- Montreal's cool.
- Man, they speak French.

499
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,300
So learn French.
Learn French or die.

500
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,900
You think Sadie knows?

501
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,200
Knows what?

502
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,500
Let me see.

503
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,300
- No way.
- You look gorgeous.

504
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,600
Sadie, come on. What...?

505
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,400
- It's my band, honey.
- I can't wear this.

506
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,300
It's Tuxedo Club. For my 'do.

507
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,800
Yeah?

508
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,800
- Cool.
- Don't start.

509
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,900
What is it, Max?

510
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,000
Prudence. Come on, sweet pea.

511
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,600
We all love you.

512
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,100
- How long's she been in there?
- All night, I guess.

513
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,700
- Come on, Pru.
- What's going on?

514
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,400
It's Prudence.
I think she's hung up on me.

515
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,300
<i>Dear Prudence</i>

516
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,800
<i>Wort you come out to play?</i>

517
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,100
<i>Dear Prudence</i>

518
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:28,900
<i>Greet the brand-new day</i>

519
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,100
<i>The sun is up, the sky is blue</i>

520
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,700
<i>It's beautiful and so are you</i>

521
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,300
- Sadie, we gotta go.
- Later.

522
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,200
<i>Hey, hey, LBJ.
How many kids did you kill today?</i>

523
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:18,200
Our voice is our weapon.
And united we will win!

524
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,100
That's right, yeah!

525
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:27,100
You can crush the idealists,
but you cannot crush their ideals!

526
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,600
The Americans are forcing even their
friends into becoming their enemies.

527
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,200
Every day the hatred increases...

528
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,400
in the hearts of the Vietnamese
who want us out!

529
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,200
The image of America
will never again...

530
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,700
be the image of revolution,
freedom and democracy...

531
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,400
but the image
of violent imperialism!

532
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,600
Hey, Luce! Luce, come on,
stop worrying about it.

533
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,100
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

534
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,800
I could go in the Army
and not get shipped to anywhere.

535
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,400
Play a lot of cards, learn how to box.

536
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,100
Come on, look at this.
It's happening everywhere, man.

537
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,300
Maybe LBJ will have a change of heart
and call the whole thing off, huh?

538
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,100
This war is totally immoral!

539
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,400
- As soon as possible.
- Yeah, I can get it.

540
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,700
Paco. This is Lucy Carrigan.

541
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,800
She's an old friend.
She's not a student...

542
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,300
but she's interested in what we do.
Wanted to meet you.

543
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,700
- Paco.
- Nice to meet you.

544
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,300
How'd you hear about us?

545
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,000
I saw you at the Fifth Avenue peace
march. I was moved by your speech.

546
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,700
I'm thinking of renting the spare room
since Prudence split.

547
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,200
Jesus, Max.

548
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,100
Well, she's Prudence. She'll show.

549
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,700
You're up before 2 and
looking wicked cool. Who's it for?

550
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,600
- I have a meeting.
- Why, is that a prayer meeting?

551
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,700
Yeah, for your twisted soul.

552
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,300
- Put my shirt away when you're done.
- Yes, ma'am.

553
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,000
What the hell was that?

554
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,500
That's Dr. Robert.

555
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,400
He's here to plug his book.

556
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,500
Spread the word.

557
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,500
There's a party for him tonight
if you wanna join me.

558
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,500
We could celebrate.

559
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,500
I haven't said yes yet, Bill.

560
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,900
Sign with my label.

561
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,800
I'll put you in a studio within a month
and get you a publishing deal.

562
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:50,000
It sounds fantastic, man. But I still
gotta talk it over with the guys.

563
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,300
No, you don't.

564
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,200
- Whose place is this?
- Luna Park, Dr. Robert's publisher.

565
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,800
There she is. Luna!

566
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,900
Bill, good to see you.

567
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,700
Luna Park.

568
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:23,300
- Wow, this place is amazing.
- This is Sadie.

569
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:28,000
Fabulous singer and future star,
if she's smart and signs with me.

570
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,000
Oh, look at this, pink punch.

571
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,500
Cheers.

572
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:38,000
- You're not listening.
- Your guitar sound is a little lazy.

573
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,800
- We need it tighter, not slick.
- This band gets behind me.

574
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Dr. Robert.

575
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,800
Time is not on our hands, people.

576
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,100
Time is slipping through them.

577
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,900
We gotta transcend the bullshit,
and fast.

578
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:07,300
But, hey, no point butting your heads
bucking the system.

579
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,600
Let them get all snarled up
in their dreary hive.

580
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,600
Never knock the way
another cat swings, man.

581
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,000
Hate to mess with your groove,
New York...

582
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,300
but we're about two years
ahead of you on the coast.

583
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,500
We already graduated
from what's been going on...

584
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,800
to where it's gone.

585
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:37,700
Amen.

586
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,700
Nice. Nice.

587
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,200
Love the people. Love the people.
We love the people.

588
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,900
Where are we?

589
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,100
I don't know.
And I don't know how we got here.

590
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,300
What is that place?

591
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,700
Headquarters of
the League of Spiritual Deliverance.

592
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,700
The home of Dr. Geary.

593
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:08,700
Another outlaw like myself.
We're navigators.

594
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,600
We're aviators. We're...

595
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,700
eating taters.
Masturbating alligators.

596
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:17,500
Bombardiers, we got no fears,
won't shed no tears.

597
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:20,200
We're pushing the frontiers...

598
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,100
of transcendental perception.

599
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,500
What's weird is we haven't met yet...

600
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,700
on this or any other plane.
Hey, doc.

601
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,900
- He says he won't see you, man.
- Why, is he sick?

602
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,400
He just said he's busy.

603
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,700
Did you tell that son of a bitch...

604
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:44,600
that we drove 3000 miles
to see him?

605
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,600
- All right, everybody back on the bus.
- What?

606
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,900
We're going home. California.

607
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,300
- Doc?
- We just got here.

608
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,700
- California isn't home to all of us.
- Yeah.

609
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:01,300
What can I say? You're either
on the bus or off the bus.

610
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,600
- Sayonara!
- Screw you!

611
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,000
Oh, well, that's just perfect.

612
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,100
My last blowout before the Army,
we're stuck in the middle of...

613
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,200
- Where are we, huh?
- It doesn't matter.

614
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,800
"I am me as you are he as you are
me and we are all together."

615
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,500
That is so right. That's right.

616
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:27,100
You know, and if nobody's everybody
then someone can be anybody, right?

617
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,000
Listen. Do you hear the music?

618
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,100
- Where are we going?
- We're going out of our minds.

619
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,300
Come on, this way.

620
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,200
- Where are you taking me?
- Down the rabbit hole.

621
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,400
- Oh, I wanna feed the cow.
- Let's go.

622
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,800
Oh, my God, Jude.

623
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,400
Now, that's big.

624
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,800
<i>For the benefit of Mr. Kite</i>

625
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,800
<i>There will be a show tonight
On trampoline</i>

626
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,400
<i>The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair</i>

627
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,300
Have you seen it?
It's great, they got stuff.

628
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,400
<i>Over men and horses
Hoops and garters</i>

629
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,600
<i>Lastly through a hogshead
Of real fire</i>

630
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,000
<i>In this way
Mr. K. will challenge the world</i>

631
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:53,300
With the blue people. They're great.
They're just chilled out.

632
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,600
I better heat you up.

633
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,400
Is that Prudence?

634
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,800
It is!

635
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,200
Prudence!

636
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,700
Hi, guys!

637
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,900
Oh, man, that was amazing.

638
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,000
That was bizarre, yo. That was...

639
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,300
- Look at you, sweet pea.
- It's good to see you.

640
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,600
- You too.
- Oh, I want you to meet Rita.

641
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,900
She's a contortionist.

642
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:19,200
<i>Because the world is round</i>

643
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:25,700
<i>It turns me on</i>

644
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:49,700
<i>Because the wind is high</i>

645
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:56,400
<i>It blows my mind</i>

646
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:18,700
<i>Love is old, love is new</i>

647
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:25,500
<i>Love is all, love is you</i>

648
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,300
Blood! Down! Down!

649
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,100
Down!

650
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,300
What time do you finish?

651
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,700
<i>I don't know.</i>

652
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,000
<i>I love you.</i>

653
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:37,000
<i>Something in the way she moves</i>

654
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,300
<i>Attracts me like no other lover</i>

655
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:51,800
<i>Something in the way she woos me</i>

656
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,600
<i>I don't wanna leave her now</i>

657
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,300
<i>You know I believe, and how</i>

658
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:47,100
<i>You're asking me
Will my love grow</i>

659
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,400
<i>I don't know</i>

660
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,000
<i>I don't know</i>

661
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,300
<i>You stick around Now it may show</i>

662
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,900
Hey, you didn't get
my left nipple right.

663
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,600
Oh, is that so?

664
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,600
Well, you know,
you were lying on your side...

665
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,100
and I was drawing from a distance.

666
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,200
So I couldn't see it properly.

667
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,100
What time is it?

668
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,200
- Eleven o'clock, I think.
- I gotta run.

669
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,500
You didn't get in till 2:30.

670
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,100
You know Columbia's top scientists are
working for the Defense Department?

671
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,800
I didn't, no.

672
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,300
There's gonna be this demonstration
on the campus to protest it.

673
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,100
Paco says we need to radicalize.

674
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,700
It's not enough
to just hand out leaflets...

675
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:11,600
and lie down in the middle of the
street and give flowers to cops.

676
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,700
Well, will he give you time off
to go to Sadie's gig? Which is tonight.

677
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,500
I'll try.

678
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,400
Well, can you try harder?

679
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,300
I can't believe you're telling me this.
And the rest of the guys?

680
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,800
- I tried to tell you this a million times.
- So this is it?

681
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,400
<i>Oh, darlir</i>

682
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,000
<i>Please believe me</i>

683
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:46,000
<i>I'll never do you no harm</i>

684
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:52,200
<i>Believe me when I tell you</i>

685
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,500
<i>I'll never do you no harm</i>

686
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,200
<i>If you leave me</i>

687
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,500
<i>I'll never make it alone</i>

688
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,300
I doubt that.

689
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:22,400
<i>Oh, believe me when I beg you</i>

690
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,300
<i>Don't ever leave me alone</i>

691
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,600
What is this?

692
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,200
<i>When you told me</i>

693
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,800
<i>You didn't need me anymore</i>

694
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,100
I don't believe this.

695
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,900
Hey, where you going?

696
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,400
Where were we?

697
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,900
Oh, yeah, that's right, baby.
I don't need you. I'm gonna show you.

698
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,900
What the hell happened, man?
Where'd Sadie go?

699
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:16,500
Solo, man. Way solo.

700
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:44,900
Hey, how's it going? Hope we're
not interrupting the creative flow.

701
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,700
Still life?

702
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,100
Yeah, yeah, it's...

703
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,200
I'm sorry, what's that doing here?

704
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,000
Well, you don't have one.
I had a spare.

705
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,900
Where should I put it?

706
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,400
Right here is fine for now.

707
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,700
They're transmitting
live from Vietnam now.

708
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,300
It's gonna make a difference.

709
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,300
Bringing the war
right in the people's living room.

710
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,800
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,
mate, but this isn't a living room.

711
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,200
This is where I work.

712
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,600
I'm sorry, he must really
be caught up with what he's doing.

713
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,500
There you go.

714
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:39,900
You should probably
try to get an outside antenna.

715
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,100
I gotta go. You'll be there later?

716
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,500
Yeah.

717
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,500
<i>Saigon command disclosed
that 5000 more U.S. troops...</i>

718
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,700
<i>were committed to the war
last week...</i>

719
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:05,100
<i>bringing American troop strength
to over half a million men.</i>

720
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,200
<i>The Vietcong assault
on South Vietnam cities...</i>

721
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,700
<i>produced record casualties
last week.</i>

722
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:13,300
<i>Four hundred sixteen
Americans were killed...</i>

723
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,600
<i>and 15,029 wounded...</i>

724
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,800
<i>raising total U.S. combat fatalities
in this country's longest war...</i>

725
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,300
<i>to 30,057.</i>

726
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,600
Well, I got a job.

727
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:48,400
You know, as in,
"We'll pay you to do it."

728
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,400
I thought you'd be pleased.

729
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,100
What job?

730
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,800
It's a logo
for Sadie's record company.

731
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:00,200
It's a strawberry.

732
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:06,500
You know, red, juicy, sexy.

733
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,600
Yeah, get it? No?

734
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,300
Why were you so rude
to Paco before?

735
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,700
It wouldn't have killed you
to talk to him. He's got a good mind.

736
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,800
He's committed,
he's involved, he's...

737
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,200
- A shagger.
- A what?

738
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,700
A shagger. A Don Juan.

739
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,500
A seducer
of young, vulnerable women.

740
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,900
Jude, you know nothing about him.

741
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,900
Every time I go to your place,
there's about 50 people there.

742
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,700
There's one bloke licking stamps
and the other 49 are...

743
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,500
- Oh, they're all female.
- Don't exaggerate.

744
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,100
Trust me, I'm not.

745
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:51,500
We're in the middle of a revolution.

746
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:54,900
What are you doing,
doodles and can'toons?

747
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,000
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No?

748
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,900
No? Well, what did you mean?

749
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,900
Sorry I'm not the man with
the megaphone, this is what I do.

750
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,400
You could at least hear
what he has to say.

751
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,500
I suppose you don't, because
you're never gonna be drafted.

752
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,100
Nor will you, Lucy.

753
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,500
I would lie down in front of a tank...

754
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,800
if it would stop this war
and bring Max home.

755
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,800
Yeah? Well, it wouldn't.

756
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,800
What do you mean, it wouldn't?
You don't think that it's won'th trying?

757
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,500
I didn't say that. I'm...

758
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:29,800
Well, maybe when bombs
start going off here, people will listen.

759
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,800
<i>You say you want a revolution</i>

760
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,100
<i>Well, you know</i>

761
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,700
<i>We all wanna change the world</i>

762
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,500
Jude, what are you doing?
I can't do this right now.

763
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:01,100
<i>You tell me that it's evolution</i>

764
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:04,700
<i>Well, you know</i>

765
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,600
<i>Yeah, we all wanna change the world</i>

766
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,000
Jude, please. Please, don't.

767
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,800
<i>But when you talk about destruction</i>

768
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,400
<i>Don't you know
That you can count me out?</i>

769
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,200
- What are you doing here, friend?
- It's not the time. Not now.

770
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,000
<i>Don't you know it's gonna be
All right</i>

771
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,300
- Escort him to the door. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

772
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,200
Come on, let's go.

773
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,700
I've never seen him like that.
I don't know.

774
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,100
You gotta leave, buddy. Come on.

775
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,400
- Jude!
- Who is this asshole?

776
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,900
Jesus!

777
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,900
Are you okay?

778
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,600
Get this clown out of here now!

779
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,200
Get him out of here!

780
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,600
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!

781
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:40,300
All right! All right!

782
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,800
What is the matter with you?
Why would you do that?

783
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,500
<i>On the edge of the balcony
he was shot.</i>

784
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,300
<i>We thought a firecracker
had gone on.</i>

785
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,600
<i>Most of us were downstairs
on the lower level.</i>

786
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,800
<i>Police have issued
an all-points bulletin...</i>

787
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,800
<i>for a well-dressed white man
seen running from the scene.</i>

788
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,300
<i>We hold these truths
to be self-evident...</i>

789
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,600
<i>that all men are created equal.</i>

790
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,300
<i>Memphis is a confused
and shocked city tonight.</i>

791
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,500
<i>No one can believe
what has happened.</i>

792
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:30,600
<i>It's been just a little over an hour...</i>

793
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,100
<i>since Dr. Martin Luther King died
from an assassirs bullet.</i>

794
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:37,900
<i>Dr. King was rushed to St. Joseph's
Hospital emergency room.</i>

795
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,200
<i>He died from a gunshot wound
in the neck.</i>

796
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,800
<i>I'm sick and tired of violence.</i>

797
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,700
<i>I'm tired of the war in Vietnam.</i>

798
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,000
<i>I look at you all</i>

799
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:59,400
<i>See the love there that's sleeping</i>

800
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:06,000
<i>While my guitar gently weeps</i>

801
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,200
<i>I look at the floor</i>

802
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,900
<i>And I see it needs sweeping</i>

803
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:24,000
<i>Still my guitar gently weeps</i>

804
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:35,600
Not now. What is this ridiculous
bullshit? He can't even play guitar.

805
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:41,600
The sound sucked out there.
How many times...?

806
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:45,000
Get out there and tell Tony to fix it
or I don't go on tomorrow night.

807
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:48,200
Come on, Sadie,
it's the ratty end of the tour. Cool it.

808
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,800
Find me someone
who can play the guitar, man.

809
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,800
This new guy's
got no soul and no stank.

810
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,500
Do you wanna come up
for one more, Jo?

811
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,900
I ain't gonna find Sadie there, man.

812
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:43,300
You better go on up to Lucy.

813
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,300
Yeah.

814
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:48,600
Well, she's probably out
fighting for the cause, you know?

815
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,600
It look like you been
fighting for it too, huh?

816
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:56,100
I don't have one.
That's the problem.

817
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,700
<i>Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup</i>

818
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,200
<i>They slither while they pass</i>

819
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:11,100
<i>They slip away
Across the universe</i>

820
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:17,400
<i>Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my open mind</i>

821
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:21,700
<i>Possessing and caressing me</i>

822
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:37,500
<i>Nothing's gonna change my world</i>

823
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,900
<i>Images of broken light</i>

824
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:52,100
<i>Which dance before me
Like a million eyes</i>

825
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:57,300
<i>They call me on and on
Across the universe</i>

826
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:03,900
<i>Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letterbox</i>

827
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:11,200
<i>They tumble blindly as they
Make their way across the universe</i>

828
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,400
Strike! Strike! Strike!

829
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:23,300
No! No!

830
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:33,500
Lucy!

831
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:37,500
- Jude!
- Lucy!

832
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,200
- Jude!
- Lucy!

833
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:55,700
- Jude!
- Lucy!

834
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:31,800
Die! Die!

835
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,400
You have a visitor.

836
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:14,000
What are you doing here?

837
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,800
I got a call from a friend of yours,
a girl.

838
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Said that you were in trouble,
so I came down.

839
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,400
Are you all right?

840
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:35,200
I told the cops that I was a
U.S. citizen and you were my son.

841
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:39,700
- What did they say?
- They wanted proof.

842
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,700
I didn't have any.

843
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:48,400
I talked the cops out of pressing
charges for the riot and stuff...

844
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,500
but the bottom line,
this is an immigration issue.

845
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:53,700
Meaning they're
kicking me out of the country?

846
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,700
- I'm afraid so.
- Shit.

847
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:07,100
Thanks... Thanks for trying,
though, yeah?

848
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:15,300
Have you told your mother
you met me?

849
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,800
Not yet.

850
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:26,200
But... But l... But I will.

851
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:45,500
Look who's coming.

852
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,500
- How's it going, Jude?
- I'm okay, yeah.

853
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,900
So when did you and Phil hitch up?

854
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,700
About two weeks
after you stopped writing.

855
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:03,200
Oh, I'm pleased for you, though.
And a kid's on the way.

856
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,800
That's great.

857
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,700
- What was the name?
- Who?

858
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:11,300
The reason you stopped writing.

859
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,400
Her name was Lucy.

860
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:21,000
It was... It was good
for a while, you know.

861
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,000
It all seems a bit unreal.

862
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,200
Is this real enough for you?

863
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,500
Glad to be back?

864
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:33,900
Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't be happier.

865
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,000
<i>She's not a girl Who misses much</i>

866
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,500
I'll be here same time next week,
okay?

867
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:45,100
<i>I need a fix
'Cause I'm going down</i>

868
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,600
<i>Mother Superior jumped the gun</i>

869
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:26,600
<i>Happiness is a warm gun</i>

870
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:40,100
<i>When I hold you In my arms</i>

871
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:44,900
<i>And when I feel
My finger on your trigger</i>

872
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:50,000
<i>Oh, don't you know
Nobody can do me no harm</i>

873
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,900
<i>Stop telling me this is a peaceful
march. It's much worse than that.</i>

874
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:48,000
The dogs and the violence...

875
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:51,700
and the people you're with are more
radical than you want me to believe.

876
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:57,200
They should be radical. You should
be radical. We should all be radical.

877
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,900
Daniel is dead
and Max is all fucked up...

878
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:03,200
and this war just keeps going
on and on and nobody's listening.

879
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,500
<i>- I'm listening.
- No, you're not listening.</i>

880
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:09,200
<i>I just don't want
my beautiful daughter to get hurt.</i>

881
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,600
Look, Mom. Don't cry.

882
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,200
Please don't cry.

883
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:19,400
Everything's really okay here,
I promise.

884
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,200
It's gonna be all right, I gotta go.

885
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:17,700
Close the door.

886
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:25,600
I thought it was the other side
who dropped bombs.

887
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:59,200
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks.

888
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,800
<i>Blackbird singing
In the dead of night</i>

889
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:15,700
<i>Take these broken wings
And learn to fly</i>

890
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,800
<i>All your life</i>

891
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:24,000
<i>You were only waiting</i>

892
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:28,500
<i>For this moment to arise</i>

893
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:37,400
<i>Blackbird fly</i>

894
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:43,900
<i>Blackbird fly</i>

895
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:50,600
<i>Into the light of the dark black night</i>

896
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,500
- Here, love.
- Thanks.

897
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,800
Last call, pal.

898
01:55:56,100 --> 01:56:01,300
<i>Hey, Jude Don't make it bad</i>

899
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:08,700
<i>Take a sad song
And make it better</i>

900
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:15,100
<i>Remember
To let her into your heart</i>

901
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:21,600
<i>Then you can start
To make it better</i>

902
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,100
Max!

903
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:08,800
You don't look too messed up.

904
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,200
Yeah, well, everything
below the neck works fine.

905
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,900
Does she know?

906
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,400
- You didn't tell her.
- Nope.

907
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,400
All right, good. Good.

908
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:26,900
<i>Hey, this is your Cousin Brucie

910

<i>- Is that Sadie?
- You got that right.</i>

911
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,500
Shit, we're late.

912
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:44,500
<i>Don't let me down</i>

913
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:57,800
<i>Nobody ever loved me like he does</i>

914
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:09,800
<i>And if somebody loved me
Like she do me</i>

915
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,900
<i>Ooh, she do me</i>

916
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:18,100
<i>Yes, she does</i>

917
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:23,300
- Yeah!
- Hey, Prudence.

918
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:26,200
- How are you?
- Good. Welcome back.

919
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:27,400
Where's Lucy?

920
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:29,300
Don't know.
She should be on her way.

921
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:33,200
- Did you give her the right address?
- Yeah. I thought I saw her on the street.

922
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:35,100
Oh, shit.

923
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:37,300
Let's go.

924
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:39,700
Spread out.

925
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:51,900
That's it. Wrap it up. Let's go.

926
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:55,600
You have no permit. You're disturbing
the peace. Come on, off the roof.

927
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,100
- Come on.
- Thank you!

928
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
It's all over.

929
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,600
- Come on, let's go.
- Feels good to be back, baby.

930
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,200
Yeah!

931
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,900
Come on, we gotta clear the roof.
Let's go.

932
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:10,600
- Hey. Be nice, be nice.
- All right. Keep moving.

933
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,800
- Yeah, yeah.
- Joy. Happiness.

934
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,100
That's right.
Background singers, huh?

935
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:18,000
- Where did Jude go?
- I don't know. And where is my sister?

936
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:19,500
I'm sure I saw her, Max.

937
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,700
I don't understand
what the problem is.

938
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:29,100
Man, get your hands off me.

939
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:58,300
<i>There's nothing you can do
That can't be done</i>

940
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:03,100
<i>Nothing you can sing
That can't be sung</i>

941
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:04,700
What?

942
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:06,500
<i>Nothing you can say</i>

943
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:09,200
<i>But you can
Learn how to play the game</i>

944
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:11,300
Who the hell is that?

945
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,300
- Jude?
- It's Jude.

946
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:18,800
<i>There's nothing you can make
That can't be made</i>

947
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:24,000

02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,500
<i>It's easy</i>

950
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:35,700
Hey, that means you too. Let's go.

951
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,400
<i>All you need is love</i>

952
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,600
- Hey, kid! Get your ass out of here!
- Let him stay.

953
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,200
Come on. Come on, out of my way.

954
02:03:58,200 --> 02:03:59,800
Let's go.

955
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:05,500
Plug it in.

956
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:09,300
- All right.
- Thanks.

957
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:10,900
That's great.

958
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,500
Oh, please, you have to let me
through. I need to get up there.

959
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:39,300
- I can't believe this.
- The roof is closed. The roof is closed.
