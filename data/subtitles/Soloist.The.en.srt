00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,612
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

2
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,614
<i>A construction foreman in Griffith Park
heard the crash.</i>

3
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,847
Hey!

4
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,854
<i>He saw a cyclist cartwheel off his bike</i>

5
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,191
<i>and slam face-first into the unforgiving
asphalt of Riverside Drive.</i>

6
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:45,694
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

7
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,664
<i>As we begin our descent
into Los Angeles,</i>

8
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,897
<i>we ask that you please be sure
that your seatbelts are fastened...</i>

9
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,701
<i>A 911 call brought out the troops
from Fire Station 76.</i>

10
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,977
- What happened?
- You had an accident.

11
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,842
- Do you know what happened?
- No shit, I had an accident. What?

12
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:06,384
<i>I don't remember any of this,
nor do I recall the cause of the spill.</i>

13
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,544
- Our batteries are off.
- I've been in here six hours now, and...

14
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,088
Listen to me. Wait a minute.
We're ready to go...

15
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,681
Hypochondriac.

16
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,288
OR 2.

17
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:18,288
<i>County-USC was
the closest emergency room,</i>

18
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,354
<i>and I quickly realized</i>

19
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:21,694
<i>that if you find yourself there</i>

20
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,067
<i>with nothing more than
a bump on the head,</i>

21
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,411
<i>you are one lucky Angeleno.</i>

22
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,248
Wow.

23
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,692
Ready.

24
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,362
<i>I'm not entirely comfortable with this.</i>

25
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:14,751
<i>Thank you.</i>

26
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,290
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

27
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,692
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

28
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,036
Okay.

29
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,141
Really?

30
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,418
<i>Doctors told me to expect
up to four weeks of disorientation.</i>

31
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,812
Christ. All right.

32
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,951
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy.
I just want you to know, I just...</i>

33
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,257
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy.</i>

34
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,127
I just want you to understand
what's going on

35
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:01,689
<i>if I start writing about
what a bang-up job</i>

36
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,166
Governor Schwarzenegger's doing.

37
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:07,262
S- C-H-W-A-R-Z... Scratch that.

38
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,834
Passe. Lacks context.

39
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,653
<i>Right. So the question is...</i>

40
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,957
<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

41
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,499
<i>Theoretically could I,
seeing as how the Governor has retired</i>

42
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,627
his position at the muscle magazine,
could I interview him?

43
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,867
<i>Right. And will my non- Teutonic lineage
be an issue?</i>

44
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:47,338
<i>See, no, that's... That's...
It gets to be funny. It's just an article.</i>

45
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,745
Do I need to have been on steroids
for a long time to even apply?

46
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,112
Good.

47
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,886
Gail, I like
the "attention must be paid" reference.

48
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:58,115
I might move it down a paragraph,
though.

49
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,091
<i>Thanks. I'm getting you a new desk.</i>

50
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:04,619
Good morning, gentlemen.

51
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,899
<i>- Thanks.
- Hey, guys. Check it out.</i>

52
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,163
I got a study here that says
the number of Americans under 35

53
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:15,639
who read a newspaper
is now down to 40%.

54
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,867
<i>- Forty?
- Forty.</i>

55
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:19,069
And the group we're losing mostly
are college-educated women.

56
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:20,634
- Pull my finger.
- Jesus Christ.

57
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,043
Hey, honey.

58
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,480
<i>"Welcome back, Steve. "
That would have been nice.</i>

59
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:25,915
<i>Thank you. You know, when Lopez
and I started out together...</i>

60
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,077
You had to walk 20 miles to school
in the snow with no shoes?

61
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,485
...people cared about
what went on in the world.

62
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,351
- Am I right, Steve? I mean, Christ.
- Back when people cared.

63
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,187
We're at war, and the only thing
that sells papers

64
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,624
is a Lindsay Lohan cooch shot.

65
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,093
Jesus, did someone
actually run that in print?

66
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:37,891
- I thought that was just on the Web.
- All right, all right.

67
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,225
- All I am saying is...
- I didn't see that.

68
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,562
...that if you run an excellent,
if I do say so myself,

69
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,865
front-page piece about how corporate
America is profiting from this war,

70
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,600
and the only reader response you get
is on two hands...

71
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:49,834
<i>- Meanwhile...
- That was a good piece, by the way.</i>

72
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:50,932
<i>- Fine. Thanks. You read it?
- I read that.</i>

73
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,909
<i>- Did you really?
- I didn't read it, but I loved it, Curt.</i>

74
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,742
Meanwhile, Lopez here
scrapes his forehead,

75
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,511
and gets, what,
I'm guessing about 75 e-mails

76
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,608
from readers worried about his safety?

77
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,882
<i>- I chased this piece.
- Then I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

78
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:06,117
<i>There is something
very wrong in this world.</i>

79
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,920
Newsflash, something wrong
with the world.

80
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,518
<i>Yeah.
Your face hurts my feelings, Steve.</i>

81
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,619
<i>That's harassment.</i>

82
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,356
- Mary?
- An environmental group studying...

83
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,490
- Please.
... chemical contaminants

84
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:14,658
- in people's bodies.
- I literally... No.

85
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,701
- Give some blood and write about it.
- Let me check my e-mails.

86
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,201
I think it would be a good idea for you.

87
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,862
I'm glad you feel that way. I just did that.

88
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,997
What do you think?

89
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:22,699
<i>The thought in my mind is,
"No, thank you. "</i>

90
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,369
It was funny.
People love it when you bleed.

91
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,605
- Readers.
- Busted.

92
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,168
What is that? What do you call that,
what you just did?

93
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,838
<i>- Transference.
- Freud.</i>

94
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,415
<i>Freud. Thank you. No.</i>

95
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,711
Sorry about the face.

96
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,345
- I hate needles.
- So use it.

97
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:40,221
<i>Originally used as a camp by settlers</i>

98
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,023
<i>outside of what was then
the village of Los Angeles,</i>

99
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,326
<i>it was called La Plaza Abaja,
or the Lower Plaza.</i>

100
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,455
Stevie Wonder fan?

101
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,359
<i>My Cherie Amour is the song of my life.</i>

102
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:50,451
<i>Signed, Sealed, Delivered.</i>

103
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,053
But you really shouldn't write
on a violin like that

104
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,565
because you have to treat a violin
like a child, you have to protect it.

105
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,760
You only got two strings.

106
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,097
All I want to do is play music,
and here's the problem

107
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,331
that I'm having right here.

108
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,500
<i>This one's gone, this one's gone,
this little one's out of commission.</i>

109
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,544
But you get that in
Cleveland public schools.

110
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:07,840
A lot of military statues in Cleveland.

111
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,643
- A very military-oriented city.
- Is that where you're from?

112
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,409
You're not gonna get musicians
on parade there.

113
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,077
<i>You got Severance Hall there.
You have The Music Settlement.</i>

114
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,142
Ohio State University.

115
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,553
<i>Whereas in Los Angeles, you have
Los Angeles PD, you have LA Times,</i>

116
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,057
you have Los Angeles Lakers.

117
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,923
<i>Those are armies, too.
Military regimentation, experimentation,</i>

118
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,326
Roman gable, Roman Catholicism,
Colonel Sanders,

119
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,490
- but this guy right here is...
- Colonel Sanders.

120
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,692
<i>...the quarterback with the orchestra.</i>

121
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,529
Now the cello could back this guy
with the same moves,

122
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,932
<i>but the cello can't be concert master.</i>

123
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,563
No. He leads out, this was
Itzhak Perlman, Jascha Heifetz.

124
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,471
You can't play music
in the winter in Cleveland

125
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,530
because of the ice and the snow.

126
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,600
<i>That's why I prefer Los Angeles
to Beethoven City,</i>

127
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,270
because it never rains
in Southern California,

128
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,542
and if it does, all I have to do
is just go in the tunnel,

129
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:44,947
<i>I could play to my heart's content.</i>

130
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,783
I'm flabbergasted about the statue.
Aren't you flabbergasted about this?

131
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,923
- Anyway, nice to meet you.
- Do you have any idea how it got here?

132
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,186
- No.
- Maybe they dropped it off late at night.

133
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,354
'Cause it's just astonishing to sit here
for hours and just... Just gaze at it.

134
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,125
- It... It just blows me away.
- No idea.

135
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,460
It really blows me away

136
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:04,594
that someone as great as Beethoven
was the leader of Los Angeles.

137
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,368
Yeah.

138
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,572
<i>I'm Steve Lopez, LA Times.</i>

139
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,113
- Lopez, L-O-P-E-Z?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,842
<i>Lopez, Los Angeles Times. Mr. Lopez.</i>

141
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,144
- What's your name?
- Lopez.

142
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:20,650
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Junior.

143
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,086
<i>N- A- T-H- A-N-I-E-L A-N- T-H- O-N-Y</i>

144
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,088
A- Y-E-R-S J-U-N-I-O-R.

145
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,153
Or J-R-period.

146
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,426
I apologize for my appearance.
I've had a few setbacks.

147
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,769
Me, too.

148
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:46,142
Who are Nancy, Paul, and Craig?

149
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,975
<i>Those were my classmates at Juilliard.</i>

150
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,947
<i>Good afternoon, Juilliard School.</i>

151
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,111
Registrar's office, please.

152
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,892
What's up?

153
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,394
It's highly classified. I can't tell you.

154
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,264
- How many?
- More than we can afford to lose.

155
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,996
Evidently, it goes like this.

156
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,129
<i>Stock price sinks, we lose reporters.</i>

157
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,003
<i>Stock price sinks more,
we lose more reporters.</i>

158
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,235
<i>That won't produce more or less...</i>

159
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,640
<i>Hi, this is Steve Lopez from
the LA Times. I'm calling to enquire</i>

160
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:22,613
as to whether a Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
attended your school.

161
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,615
A- Y-E-R-S. I'm sorry.

162
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,019
Freaking child lock.

163
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,355
- How is our son, by the way?
- He's good.

164
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,224
He likes his classes.
He likes his pre-gay roommate.

165
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:37,625
You should call him.

166
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,028
- I call him.
- Is a lie.

167
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,655
I call him. He doesn't call me back.

168
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,029
- He calls me back.
- Mary...

169
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,466
- Just try again.
- Yes, Mary.

170
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,595
- Yes, Mary.
- Yes. Yes, Steve.

171
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,501
- I gotta take this call.
- Great.

172
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:49,836
- Because I don't have a story. Hello?
- Call him.

173
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,536
<i>I'm sorry, we have no record</i>

174
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,134
<i>of a Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
ever attending Juilliard.</i>

175
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,577
Really?

176
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,149
But then I don't have a story.

177
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,785
<i>Thanks for checking.</i>

178
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,388
I'm not doing the blood thing.

179
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,693
I got too many other good ideas.

180
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:22,301
My dad is gonna freak
when he finds out I met you.

181
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,307
He loves your column.

182
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,003
What about you?

183
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,440
- Well, I don't really read the newspaper.
- Sure.

184
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,542
But when I do...

185
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,985
<i>Hey! Those aren't all for me, are they?</i>

186
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,424
I'm also going to need a clump of hair
and some urine.

187
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,019
<i>That's easy.</i>

188
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,693
- All right.
- Okay.

189
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,191
Make a fist for me.

190
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,638
Come on.

191
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,243
Crap.

192
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,951
<i>- Lopez.
- Mr. Lopez?</i>

193
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,419
Yeah, can you just hold on one second?

194
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,183
I'm having a little
technical difficulty here.

195
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,385
<i>This is Rosie Delgado
from the Juilliard School.</i>

196
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,951
<i>Mr. Lopez?</i>

197
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,826
Yes. Please continue.

198
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,926
<i>After we spoke yesterday, I realized
I only checked our graduates.</i>

199
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,698
<i>So I looked in our matriculates,
and there he was.</i>

200
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,207
<i>Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
enrolled in 1970</i>

201
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:33,734
<i>and he dropped out toward the end
of his second year.</i>

202
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,870
<i>Thank you.</i>

203
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:40,682
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.
Nathaniel was shy in our first encounter.</i>

204
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,244
<i>He stepped back... He backed away.</i>

205
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,790
<i>He... Nathaniel is... Is what?</i>

206
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,455
<i>Nathaniel is...
A great column is what Nathaniel is.</i>

207
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:54,327
<i>Nathaniel is missing.</i>

208
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,921
Son of a bitch.

209
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,119
- Raccoons.
- Oh, yeah?

210
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:24,457
<i>- That's the culprit.
- Oh, boy.</i>

211
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,830
<i>What are they doing?
They eat the grass?</i>

212
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,628
No, they eat the worms in the grass.

213
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,998
<i>They eat the worms in the grass?</i>

214
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,537
Yeah, we had them.
It's a God-awful mess.

215
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,629
- Wanna know how I got rid of them?
- Yes.

216
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,402
Coyote urine.

217
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,433
- Wow. Coyote urine?
- Seriously. In powdered form.

218
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,809
- Remarkable.
- It's a whole industry, you know.

219
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,905
Funny.

220
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:46,451
- Hey, I'm Neil, by the way.
- Okay.

221
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:01,759
<i>Anxiety, restlessness, euphoria.
If you're experiencing...</i>

222
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,953
<i>I would spend every night tossing
and turning...</i>

223
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,158
<i>Wow. Okay, and what is the proper
method of application?</i>

224
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,427
<i>Should I sprinkle it in the yard?</i>

225
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:13,335
<i>First, you wanna dilute
the urine powder in water.</i>

226
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:16,669
<i>- Wait, I want to?
- Well, maybe I should say "have to. "</i>

227
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:21,042
<i>And then you're gonna have to hang
the liquid from trees in plastic bags.</i>

228
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,479
<i>So, people are doing this
all over Southern California?</i>

229
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:26,609
<i>Oh, yes, sir.
Last month, I sold some to Paula Abdul.</i>

230
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:30,849
But no Simon Cowell?
'Cause that would be exciting. Figure?

231
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,059
I'm gonna call you back a little later.

232
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,470
Hey.

233
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,475
Hey, Nathaniel.

234
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,075
Remember me?

235
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,481
Sorry.

236
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,153
Maybe have a minute when you're done?

237
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:14,932
Let me know.

238
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,797
I just saw you, so I...

239
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,596
Nothing.

240
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,009
<i>Mr. Steve Lopez, Los Angeles Times,
Los Angeles, California.</i>

241
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,413
Hey, Nathaniel.

242
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:06,609
I've been searching for Mr. Beethoven,

243
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:07,709
but he's slipping away like a dream.

244
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,946
I'm trying to get back into shape,
but I don't have any sheet music.

245
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,354
<i>Beethoven's String Quartet,
Opus 59, Number 1,</i>

246
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,688
<i>Violin Concerto, Opus 61 in D,</i>

247
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:17,354
<i>Fifth Concerto, Opus 73 in E Flat,
red car, green car,</i>

248
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,489
there goes a police car, and God is right
on the other side of that wall.

249
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,160
I had to dig a hole
to bury some human defecation.

250
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:24,292
But they didn't have
the human decency...

251
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:25,393
I was looking for you.

252
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,371
...to use the proper facilities.
- I noticed that you've moved.

253
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,134
Well, it's beautiful here,
because you can play music

254
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,903
and have pigeons clapping
as they take off,

255
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,807
<i>and right there
is The Los Angeles Times Building.</i>

256
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,811
- Right, that's where I work.
- Mr. Steve Lopez, staff writer.

257
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,868
New York, Cleveland, it doesn't matter.

258
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,971
All I have to do is
look up at that building

259
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:38,038
and I know exactly where I am.

260
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,141
I was thinking about...

261
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,412
I'm in Los Angeles,
Los Angeles, California,

262
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,544
- Los Angeles Lakers.
... writing about you

263
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:42,608
for the paper.

264
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,814
<i>Magic Johnson,
Magic Johnson Theaters.</i>

265
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:46,323
Magic Johnson is a basketball player,
but he's also a big, black man.

266
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,483
What if I were to wanna write a story
about you for the newspaper?

267
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,892
<i>Los Angeles Times,
Los Angeles newspaper.</i>

268
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:53,954
- Staff writer, Mr. Steve Lopez.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

269
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:57,968
Do you mind if I record this?
And I wanna write a story about you.

270
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,128
A column about how a guy like you
winds up on the street.

271
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:01,398
- What do you think of that?
- Mr. Lopez needs to do

272
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:02,598
what Mr. Lopez needs to do.

273
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,732
No one could ever stop Mr. Lopez
from doing what he wants to do.

274
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,936
Are you flying that plane?

275
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,614
No. No, I'm right here.

276
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,039
I don't know how God works.

277
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:15,143
I called Juilliard, and they said
you went there, but you didn't finish.

278
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,153
I bombed right out of there.
I bombed out of Juilliard.

279
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,848
- Yeah, what happened?
- I just... It didn't happen.

280
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,893
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

281
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,951
Anyone I could contact? Family?

282
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,259
Family? Miss Floria Ayers, my mom.

283
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,924
<i>She's a beautician.
Beauty is art. Music is beauty.</i>

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,969
I don't do hair. I do my own hair,

285
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,560
but obviously, my mom does
everybody's hair in the community.

286
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:37,165
<i>They would come for her.
She's quite a woman.</i>

287
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:40,233
But I don't know how you're gonna talk
to her, though, because she passed.

288
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,507
Okay. Sorry to hear that.

289
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:45,972
Who could I call?

290
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,747
226-962-6746.

291
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,113
Whose number's that?

292
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,057
You know,
it's a dream out here, Mr. Lopez.

293
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,287
<i>The sun is shining.
The nights are cool and serene,</i>

294
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,298
and I notice that everyone is smiling.

295
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:02,261
<i>- Delivered just hours before...
- Americans are asking...</i>

296
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,030
Hi, I'm calling for Jennifer Ayers-Moore.

297
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,333
<i>How will we finally win this war?</i>

298
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:08,394
<i>Hello?</i>

299
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:10,201
<i>Hi, this is Steve Lopez
from the LA Times.</i>

300
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,336
<i>I spoke with your aunt, I believe, earlier.
She suggested I give you a call.</i>

301
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,382
<i>- About what?
- About your brother, Nathaniel.</i>

302
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:20,378
Is he dead?

303
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:23,615
What? No, no, no, he's alive.

304
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,019
<i>Is he all right?</i>

305
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:33,128
He's... Yeah. He's homeless.
I don't know if you're aware of that.

306
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,826
But he seems very bright, and...
May I record this?

307
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,731
And talented, obviously.
Juilliard and all.

308
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,128
I'm, I'm... I'm sorry.

309
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,536
<i>- Your name again, please?
- Steve Lopez.</i>

310
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,363
Mr. Lopez, why are you calling?

311
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,900
<i>I'm gonna write
a column about Nathaniel.</i>

312
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,105
Why?

313
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:55,210
Because that's what I do. Everyone has
a story, and it's interesting,

314
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,450
<i>you know, that a Juilliard alum
is now homeless.</i>

315
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,757
<i>But he seems smart
and kind, and... And...</i>

316
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:07,925
And spends his days filling the city air
with violin music, and I just...

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,990
He plays the violin now?

318
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:15,505
He's... Yeah. Why?
He used to play something else?

319
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,069
Bye, Mama.

320
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,054
- Good morning, Nathaniel.
- Morning, Miss Little John.

321
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,699
So, what do you want to play for me?

322
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,111
I'm going to play some Beethoven, sir.
I'm crazy about Beethoven.

323
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,205
<i>He was younger than me
when he started playing piano,</i>

324
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:01,047
and I wanted to play the piano,
but so many kids played it,

325
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:04,087
and there's only one at school,
so it's hard to get practice time in.

326
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:08,455
So, I chose the cello. Hardly anyone
at school wanted to play the cello.

327
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,189
And Beethoven was composing
when he was only 22,

328
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:12,752
and I'm already older than that,

329
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,196
so I figure I got a lot of
catching up to do.

330
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,132
Let's hear you play.

331
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,996
<i>He had the talent, that's for sure.
I called his mother that night.</i>

332
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:56,336
<i>I told her that I thought he was
the most gifted kid I've ever met.</i>

333
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,666
<i>I said that if he made
a full commitment to music,</i>

334
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:06,513
<i>if he really, really gave it all he had,
the whole world would open up to him.</i>

335
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:09,448
<i>And he did. He really did.</i>

336
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,819
<i>Go see if Martha's rollers are ready.
They should be on the kitchen table.</i>

337
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,357
Okay, Mama.

338
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:20,556
Miss Florence, I'll be back in 20.

339
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,098
He ain't gonna get no sleep.

340
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,634
He gonna kill that little girl
before he kills everybody...

341
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:29,002
$20,000! I told him he gotta buy me
something real pretty. Real pretty.

342
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:51,692
<i>Before long, it got so that was all he did.</i>

343
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:54,891
<i>No more football, no more baseball.
Just music.</i>

344
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,794
<i>Day in and day out.</i>

345
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,473
<i>The whole world
was changing around him.</i>

346
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,038
<i>And that was all he did.</i>

347
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,439
<i>Music.</i>

348
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:12,762
Hey, you awake?

349
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,529
You know what I hear
when you play your music?

350
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,506
I hear the voice of God coming...

351
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,470
I'm serious.

352
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:01,111
You got something special here, baby.

353
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,554
A way out.

354
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,119
<i>There is a whole world waiting for you.</i>

355
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:52,865
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

356
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,566
<i>Nathaniel was shy in our first encounter.
Period.</i>

357
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,474
<i>He took a step back
when I approached him to say</i>

358
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,069
<i>I liked the way his violin music</i>

359
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:06,878
<i>drowned out the jackhammers
on Grand Street. Period.</i>

360
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,278
<i>Nathaniel's first instrument
was the cello.</i>

361
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:14,553
<i>Strangely, he has never had
any training on the violin instrument.</i>

362
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,355
<i>He has never had... Period.</i>

363
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,021
<i>He has never had
any training on the violin.</i>

364
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:21,861
<i>He switched to the latter
after winding up on the streets.</i>

365
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:26,031
<i>One day, I asked him
about his hopes and dreams.</i>

366
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,164
<i>"That's easy," he said.
"I'd like to get these other two strings. "</i>

367
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,912
<i>Dear Mr. Lopez,</i>

368
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,575
<i>this morning I read your article
about the street musician</i>

369
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,481
<i>and was deeply moved.</i>

370
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,048
<i>This cello is one I used for 50 years,</i>

371
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,853
<i>until arthritis got the better of me.</i>

372
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,322
<i>Please pass it along to Mr. Ayers</i>

373
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,626
<i>with my prayers
for his health and safety.</i>

374
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,749
- Nathaniel!
- All I'm trying to do

375
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,114
is work as hard as I can
to clean up the tunnel.

376
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,243
- Hey! Nathaniel!
- But they don't want me to help them.

377
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,446
I won't have it, you know.

378
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,615
- Don't want to have this degradation...
- Are you out of your mind?

379
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,021
...because they just won't respect
that Beethoven...

380
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,218
What are you doing?

381
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,557
...and I try to tell every one of them,
I won't have this nastiness...

382
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:27,859
- Nathaniel!
... this degradation, I won't have it.

383
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,027
Don't!

384
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,597
Don't! Don't!

385
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:40,067
<i>I'm not going to have this nastiness
in this tunnel. This degradation.</i>

386
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:41,202
Good.

387
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,544
Remember when I said
I was gonna write about you?

388
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,413
Well, I did.

389
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:51,353
When people heard that you were
just playing with two strings,

390
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,517
some of them thought you might want
something better to work with.

391
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,492
No. I can't cover that.

392
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,153
You don't have to pay for it. It's a gift.

393
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,198
- I'm sure it's a very beautiful instrument.
- Free and clear.

394
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,325
People are very, very generous.

395
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,560
But, look, here's the deal.

396
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,230
It's not safe for you to have something
this valuable on the streets...

397
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,567
You don't have to worry
about that, Mr. Lopez.

398
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,005
I've been mugged 24 times.

399
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,734
I will fight to the death
to protect this instrument.

400
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,299
Right, that's my point exactly.

401
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:14,571
So, apparently there's a place

402
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,477
that's a couple of blocks down
that's called Lamp.

403
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,038
- I can't go... No, I can't go there.
- And I... Hold on.

404
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:19,140
I can't go... No, I can't go there.

405
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,205
<i>- They smoke cigarettes.
- I talked to the guy.</i>

406
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,445
<i>- He says you can keep it there.
- They drop the butts on the ground.</i>

407
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:24,578
<i>They do it to torment me. They just...
They do it to torment me.</i>

408
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:27,420
<i>That's the deal. You wanna play this,
you gotta do it there.</i>

409
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,789
- I can't do that.
- Oh, yeah.

410
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,394
<i>Except for this one time. Take it out
and give it a test drive or whatever.</i>

411
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,530
- So I can play it here?
- For a couple minutes,

412
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:44,233
and then we're gonna bring it to Lamp.

413
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:05,454
Laying in there like a pig in a blanket.

414
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,595
Only... Only the greats.
Really, only the greats.

415
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:11,156
Yo-Yo Ma, Jacqueline du Pre,

416
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,130
and the coolest cucumber of them all is

417
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:16,605
Janos Starker.

418
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:21,472
Gotta put rosin on your bow.
It's just like feeding a parakeet.

419
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,277
A bow needs rosin
just like a police car needs prisoners.

420
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,936
So pack it up. We'll bring it to Lamp,
you can get back at it.

421
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:12,599
I haven't really gotten a chance
to know her yet.

422
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,405
- So...
- I'm not saying you can't play.

423
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:16,503
<i>- You can. Just not here.
- This is the perfect music environment</i>

424
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,639
<i>- for playing music.
- This?</i>

425
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,909
- No.
- Yes.

426
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,416
<i>This is a sidewalk, okay?</i>

427
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,112
<i>- That's the deal. We made a deal.
- No, no, no. You'll break the bridge.</i>

428
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,815
<i>- You'll put water in it, you'll drown her.
- That's what I'll do?</i>

429
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:26,878
- It will be ruined.
- Why would I damage it?

430
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,481
- I gave you the damn thing.
- It won't play right ever,

431
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,288
- because, Mr. Lopez, you'll ruin it.
- I'm not going to...

432
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,418
I'm not gonna see you
get killed over this.

433
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,487
You don't know what you're doing.
Let me put it away myself.

434
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:35,259
<i>Then put it away.</i>

435
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,460
<i>Thank you.</i>

436
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,967
<i>Because when you start
a relationship with somebody...</i>

437
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,871
- Don't make a big deal of it, okay?
- It is a big deal.

438
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,637
In a minute,
you'll have it set up down at Lamp

439
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,474
and be playing like you never stopped.

440
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:49,637
- Right?
- It's brand-new, this relationship.

441
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:51,739
- I don't want this relationship to end.
- Do you know where it is?

442
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:53,943
- No, I can't do that.
- Just leave that there. I'll drive you.

443
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,177
<i>I have my cart there.
I could get it in my cart.</i>

444
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,311
What are you doing?
You're gonna let go.

445
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,445
- Just let your fingers go.
- Does anyone...

446
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:58,545
Does anyone see
what he's doing right here?

447
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,217
- He's stealing it.
- I'II... I'll meet you there.

448
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,952
San Julian and 6th.

449
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,391
All right?

450
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:08,393
- I'll drive. You walk.
- I know where it is...

451
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,400
See you in a half hour?

452
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,186
For cash money
I got speed, man.

453
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:31,550
I'm good.

454
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,827
Jesus.

455
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,630
Fine.

456
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,501
<i>Tennis shoes.</i>

457
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,840
Oh, boy.

458
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:13,123
One at a time. One at a time.

459
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,500
<i>The pusher. Ten cents.</i>

460
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:27,009
- Say, hey, is David here?
- Yes?

461
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:30,706
I'm here for David.

462
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,043
- Who?
- David.

463
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:34,083
David? I can go get him.

464
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,514
<i>Thanks.</i>

465
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:40,956
David!

466
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,117
Hey.

467
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,931
- Hi.
- Hi. You a volunteer?

468
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,065
<i>Steve Lopez, Los Angeles Times.</i>

469
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,608
<i>- Don't be scared. Come in.
- Thanks.</i>

470
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:02,610
Every staff has a key,

471
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:05,547
so if he does come by and I'm not here,
then anybody can get it for him.

472
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:06,981
- Well, he'll be here.
- Okay.

473
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,039
He said he was coming.

474
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,847
Can you sign in for me?

475
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,547
<i>- Sure.
- Thanks.</i>

476
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,489
- Afternoon.
- Hi. How are you?

477
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,994
I mean, it's tired.
It's like they can't find the medication

478
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,496
that's right for me, you know?

479
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,429
- You know what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

480
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,094
When they put me on lithium,

481
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,036
<i>it was like a portion of my brain</i>

482
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,130
was fully functional.

483
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,672
You know what I mean?

484
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,378
Because it's like when I take
the lithium and everything,

485
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,847
it totally eliminates
the voices in my mind

486
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,713
<i>when they first start rising up,</i>

487
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,380
you know, and it stops them, right there.

488
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:46,422
I don't like that,
because they just stop them.

489
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:49,755
<i>Because, see, sometimes
those voices comfort me.</i>

490
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,592
<i>And when they comfort me,
if they give me all this lithium,</i>

491
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,291
<i>then I no longer have the voices
to comfort me.</i>

492
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,697
You understand what I'm saying?

493
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,201
Do you feel what I'm saying to you?

494
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,972
- You mind if I sit here?
- Not at all.

495
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:08,068
All right.

496
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,135
- I'm Steve.
- I'm Steve, too.

497
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:11,510
Oh, boy. Hi.

498
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:14,880
- I knew I picked the right spot.
- Yeah, you're good.

499
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,346
So are you a new Lamp staff, or...

500
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,155
- No. I'm just waiting for somebody.
- Okay.

501
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:30,456
I just try to keep Leeann happy.

502
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,128
He is a bright spot in my life.
We value the same things.

503
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,637
<i>And we're comfortable together.</i>

504
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:40,164
<i>Thank you, Leeann.
That's so nice to hear you say that.</i>

505
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,137
I call him Piggy Boy and stuff like that,

506
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:45,876
but I shouldn't,
because he's in a bad shape.

507
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:48,077
We thought his problem was cocaine.

508
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,177
- But it was pancreatic cancer.
- Yeah?

509
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:53,586
KK's French, Egyptian,
and African-American,

510
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,454
<i>and I am a quarter French.</i>

511
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:57,925
<i>I know about disease.
I know how to treat it.</i>

512
00:39:57,994 --> 00:40:00,793
Now I understand people.
I can help so many people fast,

513
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:01,922
<i>and I can comfort them.</i>

514
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:05,365
<i>They've got Italian nurses, 6'4",
in the county hospital.</i>

515
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,494
And one of them talked to me
like I was trash.

516
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,735
Now, this is probably that the hour
of power that the Bible speaks of,

517
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,800
somebody who speaks a harsh
language, will have what the computer...

518
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:16,210
<i>The computer is probably the beast.</i>

519
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,179
My aunt ended up with
26 shock treatments

520
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:19,375
because she didn't want to go to bed

521
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:20,677
with her sex-crazed husband.

522
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,275
He was paying call girls $200 apiece,

523
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:24,615
going to bed with them
and coming home

524
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,315
and giving my aunt all kinds of diseases.

525
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:28,414
I got sick. I was working over there.

526
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,893
And I got sicker than a dog one day.
I got an infection in my esophagus.

527
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:35,159
<i>The neighbor's dog was sick one day
and the only thing I had on hand</i>

528
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:37,996
was a packet of tetracycline
for my chickens.

529
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,594
<i>So they wouldn't... They were too busy
to treat her at the moment.</i>

530
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,105
<i>- You're fantastic.
- They'd already given her...</i>

531
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,815
Ice cold. Ice cold.

532
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:58,251
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

533
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:03,519
<i>I put Nathaniel's new instruments
in safekeeping and waited.</i>

534
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,862
<i>Fifteen minutes.
Thirty minutes. An hour.</i>

535
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,967
<i>Too long, in fact,
'cause guess what, schmuck,</i>

536
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,940
<i>you got a deadline tomorrow.</i>

537
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:22,677
<i>And the story of a guy not showing up</i>

538
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,407
<i>is not a story.</i>

539
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:28,773
<i>Nathaniel. Nathaniel. Nathaniel.</i>

540
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,900
Okay.

541
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:11,827
So, you guys are basically united
by non-belief.

542
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,427
<i>- That's right.
- Yeah.</i>

543
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,465
So, do you non-gather?

544
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:18,724
And non-worship?

545
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,666
We tried, but...

546
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:25,304
- Not a lot to talk about.
- Yeah.

547
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,003
- Now we have a website.
- Swell.

548
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:33,512
Anything else you don't believe in?

549
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,074
- Sorry.
- Yeah, actually...

550
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,847
- Sorry.
- Okay.

551
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,115
<i>- Lopez.
- Can you hear this?</i>

552
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:40,315
Sorry, can't hear you.

553
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,552
<i>I said, can you hear this?</i>

554
00:42:57,574 --> 00:43:00,567
<i>This family thinks it can have
this conversation at every step.</i>

555
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,693
<i>This is my apartment.
This is my apartment.</i>

556
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:00,929
<i>This is my apartment.</i>

557
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,802
<i>Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Junior.
N- A- T-H- A...</i>

558
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,369
- I need Charles for the practice.
... because you're so good.

559
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,534
I am so good, but I still have
to tweak things so I can win.

560
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:43,039
<i>There's a fine line in performances.</i>

561
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:45,547
- I mean, I can't let her beat me.
- I really have to practice.

562
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,277
Half an hour is all it takes for me.

563
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,875
Half an hour.

564
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,382
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

565
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,556
<i>- Nathaniel.
- Nathaniel.</i>

566
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,925
<i>- Nathaniel.
- Nathaniel?</i>

567
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:01,987
<i>- Nathaniel.
- Nathaniel.</i>

568
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:06,333
<i>- Nathaniel Ayers.

569
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:08,427
<i>- Nathaniel. Nathaniel.
- Nathaniel.</i>

570
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:09,829
<i>- Ayers!
- Nathaniel!</i>

571
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,737
Ma, I'm good, honestly, it's just that...

572
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:15,942
<i>- I'm real proud of you, baby.
- Thank you.</i>

573
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:21,280
It's just that I'm not always so sure
I know what's going on, and...

574
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:23,744
<i>You are gonna be fine.</i>

575
00:45:24,353 --> 00:45:26,083
It's so frightening, and...

576
00:45:26,155 --> 00:45:29,648
<i>And I'm having trouble
differentiating certain things.</i>

577
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,217
<i>Keeping things separated.</i>

578
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,893
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

579
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:37,092
<i>If you need help...</i>

580
00:45:44,373 --> 00:45:46,864
<i>- That's where your pain is stored.

581
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,443
<i>- Nathaniel. Nathaniel.
- Paint your chest white.</i>

582
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:53,244
<i>Protect her from the pain.</i>

583
00:45:53,382 --> 00:45:54,440
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

584
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,009
<i>I'll be here to protect you from the pain.</i>

585
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:59,612
<i>- I'll protect you from the pain.
- I'll protect you from the pain.</i>

586
00:45:59,722 --> 00:46:01,190
<i>I'll protect you from the pain.</i>

587
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:04,090
<i>I'll protect you from their eyes and ears.</i>

588
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,753
Nathaniel.

589
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,456
Are you finding this piece to be
beyond your abilities?

590
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,523
<i>They're listening to you, Nathaniel.</i>

591
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,693
<i>They can hear your thoughts, Nathaniel.</i>

592
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,829
<i>- I can hear your thoughts, Nathaniel.
- Well, then I suggest you do better.</i>

593
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:18,067
<i>They can hear your thoughts, Nathaniel.</i>

594
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:20,076
<i>- Don't think, Nathaniel.
- Bar 279, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

595
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:32,411
<i>- Run away, Nathaniel.
- Run away, Nathaniel.</i>

596
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,251
<i>Run away, Nathaniel.</i>

597
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,554
<i>- Come on. Run.
- You should run.</i>

598
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:38,322
<i>- You'll have to hide, Nathaniel.
- Run!</i>

599
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:40,829
<i>- You'll never get out of there.
- You'll never get out of there.</i>

600
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,628
<i>- Run! Run! Run!
- You'll never get out.</i>

601
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:46,065
<i>- Quick, like a jackrabbit.
- Nathaniel.</i>

602
00:46:46,135 --> 00:46:48,103
<i>They're white, heartless, aren't they?</i>

603
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,365
<i>- Heartless.
- Hide.</i>

604
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:50,735
<i>Hide for me here, Nathaniel.</i>

605
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,275
<i>We see you, Nathaniel.</i>

606
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:55,139
<i>- They'll see you, Nathaniel.
- Whiteness.</i>

607
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:56,644
<i>- There's no hiding, Nathaniel.
- Whiteness.</i>

608
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,240
<i>You'll never hide well enough.</i>

609
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,474
<i>...turn you white...
- Whiteness!</i>

610
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,643
<i>- No hiding for you, Nathaniel.
- Whiteness. Whiteness.</i>

611
00:47:01,717 --> 00:47:03,242
<i>Whiteness.</i>

612
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,478
You'll take it,
because I want my out.

613
00:47:36,552 --> 00:47:38,543
Detroit? Anger management.

614
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:40,146
It's amazing, right?

615
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,690
Does it look like
I need some anger management to you?

616
00:47:41,757 --> 00:47:43,452
Yeah. Man, I'll take him any day.

617
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,722
He quiets everybody down.

618
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:49,061
- What does he have, schizophrenia?
- I don't know.

619
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:54,431
Well, we should hook him up with
psychiatric services and find out, right?

620
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:57,405
Yeah, I don't get
too hung up on diagnosis.

621
00:47:57,907 --> 00:47:59,876
What do you mean?

622
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:00,931
What do I mean?

623
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:05,038
But how do you help somebody
if you don't know what they have?

624
00:48:05,548 --> 00:48:07,244
Look at these people.

625
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:10,217
Every one of them's been diagnosed
more than you can imagine.

626
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:12,481
And as far as I can tell,
it hasn't done them any good.

627
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:15,088
But he needs medication, right?

628
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:17,786
I'll tell you one thing he doesn't need.

629
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,023
One more person telling him
he needs medication.

630
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,726
Son of a bitch.

631
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,532
- Where'd he go?
- Who?

632
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,903
- Nathaniel.
- Don't ask me, dude.

633
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,373
<i>- Thanks, Steve.
- You're welcome, Steve.</i>

634
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:43,677
<i>- Keep walking. Keep walking!
- There's a cop over there.</i>

635
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:46,449
- He'll shoot a nigga with a pop.
- You got that cheese, huh?

636
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,389
- You're right about that cheese.
- Hold on, hold on. Hold up.

637
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:51,759
Hey, wait!

638
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,364
Want to buy some candy?

639
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:57,121
Five-o. Five-o.

640
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,789
No way this is gonna be...

641
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,393
<i>That boy's not the real police.</i>

642
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:07,733
Oh, man.
Hell, man. Where's my piece at, nigga?

643
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,579
Back up.

644
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:58,277
I went over to the library.

645
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,652
I thought I might pick up
some sheet music.

646
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:01,782
<i>Sonata Number 1, F Major, Opus 5,</i>

647
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,827
<i>Sonata Number 2 in A Major,
Opus 69 for String Quartet.</i>

648
00:51:04,894 --> 00:51:06,226
What happened?
Somebody get beat up?

649
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:07,353
Overdose, I think.

650
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,063
<i>The other night, someone...
There was a beating over here.</i>

651
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:13,260
Someone got bones rearranged
in their face. It was just crazy.

652
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:17,204
I don't understand why anybody
would do something like that.

653
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:19,572
<i>- This where you sleep?
- I used to sleep on Wall Street,</i>

654
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,474
<i>but it's too dirty.</i>

655
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,057
You know, Mr. Lopez, my vision...

656
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,655
I hate to admit it, but I'm gonna have
to be like Beethoven.

657
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:47,862
<i>Just do what he did and just die.
Thank you, Mr. Lopez.</i>

658
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,429
My vision is not far-off stuff,

659
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,940
just basically getting
across the street safely.

660
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,498
Honor thy father and mother,
and then, hopefully,

661
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:57,411
the music will take care of itself.

662
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,777
<i>That's really all you can do.</i>

663
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,213
I mean, when you think about it,

664
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:02,443
there's not much that
you can do other than that.

665
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:05,248
- Would you care for a drink?
- I'm fine.

666
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:08,389
<i>Thanks.</i>

667
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,760
Gotta tuck this guy in here,
nice and safe.

668
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,431
Put that down there.
Make sure this corner...

669
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,626
You can rest on this.

670
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,538
Do you think of writers often, Mr. Lopez?

671
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:31,137
Do you think of writers
the way I think about musicians?

672
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,617
I write for a living,

673
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:40,780
and it's not like it used to be.

674
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,922
I love thinking about musicians.

675
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,623
<i>I imagine Beethoven and Mozart
in that window where the light is,</i>

676
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:51,690
and they just hunger and they thirst
like we do.

677
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:54,592
It's angelic.

678
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,137
I believe these children of God are
gonna be okay tonight.

679
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:02,143
<i>They're gonna sleep and dream
as humans do.</i>

680
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:29,336
Our Father,

681
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,637
<i>who art in Heaven,</i>

682
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:37,577
hallowed be thy name.

683
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,612
<i>Thy kingdom come,</i>

684
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,420
<i>thy will be done,</i>

685
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,757
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

686
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,005
<i>Give us this day our daily bread...</i>

687
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:06,666
<i>Just keep it coming. There's plenty.</i>

688
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:10,907
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

689
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:14,007
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

690
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:21,219
<i>I knew only part of his story.</i>

691
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,521
<i>I knew him playing the violin
on a dairy crate in the morning sun,</i>

692
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,996
<i>suspended somewhere between
boy genius and lost traveler.</i>

693
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,862
<i>Every night, my friend Nathaniel tucks
his instruments away</i>

694
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:36,268
<i>and lays his head
among the predators and hustlers,</i>

695
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:39,364
<i>among fallen drunks
sprawled in the streets,</i>

696
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:44,277
<i>as rats the size of meatloaves dart
out of the drains to feed off the squalor.</i>

697
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:54,320
<i>...lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</i>

698
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:58,384
<i>For thine is the kingdom,</i>

699
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,661
<i>the power and the glory,</i>

700
00:55:06,268 --> 00:55:07,759
forever.

701
00:55:10,472 --> 00:55:11,565
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

702
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,509
<i>I tell him this is no place for him.
He says he wants to be here.</i>

703
00:55:15,577 --> 00:55:18,307
<i>He says this is his choice.</i>

704
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,317
<i>Should I take him at his word,
or should I try to force him inside?</i>

705
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,478
<i>Wouldn't a little arm-twisting be
more humane</i>

706
00:55:25,554 --> 00:55:27,079
<i>than leaving him here on the streets</i>

707
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:31,115
<i>in this lost colony of broken,
helpless souls?</i>

708
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:34,929
I hope you sleep well, Mr. Lopez.

709
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,534
I hope the whole world sleeps well.

710
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,543
A- D-A-M C-R-A-N-E.
He wants to meet you.

711
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:56,641
Who?

712
00:55:57,452 --> 00:56:00,547
The guy from the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, Adam Crane.

713
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:02,317
Wondering if you wanna come
hear a concert

714
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:05,791
at Disney Hall some time as his guest.

715
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,452
They're doing Beethoven.

716
00:56:07,528 --> 00:56:11,295
- Ludwig van?
- Beethoven, all season long.

717
00:56:11,365 --> 00:56:12,958
<i>They got one coming up. The Third.</i>

718
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:16,061
<i>- Well, what's the date today?
- No, the Third Symphony.</i>

719
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:20,201
I'll cause a scene.
I don't wanna cause a scene.

720
00:56:20,275 --> 00:56:21,708
I don't wanna stick out
or anything like that.

721
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:24,574
So it's just...
It's impossible. It can't happen.

722
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:31,684
What if I could get us in for a rehearsal?

723
00:56:44,398 --> 00:56:46,264
Nathaniel, let's go.

724
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,528
What I did with the keys right here...

725
00:56:47,603 --> 00:56:48,797
Come on. Lock up the cart.

726
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:50,269
- No. You know what, Mr. Lopez?
- Come on, we gotta go.

727
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:51,532
I can't leave my stuff here
with these rascals.

728
00:56:51,606 --> 00:56:52,699
They can't be trusted.
They'll do anything.

729
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:54,969
Oh, no. We have an entire orchestra
waiting for us. We are gonna go.

730
00:56:55,043 --> 00:56:56,304
They have drug addicts
and cigarette smokers here,

731
00:56:56,378 --> 00:56:57,572
and they will steal all of what I have.

732
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,135
- No one is going to steal your shit.
- I can't leave it.

733
00:56:59,213 --> 00:57:00,407
No, no. We have to get in touch
with the mayor...

734
00:57:00,481 --> 00:57:01,949
- Nathaniel, it's garbage.
... Antonio Villaraigosa...

735
00:57:02,016 --> 00:57:03,677
...or the president.
- No one is gonna steal this garbage.

736
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:05,117
- In the corner...
- No, no, no, Mr. Lopez,

737
00:57:05,186 --> 00:57:06,653
I'm not gonna be
able to make it up there.

738
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:07,847
Okay. Oh, boy.

739
00:57:07,922 --> 00:57:10,186
<i>Fantasia. Walt Disney Hall.
Donald Duck.</i>

740
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:11,791
I have to deal with things here

741
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,726
because I wouldn't leave a dog
with these people here.

742
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:15,922
Right. Okay. Fine.

743
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:17,362
A cockroach does not tell a greyhound
what to do.

744
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:22,027
It's fine! Do you understand? It's fine.

745
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:25,766
I do not give a smooth fart
if we go or not. Do you understand?

746
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,605
There are a million other things
I could be doing right now.

747
00:57:28,677 --> 00:57:30,702
Obligations,
things that people pay me to do.

748
00:57:30,778 --> 00:57:33,543
I have a job. I'm a professional person.

749
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:49,086
- Sorry.
- All right.

750
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:50,358
What?

751
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:55,128
Still not gonna leave my cart here.

752
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:58,967
Okay.

753
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:02,201
Pick a side.

754
00:58:02,476 --> 00:58:05,445
The company is offering you
a very generous exit package.

755
00:58:05,514 --> 00:58:06,503
Yeah.

756
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:09,210
- I understand how difficult this is.
- Wait!

757
00:58:09,952 --> 00:58:10,976
Right.

758
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:14,420
Unfortunately, this is the reality
of our business.

759
00:58:17,025 --> 00:58:19,960
Nathaniel, hard left
coming up right here.

760
00:58:37,378 --> 00:58:39,047
Mr. Lopez, are you okay?

761
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,289
How long has it been
since you've been in a concert hall?

762
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:01,092
This is great.

763
00:59:03,137 --> 00:59:04,331
There's the conductor.

764
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:16,244
- Just us.
- Yeah, just us.

765
00:59:17,686 --> 00:59:19,778
It's the way it should be.

766
01:01:35,757 --> 01:01:38,920
- He's in the room.
- Who is?

767
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:40,358
Beethoven.

768
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,025
Sing the hate out!

769
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:49,197
Stop.

770
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:51,632
- All right.
- Strong finish!

771
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:52,730
Get up there.

772
01:01:56,577 --> 01:01:59,478
I'm telling you,
it was such an unbelievable experience,

773
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:02,744
the whole thing, the whole day.

774
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:07,221
And if you had seen him,
if you could have felt him...

775
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:08,585
I mean, it's the same hall.

776
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:11,887
We're listening to the same
goddamn music, but... But no.

777
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,893
You see him, it's one thing,
but you feel him...

778
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:15,623
I'm watching him.
He's watching the music.

779
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:17,391
And while they're playing, I say,

780
01:02:17,465 --> 01:02:19,865
"My God, there is something
higher out there.

781
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:22,768
"Something higher out there,
and he lives in it, and he's with it. "

782
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:26,329
I've never even experienced it,
but I can tell...

783
01:02:26,407 --> 01:02:29,639
I don't even know
what you fucking call it.

784
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:33,043
- Grace.
- What? What is it?

785
01:02:33,114 --> 01:02:36,675
- Grace.
- All right. That's grace?

786
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:39,981
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Yeah.

787
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:47,592
To be there with him like that

788
01:02:47,661 --> 01:02:51,358
and see the way that he is transported.
He surrenders.

789
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:53,994
Damn it, honey.

790
01:02:54,068 --> 01:02:58,005
I mean, I've never loved anything
the way that he loves music.

791
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:06,806
Hey, come on.
I'm thinking about my day.

792
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:08,610
I'm thinking about my day.
I wasn't thinking about you.

793
01:03:08,682 --> 01:03:10,981
That I believe, honey.

794
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:13,518
Call the mayor.
He's been trying to reach you.

795
01:03:13,588 --> 01:03:15,215
- Which mayor?
- The mayor!

796
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:16,847
Okay.

797
01:03:29,271 --> 01:03:30,295
Call the mayor.

798
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:33,467
Thank you.

You can't. Sorry.

830
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:09,465
I don't mind that at all, Mr. Lopez.
Not at all.

831
01:05:09,536 --> 01:05:13,438
You understand, right?
It's a... It's a thing. Policy.

832
01:05:16,945 --> 01:05:20,346
- I'll be over here if you need me.
- Over there?

833
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:23,849
Okay. You all right?

834
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:29,246
Yeah, I just... You know, I... Yeah.

835
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:33,021
Sorry. I gotta...

836
01:05:36,197 --> 01:05:39,291
All right, Mr. Lopez, I completely
understand that you're working.

837
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:41,891
You're working. You have to work.
People have to work.

838
01:05:41,969 --> 01:05:44,164
All right, get out of the way
when people are working,

839
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:45,603
because you don't wanna
stand out there

840
01:05:45,673 --> 01:05:47,766
in front of people,
especially not Mr. Lopez.

841
01:05:47,842 --> 01:05:50,538
You stand in front of Mr. Lopez,
he's gonna tell you to get out of here.

842
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:52,545
So, it's a lot of work.

843
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:56,242
<i>- I think he's good. You know, I really do.
- I'm sure...</i>

844
01:05:56,317 --> 01:06:00,275
I mean, I just... This is great.
I think... I think it'll really help.

845
01:06:00,355 --> 01:06:02,289
I feel like you are exactly what he needs.

846
01:06:02,356 --> 01:06:03,380
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

847
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,619
<i>- Does that make sense?
- Yes, it does.</i>

848
01:06:07,561 --> 01:06:10,860
<i>- Graham Claydon. Thank you.
- At your service.</i>

849
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:15,161
All we need is a place for them to meet
and rehearse, like an apartment.

850
01:06:15,269 --> 01:06:17,260
You're asking for an apartment
for Nathaniel?

851
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:20,431
- Yeah.
- Does he want an apartment? Thanks.

852
01:06:20,507 --> 01:06:24,103
- Yes.
- And he told you this?

853
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:27,079
- Yes.
- You're so full of shit, Lopez.

854
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:29,744
- I don't want an apartment.
- Good, 'cause it's not.

855
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:31,251
It's actually a music studio

856
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:33,150
for Mr. Claydon to give you
the cello lessons.

857
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:35,121
Well, why don't we have Mr. Claydon
come down here?

858
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,315
This is a perfect place to play in,
the tunnel.

859
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:37,380
No, Mr. Claydon doesn't like tunnels.

860
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:38,949
We'll just have Mr. Claydon come here
to do the lesson.

861
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:40,425
- He says it has to be quiet.
- Well...

862
01:06:40,494 --> 01:06:42,690
It has to be quiet for the cello lessons,
so your apartment...

863
01:06:42,764 --> 01:06:43,788
It's not my apartment.

864
01:06:43,864 --> 01:06:45,764
I know. I know. The apartment
that belongs to no one.

865
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,664
I don't have an apartment.
I don't wanna be in an apartment.

866
01:06:47,735 --> 01:06:48,827
I don't need an apartment.

867
01:06:48,902 --> 01:06:50,063
Beethoven lives out
in the freshness of the air.

868
01:06:50,137 --> 01:06:51,161
Nathaniel, the apartment
is not the point.

869
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:52,501
He's the leader of Los Angeles.

870
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:54,474
- It's an opportunity.
- "Angeles" means "angels. " You can't...

871
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:56,202
- You can't hold down angels.
- Do you want the opportunity?

872
01:06:56,277 --> 01:06:57,266
- You can't clip angels.
- Stop.

873
01:06:57,344 --> 01:07:01,179
- Do you want an opportunity or not?
- Do you have an apartment?

874
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:07,849
No. I have a house.

875
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:19,523
So angry. Yelling.

876
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:22,436
It doesn't make sense.

877
01:07:46,126 --> 01:07:48,617
- Do you have a family?
- What?

878
01:07:48,695 --> 01:07:50,664
Are you a married man?

879
01:07:52,032 --> 01:07:54,262
- Is there a Mrs. Steve Lopez?
- No.

880
01:07:56,103 --> 01:08:00,335
I did. Mary. But we split up.

881
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:05,342
We have a son, Thomas.
He's in college now.

882
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:09,076
Mr. Steve Lopez, Mr. Thomas
Steve Lopez, Mrs. Mary Steve Lopez.

883
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:13,052
Not Mrs. Lopez. Mary Weston.

884
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:17,921
- Mrs. Mary Weston Steve Lopez.
- No. Just Mary Weston. Period.

885
01:08:17,992 --> 01:08:21,984
We were married. We're not anymore,
so now she's just Mary.

886
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:25,998
You were married to Mary,
but you're not married to Mary anymore.

887
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:29,036
Correct. Don't ask me how.

888
01:08:31,405 --> 01:08:35,034
Mrs. Floria Ayers, Miss Jennifer Ayers.

889
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:37,872
And then there was
Mr. Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Sr.

890
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:40,176
He was a big man. He had big hands.

891
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:43,479
I have very small hands.

892
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,349
Fit around a violin, a cello.

893
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:51,948
Mr. Ayers was a big man,
but he wasn't a god.

894
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:55,920
I have my god.

895
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:57,395
Mr. Steve Lopez.

896
01:08:57,465 --> 01:08:58,453
Oh, boy.

897
01:08:58,533 --> 01:09:00,023
Yeah, you're my god.
Flying around high.

898
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,796
- You're my god.
- I'm not comfortable being your god.

899
01:09:01,869 --> 01:09:03,167
Mr. Steve Lopez, staff writer,
you are my god.

900
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:04,899
- That it? I'm your god?
- Yes, you are. You're my god.

901
01:09:04,972 --> 01:09:07,305
All right. I am your god.

902
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,864
And as your god,

903
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:11,844
I command you to be at Lamp,
2:00 p. m., one week from today

904
01:09:11,912 --> 01:09:15,212
for a cello lesson. Done deal.

905
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:20,480
And it's a really sweet deal, too.

906
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:22,886
'Cause if you show up,
I will grant you eternal life.

907
01:09:22,957 --> 01:09:25,585
Hell, I might even make you a disciple.

908
01:09:25,659 --> 01:09:28,322
If you don't, you're on your own.

909
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:31,225
<i>This is my apartment.
This is my apartment.</i>

910
01:09:31,298 --> 01:09:32,663
<i>This is my apartment.</i>

911
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:34,224
<i>This is my apartment.
This is my apartment.</i>

912
01:09:34,301 --> 01:09:35,496
<i>This is my apartment.</i>

913
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:36,695
<i>Always number one.
Always number two.</i>

914
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:37,896
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

915
01:09:37,971 --> 01:09:39,599
<i>We've always been here,
Nathaniel Ayers.</i>

916
01:09:39,673 --> 01:09:42,006
<i>I've always been with you, Nathaniel.</i>

917
01:09:42,076 --> 01:09:45,045
<i>I'll never leave you, Nathaniel.
I love you, Nathaniel.</i>

918
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:47,137
<i>- I love you.
- No one else loves you, Nathaniel.</i>

919
01:09:47,215 --> 01:09:49,944
<i>But I love you, Nathaniel.
I'll protect you, Nathaniel.</i>

920
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:53,078
<i>When you fell from Heaven,
they laughed at you, Nathaniel.</i>

921
01:09:53,154 --> 01:09:56,715
<i>You're my heart, Nathaniel.
I do love you, Nathaniel.</i>

922
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,917
<i>We'll be together forever, Nathaniel.</i>

923
01:09:58,993 --> 01:10:00,016
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

924
01:10:00,094 --> 01:10:01,993
<i>Look, I'll be here
to protect you from the pain.</i>

925
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:05,122
<i>- I'll be here to protect you from the pain.
- Fibber. You fibber. You fib.</i>

926
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:06,496
<i>I'll protect you from the noise.</i>

927
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:08,000
Fear for you. Fear for you.

928
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:09,695
<i>I'll protect you from their beady eyes.</i>

929
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,829
<i>- I'll be here to obey.
- I'll protect you from their eyes.</i>

930
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:15,966
<i>- Step right, Nathaniel.
- No one else loves you, Nathaniel.</i>

931
01:10:16,043 --> 01:10:17,568
<i>You're my boy, Nathaniel.</i>

932
01:10:17,645 --> 01:10:20,306
<i>- Take off the shoes.
- I'll protect you. I'll protect you.</i>

933
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:22,610
No one can kill the child.
That's what the child is about.

934
01:10:22,684 --> 01:10:23,877
Forget you. Jump off!

935
01:10:43,203 --> 01:10:44,193
Come on.

936
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:47,635
Hey. Look at that.

937
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:52,145
Don't see those on the street.
Quick right.

938
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:55,109
And then, and then...
And then right again, right here.

939
01:10:55,182 --> 01:10:58,345
Nathaniel. Come on down.

940
01:10:58,418 --> 01:11:02,912
What are you... Come on. We go down
here and then to the end and left.

941
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:04,515
I think we should do the lesson out here.

942
01:11:04,591 --> 01:11:06,957
No, no, no. It's just this way. Come on.

943
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:09,154
Mr. Lopez... Mr. Lopez.

944
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:11,220
Mr. Lopez, I really think
we should do it out here.

945
01:11:11,298 --> 01:11:14,324
No, come on. Let's have a look.
It's right down here.

946
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:15,868
Mr. Lopez.

947
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,033
Nathaniel, come on.

948
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:20,100
It's really clean.

949
01:11:23,344 --> 01:11:25,140
Come check it out.

950
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:30,412
We should do it out here. It's better.
I'm more comfortable out here.

951
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:36,621
Looks nice.

952
01:11:38,792 --> 01:11:40,158
Looks nice.

953
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:46,899
It's nice.

954
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:24,328
Come on. You can do it.

955
01:12:49,096 --> 01:12:50,359
Hey.

956
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:56,061
I can't live here.

957
01:12:56,136 --> 01:12:58,537
I'll give you a hand with that.

958
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:02,569
Got it.

959
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:07,270
Oh, boy. Let's get this in nice.

960
01:13:10,318 --> 01:13:11,376
Good.

961
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:17,715
It's great, right?

962
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:20,386
I mean, I like it. What do you think?

963
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:25,796
It's nice. It's clean.
The bathroom's better than...

964
01:13:28,002 --> 01:13:29,525
Except for him.

965
01:13:29,604 --> 01:13:31,230
I don't wanna die in here.

966
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:32,567
Don't...

967
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,731
Somebody could just come in here
and kill me...

968
01:13:33,807 --> 01:13:35,707
- You'll be fine. Nathaniel?
... and take all of my belongings.

969
01:13:35,775 --> 01:13:37,300
- Nathaniel, the door locks.
- A fly only lives 12 days.

970
01:13:37,377 --> 01:13:39,971
What if in 12 days, someone walks
through that door and murders me?

971
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:41,742
And I don't care
about this Claydon thing, either.

972
01:13:41,815 --> 01:13:43,646
Walt Disney Hall. Disney Duck.

973
01:13:43,717 --> 01:13:45,015
Doesn't make a difference.
I don't need any of that.

974
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:47,145
If I'm gonna take a lesson,
I should take the lesson in the tunnel

975
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:50,155
where I can hear the city sounds
and not be locked off from life,

976
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:51,350
locked off from the world.

977
01:13:51,425 --> 01:13:53,722
In the tunnel I can hear the music
the way it's supposed to be played.

978
01:13:53,793 --> 01:13:55,318
Not in this place, there's no city sounds,

979
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:58,057
there's no Beethoven,
there's no Los Angeles, California.

980
01:13:58,131 --> 01:13:59,622
I don't belong here.

981
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:01,030
I'm never coming here again.

982
01:14:32,132 --> 01:14:34,123
Nathaniel, that's Graham Claydon.

983
01:14:35,802 --> 01:14:37,532
Pleased to meet you, Nathaniel.

984
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:41,569
I always love meeting a fellow musician.

985
01:14:44,145 --> 01:14:46,113
I brought you something.

986
01:14:46,314 --> 01:14:49,010
I know you're partial to Beethoven,

987
01:14:49,082 --> 01:14:51,643
so I thought you'd enjoy this,

988
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:57,323
because, you know,
without Johann Sebastian

989
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:00,622
there would be no Ludwig van.

990
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:19,279
The A, the D, the A, the D, the A, the D.

991
01:15:21,181 --> 01:15:23,810
Steady. Don't rush it. Don't rush it.

992
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:31,121
And...

993
01:15:35,529 --> 01:15:37,520
Well, for someone who hasn't had
a lesson in three decades,

994
01:15:37,597 --> 01:15:39,690
you play quite beautifully.

995
01:15:40,134 --> 01:15:41,328
Thank you.

996
01:15:41,402 --> 01:15:42,595
- So...
- Thank you.

997
01:15:42,703 --> 01:15:45,228
Work on a smoother rhythm
with the right hand.

998
01:15:45,305 --> 01:15:47,796
And don't stop-start.

999
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:50,365
Carry a phrase all the way through.

1000
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:51,600
- Great.
- Give you a ride uptown?

1001
01:15:51,712 --> 01:15:53,202
- Thank you.
- Mr. Claydon?

1002
01:15:54,081 --> 01:15:55,980
- Yes.
- Sir?

1003
01:15:57,885 --> 01:16:00,376
Do you think I could be good again?

1004
01:16:02,555 --> 01:16:04,046
Yes, I do.

1005
01:16:06,961 --> 01:16:09,485
I like your apartment, by the way.

1006
01:16:09,896 --> 01:16:11,421
- It's not my apartment.
- It's not. It's just a...

1007
01:16:11,498 --> 01:16:12,658
I don't live here.

1008
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:14,296
Well, you should.

1009
01:16:15,836 --> 01:16:19,567
God has blessed you
with a gift, Nathaniel.

1010
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,871
Nothing pains God more
than when we squander his blessings.

1011
01:16:23,144 --> 01:16:25,612
- You owe it to him to care for this...
- I don't owe God.

1012
01:16:28,048 --> 01:16:30,176
Mr. Steve Lopez is my god.

1013
01:16:30,484 --> 01:16:32,145
- What?
- Star writer for Los Angeles.

1014
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:34,448
Higher power flying around
with wings like an angel.

1015
01:16:34,521 --> 01:16:36,921
Mr. Steve Lopez is my...

1016
01:16:37,557 --> 01:16:38,582
He doesn't know what he's saying.

1017
01:16:38,658 --> 01:16:40,786
Mr. Graham Claydon is going to tell me
who my god is?

1018
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:41,850
Down by the car?

1019
01:16:41,929 --> 01:16:43,157
Do you know who my god is,
Mr. Claydon?

1020
01:16:43,296 --> 01:16:45,060
I know who my god is!

1021
01:16:45,131 --> 01:16:46,155
- He's a good teacher.
- I know who my god is.

1022
01:16:46,233 --> 01:16:47,494
You should accept his help gracefully.

1023
01:16:47,568 --> 01:16:49,331
Graceful is the ballerinas at Juilliard.

1024
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,135
Those girls were graceful.

1025
01:16:51,204 --> 01:16:53,832
- Tiny ballerinas just twirling round.
- There's other people in this...

1026
01:16:54,774 --> 01:16:56,173
- Twirling round. Angels.
- All right,

1027
01:16:56,243 --> 01:16:58,369
- graceful as little ballerinas.
- I love them flying around

1028
01:16:58,445 --> 01:17:00,811
like I love Mr. Steve Lopez flying around.

1029
01:17:00,881 --> 01:17:03,042
I love God. I love you!

1030
01:17:10,123 --> 01:17:11,454
I love you.

1031
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:15,854
I don't want him to love me.

1032
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,091
Well, it looks like
you might have to get over that.

1033
01:17:18,164 --> 01:17:19,426
It's a bad idea.

1034
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,467
"I love you, Steve,"
turns into, "You failed me, Steve,"

1035
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:23,365
turns into very bad things.

1036
01:17:23,436 --> 01:17:25,597
That's my limited experience.

1037
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:28,297
I don't want to be on the other side
of that with him. Would you?

1038
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:31,435
He doesn't know if I'm a ballerina,
if I'm God, if I'm an airplane pilot.

1039
01:17:31,511 --> 01:17:34,002
He has no idea what he's saying.

1040
01:17:35,282 --> 01:17:37,408
Is there something you want
from me, Lopez?

1041
01:17:37,618 --> 01:17:39,744
Or did you just come to show me
your prom dress? You look nice.

1042
01:17:39,819 --> 01:17:40,809
I want you to help him

1043
01:17:41,154 --> 01:17:42,679
because he's sick
and he needs medication

1044
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:44,485
and you have a team of doctors here.

1045
01:17:44,557 --> 01:17:46,957
Tell them to sit down with him.
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

1046
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:49,988
Nathaniel's made it quite clear
he's not ready to speak to a psychiatrist.

1047
01:17:50,064 --> 01:17:51,052
Force him.

1048
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:52,256
- Force him?
- Tell him to do it.

1049
01:17:52,332 --> 01:17:53,390
Tell him he can't play his instruments

1050
01:17:53,466 --> 01:17:54,490
until he sits down with a shrink.

1051
01:17:54,568 --> 01:17:58,060
- That's not what we do here.
- What you do here is fucked.

1052
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:01,333
It is.

1053
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:07,475
Look, even if I did wanna
cohorse Nathaniel into psychiatry...

1054
01:18:07,547 --> 01:18:08,912
- Coerce.
... which... Whatever.

1055
01:18:08,983 --> 01:18:10,746
- Coerce.
- Lf I wanted to do that, which I don't,

1056
01:18:10,818 --> 01:18:13,582
I couldn't force him to take medication.

1057
01:18:13,654 --> 01:18:15,917
The law is the law.
Unless he's an imminent danger

1058
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:17,787
to himself or someone else...

1059
01:18:17,858 --> 01:18:19,849
Are you gonna answer that, or what?

1060
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:27,300
I'm in the car. What if he was
a danger to someone else?

1061
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:31,099
- But he's not.
- Mary, I'm on the way. Relax.

1062
01:18:31,171 --> 01:18:33,367
What if someone said he was?

1063
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,568
What if someone dialed 911
and said Nathaniel had attacked him?

1064
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:36,667
They'd put him in psychiatric hospital.

1065
01:18:36,743 --> 01:18:38,644
I know you're not thinking
of lying on him, Lopez.

1066
01:18:38,712 --> 01:18:40,703
And then he would be
in a 14-day psychiatric hold,

1067
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:43,375
they'd put him on meds straight away.

1068
01:18:43,783 --> 01:18:46,252
What if that's all it took
for him to be well?

1069
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:48,720
What if two weeks of meds,
a two-week window

1070
01:18:48,788 --> 01:18:53,418
into what his life could be,
changed his life? Saved his life?

1071
01:18:54,295 --> 01:18:56,819
Why wouldn't you want to be
part of that?

1072
01:18:58,265 --> 01:19:02,929
Steve, Nathaniel has one thing going
for him right now. A friend.

1073
01:19:04,003 --> 01:19:08,440
If you betray that friendship, you destroy
the only thing he has in this world.

1074
01:19:08,509 --> 01:19:10,976
I don't want to be his only thing.

1075
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,516
Didn't you just tell somebody
you was in your car?

1076
01:19:25,192 --> 01:19:27,023
Mary, relax. What table are we at?

1077
01:19:27,094 --> 01:19:29,220
<i>This is Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, Jr.,
Mr. Lopez. I was calling...</i>

1078
01:19:29,296 --> 01:19:30,489
- Nathaniel.
... because you promised me

1079
01:19:30,564 --> 01:19:32,759
a hard case for my cello
and I haven't received it yet.

1080
01:19:32,832 --> 01:19:34,663
<i>- Yeah?
- And also I need sheet music</i>

1081
01:19:34,734 --> 01:19:36,134
<i>for Beethoven's Second Sonata.</i>

1082
01:19:36,203 --> 01:19:39,865
<i>And also Opus 131 and Septet for
strings and woodwinds, and Opus 20...</i>

1083
01:19:39,939 --> 01:19:41,998
Can you just... One sec.

1084
01:19:42,076 --> 01:19:44,976
<i>- ... and also my A string is missing...
- So, we're talking about...</i>

1085
01:19:45,045 --> 01:19:47,479
I need my A string replaced.

1086
01:19:47,547 --> 01:19:50,414
Nathaniel, you know, this is not...

1087
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,180
<i>...his series in the Times
on the struggles and the triumphs</i>

1088
01:19:56,256 --> 01:19:58,452
<i>of Nathaniel Anthony Ayers</i>

1089
01:19:58,525 --> 01:20:01,859
<i>has brought crucial attention to one
of the most pressing issues in our city.</i>

1090
01:20:01,929 --> 01:20:03,555
<i>...promises you should make good
on those promises...</i>

1091
01:20:03,631 --> 01:20:05,154
Get off the phone.

1092
01:20:05,231 --> 01:20:07,996
<i>...to address this problem
with compassion and commitment.</i>

1093
01:20:08,068 --> 01:20:09,091
<i>And in honor of this,</i>

1094
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:13,367
<i>it is my pleasure to present this year's
Media Award to Steve Lopez.</i>

1095
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:16,305
Thank you.

1096
01:20:19,445 --> 01:20:21,913
<i>...you know that I can't leave
my cart anywhere.</i>

1097
01:20:21,981 --> 01:20:25,577
<i>It houses my violin, my cello,
and my weapons of mass destruction.</i>

1098
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:28,645
<i>A child needs protection. You don't want
to put a baby in the trunk of a car</i>

1099
01:20:28,721 --> 01:20:30,882
<i>and have it get bashed up
against the wall.</i>

1100
01:20:30,957 --> 01:20:33,949
<i>Bashed up against the wall.
Bashed up against the wall.</i>

1101
01:20:37,664 --> 01:20:40,690
I got a phone call from Mark Rosenthal
today, remember him?

1102
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:41,859
Book editor?

1103
01:20:41,935 --> 01:20:43,368
Bob Geldof with a crew cut.

1104
01:20:43,436 --> 01:20:46,895
He's been reading your Nathaniel stuff,
thinks it's genius, whatever.

1105
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:50,932
- Whatever.
- Anyway. He said it's a book.

1106
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,235
What did he say exactly?

1107
01:20:53,314 --> 01:20:57,546
"It's personal, it's political, it's timely.
I can sell the shit out of it. "

1108
01:20:57,618 --> 01:21:00,416
- Oh, boy.
- His words, excuse me, not mine.

1109
01:21:00,487 --> 01:21:03,319
Well, it's complicated.
Nathaniel's complicated.

1110
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,051
Well, yeah, he's mentally ill, I mean.

1111
01:21:07,795 --> 01:21:10,457
Right. But beyond that, it's endless.

1112
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:12,761
I just...
I don't want to take full responsibility.

1113
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:15,358
By all means, avoid full responsibility.

1114
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:17,961
Just, you know, keep going
with the partial responsibility

1115
01:21:18,037 --> 01:21:21,201
and exploiting him
like you are now.

1116
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:22,264
You should stop.

1117
01:21:22,342 --> 01:21:23,435
'Cause that's a slippery slope
right there,

1118
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:24,601
Lopez.

1119
01:21:24,677 --> 01:21:26,440
- Stop. Stop.
- One day, you're getting a book...

1120
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:28,242
- Please stop.
... from the guy. And the next,

1121
01:21:28,314 --> 01:21:29,338
he's expecting, I don't know,
some sort of...

1122
01:21:29,416 --> 01:21:30,507
Mary, stop.

1123
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:33,576
...consistency in the relationship.
Screw that, man.

1124
01:21:33,654 --> 01:21:37,055
Who needs that shit, right? My words.

1125
01:21:37,123 --> 01:21:39,057
- You driving?
- No, I have a car.

1126
01:21:39,126 --> 01:21:40,559
And a driver?

1127
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:44,893
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

1128
01:21:44,998 --> 01:21:47,091
It's Nathaniel for you.

1129
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:51,163
<i>...as a youngster labeled mentally ill</i>

1130
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:53,206
<i>because of the underlying
cigarette habit,</i>

1131
01:21:53,273 --> 01:21:55,036
<i>constant disturbance,
constant disturbance.</i>

1132
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:56,939
<i>You know, bigots have children, too.</i>

1133
01:21:57,011 --> 01:21:58,774
<i>Pens from Steve Lopez. Many thanks.</i>

1134
01:21:58,845 --> 01:22:01,279
<i>Constant disturbance,
constant disturbance.</i>

1135
01:22:01,347 --> 01:22:03,372
<i>Bigots have children.
Bigots have children, too.</i>

1136
01:22:03,449 --> 01:22:06,976
<i>Pens... Paper...
Pens from Steve Lopez. Many thanks.</i>

1137
01:22:09,989 --> 01:22:13,618
<i>And a cello from Steve Lopez.
Steve Lopez... Many thanks to that.</i>

1138
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:17,288
<i>Without Steve Lopez,
I wouldn't have any of that...</i>

1139
01:22:17,363 --> 01:22:18,990
<i>Constant disturbance.</i>

1140
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:22,034
<i>Constant disturbance.
Constant disturbances.</i>

1141
01:22:22,301 --> 01:22:25,270
<i>I've had what I think is a beautiful idea.</i>

1142
01:22:25,338 --> 01:22:28,136
<i>I think Nathaniel should give a recital.</i>

1143
01:22:28,975 --> 01:22:32,570
I don't know if I can make that call.
He hasn't been very lucid lately.

1144
01:22:32,645 --> 01:22:34,876
<i>- Right. When is he clearest?
- I don't...</i>

1145
01:22:34,948 --> 01:22:37,381
<i>When is he most able
to focus his thoughts?</i>

1146
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:39,475
<i>- When he's playing.
- Right.</i>

1147
01:22:39,987 --> 01:22:42,751
This could increase his confidence
a thousand fold.

1148
01:22:42,823 --> 01:22:44,619
It could be transformative.

1149
01:22:44,692 --> 01:22:47,216
<i>How can we not give him that, Steve?</i>

1150
01:22:50,296 --> 01:22:52,060
God bless you, Steve.

1151
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:55,001
Sure he does.

1152
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:14,385
My first concert, I was so nervous,
I vomited all down my tuxedo.

1153
01:23:14,454 --> 01:23:16,820
It was so embarrassing.

1154
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:22,559
Want to know how I got over
those jitters, Nathaniel?

1155
01:23:23,596 --> 01:23:24,859
I prayed.

1156
01:23:26,132 --> 01:23:28,567
Shall we pray together, you and I?

1157
01:23:30,304 --> 01:23:31,930
Heavenly Father,

1158
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:34,703
shine your light on brother Nathaniel,

1159
01:23:34,774 --> 01:23:38,039
that he may speak
with your voice tonight.

1160
01:24:35,435 --> 01:24:39,701
<i>Nathaniel, you never have been here,
Nathaniel. I'm here, Nathaniel.</i>

1161
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:41,764
<i>- You're not there.
- Nathaniel.</i>

1162
01:24:41,841 --> 01:24:45,038
<i>You never have been here.
You never will be here.</i>

1163
01:24:47,447 --> 01:24:48,708
<i>My voice is all there is.</i>

1164
01:24:48,782 --> 01:24:50,340
Everything's fine.

1165
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:51,747
<i>- Follow my voice, Nathaniel.
- Tune up and play.</i>

1166
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:52,979
<i>Run away from these people, Nathaniel.</i>

1167
01:24:53,052 --> 01:24:54,179
<i>They'll laugh at you.</i>

1168
01:24:54,253 --> 01:24:55,881
<i>- You're nothing.
- Nathaniel Ayers.</i>

1169
01:25:06,966 --> 01:25:08,399
Nathaniel?

1170
01:25:10,337 --> 01:25:12,532
I got some soup here for you.

1171
01:25:35,561 --> 01:25:36,926
Nathaniel?

1172
01:25:38,064 --> 01:25:40,533
You think I'm stupid.
Is that what you think?

1173
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,729
<i>You want to kill them, Nathaniel.
They'll kill you first, Nathaniel.</i>

1174
01:25:43,804 --> 01:25:44,828
No.

1175
01:25:44,904 --> 01:25:46,429
<i>They'll string you up, Nathaniel.</i>

1176
01:25:46,506 --> 01:25:49,304
No. You think I can't see everything.
I see everything.

1177
01:25:49,376 --> 01:25:51,275
I know who you are.
I know what you're doing.

1178
01:25:51,345 --> 01:25:52,811
<i>- Dogs, biting at your feet.
- Nathaniel.</i>

1179
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,939
<i>- I thought you might be hungry.
- Nathaniel, over there.</i>

1180
01:25:55,015 --> 01:25:58,576
<i>- The dusty open manual.
- Nathaniel, come here.</i>

1181
01:25:58,652 --> 01:25:59,811
<i>The manual.</i>

1182
01:25:59,886 --> 01:26:03,253
That's hydrochloric acid. If I eat that, it'll
burn me up inside and kill me like a dog.

1183
01:26:03,323 --> 01:26:05,188
<i>- Oh, no.
- Nathaniel.</i>

1184
01:26:05,259 --> 01:26:07,488
<i>- Nathaniel, I wouldn't do that.
- Nathaniel.</i>

1185
01:26:08,362 --> 01:26:11,490
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

1186
01:26:13,033 --> 01:26:15,126
<i>You'll eat it, dust and all.</i>

1187
01:26:16,203 --> 01:26:17,363
Okay.

1188
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:19,832
It's good, see.

1189
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:30,978
Shit.

1190
01:26:36,023 --> 01:26:37,114
Don't put your hands on me!

1191
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:39,055
- Nathaniel!
- Back the hell off!

1192
01:26:39,126 --> 01:26:41,720
Don't you ever touch me!
Don't ever put your hands on me!

1193
01:26:41,795 --> 01:26:44,092
Please, don't. Nathaniel.

1194
01:26:47,466 --> 01:26:48,661
Don't you ever touch me.

1195
01:26:48,734 --> 01:26:49,827
Stop.

1196
01:27:02,615 --> 01:27:03,980
Nathaniel!

1197
01:27:15,028 --> 01:27:18,987
What am I supposed to do?
I should have support.

1198
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:30,966
Hi, Nathaniel.

1199
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:37,448
It's freezing out here.
Don't you wanna come home?

1200
01:27:37,516 --> 01:27:39,712
I can't go back there. It's not safe.

1201
01:27:39,786 --> 01:27:41,753
Come on, home, Nathaniel.

1202
01:27:47,027 --> 01:27:48,493
Nathaniel?

1203
01:27:49,563 --> 01:27:51,530
Where are you gonna sleep?

1204
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:04,002
David, sorry, it's Steve. Listen.

1205
01:28:04,744 --> 01:28:07,235
Can you call me back
when you have a second?

1206
01:28:07,314 --> 01:28:10,545
There was an incident
with Nathaniel tonight. I'm a little

1207
01:28:11,518 --> 01:28:14,578
worried. Anyway, call back
when you have a sec.

1208
01:28:18,358 --> 01:28:19,824
All right, let's go.

1209
01:28:30,337 --> 01:28:34,636
It's my thing!
I claim my right to those possessions!

1210
01:28:34,707 --> 01:28:36,436
Show me your stuff!

1211
01:28:39,813 --> 01:28:41,371
- Linda!
- What?

1212
01:28:41,448 --> 01:28:43,541
- Hey, where's Nathaniel?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him.

1213
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:45,778
- I haven't seen him.
- Hey! Hey!

1214
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:47,643
Is it Darryl?

1215
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,881
Hey, stay back. Who the hell are you?

1216
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:51,617
<i>LA Times. That's the last guy
you should be arresting.</i>

1217
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:53,750
- Come on, man! Come on.
- Skid row cleanup, sir. Let's go.

1218
01:28:53,827 --> 01:28:54,918
Steve! Steve!

1219
01:28:54,994 --> 01:28:57,828
This man is in illegal possession
of a shopping cart and a milk crate.

1220
01:28:57,898 --> 01:28:59,832
Are you gonna arrest him
for possession of a milk crate?

1221
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:02,390
- Steve! Steve!
- That's correct, sir.

1222
01:29:05,005 --> 01:29:06,471
Take it easy.

1223
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,375
Help! Help!

1224
01:29:18,417 --> 01:29:19,817
<i>Come on!</i>

1225
01:29:20,353 --> 01:29:21,842
Officer, what happened?

1226
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:24,152
A couple of kids came out here
with some baseball bats

1227
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,622
and beat the shit out of this poor guy.

1228
01:29:25,692 --> 01:29:27,784
- Get a name?
- Negative, sir.

1229
01:29:33,632 --> 01:29:35,760
Sorry, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1230
01:29:37,804 --> 01:29:42,399
Is this Admits? May I make
an enquiry about a... Excuse me.

1231
01:29:42,742 --> 01:29:44,333
- This way?
- What?

1232
01:29:44,411 --> 01:29:45,570
Yeah, down here.

1233
01:29:45,645 --> 01:29:48,909
It's usually on the... I'm sorry.
It's usually on the screen.

1234
01:29:49,649 --> 01:29:53,345
Excuse me, ma'am. Recent ER
admits named Ayers, A-Y-E-R-S.

1235
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:55,417
Thank you, by the way.

1236
01:29:56,856 --> 01:29:57,983
No.

1237
01:29:59,059 --> 01:30:00,855
Hi. Thank you.

1238
01:30:00,926 --> 01:30:03,588
I'm looking for a recent admission.

1239
01:30:03,662 --> 01:30:07,099
I'm hoping you have a recent admission
with a man named Ayers, A-Y-E-R-S.

1240
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:11,198
I know. Contreras was the reporting
officer. He was the officer on site.

1241
01:30:12,939 --> 01:30:14,872
It's not the... It's not the...

1242
01:30:18,545 --> 01:30:20,341
Mr. Ayers. A-Y-E-R-S.

1243
01:30:20,412 --> 01:30:23,314
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers.
5'10" African-American.

1244
01:30:23,617 --> 01:30:25,050
Hi. It's me again.

1245
01:30:25,585 --> 01:30:27,176
It's gonna be a long shift.
What's your name?

1246
01:30:27,487 --> 01:30:30,081
N- A-T-H-A-N-I-E-L A...

1247
01:30:31,358 --> 01:30:33,121
I do words for a living. It doesn't matter.

1248
01:30:33,193 --> 01:30:34,751
Whoever has two stripes
on their arm or more.

1249
01:30:34,828 --> 01:30:37,261
Ayers! A-Y-E-R-S.

1250
01:30:37,329 --> 01:30:42,529
N- A-T-H-A-N-I-E-L
A- N-T-H-O-N-Y A-Y-E-R-S.

1251
01:30:42,702 --> 01:30:44,498
No! Do not put me on hold again!

1252
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:48,131
A- Y-E-R-S!

1253
01:31:12,532 --> 01:31:14,726
<i>- Lopez.
- Steve, David.</i>

1254
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:17,132
<i>I got your message, what's up?</i>

1255
01:31:17,203 --> 01:31:20,104
There was a beating of a homeless man
on Winston Street,

1256
01:31:20,172 --> 01:31:23,006
<i>- it was right in Nathaniel's spot.
- It wasn't him.</i>

1257
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:25,235
What? How do you know?

1258
01:31:25,311 --> 01:31:29,270
'Cause he's here,
eating a crazy-big breakfast.

1259
01:31:30,283 --> 01:31:33,547
I guess sleeping inside
can give a man an appetite.

1260
01:31:34,421 --> 01:31:35,717
What?

1261
01:31:35,788 --> 01:31:38,256
<i>He spent last night in the apartment.</i>

1262
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:40,917
<i>He came inside.</i>

1263
01:31:59,546 --> 01:32:00,774
Thank you.

1264
01:32:00,846 --> 01:32:04,180
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1265
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:06,478
I thought I lost it forever.

1266
01:32:06,819 --> 01:32:07,877
Hi.

1267
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:10,751
You good?

1268
01:32:14,293 --> 01:32:18,320
I literally looked everywhere else
in Los Angeles but here.

1269
01:32:19,966 --> 01:32:21,831
Not that I was worried.

1270
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:24,326
What happened? What made you
decide to sleep in here?

1271
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:27,930
Oh, well, a body can only take
so much, Mr. Lopez.

1272
01:32:28,007 --> 01:32:30,841
I'm not young anymore,
I'm a middle-aged man.

1273
01:32:30,909 --> 01:32:32,935
- You know how it is.
- Sure.

1274
01:32:34,913 --> 01:32:36,574
I mean, a body gets weary, a body...

1275
01:32:36,649 --> 01:32:38,378
Housewarming gift.

1276
01:32:48,728 --> 01:32:50,457
Thank you, Mr. Lopez.

1277
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:55,896
Thank you, Mr. Lopez. Thank you.

1278
01:33:01,274 --> 01:33:03,640
I've done good by you, haven't I?

1279
01:33:04,144 --> 01:33:06,635
I mean, things aren't so bad, right?

1280
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:15,250
Say, things are set for Jennifer
to become your executor.

1281
01:33:15,322 --> 01:33:18,917
I can't believe Beethoven himself
is in my own apartment.

1282
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:22,192
Are you still okay with that?
Having Jennifer handle things for you?

1283
01:33:22,261 --> 01:33:24,252
It's all right with me
if it's all right with Beethoven.

1284
01:33:24,331 --> 01:33:26,423
Well, you guys let me know.

1285
01:33:27,966 --> 01:33:31,926
'Cause there's papers you gotta sign.
They just got back from...

1286
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:35,201
You should read them
so you know what you're signing.

1287
01:33:35,274 --> 01:33:37,868
All right, yeah, I'll just sign them
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, Jr.,

1288
01:33:37,944 --> 01:33:41,936
apartment B-116, and the B stands for

1289
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,216
Beethoven.

1290
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,846
- Read them and sign them.
- All right.

1291
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:49,979
- Okay.
- All right.

1292
01:33:50,055 --> 01:33:51,613
What do you...
You got anything to drink?

1293
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:54,284
Yes, sir, Mr. Lopez.
Absolutely, Mr. Lopez,

1294
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:58,854
help yourself to some water, it's where
the dripping sound is coming from.

1295
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,926
- At your leisure.
- All right.

1296
01:34:12,177 --> 01:34:13,542
Is there a...

1297
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:18,875
What's with Neil Diamond?

1298
01:34:18,952 --> 01:34:20,851
I thought that was you.

1299
01:34:28,994 --> 01:34:31,987
Well, I'm flattered.
He's a good-looking guy.

1300
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,091
What's wrong?

1301
01:34:38,003 --> 01:34:40,198
What's this business about me

1302
01:34:40,573 --> 01:34:44,009
having a schizophrenic mind?

1303
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:47,603
It's, it's... It's legal jargon.

1304
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,046
It says that I have a schizophrenic mind.
I do not.

1305
01:34:51,117 --> 01:34:52,277
It doesn't mean anything.

1306
01:34:52,351 --> 01:34:55,810
- I have a schizophrenic mind.
- That's not what I think.

1307
01:34:56,122 --> 01:34:58,716
Nathaniel, they try to put people in a...

1308
01:34:58,792 --> 01:35:00,588
- I'm not going anywhere.
- And the good news is that

1309
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:02,594
it has nothing to do with you.

1310
01:35:02,662 --> 01:35:05,529
I don't go where you say to go.
I go where I want to go.

1311
01:35:05,597 --> 01:35:07,725
You don't put me away, Mr. Lopez.
You don't put me away.

1312
01:35:07,801 --> 01:35:09,199
- Okay. Okay.
- You don't put me away.

1313
01:35:09,269 --> 01:35:10,292
I'm not gonna... I don't...

1314
01:35:10,369 --> 01:35:12,167
- No, no, you don't have to go...
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

1315
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:13,329
...to court.
You don't have to go anywhere.

1316
01:35:13,405 --> 01:35:14,805
Jennifer will take care of you.

1317
01:35:14,873 --> 01:35:16,899
My sister's not coming near me.
She is not coming near me.

1318
01:35:16,975 --> 01:35:18,876
- She's not coming near me.
- Okay, remember when you said...

1319
01:35:18,944 --> 01:35:20,242
If I say she's not coming
then she's not coming.

1320
01:35:20,313 --> 01:35:22,474
You said... Nathaniel, you said...

1321
01:35:22,548 --> 01:35:24,983
Listen, I'm not going to have anymore...
I'm not going to have anymore...

1322
01:35:25,051 --> 01:35:28,612
I will tell you. I will tell you. I'm sick
of being Nathaniel and you Mr. Lopez.

1323
01:35:28,688 --> 01:35:29,847
Okay. I'm not just...

1324
01:35:29,922 --> 01:35:32,618
Wait. I'm not your boy.
I am not Mr. Colonel Sanders's boy.

1325
01:35:32,692 --> 01:35:35,661
You know, I'm sorry I was wrong.
I'm sorry I was wrong.

1326
01:35:35,728 --> 01:35:39,788
I can take care of myself.
I can take care of myself, Mr. Lopez.

1327
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:44,701
I don't need you. I don't need this city.
I despise this city and I despise you.

1328
01:35:47,707 --> 01:35:49,833
And if I ever see you again,

1329
01:35:51,043 --> 01:35:52,738
I'll cut you open

1330
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:55,703
and gut you like a fish.

1331
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:09,453
Because I'm Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr.

1332
01:36:10,863 --> 01:36:13,492
Mr. Ayers.

1333
01:36:16,202 --> 01:36:20,229
I'm Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr.
N- A-T-H-A...

1334
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:26,243
N- A-T-H-A...

1335
01:36:26,311 --> 01:36:31,951
<i>- N-A-T-H-A...
- You're of no consequence.</i>

1336
01:36:46,899 --> 01:36:48,628
- Hi.
- Hi.

1337
01:37:18,064 --> 01:37:20,328
So, that was my first mistake.

1338
01:37:25,404 --> 01:37:27,895
The Northridge Quake, '94, remember?

1339
01:37:28,507 --> 01:37:30,203
I smelled the toast.

1340
01:37:33,712 --> 01:37:35,680
We'd been here two days.

1341
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:39,077
All our crap still in boxes.

1342
01:37:39,152 --> 01:37:40,914
And at 4:00 a. m. It hit.

1343
01:37:41,587 --> 01:37:43,248
God, that terror.

1344
01:37:47,426 --> 01:37:50,122
You, me and Thomas.
What was he, nine?

1345
01:37:50,529 --> 01:37:55,229
All huddled
under that bedroom door frame.

1346
01:37:55,568 --> 01:37:57,832
I told him it was a good omen.

1347
01:38:00,974 --> 01:38:03,203
Welcoming us to our new life.

1348
01:38:04,077 --> 01:38:05,475
Better life.

1349
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:08,442
In LA.

1350
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:24,756
I should have had us
on the first flight back to Philly.

1351
01:38:35,774 --> 01:38:37,970
I thought I was helping someone.

1352
01:38:39,145 --> 01:38:41,408
And it was a guy who's got a gift.

1353
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,813
He's lost his way. I'm gonna...

1354
01:38:49,087 --> 01:38:52,386
Inevitably backfired.

1355
01:38:53,059 --> 01:38:55,050
He's backlashed to the...

1356
01:38:57,130 --> 01:39:02,123
And the very person I was trying to be of
some redeeming service to turns on me.

1357
01:39:02,868 --> 01:39:05,667
I'm the enemy. You know?

1358
01:39:08,608 --> 01:39:09,904
A stranger.

1359
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,470
And...

1360
01:39:13,945 --> 01:39:16,573
I don't know who to fault.

1361
01:39:16,649 --> 01:39:21,847
I can't see any outcome to support.

1362
01:39:26,559 --> 01:39:29,186
Can't believe in anything worthwhile.

1363
01:39:33,065 --> 01:39:36,432
Done trying. I resign. I resign.

1364
01:39:37,369 --> 01:39:39,030
From everything.

1365
01:39:39,639 --> 01:39:41,606
It's... It's official.

1366
01:39:49,314 --> 01:39:51,715
You couldn't stop that earthquake.

1367
01:39:57,222 --> 01:40:00,420
You can't fix LA in just...

1368
01:40:02,127 --> 01:40:04,756
And you're never gonna cure Nathaniel.

1369
01:40:10,036 --> 01:40:12,595
Just be his friend and show up.

1370
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,649
Good? I'll be right here if you need me.

1371
01:41:49,068 --> 01:41:51,036
...go, next to the gold store.

1372
01:41:51,103 --> 01:41:53,832
You know what I mean.
He wanted to drink and everything.

1373
01:41:53,905 --> 01:41:56,100
Okay, okay, okay. Bitch, slow down.

1374
01:41:56,975 --> 01:42:01,105
Do you still love me?
Like you did at the start?

1375
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,908
I ain't playing with you.

1376
01:42:02,981 --> 01:42:05,074
I'm saying I do.

1377
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,846
It means you and me together forever.

1378
01:42:09,654 --> 01:42:13,523
So that's why I'm saying I do.

1379
01:42:15,027 --> 01:42:18,359
- I love you, Lois.
- I love you, too, Darryl.

1380
01:42:21,132 --> 01:42:24,659
Disguise himself now as...

1381
01:42:24,737 --> 01:42:29,503
They disguise themselves...
Where is Los Angeles?

1382
01:42:29,975 --> 01:42:31,773
Cleveland?

1383
01:42:35,146 --> 01:42:36,444
And...

1384
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:02,930
We...

1385
01:43:08,581 --> 01:43:10,742
We had some life, didn't we?

1386
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:15,751
Yeah.

1387
01:43:16,788 --> 01:43:18,016
Yeah.

1388
01:44:02,568 --> 01:44:05,162
<i>Beethoven's Triple Concerto, right?</i>

1389
01:44:05,671 --> 01:44:07,536
- Yeah.
- It's a good one.

1390
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:11,103
I liked it.

1391
01:44:11,543 --> 01:44:15,479
Mr. Ayers, I'm gonna give your sister
a ride to the hotel.

1392
01:44:15,547 --> 01:44:18,073
You don't have to
call me that, Mr. Lopez.

1393
01:44:18,149 --> 01:44:22,176
I know. I want to. I should have been
calling you that all along.

1394
01:44:22,822 --> 01:44:24,756
I said such terrible things
to you, Mr. Lopez.

1395
01:44:24,823 --> 01:44:28,590
I... I hate myself for saying those things.

1396
01:44:28,661 --> 01:44:31,152
Sometimes friends piss
each other off, right?

1397
01:44:31,229 --> 01:44:33,095
It's part of the deal.

1398
01:44:33,532 --> 01:44:39,300
I can't imagine that you would want to be
my friend after I said all those things.

1399
01:44:39,438 --> 01:44:40,597
I just...

1400
01:44:40,672 --> 01:44:42,003
Mr. Ayers,

1401
01:44:44,275 --> 01:44:46,506
I'm honored to be your friend.

1402

<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

1403
01:45:09,467 --> 01:45:12,061
<i>A year ago, I met a man
who was down on his luck</i>

1404
01:45:12,137 --> 01:45:14,970
<i>and thought I might be able to help him.</i>

1405
01:45:15,041 --> 01:45:17,009
<i>I don't know that I have.</i>

1406
01:45:17,376 --> 01:45:19,742
<i>Yes, my friend Mr. Ayers
now sleeps inside.</i>

1407
01:45:19,811 --> 01:45:22,372
<i>He has a key. He has a bed.</i>

1408
01:45:23,515 --> 01:45:26,212
<i>But his mental state, and his well-being,</i>

1409
01:45:26,284 --> 01:45:29,515
<i>are as precarious now
as they were the day we met.</i>

1410
01:45:32,925 --> 01:45:35,722
<i>There are people who tell me
I've helped him.</i>

1411
01:45:35,795 --> 01:45:38,059
<i>Mental health experts who say</i>

1412
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:42,430
<i>that the simple act of being someone's
friend can change his brain chemistry,</i>

1413
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:45,128
<i>improve his functioning in the world.</i>

1414
01:45:45,904 --> 01:45:48,805
<i>I can't speak for Mr. Ayers
in that regard.</i>

1415
01:45:49,074 --> 01:45:52,340
<i>Maybe our friendship has helped him.
But maybe not.</i>

1416
01:45:54,846 --> 01:45:57,280
<i>I can, however, speak for myself.</i>

1417
01:45:58,117 --> 01:46:01,552
<i>I can tell you that by witnessing
Mr. Ayers's courage,</i>

1418
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:05,957
<i>his humility, his faith
in the power of his art,</i>

1419

<i>I've learned the dignity of being loyal

<i>Of holding onto it, above all else.</i>

1421
01:46:15,301 --> 01:46:20,466
<i>Of believing, without question,
