1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,794
One of the key dynamics
propelling everybody forward

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:08,834
in season 2 is 
"power abhors a vacuum".

3
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:12,795
Power resides where men believe it resides.

4
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:14,716
All these different kings
are vying for the throne

5
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:17,163
because they see in the wake
of Robert Baratheon's death,

6
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,740
a chance to seize power.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,219
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark...

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,943
they'll bend the knee
or I'll destroy them.

9
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:26,734
Season 2 is really
building towards a massive battle.

10
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:28,941
Loose!

12
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:41,086
We're in a Council meeting

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,846
and then, out of nowhere,

14
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:45,802
comes her favorite brother,
Tyrion.

15
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:48,207
I come in with a note from Daddy,

16
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:51,865
that I'm being appointed
the Hand of the King in his absence.

17
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,850
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

18
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:57,758
But I know that our enemies hate each other
almost as much as they hate us.

19
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:00,635
In the throne room scene, Joffrey
prods to this,

20
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:03,646
into a certain curiosity that's been born
in my mind.

21
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:06,456
I heard a disgusting line about
Uncle Jaime and you.

22
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:10,612
What you just did,
is punishable by death.

23
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:13,799
She's got not an ounce
of control over her son

24
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:15,838
and that's horrifying to her.

25
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,811
King in the North.

26
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:22,921
In episode one, we have this nice little
scene between Robb and-and Jaime.

27
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,170
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
towards the high lords of Westeros.

28
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,113
King Joffrey Baratheon is your bastard son.

29
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:32,949
That's the first time we see Jaime
a little worried.

30
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:36,241
At the beginning of season 2,
Catelyn is with Robb,

31
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,520
and Sansa and Arya she hopes are safe

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,136
in King's Landing.

33
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,664
You need to answer for your brother's
latest treasons.

34
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:46,480
This is a poor girl, whose father
was executed,

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,284
she's sort of been left alone
with this monster.

36
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:52,303
Joffrey does it very publicly.

37
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:55,855
He's not afraid to show
how he's treating Sansa.

38
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:59,037
But because he rules by fear,
no one's gonna speak out about it.

39
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,644
What is the meaning of this?

40
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:03,282
She's to be your queen.

41
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:05,083
Have you no regard for her honour?

42
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:08,032
Tyrion is the only one that speaks out
against Joffrey

43
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:09,484
because he kind of can.

44
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:12,209
I'm looking for a boy named Gendry.

45
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,750
We'll be back. With more men.

46
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,566
I'm with Yoren on our way to Night's Watch.

47
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:22,077
But hopefully, Yoren is gonna try
and drop me home on the way there.

48
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:24,001
What did the Gold Cloaks want with you?

49
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,354
No idea. I thought
they were after you. Why?

50
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:29,715
Did you kill someone or is it just
because you're a girl?

51
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:32,288
- I'm not a girl.
- You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?

52
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:33,747
Bran and Rickon

53
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,378
are still at Winterfell with Maester Luwin.

54
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,247
Every night is the same.
Running through the Godswood,

55
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:41,271
sniffing the dirt, howling...

56
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:43,366
These are dreams, nothing more.

57
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:45,571
My dreams are different. Mine are true.

58
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:49,305
Dany is in a much more somber place
than where we left

59
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,118
in the end of season 1.

60
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,269
Does it ever end?

61
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,180
Everything ends, even the Red Waste.

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,262
So I took it upon myself to send

63
00:02:56,382 --> 00:03:00,860
my Dothraki off to try and find a place
that we could try and survive.

64
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,405
The one Dothraki that did come back,
came back with

65
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:06,279
tales of a paradise 
in the middle of the desert,

66
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,411
that was intrigued by the idea of dragons.

67
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:12,709
I will vouch for her, her people
and her dragons.

68
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:15,048
Welcome to Qarth, my lady.

69
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,253
Season 2 begins with Jon
travelling north of the wall.

70
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:22,322
He's travelling north with the other
members of the Night's Watch,

71
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:25,109
the Lord Commander, and his friends,
Sam and Grenn.

72
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:30,363
The Night's Watch stop at a rather
horrible man's house, called Craster.

73
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:32,520
He's a quite despicable character.

74
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,985
He marries his daughters
and they give him more daughters.

75
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:38,647
Sam does the one thing he shouldn't do,

76
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:42,015
which is to fall in love with one
of Craster's wives, Gilly.

77
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,397
I wanted to give you something.
It belonged to my mother.

78
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,741
Keep it safe for me,
till I come back.

79
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,711
One thing we definitely need
if we're going to take King's Landing,

80
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,154
is ships.

81
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:55,367
Robb thinks the best move
would be to send Theon back to his father.

82
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:58,410
Catelyn's always had
an issue with the Greyjoys.

83
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,629
You don't want Balon Greyjoy
for an ally.

84
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,896
I need his ships.
They say he has two hundred.

85
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:05,836
Theon goes off with these good intentions,

86
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:09,510
but when he gets back home,
he gets turned against me.

87
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,125
My fears have come true.

88
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:13,417
The Starks have made you theirs.

89
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:16,868
Robb sent Catelyn to Renly's camp

90
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,202
to persuade Renly to join Robb.

91
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,451
Renly and Stannis are both fighting
to be king.

92
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:25,273
The Iron Throne is mine!

93
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:26,389
No one wants you for their king.

94
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:28,301
Stannis is obviously next in line,

95
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,295
but Stannis is not 
gonna join the side.

96
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:34,604
Melisandre is a character
who arrives in season 2.

97
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:36,454
She believes in other gods.

98
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,974
You must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

99
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,021
I've said the words!

100
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,328
Events take a sudden turn,

101
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:46,396
when Catelyn is in the tent,
trying to talk to Renly.

102
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:52,062
He is stabbed by some form of evil spirit

103
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:54,825
which has been conjured up
by Melisandre.

104
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:58,013
Afraid that she is actually
going to get accused of this murder,

105
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,159
Catelyn flees with Brienne.

106
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,580
In the name of King Joffrey,
drop your weapons.

107
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,695
I don't think I will.

108
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:08,518
When Yoren goes down, that's
when everything starts to get a bit scary.

109
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,402
Sweet boy, help us!

110
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:15,632
She already knows that's something
a bit strange about Jaqen.

111
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:19,564
And she sees the axe and she gives him
the axe and just leaves them to get out.

112
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:21,894
Round up any survivors!

113
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,088
We take them back to Harrenhal.

114
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,449
They are just focusing on staying alive

115
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:30,304
and that's probably the worst place to be
if you wanted to stay alive.

116
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:33,898
Unknowingly,
Tywin Lannister sort of saves Arya.

117
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,920
Get these prisoners to work.

118
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,700
Bring the girl. I need a new cup bearer.

119
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,386
Look.

120
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,691
The Fist of the First Men is where
they're gonna meet Qhorin Halfhand,

121
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,342
who wants to go on a ranging mission,

122
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,700
to find out what the wildlings are doing.

123
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,867
I need to move fast, and silent.

124
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:51,993
There's wildlings up on the pass,
Qhorin wants to go and

125
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:54,295
find out what Mance Rayder
is planning to do.

126
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:59,195
He's left to kill one of the wildlings,

127
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,618
Ygritte, who he doesn't kill.

128
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,684
When Sam and Grenn are digging through
the snow at the Fist of the First Men,

129
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:09,225
they find dragonglass.

130
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:12,296
We're not quite sure what the significance
of dragonglass is,

131
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,638
but it's a curious thing to find

132
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:16,685
buried underneath the
Fist of the First Men.

133
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,954
The Wolf Pup has gone south.

134
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:21,346
The North is ripe for the taking.

135
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:24,645
Theon completely betrays me,
and not only me, but my whole family.

136
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:27,321
As any child, any boy would want,

137
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,863
he wants his father's approval.

138
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:31,907
They attack Winterfell
and they decimate it.

139
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:34,538
I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.

140
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:36,781
Betray me and you will wish you hadn't.

141
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:38,581
Mother of Dragons.

142
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:41,237
It would be an honour to host you
at the House of the Undying.

143
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:44,863
The Qartheen people only wanted one thing,
and that was my dragons.

144
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:48,156
And that began the theme
throughout season 2 for Dany,

145
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:50,832
which is the fact
that she couldn't trust anyone.

146
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:54,530
It's a pretty horrific bloody scene
that I return to.

147
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,713
And the dragons are gone.

148
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,573
Where are my dragons?

149
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,595
The plan all along was,

150
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,816
Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos

151
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,286
would steal my dragons, and rule.

152
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:05,773
You have my dragons.

153
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,102
I will take you to the
House of the Undying,

154
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,297
where I have put them.

155
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,681
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.

156
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:13,154
And Rickon too, the little one.

157
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,684
Theon basically turns his back,

158
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:16,558
completely on our family.

159
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,215
I told you what would happen

160
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:19,855
if you serve me loyally.

161
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:21,668
And what would happen if you did not.

162
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:23,444
No!

163
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:26,118
He's really stabbed me
in the back completely.

164
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,670
Got as far as the farm,
then doubled-back.

165
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,471
Must have been the farmer's boys.

166
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:34,286
Killed them, burned them, and passed
them off as the little lords.

167
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:36,348
Fate is giving us this chance to...

168
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,615
You've lost your mind! Get out!

169
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:41,592
The Lannisters are
desperate to get Jamie back.

170
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,931
So, Littlefinger deceives Catelyn.

171
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:48,230
Both girls are healthy and safe, for now.

172
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,219
He says to her, if you give us Jamie,

173
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,724
the Lannisters will return
your two girls to you.

174
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,893
He's been a captive for a long time.

175
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:58,803
He killed Lord Karstark's
son when he escaped.

176
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,536
Kingslayer won't last a night.

177
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,298
Come.

178
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:03,408
When he meets Brienne the first time,

179
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,887
he's never seen anyone like that.

180
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,834
Is that a woman?

181
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,275
It's kind of the beginning
of a remarkable relationship.

182
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:14,298
Catelyn frees him, and instructs
Brienne to get him to King's Landing.

183
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:17,186
Now he can't carry out his duties
as a king because

184
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:19,756
he'd have to kill his own mother, 
and he's not going to do that,

185
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,170
so it makes him look weak.

186
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,950
You saved me, and the two I was with.

187
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:26,305
- Speak three names.
- I can name anyone, and you'll kill him?

188
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:28,525
She's a little bit skeptical about it.

189
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:31,224
But when the Tickler turns out to be 
dead, that's when she's like...

190
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,381
this guy is a good sort of contact to have.

191
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,556
Stannis two days from the capital,

192
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,529
and the Wolf at my doorstep.

193
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:40,062
We'll ride at nightfall.

194
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:42,626
She asks Jaqen to kill Tywin.

195
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:45,228
- I need him dead right now.
- This a man cannot do.

196
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:46,897
Give a name. Any name.

197
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,562
She decides to turn it around
a little bit.

198
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:49,660
Jaqen H'ghar.

199
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,497
A girl gives a man his own name.

200
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:54,418
I'll unname you, if you help me
and my friends escape.

201
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:56,075
If he's not gonna kill Tywin,

202
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,097
then she's gonna make him kill more 
than one person to help them escape.

203
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:01,204
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

204
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:04,067
This woman has the potential
to break the vow

205
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:05,574
that Catelyn made to
Walder Frey.

206
00:09:05,694 --> 00:09:06,746
I don't need to marry you.

207
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:09,434
Walder Frey is a man you do not mess with.

208
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:11,769
- I am hers and she is mine.
- I am his and he is mine.

209
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,050
We die today, brothers.

210
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,622
Aye!

211
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:20,487
They kill men that Theon grew up with.

212
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:21,905
Let's go home.

213
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,821
They destroy Winterfell.

214
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,622
They burned it down, everything.

215
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:29,492
What she doesn't know and she finds out it isn't,
her two youngest are still alive. (***)

216
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:33,268
They may come back. Go north, to the Wall,
to Jon.

217
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:35,907
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

218
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:37,843
Nothing happened between you and me.

219
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,064
She's very wily,

220
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:41,464
Ygritte, she mocks him and
mocks him and mocks him.

221
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:43,255
And you think she's just doing 
this for her own fun.

222
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,463
But actually, she's playing the long game.

223
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:51,465
You should have took me
while you had the chance.

224
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:54,853
When Jon becomes a captive
of the wildlings,

225
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:58,590
he discovers that Qhorin Halfhand
has been captured as well.

226
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,274
Halfhand realizes that the only good
that can come out of this

227
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,929
is one of them becoming a spy amongst
Mance Rayder's camp.

228
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:08,248
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

229
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:10,008
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

230
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:15,930
Come along, Jon Snow.

231
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:18,163
Time to meet the King Beyond the Wall.

232
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,678
If my dragons are
in the House of the Undying,

233
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:21,690
then take me there.

234
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,312
That's what the warlock wants.

235
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:27,842
It's here that I walk into unknown magic.

236
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,233
- This magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

237
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:33,082
And she is tested with everything
that means the most to her.

238
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:35,312
Khaleesi!

239
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,717
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us.

240
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,036
Sooner rather than later.

241
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:41,083
Tyrion and Cersei have a lot in common.

242
00:10:41,203 --> 00:10:43,352
And I think that's why
they're at such odds with each other.

243
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:45,202
They are going to attack us.

244
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:46,808
We need to be ready.

245
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,929
The king is taking personal
charge of siege preparations.

246
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:53,086
If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

247
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:53,899
Will it hold?

248
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,699
I can't make promises for the wind,
Your Grace.

249
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:57,596
They say Stannis never smiles.

250
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:59,545
I'll give him a red smile.

251
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:03,095
The threat from Stannis is the
most terrifying for Joffrey.

252
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:04,698
And the most real I suppose.

253
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:07,126
Mud Gate. That's where he'll land.

254
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:10,111
If Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,

255
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,646
what is our plan?

256
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:15,705
There's all this wildfire down
in the basement's basement.

257
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,885
He gets together with this pyromancer

258
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,721
and figures out a way to stop them.

259
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:30,935
When Joffrey realizes that
the whole fleet hasn't been destroyed,

260
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:32,143
you see that

261
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:33,952
he's most certainly a coward.

262
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:36,073
They're coming ashore. They're too many.

263
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:39,699
The Hound goes out there, and he 
realizes they're outnumbered.

264
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:43,522
Half the men that arrive on the shore
are burning.

265
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:45,560
That's the one fear of the Hound.

266
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,991
He doesn't do fire,

267
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,790
and all it takes is one burning man
running towards you.

268
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,813
When the Hound comes back in
from the fighting

269
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:52,958
he abandons the king.

270
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:55,683
And that is a massive blow to Joffrey.

271
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:58,397
He just bolts and leaves the
responsibility to Tyrion.

272
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,941
Those are brave men knocking at
our door. Let's go kill them!

273
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:04,934
I get pretty banged up.

274
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:09,188
It could have been worse though.
My squire, Podrick, saves me.

275
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:14,016
And then Father comes in. Saves the
day so he gets all the recognition.

276
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:16,334
The king won't give you any honours.

277
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:18,073
But we will not forget.

278
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:19,726
With the great aid

279
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:22,838
the Tyrells gave to the battle,
the deal was struck

280
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,962
to marry Margaery to Joffrey.

281
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:28,663
Cersei thinks she's won,
because she's gonna upset Sansa.

282
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,437
She couldn't be happier,

283
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:33,057
and then Littlefinger
kind of crushes her hopes.

284
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:34,368
If he's not marrying me...

285
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:38,561
He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the
sort of boy who gives away his toys.

286
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:41,260
Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.

287
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,085
My home is across the sea,
where my people are waiting.

288
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:45,587
They'll be waiting a long time.

289
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:47,696
He thinks that he's got her, but of course,

290
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:50,629
the dragons, they'd learnt
how to breathe fire.

291
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:52,269
Dracarys!

292
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,480
Jon hasn't returned when he should

293
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,179
to the Fist of the First Men
and Sam's getting nervous.

294
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:06,086
It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back!

295
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:10,227
At the end of season 2, we leave Sam
in a rather perilous situation.

296
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:14,067
Two blasts is wildlings.

297
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,522
And three horns
is White Walkers.

298
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:19,606
Run!

299
