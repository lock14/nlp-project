1
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.

2
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,800
That's one small step for man...

3
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,500
...one giant leap for mankind.

4
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,200
Good morning, Sunshine.

5
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,600
- Is your sister awake?
- I don't know where she is.

6
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,700
You look like you had a wild night.

7
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,500
- Well, good morning, Your Majesty.
- Good morning.

8
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,200
This time, no circles on my pancakes.

9
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,300
Here we go.
You guys are loopy in the morning.

10
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,600
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,900
I don't know about
all this free-range stuff.

12
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,300
I had a calf headed for California.

13
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,100
- There's circles on my pancake.
- Eat your breakfast, please.

14
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,200
- I don't like Jupiter.
- I'm sorry, honey.

15
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,400
It started out as Venus, and it grew.

16
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
- I'm not gonna eat it.
- I'm not gonna eat it.

17
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
Girls.

18
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,900
You see, the planets are just not aligned.

19
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,300
- Is Shepard up yet?
- No, I think he's still sleeping.

20
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,300
- Morning, sleepyhead.
- Dad.

21
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,400
You got an e-mail from
that weirdo at FuelFourU.

22
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,600
All right. I think we may have our fuel.

23
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,300
What do you think about this sweater
for my dad?

24
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,600
- I'd divorce you.
- Is it the color?

25
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,000
Why don't you buy him
a new arc welder?

26
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,800
You want me to wrap that up,
or should I just give it to you?

27
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,300
What makes you think your dad
would wear a pink turtleneck?

28
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
The color is salmon.

29
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,400
That's the color
on the inside of a salmon.

30
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,100
I don't even think a fish
would wear that color on the outside.

31
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,500
Arc welder.

32
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,500
Here we are.

33
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,200
So is my favorite customer coming in?

34
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,800
Well, you gonna loan me a cup of coffee?

35
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,100
Depends on how you're gonna
pay me back.

36
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Oh, how's rocket man?

37
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,400
- He's fine, Frank. Fine.
- We're taking bets.

38
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,100
Really? What are the odds?

39
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,300
The bet is your husband
will never do it...

40
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,900
...or he's gonna blow himself up.

41
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,700
Nice.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,500
Yeah, we're all gonna become rich
on Farmer's failure.

43
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,600
What bet do you wanna cover?

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Why don't you cover this, Frank?

45
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,100
This space suit will allow me to control...

46
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,900
...the climate and the pressure
that you need to be in space.

47
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
It's kind of like having your own
personal weather inside here.

48
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,500
Because in space, it's very, very cold.

49
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Is there any questions?

50
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,900
Why don't you just put your hands down,
and we'll just kind of wing it here.

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,800
- Start here in the front. You.
- Did you buy it at Target?

52
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,300
No, I didn't buy it at Target.

53
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Where did you get it?

54
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Actually, someone was throwing it away,
and I just picked it up.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,100
Have you been to space?

56
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
No, not yet.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Stanley has been telling everyone
about their daddy the astronaut.

58
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,500
We need more parents
willing to play dress-up...

59
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,200
...to encourage the kids
to activate their imaginations.

60
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
Yes, ma'am.

61
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,400
So many parents just resort
to dressing up as clowns.

62
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,300
You've set a high standard
with this costume.

63
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,200
Well, I appreciate that.

64
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,800
You have a good day.

65
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,800
FuelFourU?

66
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,600
Apollo 13?

67
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,200
You never know
with these online screen names.

68
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,100
I really appreciate you coming out here.

69
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,500
Breakdown for you here.

70
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Ten thousand pounds of fuel.
Is this correct?

71
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,700
Yeah.

72
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,600
- You planning on launching a rocket?
- Yeah.

73
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,800
- You're shitting me, right?
- No.

74
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,700
- Something the matter?
- Well...

75
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,200
...ten pounds, 20 pounds, maybe even
a hundred, that's not a problem.

76
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Ten thousand pounds,
ten thousand problems.

77
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,700
- When do you need it?
- What's the damage?

78
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,500
Fifty grand.

79
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,600
Cash.

80
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,300
You're delinquent
on six mortgage payments already?

81
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,700
I don't know if you understand
how close you are to a foreclosure.

82
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,600
I don't think you understand
how close I am to launching.

83
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
Do you know how many times
I've heard that?

84
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,200
Arnie, it's an emergency, okay?

85
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, do I know it's an emergen--

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,900
We probably have 15 emergencies
written down right here.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Twenty. Twenty credit extensions.
Who on earth gets 20?

88
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,300
I assumed more than half that debt
from my dad.

89
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,100
And the bank assumes
that you're gonna pay it back.

90
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,800
Can I give you some advice?

91
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,500
I have no money to pay
for that advice, Arnie.

92
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,900
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your business.

93
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,400
- Well, then don't.
- But I have to...

94
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
...because I'm your friend first
and a banker second, all right?

95
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,700
Now, folks around here,
they think you're crazy.

96
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,600
I happen to think you're a genius.

97
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,100
You got bad credit,
but you got great character...

98
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,200
...and that rocket ship of yours
is amazing.

99
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,400
But as a friend, I have to
look you in the eye and say that...

100
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,100
...I think it's time you give it a rest.

101
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,900
Bye, Arnold.

102
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,700
I need a payment, Farmer!

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,300
Okay.

104
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing a balloon.

106
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing an oxygen tank.

107
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,100
- I believe you're going to the moon.
- I'm going to the moon...

108
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,000
- ...and I'm bringing Mr. Grump.
- No. But not on the table.

109
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,700
- You can't bring your hamster to the moon.
- Yes, I can.

110
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,800
Yes, she can.
I believe she's going to the moon.

111
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,400
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm gonna bring sugar.

112
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,200
Hey, sweetie, the objective is
to connect a common theme...

113
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,300
...based on what Daddy's bringing.

114
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,400
So I'm sorry, you can't go to the moon.

115
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,100
I never get to go.

116
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,400
Okay, my turn.

117
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing Sunshine.

118
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,100
Well, since she holds air, I believe
we're all going to the moon.

119
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,000
- What is that button for, Daddy?
- Oh, that button?

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,700
You girls better hang on.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

121
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,000
We're taking off! We're taking off!

122
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Oh, here we are. We're in space.

123
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
Isn't it beautiful out there?

124
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,100
Okay, what's that button for?

125
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
- That one?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,200
That's a very special button too.

127
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
That's the one that brings Daddy home.

128
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,500
We have to have that one,
because if Daddy didn't have that button...

129
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,400
...I'd be up there for a long, long time.

130
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Stanley, Sunshine, time for bed.

131
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,900
- Give me a hug, my angels.
- Good night.

132
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,400
Good night. Good night, sweetheart.

133
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,300
See you in a little bit.

134
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,600
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

135
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,200
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

136
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I just don't know if these gadgets
are gonna work until I launch, you know.

137
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,000
You don't believe I'm gonna launch it,
do you?

138
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,400
I always believe
you're gonna launch the rocket.

139
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,300
- Someday.
- Well, someday's coming fast.

140
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,100
- Charlie, it's so late.
- I've been working, baby.

141
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,600
Charles, you didn't even take a shower.
You smell like the rocket.

142
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
- You could've washed your hands.
- I did. I washed my hands.

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,300
Look at this.

144
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,200
Look at that.

145
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Honey, where's your w--?

146
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,400
Where's your wedding ring?

147
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,500
It's in the capsule somewhere.

148
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,200
- Oh, man, in the capsule somewhere.
- Well, honey, I--

149
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,900
Well, it came off.
I'll get it. Don't worry about it.

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,300
No, that's not a star.
That's a shooting star.

151
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,100
How come you guys
only eat the marshmallows?

152
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,900
- You don't like the cereal?
- Tastes like wood.

153
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,300
Here, a whole spoonful of marshmallows.

154
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,100
Yeah, but one piece of a cereal.

155
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,300
One piece of a cereal.
Okay, we gotta get that. Oh, there we go.

156
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,200
You know what you guys started me on?

157
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,700
I don't put milk on my cereal anymore,
and it's your fault.

158
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
- I don't put milk on my cereal.
- Oh, hey, honey.

159
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,500
Hey. Look who's here.

160
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,100
Hey. Whoa, easy, easy.
Take it easy.

161
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
- I love you, Grandpa.
- Go ahead, sweetie.

162
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
- Go say hi.
- What are you feeding them?

163
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,400
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Girls. My little tiny people.

164
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,700
Hey, Hal. How you feeling?

165
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm actually feeling fine.

166
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,400
- Come sit down, Hal. Come on.
- Here, Grandpa will walk you over, okay?

167
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,500
Boy, you've made real progress.

168
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,200
Yep.

169
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,100
It's gonna take a hell of a lot
more than gunpowder...

170
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,200
...to get this particular aircraft in the air.

171
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Yep.

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,100
I never knew it was this big.

173
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, you got yourself
some mighty pricey metal here, bud.

174
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,400
Yeah, well, you gotta
have the good stuff.

175
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,800
I'd have more than a carpet burn on my ass
if I didn't protect it.

176
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,600
Farmer?

177
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,100
Hey, Karl. How you doing, man?

178
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm gonna need your autograph
for this letter.

179
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,500
Goddamn, it certainly gets my attention.

180
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,100
- Appreciate it. I'll see you later, buddy.
- See you.

181
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,500
What--?

182
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,300
- Farmer!
- You want my house...

183
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,500
- ...I'll give it to you brick by brick.
- It was procedure, Farmer.

184
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,700
I didn't have a choice.

185
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,800
The bank wouldn't stand for it
a day longer, and neither would I.

186
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,300
You're way too overextended.

187
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,100
You're just a banker.
A friend wouldn't do what you did.

188
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,600
If I didn't care about you, I wouldn't
have sent it in. You got 30 days.

189
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Open your eyes. Look at this as
a wake-up call, because the dream is over.

190
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,500
It's gotta stop now,
before you lose everything.

191
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,200
Farmer.

192
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,300
What's up, Chopper? How's your daddy?

193
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,600
Waiting for you. Want a ride?

194
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,800
No, it's all right. Follow me.

195
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,900
What'd you do, Arnie?

196
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,200
How much does he owe the bank,
Arnold?

197
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,100
- Over 600,000 dollars.
- 600,000 dollars?

198
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,600
He's dangerous. He threw a brick at me.

199
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,100
That's enough, Arnold. That's enough.
Will the bank take an apology?

200
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,900
- Well?
- I guess...

201
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Farmer, give the bank an apology.

202
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,600
Say you're sorry.

203
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,200
- Arnold, I'm sorry.
- Great.

204
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,900
Now, Arnold, I'm going to administer
Farmer's spanking in private.

205
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Chopper, could you
see Arnold out for me?

206
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,900
Assume the position.

207
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,500
You're not really gonna whack me
with that thing, are you?

208
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,100
Come on. I've known you all your life.

209
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,100
But I do see you putting your family
and yourself at serious risk.

210
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,100
One day it's a brick,
the next day it's a bullet.

211
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,800
Men have been known
to do desperate things...

212
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,500
...when they're losing their ranches.

213
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,700
I'm gonna ask you to get...

214
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,300
...a psychiatric evaluation.

215
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,700
Before Arnold and me are comfortable
with you in society, you gotta see a shrink.

216
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Go over to the school, see Nurse Goode
over there, and talk to her.

217
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,700
Bring it back to me.

218
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,500
What'd they get you for?

219
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,200
Sleeping in class.

220
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,300
How about you?

221
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,000
I broke a window.

222
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,300
So, what do you wanna be
when you get out of here?

223
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,700
I don't know.

224
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,500
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

225
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,700
Well, let me tell you something...

226
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,200
...you better know what you wanna do
before somebody knows it for you.

227
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,700
Trust me.

228
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Farmer. Nurse Goode can see you now.

229
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay.

230
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,700
Well, good luck.

231
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,100
Charlie Farmer.

232
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,600
Hey, Beth. I was supposed to
give you this, the judge said.

233
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you. Okay.

234
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Don't you think that they're a little late
in labeling you crazy?

235
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
Jumping off a bridge is crazy.

236
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,900
- Oh, and building a rocket isn't.
- I threw a brick through a window.

237
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,300
That's why I'm here.

238
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Well, how would you like it if we discussed
your desire to leave the planet?

239
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,000
- Not particularly.
- Oh, Charlie.

240
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,700
I don't expect you to open up
and start talking in our very first session.

241
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,500
Session? There's sessions?

242
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,900
We're all onions, Charlie.

243
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,500
We have many, many,
many layers to get through.

244
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,000
See what I'm saying? And, just like...

245
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,500
...well, when you peel an onion,
there may be tears as we come--

246
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,700
Beth, please stop it, okay?

247
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,500
Listen, my daddy never told me
that he loved me.

248
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,400
And, you know, I'm pretty sure
that your daddy never did either.

249
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
The resentment that you feel
towards your parents...

250
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
...is not going to fuel your rocket.

251
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,500
- Are you done?
- Well, you're not getting it.

252
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,500
The rocket is not going to bring you
a happy childhood.

253
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,200
We all just have to grow up
and just take responsibility.

254
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,100
Remember during our high school prom,
I asked you go to the moon with me?

255
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,100
Well, shoot, Charlie,
that was just about getting laid.

256
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,600
Well, I'm still going.

257
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
We're not done, Charlie.

258
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,300
Is this considered another session?

259
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,600
Have you ever thought
of going into teaching?

260
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,800
What the hell would I teach?
What not to do?

261
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,800
No. Charlie, you could inspire
some young kid to do what you can't.

262
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,300
But I can, and I will, Beth.

263
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,900
I hate to be the one breaking it to you,
but you are not an astronaut.

264
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,900
It didn't happen, and that's okay.

265
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,300
You know,
the military's not for everyone...

266
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,100
...but we all just still love you,
and you didn't fail...

267
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,500
- ...and don't look at it that way.
- Oh, I don't.

268
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,900
- Oh, my God, do you need help.
- Yes, you're right, I do need help.

269
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,900
I need to find Shepard
because I gotta launch in 30 days.

270
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,500
You have to find a way
to channel your anger...

271
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,000
...or else it will manifest itself
into something...

272
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,800
...like, you know, a rocket ship.

273
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,900
Charlie Farmer.

274
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,300
Ms. Graham, I'm here to inspire a kid.

275
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
I could use an engineer
such as yourself at the house.

276
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Why don't you get your things,
and let's go.

277
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Excuse me, but we're in the middle
of a history lesson.

278
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,600
I apologize, Ms. Graham, but you're
teaching him how to read history...

279
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,500
...and I'm gonna show him how to make it.
You have a good day, hon.

280
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,100
- Where are we going?
- Home.

281
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,900
Home? Do we see the--?

282
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,500
Where's the house?
I don't see it anywhere.

283
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,400
Well, it's a long ways to home.

284
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,500
Every one of you is now part
of the Farmer space program.

285
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,100
If anyone feels that he or she is not fit
to be in the Farmer space program...

286
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,400
...then you should say your piece now.

287
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Does that mean we don't
have to go to school?

288
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
Correct.

289
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,900
But every morning,
we're gonna hold class...

290
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,000
...and study your regular subjects...

291
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,500
...so when you return to school,
you won't be behind.

292
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,600
- Yes, sir.
- Any questions?

293
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,700
- Is that all?
- No, honey, not yet.

294
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,500
How big is it?

295
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,100
- It's big.
- Big?

296
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,500
- So you've seen it?
- Of course I have.

297
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,800
And you think that he'll let me see it?

298
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
- Depends.
- Depends? On what?

299
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,100
It's not like I'm gonna go
running all over town, "I've seen it."

300
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,400
I'm telling. You told.

301
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,100
Hey. You and Phyllis been out playing?

302
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,300
What's going on?

303
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,700
Why aren't the children in school?

304
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,200
I'll address your issues after the briefing.
We're not quite finished.

305
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,000
Charles, you need to answer my question.
What's going on?

306
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,400
Oh, hey, Hal. You wanna
be part of the program?

307
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
- Sir?
- The space program.

308
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
- Charles. Bye, Phyllis.
- You guys are released, okay?

309
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,800
I want you here tomorrow morning
at 0500 sharp, okay?

310
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,200
Now, go back to the house. All right.

311
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,800
They're going back to school tomorrow.

312
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,100
It's five weeks maximum,
and they're back at school, I promise you.

313
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,600
You know that they're never gonna
get the kind of education at school...

314
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
...that they can get here.

315
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,000
They don't even teach science
in these schools anymore.

316
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,500
You know what Shepard's science teacher
said to him? I mean, get this.

317
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,800
She said, "Science isn't sexy."

318
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,500
I mean, do you want your girls to grow up
only knowing when Mercury's in retrograde?

319
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,200
- You know?
- What the hell happened to you?

320
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,100
It's five weeks maximum, and then
they're back in school, I promise. Okay?

321
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,200
Unit 4-0 to Central.

322
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Do we know how many entrances
there are to this property?

323
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,500
I believe there are four entrances
to the property. Four entrances.

324
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,100
I don't know if they're gated or not.

325
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Suspect has been trying
to secure rocket fuel, over.

326
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Roger, we copy.
Miller is about 100 yards out.

327
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,600
You should be able to see him.
He's coming down the hill, over.

328
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Be aware there are seven suspects. We have
on visual suspect, one Jesus Garcia.

329
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,800
We copy that.

330
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Killbourne, Mathis,
currently securing the barn.

331
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,800
Can I help you?

332
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,600
- Charles Farmer?
- Yeah.

333
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,300
We're with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

334
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Sir, we have been made aware,
through electronic documents...

335
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,300
...that you have been searching
for a high-grade fuel commonly used...

336
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,600
...to launch rockets.

337
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,400
Are you aware that you have an illegal
alien working on your premises?

338
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
Pepe Garcia. Jesus Garcia.

339
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
If you cooperate, we could see to it...

340
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,200
...that Mr. Garcia
could stay here with your family.

341
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,700
We're going to the moon.

342
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,900
- That's really rotten.
- It's rather generous of us.

343
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,800
And where is that man going?

344
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
It's very simple, Mr. Farmer...

345
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,300
...it's illegal to try to obtain
such a high-grade fuel for private use.

346
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,000
Anyone trying to acquire this kind of fuel
has to be considered a threat.

347
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,100
This is the real deal.

348
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,000
- Well, I'm no threat.
- Well, how do we know...

349
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,100
- ...you're not building a warhead?
- Because I'm not at war.

350
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,400
We just wanna let you know
your little rocket ain't gonna fly...

351
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,800
...as long as we're doing
this investigation.

352
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,300
Yeah.

353
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,000
I filled out the FAA application,
sent it in over six months ago.

354
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Sent all my flight plans,
illustrations of the vessel...

355
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,900
...never heard anything back
saying I couldn't launch.

356
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,300
They didn't think you were serious.

357
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,300
- Well, how can they stop me now?
- Jeez, Farmer.

358
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,900
With this Patriot Act, the way
they've twisted the laws up so much...

359
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
...they can do whatever
they please...

360
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,500
...as long as they feel you're a threat
to homeland security.

361
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
What do you want me to do?

362
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,700
Well, twist it some more.
Isn't that what lawyers are good at?

363
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,000
All right. Did they say they were
gonna press any charges?

364
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,700
Well, no, not exactly.
They said I'm under investigation.

365
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,300
That means they're gonna
be watching your every move.

366
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
Yeah.

367
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,600
I got a buddy in Manhattan.

368
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,400
He's a partner in one of these big firms
that specializes in cases like this.

369
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,700
- Give it a try.
- Maybe he can...

370
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,100
...shed some light on the situation.

371
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,500
He owes me a favor.
It won't cost you a nickel.

372
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,300
Set it up. Grab the boom.

373
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Going into space
doesn't take NASA anymore.

374
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Friends, we are here at the entrance
of the space cowboy's ranch.

375
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,100
We are told that behind me,
in this barn, is a rocket...

376
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,100
...a rocket that Charles Farmer
wants to launch into outer space.

377
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,600
After graduating
from Meriwether Lewis High School...

378
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,500
...he continued his education
at the University of Texas...

379
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,900
...where he received a degree
in aerospace engineering.

380
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,100
Soon after, Charles Farmer
enlisted in the Air Force...

381
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,500
...where he developed his skills as a pilot,
flying such planes as the F-4 Phantom.

382
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The rocketeer Charles Farmer
was in fact training to be an astronaut...

383
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,600
...before he was discharged
from the military.

384
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,100
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up?

385
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,000
Holy cow, Munchak.
You didn't tell me your friend was CNN.

386
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,800
This is what he said.
He said embrace the media, Farmer.

387
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Invite them in.
They're for your protection.

388
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,900
You want them on your side, Farmer.

389
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,000
All right.

390
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,900
He built the rocket.
I'm sure he built a retractable roof.

391
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,200
- Really?
- I don't think he'd build a rocket...

392
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,600
...and forget about the roof.

393
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,200
- Unless he never plans on launching it.
- Then why are we here?

394
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,500
Because if we aren't here,
and he launches...

395
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,300
...we're gonna look like asses.

396
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,600
And if he does, and we are here?

397
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,300
We still look like asses.

398
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,100
- There he is!
- Mr. Farmer!

399
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,700
Mr. Farmer, quick question.

400
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,500
Listen, if you guys settle down
and ask your questions one at a time...

401
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,000
...I'll answer them
to the best of my ability.

402
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,900
Is it important to you that people know
the importance of space travel?

403
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,400
I'll put it to you this way.
There are a lot of people in this world...

404
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,200
...that think Michael Jackson
had the first moonwalk.

405
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Mr. Farmer, when do you plan
on launching your rocket?

406
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,200
- Soon.
- Mr. Farmer, why are you doing this?

407
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,200
It's always been my dream.

408
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,500
The rocket is huge. It's really big.

409
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,100
He's more of an astro-nut.

410
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,700
- Who was it?
- My wife.

411
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,800
She wants an autograph.

412
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,800
You hear about this? There's a guy in Texas
building his own rocket in his back yard.

413
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,500
This guy is planning
on launching himself into orbit.

414
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,400
Here's my question.
Wouldn't it be easier just to say:

415
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,100
"Honey, I want a divorce"?
Okay, wouldn't that be--?

416
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
That's not very funny.

417
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,700
Looks like a really beautiful day today.

418
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,200
Afternoon high of 65,
down to 35 tonight.

419
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,000
- Morning, Hal.
- And if you're launching a rocket...

420
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,900
...the weather looks really good
over most of the country.

421
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,500
This is what's known
as the rocket graveyard.

422
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Farmer gathered most of what he needed
from places like this.

423
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,600
If you're looking to build a rocket,
this is the place to start.

424
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,200
Farmer's rocket is housed
in the barn that you're seeing below.

425
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Due to the overwhelming interest,
he has opened his barn to the public...

426
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,200
...allowing them
to view the rocket themselves...

427
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,600
...only hoping to alleviate
some of this congestion.

428
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,500
Can he do it? Well, sure he can.

429
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,800
Now, will he do it? That's to be seen.

430
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,300
There are lots of FAA regulations...

431
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,900
...that keep people from turning
the sky into a playground.

432
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,200
But the astronaut's plans
for space travel...

433
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,000
...first have to be approved by the FAA.
A hearing has been scheduled.

434
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,100
How long will the government
not allow you to launch your rocket?

435
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
- They're not stopping me.
- Is it true...

436
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,300
...Elton John plans to re-release
"Rocket Man" to help raise money?

437
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,200
This is exactly
what we didn't want to happen.

438
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,700
Let's get what we can on this guy.
Find something.

439
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,600
We gotta get this space cowboy's
head out of the clouds.

440
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,800
Pack up, boys. We're going to Texas.

441
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,900
Well, the man deserves a second chance.

442
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
All right, more presents.

443
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
That's the last of it.

444
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
Hey, Stanley.

445
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,100
Why don't you change your hamster cage?
Use paper--

446
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,700
Now, wait a minute. I'd like to see that.
Come on, let me have a look.

447
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,300
Don't believe everything you read,
honey. It just...

448
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,800
- I wanna read it.
- I wish she had your paper, Pepe.

449
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,400
She can't read Spanish.

450
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,500
Your dad's right.

451
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,200
- Change your hamster cage.
- Okay.

452
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,900
They called us a cult. They said we were
like a branch of the Moonies or something.

453
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,300
They think our family's
a bunch of space cadets.

454
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,700
I know. I know.

455
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,500
- How can they do that?
- Because they can.

456
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,400
We are a normal family. We need
to go tell everyone that it isn't true.

457
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Well, honey, we just need
to show them, okay?

458
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We got a winner here. It's a winner!

459
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,200
Hey, here you go, bud.

460
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,500
That's what I get?

461
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,500
Don't you worry about them.

462
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,600
Just forget about them, Charles.

463
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,800
- Thank you.
- For what, baby?

464
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,400
For this.

465
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,600
Excuse me. I wanna talk to you
about the ride.

466
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,800
Two tickets.

467
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,900
No, sir. I mean, if I wanted to buy this ride
from you, how much would it cost me?

468
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,500
Well, you can rent it for 500 a week.

469
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,600
- Can we talk some business?
- Sure.

470
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,800
- Yeah?
- Absolutely. You gonna be around?

471
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah, I'll be here.

472
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,400
Colonel Masterson.

473
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Up there in space, you get
a totally different perspective.

474
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,600
Different every time.

475
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Different perspective of the Earth.
Different perspective of yourself.

476
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,800
Every time's completely different.

477
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,100
It's just...

478
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,300
It's just beautiful, is what it is.

479
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
Beautiful.

480
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,100
You see the world, and you realize
how small we all are.

481
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,900
Life-changing.

482
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,700
Definitely life-changing.

483
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,400
This is good chicken, Audrey.

484
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,900
- Thank you.
- You're about to make me start crying.

485
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,400
My last mission was on the Endeavor.

486
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I don't know who they are.

487
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,000
It's the name of the space shuttle
Colonel Masterson flew on.

488
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,300
We don't have a name for our rocket.

489
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,400
You don't?

490
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,900
You don't have a name
for your rocket, Farmer?

491
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,400
Well, we just hadn't got to that part yet.

492
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,100
We're gonna have to think of some
names, aren't we?

493
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,200
Sunshine?

494
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,000
- Licorice.
- Licorice?

495
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,000
Okay, who's for Licorice?

496
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
Okay.

497
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Now, Stanley submitted the name
of the Rockin' Rocket.

498
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,200
- Who wants Rockin' Rocket?
- I like that.

499
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,800
Uncle Eddie has voted
for everything we've said so far.

500
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,600
- I'm taking this as seriously as you are.
- Okay.

501
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,600
Now, Shepard has decided,
as you told me before...

502
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,600
- ...you wanna change your name?
- Yeah, I'm changing my name.

503
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,100
I'll think about it more.
I'm not sure what I want.

504
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,000
Okay. Pepe.

505
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,700
What does that mean?

506
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,700
It ain't gonna be the name of the rocket,
so don't worry.

507
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,300
What does it mean, though?
Because if we're all going to vote on it--

508
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,600
It means "the other woman," honey.

509
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,600
No. You are not voting for that name.

510
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,300
I think we should go out
and see the other woman.

511
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,800
Son of a bitch, Farmer.

512
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,500
- You built this thing?
- Bolt by bolt.

513
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,400
That is some serious engineering.

514
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,600
You don't think they'd have
brought you down here...

515
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,800
...if it was a bottle rocket, do you?

516
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,900
Good grief.

517
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,400
- You're serious about this.
- Absolutely.

518
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,600
Lookie here, you.

519
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What happens...

520
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,600
...if the rocket doesn't launch?

521
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,700
I know it's not the company line here.
I know.

522
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,300
But I'm a dad, baby.

523
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,700
Well, that's why he needs our support
regardless of the outcome.

524
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,700
It's not mandatory.

525
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,600
No, it's love.

526
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,900
What do you think?

527
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,300
I think that it is gonna be one sad-ass day
up here in Farmerville...

528
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,300
...when they haul all your hard work
off to the junkyard.

529
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,200
I think that. What do you think?

530
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You think they're gonna let you
go up into outer space?

531
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,500
A civilian?

532
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,300
They don't let civilians
go up into outer space.

533
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,600
Astronauts go into outer space.

534
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,900
Professional astronauts
who have been trained...

535
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,700
...to withstand the pressures
and the strain...

536
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,700
...and the emotional stress
of leaving your family behind.

537
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,500
Ed, you know my dad died.
That's why I left.

538
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,300
- Of course I know your dad--
- My family needed me.

539
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,200
But if that was a test, you failed.

540
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,100
What do you think NASA was thinking?

541
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,000
This boy's gonna go into outer space.
His dad dies, and he wants to go home.

542
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,300
I thought there's one person on this earth
that might understand, and that's you.

543
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,400
I really-- I really didn't expect this.

544
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,100
What if I told you I could get you
a seat on the shuttle?

545
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,800
I'd say I don't wanna
hitch a ride on the bus.

546
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,500
Forget that. Forget about
hitching a ride on the bus, okay?

547
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,700
Forget the rocket. You forget the rocket
that you put a lot of hard work into.

548
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,700
You get these people off your back,
get these idiots with cameras out of here...

549
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,200
...then you go up into outer space
the right way.

550
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,100
The safe way.

551
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,600
- You don't think I can do it, do you?
- Forget that.

552
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,600
This is about money.
Not even millions of dollars anymore...

553
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,600
...billions of dollars. 16.2 billion dollars
in this year's budget alone.

554
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,700
- For what?
- Who cares for what.

555
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,400
For whatever they want.

556
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,800
They're not gonna let you go up
in your John Deere riding lawnmower...

557
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,400
...into outer space
and try and come back down...

558
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,000
...and make them look stupid.
Do you think that's really gonna happen?

559
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Don't answer me now.
I don't want your answer right now.

560
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,500
But I want you to think about it.

561
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Nice rocket, though.

562
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Will Charles Farmer be allowed
to launch his rocket?

563
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,400
That's why we're here today.

564
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,900
The FAA, FBI, CIA, the Department
of Energy, and members of the military.

565
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,500
- They're all here.
- What do you think about all this?

566
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,900
Looks like we got home-field advantage,
don't it?

567
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,700
They're not allowing cameras
or the media inside during the hearing.

568
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,900
We are assembled here
to review an application...

569
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,600
...for the launching of a spacecraft.

570
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,500
We'll be asking a series of questions.
Answer to the best of your knowledge.

571
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,900
Yes, sir.

572
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,700
Let's begin with your flight plan
that you've submitted.

573
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,100
Your plan is to do one complete orbit
of the Earth.

574
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,800
Once completed, the capsule
will re-enter the atmosphere.

575
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,800
Sounds easy. Simple.

576
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,300
- Yes, sir.
- Well, it's not.

577
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,500
I would submit that's the gentleman's
opinion, not a statement of fact.

578
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,600
You are aware this is not a court of law.

579
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,000
I am, but I'm not gonna sit here
like a potted plant.

580
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,900
I hope not.

581
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,700
As head of the FAA, my opinion
might have some credence...

582
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,000
- ...on the subject of space flight.
- Yes, sir.

583
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,200
You based your design
on the Atlas rocket, yes?

584
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,300
- Yes, sir.
- Were you aware that the Atlas...

585
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,300
...comes from the design
of a ballistic missile?

586
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,200
- Yes, sir.
- So basically...

587
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,700
- ...you've built a missile in your barn.
- That's incorrect.

588
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,900
Will Beacon, Central Intelligence Agency.

589
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,600
How do we know
that you're not constructing a WMD?

590
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Well, because if I was building
a weapon of mass destruction...

591
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,600
...you wouldn't be able to find it.

592
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,200
- Very funny, Mr. Farmer.
- That's just the truth.

593
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Here we are. Thanks for waiting.

594
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,200
Hi, thanks for waiting.
Can I take your order?

595
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,100
- Audie Farmer? The astronaut's wife?
- Yes, ma'am. What can I get for you?

596
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,700
Gretchen Boyd
from Child Protective Services.

597
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,800
Would you please sit down?

598
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,600
- No, thank you.
- Mrs. Farmer...

599
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,100
...it has come to our attention...

600
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,800
...that your children, as well as yourself,
may be in harm's way.

601
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,000
How so?

602
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,700
Your husband has literally brainwashed
you and your children.

603
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,700
He's taken them out of school...

604
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,900
...and he has isolated his entire family
from any other outside influence.

605
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:06,200
It's time you took control of your family
before someone else does it for you.

606
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,800
- Who's your personnel at Mission Control?
- Shepard Farmer, my son.

607
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,200
- Does he have any experience?
- Sure does. Fifteen years.

608
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Is this a joke to you, Mr. Farmer?

609
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,500
A 15-year-old will be the head
of your mission control?

610
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,300
He's perfectly capable
of launching his dad into space.

611
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,300
- Don't underestimate what my child can do.
- Come on. He's 15 years old.

612
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,100
We also have an evaluation that was
done recently by a Dr. Beth Goode.

613
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,800
Nurse Goode?

614
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,300
These are alarming comments
made by the doctor.

615
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,900
She said that Mr. Farmer is angry...

616
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,500
...unstable...

617
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,000
...delusional...

618
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,700
...and that his overall mental health
is in question.

619
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,100
Charlie, your father took his own life,
is that correct?

620
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,100
Don't go there, colonel.

621
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
I can tell you right now,
what you have built here...

622
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,700
...is a one-way ticket to the afterlife.

623
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,900
A facility in which Mr. Farmer
could get himself into space.

624
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,500
The U.S. government
has a space program, Mr. Farmer.

625
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,200
Why don't you just leave this
to the professionals?

626
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,800
In 1960 they started a space race.

627
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,300
By 1969 we were on the moon.

628
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,900
Now, in that short period of time,
look what we accomplished.

629
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,900
And in my opinion,
I believe that if some other country...

630
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,100
...wanted to go to the moon
and live there...

631
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,400
...we'd get in a war with them
because we think the moon is ours.

632
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
Well, it's not.

633
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,500
Just like it's not your right to tell me
whether or not I can launch into space.

634
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,400
Mr. Farmer, we have laws.

635
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,900
I know we have laws.
We got all kind of laws.

636
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,200
We got more laws to tell us
what we can't do than anything else.

637
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,300
We got laws to protect us
from other laws.

638
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,900
- Comments like that do not help.
- Listen, you've been talking all morning.

639
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,600
Let me talk for a minute.

640
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,200
Okay?

641
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,600
I won't take long.

642
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,200
When I was a kid, they used to tell me
that I could be anything I wanted to be.

643
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,000
No matter what.

644
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,400
And maybe I am insane, I don't know,
but I still believe that.

645
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,300
I believe it with all my heart.

646
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,600
Somewhere along the line...

647
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,400
...we stopped believing
that we could do anything.

648
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,300
And if we don't have our dreams,
we have nothing.

649
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,600
You'll be informed of our decision.

650
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,300
I'm gonna save your life.

651
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,100
I'm gonna tell you something
that no one else in there will tell you.

652
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,000
The U.S. military has enough firepower
pointed at your ranch...

653
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,500
...that if you decide to launch...

654
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:31,200
...within seconds, your remains
will be spread over five states.

655
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,700
- Is that a threat?
- No.

656
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,700
You're the threat.

657
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Don't believe a word he says, Farmer.

658
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,600
Nobody's gonna fire any missiles at you.

659
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,100
They have no law to stop you,
so they're just trying to intimidate you.

660
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,500
I don't know.

661
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,400
Actually, I think they're pretty good
at assassinating people who have dreams.

662
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,600
Where's your helmet?

663
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,800
Now, I think that's it, Mrs. Farmer.

664
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,100
Thank you.

665
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,300
- So is it true?
- What?

666
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,400
Got a million dollars for your story?

667
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,200
No, Vanessa, it's not true.

668
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,400
I won't tell anyone. I read about it in--

669
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,300
Vanessa, it's not true.

670
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,300
Your total is 86.05.

671
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,500
Sorry. Here.

672
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,900
Watch your fingers.

673
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,600
I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer,
but your card was declined.

674
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,300
Would you like to try another one?

675
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,900
Can you just keep all this here...

676
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,200
...and we'll come back
in a little while, okay?

677
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,100
Come on, girls. Come on.

678
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,600
I'm going to the moon...

679
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,600
...and I'm bringing this brick.

680
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,400
Kids, your mom and I
need a private moment.

681
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,700
No. This has been private long enough.

682
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,400
Now, you can lie to me as much as you
want, Charles, but don't lie to them.

683
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,400
Tell them.

684
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Tell them we might not have a house
in a few weeks.

685
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,900
- Knock it off, Audie, okay, please?
- No, you knock it off.

686
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,200
- Please, knock it off.
- And what was your plan?

687
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,600
Blasting off this Earth...

688
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,100
...and leaving us here to deal with
the consequences? With no money...

689
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,000
- ...nothing, no money for food?
- Oh, really? Is that right?

690
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,800
I'm sorry.

691
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,300
So we don't have any food?
Is that what you think?

692
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,600
Kids, you don't have anything
to worry about...

693
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,000
...because we got plenty of food, okay?

694
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Here's food.

695
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,800
You want macaroni and cheese?
You want salmon in white sauce?

696
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,700
- You want rice pilaf?
- Stop it!

697
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,700
- We got all kinds of food!
- Shepard, take the children out of here.

698
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,200
What, do you wanna throw that?
You gonna throw something at me, Audie?

699
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,100
- Is that what you wanna do? Go ahead!
- You wanna see flying saucers?

700
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,900
Don't you ever accuse me of that again
in front of the kids. You understand me?

701
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,600
You're not taking care of us
when we don't have a home!

702
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,300
You have to keep us safe!

703
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,200
And this dream that we all share
feeds one person, and that's you!

704
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,800
You're gonna lose everything, Charles,
including your family.

705
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,800
Now, I need to clean up this kitchen.

706
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,600
I'm sorry I did this.

707
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,600
Audie.

708
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,000
I love you and those kids
more than anything in this world.

709
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But if I don't do what I believe in...

710
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,800
...then I haven't done them
any good at all.

711
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,500
I have always believed.

712
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,100
I just don't know anymore.

713
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,900
Okay. Here we go.

714
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,600
- Hold Mommy's purse.
- Audie?

715
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,300
Audie, honey, you don't have to leave.

716
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It's Sunday. We're going to church.

717
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,900
I'm hoping they'll learn something about
forgiveness, because they'll need it.

718
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,900
- Come on, Audie, don't do that.
- No, Charles. They worship you.

719
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,100
And so that I don't get bitter...

720
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,500
...and call you an ass for lying to us...

721
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,000
...I'm gonna have to figure out
a way to forgive you.

722
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,300
And so will they.

723
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,400
You know, I tell you one thing.

724
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,700
You are one fabulous father.

725
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,400
And you know why, Farmer?

726
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,800
This man couldn't even get his family
to eat dinner together.

727
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,200
But you have got your family...

728
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,000
...dreaming together.

729
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,300
That is big stuff, sir.

730
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,600
Really big stuff.

731
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,300
Boy, they gotta burn a lot of fuel
to run them cars, you know it?

732
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,600
Gotta wonder if all them cars would
be going around in circles like that...

733
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,000
...if they didn't have all that advertising.

734
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,000
The fact of the matter is, Doug,
if you advertise on my rocket...

735
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,600
...it's gonna raise your sales.

736
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,700
It just stands to reason.
Plus, you'll be getting attention...

737
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,000
...that you normally wouldn't get
from conventional methods.

738
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,200
Now, I've got a letter out
to the CEO of Coca-Cola.

739
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,100
I expect to hear back from them soon.

740
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,100
If they come onboard,
they'll be right here.

741
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:18,100
But before they come on and paint
the whole thing red, you got your choice.

742
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,100
I mean, look at this.

743
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,100
Can you imagine?

744
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,700
Dunkin' Donuts blasting off into space.

745
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,600
What if your mission's aborted...

746
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,600
...or your success doesn't measure
to this final statement?

747
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,700
- What are you implying?
- The risk factor is high, Farmer.

748
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,000
But it's an educated risk.

749
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,300
Did you read the case study on Tang?

750
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,500
The profits they made off putting
that orange dust up onboard.

751
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,600
I've made a graph. Did you look at it?

752
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,100
Oh, yeah, Tang.
I raised three kids on that stuff.

753
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,700
Well, it's full of vitamins.

754
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,300
What's that little old cheesy deal
y'all got now?

755
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,400
I mean, tell me what happens
if your whole mission goes to shit.

756
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,200
- I mean, I can't deal with much more of it.
- You mean, like, if I die?

757
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,300
If something were
to happen to you, Farmer...

758
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,900
...candy sprinkles, M&M's,
Oreo cookies...

759
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,200
...there's no amount of topping...

760
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,300
...that would cover the amount
of guilt that I would have.

761
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,200
Look, if you die...

762
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,900
...the book deal, Good Morning America,
that TV movie, Jay Leno...

763
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,000
...all that vanishes.

764
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,800
Without a successful mission, I don't
see the profits breaking into the red.

765
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,200
I might as well go put my money
in Kleenex stock...

766
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,100
...because all you're gonna be producing
is a ton of tears.

767
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,200
But if you circle the world...

768
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,800
...you land back over in your back yard
like your mission plan says...

769
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,500
...you're a man-made American hero.

770
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,300
Now if I could only launch a rocket
with jelly doughnuts.

771
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,000
Sunshine, why don't you go
give your grandpa one, okay?

772
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,200
He loves the sprinkles.
Take Grandpa a doughnut. There you go.

773
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,400
- Take Grandpa a doughnut.
- Just have two, okay?

774
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,300
Just two.

775
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,100
- Do you want one?
- No, honey, I've already had three or four.

776
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,400
With, like, seven cups of coffee and...

777
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,500
Grandpa, here's a doughnut.

778
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,500
Grandpa, here's a doughnut.

779
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,400
- Grandpa no wake up.
- What, sweetie?

780
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,300
Grandpa no wake up.

781
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,700
Dad?

782
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,600
Oh, Dad.

783
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,700
There are no stop signs up there.

784
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
There is no defining space.

785
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,500
We have always defined our space.

786
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,500
A wall here, a room there.

787
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,100
A hallway, a road.

788
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,500
We have this way of dividing our space
until it equals a direction.

789
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,500
We even created a space for the dead.

790
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,900
Space is a difficult thing to grasp.

791
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,100
Man, Farmer...

792
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,900
...you have the most abstract thoughts.

793
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,200
They don't make any sense at all.

794
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:41,100
I'm just waiting for the other thoughts
to string all this mess together.

795
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,500
Hey, who's that out there?

796
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,800
Maybe one of Hal's long-lost friends.

797
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,100
How you doing?

798
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,100
How many head of cattle
do you run out here?

799
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Enough to suit me.

800
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,800
You are the property owner?

801
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,400
Yeah.

802
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,500
- Charles Farmer.
- Correct.

803
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,200
I'm appraising your land
for First National Bank...

804
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,700
...who's actively seeking a foreclosure.

805
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,200
What was your name?

806
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,600
Sir?

807
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,800
- What was your name again?
- Robert Wilson.

808
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Robert, nice to meet you.

809
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,200
You know, I own 352 acres.

810
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,500
Did you ever try to find a body
on that much land?

811
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,800
I'm not the bad guy here, mister.

812
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,300
Well, you're not the good guy either.

813
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,600
Shep, look here. I think I've figured out
another way to make our fuel.

814
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,400
We combine kerosene with hydrazine.

815
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,600
Are you sure, Dad?

816
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,400
Son, I don't know another way to do it
unless we completely modify the engine.

817
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,900
Plus, we got all the stuff
right here in the barn.

818
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,200
The fuel will still be pumped in
at a high pressure...

819
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,000
...and it'll burn in the chamber...

820
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,100
...create the same exhaust gases
as the high-grade rocket fuel.

821
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,800
That should provide enough thrust
to send me into orbit.

822
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,500
Make sense?

823
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,200
Yeah. Yeah.

824
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,100
Farmer?

825
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,100
- Yeah, I'm down here in the engine room.
- Hey.

826
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,900
- They made a ruling yet?
- Why do you think I'm here?

827
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,500
The committee wants 60 days
to make a ruling.

828
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,700
But I don't have 60 days.
The bank's gonna foreclose in a week.

829
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,700
I'm aware of that.

830
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,100
- I just don't have that kind of time.
- That's their plan.

831
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,200
Do you think they want you
to launch this?

832
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,800
They'll stall, stall, stall.

833
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,900
And then there'll be appeals.
This'll go on forever.

834
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,900
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for that?

835
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,900
I'm sorry about the ruling, Farmer.

836
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,200
Yeah.

837
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,000
You know, my father loved ranching.

838
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,100
He loved it with all his heart.

839
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,600
It was his dream.

840
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,400
Then when it got tough...

841
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,400
...and he knew they were gonna
try to take it away from him...

842
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,900
...he put a gun to his head...

843
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,600
...before they could.

844
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,500
And that bullet's still traveling.

845
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,600
It just keeps on going.

846
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,200
And now it's headed
straight for my dream.

847
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,700
Just promise me
you're not gonna do something stupid.

848
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
- Like what? Build a rocket?
- No.

849
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,800
You know better than that.

850
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,800
I've walked away before...

851
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,400
...and I can't walk away again.

852
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,800
Charles?

853
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,000
I can't just keep failing.

854
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,000
I hope you understand that.

855
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,400
I promise you everything will be okay.

856
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,400
No.

857
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,700
Shepard!

858
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,300
Come on.

859
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,700
Damn!

860
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,700
Charlie.

861
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,600
Charlie, can you hear me?

862
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:07,100
No, don't move. Don't move your body.
Don't move it, sweetie.

863
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,200
Oh, my God.

864
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,200
Don't you dare leave this family.
You stay with me!

865
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,600
Six broken ribs. Broken left wrist.

866
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,700
Compound fracture to the fibula.

867
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,200
Severe head trauma.
Multiple lacerations to the face.

868
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,600
Is there any good news?

869
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,900
He's alive.

870
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,600
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

871
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,600
You gotta be strong
for your daddy, now, okay?

872
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:36,200
Now, he wants to hear how much
we love him, okay? It's really important.

873
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,500
You okay?

874
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,900
Yeah? How about you?
You all right, sweetheart?

875
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,200
Stanley?

876
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,600
Come here, sweetheart.

877
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,500
Why don't we go get
something to drink.

878
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,000
Will you stay with him, honey?

879
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,200
Stanley? Stanley. Honey.

880
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,700
Dad?

881
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,000
It's Shep, Dad.

882
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,900
I was looking in the barn today...

883
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,900
...and we can build another one
just like it. I swear we can.

884
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,100
We have everything
right in there in the barn.

885
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,500
We could build everything.

886
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,900
I swear, we can build another one
just like it. We just need you back.

887
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,700
You can't give up. You can't give up.

888
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:18,800
And, children, when they say,
"Don't try this at home," they mean it.

889
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,500
Okay. Go ahead. Yeah. What? Okay.

890
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,600
Ask them how long they want us
to stay here. Ask them.

891
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,200
Okay. Yeah. All right.

892
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,400
They told us to hang tight.

893
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,800
Grab a couple of these mugs.
They make good souvenirs.

894
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,700
There's no logo on them.

895
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:47,000
The blending of high-test rocket fuel
is clearly not a project for amateurs.

896
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,300
This is why we have such strict rules
and regulations in place.

897
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,600
Space flight is a serious endeavor,
not to be taken lightly.

898
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,700
We can only hope
that through this near-fatal tragedy...

899
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,100
...other space enthusiasts
get the real message...

900
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:04,800
...displayed by Mr. Farmer here,
and not the one hyped up by the media.

901
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,500
No further questions.

902
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,700
How stupid I am.

903
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,300
This a lecture
that you want me to hear?

904
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,700
No.

905
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,500
You're alive, stupid.

906
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,000
They gotta get me some cereal.

907
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,500
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing--

908
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,600
Oh, sweetie, let's not
play that game tonight, okay?

909
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,100
But why?

910
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,900
Because she said so.

911
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,300
Please, honey.

912
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,300
It's okay.

913
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:39,000
Shepard, you gotta give him some time.

914
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,700
Daddy's real tired, you know?
He needs to-- He needs to get some rest.

915
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,500
Albeit handwritten, your dad's will
is pretty straightforward.

916
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,400
Three trust funds for the kids.

917
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:21,000
After that, 200,000 in assets.
Another 100,000 in cash.

918
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,100
Some stocks and bonds.

919
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,600
It's all yours.

920
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,200
Troubles with the bank are over, anyway.

921
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,800
Thank you.

922
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,000
- Look, I found one!
- Look, I found one!

923
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,400
That's good, baby.

924
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:20,200
- Look, I found one again!
- Look, I found one again!

925
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,800
Have them come get that rocket
and take it to the junkyard.

926
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,600
- Charles.
- Audie, it's already hurt them enough.

927
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,800
I don't want it
to hurt this family anymore.

928
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:02,300
Well, everything is now current
and up-to-date.

929
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:05,900
I have stopped the foreclosure.
No worries.

930
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,300
Thanks, Arnie.

931
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,200
You did the right thing.

932
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Oh, boy.

933
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:18,600
Did Farmer have us all believing
he was going off into outer space.

934
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,400
How stupid do we look?

935
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,400
What?

936
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,800
When we took our vows...

937
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,000
...we promised to love each other
in sickness and in health.

938
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:54,500
Did that mean mental health?
Because you are crazy.

939
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,100
I mean, when you first said you wanted
to go into space, I thought:

940
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:03,900
"Well, what man doesn't say
he wants his space?"

941
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,100
The difference is, now...

942
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,800
...we have a family.

943
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,200
A beautiful family.

944
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,400
And I see how the girls look at you.

945
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,900
They adore you.

946
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:27,300
They love their daddy
who wants to go into space.

947
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,200
I don't wanna be responsible
for killing that hope in their eyes.

948
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,900
And what kind of message
would you be sending to Shepard?

949
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,200
I want his dad to show him
how it's done.

950
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,600
Now, look.

951
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:59,900
There's enough money in there
for you to do whatever you need to do.

952
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,500
Without the rocket...

953
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:10,300
...we're just a dysfunctional family.

954
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,800
We'll rebuild the rocket
to the exact specifications as the original.

955
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,000
I've inventoried all materials on hand.
Awaiting delivery on...

956
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,200
Three spherical oxygen bottles.

957
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,700
- Three thousand linear feet of 20-gauge...
- Unlike the first launch...

958
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,400
...this fuel will burn evenly...

959
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,300
...giving us the right amount of thrust
needed to launch...

960
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,700
- Twenty MCM submodule components.
- Lithium hydroxide canisters...

961
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
- There are plenty of alternative fuels.
- We have to find them legitimately.

962
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,400
The altitude would be 100 miles
and the speed would be 25,000...

963
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,100
Fire-protective fabric.

964
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,800
- Test.
- Testing.

965
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,000
The rocket will be launched from the barn,
heading 72.51 degrees...

966
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,500
Five thousand linear feet 30-gauge...

967
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,400
Two hundred linear feet...

968
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Oxygen could last
three times longer than needed...

969
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,300
...but let's not put that to the test.

970
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,000
You know, when you're a kid,
you wanna be just like your dad.

971
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,600
Then when you're a teenager...

972
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,300
...you don't wanna have
anything to do with him.

973
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,100
Then when you grow up,
you end up just like him.

974
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,600
My dad showed me one thing
when he died.

975
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
He wasn't dying, he was giving up.

976
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
No matter what happens to me today,
my children will see that I didn't give up.

977
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,800
And I can die knowing that.

978
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,200
Yeah.

979
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,100
Man.

980
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,100
We have been out here way too long.

981
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,600
Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay.

982
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,500
- What?
- Headquarters. Rocket Man's buying fuel.

983
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,200
Suspect Charles Farmer. Male Caucasian.

984
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,000
Approximately 5'10", 170 pounds.

985
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Last seen in a brown Ford pickup
bearing east on Route 9.

986
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,400
Now, this launch is gonna take
all the strength...

987
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,400
...and all the focus this family has.

988
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:04,100
You're my crew, my teammates.

989
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,500
Well, thank you, honey.
I can use these, you know.

990
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,500
- Is Daddy gonna come back?
- Yeah, I'm coming back.

991
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,600
Don't you worry.

992
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:22,000
- I love you, honey.
- I love you too.

993
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:31,000
It'll be okay. Don't you worry.

994
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,000
I love you guys.

995
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,200
Now, Shepard.

996
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,100
If anything's gonna go wrong,
it'll go wrong in the first 10 minutes.

997
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,400
- After that, I'll be airborne.
- Dad--

998
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,400
It's okay. I'm not worried about you.

999
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,500
- You can do it.
- All right.

1000
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,400
Audie...

1001
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,000
...it's gonna be okay.

1002
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,200
Please don't break my heart.

1003
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,700
I won't.

1004
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,100
Step away from the vehicle!
Show me your hands!

1005
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,000
Put your hands up! Let me see them!

1006
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,000
- Right there, right there.
- Let me see those hands.

1007
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,100
Turn around slowly.

1008
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,900
I expect you home for dinner.

1009
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,600
Dad, do you copy?

1010
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
Now we look like asses.

1011
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,400
Control Booth.

1012
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,800
Preparation for launch underway.
Local temperature, 65 degrees.

1013
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,000
Wind speed, four knots.
Opening canopy doors.

1014
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,500
Cabin pressure holding 5.8.

1015
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,100
Fuel and oxygen are steady.
Power still looks good.

1016
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,900
Status is good.

1017
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,900
Canopy doors cleared for launch.

1018
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:28,000
All remaining units
report to the Farmer residence.

1019
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,100
- Ready for system check.
- Roger.

1020
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,100
Hydraulics okay. Fuel pressure's okay.
All systems go.

1021
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,600
- Roger.
- Vessel restraints unlocked.

1022
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,100
Ignition system on.

1023
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:44,600
Abort system on standby.
Cleared for launch at zero hour, 9 a.m.

1024
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,100
Roger.

1025
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:49,800
Ten...

1026
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,900
...nine...

1027
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,800
...eight...

1028
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,400
...seven, six...

1029
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,800
...five, four...

1030
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,700
...three...

1031
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,700
...two, one.

1032
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,500
It's okay. It's okay.

1033
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,100
Fuel is go.

1034
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,800
- Go, Dad, go!
- Go, Dad!

1035
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,600
That is so huge.

1036
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,100
Charlie Farmer.

1037
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,900
Oxygen in the cabin is good.

1038
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:25,300
Pressure's holding.
The isolated battery's okay.

1039
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,300
Everything's okay. Son of a bitch.

1040
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,900
It's getting a little smoother.
A little smoother.

1041
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,800
Cut off, tower. Jettison green. Disarm.

1042
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,200
Charles Farmer launched!

1043
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,800
No, he didn't.

1044
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:49,100
Capsule separation, green, okay.

1045
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,600
We did it, Shepard!

1046
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,400
We did it!

1047
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,700
We made it, Mom.

1048
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,600
This is where the dreams live.

1049
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,800
I'm up here.

1050
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,100
Africa.

1051
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,900
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.

1052
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,600
God, I wish you were with me.

1053
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,100
I wish you guys were here so bad.

1054
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:18,200
Have you heard about this guy,
Charlie Farmer, who built his own rocket?

1055
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,600
Shepard.

1056
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,300
Shepard, can you hear me?

1057
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,600
Shepard.

1058
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:38,100
- Shepard?
- Dad.

1059
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,500
Shepard.

1060
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,700
Shepard, can you hear me?

1061
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,800
Come on.

1062
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,100
- Where is he?
- Dad, please come in.

1063
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,200
- Dad, are you there? Dad?
- It's okay.

1064
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,700
Control Booth to Dreamer.
Control Booth to Dreamer. Are you there?

1065
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,200
It's okay.

1066
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,500
As you no doubt have heard,
there have been unsubstantiated rumors...

1067
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,100
...of an alleged launch
from somewhere in Texas.

1068
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,700
And for whatever reason, this seems to be
attributed to our old friend Mr. Farmer.

1069
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:02,300
We here at the FAA categorically deny
the existence of any launch.

1070
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:05,500
As far as we know,
Mr. Farmer is resting comfortably...

1071
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,300
...probably watching
this press conference on television.

1072
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:12,200
Once again, no launch has taken place.

1073
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,800
Your daddy's gonna come home soon.

1074
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:20,300
So Dad launched at 0922.

1075
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:26,600
So right now he's been in orbit
for eight hours, 56 minutes and 15 seconds.

1076
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:31,400
Distance traveled so far
is 152,042 miles.

1077
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,400
Well, when will he come back?

1078
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:37,300
He may do 12 or 13 orbits
before he re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.

1079
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,300
And if you figure that, then it...

1080
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,300
What?

1081
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,000
Well, he could end up
running out of oxygen.

1082
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,900
I still can't locate him, Mom.

1083
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,800
Why don't you get some rest?

1084
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,700
- I can't, Mom. Dad needs me.
- That's an order.

1085
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,600
I'm proud of you.

1086
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,700
Say something, Farmer.

1087
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,500
Shepard.

1088
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,500
Come in, Shepard.

1089
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,700
Shepard.

1090
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,500
Shepard! Can you hear me?

1091
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,600
Shepard!

1092
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,200
Come on.

1093
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,200
Come on.

1094
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:40,600
Hello? Hello?

1095
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,700
This is the Astronaut Farmer.

1096
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,500
- Come in, Mission Control.
- Dad, it's Shep!

1097
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,500
Daddy! Daddy!

1098
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,900
I think I'm gonna miss the back yard.

1099
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:57,900
Don't worry. I'm setting up coordinates
for orbit nine to 10.

1100
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,800
You don't wanna miss
this window for re-entry.

1101
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,200
If readings are correct,
you're off by 20 percent.

1102
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,200
- Preparing for re-entry.
- Re-entry is go.

1103
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,100
Good luck.
We'll be watching for you, Dad.

1104
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,900
Where can we take you?

1105
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,200
Home.

1106
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,800
- Hey, Dad.
- I made it! I made it!

1107
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:49,300
Good job, son.

1108
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,600
- I love you.
- My helmet.

1109
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,300
I want that.

1110
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,300
- And I want the rocket.
- I want that.

1111
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,300
Let's go to a restaurant to have pizza.

1112
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,000
Okay. We could go there too.

1113
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:40,000
My next guest has an amazing story.

1114
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
He's the only private citizen
ever to build his own rocket...

1115
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,600
...orbit the Earth, and return safely.

1116
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,800
As you know, he orbited nine times.

1117
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:50,400
Please welcome Charlie Farmer.
Charlie, come on out here.

1118
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,600
How are you, pal? Good to see you.

1119
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,200
Have a seat.

1120
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,600
Let me ask you something.

1121
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,800
How does this go over
with the wife and kids?

1122
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,400
Most guys I know can't
get a Harley out of the wife.

1123
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,600
You know what I'm saying?
How do you get the rocket?

1124
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,400
I know it might sound like baloney...

1125
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,400
...but my wife and kids were real supportive
of the whole thing all the way around.

1126
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,100
How do you know you were
physically up to this? It's been a while--

1127
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,600
I did some tests on myself.

1128
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,400
I know they have that big--
What is that? The cyclotron?

1129
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,400
What do you do, run around a tree
with a rope? What do you do?

1130
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,900
See what I'm saying?

1131
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,400
I didn't really have the equipment
that NASA might require.

1132
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,600
So I just had to make up
my own tests, but...

1133
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,600
You think they will clamp down on people?
Will people be allowed to do this after you?

1134
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,600
You know, I was fine
when I was building the rocket.

1135
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:53,400
It's when I ordered the 10,000 pounds
of rocket fuel...

1136
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,200
- ...that the FBI--
- Well, yeah, that'd do it.

1137
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,600
- The FBI came around to say hello to me.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1138
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,000
I know all the government people,
the NASA people, were against you.

1139
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,200
Once this looked like
it was gonna happen...

1140
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,700
...were they pulling for you
or feeling resistance?

1141
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:09,300
Well, I'll put it this way.

1142
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:13,300
To be up there
and look back down here at us...

1143
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,900
- ...it makes it all worth it.
- Well, you did it.

1144
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:17,700
Godspeed to you, Charlie. Great job.

1145
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,800
Charlie Farmer will be right back,
right after this.
