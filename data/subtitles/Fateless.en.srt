1
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:06,364
Carrot soup.

2
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:10,567
I like it best too.

3
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:14,304
Quite thick.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,549
Look! A whole chunk of meat!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,074
Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

6
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:54,310
This is when the street-lights
of Budapest come on.

7
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:57,548
Remember
the Schmoll shoe-polish ad?

8
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:00,556
Schmoll... what?

9
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:05,354
A lit-up plane circled over
the Oktogon every evening.

10
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,127
It's gone long ago,
cos of the black-out.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,692
You always say silly things.

12
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:16,968
The black-out will end soon.

13
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:23,742
This is when girls
set out on their dates.

14
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:27,579
High-heels tapping.

15
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:38,288
I'll walk down
Nefelejcs Street again...

16
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:40,830
Nefelejcs Street...

17
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:47,394
Not a great goal, but who cares?
It's a goal.

18
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,407
A street, or a woman,

19
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:56,038
a library...
long winter afternoons...

20
00:01:56,114 --> 00:02:00,107
before we light the lamps.

21
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:07,550
Things I can't imagine any more...

22
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:12,753
- It's Friday.
- Which Friday? What's the date?

23
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:24,168
They bear the eternal Jewish fate.

24
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:30,203
Nothing makes any difference to them:
they're here on Earth temporarily.

25
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:35,275
But they persevere
because they've got an aim.

26
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:40,285
Everyone needs some
life-giving obsession.

27
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:45,261
Something to keep their hope alive.

28
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:48,764
But I've got nothing.
No goals.

29
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:53,866
Oh yes I have...

30
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:59,375
Yes, I have.
I've got to take my sons home.

31
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:16,206
Soup for sale.

32
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,975
How much?

33
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:22,713
Whole tin carrot soup.

34
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:26,348
I bet someone's in hiding again.

35
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,924
Or dead.

36
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:32,429
Or they're asleep somewhere,
and we've been here since dawn.

37
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,691
What's the price?

38
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:43,432
Just hold out a bit longer, son.

39
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:47,944
It'll soon be over.

40
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:56,376
- Half ration bread and the margarine.
- What's that?

41
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,079
Soup for sale.

42
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:03,024
We go to the latrines enough
without your soup!

43
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:07,120
Did you buy some?

44
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:08,301
It'll get soaked and be worse
than nothing - like a wet sponge.

45
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:10,277
It keeps me warm.

46
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:12,838
We should get our bread
before parade.

47
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:18,355
- One third ration today.
- Get it for the three of us.

48
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:26,059
Pretty Boy.

49
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,434
Pretty Boy.

50
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:26,479
For sale.

51
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:31,290
Potatoes from last night.
I give salt.

52
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:34,763
- How much?
- Evening soup.

53
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:36,459
You don't eat soup.

54
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,468
Today matzo soup.
We can eat that.

55
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,836
- No one knows what we get.
- I know.

56
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:46,102
Half portion soup.

57
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,440
And the margarine.

58
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:52,243
You jerk! I'm a Jew just like you.

59
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:56,412
Di bist ka jid,
di bist a shégets. You no Jew.

60
00:10:56,487 --> 00:11:00,321
- Then why am I here?
- How I know that?

61
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:02,916
Give it here!

62
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:07,495
- Bloody Jew!
- Makes it no cheaper.

63
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:10,328
Give it to me!

64
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:43,831
- What d'you want? Piss off!
- It's my price.

65
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:49,065
Did you buy from him?
Did you buy something?

66
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:13,241
Come on, get in line!

67
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:21,377
We'll be here till dawn.

68
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:25,114
Three Riga Jews.
Should be success.

69
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:29,454
Perfect speak German.
Map, everything.

70
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:32,154
The Almighty not want it.

71
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:35,255
At least someone tried.

72
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:37,697
Have you lost your mind?

73
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:40,634
Any idea what's happening
around you?

74
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:43,468
Yes. No supper tonight.

75
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:42,951
Where're you going?
How long since you washed?

76
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:47,319
You've let yourself go completely.
You've got lice, you're scabby.

77
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,723
Who asked you to boss me around?
Fuck off, you git!

78
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:53,354
D'you want to die here?
Don't you want to go home?

79
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,421
- I'm cold.
- I asked something!

80
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,022
- I'm cold.
- Listen.

81
00:18:57,134 --> 00:19:01,537
Listen to me. I asked whether
you want to go home.

82
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:05,632
- Home, understand? Home!
- I'm cold.

83
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:16,910
You crazy?
They'll beat your brains in.

84
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:19,447
- Don't be daft.
- You bring trouble!

85
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,289
Disperse!

86
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:41,364
- Get up! Supper soon.
- We can't leave him here.

87
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:43,599
- Why don't you get up?
- I can't.

88
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:45,664
- Of course you can!
- It hurts!

89
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:48,869
- What hurts?
- My knee.

90
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,352
Come, let's fold our hands.

91
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:23,011
Put him down there.

92
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,247
Supper!

93
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,720
Supper!

94
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:10,653
Next.

95
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:16,087
Come on, come on!
Let it go!

96
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,993
Let it go, understand?

97
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:23,327
Come on. You'll get it back.

98
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,119
I have to open it up and clean it.

99
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,286
It'll hurt.
But I promise to be quick.

100
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:57,762
Are you hungry?

101
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:02,969
Terribly.

102
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,436
I protest!
I've a right to a separate bed.

103
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:13,607
- Ask the doctor!
- We're full of patients.

104
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:16,117
- Move over!
- I protest!

105
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:17,948
I protest!

106
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:20,352
Can't you give us another rug?

107
00:24:20,457 --> 00:24:23,449
I protest!
It's my right!

108
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:27,462
Lie on your side,
it gives us more room.

109
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,226
Don't you understand?

110
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,404
Got any water?

111
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:40,910
Water? I could do with some too.

112
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,446
- Cigarettes?
- None.

113
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:03,958
Coffee! Coffee!

114
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,209
Can't you see he's asleep?
Give me his tin.

115
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:47,969
Soup!

116
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:55,840
He can't have slept for two days!

117
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,917
He is dead.

118
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:16,558
I'll go and get someone.

119
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:27,072
Thank you.

120
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,398
I protest!

121
00:29:35,004 --> 00:29:36,665
I protest!

122
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:39,902
I pro-test!

123
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:42,966
Carrot soup.

124
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,701
Carrot soup.

125
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:06,335
György Köves.

126
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,614
György Köves.

127
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:06,626
Do you speak Hungarian?

128
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:21,841
Yes, I do.

129
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,140
Where're you from?

130
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,086
Budapest.

131
00:36:35,124 --> 00:36:36,751
When did you arrive?

132
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:44,531
In November.

133
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:51,069
Do we get food here?

134
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:39,412
Thank you.

135
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,208
Come on, come on!

136
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:23,140
Buck up! Come on!

137
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:30,444
Stop!

138
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:32,782
Fresh air will make you feel better.

139
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:34,186
Back home we'll build
a new country.

140
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:37,282
Come on, line up in threes.

141
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:40,156
Start marching!
One, two, three four...

142
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:43,823
Standing on guard
on the walls of Madrid

143
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:47,198
Facing the gunshots
come what may

144
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:50,703
Standing on guard
for the dreams of its people

145
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:53,332
Ready to withstand
the wildest siege

146
00:41:53,408 --> 00:41:55,933
Once more.
One, two, three, four...

147
00:41:56,011 --> 00:41:59,242
Standing on guard
on the walls of Madrid...

148
00:43:18,627 --> 00:43:20,959
Come on!

149
00:43:21,063 --> 00:43:24,123
Hold out a bit longer!

150
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:30,968
From tomorrow we've been
promised some sort of transport.

151
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,903
This school has been assigned
to us for the night.

152
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:39,038
Tomorrow we'll reach Dresden.

153
00:43:39,147 --> 00:43:41,638
From there we can get a train
to Bratislava.

154
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,619
We'll see how we go from there
to Budapest. Come on! Inside!

155
00:43:52,227 --> 00:43:58,496
Your shirt, you wretch!
Why don't you take off your shirt?

156
00:43:59,735 --> 00:44:03,193
He never takes off his shirt!

157
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:06,638
Take off your shirt, you jerk!

158
00:44:06,742 --> 00:44:10,439
- I didn't do anything!
- He's got the SS mark.

159
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:13,139
D'you hear? Here's the mark!

160
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:16,810
What's going on?
What's all this shouting?

161
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:19,285
I noticed
he never took off his shirt.

162
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:21,515
Here's the SS tattoo under his arm.

163
00:44:21,623 --> 00:44:23,488
It was guard duty...

164
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:26,083
That's enough, stop!

165
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:29,062
I didn't do anything,
I just want to go home.

166
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:32,794
You wormed your way among us
to avoid being taken prisoner?

167
00:44:32,901 --> 00:44:36,803
- I didn't hurt anyone.
- Did you join the SS in Hungary?

168
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:40,739
I only did guard duty.
I swear I didn't hurt anyone!

169
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:42,174
Anyone know him?

170
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:45,179
No one. He could've been in one
of the smaller camp like Ohrdruf.

171
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:46,942
Hardly anyone was left alive in there.

172
00:44:47,015 --> 00:44:50,109
I saw my brother shot dead
by a shit like this!

173
00:44:50,218 --> 00:44:55,019
Enough! No lynching here.

174
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:58,287
Four of you will take him
to the Soviet command.

175
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,885
They'll get the truth out of him.

176
00:45:00,962 --> 00:45:05,729
Tie him up, so he doesn't get away!
You, you, you and you!

177
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:07,996
My leg hurts.

178
00:45:08,103 --> 00:45:10,936
Yes, of course... Then you.

179
00:45:11,006 --> 00:45:14,533
No, not that...

180
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:22,474
Dresden.

181
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:25,052
I came here once.

182
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,521
You can't imagine
what a town this was.

183
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:33,822
One of Germany's finest
and richest cities.

184
00:45:33,895 --> 00:45:37,262
They asked for it,
the Herrenvolk.

185
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:40,165
Now they're groveling.

186
00:45:40,268 --> 00:45:41,860
That's what they wanted.

187
00:45:41,937 --> 00:45:46,271
That's what they got.
They deserve it.

188
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:52,905
I feel now for the first time
the meaning of the word victory.

189
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,415
Are you sorry for them?

190
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:58,817
They weren't sorry for you
when they shoved you in the camp.

191
00:45:58,887 --> 00:46:00,912
- Am I right?
- Yes.

192
00:46:01,022 --> 00:46:05,618
There you are. You're free.
You're alive.

193
00:46:05,694 --> 00:46:11,189
Try to be happy with life -
and victory.

194
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,969
Have you seen him?

195
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:25,137
Have you seen my husband? Sure?

196
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:26,976
Sorry, no.

197
00:46:27,048 --> 00:46:31,144
A 43-year-old man.
With black curly hair.

198
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:33,414
Always smiling.

199
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:35,888
Sorry, I haven't seen him.

200
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:37,925
- And you?
- Sorry.

201
00:46:38,026 --> 00:46:41,518
I'd like to ask you
something else if I may.

202
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,691
- Yes?
- Did you see the gas chambers?

203
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:48,201
We wouldn't be speaking now if I had.

204
00:46:48,303 --> 00:46:51,170
Did they really exist?

205
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:54,902
It depends.
They definitely did in Auschwitz.

206
00:46:54,976 --> 00:46:57,069
But I've come from Buchenwald.

207
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:59,044
- From where?
- Buchenwald.

208
00:46:59,147 --> 00:47:01,581
- From Buchenwald.
- Yes.

209
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,381
So you heard about
the gas chambers,

210
00:47:06,822 --> 00:47:10,849
but you didn't see them
with your own eyes, right?

211
00:47:10,926 --> 00:47:12,689
Right.

212
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:17,323
Thank you,
that's all I wanted to know.

213
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:03,639
Come on! Come closer!
Quickly!

214
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:13,586
We'll gather here! Get off the
train, come on! Gather round me!

215
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,787
Looking for someone?

216
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:21,082
Yes.

217
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:24,920
- Who?
- Bandi Citrom.

218
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:30,298
He's not at home.

219
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:34,699
Not home at the moment or...

220
00:49:38,373 --> 00:49:41,240
Not at all.

221
00:49:41,343 --> 00:49:45,245
- Who's that?
- Where are you?

222
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:52,579
I was looking for Bandi Citrom.

223
00:49:52,654 --> 00:49:56,249
He's not at home.

224
00:49:56,324 --> 00:50:00,283
Come back later.

225
00:50:00,362 --> 00:50:04,856
In a few days.
Maybe.

226
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:18,306
Wait!
Wait!

227
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:28,889
Tickets, please!

228
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:34,095
- Ticket!
- I haven't got one.

229
00:50:34,162 --> 00:50:38,462
- Then get one.
- I haven't any money.

230
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:43,971
- You can't travel without a ticket!
- My leg hurts.

231
00:50:44,072 --> 00:50:51,638
- I'm sorry, I didn't make the law.
- Enough of that, give me a ticket!

232
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:54,579
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me!

233
00:50:54,649 --> 00:50:58,676
Some people
should be ashamed of themselves!

234
00:50:59,888 --> 00:51:02,322
Come from Germany, my boy?

235
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:04,255
Yes.

236
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:08,856
- Concentration camp?
- Naturally.

237
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:12,525
- Which one?
- Buchenwald.

238
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,731
I've heard of it.
Another one of hell's circles...

239
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:22,539
- Where did they drag you off from?
- Budapest.

240
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:26,444
You must have suffered
many dreadful things.

241
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:29,847
Depends what you call dreadful.

242
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:34,115
I'm sure you were starved
and maybe beaten too...

243
00:51:34,222 --> 00:51:37,953
- Naturally. - Why do you
keep saying "naturally,"

244
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:39,890
when it's not the slightest
bit natural?

245
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:44,660
- It is in concentration camp.
- That's true, but...

246
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:50,193
a concentration camp itself
is not natural.

247
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:58,837
The main thing is it's over,
you survived!

248
00:51:58,947 --> 00:52:03,475
What do you feel now
you're home again...

249
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:08,079
in the town that you left behind?

250
00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:10,885
Hatred.

251
00:53:10,151 --> 00:53:11,812
We've got nothing.

252
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:13,478
What d'you want?

253
00:53:13,588 --> 00:53:15,988
- Excuse me, but I live here.
- You?

254
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:21,461
You must have mistaken
the number! This is our flat!

255
00:54:13,881 --> 00:54:16,907
Gyurka!
Gyurka!

256
00:54:17,018 --> 00:54:20,044
- Come in, my boy!
- Look at that!

257
00:54:20,121 --> 00:54:23,818
I rang the bell,
but someone else came to the door.

258
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:25,756
What's happened?

259
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,658
- Come on in!
- Come in.

260
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:33,167
- He's back!
- When? Tell us about it!

261
00:54:33,268 --> 00:54:36,169
Come in quickly, son!

262
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:41,174
- When did you arrive?
- Let's see you!

263
00:54:41,242 --> 00:54:46,544
I rang and someone else
came to the door.

264
00:54:46,614 --> 00:54:49,174
Aren't you hungry?

265
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:53,983
You used to love bread and dripping
with onion rings...

266
00:54:54,055 --> 00:54:57,547
Sit down, over there.

267
00:54:57,659 --> 00:54:59,820
That's it.

268
00:55:14,642 --> 00:55:17,338
My father?

269
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,542
Is he dead?

270
00:55:21,616 --> 00:55:23,811
He didn't suffer long...

271
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:27,685
His friends brought the news
from a German camp...

272
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:31,122
But it's in Austrian territory.

273
00:55:31,225 --> 00:55:35,958
- What was it called?
- Damn...

274
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:41,397
- Mauthausen.
- Mauthausen! That's it!

275
00:55:41,502 --> 00:55:43,834
Mauthausen.

276
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:48,134
D'you know anything
about my mother?

277
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:51,042
Of course. She's well.

278
00:55:51,145 --> 00:55:54,046
She survived.
She's fine.

279
00:55:54,148 --> 00:55:59,415
She came by a week
looking for you.

280
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,320
And my stepmother?

281
00:56:02,423 --> 00:56:08,225
Well, she got married...
But who to?

282
00:56:08,296 --> 00:56:13,131
- Somebody Kovács I think.
- Not Kovács, more like Futó...

283
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:14,964
- Come off it!
- Futó!

284
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:15,831
Sütő.

285
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:18,371
- Sütő!
- That's it. Of course!

286
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,634
She's got a lot to thank him for.

287
00:56:22,744 --> 00:56:25,076
He saved the family assets.

288
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:27,841
He even hid her in the hard times.

289
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:31,715
- Maybe it was a bit hurried.
- Maybe...

290
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:34,652
Understandable, though.

291
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:40,085
Eat up, my boy.

292
00:56:42,363 --> 00:56:45,264
Do you remember
when I sat here last?

293
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:50,532
You debated whether I should
take the bus or train to Auschwitz.

294
00:56:50,605 --> 00:56:56,134
How could we know that your road
would lead to the hell of the camps.

295
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:58,405
The camps aren't hell.

296
00:56:58,479 --> 00:57:02,142
What are they then?
I can only imagine them as hell.

297
00:57:02,216 --> 00:57:07,381
- I can't imagine hell.
- I can't see what's the difference?

298
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:15,294
- Hell doesn't exist, but the camps do.
- Did. Luckily it's all over.

299
00:57:15,363 --> 00:57:17,263
You're home again.

300
00:57:17,331 --> 00:57:20,789
You should be
thinking about your future.

301
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:24,235
- My future?
- First and foremost.

302
00:57:24,338 --> 00:57:25,737
Why?

303
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:29,766
- So that we can live.
- Live in freedom.

304
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:33,610
We can't start a new life
with that burden.

305
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:38,846
What about my old life?
That's mine too.

306
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,254
It's over. We were assigned
a different fate then.

307
00:57:43,324 --> 00:57:45,952
But I accepted that fate.

308
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,518
- We all accepted it.
- We had no choice.

309
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:54,033
- But now we're free.
- We always were!

310
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:57,997
There was always enough time.

311
00:57:58,105 --> 00:58:01,165
We waited a whole day
in the customs house.

312
00:58:01,242 --> 00:58:04,905
In Auschwitz we waited
at least half an hour.

313
00:58:05,012 --> 00:58:09,813
Things could always have turned out
differently from what they did -

314
00:58:09,884 --> 00:58:15,686
in Auschwitz just as at home
when we bid my father farewell.

315
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:24,798
- But what else could we have done?
- I think you're tired.

316
00:58:24,899 --> 00:58:27,459
You've had a long journey.

317
00:58:27,535 --> 00:58:29,162
A very long one.

318
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:33,400
Your mother's waiting.
How happy she'll be!

319
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:37,205
Hurry home!
Make her happy!

320
00:58:37,311 --> 00:58:40,974
- Come, Gyurka.
- Off you go!

321
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,860
Gyurka!

322
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,492
What do you look like?

323
00:59:08,442 --> 00:59:11,536
Was it very dreadful?

324
00:59:16,384 --> 00:59:20,047
Did you learn what it means
to be "a Jew"?

325
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:24,251
It doesn't matter any more.
It's over.

326
00:59:24,325 --> 00:59:28,261
- Remember how you cried?
- Did I?

327
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:33,995
I tried to comfort you, but I had no
right because I was a Jew too.

328
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:36,797
Why, what are you now?

329
00:59:36,904 --> 00:59:42,638
I don't know.
Maybe I don't even exist.

330
00:59:42,743 --> 00:59:47,703
You're so strange.
You've changed.

331
00:59:52,253 --> 00:59:57,589
- I died once.
- What do you mean?

332
01:00:00,227 --> 01:00:05,631
I can't be angry any more.

333
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:27,281
To gather strength I stopped
for a minute in the square.

334
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:29,515
It was that certain hour

335
01:00:29,624 --> 01:00:32,787
- even now,
even here I recognized it -

336
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:35,420
my favorite hour in the camp.

337
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:40,456
And I was filled with a sharp,
painful and helpless feeling:

338
01:00:40,534 --> 01:00:43,264
I felt homesick...

339
01:00:43,337 --> 01:00:47,706
Yes, in a certain sense life
there was cleaner and simpler.

340
01:00:47,775 --> 01:00:50,972
Those who had saved me
came back to me.

341
01:00:51,045 --> 01:00:55,209
For the first time I thought
of them with mild resentment,

342
01:00:55,282 --> 01:00:58,445
a kind of affectionate grudge.

343
01:00:58,519 --> 01:01:00,146
But let's not exaggerate.

344
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:04,282
I accept every argument for
the price of being able to live.

345
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:07,418
I looked around in that gentle,
dusky square,

346
01:01:07,495 --> 01:01:11,090
at that storm-tossed street which
nonetheless held so much promise,

347
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:14,532
I felt the readiness
gather within me:

348
01:01:14,602 --> 01:01:18,038
I would continue this uncontinuable
life of mine.

349
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:20,164
I remembered my mother had plans

350
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:23,039
for me to become an engineer,
or a doctor.

351
01:01:23,144 --> 01:01:24,634
And that's what'll happen:

352
01:01:24,745 --> 01:01:28,841
there's nothing
too unimaginable to endure.

353
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:30,576
And in my own way I already know that,

354
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:34,485
lying in wait for me
like some unavoidable trap,

355
01:01:34,588 --> 01:01:36,112
is happiness.

356
01:01:36,223 --> 01:01:39,852
Even beside the chimneys in the
pause between torments

357
01:01:39,927 --> 01:01:43,192
there was something
similar to happiness.

358
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:46,164
People only ask about the horrors,

359
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:52,001
whereas I should talk about the
happiness of the camps next time,

360
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:53,630
if they ask.

361
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:59,145
If they ask at all.
And if I don't forget myself.

362
01:02:00,305 --> 01:02:06,791
