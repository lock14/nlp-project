1
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,904
The record exploded into
something they had never seen...

2
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,832
which liberated
the yellow horrific violence

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,308
In Burma, the hard line military regime

4
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,470
causes increasing
international concern.

5
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,993
The regime crushes all dissent...

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,265
as many as 10,000 were killed
throughout the country during 19...

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,384
in an actual uprising.
Thousands were killed by the Junta.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,387
Some form of chemical weapon
has been used in Burma by military...

9
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:05,888
Thousands took to the streets
and thousands are already...

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,645
Many peaceful monks has been killed,
some by rifle and others drowned...

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,071
foreign journalist
have been shot and killed...

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,028
thousands of villages have been destroyed.
Rape and torture are a daily occurrence.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,588
In Burma, there are more land mines
than anywhere in the world

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,704
young men are beaten and forced
into the army,

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,463
many as young as 12 years old.

16
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:24,964
Be-headings and mutilations
are commonplace...

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,127
The Karen people, comprised
mostly of poor Christian farmers,

18
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:29,792
have been singled
out for extermination.

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,552
The military government wants the

20
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:33,782
abundant  natural
resources on Karen land.

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,826
The Burmese military
campaign against the Karen people

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,149
has been going on for almost 60 years...

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,152
the longest running
civil war in the world.

24
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,024
Number 1 in Thailand.

25
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,670
They are Siamese Cobra
or common cobra.

26
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,749
It is not King Cobra and not just plain cobra.

27
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,832
Fuck off, okay?

28
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,395
Be careful you my friend.

29
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,873
Looks like dangerous work.

30
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,751
I'm Michael Burnett,
do you have some time to talk?

31
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,546
It won't take long, I promise.

32
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,227
I was told it might be possible to
rent your boat, we'd like to do that.

33
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:02,031
Is that possible?

34
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,587
We need to get upriver.

35
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,589
Where you goin'?

36
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,545
Into Burma.

37
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,982
Burma's a war zone.

38
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,707
Well, that's what people call it...

39
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,348
but it's more like genocide than war.

40
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,624
Anyway, this will be my 5th trip in

41
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,790
so, we are aware of all the risks.

42
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,189
I don't go that far north.

43
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,952
Let me explain our situation.

44
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,144
Our church is part of
the Pan-Asian Ministry...

45
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,832
located in Colorado.

46
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,786
We're all volunteers
who around this time of year...

47
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,110
bring in medical supplies,
medical attention

48
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,988
prayer books, and
support for the Karen tribes people.

49
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,662
People say you know
the river better than anyone.

50
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,465
They lied.

51
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,825
Look, what I'm asking is that
we compensate you for

52
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,833
a few hours of your time
that will help change peoples' lives.

53
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,911
Are you bringin' any weapons?

54
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,069
Of course not.

55
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,265
You're not changin' anything.

56
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,147
Well.

57
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,391
It's thinking like that
that keeps the world the way it is.

58
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,515
Fuck the world.

59
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,045
Let's go.
- Why?

60
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,112
He's not interested.
Let's go.

61
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,382
Let me try.

62
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,707
Sarah.

63
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,824
You said it was the only way there.

64
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,228
- I know.
- Then what do we have to lose?

65
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,708
Just let me try, please.

66
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,190
Hello?

67
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,305
I'm Sarah Miller.

68
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,108
I hope you don't mind
me coming back here.

69
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,382
The man that you were talking to...

70
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,552
I wasn't talkin' to anybody.

71
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,302
All right, the man
that was talking to you

72
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,824
asked if we could hire
you to take us up the river.

73
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,864
You said no.

74
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,790
Why?

75
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,145
Can't help you out.

76
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,553
Well, if you have good reasons,
would you mind if I heard them?

77
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,118
Go home.

78
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,505
Why'd you come back?

79
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,748
Waiting for you.

80
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,190
I told you before, I can't help you.

81
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,623
We need to go and help these people.

82
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,153
We're here to make a difference.

83
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,503
We believe all lives are special.

84
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,862
Some lives, some no.

85
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,906
Really? If everyone thought like you,
nothing would change.

86
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,705
Nothing does change.

87
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,143
Of course it does,
nothing stays the same.

88
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,832
Live your life,
it's a good one.

89
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,307
That's what I'm trying to do.

90
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,424
No, what you're trying to
do is change what is.

91
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,512
And what is?

92
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,236
Go home.

93
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,358
Really, go home.

94
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,828
Maybe, maybe you've
lost your faith in people.

95
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,035
But you must still be
faithful to something.

96
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,589
You must still care about something.

97
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,624
Maybe we can't change what is.

98
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,350
But trying to save a life
isn't wasting your life, is it?

99
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,025
As bad as these people are
they will eventually lose.

100
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,464
They can't keep it up
against a united front, they can't.

101
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,940
I mean time alone will tell,

102
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:30,224
but in the meantime we just have
to help them hold it together.

103
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,265
Just the other day, I read...

104
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,430
Excuse me, Sarah.

105
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,748
Where are you going?

106
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,182
To talk to him.

107
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,543
He probably wants his privacy.

108
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,903
You shouldn't ignore him.
He's helping us.

109
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,308
He's being paid.

110
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,799
He didn't take anything.

111
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,108
Thank you, again, for doing this,
really, from all of us.

112
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,987
You know,
you never told us your name.

113
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,911
John.

114
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,865
Where are you from?

115
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,950
Bowie, Arizona.

116
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,507
Why'd you leave?

117
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,351
I got drafted in 'Nam.

118
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,067
And you just stayed?

119
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,628
It's complicated.

120
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,631
Do you have family back home?

121
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,508
Father maybe, I don't know.

122
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,913
Aren't you curious to see how
things might have changed back home?

123
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,592
Don't have a reason for that.

124
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,790
Sarah.

125
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,633
Are you sure
you want to go upriver?

126
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,703
Any time you want to turn around,
I'll stop.

127
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,596
Okay.

128
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,706
What is it? Who are they?

129
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,312
Burmese pirates.

130
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,117
Tell everyone to stay down.
Don't make a sound.

131
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,871
- It's all right.
- Don't talk!

132
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,743
Are there more of them?

133
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,467
Maybe.
What do you want to do?

134
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,710
We should keep going.
We made a commitment.

135
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,392
I ain't talkin' to you.

136
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,549
What do you wanna do?

137
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,869
We're a group here.
if they want to vote...

138
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,510
Sit down.

139
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,510
If it's money they want...

140
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,037
Nobody talks. Heads down.

141
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,918
Keep your heads down, don't look 'em
in the eye or they'll kill you.

142
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,519
Don't look!

143
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,916
No!

144
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,710
What did you do?

145
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,785
We came to help stop the killing!

146
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,347
Who are you to take...

147
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,110
Who are you?

148
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,030
Let him go!

149
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,190
They would've raped her 50 times...

150
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,509
and cut your fuckin' heads off.

151
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,067
Who are you?

152
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,559
Who are any of you?

153
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,872
We're goin' back!

154
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,030
No.

155
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,192
No, we shouldn't go back.

156
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,623
Let go.

157
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,629
What are you doing?

158
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,824
We are so close!

159
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,991
What happened here... is horrible.

160
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,185
But the people there
are killed like this everyday.

161
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,545
Michael.
This was your idea.

162
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,790
We made a commitment.

163
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,542
I know you don't believe
in what we're doing.

164
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,346
But it's our life.

165
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,429
Our choice.

166
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,231
You're not gonna change anything.

167
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,749
Please.

168
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,269
Please, John. Please.

169
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,799
Go sit down.

170
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,103
We'll be taking the overland route
on the way back

171
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,271
so there's no need to wait around.

172
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,464
I have to report this.

173
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,983
I know you think what
you did was right, but taking a life

174
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,069
is never right.

175
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,198
I don't know what to say.

176
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,911
Maybe you shouldn't say
anything, should you?

177
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,710
Good luck.

178
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,035
Open

179
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,071
With power, through his spirit,
in your inner being...

180
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,349
So Christ may dwell
in your hearts with faith.

181
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,229
And I pray...

182
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,800
You may have power
together with all of us.

183
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,993
Well, let me see if
I can fix this little problem, okay?

184
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,630
Hey you.

185
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,511
Hand me one of those bandages?

186
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,396
Okay.

187
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,956
Good.

188
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,837
Okay.

189
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,630
Get outta here!

190
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,390
What about them?

191
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,753
Go on, I'll take them!

192
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,831
Fireman here, calling Raven.
Come on in, Raven.

193
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,343
What am I? You made me.

194
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,112
A full-blooded combat soldier.

195
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,747
You just don't turn it off.

196
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,863
Talk to me Johnny

197
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,347
You just don't turn it off!

198
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,110
It's over.

199
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,235
Nothing is over!

200
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,749
When are you gonna come full circle?

201
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,752
I know the reasons you're here.

202
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,399
Aren't you curious to see how things
might have changed back home?

203
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,149
You've done enough damage.

204
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,385
You're always gonna
be tearing away at yourself...

205
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,348
until you come to terms
with what you are and you come full-circle.

206
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,873
So you are just going
to stay here forever?

207
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,517
John!

208
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,785
I wanna go home.

209
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,064
John Rambo!

210
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,638
John?

211
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,833
John Rambo?

212
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,187
My name is Arthur Marsh...

213
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,704
pastor of the Christ Church in Colorado.

214
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,711
I need to talk with you.

215
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,792
It's very important, I wouldn't
come here like this if it wasn't.

216
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,949
The morning of the day the group left...

217
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,473
Michael Burnett notified me

218
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,357
that they were
traveling from this location.

219
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,984
What happened?

220
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,104
No one knows, exactly.

221
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,465
They were supposed to return 10 days
ago, but they never came back.

222
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,506
I requested help from the Embassy,
but they can't help.

223
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,114
Not in Burma. And not in time.

224
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,824
How do you know they're alive?

225
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,867
Because we've been in contact with
the Karen Freedom Fighters who say

226
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,826
they think they know
where they were taken.

227
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,926
And I was given the name of an ex-military
American local from the embassy,

228
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:57,948
who put me in touch with men

229
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,350
who say they have experience in
this part of the world.

230
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,305
Mercenaries.

231
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,070
Yes.

232
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,788
I don't have any other choice.

233
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,745
You know the exact spot.

234
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,151
We need you to take these
men to where you let our people off.

235
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,345
When are they ready to leave?

236
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,588
When you are.

237
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,351
You know what you are.

238
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,113
What you're made of.

239
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,678
War is in your blood...
don't fight it.

240
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,236
You didn't kill for your country.
You killed for yourself.

241
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,548
God's never gonna make that go away.

242
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,394
When you're pushed...

243
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,835
killing's as easy as breathing.

244
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,342
# my head was mangled
and my words were torn. #

245
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,024
# covered in blood
like a newly born. #

246
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,191
# hey, the wishing well. #

247
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,351
# sing it soft and low. #

248
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,944
# I stayed for a while
in the hollow sound. #

249
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,102
# the only water came
up from the ground. #

250
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,385
Look at this fucking place.
Only a fucking ape would live here.

251
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,550
What the fuck am I doin' here?

252
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,552
Hey! Knock that shit off!

253
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,266
Seems you don't like the arts.

254
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,429
En-Joo don't like shit.

255
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,953
I like your sister, Diaz.

256
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,224
She's got a thing for retards.

257
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,265
Hey, boatman.

258
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,396
How much longer on
this ancient piece of shit?

259
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,230
So what did the Reverend say to you?

260
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,549
Some shit about how
his flock got missing.

261
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,619
I said, look here mate,

262
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,747
that's what you get when you go
trespassing into fucking Burma...

263
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,593
that's what you get when you go sniffing
around other people's garbage.

264
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,913
You know those
generals in there makin'

265
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:21,343
millions crankin' out meth more than
any other place on the fuckin' planet.

266
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,384
Bullshit.

267
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,628
Millions, moron.

268
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,426
How do you think
they pay for that shit army?

269
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,908
Try readin' the paper redneck,
instead of sleepin' under it.

270
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,832
Fuckin' generals,
biggest junkies of all of 'em.

271
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,912
It's noble, Lewis.
- You what?

272
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,948
Those people goin' in there
with no weapons. Just books and meds.

273
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,665
It's noble.

274
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,227
Fuck! Schoolboy.

275
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,151
You stick your noble nose
into other people's business

276
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,025
you get fucked up
or you get dead.

277
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,827
I'm only reason I'm doing this
is for an ex-wife and 3 kids.

278
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,310
After this shit's over,
you can shove that soldiering up your ass.

279
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,309
Try to be careful, mate.

280
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,832
Fuck off.

281
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,752
And you, I don't wanna fuckin' die
of old age before I get there.

282
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,715
So move.

283
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,713
You say something?

284
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,627
# sing it to yourself,
sing it all night. #

285
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,189
# spent a lotta time
in the garbage can... #

286
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,671
# fightin' over food
with the garbage man. #

287
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,910
# hey, the wishing well #

288
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,678
Bring that one out to the pigs.

289
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,147
# I was diggin' a well,
with an old blood stain #

290
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,744
# poking around with
a blind man's cane #

291
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,864
Is it me?

292
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,907
Or does the air this time of year
smell like a goddamn wet dog?

293
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,751
# he fell in my well like a... #

294
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,547
For God's sake,
I could swim faster than this.

295
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,663
Am I right?

296
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,669
You're dead.

297
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,910
Come on, chop, chop.

298
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,434
The quicker we get there,
the quicker we get back.

299
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,624
They come over here,
spoutin' all that shit.

300
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,347
And they expect the whole world
to work like their fuckin' neighbor.

301
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,942
Well, it doesn't.

302
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,305
So they send in a devil...

303
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,787
to do God's work.

304
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,392
It's ironic, isn't it?

305
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,665
Am I boring you, mate?

306
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,265
Or is it... is it the trip?
Has it got you nervous?

307
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,386
You should appreciate the action
you know what I mean.

308
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,516
It's gotta be better than
lookin' at the ass end of a snake.

309
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,152
Oh dear. You really are an
uptight bastard, aren't you?

310
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,511
You can drop that fancy ass stare.

311
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,513
I've seen it all before.

312
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,237
And I'm not that impressed.

313
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,262
He's old school SAS.

314
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,944
A first rate soldier but
told to be gone maniac.

315
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,383
They call me Schoolboy.

316
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,745
The name stuck with
me since sniper school.

317
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,911
And me mates won't stop calling
me that no matter how many people I shoot.

318
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,594
# still as patiently,
but time is... #

319
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,958
What do you want from us?

320
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,350
One man and a kid.
You gotta be fuckin' joking.

321
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,271
Is this all the rebels they've got?

322
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,224
I'm not likin' it.

323
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,030
We're in a fuckin' jungle,
there's nothing to like.

324
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,588
My name is Bien. This is Tha.

325
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,589
Is this it?

326
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,191
Yes.

327
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,031
What's up with the kid, man?

328
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,064
He good tracker.

329
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,992
We don't need a tracker,
we need a fuckin' guide.

330
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,627
You know the exact location, right?

331
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,905
10 kilometers west, two north,
six hour walk.

332
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,228
How many soldiers?

333
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,468
100, maybe.

334
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,993
100?
- What'd he say?

335
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,184
More new soldiers come tomorrow.

336
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,907
I'm just a white trash grunt,
but I can count.

337
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,945
Fuck fuckin' with a 100...

338
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,712
Let's get this straight.

339
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,472
We don't engage anybody.

340
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,550
If we can extract these people, good.

341
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,108
But it's in, out, clean or we fuck off.

342
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,190
Somebody wanna tell me
what the boatman's doin'?

343
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,590
Why aren't you waitin' with the boat?

344
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,113
My men are stayin' with the boat.

345
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,111
You're the boatman. You stay here.

346
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,109
I won't slow you down.

347
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,384
I know you won't,
it's not a fuckin' nature hike.

348
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,185
You can believe that.

349
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,792
He could hang with me at the back.

350
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,463
He's the boatman.
He stays with the fuckin' boat.

351
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,222
I want a white man on it,
not some fucking dink.

352
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,026
Who has explosives?
Brewster?

353
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,950
None.

354
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,224
Round of C4 and primer.

355
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,707
I got a Claymore.

356
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,871
All right.
Let's get on with it.

357
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,359
Come on, move.

358
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,507
What the fuck is that?

359
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,957
Called Tallboy Bomb.
English dump in World War II.

360
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,392
Your people.

361
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,745
Taken from here.

362
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,344
Man, I have seen some shit.

363
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,271
but I ain't never
seen no shit like this.

364
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,269
Weird.

365
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,918
Check it out.

366
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,309
Armies come.

367
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,825
Kill everything.
Leave our dead here as warning.

368
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,515
Go home. Tha hurry!

369
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,113
Mines everywhere.

370
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,513
Watch where you are walking.

371
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,950
Alright, let's move on.

372
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,348
To what?

373
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,022
They even killed the fuckin' dogs.
Those people are dead.

374
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,984
I'm with En-Joo.

375
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,991
We'll at least have to go have a looksee,

376
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,150
check it out.
- I'm with you, let's check it out.

377
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,832
Check what? They're 100 strong!

378
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,183
Hey, we took the man's money!

379
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,430
Hey, hey, hey.
Just calm down.

380
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,783
Calm down.

381
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,223
We go then. And we see what's what.

382
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,585
If anything's wrong, anything at all...

383
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,749
we leave.

384
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,030
All right?

385
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,399
Yeah.

386
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,317
All right.

387
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,182
Okay.

388
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,269
Which way?

389
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,713
This way.

390
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,745
Army!

391
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,749
Go! Go!

392
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,708
Should we fire on 'em?

393
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,143
No. If they don't make it
back to wherever they came from

394
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,822
they're onto us.

395
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,750
You hold the money.

396
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,712
I bet the one on the end.

397
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,828
What the fuck are they doin', man?

398
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,789
How long before they go missing?

399
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,791
Three hours. Maybe four.

400
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,711
Who are you, boatman?

401
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,425
Let's move.

402
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,785
Move? They'll hunt us down
when these guys don't show up.

403
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,234
We don't need this shit.
We're going back to the boat.

404
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,749
Any of you boys wanna shoot,
now's the time.

405
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,033
And there isn't one of us
that doesn't wanna be someplace else.

406
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,943
But this is what we do.

407
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,029
Who we are.

408
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,910
Live for nothin', or die for something.

409
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,755
Your call.

410
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,191
What's your call?

411
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:28,916
Let's move.

412
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,548
Once Schoolboy's on the tower,
we got 15 minutes.

413
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,471
Set your watches to 1:45.

414
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,984
We ain't waitin' around for nobody.
We'll meet at the base of the tower.

415
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,991
If he don't make it up there, we're fucked.

416
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,197
He will.
All set?

417
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,479
We're in.

418
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,030
Go!

419
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,676
Go!

420
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,916
Go!

421
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,710
Go!

422
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,915
Don't talk.

423
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,708
Where's the girl?

424
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,709
She's over there.

425
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,950
You untie him.
We'll be back for you.

426
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,635
Here!

427
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,670
Come.

428
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,744
There's two men are in the cage
near the pigs. Get 'em.

429
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,476
Got it.

430
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,750
Come on, come on!

431
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,431
Where's Sarah?

432
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,237
Shut up, come on.

433
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,230
Let's move!

434
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,229
Where's boatman?

435
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:32,945
And Sarah.

436
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,740
15 minutes. That's the
deal. We're leaving.

437
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:35,144
- Let's go.

438
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:35,910
5 more minutes.

439
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,433
Bullshit.
He knew the deal.

440
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,192
If we're getting away,
we fucking leave together!

441
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:39,871
Your life.

442
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,630
Let's go.

443
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,073
Not without her.

444
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,269
God didn't save your life.
We did.

445
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,986
Now fucking get up.

446
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,069
Get up.

447
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,308
Move!

448
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,116
This way.

449
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,109
- You got us covered?
- Yes.

450
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:32,791
Why'd you come back?

451
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,630
Why did you?

452
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,225
An hour till daylight.

453
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,673
This way.

454
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,999
My leg, my leg, Jesus, goddamn it.

455
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,709
Shut up, shut up,
we're getting you out.

456
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,904
His leg is broken.
- Oh shit.

457
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,423
Where's the guide?

458
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,509
That son of a bitch is gone.

459
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,544
Fuck him, I know the coordinates.

460
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,666
We're not going to make
it to the river without him.

461
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,228
Take off his boot.
- No!

462
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,185
Leave his boot on.

463
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,748
Let us in here, we're doctors.
I need a knife.

464
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,909
Here, here, here.

465
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,597
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

466
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,465
Will he make it?

467
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,311
I don't know.
Make a stretcher.

468
01:01:54,312 --> 01:01:55,312
Spread out!

469
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,152
Take the point.

470
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,070
You hear that?

471
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,396
They're tracking us.

472
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,470
Turn around.

473
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,344
What are you doing?

474
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,190
Just move.

475
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,872
What?
- Turn, turn.

476
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,303
I want you two to head
southeast to the river.

477
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,344
The boat'll be waiting.

478
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,349
If it's not there...

479
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,272
you can follow the shoreline till I find you.

480
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,793
What about you?

481
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,062
I'll be all right.

482
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,308
Give me that Claymore.

483
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,662
Now fire off a shot.

484
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,544
What?

485
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,595
Fire off a shot!

486
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,704
Go!

487
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,187
Go!

488
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:20,791
Come on!

489
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,223
Come on! Move it!
Move it! Let's go.

490
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,196
I got you.

491
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,629
Let's move

492
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:24,945
Get down, get down, get down.

493
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,997
What, what are you gonna do?

494
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,472
Son of a bitch.

495
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,038
Look.
- What is it?

496
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,590
Oh, God.

497
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,473
Oh god damn it!

498
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,391
You gutless fuck!

499
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,436
You fucking gutless shits.

500
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,192
Gutless fuck!

501
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,703
Have another go at me you lady cunt!

502
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,223
Come on you, fuckin' have a go at me!

503
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,553
Fuck! You fucking fucking Jesus!

504
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,716
Oh God.

505
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,703
What do we do?

506
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,039
Nothing we can do.

507
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,596
No!

508
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,228
The rebels.

509
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,029
Michael.

510
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,515
Michael.

511
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,755
Michael.

512
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,479
Michael?

513
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,595
Michael?

514
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,036
Michael?

515
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,553
Michael!

516
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,673
It's okay.

517
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,196
We'll help them. Okay.
