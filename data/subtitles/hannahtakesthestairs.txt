1
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,998
I need some water.

2
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,007
What?

3
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,304
I need water. It's--

4
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:58,901
Come on, come on.

5
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,878
- Oh!
- Whoa! Careful.

6
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,312
- I'm fine. Yep.
- You all right?

7
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,872
Okay.

8
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,310
Can you pass me my razor?

9
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,288
Yeah. I'm going to pull this in.

10
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,948
You have a little blue fuzz everywhere.

11
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,356
I have such a big day today.

12
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,552
I-- I shaved my legs.

13
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,754
I shaved my arm pits.

14
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,093
I washed my hair with the good shampoo

15
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,132
but not the good conditioner.

16
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,565
- Don't make fun of me.
- And--

17
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,529
- Oh, no.
- This is not coming off.

18
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,731
- It's so bad.
- We're gonna have to just cut your arms off

19
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,467
or put you in the shower again or something.

20
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,508
- Oh, it's everywhere.
- Who cares?

21
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,941
- I have blue nipples.
- Who care--

22
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,980
I'm a freak.
No one will love me.

23
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,073
Actually, they would really love you
if you went to work like this,

24
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,208
but that's probably not a good idea.

25
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,546
Yeah, probably not.

26
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,780
Oh, it's all over me.

27
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,253
Yeah, it's-- That's not good.

28
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,723
- Keep working on my arm.
- I'll work on the arm.

29
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,384
You work the torso.

30
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,587
- It's--
- So I have some pretty cool news.

31
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,687
- What's cool?
- I got a new job.

32
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,753
I upgraded.

33
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,299
What'd you upgrade to?

34
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,494
Well, I quit my job,

35
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,868
and now I don't have a job.

36
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,338
What I want to do today...

37
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,637
is go to the beach and hang out,

38
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,802
and that's my goal,

39
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:05,969
and I'm gonna complete it,

40
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,342
and I'm gonna feel good about that.

41
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,937
And I think you should come with me.

42
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,846
I have to go to work.

43
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,215
I can't help it.

44
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,618
It's stuck. I am a Muppet.

45
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,883
That's not--

46
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,254
You have to take a day off.

47
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,349
They're gonna think you're a freak

48
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,688
if you keep going in to work.

49
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,955
- Seriously.
- They won't think I'm a freak.

50
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,189
- They will.
- They'll think that--

51
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,595
- It's against the rules.
- They'll think,

52
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,757
"That's a very industrious young woman."

53
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,891
- Come on.
- "We should hire her."

54
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,265
Why don't you...take one day off?

55
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,702
Come to the beach with me.
We'll hang out.

56
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,797
It's a big day.
It's a big day today.

57
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,104
What's so big?

58
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,145
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

59
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,452
- So, um, you quit your job, huh?
- Yes, he quit his job.

60
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,316
- Quit my job.
- I want to do that.

61
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,446
I did quit my job.

62
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,648
Hannah's very excited about this.

63
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,951
- I'm very excited.
- I'm excited.

64
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,151
- She's very excited.
- I think that's awesome.

65
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,352
He's pursuing a full-time--

66
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,258
It's a step up of him pursuing...

67
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,921
nothing.

68
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,627
- Pursuing nothing?
- I'm a nihilist now.

69
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,101
I believe in nothing.

70
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,662
Now it's time for us to start a new band.

71
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,731
I mean, you know...

72
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,777
find, like...

73
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:12,936
He's not really sure

74
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,071
that music makes him happy anymore, either.

75
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,082
- Nothing makes anybody happy.
- Right?

76
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,447
You're right.

77
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,145
Actually, Hannah can tell you all about it.

78
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,652
- I can.
- You go ahead.

79
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,780
- Give her the scoop.
- Hmm.

80
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,189
Well, you know, his job doesn't
make him happy,

81
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,660
and he's not sure music makes him happy,

82
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,560
but he wants to go to the beach

83
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,565
- with... me.
- You got it.

84
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,622
Hmm.

85
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,463
So who are you sleeping with at work?

86
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,665
I'm not sleeping with anybody.

87
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,435
Whoa, where did that come from?

88
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,135
Well, you're all dressed up.

89
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,905
I'm not sleeping with anyone.

90
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,003
I'm just kidding.

91
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,378
Funny.

92
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,283
Okay, this looks good?

93
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,713
Yeah.

94
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,222
If you could put it a little tighter--

95
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,883
- It doesn't go tighter.
- Then it looks good.

96
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,095
Hello. Um...

97
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,502
like 2:00 today,

98
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,734
we got her up for meeting up,

99
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,241
- talking about the show.
- Mm-hmm.

100
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,403
All of us, I guess.
We can do that.

101
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,243
Um, basically, just going over the pilot,

102
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,909
what's gonna happen,

103
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,679
and, um-- Shit.

104
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,687
So, um, we got--

105
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,347
Yeah, let's just go over
some of that basic stuff.

106
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,482
- Uh-huh.
- These girls are gonna get some lunch.

107
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,150
And I'm gonna go check my email

108
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,888
and update my blog and all that.

109
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,657
- Okay.
- So I will--

110
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,254
- Let's meet at 2.
- Okay.

111
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,358
- This pilot stuff.
- 2:00. Cool.

112
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,925
- We have till 2:00--
- Fantastic.

113
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,631
-...to do nothing.
- As usual.

114
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,367
Um, what are you gonna do?

115
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,103
I'm-- I'm down with American history again.

116
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,169
How long was Franklin in Paris?

117
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,147
Uh... I don't know.

118
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,409
I'm not up to that part yet.

119
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,973
I think he wrote a lot of this in Paris,

120
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,541
- but he doesn't get that far.
- All right.

121
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,814
Was he over there more than once?

122
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,083
- Jefferson went to Paris.
- That's right.

123
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,819
He-- I mean, he was--

124
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,361
That's why we have ice cream,
because he went to Paris,

125
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,727
and they knew how to make ice cream.

126
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,392
And then he brought it back.

127
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,731
Well, he didn't bring back actual ice cream,

128
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,897
he brought back the recipe--
the-- the idea behind ice cream

129
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,702
to the United States, and that's why we have it.

130
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,640
That's why we call it Jefferson ice cream.

131
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,802
Yeah.

132
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,037
Yeah.

133
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,843
Uh-oh.
Oh! Ho-ho!

134
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,917
- What is that?
- Place her on the board.

135
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,077
Put me on the board.

136
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,950
- That was an ambush.
- It wasn't an ambush.

137
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,149
- You like red?
- I love red.

138
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,885
- Okay.
- Unfair.

139
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,551
This is--
This is history.

140
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,895
You've broken the gender barrier.

141
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,501
You're coming tonight?

142
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,064
- Oh, of course. Yeah.
- Okay.

143
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,235
- You don't have to.
- No, I'm really ex--

144
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,108
- I mean--
- But you should.

145
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,305
I am excited.

146
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,177
Um, well, awesome.

147
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,514
It's gonna be, uh...great.

148
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,577
So, I want to know what
your take on stripes is.

149
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,746
- Stripes?
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,948
- Well, I like--
- Excuse me.

151
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,581
- Do you guys know Hannah?
- Mm-hmm.

152
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,649
Do you know where she is?

153
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,490
I'm her boyfriend.
I'm not, like, stalking her, so--

154
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,688
Um...

155
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,991
She's probably in the production office.

156
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:19,997
Yeah.

157
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:20,998
Production office?

158
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,500
If you go left out the door,

159
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,762
it's just down the hall.

160
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,828
- Mm-hmm.
- That--

161
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,099
That way. Okay.
All right. Thank you.

162
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,105
- Yeah.
- Bye.

163
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,108
If you go somewhere and stay in a hotel,

164
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,736
or even if you just stay
with your friend who you know,

165
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,302
then, um--

166
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,540
then it's-- that kinda sucks,

167
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,742
but if you-- but if you go
and somehow meet somebody,

168
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,943
you get invited to the home

169
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,246
and you learn something about their culture.

170
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,082
They say, "Please, come have dinner with me."

171
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,746
We're happy, you know.

172
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,814
I was in Tiananman Square

173
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,587
- about 10 years ago.
- Oh, wow.

174
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,753
You were that guy in front with the camera.

175
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,694
I don't like to talk about it, but--

176
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,699
No, but it was after that, and I was very stupid,

177
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,133
I was waiting for them to do
this flag-raising ceremony,

178
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,865
and so I was sitting there,
and I was drawing in my journal,

179
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,271
and a little kid came over
and watched me draw,

180
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,036
and so I ripped the thing out
and gave it to him,

181
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,271
then there was another kid, and I drew,

182
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,745
and I was getting excited,
'cause I was like, "Oh,"

183
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,372
"I'm the ambassador of, you know"--

184
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,542
- Goodwill.
-... rainbows, yeah, and I was just like--

185
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,483
so, you know, I was writing,
"Hi, I'm from America,

186
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,715
nice to meet you," and like just drawing,
like, stupid--

187
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,781
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

188
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,486
And, uh...

189
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,927
All of a sudden I realized
there was no one around me,

190
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,432
and I look up, and there's eight cops,
Chinese policemen,

191
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,263
- Oh, my God.
- and another one rides up on a bike,

192
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,996
going "Where is he? Where is he?'

193
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,334
and one of them's holding one of the drawings,

194
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,306
and I realize I'm standing in Tiananmen square,

195
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,604
- handing out--
- Hey.

196
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,076
Hey.

197
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,112
- Hey, guys.
- Oh.

198
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,146
- I'm Mike.
- Hey, I'm Matt.

199
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,271
- Matt?
- Nice to meet you.

200
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,576
- Paul.
- Paul, Mike.

201
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,173
Good to meet you.

202
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,277
Um, I was wondering
if you want to go to lunch?

203
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,844
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

204
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,116
Um, yeah--

205
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,817
Are you guys going to--

206
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,325
Is it okay if I go to lunch?

207
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,553
'Cause I was thinking, like,

208
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,325
do the lunch and then Jeremy's band is playing
at the Empty Bottle tonight.

209
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,763
- Oh.
- We go to the beach tomorrow.

210
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,767
It's like a 1-2-3 punch.

211
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,202
I have this thing tonight, this work thing, um...

212
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,398
but-- but it's a party.

213
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,405
Oh, okay.

214
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,964
Hannah, if you have something,

215
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,634
um, better to do besides the party,

216
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,643
don't-- don't feel obliged.

217
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,644
No, I do--

218
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,839
And by the same token, Mike,

219
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,472
if you wanna come along to the party,

220
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,675
you're certainly welcome to--

221
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,115
We're having, like, a little work--

222
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,243
office gathering,

223
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,445
which you're-- you're invited to.

224
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,249
I mean, outside people are allowed.

225
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,346
That sounds great.

226
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,483
And depending how long you guys are,
we can even go after or something, so...

227
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,289
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

228
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,330
- Thanks for--
- Okay.

229
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,991
Well, now I have a party dress and a person.

230
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,000
- Party dress?
- Yeah.

231
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,660
- Cool.
- Yeah.

232
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,762
- Do you wanna go? All right.
- Yes.

233
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,773
- You don't have a thing?
- Oh, no.

234
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,139
Wanna pick up your phone
in case somebody calls you?

235
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,373
Sorry. They were telling
the anecdote. I couldn't--

236
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,435
Don't worry about it.

237
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,776
You guys, I'll see you.

238
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,373
- Bye.
- She screened my call, it's no big deal.

239
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,216
Just look out.
I'm gonna get on that board.

240
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,380
You need me to bring anything for the party?

241
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,084
Uh, just your handsome face.

242
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,456
Okay.

243
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,960
- Okay.
- All right.

244
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,360
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you guys.

245
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,627
- I'll be back.
- Okay. I hope so.

246
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,692
- See ya.
- See ya.

247
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,937
- We never got to hear the end of your story.
- Ah...

248
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,602
It was about Chinese...

249
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,305
Food?

250
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,607
- We could do that.
- Yeah?

251
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,807
We can definitely do that.

252
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,349
What just happened?

253
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:28,786
Um, we made a new friend.

254
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,687
- Uh...
- I didn't get to finish my humorous anecdote.

255
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,985
- You didn't?
- No.

256
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,924
You can finish it for me, 'cause let's be honest,

257
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,053
- who was actually listening to the anecdote--
- Sure.

258
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,188
...and has two thumbs?

259
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,767
Nothing personal.

260
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,470
We should wait until the first person arrives,

261
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,512
and then we start making it.

262
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,706
Yeah, that'll be funny, and then it evolves...

263
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,043
Right, the first--

264
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,949
Yeah, the first person
is generally uncomfortable

265
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,147
to be at a party, to be the first person.

266
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,986
If you walked into this fucking place--

267
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,422
Uh, yeah.

268
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,026
Wait, how--
how does this...

269
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,124
It's like you got to peel it off the back.

270
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,863
I hope Hannah's boyfriend appreciates this.

271
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,535
I think he's very sophisticated.

272
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,074
Do you want to go...

273
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,337
- Take me to the zone, man.
- Tubular?

274
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,208
Wherever you are, that's where I wanna go.

275
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,543
- He's unemployed.
- That's--

276
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,243
Well, that has nothing to do with vibe.

277
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,149
No, I mean--

278
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,744
It's because you're free and because you're...

279
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,086
I've decided that...

280
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,592
working didn't make me happy,

281
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,560
and playing in bands didn't make me happy.

282
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,895
And I'm always trying to seek out something
to make me happy,

283
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,958
so I'm just gonna do nothing for a while,

284
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,526
and I'm gonna try to do that really well.

285
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,335
And... I know it sounds stupid, but--

286
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,272
There's something to be said for that.

287
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,538
How do you do nothing?
What is--

288
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,204
I'm just figuring it out right now.

289
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,804
I just started today.

290
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,817
So today, I went to the beach

291
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,410
and, uh, got some sun...

292
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,977
and had some lunch.

293
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,454
That's something.

294
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,288
That was something, yeah.
I guess when I say nothing,

295
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,225
I mean more like I'm not seeking out

296
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,388
a professional goal professionally--

297
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,897
just kind of float.

298
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,557
So wait, Hannah has been telling me

299
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,931
about this thing that you guys are writing,

300
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,562
and I don't really know that much about it, so...

301
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,071
I'm curious.

302
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,333
We're writing it,

303
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,375
and then Brian Duges,
our boss, who's not here,

304
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,307
he created the show,
and then all these people--

305
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,642
and I don't think any of us
wanna talk about it.

306
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,203
The whole--

307
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,613
the concept, let me explain the work

308
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,208
because you don't work,
but if you did, and you went--

309
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,685
- I have worked.
- I know.

310
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,517
- I swear, I didn't mean it--
- Absolutely.

311
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,250
- No, I get it.
- I'm just saying

312
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,554
that if, like, a work party
is a thing where people go

313
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,423
- and talk about things other than work--
- Right.

314
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,462
... it's kind of a weird--

315
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,587
I gotta admit, like, I'm...

316
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,892
'cause I'm supposed to be the host here

317
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,296
- 'cause it's my place--
- Right.

318
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,594
- You're doing a great job.
- No.

319
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,397
- This is amazing stuff.
- This dip is--

320
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,458
The dip is wonderful,

321
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,504
the beer is great.

322
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,631
I've told you about the show.

323
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,004
I know you told me about it,

324
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,474
but I want to hear it from the guys.

325
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,068
- This place is great.
- Thank you. Thank you.

326
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,137
I've lived here for a couple of years.

327
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,149
So are we gonna have another party here?

328
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,742
If you guys want to.

329
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,787
- Yeah.
- Will you co-host with me?

330
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,913
- Co-host?
- Yeah.

331
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,456
- Co-host?
- Yeah.

332
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,718
We'll just, like, come over here

333
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,657
and say this is our party, too?

334
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,126
No, people do that,

335
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,753
I mean, especially when someone's
living alone,

336
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,888
they'll have someone--
like tonight,

337
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,297
- Matt was kind of my--
- Co-host?

338
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,925
Or like my consigliore, at least.

339
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,970
But he's also, just your, you know--

340
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,129
- My buddy.
- Yeah.

341
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,263
But I'm saying, if you guys--

342
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,637
because you're the ones with the party idea,

343
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,505
- so you guys could be my buddies--
- Well...

344
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,544
He's the one who's good at the parties.

345
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,636
Yeah.

346
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,044
- I am.
- You are.

347
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,604
How old are you, Mike?

348
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,671
I'm 28.

349
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,615
- 28?
- Yeah.

350
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,845
He's an older man.

351
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,478
- I'm an older man.
- That's not so bad.

352
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,113
- Eh...
- I actually thought it was worse.

353
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,623
You seem very mature to me,

354
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,784
- Oh, thanks.
- But that's--

355
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,352
You know, that...40 and...washed up--

356
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,829
40 and still fabulous.

357
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,389
I was-- I was...

358
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,764
- 40's the new 30.
- Yeah.

359
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,497
- You sort of have a boyish charm.
- It's a lot--

360
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,038
Now I want to rescind that

361
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,971
because it sounds like it's like a burn
when you say--

362
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,100
if I said that to you, "Oh, I thought
you were older,"

363
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,269
- then that would be--
- I-- I get you, I do.

364
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,744
I feel like you,

365
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,542
you feel like you wanna apologize
for some things,

366
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,480
but I totally--
I get your humor.

367
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,643
I'm gonna apologize for a lot of things, Mike.

368
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,653
- I don't want you to--
- This is a thing

369
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,348
that you should learn about me real quick.

370
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,390
Let's just do it.

371
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,618
Aww.

372
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,058
It's all good, dawg.

373
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,093
I'm really tired,

374
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,565
and I'm really hot,

375
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,364
and I'm...

376
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,769
kind of drunk.

377
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,172
Mm...

378
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,643
Ugh!

379
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,238
I wanted to be the funny one,

380
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,046
- and I'm never the funny one.
- That's not true.

381
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,142
Mm...

382
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,880
You are the funny one.

383
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,550
Not when he's around.

384
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,957
I want to make people laugh.

385
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,166
Thank you for letting me stay here.

386
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,569
Sure.

387
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,770
Do you think he was mad
that I didn't let him up?

388
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,106
Does it matter?

389
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,307
I guess not.

390
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,407
I just couldn't...

391
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,850
I couldn't be with him tonight.

392
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,387
I'll figure it out tomorrow.

393
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,482
We're gonna go to the beach
tomorrow, I'm gonna like...

394
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,722
I'll figure something out.

395
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,491
Hmm.

396
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,127
I'll sleep on this decision.

397
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:48,640
There's no decision, I don't know.

398
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,800
Hmm.

399
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,173
Just think about it.

400
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,212
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,442
Good night.

402
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,744
Good night, Rocco.

403
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,284
Good night, Hannah.

404
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,444
I love you.

405
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,317
I love you, too.

406
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,969
Are you still awake?

407
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,271
Hmm?

408
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,437
- Are you awake?
- Yeah, I'm awake.

409
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,505
Do you think I should break up with him
or stay together?

410
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,784
I don't know. It's your decision.

411
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,149
I don't want to make it.

412
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,517
Can you make it for me?

413
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,579
- Mm-mm.
- Fuck.

414
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,852
Um, close your eyes.

415
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,452
Are you gonna throw sand in my face?

416
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,522
I'm definitely not gonna throw sand
in your face.

417
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,297
- Wait, just keep 'em closed.
- Yeah.

418
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,928
And...

419
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,666
look down.

420
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,334
All right, you're good.

421
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,810
Wow, goggles!
Dive mask!

422
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,540
- This is awesome!
- Yeah.

423
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,582
So there's, like, treasure out there,
and we can go--

424
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,413
- We can go find it.
-...swim for treasure.

425
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,214
Oh, this is so nice.

426
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,652
This is, like--

427
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,349
You're great.

428
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,413
You can't open it, but...

429
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,653
and now you could open it for me?

430
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,854
Well, maybe we'll just use
these in the tub tonight.

431
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,294
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is good.

432
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,357
Jacques Cousteau in the tub.

433
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,561
I had this cousin Ronnie

434
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,001
who used to explore the depths

435
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,698
of my grandmother's pool with a mask.

436
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,967
You never told me about Ronnie.

437
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,906
We called him Ronnie Cousteau.

438
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,466
- Which Cousin Ronnie?
- Oh!

439
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,104
Cousin Ronnie.

440
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,206
I don't know some things about you,
I've realized.

441
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,773
Yeah.

442
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,876
That's probably true.

443
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,616
I have a cousin Ronnie who likes masks. Um...

444
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,385
- What else is there?
- Tell me more--

445
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,052
When I was 13,

446
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,087
I was-- I was in a two-and-a-half-year
relationship

447
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,532
- until I was 15 and a half.
- What?

448
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,399
That's amazing!

449
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,937
And we had this, like, big discussion

450
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,303
about whether we were gonna
go all the way or not.

451
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,171
We were convinced
we were gonna get married.

452
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,110
That's longer than I've ever been in anything

453
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,545
- in my whole life.
- Yeah.

454
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,812
Her name was Amy, and she was, like,

455
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,080
she was awesome, and then, uh,

456
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,247
I started getting into music and stuff,

457
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,880
and I thought I was really cool,

458
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,891
and because she wasn't a musician,

459
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,790
I broke up with her.

460
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,261
- Fucking asshole.
- Yeah.

461
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,797
Because I was just, like,

462
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,992
convinced that we wouldn't be
able to share that, and it was--

463
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,160
you know, it's when you're
first starting to learn your art.

464
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,760
Like, maybe when you first
got into playwriting,

465
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,738
it's, like, the most important
thing in the world to you,

466
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,706
- Yeah.
- and so I was just like "She doesn't get this.

467
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,333
We're not gonna be able to share this,"

468
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,843
and then I broke up with her,

469
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,380
and then I was depressed for, like, a year.

470
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,005
Until you were 16?

471
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,915
Until I was 16, yeah.

472
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,146
- Then what happened at 16?
- Then I got into sports,

473
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,212
and then I was, like, fine after that,

474
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,222
- but yeah--
- I didn't even--

475
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,315
What sports did you play?

476
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,122
I'm just not good with breakups.

477
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,662
- Yeah.
- I'm just not--

478
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,663
I don't know that most people
are good at breakups.

479
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,064
I think I'm especially bad with breakups.

480
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,729
Yeah, well...

481
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,704
- Okay.
- Yeah.

482
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,832
You know, I didn't
tell you this today yet,

483
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,502
but you look really beautiful in that mask.

484
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,909
You know, you really just--

485
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,813
- you look so gorgeous, and I--
- You're so nice today.

486
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,510
- Thank you.
- Mmm...

487
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,177
You look beautiful in your mask, too.

488
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,118
Thanks, man. Here.

489
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,093
Thanks for telling me. Thanks.

490
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,392
How's your foot doing?

491
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:34,825
- It's okay.
- It looks better.

492
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,162
It got some sand in it,

493
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,703
but I think it's actually gonna make it better.

494
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,237
It looks better.

495
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,296
Mm.

496
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,537
I really had a nice time today.

497
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,672
I know. Me, too.

498
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,182
- It was great.
- It was good.

499
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,210
What?

500
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,481
Nothing.

501
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,020
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

502
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,184
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

503
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,663
Um...

504
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,702
What's wrong?

505
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,758
I don't know,

506
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,668
- I'm feeling kind of hot.
- You're hot?

507
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,263
- Yeah.
- All right, hold on. I have a--

508
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,433
It'll just take a second.
I'll be right back.

509
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,567
Okay.

510
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,941
Don't move.

511
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,843
I don't know how this is going to work out,

512
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,211
but I've seen something
like this on Cinemax before.

513
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,251
Um, Cinemax?

514
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,377
Yeah.
Cinemax 2, actually.

515
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,442
- Here.
- It's really cold.

516
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,954
Lift up your arm, and just...

517
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,615
close it down there.

518
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,455
- Yaah!
- Aah!

519
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,960
It's good, right?

520
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,326
Yeah, it feels good.

521
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,489
And this is what-- all right,

522
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,690
this is what they do on Cinemax.

523
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,926
Let me show you how it goes.

524
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,992
Why do they smell like vinegar?

525
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,696
I don't think they smell like vinegar.

526
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,741
- They smell a little bit.
- This is what they do.

527
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,208
They guy puts it in his mouth, and he's like...

528
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,574
He actually doesn't make that noise.

529
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,170
I don't know what I'm talking about.

530
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,079
But then he does-- Let's lay back.

531
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,852
Like, against the wall.

532
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,019
They'll do these kinds of things

533
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,819
where they're like--

534
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,257
- And then you'll see the--
- Stop.

535
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,794
the stuff glistening, and they're like--

536
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,354
And they lick, and it's--

537
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,597
Yeah.

538
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,166
You're, like, quivering right now.

539
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,730
I know. I feel like--

540
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,179
- Okay. All right.
- For some rea--

541
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,579
All right. Okay. All right.

542
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,515
I don't know, um...

543
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,151
- I think, um--
- You're freaking out.

544
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,450
Uh, no.

545
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,124
I'm sorry, um...

546
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,857
Yeah, what are you--

547
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,156
Do you want to, um...

548
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,032
You just can't--

549
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,375
I know. I--

550
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,346
I know what you're gonna say, so--

551
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,474
I'm not gonna say anything.

552
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,450
I'm not saying anything.

553
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,747
Yeah?

554
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,513
Um...

555
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,789
I just-- I don't think you-- Um--

556
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,833
Can I just be honest?

557
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,869
I-- I'm always, like, laughing with you.

558
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,904
I'm never...

559
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,064
Yeah.

560
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,503
I don't think you can touch me anymore.

561
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,741
Okay.

562
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,219
- I'm sorry.
- And you had to--

563
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,587
You can't just leave me like this.

564
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,920
I'm not.

565
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,992
Will you please...

566
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,191
um...

567
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,270
Hannah?

568
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,703
What?

569
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,908
Do you want me to go?

570
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,707
No. I'm sorry. I'm doing this all wrong.

571
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,042
Um...

572
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,352
I'm just gonna, like, make it easier on you.

573
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,952
What?

574
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,615
I'm breaking up with you.

575
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,797
Because you want to break up with me

576
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,426
and you can't do it, so...

577
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,299
- Um...
- You know what?

578
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,998
It's no big deal.
Whatever. It's fine.

579
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,769
You know, we have sex, and-- and you're right,

580
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,606
I don't know your sisters' names.

581
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,942
And...

582
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,681
- I'm sorry.
- And it'll be fine.

583
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,215
Fuck.

584
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,784
- I--
- I'm, like, not upset.

585
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,088
I'm, like, not even upset.

586
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,132
I'm upset.

587
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,933
It's weird. I thought I was gonna be really
upset, but I'm not upset.

588
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,941
I'm really upset.

589
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,648
Okay. See you later.

590
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,996
# I got a good thing #

591
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,768
# I got a good thing #

592
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,434
# I got a good thing #

593
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,307
# I got a lovely thing #

594
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,074
# I got a lovely thing #

595
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,876
# I got a lovely thing #

596
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,974
# I got a lovely thing #

597
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,746
# Hell, fuckin' yeah #

598
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,230
# Hell, fuckin' yeah #

599
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,543
# Hell, fuckin' yeah #

600
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,065
Yeah.

601
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,533
I'll do the same for you.

602
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,163
Hold on. I want to feel it
on the back of my neck.

603
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,600
You're getting naked, too?

604
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:52,836
It's better.

605
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:58,871
Am I blocking it?

606
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,957
- Happy?
- And then you have to get me up.

607
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,927
Do it.

608
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,965
No, now it's gone away.

609
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,059
Oh, come on. Geez.

610
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,936
What I'm saying is that, like,

611
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,670
I feel like most--
most most plays--

612
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,870
try to speak--

613
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,072
speak to something about human nature

614
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,274
that the playwright finds is true.

615
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,647
- Yeah.
- And...

616
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,652
I think that it's hip right now

617
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,621
to-- to look at the world and have it be grim

618
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,282
in a certain way.

619
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,189
Like-- that, like, everyone's

620
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,955
fucking each other over and--

621
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,156
I don't know, but...

622
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,394
I just think that--
I think that the most massive tragedy

623
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,957
is not that people are trying to fuck

624
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,128
each other over purposefully,

625
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,568
which seems like that's, like,

626
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:54,866
what a lot of plays are about.

627
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,429
The most massive tragedy is that nobody,

628
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,373
like, really actually listens to each other.

629
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,468
- Yeah.
- It's every, like-- going like this.

630
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,013
They're just, like-- Everybody's in love with the
wrong person,

631
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,173
and nobody-- nobody actually,

632
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,514
like, hears what anybody else is saying ever.

633
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:08,711
Ever.

634
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,448
And that, you know--

635
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,116
I have to take off my goggles

636
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,126
because I'm gonna say something important.

637
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,820
I mean, like that's--

638
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,330
that's like...

639
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,625
that's, like, why Shakespeare's so tragic.

640
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,567
It is tragic on the scale of, like,

641
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,002
people are doing terrible things,

642
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,664
but it's also tragic because nobody hears

643
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,708
what the other person is saying.

644
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,835
- I'm trying to hear what you're saying.
- This room stinks.

645
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,574
- I know. I'm sorry.
- You know what I mean?

646
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,809
- I just can't really--
- I'm trying to really listen.

647
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,145
I get really frustrated

648
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,914
because I love things so much,

649
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,512
and I--
and I feel like my--

650
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,991
that what I do is so trite and small.

651
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,078
Okay, I got something.

652
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,669
- This'll trip you out.
- Okay.

653
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,975
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

654
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,609
I figured out this weekend
how to get a six-pack

655
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,811
without going to the gym

656
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,717
- or dieting or--
- Sure.

657
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,720
...doing sit-ups.

658
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,279
Want to see it?

659
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,881
- Yes. Yes.
- It's amazing. It's, like, so simple.

660
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,153
Yeah? Okay.

661
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,717
Wait a minute.

662
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,093
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

663
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,495
Okay.

664
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:28,930
Do we have to do anything?

665
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,729
- No, just watch. Ready?
- No, we're just watching?

666
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,464
- Okay, wait. Watch.
- So, all you have to do...

667
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,301
is let the air out of your lungs.

668
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,340
Look at that.

669
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,638
Look at that.

670
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,439
You look like E.T.

671
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,176
It's-- The air out-- You can--

672
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,617
- That's--
- It looks like a six-pack.

673
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,484
- Well, yeah--
- Where do you get this line from, Matt?

674
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,285
This is an amazingly deep crevice you have.

675
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,155
That's from, I think, when I sit.

676
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,591
- Look at this.
- Oh!

677
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,458
This is a pack of hot dogs. Ready?

678
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,464
- Ah.
- Look at that.

679
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,864
- That's amazing.
- That is--

680
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,027
- Can you do that again?
- Your body is amazing.

681
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,799
- How many dogs is that?
- Um, I'm the only one I know who can do--

682
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,271
- Wait. Okay.
-...a full-- a proper six.

683
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,398
- 1, 2--
- There's two on each side.

684
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,966
- Yeah.
- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

685
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,102
Ten dogs.

686
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,613
I can't believe how low
you can get your boobs.

687
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,817
If I had a handlebar mustache,

688
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,184
- you couldn't--
- That's so weird,

689
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,246
'cause now you actually do look totally buff.

690
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,382
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

691
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,925
I think that's a lot more impressive than--

692
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,052
- But your pecs are, like, on your shoulders.
- That's like Superman.

693
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,497
- That's a Halloween costume.
- All right, that's enough.

694
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:35,931
- Thank you.
- See, was I a liar?

695
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,865
- Come on.
- I feel...

696
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,460
I feel much better.

697
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,697
I really--
Yes, thank you.

698
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,400
Do you even remember
your boyfriend anymore?

699
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,941
Don't know his name.

700
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,779
You guys want to have a barbeque
later or something?

701
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,314
- Yeah.
- With some hot dogs?

702
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,848
- Barbeque?
- We don't even need--

703
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,884
- All we-- Just bring Matt, The Boob.
- We just bring Matt?

704
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,214
That's a barbeque on feet.

705
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,548
Yeah.

706
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,553
That sounds good.

707
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,886
Okay, so, uh, before you came in,

708
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,927
I was-- before the entertainment,

709
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,088
um, I was in the middle of the story, uh,

710
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,029
about the phone call I had this weekend

711
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,932
with-- with Marvin--
with the agent.

712
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,526
- Marvin the agent.
- It's good already, right?

713
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,866
Things I don't know.

714
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,406
Well, the back story is a couple month ago,

715
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,669
I get an email from this guy,

716
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,177
um, Marvin, the New York agent,

717
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,009
and he is, uh--

718
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,106
He says he's a fan of the blog and that he--

719
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,741
Oh, I'm a fan of the blog, too.

720
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,479
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, it's great.

721
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,522
Um, and so he says that he-- he wants to,

722
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,285
you know, go around and pitch this to,

723
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,522
uh, publishing houses
as something to do in print form.

724
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,460
- And, uh--
- Your blog's gonna be a book?

725
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,725
Whoa. You're like two or three or five

726
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,063
or six or seven or eight steps ahead.

727
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,500
- Um--
- Am I wrong?

728
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,901
His blog's gonna be a book?

729
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,666
Well, this is-- No, well,
the conversation this weekend

730
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,369
was that he-- he made it sound
like there was actual, like,

731
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,776
nibbles or that, like, we could be expecting,
you know, to get--

732
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,975
- That is amazing.
-... real bids in this week.

733
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,109
It is kind of amazing.
I'm kind of--

734
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,743
That's--
That's wonderful.

735
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,084
It would be cool. It would be cool.
It would be cool.

736
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,147
And it's great because it's already all written.

737
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,988
You just have to, like, put it together and--

738
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,551
Oh, Jesus! I'm so sorry.

739
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,324
- It's fine.
- I was trying to hit his arm.

740
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,558
- I'm sorry.
- It's totally fine.

741
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,264
So now you-- you're--
you've experienced success

742
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,364
in so many--
television and publishing--

743
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,635
You know what?

744
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,404
I'm gonna tell you something that I wouldn't--

745
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,876
The drugs.

746
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,176
I'm, uh, allowing myself

747
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,842
to enjoy the, uh...

748
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,043
the news.

749
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,142
- It'll be great.
- Good.

750
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,346
- But that's it--
- Maybe-- No!

751
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,721
Now the barbeque has a purpose, guys.

752
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,020
Right.
Let's celebrate.

753
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,687
- It's Paul's barbeque for his book.
- Yeah.

754
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,992
- Yay.
- Let's come dressed as Paul to the barbeque.

755
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,431
I don't know. All my plaid shirts are dirty.

756
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,400
- No, I've got some.
- You brought some?

757
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,936
- Yeah.
- Just in case?

758
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,733
- Here.
- What is this?

759
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,171
Are you giving--

760
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,538
That's extra.

761
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,906
I just had it just in case,

762
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,946
'cause I get so sweaty.

763
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,443
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

764
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,074
I need glasses, though.

765
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,948
I left my--
Oh, wait.

766
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,920
They're outside. One second. I'll be right back.

767
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,889
And you gotta wear your watch upside-down.

768
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,187
I don't have a watch.

769
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,385
Paul style.

770
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,361
That's the move.

771
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,260
It's always later than you think.

772
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,389
Yeah.

773
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,668
Um, we should probably work at some point.

774
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,399
You're already working.

775
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,304
You need--

776
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,741
- Yes?
- You're working hard.

777
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,037
So...

778
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,776
I can't do an impression.

779
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,613
- This is--
- That was kinda cool.

780
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,448
You made me sound like
Nicholson or something.

781
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,715
All you have to do is be self-deprecating.

782
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,381
- Yeah.
- False humility is good.

783
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,186
- Mumble.
- Yeah.

784
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,954
Um, do you want a ride--

785
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,588
Do you want a ride home after work today?

786
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,154
- 'Cause my car is out of the shop.
- Yes, I was just gonna--

787
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,360
- I was just gonna launch into complaining--
- It's running like a dream.

788
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,835
Yeah, I was just start
complaining about the bus.

789
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:02,134
- Absolutely.
- It's so hot. I love that.

790
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,468
Pretty soon, when this book hits,

791
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,838
I'm gonna be able to afford--

792
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,241
Just honk at me
as you pass me on the bridge.

793
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,403
Absolutely.

794
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,414
That's where most people throw their garbage
at me while I'm pedaling,

795
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,279
so it'd be nice if you just, like--

796
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,046
That part slipped out, right?

797
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,417
I had someone throw a Big Gulp at me once.

798
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:17,920
Uh...

799
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,715
Do you want to come up

800
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,920
- and meet my roommate?
- Absolutely.

801
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,053
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

802
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,528
- Cool. Thanks.
- Okay. Good.

803
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,757
- All right.
- Thank you.

804
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,163
That was less painful than I thought.

805
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,165
- Easy.
- Yeah.

806
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,633
- Yeah. Okay.
- Cool.

807
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,294
Ms. Rocco.

808
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,303
Hey.

809
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,634
Do you remember Paul?

810
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:36,638
He had that party.

811
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,265
Oh, yeah.
How are you?

812
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,173
- Good. How are you?
- Good. Okay.

813
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,109
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, you, too.

814
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,616
Um, I really like your apartment.

815
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,310
Yeah, it's our place.

816
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,750
We like it, too.
It's peaceful.

817
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,583
Pretty colors.

818
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,986
It's good. Yeah.

819
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,114
The yellow mellows you out,

820
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,590
and the red psyches you up again.

821
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,751
- Right.
- Yeah.

822
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,556
And then the blue--
It's balanced.

823
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,118
- Pretty relaxing.
- Do you want to sit down?

824
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,494
Okay.

825
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,431
Paul just gave me a ride home from work, so--

826
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,833
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

827
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,564
- Awesome.
- Yeah, it's pretty great.

828
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,900
What are you up to here?

829
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,907
Nothing. Just hanging out.

830
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,772
Um, just, like, killing time

831
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,744
and looking for a job,

832
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,212
but not really looking for a job right now.

833
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,272
- Right.
- Just kind of--

834
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,282
I'm gonna go.

835
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,579
Okay.

836
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,812
I'm just gonna go outside.

837
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,345
I've been in here for a really long time.

838
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,721
- Okay.
- Okay?

839
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,692
- I'll see you guys.
- Very nice to see you again.

840
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,785
Yeah, nice seeing you again.

841
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,490
- Bye.
- Bye. See you.

842
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,565
Do you think I'm doing okay at work?

843
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,009
Uh, you're--
Yeah, of course.

844
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,741
I think you're doing great.

845
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,409
Uh, here.

846
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,349
- Oh.
- Hello?

847
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,784
- Yes.
- Okay.

848
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,414
I think you're doing a great job.

849
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,052
I think you are ridiculously bright.

850
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:09,361
And I think you have a great spirit.

851
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,197
And I think that, uh,

852
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,897
you're probably the smartest person there.

853
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,963
And I think that, um...

854
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,669
Matt and I would be subsumed
in our own muck

855
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,838
without you to lift us out.

856
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,779
And...

857
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,216
that's why I go to work every day.

858
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,689
Thank you.

859
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,897
You're--
You're welcome.

860
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,524
Gotta--

861
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,932
Gotta go now.

862
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,232
These long-distance charges are killing me.

863
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,920
I want you to look at these ideas that I have.

864
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,854
Oh, cool.
"Halloween costume ideas.

865
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,949
"You will go as a ghost

866
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,960
smelting a jack o'lantern"

867
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,461
It's not done yet.

868
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,521
I thought it would be really cool to have, like,

869
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,829
a costume where it's a ghost and, like,

870
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,869
- all the classic things together.
- Yeah.

871
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,054
Good. Good. Good.

872
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,693
What?

873
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,336
Are you drunk?

874
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,567
Yes.

875
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,872
Uh-huh?

876
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,246
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

877
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,582
- Is it okay if I pee?
- Obviously.

878
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,052
Okay, I'm coming in.

879
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,554
- Okay.
- Thanks.

880
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,785
- Hello.
- Hi.

881
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,090
This is the first time I've peed in front of you.

882
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,255
Hmm.

883
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,323
- It's special today for us.
- Huh.

884
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,334
But I can't even see you.

885
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,835
I mean, not that-- I don't know.

886
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,633
That's not part of it, I guess.

887
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,799
- I guess.
- But I can't see anything without my glasses.

888
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,171
Oh, 'cause--

889
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,938
But maybe later I can watch you pee.

890
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,276
Yeah, maybe.
We'll put it on the docket.

891
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,413
No, I think it's kind of sweet.

892
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,508
It's kind of--

893
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,643
I don't know--

894
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,654
romantic in an old person kind of way.

895
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,883
Mm-hmm.

896
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,822
- Anyway, I'm done.
- Okay.

897
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,359
I'm gonna blow you a kiss.

898
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,827
- Ready? Okay.
- Okay. Yeah, I'm ready.

899
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,488
Oh... I caught it.

900
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,624
You can't even see me, and I caught it.

901
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,861
- No, I see where you are.
- You corrected it well.

902
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,870
- Okay.
- See you.

903
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,030
Bye.

904
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,238
- Look at that crazy guy.
- Mm-hmm.

905
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,403
- Do you see him?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

906
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,844
You see what he's doing?

907
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:46,144
- Um, I don't--
- But I don't really understand.

908
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,515
- No, I've never seen that technique before.
- Yeah.

909
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,146
They're pioneering
a new cell phone in Chicago.

910
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,985
He's wild.
Matt, you have to come see this guy.

911
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,957
- This is one of the all-time greats.
- Yeah.

912
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,253
This is, like--

913
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,124
- This is A-1 quality crazy.
- Crazy guy on the street.

914
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,719
- Matt.
- Matt.

915
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,128
- Matt.
- Matt.

916
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,723
- Matt.
- Matt, you have to come see the crazy guy.

917
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,962
- Matt's not home.
- Matt, oh, Matt,

918
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,833
come see the crazy guy with us.

919
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,395
Matt, he's gonna finish--

920
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,031
This is a once in a lifetime thing.

921
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,336
I gotta finish this.

922
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,173
I gotta go see him
and smell my flowers.

923
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,270
You're gonna see one of Chicago's premiere--

924
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,541
Mmm.

925
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,843
That's it.

926
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,646
Can I just smell these roses
and look at the crazy guy?

927
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,186
Bye, crazy guy.

928
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,015
He's about to go.

929
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,685
Matt, you're totally missing this.

930
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,194
Bye, crazy guy.
These are for you.

931
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,158
All right, what do you want us to do?

932
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,260
- You want to start work here now?
- Are you okay?

933
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,464
You want to--
No, he's in the zone.

934
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,529
- I understand.
- Yeah?

935
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,006
I've seen this man work before.

936
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,100
- He's in the zone?
- Yeah.

937
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,112
What can we do

938
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,842
to help you

939
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,508
through your time of trouble?

940
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,176
It's like we're going to marriage counseling.

941
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,742
Sorry.

942
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,914
- Yeah, why don't you help us for a change?
- Is that awkward?

943
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,183
All right.

944
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,125
Matt, you better not be like this tonight.

945
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,130
Come on.

946
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,223
What? It's for dinner?

947
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,927
Yeah.

948
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,628
Stop and smell the roses, man.

949
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,863
Don't give him my flowers.

950
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:14,962
I'm not giving them to him.

951
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,529
I'm giving him the scent.

952
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,132
- Okay, hit us.
- Leave him alone.

953
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,302
What are we doing today?

954
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,742
I just have to finish this statement.

955
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,109
- Okay.
- Okay?

956
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,807
Honestly, you guys have fun

957
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,179
and keep doing what you're doing,

958
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,239
- but don't--
- Don't involve you?

959
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,286
...feel like you have to suck me into it.

960
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,650
Yeah,
I'm just trying to--

961
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,781
I don't want to be here doing this, but I am,
so-- Okay?

962
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,416
- Okay.
- Okay.

963
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,910
Okay, give him-- He'll lose his concentration.

964
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,615
Fade to black.

965
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,057
Are we in trouble?

966
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,526
I don't know. I've never seen him
do that before.

967
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,256
We're in trouble. Ow!

968
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,456
Oh...

969
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,624
Are you okay?

970
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,030
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm so clumsy.

971
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,159
What did you do?

972
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,327
Look at that. Wow.

973
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,166
Big bruise in seconds flat.

974
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,706
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Mmm...

975
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,968
Thank you.

976
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,801
I'll fix this. This is my fault.

977
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,710
No, this is me.

978
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:31,748
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

979
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,282
- Okay.
- This is my problem.

980
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,908
I still feel like it's kinda my problem.

981
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,010
- I swear to God, he's--
- I'll talk to him.

982
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,577
I'll talk to him.

983
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,089
I love your garden.

984
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,556
Thanks.

985
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,218
- I like it, too.
- What are these?

986
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,792
God, I don't know.

987
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,092
What are those?

988
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,863
I put 'em there.

989
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,529
- Oh.
- Yeah.

990
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,163
They're magnets.

991
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,071
So that was, like, a funny joke?

992
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,110
Uh, was it?

993
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,145
Put it on the table.

994
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,804
Now let go of it.

995
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,277
Ah, well, that's neat.

996
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,377
Hold one end,
and we'll try to push them together.

997
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:11,944
- Okay.
- It's--

998
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,387
- You mean, like, against?
- Yeah.

999
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:15,582
They can't do it.

1000
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,024
They like each other too much.

1001
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,224
All right, there you go.

1002
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,857
- Yeah, we got it.
- It's like--

1003
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:23,922
Oh!

1004
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,928
I want to ask you...

1005
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,403
- what are you--
- To marry you.

1006
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,799
That looks-- That looks painful.

1007
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,105
What do you need to ask me?

1008
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,578
Okay, I want to know
what you think of Bush League.

1009
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:39,480
I like it.

1010
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,307
Ow...

1011
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:43,512
All right, wait. Give me--

1012
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,952
I want to get them closed.

1013
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,080
- Give me the marbles.
- Why?

1014
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,386
Give me--

1015
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,290
I want you to take--
Can I have the mar--

1016
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,726
Can I have them back, please?

1017
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,693
This is what you get

1018
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,166
for hanging out with
someone younger than you.

1019
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,294
Oh, now I'm in trouble.

1020
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,236
Take the marbles out of your nose.

1021
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,238
Oh...

1022
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,501
Give me--

1023
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,600
Sorry, Dad.

1024
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,440
You and Paul talk about this stuff all the time.

1025
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,208
- Yeah.
- You know he feels about it, right?

1026
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,748
I know how he feels, yeah.

1027
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,647
I don't really like things that are, like,

1028
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,278
sort of explicitly about what they are.

1029
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,822
I think it's both preaching to the choir,

1030
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:27,989
and I think--

1031
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,033
and I think you're--

1032
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,829
because of that, like, your audience is limited

1033
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,598
because it's not like someone
who is really conservative

1034
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,969
is gonna turn on this show

1035
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,632
and then their minds will be changed

1036
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,175
by what they see on TV.

1037
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,006
Not that I think it's gonna,
like, change the world

1038
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,568
or get Bush im--

1039
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,739
But I don't understand
why we can't be, like,

1040
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,373
this is really good.

1041
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,781
And now you're--
now you're--

1042
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,341
When you're talking,
you're sounding just like him.

1043
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,479
You're saying things that he said verbatim.

1044
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,318
No, I really came to these thoughts on my own.

1045
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,914
It's not because Paul said them to me.

1046
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,289
- You sound just like him.
- I know.

1047
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,692
But I really-- I hate it when people date people

1048
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,627
and then they just parrot what they say,

1049
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,892
but that's not what I'm doing.

1050
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,193
I actually did believe this before.

1051
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,256
Okay.

1052
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,268
Her thumbs are so close to me.

1053
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,531
That has three lenses or four lenses.

1054
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,073
Yeah, uh, that's--

1055
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,769
You'll find that common motif in my pictures.

1056
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,471
- Who is that?
- People pointing or--

1057
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,980
This picture is special for two reasons.

1058
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,515
Uh, her name's Margo.

1059
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,608
It comes out at you, like, and shoots.

1060
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,277
You ever see Friday the 13th III?

1061
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,718
This one's great because, number 1,

1062
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,722
you look really handsome in it.

1063
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,257
Thank you.

1064
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,451
And, um, oh, number 2,

1065
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,153
because it snapped right in for me.

1066
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,163
Like, it usually--
That was instantly 3-D.

1067
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,425
- My friend Charlie took that.
- That's awesome.

1068
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,091
It's actually--
He's really good.

1069
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,328
- You're playing the trumpet.
- Yeah.

1070
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,495
That's not important.

1071
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,970
Look. He looks like Tom Cruise.

1072
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,031
I-- I play the trumpet.

1073
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,077
- You play the trumpet?
- Yeah.

1074
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,133
- For real?
- You look like--

1075
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,577
- Yeah.
- I play the trumpet.

1076
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,274
- Hannah plays a mean trumpet.
- Do you really?

1077
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,909
Yeah, I played in my high school
marching band.

1078
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,247
You're kidding. I--

1079
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,912
I got a trumpet, like, five years ago,

1080
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,387
- and I took lessons.
- That's so wild.

1081
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:00,616
Yeah, my teacher--

1082
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,488
My teacher at the time said I was a natural.

1083
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,026
- Yeah?
- Yeah, because of my lip.

1084
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,857
'Cause I have a big, fat lip.

1085
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,829
That's so funny.
I really do play the tr--

1086
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,627
- I-I-I play--
- Do you still play?

1087
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,100
- I play occasionally.
- Yeah, it's fun.

1088
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,160
- You have a trumpet here in this apartment?
- Yeah, I do.

1089
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,170
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

1090
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,900
I definitely do.

1091
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,943
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, and I-- I, uh--

1092
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,637
No, I played in junior high and high school

1093
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,545
and I've kind of, like, kept it up since, but--

1094
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,480
- You have kept it up.
- A bit, a bit.

1095
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,347
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah, not entirely.

1096
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,080
That's crazy. I've never met anyone
who plays the trumpet.

1097
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,886
We should play. I have, like,
some music with the duets.

1098
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,255
- Yeah.
- Like, two parts.

1099
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,692
We could get together and we could play.

1100
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,457
Rocco, you gonna get in on that?

1101
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,793
I could.

1102
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,992
- Maybe it would just be a double duet.
- Rock it out.

1103
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,591
- That'd be awesome.
- That's be awesome.

1104
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,068
I haven't played in a couple of years,

1105
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,661
- so I'd like an excuse to.
- Agreement.

1106
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,468
Yeah, seriously.

1107
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,736
Shake.

1108
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,072
We're playing the trumpet.

1109
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,441
- That's awesome.
- We shook on it.

1110
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:56,604
I did not even know

1111
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,977
- there was such a thing as--
- Can we re-adjust?

1112
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,106
- You want me--
- Yeah.

1113
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,480
- You do me.
- Okay.

1114
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,451
- You get in there.
- How's that?

1115
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,850
- No, are you okay?
- Are you comfortable?

1116
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,252
I'm fine.

1117
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,721
Paul, this one's for you.

1118
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,155
- Okay.
- I think you'll like it.

1119
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,249
Oh, yeah.

1120
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,452
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What is it?

1121
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,757
Well, it's gonna take me a minute to get it...

1122
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,888
to snap in.

1123
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:14,953
Here, this one's for you, Hannah.

1124
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,590
Okay.

1125
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,067
Wow, I'm so excited we both play the trumpet.

1126
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,036
- I know, I feel like I found a friend.
- Yeah.

1127
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,662
- Yeah.
- It's like we're musical soul mates

1128
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,536
because very few people choose the trumpet

1129
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,200
as the instrument they want to play.

1130
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:27,368
It's a harsh instrument.

1131
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,844
- Yeah, not social.
- No.

1132
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,553
Okay?

1133
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,987
- Okay.
- Okay.

1134
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,183
- Okay.
- Okay.

1135
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,283
So, um, uh...

1136
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,828
Can I have one more kiss before I go?

1137
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:46,954
Yeah.

1138
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,292
Yeah...

1139
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,957
Yeah, you can have one more kiss.

1140
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,091
- Hm?
- Okay.

1141
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,226
Ready?

1142
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,360
Oh, I'm ready.

1143
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,426
I'm ready for anything.

1144
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,471
- Okay.
- Okay.

1145
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,234
All right.

1146
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,502
Mmm...

1147
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,603
Mmm...

1148
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,704
- Stay?
- That was...

1149
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,408
incredibly aggressive.

1150
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:07,848
It was...

1151
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,681
What do you want me to do?

1152
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,482
No, I wanted a soft, tender one.

1153
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,183
I don't know. I don't feel very soft and tender.

1154
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,192
You're an animal...

1155
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,694
a jungle cat.

1156
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,890
Okay, fine. Fine.

1157
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,330
All right, that was too soft and tender.

1158
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,924
I was looking for something in the middle,

1159
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,095
but we'll come back to that, we're gonna work
on that.

1160
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,102
- Okay.
- Tomorrow.

1161
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,399
Okay.

1162
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:33,910
Um, and tonight...

1163
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,604
You could work, too, you know.

1164
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,671
Work on what? You? No.

1165
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,909
You're gonna work on me tomorrow.

1166
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,177
No, I'm gonna work on my play.

1167
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,343
Exactly.

1168
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,886
Soft and tender.

1169
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,353
- So you understand.
- Okay.

1170
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,480
I understand.

1171
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,615
The work of the writer.

1172
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:49,852
Right?

1173
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,418
Yeah, I got it.

1174
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,363
This is exactly what Eugene O'Neill
would've done.

1175
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,424
Yeah, well, Eugene O'Neill was an alcoholic.

1176
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:04,137
And a fucking awesome writer.

1177
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,469
Anyway, that's not the point.

1178
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:09,706
The point is that I am...

1179
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,839
crazy about you, and that's why tomorrow

1180
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,281
we're gonna seriously consummate this tension

1181
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,376
that we're working on tonight.

1182
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,442
Okay, fine.

1183
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,818
- Or consummate--
- Okay.

1184
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,823
- Bye.
- Yeah. Okay.

1185
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,119
- Okay.
- Bye.

1186
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,420
Okay, see you tomorrow?

1187
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,018
You're not mad?
See you tomorrow.

1188
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,461
Want me to kiss your wound?

1189
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,555
Yeah.

1190
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,998
That's a sign of devotion.

1191
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,161
You should stay.

1192
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,533
- Careful.
- No.

1193
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:35,628
- Careful.
- No.

1194
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,798
You're gonna break something.

1195
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:37,931
I'm not gonna break anything.

1196
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:39,066
- Okay.
- Okay.

1197
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,507
I'll see you tomorrow.

1198
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,374
- I'll miss you, all right?
- Oh, yeah.

1199
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,578
Bye.

1200
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,515
Godspeed.

1201
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:49,779
I don't deserve you.
You've been great.

1202
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:50,877
- Good night.
- Okay.

1203
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,046
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

1204
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,646
- Take care.
- Yeah.

1205
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,192
Be cute tomorrow when I get back.

1206
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,318
I will be. I'm cute now.

1207
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,419
- I know.
- Yeah.

1208
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,428
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

1209
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,933
Okay.

1210
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,035
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1211
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,196
Okay.

1212
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,500
So here we go...

1213
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:47,270
with, um, The 1812 Overture.

1214
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,677
Don't-- really, don't expect anything.

1215
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:51,736
All right,

1216
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,043
I'm gonna face embarrassment.

1217
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,515
It's fine.

1218
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,449
Could you just look at her?

1219
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,452
This is gonna be so humiliating,

1220
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:58,579
when you're better than me.

1221
00:50:58,655 --> 00:50:59,986
- Just look at her.
- Okay.

1222
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,456
You guys are great.

1223
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,776
Yeah!

1224
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,608
Yay, we won the war!

1225
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,669
You did it really well.

1226
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:58,679
I just gave it--

1227
00:51:58,748 --> 00:51:59,976
You just-- music.
I don't know.

1228
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,142
I'm actually very good.

1229
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,016
I'm-- I'm sure.

1230
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,389
##

1231
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,056
That doesn't help.

1232
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,620
You have a lot of power in your--

1233
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:15,824
- Yeah.
- It was a blast.

1234
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,197
- That's right.
- Mine is more--

1235
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,099
##

1236
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,575
So are you looking
at the notes or the numbers?

1237
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,637
I kind of have this memorized.

1238
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,383
But I mean, originally...

1239
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,383
I have to--

1240
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,420
Can I take this home?
Can I bring it--

1241
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,749
Yeah, yeah, yeah, take it home.

1242
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,619
- Can I bring it on Monday to work?
- Yeah, definitely

1243
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,714
- I'll copy it.
- Okay.

1244
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:42,951
You want to play it together?

1245
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,254
Yeah, can we just, like,

1246
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,726
- have a slow beat or something?
- Yeah.

1247
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:46,819
Go really slow.

1248
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,694
##

1249
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,553
Brainstorm.
Get your mind working.

1250
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,783
Exercise it.
Bananas for the brain.

1251
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,883
So, uh... let's say...

1252
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,791
Okay, we get
a new client calling up,

1253
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,660
and, um, yeah, Minnie's
answering the phone.

1254
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,255
Say "ring."

1255
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,528
- Ring, ring, ring.
- Okay.

1256
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,728
Hello, this is Minnie de Palma.

1257
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:27,929
How can I help you?

1258
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,232
Okay, did you-- yeah.

1259
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,968
Just go over answering the phone
and stuff with her.

1260
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,009
- Okay.
- Okay.

1261
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,771
So, yeah, say...start over.

1262
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,004
Yeah, so you answer the phone.

1263
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,809
"Hey, this is Jim Henson."

1264
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,975
- "Jim Hen-- It's Jim Henson."
- Oh--

1265
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,450
I want you to-- okay, I want--

1266
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,111
- Hello, Mr. Henson.
- Yeah, hello.

1267
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,087
I want you to come up
with a new Muppet for me.

1268
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,851
Can you come up with a new Muppet?

1269
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,482
Wow, I'm really honored.

1270
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,220
Great. Okay,
so what we're gonna do--

1271
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,693
Okay, okay.

1272
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,195
So we're gonna come up
with a new Muppet--

1273
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,390
- Should I hang up?
- I'm just gonna--

1274
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:56,557
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1275
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,123
My concern, Marvin--

1276
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,601
The thing that I'm concerned about
is that we keep--

1277
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,695
You're talking to them,
and I feel like

1278
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:03,704
you're getting mixed messages from them.

1279
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,297
I love--
I love the pretzels.

1280
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,501
and then you relay it to me,

1281
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,168
and it's a muddle to me.

1282
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,770
If I could get
in touch with the main--

1283
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,246
Um...

1284
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,909
Yeah, Catherine
over there,

1285
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,953
whoever's actually
gonna be the person.

1286
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,009
I haven't been
through this before,

1287
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,453
so you tell me--

1288
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,450
Okay.

1289
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:23,617
Okay, so--

1290
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:24,751
So, Catherine.
So just...

1291
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:26,090
If there's
an opportunity,

1292
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,130
and if I have to go to New York to do that,

1293
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:30,462
that's fine,
but, um...

1294
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,398
But I think it's only gonna get done,

1295
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,664
only get cleared up,
if I can understand

1296
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,138
what they're looking for, what they're--

1297
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,107
It's hard for me
to work and do,

1298
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,735
you know, ten different things over here and
then...

1299
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,142
You should have
all his--

1300
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,147
- Mm-hm.
- He should have all, like...

1301
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,807
he should have
all his toys everywhere,

1302
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:50,216
and then Brent can trip on them.

1303
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,447
Yeah, it's fine.

1304
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,955
I'm happy, I'm glad. I'm thrilled that--

1305
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:54,956
Um...

1306
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:56,287
Let's write fire truck.

1307
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,418
Fire truck?

1308
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,122
Is that a-- is that
a clever trick you know?

1309
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,788
You don't remember that
from when you were a kid?

1310
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,992
What starts with an F
and ends in an uck?

1311
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,728
- Fire truck.
- Okay.

1312
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,326
Big laughs.

1313
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,497
That's absolutely your--

1314
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,130
Do you want to go to lunch?

1315
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,196
- Uh, yeah.
- Like, now?

1316
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,537
Yeah, I think we should go to lunch.

1317
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,134
- We'll write this when we get--
- Yeah, we can--

1318
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,803
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

1319
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:20,909
And, um...

1320
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,646
And I'll, uh...

1321
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,888
Yeah, well, I'm on the phone
to you a lot, Marvin.

1322
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,090
And-- And I love it. And I love it.

1323
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,891
Keep it coming.

1324
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,954
I don't know, I just feel taken advantage of,
'cause he's like...

1325
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,432
Yeah, well, I'm--

1326
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,593
Like I'm doing all the work,

1327
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,637
and he doesn't even like
the show, and he--

1328
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,434
I know, I know. I just...

1329
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,871
And I'm happy for him.

1330
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,705
Like, I'm happy that he's got...

1331
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,746
things going on, but I don't know.

1332
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,338
Well...

1333
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,542
I can tell you...

1334
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,085
Take whatever frustration
you have and, like,

1335
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,883
multiply it by 50,

1336
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,787
and that's, like,
how I'm feeling, 'cause...

1337
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,052
Because of work?

1338
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,788
No, I mean, I like work,
and he's, like, never--

1339
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,524
like, we're doing,
you know, all of it.

1340
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,657
And then...

1341
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:11,894
I don't--
he just doesn't--

1342
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:15,995
He's, like, so unavailable to me at all times.

1343
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,336
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Yeah.

1344
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,000
I don't need
a lot of time.

1345
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:23,910
I just, I just, every time
I try to be with him,

1346
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,641
he's always got
somewhere else to go

1347
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,807
and something to do.

1348
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,111
But I think he's having,
like,

1349
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,812
an accelerated thing
right now, with his book,

1350
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,149
you know what I mean,
so it's like...

1351
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,780
I know, but it's like
you were saying,

1352
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:36,417
he's just, like...

1353
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,155
I mean, I don't know,
I didn't know him before this,

1354
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,993
but I-- I feel like he's--

1355
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,498
I don't know.

1356
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,659
He's in this place
where he's not very good

1357
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,465
at balancing, like, work
and everything else,

1358
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,938
or even, like, his work
and actual work--

1359
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,872
Have you guys talked
about it, or...

1360
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,102
Kind of.

1361
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,304
He's crazy about you.
He's like--

1362
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,471
Yeah?

1363
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,482
Yeah, totally.

1364
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,643
Everyone at the age
of-- by 13

1365
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,381
should picture what they-- where they want to
be,

1366
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:08,788
visually picturing where you want to be in your
life,

1367
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:11,986
and not necessarily
that's where you're gonna be,

1368
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,792
but just to sort of have somewhere you want to
go, having ambition, you know?

1369
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:19,028
"Brian Duges on bass..."

1370
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,265
got me
through high school.

1371
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:25,330
But I don't play
the bass, you know?

1372
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:28,866
The bass guitar is what I wanted to do and
never got into it,

1373
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,004
So...

1374
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,446
I have some...

1375
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,781
The job you guys are-- $74

1376
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:37,979
Um...

1377
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,181
The job you guys
are doing is great.

1378
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:43,248
Everyone's-- Paul, everyone is talking about--

1379
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:44,520
about everything
you're doing.

1380
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,858
I mean, it seems it's coming across really well.

1381
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,727
I think...yeah.

1382
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,995
Very, very, very good decision on Brian Duges'
part

1383
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,296
with this team.

1384
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,098
Like...brilliant.

1385
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,435
So...there is not--
yeah.

1386
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:58,838
Don't let any of that
get you down,

1387
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,398
even when something bad
comes in here,

1388
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,741
when I come in here with bad news or
complain, or whatever.

1389
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,508
It's-- Ignore it. Okay?

1390
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,415
Doug?

1391
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,181
What up, homes?

1392
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,823
Okay, you draw the mouth...

1393
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,226
and then...

1394
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:23,060
you draw a cigarette...
with smoke.

1395
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,362
I see how your cigarette's
already better than mine, though.

1396
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,527
What are you talking about?

1397
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:27,797
It has the distinction of the ash.

1398
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:28,769
Well, yours is great 'cause--

1399
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,396
I tried to make smoke circles.

1400
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,799
You're getting fancy. That's lesson 2.

1401
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:34,901
I know, it's bad.

1402
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,570
Okay, and then the fi-- ready?

1403
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,807
Yeah.

1404
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,350
Oh, my God.

1405
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,679
Here, you do
that part.

1406
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,913
Wait, you got a bad pen.

1407
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,422
That's what's wrong with my picture.
It's the pen.

1408
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,981
See, look, 'cause she's
got nice, defined lines.

1409
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,287
Yeah, that's a huge part of it.

1410
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,521
Cool.

1411
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,290
I think these are really good.

1412
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,832
She's very talented.

1413
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,889
What is this?

1414
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,161
No, you are.

1415
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,203
You should hear her music.

1416
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,034
Hannah, please!

1417
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:04,437
What? It's true.

1418
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:05,439
Is that your guitar?

1419
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:06,873
I think--
That is my guitar.

1420
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,069
She's good at playing music.

1421
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,133
She's good at drawing.

1422
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,236
She's good at so many things.

1423
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,371
Hannah's amazing
at many things, too,

1424
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,778
as I'm sure you know from work.

1425
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:16,512
But you can't, like,
you can't do it at a party here.

1426
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:17,518
Yeah.

1427
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,418
Oh, crap.

1428
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:20,751
Oh, God...

1429
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,552
- Oh, I'm so--
- That's all right.

1430
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:27,024
Here, um... thank you.

1431
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,723
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

1432
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:29,890
It's all right.

1433
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,365
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Thanks.

1434
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:32,560
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

1435
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,693
Move.

1436
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,129
Sorry.

1437
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,334
It's like musical couch.

1438
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,843
Does someone want
to switch with me?

1439
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,843
- No.
- No.

1440
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,004
Are you sure?

1441
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,445
We have to switch
the drawings, though.

1442
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:46,539
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1443
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:47,776
- L'chaim.
- Yeah.

1444
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,477
- You gotta look at the person.
- Yeah, I know.

1445
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:50,541
Did you? Okay.

1446
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,087
Sorry.

1447
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:55,147
It's cool. No, don't be sorry.

1448
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,991
Do you know why people
clink glasses?

1449
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,324
Um...

1450
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:03,559
somebody told me once... but--

1451
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:04,930
because of poison.

1452
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,128
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah, totally.

1453
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,295
I think that's really cool.

1454
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,963
Yeah, 'cause you would clink,

1455
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,870
and then your drink would spill
into the next person's drink,

1456
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,033
so it's like a way of saying

1457
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,406
- "I didn't poison you."
- Right.

1458
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:17,503
It's because people are, like, naturally,
like, terrible to each other.

1459
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,842
Exactly.

1460
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,780
- Basically.
- And so every time you go "Cheers."

1461
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,784
Nihilist over here.

1462
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,320
I feel like most basic assumptions behind,

1463
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,652
like, you know, cultural protocol are all--

1464
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,589
they all have to do with the fact

1465
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:30,990
that people are, you know, awful.

1466
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,584
Yeah, totally.

1467
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,357
No, the handshake is...
you shake someone's hand

1468
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,897
because you're showing
that you don't have a weapon.

1469
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,932
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

1470
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,058
People are shits.

1471
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,726
But if you think about it, though--

1472
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,202
Sorry.

1473
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,533
I don't know why people--

1474
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:44,630
No, me, neither--

1475
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:45,696
...are for the death penalty

1476
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:46,799
because it doesn't deter crime,

1477
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:47,900
- but also, it's like--
- Sorry.

1478
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:48,944
No, it's okay.

1479
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,309
Are you working on your scribble?

1480
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,177
- Yeah, I'm working on the scribbles.
- Yeah?

1481
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,545
I made the dinosaur meaner.

1482
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,413
Look at that.
You gave him a mouth.

1483
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,747
Yeah.

1484
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,084
But he still looks kind of friendly, I think.

1485
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,181
Yeah.

1486
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,226
He's a friendly dinosaur.

1487
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,086
Yeah, it's unconstitutional.

1488
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,722
Just that argument alone,

1489
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:13,701
the fact that more blacks are killed
by our judicial system--

1490
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,101
Of course,

1491
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,638
'cause they're the ones
who can't afford a lawyer.

1492
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,867
They're the ones who are,
you know, people--

1493
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,499
Cops are cruising their neighborhoods,

1494
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:24,273
and it's like they don't
stand a chance, you know?

1495
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,008
That's cool, Hannah.

1496
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,846
It's a really interesting-looking coffee cup.

1497
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,078
It's a mean-looking coffee cup.

1498
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,120
It's awesome.

1499
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,176
Wait, so is this part of--

1500
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,620
Here, you want to know a little trick?

1501
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,555
put a line right there,
for the mouth.

1502
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:36,614
Right here?

1503
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,593
Yeah, like, that's your cheek.

1504
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,821
Yeah, exactly.
You know what I mean?

1505
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,056
Like, the mouth's opening,

1506
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,258
so you see the other side of the mouth.

1507
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,732
You're my hero.

1508
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:46,962
That's a totally different perspective.

1509
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,197
That'll be 50 dollars.

1510
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,433
Can I have this?

1511
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,599
- Yeah.
- Really?

1512
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:55,667
- Yeah.
- Okay. I really like that.

1513
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:02,808
I'm done. My work here is done.

1514
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,096
You guys like puzzles?

1515
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,141
He's like, he makes these things
that are, like, perfect,

1516
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,700
like, these perfect little quips,

1517
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,110
and I'm just like, "blah-lah-lah."

1518
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,169
You're different.

1519
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,182
Yeah, I'm not, I'm not--

1520
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,343
I don't know. I get nervous.

1521
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,182
That's okay.

1522
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,586
My shrink, when I was in high school,

1523
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,214
- always used to say--
- You have a shrink.

1524
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,385
When I was in high school,
used to say, like,

1525
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,952
"Tolerate the uncertainty."

1526
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,190
What does that mean?

1527
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:55,465
That means tolerate the uncertainty
of not knowing, of the nervousness,

1528
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,233
all of that, you know, like,

1529
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,434
it's just about allowing it to sit with you.

1530
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,944
- Did he give you any plans to cope?
- She.

1531
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,536
Oh.

1532
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,774
Sexist.

1533
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,322
Hello.

1534
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,895
Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.

1535
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,463
Hang on a second.
Just hang on one second?

1536
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,209
Yeah, if you, I mean,

1537
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,771
you can stall as long
as you want or stall until--

1538
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,146
because I don't...you know, like,

1539
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,117
I always have
the same answer for you,

1540
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,484
is that I'm always saying that--

1541
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:46,920
that I have to trust your judgment

1542
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,389
'cause I don't know
the protocol on these things.

1543
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,855
Ahem.

1544
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,422
Okay, well, before we get into--

1545
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,525
Let me just--
Let me just cut you off,

1546
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:03,094
and I'll call you back in,
like, 10 minutes, okay?

1547
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,274
Cool. Thank you. Bye.

1548
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,561
All right, so this is an owl.

1549
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,372
Does it hoot?

1550
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,437
Uh, I hope so.

1551
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:20,777
- Hoot-hoot!
- Ahhh!

1552
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,181
Yeah.

1553
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,316
- That's a Kingfisher.
- Okay.

1554
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,652
Have you had enough?

1555
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:29,986
Yeah.

1556
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,687
I think I like the owl best because--

1557
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,663
I don't really know what a Kingfisher
sounds like in nature.

1558
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:39,531
But the owl, I could have the pleasure
of anticipation of the hoot.

1559
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,627
Do you know what a Japanese Tit sounds like?

1560
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:42,830
No.

1561
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,396
Beta-carotene. Isn't that for sight?

1562
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:47,442
Uh, I'm not sure.

1563
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,000
This is because...

1564
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,340
Very green.

1565
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:53,211
I was worried about, uh, skin cancer,

1566
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:56,843
and my doctor said that I should
take Beta-carotene...

1567
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,285
I think.

1568
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:00,879
I can't remember,
I wish it would just say--

1569
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,083
Maybe I should take Beta-carotene.

1570
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:03,420
You want it?

1571
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,653
I'm more interested
in the prescription ones.

1572
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,320
- Oh.
- I'm gonna be honest.

1573
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,421
- This is Lexapro.
- What's that?

1574
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:10,988
It's an antidepressant.

1575
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,034
What's this one?

1576
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,035
- Wellbutrin.
- What's that?

1577
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,934
That's an antidepressant.

1578
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,097
What's this one?

1579
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,607
This is also Wellbutrin, but...

1580
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:21,370
I keep forgetting to take--
I should just combine--

1581
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,071
Did you want to tell me about these?

1582
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,409
- Did I want to?
- Yeah.

1583
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,073
You mean,
that's why I was gonna--

1584
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,310
I don't know.

1585
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,786
- Um...
- How long have you taken these?

1586
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,254
I went on 'em...

1587
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,722
two years ago?

1588
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,053
Why?

1589
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,354
I got depressed.

1590
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,520
Well...

1591
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,894
How did it--
how did it happen?

1592
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:45,160
I broke up with someone.

1593
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,634
Long relationship.

1594
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:50,171
So does it make you feel better?

1595
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,231
Uh, it makes me not feel depressed.

1596
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,675
- Yeah.
- It's definitely weird.

1597
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,373
I really didn't want to do it, and uh,

1598
01:06:58,447 --> 01:06:59,778
and then I just sorta...

1599
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,317
I was really just kinda desperate
for something to happen,

1600
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,376
and so I went on it, and...

1601
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,785
about ten days into it,
I was walking--

1602
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,050
I went out to get lunch,

1603
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:11,218
and I was walking over this bridge
back to my house,

1604
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,124
and I just like,

1605
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,423
it was like a commercial.

1606
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,964
Like, all of a sudden,
the clouds parted--

1607
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,294
- Really?
- Yeah, and I was like,

1608
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,266
"Oh, that's what I feel like.

1609
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,563
"This is who I am."

1610
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:21,694
- It was really weird.
- Really?

1611
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,399
Yeah, and then I was just-- and I--

1612
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,872
for a couple of months,

1613
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,932
all I talked about in therapy was just...

1614
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,568
"I hate the ads...

1615
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,306
"The ads look like science fiction.

1616
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,507
"I don't want to be taking a pill.

1617
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,379
"It's gonna ruin my edge,
it's gonna make me less funny,

1618
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:36,850
- it's gonna make me--"
- Yeah.

1619
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,443
"... not be able to write,"
and...

1620
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,716
I haven't had any of that.

1621
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,882
- Wow.
- And it's like...

1622
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:42,981
Now I'm like, "Oh, okay,

1623
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,425
it's like, if I had high blood pressure,

1624
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,155
I'd be taking high blood pressure medication.

1625
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,390
I don't think they've got a pill for what I've got.

1626
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:51,558
What do you got?

1627
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,192
You sound like--
Wait, that's from a movie.

1628
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,964
- You sound like, uh, Dorothy.
- Dorothy?

1629
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,368
"I don't think there's anything in that bag--"

1630
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:57,872
- Who's Dor-- Oh.
- From Wizard of Oz.

1631
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,874
"I don't think there's anything
in that bag for me."

1632
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,102
Doesn't she say
something like that?

1633
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:02,201
Nothing there.

1634
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,302
What? What--

1635
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,903
Chronic dissatisfaction.

1636
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,508
I want the clouds to part, and it's like,

1637
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:12,611
suddenly everything makes you happy
for a consistent amount of time.

1638
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,781
Like, basically, for me,
it's like, I stopped sleeping.

1639
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,484
Like, I stopped sleeping and eating.
So it's, like my--

1640
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:19,323
basically the things
that I weren't dealing with--

1641
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,726
wasn't dealing with?

1642
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,457
- I get paid to write.
- Yeah.

1643
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:24,294
The things I weren't dealing with

1644
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:27,733
caused my body to finally
just start, like--

1645
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:30,067
it became biological.
I had to go to a doctor and say,

1646
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:31,766
"I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm not sleeping.

1647
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,832
"I'm not eating.
I keep thinking about death.

1648
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,501
"I don't feel like myself.

1649
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,570
"None of my friends want to talk to me
'cause all I want to talk about is--"

1650
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:39,636
Yeah.

1651
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,206
You know, and, uh...

1652
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,149
So people, like, they get to that point,

1653
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,847
and then they take antidepressants,

1654
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,048
and it was explained to me that, like,

1655
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,318
you're in a hole, basically,

1656
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:51,086
and it's impossible
to get out of the hole--

1657
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,458
That's how you feel like when you're
depressed. It's debilitating.

1658
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,622
Like, you really feel like
you can't do anything,

1659
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:57,222
and when you take antidepressants,

1660
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,460
it doesn't get you
out of the hole, but it--

1661
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,435
I feel like I'm doing an ad
for antidepressants.

1662
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,836
But you basically...
it was explained to me that you--

1663
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:06,636
the antidepressants, like,
build a floor for you to stand on

1664
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,734
so that you can try
and climb out of the hole.

1665
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,244
So it's like--
The mistake people make

1666
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,644
is that they go on them,
and they don't do...

1667
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,615
- They don't--
- They don't--

1668
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,150
They're like, "Oh, cool,
everything's fine,"

1669
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:18,152
and then they don't...

1670
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,087
they keep, like, you know,
squashing their problems,

1671
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,624
like they don't deal with their problems,

1672
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:25,159
then they get depressed again,
so then they up their dose,

1673
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,320
and they up their dose,
and when you're on,

1674
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,557
lIike, yeah, eight different
types of medications

1675
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:32,066
and you're taking, like...

1676
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,159
People have problems, man.

1677
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:36,033
Yeah.

1678
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:38,335
Why are you chronically dissatisfied?

1679
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,999
Or were you just making a joke?

1680
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:43,476
No. Not really, um...

1681
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,173
Sorry.

1682
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,808
I don't know.
People are delicate--

1683
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:53,685
I'm getting, like, really...

1684
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,850
I feel like I've been,
like, unfair-- I don't know.

1685
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:59,554
I just didn't--
I just didn't know we can--

1686
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:00,856
You didn't know what?

1687
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,261
We can--

1688
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:08,760
I don't know, affect people
in certain ways that--

1689
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,940
Never mind-- I don't know. I just--

1690
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:19,003
Maybe I haven't been, um...

1691
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,048
It sounds-- it sounds,
like, really stupid,

1692
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,917
because it sounds like
what I'm saying is, like,

1693
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,422
"Now that I know
that you're depressed

1694
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,980
"and you have these things, like,

1695
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:33,119
"I can no longer treat you
with carelessness."

1696
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,595
But that's actually what I'm thinking.

1697
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,866
I tend to leave destruction in my wake.

1698
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:47,568
- I, um...
- I think you're being...

1699
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:48,735
I don't know.

1700
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,245
What's going on with you and Paul?

1701
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,756
I don't know.

1702
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,197
Is everything okay?

1703
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,199
Uh, no.

1704
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:18,532
Just like...

1705
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,201
Otherwise, why would I, um, be here?

1706
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,780
Talk about it.

1707
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:27,941
No, I feel like I'm being unfair to you.

1708
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:30,110
Why? Here, wait, I'll be right back.

1709
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:33,382
Ahh, don't leave.

1710
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:36,447
I feel like my life raft is gone.

1711
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,621
I don't want to--

1712
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:47,729
- Hey--
- No, you're...

1713
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,134
- I don't know what's--
- You're good,

1714
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:53,607
and I'm using you to, like,
cover things up and...

1715
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,507
gee, I don't know,
you deserve more than that,

1716
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,841
and that's, like, the shittiest first thing
to tell a person,

1717
01:11:57,913 --> 01:11:59,278
because they know
that they deserve more

1718
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:02,749
than whatever the person's
giving them, I just--

1719
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:06,845
I don't know, I feel
like I was trying to--

1720
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:09,720
I don't know, just use you to make me feel
good, and it's like,

1721
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:14,229
"No, this is a person.
It's a person with problems."

1722
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:17,925
Not that you have only problems, but it's like...

1723
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,695
I don't want to use you.

1724
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:22,760
I'm ram-- I keep rambling.

1725
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,529
I don't--

1726
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:35,648
I don't know
what it has to do with me,

1727
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,686
and I'm not sure what--

1728
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,311
Like, we're friends...

1729
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:40,821
Yeah.

1730
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,084
And, like, if I had
something going on, I'd--

1731
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:47,989
I don't know what--

1732
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,928
I don't even know
what you're sad about,

1733
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,260
I don't even know what--

1734
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:56,861
- I don't know.
- I mean, why do you feel like you're using me?

1735
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:58,099
No...

1736
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,004
Because, um...

1737
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,313
I don't know. You, like...

1738
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,481
You, like, look for me.

1739
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:14,886
You, like, look for my eyes.

1740
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:16,322
You, like, look to make me laugh.

1741
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,916
And that's, like--

1742
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:20,325
That's just, like,
ego and gratification.

1743
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,160
And, I mean, I'm just--

1744
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,004
It's like why do I-- I don't know.

1745
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:33,439
I just feel like I'm
seeking too many people out.

1746
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,180
It's almost, like--
Have you ever felt, like,

1747
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:44,083
there's something, like,
manic about, um...

1748
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:47,384
having crushes on people?

1749
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,617
- Something manic?
- But the-- that, like,

1750
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,993
Like, you're like,
"It's-- It's so exciting.

1751
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,996
And it's, like, this person and this person,
and it's so much fun."

1752
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,497
And then it just, like--

1753
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,434
one by one, they
sort of become, like,

1754
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,369
real and problematic,

1755
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,273
and people get hurt, and, um...

1756
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:10,445
it stops being thrilling.

1757
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,377
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1758
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,416
I just had a bad day.

1759
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:15,745
What happened?

1760
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,092
You're playing Immanuel Kant.

1761
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:16,152
Okay.

1762
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:18,358
Matt, and you're
playing Isaac Newton.

1763
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:19,866
I just want to hear it out loud

1764
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,664
'cause I just wrote these pages
over the weekend,

1765
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,864
and-- I don't know--
um, I just want to hear them

1766
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:25,634
so I can change them.

1767
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:29,438
Kant, in a previous scene,
tried to touch Newton,

1768
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,445
and Newton hit his hand away.

1769
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:35,176
- And that happens again.
- Let's do the old, uh, handshake gag.

1770
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,184
It's weird to be in director mode with you guys.

1771
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,685
Anyway. Okay.

1772
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,221
So, uh, yeah,

1773
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,085
I'll read the stage directions.

1774
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,421
Speed is essential.

1775
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,482
Okay.

1776
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,858
Vivaldi plays. Cut.
They look at each other.

1777
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:51,126
Look back. Awkward pause.

1778
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,191
"That's stupid.
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard."

1779
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,896
"I thought we were best friends."

1780
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,303
"Best friends talk
to each other honestly."

1781
01:17:58,373 --> 01:17:59,362
"Right, right. I knew that."

1782
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:00,840
- "And that was stupid."
- "Why?'

1783
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,309
- "Because look around you."
- "Okay."

1784
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:04,504
"What do you see?'

1785
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,012
- "Uh, stuff?'
- "No."

1786
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,605
- "No?'
- "You see consequences."

1787
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,775
"It's impossible to see intentions."

1788
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,442
- You guys are talking like old men.
- Oh.

1789
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,487
You're supposed to be talking
like 13-year-old boys.

1790
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:14,283
- Okay.
- Um...

1791
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,323
You see...

1792
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:19,053
We... Iike... make--

1793
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,220
We-- We-- I guess we--
we start with, like,

1794
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:24,288
uh, baseball and federal agents
and George Bush,

1795
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,800
and, um, getting kicked in the balls

1796
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:29,666
and, uh, slipping on banana peels
and that sort of thing,

1797
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,171
and those are our ingredients.

1798
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:34,299
- How do you make it, uh...
- Um...

1799
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,674
Drama out of abstract ideas?

1800
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,305
That's why it's hard.
That's why I made them 13-year-old boys

1801
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:43,818
and that their primary thing
is to get laid.

1802
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,853
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1803
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,718
- No, don't go to the bathroom.
- I'll be right back.

1804
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,279
No.

1805
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:50,289
- Okay.
- Okay.

1806
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,826
- Well, I think I like it.
- Oh, thanks.

1807
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,294
- But I want to read the rest.
- Can I have it back?

1808
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,923
You guys were--
I really need to see it with actors.

1809
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:00,729
- I don't know.
- We're not actors.

1810
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,963
- No, you're not actors.
- We really showed our hand on that one.

1811
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:04,903
You guys are--
You guys have low energy.

1812
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:06,838
Most of the time my ears will be closed.

1813
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,375
I was worried-- I had other worries,

1814
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:10,104
but now all I'm worried about is my play.

1815
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,543
Good.

1816
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:13,205
- Yeah.
- You're focused on work.

1817
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,374
Yeah, I guess so.

1818
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,542
How are you feeling?

1819
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:17,812
I'm okay. How are you?

1820
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:18,910
Pretty good, I think.

1821
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:21,182
Yeah. We should probably talk later.

1822
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,382
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1823
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,425
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

1824
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:25,482
Yeah.

1825
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:29,956
- I'm so sorry.
- You're killing me.

1826
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:31,999
- I know.
- You're--

1827
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,932
I'm so sorry.

1828
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:34,991
- Mmm...
- Should I--

1829
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:43,876
I am going to, um...

1830
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,539
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

1831
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,547
Okay.

1832
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,345
And I can't-- It's--

1833
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,681
- I won't miss you. I'll see you, but I--
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1834
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:53,846
- I'm gonna miss--
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

1835
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:56,786
I'm really sorry.

1836
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,086
- Okay.
- I'm really sorry.

1837
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,991
I want to end this conversation.

1838
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:02,029
- And not because it's not--
- Yeah.

1839
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:04,531
You know, I just don't want
to be here anymore.

1840
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,123
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

1841
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,828
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

1842
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,530
- Okay?
- Okay.

1843
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:10,571
- I have to go.
- Bye.

1844
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:11,901
I absolutely have to go. I'm sorry.

1845
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,203
- Okay. I'm so sorry.
- Okay. No, no...

1846
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,004
That is just what the city needs

1847
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,166
is another Latino theater festival.

1848
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:21,539
I can't wait.

1849
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:24,773
Get some tickets to that.

1850
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,006
Why do we even--

1851
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,743
Why did you show up to work today?

1852
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:30,409
Because that's what
you pay me for, Ryan.

1853
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,953
Right. That's what I don't pay you for,

1854
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:36,115
but that's what the network
pays us for is to be here,

1855
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,556
and it doesn't make any sense

1856
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:42,063
why there are two empty
chairs in this room.

1857
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,427
Um...

1858
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,989
office romance.

1859
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,125
We'll do a little quiz.

1860
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,966
Office romance:
good idea or bad idea?

1861
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:52,165
Which do you think?
It's a bad idea.

1862
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,868
So whatever's been
going on around here

1863
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,137
I hope is done,

1864
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,907
and I hope that, uh, we
can get a show written.
