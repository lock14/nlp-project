1
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,760
<i>Breathe from your pelvis,</i>
<i>and meditate on the movement of water.</i>

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,960
<i>Raise your Swadhisthana chakra.</i>
<i>This is the sexual center of your being.</i>

3
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,240
-Wayne.
-<i>What do you call a lawn without a pool?</i>

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,080
<i>Well, I call it a yawn.</i>

5
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,200
<i>Hi, I'm Wayne the Pool Guy...</i>

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,720
<i>...and I've been installing swimming pools</i>
<i>in the Greater Cleveland area...</i>

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,880
<i>...since 1976.</i>

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>Our service is classy,</i>
<i>and the pools are definitely splashy.</i>

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,760
<i>So take the yawn out of your lawn</i>
<i>and call me today for a free estimate.</i>

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,200
<i>Oh, Wayne. Come on in, the water's fine.</i>

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,560
<i>That water is fine.</i>

12
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,440
"Dear Mr. Knudsen...

13
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,080
...I was delighted to hear of your company's
interest in relocating to Cleveland.

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,600
Over the last decade,
our city has transformed itself...

15
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,760
...from a decaying industrial town
into a vibrant, world-class metropolis.

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,360
What was once
'the mistake by the lake' ...

17
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,440
...is now 'the roar by the shore."'

18
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,440
Do you know how many times
I've typed this letter?

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,280
No, but you do.

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
One thousand four hundred
and eighty-two times.

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
How sad is that?

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,840
Oh, check this out.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,960
It says here that 30 million American
women suffer from sexual dysfunction.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,560
-Can you believe that?
-What do you mean by sexual dysfunction?

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,680
As in, no payoff.

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,200
Oh, I thought you meant something weird,
like a physical abnormality.

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,800
You don't think 30 million women
is weird?

28
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,200
We're talking about a chronic failure
to achieve orgasm.

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,520
Think they could write
about something important.

30
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,200
You don't think orgasms are important?

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
I'd shoot myself if I couldn't come.

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,960
Thirty million women would
shoot themselves if they couldn't come.

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Hey, teacher. You forgot your sandwich.

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,240
Nice performance, Jack.

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,520
-Good impression on the kids.
-Hey, blow me.

36
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,280
You know, I'm worried about you, Jack.

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,120
You used to be the most popular teacher
in Carmen High.

38
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,680
And now look at you. You're a shithead.

39
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,960
-You think it might be depression?
-Why would I be depressed?

40
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm a biology teacher
in the Cleveland public school system.

41
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,240
Well, beside being the football coach,
I'm also the school counselor this year.

42
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,400
So if you have any problems,
I'm here to hear.

43
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,480
-Who taught you that?
-I did. You like it?

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,080
It sucks.

45
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,120
I know it's hard to reach out,
but you need help, Jack.

46
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,680
You wanna help me? Pass the steroids.

47
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,400
You know, I don't really believe
in all this depression stuff.

48
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,440
I mean, it's very simple.
There are men and there are babies.

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
And you, you're a baby.

50
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,280
I mean, every night, you go to bed with
the most magnificent woman in Cleveland.

51
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,160
I mean, that'd be enough
to make any man happy.

52
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,400
Good talk, coach.

53
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,880
I mean, sure would make me happy.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
I mean, it would.

55
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,680
-I'm sure you can guess why we're here.
-No way.

56
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,480
That's right. Yamaguchi Industries
decided on Cleveland...

57
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,760
...and they're bringing 400 jobs.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,520
Quite an achievement,
considering the recession.

59
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
Congratulations, Miss Vice President.

60
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,880
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

61
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,480
You can't really be surprised.

62
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,200
So how much is the raise?

63
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,440
I've got a lot of really
creative employees, Priscilla.

64
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,040
And you know what?
They're a dime a dozen.

65
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,880
But you're a rare breed.

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,440
You're creative,
and you're predictable.

67
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,280
So awesomely, unbelievably predictable.

68
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,560
And that's the quality I prize most.

69
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,280
Yo, why are we wasting time
with this textbook?

70
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
I could write this textbook.

71
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,560
-It's a college-level textbook.
-Yeah, junior college.

72
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,480
You wanna learn something now?
I thought you knew everything.

73
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,320
All right.

74
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,560
-Where'd you get it?
-The cafeteria.

75
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,760
I need a volunteer.

76
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,480
You're all so eager. All right, who can
name the subspecies it belongs to?

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,280
Right.

78
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,040
-<i>G. pardalis babcocki</i>.
-That's absolutely right.

79
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,480
-Well done....
-Kristen. Kristen Taylor.

80
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,680
Right, Kristen. Come on up here, Kristen.

81
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,200
Hey, Garbin. Wake up.
Kill those lights for me, would you?

82
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,680
I want the rest of you
to take some notes.

83
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,000
Garbin, kill the lights.

84
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,920
All right, can you properly identify
each portion of the shield?

85
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,720
Sure. Over here's the marginal...

86
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,320
-...then the pygal, the costal...
-Right. Yeah.

87
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,520
...the vertebral and....

88
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,080
The nuchal. N-U-C-H-A-L.

89
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,120
Some people say "nuchal,"
other people say "nuchal."

90
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
I say "nuchal," but that's because
my people are from Russia.

91
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,840
Nuchal.

92
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,880
I got a promotion.

93
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm a vice president.

94
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,920
Really? Way to hustle.

95
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,200
Come on, Jack. Be happy for me.

96
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,120
Yeah. We could do stuff.
We could maybe even get a pool.

97
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,800
-I don't want a pool anymore.
-Why not?

98
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't want my belly
offending the neighbors.

99
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,880
Here's to me. Congratulations, Priscilla.

100
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,880
Here's to you.

101
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,840
Congratulations.

102
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,320
Do you have any idea
what your frigidity has done to me?

103
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,680
It's called sexual dysfunction.

104
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,520
I'm sorry. Do you have any idea what
your sexual dysfunction has done to me?

105
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,400
No? Let me tell you.

106
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,240
You marry the prettiest girl in Cleveland,
and you think:

107
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,320
"All right. Everything's going my way.

108
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,160
I mean, all right, we have this one
little thing, but we can deal with it."

109
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,280
I mean, you know that joke, right?
How do you make a woman come?

110
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,440
Who cares?

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, after 10 years of failed fucking....

112
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,600
God, 10-- How many times
you suppose that is?

113
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,000
We've had sex 1482 times,
not including this morning.

114
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,280
Well...

115
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,920
...all my failure begins to take a toll.

116
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I mean, look at me. Am I really
the man you thought I'd become?

117
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,120
What's wrong with you?

118
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,160
Nothing.

119
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,280
-What the hell are you doing?
-Jack left. He moved to the garage.

120
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,120
He says it's because
I have sexual dysfunction.

121
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,200
He said that?

122
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,320
-What an asshole.
-No, it's true.

123
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm one of 30 million nonexistent
American women with sexual dysfunction.

124
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
When was the last time
you were functional?

125
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,480
Sexual dysfunction, as in never in my life.

126
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,920
-You've never had an orgasm?
-No.

127
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,400
Wow, that's just so weird.

128
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
What about masturbation?

129
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,120
-No, I don't do that.
-But you have.

130
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,640
No.

131
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,880
You've never masturbated?

132
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
Never.

133
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
<i>Strike three!</i>

134
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,720
<i>Caught looking. Looks like it's gonna be</i>
<i>a long season for the Buckeyes.</i>

135
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,880
<i>What do you call a lawn without a pool?</i>
<i>Well, I call it a yawn.</i>

136
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,920
<i>Hi, I'm Wayne the Pool Guy....</i>

137
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,680
--<i>and the pools are definitely splashy.</i>

138
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,040
<i>The water's fine.</i>

139
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,240
<i>That water is fine.</i>

140
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,840
Let me see if I understand this.

141
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,120
You think that you're unhappy...

142
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,520
...because you feel that you can't
give your wife an orgasm.

143
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,840
It's not my inability to give her an orgasm,
it's her inability to have one.

144
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,120
If it's her fault, then why are you
letting it ruin your life?

145
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,960
I don't care about the orgasms.

146
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,960
I gave Mary Slotnick
six orgasms in one night.

147
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Jenny Fitzgerald got the nickname
Opera Girl because one night--

148
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,040
Okay, okay. We get it. We get it.

149
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,720
I mean, I have staying power,
my penis is above average.

150
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,120
Well above average.

151
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,960
-Is that true?
-I don't know. What's average?

152
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,760
Smaller than mine.

153
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,120
It's smaller than mine.

154
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,040
Now, Priscilla, do you feel
that you fulfill Jack's needs?

155
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,280
-We have sex whenever he wants.
-Do you enjoy it?

156
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,480
I've never thought of it in those terms.

157
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,080
But I suppose I don't not enjoy it.

158
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,040
-So it's a duty?
-Yes.

159
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,120
-No, no. It's not a duty. It's....
-I'll be honest here.

160
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,720
My wife is very good in bed.

161
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,360
-She is?
-I am?

162
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,560
Yeah.

163
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,840
-You've given me a lot of pleasure.
-Thank you.

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
But how can I feel like a man
if I can't make you come?

165
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,440
Your inability to give me an orgasm
is not the measure of a man.

166
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,160
It's what you make of yourself
that determines your worth...

167
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,360
...not your performance in the bedroom.

168
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,680
That's horseshit.

169
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,000
So if you were in a car accident,
became a paraplegic...

170
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,840
...and your penis didn't work,
you would just give up on life?

171
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,240
You got it. Yeah, pretty mu--
Hey, no dick, no life.

172
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,680
-Can you believe this guy?
-For many men...

173
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,000
...the center of the self is the penis.

174
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,760
<i>Thank you.</i>

175
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,960
Okay, well, let's say I'm willing
to accept that. What then?

176
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,280
There's a simple solution
to your problem.

177
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,080
There is?

178
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,560
-I can't believe that guy.
-What an idiot.

179
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,480
"My name is Dr. Harry Lee."

180
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,960
"But you can call me Dr. Harry."

181
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,760
Oh, God.

182
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,640
-You don't need a vibrator, do you?
-No.

183
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,160
I don't need a vibrator.

184
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,240
I mean, that's just silly, you know?
We need to be daring, without batteries.

185
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,760
God. I don't get it. You're so close,
and then it just stop--

186
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,840
-What did I do wrong?
-You didn't do anything wrong.

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,280
Fifty million women
in the United States...

188
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,240
...suffer from orgasmic dysfunction.

189
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,040
Fifty million.

190
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,400
But tonight, we are going to
cut that number by 10.

191
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,360
Because tonight, we are going to learn...

192
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,480
...about the healing power
of masturbation.

193
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:13,360
The greatest source of energy
known to womankind.

194
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,800
Yes, yes, yes!

195
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,720
Now, I want you to write a name
for your vagina.

196
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,120
Anything you please.

197
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,880
Satin Doll. Happy Hole. Betty.

198
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,960
Christen her. Own her.

199
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,880
It could be anything you choose, you know.
All right, does everybody have a name?

200
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,520
Let's see. What have you got there?

201
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,760
Oh, that is splendid.
But that could be a boy's name. Change it.

202
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,920
Is everybody finished?

203
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,280
Everybody? Every beautiful little body?

204
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,000
All right. Now I want you each...

205
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,520
...to draw a picture of your vaginas.

206
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,600
I am looking for
a metaphorical representation.

207
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,520
Yes? Yes? It could be anything you want,
but please, let's make it artistic, yes?

208
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,840
You know what I mean, don't you?

209
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,000
Think Picasso. Think van Gogh.

210
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,360
Now, each of you will notice...

211
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,560
...that you have a small hand mirror
on your easels.

212
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,920
I want you to discover your vaginas.

213
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,160
Every glorious fold.

214
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,440
Every beautiful nook and cranny.

215
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,800
This is your power center.

216
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,320
Liberate your labia.

217
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,360
Value your vulva.

218
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
Claim your clitoris.

219
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,560
-Claim it! Christen it.
-I don't think I've ever looked at mine.

220
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,440
Start looking.

221
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,680
Come on.

222
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,040
Come on.

223
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,200
Down you go.

224
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,320
Hello, Fifi.

225
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,040
-Hey, Mr. Chase.
-Get down. Someone might see you.

226
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,480
Okay, get up, get up.
Someone might see you.

227
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,480
-What do you want?
-A ride.

228
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,920
To the Case Western University
biophysics lab.

229
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,560
-I work there.
-Good for you.

230
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,040
I'm not in pain, you know.

231
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,240
Have you looked at yourself lately?

232
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,040
That's just the aging process
doing its dirty work.

233
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,880
-Come on, 45's not that old.
-I'm 36.

234
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,120
Look, I don't want you, Mr. Chase, okay?
I respect you.

235
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,400
-Oh, respect.
-Yeah, respect.

236
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,040
Teachers are some of
the most important figures in society.

237
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,800
Nobody gives a shit about teachers.

238
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
Teachers don't even give a shit
about teachers.

239
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,160
Let me tell you a story, okay?

240
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,760
When I was 15, I was a dedicated stoner.

241
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,160
But then I took your Intro to Bio class,
and it turned my head upside down.

242
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,640
I mean, the Golgi complex,
cytoplasm, the double helix.

243
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,920
I mean, you taught that stuff
with such passion.

244
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,680
So I dumped my stoner pals, hit the books,
and now I'm a National Merit Scholar.

245
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,160
And it's all thanks to you.

246
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,040
No. Congratulations,
but it's got nothing to do with me.

247
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,760
Well, whatever.

248
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,280
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

249
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,480
You're here. Okay. And what do
you know about real life?

250
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
Nothing.

251
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,560
But I know what I see.

252
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,440
This is your top of the line, right?

253
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,160
Yeah, that's our deluxe model.

254
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,960
Can you absolutely, positively guarantee
that it will give me an orgasm?

255
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,240
Yeah. We stand behind our products
100 percent.

256
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,160
Good. I'll take one.

257
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,800
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. How much?

258
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,600
I don't think I can sell that to you
in good conscience.

259
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,680
You're right.

260
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,640
It's dusty.

261
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,920
Look, you're not really here just for kicks,
are you?

262
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
No.

263
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,440
-You're here to solve a problem, right?
-Yes.

264
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,680
-Sometimes, rarely or never?
-Never.

265
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Sweet Jesus.

266
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,720
So I came in here to get a thing
so I wouldn't actually have to touch myself.

267
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,360
You know, you don't have to masturbate
to have an orgasm.

268
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
You don't?

269
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,040
No, you just have to
come in the backroom with me.

270
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,400
What?

271
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,440
Oh, my God, you're propositioning me.

272
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,080
But you're a girl.

273
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,920
I mean, you're pretty and everything...

274
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,560
...but I'm married,
and I'm not like that.

275
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,080
So I think I'll just stick with the
masturbation, if that's all right with you.

276
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,200
Sorry. Thank you.

277
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,880
Don't sweat it. I took a shot.

278
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
Here's a starter kit.

279
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,760
Just get yourself in the mood.
Candles, a furry rug.

280
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,520
There you go.

281
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,960
-I'll throw this banana lube in for free.
-Thank you.

282
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
-Move the van, Wayne.
-Hold on a second.

283
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,640
All right. Okay.

284
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,600
Just listen to me for one minute, okay?
Just a second.

285
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,040
I've decided to build you a pool
at half my regular cost.

286
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,240
Whatever kind of pool you want.
Any kind of pool.

287
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Italian marble, Spanish tile, 24-karat gold,
I don't give a crap.

288
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,680
Whatever you can dream up,
at half price.

289
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,040
Why is this so important to you?

290
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,400
Why is it important?
Well, okay, it's important...

291
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,920
...because I built a pool for everybody
on your street.

292
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,240
Everybody on the next street,
everybody on the street after that...

293
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
...I built a pool for everybody except you.

294
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,280
So, what, are you trying to make
Cleveland look like California?

295
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,200
Cleveland like California,
that's pretty good.

296
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,240
-Are you in advertising?
-Yeah, something like that.

297
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,480
Good, because then maybe you can
relate to my problem. All right.

298
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,200
See, for my next commercial...

299
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,200
...I wanna do a helicopter shot
of your entire neighborhood...

300
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,080
...pool after pool after pool,
each of them mine.

301
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,880
But because of a certain
big patch of grass...

302
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,440
...in a certain somebody's backyard...

303
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,280
...I'm stuck with the same commercial
I've been running for the past 20 years.

304
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,760
You can't take that commercial off.
It's been on since I was a kid.

305
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,440
Well, that-- But that's the point.

306
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,720
It's not an accurate representation
of the current me.

307
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,120
Well, to be honest with you, Wayne,
I'm just not that big on water.

308
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,560
And besides,
I've had my heart set on a gazebo.

309
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
A gazebo? What are you, crazy?

310
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,880
You're not a gazebo girl.

311
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,520
-Yes, I am.
-No. No--

312
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,520
-Bye-bye.
-You're not a gazebo girl.

313
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,640
Takes a big man to come clean
with a story like that, man.

314
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
My heart goes out to you.

315
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,880
Well, it felt good to tell you, in a way.

316
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,280
You know...

317
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,680
...you can cry if you want to.

318
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm not much of a crier.

319
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,160
-Oh, man, crying's not pussy.
-I know that.

320
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,200
Moving into the garage is pussy.
Crying is evolved.

321
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,400
Hey, baby.

322
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,360
Hi.

323
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,040
Sure do appreciate that.

324
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,040
Now, you see,
I would never leave my wife.

325
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,560
I'd do anything in the world
for that woman.

326
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,480
-I'd do anything for Priscilla.
-Oh, not true.

327
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
All right, well, except have her
replace my dick with a piece of plastic.

328
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,000
A vibrator's not a dick replacement,
you fucking Neanderthal.

329
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,760
It's a dick teammate.

330
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,280
-What do you know about vibrators?
-I know a lot about them.

331
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,760
-How?
-Because I use one.

332
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,560
-Oh, gross.
-Oh, come on, man.

333
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,080
Me and wifey, we incorporate
a lot of technology in our marital relations.

334
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,200
And I ain't ashamed to say it.

335
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,480
Matter of fact, it's a beautiful thing
when you use it together.

336
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,160
-You use one together?
-Oh, yeah.

337
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,600
You don't think I let her use it alone?

338
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,840
So I guess Priscilla and I could--
Hadn't really thought about that.

339
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,320
And, you know, in a way,
it would be like--

340
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,440
You know, we're doing it together.
I'm there-- I'd be there.

341
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,160
-You would be there.
-Maybe you're right.

342
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,760
Only...

343
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,600
...always use it together.

344
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,520
Because a vibrator's a very
powerful thing, man.

345
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,400
Very powerful.

346
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,400
-All right.
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

347
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,160
I'm uncomfortable now.

348
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,640
How am I gonna do this?

349
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,720
Masturbation.

350
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,640
Oh, it's cold.

351
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,280
Priscilla?

352
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,320
-Priscilla!
-Jack!

353
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,120
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

354
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,600
What are you doing?

355
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,560
I did at first-- I did a few--
Oh, God, I'm coming!

356
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm coming!

357
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,920
That thing was off the scale.
It was at least a pH17.

358
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,400
That's scientifically impossible.
If you're such a science guy....

359
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Hey, Kristen, can I give you a ride?

360
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,560
Oh, no, that's cool. My dad's here.

361
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,720
You were right.

362
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm gonna fix you. Promise.

363
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,520
-<i>Binky Taylor.</i>
-Hey, Dad.

364
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,400
Yeah. All right, so I'm sleeping
at Rachel's house tonight, okay?

365
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,760
I'll do it in the morning.

366
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,440
-<i>Take care now.</i>
-All right. Good night.

367
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,160
One second.

368
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,240
-<i>Hey, Kristen.</i>
-Hey, Rachel?

369
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,360
-<i>Hey.</i>
-I'm at your house and fast asleep, okay?

370
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,720
-<i>You slut. See you.</i>
-All right. Thanks.

371
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,480
All set.

372
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,080
Are you 18?

373
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,640
You're thinking of the age of consent,
which is 16.

374
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,040
-Really?
-Yep.

375
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,840
Down it.

376
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,560
How come you never dress like that
in school?

377
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,640
Because it's school.

378
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,880
How come you dress like that for work?

379
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,760
Because it's science.

380
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,920
You like that?

381
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,920
-Yeah.
-Good.

382
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,480
Now lie down. We're gonna figure out
how you lost your way.

383
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,960
Jack?

384
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,720
Yeah?

385
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,200
Fuck the shit out of me.

386
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,160
When can I see you again?

387
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,560
-Two weeks.
-Two weeks? How come?

388
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,840
It's spring break, Jack.
I'm going to the Galápagos Islands.

389
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,600
The Galápagos Islands?

390
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,400
Who picks up
and goes to the Galápagos Islands?

391
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,800
See, Jack? You can't even imagine
life outside of your prison.

392
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,560
Escape.

393
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,440
By the way,
you have a magnificent penis.

394
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,040
There's no lifeguard on duty here,
you know.

395
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,160
I don't need a lifeguard. I'm an animal.

396
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,720
Barely <i>Homo sapien</i>.

397
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,560
Yeah? Well, I've got a mistress.

398
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480
Liar.

399
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,480
Who?

400
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,120
She has young, pillowy breasts,
and I give her giant orgasms.

401
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Young, pillowy breasts?

402
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,840
-You're screwing a student?
-Hey.

403
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,960
-You screwing a student?
-She's 18.

404
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,960
That doesn't matter.
If word gets out, you'll be ruined.

405
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,400
-Do you know I have a magnificent penis?
-Oh, shut up!

406
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,680
-No, no. I have a magnificent penis.
-Just--

407
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,360
-Just shut up!
-It's true. It's true.

408
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,400
-I'm not listening to you.
-What? You're here to hear, coach.

409
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,120
Well, hear this:

410
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,480
My cock's jamming.

411
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,160
It's jamming.

412
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,640
There you go.

413
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,160
That's it. Let's go.

414
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,920
God, please make it stop.

415
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,960
<i>On the lighter side, the Cleveland</i>

422
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Just can't do it anymore, baby.

423
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,040
It's not the way I roll.

424
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm always moving. I'm a runner.

425
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,240
And we're rolling.

426
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,320
Norwegian project, sports segment,
Jacobs Field.

427
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,520
Cue the music.

428
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,880
I am standing in Jacobs Field,
home of the Cleveland Indians...

429
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,480
...and the crown jewel in the renaissance
of Cleveland's urban landscape.

430
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,920
It is the perfect setting
to entertain clients.

00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,560

432

00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,200
Keep rolling. We got plenty of tape.

436
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,480
If Frikascis--

437
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,600
Fuck! Just give me a minute.

438
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,000
-They made this ditz a VP?
-You okay?

439
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,080
I'm just having trouble
with these consonants.

440
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,280
All right, well, maybe if you heard it.
It's Frikasch--

441
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,480
Wait.

442
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,440
-It's Frika--
-Yeah, you say it.

443
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,440
It's Frika-- Fuck. What's wrong with you?

444
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,880
I'm not frigid anymore.

445
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,600
Jack left me, for real.

446
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
What--? What do you mean, he left?

447
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,440
He took a bunch of pots
and his graphic equalizer.

448
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,440
I think he's gonna take all the crap.

449
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,520

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,720
Holy shit, you look amazing.

453
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,600
-How was the Galápagos?
-No, I mean it.

454
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,680
I'm impressed.
Such progress in two weeks.

455
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,000
And this place looks amazing.

456
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,000
It has none of the desperation
you normally associate...

457
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,720
...with a man whose marriage
has just fallen apart.

458
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,040
Did I do this?

459
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,040
-Do what?
-This apartment.

460
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,360
You.

461
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,040
<i>I'm Wayne the Pool Guy...</i>

462
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,840
<i>...and I've been installing swimming pools</i>
<i>in the Greater Cleveland area since 1976.</i>

463
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,160
<i>Our service is classy,</i>
<i>and the pools are definitely splashy.</i>

464
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,760
<i>Oh, Wayne. Come on in, the water's fine.</i>

465
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,560
Now, why would you wanna
change that?

466
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,480
<i>That water is fine.</i>

467
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,040
Yes, the water is fine.

468
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,160
So how do you make me
feel so good down there?

469
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,160
Okay.

470
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,080
Where does the female orgasm occur?

471
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,320
-The clitoris.
-No.

472
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,360
You and the rest of the world are wrong.

473
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,840
The female orgasm actually occurs
in the pubococcygeus muscle.

474
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,720
-No way.
-Yeah. Way.

475
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,080
P-U-B-O-C-O-C-C-Y-G-E-U-S?

476
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,960
I don't know. Yeah, something like that.

477
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,760
Where is it?

478
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,960
I wish I had a blackboard. I would--

479
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,600
It's the muscle
that surrounds the entire vagina.

480
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,960
I thought there were no nerve endings
in the vagina.

481
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,080
There aren't, but the pubococcygeus
has millions of nerve endings...

482
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,160
...and they're just outside
the vaginal walls.

483
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,720
-So it's easily stimulated.
-Exactly.

484
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,080
That is so cool.

485
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,760
Yeah. Now, I'm not saying that clitoral
stimulation can't produce an orgasm.

486
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,880
Absolutely, it can.

487
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,960
But until you've had an involuntary
contraction of the pubococcygeus...

488
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,240
...then you've never really had an orgasm.

489
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,760
-You swear this is true?
-Yes, absolutely true.

490
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,760
-Do you know what this means?
-No, what does it mean?

491
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,400
It means an end to the tyranny
of the clitoral orgasm.

492
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,360
You have to teach this in class tomorrow.

493
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,880
Okay, if it means that much to you.

494
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,800
Charles Darwin went to the Galápagos
in what year?

495
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,920
-1835.
-That's right, 1835.

496
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,600
And he went on a boat called...?

497
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,840
-Miss Overmyer.
-The <i>HMS Beagle</i>, like Snoopy.

498
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,280
That's right, the <i>HMS Beagle</i>.

499
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,520
Not to be confused with the <i>HMS Bagel</i>.

500
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,160
That's a much lesser-known boat that sunk
because it had a hole in it. Yeah.

501
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,520
All right, now get out of my classroom,
you jerks.

502
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,040
-You made a promise and you broke it.
-What?

503
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
You know what.

504
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,720
I'm sorry, I didn't think the pubococcygeus
was a suitable topic for--

505
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Kids?

506
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,840
-I don't-- Why is this a big deal?
-Because it is.

507
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,440
All right, I'll never mention it again.

508
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,040
You know what? I don't think there's
any such thing as the pubococcygeus.

509
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,120
I think you made it up to be fascinating
to your teenage girlfriend.

510
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,960
How could I make up "pubococcygeus"?

511
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,400
I want documented scientific proof.

512
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,400
And no "Playboy Advisor" bullshit.

513
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,280
All right.

514
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,240
I heard about panties with
a miniature vibrator built right into them.

515
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,120
-Do you carry those?
-Yeah.

516
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,920
Oh, good. I want seven pairs,
one for each day of the week.

517
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,920
And do they come in different colors,
for organizational purposes?

518
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,640
-Can I ask you a question?
-Shoot.

519
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,720
Roughly speaking, how many times
have you come in the past few weeks?

520
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,240
One-hundred and eighty-nine times,
exactly speaking.

521
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,520
That's 13 and a half per day.

522
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,000
I've seen this before.
I know how this is gonna sound...

523
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,480
...but I'm not making it up. I think
that you're addicted to your vibrator.

524
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,240
-What?
-You're clinically addicted to your vibrator...

525
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,840
-...or pretty close.
-I can't believe you're saying this.

526
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,040
It happens to a lot of women
with a long history of sexual dysfunction.

527
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,480
One taste and they're gone.

528
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,120
-But I've never felt so good in my life.
-I bet.

529
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,760
They meet Mondays and Wednesdays
at St. Mary's on 33rd Street.

530
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,320
In a church?

531
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,080
Oh, I thought I turned this thing off.

532
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,920
Wonder if this'll work.

Fuck.

537
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,720
You've been distracted lately.

538
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,640
Well, I'm not now.

539
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,720
I hope not.

-Yeah?

541
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,040
Frikaskjasalde.

542

Come on.

543
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,840
Unbelievable.

544
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,720

God.

551
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,280
Hey, hon. Yeah, it's me.

552
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,680
Look, I'm gonna have
to break into the house...

553
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,640
...because you changed
the fucking locks.

554
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,800
So, I don't know,
I might just burn it down.

555
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,360
Okay, hugs.

556
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,400
Here she is.

557
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,080
-Fridtjof Knudsen, this is Priscilla.
-Sure. Sir, yes.

558
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,640
-It's so great to finally meet you.
-The pleasure is entirely mine.

559
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,520
Good. So now we get down to business.

560
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,040
Persuade us to move
from one frigid city to another one.

561
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,440
If Frikaskjasalde should
decide to relocate to Cleveland...

562
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,560
...Trasker will provide
the expertise necessary...

563
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,000
...to cut your current costs by one-third.

564
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,640
What about infrastructure grants?

00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,520
...would go so far
as to build you new roads.

00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,000
She doesn't look well. Are you well?

575
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,760
I'm fine.

576
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,440
Oh, God. I'm fine.

The land.

581
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,840
The land. Yeah.

582
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,520
Yeah. God.

583
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,320
Priscilla, what's wrong?

584
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,040
I'm fine. I'm fine.

585
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,440
She's been under a hell of a lot
of stress lately.

586
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,240
Don't talk to me about stress.

587
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,320
Oh, no, it's not stress. It's just....

588
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,360
Some bad Chinese food.

589
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,920
Sizzling garlic beef.

590
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,160
Anyway...

591
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,680
...let's get started.

592
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,280
-Douglas--
-They signed.

593
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,120
Oh, good. I'm so sorry.

594
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,440
I don't know what happened.

595
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,760
It wasn't sizzling garlic beef.

596
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,880
I don't know what it was.
But it won't happen again, I swear.

597
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Well, just remember, you can only
get away with this kind of bullshit once.

598
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,160
You can only get away
with that kind of bullshit once.

599
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,880
Jack.

600
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,240
Jack.

601
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,600
Jack.

602
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,720
He finally did it.

603
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,760
Finally fucking did it.

604
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,960
Breaking and entering.

605
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,720
-We are so cool.
-Oh, I know.

606
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,480
-Wow, eerie.
-Totally.

607
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,400
I feel like I could tell you anything.

608
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,200
You can tell me anything.

609
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,360
That's what's great about us.

610
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,160
You know this means
we're a couple now.

611
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,000
Awesome.

612
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,040
Okay, new rules.

613
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,560
One, keep your options open
till the last second.

614
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,200
Two, get his number.
But that's flexible if he's a fox.

615
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,920
Three, look at your left hand.

616
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,240
What about it?

617
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,720
Check the ring finger. You know, the one
with the wedding ring on it?

618
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,640
-It comes off.
-All the way.

619
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,760
Feel lighter?

620
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,760
-A little.
-Good.

621
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,480
Tonight I'm your designated dancer.

622
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,840
I will protect you, I will advise you...

623
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,360
...and I will never leave your side.

624
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,160
Did you have your orgasm?

625
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,760
So, baby, how many times?

626
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,320
-You okay with that or...?
-Were my techniques sufficient enough...

627
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,960
...to provide you
with the orgasm you were seeking?

628
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,520
Orgasm? Of course I fucking did.

629
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,920
I don't know what happened.

630
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,840
I try too hard. I just freeze up.

631
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,080
Look, I know it's not the girl thing.
You were close like five times.

632
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,160
-You were this close.
-Six.

633
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,680
-Really?
-It's a joke.

634
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,680
You know I pride myself
on my orgasm-inducing abilities?

635
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,760
I've practiced. I dedicated myself.

636
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,320
I can make an ice sculpture
of Kathie Lee Gifford come.

637
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,560
I don't know how your husband
plugged away as long as he did.

638
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,240
Exhausted.

639
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,480
No way. Impossible.

640
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,880
I don't believe it.

641
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,800
You're lying. You have to be lying...

642
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,920
...because there's no way
you would ever do that, right?

643
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,080
Right?

644
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,440
-Which part?
-That last part.

645
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,400
That last part just happened.

646
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,640
So you just kind of slipped
and fell into her vagina.

647
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,160
-Sherri.
-Did you think she was a man or something?

648
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,440
No. She's a fox.

649
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,560
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I just said that.

650
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,000
So you actively and knowingly
pursued your lesbian moment?

651
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,800
Think you'll do it again?

652
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,720
I'm sorry...

653
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,920
...but I feel like I really need
to speak my mind on this one.

654
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,560
Not now, Sherri.

655
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,360
You are...

656
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,280
-...awesome.
-What?

657
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,520
You are fucking awesome.

658
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,480
I mean, a month ago,
you were this uptight, frigid, married chick.

659
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,000
And then, from clear out of the blue...

660
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,240
...you dumped your loser husband
because he wasn't plowing the fields.

661
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,440
You're not listening.
That's not how it happened.

662
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,720
And then you practically invent
a whole new category of addiction.

663
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,720
They should name
a warning sticker after you.

664
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,960
And then you go on to bag
all of these hot guys...

665
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,760
...one after the other after the other...

666
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,880
-...after the other.
-Sherri.

667
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,400
And then, when most of us
would be taking a breather...

668
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,120
...you run off and join the lesbian circus.

669
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,640
-Sherri.
-No, it's so incredibly rich.

670
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,280
Priscilla, you are a goddess.

671
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,840
You are a raging slut goddess.

672
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,520
Sherri.

673
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,440
You didn't listen
to a word I said, did you?

674
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,160
You know all those guys I slept with?

675
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,760
I wasn't even there when it happened.

676
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,840
I just disappeared into this ball of fear.

677
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,760
I just shut down.

678
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,320
None of them wanna see me again.

679
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,960
And you know Justine, my girlfriend?

680
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,520
She says that I'm an ice queen.

681
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,280
An unmeltable ice queen.

682
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,680
Just once in my life,
just for one minute...

683
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,600
...I would like to let go...

684
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,560
...just to feel different...

685
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,440
...if only for a minute.

686
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,280
<i>Hello, Priscilla. You were supposed</i>
<i>to have those numbers on my desk by 5.</i>

687
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,920
-Oh, Christ.
-<i>It's now 6:30...</i>

688
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,120
<i>...and I'm still waiting here at my desk.</i>

689
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,800
<i>I want them first thing in the morning.</i>
<i>Good night, Priscilla.</i>

690
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,440
<i>Hey, Priscilla, it's me,</i>
<i>Wayne the Pool Guy.</i>

691
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,840
-Hi. How you doing? Good.
-Hi. Good.

692
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,920
I would like a piece of your chocolate cake
and a glass of red wine.

693
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,440
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh, and some milk as well. Thank you.

694
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,480
I finally caught you.

695
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,360
You're not gonna believe this.
I think I'm finally ready for that pool.

696
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,720
-Would you like to sit down and join me?
-You're kidding me.

697
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,640
-Dinner's on me. Scotch, rocks.
-Okay.

698
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,720
So, Priscilla...

699
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,840
-...why do you want a pool?
-Now you wanna talk me out of it?

700
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,360
No, no, it's just that, you know,
even at half price, it's:

701
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,960
I'm paying full price.

702
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,440
Even at my special
summer-discount rate...

703
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,040
...it's gonna put a deep dent
in your pocketbook.

704
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,880
So I want you to be sure.
If you don't want a pool, don't get a pool.

705
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,720
-But what about your commercial?
-We already shot it.

706
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,280
Yeah. They put a pool in your backyard
with a computer.

707
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,680
Looks real.
It's gonna premiere next week.

708
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,240
What about the old one?

709
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,680
Well.... Yeah, well, I think it aired
for the last time about an hour ago.

710
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,520
I missed it.

711
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,000
-I'll send you a tape.
-Thanks, but it won't be the same.

712
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,880
Yeah. Thank you.

713
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,280
Well, <i>salud</i>.

714
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,840
There are three reasons
why people get a pool.

715
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,320
One, to keep up with the Joneses.

716
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,800
Two, if you can believe this...

717
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,040
...to get people to come to their house.

718
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,320
And the third reason...

719
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,360
...I want you to tell me.

720
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,280
Come on, come on.

721
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,040
-Swimming?
-Bingo.

722
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,880
That's it. Swimming.

723
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,360
Nobody ever gets that.
It's the most obvious.

724
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,400
And it's the most meaningful.

725
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,360
What do you mean by that?

726
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Well, all right, forget I'm a salesman
for a second.

727
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,280
Just a second. All right.

728
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,120
Emotionally and spiritually speaking...

729
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,680
...swimming is the best thing
you can do for yourself.

730
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,200
You wanna know why?

731
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,680
Metamorphosis.

732
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,560
Even in Cleveland, Ohio...

733
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,120
...you have a chance at rebirth
every time you dive in the water.

734
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,400
But what if you wanna stay
who you are?

735
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,960
What kind of question is that?

736
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,520
Everybody wants to change.

737
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,400
-Oh, really?
-Of course.

738
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,120
-Don't they?
-I'm just giving you a hard time.

739
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,680
You see that? You try to be sincere...

740
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,240
-...and all you get is grief.
-I was kidding.

741
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,280
I was kidding.
I'm very pro-metamorphosis.

742
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,760
Sucker.

743
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,000
No, you meant every word.

744
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,520
-Here you go.
-Good.

745
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,120
There you are.

746
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,120
Nice combo.

747
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,840
Anyway...

748
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:18,320
...to be honest, I think I should
try someone else's pool first.

749
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,280
I have a pool.

750
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,600
Is that an invitation?

751
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,560
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
it's an invitation, yeah.

752
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,760
When?

753
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,440
Watch your step here. Yes.

754
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,160
-All this for building pools.
-Yeah.

755
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,640
Yeah. You ready?

756
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,200
Check it.

757
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,920
Oh, my God.

758
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,320
Yeah.

759
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,760
I built it for my wife.

760
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,280
She died 16 years ago.

761
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,400
She must have loved it.

762
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,320
She had her moods.
She would be crying at the top...

763
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:17,560
...and laughing by the time
she hit the pool. Yeah. Yeah.

764
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,640
-So you like it? Really?
-Oh, yeah. I think it's a--

765
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,640
-I think it's amazing.
-You wanna try it?

766
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,000
-Now?
-Yeah.

767
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
-Will you come with me?
-No.

768
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,200
-No?
-No.

769
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:34,400
No. No, I don't ever. I never do. Never do.

770
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,200
Wayne, when was the last time
you went swimming in this pool?

771
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,080
It's been a while.

772
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,760
So all that talk about metamorphosis
and renewal...

773
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,120
...it was just talk?

774
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,600
I have suits inside.

775
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,240
-Okay.
-Let's go.

776
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,320
Come on. I think I have one that fits you.

777
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,200
It's my favorite. I wear it--
When I'm all alone, I wear it.

778
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,240
No, I'm only kidding.

779
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,800
It's wood. Nice. Sturdy.
It's like a tree house.

780
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,600
How high is it?

781
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,800
The slide is 300 feet, so....

782
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,840
And then this is, you know....

783
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,080
-You go first and I'll spot you.
-Okay.

784
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,880
Wow, this....

785
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,400
Yeah, I forgot all about this.

786
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,040
Wow, the Terminal Tower.
That's where I work.

787
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
What do you actually do in advertising?

788
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,680
I bring business to Cleveland.

789
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,600
-That's a cool job.
-Yeah, it is.

790
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,840
I like it.

791
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,560
-I'm really glad I came.
-Me too.

792
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,600
We can't stay up here all night.

793
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,800
Anyway, let me get....

794
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,840
All right.

795
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,880
-Okay?
-Okay.

796
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,040
All right, so you go on it.

797
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,760
Okay, get down...

798
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,400
...and then, let's see....

799
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:51,680
I'm gonna get over here like this. Yeah.

800
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,400
Ready? Put your legs around me.

801
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,000
Okay, all right.

802
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,000
And hold on to my waist, right?

803
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,800
Okay, yeah.

804
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,760
-You can hold on. I won't break.
-Okay.

805
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,600
Okay.

806
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,880
-Ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

807
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,680
One, two...

808
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,400
...three!

809
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,200
I'm sorry.

810
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,480
No. More.

811
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,640
Don't worry, I'm gonna be okay.

812
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,920
What's so funny?

813
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,680
Well, you're not gonna believe this...

814
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,880
...but you're the first man who's ever...

815
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,960
...you know, made me come.

816
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,880
You mean, you...?

817
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,920
Not until Wayne.

818
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,160
Wayne the Pool Guy.

819
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,280
Yeah, that is funny.

820
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,320
Hysterical.

821
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,480
Well, you just took 15 years off my life.

822
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,040
Now, come here.

823
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,760
Oh, Wayne.

824
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,280
Oh, Wayne. Wayne.

825
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,240
What a name.

826
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,920
You should keep your slide on
all the time.

827
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,640
How come?

828
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,920
Because then I'd come over.

829
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,320
Get your own pool.

830
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,040
-Good morning.
-Priscilla.

831
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,520
No sizzling garlic beef
this weekend, I see.

832
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,160
I guess you already know.

833
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,320
Know what?

834
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,880
We're taking a group of Chinese brewers
on a tour this morning.

835
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,080
-Can you handle it?
-I don't think so.

836
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,800
Guess what they wanna see.

837
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,720
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

838
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,080
You wish.

839
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,560
They wanna see the crown jewel
of Cleveland's public school system:

840
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,480
Carmen High.

841
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,760
Jack's back.

842
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,160
Morning.

843
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,600
You motherfuckers ready to learn?

844
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,680
Because I'm gonna
teach the shit out of you.

845
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,280
-Yeah!
-All right.

846
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,800
You guys are gonna be cool, right?
You're not gonna tell the principal I swore?

847
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,360
Miss Taylor's not here, I see.
All right.

848
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,280
We had very high SAT scores last year....

849
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,920
Come on. I know there's
something you wanna tell me.

850
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,280
No, there isn't.

851
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,160
You have a big, juicy secret.

852
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,920
I can smell it.

853
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,280
-Me and Wayne the Pool Guy.
-Liar.

854
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,760
And another archaebacteria that can
survive in inhospitable environments...

855
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,520
...is the halobacteria...

856
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,320
...which is unique...

857
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,520
-...because of its pigment.
-They're educating.

858
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,920
And who could tell me what that is?

859
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,000
It's the color?

860
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,960
Holy shit. Look at him.

861
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,400
That's right, but maybe one of our
esteemed guests here would know.

862
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,920
-The color is orange?
-That's right.

863
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,800
Goes the little bear.

864
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,400
One chop, two chop, tickle under....

865
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,120
That felt so good.

866
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,880
Yeah, that's what I always
try to tell myself.

867
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,280
Feel good. Don't feel bad, feel good.

868
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,040
Pizza and a six-pack.

869
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,720
Oh, it's so late though.

870
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,560
So?

871
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,120
Okay. I'll have a plain.

872
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,440
Cool. Plain?

873
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,120
No, I'll have sausage and onions.

874
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,400
Very brave.

875
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,520
You worried that I'm
falling in love with you?

876
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,560
If I were, I wouldn't be here.

877
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,600
-<i>Bertino's Pizzeria.</i>
-Gonna be open late?

878
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,680
-<i>Yeah, we're open late.</i>
-I'll be there in two hours.

879
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,080
Hey, Jack.

880
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,840
Hey. I bet you can't catch me.

881
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,720
-Hey.
-Excuse me. Sorry.

882
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,960
Hey, I know you. Wait.

883
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,080
You're Jack Chase.
You're my daughter's teacher.

884
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,400
I'm Binky Taylor,
Kristen Taylor's father.

885
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:32,000
Kristen Tay-- Oh, Kristen.

886
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,400
Yeah. Oh, she's very bright.

887
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,720
The Taylor family...

888
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,840
...will be eternally grateful to you.

889
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,360
It was your class that got
Kristen off the cannabis...

890
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,360
...and onto the right track.

891
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,160
Here she is.

892
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,440
Hi, Dad. Hello, Mr. Chase.

893
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,400
Kristen.

894
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,480
Shouldn't you be
doing your homework?

895
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,520
I don't know about that.
Kristen's going to Harvard.

896
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,800
Harvard, the school?

897
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,240
She hasn't taken that Harvard T-shirt off
for three weeks since she got the news.

898
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,520
Congratulations, Kristen.

899
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,320
It takes a very special person
to get into Harvard.

900
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,320
No, Mr. Chase.
Congratulations to you.

901
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,920
If this country
had more teachers like you...

902
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,040
...dedicated, decent men,
our kids would be in a lot better shape.

903
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,200
You, sir, are an everyday hero.

904
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,040
-Thank you.
-No. Thank you.

905
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,800
Say thank you.

906
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,040
Thank you, Mr. Chase.

907
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,640
You're a great teacher.

908
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,520
Alrighty. Well, take care.

909
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,120
Okay, now.

910
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,760
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

911
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,520
<i>It was great seeing you</i>
<i>the other day.</i>

912
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,840
<i>I was thinking that maybe we could</i>
<i>hook up sometime and grab some dinner.</i>

913
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
<i>Nothing serious or anything.</i>
<i>Just, you know, to catch up.</i>

914
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,560
<i>Whenever you want.</i>
<i>Just let me know.</i>

915
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,080
That suit is ridiculous.

916
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,400
Oh, yeah.

917
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,360
Damn, he looks good.

918
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,120
Hi.

919
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,440
Hi.

920
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,640
I'm starving.

921
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,840
So, what have you been up to?

922
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,480
Oh, I don't know.

923
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,160
Not much.

924
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,680
No?

925
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,920
You can tell me, you know. It's me.

926
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,920
Well...

927
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,760
...I've been broadening my horizons...

928
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,280
...taking some seminars...

929
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,960
...and discovering parts of Cleveland
I never knew existed.

930
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,120
Neat.

931
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,720
Well, here's to you.

932
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,080
The hell is that?

933
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,040
Shit.

934
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,880
I'm involved in a love triangle
with a younger, fitter rival.

935
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,560
This is bullshit.

936
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,920
What about you?
What have you been doing?

937
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,760
What have I been doing?

938
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,520
Probably sounds pretentious...

939
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,200
...but I've been trying to make myself
a better man.

940
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,680
Oh, good for you.

941
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,640
Yeah.

942
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,000
I've been really focused
on teaching...

943
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,720
...and, I don't know, I'm thinking about
maybe going back to school.

944
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,360
I'm so proud of you.
That's wonderful.

945
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,240
Here's to you.

946
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,360
Thank you.

947
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,560
-It's great to see you.
-You too.

948
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,120
Oh, and also, every morning...

949
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:02,000
...I've been getting up and exercising.

950
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,800
A lot of jogging
and that kind of thing.

951
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,280
I've lost six pounds already.

952
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,880
You look like you lost more.

953
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,800
I haven't weighed myself today, so....

954
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,080
Thank you.

955
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:31,800
It must be driving you crazy
wondering why I brought you here, huh?

956
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I've been thinking that maybe--

957
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,240
Are you listening to me?
Because this is important.

958
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,440
-I mean, this--
-Yeah, I'm listening.

959
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,840
This is--

960
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,120
What's so funny?

961
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,400
Nothing.

962
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,840
I've been thinking that maybe...

963
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,880
...we should get back together.

964
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,520
Oh, Jack.

965
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,800
Well, here's to you.

966
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,400
-Good to see you.
-You too.

967
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,320
A gazebo? What are you, crazy?

968
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,400
You're not a gazebo girl.

969
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,280
A touch of the bubbly.

970
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,920
I wanna go again.

971
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,160
Here, hold on just a second.

972
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,760
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

973
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,840
Listen, I was thinking.

974
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,680
Even though there's this big
age difference between us--

975
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,160
How old are you, anyway?

976
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,840
Old.

977
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,120
Somehow, while I was worried about
drains and chlorine...

978
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,120
...I turned into the old guy, but--

979
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,160
Here. The thing is, I don't have anybody
to leave my business to.

980
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,520
I mean, when I kick,
when the ticker goes, that's it.

981
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,880
I can find you a buyer
within a week, Wayne.

982
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,920
-A reputable buyer.
-Yeah, well....

983
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,360
But I was thinking that,
even with all our differences...

984
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,000
-...we make a good team.
-Yeah.

985
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,560
You like to stay up late.

986
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,000
Nope. Early bird.

987
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,120
Okay.

988
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,800
All right,
maybe it's not the sleep thing.

989
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,360
Well, there's the sex.

990
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,760
The sex. Yes, the sex. Jesus Christ.

991
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,640
Really wonderful.

992
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,080
And you gotta know...

993
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,360
...I haven't been in this pool
since my wife died.

994
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,240
Anyway, considering
all these ingredients...

995
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,560
...and that you've got
a great head for business...

996
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,840
...and the fact that I might be
falling in love with you...

997
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
-...I was wondering--
-Are you gonna ask me to marry you?

998
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,760
Actually...

999
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,680
...I was gonna ask you
if you would be my girlfriend.

1000
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,760
-I'll think about it.
-Okay.
