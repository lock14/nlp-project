00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,045
Elizabeth.

3
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:12,220
- How long was I out?
- About six minutes.

4
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:13,576
Thanks.

5
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:17,537
- OK. I'll be right there.
- OK, I'll be outside. Hey, Fran.

6
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,559
Hey, what are you still doing here?

7
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,582
- How long you been on?
- Twenty-three.

8
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:25,980
Twenty-three?
Time to go, Elizabeth.

9
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:28,481
That's not gonna get me
an attending slot.

10
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:31,908
Adams? She needs to know
how to redress her sutures.

11
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:35,644
No, no. Ellis needs an EKG.
I don't like these swollen ankles.

12
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:36,520
- All right.
- Thanks.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,482
Oh. Hey. I took care of Trauma Two
while you were sleeping.

14
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:41,317
- I wasn't sleeping. I was just...
- You're welcome.

15
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,224
You're on in five and eight.

16
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:49,970
Jenny? You seen Jenny?

17
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,033
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

18
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:55,646
Hi, Mr. Clark.
I'm Dr. Masterson.

19
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:58,224
We're gonna need a CBC,
lytes and a UA.

20
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:01,058
Anything I can do to make you
feel more comfortable today?

21
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:03,126
- Marry me?
- Wow.

22
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:06,003
Oh, I have my own bus pass.

23
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:07,512
Well, then how could I refuse?

24
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:10,965
Let me just call my sister and see if
I can borrow her dress. Okay? You sit tight.

25
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,542
Keep an eye on my fiance
and must decrease his morphine drip.

26
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:19,504
Doing OK?

27
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:24,841
Clear bed four.

28
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,080
Sir, you wanna step over...

29
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:36,141
I got it. I got it.

30
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:37,523
I got it.

31
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,837
- I was just about to...
- You're welcome.

32
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,800
Thank you.

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,236
You have UTI progressing into infection.
Pneumonia. Diabetic coma.

34
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:03,563
<i>Una problema con sus rlñones.</i>

35
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:06,590
I'll have a Venti, triple-shot,
sugar-free, vanilla, non-fat cappuccino.

36
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:11,879
- Doctor.
- Mr. Clark?

37
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,321
Will you marry me?

38
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:16,608
Of course, Mr. Clark. But first,
we need to find you a robe. Jenny?

39
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,017
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

40
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,001
Going full Kabuki tonight, Fran?

41
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,962
I found the dark circles
were scaring the patients.

42
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,664
And she's got a hot date tonight.

43
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,511
Oh, stop! I'm going out to dinner
with my ex and his mother.

44
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,147
He still hasn't told her
we're divorced,

45
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:35,164
and I don't wanna be responsible for killing
an 80-year-old woman.

46
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:36,533
Well, I'll trade nights with you.

47
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,757
I've gotta go home and sew
six caterpillar costumes

48
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:41,552
with Velcro legs
for Katie's dance class.

49
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:43,794
I don't know
how you guys do it.

50
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:47,732
Nick is totally pushing me for kids.
I don't even have time to shave my legs.

51
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:50,215
- Stop shaving. He'll leave you alone.
- Really?

52
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:53,518
Elizabeth, you're so lucky that all
you have to worry about is work.

53
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:05,238
- Dr. Masterson, are you in there?
- Yeah, I'll be right out.

54
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:09,565
- Ankle in bed two.
- OK, there's no fracture.

55
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,025
Just wrap it up
and send him home. Thanks.

56
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,545
- Hello?
- Are you really coming?

57
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,662
Yes, I'm coming.

58
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:17,924
Good. Because this guy is great.

59
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,690
You met him? Is he there?

60
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,059
I haven't actually
met him in person.

61
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,770
Okay, Abby, you're not setting me up
with a complete stranger.

62
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,304
He's a friend of an old friend.
He's really nice.

63
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:30,541
Oh, no.  What does that mean,
fat with a good sense of humor?

64
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,617
Not again, Abby.

65
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:33,743
Look.  It wasn't easy
to get this guy to come.

66
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:36,863
He doesn't do this kind of thing, either.
Do you girls have to do that here?

67
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:40,842
Do we not have six other rooms
in the house? Help Mommy out here.

68
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:43,300
I'm in the seventh circle of hell.
You'd better show up.

69
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,203
I'm going to be there.
I'm just really busy tonight.

70
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:48,313
Don't you dare say you're busy.
You don't know the meaning of the word "busy."

71
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:51,707
I'm doing you this huge favor here.
Beggars can't be choosers, Elizabeth.

72
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,509
I am completely capable
of meeting men on my own.

73
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:59,236
I know, honey. I'd just like you
to meet one who's not bleeding.

74
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:01,762
I've already had
two marriage proposals today.

75
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,649
- Marry me.
- Yes, Mr. Clark.

76
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,847
Yes, of course.
Make that three.

77
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,822
- Okay, I'll see you at seven.
- It is seven.

78
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:09,914
Thirty. 7:30.
What are you making?

79
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:12,692
Lasagna. Mom's recipe.
No carbohydrate comments.

80
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,909
Please. I'm going on a day and a half
of cafeteria salad. Anything will do.

81
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,520
Who put SpongeBob in the pasta?

82
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,613
I gotta go.

83
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,514
So, what are you gonna do?

84
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,705
The only other option is, you know, Phoenix.

85
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:27,375
- Would you consider it?
- Phoenix, San Francisco.

86
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:32,111
Old people and melanomas versus
great sushi and desperate women.

87
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,487
You don't get it.  Walsh likes you.

88
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:36,189
Dr. Walsh. Gunshot victim,
internal hemorrhaging.

89
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:39,151
- How long have you been here?
- Twelve hours.

90
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:40,245
A few more.

91
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,364
- All right, Brett.
- I'll scrub up.

92
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,156
Elizabeth.

93
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:50,802
Yes, sir.

94
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:52,869
I was going to wait till tomorrow,

95
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,848
but I wanted to let you know
that I've made my decision.

96
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:59,590
I want you to stay on
as an attending physician.

97
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,041
Really? Thank you.

98
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,419
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you, Dr. Walsh.

99
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,694
You've earned it.

100
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:07,931
Unlike some others,
you spend more time being concerned

101
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:10,431
with what's best for the patient
than kissing my ass.

102
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,416
A risky move, but I like it.

103
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,661
Sir, I can't thank you enough
for this opportunity.

104
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:19,247
There's so much I want to do here.
I can't wait to get started.

105
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:20,623
- Elizabeth?
- Yes?

106
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:24,408
The only thing I need you
to do right now is go home.

107
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:26,618
- But, sir, I... I have...
- Go.

108
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,395
You've been here 26 hours.

109
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:30,740
I know all.

110
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,457
- Dr. Masterson.
- Yeah?

111
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:53,620
I have a bowel obstruction in six.

112
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,456
At least, I think that's what it is.
Can you take a quick peek?

113
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:58,964
Yeah, of course.

114
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:07,453
- Brett.
- Congratulations.

115
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,796
Thank you. I didn't know
Walsh was gonna...

116
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,706
I have an offer in Phoenix.
Life's good.

117
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:14,091
That's great. That's great.

118
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:14,842
It's fine.

119
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:23,121
- Hey, Abby, it's me.
- Hey.

120
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:25,049
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know, but I'm on my way.

121
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:28,485
- Don't worry. Your date's late too.
- Listen. I have good news.

122
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:32,096
I got the attending position.
I'm staying in San Francisco.

123
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:34,988
Oh, that's great!
Well, get over here.

124
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,447
- We're breakin' out the champagne.
- I'll be there in a minute. Bye.

125
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:54,761
This place is heaven.

126
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:01,015
It's been photographed
for magazines.

127
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,936
Yeah. I think I told you I was
gonna need something furnished.

128
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:09,336
Well, it is furnished.

129
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:11,255
Where's the couch?

130
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:19,160
Do you believe all of this space?

131
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,898
Yeah, it's great
for all those raves I'll be throwing.

132
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,959
I'm... sensing a "no."

133
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:32,777
Wow, huh?

134
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:36,071
I know. This place
isn't usually available,

135
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:39,064
but the couple's spending all their time
in Palm Springs now.

136
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:20,754
David, I'm just not quite sure
what you're looking for.

137
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,228
Maybe if we could
communicate a little more.

138
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:25,231
Maybe if you could just
let me know a bit more

139
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,591
about what's going on with you,
with your job, with your family situation.

140
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:32,185
- Yeah.  I don't wanna talk about that.
- OK.  Now here's another idea:

141
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:35,136
Maybe you should stop looking for a couple
of months to a new start again,

142
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:37,563
because you've gotta know
where you wanna live.

143
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,330
You know I just... I'm... I'm not...

144
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,991
...getting what it is you...

145
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:45,695
Hey, well... no. David.

146
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,129
David, are you kidding?

147
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,337
Wait, David. Look, come on.

148
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:52,340
Wait.  A place like this,
it is long gone by now.

149
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,516
No, listen.  There's 90 vultures
and just one carcass.

150
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:58,762
All right, fine. I'll call them.

151
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:02,847
He did? OK.

152
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,492
Well, right.
As soon as I know.

153
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:07,274
Thank you so much for your help.

154
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:12,187
Well, it's pretty obvious
why this hasn't rented.

155
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:15,324
Oh, there's no one-year lease.
It's a month-to-month sublet.

156
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,058
- Why?
- Some family matter.

157
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:19,868
They were pretty
close-mouthed about it.

158
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,954
Wow, what a view.

159
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,082
David.

160
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,718
Wow.

161
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:49,363
This is... sensational.

162
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:54,233
Oh, my God.
And it's got the private access?

163
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,693
They didn't do much with it,

164
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,583
but, I mean, you really
could do something with this.

165
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,196
Isn't this gorgeous?

166
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:16,258
Well, there's a few places
in the Richmond we haven't hit yet.

167
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,727
I like the couch.

168
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:18,928
The couch.

169
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,362
Good couch.

170
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,822
Good couch.

171
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,798
David. David, come here.

172
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,950
- What? What?
- There's nothing worth stealing here.

173
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,212
- There's no money.  There's no drugs.
- I'm not stealing anything.

174
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:12,202
OK. I'm sure there's
a homeless shelter nearby.

175
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,378
I will give you money
for cab fare and a good meal.

176
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:16,762
But please, don't blow it
on more beer, OK?

177
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:19,405
I am not homeless. I live here.

178
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,635
OK. You can't live here,
because I live here.

179
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:24,776
This is my apartment.

180
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,528
- Since when?
- Since I rented it.

181
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:28,904
- You rented it.
- Yeah.

182
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,938
- You know what? I don't need this.
- What?

183
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:34,064
- Rent scam, right?
- What are you talking about?

184
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:37,942
Don't you get it.  There's probably five other people
who paid deposits and got the keys.

185
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:39,420
And moved in all their things?

186
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,122
Yeah... What?

187
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:42,480
This is my stuff. All of this.

188
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,157
That's my couch.
That's my coffee table.

189
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:46,457
Is that a ring?

190
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:48,600
Have you ever heard
of a coaster?

191
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,902
Or a trash can, for that matter?

192
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:54,154
I don't care who you are.  You're gonna
mop that up. I'm getting the bucket.

193
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:56,863
It's like a pig
moved into my house.

194
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,332
- What?
- Like a filthy pig.

195
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,335
You... You moved in when?

196
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,303
Hello?

197
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,707
- I told you to get out.
- Jesus!

198
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,546
OK. So, what's this all about?

199
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,588
What? Nothin'.

200
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:57,597
Nothin'.

201
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,032
So, you called me for nothin'?

202
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:01,875
I've been sort of
seeing someone.

203
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,126
Seeing someone?
That's what I'm talkin' about. Finally.

204
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:08,188
- You think it's a good thing?
- Absolutely.

205
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,610
Yeah. I mean the last time I tried
to hook you up, you bailed out of it.

206
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,061
And this is good, and the fact
that you initiated it yourself.

207
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,364
That's important. OK?
Now, who is she? Do I know her?

208
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:19,897
I mean I'm seeing someone
that's not there.

209
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,699
She's emotionally unavailable?

210
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,870
You mean like a hallucination.

211
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:31,056
Twice, in my apartment.

212
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,665
A woman.

213
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:33,707
Attractive?

214
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,724
- Not really there, Jack.
- Right. Right. OK.

215
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:40,986
So when you saw this woman,
were you drunk?

216
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,863
I mean, I had a little buzz.

217
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,790
Dave, don't lie to me.
It doesn't help.

218
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,674
OK, fine, I was wasted.

219
00:14:48,674 --> 00:14:52,001
But still, I shouldn't be seeing
some little blonde control freak

220
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:53,345
running around my apartment.

221
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:56,563
Why are you writing this down?
This isn't a session.

222
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:00,866
That's insulting, OK? I'm your friend
Jack here, I'm not charging you.

223
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,301
But if this thing rolls
into a second hour

224
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:06,145
we're gonna have to work out
some kind of deal. I'm kidding.

225
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:06,822
I'm kidding.

226
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,029
All right. So, hold on a second.
You were drunk.

227
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,791
- You saw this blonde, controlling...
- I gotta stop drinkin'.

228
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,525
- No.
- No?

229
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:17,553
Yeah, drink, party.
Just do it with other people.

230
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:20,472
God gave us alcohol
as a social lubricant.

231
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:22,788
Make men brave;
make women loose.

232
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,357
What is that?
Some Berkeley shrink thing?

233
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,659
No. Look around you, OK?

234
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,144
See this? This is the world.

235
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,820
Join it.

236
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,162
Stop swimming around
in your own mind.

237
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:37,606
That is a dangerous neighborhood
you should not go into alone.

238
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:40,017
Come on, Dave.
It's been two years, man.

239
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,134
No more hiding out.

240
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,070
Absolutely not.

241
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:38,584
- Are you insane? What are you doing?
- Oh, God, what is this?

242
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,727
I didn't want to do this,
but I will call the police.

243
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:43,179
I'm sleeping. It's a dream.

244
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:45,788
It's one of those dreams
and you know you're dreaming.

245
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:49,166
- How do you keep getting in here?
- It's you who's in here.

246
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,476
Oh, my.

247
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,751
This is more serious than I thought.

248
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:54,170
Go away.  You don't exist.

249
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,379
All right.  I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

250
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,847
I want you to answer honestly.

251
00:16:57,847 --> 00:17:00,947
Has your recent
alcohol consumption increased?

252
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:02,627
Yeah, so?

253
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:07,028
Are you hearing voices or seeing
things that aren't quite real to you?

254
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,612
As a matter of fact, yeah.

255
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,189
Well, then have you recently sought consult
from a mental health care professional?

256
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,816
What? How do you know that?
Stay away from me.

257
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:17,470
Do you often feel paranoid,
like people are out to get you?

258
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,305
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

259
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,206
I'll take that as a yes.
Listen to me.

260
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,950
You have fantasized,
quite convincingly,

261
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,977
that you've rented an apartment that,
in fact, belongs to somebody else.

262
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:31,205
Pick up that pillow.

263
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,422
Pick it up. It's OK.

264
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:38,540
There's a small red stain on the back
where I once spilled cherry cough syrup.

265
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,376
Yes, that's it.
How else would I know that?

266
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:46,169
Or the fact that these sheets that
you're now soiling are from Nordstrom.

267
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,430
I still have the receipt.
It's in that drawer right there.

268
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,606
Open it up and check.

269
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:53,790
I think you need to
come to terms with the fact

270
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,667
that you may be mentally ill.

271
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:58,536
- Really?
- Yes.

272
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:02,314
This is my apartment.
These are my sheets.

273
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,040
That's my nightstand.
That's my picture...

274
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,701
- Where's my picture?
- What picture?

275
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:11,780
There was a picture there of my...

276
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:16,135
There was a picture
right there on the nightstand.

277
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:19,063
- That was empty when I moved in.
- It was just there.

278
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:21,798
Okay.  You know what? I've had enough.
I am calling the police.

279
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:23,724
- No, no, no, no.
- It's too late.

280
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:29,369
What'd you do to my phone?

281
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:33,364
Why can't I?

282
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:37,643
You stay right there.

283
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,312
I'm gonna use the one in the kitchen.

284
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,156
Hey, Grace,
David Abbott here.

285
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:51,573
The people who sublet
this apartment to me,

286
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:53,935
- do you have their number?
- Why?  Something wrong?

287
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:57,596
No, no. I was just wondering
about the previous tenant.  That's all.

288
00:18:58,412 --> 00:19:02,414
Well, you know, the woman that I dealt with,
she didn't want to talk about it.

289
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:04,325
It was some kind of
tragedy in the family.

290
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,719
I didn't press for details
'cause I don't need any more drama.

291
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:11,280
- So you think this girl died?
- Well, you better hope so,

292
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,748
'Cause that's the only way
they're gonna get off

293
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:15,057
this month-to-month thing
and give you a real lease.

294
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:20,061
- You know, that's not exactly the reason I was...
- Come on, David, grow up.

295
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:21,936
Look, it has a view. It has a fireplace.

296
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:25,190
People would kill their grandmothers
for a lot less in this city.

297
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,171
- Can I help you with anything?
- No.

298
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:02,740
I mean, do you believe in this stuff?

299
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,736
Well, you don't until you do.

300
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:07,822
That's a little dated.

301
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:11,815
I recommend the Rosemary Preston.
It's totally seminal.

302
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:14,376
Excuse me.
Where's your UFO section?

303
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:16,137
It's back and to the left.

304
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:19,262
Ufology. It's not even
a real science.

305
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:22,240
So, what kind of encounter
do you have?

306
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,800
- Encounter?
- Ectoplasm?

307
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,326
Somniferous ether?

308
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:30,721
I have a killer séance book
if you're into communication.

309
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,831
Communicating is not her problem.

310
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:37,209
Righteous.
I have exactly what you need.

311
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:43,887
Yeah.

312
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,350
Crap!

313
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:52,800
There.

314
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,862
"Spirit, awake.

315
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,539
Spirit, partake.

316
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:03,174
Spirit, without fear.

317
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:06,071
Spirit, appear."

318
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,917
Are... are you here?

319
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,038
Come on, I think you're here.

320
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:21,967
OK.

321
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:25,619
I've got a hot, moist
cup of coffee in my hand.

322
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,448
There is no coaster on this table.

323
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,975
I'm going to set it down
on this lovely mahogany...

324
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:32,650
Don't you dare!

325
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,213
We... We need to talk.

326
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,071
About what?

327
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:44,025
Has it crossed your mind that there
might be something a little off

328
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:47,261
about the way you've
been spending your days?

329
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:50,625
Actually, yes. It's a little weird having
a squatter in your living room.

330
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,356
I am not...

331
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:54,836
OK, let's start over.

332
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:57,095
Hi, I'm David Abbott.

333
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:58,563
And you are?

334
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:01,055
I am...

335
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:06,160
I'm Elizabeth.
My name is Elizabeth.

336
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,521
You didn't know that.
You... you had to read that.

337
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:11,681
I think I know my own name.

338
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:15,174
OK. When was the last time
that you remember

339
00:22:15,174 --> 00:22:17,718
actually talking to someone
other than me?

340
00:22:17,718 --> 00:22:20,410
The other day. The other day.

341
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,380
And... And when you're not here,

342
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:26,191
what do you do
with the rest of your day?

343
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:29,660
Certainly a lot more than you do.
That's for sure.

344
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,811
Let's not stray from the point, Lizzie.

345
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:33,638
Don't call me Lizzie.
I'm not in kindergarten.

346
00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:36,906
- My name's Elizabeth.
- You think. Let me ask you.

347
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:40,359
- Has anything dramatic happened to you recently?
- Like what?

348
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,844
I don't know, like dying maybe?

349
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:45,120
How dare you say that to me?

350
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,406
OK, calm down.

351
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,740
Get your hands off of me, you pervert!

352
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,784
Calm down. I'm not...
I'm not here to hurt you.

353
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:54,060
I'm trying to help you
face the fact that...

354
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,861
- I'm not dead.
- Look around you.

355
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,070
There should be a bright light nearby.

356
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,347
- There's no light.
- Walk into the light, Elizabeth!

357
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:04,093
There is no light! I am not dead!
I think I would know if I was dead!

358
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,041
What's happening to me?

359
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,582
You're dead!

360
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:14,750
Stop saying that!

361
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,793
Missed.

362
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:19,803
OK. OK, that's enough.
That's enough.

363
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:23,389
Enough.  You're just giving me a headache!
Get off of me!

364
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:25,183
OK. All right, all right.

365
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:27,000
It's not my fault
you're the way you are.

366
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,444
- I just want you out of my house.
- You get out!

367
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:34,989
Rest in peace.

368
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:36,816
I'm not leaving.

369
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:54,702
Another one, my, my.

370
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:59,364
<i>Golden State playing very well...</i>

371
00:23:59,364 --> 00:24:01,290
I love ya
Tomorrow

372
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,724
You're only a day away

373
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:09,120
Tomorrow, tomorrow

374
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,510
I love ya
Tomorrow

375
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,462
You're only a day away

376
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:17,288
Fine!

377
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,930
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow

378
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,141
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

379
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:27,876
You know what? That's it.
I've had it with you.

380
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:30,302
I've tried to be nice,
but now you're outta here!

381
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,621
The power of Christ compels you!

382
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:36,257
The power of Christ compels you!

383
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:39,291
The power of Christ compels you!

384
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:42,511
The power of Christ compels you!

385
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:44,055
He can't even see me.

386
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:45,589
A little more left.

387
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:48,100
- You're mopping that up.
- More, more.

388
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,777
Everything went well.

389
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:58,664
They're gonna set off
the smoke detector.

390
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:07,646
Dad, we got it!

391
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:18,248
All set, sir. We have the spirit.

392
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:19,990
A butter dish.

393
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,709
- You sure?
- Oh, definitely.

394
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,343
I have him right here.

395
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:26,345
I'm gonna go give him a flush.

396
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:33,601
That's it?

397
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:34,877
You just sit there?

398
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:38,180
Hey, you want bells and whistles
or a reading?

399
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,813
Come on.
He can't see me, either.

400
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:44,658
- For some hideous reason, only you can.
- OK, there's somethin'.

401
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:46,651
Definitely a presence.

402
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:48,828
How original. Tell me more.

403
00:25:49,037 --> 00:25:50,546
It's hostile.

404
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:53,022
Wants you outta here.

405
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:54,499
Actually, he's not bad.

406
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,349
You should move, dude.

407
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,259
- I should move?
- I would.

408
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,369
I like him.

409
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:01,970
No, I'm not gonna move.

410
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,788
Can't you feel that, man?

411
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:06,673
There's like this
cancer-causing ray of spirit hate

412
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:09,918
- searing right towards your body.
- This kid's got a gift.

413
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,385
- I'm not moving!
- Why not?

414
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:14,562
It's not like it's that great
an apartment.

415
00:26:14,562 --> 00:26:15,853
- What?
- Yes, it is.

416
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:17,363
- It's got a view.
- And a fireplace.

417
00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:18,297
Whatever, dude.

418
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:21,340
Yo, do you have,
like, a diet anything?

419
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,017
I'm, like, 99.9 percent
parched here.

420
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,553
Could really use a cola.

421
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:28,455
Yeah. Come on.

422
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:40,263
Move out?
That... that can't be it.

423
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:43,664
Could you please talk to her
and tell her she should pass on?

424
00:26:43,664 --> 00:26:45,492
"Could you please talk to her?"

425
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:47,726
- I'm ignoring you.
- I'm ignoring you.

426
00:26:47,726 --> 00:26:51,379
She won't accept that she's dead.
I told her to walk to the light.

427
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:52,471
She wouldn't do it.

428
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:56,050
That's because there is no light.
God, you're infuriating!

429
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,374
Wait, what's goin' on?

430
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:01,742
You know what?
Do you think I like this?

431
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:03,654
Do you think this is easy for me?

432
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:06,221
I know something's different,
something is not right.

433
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:08,424
- I'm walking through walls here.
- You know,

434
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:10,275
I don't think I can help you.

435
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:13,127
This is one of the most
alive spirits I've ever been around.

436
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,930
- She's not goin' anywhere.
- What do you mean?

437
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,522
I agree with her, dude.
She's not dead.

438
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:24,480
But you, whoa.

439
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:26,806
You gotta deal with this...

440
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:34,918
'Cause seriously, that's like
the darkest aura I've ever seen.

441
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:37,937
Suckin' the life right outta you.
It's killin' you, man.

442
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:41,215
You have to let her go, dude.

443
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:44,377
How can I, when she won't leave?

444
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:46,236
Not your spirit girl.

445
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:47,844
I'm talkin' 'bout the other one.

446
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:49,838
The one you're keepin' in here.

447
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:52,990
That's what's really
haunting you, isn't it?

448
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:56,376
- I don't want to talk about that.
- I get it.

449
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:58,442
You were dumped.

450
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,237
Probably for some guy who doesn't
have a couch fused to his ass.

451
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:02,913
Shut up.

452
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:04,967
Why?  You can dish it out
but you can't take it?

453
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:08,927
You bring Father Flanagan
and the whole Joy Luck Club to get rid of me.

454
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,852
But I just talk about you
getting dumped once...

455
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:13,613
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about. Shut the hell up!

456
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:16,330
Sorry for your loss, bro.

457
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,677
A word to the wise, girl.

458
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:24,352
Show some respect for the dead.

459
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:35,394
David?

460
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:39,190
I'm sorry.

461
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:44,460
It occurred to me now that I...

462
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:47,619
...probably don't know you
all that well.

463
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,907
I got this place for the roof.

464
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,786
I was gonna do
a whole garden out here...

465
00:28:57,786 --> 00:29:00,886
...eventually, I think.

466
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,897
Now I'm babbling.

467
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:03,696
I...

468
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,007
I'm really sorry.

469
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:12,920
Most people who deal with loss really
find it helpful to talk about things.

470
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,895
I don't want to talk about it!

471
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:16,847
Anger works too.

472
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:21,783
Who was he talking about?

473
00:29:21,783 --> 00:29:23,802
Laura. Her name was Laura.

474
00:29:24,444 --> 00:29:25,611
Who's Laura?

475
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,487
She was my wife.

476
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:37,127
<i>What do you think I am, stupid?</i>

477
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:39,338
<i>What is this? Oh, come on.</i>

478
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:47,089
Don't. This is not gonna help.

479
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:50,099
Oh, really?  How would you know?
Have you ever been in a bar in your life?

480
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,188
The groundhog emerges!

481
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:02,228
I didn't think you'd make it.
All right! All right!

482
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:05,214
It's Jeff, Jody, Kim, Valerie.

483
00:30:05,214 --> 00:30:06,224
This is my buddy, Dave.

484
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,650
- Nice to meet you, Valerie.
- What are you drinkin'?

485
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,826
- Coffee.
- Scotch!

486
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:11,852
- Don't you dare!
- Make it a double!

487
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,104
You don't have to wait.
I can start the hangover right now.

488
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:18,684
Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:20,759
He's excited to be out. I know!

490
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,268
Friday night!

491
00:30:22,268 --> 00:30:24,920
- You can't drink these feelings away, David.
- Watch me.

492
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:28,906
So, you OK?

493
00:30:28,906 --> 00:30:31,807
Say goodbye, walk to the door,
let's get some food in your stomach.

494
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:32,875
Who made you my mother?

495
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,228
Did I?

496
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:39,328
How you comin' along
with those hallucinations?

497
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:41,815
- That was nothing.
- You're not a well man, David.

498
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:45,284
- It's just a lack of sleep.  That's all.
- Sleep? You gettin' any?

499
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:46,609
- Eight hours.
- Twelve.

500
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:50,229
- Nine, tops.
- Opium addicts are more alert than you, David.

501
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:52,731
- Will you knock it off.
- Don't you dare!

502
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:53,966
Don't!

503
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:55,376
Last chance.

504
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,054
What are you gonna do about it?

505
00:31:08,538 --> 00:31:09,936
Dave, buddy!

506
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:17,443
Oh, I'm so...

507
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:21,054
I'm sorry. God!

508
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:23,764
- You freak!
- Dave, that is uncool, man!

509
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,310
Good God!

510
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,444
You're gonna thank me
for that one day.

511
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:36,273
For what? Making me look like a lunatic
in front of all those people?

512
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:52,517
Why are you still here?

513
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,895
That's a scary question.
I have no idea.

514
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:58,830
Why are you the only one
that can see me?

515
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,956
Don't ask me.

516
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:06,469
All I know is when I'm not with you,
it's like I don't... exist.

517
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:08,937
Oh, my God.

518
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:11,122
Maybe I am dead.

519
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:15,954
Oh, come on now.

520
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,832
I'm... I'm sorry
that I said you're dead.

521
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:21,408
Maybe you're not dead.

522
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:24,468
Maybe you're just very... light.

523
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:29,821
If I could just remember something
about who I am, or was.

524
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:31,821
I mean, then I'd know
once and for all.

525
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,058
I'm trying to figure it out. I...

526
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:38,910
I just can't do it by myself.

527
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:45,406
You're not asking me to...
to help you, are you?

528
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:45,973
Look.

529
00:32:46,658 --> 00:32:49,117
You have two realities
to choose from.

530
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:52,007
First one being that a woman
has come into your life

531
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:55,602
in a very unconventional way
and she happens to need your assistance.

532
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:56,136
Right.

533
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:59,243
The second one is that
you're an insane person.

534
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,999
You're sitting on a park bench
talking to yourself.

535
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:05,992
I think I prefer the first one.

536
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:07,410
OK.

537
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:09,811
Let's find out who I am.

538
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:18,561
No. I think that apartment was vacant.

539
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:20,551
That was a woman?

540
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:23,676
Nobody live there.

541
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:25,892
It's like I was a ghost
before I was dead.

542
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:30,511
Hi. Can I help you?

543
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,863
Finally, somebody normal.
I bet we were friends.

544
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:35,806
Hi, I'm... I'm David.
I am a new tenant here.

545
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,258
Hi, David, Katrina.
Come on in.

546
00:33:38,258 --> 00:33:40,822
- She's friendly. I like her.
- No, this'll just take a sec.

547
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:44,571
I have a question. The apartment
upstairs, it belonged to a young woman.

548
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:46,747
Yeah, I think there
was somebody up there.

549
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:49,834
But she was, like, totally antisocial, you know.

550
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,011
OK, maybe we weren't close friends.

551
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:55,921
Kinda like a cat lady,
but without any cats.

552
00:33:55,921 --> 00:33:56,678
Right?

553
00:33:56,678 --> 00:33:59,560
OK, I think we're done here. Let's go.

554
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,667
- OK, thank you.
- Look. This is so retro,

555
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:04,144
but I've got a window
I can't get open.

556
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:05,954
- She's got to be kidding.
- What?

557
00:34:05,954 --> 00:34:07,196
- What?
- What?

558
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:08,581
She wants you to come in.

559
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:10,680
Well, if it's painted shut

560
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,299
and you use a screwdriver
to jam it, it sometimes...

561
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:15,124
Oh, tried it.

562
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:16,258
Won't budge.

563
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:19,294
No preliminaries. Incredible.

564
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:22,756
I'd like to help,
but I have dinner plans.

565
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,639
Well, I got dessert.

566
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,415
I just threw up in my mouth.

567
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:28,250
Well, OK. I...

568
00:34:30,954 --> 00:34:31,770
Nice to meet you.

569
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,294
- You too, Dave.
- Thanks.

570
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:36,580
Why is she wearing workout clothes?

571
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:39,262
I mean if you were gonna work out
in the middle of the day,

572
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:43,213
which is basically the only reason to wear workout clothes,
do you really need a push-up bra?

573
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:45,222
The whole point's
to strap 'em down and push them up.

574
00:34:45,222 --> 00:34:49,322
- You know what? You're not comin' with me anymore.
- Why? Something might jog my memory.

575
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:53,772
Too bad. You're like an AM radio someone
shoved in my head and I can't turn off.

576
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:57,797
You don't think she was
completely un-classy and predatory?

577
00:34:57,797 --> 00:35:00,268
Those happen to be
two of men's favorite things.

578
00:35:00,268 --> 00:35:02,920
- Why don't you just date a pit bull?
- Maybe I will.

579
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:05,004
- Damn it!
- What?

580
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:08,465
I locked my key in the apartment.

581
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:10,600
Oh, there's a spare key
under the fire extinguisher.

582
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:15,635
I mean, I guess she's sexy if you're
into that whole tall, big boobs,

583
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:17,840
long legs, model-y sorta thing.

584
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:19,196
I guess if you wanna be that guy.

585
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:21,954
Look.  There are five other units here,

586
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,360
and not one person even
remembers what you look like.

587
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,862
Talk about being disconnected
from people.

588
00:35:26,862 --> 00:35:30,266
- Are you sure you really want that?
- Oh, yes, I'm sure.

589
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,998
Next drawer in the left.

590
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:37,977
There's a funnel in there too,
if you need it.

591
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:43,638
- Check it out.
- What is it?

592
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:44,739
New leads.

593
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,662
Look, there's an address
written on here.

594
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:49,445
I can't make that out.
Is that a five or a six?

595
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:50,788
I think it's a...

596
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,606
No, no, no, that's a five.
Definitely a five.

597
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,477
So we have an address, a dry cleaning
ticket and a book of matches.

598
00:35:57,477 --> 00:35:58,919
You know what that means?

599
00:35:58,919 --> 00:36:02,262
- We could start a very small fire?
- There's still hope.

600
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,348
Oh, yes, these pants were jet black.

601
00:36:05,348 --> 00:36:06,757
Armani, I believe.

602
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:09,070
Oh, yes, I remember them.
They were expensive.

603
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,710
Do you remember anything else
about the woman? It's important.

604
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,971
She's pleasant,
but a little dull maybe.

605
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,064
- Dull?
- Dull?

606
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:20,082
I think of her,
I think of sadness, loneliness.

607
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:22,742
You know, I don't need a psychological
profile from this guy.

608
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:25,470
- Can we just get the pants?
- Can I get the pants?

609
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:28,134
Item left too long.
We give them to homeless shelter.

610
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:30,830
Give away my pants?
Are you insane? They were Armani.

611
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,298
OK, let's go.

612
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:35,591
Are you coming or not?

613
00:36:35,591 --> 00:36:37,601
They're pants.
What do you need 'em for?

614
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:51,313
425, I think.

615
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:55,141
- Look familiar?
- Not really.

616
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,295
Hi.

617
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:05,041
Hello.

618
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:07,848
Can I help you?

619
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:12,553
Hi.  This might sound a little odd, but I was
wondering if you knew a certain woman.

620
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:15,359
Blond, about five-foot-one...

621
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,239
- Two. And a half.
- Two and a half?

622
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,280
Oh, my God. Who are you?

623
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,869
I don't know you. I...

624
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:23,816
- Did my wife hire you?
- I'm sorry, what?

625
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,449
I knew she'd find out.

626
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:28,216
Whatever she's payin' you,
I'll double it.

627
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:30,060
- Anything you want.
- I'm not looking for money, sir.

628
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,047
- Donald! Who is it?
- That's her. Come back around six.

629
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:34,196
I'll have a check ready.

630
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:35,162
But-

631
00:37:39,797 --> 00:37:41,532
Wow.

632
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:48,998
What? Oh, you don't think I actually
had sex with that old horndog.

633
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:52,801
- Kinda looks that way, Lizzie.
- It's Elizabeth. And that's disgusting.

634
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:56,322
Well, look on the bright side.
At 6:00, I'm coming into some money.

635
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:01,901
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

636
00:38:06,507 --> 00:38:08,738
Oh, my God.

637
00:38:08,694 --> 00:38:10,475
Maybe I was a slut.

638
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:14,150
A lonely, home-wrecking slut.

639
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:25,511
I mean seriously.

640
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:29,112
So what if I was a slut? There's nothing
wrong with a healthy sexual appetite.

641
00:38:29,112 --> 00:38:29,686
Not at all.

642
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:32,498
Of course. Look who I'm talking to,
Mr. Tried To Feel Me Up One Time.

643
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:35,067
I'm trying to agree with you.

644
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:35,809
- David.
- What?

645
00:38:36,451 --> 00:38:37,433
This is it.

646
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:40,220
You recognize it? Good.

647
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,927
OK. Come on.

648
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:50,109
This is Moose's.
I love this restaurant.

649
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:51,943
- You ate here a lot.
- No.

650
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:53,294
- No.
- I never did.

651
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:56,562
I remember looking in that window
and wishing I could eat in here.

652
00:38:56,562 --> 00:39:00,065
What, were you a homeless
street urchin? Why didn't you?

653
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:02,408
I wanted to.
I just never got around to it.

654
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,068
Maybe the dry-cleaner guy
was right about me.

655
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:08,497
Hello, can I help you?

656
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:11,407
No, thank you.
Maybe some other time.

657
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:13,599
Kenny!

658
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,018
Ivan, call 911.
We need an ambulance!

659
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:18,228
- Are you OK?
- Undo his collar.

660
00:39:18,228 --> 00:39:19,821
- Is he breathing?
- I can't tell.

661
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:23,617
- Maybe we should do mouth-to-mouth.
- God. We need a doctor.

662
00:39:23,617 --> 00:39:25,050
We really have to find a doctor.

663
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,435
Is there a doctor here? Anyone?

664
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:30,279
- Feel his chest.
- What?

665
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:32,214
His chest!
Check and see if it's bloated.

666
00:39:32,214 --> 00:39:33,922
- How would I know?
- Just do it!

667
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,949
Excuse me. Pardon me.
I need to feel his chest.

668
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:39,785
Can you feel his ribs?

669
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:41,827
No, but I can if I press down.

670
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:43,813
- What are you doing?
- Does he feel bloated?

671
00:39:44,126 --> 00:39:45,704
- I think so.
- Think what?

672
00:39:45,704 --> 00:39:48,547
Tell them you'll need a sharp
paring knife and a bottle of vodka.

673
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:51,742
I need a sharp paring knife
and a bottle of vodka.

674
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:53,302
- Ivan?
- Yeah, got it.

675
00:39:53,302 --> 00:39:55,886
- What's wrong with him?
- It's a tension pneumothorax.

676
00:39:55,886 --> 00:39:57,989
- I think it's a tension nemothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

677
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:59,497
- Pneumothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

678
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,990
- Pneumathurman.
- Never mind.

679
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,507
- Never mind!
- But what is it?

680
00:40:03,507 --> 00:40:05,892
The air is escaping
out of the lungs into his chest.

681
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:07,603
...out of his lungs into his chest.

682
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:08,895
- Open his shirt.
- Open his shirt.

683
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:10,738
- No, you do it.
- I'll do it.

684
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,936
There's a valve at the opening of the lungs.
If it doesn't close,

685
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:16,774
then it constricts the lungs
and compresses the rest of the organs.

686
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:20,205
Now, I want you to feel for his ribs again.
A little bit lower.

687
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,291
The spot between two ribs.
Do you feel that?

688
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,016
OK, splash some vodka on it.

689
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,253
- All right. Get the knife.
- OK.

690
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:31,743
Can I ask everyone just
to stand back a little bit here?

691
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:35,382
A little bit further, please.
A little bit further. Thank you.

692
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:38,764
- What am I doing with the knife?
- You've got to make an incision.

693
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,439
You know what? No.

694
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:44,226
- David, this man's life is at stake.
- I... I can't stab a man.

695
00:40:44,226 --> 00:40:46,720
OK. There's nothing to be afraid of.

696
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,104
You're just gonna make
a hole for the air to escape.

697
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:50,613
So put the knife on that spot.

698
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:53,087
Oh, my God.
How do you know this?

699
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:56,181
I don't know.  I just do.  Now do it!
Put the knife there.

700
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:58,150
Now, you're gonna need
to push harder than that.

701
00:40:58,254 --> 00:41:00,251
- A little bit harder.
- Oh, God!

702
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,785
OK! OK, good! That's enough.

703
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:05,021
All right, now, take the pourer
out of the vodka bottle.

704
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,513
- What?
- You're doing good. Now...

705
00:41:07,513 --> 00:41:08,213
Hold on.

706
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:15,268
- Go.
- Put the pourer in the hole you made.

707
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:15,952
What?

708
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:19,213
It's gonna keep the wound open
so air can escape. Just do it!

709
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:20,146
- I can't.
- Do it.

710
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:25,684
- He's breathing.
- He's breathing!

711
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:27,567
He's breathing!

712
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,419
I'm a doctor.

713
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:30,271
I'm a doctor!

714
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:34,365
I know. Thank God. The ambulance
will be here right away.

715
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:35,999
Ask him where the nearest hospital is.

716
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,568
Do you know where
the nearest hospital is?

717
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:40,561
Just a few blocks from here, St. Matthews.

718
00:41:40,561 --> 00:41:41,934
- Thank you.
- St. Matthews?

719
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:45,720
I may have been a lonel home-wrecking
whore, but I saved lives.

720
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,349
I worked in that hospital.
I know it, it sounds so familiar.

721
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:51,918
- I've never saved a life before.
- Oh, it's the best.

722
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:54,546
One minute you're looking at
this monitor, it says "game over,"

723
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,446
and then you bring it back,
a little blip and it's there!

724
00:41:57,446 --> 00:41:59,823
- What's that?
- That's just a little blood.

725
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:04,734
David?

726
00:42:10,463 --> 00:42:12,798
- I work here.
- You did?

727
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:15,770
The receptionist, her name is Amita.

728
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,347
It's all coming back to me now.

729
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,240
There's Bill and Karen

730
00:42:19,866 --> 00:42:21,150
and Michael and...

731
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,627
Elizabeth? You mean Elizabeth Masterson?

732
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:29,164
- Masterson. Yes, that's my name.
- Yes, that's it. Elizabeth Masterson.

733
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:32,357
Dr. Masterson is...

734
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:35,951
...is not active on our staff right now.

735
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:39,713
Hold on. Let me talk to someone.

736
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:42,548
Excuse me, doctor?

737
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:44,523
Oh, no, she's got the tone.

738
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:45,982
- What tone?
- The tone.

739
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:48,067
When you're trying to pass the buck
onto somebody else

740
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:49,119
to tell you your friend died!

741
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:51,837
Excuse me, sir.

742
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:55,970
I need you to go to
the third-floor nurses' station.

743
00:42:58,013 --> 00:43:00,873
Oh, no, it's Fran. She's my mentor.

744
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:02,670
They wouldn't send us
here if it wasn't bad.

745
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,192
- Mr. Abbott?
- Hi, yes.

746
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:06,161
- Fran Lo.
- Nice to meet you.

747
00:43:06,265 --> 00:43:08,999
You've been inquiring
about Elizabeth Masterson?

748
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:11,985
Yeah, that's right. Could you tell me
what happened to her?

749
00:43:11,985 --> 00:43:14,395
First I need to know
your relationship with her.

750
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:17,356
Tell her you're my boyfriend.
She can't tell you anything

751
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:19,183
unless she knows
we're intimately connected.

752
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:23,143
We were romantic with each other.

753
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,738
- What do you mean?
- You know, boyfriend-girlfriend.

754
00:43:25,842 --> 00:43:28,471
I know what romantic means,

755
00:43:28,471 --> 00:43:31,441
but I... I have
a hard time believing that.

756
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,534
- What? Why?
- What? Why?

757
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:36,160
Elizabeth's whole life
was this hospital.

758
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,003
"Was"? Did she say "was"?

759
00:43:38,003 --> 00:43:40,371
I don't know of a single date
she'd ever been on.

760
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,866
We were fairly recent.
I live in her apartment...

761
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:45,016
- David.
- Building.

762
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:48,410
So, you don't know about the accident.

763
00:43:49,202 --> 00:43:50,078
Accident.

764
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,139
Oh, God, David. I remember it.

765
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:56,539
It was awful.

766
00:43:57,675 --> 00:43:59,393
I was... I've been away.

767
00:43:59,497 --> 00:44:01,815
It was three months ago.

768
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:04,367
Three months.

769
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,610
I'm sorry.

770
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,437
I was away for awhile
on a business trip.

771
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:50,301
Oh, my God.

772
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,399
What was that?
You were, like, flying.

773
00:44:55,718 --> 00:44:59,295
Oh, my God. It's you.

774
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:02,576
It's you.  Iit's really you.

775
00:45:03,428 --> 00:45:05,404
You're... you're not dead.
You're alive.

776
00:45:05,404 --> 00:45:07,773
I know, David, but I'm in a coma.
This is not good.

777
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:09,482
Well, it's way better than dead.

778
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:12,067
Look at you.
Your body is healing, it's...

779
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:14,977
You don't have any scars.
You look pretty.

780
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,629
It doesn't matter how I look.

781
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:21,465
Three months,
that's a persistent coma.

782
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:23,902
OK.  We're here now.
Let's do something.

783
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:24,851
Like what?

784
00:45:24,851 --> 00:45:28,487
Like... I don't know.
You're the doctor.

785
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:30,298
Right. Right.

786
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,099
- Forget it.
- What?

787
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,799
I was gonna say that we...

788
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,760
I need to find a way
to put myself together again.

789
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,129
OK, good, good. That's great.
How do we do that?

790
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:44,373
Maybe I should try this.

791
00:45:49,262 --> 00:45:50,812
Something's happening!

792
00:45:50,812 --> 00:45:52,906
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I think it's working!

793
00:45:52,906 --> 00:45:55,590
Yeah? No.

794
00:45:55,694 --> 00:45:56,716
Let me try again.

795
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,792
I mean, really focus on it.

796
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,786
Hold on inside there.

797
00:46:04,672 --> 00:46:05,664
I'm not sticking.

798
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:09,182
It's like I'm no longer
connected to this body.

799
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:11,935
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Turn around.

800
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,336
- What?
- I want to try something.

801
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:15,770
OK.

802
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:23,992
You felt that.

803
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:25,043
My hand tingled.

804
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:27,227
You are still connected to your body.

805
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,329
The monitor doesn't agree.

806
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:31,180
Machines don't know everything.

807
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,174
Everything in my training
tells me they do.

808
00:46:33,278 --> 00:46:35,692
Then how are we having
this conversation?

809
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,708
I don't know.

810
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,720
Mr. Abbott? I'm sorry.
I have an appointment,

811
00:46:40,824 --> 00:46:43,530
and I can't leave you here unattended.

812
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,525
Can I just have a couple
more minutes, please?

813
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:47,091
I'm saying goodbye.

814
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:48,842
- Of course.
- Thank you.

815
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:52,128
My nieces must have
made these things for me.

816
00:46:52,336 --> 00:46:55,230
Wow, that's an amazing likeness.

817
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:58,758
Look at this.

818
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:01,127
That's the picture
from my nightstand.

819
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,575
Abby must have brought it.

820
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,417
You look great.

821
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:09,253
Look at me now.

822
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:13,018
These levels aren't changing, David.

823
00:47:13,642 --> 00:47:15,553
If anything, they're decreasing.

824
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:20,634
- I'm gonna have to leave soon.
- All right.

825
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:23,785
Want me to wait
downstairs in the lobby?

826
00:47:23,785 --> 00:47:26,872
No, no, that's sweet.
You should go.

827
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:28,697
Thank you for helping me.

828
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:30,167
It was my pleasure.

829
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:34,758
Are you sure you don't want
to come back with me?

830
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:37,134
After all,
it is your apartment. It's fine.

831
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:39,952
After I made it here, I...

832
00:47:41,345 --> 00:47:43,547
...can't imagine
leaving myself, you know?

833
00:47:43,755 --> 00:47:45,449
OK, I know, I just...

834
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,908
It just feels weird
leaving you here alone.

835
00:47:49,322 --> 00:47:50,732
I don't know where else I belong.

836
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:54,092
Mr. Abbott. I'm sorry.

837
00:47:59,237 --> 00:48:00,388
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

838
00:48:02,563 --> 00:48:04,516
Goodbye.

839
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:14,504
Oh, I hate this.

840
00:48:14,608 --> 00:48:16,938
She finally gets a life, and then...

841
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:18,480
You know what?
That guy was cute.

842
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:21,474
At least she got a chance
to hang with him for a little while.

843
00:48:21,683 --> 00:48:25,052
Yeah. It woulda been awful
if she'd gone through her whole life

844
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:26,804
not knowing what it was all about.

845
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:46,696
Oh, my God. Jenny?

846
00:48:47,585 --> 00:48:49,555
No wonder
I could never find you.

847
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,952
I guess you got my job.

848
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:02,398
Yeah. I think I've earned it.
I deserve it.

849
00:49:02,502 --> 00:49:04,566
Everything
you thought it would be?

850
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,576
It is. And it's time to upgrade
from the 330 to the 740.

851
00:49:08,576 --> 00:49:09,652
I'm goin' to the dealer tonight.

852
00:49:10,984 --> 00:49:13,479
Hold on. It's Walsh,
I have to take this.

853
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,429
Hello?

854
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,091
Really? You want me to do it?

855
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:19,966
Sure, of course I can.

856
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:28,724
Dude, did you know I can get
a built-in jack for my iPod?

857
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:30,665
Did you know there's
people out there dying?

858
00:49:30,665 --> 00:49:34,193
- I'm in a coma, have you noticed?
- I know. Sweet!

859
00:49:42,394 --> 00:49:44,650
Zoe? Lily Vanilli?

860
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,164
Oh, my God,
you guys got so big!

861
00:49:51,652 --> 00:49:52,560
Beat ya!

862
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,847
- Did not!
- Did too!

863
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,620
- Did not!
- Did too!

864
00:49:55,724 --> 00:49:57,156
Did not!
Did too!

865
00:49:57,156 --> 00:49:59,208
How could I feel him
and not you guys?

866
00:49:59,208 --> 00:49:59,826
- Did not!
- Did too!

867
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:02,552
- Oh, that's funny.
- Abby.

868
00:50:02,656 --> 00:50:05,028
I remember saying
no running, no screaming!

869
00:50:05,028 --> 00:50:07,363
- Abby, can you feel me?
- All right, chill, I'm serious.

870
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,881
I guess not.

871
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,382
- I hope you feel better.
- Get well soon.

872
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:13,760
I love you.

873
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:16,577
I remember when you pushed us...

874
00:50:16,577 --> 00:50:18,095
It's so sweet you guys
come and visit me.

875
00:50:18,994 --> 00:50:20,588
- And I really miss...
- Excuse me.

876
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:23,006
- Mrs. Brody, hi.
- Hi.

877
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:25,633
Dr. Rushton.
Could I have a quick word?

878
00:50:25,737 --> 00:50:27,601
- Sure.
- What do you want?

879
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,153
First of all, I hope you know how much
we all love and miss Elizabeth.

880
00:50:32,257 --> 00:50:34,337
Please. He's doing high fives.
He's not in Phoenix.

881
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:37,019
And because she was
a senior resident here,

882
00:50:37,443 --> 00:50:39,520
we've taken some fairly
extraordinary measures

883
00:50:39,624 --> 00:50:42,196
to make her feel more comfortable
these last three months.

884
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:44,503
Lily! Turn it back!

885
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,981
Zoe, what did we talk about?

886
00:50:46,981 --> 00:50:49,071
Watch your sister. Sorry.

887
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,677
Well, this is hard to say.

888
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:54,751
When we come to work here,

889
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:57,327
we are asked to sign release forms.

890
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:58,503
OK.

891
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:00,072
I don't like the sound of this.

892
00:51:00,176 --> 00:51:03,749
Did you know your sister's opinion
about artificially prolonging life?

893
00:51:05,475 --> 00:51:07,303
- No.
- She was against it.

894
00:51:07,408 --> 00:51:08,386
Really?

895
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,080
OK, that was before.
I am completely for it now.

896
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:14,582
Honestly, most in our
profession feel that way.

897
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:16,708
Not me! I'm perfectly happy.

898
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:18,251
Come on, Abby!

899
00:51:18,355 --> 00:51:20,415
You have got to feel me,
I'm your sister!

900
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:23,338
But there's still some
brain activity, isn't there?

901
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,539
I mean people have woken up
from this kind of coma before.

902
00:51:25,644 --> 00:51:28,124
- All the time.
- Not on any record I've found.

903
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:31,093
Of course they have!
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

904
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:33,538
I feel car sick.

905
00:51:33,538 --> 00:51:37,682
- What are you doing?
- We're looking for the stick.

906
00:51:37,682 --> 00:51:38,325
What stick?

907
00:51:38,325 --> 00:51:41,226
- You said she had a stick up her...
- Stop it! Come on.

908
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:44,104
TV is going to become
a very dim memory for you two.

909
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,911
Mrs. Brody,
Elizabeth did sign a release, but...

910
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,584
Because of the special situation,

911
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:51,809
we won't take any terminal action
without your explicit approval.

912
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,095
Now, I've prepared this paperwork...

913
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:55,766
Abby, don't sign that.
I'm here!

914
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:58,111
...if you decide to sign...
- I'll think about it.

915
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:01,571
Abby, I'll baby-sit more, I swear!

916
00:52:01,676 --> 00:52:03,613
Those jeans you love?
They're yours!

917
00:52:03,613 --> 00:52:05,001
Sometimes we find that it's easier

918
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:08,358
just to ask God's forgiveness
and not prolong the inevitable.

919
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:09,879
I said I'd think about it.

920
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:13,257
Thank you, Abby.

921
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,757
You always looked out for me.

922
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:29,378
You here?

923
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:35,464
I guess not.

924
00:53:32,074 --> 00:53:33,374
I'm locked out.

925
00:53:54,582 --> 00:53:57,452
Doesn't this location
make San Francisco bearable?

926
00:53:57,452 --> 00:54:00,645
Wait, you're not from here,
are you? Oh, good.

927
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:03,481
And what's with all
the single men in this town?

928
00:54:03,585 --> 00:54:07,433
Every time I meet
a good-looking guy... lesbian.

929
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:08,511
It's tough.

930
00:54:09,182 --> 00:54:11,583
I'd get on the phone and I'd be like,

931
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:13,734
"Hello? Osama?

932
00:54:14,509 --> 00:54:16,194
Communism is so over.

933
00:54:16,194 --> 00:54:17,904
Like, give your people toilet paper."

934
00:54:17,904 --> 00:54:20,397
So, like, if I had to choose?

935
00:54:20,397 --> 00:54:21,740
If I had to choose.

936
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,725
Wow.

937
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,236
I guess I'd have to go
with the midget.

938
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:30,930
I'm sorry...

939
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,814
The locksmith,
does he know to ring my unit?

940
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:36,991
I think so.

941
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:40,011
Where's your bathroom?

942
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:42,535
- It's right down the hall there.
- OK.

943
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:56,339
- Elizabeth!
- Yeah.

944
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:59,009
No, I just... I didn't think
you were gonna come back.

945
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:02,502
I thought you were gonna stay
at the hospital with your body.

946
00:55:02,606 --> 00:55:05,528
It's terrible. They're trying
to get my sister to sign papers

947
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:08,276
authorizing permission
to take me off of life support.

948
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,778
- No! What? They can't do that!
- I know. I said that.

949
00:55:11,711 --> 00:55:12,680
Nobody could hear me.

950
00:55:12,784 --> 00:55:14,905
And I just wanted to talk to you.

951
00:55:14,905 --> 00:55:16,857
- David!
- Just a minute!

952
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:20,275
Well, that didn't take very long.

953
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:21,984
No.

954
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:23,943
No, she barged in.

955
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:25,969
She got locked out of her apartment.

956
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:29,382
- You don't have to explain. I get it.
- No, you don't get anything.

957
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:30,624
She's using the bathroom...

958
00:55:30,624 --> 00:55:32,650
Her voice sounded
like it came from the bedroom.

959
00:55:32,755 --> 00:55:33,860
It did?

960
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,938
Come here.
I want to show you something.

961
00:55:38,637 --> 00:55:40,304
When you know, you know, right?

962
00:55:41,035 --> 00:55:43,448
I had no idea that's...

963
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:45,483
You had no idea
she was naked on your bed.

964
00:55:45,587 --> 00:55:46,325
No.

965
00:55:48,794 --> 00:55:50,947
You're wondering
what she looks like.

966
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,281
- No, I'm not.
- A little?

967
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:54,299
Not enough to go look.

968
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:56,842
Tell you what.
I'll do a little recon for ya.

969
00:55:56,842 --> 00:55:59,638
- Please don't!
- Don't worry. I'm a doctor.

970
00:55:59,638 --> 00:56:03,091
- Elizabeth. No, no, no, no, no.
- Relax.

971
00:56:05,684 --> 00:56:07,276
She's got a tattoo on her ass.

972
00:56:09,821 --> 00:56:10,980
It says "All aboard."

973
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,523
- Really?
- In three languages.

974
00:56:13,523 --> 00:56:16,051
- Oh, that's funny.
- She's very cultural.

975
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:17,384
You know, you sound jealous.

976
00:56:17,906 --> 00:56:19,636
- Oh, please.
- You do.

977
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,761
Are you talkin' to someone?

978
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:25,823
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Eyes up top, David.

979
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:27,975
No, nothing.

980
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:31,077
Look, I'm sorry if I'm coming on
a little too strong.

981
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:32,960
That's just my style.

982
00:56:33,737 --> 00:56:35,445
I hear you sometimes.

983
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:37,228
Up here...

984
00:56:38,371 --> 00:56:40,222
...by yourself...

985
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:42,899
And I just figured...

986
00:56:43,806 --> 00:56:45,924
...maybe he's lonely.

987
00:56:46,132 --> 00:56:47,792
I know I am.

988
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:50,686
Is it wrong for me
to want to touch someone?

989
00:56:51,344 --> 00:56:52,221
To be close?

990
00:56:52,921 --> 00:56:55,189
Feel a warm body next to me?

991
00:56:56,015 --> 00:56:58,340
David, just do it.

992
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,074
What?

993
00:56:59,074 --> 00:57:02,559
Go ahead, be with her.
It's what you both want.

994
00:57:02,663 --> 00:57:05,312
- No, it isn't.
- Are you all right?

995
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:09,122
Do you... wanna take
some kind of medication first?

996
00:57:09,227 --> 00:57:10,581
It's cool if you do.

997
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,401
David, it's OK.

998
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:15,283
She's beautiful, and she's
right here in front of you.

999
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:17,992
- And I'm in the way.
- No, you're not.

1000
00:57:17,992 --> 00:57:19,436
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

1001
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,078
Elizabeth!

1002
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:27,717
It's Katrina.

1003
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:42,530
That was quick.

1004
00:57:44,158 --> 00:57:45,765
Come on, nothing happened.

1005
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,511
What'd you say to her?

1006
00:57:53,058 --> 00:57:54,800
That I was seeing someone.

1007
00:57:56,502 --> 00:57:57,993
Honestly?

1008
00:57:59,073 --> 00:58:02,278
Well, I didn't mention
that I was the only person who could.

1009
00:58:07,749 --> 00:58:09,547
You know, I haven't...

1010
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:13,226
...haven't really been
with anyone since...

1011
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:15,194
...since Laura.

1012
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:19,570
She was cursing at her shoe.

1013
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:22,824
Her heel had broken.

1014
00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:29,167
And then she just kinda sat down

1015
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,642
and put her hand to her head.

1016
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:32,953
Cerebral hemorrhage?

1017
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:39,813
And...

1018
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:46,568
I couldn't do anything to help her.

1019
00:58:46,881 --> 00:58:48,533
She was, like, gone.

1020
00:58:48,741 --> 00:58:52,194
I couldn't even say goodbye,
and she was just...

1021
00:58:52,298 --> 00:58:53,695
She's gone.

1022
00:59:00,465 --> 00:59:01,857
What was she like?

1023
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:06,220
Ah, you know, she was just
a big pain in the ass.

1024
00:59:06,986 --> 00:59:08,312
No, really.

1025
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,848
I mean, the bras on the doorknobs,

1026
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:15,285
leaving the car with the...
with the gas needle below empty.

1027
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:18,127
She couldn't put gas in the car.
It was impossible for her.

1028
00:59:18,127 --> 00:59:23,056
And just total stubborn inability
to master a remote.

1029
00:59:23,056 --> 00:59:25,398
So she would just
randomly click buttons,

1030
00:59:25,398 --> 00:59:29,598
until the TV was snarled into
some unmanageable condition.

1031
00:59:29,598 --> 00:59:31,845
I mean, I'm so...

1032
00:59:31,949 --> 00:59:35,485
I'm mad just thinking...

1033
00:59:37,237 --> 00:59:38,913
...thinking about her.

1034
00:59:41,755 --> 00:59:43,425
I'm sorry, David.

1035
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:48,010
Your sister really wouldn't
sign those papers, would she?

1036
00:59:48,736 --> 00:59:50,143
I don't know.

1037
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:52,846
I hope not.

1038
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:57,033
Won't even matter
if I don't wake up soon.

1039
00:59:57,633 --> 01:00:00,010
My brain activity's
decreasing every day.

1040
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:02,362
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

1041
01:00:02,362 --> 01:00:03,947
You're kind of a smarty-pants.

1042
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:07,207
No, it'll bring you down to my level.

1043
01:00:07,848 --> 01:00:10,575
You're not dumb, David,
just a little lazy.

1044
01:00:10,783 --> 01:00:13,045
Cute, but lazy.

1045
01:00:13,149 --> 01:00:14,752
Thank you.

1046
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:17,021
I wasn't always like this, you know.

1047
01:00:18,021 --> 01:00:19,481
What were you like?

1048
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:25,835
Come on.

1049
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:27,861
I want to show you something.

1050
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,987
- Where are we?
- It's an estate.

1051
01:00:42,091 --> 01:00:43,857
The guy's in Hawaii this time of year.

1052
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:47,225
- Are we trespassing?
- Don't worry.  We're not going inside.

1053
01:00:48,109 --> 01:00:49,593
Here it is.

1054
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:58,390
You said you love gardens.

1055
01:00:58,494 --> 01:01:00,141
What is this place?

1056
01:01:00,684 --> 01:01:02,317
I made this place.

1057
01:01:04,506 --> 01:01:05,988
This is my work.

1058
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,324
I was a landscape architect.
I had my own company for a while.

1059
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:13,859
David, I've been here before.

1060
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,761
What do you mean?

1061
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:18,287
I know this is gonna
sound really strange,

1062
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:20,849
but I dreamed of this place.

1063
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:25,643
These flowers, everything.

1064
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,544
It's beautiful.

1065
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:30,313
I had no idea, David.

1066
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:33,706
What a joy it must be
to create a place like this.

1067
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,034
Yeah, it was.

1068
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:38,808
Is it gonna be again?

1069
01:01:40,226 --> 01:01:41,693
Sure.

1070
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:43,329
Promise?

1071
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:02,716
Ah, well, who the hell's calling me?

1072
01:02:03,437 --> 01:02:04,061
Hello?

1073
01:02:04,165 --> 01:02:05,617
David, it's Grace.

1074
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:09,226
Well, you are the luckiest man
in San Francisco.

1075
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,611
Thank you. Why do you say that?

1076
01:02:11,715 --> 01:02:14,180
Great news, the apartment is yours.

1077
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:16,281
And they're willing
to give you a nice long lease.

1078
01:02:16,385 --> 01:02:17,624
How long a lease?

1079
01:02:17,729 --> 01:02:20,017
Really long.
And I'm gonna send it over,

1080
01:02:20,121 --> 01:02:21,844
- and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1081
01:02:21,844 --> 01:02:23,962
Why are they giving me
a long lease now?

1082
01:02:24,066 --> 01:02:27,752
That's a terrible story. The tenant
was in some kind of coma or something,

1083
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:31,171
and it is what it is,
so they're gonna pull the plug.

1084
01:02:31,276 --> 01:02:34,382
But get this: They are gonna
throw in that couch you like.

1085
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,407
- David?
- What?

1086
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:39,185
We gotta go talk to your sister.

1087
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,093
Why? What are you gonna say to her?

1088
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:43,347
I don't know. What kind of dirt
do you have on her?

1089
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:45,667
Her middle name is Ellen.

1090
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:48,853
In the third grade she told everybody
it was Leia, like Princess Leia.

1091
01:02:48,957 --> 01:02:49,896
All right.  What else?

1092
01:02:51,947 --> 01:02:53,638
She's lactose intolerant.

1093
01:02:53,742 --> 01:02:55,827
All right, look, the only way
this is gonna work

1094
01:02:55,827 --> 01:02:57,944
is if I could tell her something
that only you know.

1095
01:02:58,048 --> 01:03:00,480
Something so intimate, something so personal...

1096
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:05,407
She French-kissed her ex-boyfriend J.J.
five minutes before her wedding.

1097
01:03:05,511 --> 01:03:07,293
Oh, that'll work. That's good.

1098
01:03:07,293 --> 01:03:09,995
- Nobody knows that.
- That... I think I like her already.

1099
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:20,528
So, how did you know Elizabeth?
You must've worked together.

1100
01:03:20,528 --> 01:03:24,016
- God knows she wasn't dating anybody.
- Everybody likes to rub that one in.

1101
01:03:24,016 --> 01:03:26,824
Actually, this is gonna be
a little difficult to swallow...

1102
01:03:27,642 --> 01:03:29,300
Tea!

1103
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,443
My nieces are here?
They're supposed to be at school.

1104
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:34,220
- Hi.
- Would you like some tea, sir?

1105
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,923
Well, yes, thank you, madam.

1106
01:03:36,923 --> 01:03:39,559
Abort. Don't do this in front of them,
it's gonna freak them out.

1107
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:42,402
I'm sorry, you were saying?
How did you know her?

1108
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,603
- Lie your butt off.
- We worked together.

1109
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:45,810
- No!
- No.

1110
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,539
No, no, no. You're not credible as a doctor.
Just make something up.

1111
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:52,292
I mean, I didn't work with her.
We worked together on my illness.

1112
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:53,669
I was a patient of hers.

1113
01:03:53,669 --> 01:03:56,569
Lily? Can you see me?

1114
01:03:56,569 --> 01:03:58,687
I was sick. I had meningitis.

1115
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:00,846
Spiral meningitis.

1116
01:04:00,846 --> 01:04:02,363
I'm so sorry.

1117
01:04:02,363 --> 01:04:04,308
Spiral meningitis?
It's not a disease.

1118
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:06,759
Oh, no, it's OK.
I'm much better now.

1119
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:07,567
I...

1120
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:10,357
Elizabeth, she believed in me,

1121
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:13,396
believed that I would recover
when nobody else did.

1122
01:04:13,396 --> 01:04:14,548
And then I did.

1123
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:16,924
That sounds just like her.

1124
01:04:17,028 --> 01:04:20,081
But why are you telling me this?

1125
01:04:21,092 --> 01:04:25,363
Because I know about
Elizabeth's situation,

1126
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:27,280
and I just wanna say that...

1127
01:04:27,943 --> 01:04:29,364
Lily.

1128
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:31,883
...there are things going on ...
- You know I'm here, don't you?

1129
01:04:31,883 --> 01:04:33,309
...sometimes that...

1130
01:04:34,544 --> 01:04:36,570
...that are beyond our understanding.

1131
01:04:38,188 --> 01:04:41,108
And so, I just wanted to ask you...

1132
01:04:41,212 --> 01:04:43,968
Actually, I just want to beg you

1133
01:04:44,072 --> 01:04:47,144
to... to give her
a little bit more time.

1134
01:04:47,857 --> 01:04:49,479
She's gonna pull through this thing.

1135
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:51,605
I just know it.

1136
01:04:51,605 --> 01:04:53,304
That's really sweet of you to say,

1137
01:04:53,304 --> 01:04:56,689
but... it's kinda too late.

1138
01:04:56,689 --> 01:04:57,414
Abby.

1139
01:04:57,414 --> 01:04:59,230
- What do you mean?
- Abby, what did you do?

1140
01:05:00,448 --> 01:05:02,216
It's David, right?

1141
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:07,502
You see, it's too late because
I've already signed the papers.

1142
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:10,212
Abby. I'm here.

1143
01:05:10,316 --> 01:05:12,180
Can you feel me? I'm right here.

1144
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:15,003
We're terminating life support
tomorrow at noon,

1145
01:05:15,107 --> 01:05:16,979
while the girls are in school.

1146
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:20,623
I mean, the past three months
have been so hard on them,

1147
01:05:20,623 --> 01:05:21,890
on this whole family.

1148
01:05:21,994 --> 01:05:24,138
Well, I understand that. I really do.

1149
01:05:24,138 --> 01:05:26,230
But I think you're makin'
a grave mistake here,

1150
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:29,283
- because I really believe...
- It's for the best. Really.

1151
01:05:29,977 --> 01:05:31,836
This is what Elizabeth wanted.

1152
01:05:32,999 --> 01:05:36,747
I mean, I spent my whole life thinking
I knew what was best for her.

1153
01:05:36,747 --> 01:05:40,225
What she should wear,
what men she should date.

1154
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,811
This is the last thing
Elizabeth asked for.

1155
01:05:45,363 --> 01:05:49,298
And for the first time in my life,
I'm gonna respect her wishes.

1156
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:52,885
Oh, Abby.

1157
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:54,853
Look.

1158
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:58,471
This is gonna sound
really strange to you, but...

1159
01:05:59,239 --> 01:05:59,683
Oh, no, no, no.

1160
01:05:59,683 --> 01:06:02,333
...the truth is Elizabeth
is here with us right now.

1161
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,825
She came here with me. She's standing
next to you, and she's begging you to wait.

1162
01:06:06,803 --> 01:06:08,052
Right next to me?

1163
01:06:09,195 --> 01:06:10,864
- Right there.
- David, stop.

1164
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,315
No, let me do this.
I don't know how or why,

1165
01:06:13,315 --> 01:06:15,415
but somehow I can see
your sister's spirit.

1166
01:06:15,415 --> 01:06:17,993
I know it's crazy,
but I also can talk to her.

1167
01:06:17,993 --> 01:06:21,928
So why don't I have her just
explain the whole thing to you,

1168
01:06:21,928 --> 01:06:23,489
and I'll translate.

1169
01:06:26,347 --> 01:06:29,092
Could you just hold on, just a sec?

1170
01:06:31,572 --> 01:06:34,699
OK, tea party's over.
Time for Wiggly Safari!

1171
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,358
Yeah!

1172
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,329
- OK, David, this could work.
- I think I was getting through to her.

1173
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,998
- You need to get her straight to the hospital.
- Right to the hospital.

1174
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:47,275
- We'll get her to rip those papers...
- Get the hell outta here, you freak!

1175
01:06:49,377 --> 01:06:51,453
I'm not makin' this up!
Why would I?

1176
01:06:51,453 --> 01:06:53,163
Abby, calm down,
just calm down!

1177
01:06:53,268 --> 01:06:55,775
I'll chop you!
I swear, I will chop you!

1178
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:57,416
- Tell about J.J.
- I know about J.J.

1179
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:00,060
- What?
- I know what you did with J.J. in your wedding...

1180
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:00,959
and I'll tell everybody.

1181
01:07:02,378 --> 01:07:04,637
How do you know that?
Nobody knows that!

1182
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:06,780
Get outta here! Get going!

1183
01:07:11,899 --> 01:07:14,851
You kids OK?

1184
01:07:15,748 --> 01:07:19,288
Mommy, is Auntie Elizabeth
gonna have more tea?

1185
01:07:21,556 --> 01:07:22,407
What?

1186
01:07:35,649 --> 01:07:39,137
Wow, I don't think your sister's
a very spiritual person.

1187
01:07:39,704 --> 01:07:40,795
She's just bein' a good mom.

1188
01:07:40,899 --> 01:07:42,880
Tryin' to keep her kids away
from a crazy guy.

1189
01:07:48,186 --> 01:07:50,401
I think I would have liked
to have been a mom.

1190
01:07:50,506 --> 01:07:51,819
You'd make a good one.

1191
01:07:52,593 --> 01:07:54,329
Thanks.

1192
01:07:56,488 --> 01:07:58,482
Guess I'll never really know.

1193
01:07:58,586 --> 01:08:01,051
Come on, Lizzie. This can't be it.

1194
01:08:01,155 --> 01:08:03,536
- Lizzie?
- OK, I'm sorry.

1195
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,937
I know you don't like
to be called that.

1196
01:08:05,837 --> 01:08:07,064
I'm warming up to it.

1197
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:09,540
I can go to that hospital.

1198
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:12,299
I could talk to your friend, Fran.
I could...

1199
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:14,618
- No, David.
...talk to the asshole guy.

1200
01:08:14,618 --> 01:08:17,995
- Brett? Yes.
- No, David, just stop. They'll put you in a straitjacket.

1201
01:08:17,995 --> 01:08:20,246
There's no way anyone's
gonna believe I'm still here.

1202
01:08:20,246 --> 01:08:23,065
Your niece!  Your niece, the little girl.
She saw you.

1203
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:23,898
Oh, great.

1204
01:08:24,846 --> 01:08:26,844
My fate's in the hands
of a four-year-old

1205
01:08:26,844 --> 01:08:28,627
who has seven other
imaginary friends.

1206
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:32,220
Wait. There is someone else.

1207
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,295
What do you mean?

1208
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:35,305
Come on.

1209
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:38,859
- Darryl!
- Dude.

1210
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:41,727
- Yeah.
- Wow, the spirit's with you, isn't it?

1211
01:08:41,727 --> 01:08:44,182
You can't bring that thing here.
What are you thinking, bro?

1212
01:08:44,182 --> 01:08:46,925
Listen, man, you were right about her.
She's alive.

1213
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:48,043
Righteous.

1214
01:08:48,043 --> 01:08:50,636
She's in a coma. Her family's
gonna take her off life support.

1215
01:08:50,636 --> 01:08:52,345
Not so righteous.

1216
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:55,339
So, what, are you guys
socializing now?

1217
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:59,200
We've... acclimated.

1218
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,525
Yeah, I can tell.

1219
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:06,987
In fact, I'm sensin' some pretty
intense feelings she has for you, bro.

1220
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:09,563
- Really?
- No, I don't.

1221
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:13,000
Major red aura.
Somebody's embarrassed.

1222
01:09:13,104 --> 01:09:15,693
- I am not. Can we focus here?
- OK.

1223
01:09:15,797 --> 01:09:19,000
- Ask him if there's a spell...
- Or a chant, electric shot, ... anything to get...

1224
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,458
- My spirit...
...back into her body?

1225
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:23,268
Wow, you're totally asking the wrong question, man.

1226
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:24,535
Why is that wrong?

1227
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:27,770
Look, I have the gift.

1228
01:09:28,315 --> 01:09:29,863
I didn't ask for it, but I do.

1229
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:32,128
I can sense these things,

1230
01:09:32,128 --> 01:09:33,820
spirits, whatever
you wanna call 'em.

1231
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,022
Why they're hangin' here
in the first place?

1232
01:09:36,022 --> 01:09:39,375
- That's their unfinished business.
- So, do I have the gift?

1233
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,693
Dude, please.
You definitely don't have it.

1234
01:09:42,797 --> 01:09:44,135
You're a civilian.

1235
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:47,797
But if I don't have it,
how is it that I can see her

1236
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:49,532
and talk to her
when no one else can?

1237
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:52,242
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

1238
01:09:52,346 --> 01:09:54,517
That's the right question.

1239
01:09:54,979 --> 01:09:57,302
What the hell is he talking about?

1240
01:09:58,015 --> 01:10:00,117
God, I feel like it's
right there in front of us.

1241
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:01,533
I just can't get a handle on it.

1242
01:10:01,638 --> 01:10:04,969
How do you solve a problem
that isn't possible in the first place?

1243
01:10:05,073 --> 01:10:07,737
Because nothing seems
impossible to me anymore.

1244
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:11,565
I mean, why did I move into
your apartment in the first place?

1245
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,924
Why can I see you
when no one else can?

1246
01:10:15,029 --> 01:10:18,031
I mean, why was I down in that
restaurant when that guy collapsed?

1247
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,057
It all seems interrelated somehow.

1248
01:10:21,057 --> 01:10:23,024
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1249
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:26,060
I feel like I missed something here.
Wait a second.

1250
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,897
Rosemary Preston lives
right here in San Francisco.

1251
01:10:29,406 --> 01:10:30,623
We could go talk to her.

1252
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,157
I'll call Information.
Maybe she's listed.

1253
01:10:33,157 --> 01:10:34,057
Where did you get this?

1254
01:10:36,943 --> 01:10:38,428
It was just at the hospital.

1255
01:10:39,673 --> 01:10:41,375
Yeah. I...

1256
01:10:43,392 --> 01:10:44,517
I took it.

1257
01:10:46,636 --> 01:10:47,961
I'm sorry. I...

1258
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:49,013
I just...

1259
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:51,431
I wanted to have a picture of you.

1260
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:55,540
I wasn't sure that I was
gonna ever see you again.

1261
01:10:56,303 --> 01:10:57,558
I'm sorry.

1262
01:10:57,662 --> 01:10:59,756
No. Don't be sorry.

1263
01:11:02,973 --> 01:11:05,008
That's really nice.

1264
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:07,861
I really like that picture.

1265
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:11,926
Yeah. Yeah, I liked it too.

1266
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:15,602
I had just gotten
my MCAT scores back.

1267
01:11:15,602 --> 01:11:17,813
Well, you must've done well.

1268
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:22,117
No, actually, I bombed.
My scores were so low

1269
01:11:22,117 --> 01:11:23,801
I couldn't even get into
correspondence school.

1270
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,318
- And that's a good thing?
- No.

1271
01:11:26,423 --> 01:11:30,354
I know it sounds kinda crazy.
I wanted to go back to the library

1272
01:11:30,354 --> 01:11:32,422
and start studying immediately,
but Abby said no.

1273
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:35,115
The only thing to do
was to burn my scores

1274
01:11:35,115 --> 01:11:37,623
and drink margaritas.

1275
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:40,394
Lots and lots of margaritas.

1276
01:11:40,498 --> 01:11:42,196
Well, looks like she was right.

1277
01:11:43,196 --> 01:11:47,534
It's just funny because the one time
I completely failed at something,

1278
01:11:47,534 --> 01:11:50,820
I had more fun
than I'd ever had in my life.

1279
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:54,037
You look happy.

1280
01:11:56,728 --> 01:11:58,998
I was happy.

1281
01:11:59,914 --> 01:12:01,866
But what was I doing
with the rest of my time?

1282
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,810
When I think about my life and I...

1283
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:07,802
All I can remember is working.

1284
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,376
You know? Working and working

1285
01:12:12,043 --> 01:12:13,644
and trying so hard.

1286
01:12:14,995 --> 01:12:16,921
And for what?

1287
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,514
You help people.

1288
01:12:19,248 --> 01:12:20,917
You save lives.

1289
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:23,692
Yeah. Including my own.

1290
01:12:23,796 --> 01:12:26,726
I saved my life, for later.

1291
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:30,671
I just...

1292
01:12:31,631 --> 01:12:33,995
I never thought
there wouldn't be a later.

1293
01:12:34,204 --> 01:12:37,118
No, don't say that.
There's still time.  Okay?

1294
01:12:37,118 --> 01:12:38,318
We're gonna see this lady...

1295
01:12:38,318 --> 01:12:41,513
You know, I just don't want
to spend my last night crying.

1296
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:45,516
Or... fighting my fate.

1297
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:48,967
I wanna do something with you.

1298
01:12:51,852 --> 01:12:54,221
OK. OK, great.

1299
01:12:54,325 --> 01:12:55,446
What do you want to do?

1300
01:12:55,655 --> 01:12:57,582
You want to fly to Paris?

1301
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:59,515
See the Eiffel Tower? No problem.

1302
01:12:59,515 --> 01:13:02,399
You wanna dance on a beach
in Bali? Let's go! Let's do it!

1303
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:03,767
Anywhere, anywhere in the world

1304
01:13:03,873 --> 01:13:06,561
that will take MasterCard or Visa.

1305
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:07,978
Anywhere.

1306
01:13:09,378 --> 01:13:12,396
There is something
that I would like to do.

1307
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,070
Anything.

1308
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:18,913
I'm so bad at this.

1309
01:13:19,546 --> 01:13:20,956
What? What is it?

1310
01:13:30,379 --> 01:13:32,314
Are you nervous?

1311
01:13:33,815 --> 01:13:35,906
- A little.
- Why?

1312
01:13:36,841 --> 01:13:38,401
I don't know.

1313
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,353
How can you be nervous
when I can't even touch you?

1314
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:47,514
I think I'm more nervous
because you can't touch me.

1315
01:13:48,073 --> 01:13:49,850
Why?

1316
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:54,451
You know in the hospital
when you touched my hand?

1317
01:13:55,526 --> 01:13:57,035
I felt it.

1318
01:13:57,844 --> 01:14:00,928
I mean, my spirit felt it.

1319
01:14:01,509 --> 01:14:03,405
I don't know how.

1320
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,454
But I think if you could
ever really touch me...

1321
01:14:09,588 --> 01:14:12,081
...I might wake up from all of this.

1322
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,462
I can almost feel that.

1323
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:34,324
Me too.

1324
01:14:35,266 --> 01:14:38,385
I think I know what
my unfinished business is.

1325
01:14:38,489 --> 01:14:39,445
What?

1326
01:14:41,386 --> 01:14:43,455
You.

1327
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,997
Elizabeth.

1328
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:12,366
Elizabeth?

1329
01:15:13,574 --> 01:15:15,075
- Elizabeth?!
- I'm right here.

1330
01:15:15,284 --> 01:15:17,928
Oh, good, good.
I thought you were gone.

1331
01:15:18,662 --> 01:15:20,371
Suddenly I know
what I'm supposed to do,

1332
01:15:20,476 --> 01:15:22,014
because this time
I can do something.

1333
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,582
What are you talking about?

1334
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:27,168
Lizzie, when we first met,
I kept saying that you were dead.

1335
01:15:27,377 --> 01:15:29,827
But it was me that was dead,
and you brought me back.

1336
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:31,994
You saved me.

1337
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,429
And now it's my turn to save you.

1338
01:15:35,389 --> 01:15:36,114
How?

1339
01:15:36,322 --> 01:15:37,588
I'm gonna steal your body.

1340
01:15:38,957 --> 01:15:40,482
David.

1341
01:15:41,491 --> 01:15:45,868
David. David, what are you thinking?
You can't do this!

1342
01:15:45,972 --> 01:15:48,045
- Why can't I?
- Because you'll go to jail.

1343
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:51,196
So what? If something happens to you,
you think I care where I'll be?

1344
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,247
At least this'll buy us
a little more time.

1345
01:15:55,172 --> 01:15:58,440
The things you'd have to know
to even start to pull this off...

1346
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,358
You know them.
You'll talk me through it.

1347
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:03,608
OK, you're gonna need a van.

1348
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:06,677
And somebody with no morals.

1349
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:17,826
- What are we movin' again?
- Medical supplies.

1350
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:20,227
You didn't tell him? You have to tell him.

1351
01:16:20,331 --> 01:16:22,353
You know,
he looks really familiar to me.

1352
01:16:22,353 --> 01:16:24,112
- You saw him at the bar.
- Saw who at the bar?

1353
01:16:24,216 --> 01:16:26,156
No one, never mind.
Here we go!

1354
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:32,127
OK, and we're in such a hurry
to move this stuff because why?

1355
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:35,712
There's a one-day sale on
hospital beds. I always wanted one.

1356
01:16:35,816 --> 01:16:38,182
Oh, great. Now you're
gonna become a bed potato.

1357
01:16:38,286 --> 01:16:40,573
- You've gotta tell this poor guy.
- Not yet.

1358
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,134
- Not yet what?
- We're not there yet.

1359
01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:44,660
OK, Dave, be honest with me.

1360
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:46,698
Has your imaginary friend
come out to play?

1361
01:16:55,122 --> 01:16:56,156
OK, grab a cart.

1362
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:58,942
You need a blood pressure cuff

1363
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:02,985
and a portable ventilator,
right there, that yellow thing.

1364
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:06,572
Dave, what the hell are you doing?
This isn't a sale, man!

1365
01:17:06,676 --> 01:17:09,309
All right. Okay. I knew
you wouldn't come if I told you.

1366
01:17:09,309 --> 01:17:13,319
- Do I really want to hear this?
- My imaginary friend is not imaginary.

1367
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:16,288
She is the spirit of a girl
in a coma upstairs

1368
01:17:16,288 --> 01:17:18,206
who they're about
to take off life support.

1369
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:20,433
We've got to get her someplace safe.

1370
01:17:20,433 --> 01:17:21,350
- Really?
- Really.

1371
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,078
- I knew you should've told him.
- He wouldn't have believed me.

1372
01:17:24,078 --> 01:17:26,138
- Does he believe you now?
- I had to get him into the hospital!

1373
01:17:26,138 --> 01:17:28,665
David, let me take you upstairs to the psych ward.

1374
01:17:28,665 --> 01:17:31,389
Okay?  There are people up there who can help you!

1375
01:17:31,389 --> 01:17:35,442
There's no time. It's 11:30 right now.
She's gonna be dead in half an hour!

1376
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:37,793
Tell him I know this is a stretch for him.

1377
01:17:37,793 --> 01:17:39,735
Elizabeth is standing
right behind you right now.

1378
01:17:39,735 --> 01:17:42,185
She said she knows what a stretch
this is for you.

1379
01:17:42,185 --> 01:17:44,822
Oh, does she?  If your friend's really behind me,

1380
01:17:44,822 --> 01:17:47,031
ask her what I'm doing:
Rock, paper or scissors?

1381
01:17:47,031 --> 01:17:48,283
- Rock.
- Rock.

1382
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:51,134
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

1383
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,167
- Paper.
- Paper.

1384
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:55,644
- Rock again.
- Rock again.

1385
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,786
- He's flipping me off.
- Are you flipping her off?

1386
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:00,939
- You're flipping her off!
- How?

1387
01:18:01,888 --> 01:18:04,506
OK. OK, sometimes
people with emotional

1388
01:18:04,506 --> 01:18:07,000
and mental disturbances
can have psychic moments.

1389
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:08,702
All right? But even if she was real,

1390
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,954
do you know what you're
risking for this woman?

1391
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:12,186
- Yes!
- Why?

1392
01:18:14,345 --> 01:18:15,996
Because I love her.

1393
01:18:16,622 --> 01:18:18,223
I love her.

1394
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:20,483
I do, I love you.

1395
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:23,618
No one's ever said that to me before.

1396
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,605
- David?
- What?

1397
01:18:32,605 --> 01:18:35,073
- Tell him thank you.
- We're really grateful, Jack.

1398
01:18:35,073 --> 01:18:36,323
I'm not doin' it for you.

1399
01:18:36,323 --> 01:18:38,107
Then why are you doing it?

1400
01:18:38,211 --> 01:18:41,146
Because someday, trust me,
I'm gonna need help movin' a body.

1401
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,831
When that day comes,
I don't wanna hear any shit from you.

1402
01:18:47,577 --> 01:18:49,583
OK, get me on the gurney, quick.

1403
01:18:49,687 --> 01:18:51,378
Oh, my God. David.

1404
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:52,728
I know. She's pretty, right?

1405
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:54,654
That's really sweet,
but we've gotta go.

1406
01:18:54,758 --> 01:18:55,946
No, that's not it. This is her.

1407
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:58,456
This is her!  This is the woman I set you up with.

1408
01:18:58,456 --> 01:18:59,972
This is the woman you stood up that night!

1409
01:19:01,276 --> 01:19:03,172
I ... I was gonna meet Elizabeth?

1410
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:05,962
And she didn't make it either,
because she had an accident.

1411
01:19:07,616 --> 01:19:08,509
It was you.

1412
01:19:08,614 --> 01:19:10,185
Is that it? Is that why?

1413
01:19:10,289 --> 01:19:11,928
I was supposed to meet you.

1414
01:19:12,995 --> 01:19:14,429
How did you know her?

1415
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:16,891
I'm friends with her sister, Abby.
We went out years ago.

1416
01:19:16,995 --> 01:19:20,956
- I knew I'd seen him before. That's J. J!
- Jack is J. J?

1417
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:24,106
What did you-?
No one's called me J.J. since college.

1418
01:19:24,106 --> 01:19:25,999
He's older and hairier, but it's him.

1419
01:19:26,103 --> 01:19:28,505
He is the one who tongued Abby
at the wedding?

1420
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:30,542
How the hell did you know that?
Nobody knows that.

1421
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:31,577
Jack, it's Elizabeth.

1422
01:19:31,681 --> 01:19:35,010
- Oh, my God. She really is here.  Isn't she?
- I told you!

1423
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:38,013
Well, let's get her on the gurney!
I don't want them killing Abby's sister!

1424
01:19:38,013 --> 01:19:39,105
- Thank you.
-  Come on.

1425
01:19:39,105 --> 01:19:40,047
OK. Be really gentle.

1426
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,550
Yeah, I'm here already.

1427
01:19:44,883 --> 01:19:47,235
- That's Brett.
- He's 15 minutes early!

1428
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,735
- As soon as the sister shows, we're ready.
- I think he's comin' in.

1429
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,917
That's OK. All right.

1430
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:54,460
- Careful, David.  He's really smart. His name is...
- Dr. Rushton?

1431
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,867
- Yeah.
- Well, hi, David Abbott.

1432
01:19:56,867 --> 01:19:58,962
Buy some time.
Tell him you're a doctor.

1433
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,197
I'm a doctor.

1434
01:20:00,197 --> 01:20:02,140
You're a special consultant
from PAC Medical.

1435
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,675
I'm a special consultant
from PAC Medical.

1436
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:07,893
Dr. Walsh sent me down
for a final evaluation.

1437
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,887
I had no verbal or written
instructions to that end.

1438
01:20:11,991 --> 01:20:14,518
Tell him there's new evidence
to support that full...

1439
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:18,120
Functionality can be restored.
We need to run some tests.

1440
01:20:18,704 --> 01:20:19,593
Who's we?

1441
01:20:19,697 --> 01:20:21,661
Tell him your team is downstairs.

1442
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:25,014
My team is downstairs with
a signed order from Dr. Walsh.

1443
01:20:25,723 --> 01:20:27,660
- You got it.
- This is the first I've heard of this.

1444
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,004
You won't mind
if I talk to Dr. Walsh?

1445
01:20:29,004 --> 01:20:31,393
Oh, no.  Go ahead. Go confirm with him.
We'll wait right here.

1446
01:20:31,497 --> 01:20:33,899
I'll just get him on the phone.

1447
01:20:36,895 --> 01:20:40,019
- David!
- OK, I'm not convincing as a doctor!

1448
01:20:40,124 --> 01:20:42,505
Oh, God, David,
the felonies just keep pilin' up!

1449
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:44,110
- That way, David.
- Go this way.

1450
01:20:45,669 --> 01:20:47,644
- Brett!
- What happened?

1451
01:20:47,749 --> 01:20:48,602
Are you OK?

1452
01:20:49,353 --> 01:20:51,821
This is Dr. Rushton.
I need security on the third floor.

1453
01:20:51,925 --> 01:20:54,581
Don's jostle. But go faster.

1454
01:20:54,685 --> 01:20:57,257
- Take a right up here.
- Right here! Right, right, right!

1455
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:03,001
The elevator!

1456
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,287
Hold it! We need you to...

1457
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,326
Oh, shit.

1458
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:18,520
Stop right there!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Hold it!

1459
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:20,997
Come on! Hey, hey, hey!

1460
01:21:21,101 --> 01:21:24,004
- David.
- Elizabeth.

1461
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,655
Oh, my God, David.
My breathing tube is gone.

1462
01:21:26,759 --> 01:21:28,232
What? No!

1463
01:21:28,336 --> 01:21:31,976
- Well, what can I do?
- It's too late. It's happening.

1464
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,727
- No.
- It's strong.

1465
01:21:33,831 --> 01:21:34,774
Be stronger.

1466
01:21:34,878 --> 01:21:36,500
It's pulling me away.

1467
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:37,674
No!

1468
01:21:37,778 --> 01:21:39,009
Stay with me!

1469
01:21:48,652 --> 01:21:49,778
I got ya.

1470
01:21:49,778 --> 01:21:51,930
Elizabeth!

1471
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,106
- No!
- David.

1472
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:55,975
- Give me a sedative!
- Help her!

1473
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:58,687
- Gimme five of Haldol.
- Help her! Elizabeth!

1474
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:00,667
- Hold him.
- No! Elizabeth!

1475
01:22:10,565 --> 01:22:12,550
What's going on?

1476
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:14,803
- That's not possible.
- Yeah.

1477
01:22:14,907 --> 01:22:16,009
That's not possible.

1478
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:22,072
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?

1479
01:22:22,176 --> 01:22:25,241
I can't believe
we almost let you go.

1480
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:29,476
Honey? It's me, Abby.

1481
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:31,462
- Abby.
- Yeah.

1482
01:22:36,898 --> 01:22:38,506
I think I bumped my head.

1483
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:44,137
It's OK.

1484
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,057
Hey.

1485
01:22:58,162 --> 01:22:59,500
Hello.

1486
01:23:00,587 --> 01:23:03,185
It's me.

1487
01:23:03,497 --> 01:23:05,643
I'm sorry, I don't...

1488
01:23:05,643 --> 01:23:10,230
Honey, it's David.
You don't remember David?

1489
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,882
The apartment.

1490
01:23:14,874 --> 01:23:16,499
The rooftop.

1491
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:18,842
Garden.

1492
01:23:19,259 --> 01:23:21,108
Nothin'.

1493
01:23:34,894 --> 01:23:37,214
Honey, you don't
remember him at all?

1494
01:24:43,358 --> 01:24:45,464
- Aunt Elizabeth, come on!
- Come on!

1495
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,971
We only rented it for a month.

1496
01:26:13,075 --> 01:26:15,923
- Did you move something?
- No.

1497
01:26:20,474 --> 01:26:22,501
It's funny. I just have
this strange feeling,

1498
01:26:21,459 --> 01:26:24,286
like... something's missing.

1499
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:26,620
Everything's here, just as you left it.

1500
01:26:28,964 --> 01:26:30,698
I guess it's just been a long time.

1501
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,294
You sure you're gonna be OK?

1502
01:26:33,398 --> 01:26:34,987
Yeah. I'm gonna be good.

1503
01:26:35,092 --> 01:26:38,298
- So I'll see you guys Saturday.
- OK. The girls'll bake for you.

1504
01:28:06,289 --> 01:28:07,298
Hi.

1505
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:12,651
Don't worry, I'm...

1506
01:28:14,051 --> 01:28:16,778
I just wanted you
to have your garden.

1507
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:22,913
How did you get up here?

1508
01:28:24,363 --> 01:28:28,124
Spare key.
Under the fire extinguisher.

1509
01:28:34,621 --> 01:28:36,680
Look, the last thing
I want to do is scare you.

1510
01:28:38,607 --> 01:28:40,333
Goodbye, Lizzie.

1511
01:28:45,183 --> 01:28:46,271
Wait.

1512
01:28:49,177 --> 01:28:49,837
Yeah?

1513
01:28:55,607 --> 01:28:57,673
The key. I need the key back.

1514
01:28:57,778 --> 01:28:59,442
Oh, right.

1515
01:29:08,332 --> 01:29:10,216
How do I know you?

1516
01:29:10,825 --> 01:29:13,050
Maybe from your dreams.

1517
01:29:20,347 --> 01:29:22,333
If you could ever really touch me,

1518
01:29:22,437 --> 01:29:24,233
