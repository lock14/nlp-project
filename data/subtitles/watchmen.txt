00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,111
<i>Wrong, as usual.</i>

2
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:30,155
<i>The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe proves</i>

3
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,868
<i>that the Soviet Union's aggression
at the Afghan border</i>

4
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:37,204
<i>will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.</i>

5
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:44,795
<i>Issue, the Soviet Union continued
its recent series of military exercises,</i>

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,006
<i>conducting</i> a <i>bomb test today
in the Bering Sea,</i>

7
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,594
<i>just 1,500 miles off the southern coast
of Alaska.</i>

8
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,725
<i>President Richard Nixon issued
this warning to the Soviets...</i>

9
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:00,520
The United States does not start fights.

10
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:06,025
Let it be clear, we maintain our strength
in order to maintain peace.

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,406
So any adversary
should ask themselves,

12
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,492
"Do the consequences
of attacking America

13
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,036
"outweigh the potential benefits?"

14
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:20,039
As a result of the Soviet activity,

15
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:22,876

of nuclear scientists

destruction by nuclear war.

18
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,846
<i>Question,</i>

19
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,057
on a scale of zero to ten,
zero meaning impossibility,

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,685
ten meaning complete
metaphysical certitude,

21
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,397
what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?

22
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,941
Pat Buchanan.

23
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:50,986
Zero. The Soviets would never risk
going to war,

24
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,283
when we have
a walking nuclear deterrent on our side.

25
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,868
You're referring, of course,
to Dr Manhattan.

26
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,996
<i>But does Dr Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace?</i>

27
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,290
<i>Eleanor Clift.</i>

28
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,918
<i>Well, it hasn't stopped the Soviet Union</i>

29
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:09,756
<i>from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.</i>

30
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,382
You don't think it's all just posturing?

31
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:16,179
Maybe the reason why
the Soviets are doing these bomb tests

32
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:20,641
is because they feel threatened
by Dr Manhattan, cornered.

33
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,062
<i>Maybe the whole world feels like that.</i>

34
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,817
<i>Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters...</i>

35
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,980
Just a matter of time, I suppose.

36
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,324
It's a joke. It's all a joke.

37
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,701
Mother, forgive me.

38
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,778
That is what I had before!
I was a hero, God damn it!

39
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:54,493
<i>An act clearly meant to send
a signal to the government in Saigon</i>

40

00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,195
<i>Good luck, Mr Gorsky.</i>

42
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,201
Get out of here, vigilantes!

43
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,166
They're killers!

44
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,201
Edward Blake. 67 years old.

45
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,828
6'2". A solid 225.

46
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,331
The guy was built like a linebacker.

47
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,334
Yeah, I saw the body.

48
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,628
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

49
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,172
You mean, apart from being dead?

50
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,341
That's plate glass.

51
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,302
You have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

52
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,554
He had to have been thrown.

53
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,140
- Check the bedroom?
- Yeah.

54
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:07,561
Drawers opened, tossed through.
Mattress flipped.

55
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,230
Probably robbery.

56
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,941
Or made to look like one. See this?

57
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,692
Shaking hands with the President.

58
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,988
Whoa! You think Blake was a spook?

59
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,450
Government or black ops?

60
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,831
I think this is way bigger than both of us.

Pirate outfits, ghosts.

83
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,592
They thought it was funny,
dress up and pull heists.

84
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,429
Of course, as soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street again.

85
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:33,517
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
'cause of the damn masks.

86
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,437
So, a few of us cops,
we get together and we figure,

87
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,482
"What the heck? We'll mask up, too.
We'll finish what the law couldn't."

88
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,114
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it.
They ran with it

89
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,200
and, oh, boy, we're a national pastime.

90
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,621
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman,

91
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:58,042
Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice,

92
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,544
Silk Spectre and The Comedian.

93
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,173
Don't get me started on him.

94
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:11,471
I must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.

95
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,265
I think you were trying to make a point.

96
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,227
Well, my point is
that we had it too easy.

97
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,480
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys,

98
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,899
you guys who picked up
where we left off,

99
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,152
with Nixon forcing you out.

100
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,613
Nixon, that prick.

101
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,573
And to think I voted
for that prick five times.

102
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,118
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

103
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,332
Wow, it's almost midnight. I ought to go.

104
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,586
Truth?

105
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,423
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.

106
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,009
Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.

107
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:52,763
Hey, watch with the language.

108
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,557
This is the left hook that floored
Captain Axis, remember?

109
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,351
Next week?

110
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:03,774
Well, you know, you don't have
to keep humouring me like this.

111
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,567
If you got a hot date or something...

112
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:10,071
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?

113
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,157
You ever miss it?

114
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,247
- No. You?
- No. Heck, no.

115
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll be seeing you.

116
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,939
- Hello, Daniel.
- Rorschach.

117
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,276
Helped myself to some beans.

118
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,693
Hope you don't mind.

119
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,572
No, no. Of course not.

120
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,242
You want me to heat those up for you?

121
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,037
Fine like this.

122
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,457
How have you been keeping?

123
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,628
Out of prison.

124
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,672
So far.

125
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,509
Daniel, look at this.

126
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,604
- Is this bean juice?
- Human bean juice.

127
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,023
Badge belonged to The Comedian.
Blood, too.

128
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,107
He's dead.

129
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,569
Let's talk downstairs.

130
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,280
It could have been a burglary.

131
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,034
Maybe the killer didn't know
who The Comedian was.

132
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:24,373
An ordinary burglar kill
The Comedian? Ridiculous.

133
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:29,044
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77,

134
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,381
knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

135
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,467
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

136
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,009
Maybe.

137
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:40,388
Or maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

138
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,682
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

139
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:46,854
That what they say about me now?
Paranoid?

140
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:51,567
Look, Comedian made a lot of enemies
over the years, even among his friends.

141
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,694
Speaking of friends,
how's Hollis Mason?

142
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:58,865
He wrote that book, said some
bad things about The Comedian in it.

143
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:03,287
I don't like what you're implying.
And I like being followed even less.

144
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,958
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someones gunning for masks.

145
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,542
You were never that sentimental.

146
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,461
An attack on one is
an attack on all of us.

147
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,673
What do you suggest we do about it?

148
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,925
Retribution.

149
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,804
Watchmen are over.

150
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,388
Says Tricky Dick.

151
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,973
Says me.

152
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,686
Nobody knows who you are.

153
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,731
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

154
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,984
That what you have now? A normal life?

155
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:40,073
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies,

156
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,532
past the human cockroaches

157
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,786
talking about their heroin
and child pornography,

158
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,497
do you really feel normal?

159
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,000
At least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

160
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,211
No.

161
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,507
You're hiding in plain sight.

162
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,551
Be seeing you, Dan.

163
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,721
There's a maintenance hatch
that will let you out two blocks north.

164
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,766
Yeah, I remember.

165
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,185
Came here often
when we were partners.

166
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,355
Those were great times,
huh, Rorschach?

167
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,025
- What happened?
- You quit.

168
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,015
Mr Veidt, to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen

169
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,393
ever to reveal their true identity
to the world,

170
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,686
the first being Hollis Mason.

171
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,897
And you've certainly
profited greatly by it,

172
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,026
turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias,

173
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,319
into a billion-dollar industry.

174
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,323
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering...

175
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,701
I understand
there's even a movie in the works.

176
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,036
I'm not hearing a question, Mr Roth.

177
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,122
I'm sorry. Do you think...

178
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,708
The other Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

179
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,751
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind

180
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,922
some of my old colleagues
might see it that way,

181
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:24,594
just as you're clearly aware that biased
journalism sells more magazines.

182
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,181
The merchandising arm
of Veidt Industries is funding

183
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:29,682
our work with Dr Manhattan.

184
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,978
Now, we recently expanded
our research facility in Antarctica

185
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,647
in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy,

186
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,817
that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

187
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,528
Now, it doesn't take a political scientist

188
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,906
to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological,

189
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,243
it's based upon fear,
fear of not having enough.

190
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,457
But if we make resources infinite,

191
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,211
we make war obsolete.

192
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,423
Iwould hope
the other Watchmen understand that,

193
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,094
wherever they may be.

194
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,765
Thanks for your time.

195
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,896
You look good, Adrian.

196
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,607
Dan, it's been too long.

197
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:26,155
S0, Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

198
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,076
You think it's possible?

199
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,913
I think, statistically,
one murder doesn't equal a trend.

200
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,414
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

201
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:39,001
I mean, so was The Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

202
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,922
You know that better than anyone.

203
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,173
I'm not here 'cause I miss him.

204
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,674
Well, it's obviously occurred
to Rorschach

205
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,221
that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

206
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:53,892
Actually, the whole world knows yours.
That's why I'm warning you first.

207
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,855
Thank you, Dan.

208
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,361
But I fear there's something
much more real to worry about

209
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,489
than Rorschach's mask-killer.

210
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:14,621
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

211
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,290
The Soviets have
51,000 warheads stockpiled.

212
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,711
Even if Jon stops 99% of them,

213
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:26,048
the 1% that get through can still kill
every living thing on Earth.

214
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,596
Even Dr Manhattan can't be
everywhere at once.

215
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:51,031
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 13, 1985.</i>

00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,409
<i>8:30 p. m.</i>

00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,372
<i>Meeting with Dreiberg left
bad taste in mouth.</i>

218

<i>A flabby failure

219
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:07,339
<i>Why are so few of us

220
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,094
<i>and without personality disorders?</i>

221

<i>The first Nite Owl

<i>I shall go tell the indestructible man

232
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,191
Good evening, Rorschach.

233
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,903
Dr Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

234
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,278
Yes.

235
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,699
But you're going to leave disappointed.

236
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:18,577
Rorschach! You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

237
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:21,038
Nice to see you, too, Silk Spectre.

238
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,334
I have a real name I've been using
a couple of years now. Try it.

239
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,752
Whatever you say, Laurie.

240
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,128
What are you doing here?

241
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,589
The Comedian is dead.

242
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,093
Rorschach wants me to look
into my future,

243
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,636
see if the killer is
ever publicly identified.

244
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,057
I already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you, too.

245
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,769
Even if I wanted to help,

246
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:48,775
my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

247
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,402
I cannot see it clearly.

248
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,028
Interference? Caused by what?

249
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:56,324
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

250
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:01,453
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war,

251
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:05,625
the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons,

252
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:09,921
particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time,

253
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,300
therefore obscuring
my vision of the present.

254
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,054
- I must return to my work.
- Wait a minute.

255
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,932
What if that's why someone wants us
out of the way?

256
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:23,309
So we can't do anything to stop it?

257
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,269
Good bye, Rorschach.

258
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,314
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

259
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,065
I'm not leaving

260
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,277
till I've had my say!

261
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:43,246
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days, Jon.

262
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,374
I didn't want to worry you prematurely.

263
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:50,711
If Adrian and I can solve
the energy crisis, war may be averted.

264
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,506
But you always say
that time is simultaneous.

265
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,509
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

266
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:00,680
If only you could perceive time as I do.

267
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,932
Please, let me show you.

268
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,856
Magic! Dreams!

269
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,318
That is what I had before!
I was a hero, God damn it!

270
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,153
It's not my fault you got old!

271
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,196
What do you have to complain about?

272
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,531
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child!

273
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,493
Why don't you call your friend Eddie?
Maybe he can give you a better life.

274
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,747
It was a mistake! One time!

275
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,290
- Guy tries to rape you...
- Stop!

276
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,172
Your mind goes to dark places and you
wonder why I keep the worst from you.

277
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:40,260
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?

278
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,642
You want to ask me
to go to dinner with you,

279
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,853
like we used to,

280
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,150
but you won't. You know I can't.

281
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:01,490
S0 you'll call Dan, which is only natural.

282
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,619
You deserve the comfort
of an old friend.

283
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,530
Dan Dreiberg's table?

284
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:05,888
Did you know that he and HJ were...
I had no idea.

285
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,307
You remember that crazy guy?

286
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:11,435
What did he call himself?
Captain Carnage.

287
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,020
Used to pretend he was a supervillain,

288
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:14,771
just so he could get beat up
all the time?

289
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,650
Yeah. He tried that on me once.
ljust walked away.

290
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,987
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight, yelling,

291
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,573
"Punish me! Punish me!"

292
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,366
And I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

293
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,578
God, whatever happened to him?

294
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:31,998
Well, he pulled that on Rorschach,

295
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,375
and Rorschach dropped him down
an elevator shaft.

296
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,301
- Oh, my God. That's not even funny.
- Yeah, it is.

297
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,430
- A little funny.
- A little bit.

298
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,560
It's really good to see you again.

299
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,230
It's great seeing you, too, Laurie.

300
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:59,233
Why'd we do it, Dan?
Dress up like that?

301
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:01,277
No one else would.

302
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,570
Yeah,
but do you remember my costume?

303
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,657
All that tight latex? I mean, it was awful.

304
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,326
Yeah, yeah, awful.

305
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,454
But I didn't want to disappoint Mother.

306
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:16,459
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

307
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:21,422
I think the Keene Act was
the best thing that ever happened to us.

308
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:24,424
Well, we'll live longer, anyway.

309
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:28,805
What?

310
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:34,269
Jon thinks, unless he can
do something about it,

311
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:38,772
that there's going to be nuclear war.
Soon.

312
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,901
But I don't know what to think.

313
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:46,573
I mean, it's all quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

314
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,617
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

315
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,122
He just keeps getting
further away from me.

316
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,249
Everyone.

317
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,127
I can't even tell if he actually cares
about me any more,

318
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,422
or if he's just pretending.

319
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:06,467
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

320
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,141
Hold on, I'll get the door.

321
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,809
Thanks, Dan.

322
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,270
- Got it?
- Yeah.

323
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:24,611
I'm sorry.

324
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,446
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs,

325
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,534
but there don't seem to be
that many laughs around these days.

326
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,413
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

327
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,967
Laurie? ls that you?

328
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,849
Thought you'd be used
to travelling that way by now.

329
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,684
Well, I'm not.

330
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,103
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

331
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:24,521
Well, it beats flying coach.

332
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,815
Margarita?

333
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,277
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

334
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:37,242
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

335
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:40,788
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana Bible.

336
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:44,791
It's a little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

337
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,585
- He sent you this?
- Sure.

338
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,380
They're very valuable, like antiques.

339
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:53,675
- Mother, this is gross!
- I think it's kind of flattering.

340
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,764
Why do you always call me "Mother"
when you're mad?

341
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:01,309
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

342
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,644
I saw it in the paper.

343
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:08,023
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

344
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,903
Finally got his punch line, I guess.

345
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:17,115
- Poor Eddie.
- Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

346
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,702
Laurie, you're still young.
You don't know.

347
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,498
Things change.

348
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,293
What happened
happened 40 years ago.

349
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,253
I'm 67 years old.

350
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:34,550
Every day,
the future looks a little bit darker.

351
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:40,222
But the past, even the grimy parts of it,

352
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,976
keep on getting brighter.

353
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,693
I've got spots in my eyes.

354
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,364
Let me fish those out for you.

355
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,324
Stop it, Eddie.

356
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,494
- Thank you, Weegee.
- Thank you, Mr Owl.

357
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:08,083
And tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

358
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,422
- Sounds good.
- Wow, a real photo session.

359
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,925
I wonder how my hair will look.

360
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,097
Go ahead. I'll be there in five.

361
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,155
Eddie.

362
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:43,786
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

363
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,621
Sure I did.

364
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,918
Come on, baby. I know what you need.

365
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,170
I mean, you got to have
some kind of reason

366
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,505
for dressing in an outfit like this.

367
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,340
I said no, Eddie.

368
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:03,347
- No, spelled Y-E-S.
- No, spelled N-O.

369
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,474
- All right?
- Come on, sweetheart.

370
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,523
Eddie...

371
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,646
You little bastard!

372
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,364
This what you like?
This what makes you hot?

373
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,157
What? Yeah!

374
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:17,088
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

375
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:20,840
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

376
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:24,804
The Comedian has a little bit of both.

377
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,226
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

378
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:34,646
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

379
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,150
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers,

380
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,070
but spare us, Lord most holy,

381
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,657
O God most mighty,
O holy and merciful Saviour.

382
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:49,202
Thou most worthyjudge eternal.

383
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,623
Suffer us not at our last hour for any...

384
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,472
Thank you! Thank you!

385
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,476
Fireworks. You got to be kidding me.

386
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:57,480
Now, you'd think this goddamn country
had enough fireworks.

387
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:03,485
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam,
I think it might have driven us crazy.

388
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,072
You know, as a country.

389
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:10,659
But we didn't, thanks to you.

390
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,954
You sound bitter.

391
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,168
Me? Bitter? Fuck, no.
I think it's hilarious.

392
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,804
- Jesus Christ.
- Mr Eddie?

393
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:31,429
Just what I fucking needed.

394
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:36,184
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

395
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,981
There's nothing to talk about.
You see, I'm leaving.

396
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:42,065
I'm going to forget about you

397
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,610
and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

398
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:49,447
- Get the fuck out of here.
- No.

399
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,659
- Get the fuck out of here!
- You will remember.

400
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:58,873
You will remember me
and my country forever!

401
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,378
My face!

402
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,257
Blake. Don't.

403
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:09,385
Blake!

404
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,226
She was pregnant.

405
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:23,148
- And you gunned her down.
- That's right.

406
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,233
And you know what? You watched me.

407
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,945
You could have turned the gun
into steam, the bullets into mercury,

408
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,824
the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

409
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:37,288
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

410
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,791
You're drifting out of touch, Doc.

411
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,253
God help us all.

412
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,922
Medic!

413
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,599
<i>Most holy and merciful Saviour.</i>

414
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:03,355
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

415
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,693
In the midst of life, we are in death.

416
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:09,862
Of whom may we...

417
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:12,322
Welcome to the first ever meeting...

418
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,949
This is all bullshit.

419
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,952
You know, for a guy
who calls himself The Comedian,

420
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:18,871
I can never tell when you're joking.

421
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:21,998
Watchmen, that's the real joke.

422
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,043
It didn't work 15 years ago,
it sure as hell ain't gonna work now,

423
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,545
just 'cause you want to keep playing
cowboys and Indians.

424
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,882
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

425
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,052
Look, Rorschach and I have made
real headway

426
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,221
on the gang problem
by working together.

427
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:38,724
With a group this size,
it seems like a publicity stunt.

428
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,309
I'm not in it for the ink.

429
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,896
We can do so much more.
We can save this world

430
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,650
with the right leadership.

431
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,150
Yeah.

432
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,405
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

433
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:56,659
I mean, hell, you're the smartest man
on the planet.

434
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:59,411
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

435
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,246
Yeah, but it takes a room full of morons

436
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,916
to think they're small enough
for you to handle.

437
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,833
You know, mankind's been
trying to kill each other off

438
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,961
since the beginning of time.

439
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:12,090
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

440
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:18,012
Ain't nothing gonna matter once those
nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

441
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:24,894
Then Ozymandias here will be
the smartest man on the cinder.

442
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,989
For as much as it hath pleased
almighty God

443
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:41,577
to take unto himself
the soul of our dear, departed brother,

444
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:45,873
let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.

445
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,545
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

446
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,969
Yeah!

447
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,436
Yeah!

448
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:11,567
We've got to get rid
of these Watchmen!

449
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,650
Police!

450
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:24,871
<i>Attention, citizens!
We are trying to maintain order!</i>

451
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:29,001
<i>You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over!</i>

452
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,545
<i>Please, there's no need for violence!</i>

453
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:35,882
God damn it.
All right, that's how you want to do it?

454
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,855
<i>There's no need for violence!</i>

455
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,148
FUCK you!

456
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,990
This is getting heavy.

457
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:27,809
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

458
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:30,396
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.

459
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,356
How long can we keep this up?

460
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,900
Congress is pushing through some
new bill that's gonna outlaw masks.

461
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,568
Our days are numbered.

462
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:41,824
Till then, it's like you always say,
we're society's only protection.

463
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:44,576
- From what?
- Are you kidding me?

464
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:47,829
From themselves. Son of a bitch.

465
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,706
No, Comedian, wait!

466
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,168
Get your stinking hands off me.

467
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,922
What the hell happened to us?

468
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,846
What happened
to the American dream?

469
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,432
What happened
to the American dream?

470
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:11,018
It came true! You're looking at it.

471
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:34,228
Edgar William Jacobi,

472
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:38,273
also known as Edgar William Vaughn,
also known as Moloch.

473
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,655
What are you talking about?

474
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,615
I'm a retired businessman...

475
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:52,119
Lie again, Moloch,
I break another finger.

476
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:55,998
I did my time. I'm not Moloch any more.

477
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,210
What do you want from me?

478
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,338
Heard you attended Blake's funeral.
Why?

479
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,715
I just felt I should

480
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,972
pay my respects to The Comedian.

481
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:13,934
How'd you know he was The Comedian?

482
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:18,688
He broke in here! A week ago.
He had his mask off.

483
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,108
He was drunk.

484
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,610
Enemies! For decades!

485
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:26,737
- Why should he visit you?
- I don't know.

486
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:29,782
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

487
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,996
He was upset! He was crying.

488
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:36,706
Crying? The Comedian?

489
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,085
<i>He was babbling,
not making any sense.</i>

490
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,336
<i>I was pissing in my pants.</i>

491
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,757
<i>I thought he was going to kill me.</i>

492
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,550
<i>What did he say?</i>

493
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,012
It's a joke.

494
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:53,849
It's all a fucking joke.

495
00:48:56,476 --> 00:49:01,148
You know, I thought I knew how it was.
I thought I knew how the world was.

496
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:05,443
I've done some bad things.

497
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:11,365
I did bad things to women.
I shot kids in Nam, you know.

498
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,494
But that was fucking war!

499
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:19,248
This... I never done anything like this.

500
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:27,048
God, here I am, spilling my guts

501
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:30,885
to one of my archenemies.

502
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:34,222
But the truth is...

503
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,391
The truth is,
you're the closest thing to a friend I got.

504
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:39,728
What the fuck does that say?

505
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:45,067
Shit.

506
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:50,572
And your name,
your name was on the list,

507
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:56,411
along with Janey,
whatever the fuck her name is.

508
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,413
Manhattan's old girl.

509
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,045
Mother, forgive me.

510
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,255
<i>And then he left.</i>

511
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:13,679
I swear I don't know what the hell
he was talking about.

512
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,769
Funny story.

513
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:24,773
Sounds unbelievable.

514
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:28,025
Probably true.

515
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,277
S0, that's it?

516
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,032
- L'm clean?
- You?

517
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:37,494
Clean?

518
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:47,878
Amygdalin. This is phoney medication
made from apricot pits. It's illegal.

519
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:49,505
Come on.

520
00:50:50,257 --> 00:50:53,885
Look, please don't confiscate that.

521
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,847
L'm trying anything-

522
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,976
I have cancer.

523
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,353
What kind of cancer?

524
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:04,938
Yeah?

525
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:08,400
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

526
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:12,112
That ain't the kind I got.

527
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:18,492
<i>Rorschach 's journal, October 16.</i>

00:51:22,456 --> 00:51:24,331
<i>Thought about Moloch's story.</i>

530
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:27,335
<i>- Come on, freak.

I make more in a week than you make
in a year, you fucking homo!

<i>But if it's true, what could have possibly
scared The Comedian enough</i>

535
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,476

536

00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,690
<i>And that list he mentioned...</i>

00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:55,947

<i>Only our enemies leave roses.</i>

543
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:15,007
<i>Violent lives ending violently.</i>

544
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:19,179
<i>Blake understood.</i>

545
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:21,889
<i>Humans are savage in nature.</i>

546
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:26,561
<i>No matter how much
you try to dress it up, to disguise it,</i>

547
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,023
<i>Blake saw society's true face.</i>

548
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:34,443
<i>Chose to be</i> a <i>parody of it. A joke.</i>

549
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:37,364
<i>I heard</i> a <i>joke once.</i>

550
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:41,659
<i>Man goes to doctor,
says he's depressed,</i>

551
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:45,496
<i>life seems harsh and cruel.</i>

552
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:49,376
<i>Says he feels all alone
in a threatening world.</i>

553
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,795
<i>Doctor says treatment is simple.</i>

554
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:59,552
<i>"The great clown Pagliacci is in town.
Go see him. That should pick you up."</i>

555
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,014
<i>Man bursts into tears.</i>

556
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:08,228
<i>"But, Doctor," he says, "I am Pagliacci. "</i>

557
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:14,067
<i>Good joke. Everybody, laugh.</i>

558
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,820
<i>Roll on snare drum. Curtains.</i>

559
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,373
What time do you have
to be at your interview?

560
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,960
Don't worry. We've got plenty of time.

561
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:43,054
Wow. Your finger's like licking a battery.

562
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,367
God, Jon, stop!

563
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,913
- What are you doing?
- Please don't be upset.

564
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:10,664
I always thought you liked this.

565
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,168
No.

566
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,922
I don't... No.

567
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,592
I don't want that.

568
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,596
I don't know
what stimulates you any more.

569
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:29,684
Look, I know you were just trying...

570
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,940
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

571
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:38,777
My work with Adrian is
at a critical stage right now.

572
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,155
- I didn't think it was necessary to...
- To what?

573
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:46,201
To what, to tell me which one of you
was giving me a pity fuck?

574
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:57,920
My attention was
completely focused on you.

575
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:02,800
If you think there's a problem with
my attitude, I am prepared to discuss it.

576
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:08,597
You know how everything in this world
fits together, except people.

577
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:12,643
What am I to you,
another puzzle to be solved?

578
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,269
Have your men stand back.

579
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,398
I'm teleporting the reactor
to Karnak now.

580
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,402
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

581
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:31,079
I don't want that responsibility any more.

582
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,420
He's all yours.

583
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,344
<i>Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.</i>

584
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,306
No, she won't.

585
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:09,909
<i>He's been called many things,
hero, weapon,</i>

586
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:12,536
<i>linchpin of our national security,</i>

00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:17,458
<i>deterrent to nuclear war,
or</i> a <i>man to end worlds.</i>

588
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:23,338

my questions and yours</i>

00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,697

-lt's Laurie.

592
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,670
Sorry. ljust had this new lock installed.

593
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,547
I didn't know where else to go.

594
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:07,675
It's okay. Come in.

595
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:18,018
What's wrong?

596
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,146
I left Jon.

597
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:24,650
God. I'm so sorry.

598
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:28,112
I don't know why I'm here. I just...

599
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,949
I don't know anybody else.

600
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:36,913
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

601
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:41,126
That's okay. You probablyjust had
an argument or something.

602
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,043
No, Dan.

603
00:57:43,128 --> 00:57:45,963
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

604
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:47,422
The way he looks at things now,

605
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:50,802
it's like he doesn't remember
what they are.

606
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:57,307
<i>It's like this world, this real world,
to him, it's like walking through</i> a <i>mist.</i>

607
00:57:58,268 --> 00:58:01,603
And people are just shadows,

608
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:05,400
<i>shadows in</i> a <i>fog.</i>

609
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:10,070
<i>God, how did everything get
so tangled up?</i>

610
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,867
I'm sorry, Dan.

611
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:17,744
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

612
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:21,583
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

613
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:25,170
I was just going to see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

614
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:27,797
You're more than welcome to join.

615
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:31,217
In fact, I insist.

616
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:06,585
Terrific. Dr Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

617
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,920
But he just...

618
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:12,342
We don't have time for makeup.
That blue is too light for television.

619
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,262
Is that dark enough?

620
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:20,807
<i>Yeah, that's dark enough.</i>

621
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,773
- Seymour!
- Bernie, how's tricks?

622
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,661
Go easy, Ed.

623
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,414
The girl.

624
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,626
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

625
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,588
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
butjust play it cool,

626
00:59:50,672 --> 00:59:53,173
-and try not to get into any tight corners.
- Dr Jonathan Osterman,

627
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,175
a renowned nuclear physicist,

628
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:59,389
who, through a terrible accident,
was gifted with extraordinary powers,

629
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:02,976
capable of bending matter to his will.

630
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:07,313
Today, the world knows him
as Dr Manhattan.

631
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:08,731
Welcome.

632
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,195
Thank you.

633
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,864
That's right.

634
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,623
Ms Black, you have the first question.

635
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,293
Dr Manhattan, as you know,

636
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:31,170
the Doomsday Clock is
a symbolic clock face

637
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:35,007
analogising humankind's proximity
to extinction,

638
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,177
midnight representing
the threat of nuclear war.

639
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:41,556
As of now,
it stands at four minutes to midnight.

640
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:44,934
Would you agree that we're
that close to annihilation?

641
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:47,186
My father was a watchmaker.

642
01:00:48,146 --> 01:00:52,108
He abandoned it when Einstein
discovered that time is relative.

643
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:57,822
I would only agree that a symbolic clock
is as nourishing to the intellect

644
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:01,159
as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

645
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:05,454
So you're saying there is no danger?

646
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:07,831
<i>Even in</i> a <i>world
without nuclear weapons,</i>

647
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,168
<i>there would still be danger.</i>

648
01:01:14,297 --> 01:01:19,510
And would you say, as so many claim,
that you are in fact a god,

649
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:22,304
given that you see
the past and future simultaneously?

650
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:26,976
I can only see my own past,
my own future.

651
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:29,478
<i>I am not omniscient.</i>

652
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,146
Doug Roth? Your question.

653
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,940
Speaking of your past, Dr Manhattan,

654
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:36,902
do you remember
a man named Wally Weaver?

655
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,237
Yes.

656
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:42,574
We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

657
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:46,079
- He died of cancer.
- He was a good man.

658
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:50,166
How about Edgar Jacobi,
also known as the supervillain, Moloch?

659
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:55,630
<i>You encountered him several times
in the '60s, battles, conflicts...</i>

660
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,965
<i>Did you know
that he has cancer as well?</i>

661
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,385
I wasn't told.

662
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,387
<i>And what about
General Anthony Randolph?</i>

663
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:06,139
<i>He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.</i>

664
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:08,059
Cancer.

665
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,728
You're suggesting I was the cause.

666
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:13,898
<i>From where I 'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.</i>

667
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,400
<i>Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.</i>

668
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,070
<i>A live human body
and</i> a <i>deceased human body</i>

669
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,739
<i>have the same number of particles.</i>

670
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,952
Structurally, there's no difference.

671
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,793
All right, let's settle down, please.

672
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:47,764
What about Janey Slater?
You think it makes a difference to her?

673
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:52,269
- Janey?
- Your ex-girlfriend?

674
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:55,981
She was a physicist, too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

675
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:59,610
- Doug, one question at a time.
- She has cancer as well.

676
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,612
Doctors have given her six months.

677
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,114
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

678
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:22,884
You were the world to me, Jon.
You were my whole life.

679
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:27,262
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

680
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:29,222
Janey, I wasn't told.

681
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,893
I stuck by you after the accident.

682
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,978
I gave you everything!

683
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,860
This is how you repay me?

684
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,653
Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.

685
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:46,782
Damn you, Jon! God damn you!

686
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,951
Janey, wait.

687
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:52,746
That's it! This interview is over!
Get up there! Get up there!

688
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,625
Get those cameras off!
Everybody, back off!

689
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:59,378
Everybody, back off! I need
some backup here! Leave him alone!

690
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:00,838
Please.

691
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:04,759
If everyone would just go away

692
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,094
and leave me alone.

693
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:10,139
Do you care to comment?

694
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:13,391
I said, leave me alone!

695
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:27,782
<i>I am looking at the stars.
They are so far</i> away.

696
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:31,869
<i>And their light takes so long
to reach us.</i>

697
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:37,750
<i>All we ever see of stars are
their old photographs.</i>

698
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:44,757
<i>It's July, 1959, and I am in love.</i>

699
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,302
That was great! Pick it up tomorrow.

700
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:50,721
- Okay.
- Seventy-five cents.

701
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,722
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

702
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,726
Gosh, Jon,
I wish he gave us a little notice.

703
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,143
I'm sure I made a face.

704
01:04:57,228 --> 01:05:01,315
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

705
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,322
<i>Her name is Janey Slater.</i>

706
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:11,492
<i>She is</i> a <i>physicist like me.</i>

707
01:05:13,202 --> 01:05:15,036
<i>I am 30 years old.</i>

708
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:24,213
<i>We were introduced by</i> a <i>good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.</i>

709
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,927
<i>It is February 12th, 1981.</i>

710
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,847
<i>Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.</i>

711
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,784
<i>That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.</i>

712
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,543
<i>A month from now,
the accident awaits me.</i>

713
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,007
You have a healthy appetite.

714
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,639
I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

715
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:17,432
Hey, let's just wait a second.

716
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,396
<i>I cross the room
to the intrinsic field centre.</i>

717
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:25,273
<i>I find my watch.</i>

718
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,239
<i>When I get to the door,</i>

719
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,326
<i>Wally is turning white.</i>

720
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:39,163
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock!

721
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:42,583
<i>I am terrified.</i>

722
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,958
Jon!

723
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,007
I'm sorry, Jon.

724
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,969
But I can't...

725
01:06:56,931 --> 01:07:00,434
Janey, don't leave me! Don't leave me!

726
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,300
<i>It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.</i>

727
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:37,512
<i>She buys me</i> a <i>beer,</i>

728
01:07:37,596 --> 01:07:40,599
<i>the first time</i> a <i>woman
has done this for me.</i>

729
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:44,144
<i>As she passes me
the cold, perspiring glass,</i>

730
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,813
<i>our fingers touch.</i>

731
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,577
Yes, Jon, good.

732
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,621
Now it's just a question
of reassembling the components

733
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,831
in the correct sequence.

734
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:12,505
<i>I feel fear for the last time.</i>

735
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:33,944
<i>A token funeral is held.
There is nothing to bury.</i>

736
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,697
<i>Janey frames the snapshot.</i>

737
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,158
<i>It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.</i>

738
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:45,456
<i>A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.</i>

739
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:51,712
<i>A few days later, a partially-muscled
skeleton stands in the hallway</i>

740
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:54,672
<i>and screams for</i> a <i>moment
before vanishing.</i>

741
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,367
God.

742
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:23,284
Jon?

743
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:26,079
Is that you?

744
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,667
Nations around the world still reeling
from this morning's announcement,

745
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,670
possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

746
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:36,756
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

747
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,306
<i>They call me Dr Manhattan.</i>

748
01:09:56,443 --> 01:10:00,488
<i>They explain the name has been chosen
for the ominous associations it will raise</i>

749
01:10:00,573 --> 01:10:02,448
<i>in America's enemies.</i>

750
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:07,621
<i>They are shaping me
into something gaudy,</i>

751
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,623
<i>something lethal.</i>

752
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,796
<i>In January, 1971,</i>

753
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:20,842
<i>President Nixon asks me
to intervene in Vietnam,</i>

754
01:10:21,594 --> 01:10:24,680
<i>something that his predecessors
would not ask.</i>

755
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:29,059
<i>A week later, the conflict ends.</i>

756
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:33,104
<i>Some of the Vietcong forces
want to surrender to me personally.</i>

757
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,819
<i>Hollis Mason,</i> a <i>retired costume hero,
writes</i> a <i>book.</i>

758
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:43,489
<i>In it, he calls my arrival
"the dawn of the superhero."</i>

759
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,926
<i>I am not sure ifl know what that means.</i>

760
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:04,720
<i>You see, at the time, I was misquoted.</i>

761
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,515
I never said, "The superman exists,
and he is American."

762
01:11:08,599 --> 01:11:13,520
What I said was
"God exists, and he is American."

763
01:11:15,064 --> 01:11:19,609
Now, if you begin to feel an intense
and crushing feeling of religious terror

764
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,278
at the concept,

765
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:23,738
don't be alarmed.

766
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:27,701
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

767
01:11:30,371 --> 01:11:32,997
<i>It is Christmas, 1963.</i>

768
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:36,752
<i>Janey tells me
she is afraid and worried.</i>

769
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:40,546
<i>She says I am like</i> a <i>god now.</i>

770
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:44,635
<i>I tell her/ don't think there is</i> a <i>God.</i>

771
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,470
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

772
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,390
<i>I tell her/ still want her.</i>

773
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,394
<i>And that I always will.</i>

774
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:58,481
<i>As I lie to her,
it is September 4th, 1970.</i>

775
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:03,319
<i>I am in</i> a <i>room full of people
wearing disguises.</i>

776
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,449
<i>A very young girl looks at me
and smiles.</i>

777
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,912
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

778
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:18,002
<i>After each long kiss, she plants
a smaller, gentler one upon my lips,</i>

779
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,921
<i>like</i> a <i>signature.</i>

780
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:25,091
<i>Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.</i>

781
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:30,764
<i>She bursts into angry tears, asking
if it's because she's getting older.</i>

782
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,016
<i>It's true.</i>

783
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:38,146
<i>She's ageing more noticeably
every day,</i>

784
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:47,280
<i>while I am standing still.</i>

785
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:51,076
<i>I prefer the stillness here.</i>

786
01:12:52,536 --> 01:12:55,788
<i>I am tired of Earth, these people.</i>

787
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,711
<i>I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.</i>

788
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:27,362
<i>They claim their labours are
to build</i> a <i>heaven.</i>

789
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:30,490
<i>Yet their heaven is
populated with horrors.</i>

790
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,659
<i>Perhaps the world is not made.</i>

791
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:36,913
<i>Perhaps nothing is made.</i>

792
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:40,458
<i>A clock without</i> a <i>craftsman.</i>

793
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,671
<i>It's too late.</i>

794
01:13:44,755 --> 01:13:47,256
<i>Always has been,</i>

795
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,885
<i>always will be</i>

796
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,345
momm.

797
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,269
Mr President,

798
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:03,689
the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.

799
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:05,775
They are testing us

800
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:10,238
to see if we manufactured
Dr Manhattan's disappearance

801
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:13,449
to coax a move out of them.

802
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:19,038
How soon can we be ready
for a pre-emptive strike?

803
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:21,416
Two days.

804
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,546
We have a 54% chance
of wiping out the entire USSR

805
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,881
before they get their missiles airborne.

806
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:29,632
Assuming conservative projections

807
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:33,302
of how many Soviet warheads
we destroy beforehand,

808
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,805
we'll lose all of the East Coast.

809
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:39,768
The last gasp
of the Harvard establishment.

810
01:14:41,228 --> 01:14:44,355
Let's see them think
their way out of fission.

811
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:48,277
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift could head south.

812
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:50,570
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

813
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:53,157
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

814
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,576
Not so bad,

815
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,036
all things considered.

816
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,917
Mr President, what would you like to do?

817
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:16,889
Take us to DefCon 2.
Begin fuelling the bombers.

818
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,932
Dr Manhattan has two days.

819
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:26,606
After that, humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

820
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,234
Let's just hope he's on our side.

821
01:15:31,737 --> 01:15:36,574
Without Dr Manhattan around to bully
the Russians into peace, Mr Veidt,

822
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:41,121
people are going to need
good, old-fashioned energy to rely on.

823
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:42,956
You can understand.

824
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:48,212
The world can'tjust quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

825
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:50,631
You'll dismantle our entire economy
overnight.

826
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:53,634
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

827
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,720
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

828
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,014
We mightjust have to make
a public inquiry

829
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:02,391
into any past Communist affiliations
you might have had.

830
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,479
Mr lacocca, gentlemen,

831
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:08,940
I respect your position

832
01:16:09,024 --> 01:16:12,819
and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

833
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:15,363
You want to know my past?

834
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,158
Okay. Happily.

835
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,912
It's a matter of public record
that by 17 both my parents were dead,

836
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:24,706
leaving me alone.

837
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:29,418
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

838
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,171
I mean, they say I'm the smartest man
in the world,

839
01:16:31,255 --> 01:16:37,386
but the truth is I've often felt stupid
at being unable to relate to anyone.

840
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,764
Well, anyone living, that is.

841
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,516
The only person
with whom I felt any kinship

842
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,603
died 300 years before the birth of Christ.

843
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,064
Alexander of Macedonia,

844
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:52,149
or Alexander the Great,
as you know him.

845
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:59,824
His vision of a united world was...
Well, it was unprecedented.

846
01:17:00,993 --> 01:17:05,162
Iwanted, needed,
to match his accomplishments,

847
01:17:05,247 --> 01:17:09,042
and so I resolved to apply
antiquity's teachings to our world today.

848
01:17:09,126 --> 01:17:12,128
And so began my path to conquest.

849
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:17,551
Conquest not of men,
but of the evils that beset them.

850
01:17:19,136 --> 01:17:24,932
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power
are like a drug

851
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:27,601
and you gentlemen, along with
foreign interests, are the pushers.

852
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,813
- Now, listen.
- No.

853
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:34,693
You listen.

854
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:38,070
The world will survive,

855
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:42,367
and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

856
01:17:42,451 --> 01:17:44,744
So let's cut to it, shall we?

857
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,872
Privately, I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

858
01:17:47,956 --> 01:17:49,666
I can buy and sell you three times over,

859
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,667
which is something you should factor
into your decision,

860
01:17:51,752 --> 01:17:56,922
should you choose to make
our disagreement public.

861
01:17:59,426 --> 01:18:01,761
I think you know the way out.

862
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,349
Gentlemen.

863
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:09,019
The toy people want to talk to you

864
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,645
about some new villains
for the Ozymandias line.

865
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,648
Seems all the old villains are dead.

866
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,108
Mr Veidt?

867
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:16,859
I think I have some ideas.

868
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:20,988
Mr Veidt?
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

869
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:02,238
He's got a poison capsule!
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.

870
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:06,618
Who sent you? I want a name.
Give me a name!

871
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:19,756
<i>Suicide pill.</i>

872
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:23,969
Potassium cyanide. The guy was dead
before he hit the ground.

873
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:25,554
Thanks, hon.

874
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:28,765
Then Rorschach was right.

875
01:19:28,849 --> 01:19:30,891
This wasn't some lone nut.

876
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:35,146
It's an organisation,
well-funded, well-equipped.

877
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,399
But who'd want to kill us now?

878
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:42,404
I don't know. But it's not safe out here.

879
01:19:47,993 --> 01:19:51,787
- S0, no word from Jon?
- No.

880
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:56,835
Well, listen,
why don't you come stay with me?

881
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:01,922
No. I... That's sweet,
but I wouldn't wanna impose.

882
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:05,342
Oh, no. Think of it as doing me a favour.

883
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:10,265
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

884
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:14,060
Okay.

885
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:21,484
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 21, 1985.</i>

886
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:26,448
<i>On 43rd and 7th,
saw Dreiberg and Jupiter leaving diner.</i>

887
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:30,076
<i>They didn't know me without my mask.</i>

888
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:32,703
<i>An affair?</i>

889
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:36,875
<i>Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile,</i>

890
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,043
<i>make room for Dreiberg?</i>

891
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:42,588
<i>Does Manhattan even have
a hean' to break?</i>

892
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,222
<i>Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.</i>

893
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:54,935
<i>At his apartment, I found clues.</i>

894
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,979
<i>Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.</i>

895
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:02,943
<i>I've seen the logo before.</i>

896
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:05,237
<i>At Moloch's.</i>

897
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:12,868
Someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man today, Moloch.

898
01:21:12,953 --> 01:21:15,497
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

899
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:18,207
More than just a delivery service,
I take it.

900
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:22,378
Last time I was here, I saw a pension
cheque written from the same company.

901
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:25,631
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

902
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:29,261
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?

903
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:36,225
<i>Rorschach!</i>

904
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:38,728
<i>This is the police!

905
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,771
No! No!

906
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:43,858
<i>If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed!</i>

907
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,735

<i>Come on.
Let's make it</i> a <i>nice, clean surrender.</i>

909
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:51,574
Walked right into it!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

910
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:54,327
- Never, never surrender.
- All right.

911
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:58,247
<i>- I hope you're ready, hero!
- When you are.</i>

912
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,104
One,

01:22:26,693 --> 01:22:28,028
two,

914
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:32,948
three.

915
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,793
- Get him!
- Come on.

916
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:40,809
Christ, he stinks!

917
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:43,520
- Get that mask off him!
- I got it!

918
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:47,524
No! My face! Give me back my face!

919
01:23:48,233 --> 01:23:51,152
<i>The masked vigilante, Rorschach,
was apprehended</i>

920
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:53,154
<i>and he's been identified
as Walter Kovacs,</i>

921
01:23:53,238 --> 01:23:54,988
<i>a 35-year-old white male.</i>

922
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:56,824
<i>Little is yet known about Kovacs,</i>

923
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:59,452

the murder of one Edgar Jacobi,</i>

924
01:23:59,536 --> 01:24:02,872
<i>found shot in the head at point blank
range at his home in the Bronx.</i>

925
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:04,289
<i>Several police officers were injured</i>

926
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:07,001
<i>and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...</i>

927
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:13,882
Rorschach!

928
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,011
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

929
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,354
Rorschach!

930
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:28,898
<i>Walter Kovacs.</i>

931
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:31,984
<i>ls that your name? Walter?</i>

932
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:36,613
<i>Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.</i>

933
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,699
<i>You cooperate with me,</i>

934
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:43,246
<i>and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.</i>

935
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:47,000
In a hospital.
I believe that would be good for you.

936
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:53,088
But the authorities want to put you
with the general population.

937
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,010
- Prison's a prison.
- Yes.

938
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,387
But the difference is, down there,

939
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,682
you'd be eaten alive.

940
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:08,270
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

941
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:13,193
Tell me what you see.

942
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,948
A pretty butterfly.

943
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:26,122
Well, now, what do you see here?

944
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:33,421
Mom? ls he hurting you?

945
01:25:33,505 --> 01:25:35,381
You got a fucking kid in here!

946
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:37,509
- I get that at home.
- Bastard!

947
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:40,052
I should have had that abortion!

948
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:51,564
Some nice flowers.

949
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:59,738
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.

950
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:06,037
Did you catch any diseases from her,
whore's son?

951
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,789
Listen to me, retard!

952
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,418
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

953
01:26:32,063 --> 01:26:33,439
Clouds.

954
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:41,197
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

955
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,617
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

956
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:49,913
You don't like me.
All right. Why is that, exactly?

957
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:54,711
You're fat. Wealthy.
Liberal sensibilities.

958
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:58,213
You want to know about Rorschach?

959
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,466
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

960
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:06,180
<i>I was investigating</i> a <i>kidnap case.</i>

961
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:11,435
<i>Blaire Roche. Six-year-old girl.</i>

962
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:15,773
<i>I was young then. Too soft on criminals.</i>

963
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,152
<i>I let them live.</i>

964
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:22,738
<i>Broke</i> a <i>man's arm to get</i> a <i>tip.</i>

965
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:25,824
<i>Led me to the missing girl's location.</i>

966
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:36,210
<i>I knew the girl was here,</i>

967
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:39,338
<i>but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.</i>

968
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,675
<i>And then I found her.</i>

969
01:28:34,769 --> 01:28:37,604
<i>It was dark
when the murderer got back.</i>

970
01:28:40,942 --> 01:28:43,277
<i>As dark as it gets.</i>

971
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,097
God.

972
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,891
Who's out there? Who is it?

973
01:29:16,978 --> 01:29:18,520
Who is it?

974
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,738
What the...

975
01:29:28,823 --> 01:29:32,368
What... What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

976
01:29:32,452 --> 01:29:34,537
What the fuck do you want?

977
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:37,122
You killed my dogs, man!

978
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:38,498
Fuck.

979
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,881
You think I had
something to do with that girl?

980
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,716
I found that.

981
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:49,801
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing!

982
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:59,645
Okay, I confess.

983
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,940
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

984
01:30:04,484 --> 01:30:05,859
Arrest me.

985
01:30:06,903 --> 01:30:11,032
What? Arrest me! I did it! I said I did it!

986
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:13,701
Christ!

987
01:30:13,784 --> 01:30:18,331
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in! I need help!

988
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:21,375
No, don't! Don't do that!

989
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,337
Take me in! Don't!

990
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,712
No!

991
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:33,095
Men get arrested.

992
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:37,516
Dogs get put down.

993
01:30:42,313 --> 01:30:44,356
<i>Tremors of impact shook my arm.</i>

994
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:48,277
Warm blood splashed my face.

995
01:30:49,403 --> 01:30:53,990
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

996
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:57,369
From then on,
there was only Rorschach.

997
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,414
You see, Doctor,
God didn't kill that little girl,

998
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:05,752
fate didn't butcher her, and destiny
didn't feed her to those dogs.

999
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:11,050
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

1000
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:14,302
From then on, I knew.

1001
01:31:15,429 --> 01:31:18,099
God doesn't make the world this way.

1002
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:21,144
We do.

1003
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:22,979
<i>Hey, Rorschach!</i>

1004
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:27,399
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1005
01:31:29,569 --> 01:31:32,738
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous, too.

1006
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:36,533
- Ain't that right? That's right.
- That's right.

1007
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:39,828
You know, maybe I can give you
an autograph, huh?

1008
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:41,913
What you say, big boy?

1009
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,346
None of you seem to understand.

1010
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:01,516
- L'm not locked in here with you.
- All right, that's it!

1011
01:32:02,726 --> 01:32:04,854
You're locked in here with me!

1012
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:08,458
Lauﬂe!

1013
01:33:09,335 --> 01:33:10,502
Shit!

1014
01:33:11,671 --> 01:33:13,381
- Hold on!
- Fuck!

1015
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,761
I got it, I got it!

1016
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:26,394
So sorry. I was snooping around
and I must have hit the wrong button.

1017
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:28,229
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.

1018
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:31,314
- Okay.
-l'm fine. ljust... lfeel so bad.

1019
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:36,988
No, don't worry. It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

1020
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:40,908
<i>- Archie survived that.
- Archie?</i>

1021
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:47,122
Well, short for Archimedes,
Merlin's pet owl.

1022
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:50,251
Stupid nickname.

1023
01:33:51,377 --> 01:33:54,130
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

1024
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:59,010
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died,

1025
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:03,514
which always surprised me.
I mean, he was...

1026
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:07,143
I think he was disappointed
that I went into crime fighting

1027
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:09,645
instead of following him.

1028
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:15,943
Guess I was just more interested
in birds and aeroplanes, mythology.

1029
01:34:18,237 --> 01:34:20,948
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1030
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:23,908
A secret place
that nobody knows about.

1031
01:34:23,993 --> 01:34:26,828
You can just come down here
and hang out

1032
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:29,497
without anyone checking up on you.

1033
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,417
Nobody watching you.

1034
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:38,090
You wanna try those on?

1035
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:46,349
This...

1036
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,601
There we go.

1037
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:54,356
Wow, these rock.

1038
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:01,697
They amplify the spectral range.
Thermal imaging.

1039
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:06,452
They work even better in the dark.

1040
01:35:10,789 --> 01:35:12,792
You can see me, right?

1041
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,837
I can see everything.

1042
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:23,135
I remember, no matter how black it got,

1043
01:35:23,886 --> 01:35:25,512
whenever I looked
through those goggles,

1044
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:28,015
everything was as clear as day.

1045
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:33,311
This must be the way
Jon sees the world.

1046
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:38,192
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

1047
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:40,778
Put those away when you're done.

1048
01:35:48,953 --> 01:35:51,037
<i>The Soviets are finding themselves
bogged down</i>

1049
01:35:51,122 --> 01:35:52,957
<i>in bloody, house-to-house fighting.</i>

1050
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,876
<i>Casualties on both sides
are said to be in the hundreds.</i>

1051
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:59,046
<i>Civilian deaths are also alarmingly high.
Meanwhile...</i>

1052
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:00,338
Dan.

1053
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,801
Jon sees a lot of things,

1054
01:36:05,845 --> 01:36:07,805
but he doesn't see me.

1055
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,396
Well...

1056
01:37:10,576 --> 01:37:11,827
Sorry.

1057
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:15,122
Come here.

1058
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:24,297
- What's the matter?
- If you could just move a little.

1059
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:26,550
- Okay.
- Yeah. There you go.

1060
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,850
Dan. What's wrong?

1061
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,563
Sorry, I...

1062
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:43,775
Yeah, ljust need a couple of minutes.

1063
01:37:45,903 --> 01:37:47,154
Hell.

1064
01:37:49,657 --> 01:37:52,408
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

1065
01:37:52,493 --> 01:37:55,412
Big Figure. Small world.

1066
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:59,123
I like that.

1067
01:37:59,792 --> 01:38:02,586
But, you know,
it is a small world in here.

1068
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:05,547
And I've been in it
for how long now, Lloyd?

1069
01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:08,967
- Almost 15 years, Mr Figure.
- That's right.

1070
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:13,972
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.

1071
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:19,310
S0, Rorschach,

1072
01:38:19,979 --> 01:38:23,524
that guy you burned is dying,
could go any minute.

1073
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:25,275
You know, by my count,

1074
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:28,862
there are more than 50 people in here
that you put away.

1075
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,698
I've been talking to every one of them,

1076
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,324
and they're all dying
to get a piece of you.

1077
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:36,328
This place is gonna explode!

1078
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:40,832
Then you die by inches.

1079
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:43,377
Tall order.

1080
01:38:43,711 --> 01:38:46,421
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole!

1081
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:49,757
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1082
01:40:13,676 --> 01:40:14,926
Dan?

1083
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:24,103
Is everything all right?

1084
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:28,064
God, I'm tired of being afraid.

1085
01:40:29,692 --> 01:40:31,694
Afraid of war,

1086
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:35,613
afraid of the mask killer,

1087
01:40:38,117 --> 01:40:42,954
and afraid of this goddamn suit
and how much I need it.

1088
01:40:44,206 --> 01:40:45,582
Me, too.

1089
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:50,878
Soto hell with it. Let's take Archie out.

1090
01:40:56,885 --> 01:40:58,095
You're serious.

1091
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:00,805
I used to be a masked avenger, too,
remember?

1092
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:02,224
I'm used to going out
at 3:00 in the morning

1093
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:04,518
and doing something stupid.

1094
01:42:06,162 --> 01:42:09,457
<i>Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.
Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.</i>

1095
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:10,876
<i>Rapid burner.</i>

1096
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,336
Let's go.

1097
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:19,426
- I can see it!
- All right, hold on!

1098
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:31,729
Dan, there are kids in there!

1099
01:42:31,814 --> 01:42:34,190
Everyone, please stay where you are!
Try to remain calm.

1100
01:42:34,274 --> 01:42:36,150
<i>We're gonna get you out of there!</i>

1101
01:42:36,234 --> 01:42:38,694
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

1102
01:42:38,779 --> 01:42:40,613
I'll get you close.

1103
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:40,465
Let's go!

1104
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,259
All right.

1105
01:43:45,304 --> 01:43:46,930
We're all set.

1106
01:43:47,014 --> 01:43:48,765
Is that everyone?

1107
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:15,167
- Bye.
Bye-bye!

1108
01:44:19,171 --> 01:44:21,340
I can't believe we did that.

1109
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:25,344
- Probably lock us up with Rorschach.
- Who cares?

1110
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:28,012
World War lll could start tomorrow.

1111
01:44:29,347 --> 01:44:30,640
Right?

1112
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:33,560
Right.

1113
01:46:35,181 --> 01:46:36,390
Yeah!

1114
01:46:44,858 --> 01:46:46,777
He's dead, Rorschach.

1115
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:48,403
While everyone's distracted,

1116
01:46:48,487 --> 01:46:50,947
we thought we'd bring you
a little housewarming gift.

1117
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:53,533
Something from the machine shop.

1118
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:57,203
Hey, boss, you notice?

1119
01:46:57,287 --> 01:46:59,413
None of that
"small world, tall order" crap.

1120
01:46:59,497 --> 01:47:03,667
'Cause he knows once we slice open
his lock, he's next on the block.

1121
01:47:03,752 --> 01:47:05,377
Fatchance.

1122
01:47:05,462 --> 01:47:07,046
You're dead, Rorschach!

1123
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:10,884
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

1124
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:15,680
Your hands, my pleasure.

1125
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:19,810
I can't reach the lock.
Should I cut the bars?

1126
01:47:19,893 --> 01:47:23,688
This riot won't last.
I've been waiting 15 years for this.

1127
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:27,775
I'm sorry, Lawrence,
but you're in the way of my revenge.

1128
01:47:31,529 --> 01:47:33,657
Nothing personal, big guy.

1129
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:36,201
Boss! Wait!

1130
01:47:49,881 --> 01:47:51,966
Now you find out what the score is.

1131
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:54,886
One-nothing. Come and get me.

1132
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,726
Come on!

1133
01:48:03,228 --> 01:48:05,479
S0, I've been thinking.

1134
01:48:05,564 --> 01:48:09,275
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

1135
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,070
I think we ought to spring Rorschach.

1136
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:15,282
- What?
- Someone set him up.

1137
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:20,287
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
itjust doesn't make sense.

1138
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:22,122
You didn't get it.

1139
01:48:22,538 --> 01:48:25,167
Yeah, but breaking into
a maximum-security prison

1140
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:27,042
is a little different than putting out a fire.

1141
01:48:27,127 --> 01:48:28,962
Yeah, you're right.

1142
01:48:29,712 --> 01:48:31,715
It'll be more fun.

1143
01:48:35,719 --> 01:48:39,555
Hurry, Lloyd! lwant to smell
this son of a bitch cooking.

1144
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:44,935
Yes.

1145
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:51,525
No.

1146
01:49:05,457 --> 01:49:08,542
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before.

1147
01:49:08,627 --> 01:49:10,295
Obvious, really.

1148
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:14,591
Two-nothing. Your move.

1149
01:49:17,594 --> 01:49:19,095
Out of the way! Hurry!

1150
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:53,587
No!

1151
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:56,341
Where's my face?

1152
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,261
No, don't kill me!

1153
01:50:03,765 --> 01:50:05,557
Your turn, Doctor.

1154
01:50:05,641 --> 01:50:08,144
Tell me, what do you see?

1155
01:51:34,564 --> 01:51:36,065
Don't move!

1156
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:46,158
Rorschach!

1157
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:49,703
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1158
01:51:49,787 --> 01:51:52,457
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1159
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:55,835
For Christ's sake!

1160
01:52:56,688 --> 01:52:58,564
Hey, you all right?

1161
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:03,653
Yeah. Just heavy, you know?

1162
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:06,948
The war. Jailbreak.

1163
01:53:07,614 --> 01:53:12,036
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1164
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:18,667
Hello, Laurie.

1165
01:53:18,751 --> 01:53:21,753
Jon. TV said you were on Mars.

1166
01:53:22,171 --> 01:53:24,298
I am on Mars.

1167
01:53:24,882 --> 01:53:27,469
You and I are about to have
a conversation there.

1168
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:28,970
What are you talking about?

1169
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:32,556
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

1170
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:40,273
- Laurie, don't.
- Dan, trust me.

1171
01:53:40,773 --> 01:53:42,358
I have to go.

1172
01:53:48,072 --> 01:53:50,115
Beautiful, isn't it?

1173
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:58,041
Forgive me.
These things sometimes slip my mind.

1174
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:01,252
It won't happen again.

1175
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:04,671
That's comforting.

1176
01:54:07,425 --> 01:54:08,967
Oh, my God.

1177
01:54:09,594 --> 01:54:11,095
I'm on Mars.

1178
01:54:12,805 --> 01:54:17,185
We need to hit up underworld contacts,
squeeze people.

1179
01:54:17,268 --> 01:54:20,145
Sure. Why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

1180
01:54:20,229 --> 01:54:22,439
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1181
01:54:22,524 --> 01:54:25,777
You've gone too soft, too trusting.

1182
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:27,194
Especially with women.

1183
01:54:27,278 --> 01:54:29,363
Okay, no. Listen. I've had it with that!

1184
01:54:29,447 --> 01:54:31,533
God, who do you think you are,
Rorschach?

1185
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:33,784
You live off people while insulting them,

1186
01:54:33,868 --> 01:54:37,956
and no one complains because
they think you're a goddamn lunatic!

1187
01:54:49,634 --> 01:54:51,636
I'm sorry. I...

1188
01:54:54,305 --> 01:54:56,724
I shouldn't have said that, man.

1189
01:54:58,225 --> 01:54:59,601
Daniel,

1190
01:55:01,186 --> 01:55:03,189
you are a good friend.

1191
01:55:06,484 --> 01:55:09,654
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

1192
01:55:16,286 --> 01:55:17,953
Forget it.

1193
01:55:18,871 --> 01:55:22,792
It's okay, man. Let's do it your way.

1194
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:43,770
Oh, God.

1195
01:55:43,854 --> 01:55:47,233
Pyramid Transnational!
Anyone heard of it?

1196
01:55:55,867 --> 01:55:57,577
You bastards.

1197
01:55:57,659 --> 01:56:01,122
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

1198
01:56:01,706 --> 01:56:05,292
Back off or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face!

1199
01:56:06,543 --> 01:56:09,588
Everybody, stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

1200
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:13,967
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt.

1201
01:56:14,051 --> 01:56:16,720
Dead now. Did you know him?

1202
01:56:17,305 --> 01:56:18,430
No.

1203
01:56:19,724 --> 01:56:21,266
Yeah, yeah!

1204
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:23,478
I hired him. I knew him from the inside.

1205
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,561
You're a felon.

1206
01:56:24,645 --> 01:56:27,564
Was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

1207
01:56:27,649 --> 01:56:31,527
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

1208
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:35,448
- Told by whom?
- My contact, Miss Slater.

1209
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:38,117
Janey Slater works for Pyramid, too?

1210
01:56:38,201 --> 01:56:39,827
Yeah, she was real nice.

1211
01:56:39,911 --> 01:56:42,246
She said hiring ex-cons was
part of a company programme,

1212
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:43,831
give people a second chance.

1213
01:56:43,914 --> 01:56:46,458
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

1214
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:53,466
Janey Slater. Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1215
01:56:53,548 --> 01:56:56,301
Adrian's people might help us find out
who's underwriting Pyramid.

1216
01:56:56,386 --> 01:56:57,427
Follow the money.

1217
01:57:00,264 --> 01:57:03,016
This is where we hold our conversation.

1218
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:08,605
In it, you ask me to stop
the imminent nuclear war.

1219
01:57:09,815 --> 01:57:12,568
But why would I save a world

1220
01:57:12,652 --> 01:57:15,070
I no longer have any stake in?

1221
01:57:16,905 --> 01:57:18,908
Then do it for me

1222
01:57:19,826 --> 01:57:21,493
if you really care.

1223
01:57:21,577 --> 01:57:24,162
When you left me, I left Earth.

1224
01:57:25,206 --> 01:57:27,917
Does that not show you that I care?

1225
01:57:31,253 --> 01:57:33,256
My red world here now

1226
01:57:35,132 --> 01:57:37,801
means more to me than your blue one.

1227
01:57:38,677 --> 01:57:40,387
Let me show you.

1228
01:57:58,698 --> 01:58:01,283
<i>Bombers are fuelled and ready, sir.</i>

1229
01:58:11,085 --> 01:58:13,087
It's time, gentlemen.

1230
01:58:15,297 --> 01:58:17,300
Take us to DefCon 1.

1231
01:58:23,055 --> 01:58:26,184
Not in penthouse. Not in office.

1232
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:29,270
What nocturnal proclivities entice
a man with everything

1233
01:58:29,353 --> 01:58:31,271
out into the night at this hour?

1234
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:33,483
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1235
01:58:33,565 --> 01:58:35,734
Maybe he keeps it on file.

1236
01:58:40,698 --> 01:58:43,283
- Something's not right.
- Agreed.

1237
01:58:43,367 --> 01:58:47,246
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess,
all work for Pyramid.

1238
01:58:48,456 --> 01:58:53,127
Moloch said The Comedian mentioned
a list with his and Slater's name on it.

1239
01:58:53,211 --> 01:58:56,631
Whoever owns Pyramid could be giving
these people cancer,

1240
01:58:56,713 --> 01:58:58,632
setting Manhattan up.

1241
01:59:12,939 --> 01:59:14,148
Funny.

1242
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:18,152
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world,

1243
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:22,823
believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1244
01:59:24,074 --> 01:59:26,786
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

1245
01:59:26,868 --> 01:59:28,203
Pharaohs?

1246
01:59:34,752 --> 01:59:36,753
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1247
01:59:37,505 --> 01:59:40,341
See what
the corporate head-peepers say.

1248
01:59:41,926 --> 01:59:44,886
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

1249
01:59:46,805 --> 01:59:49,891
"If the only remaining ties
were to be severed,

1250
01:59:50,434 --> 01:59:54,771
"we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

1251
01:59:58,442 --> 01:59:59,734
I'm in.

1252
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:30,307
No.

1253
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:37,981
<i>Congratulations, Mr Veidt.
Dr Manhattan's energy reactor is online.</i>

1254
02:00:38,608 --> 02:00:44,279
Your support and your enthusiasm
is what has led to this triumph.

1255
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:49,159
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

1256
02:00:49,327 --> 02:00:50,953
Cheers.

1257
02:00:52,496 --> 02:00:56,000
What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

1258
02:00:57,667 --> 02:01:00,837
This is the new Karnak.

1259
02:01:01,756 --> 02:01:05,592
This represents the culmination
of a dream more than 2,000 years old,

1260
02:01:05,676 --> 02:01:10,847
a dream now assured because
of your unquestioning assistance.

1261
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:18,146
And for this, I am ashamed,

1262
02:01:20,024 --> 02:01:23,694
ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

1263
02:01:26,197 --> 02:01:28,032
To the pharaohs,

1264
02:01:28,949 --> 02:01:32,453
their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants,

1265
02:01:32,536 --> 02:01:36,039
buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

1266
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:39,752
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1267
02:01:41,002 --> 02:01:43,756
Our new peaceful world
will be indebted

1268
02:01:44,465 --> 02:01:46,466
to your great sacrifice.

1269
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:49,679
Bubastis.

1270
02:01:54,475 --> 02:01:57,103
<i>Rorschach 's journal, final entry.</i>

1271
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,146
<i>Veidt's behind everything.</i>

1272
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:03,734
<i>Why? What's his endgame?</i>

1273
02:02:04,443 --> 02:02:07,488
<i>I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.</i>

1274
02:02:08,322 --> 02:02:11,574
<i>Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch</i> a <i>bullet.</i>

1275
02:02:11,993 --> 02:02:14,828
<i>He could kill us both alone in the snow.</i>

1276
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:17,914
<i>That's where we're going now,
Antarctica.</i>

1277
02:02:18,873 --> 02:02:21,752
<i>Whether I'm alive or dead
upon this reading,</i>

1278
02:02:21,836 --> 02:02:26,172
<i>I hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.</i>

1279
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:28,759
<i>I live my life free of compromise</i>

1280
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:32,262
<i>and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.</i>

1281
02:02:33,596 --> 02:02:36,266
<i>Rorschach, November 1.</i>

1282
02:02:36,934 --> 02:02:39,895
<i>Can't you just tell me how this all ends
and save us the trouble?</i>

1283
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:43,189
lt ends with you in tears.

1284
02:02:43,274 --> 02:02:46,318
Tears?
So you don't come back to Earth?

1285
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:49,697
At some point, yes.

1286
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:54,118
The streets are filled with death.

1287
02:02:54,784 --> 02:02:58,622
Jon, please! You have to stop this!

1288
02:02:59,122 --> 02:03:01,125
Everyone will die!

1289
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:05,046
And the universe will not even notice.

1290
02:03:08,298 --> 02:03:12,052
In my opinion, the existence of life

1291
02:03:13,429 --> 02:03:15,972
is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1292
02:03:18,516 --> 02:03:20,519
Just look around you.

1293
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:27,818
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

1294
02:03:28,444 --> 02:03:32,823
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map,

1295
02:03:32,907 --> 02:03:38,787
flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.

1296
02:03:39,997 --> 02:03:46,002
S0, tell me, how would all of this
be greatly improved by an oil pipeline?

1297
02:03:46,503 --> 02:03:48,338
BY a shopping mall?

1298
02:03:52,885 --> 02:03:56,262
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1299
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:59,432
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

1300
02:03:59,516 --> 02:04:01,101
Oh, God, Jon!

1301
02:04:01,185 --> 02:04:05,523
- Only what can happen does happen.
- Just stop your bullshit!

1302
02:04:07,315 --> 02:04:09,944
Land this thing. Now.

1303
02:04:10,027 --> 02:04:12,029
As you wish.

1304
02:04:18,077 --> 02:04:19,286
You know what?

1305
02:04:19,369 --> 02:04:22,081
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom

1306
02:04:22,163 --> 02:04:24,917
and all the other worthless humans!

1307
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,752
But know that you were wrong.

1308
02:04:26,836 --> 02:04:30,421
You said this ended with me in tears
and, look, nothing.

1309
02:04:31,172 --> 02:04:32,800
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

1310
02:04:32,882 --> 02:04:37,304
You complain that I refuse to see
life on life's terms,

1311
02:04:38,805 --> 02:04:42,851
yet you continuously refuse to see
things from my perspective.

1312
02:04:42,935 --> 02:04:44,895
You shut out what you're afraid of.

1313
02:04:44,979 --> 02:04:47,355
I'm not afraid.

1314
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:50,984
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me.

1315
02:04:51,068 --> 02:04:52,944
Do that thing you do.

1316
02:04:59,284 --> 02:05:01,162
Magic! Dreams!

1317
02:05:01,244 --> 02:05:04,832
That is what I had before!
I was a hero, God damn it!

1318
02:05:04,914 --> 02:05:06,583
It's not my fault you got old!

1319
02:05:06,667 --> 02:05:07,667
What do you have to complain about?

1320
02:05:07,751 --> 02:05:10,045
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child!

1321
02:05:10,128 --> 02:05:12,756
Why don't you call your friend Eddie?
Maybe he can give you a better life.

1322
02:05:13,756 --> 02:05:16,926
Even the grimy parts of it

1323
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:18,554
keep on getting brighter.

1324
02:05:19,345 --> 02:05:21,599
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

1325
02:05:22,182 --> 02:05:24,350
You're The Comedian, right?

1326
02:05:24,894 --> 02:05:26,854
<i>You were pretty cool in there.</i>

1327
02:05:26,936 --> 02:05:30,608
You know, your mom, she was one of
the all-time champion beauties.

1328
02:05:31,024 --> 02:05:32,693
You got her eyes, you know.

1329
02:05:32,775 --> 02:05:35,279
- You have that...
- Take your hands off her!

1330
02:05:35,362 --> 02:05:37,573
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1331
02:05:37,655 --> 02:05:39,490
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.

1332
02:05:39,574 --> 02:05:41,577
Get in the car. Now.

1333
02:05:43,746 --> 02:05:45,747
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1334
02:05:45,831 --> 02:05:47,248
Jesus Christ, Sally.

1335
02:05:47,332 --> 02:05:49,501
Can't a guy talk to his,

1336
02:05:50,377 --> 02:05:52,796
you know, old friend's daughter?

1337
02:05:54,340 --> 02:05:55,632
Drive.

1338
02:06:01,846 --> 02:06:04,807
It was a mistake! One time!

1339
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:07,895
Guy tries to rape you and years later
you let him finish the job?

1340
02:06:07,978 --> 02:06:11,105
What? Were you drunk orjust lonely?

1341
02:06:11,189 --> 02:06:13,775
Am I ever going to live this down?

1342
02:06:17,363 --> 02:06:18,697
Lauﬂe.

1343
02:06:23,327 --> 02:06:24,744
No.

1344
02:06:26,622 --> 02:06:28,623
No, not him.

1345
02:06:29,457 --> 02:06:33,002
The Comedian was your father.

1346
02:06:35,546 --> 02:06:37,216
No!

1347
02:06:40,636 --> 02:06:43,305
No! No!

1348
02:06:44,097 --> 02:06:45,474
No!

1349
02:07:18,756 --> 02:07:23,429
My life is just one big joke.

1350
02:07:23,804 --> 02:07:26,306
I don't think your life is a joke.

1351
02:07:28,057 --> 02:07:29,643
Yeah, well,

1352
02:07:31,811 --> 02:07:35,481
I'm sorry if I don't trust
your sense of humour.

1353
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:45,908
Will you smile

1354
02:07:47,578 --> 02:07:49,579
if I admit I was wrong?

1355
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:54,335
About what?

1356
02:07:56,837 --> 02:07:58,296
Miracles.

1357
02:08:00,006 --> 02:08:05,429
Events with astronomical odds of
occurring, like oxygen turning into gold.

1358
02:08:06,721 --> 02:08:11,018
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect that,

1359
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:14,104
in human coupling,

1360
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:18,942
millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life

1361
02:08:19,777 --> 02:08:24,573
for generation after generation,
until, finally,

1362
02:08:24,655 --> 02:08:27,784
your mother loves a man,

1363
02:08:28,618 --> 02:08:32,372
Edward Blake, The Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate,

1364
02:08:32,456 --> 02:08:37,127
and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds,

1365
02:08:37,211 --> 02:08:38,878
it's you,

1366
02:08:40,588 --> 02:08:43,550
only you,

1367
02:08:45,135 --> 02:08:46,804
that emerged.

1368
02:08:46,886 --> 02:08:53,310
To distil so specific a form
from all that chaos

1369
02:08:55,645 --> 02:08:58,023
is like turning air into gold.

1370
02:09:03,153 --> 02:09:04,988
A miracle.

1371
02:09:08,658 --> 02:09:12,287
And so I was wrong.

1372
02:09:14,497 --> 02:09:17,876
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

1373
02:09:45,779 --> 02:09:48,239
We got a bearing
on that artificial structure.

1374
02:09:48,323 --> 02:09:50,033
Heat signature's off the chart.

1375
02:09:50,826 --> 02:09:52,077
Veidt.

1376
02:09:52,161 --> 02:09:54,203
I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

1377
02:10:02,296 --> 02:10:04,256
- The engines.
- They're icing up.

1378
02:10:04,338 --> 02:10:07,885
- Hold on to something.
- Daniel, you're coming in too low.

1379
02:10:10,761 --> 02:10:12,472
Don't wish to interfere
with running your ship,

1380
02:10:12,555 --> 02:10:14,056
but perhaps you should pull up
sharply before...

1381
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:17,310
I know!
I'm trying to pull him up, God damn it!

1382
02:10:45,546 --> 02:10:49,051
I'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up de-icing,

1383
02:10:49,134 --> 02:10:52,930
but it's gonna take a while,
and we don't have time to wait.

1384
02:10:53,555 --> 02:10:56,600
- You need something warmer.
-l'm fine like this.

1385
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:28,966
What is it, girl?

1386
02:11:58,578 --> 02:12:00,454
Adrian's a pacifist.

1387
02:12:01,163 --> 02:12:03,708
He's a vegetarian, for Christ's sakes.

1388
02:12:04,333 --> 02:12:05,918
He's never killed anyone in his life.

1389
02:12:06,002 --> 02:12:07,462
Hitler was vegetarian.

1390
02:12:07,546 --> 02:12:11,507
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get a second chance.

1391
02:13:23,412 --> 02:13:26,123
Gentlemen, welcome.

1392
02:13:26,207 --> 02:13:29,211
Adrian, we know everything.

1393
02:13:29,293 --> 02:13:32,713
- Then what's there to discuss, Dan?
- Plenty.

1394
02:13:32,797 --> 02:13:35,926
- You killed Comedian.
- May he rest in peace.

1395
02:13:36,551 --> 02:13:39,054
Blake figured it out first.

1396
02:13:39,136 --> 02:13:41,222
<i>Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,</i>

1397
02:13:41,305 --> 02:13:44,059
<i>making sure
we weren 't rocking the boat.</i>

1398
02:13:44,141 --> 02:13:46,478
<i>Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak,</i>

1399
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:50,731
<i>and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.</i>

1400
02:13:50,815 --> 02:13:54,069
Even I couldn't predict he'd be
the one to have a change of heart.

1401
02:13:54,819 --> 02:13:58,407
S0 I had to kill him.

1402
02:13:59,949 --> 02:14:03,703
Then I neutralised Jon. No easy task.

1403
02:14:03,787 --> 02:14:06,372
I put roughly two billion dollars
into tachyon research

1404
02:14:06,456 --> 02:14:08,542
to block Jon's vision of the future.

1405
02:14:08,625 --> 02:14:11,377
You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

1406
02:14:11,461 --> 02:14:12,712
<i>Got him to leave the planet.</i>

1407
02:14:12,796 --> 02:14:16,591
I've known Jon long enough to see
he isn't devoid of emotion.

1408
02:14:16,675 --> 02:14:19,176
His subtle facial twitches
wouldn't be noticed by the layman,

1409
02:14:19,261 --> 02:14:22,764
<i>but, to me,
he might as well have been sobbing.</i>

1410
02:14:22,847 --> 02:14:26,100
<i>All I needed to do was
tug on the thread.</i>

1411
02:14:26,184 --> 02:14:28,228
<i>The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt</i>

1412
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:31,939
<i>when he came to believe he'd given
cancer to the people he loved</i>

1413
02:14:32,023 --> 02:14:34,359
<i>was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.</i>

1414
02:14:34,443 --> 02:14:38,279
<i>Your bullshit assassin!
You paid him to throw us off.</i>

1415
02:14:38,363 --> 02:14:42,908
<i>Mr Chess gave his life
in the service of</i> a <i>higher cause, Dan.</i>

1416
02:14:45,328 --> 02:14:50,751
<i>lput a cyanide capsule in his mouth,
leaving only one loose end.</i>

1417
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:55,463
You and your mask killer theory,

1418
02:14:55,546 --> 02:14:58,716
<i>one you followed with the tenacity
of</i> a <i>true sociopath.</i>

1419
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,426
<i>I tipped off the police,</i>

1420
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:02,929
and once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.

1421
02:15:03,012 --> 02:15:05,097
Sorry to disappoint you.

1422
02:15:18,862 --> 02:15:21,363
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

1423
02:15:21,448 --> 02:15:23,283
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

1424
02:15:23,365 --> 02:15:25,993
Nuclear war? Human extinction?

1425
02:15:36,587 --> 02:15:41,801
Of course, my moral safeguards gave
me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

1426
02:15:41,885 --> 02:15:44,762
A few key regions around the globe,

1427
02:15:44,845 --> 02:15:49,475
New York, Los Angeles,
Moscow, Hong Kong,

1428
02:15:50,644 --> 02:15:53,020
disintegrated in an instant.

1429
02:15:53,104 --> 02:15:58,109
Fifteen million people killed
by Dr Manhattan himself.

1430
02:15:59,694 --> 02:16:02,613
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War Ill.

1431
02:16:02,697 --> 02:16:04,365
Jon wouldn't do that.

1432
02:16:04,448 --> 02:16:07,577
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

1433
02:16:07,661 --> 02:16:11,706
The energy breakthrough
I was working on just came to fruition.

1434
02:16:12,082 --> 02:16:15,710
All these years,
Jon was helping me replicate his power,

1435
02:16:16,336 --> 02:16:18,712
unaware of how I plan to use it.

1436
02:16:19,171 --> 02:16:20,465
You see,

1437
02:16:21,966 --> 02:16:23,969
The Comedian was right.

1438
02:16:25,095 --> 02:16:29,431
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation,

1439
02:16:30,266 --> 02:16:32,644
so in order to save this planet,

1440
02:16:33,102 --> 02:16:34,938
I had to trick it

1441
02:16:35,604 --> 02:16:39,400
with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

1442
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:43,112
- Killing millions?
- To save billions.

1443
02:16:43,947 --> 02:16:45,990
A necessary crime.

1444
02:16:46,074 --> 02:16:48,534
You know we can't let you do that.

1445
02:16:49,577 --> 02:16:51,453
"Do that," Rorschach?

1446
02:16:51,954 --> 02:16:54,207
I'm not a comic book villain.

1447
02:16:54,457 --> 02:16:56,959
Do you seriously think I'd explain
my masterstroke to you

1448
02:16:57,042 --> 02:16:58,460
if there were
even the slightest possibility

1449
02:16:58,545 --> 02:17:00,963
you could affect the outcome?

1450
02:17:03,884 --> 02:17:06,136
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

1451
02:18:46,193 --> 02:18:48,237
Jesus Christ, Henry!

1452
02:18:49,155 --> 02:18:51,782
Why the hell didn't we get
a launch detection?

1453
02:18:53,243 --> 02:18:56,829
It's not the Soviets, sir.

1454
02:18:58,247 --> 02:19:03,210
Intel indicates the energy signature
was generated by

1455
02:19:05,254 --> 02:19:06,965
Dr Manhattan.

1456
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:11,677
Jon.

1457
02:19:14,847 --> 02:19:16,099
Interference.

1458
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:18,601
Cataclysmic interference.

1459
02:19:28,153 --> 02:19:30,362
I can't believe it happened.

1460
02:19:31,989 --> 02:19:34,783
This wasn't caused
by nuclear warheads.

1461
02:19:39,496 --> 02:19:40,873
It was me.

1462
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:45,795
I did this.

1463
02:19:46,629 --> 02:19:48,756
What do you mean, you did this?

1464
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:50,507
Not directly.

1465
02:19:51,134 --> 02:19:53,677
It was made to look like I did it.

1466
02:19:56,972 --> 02:19:58,390
Adrian.

1467
02:20:04,689 --> 02:20:06,566
Speak of the devil.

1468
02:20:09,527 --> 02:20:10,611
- Jon“.
- I know.

1469
02:20:10,694 --> 02:20:11,737
Must stop him.

1470
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:14,615
- Killed Blake, killed millions.
- Wait here.

1471
02:20:25,667 --> 02:20:27,670
Adrian, stop this.

1472
02:20:29,547 --> 02:20:31,591
The tachyons were clever.

1473
02:20:32,634 --> 02:20:37,263
But even if I can't predict where you are,
I can turn the walls to glass.

1474
02:20:38,222 --> 02:20:40,350
I should thank you.

1475
02:20:42,018 --> 02:20:45,396
I'd almost forgotten
the excitement of not knowing,

1476
02:20:46,022 --> 02:20:48,316
<i>the delights of uncertainty.</i>

1477
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:55,031
Forgive me, girl.

1478
02:21:17,970 --> 02:21:19,931
You're such an asshole.

1479
02:21:53,505 --> 02:21:55,674
Veidt, you bastard!

1480
02:21:55,757 --> 02:21:58,552
- If you've hurt her, I'll...
- Dan,

1481
02:21:59,888 --> 02:22:01,138
grow UP-

1482
02:22:01,221 --> 02:22:04,308
My new world demands
less obvious heroism.

1483
02:22:04,726 --> 02:22:08,938
Your schoolboy heroics are redundant.

1484
02:22:09,814 --> 02:22:11,816
What have they achieved?

1485
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:18,448
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation
is your only triumph.

1486
02:22:19,781 --> 02:22:22,409
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

1487
02:22:22,493 --> 02:22:24,620
I'm very disappointed.

1488
02:22:38,468 --> 02:22:41,638
Reassembling myself was
the first trick I learned.

1489
02:22:42,221 --> 02:22:44,349
It didn't kill Osterman.

1490
02:22:47,268 --> 02:22:50,021
Did you really think it would kill me?

1491
02:22:51,022 --> 02:22:53,983
I have walked across
the surface of the sun.

1492
02:22:54,566 --> 02:22:58,320
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast,

1493
02:22:58,404 --> 02:23:01,156
they could hardly be said
to have occurred at all.

1494
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:04,244
But you, Adrian, you're just a man.

1495
02:23:05,827 --> 02:23:10,833
The world's smartest man poses
no more threat to me

1496
02:23:11,376 --> 02:23:13,710
than does its smartest termite.

1497
02:23:16,755 --> 02:23:18,424
What's that?

1498
02:23:18,507 --> 02:23:20,510
Another ultimate weapon?

1499
02:23:21,051 --> 02:23:22,344
Yes.

1500
02:23:24,388 --> 02:23:26,224
You could say that.

1501
02:23:29,685 --> 02:23:31,561
<i>...came under attack.</i>

1502
02:23:32,272 --> 02:23:35,274
<i>Millions of lives were suddenly ended</i>

1503
02:23:36,149 --> 02:23:39,987
<i>in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr Manhattan himself.</i>

1504
02:23:43,074 --> 02:23:44,950
<i>Since the attacks,</i>

1505
02:23:45,033 --> 02:23:49,204
<i>I have been in constant contact
with the premier of the USSR.</i>

1506
02:23:50,415 --> 02:23:52,916
<i>Putting aside our past differences,</i>

1507
02:23:53,584 --> 02:23:58,213
<i>we have both pledged to unite
against this common enemy.</i>

1508
02:24:00,049 --> 02:24:03,302
<i>With the rest of the world,
we will prevail.</i>

1509
02:24:07,014 --> 02:24:09,558
<i>This is</i> a <i>day we shall never forget.</i>

1510
02:24:10,183 --> 02:24:13,603
<i>And yet we go fon/vard
to defend the human race</i>

1511
02:24:14,522 --> 02:24:17,899
<i>and all that is good and just
in our world.</i>

1512
02:24:20,569 --> 02:24:21,945
<i>Thank you.</i>

1513
02:24:22,655 --> 02:24:24,324
<i>God bless us all.</i>

1514
02:24:25,032 --> 02:24:26,575
Do you see?

1515
02:24:28,911 --> 02:24:31,496
Two superpowers retreating from war.

1516
02:24:33,248 --> 02:24:35,626
I've saved the Earth from hell.

1517
02:24:35,709 --> 02:24:37,378
We both have.

1518
02:24:38,004 --> 02:24:40,130
This is as much your victory
as it is mine.

1519
02:24:40,715 --> 02:24:43,885
<i>The Soviet ambassador's meeting
in Washington...</i>

1520
02:24:45,093 --> 02:24:49,514
Now we can return,
do what we were meant to.

1521
02:24:49,599 --> 02:24:52,018
We were meant to exactjustice.

1522
02:24:53,185 --> 02:24:55,146
Everyone's gonna know
what you've done.

1523
02:24:55,228 --> 02:24:56,772
Will they?

1524
02:24:56,855 --> 02:25:01,568
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

1525
02:25:01,652 --> 02:25:03,111
Peace based on a lie.

1526
02:25:03,195 --> 02:25:06,114
But peace nonetheless.

1527
02:25:06,574 --> 02:25:08,117
He's right.

1528
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:12,038
Exposing Adrian would only doom
the world to nuclear destruction again.

1529
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:14,623
No. We can't do this.

1530
02:25:14,998 --> 02:25:16,792
On Mars,

1531
02:25:18,503 --> 02:25:21,213
you taught me the value of life.

1532
02:25:21,297 --> 02:25:25,635
If we hope to preserve it here,
we must remain silent.

1533
02:25:30,389 --> 02:25:32,475
Keep your own secrets.

1534
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:41,316
Don't even think about it.

1535
02:25:43,027 --> 02:25:44,486
Rorschach!

1536
02:25:46,322 --> 02:25:47,739
Wait.

1537
02:25:49,032 --> 02:25:50,700
Never compromise.

1538
02:25:51,494 --> 02:25:54,121
Not even in the face of Armageddon.

1539
02:25:54,831 --> 02:25:58,417
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

1540
02:26:08,677 --> 02:26:11,388
I've made myself feel every death,

1541
02:26:13,765 --> 02:26:17,477
see every innocent face I've murdered

1542
02:26:17,561 --> 02:26:19,564
to save humanity.

1543
02:26:25,361 --> 02:26:27,405
You understand, don't you?

1544
02:26:27,487 --> 02:26:29,364
Without condoning

1545
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:32,284
or condemning,

1546
02:26:36,914 --> 02:26:38,415
I understand.

1547
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:49,385
Out of my way. People have to be told.

1548
02:26:50,302 --> 02:26:52,805
You know I can't let you do that.

1549
02:26:53,597 --> 02:26:56,350
Suddenly you've discovered humanity?

1550
02:26:57,727 --> 02:26:59,395
How convenient!

1551
02:27:08,361 --> 02:27:10,823
If you'd cared from the start,

1552
02:27:10,906 --> 02:27:13,408
none of this would have happened.

1553
02:27:16,913 --> 02:27:19,290
I can change almost anything,

1554
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,923
but I can't change human nature.

1555
02:27:28,216 --> 02:27:31,301
Of course you must protect
Veidt's new utopia.

1556
02:27:32,929 --> 02:27:35,932
What's one more body
amongst the foundations?

1557
02:27:42,396 --> 02:27:44,773
Well, what are you waiting for?

1558
02:27:47,527 --> 02:27:49,069
Do it.

1559
02:27:55,784 --> 02:27:57,161
Do it!

1560
02:27:58,913 --> 02:28:01,457
No!

1561
02:28:20,141 --> 02:28:24,897
I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

1562
02:28:25,981 --> 02:28:28,650
I thought you said
you cared about life again.

1563
02:28:28,734 --> 02:28:30,152
I do.

1564
02:28:31,361 --> 02:28:33,823
I think maybe I'll create some.

1565
02:28:38,411 --> 02:28:40,162
Goodbye, Laurie.

1566
02:29:15,864 --> 02:29:17,282
Come on!

1567
02:29:19,619 --> 02:29:21,077
Come on!

1568
02:29:25,583 --> 02:29:29,003
Dan, a world united and at peace.

1569
02:29:31,047 --> 02:29:32,465
There had to be sacrifice.

1570
02:29:32,548 --> 02:29:37,136
No! You have an idealised mankind,
but you've deformed it.

1571
02:29:37,218 --> 02:29:39,095
You've mutilated it.

1572
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:41,097
That's your legacy.

1573
02:29:49,856 --> 02:29:52,192
That's the real practical joke.

1574
02:30:45,287 --> 02:30:49,375
<i>We repeat, there is nothing wrong

1575
02:30:49,458 --> 02:30:52,795
<i>You are about to participate

1576
02:30:53,129 --> 02:30:56,215
<i>You are about to experience

1577
02:30:56,298 --> 02:30:58,342
<i>which reaches from the inner mind</i>

1578
02:30:58,425 --> 02:31:00,802
to The Outer Limits.

1579
02:31:03,388 --> 02:31:05,640
Sure you don't want a drink?

1580
02:31:06,641 --> 02:31:08,018
I'm okay.

1581
02:31:08,810 --> 02:31:10,228
Cheers.

1582
02:31:11,313 --> 02:31:14,649
Look, there's something I need
to get off my chest.

1583
02:31:15,775 --> 02:31:18,404
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

1584
02:31:21,198 --> 02:31:22,657
Laurel.

1585
02:31:24,075 --> 02:31:26,287
What you must think of me.

1586
02:31:27,203 --> 02:31:29,372
I'm sorry I never told you.

1587
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:34,420
I should have,
but, I don't know, I just felt ashamed.

1588
02:31:34,503 --> 02:31:37,380
- I felt stupid.
-lt doesn't matter.

1589
02:31:39,007 --> 02:31:40,925
People's lives take them strange places.

1590
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:43,219
They do strange things and,

1591
02:31:44,846 --> 02:31:47,475
well, sometimes they can't talk
about them.

1592
02:31:47,975 --> 02:31:49,977
I know how that is.

1593
02:31:50,977 --> 02:31:56,149
But I just want you to know that
you never did anything wrong by me.

1594
02:32:01,197 --> 02:32:04,200
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

1595
02:32:07,202 --> 02:32:09,454
Because he gave me you.

1596
02:32:14,459 --> 02:32:16,003
Thanks, Mom.

1597
02:32:18,338 --> 02:32:19,924
I love you.

1598
02:32:27,597 --> 02:32:30,768
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Sally. Please.

1599
02:32:33,561 --> 02:32:36,397
Excuse me. I've got to go freshen up.

1600
02:32:37,023 --> 02:32:39,025
I'll be right back.

1601
02:32:48,619 --> 02:32:51,329
- S0 how's it going up here?
- Good.

1602
02:32:51,413 --> 02:32:53,790
- How's it going down there?
- Good.

1603
02:32:54,415 --> 02:32:56,668
I think I've got everything working.

1604
02:32:56,752 --> 02:32:59,296
<i>All of Archie's systems are</i> upgraded.

1605
02:32:59,379 --> 02:33:01,298
Finished the tinkering for now

1606
02:33:01,381 --> 02:33:03,884
so all we've got to do is take her out.

1607
02:33:03,968 --> 02:33:06,219
Well, that sounds like a date.

1608
02:33:18,231 --> 02:33:20,609
Are we going to be all right?

1609
02:33:22,486 --> 02:33:26,906
Long as people think Jon's still
watching us, we'll be all right

1610
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:28,700
in the end.

1611
02:33:30,661 --> 02:33:32,871
I know what Jon would say,

1612
02:33:32,954 --> 02:33:34,622
"Nothing ends."

1613
02:33:36,876 --> 02:33:38,627
Nothing ever ends.

1614
02:34:26,717 --> 02:34:30,804
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about any more.

1615
02:34:30,888 --> 02:34:33,557
Everyone in the country,
every country in the world,

1616
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:37,435
they're holding hands now,
singing songs about peace and love.

1617
02:34:38,561 --> 02:34:41,773
It's like living
in a goddamn global hippie commune.

1618
02:34:41,856 --> 02:34:45,693
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's going
to be running for President in '88.

1619
02:34:45,778 --> 02:34:47,737
We could run a piece on that.

1620
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:51,075
Seymour, we don't dignify
absurdities with coverage.

1621
02:34:51,157 --> 02:34:52,784
This is still America, damn it!

1622
02:34:52,868 --> 02:34:55,453
Who wants a cowboy
in the White House?

1623
02:34:55,537 --> 02:34:56,704
Okay.

1624
02:34:57,622 --> 02:34:59,875
I could look for something
in the crank file.

1625
02:34:59,959 --> 02:35:01,334
Crank file.

1626
02:35:01,709 --> 02:35:03,879
Whatever. Take some initiative.

1627
02:35:03,962 --> 02:35:07,256
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

1628
02:35:12,930 --> 02:35:17,308
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 12, 1985.</i>
