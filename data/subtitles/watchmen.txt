Wrong, as usual.
The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe proves
that the Soviet Union's aggression
at the Afghan border
will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.
Issue, the Soviet Union continued
its recent series of military exercises,
conducting a bomb test today
in the Bering Sea,
just 1,500 miles off the southern coast
of Alaska.
President Richard Nixon issued
this warning to the Soviets...
The United States does not start fights.
Let it be clear, we maintain our strength
in order to maintain peace.
So any adversary
should ask themselves,
"Do the consequences
of attacking America
"outweigh the potential benefits?"
As a result of the Soviet activity,
the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists
move the Doomsday Clock up
to five minutes until midnight,
destruction by nuclear war.
Question,
on a scale of zero to ten,
zero meaning impossibility,
ten meaning complete
metaphysical certitude,
what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?
Pat Buchanan.
Zero. The Soviets would never risk
going to war,
when we have
a walking nuclear deterrent on our side.
You're referring, of course,
to Dr Manhattan.
But does Dr Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace?
Eleanor Clift.
Well, it hasn't stopped the Soviet Union
from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.
You don't think it's all just posturing?
Maybe the reason why
the Soviets are doing these bomb tests
is because they feel threatened
by Dr Manhattan, cornered.
Maybe the whole world feels like that.
Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters...
Just a matter of time, I suppose.
It's a joke. It's all a joke.
Mother, forgive me.
That is what I had before!
I was a hero, God damn it!
An act clearly meant to send
a signal to the government in Saigon
that violence and oppression
is not the way to peace.
Good luck, Mr Gorsky.
Get out of here, vigilantes!
They're killers!
Edward Blake. 67 years old.
6'2". A solid 225.
The guy was built like a linebacker.
Yeah, I saw the body.
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.
You mean, apart from being dead?
That's plate glass.
You have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.
He had to have been thrown.
- Check the bedroom?
- Yeah.
Drawers opened, tossed through.
Mattress flipped.
Probably robbery.
Or made to look like one. See this?
Shaking hands with the President.
Whoa! You think Blake was a spook?
Government or black ops?
I think this is way bigger than both of us.
Rorschach's journal, October 12, 1985.
Dog carcass in alley this morning,
tyre tread on burst stomach.
This city is afraid of me.
I have seen its true face.
The streets are extended gutters,
and the gutters are full of blood,
and when the drains finally scab over,
all the vermin will drown.
The accumulated filth
of all their sex and murder
will foam up around their waists
and all the whores and politicians
will look up and shout, "Save us!"
And I'll whisper, "No."
Now the whole world stands
on the brink,
staring down into bloody hell.
All those liberals and intellectuals
and smooth talkers,
and all of a sudden
nobody can think of anything to say.
Beneath me, this awful city,
it screams like an abattoir
full of retarded children.
And the night reeks of fornication
and bad consciences.
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
Somebody knows why.
Somebody knows.
It all started with the gangs.
You know, people tend to forget that.
Pirate outfits, ghosts.
They thought it was funny,
dress up and pull heists.
Of course, as soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street again.
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
'cause of the damn masks.
So, a few of us cops,
we get together and we figure,
"What the heck? We'll mask up, too.
We'll finish what the law couldn't."
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it.
They ran with it
and, oh, boy, we're a national pastime.
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman,
Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice,
Silk Spectre and The Comedian.
Don't get me started on him.
I must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.
I think you were trying to make a point.
Well, my point is
that we had it too easy.
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys,
you guys who picked up
where we left off,
with Nixon forcing you out.
Nixon, that prick.
And to think I voted
for that prick five times.
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?
Wow, it's almost midnight. I ought to go.
Truth?
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.
Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.
Hey, watch with the language.
This is the left hook that floored
Captain Axis, remember?
Next week?
Well, you know, you don't have
to keep humouring me like this.
If you got a hot date or something...
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?
You ever miss it?
- No. You?
- No. Heck, no.
I'll be seeing you.
- Hello, Daniel.
- Rorschach.
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.
No, no. Of course not.
You want me to heat those up for you?
Fine like this.
How have you been keeping?
Out of prison.
So far.
Daniel, look at this.
- Is this bean juice?
- Human bean juice.
Badge belonged to The Comedian.
Blood, too.
He's dead.
Let's talk downstairs.
It could have been a burglary.
Maybe the killer didn't know
who The Comedian was.
An ordinary burglar kill
The Comedian? Ridiculous.
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77,
knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.
Maybe.
Or maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.
You don't think that's a little paranoid?
That what they say about me now?
Paranoid?
Look, Comedian made a lot of enemies
over the years, even among his friends.
Speaking of friends,
how's Hollis Mason?
He wrote that book, said some
bad things about The Comedian in it.
I don't like what you're implying.
And I like being followed even less.
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someones gunning for masks.
You were never that sentimental.
An attack on one is
an attack on all of us.
What do you suggest we do about it?
Retribution.
Watchmen are over.
Says Tricky Dick.
Says me.
Nobody knows who you are.
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.
That what you have now? A normal life?
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies,
past the human cockroaches
talking about their heroin
and child pornography,
do you really feel normal?
At least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.
No.
You're hiding in plain sight.
Be seeing you, Dan.
There's a maintenance hatch
that will let you out two blocks north.
Yeah, I remember.
Came here often
when we were partners.
Those were great times,
huh, Rorschach?
- What happened?
- You quit.
Mr Veidt, to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen
ever to reveal their true identity
to the world,
the first being Hollis Mason.
And you've certainly
profited greatly by it,
turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias,
into a billion-dollar industry.
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering...
I understand
there's even a movie in the works.
I'm not hearing a question, Mr Roth.
I'm sorry. Do you think...
The other Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind
some of my old colleagues
might see it that way,
just as you're clearly aware that biased
journalism sells more magazines.
The merchandising arm
of Veidt Industries is funding
our work with Dr Manhattan.
Now, we recently expanded
our research facility in Antarctica
in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy,
that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.
Now, it doesn't take a political scientist
to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological,
it's based upon fear,
fear of not having enough.
But if we make resources infinite,
we make war obsolete.
Iwould hope
the other Watchmen understand that,
wherever they may be.
Thanks for your time.
You look good, Adrian.
Dan, it's been too long.
S0, Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?
You think it's possible?
I think, statistically,
one murder doesn't equal a trend.
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.
I mean, so was The Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.
You know that better than anyone.
I'm not here 'cause I miss him.
Well, it's obviously occurred
to Rorschach
that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.
Actually, the whole world knows yours.
That's why I'm warning you first.
Thank you, Dan.
But I fear there's something
much more real to worry about
than Rorschach's mask-killer.
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?
The Soviets have
51,000 warheads stockpiled.
Even if Jon stops 99% of them,
the 1% that get through can still kill
every living thing on Earth.
Even Dr Manhattan can't be
everywhere at once.
Rorschach's journal, October 13, 1985.
8:30 p. m.
Meeting with Dreiberg left
bad taste in mouth.
A flabby failure
who sits whimpering in his basement.
Why are so few of us
left active, healthy,
and without personality disorders?
The first Nite Owl
runs an auto-repair shop.
The first Silk Spectre
is a bloated, ageing whore
dying in a California rest resort.
Dollar Bill got his cape
stuck in a revolving door
where he got gunned down.
Silhouette murdered,
a victim of her own indecent lifestyle.
Mothman's in an asylum in Maine.
Only two names remain on my list.
Both share private quarters at
Rockefeller Military Research Centre.
I shall go to them.
I shall go tell the indestructible man
that someone plans to murder him.
Good evening, Rorschach.
Dr Manhattan, you know why I'm here.
Yes.
But you're going to leave disappointed.
Rorschach! You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.
Nice to see you, too, Silk Spectre.
I have a real name I've been using
a couple of years now. Try it.
Whatever you say, Laurie.
What are you doing here?
The Comedian is dead.
Rorschach wants me to look
into my future,
see if the killer is
ever publicly identified.
I already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you, too.
Even if I wanted to help,
my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.
I cannot see it clearly.
Interference? Caused by what?
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war,
the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons,
particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time,
therefore obscuring
my vision of the present.
- I must return to my work.
- Wait a minute.
What if that's why someone wants us
out of the way?
So we can't do anything to stop it?
Good bye, Rorschach.
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.
I'm not leaving
till I've had my say!
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days, Jon.
I didn't want to worry you prematurely.
If Adrian and I can solve
the energy crisis, war may be averted.
But you always say
that time is simultaneous.
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?
If only you could perceive time as I do.
Please, let me show you.
Magic! Dreams!
That is what I had before!
I was a hero, God damn it!
It's not my fault you got old!
What do you have to complain about?
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child!
Why don't you call your friend Eddie?
Maybe he can give you a better life.
It was a mistake! One time!
- Guy tries to rape you...
- Stop!
Your mind goes to dark places and you
wonder why I keep the worst from you.
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?
You want to ask me
to go to dinner with you,
like we used to,
but you won't. You know I can't.
S0 you'll call Dan, which is only natural.
You deserve the comfort
of an old friend.
Dan Dreiberg's table?
Did you know that he and HJ were...
I had no idea.
You remember that crazy guy?
What did he call himself?
Captain Carnage.
Used to pretend he was a supervillain,
just so he could get beat up
all the time?
Yeah. He tried that on me once.
ljust walked away.
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight, yelling,
"Punish me! Punish me!"
And I'm just saying, "No, get lost."
God, whatever happened to him?
Well, he pulled that on Rorschach,
and Rorschach dropped him down
an elevator shaft.
- Oh, my God. That's not even funny.
- Yeah, it is.
- A little funny.
- A little bit.
It's really good to see you again.
It's great seeing you, too, Laurie.
Why'd we do it, Dan?
Dress up like that?
No one else would.
Yeah,
but do you remember my costume?
All that tight latex? I mean, it was awful.
Yeah, yeah, awful.
But I didn't want to disappoint Mother.
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.
I think the Keene Act was
the best thing that ever happened to us.
Well, we'll live longer, anyway.
What?
Jon thinks, unless he can
do something about it,
that there's going to be nuclear war.
Soon.
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.
He just keeps getting
further away from me.
Everyone.
I can't even tell if he actually cares
about me any more,
or if he's just pretending.
If he's pretending, it means he cares.
Hold on, I'll get the door.
Thanks, Dan.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs,
but there don't seem to be
that many laughs around these days.
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.
Laurie? ls that you?
Thought you'd be used
to travelling that way by now.
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.
Well, it beats flying coach.
Margarita?
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana Bible.
It's a little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.
- He sent you this?
- Sure.
They're very valuable, like antiques.
- Mother, this is gross!
- I think it's kind of flattering.
Why do you always call me "Mother"
when you're mad?
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.
I saw it in the paper.
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.
Finally got his punch line, I guess.
- Poor Eddie.
- Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?
Laurie, you're still young.
You don't know.
Things change.
What happened
happened 40 years ago.
I'm 67 years old.
Every day,
the future looks a little bit darker.
But the past, even the grimy parts of it,
keep on getting brighter.
I've got spots in my eyes.
Let me fish those out for you.
Stop it, Eddie.
- Thank you, Weegee.
- Thank you, Mr Owl.
And tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.
- Sounds good.
- Wow, a real photo session.
I wonder how my hair will look.
Go ahead. I'll be there in five.
Eddie.
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.
Sure I did.
Come on, baby. I know what you need.
I mean, you got to have
some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.
I said no, Eddie.
- No, spelled Y-E-S.
- No, spelled N-O.
- All right?
- Come on, sweetheart.
Eddie...
You little bastard!
This what you like?
This what makes you hot?
What? Yeah!
Things are tough all over, cupcake.
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.
The Comedian has a little bit of both.
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers,
but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty,
O holy and merciful Saviour.
Thou most worthyjudge eternal.
Suffer us not at our last hour for any...
Thank you! Thank you!
Fireworks. You got to be kidding me.
Now, you'd think this goddamn country
had enough fireworks.
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam,
I think it might have driven us crazy.
You know, as a country.
But we didn't, thanks to you.
You sound bitter.
Me? Bitter? Fuck, no.
I think it's hilarious.
- Jesus Christ.
- Mr Eddie?
Just what I fucking needed.
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.
There's nothing to talk about.
You see, I'm leaving.
I'm going to forget about you
and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.
- Get the fuck out of here.
- No.
- Get the fuck out of here!
- You will remember.
You will remember me
and my country forever!
My face!
Blake. Don't.
Blake!
She was pregnant.
- And you gunned her down.
- That's right.
And you know what? You watched me.
You could have turned the gun
into steam, the bullets into mercury,
the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.
You're drifting out of touch, Doc.
God help us all.
Medic!
Most holy and merciful Saviour.
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.
In the midst of life, we are in death.
Of whom may we...
Welcome to the first ever meeting...
This is all bullshit.
You know, for a guy
who calls himself The Comedian,
I can never tell when you're joking.
Watchmen, that's the real joke.
It didn't work 15 years ago,
it sure as hell ain't gonna work now,
just 'cause you want to keep playing
cowboys and Indians.
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.
Look, Rorschach and I have made
real headway
on the gang problem
by working together.
With a group this size,
it seems like a publicity stunt.
I'm not in it for the ink.
We can do so much more.
We can save this world
with the right leadership.
Yeah.
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?
I mean, hell, you're the smartest man
on the planet.
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.
Yeah, but it takes a room full of morons
to think they're small enough
for you to handle.
You know, mankind's been
trying to kill each other off
since the beginning of time.
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.
Ain't nothing gonna matter once those
nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.
Then Ozymandias here will be
the smartest man on the cinder.
For as much as it hath pleased
almighty God
to take unto himself
the soul of our dear, departed brother,
let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...
Yeah!
Yeah!
We've got to get rid
of these Watchmen!
Police!
Attention, citizens!
We are trying to maintain order!
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over!
Please, there's no need for violence!
God damn it.
All right, that's how you want to do it?
There's no need for violence!
FUCK you!
This is getting heavy.
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.
How long can we keep this up?
Congress is pushing through some
new bill that's gonna outlaw masks.
Our days are numbered.
Till then, it's like you always say,
we're society's only protection.
- From what?
- Are you kidding me?
From themselves. Son of a bitch.
No, Comedian, wait!
Get your stinking hands off me.
What the hell happened to us?
What happened
to the American dream?
What happened
to the American dream?
It came true! You're looking at it.
Edgar William Jacobi,
also known as Edgar William Vaughn,
also known as Moloch.
What are you talking about?
I'm a retired businessman...
Lie again, Moloch,
I break another finger.
I did my time. I'm not Moloch any more.
What do you want from me?
Heard you attended Blake's funeral.
Why?
I just felt I should
pay my respects to The Comedian.
How'd you know he was The Comedian?
He broke in here! A week ago.
He had his mask off.
He was drunk.
Enemies! For decades!
- Why should he visit you?
- I don't know.
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.
He was upset! He was crying.
Crying? The Comedian?
He was babbling,
not making any sense.
I was pissing in my pants.
I thought he was going to kill me.
What did he say?
It's a joke.
It's all a fucking joke.
You know, I thought I knew how it was.
I thought I knew how the world was.
I've done some bad things.
I did bad things to women.
I shot kids in Nam, you know.
But that was fucking war!
This... I never done anything like this.
God, here I am, spilling my guts
to one of my archenemies.
But the truth is...
The truth is,
you're the closest thing to a friend I got.
What the fuck does that say?
Shit.
And your name,
your name was on the list,
along with Janey,
whatever the fuck her name is.
Manhattan's old girl.
Mother, forgive me.
And then he left.
I swear I don't know what the hell
he was talking about.
Funny story.
Sounds unbelievable.
Probably true.
S0, that's it?
- L'm clean?
- You?
Clean?
Amygdalin. This is phoney medication
made from apricot pits. It's illegal.
Come on.
Look, please don't confiscate that.
L'm trying anything-
I have cancer.
What kind of cancer?
Yeah?
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?
That ain't the kind I got.
Rorschach 's journal, October 16.
Want some of this? Fifty bucks.
I'll suck your...
Thought about Moloch's story.
- Come on, freak.
- Could all be lies.
A revenge scheme planned
during his years behind bars.
FUCK you!
I make more in a week than you make
in a year, you fucking homo!
But if it's true, what could have possibly
scared The Comedian enough
to cry in front of Moloch?
What was it he saw?
And that list he mentioned...
Edward Blake, The Comedian.
Born 1918.
Buried in the rain. Murdered.
ls that what happens to us?
No time for friends?
Only our enemies leave roses.
Violent lives ending violently.
Blake understood.
Humans are savage in nature.
No matter how much
you try to dress it up, to disguise it,
Blake saw society's true face.
Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.
I heard a joke once.
Man goes to doctor,
says he's depressed,
life seems harsh and cruel.
Says he feels all alone
in a threatening world.
Doctor says treatment is simple.
"The great clown Pagliacci is in town.
Go see him. That should pick you up."
Man bursts into tears.
"But, Doctor," he says, "I am Pagliacci. "
Good joke. Everybody, laugh.
Roll on snare drum. Curtains.
What time do you have
to be at your interview?
Don't worry. We've got plenty of time.
Wow. Your finger's like licking a battery.
God, Jon, stop!
- What are you doing?
- Please don't be upset.
I always thought you liked this.
No.
I don't... No.
I don't want that.
I don't know
what stimulates you any more.
Look, I know you were just trying...
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?
My work with Adrian is
at a critical stage right now.
- I didn't think it was necessary to...
- To what?
To what, to tell me which one of you
was giving me a pity fuck?
My attention was
completely focused on you.
If you think there's a problem with
my attitude, I am prepared to discuss it.
You know how everything in this world
fits together, except people.
What am I to you,
another puzzle to be solved?
Have your men stand back.
I'm teleporting the reactor
to Karnak now.
You're my only remaining link
to the world.
I don't want that responsibility any more.
He's all yours.
Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.
No, she won't.
He's been called many things,
hero, weapon,
linchpin of our national security,
deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.
Later tonight, Dr Manhattan will answer
my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview,
brought to you commercial-free
by Veidt Enterprises.
- Who is it?
-lt's Laurie.
Sorry. ljust had this new lock installed.
I didn't know where else to go.
It's okay. Come in.
What's wrong?
I left Jon.
God. I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I'm here. I just...
I don't know anybody else.
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.
That's okay. You probablyjust had
an argument or something.
No, Dan.
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't remember
what they are.
It's like this world, this real world,
to him, it's like walking through a mist.
And people are just shadows,
shadows in a fog.
God, how did everything get
so tangled up?
I'm sorry, Dan.
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.
Come on. I'm glad you came over.
I was just going to see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.
You're more than welcome to join.
In fact, I insist.
Terrific. Dr Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.
But he just...
We don't have time for makeup.
That blue is too light for television.
Is that dark enough?
Yeah, that's dark enough.
- Seymour!
- Bernie, how's tricks?
Go easy, Ed.
The girl.
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
butjust play it cool,
-and try not to get into any tight corners.
- Dr Jonathan Osterman,
a renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident,
was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.
Today, the world knows him
as Dr Manhattan.
Welcome.
Thank you.
That's right.
Ms Black, you have the first question.
Dr Manhattan, as you know,
the Doomsday Clock is
a symbolic clock face
analogising humankind's proximity
to extinction,
midnight representing
the threat of nuclear war.
As of now,
it stands at four minutes to midnight.
Would you agree that we're
that close to annihilation?
My father was a watchmaker.
He abandoned it when Einstein
discovered that time is relative.
I would only agree that a symbolic clock
is as nourishing to the intellect
as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.
So you're saying there is no danger?
Even in a world
without nuclear weapons,
there would still be danger.
And would you say, as so many claim,
that you are in fact a god,
given that you see
the past and future simultaneously?
I can only see my own past,
my own future.
I am not omniscient.
Doug Roth? Your question.
Speaking of your past, Dr Manhattan,
do you remember
a man named Wally Weaver?
Yes.
We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.
- He died of cancer.
- He was a good man.
How about Edgar Jacobi,
also known as the supervillain, Moloch?
You encountered him several times
in the '60s, battles, conflicts...
Did you know
that he has cancer as well?
I wasn't told.
And what about
General Anthony Randolph?
He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.
Cancer.
You're suggesting I was the cause.
From where I 'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.
Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.
A live human body
and a deceased human body
have the same number of particles.
Structurally, there's no difference.
All right, let's settle down, please.
What about Janey Slater?
You think it makes a difference to her?
- Janey?
- Your ex-girlfriend?
She was a physicist, too.
You saw each other for 11 years.
- Doug, one question at a time.
- She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?
You were the world to me, Jon.
You were my whole life.
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?
Janey, I wasn't told.
I stuck by you after the accident.
I gave you everything!
This is how you repay me?
Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
Damn you, Jon! God damn you!
Janey, wait.
That's it! This interview is over!
Get up there! Get up there!
Get those cameras off!
Everybody, back off!
Everybody, back off! I need
some backup here! Leave him alone!
Please.
If everyone would just go away
and leave me alone.
Do you care to comment?
I said, leave me alone!
I am looking at the stars.
They are so far away.
And their light takes so long
to reach us.
All we ever see of stars are
their old photographs.
It's July, 1959, and I am in love.
That was great! Pick it up tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Seventy-five cents.
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.
Gosh, Jon,
I wish he gave us a little notice.
I'm sure I made a face.
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.
Her name is Janey Slater.
She is a physicist like me.
I am 30 years old.
We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.
It is February 12th, 1981.
Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.
That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.
A month from now,
the accident awaits me.
You have a healthy appetite.
I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.
Hey, let's just wait a second.
I cross the room
to the intrinsic field centre.
I find my watch.
When I get to the door,
Wally is turning white.
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock!
I am terrified.
Jon!
I'm sorry, Jon.
But I can't...
Janey, don't leave me! Don't leave me!
It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.
She buys me a beer,
the first time a woman
has done this for me.
As she passes me
the cold, perspiring glass,
our fingers touch.
Yes, Jon, good.
Now it's just a question
of reassembling the components
in the correct sequence.
I feel fear for the last time.
A token funeral is held.
There is nothing to bury.
Janey frames the snapshot.
It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.
A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.
A few days later, a partially-muscled
skeleton stands in the hallway
and screams for a moment
before vanishing.
God.
Jon?
Is that you?
Nations around the world still reeling
from this morning's announcement,
possibly the most significant event
in recent history.
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.
They call me Dr Manhattan.
They explain the name has been chosen
for the ominous associations it will raise
in America's enemies.
They are shaping me
into something gaudy,
something lethal.
In January, 1971,
President Nixon asks me
to intervene in Vietnam,
something that his predecessors
would not ask.
A week later, the conflict ends.
Some of the Vietcong forces
want to surrender to me personally.
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.
In it, he calls my arrival
"the dawn of the superhero."
I am not sure ifl know what that means.
You see, at the time, I was misquoted.
I never said, "The superman exists,
and he is American."
What I said was
"God exists, and he is American."
Now, if you begin to feel an intense
and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept,
don't be alarmed.
That indicates only
that you are still sane.
It is Christmas, 1963.
Janey tells me
she is afraid and worried.
She says I am like a god now.
I tell her/ don't think there is a God.
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.
I tell her/ still want her.
And that I always will.
As I lie to her,
it is September 4th, 1970.
I am in a room full of people
wearing disguises.
A very young girl looks at me
and smiles.
She's beautiful.
After each long kiss, she plants
a smaller, gentler one upon my lips,
like a signature.
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.
She bursts into angry tears, asking
if it's because she's getting older.
It's true.
She's ageing more noticeably
every day,
while I am standing still.
I prefer the stillness here.
I am tired of Earth, these people.
I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.
They claim their labours are
to build a heaven.
Yet their heaven is
populated with horrors.
Perhaps the world is not made.
Perhaps nothing is made.
A clock without a craftsman.
It's too late.
Always has been,
always will be
momm.
Mr President,
the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.
They are testing us
to see if we manufactured
Dr Manhattan's disappearance
to coax a move out of them.
How soon can we be ready
for a pre-emptive strike?
Two days.
We have a 54% chance
of wiping out the entire USSR
before they get their missiles airborne.
Assuming conservative projections
of how many Soviet warheads
we destroy beforehand,
we'll lose all of the East Coast.
The last gasp
of the Harvard establishment.
Let's see them think
their way out of fission.
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift could head south.
Mexico would catch the worst of it.
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.
Not so bad,
all things considered.
Mr President, what would you like to do?
Take us to DefCon 2.
Begin fuelling the bombers.
Dr Manhattan has two days.
After that, humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.
Let's just hope he's on our side.
Without Dr Manhattan around to bully
the Russians into peace, Mr Veidt,
people are going to need
good, old-fashioned energy to rely on.
You can understand.
The world can'tjust quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.
You'll dismantle our entire economy
overnight.
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."
We mightjust have to make
a public inquiry
into any past Communist affiliations
you might have had.
Mr lacocca, gentlemen,
I respect your position
and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.
You want to know my past?
Okay. Happily.
It's a matter of public record
that by 17 both my parents were dead,
leaving me alone.
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.
I mean, they say I'm the smartest man
in the world,
but the truth is I've often felt stupid
at being unable to relate to anyone.
Well, anyone living, that is.
The only person
with whom I felt any kinship
died 300 years before the birth of Christ.
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great,
as you know him.
His vision of a united world was...
Well, it was unprecedented.
Iwanted, needed,
to match his accomplishments,
and so I resolved to apply
antiquity's teachings to our world today.
And so began my path to conquest.
Conquest not of men,
but of the evils that beset them.
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power
are like a drug
and you gentlemen, along with
foreign interests, are the pushers.
- Now, listen.
- No.
You listen.
The world will survive,
and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.
So let's cut to it, shall we?
Privately, I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.
I can buy and sell you three times over,
which is something you should factor
into your decision,
should you choose to make
our disagreement public.
I think you know the way out.
Gentlemen.
The toy people want to talk to you
about some new villains
for the Ozymandias line.
Seems all the old villains are dead.
Mr Veidt?
I think I have some ideas.
Mr Veidt?
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
He's got a poison capsule!
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.
Give me a name!
Suicide pill.
Potassium cyanide. The guy was dead
before he hit the ground.
Thanks, hon.
Then Rorschach was right.
This wasn't some lone nut.
It's an organisation,
well-funded, well-equipped.
But who'd want to kill us now?
I don't know. But it's not safe out here.
- S0, no word from Jon?
- No.
Well, listen,
why don't you come stay with me?
No. I... That's sweet,
but I wouldn't wanna impose.
Oh, no. Think of it as doing me a favour.
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.
Okay.
Rorschach's journal, October 21, 1985.
On 43rd and 7th,
saw Dreiberg and Jupiter leaving diner.
They didn't know me without my mask.
An affair?
Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile,
make room for Dreiberg?
Does Manhattan even have
a hean' to break?
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.
At his apartment, I found clues.
Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.
I've seen the logo before.
At Moloch's.
Someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man today, Moloch.
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.
More than just a delivery service,
I take it.
Last time I was here, I saw a pension
cheque written from the same company.
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?
Rorschach!
This is the police!
We know you're in there!
No! No!
If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed!
No! No, no, no!
Come on.
Let's make it a nice, clean surrender.
Walked right into it!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!
- Never, never surrender.
- All right.
- I hope you're ready, hero!
- When you are.
One,
two,
three.
- Get him!
- Come on.
Christ, he stinks!
- Get that mask off him!
- I got it!
No! My face! Give me back my face!
The masked vigilante, Rorschach,
was apprehended
and he's been identified
as Walter Kovacs,
a 35-year-old white male.
Little is yet known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with
the murder of one Edgar Jacobi,
found shot in the head at point blank
range at his home in the Bronx.
Several police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...
Rorschach!
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!
Rorschach!
Walter Kovacs.
ls that your name? Walter?
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.
You cooperate with me,
and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.
In a hospital.
I believe that would be good for you.
But the authorities want to put you
with the general population.
- Prison's a prison.
- Yes.
But the difference is, down there,
you'd be eaten alive.
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.
Tell me what you see.
A pretty butterfly.
Well, now, what do you see here?
Mom? ls he hurting you?
You got a fucking kid in here!
- I get that at home.
- Bastard!
I should have had that abortion!
Some nice flowers.
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.
Did you catch any diseases from her,
whore's son?
Listen to me, retard!
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?
Clouds.
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.
You don't like me.
All right. Why is that, exactly?
You're fat. Wealthy.
Liberal sensibilities.
You want to know about Rorschach?
I'll tell you about Rorschach.
I was investigating a kidnap case.
Blaire Roche. Six-year-old girl.
I was young then. Too soft on criminals.
I let them live.
Broke a man's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.
I knew the girl was here,
but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.
And then I found her.
It was dark
when the murderer got back.
As dark as it gets.
God.
Who's out there? Who is it?
Who is it?
What the...
What... What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!
Fuck.
You think I had
something to do with that girl?
I found that.
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing!
Okay, I confess.
I kidnapped her. I killed her.
Arrest me.
What? Arrest me! I did it! I said I did it!
Christ!
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in! I need help!
No, don't! Don't do that!
Take me in! Don't!
No!
Men get arrested.
Dogs get put down.
Tremors of impact shook my arm.
Warm blood splashed my face.
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.
From then on,
there was only Rorschach.
You see, Doctor,
God didn't kill that little girl,
fate didn't butcher her, and destiny
didn't feed her to those dogs.
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.
From then on, I knew.
God doesn't make the world this way.
We do.
Hey, Rorschach!
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous, too.
- Ain't that right? That's right.
- That's right.
You know, maybe I can give you
an autograph, huh?
What you say, big boy?
None of you seem to understand.
- L'm not locked in here with you.
- All right, that's it!
You're locked in here with me!
Lauﬂe!
Shit!
- Hold on!
- Fuck!
I got it, I got it!
So sorry. I was snooping around
and I must have hit the wrong button.
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.
- Okay.
-l'm fine. ljust... lfeel so bad.
No, don't worry. It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.
- Archie survived that.
- Archie?
Well, short for Archimedes,
Merlin's pet owl.
Stupid nickname.
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died,
which always surprised me.
I mean, he was...
I think he was disappointed
that I went into crime fighting
instead of following him.
Guess I was just more interested
in birds and aeroplanes, mythology.
Must be nice having a secret identity.
A secret place
that nobody knows about.
You can just come down here
and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.
Nobody watching you.
You wanna try those on?
This...
There we go.
Wow, these rock.
They amplify the spectral range.
Thermal imaging.
They work even better in the dark.
You can see me, right?
I can see everything.
I remember, no matter how black it got,
whenever I looked
through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.
This must be the way
Jon sees the world.
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.
Put those away when you're done.
The Soviets are finding themselves
bogged down
in bloody, house-to-house fighting.
Casualties on both sides
are said to be in the hundreds.
Civilian deaths are also alarmingly high.
Meanwhile...
Dan.
Jon sees a lot of things,
but he doesn't see me.
Well...
Sorry.
Come here.
- What's the matter?
- If you could just move a little.
- Okay.
- Yeah. There you go.
Dan. What's wrong?
Sorry, I...
Yeah, ljust need a couple of minutes.
Hell.
It's been a long time, Rorschach.
Big Figure. Small world.
I like that.
But, you know,
it is a small world in here.
And I've been in it
for how long now, Lloyd?
- Almost 15 years, Mr Figure.
- That's right.
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.
S0, Rorschach,
that guy you burned is dying,
could go any minute.
You know, by my count,
there are more than 50 people in here
that you put away.
I've been talking to every one of them,
and they're all dying
to get a piece of you.
This place is gonna explode!
Then you die by inches.
Tall order.
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole!
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.
Dan?
Is everything all right?
God, I'm tired of being afraid.
Afraid of war,
afraid of the mask killer,
and afraid of this goddamn suit
and how much I need it.
Me, too.
Soto hell with it. Let's take Archie out.
You're serious.
I used to be a masked avenger, too,
remember?
I'm used to going out
at 3:00 in the morning
and doing something stupid.
Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.
Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.
Let's go.
- I can see it!
- All right, hold on!
Dan, there are kids in there!
Everyone, please stay where you are!
Try to remain calm.
We're gonna get you out of there!
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.
I'll get you close.
Let's go!
All right.
We're all set.
Is that everyone?
- Bye.
Bye-bye!
I can't believe we did that.
- Probably lock us up with Rorschach.
- Who cares?
World War lll could start tomorrow.
Right?
Right.
Yeah!
He's dead, Rorschach.
While everyone's distracted,
we thought we'd bring you
a little housewarming gift.
Something from the machine shop.
Hey, boss, you notice?
None of that
"small world, tall order" crap.
'Cause he knows once we slice open
his lock, he's next on the block.
Fatchance.
You're dead, Rorschach!
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?
Your hands, my pleasure.
I can't reach the lock.
Should I cut the bars?
This riot won't last.
I've been waiting 15 years for this.
I'm sorry, Lawrence,
but you're in the way of my revenge.
Nothing personal, big guy.
Boss! Wait!
Now you find out what the score is.
One-nothing. Come and get me.
Come on!
S0, I've been thinking.
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.
I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
- What?
- Someone set him up.
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
itjust doesn't make sense.
You didn't get it.
Yeah, but breaking into
a maximum-security prison
is a little different than putting out a fire.
Yeah, you're right.
It'll be more fun.
Hurry, Lloyd! lwant to smell
this son of a bitch cooking.
Yes.
No.
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before.
Obvious, really.
Two-nothing. Your move.
Out of the way! Hurry!
No!
Where's my face?
No, don't kill me!
Your turn, Doctor.
Tell me, what do you see?
Don't move!
Rorschach!
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.
For Christ's sake!
Hey, you all right?
Yeah. Just heavy, you know?
The war. Jailbreak.
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Hello, Laurie.
Jon. TV said you were on Mars.
I am on Mars.
You and I are about to have
a conversation there.
What are you talking about?
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.
- Laurie, don't.
- Dan, trust me.
I have to go.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Forgive me.
These things sometimes slip my mind.
It won't happen again.
That's comforting.
Oh, my God.
I'm on Mars.
We need to hit up underworld contacts,
squeeze people.
Sure. Why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.
You've gone too soft, too trusting.
Especially with women.
Okay, no. Listen. I've had it with that!
God, who do you think you are,
Rorschach?
You live off people while insulting them,
and no one complains because
they think you're a goddamn lunatic!
I'm sorry. I...
I shouldn't have said that, man.
Daniel,
you are a good friend.
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.
Forget it.
It's okay, man. Let's do it your way.
Oh, God.
Pyramid Transnational!
Anyone heard of it?
You bastards.
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?
Back off or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face!
Everybody, stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt.
Dead now. Did you know him?
No.
Yeah, yeah!
I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
You're a felon.
Was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.
- Told by whom?
- My contact, Miss Slater.
Janey Slater works for Pyramid, too?
Yeah, she was real nice.
She said hiring ex-cons was
part of a company programme,
give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!
Janey Slater. Manhattan's old girlfriend.
Adrian's people might help us find out
who's underwriting Pyramid.
Follow the money.
This is where we hold our conversation.
In it, you ask me to stop
the imminent nuclear war.
But why would I save a world
I no longer have any stake in?
Then do it for me
if you really care.
When you left me, I left Earth.
Does that not show you that I care?
My red world here now
means more to me than your blue one.
Let me show you.
Bombers are fuelled and ready, sir.
It's time, gentlemen.
Take us to DefCon 1.
Not in penthouse. Not in office.
What nocturnal proclivities entice
a man with everything
out into the night at this hour?
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.
Maybe he keeps it on file.
- Something's not right.
- Agreed.
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess,
all work for Pyramid.
Moloch said The Comedian mentioned
a list with his and Slater's name on it.
Whoever owns Pyramid could be giving
these people cancer,
setting Manhattan up.
Funny.
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world,
believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.
Pharaohs?
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.
See what
the corporate head-peepers say.
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.
"If the only remaining ties
were to be severed,
"we predict total detachment
from the human condition."
I'm in.
No.
Congratulations, Mr Veidt.
Dr Manhattan's energy reactor is online.
Your support and your enthusiasm
is what has led to this triumph.
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.
Cheers.
What in life
does not deserve celebrating?
This is the new Karnak.
This represents the culmination
of a dream more than 2,000 years old,
a dream now assured because
of your unquestioning assistance.
And for this, I am ashamed,
ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.
To the pharaohs,
their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants,
buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.
Sleep well, gentlemen.
Our new peaceful world
will be indebted
to your great sacrifice.
Bubastis.
Rorschach 's journal, final entry.
Veidt's behind everything.
Why? What's his endgame?
I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.
Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.
He could kill us both alone in the snow.
That's where we're going now,
Antarctica.
Whether I'm alive or dead
upon this reading,
I hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.
I live my life free of compromise
and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.
Rorschach, November 1.
Can't you just tell me how this all ends
and save us the trouble?
lt ends with you in tears.
Tears?
So you don't come back to Earth?
At some point, yes.
The streets are filled with death.
Jon, please! You have to stop this!
Everyone will die!
And the universe will not even notice.
In my opinion, the existence of life
is a highly overrated phenomenon.
Just look around you.
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map,
flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.
S0, tell me, how would all of this
be greatly improved by an oil pipeline?
BY a shopping mall?
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.
Oh, God, Jon!
- Only what can happen does happen.
- Just stop your bullshit!
Land this thing. Now.
As you wish.
You know what?
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom
and all the other worthless humans!
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears
and, look, nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.
You complain that I refuse to see
life on life's terms,
yet you continuously refuse to see
things from my perspective.
You shut out what you're afraid of.
I'm not afraid.
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me.
Do that thing you do.
Magic! Dreams!
That is what I had before!
I was a hero, God damn it!
It's not my fault you got old!
What do you have to complain about?
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child!
Why don't you call your friend Eddie?
Maybe he can give you a better life.
Even the grimy parts of it
keep on getting brighter.
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.
You're The Comedian, right?
You were pretty cool in there.
You know, your mom, she was one of
the all-time champion beauties.
You got her eyes, you know.
- You have that...
- Take your hands off her!
Hey, doll. Long time no see.
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car. Now.
Are there no depths you won't sink to?
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his,
you know, old friend's daughter?
Drive.
It was a mistake! One time!
Guy tries to rape you and years later
you let him finish the job?
What? Were you drunk orjust lonely?
Am I ever going to live this down?
Lauﬂe.
No.
No, not him.
The Comedian was your father.
No!
No! No!
No!
My life is just one big joke.
I don't think your life is a joke.
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry if I don't trust
your sense of humour.
Will you smile
if I admit I was wrong?
About what?
Miracles.
Events with astronomical odds of
occurring, like oxygen turning into gold.
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect that,
in human coupling,
millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life
for generation after generation,
until, finally,
your mother loves a man,
Edward Blake, The Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate,
and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds,
it's you,
only you,
that emerged.
To distil so specific a form
from all that chaos
is like turning air into gold.
A miracle.
And so I was wrong.
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.
We got a bearing
on that artificial structure.
Heat signature's off the chart.
Veidt.
I don't like the way Archie's kicking.
- The engines.
- They're icing up.
- Hold on to something.
- Daniel, you're coming in too low.
Don't wish to interfere
with running your ship,
but perhaps you should pull up
sharply before...
I know!
I'm trying to pull him up, God damn it!
I'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up de-icing,
but it's gonna take a while,
and we don't have time to wait.
- You need something warmer.
-l'm fine like this.
What is it, girl?
Adrian's a pacifist.
He's a vegetarian, for Christ's sakes.
He's never killed anyone in his life.
Hitler was vegetarian.
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get a second chance.
Gentlemen, welcome.
Adrian, we know everything.
- Then what's there to discuss, Dan?
- Plenty.
- You killed Comedian.
- May he rest in peace.
Blake figured it out first.
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,
making sure
we weren 't rocking the boat.
Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak,
and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.
Even I couldn't predict he'd be
the one to have a change of heart.
S0 I had to kill him.
Then I neutralised Jon. No easy task.
I put roughly two billion dollars
into tachyon research
to block Jon's vision of the future.
You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.
Got him to leave the planet.
I've known Jon long enough to see
he isn't devoid of emotion.
His subtle facial twitches
wouldn't be noticed by the layman,
but, to me,
he might as well have been sobbing.
All I needed to do was
tug on the thread.
The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt
when he came to believe he'd given
cancer to the people he loved
was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.
Your bullshit assassin!
You paid him to throw us off.
Mr Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.
lput a cyanide capsule in his mouth,
leaving only one loose end.
You and your mask killer theory,
one you followed with the tenacity
of a true sociopath.
I tipped off the police,
and once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.
Sorry to disappoint you.
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.
Nuclear war? Human extinction?
Of course, my moral safeguards gave
me pause at the necessary sacrifice.
A few key regions around the globe,
New York, Los Angeles,
Moscow, Hong Kong,
disintegrated in an instant.
Fifteen million people killed
by Dr Manhattan himself.
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War Ill.
Jon wouldn't do that.
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.
The energy breakthrough
I was working on just came to fruition.
All these years,
Jon was helping me replicate his power,
unaware of how I plan to use it.
You see,
The Comedian was right.
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation,
so in order to save this planet,
I had to trick it
with the greatest practical joke
in human history.
- Killing millions?
- To save billions.
A necessary crime.
You know we can't let you do that.
"Do that," Rorschach?
I'm not a comic book villain.
Do you seriously think I'd explain
my masterstroke to you
if there were
even the slightest possibility
you could affect the outcome?
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.
Jesus Christ, Henry!
Why the hell didn't we get
a launch detection?
It's not the Soviets, sir.
Intel indicates the energy signature
was generated by
Dr Manhattan.
Jon.
Interference.
Cataclysmic interference.
I can't believe it happened.
This wasn't caused
by nuclear warheads.
It was me.
I did this.
What do you mean, you did this?
Not directly.
It was made to look like I did it.
Adrian.
Speak of the devil.
- Jon“.
- I know.
Must stop him.
- Killed Blake, killed millions.
- Wait here.
Adrian, stop this.
The tachyons were clever.
But even if I can't predict where you are,
I can turn the walls to glass.
I should thank you.
I'd almost forgotten
the excitement of not knowing,
the delights of uncertainty.
Forgive me, girl.
You're such an asshole.
Veidt, you bastard!
- If you've hurt her, I'll...
- Dan,
grow UP-
My new world demands
less obvious heroism.
Your schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation
is your only triumph.
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.
I'm very disappointed.
Reassembling myself was
the first trick I learned.
It didn't kill Osterman.
Did you really think it would kill me?
I have walked across
the surface of the sun.
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast,
they could hardly be said
to have occurred at all.
But you, Adrian, you're just a man.
The world's smartest man poses
no more threat to me
than does its smartest termite.
What's that?
Another ultimate weapon?
Yes.
You could say that.
...came under attack.
Millions of lives were suddenly ended
in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr Manhattan himself.
Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact
with the premier of the USSR.
Putting aside our past differences,
we have both pledged to unite
against this common enemy.
With the rest of the world,
we will prevail.
This is a day we shall never forget.
And yet we go fon/vard
to defend the human race
and all that is good and just
in our world.
Thank you.
God bless us all.
Do you see?
Two superpowers retreating from war.
I've saved the Earth from hell.
We both have.
This is as much your victory
as it is mine.
The Soviet ambassador's meeting
in Washington...
Now we can return,
do what we were meant to.
We were meant to exactjustice.
Everyone's gonna know
what you've done.
Will they?
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.
Peace based on a lie.
But peace nonetheless.
He's right.
Exposing Adrian would only doom
the world to nuclear destruction again.
No. We can't do this.
On Mars,
you taught me the value of life.
If we hope to preserve it here,
we must remain silent.
Keep your own secrets.
Don't even think about it.
Rorschach!
Wait.
Never compromise.
Not even in the face of Armageddon.
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.
I've made myself feel every death,
see every innocent face I've murdered
to save humanity.
You understand, don't you?
Without condoning
or condemning,
I understand.
Out of my way. People have to be told.
You know I can't let you do that.
Suddenly you've discovered humanity?
How convenient!
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.
I can change almost anything,
but I can't change human nature.
Of course you must protect
Veidt's new utopia.
What's one more body
amongst the foundations?
Well, what are you waiting for?
Do it.
Do it!
No!
I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.
I thought you said
you cared about life again.
I do.
I think maybe I'll create some.
Goodbye, Laurie.
Come on!
Come on!
Dan, a world united and at peace.
There had to be sacrifice.
No! You have an idealised mankind,
but you've deformed it.
You've mutilated it.
That's your legacy.
That's the real practical joke.
We repeat, there is nothing wrong
with your television set.
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery
which reaches from the inner mind
to The Outer Limits.
Sure you don't want a drink?
I'm okay.
Cheers.
Look, there's something I need
to get off my chest.
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.
Laurel.
What you must think of me.
I'm sorry I never told you.
I should have,
but, I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
- I felt stupid.
-lt doesn't matter.
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things and,
well, sometimes they can't talk
about them.
I know how that is.
But I just want you to know that
you never did anything wrong by me.
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.
Because he gave me you.
Thanks, Mom.
I love you.
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Sally. Please.
Excuse me. I've got to go freshen up.
I'll be right back.
- S0 how's it going up here?
- Good.
- How's it going down there?
- Good.
I think I've got everything working.
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now
so all we've got to do is take her out.
Well, that sounds like a date.
Are we going to be all right?
Long as people think Jon's still
watching us, we'll be all right
in the end.
I know what Jon would say,
"Nothing ends."
Nothing ever ends.
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about any more.
Everyone in the country,
every country in the world,
they're holding hands now,
singing songs about peace and love.
It's like living
in a goddamn global hippie commune.
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's going
to be running for President in '88.
We could run a piece on that.
Seymour, we don't dignify
absurdities with coverage.
This is still America, damn it!
Who wants a cowboy
in the White House?
Okay.
I could look for something
in the crank file.
Crank file.
Whatever. Take some initiative.
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.
Rorschach's journal, October 12, 1985.
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
