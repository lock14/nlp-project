00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,086
<i>They're shooting people!</i>

3
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,849
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

4
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,355
<i>I'm calling from Ridgeline High.</i>

5
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,289
<i>Stay calm.</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

6
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,587
<i>My name is Rebecca.</i>

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,719
<i>Okay, Rebecca,</i>
<i>are you injured?</i>

8
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,232
<i>No. No. But there are</i>
<i>a lot of people who aren't moving.</i>

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,097
<i>Are you in any danger?</i>
<i>Can you see the shooter...</i>

10
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,241
<i>I drive myself crazy with the...</i>

11
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,376
<i>with the what-ifs</i>
<i>and the shoulda-beens.</i>

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,024
<i>No, no, uh...</i>

13
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,528
<i>I look and I look, but...</i>

14
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,894
<i>there's nothin' I regret, there's nothin'</i>
<i>I would have done different.</i>

15
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,602
<i>You ever shoot anybody?</i>

16
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,637
<i>No.</i>

17
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,449
<i>You never seen anybody shot?</i>

18
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,379
<i>Yeah.</i>

19
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,425
<i>I'm here with Janet Huttensen,</i>

20
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,291
<i>the mother of Robbie Huttensen,</i>

21
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,354
<i>one of the two Ridgeline High School</i>
<i>shooters.</i>

22
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,732
<i>Obviously this has been</i>
<i>an incredibly hard couple of years for you.</i>

23
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:48,240
<i>On this, the three-year anniversary</i>
<i>of the Ridgeline shooting...</i>

24
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:52,745
<i>how could a parent not know</i>
<i>that their child is thinking of...</i>

25
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,110
<i>Well, it's...</i>
<i>it's not that simple.</i>

26
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:59,675
<i>- There was nothing unusual?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

27
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,982
<i>How could this happen?</i>

28
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,024
<i>- Something around the house?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

29
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,025
<i>- In his room?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

30
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,687
<i>We're just trying to understand.</i>

31
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:14,028
<i>Well, you're trying to</i>
<i>understand something that I can't explain.</i>

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,568
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>you want me to say.</i>

33
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,565
<i>Where were they shot?</i>

34
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,173
<i>In the chest.</i>

35
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:34,783
- And in the face.
- And in the face? Oh.

36
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,919
Pretty nasty, huh?

37
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,897
<i>You have another son, David.</i>

38
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,965
<i>David is now currently in high school.</i>

39
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,979
<i>He is now the same age</i>
<i>as Robet was when...</i>

40
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,743
<i>I'm sorry, I don't see the question.</i>

41
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,751
<i>Are you scared?</i>

42
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,652
Scared? No.
Why would I...

43
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,993
This thing... in your hand.

44
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,930
It doesn't make people
stop bothering you...

45
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,864
it doesn't make things go away.

46
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,668
It does <i>that.</i> What you saw.

47
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,742
<i>Do you ever think</i>
<i>about the children who</i>

48
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,212
<i>- lost their lives that day?</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

49
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,682
<i>I cared about those kids.</i>
<i>They were... for God's sake.</i>

50
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,050
<i>I mean, a lot of 'em,</i>
<i>I'd seen 'em, you know...</i>

51
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,520
<i>- You'd watched them grow up.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

52
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,898
Don't you ever bring one of these...

53
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,729
into my school again.

54
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,677
<i>So when am I gonna get my check?</i>

55
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,547
Let me see.

56
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:19,050
Excuse me, Pansy? She wants to
know when she's gonna get her check.

57
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,854
We'll make sure to
get you the rest of it.

58
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,990
Thank you.

59
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,198
Hey, kiddo. Get up.

60
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,966
Go to bed.

61
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,115
- Finish your homework?
- Hmm.

62
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:22,244
I'll get you up in the morning.
You can finish it then.

63
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,482
Okay.

64
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,419
- And brush your teeth.
- Okay.

65
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,330
It was one of those skirts with
a high slit up the side.

66
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,897
- Was it cute?
- Hell, no. She looked like a slut.

67
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,239
- You think everyone looks like a slut.
- She did!

68
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,404
- Where'd she get it?
- Her mom's closet.

69
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,711
Ooh, feisty this morning.
Fuckin' genius.

70
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,844
No, actually she got at the Gap,
and she cut it herself.

71
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,855
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey! Hey!

72
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,615
What's the matter with you?

73
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,524
Wait. Why can't I have
my bottle of water?

74
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,223
- I don't make the rules, okay?
- It's a clear plastic bottle.

75
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,993
It's obvious that there's
water inside of there.

76
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,398
- It's really a bottle of water.
- I don't make the rules.

77
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,664
- Yeah, but the plastic is clear...
- I don't make the rules!

78
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,400
- Get out of here! Go learn something!
- I'm just trying to have a discussion.

79
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,272
What's so threatening
about a bottle of water?

80
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,308
- Hey, Frank.
- License and registration?

81
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,583
I'm Shelley's husband. She plays bridge
with your sister all the time.

82
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,123
I know who you are, Earl.
I'm just doing my job.

83
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,284
License and registration.

84
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,522
Okay.

85
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,255
Hey, Frank.

86
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,768
Can't we... why don't you...

87
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:46,430
- Can you give me a warning or something?
- You got a permit for that?

88
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,939
What's that?

89
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,032
That gun.
You got a permit for it?

90
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,634
- Uh, yeah.
- Good.

91
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,443
Listen, do me a favor...
don't keep it up here, okay?

92
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,883
If anybody pulls you over,
you tell 'em it's in the trunk.

93
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,921
I suppose you're gonna
give me a ticket for that, too.

94
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,452
You were doing seventy miles per hour
up the hill.

95
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,191
- What do you expect me to do?
- I don't know...

96
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,257
Earl. What do you
expect me to do?

97
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,064
You take care now.

98
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,669
There's a lot of things
you guys could do, Rachel.

99
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,398
Depends on how much
you want to do.

100
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,701
I can open up a parking lot for you.

101
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,174
You want some car wash,
you want a bake sale...

102
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,904
whatever you want.
You guys are doing gr...

103
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,741
Okay, hold on! Hold on!

104
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,249
I'm gonna have to go.
I'll talk to you later, okay?

105
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,413
My disciplining him is very different
from you disciplining him.

106
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,456
How many times
do I gotta tell you?!

107
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,048
Enough! What the hell
is the matter with you?

108
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,958
Hey, Reggie? What you doing
talking to our kids like that?

109
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,461
- Mr. Carter, they hear that all day!
- I don't care what they hear.

110
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,896
You want me to come in here
and talk to 'em like they're second-graders?

111
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,025
- That's not gonna work!
- Reggie.

112
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,501
You will not talk to these kids like that.

113
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:32,104
- Where have you been?
- I subbed in Reggie's class.

114
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,875
They were giving speeches for...
whatever the heck today is.

115
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,974
- What's going on over here?
- Two fights, smoking,

116
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,918
and that one decided to
bring in a handgun today.

117
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,857
Sara called three hours ago.

118
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,590
She wanted you to remember to get
Hakeem a new backpack today.

119
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:56,465
She said the plastic bag he had
been using ripped again.

120
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,370
Don't we have a backpack
in Lost & Found?

121
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,431
Carter, no. You cannot give
your son some old...

122
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:07,104
- This has been here over a year, right?
- That is a girl's bag.

123
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,976
There's no such thing
as a girl's backpack.

124
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,347
It's got little pink flowers
all over it.

125
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,716
Yeah... it does.

126
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,880
You know, when I was a kid,

127
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,857
my family couldn't afford
to buy me new clothes.

128
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,689
I'd have to wear my sister's.

129
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,855
I'd go to school wearing a blouse.
That's just the way it was.

130
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,762
He'll be fine.

131
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,094
Okay.

132
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,279
- Keep your eyes up.
- Sorry.

133
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,053
Here we go.

134
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,160
Can I move yet?

135
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,718
Uh, yeah. I'm done.

136
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,129
- Okay, you ready for this?
- Yeah, let's see it.

137
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,429
- You ready?
- Yes! Let me see it.

138
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,372
Ewww! Oh, my God! That is...

139
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,603
Do you like it?

140
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,040
Come on! That's terrible!

141
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,206
What?

142
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,341
It's really bad.
Look at my forehead!

143
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,850
Well, look at your forehead.

144
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,012
Oh, my God!

145
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:26,184
Look at my chest. That's obnoxious.
When did I get a boob job?

146
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,725
And what's with the cowboy thing?

147
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,727
Okay, that is the last time I draw you.

148
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,990
It's not the last time,
it's not even the first time.

149
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,532
- That's not me.
- Okay, whatever.

150
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,259
- I'm going to class.
- Shit, what time is it?

151
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,433
- Like noon.
- Gotta go to my crappy job.

152
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,941
If you hate your job so much,

153
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,171
why don't you just quit
and get something on campus?

154
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,509
It's not that I hate it,
it's just that it's...

155
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,912
I don't know, it's like everything else.

156
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,472
Why did I move
halfway across the country

157
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,211
so my parents pay for college?

158
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,310
Because everyone in my family
goes to the University of Virginia.

159
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,446
No exceptions.

160
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,456
Why do I work in
my grandfather's shop?

161
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,788
Because everyone in my family
works in my grandfather's shop.

162
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,260
No exceptions. Right.

163
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,321
My mom thinks that's a normal job
for a college student to have.

164
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,563
Around here everyone just ends up
doing what their family does anyway.

165
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,230
Well, I hope no one in your family
is an artist.

166
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,603
Ha ha! I was just kidding.

167
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,757
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- Yeah?

168
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,658
And it's just the same as his.
Sure it's not your eyes?

169
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,220
- Heya.
- Hey.

170
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,037
God.

171
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,233
I don't know what
he could have done with this.

172
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,971
- Some people switch the scope out.
- That could have been it.

173
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,014
Or loosened the trigger.

174
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,880
Anyway, I took the liberty of
ordering you a new scope.

175
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,148
- You ordered a scope?
- Yeah. If you like it, fine.

176
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,351
If you don't like it, I'm sure I'll be able
to sell it to somebody else

177
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,450
or it'll just come out of
my own pocket.

178
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:12,463
Maryanne? There's a scope box
out there on the cabinet

179
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,431
with Mr. Stewart's name on it.

180
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,491
Would you bring it in to me, please?

181
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,629
Carl, that's not... your granddaughter?

182
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,299
- Yeah.
- She's out here now?

183
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:26,674
God, I haven't seen her in,
wow... not since...

184
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,214
- She was knee high to a grasshopper?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:33,240
Yeah, she's been here, oh,
nigh-on three months now.

186
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,083
- She's Lindy's daughter?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,816
Yeah.

188
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,595
She's not making the best of things
out here.

189
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,290
Well, it's a big change, you know.

190
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,425
You can't blame yourself
if she doesn't like it.

191
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,734
Well, she sure doesn't like it.
She drags herself in here like...

192
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,469
I don't think she's got
the personality to make friends.

193
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,068
That's the problem.
That's a big problem.

194
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,445
Now that she's back at UVA
she should do okay.

195
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,212
They'll loosen her up.
What do you think?

196
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,082
Maryanne, you find it okay?

197
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,289
Open it up, please.

198
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:50,384
- What's up, Playboy?
- How ya doin'?

199
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,430
You just might be psychic, man,
not even know it.

200
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,863
- I'm serious.
- You dumb.

201
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,457
I read it in some magazine.

202
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,523
Dude did a study,

203
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,594
and like 87% of people can tell when
people are starin' at 'em from behind.

204
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,105
People just know.

205
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,107
So what you sayin', people just know
that they psychic?

206
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,938
Our brain does stuff
we can't even understand.

207
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,978
They can't even explain
how much knowledge...

208
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,640
Hey, yo, Jay, read my mind, dawg,
what am I thinkin' right now?

209
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,943
Go on!

210
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,507
I'm thinkin' that
you read too damn much, man!

211
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,680
Hey, yo, Jay! You feel me lookin'
at you, right, dawg?

212
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,313
You feel me lookin' at you, right?

213
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,120
Yeah, man, I feel you lookin' at me.

214
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,004
Hey, Connie, wait up!

215
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,713
Hey, hold it. I got you.

216
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,176
A'ight.

217
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,888
- A'ight, man.
- A'ight.

218
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,290
- Where you goin'?
- Home.

219
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,025
Take that with you.
Don't just leave it out here.

220
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,566
I ain't takin' that home.

221
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,194
- I don't want it in front of my place.
- You think I want it in front of mine?

222
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,261
- Put it in the lot.
- Unh-unh.

223
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,636
- Why not?
- You gotta push me in the morning.

224
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,732
Like I'm gonna stick it in the lot
so some bum can steal it.

225
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,074
Like no one's gonna steal it out here?
Just put the cart in the damn lot.

226
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,512
- Man, <i>you</i> put the cart in the lot!
- You put it in the lot.

227
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,311
I'm gonna tell yo mama
to put it in the lot!

228
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,908
I'm gonna tell your auntie you said
to put the cart in the lot.

229
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,112
- I'm just tellin' you it's truthful.
- What?

230
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,384
- Country music records are ill.
- You're high, man.

231
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,687
No, I'm tellin' you,
if you break it down, man...

232
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,920
This is worse than in fifth grade

233
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,895
when you were whispering
Bobby Brown lyrics to girls.

234
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,195
I'm tellin' you, they just melt
over country music lyrics, man,

235
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,792
they just as good as any R & B lyrics,
except for they new

236
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,269
and they fresh,
you know what I'm sayin'?

237
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,771
Even if they <i>old.</i>

238
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,670
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

239
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,471
That's... sad.

240
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,341
Honestly, that's real sad, man.

241
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,541
- Take Johnny Cash, for example.
- Johnny Cash?

242
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,349
No, no, just stop. Don't tell me nothin'
about no Elvis Presley.

243
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,412
Why do you think
they called him The King?

244
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,683
Who called him The King?

245
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,692
The cat was like 350 pounds
with bell-bottoms.

246
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,489
What kinda king you know
wear bell-bottoms?

247
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,052
You're just close-minded.

248
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,698
It's gettin' late.

249
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,902
Yeah.

250
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,131
Got a book this thick to read.

251
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,867
I got algebra, man, but all the answers
is in the back of the book,

252
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,467
so I'm good.

253
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,239
A'ight, man.

254
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,617
You should really
try to learn that shit, man.

255
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,562
It's your eyes.

256
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,665
- My what?
- Your eyes.

257
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,798
I like 'em.

258
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:54,910
- What color are they?
- Ohh... why you gotta do that?

259
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,744
- I know you don't know.
- I know.

260
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,340
I know.

261
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,681
Hazel.

262
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,664
<i>He's not talking to me.</i>

263
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,938
- Same shit?
- It's never the same.

264
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,502
Yeah, well, what is it this time?

265
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,076
He doesn't like Barry.

266
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,946
That loser spend the night
last night?

267
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,322
Yeah.

268
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,724
And you're wondering why
David's not talking to you.

269
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:19,252
Listen, he left at four.

270
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,823
I don't know, what,
does he want me to...

271
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:26,337
does he want me to be... celibate?

272
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,466
David is sixteen years old.
He doesn't care what the hell you are.

273
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,000
- You can't have other guys...
Hey, Lou!

274
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,138
You can't smoke here!

275
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,080
- It ain't lit.
- I don't care.

276
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,347
I thought you were
wearing the patch.

277
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,794
- Does that thing work?
- Well, no.

278
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,796
But you put a couple
across your chest,

279
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,094
a few on your ass,
and you're good to go.

280
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,272
You workin' a double tonight?

281
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,573
Depends on who doesn't show.

282
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,976
What?

283
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,081
Depends on who doesn't show.

284
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,235
<i>It happened suddenly.</i>

285
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,476
<i>When I raised my head</i>
<i>and opened my eyes</i>

286
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,243
<i>I couldn't recognize anyone.</i>

287
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,185
<i>I don't think that I can ever forget</i>
<i>the parents and the police</i>

288
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,917
<i>going from body to body</i>
<i>in the parking lot of the school.</i>

289
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,392
<i>It was three years ago today</i>
<i>in Ellisburgh, Oregon,</i>

290
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,622
<i>that Robbie Huttensen</i>
<i>and Donnie McDaniel</i>

291
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,790
<i>opened fire on</i>
<i>the students and teachers</i>

292
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,355
<i>of Ridgeline High School.</i>

293
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,402
<i>Tonight we're going to</i>
<i>take a closer look</i>

294
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,494
<i>at the stories behind the headlines,</i>

295
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,971
<i>and the families affected</i>
<i>by this tragedy</i>

296
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,531
<i>are going to talk about it</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

297
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,168
<i>I cared about those kids.</i>

298
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,236
<i>They were... for God's sake...</i>

299
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,409
<i>How does a parent not know</i>
<i>that their child is ready to do...</i>

300
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,917
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

301
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:58,423
<i>No, I drive myself crazy with the...</i>
<i>you know, the what-ifs</i>

302
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,424
<i>and the shoulda-beens.</i>

303
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,357
<i>Anything around the house?</i>

304
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,190
<i>No.</i>

305
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,924
<i>In his room?</i>

306
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,297
<i>No. No. Uh...</i>

307
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,964
<i>I look and I look, but...</i>
<i>there's nothing I regret,</i>

308
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,405
<i>there's nothing I would have</i>
<i>done different.</i>

309
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,309
Mmm.

310
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,938
He asleep?

311
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,280
No, but he's laying there.

312
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,775
<i>... on this,</i>

313
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,584
<i>the three-year anniversary</i>
<i>of the Ridgeline shooting.</i>

314
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,683
<i>- You have another son.</i>
- Why don't we watch something else?

315
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,251
<i>- David.</i>
- Just give me a minute, okay?

316
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:41,129
<i>He is now about the same age</i>
<i>Robet was when...</i>

317
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,099
<i>I'm sorry, I don't see the question.</i>

318
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,102
<i>Are you scared?</i>

319
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,230
<i>Scared? No. Why would I...</i>

320
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:53,267
<i>Did the kids ever come to your house?</i>
<i>Spend time with Robbie?</i>

321
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,944
<i>You're asking me if any of</i>
<i>the dead kids ever came around?</i>

322
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,782
<i>- The "dead kids"?</i>
<i>- I don't mean it like that. but I...</i>

323
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:09,221
<i>I mean, you're asking me if</i>
<i>in seventeen years of sleep-overs...</i>

324
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:13,128
<i>What about the summer of 1996 when</i>
<i>the police were called to your house,</i>

325
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,063
<i>just three months before?</i>

326
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>- It was a disturbance of the peace call.</i>
<i>- Yeah, I didn't...</i>

327
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,335
<i>- Just three months before.</i>
<i>- The neighbors made that call.</i>

328
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,102
<i>- Janet, did your husband beat you?</i>
<i>- Beat me? No.</i>

329
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,076
<i>Was he physical with Robet and David?</i>

330
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,671
<i>Physical? What? No.</i>
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

331
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,682
<i>We just want to understand.</i>

332
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:37,586
<i>You want to understand something</i>
<i>that I... can't explain.</i>

333
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,454
<i>When Newsline returns,</i>
<i>more with Janet Huttensen,</i>

334
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,493
<i>mother of a Ridgeline school shooter.</i>

335
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,361
<i>But first, could these officers have saved</i>
<i>the children of Ridgeline?</i>

336
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,195
<i>Why didn't they act?</i>
<i>What went wrong?</i>

337
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,863
<i>Do you think more could have</i>
<i>been done than was?</i>

338
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:02,073
<i>Well... yeah. I think those</i>
<i>officers could have done a lot more...</i>

339
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,411
<i>than they did right then.</i>

340
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,678
<i>I think they could have done</i>
<i>a lot more.</i>

341
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,380
Yeah. Okay, I understand that,

342
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,185
but who should I be talking to, then?

343
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:17,126
This is the TV station, is it not?
Is this not the TV station?

344
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,891
I don't get enough mail here
that I would miss a consent form.

345
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,024
You put me on TV, all right?

346
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,536
This is not... I live here,
I live in this town, do you understand that?

347
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,333
Well, darn it, who am I
supposed to talk to, then?

348
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,306
The first person said
I should talk to you,

349
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,274
now you're telling me
I should be talking to somebody else.

350
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,435
Just give me a name.

351
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,412
Well, that would be good.
I'd appreciate that. Thank you.

352
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,748
My fucking job!
That's what I was doing!

353
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,311
I <i>am</i> the other side of the story.
How dare you question...

354
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,684
What?

355
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,158
<i>When I came there...</i>
<i>when I was there,</i>

356
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,923
<i>they held me back at the gates.</i>

357
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,659
<i>They held me back there</i>
<i>while the kids...</i>

358
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,191
<i>there are children in there</i>
<i>that are hit.</i>

359
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,205
<i>The kids are in there getting killed,</i>
<i>they're getting slaughtered!</i>

360
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,539
<i>Some died instantly.</i>
<i>Your son bled to death.</i>

361
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,343
<i>Do you ever think about that officer</i>
<i>that was first on the scene?</i>

362
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,821
<i>Yeah, I think about him.</i>

363
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,628
I'm goin' to work.

364
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,069
It ain't workin'.

365
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,507
- What's not workin'?
- The pump.

366
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,479
Pull around. I'll put it in
the other side.

367
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,516
Can't you just come out and check it?

368
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,851
Pull around. I'll put it on two.

369
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,679
I ain't got no gas in the car.

370
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,387
- You want your money back?
- I ain't asked for my money back,

371
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,125
I just want you to... I'll push it,
then you just put it in neutral.

372
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,224
I can't leave the booth.
I gotta stay here.

373
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,881
Hmm.

374
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,613
I'm sorry, dude.

375
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,672
Shift change, man.

376
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,218
Hey, wipe the drool off, man.

377
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,725
See? I told you.

378
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,925
Jimmy! Hakeem!

379
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,402
You boys get away from here!

380
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,632
Hakeem! Come on through,
little man.

381
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,466
How you doin', little man?

382
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,946
How many of you are here because of
the fight in 201? Raise your hand.

383
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,819
I want you all to sign this sheet,
go to your last class,

384
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,725
I'll call you in tomorrow
individually.

385
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,032
Tasha, what are you still doing here?

386
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,295
You can't just sit here.
You gotta go to class.

387
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,462
You gotta go to class.

388
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,563
Sit down, buddy.

389
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,600
"Notorious B.I.G."?

390
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,408
I want you to go in my office.
Go wait in my office.

391
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,143
You think that's funny?

392
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,984
All right.

393
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,494
Okay. Go to class.

394
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,594
Okay, so, I think Paco's
gonna have a party tonight.

395
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,599
- Paco?
- He's cool.

396
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,431
I'm kind of over the whole
backwoods party thing.

397
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,994
- I'm gonna study.
- Oh, you mean call Brian?

398
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,869
I mean exactly what I say.

399
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,153
Hey, buddy.

400
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,587
Buddy.

401
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,749
It's time to get up.

402
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,793
It's time to go.

403
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,920
- You ready?
- Yeah.

404
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,088
Okay.

405
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,670
- There aren't any more greens?
- Nope.

406
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,408
- I thought we bought four cans.
- I did.

407
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,609
What happened to the greens?
'Cause I wanted to have some.

408
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,482
How'd the day go?
Parent conferences?

409
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,652
A couple.

410
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,453
Reggie quit.

411
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,929
- Couple of days ago.
- Of course he did.

412
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,263
You talked to your son today?
On the way home?

413
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,858
Why?

414
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,564
A body was found
in the school parking lot today.

415
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,970
Know who found it?

416
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,600
- Jimmy Frank.
- Who's Jimmy Frank?

417
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,143
Your son's best friend!

418
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:17,272
David, how do you walk
a mile and a half with your son,

419
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,942
take the train, and don't even
talk to the boy?

420
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,918
- It's not a mile and a half.
- I don't care.

421
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,453
It's twelve blocks,
and then the train.

422
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,149
I don't want to argue. I'm just
telling you, it's not a mile and a half.

423
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,523
Your son saw a half-naked hooker
with her stomach cut out,

424
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,994
with the knife still sticking in her!

425
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:39,527
I'm 37 years old, and I've never,
ever seen anything like that. Never.

426
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,473
You wouldn't let him go
to your mother's funeral,

427
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,567
- today he sees a dead prostitute.
- What do you want me to do?

428
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,238
What do I want you to do?
I want you to talk to your son.

429
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:54,013
You spend more time talking to the parents
of those thieves and gun-toting...

430
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,349
- That's my job.
- No, it's <i>not</i> your job!

431
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,857
- Look, I got 2,000 kids...
- They're not your responsibility!

432
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,519
At the end of the day there's one
little boy that's your responsibility,

433
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,428
and that little boy
just saw a dead prostitute, Carter.

434
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,590
That's not normal!

435
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,066
I can't just leave in the middle of my day
and go out and do something...

436
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,865
- You're out of your mind!
- What do you want from me?

437
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:17,669
You want me to tell all the hookers
to stop tricking on Adams?

438
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,733
Do you want me to go out there
with a shotgun and say,

439
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,870
"Stop! You know what,
my son is coming out here.

440
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,777
- You guys gotta go inside."
- I want you to talk to your son!

441
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,543
- I don't have a vice principal,
- Just talk to him!

442
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,778
I don't have a counselor,
I got nobody!

443
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,946
These parents, they come in
and went to put their foot up my ass,

444
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,321
always got some complaint...
this one doesn't get on the football team,

445
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,452
this teacher's giving him
sex positions or something like that...

446
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,792
- You're not even listening to me!
- I cannot remember the last time

447
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,230
one of 'em just said, "Thank you."

448
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,412
And I'm not listening to you?

449
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,904
Hello?

450
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:28,505
I'm sorry I called, I didn't know
what else to do. She's in the back.

451
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,208
- What did she drink?
- Nothing! I don't know!

452
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,643
- Open up!
- I already tried that.

453
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,587
- Who's she in there with?
- I don't know, I wasn't watching her.

454
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,648
Some guys, I think. I saw the door open
and it was like ten men!

455
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,957
- Hey, Cicily?
- I don't know what to do!

456
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,361
Find somebody who knows
how to open this door.

457
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,161
Please? Find somebody now!

458
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,996
Open up!

459
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:56,336
Open this fucking door right now!

460
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,433
What could you possibly want
so right-fucking-now?!

461
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,208
You fucking bitch! Stop kicking!

462
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,484
Get him off her! You asshole!

463
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,578
Get off!

464
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:15,183
Oh, my God! Cicily!
Come here. It's okay.

465
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,751
Stop it.

466
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,447
Cicily? Here.
Wake up, okay?

467
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,448
I just need you to wake up
for one minute, okay?

468
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,177
I just want to make sure
you're not hurt.

469
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,652
Hey, Cicily! I just want to make sure
I don't have to take you to the hospital.

470
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,713
Stop it. Hey, hey, hey... stop it.

471
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,453
Wait one second.
Let me see if you're okay.

472
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,757
Where are you bleeding at?

473
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,098
Are you hurt?

474
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,965
Come on. Come on.

475
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,006
Come on. Are you okay?

476
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,565
Are you okay?

477
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,709
All right.

478
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,612
It's okay.

479
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,489
Hey.

480
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,753
Hi, honey.

481
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,887
No, I don't want to worry you.
I was just askin'.

482
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:04,331
Well, you know,
she comes in here all hang-dog,

483
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,336
her head hangin' down.

484
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,706
Yeah. She doesn't call me Papa
anymore.

485
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,143
I'm Grandpa now,
it's my new official title.

486
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,039
I did okay with you, didn't I?

487
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,282
Yeah.

488
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:28,485
I know. I was wondering if maybe
she thinks she has to work here

489
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,687
'cause you did and Ronnie did,
and...

490
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,524
Yeah.

491
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,998
I know, I'm doin' it right now.

492
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:44,941
Well, okay. Let me know if she
calls you Mother instead of Mom, okay?

493
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,861
Hi.

494
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,934
You... you okay?

495
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,010
Yeah.

496
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,477
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

497
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,757
Well, what about our money?

498
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,232
Miss Huttensen, it's almost
halfway through the session.

499
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,963
We discussed that
if anything were to happen

500
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,301
- But what has happened?
- we would terminate the semester.

501
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,043
We can't have the media
at the gates of our school.

502
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,011
- You said you saw <i>a</i> camera.
- Miss Huttensen...

503
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,481
- No, <i>a</i> camera is not the news media.
- Okay, hold on.

504
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,916
No. No, no, no, I won't.

505
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,454
Because I only want my son
to get an education,

506
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,820
that's what I paid for,
that's what I brought him here for.

507
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,018
I'm just trying to help you.

508
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,288
I have lost my job.

509
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,125
I have lost <i>two</i> jobs.

510
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,392
We are broke.

511
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,991
So if you want to kick
my only son out of school

512
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,401
and keep the money,
you know, that's just...

513
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,631
that's <i>great.</i>

514
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,439
Mom?

515
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,347
Hey, what are you doing home?

516
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,417
- No. No.
- David...

517
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,086
So where am <i>I</i> supposed to go?

518
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,689
No.

519
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,928
No, you're crazy. Shit!

520
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,699
Believe me,
I don't want you to go there either.

521
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,297
No way I'm going to Ridgeline!

522
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,208
Wh-why do you think that...
why do you think that I want...

523
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,076
You have to go to school, it's the law.
That's the district...

524
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,513
What do you expect to happen?!

525
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:21,021
I don't want to go, Mom,
I really don't want to go...

526
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,728
Davey, I don't want you to go.

527
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,396
It's because of that interview, though.
Why would you do that interview?

528
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,530
How do you expect me to
make enough money

529
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,098
- for you to go St. Anthony's?
- Get a better friggin' job!

530
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,440
- Get a better job. Great.
- If you gave a crap about me,

531
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,640
you would make sure,
and you would do <i>anything</i>

532
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,741
to make sure that I didn't go to
that school... that's what you would do.

533
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,811
- For two years, double shifts, okay?
- Why can't we move?

534
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,982
- Move?
- Why can't we get out of here?!

535
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,458
Let's go right now.
Why can't we get out of here?

536
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,621
There's not enough hours in a day
for me to make enough money

537
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,962
- for us to just move!
- So what am I supposed to do?!

538
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,465
Fuck!

539
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:07,109
- Good morning, guys.
- Hey. How ya doin'?

540
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,406
I'm all right.

541
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,949
- Are Schmidt and Pallus in yet?
- I don't think so. Not yet, no.

542
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,282
- Huh. They're usually in by now.
- Yeah, they usually are.

543
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,322
Listen, Frank, I saw...

544
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:23,383
I saw that thing on TV.
I am so sorry, man. I tried calling you.

545
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:27,090
It's all right.
Don't worry about it, Donnie.

546
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,189
We're cool.

547
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,461
I just want you to know
you still got a job here.

548
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,025
Well, yeah.
Shit, I should hope so.

549
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,164
I mean, I, uh,
I don't want you to worry about your job.

550
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,505
Just 'cause some TV station
puts on a show that says that...

551
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,506
That thing, that scenario,
that's not the way it was. You know that.

552
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,606
Yeah.

553
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,175
That in no way resembles
what actually went down.

554
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,984
The city wants you to do a show.

555
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,354
The what?

556
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:58,384
Uh, Mayor Dougherty
and some of the council members,

557
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,487
they got a call from
one of those TV news shows.

558
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,997
So they want <i>me</i> to go on TV and..?

559
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,967
It's not somethin' you gotta do.

560
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,298
I figure since you, uh,
called the TV station yourself...

561
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,274
Oh, man.

562
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,868
- Look...
- They called the city the next morning.

563
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,378
That's how this whole thing
got started.

564
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,642
Fuck.

565
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:22,015
I just couldn't believe that they,
you know...

566
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,077
I want you to talk to the psychologist.

567
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,249
Wait a minute, boss,
hold on a second.

568
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:30,225
Look, there's a tremendous
amount of pressure in this job,

569
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,491
- and especially what you been through...
- Wait a minute.

570
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,589
It's been three years since the shooting.

571
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,999
Two years pass
and Curry stuck that shotgun in his...

572
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,798
- I am not Curry.
- I know you're not Curry,

573
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,702
- but Curry didn't have TV news shows...
- I am not Curry.

574
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,365
Frank.

575
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,376
So what you're saying is,

576
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,038
you don't ever think about the children
at the school?

577
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,910
- No.
- Not at all?

578
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,674
Uh... um...

579
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,719
There's a lot to worry about.
I have a job to do.

580
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,276
Mm-hm.

581
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:01,552
I just... you know, I try not to
let things set.

582
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,685
There's nothing I can do
about a past crime.

583
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,526
I know, and that's...
that's very healthy, Frank.

584
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:11,432
But what I'm talking about are
your basic normal human emotions...

585
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,437
regret, remorse.

586
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,565
I mean, I just want to be clear here
that you don't ever find yourself

587
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,439
in the situation that...

588
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,878
What? Why are you...
What's so funny?

589
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,348
Nothing, it's just, um...

590
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,352
I don't know, it's just I just feel like...

591
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,980
like that woman on the TV show,
you know, the mother.

592
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,616
Like you're interviewing me
or something. I just feel stupid.

593
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:39,561
Oh, you saw the news show
about you and the shootings.

594
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,257
No, I mean, I saw a little...

595
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,860
'Cause they named <i>you.</i>
And they showed pictures.

596
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,996
- And maps.
- Yeah. I know.

597
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,634
And how you weren't able to save...

598
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,678
those kids.

599
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,974
Mm-hm. I heard.

600
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,016
And that doesn't bother you?

601
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:07,081
Why would I be bothered by something
that's a complete fabrication of reality?

602
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,473
Hey, Tasha.

603
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,140
You're gonna go to
all your classes today, right?

604
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,305
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

605
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,415
Hey.

606
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,753
You stay right there.

607
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,823
Let's go.

608
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,296
- Let's go.
- Wait...

609
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,354
Out of the way.
Out of the way!

610
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,458
What are you thinking?

611
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,026
You weren't thinking at all, were you?!

612
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,230
Let's go.

613
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,467
Why you gonna
bring a gun into my school?

614
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,510
- It's not mine.
- It's not?

615
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,169
Nope.

616
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,941
What do you think you're playing?
You think this is a game?

617
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,313
You're expelled, Jelani.

618
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,750
- You can't expel me for this.
- You're expelled.

619
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,412
You're out of my school.
I don't want to see you.

620
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,582
You act like I was bringing a gun
into school, trying to shoot people.

621
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,058
Shootings happen in the parking lot
just the same as they happen in here.

622
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,652
- There's no bullets in there!
- You're expelled.

623
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,130
You can call your parents
on the phone in the main office.

624
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,600
You can't expel me for...
I'm one of the best students you got.

625
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,330
No. You're not.

626
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,065
You tell 'em to pick you up
by the front gate.

627
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,869
- I don't want you by the steps.
- My parents don't pick me up, man.

628
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,536
- I walk to school by myself.
- Then you can walk home by yourself.

629
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,738
Every day I come here early
for a class I don't even have to take.

630
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,407
You know where I have to
walk in the morning and at night?

631
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,542
You know what? We're done.

632
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,485
You know how many kids been shot
walking to this school? <i>Your</i> school?

633
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:21,388
From home I walk down 75th,
cross over to Halstead,

634
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,394
hop a fence on 70th to...
So yeah, I carry a gun.

635
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,589
- You're expelled, Jelani.
- Come on, man.

636
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,860
What's wrong with you?
You're not even listening to me, are you?

637
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,561
I'm sorry.

638
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,231
Okay.

639
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,436
Okay, J.

640
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,690
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

641
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,118
What kind of a question is that, man?

642
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,823
It's a good question, I think.

643
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,466
I want to be principal of a high school.

644
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,561
Well...

645
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,606
you know, that's a tough job.

646
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,198
You don't want to have a wife
and a kid with a job like that.

647
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,642
You don't have any time,
none at all,

648
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,373
'cause most of the time
you're spending your time

649
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,711
talking to knuckleheads
and hoodlums.

650
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,945
You have no time
to talk to your wife and kid.

651
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,687
I came here from Ohio.

652
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,520
What's in Ohio, man?

653
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,926
Schools without kids carrying guns.

654
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,724
Yeah, right.

655
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,756
Oh, so you're here to save
our streets, right? Be some kinda hero?

656
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:42,363
My wife, she had a great job,
and my son, he was just born.

657
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,602
I had opportunity to make a difference.

658
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,769
Less pay, longer hours.

659
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:51,246
But there was a couple of thousand
dum-dums that needed some help,

660
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,681
so I thought I'd give it a try.

661
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,014
Well, test scores are up.

662
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,648
- You read the paper?
- I read that part.

663
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,319
- And you brought this gun to my school.
- Yeah, but I leave it outside.

664
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,521
- If you're doing a bad job, I'd...
- You'd bring it inside?

665
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,997
- Exactly. But I don't...
- Because of the metal detectors?

666
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,966
That's right.

667
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,264
Smart move gettin' those installed.

668
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,435
I didn't do that.

669
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,341
Guy before me did that.
Right before he left.

670
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,741
Can't take credit for that.

671
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,913
So why you still here?

672
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,782
Last year thirty-one kids went to college.
Yeah before that it was twenty-six.

673
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:35,086
Four years ago Shannon Cordero
couldn't read or write,

674
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,185
now she's tutoring in
freshman literature.

675
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,854
Latron Barnes couldn't even
write his name...

676
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,397
How many guns
you got in your drawer?

677
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,093
I got two more guns
than I had last month in my drawer.

678
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:48,935
And one of those guns is from a kid who,
judging from his grades...

679
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,998
and a long conversation,

680
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,906
could do a heck of a lot more
with his life

681
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,070
than most of the fools around him.

682
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,142
Can I have it back?

683
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,611
It's for my job.

684
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:07,123
It's for your job. What do you do?
What do you do, J? Are you a cop?

685
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,818
I work at a place
where I need it to protect...

686
00:47:08,823 --> 00:47:12,725
If you have to have a gun
to work where you work

687
00:47:12,794 --> 00:47:15,456
or to be where you are...

688
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:18,055
then maybe you need to try your best
not to be there.

689
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:28,397
What are you doing?

690
00:47:29,811 --> 00:47:31,005
What?

691
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:35,015
- Don't touch his bed.
- Why? He's not gonna use it.

692
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,880
I have it like this for a reason.

693
00:47:37,952 --> 00:47:40,386
David, what are you doing?

694
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:43,549
- What are you doing?!
- I'm pushing the beds together.

695
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:46,253
- Are you going to sleep in his bed?
- I'm pushing 'em together!

696
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:48,454
You're going to sleep
in your brother's bed?!

697
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,122
This is <i>my</i> room!

698
00:47:50,198 --> 00:47:52,291
David! No! No!

699
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:56,804
You can't just come in here
and start moving it around!

700
00:47:56,871 --> 00:48:00,068
Get off me!
Get off of me now!

701
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:02,336
- Get off me, Mom!
- Stop it!

702
00:48:05,413 --> 00:48:08,610
You know something?
You have a lot of nerve!

703
00:48:08,683 --> 00:48:10,048
- I have?
- Yes!

704
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:14,316
I'm in here trying to move
my stuff around! My stuff!

705
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:17,620
- Spoiled! That's what you are!
- Fuck you!

706
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:20,627
Oh. "Fuck." "Fuck." That's great.
That's just great.

707
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:22,162
Shut up!!!

708
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,891
Okay, fine.

709
00:48:26,901 --> 00:48:30,530
Why do you smoke?! David? Huh?

710
00:48:30,605 --> 00:48:33,972
- Why do you go through my things?
- Why do you smoke?

711
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:37,534
Why do you fuck Barry
in Dad's bed?!

712
00:48:45,854 --> 00:48:49,415
- I am just trying to do my best.
- Would you move, please?

713
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,481
Can you move?!

714
00:48:52,861 --> 00:48:56,058
You don't even...
you don't even care.

715
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,897
You don't...

716
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:08,232
Hey.

717
00:50:08,303 --> 00:50:09,770
What's up?

718
00:50:10,772 --> 00:50:12,364
Your parents home?

719
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,601
My mom's taking a bath
or washing her hair.

720
00:50:14,676 --> 00:50:18,373
- Washing her fat rolls?
- Fuck you, man.

721
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:21,438
- Dude, you still smoking lights?
- Yeah. Why?

722
00:50:21,516 --> 00:50:23,916
- You're a bitch, dude.
- What?

723
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:26,783
You think you can just
put your cigarettes all over my house

724
00:50:26,854 --> 00:50:28,913
like my mom's not gonna
fucking care?

725
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,255
- How'd she find 'em?
- She finds everything, you dick.

726
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:36,730
- Fuck. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, thanks. That helps a lot.

727
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:39,232
Ike.
- Hey.

728
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,767
What's up, hunk?

729
00:50:42,203 --> 00:50:45,900
Uh, Tally, Mouse,
you know my friend David?

730
00:50:45,974 --> 00:50:50,411
- Hey, "my friend David."
- Hey, yeah, we met before.

731
00:50:56,284 --> 00:50:58,718
- You want anything to drink?
- Yes.

732
00:50:58,786 --> 00:51:01,516
- That's cool.
- Thank you.

733
00:51:04,392 --> 00:51:05,916
Follow me.

734
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,925
All right.

735
00:51:13,134 --> 00:51:15,227
No...

736
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:18,405
I don't know.

737
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:25,846
Well, I came into the room,

738
00:51:25,913 --> 00:51:28,848
and he was moving...

739
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:32,282
...Robbie's bed.

740
00:51:33,521 --> 00:51:36,285
Have you guys known each other
for a long time or whatever?

741
00:51:36,357 --> 00:51:38,689
Yeah, actually, I've known her
since grade school.

742
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,923
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

743
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:44,658
You go to St. Anthony's?

744
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:47,625
Used to.

745
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:52,905
Hey, was your brother
the one who... um...

746
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:55,873
Yeah.

747
00:51:56,878 --> 00:52:02,282
I love David. I <i>care...</i>
more than anything.

748
00:52:04,385 --> 00:52:05,750
Hold on.

749
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:08,051
Ohh.

750
00:52:14,462 --> 00:52:17,192
- What happened to your stomach?
- Oh, uh...

751
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:21,732
It was this thing I was doin'
on my bike.

752
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:23,532
There's a park over there,

753
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:25,572
and there's these steps
I always ride down,

754
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,700
and I kinda ate it. Hard.

755
00:52:28,776 --> 00:52:31,836
Got me this new alarm clock.
Oh, my God, it's so annoying,

756
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:34,905
it's like... bramp! bramp!

757
00:52:38,686 --> 00:52:42,520
So, um... we should
hang out sometime.

758
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:46,185
I mean, if... I don't know
if you want to, but if you do...

759
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,852
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

760
00:52:47,929 --> 00:52:50,056
Yeah, I... yeah, that'd be cool.

761
00:52:50,131 --> 00:52:52,224
Can I have your number
or something?

762
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,861
- Yeah. Uh, I don't have a pen.
- I have a pen.

763
00:52:55,937 --> 00:52:58,838
I'm thinking I want to transfer
and to go Ridgeline with you.

764
00:52:58,906 --> 00:53:00,032
Ohh, dude.

765
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:02,838
The girls are so much hotter.
I mean, you said it yourself.

766
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,935
Tally, Mouse.

767
00:53:05,012 --> 00:53:07,378
Yeah, but there's hot girls
in St. Anthony's.

768
00:53:07,448 --> 00:53:08,881
- Not at all.
- Yeah, there is.

769
00:54:35,736 --> 00:54:38,068
Okay,
let's roll on my cue.

770
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:39,834
And... roll tape.

771
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:42,307
Ed, whenever you're ready.

772
00:54:43,544 --> 00:54:46,377
I know it's been three years
since the tragedy,

773
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:50,144
but could you still give us a timeline of
what happened after you arrived?

774
00:54:50,218 --> 00:54:53,278
Yeah, sure. Um...

775
00:54:53,354 --> 00:54:56,653
I got the call at 11:38 in the morning,

776
00:54:56,724 --> 00:55:00,854
and, um, I was alone in my squad car,

777
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:03,158
I was near Ridgeline.

778
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:06,758
Shots had been heard,
so I went over there and, um...

779
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:09,894
as you said,
by the time I got there

780
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:14,067
the first two kids had already been shot
by Donald and Robert when I arrived.

781
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:17,167
I notice you make an effort
to call them by their names.

782
00:55:17,245 --> 00:55:20,510
They've been called the "shooters,"
the "killers"...

783
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:23,812
The killers, yeah.

784
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:26,717
I just always remembered
that they're kids.

785
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:29,517
Do you still think about it?

786
00:55:44,038 --> 00:55:46,472
You have a...
you have a good day today?

787
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:50,272
It was a bad day?

788
00:55:53,848 --> 00:55:57,249
- Learn anything new today?
- Same stuff.

789
00:55:57,318 --> 00:55:59,878
What, you didn't learn anything new
all day?

790
00:56:00,955 --> 00:56:02,445
I guess.

791
00:56:08,863 --> 00:56:10,922
You got something
you want to share with me?

792
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:14,662
You can talk to me.
You know you can talk to me, right?

793
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,297
Hmm...

794
00:56:21,942 --> 00:56:23,842
Let me hold this bag
for a second.

795
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:28,043
'Cause, uh...
hold that for a second...

796
00:56:28,115 --> 00:56:31,414
'cause I need to put some color
in my wardrobe.

797
00:56:31,485 --> 00:56:33,112
How's it look?

798
00:56:34,588 --> 00:56:37,421
- It's okay?
- It's a little bit better.

799
00:56:37,491 --> 00:56:40,983
All right? Come on, let's go.
Let's go. You ready?

800
00:56:52,573 --> 00:56:54,871
Gotta do your homework, buddy.

801
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:06,279
Hey. You guys are home early.

802
00:57:06,354 --> 00:57:08,618
We were just watching cartoons.

803
00:57:08,689 --> 00:57:10,020
Oh.

804
00:57:13,194 --> 00:57:14,684
You talk to him at all?

805
00:57:14,762 --> 00:57:17,629
Yeah, I tried to talk to him.
He didn't have much to say, though.

806
00:57:17,698 --> 00:57:20,132
- No?
- I tried to talk to him about school,

807
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:22,601
- I tried to talk to him about Jeremy...
- Jimmy.

808
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,299
Yeah, that's what I said. I said Jimmy
when I was talking to him about it.

809
00:57:26,374 --> 00:57:28,239
He knew who I was talking about.

810
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:32,268
You can't get him to open up to you
by breaking my rules.

811
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:34,906
What rules did I break?
We were just having some dinner.

812
00:57:34,982 --> 00:57:37,644
- The cartoons, Carter.
- Cartoons?

813
00:57:37,718 --> 00:57:40,448
Yeah. No cartoons during the week.
You know that.

814
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:43,422
Come on, babe. I mean, my son...

815
00:57:43,491 --> 00:57:46,619
my kid, he likes cartoons,
I love cartoons...

816
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:50,027
I mean, it's my fault,
'cause I wanted to watch that show,

817
00:57:50,097 --> 00:57:52,361
that really good show,
the Dragonball show.

818
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:55,129
- Dragonball Z.
- The guy with the funny hair and...

819
00:57:55,202 --> 00:57:56,464
Yeah.

820
00:57:56,537 --> 00:57:58,437
That's my favorite.

821
00:57:58,506 --> 00:58:02,135
You know...

822
00:58:10,718 --> 00:58:13,448
I'm sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

823
00:58:14,688 --> 00:58:17,555
Hey, you're gonna
have to cut the TV off.

824
00:58:32,773 --> 00:58:36,231
That fool took away your gun?
Damn!

825
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,471
- I'm a'ight.
- You're a'ight?

826
00:58:38,546 --> 00:58:40,878
So what, you think
you're Superman now?

827
00:58:40,948 --> 00:58:43,746
All them bullets just gonna be
bouncin' off your chest?

828
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:45,342
I don't know, man, I'm...

829
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:46,943
I'm cool.

830
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:50,957
- I'll just get you another piece, man.
- Nah.

831
00:58:51,025 --> 00:58:52,959
I don't want one.

832
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:56,421
So you're just gonna
walk around here naked.

833
00:58:56,497 --> 00:58:58,692
I'm good. I'm light on my feet.

834
00:58:58,766 --> 00:59:02,031
Look, I'm gonna find me a girl...

835
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:05,265
I'm gonna sing some Johnny Cash to her,
some J. Cash.

836
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:07,864
You know, Johnny Cash
carried a gun.

837
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:09,432
Yeah, a'ight.

838
00:59:14,215 --> 00:59:16,513
There you are. Clean as a whistle.

839
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:19,382
You know,
it's a question of safety.

840
00:59:19,453 --> 00:59:22,320
Mm-hm.
- Look here, see...

841
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:27,019
this is the stock,
and... it's a little shorter

842
00:59:27,094 --> 00:59:28,994
and just a little thinner.

843
00:59:29,063 --> 00:59:31,588
Yeah, I don't know if I like how...

844
00:59:31,665 --> 00:59:34,327
Maryanne, would you
come here for a second?

845
00:59:36,704 --> 00:59:38,695
It's my granddaughter.

846
00:59:39,907 --> 00:59:42,034
Can you put your hand there, please?

847
00:59:42,109 --> 00:59:44,475
Okay, just relax it.

848
00:59:44,545 --> 00:59:46,877
There.

849
00:59:46,947 --> 00:59:49,507
Okay. See?

850
00:59:50,718 --> 00:59:54,017
Mm-hm. I see our hands
are about the same size,

851
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:56,613
I just, uh, I don't know if I like how...

852
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,851
This is made to fit snug.

853
00:59:58,926 --> 01:00:02,157
This one, the one you've been using,

854
01:00:02,229 --> 01:00:06,791
because it's thicker,
if you were to try and pull it up quickly,

855
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:10,234
you could lose you grip
and it could slip away.

856
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:12,534
You could find yourself
in some trouble.

857
01:00:12,606 --> 01:00:16,667
I've gotten used to it, though.
I think I like the weight.

858
01:00:16,744 --> 01:00:18,871
Well, it's heavy, that's for sure.

859
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:22,979
- You don't find it too heavy?
- Not so much. It's all right.

860
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,449
All right, there you are.

861
01:00:24,518 --> 01:00:26,918
Honey, can you take this back
to the cash register

862
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:28,921
and ring up that other stuff?

863
01:00:28,989 --> 01:00:31,457
Thanks an awful lot.
I'm gonna keep this aside for you

864
01:00:31,525 --> 01:00:34,153
because, trust me,
it's the best thing for you.

865
01:01:11,765 --> 01:01:13,596
That's his brother.

866
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:18,433
Can I help you?

867
01:01:18,505 --> 01:01:20,700
Um... yeah.

868
01:01:20,774 --> 01:01:23,470
I actually called earlier.

869
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:29,814
I just thought maybe I could
learn a little bit about shooting or...

870
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:33,250
Okay. Have you ever
handled a firearm before?

871
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,450
Yeah. But I haven't shot a gun
since I was a really little kid.

872
01:01:37,524 --> 01:01:41,927
Well, we can start from
the beginning and... and go from there.

873
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:47,099
This is a 9-millimeter
semi-automatic handgun.

874
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:50,568
When it's in your hand,
you are smart, you're careful,

875
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:52,697
and you're always responsible.

876
01:01:52,773 --> 01:01:54,900
All right. So, now with your feet,

877
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:57,170
you want to spread your feet
apart a little bit,

878
01:01:57,244 --> 01:01:59,508
get one foot in front of the other
like I am.

879
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,947
Your knees are able to bend
so that you're relaxed

880
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:04,951
- but you're strong.
- Okay.

881
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:07,214
Does that feel comfortable?
It's the Weaver stance.

882
01:02:07,287 --> 01:02:08,948
It's probably the most
comfortable for you.

883
01:02:17,564 --> 01:02:19,088
Again.

884
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:20,599
- Uh, I don't...
- Do it again!

885
01:02:25,472 --> 01:02:26,996
Good.

886
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:30,576
So why you got
all the nerdy classes?

887
01:02:30,644 --> 01:02:34,637
I just got transferred over like that.
I'm gotta get 'em switched.

888
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:37,980
- I got this weird lunch period now.
- It's 'cause you have pre-calc.

889
01:02:38,052 --> 01:02:41,544
Pre-calc?
I've been in algebra <i>forever.</i>

890
01:02:41,622 --> 01:02:44,182
Yeah, it was just
'cause in my old school,

891
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:47,625
- I mean...
- You want a ride home?

892
01:02:47,695 --> 01:02:50,994
You know, my... my mom's picking me up.

893
01:02:51,065 --> 01:02:53,329
You want me to wait with you?

894
01:02:54,535 --> 01:02:55,797
Yeah.

895
01:03:15,756 --> 01:03:19,089
- And the other room's upstairs?
- Mm-hmm.

896
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:22,526
Yeah, you're looking at...
well, twelve hundred.

897
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:27,961
Is there any way you could
knock that down just a little bit?

898
01:03:28,035 --> 01:03:29,900
'Cause it's...

899
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,130
Well...

900
01:03:31,205 --> 01:03:34,504
Where's... where's the school?

901
01:03:36,343 --> 01:03:39,608
The school's down a ways...
a few miles.

902
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,375
Go out and head east.

903
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:44,841
Thanks. That's great.

904
01:03:44,918 --> 01:03:47,079
Your boy play football?

905
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:50,214
Westland's got one of
the best teams in the state.

906
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:54,818
Good academics, too.

907
01:04:01,268 --> 01:04:02,633
So, was it weird today?

908
01:04:04,571 --> 01:04:08,007
What, like... going here?

909
01:04:09,009 --> 01:04:10,442
It's whatever.

910
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:12,979
The classes seem like
they'll be easier.

911
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:14,809
Yeah.

912
01:04:24,825 --> 01:04:27,487
You ever think about your brother?

913
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,221
No. Not really.

914
01:04:34,434 --> 01:04:36,265
He was a fuckin' idiot anyway.

915
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,199
Can you give me a tattoo?

916
01:04:44,278 --> 01:04:45,575
Down here.

917
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:47,672
Yeah.

918
01:04:54,154 --> 01:04:56,054
So...

919
01:04:57,724 --> 01:05:00,784
...how many guys have you
kissed in your lifetime? Ever.

920
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:03,658
Ever?

921
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,721
Um...

922
01:05:06,733 --> 01:05:08,325
Three.

923
01:05:08,402 --> 01:05:10,836
But only one, like, real one.

924
01:05:10,904 --> 01:05:14,396
You're such a liar. You...
you've only kissed one guy?

925
01:05:14,474 --> 01:05:16,704
Yeah. One guy.

926
01:05:18,345 --> 01:05:20,711
How many girls have <i>you</i> kissed?

927
01:05:51,612 --> 01:05:53,136
I like it.

928
01:06:06,627 --> 01:06:07,685
Are you all right?

929
01:06:10,631 --> 01:06:13,065
Thanks for staying with me.

930
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:20,999
Uh-oh, I think that's my mom.

931
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:22,974
Uh...

932
01:06:25,512 --> 01:06:27,343
Do you want to come meet her?

933
01:06:39,726 --> 01:06:42,217
- Are they still warm?
- Yeah.

934
01:06:42,296 --> 01:06:44,662
'Cause they were hot
when I bought 'em.

935
01:06:44,731 --> 01:06:46,426
Thanks.

936
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:50,468
So, I went looking
for some places.

937
01:06:52,306 --> 01:06:54,866
What, like apartments or something?

938
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:00,037
- What the hell is this?
- Mom, what's goin' on?

939
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:05,717
What the?

940
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:14,154
Hey, David,
I want you to go inside.

941
01:07:14,227 --> 01:07:16,627
- Why?
- Honey, just go inside.

942
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:20,532
Hey. Hey!

943
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,965
I can't believe this.

944
01:07:22,035 --> 01:07:25,266
- Mom.
- David, just go inside the house!

945
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:26,806
Go on!

946
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:31,633
Excuse me.
What the hell is this?

947
01:07:31,712 --> 01:07:34,647
Why the hell would you
put this on my lawn?

948
01:07:34,715 --> 01:07:36,182
Huh?

949
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:38,080
What is your problem with me?

950
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:40,244
You! I live here!
This is my house!

951
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:44,086
Where do you get off...
Why would you leave this for me?!

952
01:07:44,157 --> 01:07:46,455
You deserve whatever you get,
Janet.

953
01:07:46,526 --> 01:07:49,154
- Oh, I can't believe...
- Don't complain to them.

954
01:07:49,229 --> 01:07:51,561
How can you...
This is so unreal.

955
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:54,930
- Go inside the house.
- How dare you talk to me like that?!

956
01:07:55,002 --> 01:07:58,938
- Calm down and go inside.
- Oh, Bob? You have nothing to say to me.

957
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:02,772
Your kid stands out here
and sells weed like it's lemonade.

958
01:08:02,843 --> 01:08:04,777
- Not my kid.
- Oh, yes. Yes. Yes.

959
01:08:04,845 --> 01:08:07,780
- Don't act like you don't know.
- Your son's a murderer.

960
01:08:07,848 --> 01:08:09,816
- Oh, my son...
- Yeah. What do you have to say to that?

961
01:08:09,883 --> 01:08:11,817
- You know what?
- Your son's a murderer.

962
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:13,853
People just stand out here
talking about...

963
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,253
If you have a problem with
people putting flags in your yard,

964
01:08:17,324 --> 01:08:19,690
I mean, do you realize
what these flags represent?

965
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,352
I don't have a problem
with flags in my yard...

966
01:08:21,428 --> 01:08:23,020
These flags represent the children,

967
01:08:23,096 --> 01:08:26,122
the children that were murdered
by your son!

968
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:29,362
So why do you have
a red flag in <i>your</i> yard?

969
01:08:29,436 --> 01:08:31,631
- Because I care, Janet.
- Oh, you care?

970
01:08:31,705 --> 01:08:33,332
I have a problem with
coming home in my car

971
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,841
- with my other son David...
- You are such a slut!

972
01:08:35,909 --> 01:08:39,970
I'm a slut? Oh, excuse me.
And who are you?

973
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:42,743
I hope you're not the woman
whose husband has come over

974
01:08:42,816 --> 01:08:46,115
like four times and offered
to mow my lawn!

975
01:08:46,186 --> 01:08:48,711
Because it looks like crap.
We feel sorry for you!

976
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:53,783
- Don't feel sorry for me.
- Why don't you move?!

977
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,556
Because I live here!

978
01:08:59,633 --> 01:09:01,567
You're the reason
those kids were killed!

979
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:03,125
- I'm <i>not</i> the reason!
- Yes, you are!

980
01:09:03,203 --> 01:09:05,569
I didn't kill your kids, okay?
But I baby-sat them!

981
01:09:05,639 --> 01:09:09,541
How the hell could you not see it?!

982
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:10,974
Your own kid!

983
01:09:11,044 --> 01:09:14,343
Look, <i>my</i> son is dead!

984
01:09:14,414 --> 01:09:17,076
Hey, you! Stop!

985
01:09:18,285 --> 01:09:21,686
I'm fine. It's okay, I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.

986
01:09:21,755 --> 01:09:25,418
- Why don't you just go inside?
- I'm going inside.

987
01:09:25,492 --> 01:09:30,759
- Mom! Please, come on.
- Why don't you make <i>them</i> go inside?!

988
01:09:35,702 --> 01:09:37,465
Go! What did I say?!

989
01:09:38,472 --> 01:09:39,803
Hey, Don.

990
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:43,608
Everyone's back in their houses now

991
01:09:43,677 --> 01:09:45,736
except the guy down there
watering his lawn.

992
01:09:45,812 --> 01:09:47,404
Yeah, he's all right.

993
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:49,972
Jimmy just rolled up
with another car.

994
01:09:52,018 --> 01:09:54,282
Why don't the two of you
get on out of here, okay?

995
01:09:54,354 --> 01:09:56,219
The chief wants me to stick around
and make sure that...

996
01:09:56,289 --> 01:09:58,223
No, I got this covered.

997
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:01,488
You go home to your family,
all right?

998
01:10:01,561 --> 01:10:04,530
- You sure?
- Yeah. Go on.

999
01:10:04,598 --> 01:10:08,625
- All right. Thanks, Frank.
- Okay. I'll see ya, Don.

1000
01:10:10,437 --> 01:10:12,166
'Night, Jimmy.

1001
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:22,974
<i>You want coffee</i>
<i>or tea or something?</i>

1002
01:10:23,049 --> 01:10:25,074
No, ma'am, I'm fine, thank you.

1003
01:10:29,823 --> 01:10:32,587
I didn't even know you guys
were still here.

1004
01:10:54,915 --> 01:10:57,543
If you guys are here to...

1005
01:10:57,617 --> 01:11:00,677
There's nothing wrong
with my other son David.

1006
01:11:00,754 --> 01:11:03,416
No, ma'am, I know.
I was just...

1007
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:07,586
There's nothing in this house
that you... would interest you anymore.

1008
01:11:07,661 --> 01:11:09,094
- Okay?
- I know.

1009
01:11:09,162 --> 01:11:11,187
I'm his mother. I would know.

1010
01:11:12,566 --> 01:11:15,694
Yes, ma'am.
Uh... thank you.

1011
01:11:17,637 --> 01:11:19,901
I, um...

1012
01:11:24,244 --> 01:11:26,178
I understand.

1013
01:11:26,246 --> 01:11:30,444
I mean, you'd think I don't understand,
but I get it, David gets it.

1014
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,852
It makes sense,
with the flags and the banners and...

1015
01:11:37,924 --> 01:11:40,256
people are...

1016
01:11:51,838 --> 01:11:53,772
I feel bad.

1017
01:11:54,941 --> 01:12:00,140
Maybe you could let... someone know
I said that.

1018
01:12:23,637 --> 01:12:27,664
Yo, what's up, man. Lemme get
that Old Highlander right there.

1019
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:29,868
How much is it?

1020
01:12:29,943 --> 01:12:32,707
- It's twenty-one.
- Twenty-one?

1021
01:12:32,779 --> 01:12:36,044
How about that little rum
right there? How much is that?

1022
01:12:36,116 --> 01:12:38,346
Um... seventeen.

1023
01:12:38,418 --> 01:12:39,680
Seventeen?!

1024
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:41,584
How 'bout the Wild Turkey?

1025
01:12:43,623 --> 01:12:46,023
- That's fifteen.
- Fifteen?! Man, fuck that!

1026
01:12:48,461 --> 01:12:49,860
Hey!

1027
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:51,294
Hey!!!

1028
01:12:51,364 --> 01:12:53,628
Gimme the Wild Turkey!

1029
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,636
Look, I'm... I'm'a chill, right?
I'm'a put this away.

1030
01:12:57,704 --> 01:13:00,138
Gimme the motherfuckin' Wild Turkey.

1031
01:13:01,308 --> 01:13:03,173
Gimme the Wild Turkey!!!

1032
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:06,076
Nigga, I see you!
Gimme the Wild Turkey!

1033
01:13:06,146 --> 01:13:08,910
Hey, man, get your ass up, man!

1034
01:13:08,982 --> 01:13:10,643
Get your ass up!

1035
01:13:14,387 --> 01:13:17,618
Your ass got to come out.
Ima be here waitin'.

1036
01:14:43,576 --> 01:14:45,976
<i>Are you concerned at all?</i>

1037
01:14:46,045 --> 01:14:47,569
I'm concerned about
all kinds of things, Sara.

1038
01:14:47,647 --> 01:14:49,410
<i>About our family? Our home?</i>

1039
01:14:49,482 --> 01:14:51,712
<i>I mean, we're not happy</i>
<i>as a family.</i>

1040
01:14:51,785 --> 01:14:54,049
<i>I'm not happy, Hakeem's not happy.</i>
<i>And I know...</i>

1041
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,088
Sara, I have to go.

1042
01:14:56,156 --> 01:14:59,182
- There's some stuff going on outside.
<i>- Cater, you</i> always <i>have to go.</i>

1043
01:14:59,259 --> 01:15:01,386
<i>When you were a teacher,</i>
<i>before we moved,</i>

1044
01:15:01,461 --> 01:15:03,759
<i>- you talked to the kids, you...</i>
- Sara, come on.

1045
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:07,061
This is my job. It's my job.

1046
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:09,966
Don't make this like it's not
important to me,

1047
01:15:10,036 --> 01:15:11,936
- 'cause you know it's important to me.
<i>- I love you.</i>

1048
01:15:12,005 --> 01:15:13,939
<i>- And I know you.</i>

1049
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:16,635
<i>Can't you just hear what I'm saying?</i>
<i>Can't you?</i>

1050
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:19,337
This is what I do.

1051
01:15:19,412 --> 01:15:21,209
This is what I do.

1052
01:15:24,117 --> 01:15:26,642
Hey, hey!

1053
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:31,721
You want to hurt him that bad?

1054
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:33,985
Huh?!

1055
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,392
- Carter.
- Do you even go to this school?

1056
01:15:38,865 --> 01:15:40,696
Do you go to this school?

1057
01:15:56,816 --> 01:15:58,147
Hey, Carter.

1058
01:15:58,218 --> 01:16:00,083
We're backed up out there.

1059
01:16:00,153 --> 01:16:02,519
I got Lisa Ann from yesterday,

1060
01:16:02,589 --> 01:16:06,491
- Kwami's back.
- You know...

1061
01:16:06,559 --> 01:16:10,689
this stain has been on my ceiling...

1062
01:16:10,763 --> 01:16:12,788
for such a long time.

1063
01:16:12,866 --> 01:16:17,064
Well, you can just
switch out the panels and...

1064
01:16:17,136 --> 01:16:21,300
I have switched 'em.
I switched 'em nine times.

1065
01:16:21,374 --> 01:16:23,740
It comes back.

1066
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:28,406
So I switch it again, 'cause that's what
the guy before me told me I should do.

1067
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:31,450
That's probably what I'm gonna
tell the next guy, too.

1068
01:16:33,486 --> 01:16:35,317
I don't know why...

1069
01:16:37,323 --> 01:16:41,919
I don't know why...
if it's just laziness or...

1070
01:16:41,995 --> 01:16:44,122
or stupidity or...

1071
01:16:44,197 --> 01:16:47,894
I just keep, like,
hitting my head against the...

1072
01:16:47,967 --> 01:16:51,528
I just keep changing the...
the panels.

1073
01:16:54,073 --> 01:16:56,541
Carter, what did you mean
by "the next guy"?

1074
01:16:59,779 --> 01:17:01,747
How many kids you say
we got out there?

1075
01:17:01,814 --> 01:17:03,873
Five.

1076
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,747
Can you just give me
a couple of seconds,

1077
01:17:05,818 --> 01:17:09,754
- then send somebody in?
- Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

1078
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,024
Hello?

1079
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:25,537
Hi. Um... this is David.

1080
01:17:32,211 --> 01:17:34,304
I was just calling
'cause I was wondering if

1081
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,974
maybe you wanted to hang out tonight.

1082
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:39,416
<i>- Yeah, um, I...</i>
- Yeah?

1083
01:17:39,485 --> 01:17:42,477
<i>I would love to.</i>
<i>Do you want to come over?</i>

1084
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:45,547
Or I could go to your house
or something?

1085
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:47,718
Yeah, you could come over here.
That sounds fine.

1086
01:17:47,794 --> 01:17:51,730
<i>Yeah, that would be totally fine.</i>
<i>I'll go grab my bike.</i>

1087
01:17:51,798 --> 01:17:52,958
Okay.

1088
01:17:53,032 --> 01:17:55,830
My address is on Hawthorne.

1089
01:17:55,902 --> 01:18:00,032
It's at the end of the block,
last street on the right. It's 236.

1090
01:18:00,106 --> 01:18:03,075
All right, I guess I'll be there
in like ten minutes.

1091
01:18:03,142 --> 01:18:04,507
<i>- Okay?</i>
- Okay.

1092
01:18:04,577 --> 01:18:07,375
<i>- I'm gonna run by the store first.</i>
- Then I'll see you soon.

1093
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:08,937
All right. Bye.

1094
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:10,346
Bye.

1095
01:18:11,818 --> 01:18:13,547
Get your notebook too, babe.

1096
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:18,614
Mr. Carter?

1097
01:18:19,626 --> 01:18:20,684
Yeah?

1098
01:18:22,261 --> 01:18:25,355
We, um... well, I...

1099
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:28,594
I just wanted to say, um...

1100
01:18:32,538 --> 01:18:35,598
Thank you for talking to my son.

1101
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:37,370
You, um...

1102
01:18:37,443 --> 01:18:40,469
you truly, I believe,
saved his life.

1103
01:18:40,546 --> 01:18:45,142
My other son went to this school
before you got here, and, um...

1104
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,753
...well, it was different.

1105
01:18:49,822 --> 01:18:51,449
Thanks.

1106
01:18:53,993 --> 01:18:55,984
Thank you for that.

1107
01:19:18,918 --> 01:19:21,182
Do you have to work tonight?

1108
01:19:21,254 --> 01:19:23,484
Oh, my God.

1109
01:19:25,258 --> 01:19:26,691
What?

1110
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:40,333
- Did you get stitches?
- No.

1111
01:19:40,406 --> 01:19:42,306
No, it's...

1112
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:44,809
- You didn't go to the hospital?
- No.

1113
01:19:56,322 --> 01:19:59,485
- Is Louise coming over?
- Umm.

1114
01:20:04,464 --> 01:20:06,022
Barry?

1115
01:20:08,601 --> 01:20:10,831
Barry doesn't come over anymore.

1116
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:22,743
You hungry?

1117
01:20:25,051 --> 01:20:26,678
Hmm?

1118
01:20:26,753 --> 01:20:28,618
No.

1119
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:42,030
- You should stay home tomorrow.
- What?

1120
01:20:42,101 --> 01:20:44,865
You should stay home.

1121
01:20:49,308 --> 01:20:50,969
Sit down.

1122
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,104
You tired?

1123
01:21:27,947 --> 01:21:29,278
Yeah.

1124
01:21:31,851 --> 01:21:33,284
Hmm.

1125
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:47,761
Me, too.

1126
01:22:11,991 --> 01:22:14,152
- You gettin' out of here?
- Yeah.

1127
01:22:14,227 --> 01:22:16,320
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

1128
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:18,488
Finding your way around here okay?

1129
01:22:23,102 --> 01:22:26,469
You mean, like...
here in the store, or...

1130
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:31,442
No, here in Charlottesville,
and in the shop too, it's just...

1131
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:35,344
you know, you seem so down
every time you come in here.

1132
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:40,044
You don't smile,
you... hardly talk,

1133
01:22:40,119 --> 01:22:42,485
you never even really say good-bye.

1134
01:22:42,555 --> 01:22:44,614
I say bye.

1135
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:48,148
Yeah, okay, I was just askin'.

1136
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:50,354
And I smile, too.

1137
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:51,919
Yeah.

1138
01:22:51,998 --> 01:22:55,229
You know, it's just...

1139
01:22:55,301 --> 01:22:59,237
it's like... it's kinda like
you used to talk more

1140
01:22:59,305 --> 01:23:01,239
when you came to visit.

1141
01:23:01,307 --> 01:23:04,037
I mean, you were younger, but...

1142
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:08,274
It's just, things are...

1143
01:23:08,347 --> 01:23:10,212
different around here.

1144
01:23:10,283 --> 01:23:13,081
I mean, some of it's college different,

1145
01:23:13,152 --> 01:23:19,091
and some of it's just... Southern or...
East Coast or whatever.

1146
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:21,752
Virginia different.

1147
01:23:23,062 --> 01:23:25,326
I don't know, Papa.

1148
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:32,935
It's just that some shit happened, and...

1149
01:23:33,005 --> 01:23:36,236
and I just feel like...

1150
01:23:38,911 --> 01:23:41,778
...edgy or whatever lately,

1151
01:23:41,847 --> 01:23:45,408
and I don't... I know that
doesn't explain how I've been

1152
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:48,351
for the past two months, but...

1153
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:55,186
You know, this place was always
kinda weird for me to walk into.

1154
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:03,831
But I guess around here it's...

1155
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,638
...it's just how everybody is.
I don't know.

1156
01:24:12,411 --> 01:24:14,140
Boy...

1157
01:24:14,213 --> 01:24:17,671
I miss your grandmother
so much sometimes.

1158
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,947
I sure wish she was alive right now.

1159
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,353
Yeah... me, too.

1160
01:24:24,423 --> 01:24:29,224
I mean, maybe you'd talk to her
when you used to come visit,

1161
01:24:29,295 --> 01:24:31,286
maybe not to me at all.

1162
01:24:31,364 --> 01:24:34,800
It was nice you callin' me Papa,
anyway.

1163
01:24:36,635 --> 01:24:38,626
Did your mother tell you
to call me Papa?

1164
01:24:38,704 --> 01:24:41,298
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

1165
01:24:41,374 --> 01:24:42,739
Yeah, but...

1166
01:24:44,243 --> 01:24:46,211
Aw, shit.

1167
01:25:17,576 --> 01:25:18,565
Hi.

1168
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:30,688
Do you have strawberry soda?

1169
01:25:32,091 --> 01:25:34,025
Oh, I see it. Thanks.

1170
01:25:37,663 --> 01:25:39,995
- Hi.
- Uh, pack of lights.

1171
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,796
That's four seventy-nine.

1172
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:28,235
Hey.

1173
01:26:28,314 --> 01:26:29,941
Just take it easy, man.

1174
01:26:30,015 --> 01:26:31,073
No, no. No.

1175
01:27:05,584 --> 01:27:08,109
Get down!
On your stomach!

1176
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:11,213
Get down!
Stop moving!

1177
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:14,088
- Stop moving!
- Just let me get my arm out, man.

1178
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:16,788
- Ow! Ow!
- Hey! Shut up.

1179
01:27:36,649 --> 01:27:38,139
Mom, I'm home.

1180
01:27:48,561 --> 01:27:50,028
Time to go to bed, man, okay?

1181
01:28:59,265 --> 01:29:01,597
Oh, hey.

1182
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:03,658
Hey.

1183
01:29:03,736 --> 01:29:06,933
What's going on?
What'd you buy?

1184
01:29:12,344 --> 01:29:14,437
I got a backpack.

1185
01:29:16,515 --> 01:29:18,779
Thank you, Carter.

1186
01:29:20,085 --> 01:29:21,552
I quit today.

1187
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,212
You what?

1188
01:29:23,289 --> 01:29:26,258
I'm done, at the end of the semester.

1189
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:28,589
They're, um, looking...

1190
01:29:28,661 --> 01:29:30,629
they're looking...

1191
01:29:30,696 --> 01:29:33,290
They're gonna find a replacement.

1192
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,566
Oh, baby.

1193
01:29:45,744 --> 01:29:48,235
Need some help?

1194
01:33:00,405 --> 01:33:02,600
<i>911, please state your emergency.</i>

1195
01:33:02,674 --> 01:33:05,700
<i>These guys,</i>
<i>they're shooting people!</i>

1196
01:33:05,777 --> 01:33:07,142
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

1197
01:33:07,212 --> 01:33:09,077
<i>Ridgeline...</i>
<i>Ridgeline High!</i>

1198
01:33:09,147 --> 01:33:11,115
<i>Stay calm.</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

1199
01:33:11,183 --> 01:33:12,548
<i>My name is Rebecca.</i>

1200
01:33:12,618 --> 01:33:14,449
<i>Okay, Rebecca,</i>
<i>are you injured?</i>

1201
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,956
<i>No, but there are a lot</i>
<i>of people who aren't moving.</i>

1202
01:33:18,023 --> 01:33:20,184
<i>Are you in any danger?</i>
<i>Can you see the shooter?</i>

1203
01:33:20,259 --> 01:33:23,888
<i>Not right now,</i>
<i>but they're in the building.</i>

1204
01:33:23,962 --> 01:33:26,590
<i>Okay, Rebecca,</i>
<i>stay on the line with me, okay?</i>

1205
01:33:28,834 --> 01:33:32,167
<i>Rebecca?</i>
<i>Are you okay? Are you injured?</i>

1206
01:33:34,806 --> 01:33:37,206
<i>Rebecca, help is on the way.</i>

1207
01:33:37,276 --> 01:33:39,836
<i>Just stay on the line.</i>
<i>Officers will be there soon.</i>

1208
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:42,142
<i>Okay, stay calm.</i>
<i>Stay calm, Rebecca.</i>

1209
01:33:42,214 --> 01:33:45,513
<i>Do you see any exits</i>
<i>nearby?</i>

1210
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:47,745
<i>No!</i>

1211
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:49,548
<i>Okay, just stay where you are.</i>

1212
01:33:49,621 --> 01:33:52,419
<i>Get down low.</i>
<i>The officers will be there soon.</i>

1213
01:33:52,491 --> 01:33:56,621
<i>Stay calm.</i>
<i>Stay calm, Rebecca, okay?</i>

1214
01:33:56,695 --> 01:34:00,597
<i>Help is on the way, darling, okay?</i>
<i>Officers are on the way right now.</i>

1215
01:34:04,369 --> 01:34:06,837
<i>Do you know how many shooters</i>
<i>there are, Rebecca?</i>

1216
01:34:06,905 --> 01:34:08,497
<i>There are two guys with guns.</i>

1217
01:34:08,574 --> 01:34:10,303
<i>And what room are you in, Rebecca?</i>

1218
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:12,206
<i>On the second floor</i>
<i>in the science lab.</i>

1219
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:14,142
<i>All right, stay calm, dear.</i>

1220
01:34:14,212 --> 01:34:16,908
<i>Oh, God, oh, God.</i>

1221
01:34:16,982 --> 01:34:19,507
<i>I think they've killed our teacher.</i>

1222
01:34:19,585 --> 01:34:22,179
<i>Rebecca, hold on sweetie, okay?</i>

1223
01:34:22,254 --> 01:34:24,279
<i>Help is coming, darling.</i>

1224
01:34:24,356 --> 01:34:28,087
<i>Just stay on the line with me,</i>
<i>all right, Rebecca?</i>

1225
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,923
<i>Just breathe, sweetie.</i>

1226
01:34:29,995 --> 01:34:31,758
<i>Just breathe.</i>

1227
01:34:33,899 --> 01:34:36,663
<i>Rebecca,</i>
<i>are you hurt?</i>

1228
01:34:36,735 --> 01:34:38,202
<i>Are you injured?</i>

1229
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:39,999
<i>Is anyone injured near you?</i>

1230
01:34:42,441 --> 01:34:45,239
<i>Okay, stay calm, stay calm.</i>
<i>Just be calm, Rebecca.</i>

1231
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:48,279
<i>Just stay on the line.</i>
<i>Just stay on the line.</i>

1232
01:34:48,347 --> 01:34:50,941
<i>Oh, God. Oh, God.</i>

1233
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:54,816
<i>Rebecca? Rebecca?</i>

1234
01:34:54,886 --> 01:34:57,650
<i>Rebecca?</i>

1235
01:34:58,305 --> 01:35:04,328
