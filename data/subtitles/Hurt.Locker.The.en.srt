1
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:52,932
Approaching.

2
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:03,783
I think we have touchdown.

3
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,443
- Little to the right.
- Going to the right.

4
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,394
<i>Hello, mum.</i>

5
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:39,734
Now, push it in.

6
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,295
I can't.

7
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,578
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man.

8
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:48,495
How about I pretend it's your dick?

9
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,033
You'll never get in if you did that.

10
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:53,304
- Here. Let me have a shot.
- Give me a second.

11
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,664
- No, come on. My dick, man.
- Go.

12
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:02,745
Fucker.

13
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,764
- Got that.
- Yeah.

14
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:11,514
Here we go.

15
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,914
Oh, look at that.

16
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,776
- Nice 155, huh?
- Yeah.

17
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:24,034
It's going to
do some fucking damage.

18
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:27,115
Hey, Eldridge, looks like
we're going to need a charge.

19
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:28,445
I got that.

20
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:32,036
Figured four blocks that'll
give us about 20 pounds of bang total.

21
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:34,706
That blast is going to
roast straight out there.

22
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:37,724
The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel

23
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:40,168
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.

24
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,187
Yep.

25
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:44,586
We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way.

26
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:46,686
But we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee.

27
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:48,769
- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.
- No problem.

28
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:53,096
Bot is moving.

29
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,657
<i>Let me know what you got, Eldridge.</i>

30
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:11,144
Good to go.

31
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,917
All right. Wagon's
set up. Bot moves.

32
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,457
Uh-oh. We got goats, guys.

33
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,418
Goats twelve o'clock. Watch out.

34
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:22,627
Load them little bastards up.

35
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:40,778
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

36
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:43,978
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

37
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,278
Wagon's having a bad day, boys.

38
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,278
- You build that?
- No, the U.S. Army did.

39
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,619
All right. Looks like
I'm going down there.

40
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:52,829
You don't like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood?

41
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,879
Oh, I love it.

42
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:06,158
So, if everything looks okay
when I get down there

43
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:08,550
I'm just going
to set it up and bip it.

44
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,509
Give these people
something to think about.

45
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,519
Want them to know if they're gonna leave
a bomb on the side of the road for us.

46
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,269
We're just going to blow up
their little fuckin' road.

47
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,321
Sounds good.

48
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,649
Craving a burger, is that strange?

49
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,439
- Not for you.
- No, okay.

50
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,930
Helmet on.

51
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,221
Happy trails.

52
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,290
Blaster One, can you read me?

53
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:37,500
Roger that, Blaster One.
You're good to go.

54
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,961
<i>You're looking good, Blaster One.</i>

55
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,512
Nice and hot in here.

56
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:14,731
One fifty.

57
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,951
Roger that, 150 meters.

58
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:32,103
Hi.

59
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,223
- Where are you from?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

60
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:35,793
Where are you from?
Where are you from?

61
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:37,209
California?

62
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:38,673
- Hey, get out of here, man.
- Where?

63
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:41,175
Hey, this ain't no fuckin' meet
and greet. Now get out of here.

64
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:42,863
Now.

65
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:47,163
Go.

66
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:57,704
You making friends again, Sanborn?

67
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,403
All day long.

68
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:07,884
Twenty-five.

69
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,254
<i>Twenty-five meters.</i> Roger that.
You are now in the kill zone.

70
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,923
Thanks for reminding me.

71
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:17,053
That's what I'm here for, baby.

72
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:19,485
Okay.

73
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,524
The dets are good.

74
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,536
<i>Roger that.</i>

75
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:03,435
I'm laying on the charge...

76
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:05,815
Nice and sweet.

77
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:09,026
We're good to go.

78
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:10,886
I'm coming back.

79
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:16,326
- Five meters out.
- Five meters. Roger that.

80
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:17,855
<i>Hey, Sanborn.</i>

81
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,367
- You know what this place needs?
- I'm listening.

82
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,065
Needs grass.

83
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,667
We gonna start our grass business?

84
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:27,737
That's right, man.

85
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:31,836
I'm going to sell the grass,
you're going to cut it.

86
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,217
It's going to be called
"Sanborn and Sons".

87
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,217
We'll be rich.

88
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:43,017
<i>I like that. Crabgrass,
St. Augustine, man.</i>

89
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:44,758
<i>I'm a scholar on this shit.</i>

90
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:49,607
<i>How about this?
You sell it, I fertilize it.</i>

91
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,567
<i>- 25.
- 25 meters. Roger that.</i>

92
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,148
Sanborn!

93
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:58,197
Butcher shop, two o'clock,
dude has a phone!

94
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,567
Why is Eldridge running?

95
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,658
- Make him put it down!
- Put down the phone!

96
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:04,499
Come on, guys. Talk to me.

97
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:07,328
Drop the phone!
Drop your phone!

98
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,868
Hey, burn him, Eldridge. Burn him!

99
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:12,379
- Put down the cell phone!
- Eldridge, burn him!

100
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,282
- Get out of the way.
- Drop your phone!

101
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:16,177
<i>Make him put it down!
Go get it!</i>

102
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:19,548
<i>- Come on, Eldridge!</i>
- I can't get a shot!

103
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,399
Thompson!

104
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,681
Anywhere's good.

105
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,171
<i>- Is that everything?</i>
- Yeah.

106
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:08,504
Yeah?

107
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:13,863
Come in.

108
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:17,453
Sergeant James.

109
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,883
JT Sanborn, my man.

110
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,932
Hey. Hi, how are you? Will.
I'm Will.

111
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:27,013
Welcome to Bravo Company,
welcome to Camp Victory.

112
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,683
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty.

113
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:32,563
Oh, no. They changed
that about a week ago.

114
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:33,803
Victory sounds better.

115
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:37,494
All right. Well, at least I'm
in the right place, right?

116
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,524
While you're here, can you help me
move this thing real quick?

117
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,604
Yeah, no problem.

118
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:42,734
Maybe you shouldn't take this down.

119
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:44,365
We get a lot of mortars at night.

120
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:47,664
The plywood on the windows help
with the lateral fray coming through.

121
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:48,813
That's why it's up there.

122
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:51,414
Yeah, well, it's not going
to stop a mortar round

123
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:53,105
from coming in through
the roof, you know.

124
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:56,254
Besides, I like the sunshine.

125
00:11:57,554 --> 00:11:59,884
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.

126
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,254
- I heard he was a good tech.
- Yeah, he was.

127
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:04,715
He was a great team leader too.

128
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:07,674
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fill his shoes or anything.

129
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,346
I'm just...
I'm just going to do my best.

130
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,475
- Appreciate it.
- All right.

131
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,054
Cool.

132
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,945
Home sweet home, right?

133
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,985
<i>Aren't you glad the Army has
all these tanks parked here?</i>

134
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:32,036
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battle.

135
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:36,115
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks,
just in case, than not have them.

136
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:37,506
<i>Yeah, but they don't do anything.</i>

137
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:40,596
Anyone comes alongside
a Humvee we're dead.

138
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:42,966
<i>Anybody even looks
at you funny we're dead.</i>

139
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:46,176
Pretty much the bottom line is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead.

140
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:47,927
<i>How's a fuckin' tank
supposed to stop that?</i>

141
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,506
- Would you shut the fuck up Owen, please?
- Sorry.

142
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,767
Just trying to scare the new guy.

143
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:55,647
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan too.

144
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:07,327
- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.
- Copy that.

145
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:14,697
Move.

146
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,087
Move!

147
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,330
<i>Blaster One, this is Victory Main.</i>

148
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,619
<i>Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.</i>

149
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,613
Where the hell are the guys
who called this in?

150
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,441
Victory Main, Victory Main.
This is Blaster Mike.

151
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,541
Interrogative, do you have
an update on position? Over.

152
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:40,370
<i>Victory Main, figures to follow.
Three-four-five-three is your grid. Over.</i>

153
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:49,974
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am
and I don't see anybody in fatigues.

154
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,130
<i>Give us a second to confirm grid. Over.</i>

155
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:54,422
Watch your feet.

156
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:57,971
<i>Set visual is three-four-five-three grid.
Over.</i>

157
00:14:58,692 --> 00:14:59,971
Got the Humvee.

158
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:04,552
Friendly!

159
00:15:07,662 --> 00:15:08,663
Friendly!

160
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:27,283
Ah, here we go.

161
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,594
They abandoned their vehicle.

162
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,923
We got an empty Humvee
over here, James.

163
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:35,182
Yeah, I got it.

164
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,315
Let's move.

165
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:42,883
Friendly.

166
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:49,614
<i>- Morning, boys.</i>
- Sir.

167
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,125
Don't tell me the bomb's
in here with you guys.

168
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,475
- Let's step out and I'll show you what's going on.
- All right.

169
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:57,453
Down on that block 20 meters,

170
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:59,573
this side of the mosque.
East side of the street.

171
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,583
Our informant says he saw
a pair of wires

172
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,124
going into a rubble pile.

173
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,964
- It's a possible IED.
- Yeah.

174
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,133
- I trust this guy, I know him.
- Okay, I'll handle it.

175
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,043
- Do you want to talk him or...?
- No.

176
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,384
Good. Keep your boys back.
We'll be good. Thank you.

177
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,134
Specialist, bring up the Humvee.

178
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:15,014
What's going on?

179
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:16,346
I'm going to break out the suit.

180
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,845
- What about the bot?
- I'll take care of it.

181
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,192
Don't you want to send the bot down
there to see what it looks like?

182
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:23,215
I'll handle it.

183
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,315
It's kind of tight down here, James.

184
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,046
Ready?

185
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:46,885
Good?

186
00:16:57,186 --> 00:17:00,135
You don't have to go down there.
We already have the bot halfway up.

187
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:01,216
I'll be all right.

188
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:15,567
First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?

189
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,233
How's it looking, Eldridge?

190
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:24,666
- Good to go.
- Let's do it.

191
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:37,096
- Got tools?
- Got two.

192
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:38,807
All right, let's rock and roll, man.

193
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:00,188
- He's a rowdy boy.
- He's reckless.

194
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:14,669
Blaster One, what's going on?

195
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:17,878
<i>Blaster One! What are you doing?</i>

196
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,430
Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike.

197
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,281
What's with the smoke on
the side of the road? Over.

198
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:27,848
<i>Hey, James, can you hear me?</i>

199
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:31,230
What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over.

200
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,019
<i>Creating a diversion.</i>

201
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,349
From what? Is there a threat?

202
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,859
Eldridge, get up on the wall, Move!

203
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:41,990
Tell me what you see, specialist.

204
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,119
All right, I got him.

205
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,789
He's walking down range.

206
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,461
James, the smoke
is killing my visibility.

207
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:53,130
Where are you in relationship to the IED?
Are you within 100 meters yet?

208
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,260
<i>Hell, I don't know Sanborn, but I'll tell
you when I'm standing over it, cowboy.</i>

209
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,632
Take cover!

210
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:44,333
Oh, no. A car stopped
in front of him, Sanborn.

211
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:47,353
Shit, James! <i>James, come back now.</i>

212
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,432
EOD pulled a nine
on this Haji in a car.

213
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,552
You want me to send backup?

214
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:55,403
I got it.

215
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:57,863
- Sanchez, Harris!
- Negative! Negative!

216
00:19:58,162 --> 00:19:59,262
Stand down!

217
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,192
The blast will come up the block.

218
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,192
<i>Stay clear around the corner.</i>

219
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:06,073
<i>EOD has the situation
under control, over.</i>

220
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:09,663
Where you going?

221
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:11,982
Want to back up?

222
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,453
Get out of the car!

223
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:21,673
- Get out of the car!
- Come on!

224
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:27,263
What the fuck are you doing?

225
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:31,734
Back up.

226
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,193
Hello?

227
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:53,325
Want to get back?

228
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:16,237
It's that way.

229
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:22,346
Back.

230
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:43,624
<i>Taxi's moving.</i>

231
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:46,386
Get out of the car!
Stop!

232
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:55,397
On the ground! Stay down!

233
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,767
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent,
he sure the hell is now.

234
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,777
Roger that. That's real funny.

235
00:22:58,929 --> 00:22:59,930
Got something.

236
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,789
Hello baby.

237
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,881
Gotcha.

238
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:01,613
All right.

239
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:08,403
We're done.

240
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:13,363
<i>Good to go.</i>

241
00:24:13,413 --> 00:24:14,862
Come down, specialist.

242
00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:17,423
Roger.

243
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,083
Got a wire.

244
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:35,712
Hang on.

245
00:24:41,403 --> 00:24:43,223
Where are you going?

246
00:24:58,044 --> 00:24:59,234
Secondary.

247
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,311
Shit.

248
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:02,096
Take cover. Get in the wall.
Get in the wall.

249
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:49,842
That wasn't so bad. First time working
together. What do you think?

250
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:57,449
I think us working together means
I talk to you and you talk to me.

251
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,578
- We going on a date, Sanborn?
- No.

252
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,318
We're going on a mission.

253
00:27:02,628 --> 00:27:05,578
And my job is to keep you safe
so we can keep going on missions.

254
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:07,209
It's combat, buddy.

255
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:16,140
Hey.

256
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,798
It's just 39 days.

257
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:19,390
38 if we survive today.

258
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,589
Hey, it's "Mr. Be All You Can Be".

259
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:41,580
What's up, doc?

260
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,069
Not much. How are you?

261
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,131
I'm good.

262
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:50,330
Got a question about that
song, "Be All You Can Be".

263
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,250
What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?

264
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:56,000
<i>I mean, I think it's logical.</i>

265
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:01,260
This is war. People die
all the time. Why not me?

266
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:03,721
You got to change
the record in our head.

267
00:28:03,861 --> 00:28:05,583
You gotta start thinking
about other things.

268
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,261
Okay. Stop obsessing.

269
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,641
<i>Right now, what are you thinking about?</i>

270
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,902
You want to know what
I'm thinking about, doc?

271
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,060
- Yeah.
- This is what I'm thinking about, doc.

272
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:20,151
Here's Thompson, okay.
He's dead. He's alive.

273
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,991
Here's Thompson.
He's dead. He's alive.

274
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:26,872
He's dead. He's alive.

275
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:35,461
Yo, what's up, my nigger?
What's up, man? You cool?

276
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:38,515
Come on. You want the cool shit?
Come on, come on. It's the tight shit, man.

277
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:41,011
Wanna buy DVDs?
Wanna buy DVD?

278
00:28:41,061 --> 00:28:43,011
Fuck you.
Come, come, please, please.

279
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:44,832
New releases. Look.

280
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,343
Hello, Hello.
Want to buy DVDs? Very good, Very good.

281
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:48,500
How much?

282
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:49,971
One for five and two for nine.

283
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:51,102
Three for twelve.

284
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:54,113
Three for thirteen and I don't
give you tax, Very good, man, Look.

285
00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:56,022
No tax?

286
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:57,903
All right, What do you got?
What do you got?

287
00:28:58,032 --> 00:29:01,482
You know, you smart shit.
You not like those stupid fucks.

288
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:03,113
Yeah, I'm the smart guy.

289
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,823
You're a smart kid.
Give me your best one, okay?

290
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:09,413
- Here, this the best one.
- This is a good one?

291
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:11,534
- Yeah, The best shit, man.
- Okay.

292
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:13,233
Here you go.
I'll take one.

293
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,222
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

294
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:16,224
Want a cigarette?

295
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:18,544
Get out of here.
You shouldn't smoke.

296
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:22,054
Thank you. Take it easy.

297
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:31,183
I need to talk to you about
something before we go out again.

298
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:33,236
What's that?

299
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:37,064
- Yesterday.
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:39,434
Wasn't cool.

301
00:29:40,993 --> 00:29:44,193
Yeah, I know.
You'll get it, though.

302
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:49,664
- So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah.

303
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:53,535
I was in intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD.

304
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:58,755
We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.

305
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:05,174
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
redneck piece of trailer trash like you.

306
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:09,015
Looks like you're on the right track.

307
00:30:11,194 --> 00:30:12,266
<i>We'll see you out there.</i>

308
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:24,876
Let's go, move!

309
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:34,247
Shit. Get out of the way. Move.

310
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:39,586
Hallo.

311
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:43,116
- Where is it?
- It's behind the wall.

312
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:45,626
- All right.
- See any wires? Any smoke?

313
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:46,787
No, I didn't look.

314
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:47,926
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

315
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:50,307
The car has been parked illegally.

316
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:53,478
The suspension is sagging. There's
definitely something heavy in the trunk.

317
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:56,846
Right. So, why don't you walk over there
and peak inside and tell me what you see.

318
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,936
You want me to go close to it?

319
00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:03,228
Yeah. No-no, I don't. I'm kidding.

320
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:56,960
Shit.

321
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:58,579
It's coming from over here!

322
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:06,351
Blaster One, You there?

323
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,839
Blaster One, you hear me?

324
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,750
Here.

325
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:25,201
Shit.

326
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:29,111
Let's go, guys.

327
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,332
Let it go.

328
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:34,451
I got top cover.

329
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:35,651
That's a negative, specialist.

330
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:37,030
Eldridge, you stay with me.

331
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,621
Sanborn, you take top cover.

332
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:39,672
Shit.

333
00:33:19,712 --> 00:33:20,982
Blaster Mike in position.

334
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:47,575
What do you got?

335
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:50,267
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stable.

336
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,275
He's not going to make it.

337
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,614
We're leaving in 15 minutes.

338
00:33:54,663 --> 00:33:56,074
Got a survival wound, sir.

339
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:58,814
He's not going to make it.

340
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:28,577
Oh, God.

341
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:41,576
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

342
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:47,195
What are you doing?

343
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:49,338
There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus.

344
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:53,217
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die comfortable.

345
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:55,297
I need my kit and my cans.

346
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:57,175
What's going on down there, Eldridge?

347
00:34:57,646 --> 00:35:00,516
<i>I'm getting his kit and his cans.
Cover me, please.</i>

348
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:12,317
Kit and cans.

349
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:32,878
Got a lot of deck cord, electrical.

350
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,728
I'm looking for the initiating system.

351
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,219
Well, it's not in the back seat.

352
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,139
I don't think.

353
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,780
All right. It's not in the back seat.

354
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,041
Got a young man on the roof,
your nine o'clock. Keep an eye on him.

355
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,262
Roger that.

356
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:05,550
It's not in the front seat.

357
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,351
It's not in the door.

358
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:20,992
Not on the floors.

359
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:26,782
Not in the glove box.

360
00:37:27,293 --> 00:37:29,581
If you haven't found it yet,
it's probably under the car.

361
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:33,402
Yeah. No wire leads under... the car.
It's all in here somewhere.

362
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:42,342
- Hey, Sanborn.
- Yeah.

363
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,342
You got eyes on some guy
with a video camera?

364
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:46,443
No, Where?

365
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,623
He's right at my twelve
o'clock, you see him?

366
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,416
He's pointing the fucking
thing right at me.

367
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,043
Shit.

368
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:03,313
Negative, I don't see him.

369
00:38:03,873 --> 00:38:07,204
<i>Hey, Sanborn. He's right at my
twelve o'clock. Look! Twelve o'clock!</i>

370
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:09,623
Roger that. I got him.

371
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:16,123
<i>Getting ready to put me on YouTube.</i>

372
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:19,963
- Little shady.
- Yeah, he looks shady. Keep and eye on him.

373
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,844
Okay. So, what's the play?

374
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:25,634
Be smart. Make a good decision, over.

375
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:34,094
Got more wire.

376
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,355
Leads fucking nowhere.

377
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:44,224
Fuck!

378
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:46,735
<i>Hey, James, how you doing?</i>

379
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:50,114
I'm wonderful. How are you?

380
00:38:50,335 --> 00:38:51,824
You know, we've been here a while.

381
00:38:53,715 --> 00:38:55,034
<i>We need to get out of here soon.</i>

382
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:56,217
Uh-huh.

383
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:03,925
We got a lot of eyes on us, James.
We need to get out of here.

384
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,596
Roger that. I'm going
to figure this out.

385
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:11,635
<i>James, we need to get out of here.</i>

386
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:14,806
James, do you copy?

387
00:39:15,615 --> 00:39:17,186
Fuck it, I get it.

388
00:39:19,286 --> 00:39:21,815
Fuck me.

389
00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:31,947
- Hey, how's it looking in there, soldier?
- All clear.

390
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:34,996
James, the evac
is complete, we can leave.

391
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:36,456
Let the engineers handle this mess.

392
00:39:36,547 --> 00:39:38,626
- We moving?
- That's affirmative.

393
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:54,007
Interesting.

394
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:56,137
What's up with, James?
He's not answering.

395
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:59,398
Yeah, I think he removed his headset.

396
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:03,487
Well, will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?

397
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:05,197
Hey, James!

398
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:09,369
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'll please put your headset back on.

399
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:17,867
Uh... that's a negative.

400
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:20,038
<i>That, yeah, that's not going to happen.</i>

401
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,230
I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at six o'clock.

402
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,291
<i>- What the hell is he doing?</i>
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

403
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,039
Looks like, he's checking the oil.

404
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,791
They're communicating
with your cameraman.

405
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:44,581
This is real bad man.

406
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:46,041
Get behind the Jersey barrier.

407
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:52,972
I can't see James from here.

408
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:54,331
Get down now!

409
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:01,141
We can go!

410
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:08,992
Bastard.

411
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:34,244
We're done.

412
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:39,514
Sanborn, let's get out of here.

413
00:42:54,494 --> 00:42:55,574
Woo.

414
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,385
That was good.

415
00:43:20,025 --> 00:43:21,556
- Hey, James.
- What?

416
00:43:24,114 --> 00:43:26,014
Never turn your headset off again.

417
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:53,427
You the guy in the bomb suit?

418
00:43:54,056 --> 00:43:56,726
No, sir. Sir, that's Sergeant James.
He's right here.

419
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:58,717
- Hey, James.
- Yeah?

420
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:00,387
Someone's here to see you.

421
00:44:02,146 --> 00:44:04,516
You the guy in the flaming car,
Sergeant James?

422
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:06,266
Afternoon, sir.
Uh, yes, sir.

423
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:10,067
Well, that's just hot shit.

424
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,318
You're a wild man, you know that?

425
00:44:13,157 --> 00:44:14,817
- Uh, yes, sir.
- He's a wild man.

426
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:16,038
You know that?

427
00:44:16,996 --> 00:44:18,157
I want to shake your hand.

428
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,067
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

429
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:22,777
How many bombs have you disarmed?

430
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:24,867
Uh, I'm not quite sure.

431
00:44:24,918 --> 00:44:26,106
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

432
00:44:26,217 --> 00:44:27,367
I asked you a question.

433
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:30,617
873, sir.

434
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:34,588
Eight hundred! And seventy-three.

435
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:37,219
That's just hot shit.

436
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:39,137
873.

437
00:44:39,898 --> 00:44:42,061
- Counting today, sir, yes.
- That's gotta be a record.

438
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,768
What's the best way to... to go
about disarming one of these things?

439
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:51,688
The way you don't die, sir.

440
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:54,639
That's a good one.

441
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:57,608
That's spoken like a wild man.
That's good.

442
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:17,018
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Oh, hey, wait a minute.

443
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:18,340
Look who it is.

444
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,340
I want my five bucks back, buddy.

445
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,679
Five dollars for what, man?
You crazy now?

446
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,679
Yeah. The DVD you sold me was crap.

447
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,849
You crazy, man. That's impossible.
It's Hollywood special effects.

448
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,480
No. It was shaky.
It was out of focus, buddy.

449
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,989
- What, you want donkey porn?
- It's crap.

450
00:45:31,989 --> 00:45:34,190
Girls on dog?
Gay sex, man?

451
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,610
Anything you want, you get.

452
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:37,900
I hook you up, man.

453
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,820
All right, What... what's your name?

454
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:41,949
- Beckham.
- Beckham like the soccer player?

455
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,079
Yeah, man, It's like soccer player.
Now give me my ball.

456
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,271
Are you a soccer player?

457
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:48,331
Yeah, man. Best of the best.
I'm better than Beckham.

458
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,621
- You play goalie?
- Yes, I play goalie.

459
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:55,291
I'll make you a deal. If you can stop the
ball, I'm going to give you five bucks.

460
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,923
- But if you can't...
- And what if... what if I can't?

461
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:01,090
Listen to me. If I score,
I'm going to keep your ball.

462
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:02,461
- Deal?
- Deal.

463
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:05,501
Get up there.

464
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:08,101
Go on.

465
00:46:12,612 --> 00:46:14,693
- Let's see what you got, hot stuff.
- Are you ready?

466
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:16,181
On three, Ready?

467
00:46:16,532 --> 00:46:19,652
One, two, three. Aah!

468
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:24,230
Shit.

469
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:26,001
Come on. Where's the five dollars?
Man, come on.

470
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:28,483
All right, I got ya.
Good job, dude.

471
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:30,831
Here's five.

472
00:46:31,092 --> 00:46:33,342
You're an EOD, boomala, boomala.

473
00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:34,413
That's right.

474
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:35,492
It's fun, no?

475
00:46:35,552 --> 00:46:37,121
It's cool? It's gangster.

476
00:46:37,592 --> 00:46:40,672
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I think so.

477
00:46:41,393 --> 00:46:43,873
Tell you what, I... I'm going to buy...

478
00:46:44,273 --> 00:46:47,432
Let me see if I have
enough money, yeah. Five.

479
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:50,264
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?

480
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:55,103
But, if it's shaky... look at me...
or out of focus...

481
00:46:55,822 --> 00:46:57,733
or any way not 100%.

482
00:46:58,324 --> 00:47:01,063
I'm going to chop off your goddamned
head with a dull knife.

483
00:47:01,324 --> 00:47:03,483
How do you feel about that?
I'm just kidding.

484
00:47:05,414 --> 00:47:08,034
Here, You're a good kid, man.
You're a good kid, aren't ya?

485
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:10,545
Owen.

486
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,860
Hi.

487
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:14,074
- Hi, sir.
- How are you?

488
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:16,284
- I'm good.
- Good.

489
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:19,043
- What's wrong?
- Brakes are squeaking.

490
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:21,833
Don't trust the mechanics
around here, You know.

491
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:25,173
- So, how you doing?
- Good.

492
00:47:25,724 --> 00:47:27,003
I just want to check the oil.

493
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:30,425
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...

494
00:47:31,275 --> 00:47:33,394
I'm feeling pretty squared
away, actually, doc.

495
00:47:33,614 --> 00:47:34,855
I'm glad to hear it.

496
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,105
So, you getting along with the other
soldiers in your unit?

497
00:47:39,614 --> 00:47:44,985
Yeah. My team's great.
My team leader is inspiring.

498
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:48,655
- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?
- No.

499
00:47:49,005 --> 00:47:50,405
He's going to get me killed.

500
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:52,496
I almost died yesterday.

501
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:57,416
At least I'll die in the line
of duty, proud and strong.

502
00:47:57,885 --> 00:48:00,168
You know, this doesn't have
to be a bad time in your life.

503
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:03,675
Going to war is a, is a once
in a lifetime experience.

504
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:05,206
It could be fun.

505
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:08,306
And you know this from your
extensive work in the field, right?

506
00:48:08,356 --> 00:48:09,766
I've done my field duty.

507
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:11,925
Where's that? Yale?

508
00:48:13,896 --> 00:48:16,806
Look, you don't want me to come around,
I won't come around.

509
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:18,135
These talks are voluntary.

510
00:48:18,775 --> 00:48:19,936
Look, I'm sorry.

511
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:23,146
I appreciate what you're saying.
I do.

512
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:25,025
I appreciate our sessions together.

513
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:29,867
But you need to come out from
behind the wire, see what we do.

514
00:48:30,547 --> 00:48:31,547
Well,

515
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:34,036
if the circumstance calls for it, I will.

516
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:35,786
Just like every other soldier.

517
00:48:42,347 --> 00:48:43,706
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!

518
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:45,086
Firing now.

519
00:48:49,438 --> 00:48:51,757
Eee, ooh...

520
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:53,887
- Ready for second det?
- Ready.

521
00:48:54,608 --> 00:48:57,978
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!

522
00:48:58,027 --> 00:48:59,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second.

523
00:49:00,447 --> 00:49:03,527
Goddamn it.
I think it forgot my gloves down there.

524
00:49:03,737 --> 00:49:05,527
- What?
- I forgot my gloves.

525
00:49:05,947 --> 00:49:06,949
Hang on.

526
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,809
You know, these detonators
misfire all the time.

527
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:46,429
What are you doing?

528
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:49,820
I'm just saying shit happens,
they misfire.

529
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:54,949
He'd be obliterated to nothing.

530
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,659
<i>His helmet would be left.
You could have that.</i>

531
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,750
Little specs of hair,
charred on the inside.

532
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,960
<i>Yeah. There'd be half
a helmet somewhere,</i>

533
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,090
<i>bits of hair.</i>

534
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:11,771
Ask for a change
in technique and protocol,

535
00:50:11,811 --> 00:50:14,291
make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?

536
00:50:17,731 --> 00:50:19,141
You'd have to write the report.

537
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,190
- Are you serious?
- I can't write it.

538
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,070
No, I mean, are you serious
about killing him?

539
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:11,233
- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV.
- Roger that.

540
00:51:11,623 --> 00:51:13,233
I got four armed men.

541
00:51:13,663 --> 00:51:15,244
They're in Haji gear.

542
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:18,572
All right. Go slow and easy man.

543
00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:28,423
Be ready now.

544
00:51:31,514 --> 00:51:33,463
All right. Careful now, guys. Careful.

545
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:36,172
- Eldridge, you stay on that 50.
- I got 'em.

546
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:39,804
<i>Obre! Obre!</i>
Put your gun down!

547
00:51:39,853 --> 00:51:43,603
On your knees!
Put your gun down!

548
00:51:43,693 --> 00:51:46,853
- <i>Obre</i>, motherfucker!
- Hold up your hands.

549
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,983
Get down, motherfucker. <i>Obre!</i>

550
00:51:49,534 --> 00:51:51,693
Put your gun down now!

551
00:51:57,454 --> 00:51:59,193
Put your gun down!

552
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:04,954
Advance, advance...

553
00:52:25,195 --> 00:52:26,516
Hands high.

554
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:29,476
- Eldridge, cover!
- I got you.

555
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:32,775
Pistol, off your hip, now.

556
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:34,224
What you want me to do?

557
00:52:34,246 --> 00:52:35,985
Keep my hands up or take off the pistol?

558
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:40,195
- Keep your hands up.
- Okay.

559
00:52:45,637 --> 00:52:47,206
Easy, easy.

560
00:52:47,795 --> 00:52:48,797
Got it!

561
00:52:51,096 --> 00:52:52,666
Can I touch my fucking head now?

562
00:52:54,516 --> 00:52:55,518
Slowly.

563
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:05,307
We're on the same fucking side, guys.

564
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:07,697
Jesus.

565
00:53:08,737 --> 00:53:10,478
You guys are wired fucking tight,
you know that?

566
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,608
Well, this is no place for a picnic.
What are you guys doing here?

567
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,447
We have a flat tire.
Can you help us?

568
00:53:15,498 --> 00:53:17,106
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?

569
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:19,067
We have spares, but
we've used up our wrench.

570
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:20,608
How do you use up a wrench?

571
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:23,416
Well, the uh, the guy over there
with the red thing on his head.

572
00:53:23,418 --> 00:53:24,498
He threw it at someone.

573
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:27,108
- All right.
- Thank you.

574
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:34,128
That's Chris.
This is the wrench man.

575
00:53:34,469 --> 00:53:36,628
- Hello, wrench man.
- That's Jimmy.

576
00:53:36,677 --> 00:53:39,077
You know, you can shoot people here.
You don't have to throw a wrench at 'em.

577
00:53:39,137 --> 00:53:40,139
Fuck off.

578
00:53:49,949 --> 00:53:51,139
Take a look at this.

579
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:53,728
I picked these guys up in Najaf.

580
00:53:55,949 --> 00:53:57,398
Nine of hearts, that's one.

581
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:01,108
And the other, jack of clubs.

582
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:07,949
- These the same guys?
- Yep, That's them.

583
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:13,001
Does he need a little help there?

584
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:15,210
What's the problem
with the tire? Come on.

585
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:20,050
No good, boss.
This wrench is too small.

586
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:21,719
All right, solutions? Anyone?

587
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:24,391
I think there's another wrench in the
back of the Humvee if you want to check.

588
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,282
- I'll give it a try.
- All right. Let's do it.

589
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:28,769
How long you guys out here?

590
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,481
Specialist, what do we got?

591
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,980
- We have... 23 more days or 22...
- Oh yeah.

592
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,860
No one's counting.

593
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:46,990
Contact left.

594
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:58,880
Take cover.

595
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:02,050
Chris, take the 50.
Jimmy, take that in the Humvee.

596
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:03,552
- Got it.
- Come on!

597
00:55:17,612 --> 00:55:18,612
Charlie, go!

598
00:55:19,871 --> 00:55:21,322
Go, go, go!

599
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:29,773
We need more ammo.

600
00:55:29,842 --> 00:55:33,583
Look inside.
Take all the go-bags, Jimmy.

601
00:55:35,882 --> 00:55:38,503
- What are we shooting at?
- I don't know.

602
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:40,601
Fuck. The packages are gone!

603
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,782
<i>They won't get far on foot.</i>

604
00:55:41,893 --> 00:55:45,052
Bring 'em back those fuckers now.
I'm out 500000 fucking pounds.

605
00:55:58,284 --> 00:55:59,284
I forgot,

606
00:55:59,414 --> 00:56:01,693
it's 500000 dead or alive.

607
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:08,043
- Okay. Jimmy, give me the Barret.
- Yeah.

608
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:11,355
I can't see a thing.

609
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:14,635
Come on!

610
00:56:20,014 --> 00:56:22,635
Chris is shooting wild.
Gotta conserve the ammo.

611
00:56:22,684 --> 00:56:23,954
Hey, Chris, can you hear me?

612
00:56:24,724 --> 00:56:28,664
Hey, Chris! Chris! Can you hear me?
Chill out on the 50!

613
00:56:28,894 --> 00:56:29,896
Roger that.

614
00:56:32,275 --> 00:56:34,474
- 50's down.
- They shot Chris.

615
00:56:45,824 --> 00:56:47,445
It must be coming from that building.

616
00:56:47,496 --> 00:56:48,686
I can't see anything.

617
00:56:53,626 --> 00:56:54,905
Movement on the roof.

618
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:09,976
Yeah?

619
00:57:10,317 --> 00:57:11,467
Three meters higher.

620
00:57:11,726 --> 00:57:15,677
I'm going to adjust.

621
00:57:44,177 --> 00:57:45,288
Fuck!

622
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:48,126
Fuck, he's dead.

623
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:49,927
We've got to get out of here now!

624
00:57:50,106 --> 00:57:50,637
Dammit.

625
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:52,436
This is Alpha Nine.
We're in deep shit.

626
00:57:52,438 --> 00:57:53,677
I'll get on the Barret.

627
00:57:53,728 --> 00:57:54,518
Go, go, go.

628
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,268
Yeah, we're taking incoming fire.

629
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:57,228
Go, go, go.

630
00:57:57,318 --> 00:57:59,398
- No, Sanborn, no. Don't go up there.
- Got it!

631
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:01,188
Go, buddy, stay low!
Stay low!

632
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:02,259
I have two KIA.

633
00:58:02,987 --> 00:58:06,608
Correction, three KIA...
our grid last lock stat...

634
00:58:07,014 --> 00:58:08,014
Stay low!

635
00:58:08,038 --> 00:58:09,197
Can you get me some help?

636
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,027
- Behind you.
- Yeah.

637
00:58:29,978 --> 00:58:31,168
<i>Breathe easy.</i>

638
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,009
<i>- I got movement.</i>
- Yeah.

639
00:58:35,769 --> 00:58:37,099
On the ridge of that house.

640
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,980
850 meters.

641
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,559
- See it.
- By the window.

642
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:50,150
- You have target.
- Got it.

643
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,699
All right, here little left.

644
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,039
Just breathe easy.

645
00:59:09,351 --> 00:59:12,300
- I'm out of ammo.
- Hmm?

646
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:14,391
I'm out of ammo.

647
00:59:14,521 --> 00:59:16,891
Eldridge, we need ammo.

648
00:59:21,442 --> 00:59:22,443
Where is it?

649
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:25,021
Check on the dead guy, man.

650
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:26,442
<i>It's on the dead man.</i>

651
00:59:32,911 --> 00:59:33,990
<i>Eldridge!</i>

652
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:35,362
I'm looking.

653
00:59:38,711 --> 00:59:40,121
We need that ammo, man.

654
00:59:40,422 --> 00:59:41,422
All right, man.

655
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:44,402
Oh, here.

656
00:59:47,432 --> 00:59:48,532
Thanks.

657
01:00:01,943 --> 01:00:03,181
All right. Got it.

658
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,722
Same target.

659
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,393
It's fucking jammed.

660
01:00:10,204 --> 01:00:11,204
Let me see it.

661
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,335
Fuck!

662
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:19,112
Aw, shit.
The blood's making it jam. Eldridge!

663
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:20,753
Shit!

664
01:00:20,793 --> 01:00:23,001
You gotta clean the blood off, man.
It's making 'em jam.

665
01:00:23,003 --> 01:00:24,414
Specialist!

666
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:28,833
<i>- Clean the blood off.</i>
- Okay.

667
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,634
Clean it. Clean it.

668
01:00:37,603 --> 01:00:38,673
<i>You gotta clean it, man.</i>

669
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:40,434
- How?
- Spit and rub.

670
01:00:43,943 --> 01:00:44,945
All right.

671
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:48,184
<i>Spit and rub, buddy.
Spit and rub.</i>

672
01:00:51,034 --> 01:00:54,193
It's not working.
It's not coming off.

673
01:00:58,664 --> 01:01:02,155
Spit and rub. Spit and rub.
Here, take it out.

674
01:01:04,545 --> 01:01:06,427
- Use your camel. Use your camel.
- Where is it?

675
01:01:06,675 --> 01:01:08,625
You all right?

676
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,045
Here, use that.

677
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:14,994
Just breathe, buddy.

678
01:01:15,184 --> 01:01:16,456
Come on. Just breathe in.

679
01:01:16,726 --> 01:01:18,806
Good. Here, squeeze.

680
01:01:19,565 --> 01:01:21,346
- Got it?
- Yeah.

681
01:01:22,525 --> 01:01:25,436
Rub that ojive, baby.
Come on. You got it.

682
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:36,815
You're doing good, man.
You're doing real good.

683
01:01:39,085 --> 01:01:40,657
- Got 'em?
- Yeah.

684
01:01:41,795 --> 01:01:43,246
I'm going to keep
you safe, buddy, all right?

685
01:01:43,547 --> 01:01:45,429
Now let's get these bastards.
Scan your sectors.

686
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:46,777
Scan your sectors.

687
01:01:54,766 --> 01:01:56,507
Kill that fuckin' asshole.

688
01:01:58,646 --> 01:01:59,887
Son of a bitch.

689
01:02:11,157 --> 01:02:14,358
Nice. He's down.
Second one is out of range.

690
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:17,237
Twenty meters to
the right of the building.

691
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:23,708
I got him.

692
01:02:26,418 --> 01:02:27,608
<i>Fire when ready.</i>

693
01:02:35,768 --> 01:02:38,007
<i>He's moving. He's moving.
To the building.</i>

694
01:02:38,349 --> 01:02:40,509
- Follow him. You got him?
- Got him.

695
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:46,320
<i>He's down.</i>

696
01:02:48,568 --> 01:02:51,309
Goodnight. Thanks for playing.

697
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:03,409
Window. At the window. At the window.

698
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:10,188
He's still there.

699
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,311
Left window.
Left window. Got him?

700
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:29,612
Got him.

701
01:03:49,211 --> 01:03:50,231
He's down.

702
01:04:47,273 --> 01:04:50,182
- Hey, Owen.
- Yeah?

703
01:04:50,983 --> 01:04:53,804
Can you grab the juice
out of the pack, please?

704
01:04:53,864 --> 01:04:54,864
Sure.

705
01:05:07,414 --> 01:05:08,653
I think we're out.

706
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:12,534
- Got anything left to drink?
- You could try that one.

707
01:05:33,315 --> 01:05:34,317
Thank you.

708
01:06:00,675 --> 01:06:03,347
Drink. Drink it.

709
01:07:07,197 --> 01:07:08,898
Things are real quiet.

710
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:11,989
Yeah, I don't like it.

711
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:34,929
- Hey, Will?
- Yeah?

712
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:37,809
<i>At your six o'clock,</i>

713
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,559
<i>I see movement on the bridge.
Right on the tracks.</i>

714
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,900
Well, handle it.

715
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:50,900
Should I fire?

716
01:07:52,251 --> 01:07:53,490
It's your call, buddy.

717
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,171
Good job.

718
01:08:54,722 --> 01:08:55,912
Hey, Sanborn.

719
01:09:00,563 --> 01:09:01,893
I think we're done.

720
01:09:15,453 --> 01:09:16,993
Okay? You all right?

721
01:09:20,753 --> 01:09:23,556
That's what you get for hitting
your fucking team leader, motherfucker.

722
01:09:25,753 --> 01:09:28,003
- Oh man.
- I'll be right back, I gotta piss.

723
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:29,863
Owen.

724
01:09:30,344 --> 01:09:32,503
Another round, boy.
That's and order.

725
01:09:32,554 --> 01:09:34,753
Well, yes sir, Sgt. James, sir.

726
01:09:35,054 --> 01:09:36,634
You're not very good
with people, are you, sir?

727
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:38,405
But you're a good warrior.
Give me your mug.

728
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:40,582
There ya go, sir.

729
01:09:40,604 --> 01:09:43,645
You acquitted yourself well on the field
of battle today, specialist.

730
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:45,425
Cheers.

731
01:09:53,414 --> 01:09:55,064
Uh, I'm too old for this shit.

732
01:10:00,545 --> 01:10:03,246
- I was scared.
- Yeah?

733
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:07,034
Well, everyone's a coward
about something, you know.

734
01:10:09,845 --> 01:10:12,405
You're good. You're real good.

735
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:14,296
Just what do we have here?

736
01:10:15,185 --> 01:10:17,855
Will has possessions.

737
01:10:18,975 --> 01:10:20,886
I didn't know you owned anything, Will.

738
01:10:20,935 --> 01:10:22,555
Let's see what you got here, Will.

739
01:10:25,145 --> 01:10:26,146
Who is that?

740
01:10:26,317 --> 01:10:27,645
That's my son.

741
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:32,725
He's a tough little bastard.
Nothing like me.

742
01:10:32,786 --> 01:10:34,697
You mean to tell me you married?

743
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:40,025
Well, you know,
I had a girlfriend and...

744
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:43,247
...she got pregnant,
so we got married.

745
01:10:44,126 --> 01:10:45,396
We got divorced.

746
01:10:48,087 --> 01:10:49,957
Or I thought we got divorced.

747
01:10:50,096 --> 01:10:53,457
She's still living in the house.
And she says we're still together.

748
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:57,127
So I don't know.
What does that make her?

749
01:10:57,438 --> 01:11:00,886
Dumb for still being with your ass.

750
01:11:02,832 --> 01:11:03,833
Hey.

751
01:11:03,856 --> 01:11:05,307
She ain't fuckin' dumb,
all right?

752
01:11:05,608 --> 01:11:06,847
She's just loyal.

753
01:11:08,648 --> 01:11:11,268
She's just loyal. That's all.
How 'bout you guys?

754
01:11:12,328 --> 01:11:15,608
You got... you got a girl?
What do you got?

755
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:19,488
My only problem is the girl I do like.

756
01:11:20,248 --> 01:11:22,778
I can't stop her from talking
about babies, man.

757
01:11:22,957 --> 01:11:24,908
Well, give her your sperm, stud.

758
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:27,288
Go on. Do it.

759
01:11:27,707 --> 01:11:29,966
- C'mon, chicken. Just give it to her.
- No. Hell no.

760
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:30,988
Make babies.

761
01:11:31,047 --> 01:11:34,498
I know when I'm ready, and I
ain't ready for that yet. I know that.

762
01:11:34,809 --> 01:11:38,748
Well, well...
what do we have here?

763
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:41,759
Uh, components.

764
01:11:43,059 --> 01:11:45,350
They're bomb parts. Signatures.

765
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:47,480
Yeah, I see that, but
what they doing under your bed?

766
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:51,599
Well...

767
01:11:58,409 --> 01:11:59,430
Aha.

768
01:11:59,539 --> 01:12:00,988
There we go. This one.

769
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:05,479
This one is from the UN-building.

770
01:12:05,539 --> 01:12:09,230
Flaming car.
Dead man's switch. Boom.

771
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,079
This guy was good. I like him.

772
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:14,500
- Relay.
- Ah... look at this one.

773
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:19,591
This one, y'all, is from
our first call together.

774
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:24,840
This box is full of stuff
that almost killed me.

775
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,751
And what about this one?

776
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,141
- Where's this one from, Will?
- It's my wedding ring.

777
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:32,060
Like I said, stuff that almost killed me.

778
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:37,980
You know, I just think
it's really interesting

779
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:39,362
to hold something in your hand
that could have killed anyone.

780
01:12:40,372 --> 01:12:43,110
Damn that. It's all that shit
from RadioShack.

781
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:46,911
It's interesting.

782
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:49,161
I think it's interesting too.

783
01:12:49,212 --> 01:12:50,960
Well, I think you hit me harder

784
01:12:50,961 --> 01:12:54,121
than I hit you, motherfucker,
therefore I owe you a punch.

785
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:55,912
Now get your ass up. C'mon.

786
01:12:56,221 --> 01:12:59,131
- C'mon. Let's go. C'mon.
- He's right.

787
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:01,742
Come on!

788
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:03,591
All right, hold on boys.
We need some rules.

789
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,591
Sanborn, no face shots.

790
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:06,631
Oh, there's gonna be a face shot.

791
01:13:06,771 --> 01:13:08,213
Sergeant James, take off your shirt.

792
01:13:09,021 --> 01:13:10,212
Yes, sir.

793
01:13:10,862 --> 01:13:11,881
What happened?

794
01:13:12,192 --> 01:13:14,061
My momma dropped me
when I was a baby.

795
01:13:14,992 --> 01:13:16,141
Looks like frag scars.

796
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:20,273
- Let it go, Eldridge. C'mon.
- All right.

797
01:13:20,622 --> 01:13:22,061
Nice and big.

798
01:13:27,122 --> 01:13:28,283
Ooh!

799
01:13:36,092 --> 01:13:37,253
You like that, huh?

800
01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:38,912
That's all you got?

801
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:40,672
Come on.

802
01:13:43,514 --> 01:13:45,092
Bring some, C'mon.

803
01:13:46,894 --> 01:13:48,082
Ooh!

804
01:13:51,484 --> 01:13:54,604
Woo! God damn.

805
01:13:55,073 --> 01:13:56,564
That's gotta hurt.

806
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:01,734
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah.

807
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:05,654
- Oh, he's all right.
- Get up, bitch.

808
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:09,104
All right, bitch.

809
01:14:12,425 --> 01:14:14,185
- What do you got now?
- Get the fuck off me!

810
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:15,884
- What do you got?
- Get off me, you mother fucker.

811
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:17,744
What do you got? What do you got?

812
01:14:17,805 --> 01:14:20,875
Woo, he's a wild one.
We got a wild one.

813
01:14:20,925 --> 01:14:22,965
- C'mon, Sanborn. Get him.
- That's right.

814
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:26,704
- Ride him, baby.
- Get off me.

815
01:14:26,765 --> 01:14:28,426
- C'mon, bitch.
- C'mon, guys.

816
01:14:28,475 --> 01:14:30,216
What do you got?

817
01:14:30,525 --> 01:14:31,885
Get off me.

818
01:14:32,104 --> 01:14:33,265
Hey, hey, hey.

819
01:14:44,536 --> 01:14:46,525
I'm just kidding, motherfucker.
Shit.

820
01:14:48,786 --> 01:14:50,275
You're all right, Sanborn.

821
01:14:50,521 --> 01:14:51,523
You're all right, man.

822
01:14:51,546 --> 01:14:53,746
Owen, get this guy a drink.
C'mon.

823
01:14:55,586 --> 01:14:56,996
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

824
01:14:57,046 --> 01:14:58,417
- All right, here.
- All right.

825
01:14:58,466 --> 01:15:00,287
- See you later.
- Be safe.

826
01:15:00,346 --> 01:15:03,627
All right, come on big boy.
Damn, boy, you need to get on a diet.

827
01:15:04,055 --> 01:15:06,256
He hurt his knee.
C'mon, man.

828
01:15:07,686 --> 01:15:10,676
Steps. C'mon.

829
01:15:12,356 --> 01:15:14,426
Step. Step.

830
01:15:19,657 --> 01:15:24,358
All right, lay down. Lay down.
All right. Get some rest.

831
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:29,987
Hey, James, you think I got
what it takes to put on the suit?

832
01:15:32,537 --> 01:15:33,648
Hell, no.

833
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:36,828
Night, boy.

834
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:31,980
Oh!

835
01:16:36,189 --> 01:16:37,930
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.

836
01:16:38,649 --> 01:16:42,939
Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death
of sitting behind a desk all the time.

837
01:16:45,909 --> 01:16:47,939
It'd be a privilege.
Hop in, Colonel.

838
01:16:52,371 --> 01:16:53,480
Hey, Doc.

839
01:16:54,371 --> 01:16:56,029
<i>Not to insult your intelligence, sir.</i>

840
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:59,240
But if the shit hits the fan,
please don't fire out the Humvee.

841
01:16:59,421 --> 01:17:02,202
The round will just bounce around
and someone might get shot.

842
01:17:02,841 --> 01:17:05,831
- I don't like getting shot.
- Understood, Sergeant.

843
01:17:18,811 --> 01:17:19,890
Oh, it's a pretty standard mission.

844
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:22,023
We're just here to pick up
some unexploded ordinance.

845
01:17:22,652 --> 01:17:25,351
Sergeant James is
gonna see what the deal is.

846
01:17:25,952 --> 01:17:28,033
And then hopefully we'll be
gone in a couple minutes.

847
01:17:28,572 --> 01:17:30,411
- We've gotta gear up.
- For what?

848
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,731
Security hasn't gone in.

849
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:33,601
Go in quiet. Radios off.

850
01:17:33,702 --> 01:17:35,613
- Roger.
- Roger that.

851
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:38,072
- Glad you came.
- Stay safe. All right.

852
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:32,359
Psst, Psst.

853
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:43,748
Clear.

854
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:45,979
Hey.

855
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:47,849
Cigarette's still smoking.

856
01:20:51,859 --> 01:20:53,048
It's all our shit.

857
01:20:56,699 --> 01:20:58,399
<i>Motherfucking goldmine.</i>

858
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:01,779
<i>Watch out for trips.</i>

859
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,081
I got something.

860
01:21:40,582 --> 01:21:41,850
I know this kid.

861
01:21:43,121 --> 01:21:45,242
His name's Beckham. He sells DVDs.

862
01:21:46,161 --> 01:21:48,030
You ever see a body bomb before, man?

863
01:21:50,792 --> 01:21:53,121
It's disgusting. Let's get outta here.

864
01:21:53,801 --> 01:21:54,802
Hold it.

865
01:21:56,221 --> 01:22:01,252
Eldridge, want you to grab all the C4 and
deck cord you can get your hands on.

866
01:22:04,393 --> 01:22:06,212
Let's get all this
ordinance outta here.

867
01:22:06,273 --> 01:22:08,302
And we're just gonna...
we're gonna blow the place.

868
01:22:09,563 --> 01:22:10,971
Roger. Just blow it.

869
01:22:19,823 --> 01:22:20,823
What are you doing?

870
01:22:22,323 --> 01:22:24,653
Yeah? Putting
the stones in to move.

871
01:22:26,243 --> 01:22:27,444
Yeah. That's really wonderful,

872
01:22:28,293 --> 01:22:29,783
but it's
a little bit unsafe today.

873
01:22:32,423 --> 01:22:33,872
Yeah, it's a little unsafe.

874
01:22:33,922 --> 01:22:35,333
So maybe... I don't know.

875
01:22:35,634 --> 01:22:38,872
I'm thinking maybe we should move?

876
01:22:39,092 --> 01:22:40,094
No?

877
01:22:56,984 --> 01:22:58,064
Fuck.

878
01:23:03,073 --> 01:23:04,154
- You all right?
- Yeah.

879
01:23:04,204 --> 01:23:05,444
- You?
- Yeah.

880
01:23:11,545 --> 01:23:13,654
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

881
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:16,125
No one in or out, okay?

882
01:23:58,676 --> 01:24:00,327
Cancel the det. Cancel the det.

883
01:24:22,578 --> 01:24:24,777
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know, man.

884
01:24:27,037 --> 01:24:28,037
I don't know.

885
01:25:56,711 --> 01:25:57,730
I'm coming out.

886
01:25:58,881 --> 01:26:00,030
<i>Roger that.</i>

887
01:26:20,612 --> 01:26:22,431
- Where are you from?
- New York.

888
01:26:22,771 --> 01:26:23,931
The Big Apple.

889
01:26:24,652 --> 01:26:26,021
Are you from Iraq?

890
01:26:26,243 --> 01:26:28,353
I love it here.
This is a beautiful place.

891
01:26:28,402 --> 01:26:30,771
But it's not too safe here, okay?

892
01:26:30,822 --> 01:26:34,483
So, I think we need,
we need to move. Please.

893
01:26:58,773 --> 01:27:00,264
You think it's that little Beckham?

894
01:27:00,564 --> 01:27:01,972
No. I don't.

895
01:27:02,524 --> 01:27:04,853
- You're positive?
- Sure.

896
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:07,814
Hey, I don't know, man.
They all look the same, right?

897
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:09,421
I know.

898
01:27:09,444 --> 01:27:12,814
- Will seemed sure. That was weird.
- Very weird.

899
01:27:15,203 --> 01:27:17,654
Please, just move.

900
01:27:17,993 --> 01:27:20,363
Move. Move.

901
01:27:20,413 --> 01:27:24,993
Move on. Move on. Thank you.

902
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:29,494
I'm sorry.

903
01:27:30,305 --> 01:27:31,664
Will's very weird.

904
01:27:32,225 --> 01:27:34,215
I mean he keeps bomb
parts under his bed.

905
01:27:34,435 --> 01:27:37,385
I'll bet you he won't keep any
of these parts under his bed.

906
01:27:39,515 --> 01:27:40,515
Bye-bye.

907
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:44,765
Yeah, bye-bye, Bye, Thank you.

908
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:46,795
Hey, Colonel.

909
01:27:47,501 --> 01:27:48,502
Let's go.

910
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:50,925
Hallo, thank you.

911
01:27:58,206 --> 01:27:59,576
IED!

912
01:28:01,206 --> 01:28:02,225
Cambridge!

913
01:28:07,175 --> 01:28:08,666
<i>Get back. Get down.</i>

914
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,246
<i>Stay back.</i>

915
01:28:10,296 --> 01:28:12,296
<i>Stay back, Sanborn, keep 'em back.</i>

916
01:28:12,942 --> 01:28:13,943
Is anyone hurt?

917
01:28:13,966 --> 01:28:16,586
Cambridge! Fuck!

918
01:28:17,386 --> 01:28:18,836
Where is Cambridge?

919
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:21,556
Cambridge, come out.
We gotta go.

920
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:22,676
Oh, he's dead.

921
01:28:23,567 --> 01:28:26,095
Hey, we gotta find Cambridge.
Doc!

922
01:28:26,317 --> 01:28:28,796
- Eldridge!
- Doc!

923
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:32,396
Eldridge, c'mon, man. C'mon.

924
01:28:32,447 --> 01:28:34,476
I just saw him.
He was walking right here.

925
01:28:34,537 --> 01:28:37,777
I know. He's dead.
Look, he's dead. Okay?

926
01:28:51,796 --> 01:28:53,077
It's all right, man.

927
01:28:53,136 --> 01:28:55,167
You're all right, man. You're all right.

928
01:29:18,868 --> 01:29:19,868
Hello?

929
01:29:22,037 --> 01:29:23,108
Hello?

930
01:29:24,037 --> 01:29:25,198
<i>Will?</i>

931
01:29:27,378 --> 01:29:28,380
Hello?

932
01:29:31,588 --> 01:29:33,078
<i>Hello?</i>

933
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:26,131
Hey, let me ask you a question.

934
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:29,140
What happened to the little kid
that used to work here?

935
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:32,720
Sorry, man.
English, I... no English.

936
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:36,060
No-no English.
You no speak English now.

937
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:39,311
Little kid, Beckham is his name.
He sells... He sells DVDs.

938
01:30:39,362 --> 01:30:42,110
DVD, One DVD, $5.

939
01:30:42,202 --> 01:30:43,532
Oh, Jesus Christ.

940
01:30:43,832 --> 01:30:45,362
- $5.
- Excuse me, soldier.

941
01:30:45,662 --> 01:30:46,943
You in charge of this area here?

942
01:30:46,962 --> 01:30:48,822
- What's up?
- You know this guy?

943
01:30:49,921 --> 01:30:52,122
How do we know
that he's not giving intel

944
01:30:52,292 --> 01:30:53,742
to insurgents, telling them
where to drop mortars?

945
01:30:53,962 --> 01:30:55,372
I think he's just selling DVDs.

946
01:30:55,462 --> 01:30:57,543
Well, he's a security risk.
We should get rid of him.

947
01:30:57,921 --> 01:30:59,032
What are you looking at?

948
01:30:59,091 --> 01:31:01,820
He's just selling DVDs, man.
All the merchants are cleared.

949
01:31:01,845 --> 01:31:02,527
By who?

950
01:31:02,552 --> 01:31:05,112
I couldn't do anything with him
without the say so from my CO.

951
01:31:07,643 --> 01:31:08,662
Okay, Fuck.

952
01:31:10,273 --> 01:31:11,802
Fuck.

953
01:31:47,854 --> 01:31:49,215
Does this change anything?

954
01:31:50,484 --> 01:31:51,765
You speak English now,
don't you?

955
01:31:52,734 --> 01:31:54,395
- <i>Yalla, yalla.</i> Drive.
- Okay.

956
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:18,125
- Ok.
- This is his house?

957
01:32:18,595 --> 01:32:19,864
Beckham's house?

958
01:32:28,725 --> 01:32:29,726
Wait here.

959
01:32:39,615 --> 01:32:40,617
Fuck.

960
01:33:39,627 --> 01:33:41,368
Psst, psst. Shh.

961
01:33:42,548 --> 01:33:43,707
You speak English?

962
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:45,748
English. French. Arabic.

963
01:33:45,797 --> 01:33:46,908
Good. Open your vest.

964
01:33:48,349 --> 01:33:50,167
Ah, stay there. Stay.

965
01:33:50,929 --> 01:33:52,378
Tell me what you know about Beckham.

966
01:33:52,889 --> 01:33:53,890
For whom?

967
01:33:54,059 --> 01:33:57,309
Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb.
Stay right there.

968
01:33:58,019 --> 01:34:00,099
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

969
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:03,390
But please, sit down.
I am Professor Navid.

970
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:05,048
This is my home.

971
01:34:05,658 --> 01:34:08,729
You are a guest.
Please, sit down.

972
01:34:11,329 --> 01:34:12,779
I'm a guest.

973
01:34:15,038 --> 01:34:19,198
Just... I'm looking for
the people responsible

974
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:22,369
for-for-for Beckham.

975
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:25,211
You are CIA, no?

976
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:28,840
I am very pleased to see
CIA in my home.

977
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,301
Please, sit.

978
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:40,100
How can I...

979
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:46,189
Be careful. The gun can go off.

980
01:35:43,502 --> 01:35:45,162
USA, friendly coming in.

981
01:35:45,252 --> 01:35:48,091
<i>Stop! Get the fuck down!</i>

982
01:35:48,092 --> 01:35:49,542
USA, friendly.

983
01:35:49,592 --> 01:35:52,073
<i>- On your knees!
- Get on your knees, now.</i>

984
01:35:52,132 --> 01:35:56,253
- On your knees.
- You will be shot! Don't move!

985
01:35:56,314 --> 01:35:58,012
- On your knees.
- Down, now!

986
01:35:58,063 --> 01:36:01,634
- Open your jacket!
- Opening my jacket.

987
01:36:01,694 --> 01:36:03,514
<i>Cover. Get him down.</i>

988
01:36:03,694 --> 01:36:05,055
- On the ground.
- I have a weapon.

989
01:36:05,113 --> 01:36:06,764
Don't fucking move.

990
01:36:07,193 --> 01:36:09,154
- Tower, hold cover. Searching.
- I have a weapon.

991
01:36:10,783 --> 01:36:12,274
- Gun.
- Like I said.

992
01:36:13,663 --> 01:36:14,904
Weapons clear.

993
01:36:15,244 --> 01:36:16,246
ID?

994
01:36:16,993 --> 01:36:18,265
What the fuck are you doing?

995
01:36:18,543 --> 01:36:19,904
I was at a whorehouse.

996
01:36:20,753 --> 01:36:25,614
All right, if I let you in, will
you tell me where it is exactly?

997
01:36:27,675 --> 01:36:28,676
Yeah.

998
01:36:30,715 --> 01:36:32,755
<i>James, do you copy?</i>

999
01:36:42,315 --> 01:36:43,925
<i>James do you have your ears on?</i>

1000
01:36:47,774 --> 01:36:48,775
<i>James?</i>

1001
01:36:50,694 --> 01:36:52,064
This is James. What's up?

1002
01:37:07,876 --> 01:37:09,996
- Hey.
- What's up, man?

1003
01:37:13,006 --> 01:37:15,256
Look, we have a tank explosion
in the Green Zone.

1004
01:37:15,306 --> 01:37:16,966
We have to post-blast assessment,

1005
01:37:17,055 --> 01:37:18,426
see if it was a suicide bomber.

1006
01:37:18,516 --> 01:37:20,046
And if so, how the fuck did he do it?

1007
01:37:21,145 --> 01:37:22,146
Okay.

1008
01:37:22,686 --> 01:37:23,927
Where'd you say you were again?

1009
01:37:24,567 --> 01:37:25,756
I didn't, Sergeant.
Let's go.

1010
01:37:28,396 --> 01:37:29,936
What happened to your head, James?

1011
01:37:37,537 --> 01:37:38,606
Hey, you ready?

1012
01:37:39,457 --> 01:37:40,697
Game face, buddy. Let's go.

1013
01:37:46,547 --> 01:37:48,497
- You ready?
- Let's do this.

1014
01:37:48,547 --> 01:37:50,457
Rock and roll. Moving out.

1015
01:38:04,148 --> 01:38:06,057
USA friendlies coming through.

1016
01:38:26,788 --> 01:38:28,329
Make room, guys. Make room.

1017
01:38:40,969 --> 01:38:42,918
Hey, Sanborn.

1018
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:44,770
Oh, shit!

1019
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:12,911
- An oil tanker?
- Yep.

1020
01:39:16,511 --> 01:39:17,921
That's a pretty long flight, huh?

1021
01:41:25,725 --> 01:41:27,586
This is the edge of the blast radius.

1022
01:41:33,685 --> 01:41:35,055
Jesus.

1023
01:41:36,237 --> 01:41:37,506
So, where's our triggerman?

1024
01:41:37,815 --> 01:41:39,436
Burnt up in the flames, man.

1025
01:41:39,985 --> 01:41:41,436
Suicide bomber.

1026
01:41:41,945 --> 01:41:44,105
We're never going
to find a body in that shit.

1027
01:41:44,327 --> 01:41:45,735
What if there was no body?

1028
01:41:47,537 --> 01:41:48,945
What if it was a remote det?

1029
01:41:53,796 --> 01:41:56,185
A really good bad guy
hides out in the dark, right?

1030
01:41:59,377 --> 01:42:03,067
Right here.
Perfect vantage point.

1031
01:42:03,676 --> 01:42:07,796
Outside the blast radius to sit back
and watch us clean up their mess.

1032
01:42:10,597 --> 01:42:12,337
- Want to go out there?
- Yes, I do.

1033
01:42:14,896 --> 01:42:18,887
- I could stand to get in a little trouble.
- No, man! This is bullshit.

1034
01:42:19,186 --> 01:42:23,728
You got three infantry platoons behind
you whose job it is to go Haji huntin'.

1035
01:42:23,778 --> 01:42:24,987
That ain't our fuckin' job.

1036
01:42:24,988 --> 01:42:27,778
You don't say no to me, Sanborn.
I say no to you.

1037
01:42:27,828 --> 01:42:29,938
You know there are guys
watching us right now.

1038
01:42:29,997 --> 01:42:33,279
They're laughing at this.
Okay, I'm not okay with that.

1039
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:36,948
Now, turn off your goddamned
torch 'cause we're going.

1040
01:43:46,451 --> 01:43:48,271
Now we know where their
oil tanker came from.

1041
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:49,940
<i>No shit. Same kind.</i>

1042
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,610
- We're close.
- Yeah.

1043
01:43:51,911 --> 01:43:53,730
These alleyways
are probably set up on a grid.

1044
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:56,150
We're going to need
to split up, flush 'em out.

1045
01:43:56,961 --> 01:43:59,412
Sanborn, you take one.
Eldridge, take two.

1046
01:43:59,462 --> 01:44:02,461
I got three.
Rally point at your intersection.

1047
01:44:02,462 --> 01:44:04,024
- Ready, move.
- Wait, rally point when?

1048
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:06,091
Fuck.

1049
01:44:32,573 --> 01:44:33,943
<i>Ipsura, ipsura!</i>
Go, go!

1050
01:45:19,704 --> 01:45:21,574
Shit, Ahh.

1051
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:29,021
Shit.

1052
01:45:29,045 --> 01:45:31,295
- You got contact?
- Who was it? What's going on?

1053
01:45:31,345 --> 01:45:33,125
- What do you got?
- It's Eldridge.

1054
01:45:34,675 --> 01:45:35,755
Go, go.

1055
01:45:35,805 --> 01:45:37,256
Man down. Man down.

1056
01:45:38,555 --> 01:45:39,965
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1057
01:45:40,265 --> 01:45:43,055
- Negative, negative. It's not him.
- He's gone.

1058
01:45:43,525 --> 01:45:44,765
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

1059
01:45:44,814 --> 01:45:46,725
Tankers and troops are that way.

1060
01:45:47,024 --> 01:45:48,515
- Let's go this way.
- Fuck.

1061
01:46:11,466 --> 01:46:13,667
Use your torch. On three.

1062
01:46:15,845 --> 01:46:16,846
Ready?

1063
01:46:17,556 --> 01:46:19,926
One, two, three.

1064
01:46:22,266 --> 01:46:23,457
- Fuck!
- Shit.

1065
01:46:29,278 --> 01:46:30,936
Softly, softly, softly.

1066
01:46:42,287 --> 01:46:43,288
On three.

1067
01:46:43,537 --> 01:46:45,368
One. Two. Three.

1068
01:46:49,667 --> 01:46:51,408
Now. Go, go, go!

1069
01:46:54,087 --> 01:46:57,056
- Eldridge, you okay?
- Fuck, dude. I'm hit.

1070
01:46:57,057 --> 01:46:58,957
Hit him in the fuckin' leg.

1071
01:46:59,018 --> 01:47:00,967
Come on.

1072
01:47:01,018 --> 01:47:04,469
- Am I dead? Am I dead?
- No. You're fine, man.

1073
01:47:04,978 --> 01:47:06,719
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1074
01:47:08,359 --> 01:47:10,177
I'm going to put some
pressure down, come on.

1075
01:47:10,609 --> 01:47:11,719
You're all right.

1076
01:47:12,899 --> 01:47:15,097
Look at me, look at me.
You all right.

1077
01:47:15,448 --> 01:47:19,689
All right, buddy. You ready to get up?
On three, ready? One, two, three.

1078
01:48:42,372 --> 01:48:45,572
Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?

1079
01:48:45,792 --> 01:48:47,742
Wanna buy some DVDs?
Wanna play some soccer?

1080
01:48:49,292 --> 01:48:50,293
What's up?

1081
01:48:51,002 --> 01:48:52,243
Come on, man.
Wanna play some...

1082
01:49:09,932 --> 01:49:11,882
Aww, fuck.

1083
01:49:17,363 --> 01:49:18,364
How you doing, buddy?

1084
01:49:19,033 --> 01:49:20,604
Doc says you're going to be okay.

1085
01:49:20,943 --> 01:49:23,434
My fucking femur is shattered
in nine places.

1086
01:49:24,663 --> 01:49:27,694
He said I'll be walking in six months
if I'm fucking lucky.

1087
01:49:27,743 --> 01:49:30,073
- Six months ain't bad, huh?
- It's not bad?

1088
01:49:30,413 --> 01:49:32,193
Fuckin' sucks, man.

1089
01:49:32,253 --> 01:49:33,993
- Ah, ah!
- Take it easy.

1090
01:49:36,083 --> 01:49:38,873
You see that? You fuckin' see that?

1091
01:49:39,634 --> 01:49:42,454
That's what happens when
you shoot someone, you motherfucker.

1092
01:49:43,014 --> 01:49:44,204
Sorry.

1093
01:49:44,804 --> 01:49:46,884
- Sorry, Owen.
- Fuck you, Will.

1094
01:49:47,305 --> 01:49:48,635
Really. Fuck you.

1095
01:49:49,685 --> 01:49:53,454
Thanks for saving my life,
but we didn't have to go out

1096
01:49:53,604 --> 01:49:56,435
looking for trouble to get
your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck.

1097
01:49:58,524 --> 01:50:00,314
Hey, take care of yourself, Owen.

1098
01:50:00,364 --> 01:50:01,814
Come home safe, man.

1099
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,935
- See you on the other side, man.
- All right.

1100
01:50:05,114 --> 01:50:07,064
Let's get out of this fucking desert!

1101
01:50:13,246 --> 01:50:14,275
Don't move.

1102
01:50:14,336 --> 01:50:17,416
If you keep
walking we will shoot you.

1103
01:50:17,466 --> 01:50:19,164
Move him back.

1104
01:50:20,175 --> 01:50:21,706
Keep that translator back.

1105
01:50:21,756 --> 01:50:23,746
- But the bomb was forced on him.
- Get him back!

1106
01:50:23,805 --> 01:50:25,836
Don't move! Stay still.

1107
01:50:27,886 --> 01:50:32,006
If you keep walking
we will shoot you!

1108
01:50:32,145 --> 01:50:33,676
<i>Get that translator back, now.</i>

1109
01:50:37,645 --> 01:50:41,646
- He's not a bad man.
- Clear! Give him room. Give him room.

1110
01:50:49,037 --> 01:50:50,606
Hey, what do you got?

1111
01:50:50,667 --> 01:50:52,157
He came walking up to our checkpoint.

1112
01:50:52,207 --> 01:50:54,987
Said he had a bomb strapped to him.
But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off.

1113
01:50:55,046 --> 01:50:56,987
Then he starts begging us
to take it off of him.

1114
01:50:57,337 --> 01:50:58,907
Help this man.
He's not a bad man.

1115
01:50:58,966 --> 01:51:01,577
He's not a bad man? He got
a bomb strapped to him.

1116
01:51:02,467 --> 01:51:04,426
This is a joke. He's trying
to pull us closer.

1117
01:51:04,427 --> 01:51:05,697
Yeah. I got it, I got it.

1118
01:51:06,006 --> 01:51:10,167
All right. Look...
Tell him to open his shirt slowly

1119
01:51:10,688 --> 01:51:12,757
and see what's inside.

1120
01:51:16,146 --> 01:51:18,307
Slowly, slowly.

1121
01:51:29,078 --> 01:51:30,439
Jesus.

1122
01:51:31,787 --> 01:51:34,108
All right, Sergeant,
I need a 75-meter perimeter.

1123
01:51:34,167 --> 01:51:36,452
- Get these guys back.
- You heard what he said. Get back.

1124
01:51:38,127 --> 01:51:40,798
You tell him to get on his knees
and touch the sky, okay?

1125
01:51:41,838 --> 01:51:42,840
Slowly.

1126
01:51:43,798 --> 01:51:44,800
Get down.

1127
01:51:49,099 --> 01:51:50,838
Okay, I need your radio.

1128
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:53,168
- Can't we just shoot him?
- No.

1129
01:51:53,229 --> 01:51:55,220
He's a a family man.
He's not a bad man.

1130
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:57,048
He's asking for help, only help.

1131
01:51:57,099 --> 01:52:01,600
Yeah, all right, You don't want
to die, get back! I got it.

1132
01:52:05,109 --> 01:52:07,729
Listen, I know
we've had our differences.

1133
01:52:07,949 --> 01:52:12,029
Eldridge, it happened, all right.
It's water under the bridge.

1134
01:52:13,579 --> 01:52:15,449
This is suicide, man.

1135
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:18,842
That's why they call it
a suicide bomb, right?

1136
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:23,979
Let's do this, Come on.

1137
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:26,119
<i>He says the bomb may
have a timer, please hurry.</i>

1138
01:52:27,261 --> 01:52:29,000
- You alright in there?
- Yep.

1139
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:35,721
Go get 'em.

1140
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:38,591
- Let's do it. Watch for snipers, ha?
- Yeah.

1141
01:52:49,362 --> 01:52:51,311
Get your hands up.

1142
01:52:54,492 --> 01:52:55,771
<i>He says he has a family.</i>

1143
01:52:57,372 --> 01:52:58,481
<i>Please help him.</i>

1144
01:53:04,591 --> 01:53:06,542
Now, listen.

1145
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:09,662
Look, It'd be a lot easier for me
to disarm this

1146
01:53:09,721 --> 01:53:11,502
if I just shoot you, Do you understand?

1147
01:53:16,181 --> 01:53:17,422
What's he saying?

1148
01:53:17,472 --> 01:53:21,332
He says: "I don't wish to die, I have a
family... Please take this off me."

1149
01:53:22,233 --> 01:53:26,643
Tell him to put his hands behind his
head or I'll be very happy to shoot him.

1150
01:53:32,703 --> 01:53:34,153
Look, that's not what I said.

1151
01:53:34,203 --> 01:53:37,613
Tell him to put his hands behind
his head or I will shoot him.

1152
01:53:40,502 --> 01:53:41,503
Listen.

1153
01:53:43,922 --> 01:53:44,923
Listen, listen.

1154
01:53:46,344 --> 01:53:49,993
You understand?

1155
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,385
Okay.

1156
01:53:56,854 --> 01:53:57,873
What do you got here?

1157
01:53:59,564 --> 01:54:00,923
<i>He has four children.</i>

1158
01:54:06,314 --> 01:54:07,425
Shit.

1159
01:54:12,194 --> 01:54:15,663
Sanborn, we got a timer,
and we got a lot of wires, man.

1160
01:54:15,664 --> 01:54:17,774
I'm going to need
a little help on this.

1161
01:54:17,824 --> 01:54:19,314
Roger that. Tell me what you need.

1162
01:54:19,875 --> 01:54:21,064
Bolt cutters.

1163
01:54:21,204 --> 01:54:23,685
You gotta get down here
in two minutes or we're all fucked.

1164
01:54:23,755 --> 01:54:25,318
Roger that.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1165
01:54:29,296 --> 01:54:31,376
<i>He says: "please, I have a family."</i>

1166
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:35,032
Shh.

1167
01:54:35,055 --> 01:54:39,135
I know, It's okay.
You're all right. You're all right.

1168
01:54:43,605 --> 01:54:44,796
<i>Please, don't leave me.</i>

1169
01:54:50,315 --> 01:54:51,685
You weren't fuckin' kidding.

1170
01:54:52,155 --> 01:54:54,636
Nope. What's this made out of?

1171
01:55:00,496 --> 01:55:01,497
Oh, man.

1172
01:55:01,576 --> 01:55:03,327
This case is hardened steel.

1173
01:55:04,996 --> 01:55:06,247
Shit.

1174
01:55:06,296 --> 01:55:08,119
- What's our time?
- We got two minutes.

1175
01:55:08,145 --> 01:55:08,600
Shit.

1176
01:55:08,966 --> 01:55:11,417
We're going need a torch
to get this off.

1177
01:55:11,466 --> 01:55:13,457
Well, we don't have one of those in
the fucking truck, man.

1178
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:14,166
He's dead, man.

1179
01:55:14,216 --> 01:55:15,487
Hold on, man. Let me think.
Just let me think.

1180
01:55:15,806 --> 01:55:18,195
We're going to handle this.
It's okay. We got this.

1181
01:55:18,976 --> 01:55:20,546
Shh, okay.

1182
01:55:21,646 --> 01:55:23,009
Now listen, you're gonna get back.

1183
01:55:27,478 --> 01:55:29,877
It's just, we don't
got enough time, Sanborn.

1184
01:55:30,146 --> 01:55:32,438
I just gotta...
I gotta get these bolts off.

1185
01:55:33,238 --> 01:55:36,478
No. We got a minute and a half, man.
We gotta get out of here.

1186
01:55:36,528 --> 01:55:39,318
- I'll handle this, Just go.
- Come on, man.

1187
01:55:39,368 --> 01:55:41,207
Look, I'm right behind ya. Just go.

1188
01:55:41,207 --> 01:55:42,948
Fuck him! Come on. Let's go.

1189
01:55:42,997 --> 01:55:45,778
- Sanborn, I got the suit. Just go!
- James!

1190
01:55:45,837 --> 01:55:49,658
Sanborn, you have 45 seconds.
You have 45 seconds, Sanborn, leave.

1191
01:55:50,007 --> 01:55:51,658
You're fucking dead, man. Dead.

1192
01:55:51,717 --> 01:55:53,747
Go!

1193
01:55:53,797 --> 01:55:56,279
- Everybody get back!
- Go, go!

1194
01:56:01,847 --> 01:56:03,037
We got one.

1195
01:56:03,978 --> 01:56:06,259
Go, get back.

1196
01:56:08,979 --> 01:56:13,889
I can't. There's too many locks.
There's too many, I can't do it.

1197
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:16,189
I can't get it off. I'm sorry. Okay?

1198
01:56:16,488 --> 01:56:17,859
You understand? I'm sorry.

1199
01:56:18,868 --> 01:56:21,609
I'm sorry. You hear me? I'm sorry.

1200
01:56:21,658 --> 01:56:23,819
- Get down now!
- I can help him.

1201
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:29,868
Everybody, stay down! Stay down!

1202
01:56:52,979 --> 01:56:53,980
James!

1203
01:56:54,189 --> 01:56:56,270
Everybody up and out!
James!

1204
01:57:42,952 --> 01:57:43,953
You all right?

1205
01:57:47,493 --> 01:57:48,493
Aw, man.

1206
01:57:51,502 --> 01:57:53,162
I fuckin' hate this place.

1207
01:57:56,091 --> 01:57:57,332
Here, man. Have a hit.

1208
01:58:11,813 --> 01:58:13,802
I'm not ready to die, James.

1209
01:58:16,234 --> 01:58:17,954
Well, you're not going
to die out here, bro.

1210
01:58:19,533 --> 01:58:21,103
Another two inches.

1211
01:58:24,113 --> 01:58:26,783
Shrapnel zings by, slices my throat.

1212
01:58:28,453 --> 01:58:30,904
I bleed out like a pig in the sand.

1213
01:58:33,503 --> 01:58:35,284
Nobody will give a shit.

1214
01:58:38,215 --> 01:58:41,494
I mean, my parents will care,
but they don't count, man. Who else?

1215
01:58:49,305 --> 01:58:50,845
I don't even have a son.

1216
01:58:57,774 --> 01:59:00,057
Well, you're going to have
plenty of time for that, amigo.

1217
01:59:00,774 --> 01:59:02,645
- Naw, man.
- You know?

1218
01:59:04,654 --> 01:59:05,734
I'm done.

1219
01:59:11,286 --> 01:59:12,565
<i>I want a son.</i>

1220
01:59:16,716 --> 01:59:18,496
I want a little boy, Will.

1221
01:59:25,466 --> 01:59:27,666
I mean, how do you
do it, you know?

1222
01:59:29,516 --> 01:59:30,886
Take the risk?

1223
01:59:38,737 --> 01:59:40,886
I don't know, I just...

1224
01:59:43,657 --> 01:59:44,898
I guess I don't think about it.

1225
01:59:58,587 --> 02:00:00,867
<i>But you realize every time you suit up,</i>

1226
02:00:02,257 --> 02:00:03,707
every time we go out

1227
02:00:04,886 --> 02:00:07,337
it's life or death.
You roll the dice

1228
02:00:09,677 --> 02:00:10,837
and you deal with it.

1229
02:00:13,387 --> 02:00:14,967
You recognize that, don't you?

1230
02:00:20,778 --> 02:00:21,847
Yeah, yeah.

1231
02:00:32,078 --> 02:00:33,319
Yeah, I do.

1232
02:00:35,208 --> 02:00:36,658
But I don't know why.

1233
02:00:38,838 --> 02:00:39,939
Yeah.

1234
02:00:49,639 --> 02:00:53,918
I don't know, JT.
You know why I am the way I am?

1235
02:00:59,729 --> 02:01:00,810
Naw, I don't.

1236
02:02:03,252 --> 02:02:06,832
- Wow. You did some shopping.
- Yeah.

1237
02:02:07,591 --> 02:02:09,292
I got some soda.
We done?

1238
02:02:11,011 --> 02:02:13,695
You want to go get us some cereal
and I'll meet you at the checkout?

1239
02:02:14,552 --> 02:02:16,342
Okay. Cereal.

1240
02:02:20,813 --> 02:02:21,814
Where?

1241
02:03:21,414 --> 02:03:24,864
Some guy drove his truck to
the middle of an Iraqi market,

1242
02:03:25,715 --> 02:03:27,704
starts passing out free candies.

1243
02:03:27,755 --> 02:03:30,235
All the kids coming running up,
the families stuff.

1244
02:03:32,466 --> 02:03:33,576
He detonates.

1245
02:03:36,386 --> 02:03:37,756
They're saying 59 are dead.

1246
02:03:48,315 --> 02:03:50,015
You know they need more bomb techs.

1247
02:03:54,195 --> 02:03:55,519
You want to chop those up for me?

1248
02:03:57,367 --> 02:03:59,105
Boing, boing, boing.

1249
02:04:06,956 --> 02:04:07,957
Yeah.

1250
02:04:10,046 --> 02:04:11,747
You love playing with that.

1251
02:04:12,756 --> 02:04:14,957
You love playing with all
your stuffed animals.

1252
02:04:16,096 --> 02:04:21,676
You love your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas.

1253
02:04:21,886 --> 02:04:24,676
You love everything, don't you? Yeah.

1254
02:04:26,318 --> 02:04:27,587
You know what, buddy?

1255
02:04:28,688 --> 02:04:29,957
Once you get older,

1256
02:04:30,896 --> 02:04:36,238
some of the things that you love
might not seem so special anymore.

1257
02:04:37,077 --> 02:04:38,818
Like your Jack in the Box.

1258
02:04:41,908 --> 02:04:46,698
Maybe you realize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animal

1259
02:04:48,957 --> 02:04:53,078
and then you forget
the few things you really love.

1260
02:04:56,429 --> 02:04:59,957
And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's only one or two things.

1261
02:05:08,559 --> 02:05:10,429
With me I think it's one.

1262
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:49,470
- Welcome to Delta Company.
- Sergeant.
