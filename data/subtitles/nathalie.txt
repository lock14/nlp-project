1
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,675
Where shall we put the presents?
- In Bernard's office.

2
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,956
Everything okey? D'you have a glass?

3
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,755
François.
- Catherine !

4
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,599
This is Ingrid.
- Good evening.

5
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,915
And Bernard?
- He'll be right here.

6
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,838
Doesn't he suspect anything?
- No.

7
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,316
I wouldn't want something like that.
Not that somebody would do that.

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,956
Its nice here.
- Would you like to drink something?

9
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,994
Yes, I'll serve myself.
D'you want champagne?

10
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,638
Where did you meet her?
- As usual.

11
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,354
She is sexy.
- Yes.

12
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,393
You look amazing.
Why are you laughing?

13
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,512
Because you always say that.
- You'd miss it.

14
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,918
Mum, for you.

15
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,435
Wait, I don't understand you.

16
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,790
Ssh, he's on his way. Not too loud.

17
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,873
Wait, I'll go upstairs.

18
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,076
Yes, now I hear you better.

19
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,953
Where are you?

20
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,788
But...

21
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,199
Aha.

22
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,317
Can't you take the next one?

23
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,354
Fine.

24
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,559
Me too.

25
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,078
Well, the surprise is that Bernard
missed his flight in Zurich.

26
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,998
Pity for him, but we're starting.

27
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,231
We all come, and...
- We could fly to Zurich.

28
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,435
You're home.

29
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,399
Sorry, you should have said something.
- That wouldn't be a surprise anymore.

30
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,398
Yes, but...I forgot about it myself.

31
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,917
I saw the presents.
It is very kind.

32
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,749
Where can I make up for it with a dinner?
- Not tonight.


33
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,157
Right, yes. Thierry and his fiance.

34
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,993
I'm really sorry.
It must have been dreadful.

35
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,276
We didn't need you to drink.

36
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,950
You have some time still.
- I'm going to get myself a coffee. Til tonight.

37
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,955
<i>You have three new messages.</i>
<i>Yesterday 17.47.</i>

38
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,993
<i>M. Barthélémy, with Richard Dumont.</i>
<i>Can you call back?</i>

39
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,792
<i>Its urgent.</i>

40
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,159
<i>Today at 09.00.</i>

41
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,952
<i>Thanks for last night.</i>

42
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,754
<i>l'm at the airport.</i>
<i>My flight is in an hour.</i>

43
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,714
<i>l'll miss you.</i>
<i>We had a good fuck.</i>

44
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,759
<i>Kisses.</i>

45
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,832
What can I say?
That was the boring side.

46
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,157
You can't really judge in one hour.

47
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,920
What did you tell Thierry?
- What he wanted to hear.

48
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,913
He can't care anyway.
- He believed you.

49
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,519
Even better.

50
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,156
I've got a headache.

51
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,553
Taken an aspirine...

52
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,479
Did you find your mobile?
- Yes.

53
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,038
There were messages on it.

54
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,876
I didn't listen to them
- I didn't delete them.

55
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,030
A woman saying goodbye.

56
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,950
Were you with her last night?

57
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,389
No.

58
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,918
Listen to your message.
Its clear.

59
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,716
Do you listen to my messages?

60
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,717
Did you spend the night with her?

61
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,594
No.

62
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,952
Where were you then?

63
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,831
Who is she?
- Its a girl...

64
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,913
A crazy case. Nobody.

65
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,912
Has it been going on for long?

66
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,152
It was of no importance.
- Of no importance? Come on!

67
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,510
Catherine, its not worth it.
- Ok, you don't have to say anything.

68
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,310
I thought you placed yourself higher.
- What?

69
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,148
Does it happen so often then?
- Of course not.

70
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,913
Not often.

71
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,159
But once in a while, yes.
Its ridiculous, thats why I'm not telling you.

72
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,237
Is that the reason?

73
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,076
I understand you're hurt, but...

74
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,158
If you'd know how I'd feel...
- I don't care!

75
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,236
You're right.
Maybe we talk too little.

76
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,714
But you don't say anything about yourself either.

77
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,718
We've grown away from each other.

78
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,875
You've grown away.
Don't talk about me.

79
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,956
Its true. We don't make love anymore
don't touch anymore...

80
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,908
I don't know if its because of me or you.

81
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,831
Maybe its unavoidable...

82
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,159
And one day it dies away.

83
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,631
I hope not.

84
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,430
How is it going then with those women?

85
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,477
What do you like?
Actually I don't know anything about it.

86
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,353
I'm not going to tell you how I...
- Yes you are.

87
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,351
Then we'll share something.

88
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,756
What do you mean?

89
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,190
I can leave you immediately too.

90
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,914
Catherine.

91
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,709
Are you looking for somebody?
- No.

92
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,310
Can I do something for you?
This is a private club.

93
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,115
A whiskey please.
- Sit over there.


94
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,836
The whiskey, with Perrier?
- No, pure.

95
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,879
You always get things in your mind.

96
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,479
You're so irritating.

97
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,878
Who did you get that from?
- From my sweetheart.

98
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,512
You're in a hurry aren't you?

99
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,355
A glass of water, I'm hot.

100
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,358
Its quiet tonight.

101
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,314
Yea, it will get started.

102
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,354
D'you want ice?
- Yes please.

103
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,998
Its fine like that.

104
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,472
There aren't any people yet.

105
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,076
When does it usually start?
- Eleven, half-twelve.

106
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,557
D'you offer me something to drink?

107
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,633
If you want.

108
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,558
Everthing fine? Not too strange?
- Its okey.

109
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,472
Which perfume d'you have on?

110
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,839
Jicky.
- It suits you.

111
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,077
I constantly change.

112
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,071
Did you just come in by coincidence?

113
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,238
No, not really.

114
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,354
I work in the neighbourhood.
- You seldom see women here.

115
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,796
Women like you I mean.

116
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,999
Probably.

117
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,713
Couples yes, but a woman alone...

118
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,871
Would you prefer that I leave you alone?
- No.

119
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,073
Maybe...

120
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,072
you can help me.
- Why not.

121
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,273
Tell me.

122
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,628
Some girls don't go with women.
l do.

123
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,633
Its not for me.
- For who then?

124
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,278
I think...

125
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,910
that my husband would like you...

126
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,718
You choose in his place?

127
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,597
Can't he come himself?
- No.

128
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,319
Why not?

129
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,314
Is he handicapped?

130
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,148
D'you want a threesome?

131
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,758
No, he knows nothing about this.

132
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,113
Didn't you recognise me?
- I wasn't sure.

133
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,878
A coffee please.

134
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,712
His name is Bernard.

135
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,833
<i>He often goes for a coffe</i>
<i>before work.</i>

136
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,396
<i>How shall I describe him?</i>

137
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,871
<i>He wears a blue scarf,</i>
<i>a dark jacket.</i>

138
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,877
<i>A couple of newspapers...</i>

139
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,279
<i>He is big, brown hair, strong.</i>
<i>You could call him attractive.</i>

140
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,039
<i>And if he asks what I do?</i>
<i>- You learn languages to become a translator.</i>

141
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,432
Excuse me, d'you have a light?

142
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,268
I was asking for a light.

143
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,836
And I sat down again.

144
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,913
He pretended as if he was reading.

145
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,635
But then he stood up,
and approached me.

146
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,917
What did he say?

147
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,873
The usual.
If I cam there often, to my work...

148
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,150
I told him about the language courses.

149
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,478
He said he had to go to an appointment
and asked for my name.

150
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,028
I didn't answer.

151
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,028
We have to think of a name.
I don't know if Marlène

152
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,356
is your real name.

153
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,955
We'll call you...

154
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,869
Nathalie...Yes, Nathalie.

155
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,669
What does your husband like?
What gives him pleasure?

156
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,270
He has his own wishes.

157
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,834
Its always free between us...
been classic.

158
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,349
Maybe he likes to be hugged.

159
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,588
How did he look at you?

160
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,231
He fell fast.

161
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,398
You chose well.

162
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,069
Shall I pay you now?
- Yes.

163
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,752
You can check.

164
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,832
No, its fine.

165
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,034
How are you getting home, Yolaine?
- With a taxi.

166
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,231
No, I'll give you a lift.

167
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,591
This dinner has to unify
our loneliness we both have.

168
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,555
But it doesn't subject you to anything
of course. Come.

169
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,430
See you, Yolaine.
See you, François.

170
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,757
François had a lot to tell you.

171
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,438
I asked about his love life.
- That must have been something.

172
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,439
He's going for the 'adventure'
Why not?

173
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,189
He's not going further.
He pays.

174
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,316
He is scared and runs away.
He's scared of a real relationship.

175
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,750
And you?
Do you sometimes sleep with a prostitute?

176
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,678
Why d'you ask that?

177
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,749
You can say if you like.
- No, thats nothing for me.

178
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,072
Why?

179
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,472
I find it disgusting.

180
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,679
Have you had a good day?
- Um, no.

181
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,112
I had an important appointment
and it was terrible.

182
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,916
I didn't like the others thoughts
so was screwing around.

183
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,838
As a result: it ended.

184
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,589
Gryner was perplexed.

185
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,719
And you?

186
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,712
I was finished early.
I went to buy shoes. Quite expensive.

187
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,874
Are you still reading?
- No.

188
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,672
Mum?

189
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,238
Aren't you sleeping?
- Of course not.

190
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,718
Then maybe you should get up.
- Getting up or not, what difference does it make?

191
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,596
No, please.
- Its midday and the sun is shining.

192
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,918
You can ask Nora to clean up.
- Absolutely not. She steals stuff.

193
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,998
What?
- Towels, cutlery...

194
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,830
But I have to keep quiet. You should
fire here since you're paying her.

195
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,314
How evil that person is.
Disgraceful. !

196
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,833
Your husband called me.
Very charming.

197
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,919
We asked ourselves why we never saw each other.
- You never want to leave the house.

198
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,270
Or you obstruct it.

199
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,350
He's busy, he's often travelling.

200
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,792
He's quite funny though.
He got me laughing after two sentences.

201
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,788
You're lucky. Such a cute guy.
- Yea, he can definitely show himself.

202
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,069
You never talk about it.

203
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,076
Maybe you find it normal, but...
- He's been cheating on me for years.

204
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,390
Yea, that sucks. But its not unusual.

205
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,995
Is it tasty?
- Yes very nice.

206
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,312
Hello.

207
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,917
D'you want to drink something?
- Coke.

208
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,917
A coke please.

209
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,755
Everything alright?
- Yes. We saw each other again.

210
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,875
He was sitting in the same place.
With his coffee and newspapers.

211
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,030
He had to go off to work
and gave me a date before lunch.

212
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,631
He paid for a drink.

213
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,798
But it was very busy.

214
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,793
So he suggested a different place.

215
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,998
We went to a hotel.
- The bar of a hotel?

216
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,231
No, to a room.

217
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,835
How so, to a room?

218
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,392
Yes, it happened automatically. He got what he wanted.

219
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,711
You went to bed with him?

220
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,233
Yes.

221
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,030
Thats not it!
Thats not what I asked for!

222
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,796
What then?
- I didn't ask you to get down on him.

223
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,470
He came down on me,
as if he hadn't fucked in 10 years.

224
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,311
You understood me wrongly.

225
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,153
It was decided.
You're a normal average girl, Nathalie.

226
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,311
After how much time does your
Nathalie go to bed?

227
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,431
I don't know what you want.

228
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,998
Sorry.

229
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,549
I made a mistake.

230
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,870
Hurry up, we'll be too late.

231
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,519
Is there something?

232
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,515
Go without me, I don't feel too well.

233
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,957
Don't do that to me now.
- I thik I'm getting a flu.

234
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,352
Are you angry?

235
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,709
Why would I be?
- People say these things...

236
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,791
which they don't want to say.

237
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,590
D'you want an aspiririne?
- I already took one.

238
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,032
I'll be back early.

239
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,438
Good night. D'you want to drink something?
- A whiskey please.

240
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,509
I have to go now, but I'll be back.

241
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,030
What d'you want?
- Sorry about this morning.

242
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,074
Its ok.

243
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,078
You didn't say it.
- What?

244
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,592
The hotel, the room, how it went.
- Sorry, I don't have time.

245
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,438
I paid you.

246
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,879
Come.

247
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,157
We'll change clothes here.

248
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,518
Lets think...

249
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,118
It was a nice room.
With red colours..

250
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,313
At first there was no hesitation...
maybe because it went so fast.

251
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,109
We took something from the minibar.

252
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,958
I said nothing.

253
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,712
He neither. But I saw from his look
that he really wanted me.

254
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,311
He looked at my breasts.
I stretched a little.

255
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,638
He understood that I wanted him to have his way with me.

256
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,114
I unbuttoned my blouse
and styled my hair

257
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,914
as if I didn't know
my blouse would fall open.

258
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,992
He came to me.
I felt his breathing.

259
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,794
I think he was already very excited.

260
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,470
Then he grabbed me by the neck

261
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,470
and asked me to lie down on the bed
naked with my eyes closed.

262
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,158
He turned off the lights,

263
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,955
except in the bathroom.

264
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,236
Then he took off his clothes.

265
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,310
I didn't see him,
but I felt his eyes cast on me.

266
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,996
He lay down on me.

267
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,589
I felt his mouth in my neck,

268
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,711
his tongue on my breasts.

269
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,878
And then here.

270
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,393
Shall I continue?

271
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,635
He wanted to take my immediately,
but I found that too fast.

272
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,391
I stood up and took another glass.
I was thirsty.

273
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,198
He came behind me.

274
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,875
He stood against my back.

275
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,555
I started to move my thighs.

276
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,231
He took his cock in his hand
and touched me all over.

277
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,911
He asked if I liked it.

278
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,355
He wanted to hear me say it.

279
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,232
Then I gave him a condom

280
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,877
and he came inside me.

281
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,598
He barely moved, as if he was scared
to cum too soon.

282
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,472
Suddently he pulled himself out

283
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,390
and took me to the bed.

284
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,154
There I slowly jerked him off,
carefully.

285
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,509
I didn't want him to cum immediately.

286
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,471
Then I went on top.

287
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,640
I thrust my head backwards.

288
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,829
Often men don't want to be stared at.
They concentrate on what excites them.

289
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,631
How long did it last?

290
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,079
I don't remember. Quite long.

291
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,355
When he came to orgasm, he supressed his scream.
I think he enjoyed it.

292
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,353
And you? How did you feel?

293
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,910
It did excite me some how
that he didn't know you were behind all this.

294
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,958
But for the rest nothing.
When I'm with a customer, I don't feel anything.

295
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,951
Did he notice it?

296
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,468
I pretend. Thats my job.

297
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,674
Now I must leave.

298
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,869
Hi Alice.
- Hi madam.

299
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,514
Everything alright?
- Yes thank you.

300
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,713
Hi madam.

301
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,999
Come along.

302
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,632
Was it here the first time also?

303
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,640
With me its not alright, and with you...

304
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,070
He was too late.

305
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,957
He hadn't had lunch.

306
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,476
Did he order that?

307
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,191
He doesn't like Vouvray.
- I do.

308
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,152
D'you want some?

309
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,675
Its my glass.
- Thank you.

310
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,518
Tasty no?

311
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,076
Did it happen before?
- Before and after.

312
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,432
Sit down.

313
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,159
This time he undressed me.
But not completely.

314
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,831
I cam from the other side of the room

315
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,508
slowly moving towards him
whilst I gave him a tight look.

316
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,434
I stroked my nipples

317
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,391
He came closer.

318
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,399
Then he started licking them
and bit them softly.

319
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,072
He then placed his fingers in my mouth.

320
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,398
He has nice hands,
and a nice skin.

321
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,393
You think so?
- Yes. Its a soft skin.

322
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,918
I took his hand and brought it
between my thighs.

323
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,078
He went inside my underwear
and pushed his fingers inside.

324
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,875
It was quite brutal, but expert-like.

325
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,115
I closed my legs.
He liked me giving resistance.

326
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,829
He penetrated me.

327
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,153
It lasted a long time.
And then he came to orgasm.

328
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,754
This time without supressing a scream.

329
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,398
He didn't want me to leave.

330
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,869
Didn't he go back to the office?
- Not immediately.

331
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,154
He was tired and fell asleep.

332
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,352
I waited til he breathed normally again.

333
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,195
I had a cream in my handbag.

334
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,836
I put some in the palm of his hands.
This smell.

335
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,034
I stroked his cock with it.

336
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,790
I put some on my stomach.

337
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,439
When I felt he was about to cum,
I grabbed him and fucked him.

338
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,192
Then I kissed him, quickly.

339
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,237
I thought he'd like it.

340
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,876
After that we smoked a cigarette.

341
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,953
He gently took my hand.

342
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,720
I still had appointments and wanted
to get up.

343
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,592
He stopped me:
''I don't want you to leave.''

344
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,270
A girl like Nathalie
would have stayed right?

345
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,636
Is that how you see Nathalie?

346
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,839
About like that, yes.
- Watch out.

347
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,190
He lies like anything.
He isn't allowed to dump you immediately.

348
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,078
I don't expect that.

349
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,715
Living in a hotel must be nice.

350
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,551
Was he talking about me?

351
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,479
He said he had a woman
whom he loved deeply.

352
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,590
Yes, apparently he really loves me.

353
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,395
Have you been doing this for long?
- I don't keep count.

354
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,998
At what time do you start?
- At seven.

355
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,311
How many days a week?

356
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,034
Normally four.
More is possible too, if I want.

357
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,278
You smell good. What fragrance is that?

358
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,078
D'you like it? I bought it today.

359
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,550
No, I'm exhausted.

360
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,630
She's there. Shall we go?

361
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,238
See you later.

362
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,151
Everything alright?
- Yes, with you?

363
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,479
Bitch! Talking about bitches, d'you
know what I had to do?

364
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,596
A woman wanted the exact same
spots as you.

365
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,555
The previous week she came too.
Make-up Marilyn Monroe.

366
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,038
For the lips she wanted help from me.

367
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,719
Did you see him?

368
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,629
<i>Yes, but I was on the point of not going.</i>
- How come?

369
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,311
<i>I had a problem. Women's things.</i>
<i>But he still wanted to go to the hotel.</i>

370
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,790
He wanted me to undress,
but I refused to.

371
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,036
He could touch me under my clothes I said.

372
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,715
<i>But he wanted to cum together or not.</i>

373
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,148
<i>He asked questions about my life.</i>
<i>I just made up some stuff.</i>

374
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,477
<i>He also told a lot about himself.</i>

375
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,959
<i>And abou you.</i>

376
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,476
He had the feeling that at present you
were somewhere far away.

377
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,277
I asked myself if he knew about it,
if he was violent.

378
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,477
<i>How he would react.</i>

379
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,878
<i>Hello?</i>
- I'm still here.

380
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,429
<i>Am I bothering? Are you free tonight?</i>
- No. Not tonight.

381
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,992
<i>Pity. I'm not working.</i>
- Come eat something.

382
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,998
Come Catherine.
- Til later. I'll call you.

383
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,672
Who was it?

384
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,599
Your mother?

385
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,598
Big secret.

386
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,556
Everything ok?

387
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,836
Eat, it'll get cold.
Now that we're with the three of us.

388
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,869
How was he? Calm?
- Yes.

389
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,476
He saw people he knew
and waved to them.

390
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,638
What kind of people?
- A couple.

391
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,638
Was it a young woman? And old one?
- Like you.

392
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,589
He found it annoying that they saw him.

393
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,832
I was wearing this skirt.

394
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,194
My shoulderband was constantly sliding off.

395
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,158
One time he did it good again and
stroked my shoulder.

396
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,149
I took his hand under the table
and slid it through my thighs upwards.

397
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,556
I wasn't wearing any underwear.
He noticed.

398
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,989
He hesitated, but didn't do anything.

399
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,636
And suddenly he got what he wanted.

400
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,195
I told him I was going to the bathroom...

401
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,351
and that he should join me over there.

402
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,472
I waited a few minutes in the ladies room
with the door ajar.

403
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,796
I wasn't sure if he'd come.

404
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,999
Just when I wanted to go back
upstairs he came.

405
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,350
We went inside the cabin.

406
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,555
He pushed me against the wall and
kissed me bitingly in the neck.

407
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,790
He opened up my legs.

408
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,957
Then a woman wanted to come inside
but he blocked the door shut.

409
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,833
We were thrown out of the
restaurant as if we were thieves.

410
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,357
It was all for nothing.

411
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,873
No.

412
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,197
We walked through the street.

413
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,438
He constantly looked at me, as if
he still wanted to ask me something

414
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,392
but wasn't sure how to put it.

415
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,514
I felt he was still excited.

416
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,039
We walked through a carriage gate

417
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,477
There was a patio behind that...

418
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,076
with a some small stairs.
I went to sit over there.

419
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,112
He stayed on his feet.

420
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,149
Motionless, without touching me.

421
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,432
I took my dress off.
I was stark naked.

422
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,754
We didn't care about people 
passing by.

423
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,315
I went up the stairs.
He came after me.

424
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,308
We heard voices coming out of the rooms.

425
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,188
On the last step I leant against
the window.

426
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,398
There he took me.

427
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,470
He fucked me. It was hefty.

428
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,919
And then...

429
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,596
something happened.

430
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,831
Nathalie also cummed.

431
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,995
Nathalie... you?

432
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,994
With me it never happens whilst I work.

433
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,836
But you did enjoy.

434
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,272
That's your fault.

435
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,712
Do you still love him?

436
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,878
I don't know.

437
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,433
Please, madam.
- Thank you.

438
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,074
Your mother called.
- I'll call her back.

439
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,353
Can you help a sec?
- Of course.

440
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,115
How old were you when you had
your first period.

441
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,032
Fourteen.

442
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,472
And your job?
- Dancer. Classical ballet.

443
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,629
D'you use preservatives?
- No.

444
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,754
D'you want a child?
- Absolutely not.

445
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,918
Don't you take any precautions
whilst having sex then?

446
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,076
I've never done it before.

447
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,433
I'm listening.

448
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,476
I tried it once.

449
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,517
It was a disaster. I couldn't.

450
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,190
It hurt so much I got into a panic.

451
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,714
I don't know if I am like everybody.

452
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,110
See you miss.
- Thank you.

453
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,234
Hi Alice. See you tomorrow.
- Hi madam.

454
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,037
What are you doing here?

455
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,593
I saw your sign.
I hesitated but decided to come.

456
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,719
Was that wrong

457
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,154
No.

458
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,318
I'll get changed.

459
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,236
Do you also get girls like me?
- Sometimes.

460
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,959
I couldn't, we know each other.

461
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,716
I shouldn't have come.
- This is my job.

462
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,392
Did you see him again?
- Yes.

463
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,797
We can talk about it later.
- We're here now already.

464
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,711
I don't want to speak about it here.

465
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,632
Start already.

466
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,990
Ok.

467
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,310
What happened today?

468
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,355
Oh yes, I had to sit on my hands
and feet.

469
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,154
He pulled my thighs apart.
With lack of some type of lube he spat.

470
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,751
And then he said something like:
''I want your ass, I'm going to take you.''

471
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,515
I let him his way...
- You can stop now.

472
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,959
Are you shocked?

473
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,792
You wanted all the details.

474
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,519
Is that how he really talks?

475
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,508
Vulgar words like that are nothing to him.
- Not my fault.

476
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,830
And you gabble it off like that...

477
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,395
Its slutty in...

478
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,870
Slutty? Yes, and then?

479
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,238
You have no idea what they all saw.

480
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,519
He is not a customer like any other.
- You are no customer as any other.

481
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,317
It can't work every time.
- What d'you mean?

482
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,119
I can't help that I get excited.

483
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,914
I know thats how you make your living

484
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,839
But your tricks to excite men

485
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,469
will surely not work with everybody.

486
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,231
You could better leave.

487
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,036
Go look for somebody else.

488
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,071
As you see I'm back in real estate,
my first profession,

489
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,078
Ok, its still quite empty,

490
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,914
but the potential is enormous.

491
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,240
I didn't invite you for no reason.
I'm in search of resources.

492
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,714
You saw, and now the appraisal comes,

493
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,435
that the area is flourishing.

494
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,596
Its blooming amazingly.
- My wife.

495
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,869
Good evening.

496
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,752
Still in Stasbourg?
- Yes, and very glad.

497
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,270
Call me sometime
- Marianne !

498
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,994
See you.

499
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,509
A great woman.
She worked with us for six months.

500
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,438
No. Actually not.

501
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,793
Good night.

502
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,271
This place is nice,
althoguh I don't know what he wants with it.

503
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,914
We'll make it.
- Its already succeeded.

504
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,908
You know I have to leave. A flight.
- It did give me pleasure though.

505
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,189
Thank you.
- Here.

506
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,470
No, not now.
- Yes, like that I don't owe you.

507
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:28,118
Okey then. See you tomorrow, hon.

508
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,073
See you, François. And congratulations.

509
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,391
How are you?

510
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,478
He often travels huh?
Sorry, not my business..

511
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,269
I'd like another glass of champagne.

512
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,918
Thank you.

513
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,589
Do you like this music?
- Yes very good.

514
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,916
What is it?
- Joy Division.

515
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,193
Don't know them.
- The singer hung himself.

516
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,753
The groep Joy Division used to
be called Wallsaw

517
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:24,875
and is now called New Order
and world famous.

518
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,715
They're actually friends of mine.

519
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,313
D'you play any instruments?
- Guitar.

520
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,358
And you sing also?
- Yes.

521
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,199
You're not going to hang yourself are you?
- No, absolutely not.

522
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,191
Is there something?

523
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,475
I think I'll go home.
Where can I find a taxi?

524
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,238
We have all the time.

525
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,551
Come have a drink with me.

526
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,236
I'll take you on the stairs.

527
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,991
Open your eyes...
Yes, great.

528
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,598
I had all the trouble finding you.

529
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,031
Who told you I was here?
- I went to the bar.

530
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,236
D'you want to do this job as...
- Yes, why not.

531
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,597
I find it quite fun
I have a diploma.

532
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,552
I have to think about the future.

533
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,477
So you'll stop with it some time?
- Of course.

534
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,319
It is certainly not my call in this world.

535
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,632
But we've not reached that point in time yet.

536
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,559
I received your message.

537
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,236
What did you want to say?

538
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,516
That I went to bed with a man.

539
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,314
Quite a cute man.
And quite rough too.

540
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,189
Did he also pay?
- I let it go. I was drunk.

541
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,598
That helps.

542
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,871
I thought about something again.

543
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,357
We can't leave it as it is.

544
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,279
Oh no?

545
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,190
I thought we were done.
- I don't.

546
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,399
I saw him again.

547
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,074
Did he call you?
- No, I did.

548
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,719
I was in the mood. I thought I wasn't
going to see you again.

549
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,111
We had talked.
I had a dreadful day.

550
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,753
I was just put out of my flat.

551
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,560
He was very sweet, he listened.
That gave pleasure.

552
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,478
He acted as if your problems
hurt him.

553
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,758
No, not acted.

554
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,797
And where are you sleeping now?

555
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,714
He offered to hire something for me.
- But you refused.

556
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,115
I told him I'd think about it.

557
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,430
I'd find it awkward against you.

558
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,360
You see this flat is sub-divided.

559
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,630
This is the southern side.

560
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,755
The kitchen is fully furnished and 
there's a lot of storage space.

561
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,474
Is it for two?
- No.

562
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,875
Excuse me...
Hello?

563
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,868
One moment... Take your time looking
around, I'll wait outside.

564
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,709
Its really a bad time,
I'm with customers.

565
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,992
Do you like it?
- Yes.

566
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,989
But you don't have to pay.
- Yes I will, it will help you.

567
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,794
Where would you go otherwise?
To a hotel?

568
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,398
I'm used to this.

569
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,392
I once opened one in 
the Antilles, in Saint-Barth'.

570
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,149
How long?
- Two years. It didn't work out.

571
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,752
There I restarted. Resumed.

572
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,030
Haven't seen him in a while.

573
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,598
Say that you're going to visit some family.

574
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,395
Call him in a couple of days.
- Why?

575
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,392
What do you want?

576
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,478
Let him wait.

577
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,277
Frustrate him.
Miss a couple of dates.

578
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,516
Then I won't have to tell you anything anymore.

579
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,759
Marlène !

580
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,594
Where were you?
Your client's waiting for half an hour already.

581
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,950
Put him at ease. I'm sorry.

582
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,917
No problems, she's coming right away.

583
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,119
Oh, you're there?

584
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,997
Did you receive my message?
- No.

585
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,713
Another crisis with your mother.

586
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,396
Again.
- D'you want to join me for lunch?

587
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,992
Where d'you want to go?
- To La Frégate.

588
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,556
You look tired.
- A little, but its ok.

589
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,433
D'you have worries?
No, not really.

590
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,153
Tell me.

591
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,198
No, nothing.

592
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,876
I don't get enough sleep lately.

593
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,279
D'you want some wine?

594
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,948
D'you have Vouvray?
- Sure madam.

595
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,358
I didn't know you liked to drink Vouvray.

596
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,314
Shall we go away next week
for a couple of days.

597
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,796
Can you free yourself?
- Its not easy. I've worked a lot.

598
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,028
I thought you couldn't leave Paris?

599
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,193
Yes, but I want to get out.

600
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,272
No, I can't.

601
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,629
Are you disappointed?

602
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,554
Yes, I'm disappointed.
Very disappointed.

603
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,238
I don't get it.

604
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,749
What are you running away from?

605
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,638
I'm not running away at all.

606
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,428
Good.

607
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,678
Terrible.

608
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,470
You feel so bad here?

609
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,311
No, you're a sweetheart.

610
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,600
But I'm bored out of my mind.

611
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,360
Sorry, don't take it personally.
- Stay down.

612
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,109
Well no. It itches like anything.
Maybe I have lice.

613
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,909
How late is it?
I'm going to the hairdressers.

614
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,554
No, I'm not going to the hairdressers.

615
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,673
I can also cut everything.
- No, you'll hurt yourself!

616
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,032
Good night.

617
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,394
Well, tell him you don't
feel too good.

618
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,273
That you'll ring him back tomorrow.

619
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,555
You don't have to give any explanations.

620
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,478
I'm your mother.

621
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,632
No, not so well.

622
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,834
No, a hair problem.

623
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,679
My mother.

624
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,714
Hello. Nathalie.
- Yes miss.

625
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,076
Are you professional?
- Yes.

626
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,552
Nathalie works at a hairdressers.

627
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,038
I'm not saying anything, but we will
give a treatment.

628
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,518
That kills any nits.
After that I'll trim the points.

629
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,474
i'll put some rolls in it, the foam on
it and then you'll see nothing anymore.

630
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,069
I trust you. I guess I have to.

631
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,630
How d'you know each other?

632
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,311
We work in the same neighbourhood.

633
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,151
You're neighbours then?

634
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,152
Do you know Bernard?

635
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,876
Why are you lauging like that idiot?
What did I say?

636
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,273
<i>...wanted to forget</i>

637
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,033
<i>A cheery song.</i>

638
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,993
<i>In the summer streets</i>

639
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,232
<i>You...</i>

640
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,913
<i>You I don't forget</i>

641
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,712
<i>That summer street</i>

642
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,829
<i>Any a girl that was walking there</i>

643
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:08,272
<i>''All dreams'' rhymes with ''coming to an end''</i>

644
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,835
<i>Nothing will happen what you dream</i>

645
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,798
<i>Gone before it even started</i>
<i>The time of a dance</i>

646
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,434
<i>A chorus in rhymes</i>

647
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,752
Its nice.

648
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,597
Before I used to love that tune.

649
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,634
Now it doesn't make me feel anything anymore.
I'm really dry now.

650
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,872
No, you sung it really well.
- What d'you think?

651
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,077
I'm going to say sleep well.

652
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,553
You still have to come and visit me.

653
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,832
Goodnight mum
- Goodnight.

654
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,272
A nice photo.

655
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,038
I was seventeen then.

656
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,398
I prefer you the way you are now.

657
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,955
Nothing needed?

658
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,278
Can you pass me those cigarettes?

659
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,389
Thank you.

660
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,829
Want one?

661
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,554
Nice armband

662
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,197
Bought it in Morocco.
- Silver?

663
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,839
Too big.

664
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,759
Was this your room?
- Yes.

665
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,671
Then I'm sleeping in your bed?

666
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,232
Did you ever bring home guys?

667
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,038
That happened some times.

668
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,076
By the school there was a bar.

669
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,317
There've been some.
Not many.

670
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,314
And?

671
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,790
I was quite a hot chick.

672
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,634
One forgets things.

673
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,029
Wasn't there one who meant more to you?

674
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,829
Yes. One.

675
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,478
It was very intense. I broke it down.

676
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,032
But I stayed thinking about it for years.
Even whilst it was going well with Bernard.

677
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,952
Because it was going well?

678
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,517
Its getting late.

679
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,358
One coffee, one beer.
- One coffee.

680
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,238
How was your day?
- Good, good.

681
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,796
Yes?
- You have days everything is quite ok.

682
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,516
Why? Who did you see?
- Nobody in particular.

683
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,436
Row four.

684
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,679
There.

685
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,593
Sorry.

686
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,430
I had lunch with Thierry yesterday.

687
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,154
Yes, it was very nice.

688
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,077
We never talked so well with each other.

689
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,238
Afterwards his girlfriend came.
Very smooth.

690
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,474
Aren't you feeling well?
- Yes I am.

691
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,193
Why did you want to see this?
Good reviews?

692
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,639
You wanted to see it.
- Oh yes, thats true.

693
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,274
Didn't you remember?
- No.

694
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,391
I don't feel well,
I'm going home.

695
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,797
I'll go with you.
- You don't have to. You can stay.

696
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,593
It was about time.
- Ammunition.

697
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,713
Have fun.
- Bubbles heat me up right away.

698
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,878
Thats nice.
In this drowsy weather I'm really cold.

699
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,914
We come from the south.
- Me too. Well, I worked in Cannes.

700
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,189
In Cannes?

701
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,631
We have a shop in Nice,
but I'm from Cannes.

702
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,150
That's my city. When were you there?

703
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:39,388
About six years ago.
- We're doing a confectionary fair.

704
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,192
A buddha, how sweet.

705
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,828
Good night.

706
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,828
lsn't Marlène there?
- Upstairs, with clients. Don't disturb her.

707
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,190
D'you want to drink something?
- No thank you.

708
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,790
Can I see Simone?
- A beauty. I'll introduce you.

709
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,875
Are you feeling better?

710
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,397
How was it?

711
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,840
Not bad, not bad at all.

712
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,793
The main part was longwinded,
but it was good.

713
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,639
Its already late. D'you want to have something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

714
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,796
Why do you watch that rubbish.

715
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,632
<i>He came and lay down on me.</i>

716
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,315
<i>He wanted to cum on my face.</i>

717
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,034
<i>I asked myself whether you'd want that.</i>
<i>l hesitated.</i>

718
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:15,153
<i>And then I said yes. But shyly.</i>
<i>As if it was the first time.</i>

719
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,310
<i>He came and stood above me.</i>
<i>And jerked himself off.</i>

720
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,796
<i>I got it all over my face.</i>

721
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,873
<i>It was warm.</i>

722
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,156
<i>And then he left again.</i>

723
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,399
<i>I stayed alone,</i>
<i>naked in the room.</i>

724
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,156
<i>I must have slept for a while.</i>
<i>I drank something, I was thirsty.</i>

725
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,949
<i>I wanted to call you, but...</i>

726
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,312
<i>I stood up, the window was open.</i>
<i>I looked outside.</i>

727
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,114
<i>It was raining lightly,</i>
<i>but it wasn't cold.</i>

728
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,511
<i>I didn't feel like going.</i>

729
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,556
I have to go to London, its definite now.

730
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,914
I'll be back tomorrow morning or in the evening.
Did you see my black sweater?

731
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,554
Thanks.

732
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,272
And your passport.

733
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,475
Morning mum.

734
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,152
Marie's here.

735
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,559
She lost her keys,
thats why we slept here.

736
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,193
Clever.

737
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,433
Oh hello. Come inside.

738
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,678
I'll come right away.

739
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,432
Is this where you receive clients?
- Not really. Friends.

740
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,879
Friends... but not Bernard.

741
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,599
No, not him.

742
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,351
I thought you wouldn't like that.

743
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,916
I also prefer you do it elsewhere
with the others.

744
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,874
Ok.

745
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,757
He's quite calm with me.

746
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,277
I don't know whats going on inside him.

747
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:30,029
He went crazy in the flat.
He thought I had somebody else.

748
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:34,639
I couldn't really say it was you.
- Poor devil.

749
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,798
He was jealous.

750
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,875
I actually like that though.

751
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,192
Did you feel flattered?

752
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,518
Not only that.

753
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,114
With men jealousy is a reflex.

754
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:55,032
And after that everything was alright again?
- Yes.

755
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,832
He undressed you...

756
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,191
He was excited,
you gave him a blowjob, he fucked you.

757
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,918
No, he couldn't.

758
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,034
I saw him suffering and didn't insist.

759
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,915
But it did touch me somehow.

760
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,958
How so, touched you?

761
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,512
He felt he was using me and 
didn't want that.

762
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,910
Because he respects you in such a way...

763
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,917
I think he's serious.
- No.

764
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,835
He wants to live together with me.

765
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,431
He couldn't have possibly said that?

766
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,995
Why?

767
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,473
If he knows who you are...
- Tell him, then we'll see.

768
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,792
Naked in a hotel room its possible,
but in his world...

769
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,198
What's special about it,
except that no more fucking happens?

770
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,795
I couldn't care less about him anymore.

771
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,274
Thats not true,
otherwise you would have left him.

772
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,678
I'll see you later.

773
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,511
Come, there's a table over there.

774
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,198
A glass of champagne?

775
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,672
Hi, Djamel. Two champagne.

776
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,792
Hi, joke.
- Fuck off.

777
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,151
Don't be so annoyed.

778
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,473
Men amongst themselves!
Now if they were homo's...

779
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,398
Do you have somebody in your life?

780
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,155
No.

781
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,274
Everything alright?

782
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,792
You know everybody here.
- I come here after work. Cosy no?

783
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,479
Cigarette?

784
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,594
Thanks.

785
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,480
We're going out to a club later.

786
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,831
Good? Do you like to dance?
- I don't dance very well.

787
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,279
Nice.

788
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,637
Great.

789
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,637
Yes, I quite like it.

790
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,435
I didn't see him.
But you looked with such a gaze.

791
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,837
We're lost aren't we?
- I know exactly where we are.

792
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,196
I thought you were quite rude
to him.

793
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,231
What's that?

794
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,716
Strange no?

795
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,471
Are you alright?
- Yes.

796
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:16,508
He had a strange smell.
A smell of daffodils.

797
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,510
Daffodils are really yellow right?

798
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,471
Can you make perfum with daffodils?
I really doubt it.

799
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,629
Taxi!

800
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,316
Last time I went inside a taxi
they were playaing jazz.

801
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,397
Hi sir.
- What was playing?

802
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,277
I want to go home.

803
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,032
I'll take you.

804
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,193
Tomorrow.

805
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,318
You lost your hairbrush?

806
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,676
D'you have breakfast?
- No, just an apple.

807
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,279
Have a good day.

808
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,398
I was worried.

809
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,992
You could have told me.

810
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,357
i didn't know where to call.

811
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,519
Sorry.

812
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,995
Were you really worried?

813
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,715
Very worried.

814
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,078
Are you surprised by that?

815
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,996
I thought you wouldn't be that worried.

816
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,398
Did you meet somebody?

817
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,758
I guess you can call it that.

818
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,119
For how long?

819
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,277
A couple of weeks.

820
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,433
Right.

821
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,516
Yes, I thought so.

822
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,913
Who is it?

823
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,238
I thought you'd like it.

824
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,311
I don't know what you mean.
- Stop lying all the time.

825
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,718
Don't deny that you're with somebody.
- Absolutely not.

826
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,758
I know.

827
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,992
What d'you know?

828
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,277
Say it if you know.

829
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,835
Its so obvious.
- No... its not.

830
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,556
Look at me.

831
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,075
I don't understand you, Catherine.

832
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,998
What have I done wrong to you?

833
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,117
You can tell me everything you know.

834
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,994
What is your star sign? Twins?

835
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,708
Then you have a strong ascendant.

836
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,918
Shall we order another bottle?

837
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,715
Can I ask you something?

838
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,512
Are you shaven?

839
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:03,029
Excuse me a sec, I'll be right back.

840
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,069
We didn't make a date.

841
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,472
He wants to leave me.

842
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,917
You were right. He does want to leave me.

843
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,510
Did he say that?
- No.

844
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,956
Not with so many words.
But I feel it.

845
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,993
He really keeps his distance.
And acts cool.

846
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,509
He heardly says anthing.

847
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,119
He doesn't even lie about what
he does in his time.

848
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,472
Maybe you're mistaken.

849
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,632
I don't think so, no.

850
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,114
You didn't talk with each other, right?

851
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,712
No.
- Marlène, your client's waiting.

852
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,189
Yes.

853
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,672
Meet you at the bar of the hotel?

854
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,960
I have to pay you, no?
- No.

855
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,799
Everything alright?
- Yes.

856
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,831
With you?
- Yes.

857
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,152
I like the sphere here.

858
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,558
D'you often come here?
- Once in a while.

859
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:04,470
What d'you want to drink?
- A whiskey please.

860
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,708
I still don't know what you want
to tell me.

861
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,557
You'd be angry if I did.
- No.

862
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,316
No, I can understand.

863
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,989
Maybe I broke something.

864
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,160
Are you listening.
- Yes.

865
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,990
If you had another man,
you would have told me.

866
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:47,917
But everytime I say something...
or do something...

867
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,789
it doesn't seem to get through.
You're angry with me.

868
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,716
It can't end like this can it?

869
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,239
Why not?

870
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,951
Because I love you.

871
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,952
Who is that girl?

872
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,233
No idea.

873
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,357
I'm going to move house.

874
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,318
I was waiting til you came.

875
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,432
You're husband didn't look at me,
he only gave me a fire.

876
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,310
He didn't see me,
you have a different taste.

877
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,993
I stole from you.

878
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,677
Yes, you lied to me.

879
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,518
Stolem

880
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,152
Why?

881
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,918
It was a chance like I never got one.

882
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,872
Not having to do it.

883
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,991
And you wanted it so much.

884
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,590
I just made up everything.

885
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,918
If I would have said it, we 
wouldn't have seen each other again.

886
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,077
This is a cheap joke.

887
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,591
Now you won't believe me anymore.

888
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,799
We're coming late.
- I'm hurrying.

889
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,357
And what if we didn't go?
