2
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:02,607
The best place to meet a guy
is the supermarket.

3
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:05,473
You see a guy holding a list,
you know he's married.

4
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:09,845
He's in the frozen-food section
carrying a small basket, he's single.

5
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:14,011
I hang out by fruits and vegetables.
Better chance of getting a guy who's healthy.

6
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,690
Probably the best place
is Home Depot or any hardware store.

7
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,523
You just walk up
to the cutest guy and say:

8
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:26,428
"Do you know where I can get nailed?
I mean, nails?

9
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:29,226
Pardon me,
I've been drinking all afternoon."

10
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:32,838
And that way he knows,
one, that you're easy...

11
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,339
...and two, that you like to drink.

12
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:40,671
I thought a great place to meet girls would
be night school where they teach English.

13
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:43,409
Because these girls
would be from foreign lands...

14
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:46,645
...and maybe still a little disoriented
from the journey...

15
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:50,882
...and I would look attractive
because I speak English very goodly.

16
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,687
But in the end,
it did not work out as I had hoped.

17
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:58,162
I mean, basically, I was told to
take a hike in 14 languages.

18
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,734
Where do you meet people?
I don't know, they're everywhere.

19
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,339
Why, is there a problem?

20
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,847
No. No way,
I'm not going out with this guy.

21
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:17,075
Just call him. Say hello.
He's in my book club.

22
00:02:17,252 --> 00:02:19,516
- Why is there a woman here?
- It's his wife.

23
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:22,851
They're separated, but he didn't want
to Photoshop her out...

24
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:25,424
...if you're not interested.
They are in Hawaii.

25
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:28,721
It's the Four Seasons.
This could be you in the photograph.

26
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:30,395
Aloha.

27
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:33,261
- Well, if you change your mind.
- I've got a picture too.

28
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:35,960
Is that why you're all here?
The whole family?

29
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:39,106
- Everyone has a picture for me?
- This is an intervention, Sarah.

30
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:41,970
- He's great.
- A beautiful girl like you can't just give up.

31
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,371
There's life after divorce.

32
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:46,036
You were married to the same woman
for 45 years, Dad.

33
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:49,411
- What do you know about divorce?
- Precious little, I admit.

34
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:52,810
The black specter of two lives
torn asunder.

35
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:54,318
Not helping, Dad.

36
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:56,719
I wish your mother were here,
God rest her soul.

37
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:59,720
- She'd know what to say.
- "Put on another pot of tea."

38
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:03,591
That's what she'd say.
The Irish answer to all problems.

39
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,926
- Well, it worked most of the time.
- Who is this?

40
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,161
I have no idea, but if you're interested,
I'll Google him.

41
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:12,033
Is this it for food in this house,
like, eight crackers?

42
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:14,107
And what are these?
Are these bananas?

43
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:17,005
- I think they were at one time.
- I'll take one.

44
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:20,272
- I guess I forgot to shop this month.
- What are you gonna do, sis?

45
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,350
- I mean, really, it's been eight months.
- Dad's giving-up idea sounds intriguing.

46
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,647
I could become the crazy aunt
who moves in down in the basement.

47
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:31,383
Put a cot in for me, some herbal teas.
I'd like to get a dog, if that's okay?

48
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:34,084
Marc, don't you have
a friend for Sarah?

49
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:37,959
"A Friend for Sarah." I'm now an episode
of Little House on the Prairie.

50
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:41,000
- Come on, you must know somebody.
- Not really.

51
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:45,469
But if you want to have an affair,
I do know a couple of married guys.

52
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:49,770
- We'll let that be our fallback, okay?
- Okay.

53
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:53,141
- An affair, that's a terrific idea.
- My husband to the rescue.

54
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:54,542
Don't cover mine.

55
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:57,184
I think affairs should go
on the other side.

56
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:01,683
Yeah.

57
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,000
Hey, Jake.

58
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:14,863
Hey, Charlie.

59
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:18,202
Divorce is final.

60
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,533
You're a free man.

61
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,469
I don't know if... is the
appropriate sentiment. Four years...

62
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,977
...woman I loved, I got my ass kicked.
- High-five.

63
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,637
Not that kind of moment either.

64
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:30,148
- Down low?
- Just because I want this to stop.

65
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,384
You are officially the worst client
I've ever had.

66
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:35,420
- Thank you.
- Let Lisa have everything.

67
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,058
Even the judge wanted you to keep
those boxing gloves.

68
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:41,457
- She really liked you.
- I liked her too, as far as judges go.

69
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:43,187
No. I mean, really.

70
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:47,630
Wow, that's a good-looking cougar.

71
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:52,067
Excellent stuff. You think she'd like
to buy a handmade, stainable teak boat?

72
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,401
Maybe if it came with private lessons.

73
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,375
Everybody wants all that Tupperware...

74
00:04:57,545 --> 00:05:00,412
...those computer-designed,
fiberglass-composite things.

75
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:02,482
I mean, don't even look like boats.

76
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,210
They look like boats when they
whiz by your wooden guy.

77
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,287
That was one race, and I've made
some adjustments, Charlie.

78
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,148
- Wood boats can win, trust me on that.
- They can't win.

79
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:12,918
That's why people don't want them.

80
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,119
They can't win,
but they lose beautifully.

81
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:18,424
And the whole experience
is just better. Look at this.

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,068
I'm making these boats
the exact same way...

83
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:24,296
...the Spanish and the Portuguese
made their ships of exploration.

84
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:27,032
There's a continuity
at stake here, Charlie.

85
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,073
This is more than a boat.

86
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:32,605
- This is a time machine.
- Lf you paid this much attention to Lisa...

87
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,010
...you'd still be together.
- This is true.

88
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:38,611
But you know what? If I had to do it
it all over again, I wouldn't.

89
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:43,779
I wouldn't.
Lisa taught me about sadness...

90
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,016
...about human frailty...

91
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:48,787
...and how unbearably fleeting
happiness can be.

92
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:52,421
- I'm gonna owe her for the rest of my life.
- Oh, you'll be paying. Monthly.

93
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,498
Hope you don't mind
that I brought Mother Teresa.

94
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,733
Are you kidding? I love this girl.
Mother Teresa, do you have a friend for me?

95
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,672
Hey, is everything all right at home?

96
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:05,972
Yeah, Jennifer just gets tired
of all the family gatherings.

97
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:08,377
Too many old stories.
It makes her feel left out.

98
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,017
Yeah. Kevin used to say that.

99
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:11,776
- I still say it.
- I say it too.

100
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,579
It seems hard now, Sarah, I know...

101
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:17,350
...but you get a chance to make
a new life for yourself.

102
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:19,993
Thank you, but in
the marketplace of available women...

103
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:23,221
Any guy would be lucky to get you.
You're smart, you're funny...

104
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,866
...even pretty when
you're not wallowing in self-pity.

105
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,331
Am I wallowing? Really?

106
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:30,300
You're not the wallower
in the family. Carol is the wallower.

107
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,167
Me? I never wallow.
I suffer in silence.

108
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,908
- No, that's Christine.
- Thank you, Michael.

109
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,635
No, no.

110
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:40,708
- Sylvia Plath.
- This is why people...

111
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,645
...don't have large families anymore.

112
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:45,218
- Bye. I love you.
- Bye.

113
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,451
- Bye, Bill.
- Love you, Carol.

114
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:50,120
- See you, Dad.
- Thank you, I think.

115
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,451
Bye, chris. Bye.

116
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,093
- See you later, Dad.
- Bye, Daddy.

117
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,319
Bye.

118
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:58,393
There's someone special
waiting for you, Sarah.

119
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:02,093
I know it. Someone worthy.

120
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:05,801
Kevin was not, on his best day...

121
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,498
...good enough for you, sweetheart.

122
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,739
Now you tell me.

123
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:32,523
Why not?

124
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:36,932
You know I love you and I love Lisa,
but I think you're both better off.

125
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:40,006
We sure weren't making each other
happy there at the end.

126
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:43,007
Or the beginning.

127
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:44,873
Or the middle.

128
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:49,710
I mean, don't get me wrong, we all
wanted to sleep with Lisa, but marriage...

129
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:52,216
- That's not right.
- I said that out loud, didn't I?

130
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:55,356
- You did.
- I better strike that from the record.

131
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:58,583
No, lawyers get to do that.
I'm instructing you to disregard that.

132
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,490
I think women have
the whole thing planned.

133
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:04,027
Really, the whole thing.

134
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:07,531
An epic narrative in their heads.
You know my theory about this?

135
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,966
When you meet,
they have the whole story written.

136
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:11,867
But you don't get to read it.

137
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,474
But if you go off script...

138
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:17,176
...right? They write you out
of the story.

139
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,074
I got written out of Act 3.

140
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:22,748
Now you're in Act 4, where I get you
banged every night of the week.

141
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,477
Charlie, I'm toast. I just got shredded.
I am...

142
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,451
- It's time, healing time. I'm on the bench.
- Hey. Hey.

143
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:32,184
I'm out of the game.
Bench me, bench me.

144
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:33,988
- Hey.
- Benched.

145
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:20,907
I'll be right with you.

146
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,243
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Single chicken breast, please.

147
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,973
For an extra 75 cents,
you can get the whole fryer here.

148
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,946
Two breasts, two thighs and a wing.

149
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:32,348
Thank you. I don't know
when I'd eat all that.

150
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,080
- It's just an extra 75 cents.
- It's not the 75 cents.

151
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:36,847
I hate to see food go bad.

152
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:40,317
We got a hundred recipes.
You can cook them, freeze them and...

153
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:43,789
Look, listen to me, mister.
I'm divorced, okay?

154
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:46,125
I eat alone,
usually standing over the sink.

155
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,393
I don't want chicken
hanging around, okay?

156
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,532
- Okay.
- Thank you.

157
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:30,505
Hey. There she is.

158
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:38,347
- Good morning. How are you?
- Good morning.

159
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:41,613
I called you last night
to see if you were up for a movie...

160
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:46,283
...or bowling or group shampooing.
- I'm sorry. Eric's parents are in town.

161
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,860
Mr. And Mrs. Stalin.
I'm under house arrest.

162
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,622
- Weren't they just here?
- Thank you.

163
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:54,325
I don't know why they can't stay at
a hotel. Nothing I do makes them happy.

164
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:57,368
And they make Eric so nervous,
he's like the Tin Man.

165
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:00,473
You have to hang in there, Leo.
You and Eric are my model...

166
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:03,576
...for a successful relationship.
- I fear for you, child.

167
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:06,941
Anyone have anything exciting
happen this weekend to share?

168
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,706
My Uncle Mike slept over.

169
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:11,750
Uncles and aunts
are very important to us, aren't they?

170
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,912
He's not really my uncle,
but my Mommy makes me call him that.

171
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:21,662
When he's there, I can't sleep with
my Mommy because he's in her bed.

172
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:25,063
Anyone else have anything
they'd like to share?

173
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,632
Yes, Austin.

174
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,826
My parents are trying it
apart for a while.

175
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:31,164
- We have a theme, June.
- Yes, we do.

176
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:35,742
And Mom says my Dad is incorrigible.
That means he likes other women.

177
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,977
Good.

178
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:42,410
One, two.

179
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,640
Let me try.

180
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,446
That's a hop.

181
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:51,458
One, two, that's a new step.
Very good.

182
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:54,521
- Molly, you wanna try the sticks?
- Yeah, come on, Molly.

183
00:11:57,531 --> 00:12:00,125
Very good. Keep it going like that.

184
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,961
- Watch.
- No, I'm doing it.

185
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,003
Austin!

186
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,802
Good Lord, it's a gusher.

187
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:17,249
Let me see your teeth.

188
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:20,247
- Hey, bubba.
- Look who's here.

189
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:21,785
Daddy!

190
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,085
- Are you all right?
- Yep, I'm fine.

191
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:28,561
He had a decent bloody nose
for a while, but he's fine now.

192
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:32,859
- You didn't have to rush right over.
- A kid bleeds, I show up. It's house rules.

193
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,127
- You wanna get your stuff together now?
- Yeah.

194
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:38,534
- Then I need a minute alone with Ms. Nolan.
- Okay. Bye, Ms. Nolan.

195
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:40,469
Bye.

196
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:56,922
No. No. No.

197
00:12:58,225 --> 00:12:59,715
So, Ms. Nolan...

198
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:02,361
- Sarah, please.
- And I'm Bob.

199
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,225
Actually, everybody calls me Bobby.

200
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:06,593
I've been trying to change it
since third grade.

201
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,132
I'm a pushover for Bobbys...

202
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:12,170
...ever since my first boyfriend,
Bobby Healy, just...

203
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,602
You know?

204
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:18,278
I forget, is it "always discuss your personal
history with parents" or "never discuss"?

205
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:21,904
It's "always discuss."
Besides, I find it comforting.

206
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:24,516
So has Austin told you
anything about...?

207
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:26,209
- About you and...
- Yeah.

208
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,379
That you're taking a break from
your marriage and you're incorrigible.

209
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:32,253
That phrasing came from his mother.

210
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:35,156
- I wouldn't have put it that way, but...
- I'm sorry.

211
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:37,797
If there's anything you think
I need to know, tell me.

212
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:40,195
- I will.
- Sometimes with Austin, you can forget.

213
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,199
- Because he seems so mature.
- I know.

214
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,702
The other day he asked
about my retirement plan.

215
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:48,273
Well, he cares about you, and he
wants you to be financially secure.

216
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:51,945
You know Austin adores you.
I can see why.

217
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:55,543
- Thank you, Bob.
- I might prefer Bobby after all.

218
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:58,276
I mean, I like the...
I like the history.

219
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:09,691
Two guys alone in the afternoon
watching Doctor Zhivago.

220
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:13,095
- There's something gravely wrong here.
- It's all there, man.

221
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,700
The yearning, the suffering,
a woman you'll pursue...

222
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,770
...through blizzards, across continents.

223
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:21,066
A love so real,
even after you're dead it still hurts.

224
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:23,642
- That's all I want.
- You need to get out.

225
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:26,780
- You do. You need to see real people.
- You wanna watch it again?

226
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:30,178
No. I want to go out. Come on,
I previewed some Internet ads for us.

227
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:33,411
Internet ads? Come on,
I want Zhivago's Internet ad:

228
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:37,148
"Tragic doctor/poet
in desperate pain seeks...

229
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:41,327
...like-minded playmate
for long snowshoe across Eurasia."

230
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,690
What do you bet he gets
a hundred responses?

231
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:46,560
We'll start with bisexual
Asian women who fly-fish.

232
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,328
- No Internet ads.
- This is for you. I hate to fly-fish.

233
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:51,164
- No, you don't.
- What about Sherry?

234
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:54,205
- I gave you her number. You never called.
- Sherry?

235
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:58,209
Sherry's 24. Her range of interest
extends from kickboxing to Tae Bo.

236
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,506
She slept with half the guys
in my office.

237
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:02,774
Then why do you want
to set me up with her?

238
00:15:02,983 --> 00:15:06,282
She slept with half the guys
in my office.

239
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:09,514
She's in her early 20's. You know
the epic narrative I talked about?

240
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,420
Hers would not only be secret,
it would be incoherent.

241
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:14,720
I wouldn't get past the cover page.

242
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:18,527
I mean, I'm looking
for something more than Sherry.

243
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:21,395
"Hopelessly romantic,
young 50's widower...

244
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:25,471
...seeks lady friend who enjoys
the slow bloom of affection.

245
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:29,700
Loves dogs, children
and long, meandering bike rides.

246
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:31,811
I will be carrying
a single yellow rose."

247
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:35,746
- I gotta meet this guy.
- Where are your boob shirts?

248
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:37,916
- My what?
- Your boob shirts.

249
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:41,850
- Don't worry, I brought some of mine.
- Oh, boob shirts.

250
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:45,490
- I can't wear that.
- Okay, I have some dating tips for you.

251
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,093
I got them from Sports Illustrated.
Solid gold.

252
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:51,663
Yes, that's always been my bible
for personal relationships.

253
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,696
At least listen to the tips.

254
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:56,564
- Your sister has gone to a lot of trouble.
- Okay.

255
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,931
"One, maintain eye contact.

256
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:04,009
But be sure it isn't too intense.
You aren't a hawk eyeing its prey."

257
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:06,703
Good that you told me.
I might have done my hawk thing.

258
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:12,079
"Two, men respond sexually when
they think women are excited by them."

259
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:14,380
- Really?
- "The more you like what you see...

260
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:18,321
...the more your pupils
will open wide to take it all in."

261
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,991
Open your pupils.

262
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:24,390
Oh, my God.

263
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:27,193
- I'm dating again. I can't do this!
- It's okay. Come on.

264
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:29,632
- No, you'll be fine, it's okay.
- It'll be fun.

265
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:32,271
What if he wants to have sex?
What if I want to?

266
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,976
You don't understand. It's been
a long time, Christine. I could freak out.

267
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:38,770
What if I can't control myself?

268
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:42,973
You're meeting for muffins
in a public place. I think you'll be safe.

269
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:59,929
- Dad?
- Sarah.

270
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,330
My darling girl.

271
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,235
Darling, don't you put
the sunshine to shame.

272
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:06,930
What are you doing here?

273
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:10,702
That's a fine how-do-you-do
from one of my favorite daughters.

274
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:14,473
I'm sorry, it's just that I'm meeting a...
why do you have a yellow...?

275
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:20,083
- Is that a rose?
- It is a rose, if the truth be told.

276
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,312
But by any other name...

277
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:26,423
- And it's for a lady friend, isn't it?
- That is, in fact, the very purpose.

278
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:31,163
- No!
- Now, Sarah, come on.

279
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:36,358
It is a natural course of this life that
your Dad would have a lady friend by now.

280
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:39,301
I feel your mother whispering her
approval to me every day.

281
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:42,704
And would this lady friend
be someone who might enjoy...

282
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,901
...the slow bloom of affection, perhaps?

283
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,671
That would be grand, yes.

284
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:49,314
I'm your date, Dad.

285
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:53,879
I am. I answered
my own father's personal ad.

286
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,286
Don't laugh. It's not funny!

287
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,484
It shows I brought you up to know
the diamond from the riffraff.

288
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:03,323
A young 50, Dad? You're 71.

289
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:05,922
And when was the last time
you rode a bike?

290
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,592
- Meandering or any other way?
- Well, think of it as poetry, darling.

291
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:12,863
As who I am
in the bottom of my soul.

292
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:16,272
And, Sarah, my darling.

293
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:19,537
- What?
- I'm glad you've started dating again.

294
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,973
Dad, please. This is disturbing
on so many levels.

295
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:27,213
- At least let me have the rose.
- I can't.

296
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:29,716
I'm seeing someone else at 4:00.

297
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:43,796
Hello. You've reached Sarah Nolan.
Leave a message if you want to.

298
00:18:44,104 --> 00:18:46,834
Sarah, it's me, Christine. Pick up.

299
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:50,642
Come on, Sarah,
I already talked to Dad.

300
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,408
- Who else knows?
- No one.

301
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:00,854
Come on, Carol has to know.

302
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,889
Why does Carol have to know? Couldn't
I once know something before she does?

303
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,522
She's there with you, isn't she?

304
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:10,721
- No.
- Hello, Carol.

305
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:14,933
Hi, Sarah. I was telling Chris it's a shame
I didn't know about this before...

306
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:18,333
...because I could have called
Uncle Chet. We could have doubled.

307
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,598
Oh, no.

308
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:25,608
This story is going to be immortalized
into family history, isn't it?

309
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:29,442
Told and retold
at Thanksgiving dinner, year after year.

310
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:33,643
Oh, not just Thanksgiving.
I think it's a good Christmas story too.

311
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:35,680
- Bye, guys.
- Wait.

312
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:39,451
Tell the truth. On a scale of one to 10,
how would you rate Dad as a date?

313
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:41,491
Hot, super hot?

314
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:51,669
Don't be mad at me for this, okay?

315
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,104
The last time you said that to me
you stole my boyfriend. Danny Shea.

316
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:58,108
I did not steal Danny Shea.

317
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:02,510
- I haven't forgiven you, by the way.
- Stop. He was a terrible kisser.

318
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:06,517
- He kissed just fine with me.
- Okay. Here goes.

319
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:08,917
I went online, pretended I was you...

320
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:12,684
...and put your profile
on PerfectMatch. Com.

321
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,620
You're making this up.

322
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,521
You can't just sit back
and passively answer...

323
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,931
...other people's ads anymore.
We are on offense.

324
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:26,504
Well, forgive me if I'm a tad gun-shy
after my last date with my father.

325
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:29,938
Come on, at least look at your profile.

326
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:32,478
That's my high school
graduation picture.

327
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:35,114
That's all I had.
That or your wedding photo.

328
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:36,840
"Voluptuous"? Carol!

329
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:40,384
Every woman listed claims
to be at least voluptuous.

330
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:44,717
Some are "gorgeous inside and out,"
most are "sexually confident."

331
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:49,659
"Voluptuous, sensuous DwF seeks
special man to share starlit nights.

332
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:52,195
- Must love dogs."
- I put that in for you.

333
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:54,300
And yet I'm still pissed.

334
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:58,837
I must have done something right.
You have 18 responses.

335
00:20:59,173 --> 00:21:01,073
You listened to them, didn't you?

336
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:04,506
I like three, 11 and 14.
Christine likes two and eight.

337
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:08,511
Michael liked them all.
But you decide for yourself.

338
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,149
What do you mean by voluptuous?
Do you mean big breasts...

339
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:45,182
...or do you mean fat?

340
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:48,182
I love dogs too.

341
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:52,018
I have a great sense of humor,
but you could probably already tell that.

342
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:54,026
Yo.

343
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:57,458
My name is Walter Taylor.
I'm an attorney.

344
00:21:57,631 --> 00:22:02,159
Don't hang up.
I like opera. Don't delete me.

345
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,998
So anyway, I get all dressed up...

346
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:08,835
...and I walk down the stairs and I see...

347
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,174
...my father sitting there
holding a single yellow rose.

348
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:15,939
And it dawns on me...

349
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:20,843
- Is something wrong?
- Well, no offense, it's just...

350
00:22:22,556 --> 00:22:24,717
I thought you'd be younger, that's all.

351
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:30,092
Well, you said your age range
was 25 to 45.

352
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:32,926
I guess I was hoping more for 25.

353
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:36,060
Twenty-three.

354
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:39,333
Eighteen. That's legal.

355
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,969
It's nice to be out.

356
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:47,079
I've been feeling kind of blue lately.

357
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:50,944
I know, you mentioned on the phone,
Lennie, that you've... Kind of depressed.

358
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:53,678
- Did I cry?
- Well, a little bit.

359
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:57,346
I've been on 17 first dates this year.

360
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:59,724
No second dates.

361
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:02,522
One went...

362
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,828
...to check her coat
and never came back.

363
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:10,535
One jumped out at the light
when it changed.

364
00:23:10,704 --> 00:23:15,573
Well, we're almost through the salad.
That's a good sign.

365
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:19,102
No.

366
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:21,238
Lennie.

367
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:23,315
Please. Don't.

368
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:28,209
Please. Lennie. No.

369
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:32,686
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands

370
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,724
come on!
If you're happy

371
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:37,363
And you know it
Clap your hands

372
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:39,960
Oh, God!

373
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,862
Come on, get up.
Get her. Get her.

374
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:44,127
Damn.

375
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,796
Don't be upset.
I come from a large family.

376
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:49,841
Lots of male cousins, brothers.
Used to this sort of thing.

377
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:51,639
Three out of five.

378
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:54,178
- Oh, that's all right. Maybe later.
- Come on.

379
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:57,408
- Your table's almost ready.
- Good. We're working up an appetite.

380
00:23:57,584 --> 00:24:00,212
Food here is fabulous.
It's not cheap, though.

381
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:02,753
Well, I offered to pay my half.

382
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,885
And what did I tell you?

383
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:07,788
"Marshall's girls don't pay."

384
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:09,427
Beautiful.

385
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,696
You'd look really good in handcuffs.

386
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:23,902
Charlie, my boy,
some nice-looking pieces here.

387
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:26,543
- Really? I didn't see anyone.
- I meant the artwork.

388
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,613
- Bet this cost a bundle.
- Hey, guys.

389
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:31,350
- Hi!
- Speaking of artwork.

390
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:34,783
- Hi, Sherry.
- Hi, Charlie. Hi, Jake.

391
00:24:35,055 --> 00:24:36,920
How are you? Let's do two.

392
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:40,353
- That's how they do it in France.
- You having fun?

393
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:43,121
Well, I feel sorry for the artist
at these things.

394
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:46,857
All this talent on display,
and everybody here's just trying to get laid.

395
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:48,524
I know I am.

396
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:51,762
You never called me, mister.
I waited and waited.

397
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:53,599
I know I am.

398
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:58,767
I'm sorry, Sherry, it's just that I'm not ready
right now to be in a serious relationship.

399
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:01,810
And with somebody as wonderful
and as beautiful as you...

400
00:25:01,982 --> 00:25:04,849
...I just wouldn't expect
anything less.

401
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,747
- Why can't you be sweet like that, huh?
- Sherry!

402
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,749
- Hey, guys.
- Short attention span.

403
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:13,721
You're a sick guy, you know that?

404
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,589
Just another in a long line
of colossal mistakes.

405
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:20,756
I'm not answering an Internet ad.

406
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:24,097
Look at this. "Voluptuous and sensuous.
Must love dogs." Wonderful.

407
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:25,898
Look at the picture.

408
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:29,500
Well, she is appealing.

409
00:25:30,777 --> 00:25:32,642
She'll be good-looking
when she grows up.

410
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:34,542
I'm surfing porn sites like always...

411
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:37,115
...I keep getting kicked over
to PerfectMatch. Com...

412
00:25:37,284 --> 00:25:39,081
...which is not where I want to be...

413
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:43,689
...and this girl's profile keeps repeating, like
a sign from heaven. And I thought of you.

414
00:25:43,857 --> 00:25:46,348
Tell the prom queen thanks, but no.
I'm still benched.

415
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,721
Too late. You're meeting her at 11.
Bring a dog.

416
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:50,192
No, I'm not.

417
00:26:02,442 --> 00:26:04,000
It's okay.

418
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:06,808
Stop that growling!

419
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,615
Use your words.

420
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:12,150
Stop, sit.

421
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,843
Stop, sit.

422
00:26:14,054 --> 00:26:16,648
- Stop. Sit.
- I don't think he knows "stop" or "sit."

423
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:19,758
- What else have you got?
- Bruno, focus.

424
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,723
Roll over and play dead.

425
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:26,655
- Hey, look at that. Look at that.
- That's very impressive.

426
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:31,535
- You Sarah?
- Jake.

427
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:34,333
- Yeah, Hi.
- Yeah. Hi.

428
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:39,240
I didn't recognize you
without the cap and gown.

429
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:41,174
Oh, yeah.

430
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:42,872
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

431
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,279
- This is really amazing.
- Yeah.

432
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,912
It is. When he plays dead,
he really plays dead.

433
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:54,527
You don't know the half of it.
He can stop his heart like a Sufi mystic.

434
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:57,993
- Does he sleep on a doggy bed of nails?
- As a matter of fact, he does.

435
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,929
He feels nothing.
Or perhaps he feels too much.

436
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:05,864
- I think he wants his treat now.
- You think so?

437
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:08,336
While he's playing dead?
It might ruin the effect.

438
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:11,841
- I don't know. He's your dog.
- He's not. He's my friend Charlie's.

439
00:27:12,012 --> 00:27:14,674
- So you're here under false pretenses.
- No, not at all.

440
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:18,579
You said "must love dogs,"
not "must own dogs." I do love dogs.

441
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:21,249
In fact, I had one with my ex.

442
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:23,753
She was allergic,
went into anaphylactic shock.

443
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:25,892
So we had to put her down. Dog.

444
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,527
Not the wife. I'm kidding about both.

445
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:32,724
This is a beautiful canine
you have here.

446
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:35,459
- Hi.
- Yes, this is Mother Teresa.

447
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:39,738
Yeah, she plays with lepers?

448
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:43,108
Comforts the poor? Yeah.
How long you had her?

449
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:46,837
Technically, she's not really mine.
She's my brother's.

450
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:49,811
I'm shocked and saddened.

451
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:54,145
- False pretenses.
- Well, we are related. She's family.

452
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:58,280
And I do really love dogs,
and my ex was allergic also.

453
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,154
Yes, he often had
"anaphyphlectic" shock.

454
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:02,759
You're making that up.

455
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,564
- Yes, I am.
- Me too.

456
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:11,070
Tell me, I'm just curious
about one thing.

457
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:12,899
Why did you write "voluptuous"?

458
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:16,705
- Oh, my...
- No! I did not mean to be rude at all.

459
00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:19,744
It's just that voluptuous,
that tends to go the other way...

460
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:21,437
...when someone uses that phrase.

461
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:23,640
Towards the full-figured end
of the spectrum.

462
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:26,149
I didn't know there was
a full-figured spectrum.

463
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,787
It's one of those words
they use in personal ads...

464
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:31,719
...like "Rubenesque"
or "weight proportionate to height."

465
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:34,486
Hey, it's your ad. You can say
whatever you want, I'm...

466
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:39,860
Just for the record, girl says "athletic,"
she means "flat-chested." which you're not.

467
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,263
But... This isn't coming out right.

468
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:44,794
Look, you know, I'm sorry.

469
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:48,429
I'm... I'm a little nervous. I'm not used
to meeting people this way.

470
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,599
Really? You seem very practiced
and smooth.

471
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,171
- Your ad doesn't do you justice.
- Well, maybe you should rewrite my ad.

472
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:58,715
- Well, maybe I don't want to.
- And why not?

473
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:01,683
Because maybe I don't want
anyone else to answer it.

474
00:29:02,522 --> 00:29:04,513
Did you plan on saying
that sometime today?

475
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:08,650
- No, I didn't. But it's good, isn't it?
- It is good.

476
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:12,696
- It's a good line.
- Maybe we should try this over again.

477
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,995
Hi, I'm Jake.

478
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:16,668
Sarah.

479
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:20,234
So why would you even write an ad?
You don't seem that desperate.

480
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,568
Why would you answer one?
Talk about desperate.

481
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:25,677
I'm not. I mean, I didn't.
It was my friend's. He gave it to me.

482
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:28,245
- I didn't write it. My sister did.
- Your sister's ad.

483
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:31,150
Your brother's dog.
Those your shoes?

484
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:34,916
Oh, my. Look at the time!
Come on, honey.

485
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,612
What I'm trying to say is
I'd like to get to know you.

486
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:41,192
I have to get this dog home, and you
don't want to go over on your rental.

487
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:45,088
Maybe we could try this another time.
You know, without the dogs.

488
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:47,255
You bet.

489
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:50,033
I'll call you.

490
00:29:51,972 --> 00:29:53,439
Sarah, for the record...

491
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:56,734
...you are kind of voluptuous
in a minimalist sort of way.

492
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:05,977
I'm not sure I'm up for this dinner
at Dad's new girlfriend's house.

493
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:08,985
- He seems really excited about her.
- Where are Marc and Jason?

494
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,816
They took the kids
to Magic Mountain.

495
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:13,892
The kids didn't even really
want to go. The Dads whined.

496
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,153
Well, they're so spoiled, those Dads.

497
00:30:16,363 --> 00:30:18,593
So how was your day today?
At the dog park?

498
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:21,893
- How did you know about that?
- Who do you think you're dealing with?

499
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:24,400
- You're good. I have to give you that.
- So come on.

500
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:25,902
- Tell me.
- Okay.

501
00:30:26,072 --> 00:30:29,269
We got off to kind of a rough start.
But then it was okay, you know?

502
00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:32,741
He was a little intense. He was nervous.
He couldn't stop insulting me.

503
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:34,573
You know what this sounds like.

504
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:37,842
- No, it's not. Don't say it.
- But it is. It's a growth opportunity.

505
00:30:38,018 --> 00:30:41,078
I'm not over my last growth opportunity
when you stole Danny Shea.

506
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:44,655
Will you forget Danny Shea?
He's probably a convicted felon...

507
00:30:44,824 --> 00:30:46,519
...by now, divorced.

508
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:48,489
- Maybe you should call him.
- Carol.

509
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:52,097
What about that guy you met
at preschool? You maimed his kid?

510
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:54,596
- Bob connor.
- Yeah. Mr. Incorrigible.

511
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,565
I told you, I can't.
He's the father of one of my students.

512
00:30:57,737 --> 00:31:01,468
Yes, honey, but he's not your father.
That's a big step forward for you.

513
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:05,040
- Bill.
- Dolly.

514
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:16,788
Hey!

515
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:34,471
- What a lovely home you have, Dolly.
- Thank you.

516
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:38,133
When my third husband died,
I decided to give up the big house.

517
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:41,108
Third out of how many?

518
00:31:42,082 --> 00:31:44,016
And these potholders?

519
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:46,579
Where did you manage to find them?

520
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:50,450
Why, everything in this house
is handmade by Dolly.

521
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:52,955
Oh, yes. She's very creative.

522
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,923
Our mother used to sew all our clothes
when we were younger.

523
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:57,893
- Sarah.
- Well, she did.

524
00:31:58,098 --> 00:32:01,329
Your father told me
all about your mother, honey.

525
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:03,627
She must have been
a very special lady.

526
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:07,033
- She was.
- And you must miss her very much.

527
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:09,168
- I do.
- And you see me...

528
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:11,401
...as something of an interloper,
I suppose.

529
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:14,241
Do you want me to lie down for this?

530
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:19,081
We're at interloping?
When did that happen?

531
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,549
It's Dad's life. I don't meddle.

532
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:24,018
Carol, you meddle
in my life all the time.

533
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,819
Well, technically that's not true,
because you don't have a life.

534
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:29,689
I happen to have a very full life.

535
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,726
Did you even check
all of your messages?

536
00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:34,059
I thought a few were very promising.

537
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:37,430
- Like who?
- Like the engineer from oxnard.

538
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:40,801
- With the sexual dysfunction.
- In what way would he be promising?

539
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:43,498
You could cure him.
The whole nurse-patient thing.

540
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:47,134
- You've got it all worked out.
- It was brave of him to be so forthcoming.

541
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:49,406
- Why don't you call him, then.
- Why don't you.

542
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:51,743
- Call! I'll give you his number.
- Maybe I will.

543
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:52,907
- Go for it.
- Okay.

544
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:54,951
Hey there. Ms. Nolan.

545
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:58,457
What are you doing yelling
in whispering Breeze Park?

546
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,183
Look who it is.

547
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,624
- What a surprise.
- Oh, hi, Ms. Nolan. How are you?

548
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:04,990
- Hi, sweetie.
- Who's that?

549
00:33:05,198 --> 00:33:07,564
- Oh, this is my sister Carol.
- Nice to meet you.

550
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:12,262
This is Austin, my student,
and his Dad, Mr. Connor. Bob.

551
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:14,099
Actually, I go by Bobby now.

552
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:16,066
Right. You live here?

553
00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:18,836
Yeah, they cater to the recently
separated and divorced.

554
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:22,379
But I'm the youngest guy here
by 40 years, so it's good for my morale.

555
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:26,381
- My wife and I are gonna try it apart.
- I know.

556
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:29,883
Will you just look at her, son?

557
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:32,456
Is my little girl lovely
or is my little girl lovely?

558
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:35,259
Oh, Dad, don't worry
about embarrassing me.

559
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:38,192
Stop it, Bill.
She is cute as a button, though.

560
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,027
So, what is it you do, Bobby?
Sarah never tells us about her beaus.

561
00:33:42,202 --> 00:33:44,397
I'm finishing my Ph. D.
in American history.

562
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:47,335
- A biography of Robert E. Lee.
- I always felt sorry for Lee.

563
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,566
Forced to fight against his old friends
and West Point classmates.

564
00:33:50,743 --> 00:33:52,142
Could only dress in gray. Sad.

565
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:55,247
She's funny too.
A complete package, you know.

566
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:57,906
When I need extra money,
I work construction.

567
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:00,518
Well, it sounds very manly.
Do you wear a hardhat?

568
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:03,988
Sarah was the one who always had
the boys knocking at the door.

569
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:06,785
- Oh, Dad.
- She had eyes only for that singer.

570
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,827
What was his name? Thin fellow.

571
00:34:10,163 --> 00:34:12,154
- Looked like a girl.
- Mick Jagger.

572
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:15,995
No, no. Sarah was saving herself
for David Cassidy.

573
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:17,397
Like you weren't.

574
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,006
- Carol wasn't saving herself for anybody.
- What?

575
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:24,840
I remember now. It was David Cassidy
of The Pheasant Family.

576
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,535
Bill. Bill, honey.

577
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:29,841
Partridge Family. You know,
I saw him last year in Vegas.

578
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:32,643
He was good. Hadn't changed a bit.
Same turtleneck.

579
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:35,253
Sarah had the whole
Partridge act down.

580
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:37,922
She'd put on the little miniskirt,
the go-go boots...

581
00:34:38,124 --> 00:34:39,682
...and pretend she was Susan Dey.

582
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:42,861
- This is all a lie.
- Sing the theme song, Sarah.

583
00:34:43,162 --> 00:34:46,928
- Don't make me kill you, Carol.
- You remember the intro.

584
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:57,070
- No.
- Come on.

585
00:34:57,243 --> 00:34:58,369
Come on.

586
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,427
Oh, that was what he told you.

587
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:50,493
- It was a great night.
- Great night.

588
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,063
I forgot how much fun those
humiliating family sing-alongs can be.

589
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:56,531
Can I say one thing
about Mr. Incorrigible?

590
00:35:56,703 --> 00:36:00,639
- Only if you sing it.
- He is hot. And he likes you.

591
00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:03,970
I can't. It's just my luck.
He's the father of one of my students.

592
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:08,637
He has a Ph.D. And a great ass.
Let's not get dragged down by ethics.

593
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:10,783
Technically, he doesn't have
his Ph.D. yet.

594
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,249
- But yes, the ass thing, I know.
- God, let's not even mention the eyes.

595
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:17,422
- The crinkly smile.
- No. That would be wrong.

596
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,755
- So can I ask you a question?
- No.

597
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:23,557
You never would have left Kevin.
Would you?

598
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,459
If he hadn't left me?
No, I don't think so.

599
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:30,295
But you weren't really happy.

600
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,600
Well, I figured that was the life I picked,
so I had to make the most of it.

601
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:37,105
I'm not even sure
I deserve a new life now.

602
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:40,643
Sometimes I think that was supposed
to be my one chance and I blew it.

603
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:43,907
Where did we get these bad attitudes,
you think?

604
00:36:44,283 --> 00:36:46,274
- The nuns?
- Yeah, that works.

605
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,249
Let's blame the nuns.
Can I say one more thing?

606
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,723
You love me. I know.

607
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:56,219
I do.

608
00:36:58,131 --> 00:37:00,861
I mean, I was really bad.
She did not see my A game.

609
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,160
Sounds like she didn't see
your B or C game.

610
00:37:03,336 --> 00:37:06,464
I'm gonna call her again.
I want to ask her out. I need a mulligan.

611
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,664
Dog threw me.
I mean, the sun was in my eyes.

612
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,274
Pick someone else, start over.

613
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:13,105
No, this girl, there's something
special about this girl.

614
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,543
You know the expression
"she took my breath away"?

615
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:19,879
I mean, she did. I actually gasped.
I'm off the bench, man.

616
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:22,619
Think she'll see you again?
I wouldn't.

617
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:25,781
You're not nice.
Like, you're not a nice person.

618
00:37:29,462 --> 00:37:30,724
- Hi, June.
- Hey, June.

619
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:32,956
- Hi, June.
- Hey, June.

620
00:37:33,132 --> 00:37:36,067
Need more cupcakes.
All the Dads are staying for the party.

621
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:38,032
- What's up with that?
- I have no idea.

622
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:40,297
Every Halloween it's the same thing.

623
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:44,068
But I guess it's great how involved
they are in their kids' world. Isn't it?

624
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:45,505
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

625
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,403
Why don't you and Eric come over.

626
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:52,176
I'll rent a hopelessly romantic movie.
We can all hold hands together and cry.

627
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:54,216
Sounds fun, but we can't.

628
00:37:54,387 --> 00:37:57,322
It's our anniversary, and we always
spend it just the two of us.

629
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,718
Sweet.

630
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:01,291
Seven years ago tonight,
we met at my parents' house.

631
00:38:01,461 --> 00:38:04,259
They were trying to fix Eric up
with my sister.

632
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,534
Sorry we're late.

633
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:11,397
Austin drives so slow.

634
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:13,835
I hope my family
wasn't embarrassing last night.

635
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,142
Oh, no. Not at all. They do seem
a little bit involved in your life.

636
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:20,506
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

637
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:22,510
Austin's Mom's from a large family.

638
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:25,014
That's a lot of people
that don't speak to me.

639
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:28,842
- Thimbleful of juice?
- Sure. But just one.

640
00:38:29,288 --> 00:38:31,950
- To good teachers.
- To good Dads.

641
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:34,524
To good teachers
who are also very beautiful.

642
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:40,423
To good Dads who
are dangerously cute and charming.

643
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,926
There you go.

644
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:51,134
There's an attraction here, Sarah.
You can't deny it.

645
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,835
- I'm not. I'm trying to ignore it.
- Why?

646
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:56,810
Well, for one, Austin is my student.

647
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:59,041
Two, we're in the puppet closet.

648
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:03,245
- Couldn't we go out in the real world?
- I'm not so good in the real world.

649
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:07,754
I was looking at the handbook,
under "dating, parents and teachers."

650
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,224
- Nothing. There's nothing there.
- Sarah.

651
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:15,166
We need the emergency pants.
It's an emergency.

652
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,400
Emergency pants.
Come on, sweetie.

653
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:31,244
Hey, Babe, my name is Ron.

654
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:35,410
Mid-40's, handsome, totally toned,
5'7", 161 pounds...

655
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:37,419
...give or take a piece of pizza.

656
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,117
No, I'm not kidding. I'm totally toned.
Call me, you won't be sorry.

657
00:39:42,328 --> 00:39:44,319
Hi, Sarah, it's Lennie.

658
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:48,298
I had a wonderful time, and I'm...

659
00:39:52,104 --> 00:39:53,799
I'll call back.

660
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:58,837
Hi, Sarah? It's Jake Anderson,
the idiot from the dog park.

661
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:01,775
Actually, that was all a test
to see how you respond...

662
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:04,314
...to crazy people, and you passed.

663
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:07,213
So maybe we could see
each other again.

664
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,980
What do you say?
You want to give me another chance?

665
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:20,464
I had a couple of icebreakers.

666
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:24,831
I even had a few stories for you,
anecdotes, but I forgot them all.

667
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:28,063
- I think it might be that dress.
- My sister Carol made me buy it.

668
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:30,238
I love Carol.

669
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:35,937
- Well, this is a very charming place.
- Yeah.

670
00:40:36,182 --> 00:40:38,514
- Good food?
- No, not particularly.

671
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:40,251
But I like the ambiance.

672
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:44,116
I come here because I know the owners,
the Parseghians, that couple over there.

673
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,520
- See? They're waving.
- They want us to join them.

674
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:48,956
A few years ago, in a moment
of blazing clarity...

675
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:51,426
...I forswore ethnic folk dancing, so...

676
00:40:51,597 --> 00:40:56,000
They'll come over and say hello
and maybe... How are you? Hi!

677
00:40:56,502 --> 00:40:59,437
- How are you?
- Hello.

678
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:04,041
Nice, right?

679
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:06,336
- Sarah, Mr. And Mrs. Parseghian.
- Hello.

680
00:41:06,512 --> 00:41:08,776
- Welcome, Sarah.
- Thank you.

681
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:18,990
See you later. We'll drink.

682
00:41:19,158 --> 00:41:21,058
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

683
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:24,196
- You speak Armenian.
- A little bit.

684
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,795
Well, what did you say?

685
00:41:25,965 --> 00:41:29,230
I asked him, "where is the youth hostel?"
It's all I remember.

686
00:41:29,535 --> 00:41:32,026
Kind of a joke we have.

687
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:34,102
What is it that you do, exactly?

688
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:36,703
God, no wonder I live alone.

689
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,402
I build boats.

690
00:41:39,578 --> 00:41:41,978
You know, these handcrafted
wooden sculls...

691
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:44,705
...rowing. The racing ones.
- Yeah. Really?

692
00:41:44,884 --> 00:41:46,749
Yeah. Yep.

693
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:49,444
- Does anyone buy those?
- Nope. Not yet.

694
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:51,987
Everybody wants all these high-tech...

695
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:55,552
...fiberglass, you know, no turbulence.

696
00:41:55,795 --> 00:41:57,763
Where's the fun in that ride?
I don't know.

697
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,865
- But they'll come around.
- Don't count on me. I get seasick.

698
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:02,329
- In the bathtub.
- Really?

699
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:03,763
Yeah.

700
00:42:04,737 --> 00:42:07,399
You know what?
Can we just skip all the small talk?

701
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:11,934
- What?
- Can we skip the small talk? Just skip it?

702
00:42:12,278 --> 00:42:14,838
You know, like, who are you?
Who am I?

703
00:42:15,014 --> 00:42:16,481
What are we doing here together?

704
00:42:16,816 --> 00:42:19,341
I have this theory that
when you first meet somebody...

705
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:22,146
...that's the time when
you have to be totally honest...

706
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:23,982
...because you have nothing to lose.

707
00:42:24,156 --> 00:42:26,317
5, 10 years down the road,
gets a lot harder.

708
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:29,052
You can't say one day,
"Happy anniversary, this is me."

709
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:31,458
It doesn't work that way. This is it.

710
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,191
We'll never see each other as clearly
and as nakedly as we do in this moment.

711
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:39,167
Right now. This instant. I'm really
scaring you right now, aren't I?

712
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,835
Just a little bit. Yeah.

713
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:44,271
But, you know, on the one hand...

714
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:48,174
...you're very charming and interesting
and you have a lot of energy.

715
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,644
You know, on the other hand,
a little bit scary.

716
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,144
Okay.

717
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:54,478
Here's my story.
Here's what you need to know.

718
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:56,177
Okay.

719
00:42:56,355 --> 00:42:58,846
I'm just divorced,
and I had my heart broken badly...

720
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:01,515
...by a woman that I really loved.

721
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:05,860
You know, but I think your heart
grows back bigger.

722
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:08,829
You know? Once you've got
the shit beat out of you.

723
00:43:09,034 --> 00:43:11,969
And the universe lets
your heart expand that way.

724
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:16,097
I think that's the function of all this pain
and heartache that we all go through.

725
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:20,142
You gotta go through that to come out
to a better place. And that's how I see it.

726
00:43:21,413 --> 00:43:23,973
What about you? Why is
a dazzling woman like you single?

727
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:30,021
You can do it.
You can just tell the truth.

728
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:32,589
If you know the truth.
What have we got to lose?

729
00:43:32,758 --> 00:43:36,489
After the dinner we shake hands,
"good night," never see each other again.

730
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:38,520
All right.

731
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,959
He stopped loving me.

732
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:47,834
I don't know what I did
or what I didn't do.

733
00:43:48,274 --> 00:43:49,935
He just stopped.

734
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:58,045
I don't think I've ever said
that out loud before.

735
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:05,687
See, we just had
an honest moment.

736
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:07,985
Now we can sit back
and enjoy our food...

737
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,957
...and get to know each other.
I'm Jake.

738
00:44:24,877 --> 00:44:26,640
- Condom?
- You don't have one?

739
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:29,007
- Why would I have one?
- For occasions like this.

740
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:31,376
There haven't been
any occasions like this.

741
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:34,052
- You didn't bring one?
- I didn't want to jinx it.

742
00:44:37,489 --> 00:44:40,117
This preschool of yours,
it's traditional? Developmental?

743
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:42,658
- Montessori?
- Yeah, yeah. All that. Drugstore!

744
00:44:58,944 --> 00:45:01,037
There's a Rite Aid on 93rd.
Hang a left.

745
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:03,408
- Should I take the freeway?
- Please turn left!

746
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:13,257
- Is this the fastest you can go?
- I could go faster, but we'd lift off.

747
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:20,164
- You drive.
- All right.

748
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:25,769
For big ones, you need five,
six coats of varnish.

749
00:45:25,971 --> 00:45:28,405
For the singles,
it's a little bit different.

750
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:30,541
There's one right there. Jackpot!

751
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:39,010
They're out!

752
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:43,053
- How can they be out?
- I don't know.

753
00:45:43,555 --> 00:45:45,318
But I have a theory.

754
00:45:45,557 --> 00:45:48,185
Everybody in the whole city
is having sex...

755
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,295
...at the exact same moment
except us.

756
00:45:52,898 --> 00:45:54,229
But we will press on.

757
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,447
What's wrong?

758
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,883
Well, the magic is gone a little.

759
00:46:23,963 --> 00:46:25,294
Okay.

760
00:46:25,464 --> 00:46:27,432
- I mean, I...
- No, no, I understand totally.

761
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,726
Look, you know.
There's other things we can do.

762
00:46:29,902 --> 00:46:33,167
I'd be happy just to stay with you
and look at you all night.

763
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,535
Yeah, I haven't done this
in a while. And...

764
00:46:36,742 --> 00:46:38,801
- And now you don't want to.
- Yeah.

765
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,172
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

766
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:43,879
That's all right. If the magic's gone,
that implies there was once magic.

767
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:45,573
Not bad for a first date.

768
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:48,879
- Second date.
- Second date. This is great.

769
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:51,112
- I had a great time.
- Me too.

770
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:53,553
So...

771
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,751
...good night.

772
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:04,568
- You still have to drive me home, though.
- Right. Because you don't live here.

773
00:47:06,972 --> 00:47:08,667
Hello.

774
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:12,709
Don't worry, it's just me. I'm in
the kitchen. Filled your freezer again.

775
00:47:12,945 --> 00:47:15,345
There's now enough meat
to feed every guy...

776
00:47:15,514 --> 00:47:17,914
...who answered your ad and still...

777
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:21,778
- Jake Anderson, my sister Carol.
- Hi.

778
00:47:22,221 --> 00:47:26,351
- Hi.
- Jake did, in fact, answer the ad.

779
00:47:26,525 --> 00:47:28,152
Do I get my meat?

780
00:47:30,696 --> 00:47:32,163
Thank you.

781
00:47:40,906 --> 00:47:43,272
Sorry to scare him away.

782
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:46,639
It's okay. I think we both realized
it wasn't going to happen tonight.

783
00:47:46,812 --> 00:47:48,939
What's the matter? He's so cute.

784
00:47:49,114 --> 00:47:53,175
I don't know. We had a great night.
Laughing, really talking.

785
00:47:53,352 --> 00:47:55,946
You had a guy talking
and you let him escape?

786
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:58,954
I'm not sure I actually understood
a lot of what he said.

787
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:00,658
Doesn't matter. He spoke.

788
00:48:00,826 --> 00:48:03,454
And are we talking full sentences here
or just grunting?

789
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:06,359
He's quite emotional.
I know more about him than Kevin.

790
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:09,729
An emotional man who likes to talk.

791
00:48:09,935 --> 00:48:13,371
- This is a mythical figure, Sarah.
- I don't think I'm ready for him.

792
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:16,872
He's looking for the whole dance
and I'm just relearning the steps.

793
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:20,773
What happened exactly?
Come on, tell me.

794
00:48:21,046 --> 00:48:22,638
- Leave nothing out.
- Okay.

795
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:25,249
We really connected
at the restaurant, like I said.

796
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:29,181
But then, where do you go from there?
How much baba ganoush can you have?

797
00:48:29,555 --> 00:48:32,456
Then we started making out,
which was like being in 11th grade.

798
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:36,320
Then neither one of us had a condom,
which I think reflects some ambivalence.

799
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:39,123
I'm just not cut out for this.
Life in the fast lane.

800
00:48:39,331 --> 00:48:42,357
Fast lane? You're not even
on the on-ramp.

801
00:48:42,534 --> 00:48:46,231
- But these people seem happy.
- Of course they do. They have a condom.

802
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:49,340
Marc and I couldn't find a condom once.
Wanna know what we used?

803
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:51,839
- No.
- Saran wrap.

804
00:48:52,144 --> 00:48:55,545
Thanks for that image which will
stay in my brain for the rest of my life.

805
00:48:55,714 --> 00:48:58,740
It was sexy in a Good Housekeeping
kind of way.

806
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:01,647
I'll never be able to wrap
leftovers again.

807
00:49:01,987 --> 00:49:04,080
- Did it work?
- Maeve was born nine months...

808
00:49:04,256 --> 00:49:05,655
...and one day later.

809
00:49:08,227 --> 00:49:11,560
I don't wanna just do random dating,
Carol. I wanna be in love.

810
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,290
I wanna wake up next to someone
and see them smile.

811
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:17,693
Do the whole Sunday breakfast thing,
go out and get the paper.

812
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,532
Stay in bed together all day.

813
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:22,939
Wouldn't we all?

814
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:33,816
Man, this is absolutely gorgeous. I love
this. I can't believe you built it yourself.

815
00:49:33,986 --> 00:49:35,920
Yeah, handcrafted. Hand-carved.

816
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:38,385
I hope you'll find
that it's more than a boat.

817
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:39,854
It's a time machine.

818
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:42,425
- I love it. I want it. I'll take it.
- Great.

819
00:49:42,794 --> 00:49:44,421
Did you race a lot in college?

820
00:49:44,596 --> 00:49:47,724
I don't plan to race it.
Could you cut it in half for me?

821
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:50,697
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, cut it in half lengthwise.

822
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:53,463
I think it would be easier
to mount on the wall that way.

823
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:55,038
You want to mount the boat?

824
00:49:55,207 --> 00:49:58,768
Yeah. I thought I'd put it in the den.
It'd look great above my big screen.

825
00:49:58,944 --> 00:50:02,607
You know, I think maybe you should go
to IKEA and buy a canoe.

826
00:50:03,015 --> 00:50:05,245
It's not for sale in that way.

827
00:50:05,517 --> 00:50:07,542
- He's kidding, right?
- Wouldn't that be nice.

828
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:09,710
I've had this dream
that it'll end up wet.

829
00:50:09,888 --> 00:50:13,255
It's just not for sale in that way
at this time. Ever, really.

830
00:50:13,425 --> 00:50:16,292
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
I really do want it.

831
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:19,555
Yeah, if I change my personality,
I'll let you know what I become.

832
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:22,231
- Okay.
- Thanks so much.

833
00:50:22,701 --> 00:50:24,498
- Nice guy.
- Stanley owes me a big favor.

834
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,570
- It was a guaranteed sale.
- So what?

835
00:50:26,738 --> 00:50:28,865
Right. You can afford to be picky.
You sold...

836
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:31,134
...let's see, no boats. No boats at all.

837
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,245
You worry too much.
You really do.

838
00:50:34,413 --> 00:50:37,314
You're in a good mood.
That must have been some date.

839
00:50:37,482 --> 00:50:39,347
Charlie, you should have
seen this girl.

840
00:50:39,685 --> 00:50:43,451
She's shy, she's fragile,
she's self-conscious.

841
00:50:43,622 --> 00:50:48,525
She has no idea how beautiful she is.
She's a mess. It's fantastic.

842
00:50:49,194 --> 00:50:52,357
The evening didn't end up great,
but there were moments in there...

843
00:50:52,531 --> 00:50:54,897
...where we were completely
and utterly ourselves.

844
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:58,036
I was completely psychotic,
but she was completely lovely.

845
00:50:58,203 --> 00:51:01,195
Are you thinking about completely
closing the sale any time soon?

846
00:51:01,373 --> 00:51:03,773
I tell you about a night
with an unusual woman...

847
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:06,103
...and you turn it
into a business transaction.

848
00:51:06,278 --> 00:51:08,007
We're not selling real estate here.

849
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,479
- And if we were selling real estate?
- We'd be in escrow this weekend.

850
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:23,218
I see Dad's not alone.

851
00:51:23,395 --> 00:51:25,295
Never. Not our Dad.

852
00:51:25,464 --> 00:51:27,955
I'm not calling any of them Mom,
I'll tell you that.

853
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:32,035
- What is the new one's name again?
- I believe that is Marlene.

854
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:34,365
There's a Linda,
but I don't think that's her.

855
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:36,530
- That's Dorothy.
- Well, who knew.

856
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,970
Hi there.

857
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:40,475
Aunt Eileen.

858
00:51:41,346 --> 00:51:43,940
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you, dear.

859
00:51:44,116 --> 00:51:47,085
You look fine too, considering.

860
00:51:47,252 --> 00:51:51,689
We never liked Kevin.
We couldn't say anything, but we knew.

861
00:51:51,857 --> 00:51:54,655
- That's so sweet.
- I hear you're not seeing anyone.

862
00:51:54,826 --> 00:52:00,389
Is that wise? With the clock ticking?
Because I have someone special for you.

863
00:52:00,565 --> 00:52:04,296
Casey Donovan.
Handsome, smart, single.

864
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,061
- Aunt Eileen.
- Yes?

865
00:52:06,238 --> 00:52:08,035
He's my first cousin.

866
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:11,871
This is a fine day for the Nolan family,
I tell you.

867
00:52:12,544 --> 00:52:13,977
For my son, Bill Jr.

868
00:52:17,716 --> 00:52:21,277
And young Ryan here,
the confirmation boy.

869
00:52:21,553 --> 00:52:24,454
And old Bill here.

870
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:30,490
I'd like to do a poem, if I may.

871
00:52:30,896 --> 00:52:33,091
To commemorate the occasion.

872
00:52:33,265 --> 00:52:34,698
Who do you think he'll go with?

873
00:52:34,866 --> 00:52:36,094
- Tennyson.
- Browning.

874
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:37,895
- Yeats.
- "Brown Penny."

875
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,334
By william Butler Yeats.

876
00:52:40,939 --> 00:52:42,804
Who knows her Daddy?

877
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,839
I whispered, "I am too young"

878
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:49,837
And then, "I am old enough"

879
00:52:50,415 --> 00:52:55,318
Wherefore I threw a penny
To find out if I might love.

880
00:52:55,487 --> 00:53:01,119
"Go and love, go and love, young man,
If the lady be young and fair."

881
00:53:01,426 --> 00:53:04,657
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny

882
00:53:05,297 --> 00:53:09,097
I am looped in the loops of her hair.

883
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:11,934
O love is the crooked thing

884
00:53:12,704 --> 00:53:15,138
There is nobody wise enough

885
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,174
To find out all that is in it

886
00:53:20,379 --> 00:53:25,476
For he would be thinking of love
Till the stars had run away

887
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:28,981
And the shadows eaten the moon.

888
00:53:29,888 --> 00:53:33,881
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny

889
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:38,259
One cannot begin it too soon.

890
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:51,271
- So good to see you, Aunt Eileen.
- It's always a pleasure.

891
00:53:51,443 --> 00:53:55,470
- Mother Teresa!
- Mother Teresa. No. Stop. Michael!

892
00:53:55,647 --> 00:53:57,979
It's okay. I don't mind.

893
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,914
- She doesn't mind.
- That's not the point.

894
00:54:01,086 --> 00:54:05,318
She actually likes dogs. And me.
She just forgets.

895
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,453
- Bye.
- Sarah. Darling.

896
00:54:07,626 --> 00:54:09,787
Some pressing business has come up...

897
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:12,987
...and I was hoping you'd ferry
Dolly home for me.

898
00:54:14,399 --> 00:54:17,562
- Okay. Sure, Dad.
- I don't mind staying.

899
00:54:17,736 --> 00:54:20,330
You're a sweetheart. Both of you.

900
00:54:26,878 --> 00:54:29,369
So, what do you think
of my competition?

901
00:54:30,582 --> 00:54:33,278
I don't really wanna discuss
my father's...

902
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:37,650
oh, it's okay. It's okay. I know.
A woman always knows.

903
00:54:38,657 --> 00:54:40,522
Not always.

904
00:54:42,694 --> 00:54:45,254
- Your guy go younger?
- Yeah.

905
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:47,227
They always go younger, don't they?

906
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:49,958
It does seem to trend that way,
doesn't it?

907
00:54:50,168 --> 00:54:53,467
When they're 8o, they want 60.
When they're 6o, they want 40.

908
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,833
When they're 8o, they want 40.
And they get it.

909
00:54:56,007 --> 00:54:57,565
Goddamn supply and demand.

910
00:54:57,742 --> 00:55:00,336
We ought to kill the guy
who thought that one up.

911
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,546
- So you didn't see it coming, huh?
- No, I thought we were happy.

912
00:55:05,717 --> 00:55:08,447
Maybe not "happy" happy,
but, you know, satisfied.

913
00:55:08,787 --> 00:55:11,347
I thought we were happy three times.

914
00:55:11,523 --> 00:55:13,286
Got a live one.

915
00:55:14,326 --> 00:55:16,487
You gotta come take a look at this.

916
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:20,789
I love this Internet.
It's part fantasy, part community.

917
00:55:20,966 --> 00:55:23,025
And you get to pay your bills naked.

918
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:25,431
They don't stress that enough
as a selling point.

919
00:55:25,604 --> 00:55:27,970
It's Jeremy in San Diego.

920
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:31,108
He thinks I'm 16.
He inverted the numbers in my age.

921
00:55:31,276 --> 00:55:34,370
- I didn't have the heart to tell him.
- That would've been cruel.

922
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:38,414
He comes to me for advice.
He thinks I'm very mature.

923
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,312
We're pinned.

924
00:55:40,952 --> 00:55:43,318
- You're on this, aren't you?
- PerfectMatch. Com.

925
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:45,456
- What, just one site?
- Yeah.

926
00:55:45,624 --> 00:55:48,115
Honey, you gotta put more bets
on the table.

927
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:51,820
I'm on at least 10. You get to try out
different personalities.

928
00:55:51,997 --> 00:55:53,294
Like here. I say:

929
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:58,960
"I'm into opera, antiques,
poetry in the original Greek."

930
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:01,696
And on this one:

931
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:06,105
"I like to skydive, ride motorcycles
and enjoy rodeo."

932
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:08,178
But you don't do any of those things.

933
00:56:08,346 --> 00:56:12,442
It's an ad. It's like those cars that say
they get 30 miles to the gallon.

934
00:56:12,617 --> 00:56:14,312
I mean, who knows.

935
00:56:14,753 --> 00:56:17,313
You just want someone
to take you out for a test drive.

936
00:56:17,489 --> 00:56:19,719
I'm not comfortable advertising myself
this way.

937
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:24,260
Honey, when you get to be my age
and approaching your expiration date...

938
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:28,456
...it pays to advertise.
This baby never sleeps.

939
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:34,765
It's working for me 24 hours a day,
God bless its little Pentium-chip heart.

940
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,238
So tell me about your ex.

941
00:56:37,542 --> 00:56:40,670
Kevin. He's a fireman.

942
00:56:40,946 --> 00:56:43,312
And cute. Very, very cute.

943
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:45,380
I have the calendars.

944
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,644
We met when I was dating
all my brothers' friends.

945
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,880
My first two husbands were friends
of my brother Dave.

946
00:56:52,524 --> 00:56:56,290
Both of them bastards.
But then, so was my brother Dave.

947
00:56:57,295 --> 00:57:00,458
Things seemed to be going according
to plan with me and Kevin.

948
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:05,068
We had our work, we got a house,
then it was time to have kids.

949
00:57:05,403 --> 00:57:06,802
But he was never ready.

950
00:57:06,972 --> 00:57:10,305
I was 34. Then 35, then 36.

951
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:14,636
Then instead of children, Kevin decided
to have Veronica. Ronnie.

952
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:17,611
Chatty as hell and 15 years younger.

953
00:57:17,983 --> 00:57:19,746
They got married two months ago.

954
00:57:23,054 --> 00:57:25,420
Did I mention that she's pregnant?

955
00:57:31,229 --> 00:57:32,992
Go get it.

956
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:37,833
Hey.

957
00:57:40,105 --> 00:57:43,700
- What are you doing in the real world?
- Dogsitting. My brother and his wife...

958
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:47,675
...are at marriage counseling. They don't
want her to know they're having trouble.

959
00:57:47,846 --> 00:57:49,177
You're a dog guy.

960
00:57:49,347 --> 00:57:52,839
You kidding me? I'm half Labrador.
Throw that ball. See who gets it.

961
00:57:53,952 --> 00:57:56,079
- I found him. I found the one I want!
- Austin.

962
00:57:56,254 --> 00:57:58,051
- I found my puppy!
- You did?

963
00:57:58,223 --> 00:58:00,623
- I'm getting a puppy!
- You are? That's amazing!

964
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:02,919
- It's so exciting!
- I'm so happy for you.

965
00:58:03,094 --> 00:58:06,689
- Let's go get him!
- We'll be right behind you, bubba.

966
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:11,325
- Thought it'd be good for him.
- Great idea. Yeah.

967
00:58:11,503 --> 00:58:13,971
I was gonna ask you
if you thought he was too young.

968
00:58:14,139 --> 00:58:16,505
- But it's a good age, right?
- I think so. Yes.

969
00:58:16,675 --> 00:58:18,540
- A boy needs a dog, right?
- Absolutely.

970
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,702
Who else is gonna eat
his vegetables for him?

971
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:26,674
I can't tell you what it means to me
that Austin's so happy in school.

972
00:58:26,985 --> 00:58:29,283
He's just lucky to have you in his life.

973
00:58:29,454 --> 00:58:30,682
We both are.

974
00:58:30,855 --> 00:58:36,452
I found him, Dad. I found my puppy.
Come on in, he wants to kiss you!

975
00:58:38,263 --> 00:58:40,891
Oh, I think you're gonna need
a bigger trailer.

976
00:58:49,974 --> 00:58:52,465
- Hello?
- So I know our dates aren't beginning...

977
00:58:52,644 --> 00:58:55,340
...or ending well,
but I find the middle intriguing.

978
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:59,072
- Well, it's not dull, is it?
- That's a good thing, right?

979
00:58:59,551 --> 00:59:03,078
So, what do you say?
You want to get together?

980
00:59:03,254 --> 00:59:06,121
You really want to give it
one more shot with me? Why?

981
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:09,556
Are you kidding me? You're this whole
new style, this whole new system.

982
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:11,286
Vivid grammar of eroticism.

983
00:59:11,463 --> 00:59:15,024
A completely unique constellation
of attributes. My Halley's comet.

984
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,633
Do you write this stuff down?

985
00:59:16,801 --> 00:59:18,792
No, that actually came out
of my head.

986
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:20,597
Sometimes I use notes.

987
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:24,473
Hold on. Someone's at the door.

988
00:59:26,044 --> 00:59:29,172
- Dolly, what a surprise.
- I'm in trouble, Sarah. I need help.

989
00:59:30,515 --> 00:59:33,916
Hello? Sarah, is everything okay? Sarah.

990
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:36,383
She can't talk now.
It's an emergency.

991
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:41,653
It's Jeremy from San Diego. He's here.

992
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:51,293
- I don't see why this is a problem.
- Well, for one thing, you are 17, and she's...

993
00:59:51,468 --> 00:59:53,663
- Forty-one.
- Yeah, but those are just numbers.

994
00:59:53,837 --> 00:59:55,862
Look at Justin Timberlake
and Cameron Diaz.

995
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:57,472
She's gotta be what, 100?

996
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,508
Oh, come on, Jeremy, be nice.
She's probably the same age as me.

997
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:04,911
Some people go their whole lives
looking for their soul mate.

998
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:07,413
And I found mine when I was 15.
Sue me.

999
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:10,246
Fifteen? You said you were 17.

1000
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:15,349
- Dude, it is so not cool to lie to me.
- I'm sorry.

1001
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:18,551
I didn't think you'd take me seriously
if you thought I was a kid.

1002
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:20,753
Of course I take you seriously.

1003
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:25,697
You're a wonderful boy, honey.
And we can always be friends.

1004
01:00:26,302 --> 01:00:29,328
But just friends. You know that.

1005
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:35,068
- Okay.
- And there's something else.

1006
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:38,408
I'm not really 41.

1007
01:00:40,683 --> 01:00:42,344
I'm 43.

1008
01:00:46,422 --> 01:00:48,322
Do your homework.

1009
01:00:57,133 --> 01:01:01,467
I couldn't bring myself to go over 50.
It wouldn't have been fair to him.

1010
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:05,798
- Good night.
- Night.

1011
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:09,411
- Thank you, Sarah.
- Anytime.

1012
01:01:32,602 --> 01:01:34,069
Sarah. Hi.

1013
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:36,899
I was in the trailer-hood.
I thought I might stop by.

1014
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:38,472
Oh, good.

1015
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:40,802
Sarah? Is that you?

1016
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:44,071
- Sarah! Hi!
- June?

1017
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:47,739
- I didn't know you were...
- No. This is good. We're all here.

1018
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:49,350
We can have a conference.

1019
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:54,183
Oh, I'll just go home now and go to bed
and maybe stay there forever.

1020
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:57,417
Sarah has a friend
who lives practically next door.

1021
01:01:57,594 --> 01:02:00,427
That's cool. I love weird,
huge coincidences.

1022
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,793
- Yeah.
- Sure you don't want to come in?

1023
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:04,331
We opened a bottle of wine.

1024
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,129
Oh, I think I'd rather die,
but thank you. Yeah.

1025
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:27,289
- Hi.
- Hey. Jennifer kicked us out.

1026
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:29,948
- Both of us.
- Oh, Mikey.

1027
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:32,424
God, I'm so sorry.

1028
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:35,827
- She'll come around.
- I told him it's the holidays.

1029
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:37,864
People are under a lot of stress.

1030
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:40,002
I love this guy. I do. I love him.

1031
01:02:40,169 --> 01:02:42,000
- I love him.
- We've been talking.

1032
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:44,036
We've been here a while.

1033
01:02:45,475 --> 01:02:47,238
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:02:47,477 --> 01:02:49,138
- Let's go.
- Come on, Mother Teresa.

1035
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:52,873
- I hope it's okay that I stopped by.
- Oh, yes. Of course it is.

1036
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:54,539
I'm so glad you did.

1037
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:57,379
We were talking on the phone,
everything was going well...

1038
01:02:57,553 --> 01:03:01,284
...and then some strange woman said
"emergency" and hung up.

1039
01:03:01,457 --> 01:03:04,221
I called and no one answered,
so I was a little worried.

1040
01:03:04,394 --> 01:03:06,988
- I think it's very sweet, Jake.
- It's just a false alarm?

1041
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:08,721
- Definitely a false alarm.
- Good.

1042
01:03:08,898 --> 01:03:12,334
No, my father's friend,
she got into a little bit of trouble...

1043
01:03:12,502 --> 01:03:15,630
...and I had to help her out,
and so I went over there for a while.

1044
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:20,071
And after that
I just drove around a while.

1045
01:03:20,243 --> 01:03:22,541
Alone. I was alone. And...

1046
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:24,680
- Yeah, alone by yourself, sure.
- Yeah.

1047
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:26,838
Well, anyway, the reason
I stopped by...

1048
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:29,246
...was I wanted to invite you out
on my boat.

1049
01:03:29,419 --> 01:03:31,819
- I don't think that's such a good idea.
- Yes, it is.

1050
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:33,751
No, because I...

1051
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,455
Boats are still on the water, right?

1052
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:39,891
I hope so, otherwise I wasted
a lot of time designing the hull.

1053
01:03:40,496 --> 01:03:42,657
Yeah, actually, they're aquatic.

1054
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:45,630
- Well, I don't even know how to row.
- I'll teach you.

1055
01:03:46,402 --> 01:03:50,429
- I'd love to teach you how to row.
- Okay. How?

1056
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:52,801
A challenge.

1057
01:03:53,776 --> 01:03:56,244
- We'll have a lesson right now. Okay?
- Okay.

1058
01:03:56,412 --> 01:04:00,314
So the thing about rowing
is just you gotta relax, first of all.

1059
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:04,681
And then it's all about rhythm,
balance...

1060
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:06,481
- Rhythm and balance.
... and timing.

1061
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:09,090
- Watch those oars, pal.
- Okay.

1062
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:12,792
- And rhythm and timing, see?
- Balance and rhythm.

1063
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:16,295
- See, it's not that bad, is it?
- No, I like rowing.

1064
01:04:16,466 --> 01:04:21,062
Then you want to make sure you get,
you know, your hair out of the way.

1065
01:04:27,009 --> 01:04:28,442
That's gotta hurt.

1066
01:04:29,512 --> 01:04:31,412
- Michael?
- You okay, pal?

1067
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:34,243
Oh, no. Don't stop what you're doing.
I was on my way out.

1068
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:35,714
Easy there, Tex.

1069
01:04:35,885 --> 01:04:38,376
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I just spoke to Jennifer.

1070
01:04:38,554 --> 01:04:41,284
Everything's great. I got the couch,
the dog's gonna stay.

1071
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:43,925
You should stay here too.
You shouldn't be driving.

1072
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:46,584
- I'll drive him home. Okay?
- Yeah.

1073
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:50,263
I thought we were gonna,
you know, row the boat.

1074
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,667
We will. Just stay exactly here
and stay exactly you...

1075
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:58,329
...and I'll be back in about 15
to 20 seconds depending on traffic.

1076
01:04:58,508 --> 01:05:01,500
Just hold that thought.
Where do you live?

1077
01:05:01,677 --> 01:05:06,080
Of course you realize when Jake
gets here, you'll have to excuse yourself.

1078
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:15,153
Bob! Bobby. No, Bob.

1079
01:05:15,324 --> 01:05:18,259
- You dropped these on my driveway.
- Oh, thank you.

1080
01:05:18,428 --> 01:05:21,955
I'm really sorry. I'm sure
that seemed pretty awkward, huh?

1081
01:05:22,131 --> 01:05:24,065
No, no. Routine, really.

1082
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:26,394
There's nothing going on
there with me and June.

1083
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:29,470
They were late from the museum,
and I made her stay for dinner.

1084
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:31,573
Well, thank you for bringing these...

1085
01:05:37,647 --> 01:05:40,673
- You're back.
- Yeah, he... He passed out.

1086
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:43,216
He couldn't tell me where he lived.

1087
01:05:43,386 --> 01:05:47,652
- 321 something.
- Yeah, that was all I got.

1088
01:05:48,257 --> 01:05:51,693
- I'm Bob, by the way.
- Oh, my manners have completely left me.

1089
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:54,694
- I'm so sorry. Jake Anderson.
- How you doing?

1090
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:57,628
- My brother Michael.
- Oh, sorry. Here you go.

1091
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,267
Pleasure to meet you.

1092
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:01,995
This is Bob Connor,
parent at the school.

1093
01:06:02,872 --> 01:06:06,205
We were just... what were we?

1094
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:10,004
Sarah left stuff at my place tonight,
thought it'd be better to get it back.

1095
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:11,646
I'll get out of the way.

1096
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:14,244
- Talk to you tomorrow, Sarah. Okay?
- Okay.

1097
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:17,813
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Pleasure.

1098
01:06:20,223 --> 01:06:23,989
Hey, I better get going.
Where do you want me to put him?

1099
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,060
- Maybe I'll put him here.
- No, you don't...

1100
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:27,753
we're sitting down now, buddy.

1101
01:06:29,765 --> 01:06:31,096
Yeah, I...

1102
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:34,236
- I better get going.
- You don't have to go. You could stay. Sit.

1103
01:06:35,805 --> 01:06:38,535
No, no, no. Really, I should go.

1104
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:45,043
Jake. Jake, please let me explain.

1105
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:46,681
- You don't have to.
- I want to.

1106
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:48,214
I don't have any claim on you.

1107
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:51,148
We've seen each other what,
four times now? I realize that.

1108
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,753
You won't let me explain?

1109
01:06:52,922 --> 01:06:57,052
Let me do it. You were lying because you
didn't want to hurt my feelings. I get it.

1110
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:16,074
If dogs are to prove their worth
as rescuers...

1111
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:19,874
...they must overcome their fears.
Again, Mass goes first.

1112
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:24,486
She's accustomed to the deafening noise
and turbulent winds of the helicopter.

1113
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:27,885
She's made these jumps
dozens of times before.

1114
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:30,753
But the big question is,
how will the rookies perform?

1115
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:33,054
You could do this. You could.

1116
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:35,527
They hesitate at the open door.

1117
01:07:45,408 --> 01:07:47,103
Hey, I'm gonna head out.

1118
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:51,542
- You forgot to take your headdress off.
- No, I didn't. Any plans for the holiday?

1119
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:53,944
Dad's house, a thousand relatives.
How about you?

1120
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:57,851
- Eric's parents are back in town.
- Now they're starting to piss me off.

1121
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:02,047
- Oh, honey, if you need to cry, call me.
- Got you on speed dial.

1122
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,621
Are we okay?

1123
01:08:06,796 --> 01:08:08,491
Sure. Why wouldn't we be?

1124
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:11,690
I had no idea you and Bobby were...

1125
01:08:11,867 --> 01:08:14,335
Oh, we're nothing, June. Me and Bobby.

1126
01:08:14,503 --> 01:08:16,698
Well, we're not either. Me and him.

1127
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,941
But he is one hot Dad, though.
I so don't blame you for being interested.

1128
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:22,668
"Interested" may be pushing it.

1129
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:27,282
Well, I'm not in that picture.
I just want you to know.

1130
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:36,289
I love Thanksgiving.
I'm so glad I'm not cooking.

1131
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:38,983
Watch your back.

1132
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:45,791
Now, before we tackle
this succulent-looking bird...

1133
01:08:45,968 --> 01:08:48,436
...we have some honored guests
with us today.

1134
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:52,040
Marlene Swift. Dorothy Murphy.

1135
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:54,199
And Dolly McCann.

1136
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:56,106
Hello, Dolly.

1137
01:08:56,579 --> 01:08:57,773
- Hi.
- Hey.

1138
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:02,114
All three at the same table.

1139
01:09:05,154 --> 01:09:07,645
The man has balls of steel.

1140
01:09:07,823 --> 01:09:09,552
We're very proud.

1141
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:18,526
This was a great idea. It's the perfect
place to spend Thanksgiving.

1142
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:21,295
- I'm just sorry my parents aren't here.
- Next year.

1143
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,662
You're not afraid
that'd be too sentimental?

1144
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,034
No. It's old family tradition.

1145
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:29,769
- They have a great Sunday brunch here too.
- Did I tell you she was a teacher?

1146
01:09:29,945 --> 01:09:32,140
Preschool. Works with kids.

1147
01:09:32,314 --> 01:09:35,283
- Tiny, tiny little kids. You want kids?
- Oh, yeah. I love kids.

1148
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:37,817
Want that white picket fence,
the whole deal.

1149
01:09:37,987 --> 01:09:40,683
She might've been the one. She's good.
She was interesting.

1150
01:09:40,856 --> 01:09:42,323
I caught a glimpse. Something.

1151
01:09:42,491 --> 01:09:45,392
You gotta stop obsessing
about the dog-park girl, Jake.

1152
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:46,687
- I know.
- Move on.

1153
01:09:46,862 --> 01:09:47,920
I will.

1154
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:51,294
This time you got written
out of Act 1. Women are devious.

1155
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:53,332
Self-serving, shallow.

1156
01:09:55,604 --> 01:09:57,231
Not you, dear.

1157
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:03,737
Okay. If casey Donovan's no good...

1158
01:10:03,913 --> 01:10:08,111
"If"? What do you mean, "if"?
His mother and my mother were sisters.

1159
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:11,215
- Ron Detmer?
- He's my optometrist.

1160
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:12,945
He's expecting your call.

1161
01:10:13,122 --> 01:10:16,023
How many fingers am I holding up?

1162
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:21,521
Sarah, great news.
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

1163
01:10:21,697 --> 01:10:24,495
But two guys in my office
just got divorced.

1164
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:26,828
- So much to be thankful for.
- Start with Richie.

1165
01:10:27,002 --> 01:10:28,731
If that doesn't work, go with Jerry.

1166
01:10:28,904 --> 01:10:32,169
- Richie first. Got it.
- Yeah, definitely go with Richie.

1167
01:10:37,012 --> 01:10:41,574
Better watch yourself. With those girls,
cleaning is a contact sport.

1168
01:10:45,988 --> 01:10:50,049
He's worth it, you know, your Dad.
Despite all his shenanigans.

1169
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:52,685
Besides, I'm having as much fun
as he is.

1170
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:54,423
Why don't I believe you?

1171
01:10:54,597 --> 01:11:00,092
Look, you care about someone, they're in
a lot of pain, you cut them some slack.

1172
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:03,870
I just thank God
he doesn't have a bigger table.

1173
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,141
Hello.

1174
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:19,246
One raised eyebrow.
Never a good sign.

1175
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:21,455
How do you remember
all their names, Dad?

1176
01:11:21,624 --> 01:11:24,149
Let alone birthdays
and religious affiliations?

1177
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:28,990
- I have it all on a disk. That way...
- I really don't want to know.

1178
01:11:30,566 --> 01:11:33,330
You're in different leagues, Dad.
You and Dolly.

1179
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:35,401
I think she's starting
to fall for you.

1180
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:37,698
- Well, I'm sorry if...
- No, you're not.

1181
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:40,899
Because being a man today means
never having to say you're sorry.

1182
01:11:41,076 --> 01:11:43,067
I resent how easy this all is for you.

1183
01:11:43,245 --> 01:11:45,873
You've got women coming and going,
cooking, cleaning.

1184
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:48,881
They're probably tuning up your car
for all I know.

1185
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:52,714
All that matters to you guys is the tushies
are tight and the bellies are flat.

1186
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:55,516
Meanwhile, caring, interesting,
compassionate women...

1187
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,454
...of a certain age sit home alone...

1188
01:11:57,626 --> 01:12:01,585
...reading Jane Austen, eating ice cream,
which makes them less likely to find...

1189
01:12:01,764 --> 01:12:05,530
Are we still talking about me?
Because I can't tell anymore.

1190
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:08,929
No, I'm sorry, Dad. I can't either.

1191
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:10,895
It's all right.

1192
01:12:11,073 --> 01:12:13,405
I just don't want to see Dolly get hurt.

1193
01:12:13,742 --> 01:12:15,733
I don't either.

1194
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:17,873
But it's different for me.

1195
01:12:19,748 --> 01:12:22,080
I've had the love of my life.

1196
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:25,548
And no one else
could ever touch that.

1197
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:27,946
No one can come close.

1198
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:32,923
So I'm just out there...

1199
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:34,289
...passing the time.

1200
01:12:34,463 --> 01:12:37,990
Tap-dancing, if you want the truth.

1201
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:41,935
Maybe if I dance fast enough...

1202
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:45,732
...I won't remember what I've lost.

1203
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:48,167
You see?

1204
01:13:00,189 --> 01:13:02,054
I'll be right there.

1205
01:13:03,058 --> 01:13:04,150
Hi, can I...?

1206
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:07,620
Look who's here. It's you.

1207
01:13:07,796 --> 01:13:09,354
Yes, your worst nightmare.

1208
01:13:09,531 --> 01:13:12,989
- The single-chicken-breast lady.
- You wanna at least hear the specials?

1209
01:13:13,736 --> 01:13:16,034
I'm supposed to tell them to you,
that's all.

1210
01:13:16,205 --> 01:13:17,832
Just the chicken breast.

1211
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,665
It's rough out there, huh?
You wanna talk about it?

1212
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:22,640
You know, you're not a bartender.

1213
01:13:23,212 --> 01:13:25,612
Have you tried the Internet?
I mean, it really works.

1214
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:30,445
- You know, I met my wife online, and she...
- chicken. Now.

1215
01:14:06,789 --> 01:14:08,689
Why not?

1216
01:14:11,894 --> 01:14:14,920
And I've been to Italy a lot too.
I just got back from Rome...

1217
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:19,727
...where I took this fabulous in-depth
tour called "As the Romans Do."

1218
01:14:19,902 --> 01:14:24,032
- The guide was incredible.
- I took that tour. Big fat guy, right?

1219
01:14:24,206 --> 01:14:26,572
Before that, Switzerland.
I got caught in a storm.

1220
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:30,178
- I almost died in a blizzard once.
- I lived up in the Alps for a year.

1221
01:14:30,346 --> 01:14:32,610
They had to cut me out
of the snow with scissors.

1222
01:14:32,781 --> 01:14:36,774
My aunt had a farm. In the morning, we'd
warm ourselves with the coals of the fire.

1223
01:14:36,952 --> 01:14:39,443
I learned to make goat cheese.
It was very Heidi.

1224
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:49,593
Well, I just think it's wonderful how much
you care about your children, Peter. Really.

1225
01:14:49,765 --> 01:14:52,529
It's not always the case.
I'm a teacher, I know.

1226
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:56,034
Well, it's just my daughter. She's 14.

1227
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:58,600
But she's everything to me.

1228
01:15:12,287 --> 01:15:15,120
- Were you surprised that I called?
- Little bit.

1229
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:16,814
But happy.

1230
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:19,452
Well, I figured what the hell.

1231
01:15:19,628 --> 01:15:22,961
It's time to take control of my life.
New Sarah.

1232
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:28,864
- I liked the old Sarah, you know.
- New and improved.

1233
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,250
- Good morning.
- Hi.

1234
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:24,722
Hi.

1235
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:30,360
- What time is it?
- It's a little after 9.

1236
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,927
Damn.

1237
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:39,131
Do you mind if we take that and go?
I don't wanna run into traffic.

1238
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:43,108
- Oh, it's Sunday.
- Yeah, I got a game today.

1239
01:16:47,749 --> 01:16:51,515
- You gonna eat that?
- No. Here.

1240
01:16:52,888 --> 01:16:54,412
Thank you.

1241
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:58,516
You did sleep with June, didn't you?

1242
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:05,559
Does it matter? Really?

1243
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,293
It's just that you told me
nothing happened.

1244
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:12,497
I knew we'd be great together, I didn't
want anything to get in the way of that.

1245
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:15,070
And we were.

1246
01:17:17,379 --> 01:17:18,778
Yeah.

1247
01:17:33,395 --> 01:17:36,489
That was fun. Thanks a lot.
I'll call you.

1248
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:41,934
- You mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

1249
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:45,801
- Good, I was afraid something had...
- I'm mad at myself for trusting you.

1250
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:48,135
For not listening
to that voice that said:

1251
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:52,940
"He is a shallow, self-centered bastard."
Which is what you are, you stupidhead!

1252
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:57,041
Maybe I have been teaching preschool
too long, but you took advantage of me.

1253
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:00,814
You knew how vulnerable I was.
I was the weak impala of the herd.

1254
01:18:00,989 --> 01:18:04,447
And you pounced on that with that whole
sensitive Dad-of-the-Year act.

1255
01:18:04,626 --> 01:18:06,560
And, "we're adopting a puppy."

1256
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:09,288
And the fake professor thing
with these fake glasses.

1257
01:18:09,464 --> 01:18:11,432
These aren't even real,
are they?

1258
01:18:14,102 --> 01:18:15,797
Sorry.

1259
01:18:16,605 --> 01:18:20,632
I just hate guys like you.
I hate guys like you!

1260
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:54,833
But this is a good look for you, Sarah.

1261
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:58,946
You've gone beyond pajamas
and are now wearing the bed.

1262
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:03,216
Oh, God. I just went after
the wrong guy again. Like always.

1263
01:19:03,385 --> 01:19:06,377
I slept with a man
who's not my husband.

1264
01:19:06,855 --> 01:19:08,516
I'm promiscuous.

1265
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:11,658
We should redo your profile
and put that in it.

1266
01:19:14,763 --> 01:19:18,460
Oh, God. I'm a complete
and total love failure.

1267
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:24,238
- Oh, no.
- Stop it, it's not that funny.

1268
01:19:24,406 --> 01:19:25,873
Stop laughing.

1269
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:29,204
What about that cute guy I met?
Condom man.

1270
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:32,575
- Yes, that's how he likes to be known.
- Condom man?

1271
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:36,616
- Sounds like a superhero.
- I can't.

1272
01:19:36,785 --> 01:19:40,380
He hates me. And I don't blame him.

1273
01:19:40,622 --> 01:19:43,614
No, I had my chance with him,
and I blew it.

1274
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,221
Let's go watch Beaches.

1275
01:19:49,398 --> 01:19:51,298
Oh, my God.

1276
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:00,031
When they remake this, they gotta
add a happy ending and nudity.

1277
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:04,110
They won't remake it. Nobody wants
to watch this kind of yearning nowadays.

1278
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:05,837
It's too painful.

1279
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,380
- Modern man can't take it.
- This has gotta end.

1280
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:10,415
There's a world beyond Zhivago- land.

1281
01:20:10,585 --> 01:20:12,780
Forget about the dog-park girl
and live again.

1282
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,418
You think your friend still wants
to buy my boat?

1283
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:17,524
Let him chop it up,
stick it on his wall.

1284
01:20:17,793 --> 01:20:21,126
- Call him.
- Seriously?

1285
01:20:21,463 --> 01:20:26,162
Tell him to come by the boat basin
this weekend. I'll row it down myself.

1286
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:30,702
And call some of those insane,
pansexual girls you're so fond of.

1287
01:20:30,872 --> 01:20:33,932
I want a date every day
until Christmas.

1288
01:20:38,013 --> 01:20:41,574
- Where have you been all my life?
- Waiting for you.

1289
01:20:47,122 --> 01:20:50,250
You are absolutely perfect.
You know that, don't you?

1290
01:20:50,425 --> 01:20:52,950
I do. But it's still nice to hear.

1291
01:20:53,495 --> 01:20:55,793
Hello, hello. Hi.

1292
01:20:56,331 --> 01:20:58,356
Look at you, cute jammies.

1293
01:20:58,533 --> 01:21:02,731
Already in them, a little early for that.
Come on, have a seat.

1294
01:21:03,305 --> 01:21:05,034
Eric, come on.

1295
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,665
All right. Now...

1296
01:21:07,843 --> 01:21:10,903
...Eric and I are here to cheer you up,
and we have many options.

1297
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:12,307
I'm ready.

1298
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:16,247
First, there's line dancing at the Grove.
Very Southwest, mid-80's.

1299
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:18,511
- Too gay.
- Or...

1300
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:22,123
...we can use these
teacher gift certificates...

1301
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:25,020
...for midnight manicures.
- Perfect. Can we do that?

1302
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:27,658
- That's not too gay?
- No.

1303
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:30,422
He keeps the mystery alive,
doesn't he?

1304
01:21:34,035 --> 01:21:35,832
What color?

1305
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:38,436
White. Caucasian.

1306
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:41,269
What color nail? After wax.

1307
01:21:43,678 --> 01:21:46,977
- I don't know. What do you think?
- Your nail, not mine.

1308
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:49,273
The light pink one. Yeah.

1309
01:21:50,352 --> 01:21:52,343
Not much love life, huh?

1310
01:21:53,088 --> 01:21:54,487
Not getting younger.

1311
01:21:59,027 --> 01:22:00,289
Did you hear that?

1312
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:03,022
What is that? Why do I always get
the surly manicurist?

1313
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:06,326
I don't know. Does a good job, right?

1314
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:08,696
Oh, my God.

1315
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,236
Oh, my God.

1316
01:22:16,711 --> 01:22:18,338
I'll be right back.

1317
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:25,213
Jake!

1318
01:22:25,387 --> 01:22:27,685
- Jake!
- Sarah.

1319
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:30,984
- Jake! Hi.
- Hi.

1320
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:35,186
This is so weird, because I've been
thinking about you so much.

1321
01:22:35,363 --> 01:22:39,060
Nice to see you. Oh, you're all...
You look like...

1322
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:42,028
I keep thinking about you.

1323
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:45,537
What do they call those?
Pot sticker, with the potholders.

1324
01:22:46,475 --> 01:22:49,535
Hi. I'm ready, Jake.
Sorry I took so long.

1325
01:22:49,711 --> 01:22:51,736
Hi. I'm Sherry.

1326
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,904
- Hi.
- This is Sarah.

1327
01:22:54,249 --> 01:22:56,911
- We just saw Doctor Zhivago at the Grand.
- Yeah.

1328
01:22:57,085 --> 01:23:00,680
- Doctor Zhivago.
- It's Jake's favorite movie.

1329
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:04,451
- I didn't get it.
- Oh, I've seen it like 20 times.

1330
01:23:04,626 --> 01:23:05,650
- Really?
- Really?

1331
01:23:05,827 --> 01:23:09,092
- Yeah.
- Why? It's so depressing.

1332
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:11,425
Everybody's freezing their asses off.

1333
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,898
- They're communists, right?
- Yeah.

1334
01:23:14,135 --> 01:23:17,832
I guess I keep hoping that one time,
Lara and Yuri will get together again.

1335
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:21,442
In the springtime, preferably.
And wear shorts.

1336
01:23:23,078 --> 01:23:25,444
Okay, but they can't,
because it's just a movie.

1337
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:31,049
- It's a book too.
- Yeah, that's cruel.

1338
01:23:31,353 --> 01:23:32,843
Yeah.

1339
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:35,422
Anyway...

1340
01:23:37,592 --> 01:23:39,856
Thanks for bringing that up.

1341
01:23:43,164 --> 01:23:45,792
Okay, I have to go get de-waxed.

1342
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:48,532
Sarah, it was really nice
seeing you again.

1343
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:53,102
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1344
01:23:53,275 --> 01:23:55,334
Not again.

1345
01:23:55,644 --> 01:23:57,976
Yes. Thank...

1346
01:23:58,647 --> 01:24:00,672
Yeah. Bye.

1347
01:24:01,049 --> 01:24:05,008
- Do you want to be Russians tonight?
- Let's go.

1348
01:24:29,978 --> 01:24:32,173
Well, Sherry, I think I'm gonna say
good night.

1349
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:35,576
- You're not coming in?
- No, I'm kind of tired.

1350
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:38,844
- I'm gonna go home.
- Aren't we gonna do the Russian thing?

1351
01:24:42,057 --> 01:24:44,491
That's Russian for "no."

1352
01:24:44,659 --> 01:24:48,857
- Was it something that I did...?
- No, no, no. I'm just really tired.

1353
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:52,488
- Tired. Yeah, it was a long movie.
- Really long.

1354
01:24:58,373 --> 01:24:59,806
Bye.

1355
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:05,705
It seemed like it
was gonna be so perfect.

1356
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:09,316
You chase him down the street,
he turns, he sees you...

1357
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:12,476
...he takes you in his arms,
fireworks explode.

1358
01:25:13,221 --> 01:25:14,688
It's happily ever after.

1359
01:25:14,856 --> 01:25:17,620
You're leaving out the part
where he was with another woman.

1360
01:25:17,792 --> 01:25:19,020
I say you call him.

1361
01:25:19,194 --> 01:25:22,686
Or better yet, go over there, break into
his house, throw yourself at him...

1362
01:25:22,864 --> 01:25:25,332
...make a complete fool of yourself.
It worked for me.

1363
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,536
- It was very effective.
- No, he's with someone else.

1364
01:25:29,871 --> 01:25:33,238
I have to face it, it's just not
gonna work out with us.

1365
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:36,075
And you'd really like it to,
wouldn't you?

1366
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,775
I can't take this.
This is breaking my heart.

1367
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:43,884
Mine too.
But let's look on the bright side.

1368
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:45,679
- Your nails look fabulous.
- They do.

1369
01:25:45,987 --> 01:25:48,217
They look so good. Let me see those.

1370
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:50,949
- Look at these hands.
- Thank you, guys.

1371
01:25:57,465 --> 01:26:00,093
Turn around, this is your favorite part.

1372
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:05,696
She's wearing that hat you like.

1373
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:17,579
That's my side, thank you very much.

1374
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:20,520
Mother Teresa.

1375
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,421
I love you too.

1376
01:26:44,713 --> 01:26:46,078
You like her?

1377
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:48,147
- She's a handsome boat.
- Yeah.

1378
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:50,716
Reminds one of the longboats
they would run...

1379
01:26:50,885 --> 01:26:53,445
...out of the sweet harbor at Bantry Bay.

1380
01:26:53,621 --> 01:26:57,955
Actually, I designed this one based
on a Portuguese boat.

1381
01:26:58,126 --> 01:26:59,923
But historically, you're correct, yeah.

1382
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:02,290
- You built this boat yourself?
- Yes, sir.

1383
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:04,193
- You build boats?
- No, no.

1384
01:27:04,365 --> 01:27:07,027
Truth be told, I don't know
the first thing about them.

1385
01:27:07,202 --> 01:27:10,228
- But I do appreciate a work of art.
- Well, thank you, sir.

1386
01:27:10,405 --> 01:27:14,341
I'm about to sell this work of art to a guy
who's gonna cut it in half...

1387
01:27:14,509 --> 01:27:16,340
...and stick it on his wall.
- Oh, no.

1388
01:27:16,511 --> 01:27:20,504
Yeah. I'm about to take her out for a last
paddle before I meet the butcher at noon.

1389
01:27:20,682 --> 01:27:22,377
Why would you do a thing like that?

1390
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:25,951
It's a long story. Something about
the violation of expectations...

1391
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:29,682
...and a crushing loss of faith
in love and life and art.

1392
01:27:29,858 --> 01:27:31,883
- So it's a girl.
- Yes.

1393
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,958
I've had a little girl trouble
myself lately.

1394
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:38,861
But better to have loved
and lost. Am I right?

1395
01:27:39,033 --> 01:27:41,661
She was a unique constellation
of attributes.

1396
01:27:41,836 --> 01:27:44,304
She was my Halley's comet.

1397
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:47,032
But... Universe is designed
to break your heart, yes?

1398
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:51,474
A philosopher as well as an artist.
Yes, it's we who suffer most.

1399
01:27:51,646 --> 01:27:55,343
Yes. With the possible exception
being the victims of violent crime.

1400
01:27:56,351 --> 01:28:00,720
- Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- No, no, pleasure's all mine. Jake.

1401
01:28:00,889 --> 01:28:03,517
- Bill. I have a daughter who would...
- No, no.

1402
01:28:03,691 --> 01:28:05,556
Never mind. No, no. Sorry.

1403
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:16,732
Well, this is a surprise.

1404
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:20,636
Can't a father pay a visit to his daughter
on a beautiful Sunday morning?

1405
01:28:20,809 --> 01:28:24,404
Carol called you, didn't she? She's afraid
I'm getting into my pajamas again.

1406
01:28:24,579 --> 01:28:28,242
Actually, Carol called Christine,
Christine called Michael...

1407
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,884
...Michael called me.
- Any word from Aunt Eileen?

1408
01:28:31,052 --> 01:28:34,112
She said to tell you that
Casey Donovan was adopted.

1409
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:35,847
If that helps.

1410
01:28:36,024 --> 01:28:38,959
Well, at this point, he's starting
to look awfully good.

1411
01:28:39,394 --> 01:28:41,419
He's out there, Sarah.

1412
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:45,632
Someone who would appreciate
all you have to offer.

1413
01:28:47,502 --> 01:28:51,199
After all, you're this unique
constellation of attributes.

1414
01:28:51,372 --> 01:28:53,636
- You're Halley's comet...
- what did you just say?

1415
01:28:54,275 --> 01:28:56,675
It's a nice turn of phrase,
but it's not my own.

1416
01:28:56,845 --> 01:28:59,541
I heard it from a young man
I met this morning.

1417
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:01,409
Builds beautiful Irish boats.

1418
01:29:02,016 --> 01:29:06,146
Poor lad. Had his heart broken
by a woman he deeply cared about.

1419
01:29:06,788 --> 01:29:08,278
Deeply.

1420
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:12,716
- Jake. Jake!
- Hello there.

1421
01:29:12,894 --> 01:29:17,831
Hi. Hi, I'm looking for Jake.
Jake Anderson. Is he here?

1422
01:29:17,999 --> 01:29:21,298
- No, he isn't. But lucky for us, I am.
- I don't have time for this.

1423
01:29:21,469 --> 01:29:24,563
- Do you know where he is?
- You're "must love dogs," aren't you?

1424
01:29:24,739 --> 01:29:27,264
You've already crushed him,
he's been moping for weeks.

1425
01:29:27,442 --> 01:29:29,569
He's even given up
the whole wooden-boat thing.

1426
01:29:29,744 --> 01:29:31,609
- You've done enough.
- That's all wrong.

1427
01:29:31,779 --> 01:29:33,644
I have to talk to him. Where is he?

1428
01:29:33,848 --> 01:29:35,782
- I can't tell you that.
- Where is he?

1429
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:37,747
I'm not telling you.

1430
01:29:39,153 --> 01:29:41,087
You know the bridge
by the boat ramp?

1431
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:51,129
Jake?

1432
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:54,125
Jake.

1433
01:29:54,903 --> 01:29:56,632
Jake!

1434
01:30:05,179 --> 01:30:08,740
- I'd like to rent a boat, please.
- I'm sorry, we're all out of boats.

1435
01:30:14,055 --> 01:30:16,990
- All right, come on.
- Oh, a love chase.

1436
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:19,126
Come on, girl, you can do this.

1437
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:22,730
This is really important to me.
Come on.

1438
01:30:23,197 --> 01:30:24,721
I think he could be the one.

1439
01:30:25,366 --> 01:30:26,833
Come on, girls, let's get going.

1440
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:30,500
Push! Push!

1441
01:30:31,406 --> 01:30:34,569
Push! Push!

1442
01:30:34,742 --> 01:30:37,210
Push, push!

1443
01:30:37,378 --> 01:30:42,179
Push! Push! Push!

1444
01:30:42,483 --> 01:30:44,383
- Push!
- Push!

1445
01:30:44,552 --> 01:30:46,713
That's him. I see him!

1446
01:30:46,888 --> 01:30:49,857
Jake! Jake!

1447
01:30:53,227 --> 01:30:55,218
Stop the boat!

1448
01:30:55,563 --> 01:30:57,224
Never mind.

1449
01:31:01,169 --> 01:31:02,898
Okay, girl, here we go.

1450
01:31:03,071 --> 01:31:04,902
Jake!

1451
01:31:15,316 --> 01:31:17,341
Here she goes!

1452
01:31:21,856 --> 01:31:23,380
Jake.

1453
01:31:23,891 --> 01:31:25,688
What are you doing?

1454
01:31:26,894 --> 01:31:29,454
All right. Here we go.
All the way up. Almost.

1455
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:34,031
- Come on, girl.
- Come on.

1456
01:31:34,202 --> 01:31:35,965
- Good girl, you can do it.
- Here we go.

1457
01:31:36,137 --> 01:31:38,162
- Watch your paws there.
- Easy, easy.

1458
01:31:43,378 --> 01:31:47,075
Cold. Cold. Very cold.

1459
01:31:49,484 --> 01:31:50,951
Here we go.

1460
01:31:53,254 --> 01:31:54,516
Thank you.

1461
01:31:56,257 --> 01:31:58,452
Was there something you wanted
to say to me?

1462
01:31:59,093 --> 01:32:00,617
Yes.

1463
01:32:00,795 --> 01:32:02,387
Could have just called.

1464
01:32:02,563 --> 01:32:05,396
Perhaps that would have been
the wiser course, yes.

1465
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,392
What's up?

1466
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:12,562
I owe you my story.
You asked me for honesty...

1467
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:16,176
...and it scared the hell out of me,
and I held back...

1468
01:32:16,344 --> 01:32:18,904
...and I didn't want to let you
see the real me.

1469
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,674
Because I was afraid
of getting hurt again.

1470
01:32:22,517 --> 01:32:26,920
But, listen, I hear that the universe
lets your heart expand...

1471
01:32:27,088 --> 01:32:30,717
...and grow back even bigger
after you go through all that pain.

1472
01:32:30,892 --> 01:32:34,293
Well, I believe that now.

1473
01:32:34,462 --> 01:32:37,488
And I was just wishing
there was a way that...

1474
01:32:37,698 --> 01:32:40,997
...I could have another chance
to make this work.

1475
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:52,808
I'll be right with you.

1476
01:32:53,247 --> 01:32:55,477
Hi, how can I...?

1477
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:56,947
Don't worry, I got it.

1478
01:32:57,118 --> 01:33:00,246
Single chicken breast, no dating advice,
coming right up.

1479
01:33:00,421 --> 01:33:03,322
Actually, I would like to have
three whole fryers, please.

1480
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:06,517
And six pork chops and a lamb shank.

1481
01:33:06,694 --> 01:33:09,026
And do you have any dog bones
back there?

1482
01:33:10,531 --> 01:33:14,228
If you do, throw them in the cart.
What are the specials today?

1483
01:33:14,735 --> 01:33:15,861
Yes.

1484
01:33:27,215 --> 01:33:28,682
Thank you.

1485
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:35,846
How many people
are actually in this family?

1486
01:33:38,893 --> 01:33:40,622
- Hey.
- Hey.

1487
01:33:40,795 --> 01:33:42,262
Get down.

1488
01:33:44,732 --> 01:33:46,029
Down!

1489
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:11,418
How did we meet?

1490
01:34:11,592 --> 01:34:14,322
- Oh, that's a great story. Tell it, hon.
- Great story.

1491
01:34:14,495 --> 01:34:18,056
Well, actually,
it's a very romantic story.

1492
01:34:18,232 --> 01:34:20,291
- You tell it, Carol.
- No, go ahead, honey.

1493
01:34:20,468 --> 01:34:23,699
No, no, really, you should.
She tells this story great.

1494
01:34:24,772 --> 01:34:26,501
You don't remember, do you?

1495
01:34:27,775 --> 01:34:30,801
Don't remember? How we met?

1496
01:34:37,351 --> 01:34:39,444
I don't remember.

1497
01:34:40,321 --> 01:34:42,414
But I love her.

1498
01:34:43,524 --> 01:34:44,752
I love her!

1499
01:34:44,926 --> 01:34:47,326
Love is not reserved for the young,
you know.

1500
01:34:47,662 --> 01:34:48,822
As the poet said:

1501
01:34:48,996 --> 01:34:51,658
Grow old along with me!
The best is yet to be

1502
01:34:51,832 --> 01:34:53,163
- Yeats?
- No.

1503
01:34:53,334 --> 01:34:55,529
- Tennyson?
- No.

1504
01:34:55,703 --> 01:34:57,933
- Browning.
- Browning.

1505
01:34:58,105 --> 01:34:59,868
Who knows her Daddy?

1506
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:04,068
Oh, my gosh, I did not think
I was ready to settle down...

1507
01:35:04,312 --> 01:35:06,906
...but look at the size of this rock.

1508
01:35:07,081 --> 01:35:10,847
And you want to know what else?
I'm gonna get a cute little tattoo...

1509
01:35:11,018 --> 01:35:13,578
...in someplace that's
N-O-N of your business.

1510
01:35:13,754 --> 01:35:16,951
And wanna know what it's gonna say?

1511
01:35:17,358 --> 01:35:20,259
"Mrs. Casey Donovan."

1512
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:24,725
The best place to meet someone...

1513
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:28,494
...is Parseghian's Armenian restaurant
in Koreatown.

1514
01:35:28,669 --> 01:35:31,001
I don't care if you're young,
you're old...

1515
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:33,140
...you're single, you're divorced...

1516
01:35:34,475 --> 01:35:35,464
I'm getting there.

1517
01:35:36,911 --> 01:35:39,709
7100 First Street.

1518
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,678
Wednesday, mother-in-law night.

1519
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:44,408
All she can eat.

1520
01:35:48,856 --> 01:35:51,222
- In a dog park.
- Dog park, yeah.

1521
01:35:51,559 --> 01:35:52,924
- It's true.
- I know.

1522
01:35:53,094 --> 01:35:54,618
I was very... I was nervous.

1523
01:35:54,795 --> 01:35:58,526
We had no idea at the time
that we could ever wind up...

1524
01:35:58,699 --> 01:36:00,223
oh, that's not true. I did.

1525
01:36:00,401 --> 01:36:01,925
- You did not.
- I did too.

1526
01:36:02,103 --> 01:36:04,663
- I have a theory about this.
- He has lots of theories.

1527
01:36:04,839 --> 01:36:07,239
I do. This is actually a good one.
I took some notes.

1528
01:36:07,408 --> 01:36:09,308
Oh, God, you're so prepared for this.

1529
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:11,341
You grow up, you're an adult, right?

1530
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:15,243
And you think you have all this worldly
experience, right? That's point A.

1531
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:17,646
You think your personality is formed.

1532
01:36:17,885 --> 01:36:19,682
And then you think you're complete...

1533
01:36:19,854 --> 01:36:22,414
...but you meet somebody,
you start feeling new things.

1534
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:24,990
And you start feeling
excruciatingly painful things.

1535
01:36:25,226 --> 01:36:28,855
You get confused, right?
You get nauseous.

1536
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:33,262
And I think when you get really nauseous,
like that, it's, like, the completion of self.

1537
01:36:33,434 --> 01:36:36,130
The person who can fill the final void.

1538
01:36:36,337 --> 01:36:38,328
That's what it was like
when I met Sarah.

1539
01:36:38,506 --> 01:36:41,737
- I made you nauseous.
- In a good way. I was lovesick.

1540
01:36:43,344 --> 01:36:45,244
That was good, honey.

1541
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,097
