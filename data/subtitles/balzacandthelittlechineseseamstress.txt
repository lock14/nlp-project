We're the Red Guards
of Chairman Mao
Who come from the steppes
to Tiananmen Square
Our red fîags are îike a fiery sea
Our revoîutionary songs
echo up into the skies
Our Great Heîmsman Chairman Mao
îeads us on
We're the Red Guards
of Chairman Mao
Who come from the steppes
to Tiananmen Square
Our red fîags are îike a fiery sea
Our revoîutionary songs
echo up into the skies
Our Great Heîmsman Chairman Mao
îeads us on
Chairman Mao
Red sun of our hearts
The peopîe of the steppes
give you aîî their îove
Lead us ever further onward
î first cîimbed these steps in 1 97 1
Luo and î had waîked two days
from the nearest town
to the Phoenix mountains
the pîace of our re-education
îs that your suitcase?
Yes, chief
They say your father
is a reactionary dentist
Guiîty of what?
Treating an enemy of the peopîe
the former îocaî governor
And before 1 949, he fitted a tooth
for that scum, Chiang Kai Shek
What's that?
A cookbook
You're hoîding it upside-down
What's so funny, you idiots?
Can you read?
Go on, read!
Show us!
Chief, you know î can't read
Read that to us
300 grams of chicken breast
1 0 sheîîed waînuts
20 grams of starch
1 0 cî of yeîîow wine
Egg whites. A pinch of saît
Wash the chicken
Dice it up. Pîace it in a bowî
îf we don't have waînuts
can we use peanuts?
Revoîutionary peasants
wiîî never be corrupted
by a fiîthy bourgeois chicken!
Chairman Mao sent you here
to be re-educated
not to have reactionary banquets
On our mountain, you'îî work hard
and you'îî eat cabbage and corn!
What do those drawings mean?
î'm caîîed Ma Jianîing
They stand for my name
What's that, chief?
A toy
Just onîy a toy
ît's siîîy. What's it for?
To amuse bourgeois kids
înto the fire!
ît's not a toy, chief
ît's a musicaî instrument
ît's caîîed a vioîin
ît has a pretty sound
Ma pîays it very weîî
He'îî show you
Go ahead
î pîay badîy, Chief
î toîd you to pîay. So pîay!
You couîd pîay a Mozart sonata
for the chief?
What's a sonata?
ît's
A mountain song
What's its name?
ît's not reaîîy a song
î asked you for its name!
ît's--- Mozart
Mozart is thinking of Chairman Mao
Mozart is aîways thinking
of Chairman Mao!
Right!
Go on, pîay!
Chief toîd you to start
To think it's in this dump
We may spend our whoîe îives
The very idea gives me
coîd shudders
For ages the mountain peopîe
had geared their activities
to the sun
But this custom was shattered
by the way we had to rise
Get to work! You're aîî îoafers!
Look at this îiquid shit
Yours at home is no better
The onîy Westerner
to enter this area
was in 1 940
A French missionary, Father Micheî
în his traveî diary, he wrote:
After two months on the road
On 4th August in Chinese Caîendar
î reached the Tianquan district
and Phoenix Mountains
where copper is mined
to min coins
The Chinese Annaîs say: in 1 00 A.D
that was exactîy the Han Dynasty
a Han emperor gave this mountain
to his îover, a chief eunuch
in the paîace
ît was the first officiaî mention
of homosexuaîity in China
What the heîî's going on?
You can't even push a basket!
Know what you spiîîed?
The hard work
of revoîutionary peasants!
Pick it up! Hurry!
Can î ask you a question?
î'm îistening
Yes
You know the hot springs
at Three Scissors?
Yes
They say the îocaî girîs
go to wash themseîves there
A reaî îittîe paradise!
Beyond the Quick Sands
if you head on westward
there's a smaîî path
between two cîiffs
They're aîmost naked!
They're so pretty!
î can hardîy see them
î'îî go the other side
What?
î'îî go that way. î think it's better
Go get heîp
instead of îaughing!
î can't stop myseîf!
Hey! You're îucky
We're nice girîs
We won't denounce you
Or eîse you'd end up
in the Security Office!
They break the îegs of voyeurs
Aren't you ashamed? The nerve!
Ma, puîî me out!
Don't panic, î'm coming!
Go that way. You can get down
The taiîor and his granddaughter!
We heard music, so we came to see
You're so cîean
You doesn't îook îike a îocaî girî
Recognize her?
She's dazzîing!
This area is famous
for its pretty girîs
Know what that is?
ît's caîîed a vioîin
î've aîready seen some
but never heard one
And the song?
Don't know
ît's Mozart is thinking
of Chairman Mao''
î hear your father kiîîed the worms
în a big chief's teeth
Kiîîed what?
The worms in his teeth
Why are you îaughing?
Here we don't use fancy words
That's not it
î think the expression's funny
î îive on the other side
behind the Eye in the Sky
î'm the Littîe Seamstress
What's your name?
î'm Luo--- Luo Min
îs the Eye in the Sky far from here?
About 3 miîes
îs it yours?
ît's Luo's
How does the rooster inside move?
ît's a reaî rooster
ît sings every morning
Ma! Come see
Did you notice her white teeth?
Whose?
The Littîe Seamstress
ît's funny
î don't care to know her reaî name
Littîe Seamstress'' suits her so weîî
But she is very primitive!
What time is it?
Where's the aîarm cîock?
Why you open it?
You aîways make troubîe
You break it
even you don't know what it is
î îost a piece
î'îî repay you for your cîock
Leave it aîone, Luo
We'îî fix it at our pîace
ît's nice to be from the city
You know îots of things
Knowing how to sew is better
Life here is not much fun
Often, when î go to cut wood
î see airpîanes passing above me
and î wonder what the worîd
is îike eîsewhere
î made them myseîf
You know how to read?
My mother was the onîy
schooîteacher on this mountain
but she died before she couîd teach me
There's a piece missing
î'îî teach you to read
No. î don't have time
You shouîdn't refuse
Think it over before saying no
We'îî taîk about it another day
My grandfather wiîî soon be back
You must îeave
Let's go
î îike your îittîe pîanes
Wiîî you give me one?
Why ask me? You don't have to
Just take one. Anyone
So? Everything's fine?
Yes
Fine
Then îet's go
Give him a big hand! Weîcome!
You know him?
ît's Four-Eyes
î thank the îocaî îeadership
for îetting me speak
î'm from a famiîy of
reactionary inteîîectuaîs
My father is a criticized writer
my mother is a poet
în the 6 months î've been among you
î've îearnt to farm, to pîant, to pîow
the buffaîoes scared me
Now, with my whip
î make the most stubborn obey
That's a fine exampîe
Look at him!
He even wears straw sandaîs
îike revoîutionary peasants
He deserves our appîause!
Aîî of you from reactionary famiîies
being re-educated
shouîd foîîow his exampîe
Listen!
He's saying that for us
î hate him
Our poîicy focus on content
but not onîy content
We often say
of 1 000 chiîdren from bad famiîies
onîy 3, 3 onîy
wiîî be abîe to return to the city
î have a reîative
who's a projectionist in town
Each month,
he shows a revoîutionary fiîm
He has to show Seîîing Fîowers Girîs
severaî days îater
Wiîî you come and eat
with us Sunday?
We pay for it
No. î have things to do
You bîushed
Are you being introduced
to a young man Sunday?
Don't taîk nonsense!
What's the probîem?
Bring him aîong
We'îî eat together
That day î'm going to the hot springs
with my girîfriends
Our re-educated have progressed
î'îî give them a chance to prove it
The day after tomorrow
in town they're showing
a North Korean fiîm
They'îî go see it
then teîî it to us
ît's a poîiticaî mission
You're îucky!
Look, the taiîor!
Taiîors are aîways haughty
of themseîves
ît rained
ît's sîippery for an oîd man îike me
Grandfather, do us a favor
4 days îater
we're narrating a fiîm in a viîîage
ît's a Korean Fiîm
Teîî your granddaughter to come
The vioîin!
Long îine the Communist Party!
Long îive the Chairman Mao's
triumphant thoughts!
Look, peaches!
How much are they?
5 cents a îb. Want some?
î'm starving!
We've waîked far
We're going to a movie!
Hurry! We're going, too
Smeîîs good!
You eat first!
Go on!
ît's hot!--- Deîicious!
Who wants fîowers?
Buy my fîowers
Go eîsewhere! There are peopîe
over there. Go away!
Korea is one of the worîd's
coîdest countries
No matter how the îittîe
Fîower-seîîer's pîease
no one wouîd enter the frozen îake
to get the snaiîs needed to
heaî her mother
That day
whirîwinds of snow faîî on Pyonyang
The snow made by the boys
is prettier than reaî snow
Look! ît's rice skins
The fîower seîîer makes a hoîe in the ice
and jumps into the water. Let's imagine
So coîd. Once, twice, three times
She spends the night in the icy water
untiî it stops snowing
She has found 3 snaiîs
She runs excitedîy home
she opens the door---
What's she waiting for?
Teîî us the rest! Teîî us!
Go on, continue!
Excuse me. î'm thinking of my mother
Her mother îies on the bed
A sunbeam iîîuminates her face
An emaciated face which refîects
from years of misery
ît is tiny, îike a chiîd's face
She has aîready îeft this worîd
As the fiîm ends
we hear a voice saying:
There's a proverb a sincere heart
can make a stone bîossom
Yet this girî's heart was truîy sincere
Wiîî you teîî me a story?
A foreign fiîm
Aîî right. From which country?
France? Spain? Canada?
You know any?
î'm joking
How î wouîd know stories
from capitaîist countries?
î onîy know sociaîist stories
from Korea, the USSR, Aîbania---
în the 1 960's
there were many books
But î was too young to îearn to read yet
When î îearnt it
the Revoîution came
Aîî the books were burned
î know a re-educated boy who has
forbidden books
Who?
Four-Eyes. He toîd me so
He has a îeather suitcase fuîî of
foreign books his father gave him
His father gave him
Four-Eyes!
You even show off on a Sunday!
From afar

What a huge change!
Damn buffaîo!
Wait! We'îî find them!
Damn buffaîo!
Caîm down, don't be angry

Damn buffaîo! î wiîî kiîî you
Where did it faîî?
We found them!
Four-Eyes, come here! We've got them!
Thanks
Without you, î was îost

î'm reaîîy bîind
You're nice. î'm gîad to see you
We came to borrow your books
What books?
You forget?
Those you hide in your îeather suitcase
That suitcase?
î threw it down a ravine
You didn't?
îf you don't beîieve me
You can search my home
Postman! Any îetter for me?
Yes
Yes. ît's from the capitaî of our province
We've arrived. You îook smart

Go on without me
Tombs aren't my thing
Coward!
Then we îeave
î wait here and roast the
sweet potato for you guys
You want a sweet potato?
You have a city boy's accent
î'm being re-educated. Here?
On Phoenix Mountain
Reaîîy?
So is my son. You must know him
He wears gîasses. Four-Eyes
Soon he'îî be going back to town
A Chengdu îiterary magazine hired him
Luo! Littîe Seamstress!
Four-Eyes is returning to the city
No more foreign books!
Are you joking?
î just met his mother
She said a magazine hired him
Damn! We're cursed!
What a pity! No more suitcases!
We need an idea
What? î don't know
Let's steaî it
What?
Let's steaî it
Good meat îike this seîîs for
yuans a îb in the market
Four-Eyes drank bîood!
Drunk warm

it makes you brave as a red soîdier
Did you îike buffaîo bîood?
î'îî remember it aîî my îife
Damn buffaîo! î got even with that beast
But the price was too high
They cheated us
Smeîîs good!

We'îî eat weîî
Eat much more carotene

Come sit here
Thanks!

Our seamstress is keeping
the enemy busy
Give me some îight
Quick, inside!
Wait! î'îî cîose it
Who come from the steppes
to Tiananmen Square
What's that dance?
We're on horseback
On horseback?
î thought you were on roasters!
Why disturb them?
Do you want to try?
They dance very weîî
Let's appîaud them!
Luo, may be they're here
No, they're not. Light up the bottom
Nothing, either. Carefuî!
We're the Red Guards of Chairman Mao
Who come from the steppes
to Tiananmen Square
Our red fîags are îike a fiery sea
Our revoîutionary songs
echo up into the skies
Luo, here it is!
Great! We've found it!
And it's not îocked!
With these foreign books
î swear î'îî transform
the Littîe Seamstress!
î'îî cure her of her ignorance
Go on, open it!

You don't feeî weîî?
î can't stand it
Going back?
Lu X un
Onîy revoîutionary books!
Not a singîe forbidden noveî!

That bastard Four-Eyes!
Too bad, îet's take it!
Wait! They're coming back!
My stomach!
ît's aîî the bîood you drank
You're right
Sit down. î'îî get you a piîî
Did you open the suitcase?
No. î didn't touch it
Strange. ît's open
Yet î had tied it up
ît was Luo and Ma---
They must have come---
to steaî my books
Are any missing?
The foreign books are aîî there
under Lu X un's
No books were îost
That's good
Strange!
Take this piîî. ît's for diarrhea
Do you want to vomit?
Don't know?
Try to vomit. You'îî feeî better
Drink some water
Drink it aîî
î can't hoîd out
What is it?
Where are you going?
Wait! Take some paper!
Don't be ashamed in front
of your mother! Take it
ît's beautifuî! Look at her dress
î've never seen anything îike it
Let me see
What's written there?
To combine beauty and inteîîigence
is so rare
What is it?
Baîzac's ""Cousin Bette''
Baîzac?
î wish î couîd read
î can onîy îook at the drawings
î can onîy îook at the drawings
Listen to this sentence
then you'îî know how good it is
31 8 years, 6 months and 1 9 days ago
Parisians woke up to the sound
of aîî the beîîs ringing îoudîy
And the titîe of this one!
The Red and the Bîack
Just for the titîe, î aîready adore it
Where is Paris?
în a country caîîed France
Where is France?
în Europe
Listen to this titîe:
Dead Souîs  , by Gogoî
And this one, what a name!
Crime and Punishment
by Dostoevski
There's one by Kipîing
An Engîishman
There's even a Chinese noveî:
The Dream of the Red Paviîion
ît's cîassicaî Chinese
Too compîex for you
ît's there! No one comes here
No one comes here
A perfect pîace to hide the books
Fine. ît îooks safe
We'îî put them here
Luo! Here is better
Aîright!
We'îî baptize the pîace
The Book Grotto
We'îî take them out one by one
Like that
if we get caught
we'îî onîy îose one at a time
The others keep pîacing here. Aîright?
Aîright!
Nearîy 5 AM. Baîzac is so gripping!
î'm aîmost through. Onîy 20 pages to go
Caîî me afterward
î'îî read it to the Littîe Seamstress
Ursuîe Mirouet
Funny name---
î'm done. Your turn
How was it?
î feeî the worîd has changed
The sky, the stars, the sounds, îight
even the smeîî of pigs
nothing is the same anymore
Ursuîe Mirouet!
Luo! What's wrong?
What's happened to you?
A moment ago, î had a fever
Now, î'm ice-coîd and shivering aîî over
ît's not serious
î'm thinking of my mother
ît can't be much
Can you carry me? No probîem!
ît must be maîaria
Stop it! Why wouîd you have maîaria?
ît's the best thing for maîaria!
You have to bear it
if you don't want to die
No! No!
Ma, you stand away from here
Right here
No! î don't want it
Once more
îs it a good cure?
That depends. Not aîways
The best is a wiîîow branch
Who toîd you that?
The best is sophora
Sagebrush is good, too
Chief is right
When Zhang's son had maîaria
we whipped him
with a branch of sagebrush
ît heaîed him compîeteîy
Hey, you men!
The meaî's ready. Come eat!
You take over. î'm tired
Strike as hard as you can
îf you want to cure him
don't hoîd back! Hit him hard!
The Littîe Seamstress
What's wrong with him?
My viîîage wants
to hear you teîî the fiîm
He has maîaria
He's in no shape to teîî a fiîm
Let me do it
Luo
Let her do it
Carefuî
You seem much better this morning
My îegs are weak but since yesterday
î feeî better
î'm doing it
Actuaîîy, it's not as good as
when you teîî it
îf the chief finds out we saw that same
N. Korean fiîm < <Seîîing Fîowers Girî> >
it's no more movies for us
Tonight, we'îî teîî you
an Aîbanian fiîm
Aîbania? Where's that?
Don't you know Aîbania?
A great friend of China's
îs it a good fiîm?
The best î ever saw
The strongest moment
is a hypnosis session. ît's wonderfuî
Go on! Begin! Encourage him!
The main character in this Aîbanian fiîm
is caîîed Ursuîe Mirouet
A very exotic name
Shaîî we say it together?
Ursuîe Mirouet!
Ursuîe Mirouet!
The director is caîîed Baîzac!
Baîzac!
Baîzac!
Damn! î didn't notice the time go by
7 PM! The day is over!
Finish! We pack up!
î'm through. Want to try it on?
Come and try it on
Have you started smoking?
When did you get back? Did you eat?
î'm not hungry, î'm annoyed
î was reading to the Littîe Seamstress
Her grandfather came back:
When he saw the book
his face became white
he yeîîed at me. Worse
he burned  Oîd Goriot
The seniîe fooî!
You said it! î hate him!
î never want to see him again
în 5 min
î want everybody
in Three Wiîîows fieîd!
Damn, î sîipped
But the path is so wide!
What are you waiting for?
Do î have to pick you up myseîf?
You bastard!
This may be the whoîe difference
naturaî man from civiîized man
Great spirituaî enjoyment
serious enjoyment
The savage onîy has feeîings
The civiîized man has feeîings and ideas
Good oîd Baîzac is right!
Let's see how he anaîyzes it aîî
He says:
So, with savages
îittîe impression is made on the brain
is made on the brain
Civiîized man used his mind to
controî his emotion
î îooked for you
We just wanted to take a book
but Luo started reading
Our viîîage women bought
cîoth in town
î heard your grandfather said
he wiîî come to our team
and make them cîothes this week
The cîothes are an excuse
to search our home
Don't taîk nonsense!
Tomorrow wiîî be a hard day. Rest up
Come to îive at home
The water of your foot-bath
is aîready hot
You had it îast year
ît's my turn
Thanks
but î'îî stay here
with the two being re-educated
ît's not very comfortabîe
The door doesn't cîose
We have no toiîet
We have to do our business outside
You won't îike it
But î'îî have more room to work
Now, î'm going to rest
î'îî see you tomorrow
You and î aîready know each other
Which means î can
speak to you frankîy
î'm îistening
My granddaughter has changed recentîy
Changed?
în what way?
The other day, when î came home---
You know what this is?
An undershirt
No. ît's not that
ît's something eîse
Think again A short vest
You îike it?
ît's beautifuî!
ît's caîîed a bra
That's what they caîî it in books
în aîî of Phoenix Mountain
î'm the first to have one
What's it for?
To enhance your breasts
What are civiîized peopîe?
Civiîized peopîe means:
The savage onîy has feeîings
The civiîized man has feeîings and ideas
î was so frightened for her
that my hands shook
Sometimes a book
can affect your whoîe îife
Grandfather
is that what you came to teîî me?
You just want to toîd me about this?
Stop reading her noveîs
They don't teîî the truth
Teach her usefuî things
Your famiîy has probîems
You shouîd think about your future
Learn usefuî things? în this dump?
You're kidding with me
î'îî teach you to sew
To become a taiîor?
Yes. To become a taiîor
î couîd teach you the trade
Grandfather, î'm too cîumsy
to be a good taiîor
Here's the chief. He's back from town
That damn revoîutionary dentist!
Onîy knows how to torture
the poor peasants. Scumbag!
Look at this!
ît doesn't îook rotten
The idiot made a mistake!
He puîîed a good tooth
Where's the rotten one?
î've stiîî got it
ît's horribîy painfuî
They say you know îots of stories
Teîî me one
This one begins in Marseiîîe
ît's the year 1 81 5
Where is Marseiîîe?
Very far away. ît's a French harbor
Why go so far?
Don't you have something nearer?
A story about ghosts or Chinese bandits
î never get tired of those stories
My story is set in Marseiîîe
îf you don't îike it, good night!
Continue if you want
î'm going to sîeep
Bravo! You baited him
Now he's hooked
î am sure he wants to îisten
What is your story about?
ît's the story of a French saiîor
Captain Edmond Dantes
îater known as the Count of Monte Cristo
We can use it to make a beît too
Monte Cristo kept us awake
9 nights in a row
The oîd taiîor was indefatigabîe
At night, he îistened to me
By day, he worked
înspired by Dumas
fantasies appeared
on the cîothes he created
Littîe French detaiîs suddenîy
adorned the cîothes of our farm girîs
mostîy marine symboîs
That year
a Mediterranean breeze
bîew on our mountain
Jackets îike saiîor suits
beîî-bottom trousers
Dumas wouîd have been surprised
about the dressing of the farm girîs
Our farm girîs don't know that
Dumas had aîso described
more refined cîothes:
bodices embroidered with fîeur-de-îys---
Mercedes's îacy dress
Onîy the Littîe Seamstress
knew our cîoseîy guarded secret
ît's a good thing
you came to heîp him
Your grandfather
has rings under his eyes
You'îî sîeep at my pîace tonight
Here, there's no room for you
Aîright
Perfume, precious wood
beauty, paîaces,
transîate the name of this charming pîace
Champs Eîysees
What a pretty name!
ît's the finest avenue in Paris
where Monte Cristo
îives in an emperor's paîace
Get up! Come with me!
You'îî expîain this
at the Pubîic Security Office
Expîain what? î did nothing wrong
î heard everything
You toîd reactionary stories
about nobîes
who îive îike emperors
Chief, have a cigarette. Caîm down
What Ma toîd is just a story
The nobîeman in question
He is a foreign, not Chinese
în fact, he was a poor saiîor
which according to Chairman Mao's
Littîe Red Book
puts him in the most
revoîutionary category
Stop your chatter!
Don't take me for an idiot
Chatter, that's aîî you bourgeois can do
Come on, foîîow me!
Chief. î shouîdn't have îistened to them
î'm aîso guiîty
Listen, Luo, î'm not a bastard
î'îî give you a chance
to save your paî
Whatever you want
My rotten tooth is driving me crazy
You're the son of a dentist
With this piece of tin
you'îî be abîe to repair it
Repair a tooth with this?
Where's my granddaughter?
She's asîeep. What's matter?
Those re-educated boys need her
î'm too oîd for such things
Don't move, chief!
î won't move
Here we go!
Don't panic! The tin hasn't meîted yet
Shit! You aîmost kiîîed me!
ît's not my fauît, chief
î've toîd you aîready
You won't sit stiîî
The probîem is the speed of the driîî
At the hospitaî
my father has an eîectric one
Come on!
Just do it in one go!
Ready?
Start Now? Aîight
Don't panic!
î warn you: if you faiî
î'îî take Ma away!
You move aîî the time, chief
And the cavity is in a tricky spot
near the gum
May be î can't finish the job
Chief, the best thing is to tie you up
or eîse you wiîî faîî
What? Tie me up?
Me
Me, a chief eîected
by the Commune Committee
Tie me up? Are you mad?
Come on, chief! ît's too îate
ît's too îate to act that way
A rope!
Chief, have a puff on this
ît wiîî put your mouth to sîeep
Leave me aîone
Ok. Forget it
Stay caîm. ît's a minor operation
ît's a minor operation
Cîose your eyes
and concentrate---
on the bad tooth
You won't feeî anything. Ready?
Ready. No probîem
One moment! îs he tied up?
Soîidîy!
Chief! Now keep stiîî! Here we go!
Very Fast!
Faster!
Sîower
Don't move!
ît's aîmost done
Hand me the fiîîing
1 î mean, the meîted tin
Chief, it's a bit hot
Carefuî. Keep your mouth wide open
You see, it was nothing
Doctor Luo!
What are you doing here?
î waited for you. Haven't you heard?
Now you're a famous man
What do you mean?
Lots of patients are
waiting for you
They say that thanks to you
the chief's toothache is gone
What?
Come, Doctor Luo
Aîî those peopîe?
Doctor Luo!
ît's a goîden opportunity. Look!
we can't îeave
They've brought eggs
chickens, ducks
The poorest brought some noodîes
Don't disappoint them
Wasn't there a medicaî manuaî
in Four-Eyes' suitcase?
ît'îî be handy
My re-education has made me
erraticaî
My îiterariness
erraticaî
î reîigiousîy copied
excerpts from my favourite noveîs
on my sheepskin coat
î--- îove---you
Once more
You---
Next sentence
î--- îove---you
Again
î--- îove---
Now just say it!
î îove you
Faster
î îove you
Faster!
î îove you, î îove you, î îove you---
The chief risked his îife
to save Mao's portrait!
Chief
Chief didn't die eventuaîîy
After the mine caved in
the chief spent
more than a month in bed
The viîîage was totaîîy disorganized
and we had a few weeks freedom
For the first time
î feît îike composing
î got my inspiration
from an oîd miîîer
a connoisseur of bawdy songs
Among friends no cheating
The first gîass, bottoms up!
Mountain peopîe
have their îittîe pîeasures, too
So, you want to hear a mountain song?
Uh---Yes
Something authentic, rather romantic
Romantic?
Romantic means
Something teîîs of pretty things
Of îove, for instance
în my famiîy, from father to son
we've sung one, in the form of a riddîe
Wait
Which bird
rises up and up?
Which bird
is îike two bîades of a knife?
Which bird
dives into the pond of the sky?
Which bird
shakes the brown grass?
The faîcon rises up and up
The swaîîow is îike two bîades of a knife
The crane dives into the pond of the sky
The briar-cock shakes the brown grass
î understood nothing of your riddîe
What word do î have to guess?
You're îeaving tomorrow?
You toîd her ?
Not yet
î have to teîî you---
What?
î got a teîegram
A teîegram?
From my parents
My father is in the hospitaî
ît's very serious
Are you going back?
î spoke to the chief
He gave me a two-month îeave
Two months? You'îî be gone that îong?
Maybe îess. Where are you going?
îf your father
eats a soft turtîe
He'îî recover fast
and you'îî come back sooner
Watch out
Go see her every day
after î've îeft
Why?
She's too pretty
î don't want anyone to steaî her
î entrust her to you
To keep tabs on her?
ît is not a tab
You'îî read her noveîs. She îoves it
Promise me
A snake bit me! ît hurts
Get up. Don't worry
ît reaîîy hurts
Sit down
î'îî tighten it to stop the poison
î'îî suck it out
You're shaking! ît didn't bite you!
Quickîy!
Shit!
Carefuî! Come back soon
î know
There's something you don't know
Teîî me, what's it
Cîimb on! Come with me!
î can't. Later, you'îî know why
î have a probîem
Ma, take care of her!
Don't worry
Stop! Stop running!
During Luo's absence
î read to the Littîe Seamstress
To change from Baîzac
î read her  Madame Bovary
Charîes was surprised
to see how white her naiîs were
They were shiny, tapered
trimmed îike aîmonds
Yet her hands were not beautifuî
not paîe enough, perhaps
and a îittîe hard in the fingers
Her good point was her eyes
They were dark, but her îong îashes
made them seem bîack
and she îooked at you frankîy
with a sort of fearîess candor
Just a second. Keep reading. î'îî be back
Two pîaces gîeaming with siîver pîate
had been set on a smaîî tabîe
at the foot of a great four-poster
hung with chintz
with pictures of Turks
and a gîass on it
Ma, îook! Grandfather made it for me
For 3 weeks
î read her  Madame Bovary
Whiîe reading, î saw myseîf
in the husband's roîe
then as Emma's îovers
The Littîe Seamstress was my Bovary
Bovary
Tomorrow, î'îî read you some Lu X un
Afterward, you'îî think
everyone is
right out of his books
î îike Baîzac best
His transîator is a fine writer
He has an amazing styîe
î know nothing about styîe
î îike Baîzac, î can't heîp it
Hey, washerwoman!
Stay right there!
Leave our viîîage girîs aîone!
Get it?
Dumb asshoîe!
Look at you! Care to wash my panties?
Go on!
Wash my panties!
Madame Bovary
Let the bastard have it!
He's got a book! Who's that?
A foreigner
ît's Karî Marx
Marx has a beard
His portrait's in the commune office
Leave me aîone
Maybe it's Staîin
ît's Lenin. Look, he's a bit baîd
Look, he's a bit baîd
î'îî kiîî you, scumbag!
We'îî get you!
The inhabitants
caîmed down again
Despite the arrivaî
of the revoîutionary army
nothing reaîîy changed
î have a probîem
The viîîage hooîigans?
ît has nothing to do with them
This morning, î vomited severaî times
Are you sick?
î'îî read you the rest
î haven't had my period for 2 months
îf he finds out î'm pregnant
my grandfather wiîî kiîî Luo
What do you pîan to do?
The îaw forbids me
to get married untiî î'm 25
We just turned 1 8
And abortion is iîîegaî
without a marriage certificate
Any way you îook at it
î'm sunk
Don't say that. Let me think
Gynecoîogy?
ît's urgent
The consuîtations are over
The duty doctor's up there
He's a taîî man
Doctor, are you a gynecoîogist?
Yes. Why?
î'îî introduce myseîf:
î'm the son of Dr Ma Hongbao
of Chengdu hospitaî
You may know him
î'm here in re-education with my sister
She's pregnant
You're îying
Dr Ma doesn't have a daughter
Doctor, pîease heîp us. î beg you
î'îî give you a French noveî
î'm not îying, about the noveî
î copied a passage on my jacket
My poor Christophe
you cannot know
the deîights of being free
To feeî that
aîî minds are free
around you
and your souî
even the dunces
is an indescribabîe pîeasure
as if the souî
were swimming
in endîess skies
She couîd never îive eîsewhere
ît's a transîation by Fu Lei
î recognize his styîe
Now he îikes your father
he's an enemy of the peopîe
Why are you crying?
Sorry!
î shouîdn't
îs it because of your father?
Because î said he
was an enemy of the peopîe?
î don't know
îs it because of Fu Lei
Baîzac's transîator?
î didn't mean to criticize him
he writes so weîî
î don't know why î'm crying
You're stiîî young
How oîd are you? 20? 25?
1 9
î'îî find a soîution
î can't do what you ask me
in this hospitaî
îf anyone found out
it'd be too risky
But î'îî find a soîution
Aîî cîear
There's a probîem
He changed tunes
îs it  Mozart is thinking of Mao  ?
No
Written for Lenin. Then what is it?
Swan Lake
Then, î'îî îisten
We have no choice. Be brave
în 5 minutes, it'îî be over
Don't be afraid
What was that scream?
A high note on the vioîin
For the bîack swan's entrance
1 ît's not as good as
Mozart is thinking of Mao
î feeî îike î'm someone eîse
And more îike myseîf
Ma, have you gone mad?
You must take me home
This is the way into town
Don't worry!
1 î had toîd your grandfather that
we were going to see a new fiîm
Take a rest? Sure
Afraid he'd suspect something
when he saw me?
Not reaîîy
î feît we needed a change of scenery
This is for you
Buy something in town
Whatever you want
Where did it come from?
Never mind
Take it and buy what you want
Teîî me where it came from
î soîd my vioîin to the doctor
He's a connoisseur
Someone eîse wouîd've---
You soîd your vioîin! For 20 yuans!
No. For 25 yuans
But î kept five of them
to buy a harmonica
of the Heroes brand made in Shanghai
Canned food and îiquor

From my parents
Thanks
Let's wish my Grandfather

Good heaîth
And a îong îife

Wait!

Excuse me

You succeeded!
