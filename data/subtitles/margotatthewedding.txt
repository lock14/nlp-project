1
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,360
Thanks.

2
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
Here.

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,480
Sorry.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,920
-That was quick.
-I sat next to the wrong person.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,440
-Really? Where?
-Don't look! Don't look!

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,440
Careful of my jacket.

7
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,960
Will the wedding be crowded?

8
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,880
I don't know.

9
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,440
I don't think
she knows anyone anymore.

10
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,000
She's only known this guy a year.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,280
Is that short?

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Would you marry someone
you'd only known a year?

13
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,040
I can't say I have a lot of hope
for the whole thing.

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,680
Then why are we going then?

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,120
-We're supporting her.
-I thought she wasn't speaking to you.

16
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,040
No.

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,640
I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.

18
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,320
I'm never getting married.

19
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
Why aren't you wearing
your new shades?

20
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
I don't think I need them right now.

21
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,040
You begged for those glasses.

22
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
You look very cool.

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,240
I don't need them right now.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
Do they know we're here?

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,080
Yes.

26
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
Are you...

27
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,880
Paul apologizes for not coming.
She's still getting the house ready.

28
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,200
I'm sorry it was such short notice.

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
I don't care.
Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit.

30
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,880
And Ingrid wants me to tell you
that she made us all bracelets.

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,200
No, I said we should wait.

32
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,840
I thought you asked me to tell them.
Anyway, I got Knicks colors.

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
They're not Knicks colors!

34
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,240
It's beautiful, Ingrid.

35
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,000
-Where's your dad and Josh?
-They might come later.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Josh's spring break is next week,
and then Jim teaches through Friday.

37
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,200
Then he opens the house
in Vermont on the weekend.

38
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,720
It means a lot to Pauline that you came.

39
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,320
Good.

40
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,320
Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!

41
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
God!

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,000
If you're wondering about
the mustache...

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,040
No, I wasn't.

44
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,480
I had a full beard for a while,
and then when I shaved it

45
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,440
I left this part for last, you know,
to see how it looked.

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,160
And...

47
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
It's meant to be funny.

48
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
You're so handsome.

49
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,920
I never thought I'd get you here.

50
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
You're arriving in the midst of a drama.

51
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
Ingrid, would you make sure
Wizard's inside?

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,080
It's the Voglers.

53
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,360
The neighbors want us
to cut down our tree.

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,280
No. That's our tree.

55
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,480
They think it's sick
and rotting their property.

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,000
We're having the ceremony under it.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
You took the swing down.

58
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,000
Pauline thinks this is their way
of trying to be friends.

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,240
I think they resent us because we're...

60
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,360
I don't know what we are.

61
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
-This is my room.
-Okay.

62
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,080
-Do you like showers or baths?
-Showers. What about you?

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,200
I don't care.

64
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,160
Is Malcolm what you thought he'd be?

65
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,720
-I didn't know what to...
-The mustache is temporary.

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,520
He saved it for last
when he was shaving.

67
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
It's meant to be funny.

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
-He told me.
-Yeah.

69
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,520
I'm sorry, with so little time to prepare,

70
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,480
we had to put you in
Malcolm's storage room.

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,480
This was Becky's room. Poor Becky.

72
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,960
Poor Becky.
Well, now it's a storage room.

73
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,240
I've just started to feel like it's our house
and not my parents', you know.

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,480
Our parents.

75
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,200
Of course.

76
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,280
Sorry, it might still smell like paint.

77
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,840
I thought he was a musician.

78
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,040
Well, music's officially a hobby.
He's painting now,

79
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,040
and writing letters to newspapers
and magazines.

80
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,240
He's very meticulous.

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,480
He'll spend up to a week
writing a response to a music review.

82
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,040
He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
I don't know. We're doing very well.

83
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,760
Good. I mean, you must be.

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,640
I don't know where to begin.
What can I tell you?

85
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,440
It seems I'm pregnant,
but it's really early,

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,880
so I haven't told anyone.
I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Ingrid.

87
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,280
-Wow.
-What did you say?

88
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
I said wow.

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,280
Yeah. If it sticks. We'll see. I hope so.

90
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
Things are good.

91
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,680
We did a couples' seminar
two months ago or so in Maine.

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,400
They give you exercises
and things to do.

93
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,120
I know you're not convinced,
but we got engaged right afterwards.

94
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,200
The guy who runs it, Strickland,
he wrote this really interesting book,

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
On Loving,
which I'll lend you if you want.

96
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Okay.

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,520
But only if you'll read it.

98
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,680
Because I need it back.
I made notes in the margins.

99
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
I may not get to it for a while.

100
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,840
Well, I'm not going to lend it to you
if you're not going to read it.

101
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,440
It's gonna be very informal, by the way.

102
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,000
Just Mom and Becky,
Malcolm's brother,

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,440
a few friends, and now you and Claude.
Nothing like the first one.

104
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,760
Becky's coming?

105
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,960
-Yeah.
-Could I have some...

106
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,840
You go.

107
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,000
You go.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,040
I was just going to say
could I have some white wine?

109
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh, yeah. We have...

110
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm really glad you changed your mind
and came.

111
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
I never heard from you after I sent
the invite. I even wondered if you got it.

112
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm just so pleased that we're here.

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Did you get it?

114
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,360
Yeah.

115
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm sorry you were so angry.

116
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
I wasn't angry. I was disappointed.

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,920
But you see,
when you say disappointed,

118
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,960
it puts me in a crummy situation,
like I let you down.

119
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,240
-Well, you did, in a way.
-No, I don't see it like that.

120
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,840
Fine. I felt betrayed. Is that word okay?

121
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,200
Again, you're making me the aggressor.

122
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
You were the aggressor.

123
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,200
Listen, let's not...

124
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,800
I've become a really good cook.

125
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,280
I can't believe you've still got
all of our old records.

126
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,320
-Mom, can you hide this, please?
-Yeah, of course.

127
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,440
Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once.

128
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,360
Yeah, in the late '80s.

129
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,200
After he left The Cars. It was a solo gig.

130
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
So you're kind of famous?

131
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,160
No, no, believe me, I'm not.
I used to want to be, but no.

132
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,240
Do you want to be famous?

133
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,280
Claude wants to be very famous.

134
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,200
Well, make sure you can
handle rejection. I can't.

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,880
For me, expectation just
turns to disappointment.

136
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,120
So ultimately, I'd rather not try.

137
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,640
Claude, ignore him.

138
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,640
It'll all go black for us
soon enough, anyway.

139
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,360
When your mother moved to New York,

140
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,280
she used to send me
books and records.

141
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,400
-She sent me R.E.M.'s Murmur.
-And the Pixies.

142
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,120
And X. She was very cool, your mother.

143
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,600
-You only liked Top 40.
-That's true. But I love R.E.M. now.

144
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,200
I don't really listen to music anymore.

145
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,040
I was dating that guy Horace back then.
Do you remember him?

146
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,960
Was that the guy
that liked to rough you up?

147
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,760
No, that was our dad.

148
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
Our dad used to strip down to
his skivvies and beat us with a belt.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,840
That man had a sexual screw loose.

150
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,000
That's awful that stuff
that happens to kids.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Malcolm was fondled
by a male babysitter.

152
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,400
Just use that information
however you want.

153
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm sorry, we're with family. I figured...

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,880
I think Becky got it the worst.

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,160
Did she ever.
Raped by the horse trainer.

156
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,560
Alan rolled over in bed and he looked
at me and he said, "I can't feel my face."

157
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,200
It took three doctors before
we knew it was Bell's Palsy.

158
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,680
They say a brush of wind can do it.

159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,440
Feeling is slowly coming back.

160
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,360
We're all getting older, which is terrible.

161
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,280
I don't care how universal it is.
I can't remember names anymore.

162
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,040
I have that.
I blank out on certain words now, too.

163
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,960
The other day I couldn't remember
the word for...

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,480
I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine.
What is it? Sediment. That's it.

165
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,720
I know that. I was talking more about

166
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,320
not remembering who was
the bassist for Mötley Crüe.

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Ingrid. Why don't you show Claude
and Bruce the game trunk?

168
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,280
Okay.

169
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,200
Mick Mars.

170
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,320
Toby, I think you need to have
Bruce diagnosed.

171
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Margot, I don't wanna have
this conversation with you.

172
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
It's vital. If you keep telling him
he's like everyone else,

173
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,840
he's gonna wonder why he isn't.
He's suffering.

174
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
He's tested very well.
He does B's in school.

175
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,440
But that's how autism works.

176
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,280
One part of the brain can be fine,
and then the other part is damaged.

177
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,360
We've had him diagnosed, Margot.
Nothing was found wrong.

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,280
Did you really, though?

179
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm not gonna have this conversation.
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,440
I know this must be so difficult for you,
but you have to...

181
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,200
What are you doing?

182
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
I left you a note.

183
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,760
Come back.

184
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,800
Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday.

185
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,320
No. No. The wedding is on Saturday.

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm here for that. I can't pull out.
How would that look?

187
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,760
You haven't spoken to her in years.

188
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,400
Well, we're speaking now.
She is my closest friend, despite it all.

189
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,480
You were the one that kept trying
to get me to call her.

190
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,120
Did you tell Claude what you're doing?

191
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,040
Jim, this guy, Malcolm,

192
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,760
he's exactly what you'd imagine,
except I think he's clinically depressed.

193
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,680
He's not ugly.
He's just completely unattractive.

194
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,680
He has no job.

195
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,240
Best I can make out is
he's a letter writer. I don't know.

196
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,680
And the house looks weird to me.
She's trying too hard.

197
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,640
It's all kind of a mess.

198
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,960
They took down the swing.

199
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,960
Hello?

200
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,680
You said you weren't 100% on this.
You said that like a week ago.

201
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Can I come up there?

202
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,800
No. I don't want to see you.
I feel happier already having done it.

203
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,200
Please, don't tell Claude anything,
please, until we've talked more.

204
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,760
This is happening, and you need
to get your mind around that.

205
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,680
-Are you asleep?
-Yes.

206
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,560
-Will you remember this?
-Yeah.

207
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,320
I just talked to your dad.

208
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm only going to tell you
if you won't remember.

209
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,880
Okay.

210
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,480
Everyone finds you so funny
and charming.

211
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,320
I always get compliments about you.

212
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,680
Are you having fun?
Is it nice to see Pauline?

213
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,680
-Yeah, I really like her.
-Yeah, she is crazy, though.

214
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,760
-In what way?
-She's really berserk.

215
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,240
Maybe it's the hormones.

216
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,880
You didn't notice anything
different about Pauline?

217
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,800
-No.
-She's pregnant. She told me.

218
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,160
She's keeping it a secret
from Malcolm and even Ingrid,

219
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,600
which I think is unforgivable.

220
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,320
Now she's gonna have to marry him.

221
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,800
What's she planning on doing,
getting married

222
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,920
and not drinking champagne?
Then she's just gonna be lying.

223
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,120
I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry.
She probably will.

224
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,200
I think on some level,
she's ambivalent about the marriage.

225
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,880
That's why she's not telling him.

226
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
Are you stoned, Mom?

227
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,880
Maybe a little.

228
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
I don't like it.

229
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,680
My scrotum is longer than my penis.

230
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
It's sweet how Claude looks up to me.

231
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,920
Margot doesn't seem as crazy
as you made her out to be.

232
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,840
What she did to Alan and Toby tonight
didn't seem crazy enough for you?

233
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,760
I guess that seemed pretty crazy.

234
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,360
Well, she cares deeply.

235
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,400
This has nothing to do with Bruce.
She thinks everyone is autistic.

237
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,520
What?

238
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,080
Nothing.
You keep changing your position.

239
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm just trying to figure out
if I should agree with you or not.

240
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
Well, can't she be both?
Care deeply and be crazy?

241
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,960
I mean, do people have to be
all one thing?

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,440
-I guess not.
-Well, okay then.

243
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,040
It is nice she came for the wedding.

244
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,720
She's so pretty, don't you think?

245
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,280
-She's attractive.
-A little thin, maybe.

246
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,360
But it is nice she came.

247
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,320
Let's fuck.

248
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,080
Fuck it!

249
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,360
Claude!

250
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,160
I knew I could be friends with him

251
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,880
Good go.

252
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
Honey, you're up.

253
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,280
Claude, don't just whack it.
Think about it before you hit.

254
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,200
Sorry.

255
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,960
Good.

256
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,120
Paul, what are you doing?

257
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,360
I'm sending Claude's ball
into the bushes.

258
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Take the extra hit.

259
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,040
-I don't want to do that.
-It's the smarter play.

260
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,920
Pauline! I told you, you can't!
Your feet are too small.

261
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,040
You took the awnings down.

262
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes!

263
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
Okay.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,040
-Well done.
-Fuck you.

265
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Come on, Claude.

266
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,760
Honey, you're going the wrong way.

267
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,560
So stupid.

268
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,800
Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.

269
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,200
This is why I hate games.
I hate what it does to me.

270
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,800
Wait! We're not finished yet!

271
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,880
Malcolm?

272
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,640
Have you ever noticed how Pauline
sometimes can't make eye contact?

273
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,080
How her gaze hovers
just above your head?

274
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,920
I think I know what you mean.

275
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,280
I always think
that I have something in my hair.

276
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,400
It's not necessarily bad, Paul.
It's just something that you do.

277
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,440
Claude, have you ever seen
your mother climb a tree?

278
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,520
No.

279
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,920
We don't have much opportunity
in Manhattan.

280
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,600
As kids, Margot climbed everything.

281
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
She could even climb that tree.

282
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,080
Can you do it, Mom?

283
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,160
-Maybe later.
-No, now.

284
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
-Do it now, Margot.
-Show him, Margot.

285
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,920
I told you.

286
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,840
Shit.

287
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,920
What's she doing now?

288
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,680
She's stuck.

289
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,560
You okay?

290
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,480
I got it.

291
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,640
You were great on the way up.

292
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,600
-Don't patronize me, Claude.
-Come on, we're all laughing, Margot!

293
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,000
You're laughing in a kind way.

294
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,760
Claude is taking
too much pleasure out of it.

295
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,440
-I am not.
-You are.

296
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,800
You like to make fun of me,
to see me get embarrassed.

297
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
It's mean.

298
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,440
-What are you doing?
-I've got a fucking bug in my ear, okay?

299
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,360
I thought Claude could hand out
programs. Ingrid wants to sing.

300
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,120
Do you want to read a poem
or something?

301
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,560
You know I don't like
to speak in front of people.

302
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm doing this conversation
at the bookstore in town on Friday.

303
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,240
I totally regret having said I'd do it.

304
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,520
You're doing a conversation?

305
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,520
Yeah. Just talking about my work
in front of a crowd.

306
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,920
I would have invited you,
but I thought it'd be boring.

307
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,560
What? Say it.

308
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,000
Nothing. It's just, I would come.
I wanna come.

309
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,280
I get a kick out of it.

310
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,760
Just, it's weird, you know.
So you're not here for my...

311
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,000
It's okay. I get it.
When did they ask you?

312
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,200
A while ago. I said no, but then
when I was coming here anyway,

313
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,880
I guess it helps sales. And so...

314
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,560
I see.

315
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,600
Did I tell you Becky got her tubes tied?

316
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,680
Why? Is she seeing someone?
She's still obese, I assume.

317
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
I think it's symbolic.

318
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,920
I bet Mom paid for it.

319
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,640
-We should audit Mom.
-I considered it in my 20s.

320
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,360
You know, when I was fucking everyone.
You remember?

321
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,400
-I did my share.
-Not like me.

322
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,000
You wanna count?

323
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,000
No, Margot. I don't wanna count.

324
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,720
What was it about Dad
that had us fucking so many guys?

325
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,320
I think it was the only time
we could really feel unselfconscious

326
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,360
and get out of our heads.

327
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,640
I don't think it was that.

328
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,600
I just think it was something
we were good at.

329
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.

330
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,880
No, she said he had Asperger's.
It's like lesser-retarded.

331
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,560
-I have adult A.D.D.
-You mean child A.D.D.

332
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,240
No. For some reason
I have the adult version.

333
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
Maybe I'm retarded.

334
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,200
-Come on!
-Come on!

335
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,720
-Hey! Be careful!
-What?

336
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,720
Be careful how you pull on
that child's arm.

337
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,040
You'll take it out of its socket.

338
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,120
Don't tell us how to treat our child.

339
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,720
I don't care how you treat your child.
Just don't hurt him.

340
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,160
-It's a girl.
-She threw a rock at me.

341
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,280
She's a little girl.

342
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,760
She knew what she was doing.
There's no hitting in our family.

343
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,680
Do you understand?

344
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,600
Stay out of it, bitch.

345
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,600
That was the Voglers.

346
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,440
Jesus, Margot, what are you doing?
They already hate us.

347
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,360
Don't you tell me what I can
and can't do. That is child abuse.

348
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,880
Mom, she was psychotic.

349
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,240
Stop picking on me, everyone.

350
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,040
Oh, God.

351
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
It could be anyone's.

352
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,360
What are they gonna do to us?

353
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,840
They're not going to do anything, honey.

354
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,440
We have to cut down the tree.

355
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,800
You should have seen
that woman's face.

356
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,200
Margot completely set her off.

357
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
Where are we gonna get married then?

358
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,440
We'll get married
in the fucking driveway if we have to.

359
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,360
Your mom started a war.

360
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,080
We have to make sure we wear shoes,

361
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,680
because they might
start throwing glass.

362
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,280
-Has that happened before?
-I can't remember. I think so.

363
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,520
No, it definitely has. Now I remember.

364
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,680
-Where you going?
-To town. I'll be back for dinner.

365
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,560
Come on, Margot, nobody blames you.

366
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,480
-Is that Dick Koosman?
-Yeah. He has a house up here.

367
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,360
-What's he doing with Mom?
-Good question.

368
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,400
Dick and his daughter asked us over
to swim tomorrow.

369
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
We didn't invite them to the wedding.

370
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
You're not really friends.

371
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
We're friends enough that it's awkward.
Maisy baby-sits for us all the time.

372
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,280
He's doing the interview with me
in town on Friday.

373
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,120
Did I tell you he and I are collaborating
on a screenplay?

374
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,000
An adaptation of one of Dick's novels.

375
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,280
No, I didn't even know you knew
he was up here.

376
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,120
Is he even a good writer?
Why do people care about him?

377
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,360
You're competitive with everyone.

378
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,640
It doesn't even matter
if they do the same thing as you.

379
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,400
He's competitive with Bono.

380
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,320
It's true. I don't subscribe to the credo

381
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
that there's enough room
for everyone to be successful.

382
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,320
I think there are only
a few spots available,

383
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,240
and people like Dick Koosman
and Bono are taking them up.

384
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,280
Malcolm, what would ever make
you think that's something

385
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,200
to draw right now?

386
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,360
Sorry.

387
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,480
I wasn't thinking about it. Sorry, Margot.

388
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
You found it.

389
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,640
-Hi!
-Hey, Maisy.

390
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,160
Thank you, Pauline.

391
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,880
-Hi.
-How are you?

392
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,400
-What's up?
-I don't wanna do this.

393
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,600
-Come on, don't be that way.
-No, I'm not being that way.

394
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,720
I just don't feel like it.

395
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,480
I'm gonna go back and...
I have work to do.

396
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
Dick doesn't care
that you don't make any money.

397
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,640
Is that what you... That's not why.

398
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,960
I just hate swimming. I really hate it.
It's disgusting to me.

399
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,040
My mistake was saying
I would do it to begin with.

400
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,640
You have fun.

401
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,560
Fine. We'll have fun.

402
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,400
People always pee in the pool.

403
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,280
I don't think Dick and Maisy pee
in their pool.

404
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,760
I'll bet you $500 there's pee in that pool.

405
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
To the end and back.
Claude, you say go.

406
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,720
Okay. Go!

407
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
-How's your dad?
-Good.

408
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,240
He and I shared a thesis advisor
at Stanford. Did you know that?

409
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,920
No.

410
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,880
I was dating your mom back then.
Did you know that?

411
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,800
No.

412
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,680
-Pauline wins! Mom cheated.
-I did not.

413
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,560
You didn't touch the wall, Margot.

414
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
It doesn't matter. Lost anyway.

415
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,640
It was close.

416
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,920
Maisy, aren't you going swimming?

417
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,360
Claude!

418
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,080
Are you okay?

419
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,200
I got him!

420
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,920
It's okay, baby.

421
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,400
-I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.
-Now we're even.

422
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,000
-You've got a problem.
-What do you mean?

423
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,120
I don't like the girl,

424
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,200
and I don't like the way
Malcolm looks at her.

425
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,360
Come on, it's sexy.

426
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,800
No, you didn't see it.
I saw it. You've got a problem.

427
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,720
I'm not worried.

428
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,200
Maybe teach Claude how to swim.

429
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,320
He won't want to do it. It's too late.

430
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,520
-Are you supposed to be doing that?
-No.

431
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,280
I liked your last story. Was it Harper's?
The one about Mom.

432
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,120
I was very... I liked it very much.

433
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,520
-It wasn't really about Mom.
-I thought it was.

434
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,400
Anyway. Why don't you want
Claude to know how to swim?

435
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,600
I didn't say I didn't want him to.
Why do you care?

436
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,040
It's not in his life. We're New Yorkers.

437
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,600
If he wants to learn when he's older,
he can.

438
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,640
I'm curious why you're so
interested in the whole thing.

439
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,880
I'm not. It's just as a safety thing.
Forget it.

440
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,040
It's interesting.

441
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,840
This is the first time
Dick has invited us over.

442
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,200
Are you really friends?

443
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,320
Well, we're neighbors.
We employ Maisy.

444
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,560
I mean, I don't care.
I just think it's interesting.

445
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,640
Are you excited about the talk?
I'd like to come, if it's okay.

446
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,040
My friend Blair asked me, "What's it like
to have a celebrity as a sister?"

447
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
I said I've got no problem with celebrity.

448
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,280
Alice Munro spoke at Bennington
and was sort of a friend of mine.

449
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,640
-I'm not a celebrity.
-Well, you're well-known.

450
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,640
-To a very few people.
-Just accept the compliment.

451
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,240
I guess I didn't realize
it was a compliment.

452
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,040
I know a girl from a lonely street

453
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet

454
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,520
Dry your eyes, Sunday girl

455
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,480
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl

456
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,200
Looks like he's in another world

457
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,240
Go on and hide, Sunday girl

458
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,200
She can't catch up

459
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,160
Singing?

460
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,320
A bit.

461
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,680
Can I make a suggestion?

462
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,280
You should get underarm deodorant.
You kind of smell.

463
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,160
Better I tell you than someone else.

464
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,960
-I think you smell nice. You smell real.
-I stink.

465
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,360
-It causes cancer.
-Underarm deodorant?

466
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,520
It's got chemicals and other things
which are extremely harmful.

467
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,840
I'm not gonna die
from underarm cancer.

468
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,000
No, you'll get it somewhere else,
like your stomach or your testicles.

469
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,760
-Testicles?
-Don't laugh. It's a serious thing.

470
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,960
Who told you about this anyway?

471
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,400
-Maisy?
-Yeah.

472
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,440
I hope you're not interested in that girl.
I find her insufferable.

473
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,640
What does that mean?

474
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,520
It means I can't suffer her.
She's loud and stupid.

475
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,480
And she goes on about things
of which she knows nothing about.

476
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,160
She got into Harvard early.

477
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,800
Stupid people get into Harvard early
all the time.

478
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,600
-Where did you go again?
-Barnard.

479
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,040
I just don't think
you should do anything with her.

480
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,960
We're just friends.

481
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,280
If you do, use a condom.

482
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
Where are you going?

483
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,640
Out with Pauline and Malcolm and Dick.

484
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
Are kids coming?

485
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,400
Who do we know is gay?

486
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
How do I know
what gay people you know?

487
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,480
-Alan and Toby.
-And Bruce. He's gay and Asperger's.

488
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,280
-I don't know if Bruce is gay.
-He might be. It's very common.

489
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,240
-Your mom's pregnant.
-No, she isn't.

490
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,320
-She is.
-How do you know that, Claude?

491
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,440
She told my mom. But you can tell.
She's hormonally weird.

492
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,920
Holy shit, Ingrid.

493
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,360
You're gonna have
a baby sister or brother.

494
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
My mom thinks your mom is unreliable.

495
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,680
Who cares?

496
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,920
-Do you think your mom is fuckable?
-I don't know.

497
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,600
I think she's hot, your mother.
I'd do her if I was gay.

498
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,680
I might anyway,
I mean, if she came on to me.

499
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,600
She won't.

500
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm not gonna do anyone.

501
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,160
-What was that?
-This is scary.

502
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,400
Margot used to never speak.

503
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,960
I remember we went on a double date
in high school.

504
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,440
And that kid Ron asked
if English was your first language.

505
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,840
It's true. I used to think
I had some kind of brain defect.

506
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,680
-You thought you were aphasic.
-I'm still not sure.

507
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,160
-Jesus, Margot.
-It's very possible, Paul.

508
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,120
It's just, your diagnoses sometimes irk
the hell out of me.

509
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,960
-Malcolm, will you slow down?
-What?

510
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,560
I can drive, if you like.

511
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,320
Nah. You got the dinner.
The driving's on me.

512
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,080
Well, I'll let you pay your half
if you slow down.

513
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,800
Well, neither Pauline nor I
ordered dessert.

514
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,680
Let it go, Malcolm.

515
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,320
Margot would insist on driving,
if she knew how.

516
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,400
My license elapsed, but I know how.

517
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,720
It's probably for the best.
I have this theory. I think, historically,

518
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,400
women have been held back in so many
ways that when they get power

519
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,200
like they do behind the wheel,
they can't help but abuse it.

520
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,360
It's akin to Hannah Arendt's
Eichmann theory about

521
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,680
prison guards and prisoners
switching roles.

522
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,240
-That's a charming philosophy.
-Yeah, tell that one a lot.

523
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,960
This isn't a blanket thing.
I mean, women can be great drivers too.

524
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,640
Said the man with the mustache
he thinks he's wearing in quotes.

525
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,600
It's meant to be funny.

526
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,440
Are you doing this for her benefit
or for mine?

527
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,480
-What the fuck?
-What?

528
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,080
No, there they go. It's okay. I thought
I lost the brakes for a second there.

529
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,320
-Malcolm!
-What?

530
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,800
-Watch it!
-It's fine, Margot!

531
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,560
You're just so incompetent.

532
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Okay. Why don't you fucking
drive yourselves home?

533
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,360
God.

534
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,520
You should go after her.

535
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,440
Come home with me tonight.

536
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,200
-I've got Claude.
-Come on.

537
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,160
I've been trying to get you
up here all year.

538
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,680
She's pregnant.

539
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,800
-Why are you putting that there?
-I just wanna keep it.

540
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,360
I left a piece of skin
in a movie theater once.

541
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,480
So it could watch movies all its life.

542
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,720
-Are you obsessed with Maisy?
-No.

543
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,600
You're always staring at her tits.

544
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,880
-You have a mustache.
-My mom bleaches it.

545
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,200
-Where are you going?
-You're starting to annoy me.

546
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,920
What are you doing?

547
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,920
-I didn't think you came home.
-Where would I be?

548
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,160
Can't Josh and Dad come
to the wedding?

549
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,920
I've been through this. Go to bed.

550
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,200
Can I sleep in here?

551
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,160
No, honey.

552
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,720
We can put a pillow between us.

553
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,760
Okay. Just for tonight.

554
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,800
When you were a baby,
I wouldn't let anyone else hold you.

555
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,840
I think that may have been a mistake.

556
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,400
Why was it a secret?

557
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,480
Because I didn't want you to get excited
before it was real.

558
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,680
It's not really a baby yet.

559
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,400
In two weeks
we can celebrate together, okay?

560
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,360
Why did you tell Margot?

561
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,120
Because she's my sister and I trust her.

562
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,240
How do you feel about it?

563
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,360
I don't want a sister.

564
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,400
I'm gonna get Wizard.

565
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,680
Margot told Claude something
I expressly told her in confidence.

566
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,200
And he told Ingrid.

567
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,160
I'm stunned that she put me in this
position. It's so fucking infuriating!

568
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,720
-Well, it's one of those things...
-Don't say anything, okay?

569
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
You know what?
Just be there for me silently.

570
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,920
Okay.

571
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
Why do I have to be
so careful around her,

572
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,000
but everyone is allowed
to make fun of me?

573
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,280
-I don't think...
-Malcolm, what did I just say?

574
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,720
I just need you to take my side.
I don't need you to make it better.

575
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,840
Ingrid's really upset.

576
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,280
Fuck! I can't believe
she put me in this position.

577
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,160
I didn't tell you before because

578
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,960
I didn't want you to feel like
you had to marry me.

579
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,360
I found out right before our seminar
that I'm pregnant.

580
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,320
Well? Does that sound good to you?

581
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,560
Well? Does that sound good to you?

582
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,880
I'm still digesting Margot telling Claude.
What a fucking nut job.

583
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,640
Sorry. I think I'm really happy.

584
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,720
Ingrid! Come here, honey.

585
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,960
-Hey.
-Hey.

586
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,320
I'm just looking at Pauline's
incense and self-help books.

587
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,680
I don't understand it.

588
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,400
This junk makes her look stupid,
and she's not.

589
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,840
I don't like to think of her this way.

590
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,000
She is such a hypocrite.

591
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,720
Somehow, I'm a kook
for going to therapy,

592
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,120
yet she's got enough drugs here
to medicate an elephant.

593
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,800
-She's always with these losers.
-Malcolm's not a loser.

594
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,440
-Claude, think about it.
-He's cool.

595
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,480
What makes you think he's cool?

596
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,040
I'm more talking about her investment
in things like cults and ashrams.

597
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,720
-She was in a cult?
-Years ago.

598
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,640
She and Lenny also followed some guru
who was a follower of the Muktananda.

599
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,320
He made her drink his bath water.

600
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,880
Who knows what she's doing now.

601
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,560
Margot? Claude?

602
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,600
-Wizard!
-Wizard!

603
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,720
Wizard!

604
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,080
-How long has he been gone?
-I don't know.

605
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,680
Ingrid brought him in last night,
but we couldn't find him this morning.

606
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,160
-Oh, boy.
-Wizard!

607
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,880
Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?

608
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,200
-I don't know.
-You did.

609
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,680
-Well, I guess I said something.
-You did.

610
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,240
You don't have to tell him everything.

611
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,120
He wants to know.
If I don't tell him, he figures it out.

612
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,480
Mom, where's Wizard?

613
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,200
I don't know, honey.

614
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,080
You didn't let him out
into the road or something

615
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,600
where something could have
happened to him?

616
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,120
Why would you think that's
something I would do? That's awful.

617
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,920
I didn't mean on purpose. I just meant
maybe in case you knew something.

618
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,160
-Sorry. I'm here.
-I didn't see you.

619
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,560
I'm just writing my vows.

620
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,360
Trying to do something appropriate,
but also funny.

621
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,480
Not jokey, more character-based humor.

622
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,120
You having an okay time?

623
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,880
Yeah, besides Wizard getting out.

624
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,280
Yeah. We'll find him.

625
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,400
Or else, I don't know.

626
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,600
-We won't.
-Right.

627
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,200
Or else, he's dead or something.

628
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,080
-It means a lot to Paul that you came.
-Yeah.

629
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,840
That is the same toaster
we had here as kids.

630
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,760
Paul is so weird.

631
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,840
I hear you've heard the news.

632
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,520
Yeah. Congratulations.

633
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,840
Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in.
It's still a little abstract.

634
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,520
I haven't had that thing yet
where you realize

635
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,920
that you're not the most important
person in the world.

636
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,280
I'm anxious for that to happen.

637
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,880
I guess I have to thank you.
I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived.

638
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,160
You're welcome.

639
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,320
Of course I can't help but worry I'll pass
not-so-great genes on to the kid.

640
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,600
I mean, in my family
there's a lot of hand washing, but...

641
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I don't have it, but my brother does.

642
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,600
-Are you working on anything now?
-Besides the thing with Dick?

643
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,440
Oh, right. Yeah.

644
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,560
How about you?

645
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,120
-I'm working on some abstract...
-No one fills the ice cube trays here.

646
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,360
-Sorry, what were you saying?
-No. It's okay.

647
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,720
-No, what were you saying?
-It really... Nothing.

648
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,120
-Okay.
-I was saying I'm working on some

649
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,000
abstractions in acrylic paint,
but it's not...

650
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,840
I'm not getting paid or anything.

651
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,640
I don't know.
I hate that question, "What do you do?"

652
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,280
-You asked me.
-I know, but...

653
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,680
I think we shouldn't mention the tree.

654
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,880
We should let them know there'll be
people and music on Saturday,

655
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,160
and it'll be louder than usual.

656
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,920
Yeah, and they can come over
for a glass of champagne,

657
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,040
but you tell them.
I think they respond to you better.

658
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,920
Well, I am ultimately one of them.

659
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,560
You shouldn't have made me
shave the 'stache.

660
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,600
Yeah, right.

661
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,760
Hey. Ingrid is asking if I was ever gay.
Do you know what that's about?

662
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,680
No.

663
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,560
Hi. I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm.

664
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,200
We met you before.
We're your neighbors.

665
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,560
You gonna cut that tree down?

666
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,960
Well, we grew up with that tree,

667
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,920
and we're getting married
under it on Saturday.

668
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,280
Its roots are growing into our property.
It's rotting. It's killing our plants.

669
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,240
We had the tree doctor out
and he said it was healthy.

670
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,440
-Would it hurt you to say anything?
-What do you want from me?

671
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,680
You're making me do
the whole fucking thing.

672
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,880
-You brought up the tree.
-He brought up the tree.

673
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm sorry. This was better thought
through back at the house.

674
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,400
We were wondering
if you and your wife,

675
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,600
I'm sorry, I forgot her name,
would like to come over for a glass...

676
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,200
You should ask her.
She makes the plans.

677
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,120
I'm gonna go in now.

678
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,280
I feel like you didn't give me a chance
to say what I wanted to say.

679
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,720
-I want to punch that guy in the nose.
-You've never hit anyone.

680
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,040
-I have too!
-Who?

681
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,680
Lots of people. You don't know them.

682
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,560
They're not around
'cause I punched them.

683
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,480
Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny.
I'll punch your sister!

684
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,720
The threat is not out there.

685
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,960
It's in our house.
It's sleeping in my studio.

686
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,160
I mean, I wouldn't actually hit her.

687
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,320
But I feel like doing it.
She's such a fucking idiot.

688
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,000
She's not an idiot.
You might not like her.

689
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,800
She is. She's an idiot! You're an idiot.

690
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,920
-Jesus!
-You're both fucking morons.

691
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,000
I am so fucking... I am trying so hard.

692
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,600
You don't give me any credit!

693
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,960
-What is wrong?
-I don't know.

694
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,320
I have the emotional version
of whatever bad feng shui would be.

695
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,080
I don't know. You tell me.
You understand this shit.

696
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,720
-Did you drink your teas?
-Yeah, I drank my fucking teas.

697
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,840
Really, I think when you look back
at this you're going to see

698
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,120
I'm not acting like a crazy person.
That this is the right reaction.

699
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,120
In proportion with what's going on,
this is right.

700
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,760
Let's make love.

701
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,960
-Jim.
-Hey.

702
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,760
How are you?

703
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,680
-Dad!
-Claude!

704
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,600
Hey.

705
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,960
It was a difficult decision,

706
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,600
because Claude has so many friends
in school now.

707
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,360
But it's expensive, and Bronx Science
is a great public school.

708
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,000
I didn't get into Stuyvesant.

709
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,600
-He's not a good test taker.
-I went to Stuy.

710
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,640
-Really?
-Really.

711
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,640
I'd rather stay at Packer,
but it's so expensive.

712
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,840
Josh is a great test taker,
but Claude thinks more abstractly.

713
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,040
-He's more creative. Right?
-I guess so.

714
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,960
I saw the one-armed man,
who really has two arms, at the bodega.

715
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,280
Really?
Did you give him confusing change?

716
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,520
I did. I tripped him up with some nickels
and a Canadian quarter.

717
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,080
You know what I tried the other day?
Sitting down to pee.

718
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,160
Have you done this, Jim?

719
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,600
No.

720
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,800
I haven't.

721
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
It was a joke, really.
I was gonna call in Pauline

722
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,520
and say, "Guess what I'm doing here?"

723
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,240
Sorry I didn't get to have
that experience.

724
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,960
I was just thinking, you know,

725
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,680
my dad used to say,
"Why stand when you can sit?"

726
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,080
And this is a really good example
of that.

727
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,320
I mean, it took me a long time to try,
'cause I was embarrassed.

728
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,640
But you guys do it all the time.

729
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,000
I never sit in a public place.
I always squat and hover.

730
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,200
Anyway, I recommend it.
At least to try it.

731
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,920
Jim, I'm sorry about the room.

732
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,680
It's usually Malcolm's storage room.
So, it's kind of makeshift right now.

733
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,600
It's fine.

734
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,440
Margot, open your gift.

735
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,080
I get self-conscious opening presents
in front of people.

736
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:08,560
I get self-conscious opening presents
in front of people.

737
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,200
-Anyway, this weekend is about Pauline.
-Pooh, Margot. Go on, open it.

738
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,360
Get on with it. Come on.

739
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,600
Those look warm.

740
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,840
I remember last year in Vermont
you said your feet were freezing.

741
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,080
Thank you.

742
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,920
You're welcome.

743
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,840
I already have slippers.

744
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,040
That's okay. Two sets are fine, right?

745
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,160
It makes me sad to get
a present I already have.

746
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,000
-Why?
-Makes me feel like you don't know me.

747
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,560
What's wrong with your ear?

748
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,640
I asked you not to come
and you did it anyway, so blithely.

749
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,480
We need time alone to sort this out.
You can't just run away.

750
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
Okay, we're here.
I'm giving you this time.

751
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,400
Well...

752
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,880
Now you're putting
too much pressure on me.

753
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,600
What is that?

754
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,240
Keep driving. Jim, Jim. No!

755
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,280
-I'm just seeing.
-No.

756
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,800
Stay right there.

757
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,000
Please help me.

758
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,640
-Please. He got hit by a car.
-Jim.

759
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,400
Jim.

760
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,040
-Careful. He might bite you.
-I got him. I got him.

761
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,960
Hurry, he's dying!

762
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,160
He didn't do anything.

763
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,120
Roger's an innocent.
He's an innocent creature.

764
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,480
-Oh, God.
-Margot.

765
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
I can't stand her.

766
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,920
You paid, didn't you?

767
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,080
She didn't have her purse with her.
It wasn't so expensive.

768
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,520
Roger's gonna live.

769
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,800
I don't give a fuck about Roger,
and that makes me feel like shit.

770
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,600
You make me feel like shit.

771
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,560
-I wouldn't have stopped.
-Of course you would have.

772
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,480
No, I wouldn't have.

773
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,400
-I hate myself when I'm with you.
-Margot, I'm not...

774
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,400
I can't talk to you
when you're this fucked up.

775
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,680
You're just like Claude in that way.
You make me feel guilty.

776
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,640
Sometimes, I find you so despicable.

777
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,080
What's wrong?

778
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,480
I don't know.

779
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,360
Before you gave me your sweater,
I don't think I realized I was cold.

780
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,360
Take me home and go away.

781
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,040
If it were someone else,
I'd understand it. I'd feel sympathy even.

782
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,600
But since it's me,
I just feel bad and horribly critical.

783
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,800
I haven't been able to tell Claude
what's happening,

784
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,120
and I have to. I'm going to.

785
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,360
How can I be all these people?
How can I be married to Jim

786
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,200
and fuck Dick and want them both,
and then neither of them?

787
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,600
I know. We're at that age where
we're becoming invisible to men.

788
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,200
If a guy wants to fuck us,
that's very tempting.

789
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,320
What are you saying?

790
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,440
I'm saying if you get your sense of self
from being fuckable

791
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,360
and that starts to wane, it's very hard.

792
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,000
I almost had an affair, too.
But you don't have to do it.

793
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,120
You can, I don't know,
get a manicure or something.

794
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,880
You know, I tell people
you're my closest friend.

795
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,520
-I really miss you.
-Me, too.

796
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,760
But I can't help feeling
that you really came to my wedding

797
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,600
'cause I live a mile away
from the guy you're fucking.

798
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,680
Come on, Pauline,
you make it sound like I'm using you.

799
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,600
Yeah.

800
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,360
You've got a...

801
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,120
-Did I get it?
-I think so.

802
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,440
Pauline, what are you doing
getting married to this guy?

803
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,520
He's not good enough for you.
He's so coarse.

804
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,760
He's like guys we rejected
when we were 1 6.

805
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,960
You know,
don't make a mistake like this.

806
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,880
I'm sorry. Maybe I have no right to say it.

807
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,120
But you know I'm truthful,
so would you rather I lie?

808
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,080
Who should I be with then?

809
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,200
I don't know.
Someone who's your equal.

810
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,360
You're so smart. You're brilliant.
You're funny.

811
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,480
You're incredibly hilarious.
Paul, you're a great teacher.

812
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,920
You're open to things.
You're so beautiful.

813
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,920
Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up.

814
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,440
I will call the police.
This is our property.

815
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,400
Creeps.

816
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,120
Wizard!

817
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,000
-What happened to your dad?
-He went to Vermont.

818
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,480
He didn't want to come to the wedding?

819
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,080
I don't think he could. I think he couldn't.

820
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,240
-You want to see me dance?
-Okay.

821
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,800
Wizard.

822
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,360
You're not watching.

823
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,120
-Where you going?
-We have to get home.

824
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,640
-Is that your girlfriend?
-No, she's my cousin.

825
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,400
-You a fruity?
-No.

826
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,920
-You a fruity?
-No.

827
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,840
He's a Vogler.

828
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,760
-Come on. He's just a stupid boy.
-Wait. I have a rock in my shoe.

829
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,560
Come on, Ingrid!

830
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,480
Liar!

831
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,520
Ingrid, get him off me!

832
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,400
You're fucking gay. You're fucking gay.

833
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,320
No.

834
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,680
Hangman's ass.

835
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,160
-Don't run so fast.
-He bit me.

836
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,480
-Who bit you?
-A Vogler.

837
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,520
Let me see.

838
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,080
All right. That's it. I'm calling the police.

839
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,200
Don't! It'll get worse.
Why did you say anything to them?

840
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,360
What are you talking about?
This isn't my fault.

841
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,440
That boy bit me 'cause you couldn't
keep your fat mouth shut.

842
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,360
Claude, you're being a jerk.

843
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,960
You shit in your shoes
and then you fuck 'em!

844
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,120
She wrote a story about Lenny and me.

845
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,160
Yeah. It's in here.

846
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,480
I mean, we were talking
almost every day at this point,

847
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,960
and there was no warning.

848
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,960
I mean, maybe a couple of remarks
that she'd used some things of ours.

849
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,440
And then The New Yorker comes,
we have a subscription,

850
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,360
and there's the story.

851
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,920
And it's things we said and did.
Stuff I told her in confidence.

852
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,120
I think it helped end our marriage.

853
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,680
I read it and I thought, "She hates me."

854
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,720
She doesn't hate you.

855
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,160
You think?

856
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,920
Margot tried to murder me
when we were girls.

857
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,360
She put me on a baking sheet,
sprinkled me with paprika,

858
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,280
and put me in the oven.

859
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,440
Jim was here.

860
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,760
Is Jim still writing?

861
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,160
I told him to go to Vermont without me.

862
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,840
I'd like to see him tell a linear story
for a change.

863
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,200
Jim never wanted to make it easy
for the reader, did he?

864
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,520
The nicest man I ever met,
but he can't play the game.

865
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,160
I'm not gonna be joining him.
I'm gonna stay here.

866
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,440
We'll see.

867
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,280
All right?

868
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,000
Okay?

869
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,080
I didn't ask you to do that.

870
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,680
That guy is pointing at us.

871
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,560
I'm very interested in your story
"Middle Children."

872
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,600
The father is a loathsome character,

873
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,240
yet we also feel
a strange sympathy for him.

874
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:27,440
Well, I was really interested in exploring
a father/daughter relationship.

875
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,360
While he clings to her,
desperately, he suffocates her really.

876
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,520
He also silently resents
the responsibility of parenthood.

877
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,560
There's this sexualized
push-pull with Daphne,

878
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,480
-which I find...
-He craves isolation.

879
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,680
I always saw him as someone who

880
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,360
so over-identifies with
everyone around him

881
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,160
that he begins to lose
all sense of himself.

882
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,000
But you make his only recourse
to abandon his family,

883
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,520
-including his beloved daughter.
-Yes, yes, that's true.

884
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,120
I write historical fiction,
so I don't have to answer to this,

885
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,880
but I wonder, for someone
who writes so nakedly about family,

886
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,160
how autobiographical is this portrait?

887
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,200
My father was a loving person.

888
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,240
He had his days, of course,
but he was devoted to us as children.

889
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,640
I would never have written this portrait,
were it true.

890
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:37,160
But I'm interested in how the father
could be, in fact, a portrait of you.

891
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,920
I don't...

892
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,480
Why do you assume that it's...

893
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,240
That, I mean, we all take from life.

894
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,800
I had to have our refrigerator repaired
the other day

895
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,280
at our apartment in Manhattan,

896
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,600
and I was alone with this guy.

897
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,440
I think he was Puerto Rican.

898
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,800
He was sent over by Whirlpool,

899
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,600
who I think it is, makes our fridge.

900
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,480
Although he did say that he worked for
an independent organization,

901
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,760
that Whirlpool subcontracts.

902
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,440
I think he was retarded.

903
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,240
There was...

904
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,440
There was an anger in him,
and suddenly,

905
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,680
suddenly I became afraid for my life.

906
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,680
I called Jim at NYU, and I...

907
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
I asked him to come home.

908
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,720
I think it was Frigidaire
who made our fridge.

909
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,400
I'm gonna need...
I'm gonna need to take a moment here.

910
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,920
You're an asshole.

911
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,680
-I need to be alone right now, okay?
-What's wrong?

912
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,720
I don't know.
I'll tell you sometime. Go on.

913
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,480
Are you sure?

914
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,360
Yeah. Go with Mom. I'll see you later.

915
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,640
-You said Mom.
-You know what I mean.

916
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,560
Go with Pauline.

917
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,640
Jesus, do I need to spell it out for you?

918
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,120
Go with her.

919
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,280
There was blood on the floor,

920
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,360
and it was cold,
and it was snowing inside the hallway.

921
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:06,120
There was all these like
weird like torture devices,

922
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,280
and to get out of them,
you had to like torture yourself.

923
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,080
I wasn't so scared
while it was happening.

924
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,920
I was more scared afterwards.
It was like

925
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,960
I was in it and I was just spectating.

926
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I didn't have to do any of the stuff.

927
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,080
I could teach you to swim if you like.
We wouldn't have to tell your mom.

928
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,600
I don't really want to.

929
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,080
-I like Malcolm.
-You do? Good.

930
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,160
I do, too. I don't know.

931
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,760
It's hard, I think,
to find people in the world

932
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,320
you love more than your family.

933
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,280
You're your mom's favorite.
Do you know that?

934
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,120
She's always liked you best,
more than Jim even.

935
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,200
Has she talked to you yet?

936
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,480
I don't think so. About what?

937
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,480
You okay?

938
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,120
It's hard to see your mom
like that, right?

939
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,480
Get attacked like that?

940
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,160
It was mean what he did.
I think it was really shitty.

941
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,840
-I think Dick's an asshole.
-Yeah.

942
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,800
You know,

943
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,320
your mom's going through
a rough time right now.

944
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,400
And she can be scary when she's angry.

945
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:25,120
Whatever she says, like if she tells you
she's leaving your father, just know,

946
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,840
well, she often changes her mind.

947
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,280
And I don't want you to worry
about anything right now.

948
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,400
-He's cutting it down.
-Good.

949
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,200
My dad's late to pick me up.
I hope I'm not a pain.

950
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,240
You're not a pain, Maisy.

951
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,360
I told Paul
I didn't want you guys to come.

952
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,720
I thought it was interesting.

953
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,480
-What did Paul say?
-I think she liked it.

954
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,400
Yeah, right.

955
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,200
-Did you talk about me afterwards?
-No.

956
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,200
-I can tell you're lying.
-We didn't, Mom.

957
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,160
I don't trust her.

958
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,880
Pauline told me
she's very disappointed in you.

959
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,320
-Why?
-She thinks you laze about the house.

960
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,240
Ingrid's always offering to help
clean and cook.

961
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,040
She made bracelets for all the guests.
Even Malcolm puts up the tent.

962
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:30,320
She made bracelets for all the guests.
Even Malcolm puts up the tent.

963
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,960
You wait until everyone else
does it for you.

964
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,320
-That's not true.
-It is true.

965
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,880
I wish I'd taught you better manners.

966
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,840
I can try to make popovers,
if I can remember how.

967
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,800
Don't bother.

968
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,840
Why are you looking at me like that?

969
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,760
I just see how much you've changed.

970
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:00,760
Your body language.
You used to be rounder, more graceful.

971
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,640
You're so stiff now, so blasé.

972
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,680
I can't explain it.

973
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,760
It's okay though.

974
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,200
You're still handsome.

975
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,800
Are you able to do this yourself?

976
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,480
Pauline, do you want me
to cut it down or not?

977
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,440
Watch the tent.

978
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,760
I liked how it looked on Vogler.

979
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,760
I think it's over between Margot
and Dick. He was so cruel to her today.

980
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,480
And poor Claude had to watch it all.

981
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,720
She should just get out of the marriage,

982
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,920
and then she can fuck
whoever she wants, you know.

983
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,800
And Dick Koosman...

984
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,000
I agree.
I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot.

985
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,800
What does that mean?
You want to fuck Margot?

986
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,640
Pauline, that's not what I said.

987
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,960
I know you have a crush on her.
You already told me that.

988
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,680
I didn't say that!

989
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,280
I said I thought she was attractive
after you grilled me.

990
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,840
She has no interest in me anyway,
not that it would matter if she did.

991
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,600
Have you ever done anything like that?

992
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,440
-What do you mean?
-Have you ever cheated on me?

993
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,720
No! Can I do this?

994
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,440
Those e-mails that you have
with that student of mine?

995
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,560
Did that...

996
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,680
-I know you said it was nothing.
-It was.

997
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,440
I just... Can you say it again?

998
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,480
I just did. Now can I cut down the tree?

999
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,880
-You never did anything with her?
-No.

1000
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,000
She e-mailed me
after that reading at the college,

1001
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,480
-and, you know, we were friends.
-Right.

1002
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,080
Just a regular friendship
between you and a 20-year-old girl.

1003
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,280
Pauline,
how many times do I have to say it?

1004
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,640
But why don't I believe it?

1005
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,680
Because Margot can't understand
why you're with me,

1006
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,960
and now when she's around,
you look for things.

1007
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,960
-You promise?
-I promise.

1008
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,760
Okay. I'm sorry.

1009
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,600
It's okay.

1010
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,280
-I'm gonna tell you something.
-What?

1011
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,040
-I don't want to lose you though, okay?
-What?

1012
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,400
I'm gonna tell you, just let me...

1013
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,800
Maisy.

1014
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,000
-I don't wanna know.
-We didn't really do anything.

1015
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,240
We were goofing around.

1016
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,400
I was making fun of her
'cause she dates a jock.

1017
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,080
I shouldn't have put myself
in that position, I know that.

1018
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,520
We brushed lips.
Really, it was hardly a kiss.

1019
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,200
And then we stopped. That was it.

1020
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,360
Our tongues touched.

1021
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,280
I don't wanna undersell it either.
I mean, we made out.

1022
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,560
I made out with her.

1023
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,920
I don't know why. I don't even like her.

1024
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,360
It's been a heady time.

1025
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:21,800
What are you thinking?
Please tell me what you're thinking.

1026
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,880
Has anyone seen Wizard?

1027
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,000
No. Where's Maisy?

1028
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,280
Hi. Sorry, I had to go.
I hope that's okay. I used yours.

1029
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,120
I love your wedding dress.
It's so unconventional and great.

1030
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,600
-Is everything okay?
-Nothing.

1031
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,040
Hey, Claude,
do you want to play croquet?

1032
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,000
Okay.

1033
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,080
There's Dick!

1034
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,520
Dad!

1035
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,440
Malcolm...

1036
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,240
-Is it almost ready?
-Almost.

1037
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,960
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything! No!

1038
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,360
You fucking sleazebag!

1039
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,640
Fuck off, dickhead! No! No!

1040
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:36,200
-I don't ever want to see you again.
-You fucking dickbag! She's lying!

1041
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,880
Oh, man!

1042
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:00,440
He looked everywhere
and tried to find her

1043
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,840
-Come with me to New York.
-I can't talk about it.

1044
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,600
Okay. But you can't marry him.
I mean, you have to leave.

1045
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,640
We can think about what to do
with the baby when we get to...

1046
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,840
-Margot, I can't.
-Don't turn vague. Listen to me.

1047
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,640
I want you to pack all your things
and get out of here.

1048
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,880
You can take our car
and leave it at the ferry.

1049
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,800
I can make popovers.

1050
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,360
Do you love me? Good.

1051
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,760
Don't you take this out on me.
I'm on your side.

1052
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,800
No, you're not.

1053
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,480
I kept my mouth shut
because I wanted to...

1054
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,080
No, you haven't kept your mouth shut.
No, you haven't kept your mouth shut!

1055
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,280
Okay, I told you. And I was right.
I mean, he's done an insane thing.

1056
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,320
You don't know this man.
What he did is criminal.

1057
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,120
-Margot, I can't.
-It's pedophilia.

1058
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,600
Get out.

1059
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:46,520
Becky and I talk about you,
about what a monster you are.

1060
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,920
Is it 'cause Mom gave me the house?

1061
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,440
We've been talking about you.
Becky can't stand you.

1062
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,320
Becky says you have
borderline personality disorder.

1063
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,400
-What are you saying?
-Can't I have anything?

1064
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,240
What was I thinking?
I can't have anything.

1065
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,640
I let you in. God damn, dude!
You're such an asshole!

1066
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,840
You hate me.
You're such a fucking asshole!

1067
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,160
Get out of my fucking house! Get out!

1068
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,280
I don't recognize you.
It's like you're channeling someone.

1069
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,200
Ingrid!

1070
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,360
Ingrid!

1071
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,240
Ingrid!

1072
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,160
Ingrid!

1073
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,280
Come on.

1074
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,680
Okay.

1075
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:39,280
-It wasn't gonna fall.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1076
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,080
Wizard!

1077
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,720
I thought you couldn't drive.

1078
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,600
Of course I can drive.
Why does everyone say that?

1079
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,160
I used to drive.

1080
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,480
We have to call people and cancel.

1081
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,400
Can I still sing?

1082
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,720
-You do smell.
-Well, I'm not wearing any deodorant.

1083
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,640
-Shit.
-What?

1084
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,160
I don't think... No.
We don't have any brakes.

1085
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,360
-The brakes are bad. That's right.
-What does that mean?

1086
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,200
-What do you think it means?
-I mean, what can we do?

1087
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,040
Mom!

1088
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,960
-Don't!
-Shit!

1089
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,520
I've ruined these shoes.

1090
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,320
Mom, are you okay?

1091
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,280
Don't look. Shit!

1092
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,240
-Mom, what happened?
-Nothing.

1093
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,480
Did she poop in her pants?

1094
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,680
It happens to everyone, not just babies.

1095
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,360
It'll happen to you too, someday.

1096
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,000
I left Mom and Becky a message.

1097
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,040
I don't think Mom knows
how to work the machine.

1098
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,720
I can hear it flapping.

1099
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,560
You should take care of that.
It can hatch eggs.

1100
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,240
Okay, I'm gonna tell him.

1101
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,120
No. I don't want him to...

1102
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,680
And I'll put him on the bus. Bye.

1103
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,240
Sweetie, there's a bus that leaves to
Vermont from town tomorrow morning.

1104
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,360
I just talked to your dad,
and he'll be there to pick you up.

1105
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,080
-Aren't you coming?
-No.

1106
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,640
Why not?

1107
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,560
Because I have to help out
Paul and Ingrid.

1108
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,520
Then I don't want to leave tomorrow.

1109
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,600
There's Malcolm!

1110
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,240
No, honey.

1111
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,880
I can't live in that house alone.

1112
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,440
You're gonna be fine.

1113
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,280
Maybe I could get a place in Brooklyn,
Williamsburg or something.

1114
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,840
People are living there, right?

1115
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,920
No, you don't want to live there.
It's only young people.

1116
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,760
But what do you think of that idea?

1117
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,040
Maybe. Maybe. Let's see.

1118
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,200
Listen, if you don't want
to come with me,

1119
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,640
I'm sure Mom will let you stay with her.

1120
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,840
You're already trying to pass me off
on to Mom.

1121
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,960
Don't say that. You're coming with me.

1122
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,320
You don't even know
where you're gonna live.

1123
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,080
You might have to move in
with Mom, too.

1124
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,000
What?

1125
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,400
You said you were going to tell him.
I'm sorry.

1126
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,560
What have I done?

1127
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,400
What have I done?

1128
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,880
-What?
-Nothing.

1129
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,640
Just then I felt so much love for you.

1130
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,200
Good night, Mommy.

1131
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,760
Hey!

1132
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,760
You cannot write about this.
You can't have it.

1133
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,320
That wasn't about you.

1134
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,440
You already took a part of my life,

1135
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,920
that story you wrote
about Lenny and me.

1136
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,360
-It wasn't about you.
-It ruined our marriage.

1137
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,400
Oh, God.

1138
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,360
You can't have any more.

1139
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,480
And that goes for Ingrid
and Malcolm and Wizard.

1140
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,120
We all own our own rights.
They're not for sale.

1141
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,160
Give it back. Give it.

1142
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,600
If I could read your handwriting,
I'm sure I'd be furious.

1143
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,680
But if I ever see a story that involves
a hotel room or any of this shit,

1144
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,640
I will fucking take your bowels out.

1145
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,360
You've now successfully ruined
two of my marriages.

1146
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,480
You're not wearing any underwear.

1147
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,000
It's hot. I'm pregnant. Move over. Jesus.

1148
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,040
You're not hot. Your feet are cold.

1149
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,640
Stop touching me. I am so hot.
Feel my head.

1150
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,520
You got a fever.

1151
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,320
I don't have a fever. I'm pregnant.

1152
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,760
-Are you always like this?
-Get used to it.

1153
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,320
Mom and Becky share a bed.
You and I will probably get the other.

1154
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,760
You should just go to Vermont.

1155
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,800
You know, I was thinking,

1156
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,400
if you want,
you and Ingrid could go to Vermont.

1157
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,960
Keep Claude company.

1158
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,360
Jim adores you.

1159
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,680
You don't like Malcolm
because you're not attracted to him.

1160
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,600
-Will you do it?
-No.

1161
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,040
I won't do that for you.

1162
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,120
Did you two talk about me today?

1163
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,080
What did you say?

1164
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,880
I told him you often change your mind.

1165
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,480
I'm sorry, sweetie.
There's something wrong with me.

1166
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,800
-I'm gonna call him.
-Don't do that, I'm telling you...

1167
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,240
I need some clothes and things.

1168
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,120
He should get the hell out of our house.

1169
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,360
Okay, I'll tell him to get the hell out
of our house.

1170
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,200
You left it in my room.

1171
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,000
The tent looks so lonely.

1172
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,760
There's no one to get married in it.

1173
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,480
I know, and it's totally smashed.

1174
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,800
I'm such a fucking idiot.
Please don't take me seriously.

1175
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,400
I mean, take me seriously,
but not the fucked-up parts, you know.

1176
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,320
I love you so much. Please marry me.

1177
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,520
You can't do what you did again.
Do you understand?

1178
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,400
I promise.

1179
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,320
No matter how tempting.

1180
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,280
I don't know. I don't know.

1181
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:33,440
I ate some of the cake.
I don't know why, but I did it.

1182
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,400
Well, how was it?

1183
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,480
Good.

1184
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,160
Not too sweet? They sometimes make
their stuff too sweet.

1185
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,600
Maybe.

1186
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Maybe it was. I didn't even notice.

1187
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,040
They fucked up the cake. How sad.

1188
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,360
I miss you. I love our little baby.

1189
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,040
I miss you.

1190
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,600
I miss you, too.
Maybe we should do another seminar.

1191
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,560
I can't understand you, honey.

1192
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,960
Honey, I can't understand you.

1193
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,640
There's Nana and Aunt Becky,
and they have ice cream.

1194
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,400
They didn't get my message.

1195
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,400
I told you, she doesn't know
how to work the machine.

1196
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,360
What, you're not coming?

1197
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,320
I'm coming. I'm coming.
What did he say?

1198
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,000
-Mom!
-Nana!

1199
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,920
-What did he say?
-Nana!

1200
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,480
-Mom, hey.
-Hey, was that Margot I saw?

1201
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,120
-Don't look, keep walking.
-Why are we going this way?

1202
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,640
We have to get you to your bus.

1203
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,160
Did you do something?

1204
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,880
What do you mean, do something?

1205
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,040
I mean,
why is the wedding not happening?

1206
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,720
Is it something that you did?

1207
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,160
Pauline has transferred
all of her stuff onto me.

1208
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,720
I don't understand her anymore.

1209
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:05,200
Why did she pick that guy?
It's really berserk.

1210
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:09,280
You know, she referred to me
as her closest friend.

1211
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,840
We never see one another.
I mean, we're not close,

1212
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,800
even if we wanted to be.

1213
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,280
But was there anything real?

1214
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,080
No. How many times do I have to say it?

1215
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,160
Jesus, do you think that little of me?

1216
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:37,360
It's good you're going.
I wouldn't want to be around me, either.

1217
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,840
Are you gonna find
Pauline and Nana after I leave?

1218
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,960
I don't know. Maybe I'll go to church.

1219
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,960
-Are you angry at me?
-No, honey, I'm not mad at you.

1220
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,280
Everything's fine.
I'm not mad at anyone.

1221
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,320
-Can you come with me?
-No. You know that.

1222
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,520
Now we should talk about
the next few months a little bit,

1223
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,080
-and what's gonna happen.
-I don't like Vermont.

1224
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,840
Your dad is gonna be very happy
to see you,

1225
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,120
and I'm sure Josh is just
dying to hang out.

1226
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,880
Please come, Mom.

1227
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,080
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

1228
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,680
You used to need me
to watch you when you played.

1229
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,720
What do you mean?

1230
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,040
When you first started playing
with friends, you wouldn't do it,

1231
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,000
unless I was watching.

1232
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,600
You were always afraid
I was gonna go out the back door.

1233
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,440
I don't know
where you thought I would go.

1234
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,200
Our backyard didn't lead anywhere.

1235
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,040
I masturbated last night.

1236
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,480
While everyone was asleep,
I went into the bathroom and did it.

1237
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,760
You don't need to tell me that, sweetie.

1238
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,360
-You've got to go.
-How will you get home?

1239
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,040
I don't know.

1240
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:50,320
Maybe I'll get Dick to drive me to the...

1241
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,760
I lost the word for a second, the train.

1242
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,680
Come on.
You always don't want to leave me,

1243
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,360
and you always have a good time
once you do.

1244
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:07,640
-I think you like getting away from me.
-I don't. I like hanging out with you.

1245
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,480
They make your face look too wide.

1246
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,600
-See you soon.
-Bye, sweetie.

1247
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,560
Say you'll see me soon.

1248
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,800
Hey, you're acting like a baby. Go on.

1249
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,800
Wait!

1250
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,280
Wait!

1251
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,840
Wait!

1252
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,480
Wait!

1253
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,160
-Did you see me running out there?
-Yeah.

1254
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,760
That was a lot of running.

1255
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,120
I'm out of breath.

1256
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,160
