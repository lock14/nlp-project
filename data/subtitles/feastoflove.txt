1
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:41,957
Harry?
- It's all right, Esther.

2
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:44,963
I can't sleep.

3
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,855
<i>There is a story</i>
<i>about the Greek gods.</i>

4
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:16,358
<i>They were bored,</i>
<i>so they invented human beings,</i>

5
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:20,323
<i>but they were still bored,</i>
<i>so they invented love.</i>

6
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,754
<i>Then they weren't bored any longer,</i>

7
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:27,878
<i>so they decided to try love</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

8
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:32,947
<i>And finally they invented laughter,</i>

9
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,609
<i>so they could stand it.</i>

10
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:09,639
- Harry!
Bradley?

11
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:11,264
What are you doing away from Jitters?

12
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,205
I just took the afternoon off. I...

13
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:17,138
My wife's got a softball game
out here today.

14
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,228
Ah.

15
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,568
Honey?

16
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,264
Hey, I'd like you to meet
Professor Stevenson.

17
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:24,468
Harry, this is Kathryn.

18
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,127
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

19
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:28,294
He's a... He's a regular over at the shop.

20
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:31,832
Take her down!
One more! One more!

21
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:35,960
She seems very determined.
- You have no idea.

22
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,929
Wait for your pitch, sweetie.

23
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:40,723
Yeah!

24
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,764
- There it is! There it is! Okay, take two!
Gray! Melissa!

25
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:46,058
There you go!
- Right here.

26
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:48,185
Yeah!

27
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:51,091
Don't even think about it.

28
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,490
Not bad, huh?

29
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,356
- Not bad.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

30
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,425
Take the lead. Go! Go!

31
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,819
Nice save out there.

32
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:05,722
Don't say I didn't warn you.

33
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,346
I'm sorry about it.

34
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:32,646
No. Well, that's true, though.
Answer me this.

35
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,909
If your sport's
suddenly being taken seriously,

36
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,846
how come we're wearing long pants
and you guys are still wearing shorts?

37
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,610
Because we're hot.

38
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:42,040
Oh!

39
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,103
Hmm!

40
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:45,713
- Hey, that was a great play.
- Thank you.

41
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,177
Join us. Sit down.

42
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:50,235
- Yeah.
- Why not?

43
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,067
It was really good. Very athletic.

44
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:56,201
- Hey, I'm Jenny.
- Hi. Kathryn.

45
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:59,901
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Bradley Smith. I'm her other half.

46
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:01,937
And this is Harry Stevenson.

47
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,872
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

48
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,639
How long have you guys been married?

49
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,899
- Almost...
- Six years and a little bit of change.

50
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,300
You know, I think I'm going to go
put some money in that jukebox.

51
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:17,564
Will you save my spot for me?

52
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:19,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,893
Oh.

54
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,935
Anyway, I mean,
I could tell you one thing, they...

55
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:24,992
They take the game seriously.

56
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, they're practicing
three nights a week.

57
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,862
Well, that's how you get it done.
Yeah?

58
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,132
If you'd studied that hard, Bradley,
you might have been a decent student.

59
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,187
I agree.

60
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:43,985
<i>I want to see</i>

61
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:45,584
- Hi.
- Hi.

62
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:47,355
<i>what people saw</i>

63
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:49,117
<i>I want to feel</i>

64
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:50,182
Hi.

65
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:54,521
<i>Like I felt before</i>

66
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:59,115
<i>I want to see</i>
<i>the kingdom come</i>

67
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,521
Excuse me. Thank you.

68
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,180
<i>I want to feel</i>

69
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:04,348
Yeah, well, thank you.

70
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:06,249
<i>Forever young</i>

71
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,310
You hear that song?

72
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:12,716
That song goes out
from Jenny to Kathryn.

73
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,184
From now on, that'll be our song.

74
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,612
<i>I want to live in a world</i>
<i>where I belong</i>

75
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:24,911
<i>I want to live</i>

76
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:29,274
555-2189.

77
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:34,372
<i>And I believe that</i>
<i>it won't be very long</i>

78
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:38,144
<i>If we turn, turn</i>

79
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,975
Harry?
- Hey.

80
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:49,403
How was your walk? Did I miss anything?

81
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:54,007
A cool breeze, softball game,

82
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:56,336
and two women falling in love.

83
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:01,798
- With each other?
- And one of them is married.

84
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:04,896
Funny thing is, nobody noticed.

85
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:08,071
Not even the husband, two feet away.

86
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:12,927
- I'm sorry I missed that.
- I imagine he will be, too.

87
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,093
His name is Bradley Smith.

88
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,523
Went to school with Aaron.

89
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,120
- Good morning, Professor.
- Oscar.

90
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:52,187
Where's Bradley?

91
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,949
He called in.
Said he'll be a little late this morning.

92
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,879
- No peeking.
- No peeking.

93
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:59,183
All right. Here we go. Ready?

94
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:10,440
Oh, God. Forget it! No way!
There is no way that I'm going in there!

95
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,007
Honey, honey...
Honey, this is really important.

96
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:14,778
Why are you doing this to me?

97
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,476
Because you can't go through
your entire life

98
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,947
being afraid of little puppies.

99
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:21,276
Yes, I can! I hate dogs. They bite.

100
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:22,576
No, no, no, no.
They're not gonna bite you.

101
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:25,478
They're in little cages. I promise.

102
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,536
- I don't care.
- Okay. Okay.

103
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:32,203
Look, just take a... Take a step.

104
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,835
We'll just go in. We'll check it out.
If you get nervous, we'll come right back.

105
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,596
Hmm?

106
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:50,834
Look. See how adorable they are?

107
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,105
Say hi.

108
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,629
Hello... Otis.

109
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,602
"Otis"?

110
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:04,325
You know, he just looks like an Otis.

111
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:05,923
Oh.

112
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:09,265
Hi, Sophie. Aren't you a pretty girl?

113
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:16,923
Hey, Gordon, don't be sad.
Somebody's gonna pick you, okay?

114
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:21,187
Randolph needs a haircut.

115
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,118
And this one...

116
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:29,251
This one is Bradley.

117
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:32,725
Bradley, meet Bradley.

118
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,386
And she was right. This dog, Harry,

119
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:44,786
it looks exactly like me.

120
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:47,322
Didn't you tell me
your wife was afraid of dogs?

121
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:50,719
No, no, no. Not anymore. I mean, she...
I cured her.

122
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:55,586
See, I think Kathryn was trying
to send me a subliminal message.

123
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:59,552
I think she was telling me
that she wanted that dog,

124
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,913
the dog, Harry,
the dog she named after me,

125
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:07,144
as a gift. Maybe for her birthday.

126
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,505
In fact, I know it. What do you think?

127
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:15,774
- I think I'd proceed with caution.
- No, you don't understand. We need a dog.

128
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,370
I have been telling her
we should have a baby.

129
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:20,004
She's the one who keeps saying
she's not ready.

130
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,601
Bradley, if you get the dog,

131
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:28,667
you're telling her that you know her
better than she knows herself.

132
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:29,801
So?

133
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:33,209
So, you better be right.

134
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:42,868
You know what I feel like doing?
I feel like just driving over there

135
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,370
and grabbing the little guy
before somebody else gets him.

136
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,528
So just do it, though, you know? Go for it.

137
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,662
Yeah? You think?

138
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:50,226
You only live once.

139
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:51,793
Probably.

140
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,857
Harry?

141
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:55,494
Why are you asking me, Bradley?
Your mind's made up.

142
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,297
Well, not entirely.

143
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:03,825
- Hey, you need anybody to work here?
- Yes! Yeah.

144
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,225
I mean, if that's all right with you.

145
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,791
You...

146
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:14,423
You have any experience
with this kind of work?

147
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,654
- No.
Neither did I when I started.

148
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,594
- Do you like coffee?
- Not much.

149
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,994
She'll learn to love it.

150
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,191
But why here?

151
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:26,183
I don't know.

152
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,749
I just kind of felt
a harmonic convergence in this place.

153
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:31,950
She's right, you know?
I felt the same kind of thing.

154
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:34,981
Ah.

155
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:36,044
Bradley.

156
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:42,479
I think you'd better hire the girl
or you're going to lose Oscar.

157
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:43,679
And if you lose Oscar,

158
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:46,652
you're never gonna make it to the
Humane Society in time to get the dog.

159
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,710
Good point. You're hired.

160
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,610
Man the fort. Keys!

161
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,216
Thank you.

162
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,375
Hello?

163
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:05,639
Hi.

164
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:10,769
<i>Sometimes you don't know</i>
<i>you've crossed a line</i>

165
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:12,971
<i>until you're already on the other side.</i>

166
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,739
- Hey.
- Hi.

167
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:15,799
Thanks.

168
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,845
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>by then it's too late.</i>

169
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,638
- You good?
- Yeah.

170
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,039
All right.

171
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,938
Don't be nervous, okay?

172
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:34,533
Who says I'm nervous?

173
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,904
It must be pretty weird
to be married and straight,

174
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,802
and suddenly
you're thinking about a woman.

175
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,530
Yeah, well.

176
00:12:43,604 --> 00:12:47,659
- Who said anything about...
- It's right there. It's in your eyes.

177
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:50,659
Big, beautiful, hazel eyes.

178
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,961
Oh, man, we're going to have adventures,
you and me.

179
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,520
It's going to be, like, Kathryn and Jenny.

180
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,557
Jenny and Kathryn.

181
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:15,458
- Name?
- Chloe.

182
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,720
- Barlow.
- "Chloe"?

183
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,118
It used to be plain old Chloe,
but I customized it.

184
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,657
- Really?
- Yeah.

185
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:27,519
Well, you know, Chloe...

186
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:33,746
You're really pretty.
Has anybody ever told you that?

187
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:38,184
I think I scare guys off
because I'm so intense.

188
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:41,480
Well, you don't have to worry about me
in that department.

189
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:44,179
- Really?
- Really.

190
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:45,307
Uh-huh?

191
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,346
That's the second time this week.

192
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,739
Yeah, what are the odds?

193
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,375
Not two women again?

194
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,846
No, more conventional this time.

195
00:13:57,914 --> 00:14:00,846
Classical, in fact, like Romeo and Juliet.

196
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:05,144
They laid eyes on each other
and their fates were sealed.

197
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,774
Life will never be the same
for either one of them again.

198
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,639
Now, don't you go
falling in love at first sight.

199
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,807
Too late, my dear. I already did.

200
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,472
Did you talk to the dean today?

201
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,436
If you're going to go back
to teaching next semester,

202
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,301
you've got to let him know.

203
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:29,565
Esther...

204
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,096
I'm aware of that.

205
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,860
You know how every relationship has, like,
a perfect day?

206
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,053
Yeah.

207
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,684
What do you mean?

208
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:07,453
It's just this day

209
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:10,254
and you look back years later

210
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,349
and it stands out from all the rest,
you know?

211
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:17,251
Not because you won the lottery
or anything, just...

212
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,447
Just an average day, but somehow...
You know, perfect.

213
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,416
Today's like that.

214
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:39,774
Excuse me. Hey. Hello.

215
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,943
Yeah, I know. Me too.

216
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:06,504
This should be interesting.

217
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,474
- Please, Aggie.
- Bradley.

218
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:11,100
I only need you to keep him till Friday,
Kathryn's birthday.

219
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:14,264
- Kathryn is scared of dogs.
- Not anymore.

220
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,999
- I took her to the pound.
- But...

221
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:18,129
Besides, isn't that
what relationships are all about?

222
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:19,865
Overcoming your deepest fears?

223
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,596
- His name is Bradley Jr.
- Did you think of that one all by yourself?

224
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:24,898
No, smartass.

225
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:27,400
Billy, your Uncle Bradley's here!
He brought along a friend.

226
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,957
- I'm gonna miss you. Here you go.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

227
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,668
- Only until Friday.
- Yeah.

228
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,327
He likes you.

229
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,480
Well, would you look at that?

230
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,715
They have completely moved out,
hammock and everything.

231
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,721
You never heard such screaming.

232
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:14,846
The movers told them to shut the hell up

233
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:18,012
or they'd throw
all their things in the street.

234
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,981
Remember when they first moved in here?

235
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:26,041
I said I'd never seen a happier couple.

236
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:27,674
What did I tell you?

237
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:31,141
It's the house. It's cursed.

238
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:35,809
Houses aren't cursed, now. People are.

239
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,275
You're a jock, huh?

240
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:51,674
I used to be.

241
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:54,076
That was a long time ago.

242
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:59,064
That's my mom.
She took off when I was in junior high.

243
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,265
Bat drove her away.

244
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:05,568
- Bat?
- My dad. His name's Bathold.

245
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:09,900
People call him the Bat, so that ought
to tell you something, right?

246
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,263
Yeah, he blows up tree stumps for a living.

247
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:16,269
Then he comes home,
thinks about my mom,

248
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:18,165
and gets shitfaced.

249
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,728
Yours?

250
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,856
Yeah.

251
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:32,864
My mom gave it to me when I was a kid.

252
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,457
Do you sleep with him?

253
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:40,728
Yeah. What? Is that bad?
He's a great little spoon.

254
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,983
Ex-jock druggie
who still has a teddy bear?

255
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:49,454
Nothing hotter than that.

256
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:53,052
And what makes you think I'm a druggie?

257
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:56,319
Pisces, Virgo rising.

258
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,782
What was it? Coke?

259
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:03,611
E?

260
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,818
Heroin?

261
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:08,845
Sure, why not?

262
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,647
So, why'd you quit?

263
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,184
What makes you think I quit?

264
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:24,213
Oh, right. Pisces, Virgo rising.

265
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,079
Very good.

266
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:34,912
I had this dream one night
while I was wasted.

267
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,933
There was this African monkey
whispering all this creepy shit in my ear.

268
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:46,634
He said that if I didn't get clean
I was gonna die young,

269
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:51,469
OD in an alleyway on a pile of garbage.

270
00:19:55,508 --> 00:20:01,564
And that morning I woke up
and I went to my first meeting.

271
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:07,928
It was seven months and two weeks ago.

272
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:14,861
I can prove it. I got my six-month chip.

273
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,055
Cool.

274
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,292
It doesn't scare you?

275
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:31,856
Most junkies, you know,
even if they never use again,

276
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:36,552
it doesn't matter. It's too late.

277
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:41,818
They're just gone,
you know, permanent zombies.

278
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:46,516
But then there's junkies where
all the horrible places they've been,

279
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,151
all the horrible shit they've done,

280
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:54,288
the fact that they come back from it

281
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:59,217
makes them better people
than if they'd never used in the first place.

282
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:04,482
That's you.

283
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:30,511
Hey, where's the little girl's room?

284
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:31,971
Across the hall.

285
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,238
Okay.

286
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:43,233
Oh, shit!

287
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,204
Oscar! Goddamn it!
You get that girl out of your room, Oscar!

288
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:48,297
Get the fuck away!

289
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,032
You do it right now, damn it!
Do you hear me?

290
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:52,163
I should have warned you.
I didn't think he'd be back this early.

291
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,136
Oscar! I ain't running
a motel around here!

292
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:55,932
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I heard you!

293
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:58,799
- Maybe we should just go out the window.
- No!

294
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:00,801
We're going out the way we came in.

295
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,664
Oscar.
- You ready?

296
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:18,157
Hello, missy.

297
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,094
Pleased to meet you. The name's Chloe.

298
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:23,061
Yeah, well, don't you come in this house
again unless I invite you.

299
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,492
There'll be trouble
I can't be responsible for.

300
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:27,884
You hear me?

301
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,454
Hey, don't be scared, all right?

302
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:39,252
He is a mean son of a bitch,
but I can be, too.

303
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:44,519
I'll protect you from anything.

304
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,376
Bradley, we have to talk.

305
00:22:58,653 --> 00:23:00,049
No, hold on.

306
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:11,445
That's really sweet.

307
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,672
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

308
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,301
It's a dog.

309
00:23:25,144 --> 00:23:29,041
No. No, no. That's not... It's the dog.

310
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,007
That's Bradley Jr.
That's the dog you picked out.

311
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:34,905
But I hate dogs and you know that.

312
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:37,701
No, you don't. You... You love dogs.

313
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:41,500
I would have said anything
to get out of that room.

314
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,763
I don't want a goddamn dog!

315
00:23:45,837 --> 00:23:49,769
And you know that, but you
got me one anyway, because you...

316
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:53,700
- Okay. Okay, time out, Kathryn...
- Because you have no idea who I am.

317
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:58,927
I mean, I might as well be invisible to you.
What color are my eyes, Bradley?

318
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,660
- What?
- Yeah, what color are my eyes?

319
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,828
- Green!
- Hazel!

320
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:09,853
My eyes are hazel! I mean, Christ!
You're an artist!

321
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:12,590
Okay, but there's a little greenish,
hazel tint.

322
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:14,653
All right, listen,
we're rushing the dog thing.

323
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,718
- You're right.
- No.

324
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:18,660
No, it's not just the dog thing
or the eye thing. It's everything.

325
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:22,160
It's every goddamn thing!
I cannot do this for one more day!

326
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,489
- It's like I don't even exist!
- What? You're leaving?

327
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,390
- Oh, so now you don't miss a thing.
- Where are you going with this?

328
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:30,891
You know the shortstop,
the one that you asked over to our table?

329
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:33,890
Yes! She tagged you out.

330
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:38,315
Yeah, well,
I'm not the only one she tagged out.

331
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,548
But you wouldn't know that,

332
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:41,679
because you have your
head so far up your ass.

333
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:44,311
Wait, you... You're friends with her?

334
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,679
Wow. Goodbye, Bradley.

335
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:04,213
If Kathryn's meant to be with women,
so be it,

336
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:09,270
but I just can't help but think
maybe I did something to cause it.

337
00:25:10,381 --> 00:25:11,367
Mmm?

338
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,038
To put her off men forever.

339
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:20,905
But what? Never cheated.

340
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:23,765
I didn't lie.

341
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,500
I made love to her on a regular basis.

342
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,001
She fell in love, that's all.

343
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,096
One minute she was married,

344
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,498
next minute there was this person
right in front of her,

345
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:52,090
whom she couldn't ignore
no matter how hard she tried.

346
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,432
How do you know that?

347
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,089
Well, I was there when they met.
So were you.

348
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:06,394
Bradley, look.
Try focusing on simple pleasures.

349
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:09,023
You know? Small blessings.

350
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:11,285
Hmm.

351
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,987
Like... Like what?

352
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:17,116
That's not for me to say.

353
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,791
- I got my hair, right, Harry?
- There's a start.

354
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:22,982
Okay.

355
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:26,144
Well...

356
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:31,688
- I got this place.
- Best espresso in Portland. The best!

357
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:36,044
- I got my little dog.
- A loyal companion.

358
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:38,278
I'm really sorry, Bradley,

359
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:41,911
but you can't have the dog back.
We're going to keep him.

360
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,250
Agatha, that's my dog.

361
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:46,078
Not anymore. He's bonded with us.

362
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:47,615
- No...
- His name is Gumbo now.

363
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,172
Wait! Wait. Wait.

364
00:26:50,616 --> 00:26:51,708
We had a deal.

365
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:54,680
Well, that was then and this is now.
I'm so sorry, Bradley,

366
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,108
but Billy loves the dog
and we love the dog.

367
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:01,169
Don't talk to me about love, okay?
My wife left me.

368
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:03,372
- I know.
- Okay? For another woman.

369
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:07,105
I'm alone, okay?
I want a dog. I need that dog!

370
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:08,576
Brad... Bradley!

371
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:11,633
My heart goes out to you, sweetie.
I think Kathryn is a selfish bitch.

372
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:13,175
I think what you should do
is go straight to the pound

373
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:16,231
- and pick yourself out another dog.
- We had a deal!

374
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:20,172
I know. Well, I have to take it back.
It's null and void.

375
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,968
Aggie, I need that dog, okay? Please. I...

376
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,471
This is not a joke.
I'm talking about my stability, here.

377
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:28,935
- I know. I'm really sorry, Bradley, but...
- No...

378
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:32,697
As Billy's mother,
my responsibility is to him first, okay?

379
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:34,598
- Good luck.
- No. No!

380
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:37,063
Aggie!

381
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:16,482
Hi, Bradley.
Hi. Oh, God. How you doing?

382
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,614
Huh?

383
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:20,212
I missed you. I missed you so much.

384
00:28:20,923 --> 00:28:22,750
Uncle Bradley?

385
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:26,015
Hey, how you doing, Billy?
Come over here.

386
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,777
Come on.

387
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:30,979
I wanted to have a little talk with you.
How are you?

388
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:33,483
- Mom's not here.
- No, I know. I know.

389
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:37,244
I just... I don't know if you've heard or not,

390
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:40,714
but your Aunt Kathryn

391
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:46,044
has gone away to a place
where boys aren't allowed.

392
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:50,469
And I'm all alone in the world, kiddo,
and I need...

393
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:53,011
- I need Bradley Jr.
- Who?

394
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,236
- Bonkers.
- Who's that?

395
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:58,868
- Bingo, the dog. I need this dog.
- But he's mine.

396
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:01,932
I know, I know, and someday,
when you get a little older,

397
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:05,805
we're going to have a long conversation
about the nature of deals, you and I, okay?

398
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,136
But I'll tell you what.
Right now, look at this.

399
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:13,163
I want you to go buy yourself
a brand new dog.

400
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,172
On me. Okay?

401
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,500
But that's not enough.

402
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:19,730
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's not.

403
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:23,530
It's... Okay, okay, okay.

404
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:28,290
- You can buy a horse with that.
- It's still not enough.

405
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,160
Billy?

406
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,057
- Mom!
- Okay, okay.

407
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:34,259
Is that Uncle Bradley's car?

408
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,231
I'm keeping the leash.

409
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:40,825
I'm taking this.

410
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:56,186
The newspaper said there was gonna be
a meteor shower tonight.

411
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,419
So...

412
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:02,821
I figured this would be the best place
to see it.

413
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:12,249
Hey, you know how
when people are super rich,

414
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:17,084
they got those hallways at the front
of the house, you know, by the front door?

415
00:30:17,154 --> 00:30:20,211
<i>And they put those</i>
<i>grandfather clocks there and...</i>

416
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:24,412
- You mean like a foyer.
- Yes! Yes, like a foyer.

417
00:30:25,618 --> 00:30:29,105
All right. It's the future, okay?

418
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:33,309
So picture this, Oscar of the future,

419
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:39,372
and I'm heading home from whatever
cool thing it is that I decide to do.

420
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:43,278
- Where am I?
- You? You're in the house.

421
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:46,270
- We live together?
- Of course we live together.

422
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,334
What do you think?

423
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:51,376
- What kind of house?
- Big.

424
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:55,342
I go get the mail out of the box,
and we've got these huge fucking bills.

425
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:00,772
Never seen anything like it.
Dentist, mortgage, electricity...

426
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:04,864
The guy, you know,
that looks at your eye when you can't...

427
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,701
- The optometrist?
- Yeah, him. He's there.

428
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:10,670
And you're in the foyer.

429
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,400
And you look out the window
and you see me.

430
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:18,263
See my face?

431
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,926
- Yeah.
- Do I look scared?

432
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:23,694
No. You look happy.

433
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:26,628
You know why?

434
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,296
Because I can pay those bills.

435
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:35,862
We got tons of money
and I'm not scared of anything.

436
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,326
All right, your turn.

437
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:46,423
- My turn what?
- The future.

438
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:53,691
- Close your eyes. What do you see?
- Okay.

439
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:58,852
- Nothing.
- Just look.

440
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:06,949
Okay, in the foyer, I see...

441
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:09,477
A table...

442
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:12,176
And...

443
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:16,250
- A staircase.
- Excellent.

444
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:19,145
I'm going up the stairs.

445
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:22,078
Get to the top yet?

446
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:23,980
Almost.

447
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:26,338
What's up those stairs?

448
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:30,771
Look, Oscar.

449
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:33,371
Kids.

450
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:36,808
So many kids I can't count.

451
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:40,176
They're our kids.

452
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,708
I was hoping you'd say that.

453
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:46,538
- Really?
- I told you.

454
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:50,665
I'm not scared of anything.

455
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:56,537
<i>Hallelujah</i>
<i>Hallelujah</i>

456
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:00,497
<i>Hallelujah</i>

457
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:06,593
<i>Hallelujah</i>

458
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:17,662
<i>A man living alone</i>
<i>is a king of sorts.</i>

459
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:22,096
<i>Unfortunately, his kingdom is small,</i>
<i>with very few comforts.</i>

460
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:26,221
<i>Bradley looked up from his paper one day</i>
<i>and realized</i>

461
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,422
<i>that no one burns for him.</i>

462
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:36,851
Harry, I really feel like it's time
for me to get on with my life, you know?

463
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:42,051
- Put the past behind me.
- That's a positive step, my friend.

464
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:43,887
- Yeah.
- I gotta go.

465
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:53,981
- Hi.
- Hey.

466
00:33:54,057 --> 00:33:57,920
Can I have a coffee? Large, black, to go.

467
00:33:57,989 --> 00:33:59,510
Thanks.

468
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:06,846
- I think I've seen you in here before.
- Probably.

469
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:11,148
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

470
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,311
- You looking to buy a house?
- Sell one, actually.

471
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,807
What about you?

472
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,244
What about me?

473
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:27,143
You're not looking to buy a house,
are you?

474
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:31,534
- Rent, maybe.
- Really?

475
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:37,369
- Well, sit down.
- Okay.

476
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,465
Um...

477
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:42,164
How many bedrooms?

478
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:43,329
Uh...

479
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:48,396
Two. One for me,
and maybe one for a little studio.

480
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:50,632
- I paint sometimes.
- Okay.

481
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:55,360
The place that I have right now
is actually perfect,

482
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:58,402
except it's haunted

483
00:34:59,536 --> 00:35:01,398
by a woman.

484
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,458
She's a lesbian.

485
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:08,728
My ex-wife left me for another woman.

486
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,929
Oh, I see.

487
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:17,260
- Shit!
- No, we get this here. Hold on.

488
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:19,795
- We get this a lot, actually.
- Yeah.

489
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:23,592
They said this was going to be a big one,
but I didn't believe them.

490
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,719
Yeah.

491
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:29,788
- It looks like you've got that under control.
- You think?

492
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:35,452
Do you mind if I smoke?

493
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,784
No.

494
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:39,748
Of course I did hear a rumor

495
00:35:39,824 --> 00:35:42,085
that those things are supposed to be
bad for your health.

496
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:43,952
Not these. They're organic.

497
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:46,512
Oh! Those are the ones that cure cancer.

498
00:35:46,922 --> 00:35:48,353
Exactly.

499
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,514
Look at that. Brilliant.

500
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,449
Not according to my ex.

501
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:03,313
She said that I had my head
so far up my ass I never saw her.

502
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:06,911
And was she right?

503
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:11,840
I'm afraid so.

504
00:36:14,614 --> 00:36:16,512
So you're the honest type.

505
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:17,739
To a fault.

506
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,166
Diana Croce.

507
00:36:26,378 --> 00:36:28,842
I'm Bradley Smith.

508
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:33,137
It's been really nice talking to you,
Bradley, but I gotta be somewhere.

509
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:37,699
Call me.

510
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:57,759
Yeah!

511
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:02,389
Oh, my God.

512
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:07,125
David, this wine is excellent.
Do you want a glass?

513
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:11,353
Well, that was quick.

514
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,786
- Yeah.
- You gotta be somewhere?

515
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:18,521
- Yeah, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
- What? You've got a meeting?

516
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:21,219
Karen's car is in the shop.
I gotta pick up my son at swim practice.

517
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:23,123
So, I've got about 10 minutes
to get across town.

518
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:27,125
Listen. Tuesday. Noon.

519
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:30,652
I will bring even better wine,
some lunch. I promise.

520
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,817
I'm really sorry.

521
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:38,121
- I can't do it.
- What do you mean?

522
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:44,577
I have an appointment
to show somebody a house.

523
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:48,280
- What? You can't change that?
- No, actually.

524
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:53,909
It's this guy that I met, Bradley Smith.
Runs this little coffeehouse called Jitters.

525
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,541
That's the only time he can make it.

526
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,278
Okay.

527
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:09,840
Well, I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

528
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,175
Why did you say that?

529
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:48,730
Hey, Oscar, I want you to...

530
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:59,693
Goddamn it!

531
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:03,494
That fucking bitch!

532
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:29,778
- Morning.
- Hey.

533
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:36,548
Honey, this isn't working out.

534
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:38,278
You guys are gonna have to find a place
of your own.

535
00:39:38,353 --> 00:39:39,681
Yeah.

536
00:39:40,786 --> 00:39:45,079
I'm working on it.
Nothing in here we can afford. I...

537
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:52,769
Well, I know a way you and Oscar
can make some money.

538
00:39:56,181 --> 00:39:58,043
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

539
00:40:08,478 --> 00:40:09,806
Thank you.

540
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:16,034
I need some advice.

541
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:17,500
Sure.

542
00:40:19,673 --> 00:40:23,231
Well, Oscar and I have been given
a business opportunity.

543
00:40:23,606 --> 00:40:25,434
Really?

544
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:30,960
And if we were to make this... tape,

545
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:36,163
it's not like it's something
we don't do all the time anyway.

546
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:42,199
We could make, like, a thousand bucks,
if, you know, people order it.

547
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:45,755
Oh, they'll order it.
Blind people will order it.

548
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:49,891
Should we do it?

549
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:53,929
You haven't told me
what you think about it.

550
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:57,423
<i>I think if we were doing it</i>
<i>just for the money</i>

551
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,688
<i>it would definitely be wrong.</i>

552
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,858
What is it?

553
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,353
What's wrong?

554
00:41:13,824 --> 00:41:16,518
A young girl asked me for advice today.

555
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:20,083
She was trying to decide
if she and her boyfriend

556
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:23,916
should make a pornographic movie.

557
00:41:26,054 --> 00:41:27,849
I hope you told her no.

558
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,184
I didn't.

559
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:34,942
No, I tried to give her a perspective.

560
00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:40,072
I asked her questions. All very Socratic.

561
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:46,909
I let her make up her own mind.
The same way I spoke to Aaron.

562
00:41:48,581 --> 00:41:51,045
- Sweetheart...
- What if I hadn't?

563
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,443
What if I'd taken a stronger stance?

564
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:03,474
What if I'd just told him,
"Son, this is right. This is wrong"?

565
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:05,599
I mean, he wasn't my student,
for God's sake.

566
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:07,197
He was my son.

567
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:18,467
Look at me.

568
00:42:20,072 --> 00:42:21,594
Harry, please.

569
00:42:23,536 --> 00:42:27,298
You were a wonderful father. Nothing...

570
00:42:28,802 --> 00:42:31,768
Nothing that you could have done
would have stopped him.

571
00:42:31,835 --> 00:42:33,663
You don't know that.

572
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:37,092
We don't know
what might have happened.

573
00:42:39,298 --> 00:42:40,525
Do we?

574
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:46,594
Oh, Harry.

575
00:42:57,693 --> 00:42:59,681
You like it?
Yeah!

576
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:03,255
It's pretty much
exactly what you asked for, Bradley.

577
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:06,188
One bedroom plus a studio.

578
00:43:06,923 --> 00:43:09,615
But the important thing to remember
about this place is...

579
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,213
The important thing
is whether or not you had fun last night.

580
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:16,516
- Yes, I had a good time.
- What's that, Diana?

581
00:43:16,588 --> 00:43:21,315
- We always have a good time together.
- How come you never got married?

582
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:24,844
Can we just stay on track here, Bradley,
for a minute?

583
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:27,009
The owner will take a second mortgage,

584
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:28,447
which means
that you can get out of renting...

585
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:31,778
Is it because you never met anybody
as lovable as me?

586
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:36,708
Are you ever going to buy a house,
or are you just jerking my chain?

587
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,869
It's perfect.

588
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:47,576
Really.

589
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:51,565
I'll take it.

590
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:55,168
Are you serious?

591
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:58,233
Oh, my God,
I'm actually going to buy a house!

592
00:44:00,342 --> 00:44:04,034
I love this place, really.
It's perfect for you. It is.

593
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,737
<i>Words fall through me</i>

594
00:44:05,806 --> 00:44:08,929
<i>And always fool me</i>

595
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:12,992
<i>And I can't react</i>

596
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:16,431
Have I told you how grateful I am
you came into my life?

597
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,963
Come on. You would have
found a place sooner or later.

598
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:21,967
That's not what I mean.

599
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:27,530
<i>Will play themselves out</i>

600
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:40,284
<i>Take this sinking boat</i>
<i>and point it home</i>

601
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,755
<i>We've still got time</i>

602
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:53,547
<i>Raise your hopeful voice</i>
<i>you have a choice</i>

603
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,514
<i>You've made it now</i>

604
00:44:58,423 --> 00:44:59,911
<i>That's all, folks.</i>

605
00:45:03,356 --> 00:45:04,945
That was amazing.

606
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:10,518
You're disgusting.
That's a disgusting habit.

607
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:24,081
Hey, how's your boyfriend?

608
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:30,141
He's fine. Thank you for asking.

609
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,706
Okay, I gotta know something.

610
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:40,766
Mmm-hmm?

611
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:43,806
What do you see in this guy?

612
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:50,932
Well, he's not stupid, or inconsiderate.

613
00:45:52,275 --> 00:45:57,570
He's not obnoxious, or violent,

614
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:00,900
or boring, or annoying.

615
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:03,960
He's not a bad dresser,
he's not unemployed,

616
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:07,365
and he is not unhandsome, either.

617
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:13,490
An absence of disqualifiers
is a rare and beautiful thing.

618
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:18,563
Oh, and did I mention?
He's not married, either.

619
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:28,719
Well, that makes me happy,

620
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,956
seeing you back at work.

621
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:37,521
Oh, I thought you were
working on your book.

622
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:38,684
No, it's just a letter.

623
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:44,619
- You're extending your leave of absence?
- Indefinitely.

624
00:46:45,692 --> 00:46:48,782
- But I thought...
- I changed my mind.

625
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:52,481
Honestly, I just don't feel like
I can be of much help to them now.

626
00:46:52,556 --> 00:46:55,385
Don't be ridiculous. They're just kids.

627
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:58,985
All the more reason
to stay out of their way.

628
00:47:31,012 --> 00:47:32,771
Need help with that?

629
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,474
No, thanks.

630
00:47:37,643 --> 00:47:39,664
How'd you pay for those?

631
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,666
You been selling my shit?

632
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,036
I'm not a thief.

633
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:53,934
- Where's my pillow, then? Huh, bitch?
- What pillow?

634
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,561
My wife give it to me in Atlantic City.

635
00:47:56,637 --> 00:47:59,534
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

636
00:47:59,603 --> 00:48:01,262
I see right through you, whore.

637
00:48:01,335 --> 00:48:04,324
I swear I never took anything
from your house,

638
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:07,398
except Oscar and he's not yours.

639
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,655
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

640
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:13,563
Pretty little face.

641
00:48:14,998 --> 00:48:17,260
Sure be a shame to open her up.

642
00:48:18,364 --> 00:48:20,262
Go ahead.

643
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:23,228
You'll go to jail
for the rest of your fucking life.

644
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,449
See you later.

645
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:38,822
You have enough stuff?

646
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:43,380
- That's actually nice.
Bradley?

647
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:44,682
- You think?
- Where'd you get that?

648
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,016
Hello?

649
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:48,451
- Anybody home?
Harry!

650
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:51,981
What are you doing here?

651
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,213
Well, I arrived about 28 years ago
and never left.

652
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,244
I live next door.

653
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,913
- Here?
- Yeah.

654
00:48:59,985 --> 00:49:02,710
That's fantastic! We're... I...

655
00:49:02,784 --> 00:49:04,510
- How did we never put that together?
- I don't know.

656
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:07,014
Stranger things have happened. A re-gift.

657
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:10,139
I'll use it to christen the fridge.

658
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:11,704
It also makes a good doorstop.

659
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,246
Hey, honey!
I want you to meet somebody.

660
00:49:14,313 --> 00:49:17,905
I can't believe it! You know,
I love this street. I love this area.

661
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,172
Bradley, there's something
I need to share with you.

662
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:25,036
This house has a history.

663
00:49:29,443 --> 00:49:32,373
Over the years, we've watched
happy young couples move in here

664
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:35,134
and before you know it,
they're at each other's throats,

665
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:38,434
and within weeks or months,
they're moving out.

666
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:40,028
Separately.

667
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:43,072
Now, this has happened
three times in a row.

668
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:46,528
Now, I'm a man of logic.
I think it's just coincidence.

669
00:49:46,603 --> 00:49:48,864
But, Esther, my wife,

670
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:53,126
she thinks supernatural forces
are at work.

671
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:56,134
She thinks the place is cursed.

672
00:49:56,668 --> 00:49:58,032
Hi.

673
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,630
Hi.

674
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:02,632
Diana, this is Professor Harry Stevenson.

675
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:04,197
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Harry, this is Diana.

676
00:50:04,264 --> 00:50:05,356
Nice to meet you.

677
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:08,918
My, my.
You're even more beautiful out of the rain.

678
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,722
Now, how is it possible
that you were unattached?

679
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:18,454
Well, I have impossibly high standards.

680
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:21,760
So, you think this place is haunted?

681
00:50:22,226 --> 00:50:25,123
Well, my wife does.

682
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,947
Well, that's okay.
We're not afraid of ghosts.

683
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:43,610
Hey, what happened?

684
00:50:43,686 --> 00:50:45,777
Did you see the video guy?
Did you talk to him?

685
00:50:45,853 --> 00:50:47,751
- What'd he say?
- Yeah, easy, sleazy.

686
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,047
- What'd he say?
- Here, here.

687
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,311
That's it?

688
00:50:56,983 --> 00:50:59,811
- Two hundred and forty bucks?
- Well, nobody's ordering it.

689
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:03,835
- What do you mean nobody's ordering it?
- It's not hot enough.

690
00:51:03,914 --> 00:51:05,880
- What?
- That's what he said.

691
00:51:05,947 --> 00:51:08,173
- It's totally hot. You said so yourself.
- Yeah, I know.

692
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:11,233
But, I mean, I'm just a little old girl.

693
00:51:12,545 --> 00:51:17,034
You guys are too in love, he says.
You laugh and shit.

694
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,132
I guess when it comes to porn,
that's a drag.

695
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,938
This isn't enough for a place with a foyer.

696
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,101
Hey.

697
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:29,898
Hey, we all got dreams.

698
00:51:29,972 --> 00:51:32,766
I mean,
I want to buy new tits and a hybrid.

699
00:51:32,838 --> 00:51:34,099
Oh...

700
00:51:34,472 --> 00:51:36,664
Tell your friend he's an asshole.

701
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:12,451
Yes?

702
00:52:12,527 --> 00:52:16,481
Hi. I left my bike out on the street.
Is it gonna be safe?

703
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,717
Laurel and Hardy says it is.

704
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:21,815
Tarot reading is $12, palm reading, $12.

705
00:52:21,923 --> 00:52:25,184
Guaranteed prediction of the future $20.

706
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:29,913
Well, can't get the future for free.

707
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:36,710
Okay, honey,
what you want to know about?

708
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,650
I have this boyfriend, Oscar.

709
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:42,309
Handsome boy, almost pretty.
That the one?

710
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:47,074
Okay, we'll start with a palm reading.
You sit there.

711
00:52:55,514 --> 00:52:57,742
When did this Oscar pass over?

712
00:52:59,547 --> 00:53:01,670
Pass over? You mean die?

713
00:53:03,512 --> 00:53:07,170
No, Oscar didn't die. He's fine.
He's just fine.

714
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,768
Well, we can always ask the cards.

715
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,525
I've seen better cards, I'll say that.

716
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:43,929
Honey...

717
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:48,525
It's important to take the future
with a grain of salt.

718
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,121
I want the truth, Mrs. Maggarolian.

719
00:53:52,197 --> 00:53:53,889
Both Laurel and Hardy are telling me

720
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:58,394
that his future prospects are not so hot.

721
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:07,818
I didn't see that much of your future,
so I'm gonna give you a little refund.

722
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:09,822
Stop on your way home and get Oscar

723
00:54:09,891 --> 00:54:12,981
a couple of cheeseburgers
and some French fries.

724
00:54:13,057 --> 00:54:14,420
He'll love that.

725
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,077
If you really love him...

726
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:24,614
People can keep other people alive.

727
00:54:26,286 --> 00:54:27,911
Trust me on that.

728
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:31,778
Oscar?

729
00:54:34,052 --> 00:54:35,175
Oscar.

730
00:54:37,384 --> 00:54:40,144
- Oscar, wake up.
- What? I'm up.

731
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:42,213
Hi.

732
00:54:42,548 --> 00:54:44,240
- Hey.
- Hi.

733
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,936
- What's that?
- I brought you cheeseburgers.

734
00:54:47,014 --> 00:54:50,242
Oh, nice.
I was just dreaming about cheeseburgers.

735
00:54:53,978 --> 00:54:55,068
Hey.

736
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,507
Marry me.

737
00:55:01,376 --> 00:55:04,137
- What?
- Let's get married. You and me.

738
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:07,235
Really?

739
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,532
Yeah. Yes. Of course I'll marry you.

740
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:33,659
She's sorry she couldn't be here.
She's writing up an offer.

741
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:36,164
She's dying to meet you, by the way.

742
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,494
From what I've seen out the window,
she's quite a looker.

743
00:55:38,565 --> 00:55:42,963
Oh, is she ever!
I mean, what the heck she sees in me I...

744
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:45,858
I don't know.

745
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:49,827
- Must be your inner beauty.
- Or all that free coffee.

746
00:55:49,894 --> 00:55:52,826
Honestly, I feel like
I'm the luckiest man alive. I...

747
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:55,949
She is this force of nature.
I mean, she is so smart

748
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:58,923
and so sexy.

749
00:55:58,992 --> 00:56:01,253
Totally unpredictable.

750
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:07,313
It's like living with a wild animal, or...

751
00:56:07,389 --> 00:56:08,686
Never mind.

752
00:56:25,918 --> 00:56:27,507
David?

753
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:28,605
Mmm?

754
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:35,677
Bradley asked me to marry him.

755
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,369
Bradley, the coffee guy?

756
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:46,434
Mmm-hmm.

757
00:56:55,076 --> 00:56:56,063
Uh...

758
00:56:57,375 --> 00:57:00,431
What did you say?
How did you get out of that one?

759
00:57:00,807 --> 00:57:04,204
I didn't, actually. I said yes.

760
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:12,427
What do you mean, you said yes? You...

761
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:17,092
You're going to marry him?
You're going to marry him.

762
00:57:22,967 --> 00:57:24,228
You're going to tear this guy apart.

763
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,356
- You know that.
- Oh, come on.

764
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:27,661
That's what you do to the
nice ones, Diana. Come on, I know you.

765
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:30,255
- Oh, Jesus, David. I'm not that bad.
- I know every square inch of you.

766
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:34,525
Yes, you are that bad.
You and me, we're the same like that.

767
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:38,585
- We're mean and ill-tempered.
- Really? Well, not around Bradley, I'm not.

768
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,253
When I'm with him, I'm nice.
I'm actually a nice person, David...

769
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:43,657
- Really?
...some of the time.

770
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:46,318
Okay. Well, if you're so fucking nice,
what are you doing here with me?

771
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:48,791
I don't know. We're having sex, I guess.
That's what we do, you and me.

772
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:53,880
We have sex and we drink wine.
We drink wine and we have sex.

773
00:57:58,657 --> 00:57:59,643
Yeah.

774
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:01,079
Mmm-hmm.

775
00:58:01,155 --> 00:58:03,951
Okay. All right,
so if you are going to marry this guy...

776
00:58:04,021 --> 00:58:05,043
I am gonna marry him.

777
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:06,280
If you're going to marry
this Bradley person

778
00:58:06,355 --> 00:58:08,978
shouldn't you at least
try to be with him exclusively?

779
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:11,144
You're the one
with the wedding ring, not me.

780
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:13,242
- Yeah, it's not the same thing.
- Yes, it is.

781
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,342
No, it's not the same thing!

782
00:58:14,418 --> 00:58:16,407
You're going to enter into a marriage,
a first-timer.

783
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:18,382
You haven't even tried to be faithful
to this guy?

784
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:20,916
I was faithful to Karen
for 11 fucking years!

785
00:58:20,983 --> 00:58:22,278
I gave that marriage everything that I had.

786
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:23,815
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- What have you given this guy, huh?

787
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:25,347
What have you given him?
Do you even love him?

788
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:28,539
- David, I'm done with this!
- Do you love him?

789
00:58:28,614 --> 00:58:31,012
I find him exceedingly lovable.

790
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:34,001
Yeah, that's not what I asked.

791
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,601
- Do you love him?
- I don't know, David. I suppose...

792
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,371
Wake the fuck up!

793
00:58:40,077 --> 00:58:42,202
What is wrong with you?

794
00:58:42,277 --> 00:58:46,469
Get out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house!

795
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:48,405
No.

796
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:51,304
You're gonna marry a guy that you're
not even sure you're in love with.

797
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:53,838
You deserve to be slapped. You're a cunt.

798
00:58:59,938 --> 00:59:02,835
I'm gonna walk outside right now,

799
00:59:02,903 --> 00:59:05,733
because I think that would be best
for both of us.

800
00:59:07,304 --> 00:59:10,393
- You're not dressed.
- I don't give a flying fuck!

801
00:59:39,427 --> 00:59:40,949
David.

802
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:42,623
Don't say anything.

803
00:59:42,692 --> 00:59:49,146
Can we... Can we just stop for a minute
and, please, can we just talk about this?

804
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:53,246
I think it would be better
if we just don't see each other again.

805
00:59:54,322 --> 01:00:00,311
- David, please don't say that.
- This is a mistake you're making, Diana.

806
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,512
This is a soul mistake.

807
01:00:20,514 --> 01:00:23,740
<i>And do you, Diana,</i>
<i>take this man to have and to hold,</i>

808
01:00:23,813 --> 01:00:28,835
for better or for worse, for richer,
for poorer, in sickness and in health,

809
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:33,900
to love and to cherish from this day
forward till death do you part?

810
01:00:40,742 --> 01:00:41,967
I do.

811
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:45,605
You may now exchange the rings.

812
01:00:51,938 --> 01:00:54,130
You first. Then me.

813
01:00:54,204 --> 01:00:55,396
There you go.

814
01:00:55,471 --> 01:00:58,436
By the powers vested in me
by the laws of the state of Oregon,

815
01:00:58,503 --> 01:01:02,161
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

816
01:01:31,094 --> 01:01:32,559
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could do that

817
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:34,717
with everything we found uncomfortable?

818
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,018
Kick it off into a flower bed?

819
01:01:38,057 --> 01:01:40,614
Hey, you in the suit.

820
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,177
It's a wedding, not a funeral.
What's the matter?

821
01:01:43,257 --> 01:01:45,777
I'm just not feeling very festive.

822
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:48,485
- You know what might help?
- What?

823
01:01:48,554 --> 01:01:50,282
If you faked it.

824
01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:53,813
Come on, let's show them how it's done.
Come on.

825
01:02:00,085 --> 01:02:01,516
Esther's amazing.

826
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,547
I'll have to agree with you.

827
01:02:06,615 --> 01:02:08,411
Can I trust her with Oscar?

828
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:10,005
Mmm...

829
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:11,740
Hard to say.

830
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:15,246
I mean, she's a passionate woman
with needs, you know?

831
01:02:16,213 --> 01:02:18,838
Hey, how come you two never had kids?

832
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:23,842
- I'm sorry, I just...
- We did.

833
01:02:24,978 --> 01:02:26,273
A son.

834
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:29,632
Aaron died last year

835
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:34,030
of a heroin overdose.

836
01:02:36,474 --> 01:02:38,063
Here. Come, sit.

837
01:02:42,371 --> 01:02:45,030
His death was hard enough to accept.

838
01:02:46,603 --> 01:02:49,297
Almost as hard was the fact that

839
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:55,224
we had no idea he had a drug problem.

840
01:02:57,367 --> 01:03:01,990
I mean, he was a top student.
He was a doctor.

841
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:08,085
When the police called,
we were sure that this was a mistake.

842
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:10,152
He had, like, a secret life.

843
01:03:12,195 --> 01:03:14,094
And I don't know why.

844
01:03:15,596 --> 01:03:17,992
Every day I try to figure it out.

845
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,088
The first sign.

846
01:03:22,226 --> 01:03:24,248
The moment I didn't see.

847
01:03:31,023 --> 01:03:34,079
A bit of unsolicited advice for you,

848
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:37,088
as soon as you get married, have a baby.

849
01:03:37,155 --> 01:03:39,711
And as soon as you've done that,
have another one.

850
01:03:39,788 --> 01:03:44,481
- Have at least two. Okay? Two.
- Okay, two.

851
01:03:44,552 --> 01:03:45,983
Atta girl.

852
01:03:57,182 --> 01:03:59,909
Hey, I'm gonna ask you a question, okay?

853
01:03:59,981 --> 01:04:01,572
All right.

854
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:06,344
Oscar and me really need parents.

855
01:04:07,478 --> 01:04:10,409
Mine are dead,
and Oscar's only got the Bat.

856
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:15,603
Would you and Esther adopt us?

857
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:19,307
You know, unofficially.

858
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:30,001
That's cool. You need time.
Just think about it.

859
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:57,824
Ta-da.

860
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,456
Voilŕ.

861
01:05:03,197 --> 01:05:04,456
Thanks.

862
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:10,588
- Hey, you hesitated today. How come?
- When?

863
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:14,853
Just towards the end of the ceremony,
right before the "I do."

864
01:05:16,724 --> 01:05:17,952
I did?

865
01:05:20,391 --> 01:05:21,856
Can't remember.

866
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:28,318
- What a day, huh?
- Yeah.

867
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,648
Cheers.

868
01:05:44,317 --> 01:05:46,306
I love you, Mrs. Smith.

869
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:02,467
You know, sometimes I think
love is just a trick nature plays on us,

870
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:07,536
just a way of bringing
more screaming babies into the world.

871
01:06:09,376 --> 01:06:12,364
You actually believe that?

872
01:06:14,307 --> 01:06:15,603
Sometimes.

873
01:06:16,275 --> 01:06:20,672
God, I think it's everything.

874
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:28,362
The only meaning there is
to this crazy dream we're all trapped in.

875
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:34,032
Well...

876
01:06:35,668 --> 01:06:37,065
I hope not.

877
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,797
Good night, sweetheart.

878
01:07:13,824 --> 01:07:16,255
It's been Ionely for you, I know.

879
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:19,777
And I'm sorry.

880
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:26,050
There's just the two of us now.

881
01:07:27,987 --> 01:07:30,644
One day, there'll only be one of us.

882
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:34,809
It's an unbearable prospect.

883
01:07:39,449 --> 01:07:44,074
That's why we have to love each other
as hard as we can now,

884
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:46,512
while we still have the chance.

885
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:03,001
I love you.

886
01:08:27,601 --> 01:08:30,725
Six weeks
and I still can't find half my stuff.

887
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,532
You didn't leave one of my boxes
on the truck, did you?

888
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,326
No, I don't think so.

889
01:08:37,398 --> 01:08:40,091
Well, it must be this evil house
hiding my clothes,

890
01:08:40,164 --> 01:08:41,858
trying to turn me against you.

891
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,520
Well, don't let it.

892
01:08:44,096 --> 01:08:45,460
Here it is.

893
01:08:47,195 --> 01:08:50,752
That looks a little big. Let me guess.
An ex-boyfriend's.

894
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,756
Sweetheart, there was no one before you.

895
01:08:56,826 --> 01:08:59,018
You were my first.

896
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:02,421
On our wedding night,
you remember how scared I was?

897
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:08,921
Hey, are we supposed to bring something
to this party?

898
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:17,849
You are so... You're so
fashion-phobic. It's great. I love it.

899
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,907
With the tie on?

900
01:09:18,985 --> 01:09:21,850
You're the best-Iooking guy here.
It looks great. Enjoy it.

901
01:09:21,918 --> 01:09:23,712
- Thank you, dear.
- It's okay.

902
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,976
Well, listen, regarding this house,

903
01:09:26,051 --> 01:09:28,778
I mean,
Chloe and Oscar need a place to live.

904
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:31,838
And if you find some great place,
I'll help them out.

905
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:33,938
We don't even have to let them know,
you know?

906
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:35,412
I'm on it.

907
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:36,505
- I think I found something.
David!

908
01:09:36,581 --> 01:09:39,739
I found a house with a great neighborhood.

909
01:09:40,613 --> 01:09:41,805
Michael, nice to see you.

910
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,002
How are you?
- Good, good, good.

911
01:09:45,078 --> 01:09:48,440
That sounds good. You all right?

912
01:09:48,511 --> 01:09:50,908
I'm gonna go get a drink.
Do you want anything?

913
01:09:50,976 --> 01:09:52,465
Just a beer, please.

914
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:54,064
- Hey, Scott, how you doing?
- Hey.

915
01:09:54,143 --> 01:09:56,404
- White wine.
- Thank you so much.

916
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,600
Diana Croce?

917
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,632
- I'm sorry?
- Karen Watson.

918
01:10:01,707 --> 01:10:05,103
My husband, Dave, and I bought a house
from you a few years ago.

919
01:10:05,706 --> 01:10:09,398
Oh, right. The two-story Georgian.

920
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:12,130
- Exactly.
- On Walnut Street.

921
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:16,498
- So you're still happy with the house?
- Oh, well, we love it. At least I do.

922
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:20,659
David's just so busy.

923
01:10:20,734 --> 01:10:22,529
He's not around much.

924
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,690
I'm... I'm sorry. Could you excuse me?

925
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:33,856
I left the house, I asked my wife,
"Do you have the directions?"

926
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:34,988
She said, "I don't have the directions."

927
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:36,359
I'm like, "Well, I don't have the directions."

928
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,917
So we get in the car and start driving
and I use my little thing,

929
01:10:38,994 --> 01:10:40,893
and I press the button
and put the address in

930
01:10:40,962 --> 01:10:42,789
and I start going.
It says, "Make a right. Make a right."

931
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:51,917
Diana.

932
01:10:53,057 --> 01:10:54,648
Hello, David.

933
01:10:58,155 --> 01:11:01,519
That's... That's my shirt you're wearing.

934
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:04,417
Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.

935
01:11:05,921 --> 01:11:07,716
Do you want it back?

936
01:11:11,153 --> 01:11:13,083
No, it's a little late for that.

937
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:14,640
You know that was
a birthday present from Karen.

938
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,546
No, I didn't know that.

939
01:11:16,617 --> 01:11:18,640
And besides,
there are hundreds of shirts like this

940
01:11:18,717 --> 01:11:20,274
walking around Portland, David.

941
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,337
But that one's got a button missing
from the left collar.

942
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:27,869
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry
about this hideous mess that I've created.

943
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:32,435
And don't worry. It's gonna be okay. Just...

944
01:11:34,445 --> 01:11:37,899
Tell her that what happened between us
was a mistake

945
01:11:37,978 --> 01:11:40,841
and this whole thing is over.

946
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:43,671
She loves you. She'll forgive you.

947
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:49,229
It's not over.

948
01:11:51,673 --> 01:11:52,865
David?

949
01:11:54,672 --> 01:11:56,297
We need to leave.

950
01:12:22,265 --> 01:12:23,627
- Oh, right, we're moving.
- Inside.

951
01:12:23,698 --> 01:12:25,855
- Yes, we're moving.
- This is the last of it?

952
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:26,917
I think so.

953
01:12:26,997 --> 01:12:28,326
- I'm hungry.
- You're hungry?

954
01:12:28,395 --> 01:12:29,690
- What're you gonna make?
- Should I cook something?

955
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:30,988
Your famous toast?

956
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,317
- Hello, buddy.
- Nice place you got here.

957
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,685
Yeah, you call this home?

958
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,610
Sorry, buddy.

959
01:13:12,015 --> 01:13:15,606
All right, pull up, Eric, and Lee,
square up by the tree.

960
01:13:16,914 --> 01:13:18,175
Hit me.

961
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,573
Good one, man.

962
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,402
- I'm out for a second.
- All right, let's keep it going.

963
01:13:27,478 --> 01:13:28,671
Good job on that.

964
01:13:28,744 --> 01:13:30,505
Thought you hated sports.

965
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:32,634
Is it true, what I heard?

966
01:13:36,275 --> 01:13:37,467
Yeah.

967
01:13:40,573 --> 01:13:42,436
You moved out?

968
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:45,800
Yeah.

969
01:13:47,706 --> 01:13:50,331
The day after the barbecue, actually.

970
01:13:52,703 --> 01:13:54,636
Why didn't you call me?

971
01:13:56,703 --> 01:13:58,692
Because you're married.

972
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:20,693
See my little jig there?
Got my water bottle. What's wrong?

973
01:14:24,061 --> 01:14:25,720
- Shit.
- Yeah.

974
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:44,252
The dolly's
in the truck, right, Dave?

975
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:49,347
Sir?

976
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:50,886
That'll do it.

977
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,673
<i>It seems like</i>
<i>I'm just this transition</i>

978
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:09,078
for women
on their way to something better.

979
01:15:10,581 --> 01:15:13,011
At least it was a man this time.

980
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:20,369
- I thought that might be a consolation.
- It's not.

981
01:15:20,444 --> 01:15:22,773
- Sorry.
- It's worse.

982
01:15:24,976 --> 01:15:28,498
How do I make a change?
I can't go through this again.

983
01:15:28,576 --> 01:15:31,904
Harry, I swear to God, I'll lose my mind.

984
01:15:31,974 --> 01:15:35,871
Oh, shit. Bradley, listen.

985
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:37,929
You just gotta stay alert.

986
01:15:38,904 --> 01:15:40,234
What does that mean?

987
01:15:40,305 --> 01:15:44,395
Well, everything we need to know
is going on right in front of our eyes.

988
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:48,595
Yeah, we have our illusions about people,
our hopes,

989
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,862
and they can blind us.

990
01:15:50,935 --> 01:15:54,798
But the end is always right there
in the beginning.

991
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:02,497
Kathryn said I never saw her.

992
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:06,694
Maybe I never saw Diana either.

993
01:16:06,764 --> 01:16:11,421
I was just looking
for some piece of happiness,

994
01:16:11,496 --> 01:16:15,051
so I closed my eyes and jumped.

995
01:16:15,127 --> 01:16:17,559
- Okay, so next time...
- Don't jump, I know.

996
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:22,252
No, no, no, no, no. Jump!
Jump, but with your eyes open.

997
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:27,654
Come on, Bradley.

998
01:16:27,725 --> 01:16:29,689
Go for a walk?

999
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:31,449
This way. Come on.

1000
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:33,914
What?

1001
01:16:36,921 --> 01:16:41,909
<i>Was it just to</i>
<i>keep me guessing</i>

1002
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:48,181
<i>For a means to the end?</i>

1003
01:16:53,384 --> 01:16:55,212
<i>Ghost</i>

1004
01:18:01,729 --> 01:18:04,922
Harry! Harry! Please!

1005
01:18:09,926 --> 01:18:11,756
I may need a little help.

1006
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,912
Miss? Miss? I have an injured man
who could use a little help here.

1007
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,514
- What happened?
- He had an accident.

1008
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:20,750
- No, I did not.
- He sliced off the tip of his finger.

1009
01:18:20,823 --> 01:18:22,083
- But it wasn't an accident.
- Bradley.

1010
01:18:22,157 --> 01:18:23,350
- Bradley!
- I did this to myself on purpose.

1011
01:18:23,423 --> 01:18:24,787
Bradley, shut up!

1012
01:18:32,386 --> 01:18:33,613
Hold still.

1013
01:18:36,019 --> 01:18:38,949
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

1014
01:18:39,751 --> 01:18:41,409
Can I ask you one?

1015
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:45,480
- Two, actually.
- That's only fair.

1016
01:18:46,882 --> 01:18:47,871
Uh...

1017
01:18:48,282 --> 01:18:49,770
You go first.

1018
01:18:50,914 --> 01:18:53,005
Why did you do this to yourself?

1019
01:18:57,113 --> 01:18:59,043
I wanted to feel,

1020
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:05,234
in my body,
as much pain as I feel in my heart.

1021
01:19:15,408 --> 01:19:17,532
You have questions for me?

1022
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,436
What's your name?

1023
01:19:21,573 --> 01:19:23,128
Margit.

1024
01:19:23,204 --> 01:19:27,296
Margit? Where are you from?

1025
01:19:27,369 --> 01:19:30,199
I'm Hungarian, from Budapest.

1026
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:35,260
Ah.

1027
01:19:37,801 --> 01:19:40,560
What caused you this pain in your heart?

1028
01:19:43,099 --> 01:19:44,359
My eyes.

1029
01:19:47,864 --> 01:19:50,421
I had them closed for so long.

1030
01:19:51,529 --> 01:19:53,994
Then when I finally opened them,

1031
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:58,292
I wasn't ready for what they saw.

1032
01:20:01,726 --> 01:20:02,953
Hey.

1033
01:20:05,225 --> 01:20:10,520
Do you think love is a trick
nature plays on people

1034
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:13,454
so that we'll make more babies?

1035
01:20:15,355 --> 01:20:17,947
Or do you think that it's everything,

1036
01:20:19,389 --> 01:20:23,842
the only meaning there is to this

1037
01:20:25,386 --> 01:20:26,851
crazy dream?

1038
01:20:30,984 --> 01:20:32,881
The second one.

1039
01:20:34,018 --> 01:20:35,983
Which do you believe?

1040
01:20:37,515 --> 01:20:39,481
Unfortunately,

1041
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:42,904
the second one.

1042
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:50,601
Do you want to have dinner
with me sometime?

1043
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:56,032
Oh.

1044
01:20:56,976 --> 01:20:58,373
How is he?

1045
01:21:01,408 --> 01:21:02,998
Do you want the good news or the bad?

1046
01:21:03,074 --> 01:21:05,369
I don't think I can take
any more bad news.

1047
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,405
Well, the good news is
his finger's gonna be all right.

1048
01:21:08,474 --> 01:21:10,462
And the bad news?

1049
01:21:11,706 --> 01:21:14,034
Bradley's in love again.

1050
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,291
All right, guys.

1051
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:32,755
Come on, look at the camera.
Hi, wave.

1052
01:21:32,832 --> 01:21:34,094
Hi, Janey.

1053
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:38,197
<i>Getting out of bed</i>

1054
01:21:40,631 --> 01:21:43,095
Harry, I took your advice.

1055
01:21:43,162 --> 01:21:44,685
What advice?

1056
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:47,220
I'm pregnant.

1057
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:52,016
Congratulations.

1058
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:53,185
- And you know what?
- What?

1059
01:21:53,261 --> 01:21:56,918
We're gonna have another one.
Right away. Gonna have two.

1060
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:58,618
That's my girl.

1061
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:02,552
<i>'Cause your love is mine</i>

1062
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:04,480
Say hi to the bride and groom.

1063
01:22:04,556 --> 01:22:05,545
Hi!

1064
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:09,255
<i>Your love is all mine</i>

1065
01:22:10,822 --> 01:22:13,344
What's making you smile like that?

1066
01:22:13,487 --> 01:22:16,680
<i>Looking out the window</i>

1067
01:22:17,453 --> 01:22:19,213
An unusual man.

1068
01:22:21,417 --> 01:22:23,212
An innocent man.

1069
01:22:24,951 --> 01:22:27,074
An open-hearted man.

1070
01:22:29,516 --> 01:22:32,481
Someone who has given tremendous love

1071
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:34,479
but never had it returned.

1072
01:22:37,213 --> 01:22:39,337
Not in the way he deserves.

1073
01:22:39,447 --> 01:22:41,934
<i>Your love is mine</i>

1074
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:46,942
Hey, Chloe!

1075
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:50,804
This is you and me.

1076
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:54,869
<i>I've got this feeling</i>

1077
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:59,231
<i>That we'll always</i>
<i>be all right</i>

1078
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:01,505
<i>Yeah</i>

1079
01:23:01,972 --> 01:23:05,199
<i>You know</i>
<i>when two people belong together.</i>

1080
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,238
<i>Oscar and Chloe knew it.</i>

1081
01:23:07,305 --> 01:23:09,327
<i>So did Bradley and Margit.</i>

1082
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:13,095
<i>Turns out that Bradley</i>
<i>finally found someone</i>

1083
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:16,225
<i>who loved him as much as he loved her.</i>

1084
01:23:17,235 --> 01:23:18,927
<i>They fit together.</i>

1085
01:23:20,001 --> 01:23:23,693
<i>It's a peculiar thing,</i>
<i>what happiness does for people.</i>

1086
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:26,855
<i>He actually became friends</i>
<i>with Kathryn and Jenny</i>

1087
01:23:26,931 --> 01:23:28,658
<i>and Diana and David.</i>

1088
01:23:30,231 --> 01:23:33,025
<i>Bradley realized that</i>

1089
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:35,618
<i>you can't hold someone's love</i>
<i>against them.</i>

1090
01:23:48,592 --> 01:23:50,286
And hut!

1091
01:23:53,123 --> 01:23:54,555
Yes!

1092
01:23:54,623 --> 01:23:56,055
Go right.

1093
01:23:56,957 --> 01:23:58,582
- Almost got it.
- Okay...

1094
01:23:58,655 --> 01:24:00,847
Don't let him
get around the outside, man.

1095
01:24:04,654 --> 01:24:07,846
I'll make a hand-off to Craig and
cross at the middle. Okay, Oscar, you...

1096
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,885
- Hey, Romeo. You with us?
- All right.

1097
01:24:10,953 --> 01:24:14,349
The defender should bite.
Head for the end zone. Game over, okay?

1098
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:16,247
- On "69."
- All right.

1099
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:22,141
Hut!

1100
01:24:28,546 --> 01:24:30,034
Get there.

1101
01:24:30,113 --> 01:24:32,010
Get it! Get it! Get it!

1102
01:24:38,444 --> 01:24:39,703
He got it!

1103
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,974
- And that's it.
Nice work, baby!

1104
01:24:48,608 --> 01:24:49,765
Oscar?

1105
01:24:50,407 --> 01:24:51,565
Oscar?

1106
01:24:52,407 --> 01:24:53,667
Oscar?

1107
01:24:56,238 --> 01:24:57,430
What happened?

1108
01:24:57,505 --> 01:24:59,493
Hey. Hey, Oscar.

1109
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:01,759
You all right?

1110
01:25:01,837 --> 01:25:03,631
He's not breathing. Somebody call 911!

1111
01:25:03,703 --> 01:25:06,395
He's gonna be fine. He's gonna be just fine.

1112
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:07,957
I'm a doctor.

1113
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:11,927
You're gonna be okay. We're all right here.

1114
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,465
It's okay.

1115
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,587
It's okay.

1116
01:25:15,966 --> 01:25:17,396
He's okay.

1117
01:25:21,832 --> 01:25:23,762
Okay, I've got a pulse.
Let's get him to St. Luke's.

1118
01:25:23,831 --> 01:25:27,228
- Get the car.
- You're gonna be just fine, okay?

1119
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:28,421
Okay?

1120
01:25:30,427 --> 01:25:31,689
Please?

1121
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,157
Careful!

1122
01:25:39,225 --> 01:25:42,747
This is Dr. Vekashi. I'm coming in
with a witnessed cardiac arrest.

1123
01:25:42,824 --> 01:25:44,154
It's going to be all right.

1124
01:25:44,225 --> 01:25:46,712
Come on, come on, come on!
Okay?

1125
01:25:48,323 --> 01:25:51,310
Okay.
- All right, go. Go, go, go, go.

1126
01:25:52,255 --> 01:25:53,913
Outta the way, outta the way.
Outta the way.

1127
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,614
The patient is barely breathing.

1128
01:26:04,685 --> 01:26:06,172
Weak pulse.
Breathe!

1129
01:26:06,251 --> 01:26:07,944
Have the cardiac team ready.

1130
01:26:08,516 --> 01:26:09,981
Shit! Get out of the fucking way!

1131
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:11,310
Go! Go!

1132
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:13,807
Goddamn it!

1133
01:26:18,979 --> 01:26:20,467
Goddamn it!

1134
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:24,708
He's not breathing! He's not breathing!

1135
01:26:26,811 --> 01:26:30,435
- Please make him breathe.
- Come on, Bradley. He won't last.

1136
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:31,908
Help! Please!

1137
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:35,969
No!

1138
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:51,314
Bradley?

1139
01:29:53,182 --> 01:29:54,648
Hey.

1140
01:29:57,849 --> 01:30:00,246
I had a feeling I might find you here.

1141
01:30:03,747 --> 01:30:05,802
I figured after today...

1142
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,708
It was awful, wasn't it?

1143
01:30:12,144 --> 01:30:13,472
It was too sad.

1144
01:30:16,143 --> 01:30:17,573
Unspeakable.

1145
01:30:20,975 --> 01:30:23,804
God is either dead or he despises us.

1146
01:30:27,073 --> 01:30:29,300
You don't really believe that.

1147
01:30:31,738 --> 01:30:32,965
Maybe.

1148
01:30:36,304 --> 01:30:39,097
I saw the most remarkable thing just now.

1149
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:42,960
I wandered into the stadium.

1150
01:30:45,368 --> 01:30:49,957
I thought I was alone,
but down on the 50-yard line

1151
01:30:50,033 --> 01:30:53,362
there was a young couple making love.

1152
01:30:55,796 --> 01:30:58,627
I watched for longer than I should have.

1153
01:31:02,095 --> 01:31:03,685
I was envious.

1154
01:31:06,993 --> 01:31:09,425
And then I felt sorry for them.

1155
01:31:12,225 --> 01:31:14,747
There's so much they don't know.

1156
01:31:18,091 --> 01:31:20,750
Heartbreak they can't even imagine.

1157
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:32,149
Well, even if they knew,
it wouldn't change anything.

1158
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,479
How so?

1159
01:31:36,386 --> 01:31:40,283
Well, Chloe knew
what was gonna happen to Oscar.

1160
01:31:40,351 --> 01:31:42,747
- What do you mean she knew?
- She did.

1161
01:31:42,817 --> 01:31:47,713
She went to some psychic lady
who predicted the whole thing.

1162
01:31:49,481 --> 01:31:51,106
She believed her?

1163
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:53,243
Yes, Harry.

1164
01:31:54,579 --> 01:31:55,805
She did.

1165
01:31:57,113 --> 01:31:58,771
And she didn't run away.

1166
01:31:59,712 --> 01:32:01,972
She didn't crawl into a hole.

1167
01:32:04,444 --> 01:32:06,306
She found them a house,

1168
01:32:07,676 --> 01:32:11,130
she threw away her birth control,
and she married him.

1169
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:18,332
God doesn't hate us, Harry.

1170
01:32:20,139 --> 01:32:23,534
If he did, he wouldn't have
made our hearts so brave.

1171
01:33:02,993 --> 01:33:04,720
Hello, Bat.

1172
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:07,020
Who the fuck are you?

1173
01:33:07,091 --> 01:33:09,023
Harry Stevenson.

1174
01:33:09,091 --> 01:33:11,648
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

1175
01:33:12,289 --> 01:33:13,585
What's that?

1176
01:33:15,722 --> 01:33:17,516
What do you think?

1177
01:33:19,521 --> 01:33:21,282
Well, what's it for?

1178
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:25,474
- For that whore that killed my boy.
- Now, wait a minute.

1179
01:33:25,552 --> 01:33:28,846
I was told that that was because of
a congenital heart defect.

1180
01:33:28,917 --> 01:33:32,042
I don't need to listen to that crap!
I got business here.

1181
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:35,743
So do I.

1182
01:33:39,048 --> 01:33:40,844
Now, listen to me.

1183
01:33:40,914 --> 01:33:44,005
You are not to bother that girl ever again.
You understand me?

1184
01:33:44,081 --> 01:33:46,273
You are not to blame her
for your miserable life.

1185
01:33:46,346 --> 01:33:51,676
You do, and I'll kill you myself. I swear it.
Now get the hell out of here. Go on!

1186
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:01,038
Harry?

1187
01:34:01,341 --> 01:34:04,864
- It was the Bat, wasn't it?
- It's all right. He's gone.

1188
01:34:09,105 --> 01:34:11,537
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1189
01:34:23,734 --> 01:34:25,064
Chloe...

1190
01:34:29,067 --> 01:34:33,463
You asked me
if Esther and I would be your parents.

1191
01:34:40,396 --> 01:34:43,055
I thought you were just being kind
to an old man

1192
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:46,855
after I told you about the death of my son,

1193
01:34:49,094 --> 01:34:50,922
so I didn't answer.

1194
01:34:52,893 --> 01:34:58,845
And I didn't know that you already knew
that terrible things were going to happen.

1195
01:35:06,023 --> 01:35:09,146
Esther and I want you to come
and live with us.

1196
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:12,347
Be our little girl.

1197
01:35:21,318 --> 01:35:22,748
Say yes.

1198
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:25,877
Please say yes.

1199
01:35:28,248 --> 01:35:29,305
Yes.

1200
01:35:30,782 --> 01:35:31,907
Yes.

1201
01:35:40,113 --> 01:35:41,270
Yes.

1202
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:47,569
Esther and I will give you and your baby
all the love we have left to give.

1203
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:52,632
Let's go home.

1204
01:35:59,706 --> 01:36:02,932
<i>The unexpected is always upon us.</i>

1205
01:36:04,372 --> 01:36:07,167
<i>And of all the gifts arrayed before me,</i>

1206
01:36:07,238 --> 01:36:11,895
<i>this one thought at this moment in my life</i>
