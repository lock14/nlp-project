1
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,864
Sheriff's office. How can I help?

2
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:32,699
Like I said, I hadn't heard
from this woman, all right?

3
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,671
Problems? What the hell you talking...

4
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:37,710
You guys come and fuckin'
raid my house at 2 in the morning.

5
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:39,538
You don't even give me
a chance to get my stuff.

6
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:41,703
Throw me out? Throw me out
of my own fuckin' house?

7
00:00:41,777 --> 00:00:43,644
It's not your house, Joleen.
It's your boyfriend's house.

8
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,147
That's the reason he's in jail
and you're not.

9
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:46,912
You didn't even
give me a chance to get my stuff.

10
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,383
You can come
and get your stuff later.

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,049
So we fine here? Can I go?

12
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:54,423
I don't know about being fine,
but I can't hold you, so...

13
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:57,019
Great. Where's my daughter?

14
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:58,585
Do you even have
anywhere to take her?

15
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:01,497
Yeah, I got a lot of places to go to.
I got a lot of options.

16
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:06,666
Did you ever think maybe Tara'd
be better off with a more stable relative?

17
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,330
- I know she has a father somewhere.
- No.

18
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:11,036
- Just until you get on your feet.
- Just my brother, okay?

19
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:13,442
- Your brother.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,503
What about your parents?

21
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:18,416
- No parents.
- No parents?

22
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:20,610
No. All deceased. Where's Tara?

23
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:22,950
Joleen, I know you have a father
because we talked...

24
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:25,657
That man's got nothing to do
with any of this, all right?

25
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:28,558
- Joleen, I'm just trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

26
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,926
Can't you get that?
I don't need your help.

27
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:32,464
- We're fine!
- You're not fine!

28
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,334
You think being dragged out
in the middle of the night is fine?

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,802
What about Tara?
Moving all over the place,

30
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,308
missing school, having people
talk about her mother is fine?

31
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:46,168
- Okay, I've had enough.
- Oh, here we go again.

32
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:47,940
Just drag her out
into the middle of this shit again.

33
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:50,916
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take my daughter to school.

34
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:54,045
You know what then? Then I'm gonna
find us a wonderful place to live, okay?

35
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,089
And I have a lot of options,
by the way, okay?

36
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:58,557
Thank you. Thanks for your help,
but I don't need it.

37
00:01:58,623 --> 00:01:59,989
Tara, let's go!

38
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:01,720
Come on. Let's go.

39
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:11,003
This is James.

40
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,936
James. Yeah.

41
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:14,633
Speedy. Right.

42
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:16,699
Is Mr. Carvel there?

43
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:20,973
Okay. Well, could you just tell him

44
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,950
I-I can't come into work today
on account of my back?

45
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:26,509
Still... I know.

46
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:28,680
Okay.

47
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,194
How ya doin', huh? Look at your hair.

48
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:45,466
It's so long. You need a haircut.

49
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,770
You look tired.

50
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:51,642
Well, it's been a shit
couple of days, all right?

51
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:55,513
Have you gone to jail, too?

52
00:02:57,217 --> 00:02:59,449
Jail? No, James.

53
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,046
- Why would I go to jail? God!
- I don't know.

54
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:04,957
- Why would I go to jail?
- I don't know.

55
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,255
This whole thing's got nothing
to do with me, all right?

56
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:10,992
Okay.

57
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:18,364
- At all.
- Okay.

58
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,998
Got nothing to do
with that shit, all right?

59
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:23,603
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Put your seatbelt on.

60
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:51,532
Tell 'em we got Joleen.
Joleen's coming back.

61
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,872
Let's go, James. Come on.

62
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,573
We currently have
a suspect in custody.

63
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:59,343
It's regarding the marijuana grow...

64
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,377
I brought my brother.

65
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,945
Hey, I'll try to watch my step.
Hey, whoa, whoa.

66
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,117
Come on. I just wanna get some
of my shit, if it's not too much to ask.

67
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,457
Are you gonna be calm?

68
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,497
<i>We got marijuana out back.</i>

69
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:16,054
I hope you guys are proud of yourselves.
A bunch of big men in here.

70
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,294
Just get your stuff, Joleen.

71
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,895
Everybody's fine putting
a little girl out on the street.

72
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,030
Where's my coffee can?

73
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:25,405
Where's my goddamn coffee can?

74
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,376
The last thing you need
is coffee, Joleen.

75
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:30,074
You know what I'm talking about.
Last night, when you guys came in here,

76
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,240
there was a goddamn coffee can
on top of that fridge!

77
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,648
It has my money in it.

78
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,988
- Bob, did you see this alleged coffee can?
- No.

79
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:43,494
Pretty sure a girl like you can figure out
another way to make some money.

80
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:46,030
Fuck you. Come on, James.

81
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,627
<i>The DEA's discovered</i>

82
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,830
<i>quite a few marijuana plants
out there as well.</i>

83
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:56,169
<i>And there's also marijuana paraphernalia.</i>

84
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:03,176
<i>DEA says
it goes all the way out there...</i>

85
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:10,690
<i>Marijuana cultivation
all the way down on the left side.</i>

86
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:13,725
<i>DEA's got another grow...</i>

87
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,194
<i>- James!
- about another half acre up there.</i>

88
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:23,492
Let's go. Thanks a lot.

89
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,008
Anybody looking?

90
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,567
Uh, no.

91
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:41,952
All right. Let's go.

92
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,518
What are you looking at?

93
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:08,576
Can I stay at your house?

94
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,378
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

95
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:15,252
Tara! Hey, put it in gear! Let's go!

96
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,187
I'll see you later. Bye.

97
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,746
Bye.

98
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:33,931
Today is the first day
of the rest of your whole goddamn life.

99
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:35,998
Moving again?

100
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,408
<i>Are you all right, miss?</i>

101
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:46,181
<i>I'm really frightened to death.</i>

102
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:49,656
<i>But otherwise all right.</i>

103
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:56,363
Uncle James,
you're creeping me out.

104
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,626
Hey, you be nice to Uncle James.

105
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:01,329
- James, where do you keep your hangers?
- What?

106
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,496
The hangers.
God, this place is some mess.

107
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,563
I should've brought
some of my furniture.

108
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,733
And we're gonna need another pillow
for Tara, by the way.

109
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:10,607
I'm not sleeping in the same bed
as you, Mom.

110
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:14,081
You know, you could really start
unpacking some of your own shit

111
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:15,946
instead of sitting there
and pretending to do your homework.

112
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:19,420
I'm not pretending to do my homework.
I'm pretending not to hate my life.

113
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,547
Well, you're not doing
a very good job of pretending.

114
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:23,683
Well, maybe I'm not applying myself.

115
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:26,354
I don't need this kind of shit
from you right now, Tara!

116
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,521
What kind of shit do you need
from me right now, Mom?

117
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:30,588
God, what do you want from me?

118
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:32,600
God, Tara!

119
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:36,467
Fuck it!

120
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,371
<i>Take it easy, baby face.</i>

121
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:09,736
There are hangers in there.
I'm not gonna use them.

122
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:12,104
How old do I look to you, James?

123
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,746
I don't know.

124
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,685
That is not the right answer.

125
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:27,847
Then what is the right answer?

126
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,584
Here's a rule, okay?

127
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:33,119
You should listen up, because maybe
you'll find a woman for yourself.

128
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,564
When a woman asks you
how old she is,

129
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:40,503
you think,
What age does she want to be?

130
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:44,303
And then you say that number.

131
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,467
That's the right answer.

132
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,143
You look 25.

133
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:58,854
Ya think?

134
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:03,688
Mm-hmm.

135
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:12,837
25.

136
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,671
<i># What it's all about #</i>

137
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,503
<i># I can't believe #</i>

138
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,049
<i># That woman done burnt me out #</i>

139
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,647
Don't say it.

140
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:34,316
All right.

141
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,053
- How do I look?
- Great.

142
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,458
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

143
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,090
- It's... You look great.
- Aren't you a little old for that shirt?

144
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,100
Didn't I just say "Don't say it"?
I think I did.

145
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,068
You're gonna watch her?

146
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:46,365
- Yeah.
- Okay.

147
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:48,737
- Where are you going at least?
- Out.

148
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:51,208
Oh, my God. That's him.

149
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:53,267
All right. Wish me luck.

150
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

151
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:01,585
Have a really wonderful time, Mom.

152
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:04,146
<i># Got to get in a hurry #</i>

153
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:06,954
Hey!

154
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,516
<i># I got to get on down #</i>

155
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,049
Shut up!

156
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:40,252
Shut up. This is my brother's place.

157
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,394
Baby, whoa.

158
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:51,130
Wait. Wait.

159
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:53,696
Just for fun? Wait.

160
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:56,335
We can say
it's the alcohol talking later.

161
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:59,642
But just for fun, just...
just say you love me.

162
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,615
Come on. Just say it.

163
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,916
Doesn't have to mean anything.

164
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:08,252
- I love you.
- Do you?

165
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:10,291
I love your jeans.

166
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:12,655
- Don't say that.
- I love your pants.

167
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,957
- Say it. Just say it.
- I love your underpants.

168
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:17,497
- Say it.
- I love you.

169
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:18,895
Yeah?

170
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:21,094
Who's the man
who always brings you flowers?

171
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,499
You.

172
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:27,497
Baby! Mmm!

173
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:34,007
Whoa. Wait. Wait.

174
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,573
Cool your jets. Hang on.
I'll be right back.

175
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,120
I'll be right back, okay?

176
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:59,936
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

177
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:03,242
Christ, what kind of flophouse
you runnin' here, Jojo?

178
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:08,410
I didn't mean to cramp your style, Sly.

179
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,680
Come on. Come on.

180
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:40,809
Hey.

181
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:46,649
Hey, get any sleep?

182
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,213
No.

183
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:56,801
You know, we should've asked you
if we could stay here.

184
00:12:56,865 --> 00:12:58,858
I should've done that.

185
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:02,094
You asked.

186
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,367
You... You called me up.

187
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,467
No, James.

188
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,035
I remember.

189
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,141
It was 2:00 in the morning.
The cops were going through everything.

190
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:20,313
I told you. I didn't ask you.

191
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:25,958
Well, anyway,
I'm glad you guys are here.

192
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,622
Jeez.

193
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:29,792
You know, James,
when people treat you bad,

194
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:32,929
you shouldn't turn around and be nice.

195
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:36,966
That's not how it works.

196
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,205
You're a good guy.

197
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:44,608
You should start standing up for yourself.

198
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:50,455
We're not with Dad anymore.

199
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:54,949
What's Dad got to do with this?

200
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:59,359
Nothin'.

201
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,365
Hey, you remember this?

202
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:07,732
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

203
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,802
That's the day we left the farm.

204
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:16,144
He beat the shit out of me that night.

205
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,916
Look at her.

206
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:29,460
She's growing up so fast.

207
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:35,566
I really screwed it up this time.

208
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,571
This is a good place for her.

209
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,818
I'm just trying to say thank you, James.

210
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:01,087
Yeah. It's...

211
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,822
It's okay.

212
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,597
Yeah.

213
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,480
Hey.

214
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:28,722
Um, I wouldn't go in there just...

215
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:31,384
just yet, okay?

216
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:35,028
Where's Mom?

217
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:36,562
What?

218
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:38,621
She's not here.

219
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:41,962
Did she leave a note or anything?

220
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,028
Did you see anything here?

221
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:47,372
She probably went out for smokes.
I gotta go.

222
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,435
I'm late for work. Sorry.

223
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,810
Hey, how you gonna get to school?

224
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,146
Um, I'll just wait for her.

225
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,207
Okay. Bye.

226
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:39,651
All right. That's lunch!

227
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:48,638
So, Speedy, you have any idea

228
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:52,666
where I could buy
about 2 acres worth of weed?

229
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:59,312
Don't worry. I'm not gonna let
any of these other morons in on it.

230
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:02,251
So what's she up to?

231
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,720
Joleen in jail?

232
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,353
She and Tara are staying at my place.

233
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:12,191
What? Oh, shit, man!

234
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:14,960
You gotta have me over!

235
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:17,467
Hey, Danni.

236
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:20,561
You wanna have lunch
with a couple of handsome guys?

237
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:23,071
Sure. Point 'em out for me.

238
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:26,236
Ha!

239
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:29,178
I know you love a man in a uniform.

240
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,681
She ain't bad.

241
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:37,744
You got trouble out there.

242
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,122
He's on the other side right now.

243
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:04,276
Joleen?

244
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,886
What?

245
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,359
These are yours.

246
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,668
Did you see Mom?

247
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,331
No.

248
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,965
Hey, Tara?

249
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,044
Hey, come on.

250
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,447
She says she's got a plan.

251
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,787
She says she'll be back
for your birthday.

252
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:56,623
That's... That's, uh,
just a month from now, right?

253
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,751
It won't be so bad, you know?
Come on.

254
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:02,127
l-l... I'll do whatever you want to do.

255
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:06,136
You... You tell me what to do,
and I'll do it, okay?

256
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,630
We'll have fun.

257
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:12,864
You know, I-I...

258
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:18,073
I'm gonna need a ride to school...

259
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,116
from now on.

260
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:23,483
I can get a ride back here,

261
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:26,022
but you're gonna
have to drive me to school.

262
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:30,019
What about the bus?

263
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:32,323
The bus doesn't come out here.

264
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:34,831
Anyway, the bus sucks.

265
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:40,164
I-I guess you could ride my bike
if you want.

266
00:21:40,236 --> 00:21:42,468
I'm not riding your stupid bike.

267
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:45,874
I can barely touch the pedals.

268
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:48,070
You can drive my mom's car.

269
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:52,306
I don't... I don't drive, though.

270
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:56,880
And I don't think she would be
too happy about that, either.

271
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:02,254
Then I guess I'll just sit here
in your shitty apartment

272
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:03,953
until my mom comes back!

273
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,427
Where are the gears?

274
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:17,236
There are no gears, Uncle James.
It's an automatic.

275
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:20,939
It's way easier driving without gears.

276
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:24,439
You just drive.

277
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,324
R is reverse.

278
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:32,720
Let's go.

279
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:41,233
This is it. Here. Here!

280
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:43,701
Oh. Sorry.

281
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:52,138
Okay, Tara.

282
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,942
Have a nice... day.

283
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:04,957
Higher. Higher.

284
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:07,823
Set them there by the jungle gym.

285
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,201
I've never seen you drive before.

286
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:19,761
Oh, yeah.

287
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:22,171
You know Tara. She...
She had to get to school, so...

288
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,508
What about her mother?
Why didn't she take her?

289
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:29,516
Oh, she's gonna be gone for a while.

290
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:32,784
Well, where has she gone?

291
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:37,686
I don't know.

292
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,826
Don't worry.
I'm... I'm taking care of Tara.

293
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,991
James, look, I think it's great
that you're trying,

294
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:49,000
but you gotta watch it.

295
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:52,871
You're gonna get yourself
in all sorts of shit here.

296
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:58,271
I don't know what else to do.

297
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:08,554
You want something else?
I can make something else.

298
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,556
There's nothing here anyway.

299
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:16,728
What do you want to do tonight?

300
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:36,009
Can we go look for Mom tomorrow?

301
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:40,919
After my work.

302
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:43,481
No. In the morning.

303
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:46,121
Well, we can't do that.

304
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,130
I've... I've gotta go to work,
and you've got school, too.

305
00:24:50,463 --> 00:24:52,934
Well, you just asked me
what I wanted to do.

306
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,693
Yeah, but I-I...

307
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,001
So you didn't mean it?

308
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:05,474
I want to look for Mom tomorrow.

309
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:09,314
This is James.

310
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,976
James.

311
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,078
Yeah. Speedy. Right.

312
00:25:13,153 --> 00:25:16,353
Is Mr. Carvel there?

313
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:18,586
Okay. Well, could you tell him,

314
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,896
uh, that I can't come into work today
because of my back?

315
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:26,403
Just... What's that? Yeah.

316
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:29,667
I-I know. Okay.

317
00:25:33,174 --> 00:25:35,110
Can we go?

318
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,416
Uncle James?

319
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:44,483
Yeah.

320
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:53,918
Barbara!

321
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:58,627
<i>What?</i>

322
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:02,707
And what are you two
doing here in the middle of the day?

323
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:06,277
- We're looking for Joleen.
- Joleen?

324
00:26:06,342 --> 00:26:08,277
Well, she's not here.

325
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:10,142
Isn't she with Warren?

326
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:14,152
Warren's in jail, Mrs. Bergen,
if you didn't know already.

327
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:17,450
- He was arrested for growing pot.
- No. No. He would've called.

328
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,390
Have you seen my mom?
That's all we're asking.

329
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:25,125
Tara, you know I don't ever
speak to your mother.

330
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:42,446
Warren, you know where they might be?

331
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:47,642
Do you even know you're in jail?

332
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,356
It's your fault she left
in the first place, Warren.

333
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:54,357
This whole thing is your fault.

334
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:56,394
I'm just wondering how long
this has been going on.

335
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,453
That's what I'd like to know.

336
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,757
Do you know what Mom would call you?

337
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:06,969
She had a name for you
when it was just me and her talking.

338
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:12,269
She'd say it, and we'd laugh.

339
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:15,813
Do you know what it was?

340
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:20,480
I don't believe you.

341
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,055
What was it?

342
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,061
Tara, what did she call me?

343
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:32,064
Tara, get back here, you little shit!

344
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:35,329
What did she call me? Tara!

345
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:16,869
- Uh-oh.
- Shit.

346
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:25,652
Hey!

347
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:29,212
Give me your helmet.

348
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:38,221
You're done.

349
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:08,692
- Why aren't you in school?
- I overslept.

350
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:11,234
- Come on. I'll drive you right now.
- No, no, no.

351
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:14,292
'Cause I'm too late already.
It's not like I have an excuse.

352
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:17,498
- It's not like I'm sick or anything.
- Tara, you gotta go to school.

353
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,837
Well, why aren't you at work?

354
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:23,003
I got fired.

355
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:25,640
Was it 'cause you were late today?

356
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:28,874
No, no. It's...

357
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:32,750
It's not just today.

358
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:38,490
If you want me to go to school,
I'll get ready,

359
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,053
and then you can drive me, okay?

360
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:04,913
Hey. All right if we come in?

361
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,478
Yeah.

362
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:18,436
You, uh, mind if we sit down and talk?

363
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,301
- Go ahead.
- I need to talk to Joleen, too.

364
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,305
This concerns her.

365
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:25,968
Oh, she's not here right now.

366
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,374
Oh.

367
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:29,709
Where might she be?

368
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:31,715
I don't know.

369
00:30:33,116 --> 00:30:37,352
She said she'll be back
in about a month.

370
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,255
Everything's fine here, okay?

371
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,951
What day is it today?

372
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,688
Friday.

373
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,995
A school day.

374
00:30:55,705 --> 00:30:59,270
James, why isn't Tara in school today?

375
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:03,171
We... We overslept.

376
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:08,279
Yeah. I... We...
We've had a lot going on lately.

377
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:10,515
Yeah, I know.

378
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:14,549
This is important.
This woman's from Social Services.

379
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:17,027
This is the part of my job I really hate.

380
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:20,464
Tara needs a proper guardian,
and with Joleen gone,

381
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,129
I'm not so sure that it's here with you.

382
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:25,864
I'm sorry.

383
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,851
He's probably right, if you think about it.

384
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:41,709
Don't you think?

385
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:45,219
Tara?

386
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:50,556
It's... It's not forever, you know?

387
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:53,156
I-I promise.

388
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:55,461
Okay, let's do it.

389
00:32:58,363 --> 00:33:01,426
Hey, don't worry about paying rent
or anything for a while.

390
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,301
You've been fucked over enough lately.

391
00:33:06,371 --> 00:33:08,638
Go down into the basement.

392
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:14,145
Okay, here it is.
You're welcome to it.

393
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,446
Obviously not deluxe accommodations,

394
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:20,182
but you got runnin' water,
you got a place to hang your clothes.

395
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:24,558
That's the mattress here?

396
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:27,425
Oh, yeah. I tried to pump it up for you.

397
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:30,262
This damn thing...
My arm about fell off.

398
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:32,392
Jesus Christ.

399
00:33:32,465 --> 00:33:34,527
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hey, how about this?

400
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:39,805
How about we throw a party tonight
in honor of your moving in here?

401
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:42,003
We do it up huge.

402
00:33:42,076 --> 00:33:45,846
- Are you sure Sharon's gonna be...
- Don't worry about Sharon.

403
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:48,145
- I wear the pants in this...
- Randall!

404
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:50,584
- What, honey?
- Get your ass up here!

405
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:52,484
Okay, sweetie. I'm coming.

406
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:55,252
- Now!
- All right. I gotta go.

407
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:57,885
- You fuckin' deaf? Randall!
- Yeah, man. Just make yourself comfy.

408
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,586
- Now!
- Okay, baby.

409
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,187
Here I come.

410
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:03,755
Oh. Sorry.

411
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:09,798
Is this a fucking joint?

412
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:11,499
Now, honey...

413
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:14,510
Sweet pea? Honey bunch?

414
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:19,673
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

415
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:38,699
Whew.

416
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:42,228
Oh, shit!

417
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,901
Speedy Reedy.

418
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:50,978
Hey.

419
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,040
So, what, you're living here now?

420
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:56,886
Yeah, I'm in the basement
just since today.

421
00:34:56,953 --> 00:34:59,389
What about Tara?

422
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:04,363
Oh, uh, they said I wasn't
a proper guardian.

423
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:05,691
Just, you know...

424
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:08,254
- Social Services?
- Yeah.

425
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:09,595
Yeah.

426
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:13,230
Hey, Speedy, get your ass in here!

427
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:15,934
Go ahead. I'll go sit with Sharon.
Where is she at?

428
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:18,841
In the kitchen, I think.
She didn't wanna play quarters.

429
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,898
No kidding.

430
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:22,037
- My God!
- Hey.

431
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:23,637
Hi, Danni.

432
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:26,149
Your fanny is uncanny.

433
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:28,345
Very funny, Randall.

434
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,618
"Your fanny"...

435
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:38,854
Hey, come on, Speedster.

436
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,488
Sit down, man.

437
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:43,935
Sit down here under the vacancy sign.

438
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:46,267
That's it. Okay.

439
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:49,503
Speedy!

440
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:52,636
Speedy! Speedy! Speedy!

441
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:55,806
Speedy! Speedy! Speedy!

442
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:58,180
Speedy! Speedy!

443
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,622
Really?

444
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:09,928
You think that'll work?

445
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:11,827
Mmm, I don't know.

446
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,666
I'll give it a shot for you.

447
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:20,734
- He's pretty angry.
- Yeah.

448
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,797
Yeah, well, fuck him, all right?

449
00:36:22,873 --> 00:36:25,640
I'll talk to him on Monday.
I'll lay it on thick.

450
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,379
He's Christian or Jewish or something
prone to guilt, but I'll just...

451
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:33,182
We'll get your job back. Don't worry.

452
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:38,754
Hey, maybe I can just
get another job, you know?

453
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,986
Well, yeah, if you can.

454
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,724
There's gotta be places, right?

455
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:45,458
Sure.

456
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:52,229
Joleen would know what to do, you know?

457
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:55,903
We should hold off till she gets back,
ask her what to do.

458
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:58,344
She'll know.

459
00:36:58,411 --> 00:37:02,214
Speedy, you gotta wake up, man.

460
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,912
You've seen the last of her.
Joleen is gone.

461
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,749
No, Randall. I told you.

462
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:10,349
She sent a letter,
sent money and everything.

463
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:12,359
She says she's got a plan.

464
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:14,327
She's gonna be back
for Tara's birthday.

465
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:16,728
Okay, well, I'm on your side.

466
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:19,289
Uh, and, actually, you're lucky

467
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:22,702
because you don't have to
look after that kid anymore, so...

468
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:28,507
I think I'm gonna get going.

469
00:37:28,575 --> 00:37:31,138
Danni, what? The night's a puppy.

470
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:34,707
Yeah, well, my boys aren't gonna wait
for me if I'm slow in the morning, are they?

471
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:37,549
See, now, that right there
is another reason why you're lucky.

472
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:39,611
Jeez!

473
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:41,985
Don't go gettin' dramatic on me now.

474
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:44,082
Randall, shut up
and help me get him to bed.

475
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:45,648
You okay?

476
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:47,058
- Yeah.
- Come on.

477
00:37:47,127 --> 00:37:49,997
- Oh, God.
- It's harder than I thought.

478
00:37:50,063 --> 00:37:52,432
- Come on.
- Thanks, Danni.

479
00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:59,598
Okay, watch your head now.

480
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:02,771
Jesus, Randall,
you're making him sleep down here?

481
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:06,282
Well, where should we have him sleep?
In bed with me and Sharon?

482
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,978
Joleen's coming back
on Tara's birthday.

483
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,420
Oh, yeah. Sure she is, pal.

484
00:38:14,388 --> 00:38:17,087
- She is.
- Get your head up on that pillow there.

485
00:38:17,158 --> 00:38:19,925
- Why don't you go? I can look after him.
- That's what she said.

486
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:21,860
Oh. Okay.

487
00:38:24,398 --> 00:38:27,529
- Jeez.
- Here, honey. Roll over.

488
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:36,379
- How's that feel?
- It's good.

489
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:37,937
Feels good?

490
00:38:38,013 --> 00:38:40,415
Yeah.

491
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:52,885
You miss that girl, don't you?

492
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,170
She's a good kid. She's a good kid.

493
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:07,837
I wanted to...
I wanted to... to tell her, you know?

494
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:11,314
But I couldn't.
I didn't know... the words to say it,

495
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:15,685
so all I could do was,
you know, make it fun,

496
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:19,692
but... I couldn't even do that.

497
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,421
James, it's not your fault.

498
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:26,860
Danni?

499
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:28,921
Yes, honey.

500
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,937
Can you go now, please?

501
00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:48,311
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay.

502
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:50,810
Okay.

503
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:10,475
Give me a call
when you feel like it, okay?

504
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:18,575
Please open the door.

505
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:23,413
Darlene, what did I tell you
about blocking the door?

506
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:34,095
Tara, you have a visitor.

507
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,825
Happy birthday.

508
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:51,869
Why don't you open your present?

509
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:56,448
The other girls will just take it.

510
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:58,885
They go through my stuff at night.

511
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,880
I never sleep.

512
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:08,894
A woman at the foster place
is talking to me about adoption.

513
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:18,502
Maybe Joleen is just...

514
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,144
delayed wherever she's at.

515
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,309
The woman said I might get
a family who has a regular house.

516
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,481
She said they might have a kids' room,

517
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:34,546
might have a dog.

518
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:37,849
I don't even like dogs.

519
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:41,888
I don't care.

520
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:45,862
I could just close my door.

521
00:43:04,988 --> 00:43:06,924
It's almost 6:00.

522
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:10,928
I should, uh, get you back, you know?

523
00:43:11,994 --> 00:43:14,989
I'm not going back there.

524
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:20,935
Can I stay with you?

525
00:43:22,772 --> 00:43:24,901
We can't.

526
00:43:24,974 --> 00:43:27,343
It'll just be for tonight.

527
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,367
<i>God!</i>

528
00:43:59,308 --> 00:44:02,246
- I'll see you guys.
- Not gonna tell us her name?

529
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:04,612
- Randall!
- Sorry, sweetie.

530
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:07,279
No, it's not like that.
I'm, uh, just going out.

531
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:10,015
Whatever, Speedy,
but can you just call Danni back?

532
00:44:10,087 --> 00:44:12,250
'Cause I'm not
your personal answering service.

533
00:44:12,322 --> 00:44:14,053
Yeah.

534
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:18,853
Have fun out there.

535
00:44:47,325 --> 00:44:50,660
Say you could go
anywhere in the world right now...

536
00:44:57,669 --> 00:44:59,662
I don't care.

537
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:10,244

$315.

556
00:47:27,356 --> 00:47:29,018
Really?

557
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,354
That's not that much.

558
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:34,419
How far could we go?

559
00:47:35,463 --> 00:47:37,627
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

560
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,228
We could go to Mexico.

561
00:47:41,304 --> 00:47:43,501
Isn't that where you go
in this sort of situation?

562
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:45,337
Mexico?

563
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,604
Yeah. Like in the movies.

564
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:51,583
I don't think we have enough
to get that far.

565
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:55,185
Well, we need fake names.

566
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:57,778
You know, so we don't get caught.

567
00:47:57,853 --> 00:48:02,192
I'll be Nicole,
and I want to be 13 years old,

568
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:04,957
'cause being 12 is stupid.

569
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:08,365
Yeah. Okay.

570
00:48:08,431 --> 00:48:11,893
Yeah, yeah. I'll be, uh... I'll be Randall.

571
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:16,569
No. You have to be my dad.
Otherwise, it'll look weird to people.

572
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,374
So I'll call you Dad,
and you call me Nicole.

573
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:24,441
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Nicole.

574
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:31,688
So where are we going to, Dad?

575
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:36,454
You ever been to a farm?

576
00:48:36,526 --> 00:48:38,428
A real one?

577
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:42,127
We can go to my dad's farm.
I think we have enough to get there.

578
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:46,104
The farm where you and Mom grew up?

579
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,662
Yeah.

580
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:55,480
Mom said she'd rather die
than go back there.

581
00:48:57,615 --> 00:49:00,348
There's horses.
You ever seen a horse?

582
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:03,721
At a fair once. Brown one.

583
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:06,020
You could ride it for a dollar.

584
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:09,188
How long a ride?

585
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:12,462
I don't know.
I lost my dollar at the ring toss.

586
00:49:13,465 --> 00:49:15,661
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

587
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:17,225
Okay.

588
00:49:21,272 --> 00:49:23,333
Nicole.

589
00:49:29,448 --> 00:49:31,509
So there's this guy in a cabin,

590
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:34,578
and he's got a hole in his roof,
and it's raining.

591
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:37,591
And, uh, a traveler is walking by,

592
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:39,990
and he says, "Hey,
you got a hole up in your roof.

593
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:44,090
Water's gettin' in.
Why don't you patch that up?"

594
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:47,329
He says, "Well, can't do it now
'cause it's raining."

595
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:51,134
He says, "Well, why don't you
patch it up when it's not raining?"

596
00:49:51,203 --> 00:49:56,077
And he said, "Well, when it's not raining,
then no water's coming through."

597
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:02,346
Does it have a punch line?

598
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,177
That's the joke.

599
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:10,580
It's bad.

600
00:50:35,649 --> 00:50:37,584
Let's go!

601
00:50:37,651 --> 00:50:39,587
Hey, don't look.

602
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:50,959
If you tell them in the right order,
they're a lot funnier, you know?

603
00:50:53,835 --> 00:50:55,497
Well...

604
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:22,691
Tara!

605
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,033
Hey!

606
00:51:59,068 --> 00:52:00,970
Tara?

607
00:54:10,034 --> 00:54:11,867
I'm so cold.

608
00:54:11,937 --> 00:54:13,964
<i>Aren't you a little old for that shirt?</i>

609
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,510
<i>What kind of shit do you need
from me right now, Mom?</i>

610
00:54:16,576 --> 00:54:18,911
<i>I'm not pretending
to do my homework.</i>

611
00:54:18,978 --> 00:54:21,278
<i>I'm pretending not to hate my life.</i>

612
00:54:21,347 --> 00:54:23,340
<i>Where are you going, at least?</i>

613
00:55:05,992 --> 00:55:07,688
Shit!

614
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,223
You need a hand?

615
00:55:31,352 --> 00:55:32,878
<i># I sleep all day #</i>

616
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,252
<i># Out all night #</i>

617
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:37,021
<i># I know where you're goin' #</i>

618
00:55:37,091 --> 00:55:38,993
<i># I don't think that's actin' right #</i>

619
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,053
- Hi.
- What the man said is

620
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,691
he'd give me some money
to do some work for him back there.

621
00:55:43,764 --> 00:55:45,427
Oh. Cool.

622
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:48,937
You gonna be all right
hanging out here?

623
00:55:49,004 --> 00:55:51,167
Sure.

624
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,903
There's three kids over there
you can play with.

625
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:05,945
Mmm.

626
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,013
All right. I'm off to work, then.

627
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:10,117
Bye.

628
01:01:47,505 --> 01:01:50,533
Hey, come on.

629
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:59,078
Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

630
01:01:59,151 --> 01:02:02,784
Come on now. Come on.

631
01:02:02,854 --> 01:02:05,188
Come on.

632
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:09,924
Come on.

633
01:02:18,603 --> 01:02:20,698
Make it.

634
01:02:20,772 --> 01:02:24,371
Come on. Come on.

635
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,973
Come on.

636
01:02:31,116 --> 01:02:33,417
Take her out to pasture.

637
01:02:33,485 --> 01:02:35,421
Get rid of this, and then you can go.

638
01:02:41,526 --> 01:02:43,120
Hey, Dad.

639
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:47,466
This is my daughter Nicole.

640
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:53,408
Well, isn't this a surprise?

641
01:02:58,678 --> 01:03:02,082
State bird in California is the quail.

642
01:03:02,148 --> 01:03:04,551
State bird's a quail.

643
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:08,614
You got the brown bear on the flag.

644
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:12,092
What else do I know about California?

645
01:03:12,158 --> 01:03:15,359
House looks good. Looks the same.

646
01:03:16,863 --> 01:03:18,924
Joleen's got a house.

647
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:21,629
We got a house in the country.

648
01:03:22,836 --> 01:03:24,601
A country house?

649
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:27,609
- That's right.
- Well!

650
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:35,348
We're more in the city part...
Nicole and me.

651
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:38,616
And Nicole's mother.

652
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:44,824
I don't notice a ring on your finger.

653
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:48,423
I-I lost it... a while back.

654
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:50,158
What about the missus?

655
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:54,368
Did you lose her, too?

656
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:56,734
No, Dad.

657
01:04:06,414 --> 01:04:08,885
So what's the big mystery?

658
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:12,950
She's in New York.

659
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:15,484
In New York, huh?

660
01:04:15,556 --> 01:04:17,959
It's for her job.

661
01:04:18,026 --> 01:04:20,121
It's in computers.

662
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:22,961
So we thought we'd take this time,

663
01:04:23,031 --> 01:04:25,935
you know, come out here for a vacation.

664
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:27,492
Hmm.

665
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:31,009
Nicole's never been
to a real farm before.

666
01:04:31,073 --> 01:04:35,137
So, when her mother gets back,
we'll meet up and, uh,

667
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,374
take it from there.

668
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,773
Joleen's living the good life, huh,

669
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:42,910
in her magnificent country estate?

670
01:04:43,986 --> 01:04:46,514
I-I didn't say estate.

671
01:04:56,098 --> 01:05:00,038
She still livin' with that one guy?
What was his name?

672
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:04,065
You know,
the one that knocked her up.

673
01:05:06,343 --> 01:05:07,834
No.

674
01:05:11,047 --> 01:05:13,039
What about the kid?

675
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:16,713
She end up having it?

676
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,815
I never heard...

677
01:05:20,823 --> 01:05:24,263
so you can imagine I'm kind of curious.

678
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:30,591
No.

679
01:05:31,668 --> 01:05:35,904
Well, I got the one, though, right, Nicole?

680
01:05:35,972 --> 01:05:37,965
One grandkid's better than none.

681
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,648
Well, you two better hit the sack.

682
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:47,117
Got an early rise tomorrow.

683
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:51,982
How's she on dishes?

684
01:05:53,057 --> 01:05:55,219
Fine, I guess.

685
01:05:55,292 --> 01:05:56,784
Good.

686
01:06:13,911 --> 01:06:16,245
Rise and shine.

687
01:06:16,313 --> 01:06:18,580
Rise and shine.

688
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,811
- Hey.
- Hey.

689
01:09:00,882 --> 01:09:02,818
This is Jack.

690
01:09:04,219 --> 01:09:06,314
Your mom named him that
when he was young.

691
01:09:08,457 --> 01:09:11,486
But you're a big boy now, aren't you? Huh?

692
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:16,028
Hey, you wanna see something?

693
01:09:22,404 --> 01:09:24,397
He likes apples.

694
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:29,940
Can I try?

695
01:09:30,012 --> 01:09:31,413
Yeah.

696
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:40,186
- He's letting me do it.
- What are you doing?

697
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:41,849
Feeding apples.

698
01:09:41,924 --> 01:09:45,728
- Did I say for you to do that?
- No, I was just...

699
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:48,927
- I was showing Nicole how to...
- What happens if my horses get colic?

700
01:09:48,999 --> 01:09:52,096
You know how to take care of him
if he gets colic?

701
01:09:55,004 --> 01:09:57,441
Then maybe you should ask me

702
01:09:57,508 --> 01:10:00,172
before you start
shoving food in his mouth.

703
01:10:02,446 --> 01:10:04,439
It was my idea.

704
01:10:06,584 --> 01:10:08,520
I figured that.

705
01:10:37,783 --> 01:10:40,345
James didn't go to school much, either.

706
01:10:40,418 --> 01:10:42,547
- Right, James?
- Right.

707
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:45,593
Had him working full time

708
01:10:45,657 --> 01:10:48,788
when he was just, uh,
a little bit older than you.

709
01:10:50,027 --> 01:10:54,731
It's not like they lost their star pupil
or anything, is it, James, huh?

710
01:10:54,799 --> 01:10:58,102
Idiot.

711
01:11:50,757 --> 01:11:53,923
See ya.

712
01:12:36,971 --> 01:12:38,907
I'm sorry.

713
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,974
Nicole?

714
01:12:55,757 --> 01:12:59,755
Guess it was my mom's dress,
wasn't it?

715
01:13:56,986 --> 01:14:00,221
Come on! Come on! Feed the cattle.

716
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:26,450
Can't you see
that that doesn't work that way?

717
01:14:26,516 --> 01:14:29,352
You didn't coil with the lay again!

718
01:14:29,419 --> 01:14:31,082
Well, I tried.

719
01:14:31,154 --> 01:14:33,591
And don't get smart with me,

720
01:14:33,658 --> 01:14:36,391
you little shit!

721
01:14:37,395 --> 01:14:41,802
- Have you... Show me yours again.
- Dad, it's getting to be suppertime.

722
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,966
Not until Nicole here learns
how to coil a rope properly

723
01:14:46,036 --> 01:14:49,167
instead of running her dirty trap
all the time!

724
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:52,974
Come on!
And go with the lay of this.

725
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:58,775
Give me that. Go into the lay!

726
01:15:29,815 --> 01:15:31,307
Nicole.

727
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:35,321
Nicole, come on! Get up!

728
01:15:35,387 --> 01:15:36,879
What?

729
01:16:15,128 --> 01:16:18,259
My hand is completely full of blisters.

730
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,834
Here. Here, let me take a look.

731
01:16:37,117 --> 01:16:39,315
Hyah! Get in there!

732
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,049
Go on! Go on!

733
01:16:41,122 --> 01:16:43,319
Why'd you bring us here?

734
01:16:49,029 --> 01:16:51,022
I thought you'd like it.

735
01:16:55,502 --> 01:16:58,030
And we were out of money.

736
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:04,546
I didn't know where else to go.

737
01:17:04,613 --> 01:17:07,175
There's so many other places
we could've gone.

738
01:17:07,247 --> 01:17:09,240
I mean, Mom said she would
never come back here.

739
01:17:09,316 --> 01:17:12,653
- Not in a million years.
- Shh. Don't, Tara. Don't talk like that.

740
01:17:12,721 --> 01:17:15,989
It's... It's fine. Usually, he's...

741
01:17:16,056 --> 01:17:17,992
- The way he talked to us?
- Yeah.

742
01:17:18,059 --> 01:17:19,653
- And the way he treated you?
- Listen...

743
01:17:19,728 --> 01:17:22,359
- It's not fine.
- Hey, don't... don't... don't be loud, okay?

744
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,665
You gotta... You gotta be quiet.
Usually, he's fine.

745
01:17:25,735 --> 01:17:29,173
It was him and your mom
that always had the problems.

746
01:17:29,236 --> 01:17:32,505
Now, he's... he's a particular
kind of... kind of man,

747
01:17:32,574 --> 01:17:37,073
but if you just keep your mouth shut
and just do the work, then it's fine.

748
01:17:37,145 --> 01:17:40,607
But your mom... she just never did.

749
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:44,487
One day, she met this guy,
and he tried to take her away.

750
01:17:44,553 --> 01:17:47,922
Dad found out,
and he took it real hard.

751
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,894
Finally, after a few months,
it got so bad between 'em,

752
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,055
she was on me and on me to go,

753
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:56,032
and so, finally, I just... I said, "Okay,"

754
01:17:56,098 --> 01:17:58,228
and we snuck out
in the middle of the night.

755
01:17:59,702 --> 01:18:02,003
- Now we're back.
- But, hey,

756
01:18:02,072 --> 01:18:04,440
don't... don't take it wrong, okay?

757
01:18:04,507 --> 01:18:08,675
It's... It's Joleen that he's always
had the problem with.

758
01:18:08,744 --> 01:18:10,805
You know?
And we won't be here long anyway.

759
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,477
- You promise?
- Yeah.

760
01:18:13,549 --> 01:18:17,080
Yeah, look, if we do the work now,

761
01:18:17,154 --> 01:18:20,855
then maybe he'll even give us
some money for the road.

762
01:18:28,164 --> 01:18:30,191
I wonder what happened to that guy.

763
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:31,598
Who?

764
01:18:33,236 --> 01:18:36,801
The man Mom was gonna
run off with, you know?

765
01:18:40,711 --> 01:18:44,116
I don't know. He just...
He never came back.

766
01:18:46,784 --> 01:18:49,880
I wonder what would've happened
if she had gone with him.

767
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:04,394
Excuse me.

768
01:19:04,468 --> 01:19:06,961
Hi, I'm... I'm Joleen Reedy.

769
01:19:07,072 --> 01:19:11,375
- My daughter, Tara Reedy, is missing.
- I gotta call you back.

770
01:19:11,441 --> 01:19:14,778
If you hear anything, can you just call me
from this number here?

771
01:19:14,846 --> 01:19:17,613
Where the hell have you been?
How nice of you to show up.

772
01:19:17,682 --> 01:19:21,053
I'll take it from here.
So was that your plan, Joleen, hmm?

773
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:23,351
Just completely abandon Tara
so she could go

774
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:25,482
straight exactly
into what I was afraid of for her...

775
01:19:25,556 --> 01:19:26,855
Child Services?

776
01:19:26,925 --> 01:19:29,657
I mean, who the hell knows
where she's at now?

777
01:19:29,727 --> 01:19:32,722
- Please tell me something!
- I don't know.

778
01:19:32,797 --> 01:19:35,394
I don't know what to say, okay?

779
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:36,798
I don't.

780
01:19:36,869 --> 01:19:38,805
I don't. You... You're it, okay?

781
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:41,865
I fucked up... I fucked up, and I can't...

782
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,967
I can't take it back.

783
01:19:44,042 --> 01:19:46,809
My number. You can just
call me if you hear anything.

784
01:19:46,879 --> 01:19:51,149
Joleen, you, uh...
you got someplace to stay?

785
01:19:53,351 --> 01:19:55,082
What about a job?

786
01:19:55,153 --> 01:19:57,146
I'm working on it.

787
01:20:07,934 --> 01:20:09,597
<i>The Voyager spacecraft</i>

788
01:20:09,668 --> 01:20:13,199
<i>has been exploring
uncharted territory for some time,</i>

789
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:16,642
<i>but now it's really
going into the great beyond.</i>

790
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:19,111
<i>Launched in 1977,</i>

791
01:20:19,179 --> 01:20:23,279
<i>Voyager has now traveled
more than 13 billion kilometers...</i>

792
01:20:23,349 --> 01:20:26,186
<i>well beyond the most distant planet.</i>

793
01:20:26,253 --> 01:20:28,519
<i>Voyager is, in fact, right on the edge</i>

794
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:31,890
<i>of stepping into interstellar space.</i>

795
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:36,491
<i>What it should meet there is something
called the "termination shock."</i>

796
01:20:36,562 --> 01:20:39,500
<i>This is a shock wave
where the tenuous messages</i>

797
01:20:39,565 --> 01:20:43,005
<i>of the solar wind particles
ejected by our sun</i>

798
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:47,306
<i>run into the cosmic wind particles
floating through deep space.</i>

799
01:20:47,374 --> 01:20:50,278
<i>In fact, according to some new research,</i>

800
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,783
<i>Voyager may have already
hit this shock wave.</i>

801
01:20:53,846 --> 01:20:56,910
<i>This week, two groups
announced their latest results</i>

802
01:20:56,984 --> 01:20:58,509
<i>from instruments aboard the space...</i>

803
01:20:58,585 --> 01:21:01,386
Dad, I don't know if I said it,
but it's real nice...

804
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:03,254
you lettin' us stay here.

805
01:21:03,324 --> 01:21:06,023
So thanks.

806
01:21:06,093 --> 01:21:09,066
But, uh, work, you know...

807
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:12,728
It's... It's real... real hard.

808
01:21:13,934 --> 01:21:16,531
You don't have to tell me.

809
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:18,403
Especially for Nicole.

810
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:21,411
<i>- Welcome back to the show.
- Thank you.</i>

811
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:24,813
And this... this was gonna be a vacation.

812
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,873
That was the original plan.

813
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:30,386
Yeah, well, hoop-di-doo.

814
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,422
Are you kidding?

815
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:35,424
So I think, uh...

816
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:41,998
we're probably gonna have to move on now.

817
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:45,734
And I was also thinkin'

818
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:51,438
maybe you could give us some money
for the work that we did here.

819
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,999
Think that might be fair.

820
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:09,893
I just want some money, that's all.

821
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:13,295
Who is Tara?

822
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:17,394
<i>Well beyond the most distant planet.</i>

823
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,294
Before you came here,

824
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,898
I got a little social visit...

825
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:25,966
these guys from the sheriff's.

826
01:22:27,277 --> 01:22:31,776
And they told me a whole story
about a kid named Tara.

827
01:22:34,584 --> 01:22:36,986
That's not Tara.

828
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,113
That's Nicole, and she's my daughter.

829
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:41,590
Oh, bullshit!

830
01:22:43,226 --> 01:22:45,594
Imagine the tree you'd be hanging from

831
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:48,600
if I'd have called that sheriff on this.

832
01:22:48,665 --> 01:22:51,192
And where would she be?

833
01:22:57,874 --> 01:23:00,812
So as long as you're doing
all that thinking,

834
01:23:00,877 --> 01:23:03,109
why don't you think about that?

835
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:07,622
And don't you go telling me
what you think is fair!

836
01:23:11,756 --> 01:23:13,952
You little prick!

837
01:24:19,024 --> 01:24:22,053
Hey, what's wrong?

838
01:24:24,096 --> 01:24:25,429
Nothing.

839
01:24:25,598 --> 01:24:28,331
We're fine for now, okay?
Let me figure something out.

840
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:29,869
Get to work!

841
01:24:29,936 --> 01:24:32,065
And you,

842
01:24:32,138 --> 01:24:34,267
get up and get to it,

843
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,902
or I'll beat your ass into next week!

844
01:24:36,975 --> 01:24:39,572
What is this?

845
01:24:39,646 --> 01:24:42,015
Are you playing games with me?

846
01:24:42,081 --> 01:24:46,021
Lettin' the horses stand in
their own manure till they get thrush!

847
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:50,117
Was that your idea?
Now get your ass in there!

848
01:24:53,694 --> 01:24:55,219
I can't...

849
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:57,424
You don't think I can hear you?

850
01:24:57,497 --> 01:24:58,989
You don't think I can hear you?

851
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,236
Now say something.

852
01:25:03,303 --> 01:25:06,070
Now you clean up that shit!

853
01:25:07,707 --> 01:25:11,613
I don't wanna see that ornery face
that you put on while you're doing it!

854
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,946
Dad, she wasn't being ornery.
She was just trying to help.

855
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:15,209
Huh?

856
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:17,752
You don't know shit about shit!

857
01:25:17,818 --> 01:25:19,913
You stay down, James!

858
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:25,786
Don't you fuckin' look at me, boy!
I'll split your head open like a pumpkin!

859
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:29,093
Ya hear me?

860
01:25:29,163 --> 01:25:31,828
You put your eyes on the floor.

861
01:25:34,703 --> 01:25:36,604
Hmm!

862
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,537
You think I can't break you?

863
01:25:38,606 --> 01:25:40,269
I'll break every last one of ya.

864
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:45,339
And I'll break you of that city-shit attitude!

865
01:25:45,413 --> 01:25:47,645
Your dirty sister and your whore of a mother

866
01:25:47,716 --> 01:25:50,017
tried to teach both of ya!

867
01:25:50,085 --> 01:25:52,021
But it won't happen again.

868
01:25:52,087 --> 01:25:55,218
Now get down there
and clean that shit up!

869
01:26:00,094 --> 01:26:01,723
You don't think I can strike you?

870
01:26:01,795 --> 01:26:03,287
- No!
- You little piece of trash!

871
01:26:03,365 --> 01:26:04,925
- Sorry!
- Huh?

872
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,461
I'll spank you like I spank every horse here!

873
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:11,772
- Don't you fuckin' touch her!
- Aah!

874
01:26:11,841 --> 01:26:13,606
You didn't break me!

875
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,145
You didn't break me!

876
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:18,774
You're never breaking her!

877
01:26:18,847 --> 01:26:20,817
You hear me?

878
01:26:20,882 --> 01:26:22,373
Never!

879
01:26:36,899 --> 01:26:39,597
You piece of shit.

880
01:26:42,003 --> 01:26:44,440
You piece of shit.

881
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,371
You...

882
01:26:47,443 --> 01:26:51,350
You ruined everything.

883
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,977
You ruin everything!

884
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:06,918
I want to go home.

885
01:29:28,408 --> 01:29:30,879
Aw, shit!

886
01:29:30,945 --> 01:29:32,881
Detective Woll speaking.

887
01:29:32,946 --> 01:29:35,850
<i>- Detective Woll?
- Yep, that's me.</i>

888
01:29:35,916 --> 01:29:39,321
Hi. It's, uh... It's James... Reedy.

889
01:29:39,386 --> 01:29:42,323
James, uh, where are you?

890
01:29:43,557 --> 01:29:46,027
I'm at my dad's ranch.

891
01:29:47,194 --> 01:29:48,856
But, uh...

892
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:53,161
Yeah, he's... he's dead. I...

893
01:29:53,233 --> 01:29:56,330
<i>l- I killed him.</i>

894
01:30:00,475 --> 01:30:02,467
I didn't know what else to do.

895
01:30:02,543 --> 01:30:04,912
You know, he... he was going
after Tara, so...

896
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:07,506
Oh, ok-okay. Is... Is Tara all right?

897
01:30:07,581 --> 01:30:11,784
Yeah. She... She's fine, but...

898
01:30:11,853 --> 01:30:15,019
Look, I know... I know the cops here.
They're not gonna believe me.

899
01:30:15,091 --> 01:30:17,995
They're gonna take her,
so I didn't... I didn't know what to do.

900
01:30:18,059 --> 01:30:20,120
<i>James, you listen up.</i>

901
01:30:20,196 --> 01:30:23,464
<i>For the record, we never had
this conversation, all right?</i>

902
01:30:23,532 --> 01:30:25,798
Now, I can't promise you anything,

903
01:30:25,867 --> 01:30:28,168
but if you'll bring Tara back here
and turn yourself in,

904
01:30:28,236 --> 01:30:31,299
<i>I'll do my best for you.</i>

905
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:33,206
<i>All right?</i>

906
01:30:35,444 --> 01:30:38,177
Okay. What... What about Tara?

907
01:30:38,246 --> 01:30:40,809
<i>I'll get Joleen. Don't worry about it.</i>

908
01:30:43,351 --> 01:30:45,412
<i>James...</i>

909
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:46,979
Okay.

910
01:30:48,456 --> 01:30:49,948
Yeah.

911
01:31:06,107 --> 01:31:07,770
Hey.

912
01:31:10,713 --> 01:31:12,205
Hey.

913
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:21,282
Where are we going?

914
01:31:22,558 --> 01:31:25,793
You're goin' home, and to your mom.

915
01:31:26,797 --> 01:31:29,997
My mom? Where is she?

916
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:33,666
She's in Westmoreland,
waiting at the police station.

917
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:39,377
What's gonna happen to you?

918
01:31:40,444 --> 01:31:44,076
Can't be any worse
than it's been, you know?

919
01:31:47,818 --> 01:31:50,517
Before now,

920
01:31:50,587 --> 01:31:53,354
it's like I've been living in a dream.

921
01:31:55,392 --> 01:31:57,191
Bad dreams.

922
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:59,755
Sleepwalking.

923
01:32:01,332 --> 01:32:03,996
But you helped me.

924
01:32:04,068 --> 01:32:06,561
Woke me up.

925
01:32:06,637 --> 01:32:09,872
- I did?
- Yeah.

926
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,433
You did.

927
01:32:16,681 --> 01:32:19,152
Do me a favor.

928
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:22,077
Yeah. Sure.

929
01:32:22,154 --> 01:32:24,089
When you see her,

930
01:32:27,425 --> 01:32:28,757
tell her...

931
01:32:33,032 --> 01:32:34,625
tell her

932
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:39,301
"This is the first day of the rest of her life."

933
01:32:39,371 --> 01:32:43,311
Okay? It wasn't before, but now it is.

934
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:45,799
Okay.

935
01:32:49,114 --> 01:32:51,209
Why don't you tell her?

936
01:32:54,019 --> 01:32:57,186
This is one you tell, okay?

937
01:33:00,927 --> 01:33:02,760
All right.

938
01:33:07,733 --> 01:33:09,896
You know, you're not an idiot.

939
01:33:15,441 --> 01:33:18,471
You're not an idiot,
like he would always call you.

940
01:34:01,455 --> 01:34:03,823
Tara. Tara!

941
01:34:07,027 --> 01:34:10,158
- Oh, shit!
- James!

942
01:34:10,231 --> 01:34:12,668
Jesus Christ.

943
01:34:15,102 --> 01:34:17,073
Oh, God!

944
01:34:17,139 --> 01:34:19,701
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, baby.

945
01:34:19,773 --> 01:34:22,540
I'm so sorry!

946
01:34:22,611 --> 01:34:25,549
Oh, baby!

947
01:34:25,614 --> 01:34:28,847
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

948
01:34:28,916 --> 01:34:31,479
Tell me you're okay.
Tell me you're okay!

949
01:34:31,552 --> 01:34:34,217
- I'm okay.
- Yes? Where is James?

950
01:34:34,288 --> 01:34:35,655
Where is he?

951
01:34:35,724 --> 01:34:37,386
- Where is he?
- Gone.

952
01:34:37,459 --> 01:34:38,654
Oh, shit!

953
01:34:38,727 --> 01:34:41,597
Where is he, baby? Where did he go?

954
01:34:41,663 --> 01:34:44,601
- I don't know.
- Did he say anything?

955
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:48,070
Yeah. Yeah, he said, um...

956
01:34:48,136 --> 01:34:50,630
He said that...

957
01:34:51,873 --> 01:34:55,973
today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

958
01:34:56,078 --> 01:34:59,517
I repeat, all Westmoreland,
put a scan in the area for a blue Buick.

959
01:34:59,581 --> 01:35:03,419
- My life?
- Yeah, that's what he told me. Yeah.

960
