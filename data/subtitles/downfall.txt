DOWNFALL



I feel as if I should be angry
with that child, that...



naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...



for not recognising the
nature of that monster.



For not being aware of what
she was getting into.



And especially that I went
along without thinking.



Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said, in Berlin:



'No, I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters.'



But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.



I also didn't realise...



that destiny would take me somewhere
I didn't want to be.



But, nevertheless, I find it hard
to forgive myself.



The ladies are here.



It's confirmed.
-They can pass.



'Wolfsschanze'
headquarters of the Führer



November 1942
Rastenburg, East-Prussia



Sit down, ladies.



One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.



Can you tell us... How are we supposed
to address the Führer?



The Führer first speaks to you
and then you reply: Heil, mein Führer.



And the Nazi salute?



That won't be necessary...



since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier, but for a secretary.



Act as normal and relaxed
as you can.



I'll see if
if he has time for you.



Mein Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.



Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.



Sometimes, during a war,
one is not in control of time.



Can I ask your name?
-Margarethe Lorenz.



Where are you from?
-From Fulda.



And what is your name?
-Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Führer.



No need for that.
Where are you from?



Frankfurt am Main, mein Füh...



Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.



In Pankow, to be precise.



Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Schwaben.



And you are?
-Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.



A lady from Munich.



Shall we start then,
Fräulein Humps?



My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.



She's much smarter
than most people.



First, sit down, please.



Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.



You won't make nearly as many.



You're very young.



How old are you?
-22, mein Führer.



My German fellow-countrymen
and women...



...fellow party members.



It is, I think, rather special...



that, after 20 years of service, a man still
stands in front of his supporters...



...and that in all those 20 years, his program
never needed to be modified.



I suggest we try it again.



I did it.
He hired me.



Berlin - 20 April 1945
Hitler's 56th birthday



two and a half years later



Take cover.



Hurry. Continue.
Get that off the street.



Take cover.



That's artillery fire.



Don't be silly.
Where would it be coming from?



You're right. These are no planes,
this is artillery.



It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.



Where is that cannon fire coming from?



Happy Birthday,
mein Führer.



The city centre of Berlin
is under fire.



Grenades have hit near the Brandenburger
Tor and the Reichstag.



Where did they come from?
-We don't know yet.



I have Koller on the line.
-Give me Koller.



Koller, do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?



No.
-Can't you hear the shooting?



No, I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
-Berlin is chaotic.



Apparently, the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.



The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.



It's not long-range artillery.



The anti-aircraft defence near the Zoo-Bunker
reports they're 10 to 12...



... cm calibres. The Russians have
positions near Marzahn.



That's only 12 kilometres from the centre.
Are the Russians that close?



They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.



This is unheard-of.



The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.



Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.



Maybe it's long-range artillery,
after all.



That railway bridge over the Oder...
-Nonsense.



That Himmler,
such a pompous buffoon.



Party bosses, everywhere.
They make me so sick.



The Führer starts
'Clausewitz' today.



Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.



If the Führer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.



We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.



He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.



Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.



Talk to your sister-in-law, then.



Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.



We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.



You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.



Do you want to die here?
-Absolutely not.



Gentlemen, the Führer.



Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.



What's going on?
-We're leaving.



'Clausewitz' has started.



All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.



And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?



Don't ask me, professor.
-This is insane.



Professor.



I won't allow the
evacuation of my office.



Is that so?
-Food supply would collapse.



A good soldier can
always find food.



And when there's fighting all over the city,
where does he get it? The population.



It's irresponsible.
-It's an order from the Führer.



As department head, I
report to the SS and to Himmler.



But as a doctor, I'm part of the Wehrmacht
and they're not leaving yet.



Keep that in mind.



The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.



We're leaving.



Everything for Germany.
Heil, mein Führer.



Führer, I...
Heil, mein Führer.



They're in such a hurry
to get away from here.



The brown nosing is the worst.



They say 'Sieg Heil'. but they think
'Lick my... you know what.'



Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.



Too late?



Hewel, come here for a moment.



I'm sure you agree we should contact
the Allies...



...and start conducting politics.
-Certainly. We need politics.



Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.



I'm fed up with it.



When I'm dead, you'll have plenty
of time for politics.



It's good, dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.



It's good.
Just go.



He has no strength left.



What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?



Seriously, though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.



Berlin will fall in a couple of days.



When the Führer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?



Why do you think they'll
negotiate with you?



The Nazi state and my SS are needed
to maintain order.



One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.



The first contact has been made.
-Careful, that's high treason.



Fegelein, I have other concerns.



Should I give Eisenhower the Nazi salute
or shake his hand?



Look at that.



The best guests
always arrive late.



Leaving already, gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.



The scorched-earth order...
-I really have to go now.



Come and see me one day
in Hohenlychen.



I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.



You know, Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.



It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.



When the war will be over,
reconstruction will be quick.



We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.



You're a true genius, Speer.



Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know
that the Third Reich would be inconceivable...



...with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.



This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture...



...that will survive thousands of years.



We see, before us, the ancient cities,
the Acropolis...



We see the medieval cities...
the cathedrals...



...and we know that the people
need that.



Indeed, Speer.



That was my vision...



...and it still is.



Mein Führer, if you want to realize
these plans, you must leave Berlin.



Eva, you say something.



He's the Führer.
He knows what's best.



You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.



I can't do that, my child.



I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.



I have to solve the problem,
here in Berlin, or perish.



Speer...



...what do you think?



You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.



Reload.



Go away. Leave me alone.



How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?



Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.



Who are you? What do you want?
I want my son. Alive.



You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.



The Führer will decorate him
for it, today.



You're still young.
At which front did you fight?



I haven't had
the honour yet.



Count yourself lucky.
Send the children home.



We'll defend this position
to the last man.



Which position?
This is not a position, it's a trap.



The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.



We'll shoot back.
-What with?



With the anti-aircraft guns.



The Russians will arrive with several
armies, tanks and heavy artillery.



Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?



We promised the Führer.



Don't you understand?
The war is lost.



Coward.



Go away. Right now.



If you're still here when the Russians
arrive, you'll all be dead.



The 9th army had to retreat
or they would have been decimated...



We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.



Führer, then the 9th army is lost.



We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east...



...with a ruthless, mighty attack.



Using which units?



Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th army.



The 9th army is unable to move.



The enemy outnumbers us ten times.



Wenck's 12th army must
support them.



The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
-Then it must turn around.



Then the western front would be open.
-Do you doubt my orders?



I think I've been
clear enough.



The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.



We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.



Mohnke, you're here.
-Mein Führer.



Today, 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.



You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.



We'll fight until the last man, in Berlin.



There are still three million civilians here.
They have to be evacuated.



I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.



We can't spend any energy
on so-called civilians.



With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children...



...and the thousands of wounded
and elderly?



In a war such as this one,
there are no civilians.



The Führer has lost all
sense of reality.



He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.



Gruppe Steiner has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.



But why don't you tell him that?
-He doesn't listen to reason.



Something has to happen.
-Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.



We're soldiers.
We took an oath.



Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?



And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?



I beg your pardon?



Where were you?
-None of your business.



The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.



I'm proud of you.



This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.



His name is Peter Kranz.
-So you're Peter.



I wish my generals were
as brave as you.



Very good.



You've made history.



And when Germania will rise
from these ruins...



...you will be the heroes.



Heil, to you.



I don't know about you,
but I prefer air raids.



What will happen to us?
-I could go if I wanted to.



But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go, can we?



I can't go either.



I wouldn't know
where to go.



My parents and all
my friends warned me.



Don't get involved with the Nazis.



What should I say:
'Hello, I made a mistake'?



'When things went wrong,
I admitted my mistake.'



Life will go on.



What do you think, Herr Oberst?
-We have to go.



Go where?
-I don't know.



Wherever they need us.



Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.



Come on.



Come, children.



We should have fun today.



Wherever the enemy goes,
all they find is destruction.



That's the death sentence
for the German people.



No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no traffic.



If you destroy everything, our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.



This order denies the people
any chance of survival.



If the war is lost, what does it matter
that the people are lost too?



The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant, right now.



On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.



Our people turned out weak...



...and according to the laws of nature,
they should die out.



They're your people.
You're their Führer.



What remains after this battle...



...is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.



Come along. You have to dance.



Care to dance, Fräulein Braun?
-I'd love to.



May I?
-Go ahead.



What's wrong?



We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.



Or else, come with me.



You'll die.



Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.



Dance.



Do you have a request?
-As long as it swings.



Traudl.



It's all so unreal.



It's like a dream you
can't get out of.



It keeps on going.



Gerda, I don't feel well.



Traudl, come.



I did not move...



I did not move
my command post.



To the west? How so?



I'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.
-General.



And, general?



I'll be executed.
-What? Why?



They think I moved my
command post to the west.



Be sensible, general.
-Come along.



Schenck.
-Mohnke.



I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.



I need help.
-That will be difficult. Everything's gone.



My assistant and I are
the only ones here.



You're a doctor, aren't you?
-Yes, an internist.



Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication...



...you can find, to me.



I'll do my best.
-Thanks. Hurry.



I need to talk to the Führer.



What about?
-I'm going to be executed.



Wait here.



Your weapon, please.



Not here.



Guard post 2.
Understood.



General...



Not you.



What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?



You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.



Officers who don't obey,
must be executed.



What do you mean?
My troops have been fighting for days.



My command post
is a kilometre away from the front line.



Continue.



Do you see this? I don't want you
to use that tone with me.



And now, do whatever
you feel you must.



It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.



You can't pass, Oberst.
-Orders from brigade führer Mohnke:



I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.



There's nobody left.
They all took off.



And the wounded?
-How should I know?



I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.



Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.



See that? That's where the
Reich ends. Behind it, is Russkie land.



May I?



He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?



I should have been back by now.
Are you sure the Führer still needs me?



Drink.
-Führer's orders.



You made a big impression
on the Führer.



But you don't think Steiner
will attack, do you?



I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...



...but you probably know that
better than I do.



If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin is lost.



The Führer was impressed
with your report.



He puts you in command of
the defence of Berlin.



I'd have preferred it
if he executed me.



Let them get closer.



Tank alert.



Take it easy. Wait, kid.
They're still too far.



Is it German artillery that I hear?
-I'm afraid not.



But hasn't Steiner's
attack started?



You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.



But the Führer has
the situation under control.



Steiner will make
all the difference.



He says it will change
military history.



Everybody, but the Führer, knows
that's a fantasy.



I even wonder if he believes it himself.
-Why would he be playing games?



What does he have to lose?



I don't believe a word of it.



The enemy made a breakthrough.



They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.



They're at the northern city border,
between Frohnau and Pankow.



In the east, they reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.



If Steiner attacks,
everything will be alright.



Mein Führer...



Steiner...



Steiner didn't have enough force.



The attack didn't take place.



The following stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.



That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.



How dare you
ignore my orders?



Is this what it came to?



The military, everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.



The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.



I don't allow that...



Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
-Führer, this is outrageous.



The generals are the scum
of the German people.



No sense of honour.



You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy...



...where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.



For years, the military
obstructed me.



All you ever did is
thwart me.



I should have had...



...all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.



I never went to the academy.



But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.



Traitors.



I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.



Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.



But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.



They will drown
in their own blood.



Relax, Gerda.



All my orders have
been ignored.



How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?



It's over.



The war is lost.



But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin...



...you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.



Do what you want.



The Führer wasn't serious about
killing himself, was he?



Frau Junge, Frau Christian.



Get changed. In one hour,
a plane will take you south.



Everything is lost.



Completely lost.



You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.



I'm staying too, mein Führer.



Now what?



Time to end this charade.



Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.



The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.



But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.



Nobody can replace him.
He's the Führer.



The Führer's confused.
He'll recover.



Great.
And then what?



No capitulation. That was
never his intention.



We owe it to him.
-Hollow phrases.



We have to act now.
Or it will be too late.



You're only looking after yourself.
-Mind your words.



Damn.



We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.



We've got to wait.



Even the Führer doesn't believe in it
anymore. What will happen to us?



Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.



Why did you say
you wanted to stay with him?



I don't know.
Honestly.



It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.



Traudl.



Look here.



I'm lighting another one.



Let's go down again.



Where do they come from?
-Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.



They have to get
out of the field of fire.



The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.



I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.



I'll take the responsibility.



I think this is wrong.
-Great.



Stop. Lights out.



Stop. Stay where you are.



Stay where you are.
-Alright, Germans.



Help. They want to kill us.
-What is all this?



A Greifkommando.
-You're kidding.



Stop it.
Let those men go.



What's this?
You have no authority here.



These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.



They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.



Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?



Stop it. That's enough.



Dismissed.



This man's a doctor.



Can you operate?
-Not really.



Don't let the children
take too many toys.



And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.



Herr Minister...
-Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.



Can you look after them for a moment?
Thank you.



Brigade führer, what can I do for you?



Your Volkssturm is an easy prey
for the Russians.



They have neither combat experience
nor good weapons.



Their unconditional belief
in the final victory makes up for that.



Herr Minister, without weapons
these men can't fight.



Their deaths will be pointless.



I don't pity them.



I repeat:
I don't pity them.



The people called this
upon themselves.



This may come as a surprise to you.
Don't fool yourself.



We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.



And now they're paying for it.



Eva, you have to leave the Führer.



Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.



How can you say that?
Where are you?



I decided
not to die in Berlin.



Does my sister know where you are?
-Think about it. I'll call you back.



Children, your room is to the right.



Wait for me.



Hello, Frau Goebbels.
-Good to see you, Frau Junge.



Line up, children.



Helga, come. Line up.



Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.



Do you remember the song?



The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.



You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.



I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.



If I have to die,
at least without any pain.



That's definitely painless.



It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.



A matter of seconds.



Can I have one too?
-Me too.



Himmler provided me well.



Thank you.



I would have liked to give you
a nicer present.



Berlin, 23 April 1945.



Dear sister. I'm sorry
to write you this.



But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.



First of all: Hermann isn't with us.



But I'm sure
you'll see him again.



He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.



The Führer lost all hope
of a good outcome.



Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.



Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.



I stayed with daddy
against his will.



Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me escape.



But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.



I won't even think about it.
Our ideology's going down the drain...



...and with it, everything that made life
beautiful and worthwhile.



After the Führer and National Socialism,
there's nothing left to live for.



That's why I brought
the children too.



They're too good for the life
that awaits them.



God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.



I'll wear my bracelet with the green
stone until the very end.



After that, I want
you to always wear it.



Unfortunately, my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.



I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.



I want you to get it.



You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.



A birthday present
from the Führer.



I owe some money
to the Heise company.



There may be more debts, but
no more than 1500 Reichsmarks.



All correspondence with
the Führer must be burnt.



I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.



The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for daddy, the chocolate for mummy.



I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.



Dear sister, I wish
you lots of happiness.



And remember,
you will see Hermann again.



The warmest regards
and a kiss from...



...your sister.



Inge.



Listen, Keitel.
I want you to leave this evening.



Go to Dönitz and help him
with the organisation.



Things have to be
started up again.



I don't understand you.



We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.



It makes any serious operation
impossible.



When everything has been solved
here, we must get the oil fields back.



Any questions?
-No, mein Führer.



Good.
Have a good trip.



...do you agree that I take charge...



...with complete freedom of action?



If I receive no reply
by 2200 hours...



...I'll assume you have
been incapacitated.



I will then act on behalf
of the country and the motherland.



That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.



Göring's concerns are not
entirely unjustified.



If our communication
system fails...



...we'll be cut off
from the outside world.



We won't be able
to issue orders anymore.



I think Göring wants to
seize the power.



I never trusted his clique
on the Obersalzberg.



This looks like a coup.



The loser, the sponger.



A parvenu, a lazy bastard.



How dare he say
I'm incapacitated?



Hello.
-How did you get into Berlin?



It wasn't easy,
but I must speak to the Führer.



If I were you,
I'd wait a bit.



The Luftwaffe.
What did he turn that into?



For that alone,
he should be executed.



This morphine addict
corrupted the country.



And now this.



He's betraying me.



Me of all people.



I want Göring stripped
of his power, right away.



And, in case I don't
survive the war...



...he must be
executed immediately.



What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?



Frau Junge, leave from
here before it's too late.



The Führer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind, can we?



He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.



But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.



But the children...



I have always believed...



...that there was a way out.



Come in.



Albert. Hello.



You have a fever.



Albert, I can't stand
it anymore.



Why don't you leave with
the children, Magda?



Leave?
And go where?



I can arrange for you to be
taken to Schwanenwerder by barge.



You can hide
until everything's over.



It won't be long now anyway.



I thought about it.



My children cannot grow up
in a world without National Socialism.



Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.



If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.



I can't believe
you really want that.



Go now.



Come in.



I knew you'd come.



You wouldn't desert
the Führer.



I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.



Of course, you must go.
Sit down.



I took some furniture
you designed.



I couldn't leave it behind.



Please, you must
not have eaten all day.



That's true.



It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.



Did he ever doubt that?



Lately, he often thought
you were against him too.



I always said you'd come
and here you are.



I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.



I also think it's best.



And, you know...



...it may sound strange...



...but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.



You came.
-Mein Führer, I...



It's good.



Let's sit down.



I had great plans
for the Germans and the world.



Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.



The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.



Too late.



I can only be proud for openly
fighting the Jews...



...and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.



I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment...



...and then eternal peace.



But please spare the people,
mein Führer.



If my people cannot endure
this ordeal...



...I won't shed a tear.



They get what they deserve.



They called this fate
upon themselves.



For months...



...I have to tell you this...



...for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.



I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.



I had to tell you.



This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.



So you're leaving.



Good.



Goodbye.



I wish you all the best.



Eat well, gentlemen.



Peter.



It's alright, son.



He has a fever.



Yes, but he's alive.



Loyalty and courage
still exist in this world.



Ritter von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch, how good...



...that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.



Sit down.



We came under heavy fire, but
still arrived in Gatow.



From there,
we couldn't continue.



We flew in a Fieseler Storch,
over the Russian lines...



...and landed on the
East-West axis, close to here.



Before landing, the Soviets
had a go at us.



General Von Greim, I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.



I hereby promote you
to General-Feldmarschall.



A big responsibility
rests on your shoulders.



You have to rebuild the
Luftwaffe from scratch.



Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.



Life doesn't forgive weakness.



This so-called humanity
is religious drivel.



Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...



...is a betrayal of nature.



The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.



Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.



Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.



I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...



...opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.



Apes, for instance,...



...kill all the odd ones.



And what applies to apes,
must definitely apply to humans.



Himmler made an offer to surrender...



...to the allied powers.



Via Count Bernadotte.
