00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:09,205
Three cheers for Freakazoid.

3
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:12,615
<i>Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!</i>

4
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:15,779
<i>Hip hip hooray!</i>

5
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:19,519
Thanks, Freakazoid.

6
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:22,254
You saved the lives
of everyone in the city.

7
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,456
As well as the entire free world.

8
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:27,692
And on behalf of the United Kingdom...

9
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:32,465
...I want to personally thank you,
Freakazoid, in a very personal way...

10
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,801
...if you catch my drift.

11
00:43:34,976 --> 00:43:38,377
Yeah, well, cool your jets, princess,
and wait your turn.

12
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:41,014
- He's taken.
- Sharon.

13
00:43:41,182 --> 00:43:42,240
Why, you tramp.

14
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,749
Who you calling a tramp,
you stuck up little...?

15
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:46,887
How dare you.

16
00:43:47,055 --> 00:43:50,183
Come on, yeah. Right now.
Dl: I'm not afraid of you. How dare you?

17
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:51,518
Ow!

18
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:54,423
Dl: I am not accustomed to your style
nor your manner.

19
00:43:54,596 --> 00:43:58,191
Now, ladies, ladies, calm down.
There is plenty of me for everybody.

20
00:43:58,366 --> 00:44:00,561
If not, I'll just have them
draw me bigger.

21
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,735
This was without a doubt
the most exciting Freakavoid...

22
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:16,583
Let me try this again.

23
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:22,017
Take two.

24
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,623
This was without a doubt...

25
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:27,591
...the most exciting
Freakazoid adventure of all time.

26
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:30,697
Hey, kids, sorry you missed it,
but I got started early today.

27
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:32,293
But tell me, Freakazoid...

28
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:36,233
...how did you know how to deactivate
this 800-megaton nuclear warhead?

29
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:38,599
Simple. I read the instruction manual.

30
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:42,231
See? You just raise the plunger
to deactivate the warhead...

31
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:45,072
...and you push the plunger
to reactivate it.

32
00:44:47,448 --> 00:44:51,111
Ooh, boy. That was about as stupid
as me raising taxes.

33
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:54,584
Allow me to be the first one to say "ouch. "

34
00:45:00,628 --> 00:45:02,152
Mm. Hello, kiddies.

35
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,161
I'm the network censor...

36
00:45:04,332 --> 00:45:08,098
...and I just want to assure
our young viewers out there...

37
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:11,636
...that no one was hurt
in the previous scene.

38
00:45:11,806 --> 00:45:15,708
Everyone is okay.

39
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:21,038
Including me.

40
00:45:25,053 --> 00:45:26,384
Oof!

41
00:46:57,278 --> 00:47:00,441
The aliens may bring to us
the wisdom of the universe.

42
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,782
If not, we'll blast them.

43
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:16,958
I am Mo-Ron.

44
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:21,067
I come with a important message...

45
00:47:21,235 --> 00:47:23,965
...for all mankind.

46
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:29,200
And what is that message?

47
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:39,647
I am Mo-Ron.

48
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:45,324
Do you come in peace or war?

49
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:47,324
Ooh!

50
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:49,486
Muh...

51
00:47:57,972 --> 00:48:00,497
I am Mo-Ron.

52
00:48:04,212 --> 00:48:06,578
What is your purpose here?

53
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,054
Oh!

54
00:48:24,232 --> 00:48:26,792
I am Mo-Ron.

55
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:30,031
Blast him.

56
00:48:30,204 --> 00:48:31,296
Uh, let me try something.

57
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:34,407
Tell us, what is two plus two?

58
00:48:43,918 --> 00:48:45,783
Twenty-two.

59
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:49,622
I am Mo-Ron.

60
00:48:51,926 --> 00:48:54,121
We can pretty much rule out
the wisdom of the universe.

61
00:48:54,295 --> 00:48:56,286
Then let's blast him.

62
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:21,784
Twenty-three?

63
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:30,786
Mm. Hello again. I'm the network censor.

64
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:34,093
And before I was so rudely interrupted...

65
00:49:34,268 --> 00:49:39,228
...I just wanted to say that no one was hurt
in the previous scene.

66
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,741
Oh.

67
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,411
Ugh!

68
00:49:57,725 --> 00:50:01,684
<i>He feels no pain
He can fly quite fast</i>

69
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:04,262
<i>In feats of strength
He is unsurpassed</i>

70
00:50:04,432 --> 00:50:06,423
<i>His grip is firm
Never quavery</i>

71
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,625
<i>Britannia's superhero
He's Lord Bravery</i>

72
00:50:08,803 --> 00:50:13,069
<i>Lord Bravery, Lord Bravery</i>

73
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,439
<i>Lord Bravery</i>

74
00:50:24,618 --> 00:50:27,553
Oh, let's just get on with it.

75
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:41,964
Nigel, the tea's ready.

76
00:50:43,471 --> 00:50:45,166
Nigel, the tea.

77
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:49,767
- Nigel.
- Ouch!

78
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:53,506
I thought he was impervious to pain.

79
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:54,807
I am impervious to...

80
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:58,748
Do I take it the ficus hurled at my head
was meant as some sort of signal?

81
00:50:58,919 --> 00:51:01,683
- The tea's ready.
- Then get it.

82
00:51:01,856 --> 00:51:04,120
Well, you are up, darling.

83
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:07,283
Oh, yes, let me get the tea.

84
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:10,658
I'd hate to see either of you actually
have to walk the 3 feet...

85
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:14,130
...into this frightening,
mysterious new world we call a kitchen.

86
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:16,735
You might get lost
or attacked by the dishwasher.

87
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:19,301
Your tea.

88
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:23,305
You forgot the sugar.

89
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:26,969
Most people your age die.
Why won't you?

90
00:51:27,148 --> 00:51:29,514
There's no need to be rude, Nigel.

91
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:31,810
Not being rude, darling.
Merely a suggestion.

92
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:34,477
Why doesn't he get a job?

93
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:36,816
This is my job, you old bat.

94
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:39,118
If I don't monitor
the emergency frequencies...

95
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:40,920
...I won't know who needs rescuing.

96
00:51:41,095 --> 00:51:42,926
Mother does have a point, Nigel.

97
00:51:43,097 --> 00:51:45,895
This superhero business
doesn't seem to be paying off.

98
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:47,864
Well, not yet, but it will.

99
00:51:48,035 --> 00:51:50,128
You think Superman
started right at the top?

100
00:51:50,304 --> 00:51:51,566
Yes.

101
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:54,071
Well, yes, he did, he did,
but not the others.

102
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:56,903
It takes years to establish yourself
as a superhero.

103
00:51:57,078 --> 00:51:59,842
All the same, a little less time
listening to your radios...

104
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:02,915
...and more time spent rescuing people
might be better.

105
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:04,574
Well, what do you expect me to do...

106
00:52:04,752 --> 00:52:07,585
...just fly around all day
looking for people to save?

107
00:52:07,755 --> 00:52:10,223
Good idea.
And get some milk while you're at it.

108
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:11,585
And some sugar.

109
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:13,954
Oh, and, Nigel,
some chickpeas for the salad.

110
00:52:14,128 --> 00:52:15,755
And bouillon cubes.

111
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,262
Yes, Mother needs her bouillon cubes.

112
00:52:18,432 --> 00:52:21,424
And some sticky buns.
Don't forget the sticky buns.

113
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:28,369
"Don't forget the sticky buns. "

114
00:52:37,885 --> 00:52:39,409
Help!

115
00:52:39,587 --> 00:52:40,918
Ah!

116
00:52:41,956 --> 00:52:43,787
Help!

117
00:52:44,592 --> 00:52:46,457
Help!

118
00:52:46,627 --> 00:52:47,958
It's all right, my good man.

119
00:52:48,129 --> 00:52:51,621
Fear not, Lord Bravery has arrived.

120
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:55,267
Young boy, right, okay, right.
Here's a video camera.

121
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:58,963
Be a good lad and get a few shots of me
rescuing the man from that hole, all right?

122
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,337
A nice wide shot, not too much headroom
and a nice background...

123
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,273
Help!

124
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:07,642
Yes, yes, we have heard you.
We're not deaf, you know.

125
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:09,840
What was I saying?
Yes, uh, not too much headroom...

126
00:53:10,017 --> 00:53:12,713
...and try to keep the camera
from shaking, okay?

127
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:19,019
Ready?

128
00:53:20,094 --> 00:53:22,255
I'll find you, you little...

129
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:24,693
- Help!
- Would you stop yelling?

130
00:53:24,865 --> 00:53:27,095
Sorry.

131
00:53:28,402 --> 00:53:30,267
All right, all right. What's the problem?

132
00:53:30,437 --> 00:53:34,635
I fell in this hole. I'm trapped.

133
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:36,571
Fine, hold on. I'll come and get you.

134
00:53:37,945 --> 00:53:41,574
- What's that smell?
- I think I fell in the sewer.

135
00:53:41,749 --> 00:53:45,082
The sew...? Oh! Well, can't you climb out?

136
00:53:45,252 --> 00:53:49,245
If I could climb out,
I wouldn't be yelling "help," now, would I?

137
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:52,415
Well, you could have at least yelled,
"Help, I'm trapped in a sewer. "

138
00:53:52,593 --> 00:53:55,426
- What would that have done?
- Saved me a trip.

139
00:53:55,596 --> 00:53:57,757
Do you think you could get me Superman?

140
00:53:58,098 --> 00:54:00,225
Oh, Superman?
What do you need with him?

141
00:54:00,401 --> 00:54:01,925
I'm a superhero, aren't I?

142
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:04,093
I don't know. Are you?

143
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:05,295
Yes, I told you.

144
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:09,033
I said,
"Fear not, Lord Bravery has arrived. "

145
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,701
Oh, I thought that was a joke.

146
00:54:11,879 --> 00:54:12,937
A joke?

147
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:17,641
Yeah, you know, to keep me
from focusing on my horrible pain.

148
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:21,413
- Yes, well, it's not a joke.
- Good, because it didn't work.

149
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,217
Look, I'm going to throw a rope
down to you.

150
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:28,225
A rope?
I thought you were gonna come get me.

151
00:54:28,395 --> 00:54:29,726
From the sewer?

152
00:54:29,897 --> 00:54:31,159
Superman would do it.

153
00:54:31,332 --> 00:54:33,800
Well, he's not here.

154
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:35,230
Could you go get him?

155
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,802
Look, just grab onto the rope
and I'll pull you up.

156
00:54:37,972 --> 00:54:41,567
Or maybe you could get
those turtle fellows with the bandannas.

157
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:45,075
I don't think they'd mind
the stench down here too much.

158
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:47,840
In fact, I think they'd rather like it.

159
00:54:48,015 --> 00:54:50,745
You are a remarkable twit.
Do you know that?

160
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:54,046
In fact, I think those turtles
live in the sewers.

161
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:57,952
Listen, would you please stop talking
and just grab onto the rope, all right?

162
00:54:58,125 --> 00:54:59,149
Whoa!

163
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:05,629
Do you want to call for Superman
or should I?

164
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:07,892
Oh, fine.

165
00:55:16,977 --> 00:55:19,468
<i>We interrupt
our regularly scheduled program...</i>

166
00:55:19,647 --> 00:55:23,276
<i>...to bring you this special report
from The WB Network.</i>

167
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,418
What exactly is The WB?

168
00:55:25,586 --> 00:55:28,248
Can someone tell me this?
What's it mean, "The WB"?

169
00:55:28,422 --> 00:55:30,253
The water bucket? The wimpy boy?

170
00:55:30,424 --> 00:55:32,085
The wet bananas? I don't know what.

171
00:55:32,259 --> 00:55:35,387
The weird butt? What? I'm asking.

172
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:40,262
<i>This has been a special report
from the Weird Butt Network.</i>

173
00:55:40,434 --> 00:55:44,165
<i>We now join Freakazoid,
already in progress.</i>

174
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:04,051
That's Uranus.

175
00:56:42,363 --> 00:56:45,355
Greetings, inhabitants of planet Earth.

176
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:46,931
Uh, greetings.

177
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:52,733
I have traveled many millions of light-years
across 40 billion galaxies to come here...

178
00:56:52,906 --> 00:56:58,037
...for the answer to a vital question
that concerns the entire universe.

179
00:56:58,212 --> 00:56:59,543
And what is that question?

180
00:56:59,713 --> 00:57:01,271
Please tell us:

181
00:57:01,448 --> 00:57:05,384
That doll, Barbie,
what's the name of her little sister?

182
00:57:07,254 --> 00:57:09,347
Hey, all I can think of is Pebbles.

183
00:57:09,523 --> 00:57:10,820
Let me handle this.

184
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,322
It's Skipper.

185
00:57:12,493 --> 00:57:14,154
Skipper.

186
00:57:14,595 --> 00:57:15,926
Huh.

187
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:20,198
Hey, everyone, it's Skipper.

188
00:57:28,308 --> 00:57:30,367
I am Mo-Ron.

189
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:32,808
Now, knock that off.

190
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,717
Oh, now I've hurt his feelings.
Hey, I'm sorry.

191
00:57:50,197 --> 00:57:52,427
Mo-Ron forgive.

192
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:54,590
Lucky me.

193
00:57:57,971 --> 00:57:59,302
<i>And now...</i>

194
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,921
<i>This concludes our musical interlude.</i>

195
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:28,226
<i>We now return to our program.</i>

196
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:41,675
<i>And now...</i>

197
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:48,344
<i>Candid conversations
with the superheroes of yesteryear.</i>

198
00:58:54,194 --> 00:58:58,426
Aquaman is staring at Zippy's food,
so Zippy the fast boy says:

199
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:00,760
"Hey, I'm having the shrimp scampi here. "

200
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:03,869
And Aquaman says,
"That ain't no shrimp scampi.

201
00:59:04,037 --> 00:59:06,562
That's my Uncle Leo. "

202
00:59:15,749 --> 00:59:18,843
I was with Aquaman
outside Sy's Clam Bar once...

203
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:20,953
...when we ran into the Green Fog.

204
00:59:21,121 --> 00:59:22,554
Oy, what a stink.

205
00:59:22,723 --> 00:59:24,486
The Green Fog? Piffle.

206
00:59:24,658 --> 00:59:26,455
Like lilacs in springtime.

207
00:59:26,627 --> 00:59:30,222
You want to fight a stench,
try doing battle with the Brown Fog.

208
00:59:30,397 --> 00:59:33,924
Now, that was a smelly fog.
He'd creep up on you too.

209
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:36,831
You'd be standing there,
minding your own business...

210
00:59:37,004 --> 00:59:38,995
...then out from nowhere, a smell...

211
00:59:39,172 --> 00:59:42,573
...oy, like something crawled
under the porch and died.

212
00:59:42,743 --> 00:59:46,907
And there he is, the Brown Fog,
choking you, your eyes burning.

213
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,071
I thought I was gonna die.

214
00:59:49,249 --> 00:59:51,513
- Well, what'd you do?
- What could I do?

215
00:59:51,685 --> 00:59:54,017
I lit a match, he blew up. End of story.

216
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:08,695
Hey, blue boy,
did you check the pastrami?

217
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:11,167
How do know
it ain't got a bomb in it, huh?

218
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:14,034
I have many enemies.
Get it away from me.

219
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,538
Yes, sir.

220
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:18,041
Hurry, it's gonna blow.

221
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:19,701
"I lit a match. "

222
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:48,103
Thank you. Thank you so much.

223
01:00:49,076 --> 01:00:50,100
Well, that's our show.

224
01:00:50,277 --> 01:00:52,711
I hope you had as much fun watching it
as we had making it.

225
01:00:52,879 --> 01:00:55,074
You're not the boss of me. I'll make you...

226
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:58,979
I've a parking space. I'll show you.
I own everything in the world.

227
01:00:59,152 --> 01:01:02,588
I've got my own parking space,
you do not. I drive your car.

228
01:01:02,756 --> 01:01:03,984
Ahh, come to think of it...

229
01:01:04,157 --> 01:01:06,717
...I hope you had more fun watching it
than we had making it.

230
01:01:06,893 --> 01:01:09,054
So till next time.

231
01:01:17,938 --> 01:01:19,530
Hmm...

232
01:01:19,706 --> 01:01:21,105
Hmm...

233
01:01:21,274 --> 01:01:22,366
Hmm...

234
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:24,942
I am Mo-Ron.

235
01:01:25,112 --> 01:01:27,273
You're still here, huh?

236
01:01:27,447 --> 01:01:31,941
I come with a important message...

237
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:34,451
...for all mankind.

238
01:01:34,621 --> 01:01:36,350
Yeah, so we've heard. Wonderful.

239
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:41,192
Me remember message.

240
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:44,387
Could it be, "I am Mo-Ron"?

241
01:01:44,564 --> 01:01:47,556
No, it is, uh, um...

242
01:01:48,201 --> 01:01:52,467
A giant comet heading to Earth.

243
01:01:56,777 --> 01:01:58,711
Now he tells us.

244
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:05,574
All right, folks.
That's all we have time for today.

245
01:02:05,752 --> 01:02:09,916
We have to run.
So next time, don't forget to freak out.

246
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:36,681
Mm. Hello...

247
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,514
I quit.

248
01:02:46,426 --> 01:02:48,587
<i>Out here...</i>

249
01:02:49,696 --> 01:02:53,029
<i>...we're on vacation.</i>

250
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:58,832
<i>We have left work behind.</i>

251
01:02:59,172 --> 01:03:02,767
<i>That's why we don't have any clips
to show...</i>

252
01:03:02,943 --> 01:03:07,403
<i>...from the next episode of Freakazoid.</i>

253
01:03:08,615 --> 01:03:11,311
<i>We'd better get to work.</i>

254
01:03:13,153 --> 01:03:15,314
<i>So fade out already.</i>

255
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:43,381
Say, here's a sound
you don't wanna hear at 3 a. M:
