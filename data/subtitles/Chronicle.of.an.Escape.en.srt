Since he moved in

He moved out months ago,

27
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,979

No, no.

32
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,034
Saying we screwed up?

33

No. l'm just saying
he is a normal person.

34
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,074
They're killers!
They murder children!

Stop lying!
Your son is dangerous.

36
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,046
Aterrorist!

37
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:05,006
- You keep arms here?
- Arms? No.

38
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,951

Nice house!
They're loaded.

44
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,008
They didn't check here.

45
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,019

You need Ariel with you,

50
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,459
and Guille on the left wing.

51
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,257
When you learn to pass the ball,

52
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,026
that's when you'll start scoring.

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,931
You know what?

54
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,835
We're arguing all the time
to see who's in control.

55
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,462
lt's no good for anybody.

56

We're not team players.

That's the problem.

Move it!

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,942
You lied! Why did you tell me
there were no arms?

60
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,001
There aren't any arms!

61
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,914
Then what's this?

63
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,987

72
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:10,934
Thanks.

77
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,506
Don't waste my time.

Take him.

00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,917
Tell the cops to clear the area.

Move the truck.

What's the matter?

You're with them,
and you're planning an attack.

00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,971

00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,027
Tell them you're in the movement.

206
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,973

The asshole hit me!

Enough!

214
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,009
Enough.

215
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,981

Come on, champ!

221
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,035
Got to treat 'em nice.

222
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,039
Leave him to me.

223
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,035
Nice friend, kid.
He was more scared than you.

224
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,050
Another go, Tano?

225
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,075
l've done nothing, sir.

226
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,046
Then you'll be out by Christmas.

227
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,924
Can l go home, sir?

228
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,964
ln 20 days, ready for Christmas.

229
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,999
Hallowed be Thy name.

00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,933
Thy kingdom come,

231
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,972
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in Heaven.

232
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,975
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive our trespasses...

233
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,978
as we forgive those
who trespass against us...

234
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,049
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

Shut up, man.

241

Don't let rage win you over.

242
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,078
You must pass these tests.

243
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,017
Fuck off, you and Jesus Christ!

244
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,977
Do you know what day it is?

245
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,023
- Wednesday, sir.
- Get ready.

246
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,025
Let's go, Marito.

247

Everybody kneel straight!

Prayer positions!

249
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,981
Hallowed be Thy name.

...Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

254
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:48,032
Louder!
God can't hear you!

255
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,001
Give us this day our daily bread...

256
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:56,029
and forgive our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us...

257
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,077
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

258
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,981
You'll all talk!

259
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,987
Bunch of faggots!

Time to go home?

No, idiot!
Say we're good people.

00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,990
You're good people.

But l can go barefoot.

And say we mistreated you?

289
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,281
We have to do things right.

290
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,949
lt's the only way.

291
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,997

lt'll get tough.

297
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,555
You almost managed to trick me.

298
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,589
Walk!

299
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,667
Hello, girls. Get up.

00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:15,695
Take your blindfold off.

301
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:25,707
Open your eyes, moron.

The party's over.

This is your new roommate, girls.

311
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,720
Treat her nice.

312
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,722
Especially you, Tano.

Merry Christmas.

314
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,634
Shut up!

315
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,604
Shut up.

316
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:29,662
This piece of shit gave me up!

317
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,677
They'll beat us all.
Sort it out quietly.

318
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,179
Quiet. Ok?

319
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,705
Ok. Let go.
You too, Tano. Quiet.

320
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,312
Keep your mouth shut, ok?

321
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,236
They found your number
in my address book.

322
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,670
Why did you make up
the mimeograph story?

323
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,145
They beat me up really bad.

324
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,614
Did all sort of things.

325
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,647
Claudio... l had no choice.

326
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,659
Why choose me?

327
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:27,654
l needed time.
Do you understand?

328
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:34,695
l needed time for
my comrades to get away.

329
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,575
So you'll have a revolution...

330
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,670
by betraying those
who have done nothing?

331
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,679
Claudio...

332
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,707
when they see you're not involved,

333
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,686
they'll let you go.

334
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,714
You just have to hang in
there a bit longer.

335
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,717
Tano...

336
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,700
they won't let me go.

337
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,696
You've killed me, Tano.

338
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,429

We take you out
and we bring you back.

Obey us, you'll be ok.

Don't make life complicated.

347
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,738
And we share the housework.

348
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,742
- Questions?
No, sir.

349
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,376

At least a spoon, sir.

354
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,702
<i>Wh</i>at's wrong with you?

355
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,751
You need a spoon, asshole?

356
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:37,710
They'll batter us.

357
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,724
Think this is a hotel?

358
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,718
Don't make demands here.

359
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:47,747
Vasco!

360
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,457
Not eating?

361
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,641
You want his food?

362
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,644
The guard will take it.

363
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:13,649
lf he won't eat,
we'll take his.

364
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,708
Let him starve.

365
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,657
Then it's my turn,
then his...

366
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,660
That it, Gallego?

367
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,733
Come on.
<i>Wh</i>at a welcome!

368
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,724
The German's here!

369
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,707
Everybody look down.
Eyes on the floor!

370
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,743
You have visitors.

371
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,670
Tomorrow we'll come for you.
Think what to say.

372
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:48,718
Do you understand?

373
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:54,680
- Can l go to the toilet?
- Don't be so blunt, you shit!

374
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,642
Jorge...

375
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,700
Take off your blindfold.
They're gone.

376
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,650
You're an asshole, Tano.

377
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,658
Why didn't you give up your comrades?
Motherfucker.

378
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,696
Take him to the bathroom, Almagro.

379
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,700
Yes, sir.
Can l take off my blindfold?

380
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,673
- Where?
- Right there.

381
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,683
So Tano knows you too?

382
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:59,712
Yes, but he says anything.
He's fried.

383
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,651
He told them about papers
he ordered from me.

384
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,654
l printed them,
and they caught me.

385
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,690
You're the mimeograph guy!

386
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,661
They have to let me go.

387
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,709
- They'll let me go.
- Me too.

388
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,644
Tano's the one who's staying.

389
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,716
l told them
you're not involved in it.

390
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,652
lt's all clear now.

391
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,711
They need you to give
them names.

392
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,691
Something.

393
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,661
But l have nothing to give them.

394
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,690
They don't buy it.
You must give them someone.

395
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,706
Don't you know anybody?

396
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,677
Someone from school...
someone really involved.

397
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,680
l don't know anyone
from school.

398
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:02,653
And in here?

399
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,681
You need to wake up.

400
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,684
Start looking around you.

401
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,630
Listen out.

402
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,700
Besides, it's not us.

403
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,657
lt's the revolutionaries.

404
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,695
lt's them they're after.

405
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,301
DAY 72

406
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,668
You're going to prison, Tano.

407
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,706
- l'm leaving?
- Yes, put your shoes on.

408
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,733
Easy, Tano. There's no rush.

409
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,978
This is the first case we've solved.

410
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,609
ln a few days the situation
will be clarified for you all.

411
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:15,681
Let's go, Tano.

412
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,669
But you must continue
to help us.

413
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:37,646
For some of you
we don't have enough.

414
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,621
You know what we want.

415
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,715
lnformations: names,
addresses, phone numbers.

416
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,631
They took him to prison.
Good.

417
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,647
- We'll be legal prisoners now.
- They'll bust me in jail.

418
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,678
When they find out
my brother's a rebel,

419
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,694
they won't leave me alone.

420
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,666
- They'll kill me.
- Why would they?

421
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:30,701
You're a nobody.

422
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,637
Sorry, Guillermo.

423
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,665
l should've taken the pill.

424
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,680
My brother warned me.

425
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,653
Knock it off. They'll beat us.

426
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,688
- Easy, Vasco.
My brother knew.

427
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,690
They're incompetent,
don't you see?

428
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,317
Easy.

429
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,918
Sorry.

430
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,697
l'm sorry.

431
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,167
l'm fine now.

432
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,042
So you knew him?

433
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,488
He squealed on me.

434
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:35,094
He did?
Vasco turned you in?

435
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,739
- What do you mean?
- He just let something slip.

436
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,071
They tortured him, he gave
my name and address.

437
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:49,374
Of course.

438
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,708
That's why you took
such good care of him.

439
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,753
Because he turned you in.

440
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,718
l should've taken care of Tano.

441
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,688
Easy. Just some medecine
for the trip home.

442
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,670
ls he ready?

443
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:16,728
Walk.

444
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,675
Single file!

445
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,734
Single file!

446
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,720
Let's go! Come on, kid!
Move it.

447
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:33,690
Easy, l said!

448
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,759
Let's go back in.

449
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,274
DAY 118

450
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,183
Eyes down!

451
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,718
Eyes on the floor!

452
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,722
Put these on, Jorge.
You're going home.

453
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,693
Are you scared, fagots?

454
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,665
<i>Wh</i>at are you waiting for?

455
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,696
You're all shit-scared?

456
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,176
Guillermo.
You're coming with me.

457
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,711
l have some questions for you.

458
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,724
l don't understand.

459
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,699
Wait here for me, Jorge.

460
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,706
Let's visit your mates,
see if they're where you said.

461
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,617
Jorge...

462
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:16,710
What do you want?

463
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,681
My name is Guillermo Fernandez.

464
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,658
Please tell my family.

465
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,661
- l live in Morón.
- Shut it.

466
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,667
l don't help guerrillas.

467
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,671
So don't bust my balls, ok?

468
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,677
Come on, Jorge.
Mind the door.

469
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:44,737
You're going home,
but choose your friends with care.

470
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:49,719
And don't print that bullshit.
lt's bad for you.

471
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,746
We know you're a good guy.

472
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,692
Don't worry your parents.

473
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,672
Head down, motherfucker!

474
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:14,677
Hello, Guillermo.
Want to go for a ride?

475
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,722
Take his cuffs off.

476
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:30,682
Head down!

477
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,706
Recognize this house?

478
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,701
Go ring the bell.

479
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,751
And mind what you do
or l'll blow your head off.

480
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,311
Look back and you're dead.
Got it?

481
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,619
Careful crossing the street.

482
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,694
l said go!

483
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,689
Guillermo Fernández?

484
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,695
A smoke?

485
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,698
Yes, please, sir.

486
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,667
Your hand.

487
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,685
Do we do a good job?

488
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:16,750
Only l've heard rumors
you were saying we don't.

489
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:22,063
Explains why you're
giving us bad adresses.

490
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,655
Ones we already know.
Like this one.

491
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,670
Or those of friends
who've already fled the country?

492
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,676
You put on a great show, kid.

493
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,713
Even the guards
thought highly of you.

494
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:44,120
You lied to us, Guillermo.
You kept information from us.

495
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:47,679
No, sir. Please understand.

496
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,226
l didn't know what l was doing.
l panicked.

497
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,057
You bought time
to save your friends.

498
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,929
No, sir, l was scared. Really.

499
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,527
l didn't hide anything.
l was so confused.

500
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,474
Do you know who l am?

501
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,569
- l'm the judge.
- Ajudge?

502
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,514
Will you send me to prison?

503
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:24,526
l decide whether we kill you
or let you go.

504
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,496
You haven't done much to stay alive.

505
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,829
l swear it wasn't an operation.

506
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,063
l didn't know
what l was saying.

507
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,438
My head was a mess...

508
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:41,607
You've got three days
to put your ideas in order,

509
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,613
and come up
with real information.

510
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:51,610
Either you open your head
or we do it.

511
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:11,563
l told you. lt's worse for those
who hold back information.

512
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:12,630
Who don't talk.

513
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,510
But you don't listen.

514
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:21,042
You're stupid.

515
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,852
Now you're all punished.

516
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,654
You must cooperate.

517
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,958
Tell the truth.

518
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,635
<i>Wh</i>en there's a lead
the investigation progresses.

519
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,640
The FBl started
in a house like this.

520
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,610
You have to tell what you know.

521
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:54,649
Or you'll end up like Tano.

522
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,682
Underground.

523
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,583
Get undressed!

524
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,655
Hands out.

525
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,670
Undress! Are you deaf?

526
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,585
The blindfolds.

527
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,626
Look at yourself, Vasco.
That's you.

528
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,572
Recognize yourself?

529
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,630
You don't?

530
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:33,572
And you, Gallego...
Recognize yourself?

531
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,588
Nor will anyone else outside.

532
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,593
Now you must talk.

533
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,631
Look at that mug!

534
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,635
Aren't you ashamed?

535
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,675
You're repulsive.

536
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,572
Here.

537
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,621
You betrayed me, Guillermo.

538
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:17,559
l was handling your case.

539
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,562
You were getting out,
now look at you.

540
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,596
You played me.

541
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,631
But now l'll get you clean.

542
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,573
Disinfectant!

543
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:51,652
How can someone this young
be so rotten inside?

544
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,595
l'll make you shine.

545
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,978
- Sir!
- You'll shine like new.

546
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:17,577
- Sir... Sir!
- You'll shine like new.

547
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,554
Shut up!

548
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:31,590
Don't forget.
Talk and you can still get out.

549
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,512
Guillermo!

550
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:50,379
Guille, are you ok?

551
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,081
l've got to get out.

552
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,595
Really?

553
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,234
l'm going with you.

554
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,801
DAY 119

555
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,369
l'm hungry.

556
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,947
Plenty of restaurants
on the outside.

557
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,213
We'll be out soon.

558
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,185
Have to hang on.

559
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,560
Gallego...

560
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,723
Still think they'll let you go?

561
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,635
- You'll end up like Tano.
- Nothing happened to Tano.

562
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,637
Lucas just wants to scare us.

563
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,577
<i>Wh</i>y else say we'd go to prison?

564
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,636
They killed Tano.

565
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:54,640
How do you know they killed him?

566
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:58,646
- And Jorge?
- Jorge was never with us.

567
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,582
Your case is closed, Gallego.

568
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,693
All our cases are closed.

569
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,555
We have to escape.

570
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,832
How do you suggest?

571
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:17,634
We must think like we did outside.

572
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,709
lt's easier than it seems.

573
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,089
- Gallego!
- Yes, Lucas.

574
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,887
And you, goalie, get dressed!

575
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,623
Think you can just lounge around?

576
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:41,823
Dirty bums!

577
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,636
Blindfold off, pants on.

578
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,594
Here. Have the scraps.

579
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,533
Thank you, Lucas.

580
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,573
Goal!

581
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,515
Come on, Argentina!

582
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,471
Were Lucas' scraps tasty?

583
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,447
You want me to reject food?

584
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,613
Don't pretend.
You're not tough.

585
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,593
- You're nobody.
- You left me alone.

586
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,596
<i>Wh</i>y didn't you do it?

587
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,296
What were you scared of, Gallego?

588
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,673
- We're all scared here.
- l wasn't scared.

589
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,767
This lunatic wanted
to hit Rivas with the pan.

590
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,038
- You held the weapon.
- lt was there.

591
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,273
lf it went wrong,
we'd all have paid.

592
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:22,177
l'm not going to kill anyone.

593
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:25,646
- You're terrified, Gallego.
- You can't talk.

594
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:29,590
Acted like Lucas' pal,
now look at you!

595
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,526
l want to get out alive.

596
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,602
My way.

597
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,337
DAY 120

598
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,615
How do you take them off?

599
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,024
l've got a plan.

600
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,562
A plan?

601
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,596
Fuck off.

602
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,803
- What's that?
- A screw.

603
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:19,137
- What for?
- To open the window.

604
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,642
l know they open,
l've cleaned them.

605
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,648
- Then what?
- Climb out using blankets.

606
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,650
They're too worn.
They won't hold.

607
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:32,588
We'll tie them with the straps.
They'll hold.

608
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:35,590
- And then?
- We'll be out.

609
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:38,627
On the outside.
We go out stark naked, right?

610
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:42,290
Nice plan! Great!

611
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:46,567
You'd rather tunnel out
with a spoon?

612
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:50,072
And when we're outside?

613
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:53,597
Know what you'll find
when you open the window?.

614
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,594
- Get up!
- Get up! Let's go!

615
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,631
Attention!

616
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,577
Attention!

617
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,582
Attention!

618
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,588
Attention!

619
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,661
Quiet! Quiet!

620
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:47,596
Quiet!

621
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:56,638
You think you're cool
because you went to college?

622
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,641
No, sir.

623
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,544
They teach you
to handle guns there?

624
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,614
No, sir.

625
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:11,586
You'd like to escape, right?

626
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,624
You'd all like to escape.

627
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:34,575
You're guilty.
That's how it is.

628
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,635
l know that's how it is.

629
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:46,621
We'll kill whoever
wants to escape.

630
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,650
Start thinking
about your last request.

631
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,601
Let's see.

632
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,704
How about you, Gallego?

633
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,541
<i>Wh</i>at's your last request?

634
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,599
Come on!

635
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:11,610
l want...

636
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:18,485
l'd like to call home.

637
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,600
And you, Guillermo?

638
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,603
What do you want?

639
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,568
Will you grant it?

640
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,641
We are men of honour.

641
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,608
We are not filthy liars.

642
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:52,620
Of course we will.
l'm listening.

643
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:58,621
lf you're going to kill me,
l want to see your faces.

644
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,518
Tie them up!

645
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,600
Get up!

646
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,579
You're killing prisoners
without telling me?

647
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:56,550
You guards are to blame.

648
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,611
You spoil these bitches rotten.

649
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:04,549
No, Hugo.
l make good use of them.

650
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:12,534
Think. The more you mistreat them,
the less they talk?

651
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:18,539
Then it's you who's rotten.

652
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:21,940
Do you feel pity for them?

653
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:26,606
You do your job. l'll do mine.

654
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,620
Less than one day left.

655
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,618
Come on!

656
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,518
You're real scum!

657
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:10,558
Treat you well
and you pay me back like this.

658
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:15,892
That was the last time, Guillermo.

659
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,533
Good night.

660
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,553
Why do you play tough?

661
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,491
Want to get killed?

662
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,619
- They heard us.
- They didn't hear anything.

663
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:52,629
- l want to finish it all.
- We're already dead.

664
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,596
We're dead.

665
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:03,503
l won't be here
when they come for me.

666
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,574
We're disappearing.

667
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,517
Gallego!

668
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,555
You're disappearing!

669
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:20,595
DAY 121
March 24, 1978

670
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:48,624
Claudio.

671
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,558
What is it?

672
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:56,597
lt has to be today.
Tomorrow l'll be dead.

673
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,032
Tucumano and Lucas are out.

674
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:02,502
They're the most unpredictable.

675
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,301
These guys are very methodical.

676
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,570
They've fed us.

677
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:12,537
Now they count us
and clear the dishes.

678
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,583
They count us again at dawn.

679
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,784
Just before sunrise.

680
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,556
That gives us three hours.

681
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:24,586
Tonight?

682
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,598
Let's pray.

683
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,578
What's up?

684
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,563
What are you doing?

685
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,601
Go back to sleep.

686
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:17,538
Shut up!
Do what l tell you.

687
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:21,565
lt's decided, Gallego.
Don't bust my balls. Shut up.

688
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:24,640
Untie Vasco.

689
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,627
This is wrong.

690
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,638
- Watch the door.
- l don't want to.

691
01:11:57,713 --> 01:12:01,581
You have no right.

692
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:03,812
You have no right.

693
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,634
Come on! Come on!

694
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,107
<i>Wh</i>at are you doing, Vasco?

695
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,734
Go see what he's doing.

696
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,605
Come on, Gallego.

697
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:14,540
Gallego.

698
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:23,617
Come on, Gallego.

699
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,599
Come on.

700
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,569
Thanks.

701
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:05,566
Come on, Gallego.

702
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:11,599
Over there, Vasco.

703
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,573
Stay there!

704
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:15,610
Where's Guillermo?

705
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,916
- <i>Wh</i>y isn't he coming?
- l don't know.

706
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:45,801
THANKS, LUCAS.

707
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,379
Grab his feet.

708
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:43,696
Give me your hand.

709
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,608
Easy... Easy.

710
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,707
Easy. Easy. Easy.

711
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,325
Come on.

712
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:42,920
Come on!

713
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,363
Go, Vasco.
You can do it.

714
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,561
Stop!

715
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:52,381
Good evening.

716
01:21:58,446 --> 01:21:59,640
Run, Vasco!

717
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,153
They're coming!

718
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,669
lt's ok, Vasco.
lt's over.

719
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,569
- Let's go.
- l can hear them.

720
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:09,549
- lt's them.
- No. There's no one.

721
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,611
Calm down.

722

We'll stay here.
We're not moving.

723
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,559
Easy. We're not moving.

724
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,575
Come here, Gallego!
You're too exposed.

725
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:41,581
There's some tools.

726
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,621
Take off my handcuffs.

727
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,592
Push hard.

01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:03,604
- l'll get them off, then l'm gone.
- What's that?

729
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:09,600
- We have to split up.
- No! Wait!

730
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:11,609
Calm down. Wait.

731
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:15,275
We'll wait...

732
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:18,442
and decide together.

733
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:23,148
We'll wait.

734
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:41,639
Call my house.

735
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,541
Tell them l'm here.

736
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,380
You remember the number?

737
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:58,615
Don't move, ok?

738
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:01,526
Don't move.

<i>Wh</i>ere are we going?

744
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:39,556
We'll take a train
and that's it.

745
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:42,702
No, it's not.
l can still hear them.

746
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,737
Come on, Come on!

747

<i>Adela? What ls lt?</i>

- lt doesn't matter.

768
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:46,553
- What?
- You don't know him.

769
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,657
He went to ask a neighbor.

770
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,558
- He ask something to wear.
- He said we should stay here?

771
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:55,626
Did you take the cuffs off?

772
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,592
Come here.

There's a hammer.

776
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:14,412
Look, clothes.

777
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:18,552
How long do we have to wait?

778
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:20,584
The sun's coming up.

779
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:53,579
l've been robbed.
l need to get home.

780
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:55,712
Can anyone take me?

Are you a mechanic?

784
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,199
No, why?

785
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:15,576
That screw in your mouth.

786
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:23,582

788
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:29,655
lt's dangerous alone at night.

789
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,659
Especially at your age.

790
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:34,661
There was a whole gang.

791
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:40,663
Cowards always go in gangs.

792
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,633
That's true.

793
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:14,601
Hold it! Quiet.

794
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:15,601
Shut up!

795
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:18,639
- Get these off and we'll go.
- But it's daylight!

796
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:20,537
We can't go now.

797
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:22,098
Shut up and let me do it!

798
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:23,302
Shut up!

799
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:25,646
Done.

800
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:29,616
Listen. l can hear a car.

801
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:31,611
Quiet.

802
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,587
lt's them!
lt's the squad!

803
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,613
That's my dad's car!

804
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:13,353
Carlos.

805
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:21,625
Look what they did to me.

806
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:29,900
Son? What happened to you?

807
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:33,071
Where have you been?

808
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,579
How did you find me?

809
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:36,617
A guy named Guillermo called...

810
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:40,644
- Get us out of here.
- l was kidnapped.

811
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:44,617
- <i>Wh</i>at are you going to do?
- Get us out of here, l beg you!

812
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:46,626
Go to the car!

- Thanks.
- Get in.

818
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,585
We've been looking everywhere.

819

The house was chaos.
l stopped going to work.

820
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,638
They're killing people, Dad.

821
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:35,609
Torturing people.

822
01:33:37,645 --> 01:33:40,637
Politics is dirty.
You know that.

823
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:48,644
How did you get out?
Who is Guillermo?

824
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:53,655
He's my friend.

825
01:33:55,529 --> 01:34:00,523
Afriend!
Who got you out of that?

826
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:03,563
A real good friend!

827
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,536
He helped me escape.

828
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:12,568
Escape?

829
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,616
You're crazy! You escaped?

830
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:21,588
They'll come after you.
They'll come after us.

831
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,563
<i>You say they torture and klll,</i>

Be quiet, Vasco.

Trust me.

835
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,575
lt's Gallego's dad.
We're getting out.

836
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:54,918
Easy, we're parking. Quiet.

848
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:11,581
He never returned to Argentina.

849
