1
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:11,258
It's time to get out.

2
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:41,759
Don't bleed to death.

3
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:48,475
- Hello Mitchell.
- Bond.

4
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:51,185
The Americans aren't going to be
none too pleased about this.

5
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:53,478
I promised them Le Chiffre
and they got Le Chiffre.

6
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:54,939
They got his body.

7
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,942
If they'd wanted his soul they should
have made a deal with a priest.

8
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,360
Has he said anything?

9
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,403
No.

10
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:03,446
Going to check perimeters, Ma'am.

11
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:07,033
You look like hell.

12
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:10,452
When was the last time you slept?

13
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:13,997
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,
the one who was abducted in Morocco...

14
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:15,708
the one she was trying to save.

15
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,502
His body was washed up on
a beach near Ibiza.

16
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:20,711
We were meant to believe
the fish did that to his face.

17
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:23,005
His wallet and ID were in his pocket.

18
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:24,882
- Well that's convenient.
- Quite.

19
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:26,884
Which is why I did a DNA check
on a lock of his hair...

20
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:28,970
found in Vesper's apartment.

21
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,345
It's not him.

22
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:32,014
A lock of his hair?

23
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:35,350
I wouldn't have thought
Vesper's the sentimental type.

24
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,852
Well, we never really know anyone,
do we?

25
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,897
But I do need to know Bond...

26
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,317
I need to know
that I can trust you.

27
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,360
And you don't?

28
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,195
He'd need to be a pretty cold
bastard who didn't want revenge...

29
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,739
for the death of someone he loved.

30
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,698
You don't have to worry about me.

31
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:57,202
I'm not gonna go chasing him.
He's not important.

32
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,706
And neither is she.

33
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:02,832
It's clear, Ma'am.

34
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:04,375
Thanks, Mitchell.

35
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,086
Shall we?

36
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:26,394
You're gonna tell us who you work for?

37
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:30,357
I was always very interested
to meet you.

38
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:32,777
I'd heard so much
about you from Vesper.

39
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:34,486
In fact, the real shame is that...

40
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:38,197
if she hadn't killed herself,
we would've had you too.

41
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:40,991
I think you would have done
anything for her.

42
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:44,827
Well, you know you're not in Britain,
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.

43
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:46,830
Which should tell you
that eventually...

44
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,540
you'll tell us about the people
you work with...

45
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,253
and the longer it takes,
the more painful we'll make it.

46
00:09:55,797 --> 00:10:00,259
You really don't know
anything about us.

47
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:05,972
It's so amusing, because we on
the other side... thinking, oh...

48
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,517
the MI6, the CIA, they're
looking over our shoulders...

49
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:10,769
they're listening
to our conversations...

50
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,770
and the truth is,
you don't even know we exist.

51
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,649
Oh, we do know, Mr White...
and we are quick learners.

52
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,197
Well, then, the first thing
you should know about us is...

53
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:26,700
that we have people everywhere.

54
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,493
Am I right?

55
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,253
Oh, my God... what inhumanity!

56
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:44,649
Anything?

57
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,778
Craig Mitchell worked for me for 8 years.

58
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:51,030
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year.

59
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,408
He didn't leave so much as a scrap
of paper to explain any of it.

60
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:57,245
Eight years,
five as my personal bodyguard.

61
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:58,453
I found this...

62
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:01,248
and 3 other bloody Christmas presents
I bought him, about the house.

63
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:03,207
I don't think he smoked.

64
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,961
And you had to kill him! You couldn't
bring him in for questioning...

65
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,046
so we might actually
learn something.

66
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:09,923
When someone says:
"We've got people everywhere"...

67
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:11,423
you expect it to be hyperbole.

68
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:12,716
Lots of people saying that...

69
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:14,134
Florists use that expression.

70
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:18,221
It doesn't mean they've got someone
working for them inside the bloody room.

71
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,724
What the hell
is this organization, Bond?

72
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:23,434
How can they be everywhere and
we know nothing about them?

73
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:27,897
- I assume we found no trace of White.
- No, ma'am.

74
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:31,650
The agent guarding the door in the garage
was dead before you passed him on the stairs.

75
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,610
I passed him on the stairs?
Christ!

76
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,779
Mitchell must have killed him,
when he went out to check the perimeter.

77
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,908
- You're lucky to be here.
- You think White is still alive?

78
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,993
- Yes I do.
- What is it?

79
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,870
Craig Mitchell, 45 years old,
has no living family...

80
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,455
gave generously to charity.

81
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:48,123
- Tell me you know more than that.
- Yes...

82
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:50,875
Our money men went through every
bill in Mitchell's wallet and house.

83
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,171
- How much did he have?
- Less than 100 pounds.

84
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:56,172
And about the same,
in euros and dollars.

85
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:57,840
Excuse me! Excuse me, ma'am.

86
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,842
We did a complete forensic analysis
of every note and its traceable history.

87
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:02,803
I'm not in the mood.

88
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:06,390
After you.

89
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:09,476
This particular note from Mitchell's
wallet might be of interest.

90
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:12,854
We introduced tagged bills into
Le Chiffre's money laundering operation...

91
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:15,021
by intercepting illegal payoffs.

92
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:18,150
We traced money through several of
his bank accounts around the world.

93
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,484
That's pretty thin.

94
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:20,861
At the rate
money changes hands...

95
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:23,279
you could probably find a tenner
in my robe with a tag.

96
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,950
That's true Ma'am, a single bill could be a
coincidence, but what about a whole stack?

97
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,411
These bills from
the same series as Mitchell's...

98
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,788
were just scanned at a bank
in Port au Prince, Haiti.

99
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:36,000
Deposited into the account
of a Mr Slate.

100
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,375
Impress me.

101
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:41,296
We have a Mr Edmund Slate, returning to
Port au Prince from Heathrow this morning.

102
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:44,590
His entry documents have
him staying at Hotel Dessalines.

103
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,384
He's in room 325.

104
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:57,728
Thank you.

105
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,769
You're welcome.

106
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:10,054
Do you have any messages for 325?

107
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:16,018
Oh, no sir, the only message is about
the briefcase that was delivered earlier.

108
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:17,685
Did you want us
to continue holding it?

109
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,896
- No, I'll take that now.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,692
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

111
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,409
Get in.

112
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,328
- What?
- Get in!

113
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,372
Fine.

114
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,294
You're late.

115
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:46,711
Oh...
I got pulled into a meeting.

116
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:50,464
- Who with?
- A friend of Mr. Whites.

117
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,593
I don't think I know him.

118
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:58,721
It's funny.

119
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,891
You don't look at all
like I expected.

120
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:02,351
Really?

121
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:03,393
What were you expecting?

122
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:06,020
I didn't think geologists
looked so...

123
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,064
So?

124
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,359
Friend of yours?

125
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,111
I don't have any friends.

126
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:23,536
Get outta the way, move it!

127
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,923
We didn't settle on a price.

128
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,093
Make me an offer.

129
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:44,055
Okay, we can work out later,
over drinks.

130
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,182
Dominic,
didn't give you any trouble, did he?

131
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,518
No.

132
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,855
What the hell is this?

133
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:58,608
I think someone wants to kill you.

134
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,032
That wasn't very nice.

135
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,663
You were supposed to shoot her.

136
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,288
Well, I missed.

137
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:26,300
- I guess he didn't like that.
- Get Bond.

138
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:28,135
Where is he now?

139
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:31,137
Approaching the docks.
Kings Key.

140
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:35,474
- Tanner?
- I've got Bond.

141
00:22:35,474 --> 00:22:38,561
<i>- Ask him about Slate.
- She wants to know about Slate.</i>

142
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:41,646
- Tell her Slate was a dead end.
- Slate was a dead end.

143
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:44,650
Damn-it!...
He must have killed him.

144
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:59,997
Yes mommy, it's awful hot here.

145
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,280
- Touch me and I'll break your wrist.

146
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:32,692
Camille?

147
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:35,613
How nice to see you.

148
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:37,697
Alive you mean?

149
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,285
I knew we shouldn't have
slept together.

150
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,703
I think I'm starting to like you.

151
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:47,330
So you did just try
to have me killed?

152
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:52,877
And that made me very sad
thinking I would never see you again.

153
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:55,837
- But... here you are.
- Damn-it, Dominic!

154
00:23:55,837 --> 00:23:58,258
I was trying to help you!

155
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:03,221
I was trying to uncover a leak.

156
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:06,181
And you...
you send someone to kill me?

157
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:08,849
Please, don't talk to me
like I'm stupid!

158
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:12,520
It's unattractive.

159
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:17,191
Come, I wanna show you something.

160
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,528
Come.

161
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:23,989
There is nothing that makes me
more uncomfortable, than...

162
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:26,324
friends talking behind my back.

163
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:28,576
It feels like...

164
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:31,203
ants under my skin.

165
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,580
It's been that way forever...

166
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:36,709
I remember when I was 15.

167
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,961
I had a crush on one of my
mother's piano students.

168
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:42,380
Somehow...

169
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,300
I overheard her saying very
nasty things about me.

170
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:49,429
I got so angry...

171
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:52,471
I took a knife...

172
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:57,185
Is that him?

173
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,896
I don't...
We only spoke on the phone.

174
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:06,527
It's such a shame, because he's one
of my best geologists.

175
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:10,070
He said you asked
to buy information.

176
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,159
No, he called me and offered
to sell information.

177
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:18,872
Why would I come back here
if I was lying?

178
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:21,080
Because you love me.

179
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,250
I was doing it for you.

180
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,086
To stop him from betraying you.

181
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,673
You know what burns more...
then all your bullshit?

182
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:35,135
Is that I always got the feeling
that you were only sleeping with me...

183
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:38,262
to get to General Medrano.

184
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,598
Is that him?

185
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:44,019
You know how these
deposed dictators are.

186
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:47,480
Jealous of their safety.

187
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:49,981
Stick around.

188
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:52,902
I'll introduce you.

189
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:56,863
You see the girl
that just walked in here?

190
00:25:56,863 --> 00:25:59,156
Would you give her that
and tell her to call me.

191
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:23,555
<i>You have reached Universal Exports,
all our offices are currently closed...</i>

192
00:26:29,977 --> 00:26:32,895
And you can do all this for me?

193
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,941
Well look at,
what we did to this country.

194
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:39,234
The Haitians elect a priest
who decides...

195
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:42,738
to raise the minimum wage
from 38 cents to one dollar a day.

196
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:43,738
Oh...

197
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:46,991
It's not a lot, but it's enough
to upset the corporations...

198
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:50,202
who were here making T-hirts
and running shoes.

199
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:54,455
So they called us
and we facilitated the change.

200
00:26:54,582 --> 00:27:00,211
The difference is my country is not some
fly speck in the middle of the Caribbean.

201
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:03,548
Plus we've already begun
destabilizing the government.

202
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:05,924
We'll supply the private security.

203
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,344
We'll pay off the right officials...

204
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:12,597
And we have 26 countries ready to
officially recognize your...

205
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,851
new Bolivian government.

206
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:18,519
You want your country back.

207
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,606
My organization can give it
to you within... two weeks.

208
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:25,902
You've been busy.

209
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:29,321
And in return...
you want what?

210
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:30,905
A desert.

211
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:41,080
- This part.
- This land is worthless.

212
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,417
Ahh...
So you're getting a great deal?

213
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:46,503
You won't find oil there.

214
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:48,755
Everyone has tried.

215
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:50,256
Maybe.

216
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,090
Maybe not.

217
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,929
But we own...
whatever we find.

218
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,263
Good.

219
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:02,768
Huh...

220
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:07,980
- Did you know, Ernesto Montes?
- A very powerful man in his day.

221
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,442
- He had a beautiful Russian wife.
- I know he did...

222
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:13,693
- A dancer...

223
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:16,614
And his daughter works for me...

224
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,615
or... did.

225
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,575
She's lovely.

226
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,993
But I don't see the resemblance.

227
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:27,873
Why don't you consider her
something to sweeten the deal?

228
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,837
Just promise me to drop her over
the side when you're done.

229
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,423
Camille...
General Medrano.

230
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:44,513
- General... Mucho gusto.
- Mucho gusto, seńorita.

231
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:56,398
Be careful what you wish for,
my dear.

232
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,657
Have fun you too.

233
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:19,138
Don't let 'em get away!
Don't let 'em get away!

234
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:27,021
What the hell are you doing?

235
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:29,523
- You're welcome!
- You idiot, take me back.

236
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,692
You know, maybe I'll do that later.

237
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:37,113
You're not one of Greene's?

238
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,950
Dominic Greene?

239
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:45,329
Get down!

240
00:31:10,227 --> 00:31:12,145
- Give me the wheel!
- Navigate!

241
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:19,861
Left!

242
00:31:30,703 --> 00:31:33,497
- What're you doing?
- Hold on!

243
00:31:49,804 --> 00:31:51,638
Get down!

244
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,294
- Excuse me.

245
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:13,295
Thank you.

246
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,047
She's seasick.

247
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,661
It's Bond...
Connect Bond!

248
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:51,872
Yes?

249
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:56,040
Name check: Dominic Greene.
G- R- double E-N-E.

250
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,917
We'll need more than this.

251
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:00,712
Might need a little more than that,
there're a lot of Dominic Greenes'.

252
00:34:00,712 --> 00:34:02,838
Do you have a social security
or passport number?

253
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:03,756
No.

254
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,884
Anything?

255
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,721
Do you have anything?

256
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:11,847
- Will you put her on, please.
- I am on, Bond.

257
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:13,264
What happened to Slate?

258
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,809
I'm not dwelling on the past,
I don't think you should either.

259
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:17,436
You killed him?

260
00:34:17,436 --> 00:34:20,063
NOR just hit: Dominic Greene,
CEO of Greene Planet.

261
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:22,356
It's... a utility company...

262
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:24,775
but Greene's been doing a lot of
philanthropic work...

263
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:27,110
buying up large tracts of land
for ecological preserves.

264
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,197
<i>You should be getting
his picture now.</i>

265
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,822
Yeah, that's him.

266
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,742
I'm afraid there's a firewall
around his other corporate holdings...

267
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,411
so, we have no other information.

268
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,204
Get me the Americans.

269
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:39,748
<i>Connect.</i>

270
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:40,789
<i>Go ahead.</i>

271
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:43,416
Interest in Dominic Greene,
Greene Planet.

272
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,503
<i>Transferring you now...</i>

273
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,922
<i>Hold for Gregory Beam, please.</i>

274
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:53,217
<i>Thank you... oh, hi,
this is Gregory Beam, ma'am.</i>

275
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,927
Hello, Mr. Beam.

276
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,264
<i>Huh... so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr. Greene.</i>

277
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:01,057
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Beam.
- Connection terminated.</i>

278
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,768
He's a person of extreme interest.

279
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,811
- But he just said that...
- Tanner...

280
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,063
I asked about the man and she transferred
me to the section chief of South America.

281
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:10,817
How would she know to do that
if they weren't tracking him?

282
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:18,072
<i>Bond, we have your location
as approaching an airfield.</i>

283
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,865
<i>Is Greene on the move?</i>

284
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:23,536
Yeah, I've got a tail number
Golf Zero Charlie Sierra Charlie.

285
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:25,496
<i>It'll get you it's destination.</i>

286
00:35:28,414 --> 00:35:33,003
<i>It's a... private charter, going to
Bregenz Austria, leaving immediately.</i>

287
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,672
<i>Tanner,
authorize a Charter for 007.</i>

288
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:42,262
And Bond, if you could avoid killing every
possible lead, it would be deeply appreciated.

289
00:35:42,262 --> 00:35:46,849
<i>- Yes, ma'am... I'll do my best.
- Connection terminated</i>

290
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,766
I've heard that before.

291
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:52,688
- Hello.
- Hi.

292
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:54,606
Ah, welcome aboard.

293
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:56,983
Bonjour... Ça va?

294
00:35:56,983 --> 00:35:59,735
- Ça va, ça va.
- Come, have a seat.

295
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,793
Jeez.

296
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:20,545
Sorry.

297
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,632
How much longer?

298
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:30,221
So do we have an understanding?

299
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:32,097
Well, yeah...

300
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:36,226
We do nothing to stop a coup
in Bolivia and in exchange, the huh...

301
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:40,230
new government gives America
the lease to any oil found.

302
00:36:40,688 --> 00:36:43,023
If it's oil you want.

303
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,818
You didn't find diamonds, did ya?

304
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:53,909
Ah, drilling underground...

305
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:56,161
you kept off everyone's radar
for a very long time but...

306
00:36:56,161 --> 00:37:00,331
you can't buy that much piping
without somebody getting curious.

307
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,626
We'll have to verify the find.

308
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:09,005
I'm not really admitting there is one.
You are getting this for free.

309
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:12,342
Venezuela, Brazil now Bolivia.

310
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:16,846
With you tied up in the Middle East,
South America is falling like dominoes.

311
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:22,934
You don't need another Marxist giving
national resources to people, do you?

312
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:24,769
No, we can hardly be expected...

313
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:27,188
to do something about a coup
we know nothing about.

314
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:33,527
I think, I have a... pest

315
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:41,367
You have any idea who that is?

316
00:37:51,918 --> 00:37:53,670
Sorry.

317
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:58,257
It's James Bond,
British Secret Service.

318
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:02,302
I don't know how
I could've missed that.

319
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:06,849
I will need for you
to get rid of him for me.

320
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:09,559
Yeah...
That's not gonna be a problem.

321
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:28,617
You know who Greene is, and you
wanna put us in bed with him.

322
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:29,911
You are kidding right?

323
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:33,248
Yeah, you're right.
We should just deal with nice people.

324
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:36,250
I need to know
you're on the team, Felix.

325
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,170
I need to know
you value your career.

326
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:13,963
- Good to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

327
00:40:14,003 --> 00:40:15,880
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

328
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:26,664
<i>- How much more pipeline do we need?
- Ideally...</i>

329
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:28,541
2000 kilometers.

330
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,501
<i>Are there any objections?</i>

331
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:35,172
<i>- No... not here.
- No objections.</i>

332
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:38,757
Transfer the funds from
our Siberian holdings.

333
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:40,300
<i>Done.</i>

334
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:46,472
Where do the Americans stand?

335
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:50,936
The CIA doesn't care about another
dictator as long as they get their end.

336
00:42:50,978 --> 00:42:53,731
But when they find out that
they've been duped?

337
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,315
I'm working on that.

338
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:58,775
I'm still not sure that the Tierra project
is the best use for Quantum this time.

339
00:42:58,818 --> 00:43:01,237
<i>Perhaps we should shift
our focus to the Canadians.</i>

340
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:04,157
<i>This is the world's most
precious resource.</i>

341
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:06,992
<i>We need to control as
much of it as we can.</i>

342
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:09,619
Bolivia must be top priority.

343
00:43:10,077 --> 00:43:12,204
Can I offer an opinion?

344
00:43:13,248 --> 00:43:17,585
I really think you people should
find a better place to meet.

345
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,300
Where do you think you're going?

346
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,237
Thank you.

347
00:43:58,246 --> 00:44:01,581
It seems Tosca isn't for everyone.

348
00:45:15,356 --> 00:45:17,190
Drop it!

349
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,739
So, who're you working for?

350
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:24,407
Piss off!

351
00:45:24,407 --> 00:45:28,577
Get rid of anything we brought with us.
We've been compromised.

352
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:33,373
I asked you,
who you were working for.

353
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:47,552
- Is he one of ours?
- No.

354
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:50,012
Then he shouldn't be looking at me.

355
00:45:58,436 --> 00:46:00,856
Get me M.

356
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,235
- Fräulein...
- Heinz... connect call.

357
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:08,862
We've ID'd the pictures.

358
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:10,530
Show me.

359
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,117
Gregor Karakov, former minister, now
owns most of the mines in Siberia.

360
00:46:15,284 --> 00:46:19,121
Moeshi Saroff, former Mossad,
now Telecomm giant...

361
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:21,748
and Guy Haines, special envoy
to the prime minister.

362
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:24,251
- Get Bond.
- There's something else.

363
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:28,588
It appears Bond shot Haines's
bodyguard and threw him off a roof.

364
00:46:33,134 --> 00:46:35,387
<i>- Where are you?
- Did you get my pictures?</i>

365
00:46:35,387 --> 00:46:37,931
<i>Abridge this conversation,
can you link these people?</i>

366
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:40,349
<i>- I hear stress in your voice.
- I need you to come in and debrief.</i>

367
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:43,601
- I don't have time.
- Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz.

368
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,061
I did my best not to.

369
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:47,021
You shot him at point blank
and threw him off a roof.

370
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:49,065
I'd hardly call that
"showing restraint".

371
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,608
Especially since he was
a member of special branch.

372
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:56,280
So, who was he guarding?

373
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,115
Bond, you're missing the fact that you
killed a member of the special branch.

374
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:02,119
- I want you to come in.
- And I would...

375
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,704
but right now I need to find
the one who tried to kill you.

376
00:47:04,704 --> 00:47:07,666
<i>- Go back to sleep.
- Connection terminated</i>

377
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:10,835
Restrict Bond's movements.
Cancel his cards.

378
00:47:10,835 --> 00:47:13,128
Put an alert on his passports.
All of them...

379
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:15,463
and I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.

380
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:17,465
- Yes, ma'am.
- And Tanner...

381
00:47:17,507 --> 00:47:19,675
be careful who you trust with this.

382
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:22,262
Hopefully you're a better
judge of character than I am.

383
00:47:23,262 --> 00:47:26,224
You want to follow your friends
to La Paz, Bolivia?

384
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:27,807
Please.

385
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:31,394
Oh, I'm sorry sir,
but this one doesn't work.

386
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:33,563
Do you have another card?

387
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:35,315
No.

388
00:47:40,445 --> 00:47:42,320
Could you do me a favor.

389
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,407
You're gonna get a phone call
in a minute.

390
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:47,324
Would you mind telling them
I'm headed for Cairo?

391
00:47:47,742 --> 00:47:49,077
I'll be happy to.

392
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:50,661
Thank you.

393
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,626
Ocean Sky, guten abend.


394
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:31,865
Mathis.

395
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:33,532
What do you want?

396
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:36,036
Come to apologize?

397
00:48:38,038 --> 00:48:42,791
You know Mathis...
I think retirement suits you.

398
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,460
None for him.

399
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,463
Sorry...
he is in a bad mood today.

400
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:14,903
I need a passport
and matching credit cards.

401
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,905
Has MI6 run out of plastic?

402
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,367
Well oddly right now you're the
only person I think I should trust.

403
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,077
That is odd.

404
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:26,414
But I guess, when one's
young it seems very easy...

405
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:28,416
to distinguish between
right and wrong.

406
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:30,543
But as one gets older...

407
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:32,085
it becomes more difficult.

408
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:35,172
The villains and the heros
get all mixed up.

409
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:39,050
I was sorry to hear about Vesper.

410
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,802
- I think she loved you.

411
00:49:41,802 --> 00:49:44,806
right up until the
moment she betrayed me.

412
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:46,681
She died for you.

413
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:50,936
Why did you really want to see me?

414
00:49:52,938 --> 00:49:55,190
I need some information.

415
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,860
Ahh...

416
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,862
you have some hard friends.

417
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,364
This man is some kind of
facilitator, fingers in many pies...

418
00:50:04,364 --> 00:50:06,282
but that don't leave any prints.

419
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:08,702
These men were together?

420
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:10,202
They're buying up oil pipeline.

421
00:50:10,202 --> 00:50:12,664
Something called
the "Tierra Project", you know it?

422
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:16,416
Destroy these! That's the guy, Haines.
You don't know him?

423
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,626
- Should I?
- I suppose not.

424
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:21,463
You haven't been keeping
secrets as long as I have.

425
00:50:21,463 --> 00:50:23,548
He keeps a very low profile...

426
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:27,385
but is one of the
Prime Ministers' closest advisers.

427
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:30,472
And they say that you're judged
by the strength of your enemies...

428
00:50:31,389 --> 00:50:33,474
You know anything about Bolivia?

429
00:50:33,474 --> 00:50:36,684
I was stationed
in South America for 7 years.

430
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,353
You probably still have
some contacts there?

431
00:50:38,353 --> 00:50:40,105
A few.

432
00:50:40,146 --> 00:50:41,898
What do you want to know?

433
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,817
Come with me.

434
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:17,222
You can't sleep?

435
00:51:17,514 --> 00:51:19,474
May I fix you a drink, sir?

436
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:21,557
What are you drinking?

437
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:24,143
I don't know,
what am I drinking?

438
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:28,023
3 measures of Gordon's Gin,
1 of Vodka, 1/2 a measure of Kina O...

439
00:51:28,023 --> 00:51:31,067
- Kina Ole...
- Kina Ole, which is not Vermouth.

440
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:33,193
Shaken well until it's ice cold...

441
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:35,822
then served with a large
thin slice of lemon peel.

442
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,907
Six of them.

443
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:41,827
- That's impressive.
- They're good, you should have one.

444
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:45,246
Nah... it would just keep me awake.

445
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,835
So, what's keeping you awake?

446
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,632
I was wondering
why you came with me.

447
00:51:58,425 --> 00:52:01,760
It takes something
to admit you were wrong.

448
00:52:05,014 --> 00:52:06,599
You want a sleeping pill?

449
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:09,643
- No.
- Pain pill?

450
00:52:09,684 --> 00:52:11,644
I have pills for everything.

451
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:14,273
Some make you taller.

452
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,065
Some make you forget.

453
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:22,697
I'm gonna try
to get some sleep.

454
00:52:22,697 --> 00:52:24,157
Good idea.

455
00:52:39,545 --> 00:52:40,545
Thank you.

456
00:52:40,545 --> 00:52:43,923
One moment, Mr. Bond, my name is Fields,
I'm from the consulate.

457
00:52:43,923 --> 00:52:46,425
Well, of course you are,
what'd you do at the consulate, Fields?

458
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:49,054
That's not what's important.
My orders are to turn you around...

459
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:51,389
and put you on the first plane
back to London.

460
00:52:51,431 --> 00:52:53,891
Do those orders
include my friend Mathis?

461
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:56,018
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

462
00:52:56,351 --> 00:52:58,978
You see that? Gone such a short
time and already forgotten.

463
00:52:59,646 --> 00:53:01,356
Ahh, you're just saying that
to hurt me.

464
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:04,692
Mr Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authority.

465
00:53:07,778 --> 00:53:08,905
Tomorrow morning.

466
00:53:08,905 --> 00:53:10,239
Well then, we have all night.

467
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:12,199
If you try to flee,
I will arrest you...

468
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:15,077
drop you off in jail and take you
to the plane in chains. Understand?

469
00:53:15,077 --> 00:53:16,994
Perfectly, after you.

470
00:53:18,163 --> 00:53:19,914
I think she has handcuffs.

471
00:53:19,956 --> 00:53:21,083
I certainly hope so.

472
00:53:28,588 --> 00:53:31,840
He blames the water shortage
on global warming.

473
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:41,891
The colonel,
who heads the national police.

474
00:53:59,282 --> 00:54:01,076
Carlos, momentito.

475
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:08,873
- We have a reservation.
- One moment.

476
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:10,001
- Okay.
- I'll have to verify it.

477
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:11,126
Very well, thank you.

478
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:13,628
- Your name?
- Miss Fields.

479
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:16,757
Wait...

480
00:54:18,257 --> 00:54:19,425
You're going nowhere.

481
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:21,135
So, shoot me,
I'd rather stay at a morgue.

482
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:23,512
We are teachers on sabbatical,
it fits our cover.

483
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:25,597
No, it doesn't... get in.

484
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,266
Get in!

485
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:43,197
Ola...

486
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,791
Follow me please.

487
00:55:02,213 --> 00:55:04,132
May I show you your room, Seńor?

488
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,217
- No, it's fine, thank you.
- Gracias.

489
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:27,695
I can't find the, um...
the stationery.

490
00:55:28,445 --> 00:55:29,989
Come and help me look.

491
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,670
We've been invited to a party.

492
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:48,963
I didn't know we had any friends here.

493
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:51,882
Green Planet.

494
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:54,760
You're not coming?

495
00:55:54,802 --> 00:55:57,054
I'm having a drink with my friend,
the Colonel.

496
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:58,847
I'll see you there later.

497
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:06,396
Do you know
how angry I am at myself?

498
00:56:07,481 --> 00:56:09,148
I can't imagine.

499
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,902
You must be furious.

500
00:56:20,282 --> 00:56:21,909
Do you wanna go to a party?

501
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:24,621
Party?

502
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:27,456
But I have nothing to wear.

503
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,583
We'll fix that.

504
00:56:48,057 --> 00:56:51,436
It might be useful
to know your real name.

505
00:56:51,686 --> 00:56:53,021
Fields.

506
00:56:54,856 --> 00:56:56,442
Just Fields.

507
00:56:57,525 --> 00:56:59,193
Fields it is.

508
00:56:59,735 --> 00:57:03,864
We are in a spiral
of environmental decline.

509
00:57:04,782 --> 00:57:06,532
Since 1945...

510
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:13,748
17% of the planet's vegetated surface
has been irreversibly degraded.

511
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:19,795
The Tierra project is just one small
part of a global network, of equal parts...

512
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,634
that Green Planet has created,
to rejuvenate the world...

513
00:57:24,634 --> 00:57:26,300
on the verge of collapse.

514
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:32,641
I hope that tonight, you make the
decision to be part of that.

515
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:35,391
Thank you.

516
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,231
And have fun.

517
00:57:44,983 --> 00:57:46,818
Excellent speech. Congratulations.

518
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:48,737
Wonderful speech, Dominic.

519
00:57:49,322 --> 00:57:50,489
Thank you.

520
00:57:51,324 --> 00:57:52,990
Miss Fields, Mr. Bond...

521
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:55,911
- my friend Carlos.
- Pleased to meet you.

522
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:56,952
Ma'am.

523
00:57:57,286 --> 00:58:00,581
Mr. Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

524
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:04,960
I want you to know my entire
police force... is at your disposal.

525
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,295
Well, that could be very useful.

526
00:58:06,378 --> 00:58:08,380
You know, there are people
in this country...

527
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,925
spending half their paycheck
just to get clean water.

528
00:58:11,092 --> 00:58:12,467
What do you think of that?

529
00:58:12,592 --> 00:58:14,802
The Bolivian government
is the problem.

530
00:58:14,802 --> 00:58:17,389
They cut down the trees,
then act surprised...

531
00:58:17,389 --> 00:58:20,182
when the water and the soil,
wash out to sea.

532
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:21,724
I couldn't agree more.

533
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:23,643
I hope this figure
is to your liking.

534
00:58:23,643 --> 00:58:25,896
Cherie, you shouldn't tease.

535
00:58:26,313 --> 00:58:30,608
Why don't you tell them about all the
land you bought up outside near the sea?

536
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:33,110
It's been a pleasure.
Would you excuse me?

537
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:37,532
Somehow the logging rights went
to a Multinational Corporation...

538
00:58:37,532 --> 00:58:39,242
that cut down the forests.

539
00:58:39,409 --> 00:58:43,954
But only after our last government
sold the land to Green Planet.

540
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,291
- Oh, have I got my facts crossed?
- Yes, I think you did.

541
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,918
Will you excuse us?

542
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,213
What a wonderful night, Seńor.

543
00:58:58,009 --> 00:59:00,969
You just cost me quite a bit
of money darling.

544
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,679
You can't put a price
on integrity.

545
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:05,597
I can try.

546
00:59:12,603 --> 00:59:16,358
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight
just to piss on my parade.

547
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,860
Why are you still after this
general's head, for your mantel?

548
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:21,945
A little of both.

549
00:59:22,487 --> 00:59:27,867
Tell me where Medrano is, and maybe
you won't lose any more investors.

550
00:59:30,704 --> 00:59:34,458
You are really breaking my heart
choosing an insect like that over me.

551
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:38,043
You're going to throw me over?

552
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,380
Well, you've been drinking...
maybe you slipped?

553
00:59:42,297 --> 00:59:44,467
Oh... just think
how much you'd miss me.

554
00:59:49,637 --> 00:59:51,181
Good evening.

555
00:59:51,306 --> 00:59:52,931
There you are.

556
00:59:54,974 --> 00:59:56,226
Would you excuse me?

557
00:59:57,018 --> 00:59:58,771
Mr. Bond.

558
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:01,315
What a pleasure.

559
01:00:03,192 --> 01:00:05,943
Careful with this one,
she won't go to bed with you...

560
01:00:05,943 --> 01:00:08,737
unless you give her something
she really wants.

561
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:13,574
That's a shame, because she's really quite
stunning once you... get her on her back.

562
01:00:13,574 --> 01:00:16,536
Yeah, I wish I could say that
the feeling was mutual.

563
01:00:16,536 --> 01:00:18,204
I'm sorry Mr. Greene,
but we have to go.

564
01:00:18,204 --> 01:00:20,164
Please,
my friends call me Dominic.

565
01:00:20,164 --> 01:00:22,250
I'm sure they do.

566
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:26,420
How much do you know about Bond,
Camille, because he's rather...

567
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,423
a tragic case, his MI6 says
that he's difficult to control.

568
01:00:30,423 --> 01:00:35,719
Nice way of saying that everything
he touches seems to wither and die.

569
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,012
Shall we?

570
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:39,516
It doesn't bode well for you,
I'm afraid.

571
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:41,891
You two do make
a charming couple, though.

572
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:44,769
You're both...
what's the expression?

573
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:47,063
Damaged goods.

574
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:51,693
Oh my Gosh!

575
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:54,195
I'm so sorry.

576
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,865
Come on, lighten up.
You're cramping my style.

577
01:01:01,201 --> 01:01:05,371
So it's British intelligence now?
What the hell they want from me?

578
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:07,748
You're gonna show me
Dominic Greene's Tierra Project.

579
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:10,166
- Are you up to it?
- Do I have choice?

580
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,585
Do you want one?

581
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,713
There's something horribly
efficient about you.

582
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,590
What a compliment.

583
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:33,938
What's the bet that Dominic Greene
has friends in the police force?

584
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,867
Stay here.

585
01:01:49,244 --> 01:01:51,079
Buenas Noches.

586
01:02:07,677 --> 01:02:10,179
<i>Now why would you
want me to do that?</i>

587
01:02:42,501 --> 01:02:44,168
Mathis.

588
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,547
There's a hospital
on the other side of town.

589
01:02:49,005 --> 01:02:53,134
Please... stay with me.

590
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:55,762
Stay here, please.

591
01:02:55,762 --> 01:02:57,097
Please.

592
01:02:57,097 --> 01:02:58,806
Come here.

593
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:02,309
It's alright...
hold on.

594
01:03:02,393 --> 01:03:04,436
Okay.

595
01:03:05,478 --> 01:03:07,398
That's better.

596
01:03:07,398 --> 01:03:09,733
That doesn't hurt.

597
01:03:12,277 --> 01:03:14,653
Is Mathis your cover name?

598
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:17,364
Yes.

599
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:21,117
Not a very good one, is it?

600
01:03:26,873 --> 01:03:30,083
Do we forgive each other?

601
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,255
I shouldn't have left you alone.

602
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,800
Vesper.

603
01:03:38,342 --> 01:03:40,719
She did everything for you.

604
01:03:42,262 --> 01:03:44,514
Forgive her.

605
01:03:46,016 --> 01:03:48,266
Forgive yourself.

606
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:12,039
Is that how you treat your friends?

607
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:14,458
He wouldn't care.

608
01:04:20,545 --> 01:04:22,213
Let's go.

609
01:04:36,184 --> 01:04:39,063
The Foreign Secretary
is asking to see you.

610
01:04:40,063 --> 01:04:41,815
What don't I know?

611
01:04:41,815 --> 01:04:44,400
<i>René Mathis, has been
shot dead in Bolivia.</i>

612
01:04:44,525 --> 01:04:47,110
<i>The police claim it was Bond.</i>

613
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:10,423
Buenos días.

614
01:05:13,217 --> 01:05:14,427
Buenos días.

615
01:05:21,393 --> 01:05:24,311
- How much did you pay him?
- Well, he wanted you.

616
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:26,813
But I left him the car
as collateral.

617
01:05:26,813 --> 01:05:29,148
He'll make much more
when he sells us out.

618
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:35,487
Alright...
let's see if this thing will fly.

619
01:05:51,543 --> 01:05:52,878
Here...

620
01:05:52,878 --> 01:05:56,090
all the information I found said
there was nothing of value there.

621
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:58,592
But Greene's geologists
had prove that there was.

622
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:06,099
My sources tell me you're
Bolivian Secret Service...

623
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:09,143
or used to be.

624
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:13,938
And you infiltrated Greene's
organization by having sex with him.

625
01:06:14,188 --> 01:06:17,275
- That offends you?
- No, not in the slightest.

626
01:06:17,692 --> 01:06:19,777
So, what's your interest
in Greene?

627
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:22,697
Well, amongst other things,
he tried to kill a friend of mine.

628
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:25,115
- A woman?
- Yes...

629
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:26,617
but it's not what you think.

630
01:06:26,617 --> 01:06:29,411
- Your mother?
- She likes to think so.

631
01:06:32,914 --> 01:06:34,916
What's that... down there?

632
01:06:37,668 --> 01:06:41,422
That's a sink hole...
There are a few around here.

633
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:45,967
Just for the record,
I wasn't with Greene for a...

634
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,612
I think we lost him.

635
01:08:03,494 --> 01:08:05,998
He's coming fast.

636
01:08:52,038 --> 01:08:53,998
He's right behind you!

637
01:09:35,911 --> 01:09:38,872
Here!
Put that on!

638
01:10:22,869 --> 01:10:25,204
Come on!

639
01:10:45,097 --> 01:10:46,850
Come here!

640
01:11:05,658 --> 01:11:07,993
According to Bolivians
it was a routine stop...

641
01:11:07,993 --> 01:11:11,329
and when they discovered Mathis's body,
Bond disarmed and shot them.

642
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:13,789
Of course there are no witnesses
to prove otherwise.

643
01:11:13,789 --> 01:11:16,501
I need something.
I can't go in there unarmed.

644
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:18,252
I'm sorry, there's nothing.

645
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,923
Come in.

646
01:11:23,673 --> 01:11:26,842
What's today's excuse?
That Bond is legally blind?

647
01:11:26,842 --> 01:11:28,345
No, Minister.

648
01:11:28,345 --> 01:11:31,139
I don't think I need to tell you
how upset the P.M. is.

649
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:34,059
With respect, the P.M. has
my direct line.

650
01:11:34,059 --> 01:11:36,518
And he would've used it
if he wanted to speak to you.

651
01:11:37,936 --> 01:11:43,734
I'm sorry M... things have changed...
We've had long discussions with our cousins.

652
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:46,277
Mr. Greene's interests
and ours now align.

653
01:11:46,277 --> 01:11:48,238
Minister, this man
is a major player...

654
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,032
in one of the most dangerous
and powerful organizations...

655
01:11:51,032 --> 01:11:52,867
We've never even heard of.

656
01:11:52,867 --> 01:11:56,244
Foreign policy cannot be conducted
on the basis of hunches and inuendo.

657
01:11:56,244 --> 01:12:00,541
Then give us time to gather enough evidence
so you can make informed decisions.

658
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:02,333
Fine.

659
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:05,252
Say you're right...
say Greene is a villain.

660
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:09,422
If we refused to do business with villains
we'd have almost no one to trade with.

661
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:14,051
The world is running out of oil, M...
The Russians aren't playing ball...

662
01:12:14,051 --> 01:12:16,512
the Americans and Chinese are
dividing up what's left.

663
01:12:16,512 --> 01:12:22,018
Right or wrong doesn't come into it.
We're acting out of necessity.

664
01:12:24,228 --> 01:12:30,442
Bond... is running wild.
Who's to say he hasn't been turned?

665
01:12:30,525 --> 01:12:32,527
Pull him in...

666
01:12:32,694 --> 01:12:35,947
or the Americans will put him down.

667
01:12:37,907 --> 01:12:40,118
I think I've found a way out.

668
01:12:40,284 --> 01:12:42,493
You're freezing.

669
01:12:42,911 --> 01:12:44,579
I'm fine.

670
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:03,637
So what is it
that Greene has that you want?

671
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:12,979
It's not Greene, it's Medrano...
the man you met in Haiti.

672
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:17,734
My father...
worked for the Military Junta.

673
01:13:17,734 --> 01:13:20,235
He was a very cruel man.

674
01:13:21,362 --> 01:13:23,698
But he was my father.

675
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:32,622
When I was a small child, the opposition
sent General Medrano to our house.

676
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:40,921
He shot my father... he did things
to my mother and my sister...

677
01:13:41,796 --> 01:13:46,259
and then strangled them
while I watched.

678
01:13:46,717 --> 01:13:50,012
I was too young to be any trouble.

679
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:53,641
So he just smiled at me...

680
01:13:55,226 --> 01:13:57,936
and set the house on fire.

681
01:14:00,271 --> 01:14:02,858
He left his mark.

682
01:14:05,777 --> 01:14:07,737
So, when I pulled you
off the boat...

683
01:14:07,737 --> 01:14:10,864
I waited years for that chance.

684
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,201
I apologize.

685
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:17,996
Seems, we're both using
Greene to get to somebody.

686
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:22,042
You lost somebody?

687
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,335
I did, yes.

688
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:27,046
You catch whoever did it?

689
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,966
No... not yet.

690
01:14:30,423 --> 01:14:33,176
Tell me when you do...

691
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:36,220
I'd like to know how it feels.

692
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,685
We should go.

693
01:14:43,101 --> 01:14:44,686
You ready?

694
01:15:17,716 --> 01:15:20,135
They've used dynamite.

695
01:15:22,804 --> 01:15:25,347
This used to be a river bed.

696
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:45,992
Greene isn't after the oil,
he wants the water.

697
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,493
We can't leave it like this.

698
01:15:48,493 --> 01:15:50,162
It's one dam.

699
01:15:50,162 --> 01:15:53,748
He's creating a drought...
And he'll build others.

700
01:17:22,493 --> 01:17:24,537
Excuse me sir...
your wife left a message.

701
01:17:24,537 --> 01:17:27,498
The English woman.
She left it for you this morning.

702
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:29,542
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

703
01:17:31,627 --> 01:17:33,253
What is it?

704
01:17:34,546 --> 01:17:36,591
Would you mind waiting down here?

705
01:17:36,841 --> 01:17:39,217
I'll be outside.

706
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:00,069
So that's what she meant?

707
01:18:00,403 --> 01:18:02,238
I hope you can trust
these men.

708
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:04,490
Just a moment...
It's Tanner.

709
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,659
Yes?

710
01:18:07,702 --> 01:18:09,161
We've got the girl downstairs...

711
01:18:09,161 --> 01:18:11,662
She says to tell you she's sorry
but this is not her fight.

712
01:18:11,662 --> 01:18:13,122
It isn't... let her go.

713
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:15,167
She isn't our concern.

714
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,585
Well, I'm disappointed.

715
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:19,587
You are?

716
01:18:19,587 --> 01:18:21,756
How much oil
did the Americans promise you?

717
01:18:21,756 --> 01:18:24,007
- This isn't about oil.
- Well, that's good, there isn't any.

718
01:18:24,007 --> 01:18:25,760
It's about trust.

719
01:18:25,885 --> 01:18:27,969
You said you weren't motivated
by revenge.

720
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:29,637
I'm motivated by my duty.

721
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:31,180
No.

722
01:18:31,389 --> 01:18:36,060
I think you're so blinded by inconsolable
rage that you don't care who you hurt.

723
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:40,439
When you can't tell your friends
from your enemies it's time to go.

724
01:18:48,195 --> 01:18:51,615
You might like to still hold your
theory about there being no oil.

725
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,909
Her lungs are full of it.

726
01:18:55,284 --> 01:18:56,411
It was Greene.

727
01:18:56,411 --> 01:18:58,372
No doubt. But Why?

728
01:18:59,247 --> 01:19:02,292
- It's just misdirection...
- I mean... why her Bond?

729
01:19:02,292 --> 01:19:04,167
She was just supposed
to send you home.

730
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:07,755
She worked in an office...
collecting reports.

731
01:19:08,213 --> 01:19:11,259
Look how well
your charm works, James.

732
01:19:11,259 --> 01:19:14,301
They'll do anything for you,
won't they?

733
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:16,887
How many is that now?

734
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:20,225
You're removed from duty and suspended
pending further investigation.

735
01:19:20,266 --> 01:19:23,853
You'll give whatever weapons you have
to have these men and leave with them now.

736
01:20:10,728 --> 01:20:12,188
Miss Fields showed true bravery.

737
01:20:12,188 --> 01:20:14,439
I want that mentioned
in your report.

738
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:16,274
Now, you and I
need to see this through.

739
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:17,734
There's nowhere to go.

740
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:20,194
There's a capture
or kill order out on you.

741
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:22,905
Who would have done that?

742
01:20:32,663 --> 01:20:34,291
Ma'am?
Find out where he's going.

743
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:36,292
- He's on to something.
- Ma'am, the CIA is insisting...

744
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:38,793
I don't give a shit about the CIA,
or their trumped up evidence.

745
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:41,213
He is my agent.
And I trust him.

746
01:20:41,213 --> 01:20:42,715
Go on.

747
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:55,060
Get in.

748
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:56,644
You're gonna try to shoot me?

749
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:58,520
I said, get in.

750
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:15,868
You'll be getting botulism
if you keep drinking that.

751
01:21:15,868 --> 01:21:18,579
It's bottled water.

752
01:21:18,997 --> 01:21:21,667
It probably came from some stream
just around the corner from here...

753
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:24,168
a bunch of little kids
peein' in it.

754
01:21:25,336 --> 01:21:28,922
- That's why I eat the peppers.
- Well, all I'm sayin' is...

755
01:21:28,922 --> 01:21:31,926
you can't trust a damn thing
around here.

756
01:21:35,929 --> 01:21:37,805
Lincoln Exportar, buenos noches.

757
01:21:38,014 --> 01:21:40,432
You know when someone calls, you can
just tell 'em it's the "CIA", Felix.

758
01:21:40,432 --> 01:21:43,018
A taxi driver told me
where your office was.

759
01:21:43,018 --> 01:21:45,645
Well, if it's so easy
to find, James...

760
01:21:45,645 --> 01:21:47,898
you really should come visit.

761
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:51,359
Or maybe you should go out
and see some more of the city.

762
01:22:12,545 --> 01:22:14,296
I heard a rumor you'd gone native.

763
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,256
Felix.

764
01:22:16,256 --> 01:22:18,717
- żQué le gusta?
- Una cerveza, por favor.

765
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:22,845
You know, I was just wondering
what South America would look like...

766
01:22:22,845 --> 01:22:24,972
if nobody gave a damn
about coke or communism.

767
01:22:24,972 --> 01:22:27,600
It always impressed me the way
you boys would carve this place up.

768
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,185
I'll take that as a compliment
coming from a Brit.

769
01:22:32,354 --> 01:22:34,773
Are you sure you're playing
with the right side?

770
01:22:35,274 --> 01:22:37,359
Regimes change
once a week down here.

771
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:39,569
Medrano will be no dirtier
than the next guy.

772
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:41,570
Oh you see, that's what I like
about U.S. intelligence...

773
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:44,407
- you'll lie down with anybody.
- Including you brother.

774
01:22:44,407 --> 01:22:47,993
- Including you.
- Do you know you're being played?

775
01:22:47,993 --> 01:22:50,787
Dominic Greene is gonna suck this
place dry and then he's gonna move on...

776
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:52,997
and you're gonna be left
picking up the broken crockery...

777
01:22:52,997 --> 01:22:55,751
What can I tell you, there's
no such thing as a free lunch.

778
01:22:55,751 --> 01:22:59,086
You see Felix, I do not think you're
half as cynical as you make out to be.

779
01:22:59,086 --> 01:23:01,255
You don't know me.

780
01:23:01,963 --> 01:23:04,175
Why?...

781
01:23:04,175 --> 01:23:06,176
Just because you didn't come alone?

782
01:23:06,594 --> 01:23:09,805
- How long have I got?
- 30 seconds.

783
01:23:11,096 --> 01:23:13,140
Well, that doesn't give us
a lotta time, does it?

784
01:23:15,435 --> 01:23:18,770
Medrano can't move until he pays
off the army and the police chief.

785
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:21,481
Greene's bringing him
his money now at the hotel called...

786
01:23:21,481 --> 01:23:25,360
"Pérola de las Dunas",
in the desert.

787
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,362
Thank you, Felix.

788
01:23:27,362 --> 01:23:29,279
James!
Move your ass!

789
01:23:54,802 --> 01:23:57,514
What the hell happened?
What did you tell him?

790
01:23:57,514 --> 01:23:59,474
Just what we agreed.

791
01:25:23,048 --> 01:25:24,966
What're you doing?

792
01:25:26,802 --> 01:25:28,427
It slides cocked.

793
01:25:29,512 --> 01:25:31,680
Maybe you should check your own.

794
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:33,682
I will.

795
01:25:38,354 --> 01:25:40,814
Have you ever killed someone?

796
01:25:44,318 --> 01:25:48,113
The training will tell you that when the
adrenalin kicks in, you should compensate.

797
01:25:49,197 --> 01:25:53,368
But part of you is not gonna believe in the
training because this kill here is personal.

798
01:25:54,953 --> 01:25:57,328
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

799
01:25:57,328 --> 01:25:59,122
You only need one shot.

800
01:25:59,122 --> 01:26:01,457
Make it count.

801
01:26:11,425 --> 01:26:13,802
General, he is here.

802
01:26:14,344 --> 01:26:16,930
- The time has come, General.
- Let's go.

803
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:04,722
- Welcome.
- How are you?

804
01:27:08,059 --> 01:27:11,854
In Euros... as requested.

805
01:27:11,854 --> 01:27:14,481
The Dollar isn't what it once was.

806
01:27:14,481 --> 01:27:16,567
The cost of war.

807
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:21,362
Yes, I'm afraid that the corruption
in this current Government...

808
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:22,947
can no longer be tolerated

809
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:25,783
Presidente?

810
01:27:25,783 --> 01:27:27,493
And mine?

811
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:30,287
You'll get that as soon
as you sign over my land.

812
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:48,886
My first official act.

813
01:27:54,309 --> 01:27:55,976
And this, if you would.

814
01:27:56,394 --> 01:27:57,978
What is this?

815
01:27:57,978 --> 01:28:00,855
As of this moment,
my organization owns...

816
01:28:00,855 --> 01:28:04,527
more than 60%
of Bolivia's water supply.

817
01:28:04,527 --> 01:28:07,987
And this contract states
that your new government...

818
01:28:07,987 --> 01:28:11,824
will use us as utilities provider.

819
01:28:11,908 --> 01:28:15,036
This is double
what we're paying now.

820
01:28:18,204 --> 01:28:20,666
Oh... well, then don't sign it!

821
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:26,921
But you should know something about me
and the people I work with.

822
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:33,094
We deal with the left or the right,
with dictators or liberators.

823
01:28:33,386 --> 01:28:38,180
If the current president had been more
agreeable, I wouldn't be talking to you.

824
01:28:38,265 --> 01:28:42,269
So, if you decide not to sign,
you'll wake up with your balls...

825
01:28:42,269 --> 01:28:46,771
in your mouth and your willing
replacement standing over you.

826
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:51,609
If you doubt that then shoot me,
take that money...

827
01:28:51,609 --> 01:28:54,779
and have a good night's sleep.

828
01:29:53,748 --> 01:29:56,585
You and I had a mutual friend.

829
01:32:46,362 --> 01:32:49,197
Sounds like
you just lost another one.

830
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:03,512
Not this way, not this way!
I can't... I can't.

831
01:34:21,613 --> 01:34:23,238
Make your shot.

832
01:34:23,238 --> 01:34:25,324
Take a deep breath.

833
01:34:26,117 --> 01:34:28,453
Make it count.

834
01:34:43,841 --> 01:34:45,551
Come on!

835
01:34:59,563 --> 01:35:01,564
Wait here.

836
01:35:32,551 --> 01:35:34,554
You promised that you...

837
01:35:34,554 --> 01:35:36,387
Let you go?

838
01:35:36,595 --> 01:35:39,306
I answered your questions.

839
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:42,435
I told you what you wanted to know
about Quantum.

840
01:35:42,435 --> 01:35:43,811
Yes, you did.

841
01:35:43,811 --> 01:35:47,230
And your friends would know that,
so they're probably be looking for you.

842
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:48,606
But the good news is...

843
01:35:48,606 --> 01:35:50,650
you're in the middle of the desert.

844
01:35:54,654 --> 01:35:56,197
Here.

845
01:35:57,657 --> 01:36:01,411
I bet you make it 20 miles
before you consider drinking that.

846
01:36:01,411 --> 01:36:03,494
Goodbye, Mr. Greene.

847
01:36:43,238 --> 01:36:44,823
Thank you.

848
01:36:44,823 --> 01:36:46,576
It's my pleasure.

849
01:36:47,827 --> 01:36:49,496
Are you alright?

850
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:51,788
I'm fine.

851
01:36:51,829 --> 01:36:56,417
But I keep thinking, he's dead,
and now what?

852
01:36:56,417 --> 01:36:59,087
Well, the dam we saw
will have to come down.

853
01:36:59,087 --> 01:37:00,296
And there'll be others too...

854
01:37:00,337 --> 01:37:02,756
someone who worked for Greene
might be of help.

855
01:37:03,925 --> 01:37:06,094
Not a bad idea.

856
01:37:10,596 --> 01:37:13,265
Do you think I'll be able
to sleep now?

857
01:37:15,685 --> 01:37:18,688
I don't think the dead
care about vengence.

858
01:37:21,314 --> 01:37:24,734
I wish... I could set you free.

859
01:37:28,195 --> 01:37:30,864
But your prison is in there.

860
01:38:21,618 --> 01:38:26,164
Fine, anything for an easy life.

861
01:38:27,373 --> 01:38:28,708
Sit down.

862
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,627
Sit down!

863
01:38:32,296 --> 01:38:34,046
It's okay, baby.

864
01:38:50,645 --> 01:38:53,021
You're Canadian?

865
01:38:53,021 --> 01:38:55,315
You work in Canadian intelligence?

866
01:38:55,315 --> 01:38:57,943
It's all right, I know you do.

867
01:38:57,943 --> 01:39:00,237
And knowing this man..

868
01:39:00,237 --> 01:39:02,654
I guess you have access
to some very sensitive material...

869
01:39:02,654 --> 01:39:04,615
which you will be forced
to give up.

870
01:39:04,615 --> 01:39:05,992
His life will be threatened...

871
01:39:05,992 --> 01:39:09,287
and because you love him...
you won't hesitate.

872
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:11,997
That's a beautiful necklace.

873
01:39:12,538 --> 01:39:14,707
Did he give it to you?

874
01:39:16,377 --> 01:39:19,212
I have one just like it...

875
01:39:21,797 --> 01:39:24,300
He gave it to a friend of mine.

876
01:39:24,341 --> 01:39:27,552
Someone very close to me.

877
01:39:29,554 --> 01:39:31,555
- Your name is?
- Corine.

878
01:39:31,555 --> 01:39:33,182
Corine.

879
01:39:33,391 --> 01:39:36,144
Corine, I suggest you leave now,
you contact your people...

880
01:39:36,144 --> 01:39:39,438
and you tell them to check
their seals they have a leak.

881
01:39:39,563 --> 01:39:41,815
Do it now, please.

882
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:45,819
This man and I
have some unfinished business.

883
01:39:56,078 --> 01:39:57,704
Thank you.

884
01:40:01,792 --> 01:40:03,543
Please.

885
01:40:03,752 --> 01:40:05,796
Make it quick.

886
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:16,430
He is still alive?

887
01:40:16,430 --> 01:40:17,889
He is.

888
01:40:18,097 --> 01:40:19,765
I'm surprised.

889
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,103
Did you find what you were looking for?

890
01:40:23,103 --> 01:40:24,979
- Yes.
- Good.

891
01:40:25,854 --> 01:40:28,733
- I assume you have no regrets.
- I don't.

892
01:40:28,858 --> 01:40:30,525
What about you?

893
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:33,487
Of course not.
It would be unprofessional.

894
01:40:34,988 --> 01:40:38,867
They found Greene dead in the middle
of the Bolivian desert, of all places.

895
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:41,411
Two bullets in the back of his skull.

896
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:44,203
They found motor oil
in his stomach.

897
01:40:44,203 --> 01:40:45,913
Does that mean anything to you?

898
01:40:45,913 --> 01:40:47,123
I wish I could help.

899
01:40:47,123 --> 01:40:48,250
You'll be glad to know...

900
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,377
I straightened things out
with the Americans.

901
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:52,795
Your friend Leiter
has been promoted.

902
01:40:52,795 --> 01:40:54,130
He'll replace Beam.

903
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,548
Well then, the right people
kept their jobs.

904
01:40:56,548 --> 01:40:58,509
Something like that.

905
01:40:59,969 --> 01:41:02,220
Congratulations, you were right.

906
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,014
About what?

907
01:41:04,765 --> 01:41:06,725
About Vesper.

908
01:41:08,518 --> 01:41:10,395
Ma'am!

909
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,148
Bond.

910
01:41:14,774 --> 01:41:16,734
I need you back.

911
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:19,653
I never left.
