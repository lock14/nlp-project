1
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:16,846
When I was a child winter
didn't feel so cold.

2
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:26,323
It's nearly two months since
I moved home from Tokyo.

3
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:32,858
It's been an awkward time.

4
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:46,236
(In Mourning)

5
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:49,484
This way.

6
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:53,688
Excuse us.

7
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:07,301
Please accept our condolences.

8
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,174
We are here for the encoffinment.

9
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:14,110
May we offer incense?

10
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,704
Please do.

11
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,602
She looks alive.

12
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,480
Suicide by charcoal.

13
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,383
How do you know?

14
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:54,680
No agony.

15
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:59,913
And they probably found her right away.

16
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:06,286
Too bad... she's beautiful.

17
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:10,359
Want to do it?

18
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:15,962
All right.

19
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,211
The rite of encoffinment
is to prepare the deceased

20
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:26,181
for a peaceful departure.

21
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:28,615
Please come closer and watch.

22
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,941
I will now wipe the body.

23
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:08,877
She's got one.

24
00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:10,146
Got what?

25
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,442
A thing.

26
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:13,682
What thing?

27
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,310
A 'thing'!

28
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,531
Excuse me...

29
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:04,500
Yes?

30
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,630
Once the departed is dressed,
we will apply make-up.

31
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,377
We have make-up for
women, or for men...

32
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:17,038
Oh... just a minute.

33
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:22,184
How'd you like Tomeo made up, Sis?

34
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,447
Boy, or girl?

35
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,524
What'll it be?

36
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:36,831
If I'd only had him as a girl
at the first, none of this...

37
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,163
would've happened.

38
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,307
Girl, then?

39
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:46,331
Yes.

40
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,511
As a girl, please.

41
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,773
Certainly.

42
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,922
Tomeo!

43
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:22,706
Departures

44
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:17,993
Another empty house.

45
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:22,191
We should advertise more.

46
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:25,033
I know!

47
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,936
An orchestra website.

48
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:31,407
My wife's a web designer.
She'd do it for free.

49
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:34,677
Forget that, Daigo. Are you OK?

50
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,811
Huh?

51
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:36,912
Your next gig.

52
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:38,013
Next?

53
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,710
You'll need a job to pay
off a cello like that.

54
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:46,216
Well done, everybody.

55
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,525
The audience was a little sparse,

56
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,153
but you played wonderfully.

57
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:59,058
However, as it turns out...

58
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:06,241
the owner of this
orchestra, Mr Sonezaki,

59
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,610
has a few words to say.

60
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,341
So if you would please
give him your attention...

61
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:27,827
The orchestra is dissolved.

62
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,167
See you.

63
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,076
The orchestra job

64
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,580
I'd finally managed to land...

65
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,174
in a flash was not
history, only a memory.

66
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,717
It wasn't the cello's fault.

67
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:59,359
I shouldn't have bought
it. Now I'd lost my job.

68
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,498
In many ways that cello...

69
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:05,865
had been too much for me.

70
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,928
Thank you!

71
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,839
Goodbye.

72
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:17,413
I'm home!

73
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:18,606
Hi.

74
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:20,443
I got an octopus.

75
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,880
From the neighbor.

76
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:27,312
Caught this morning.

77
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:33,284
What's the matter?

78
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:37,424
We're dissolved.

79
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,899
Who?

80
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:42,369
The orchestra.

81
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,602
Oh...

82
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,710
You'll find another one.

83
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,840
There won't be one.

84
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:02,990
I'm not good enough.

85
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:07,422
And I owe for that.

86
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,567
How much?

87
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,208
That's OK.

88
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,513
I'm working. We can
pay off a million yen.

89
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,880
18 million.

90
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,349
18 million yen!

91
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,745
That's what all the pros
pay. Maybe even more.

92
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,392
Why did you hide that?

93
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,697
I thought you'd say no.

94
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:51,735
But something that important...
why didn't you tell me?

95
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,865
I'm sorry.

96
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,043
I'll make supper.

97
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,125
'The world's cities will be our home.

98
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:20,024
'Come tour with me.'

99
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:24,365
That's how I proposed.

100
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,341
But reality was harsh.

101
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:35,375
No. I should have realized
the limits to my talent.

102
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:42,317
What's wrong?

103
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,788
It's alive!

104
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,697
Yeah!

105
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:52,496
What should we do?!

106
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,239
Don't get caught again.

107
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,606
Huh?

108
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:37,010
I should quit.

109
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,446
What?

110
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:42,811
Cello.

111
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,345
And do what?

112
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:53,686
Go back up to Yamagata.

113
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:00,897
Agreed!

114
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,404
You don't mind?

115
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:11,712
We can live free in the
house your mother left you.

116
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,703
It's really OK?

117
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:28,263
This was my great turning point...

118
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:32,893
but in a strange way, selling
the cello was a relief.

119
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:38,999
I felt freed from ties that
had bound me for so long.

120
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:43,678
What I'd always taken as my dream

121
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:46,614
maybe hadn't been one after all.

122
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,894
'Harmony'

123
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,965
This was all my mother had left me

124
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:05,455
when she'd died two years before.

125
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:11,895
My father had run a coffee shop here...

126
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:15,736
but I hardly remembered it.

127
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:20,382
After he deserted us...

128
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:23,646
she ran it as a small bar...

129
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:27,719
and raised me alone.

130
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,817
Supper's ready!

131
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:34,059
Coming!

132
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:44,605
I thought you'd hate it here.

133
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,096
No! Everything's so new.

134
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:51,137
Rice tastes better.
Maybe it's the water.

135
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:56,718
Maybe I should open a shop...

136
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:58,151
What kind?

137
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,625
Hey!

138
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:09,964
This ad. 'No age
restriction, good salary.

139
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:14,001
'Short working hours,
full-time employee.'

140
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,936
'NK Agent'... what's that?

141
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:22,277
'Working with departures.'
A travel agency, maybe.

142
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:23,868
A tour guide?

143
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:28,782
'No experience necessary.'
I'll give them a call.

144
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,574
Here.

145
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:02,875
NK Agent

146
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:05,451
Hello?

147
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:10,726
Is this NK Agent?

148
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:11,817
Yes.

149
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,321
I'm Kobayashi. I called earlier.

150
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:18,099
For the interview?

151
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,801
The boss'll be right back. Have a seat.

152
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:23,531
Thank you.

153
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:40,412
I was against the boss
putting an ad in the paper.

154
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:45,394
It's hard finding people for this.

155
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:49,762
What sort of company would this be?

156
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,567
You mean you don't know?

157
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:56,164
It said 'departures'...

158
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:03,141
No?

159
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:14,823
The man's here about the job.

160
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:18,593
Hello. I phoned this morning.

161
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,253
Oh, you...

162
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:23,765
So you're not depressing...

163
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,599
Thank you.

164
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,365
I knew an ad would work. Make some tea.

165
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:35,176
My resume...

166
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:36,611
Good. Sit down.

167
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,169
Thank you.

168
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:48,457
Will you work hard?

169
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,325
Uh... yes.

170
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:51,492
You're hired.

171
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:53,228
What's your name?

172
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:54,429
'Daigo Kobayashi'.

173
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:56,131
Get him some cards.

174
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,325
OK.

175
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:02,336
But what about salary
and stuff like that?

176
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:07,509
Oh... how about one hand to start?

177
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,737
'One hand'?

178
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:13,147
50,000?

179
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,750
500.

180
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,785
500,000?!

181
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:17,586
Too low?

182
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:19,488
You pay that much?

183
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,323
In cash, if you want.

184
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,655
What does the job involve?

185
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,887
Well...

186
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:33,567
At first, being my assistant, I guess.

187
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,057
Specifically...

188
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,432
'Specifically'?

189
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:39,540
Casketing.

190
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,209
'Casketing'?

191
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,836
Putting bodies in coffins.

192
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:46,739
It bloomed!

193
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:50,947
You mean 'dead bodies'?

194
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:55,555
That's really funny.

195
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,596
Uh, no, I mean...

196
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:06,468
The ad said 'departures',
so I thought it meant...

197
00:22:06,468 --> 00:22:09,471
a travel agency.

198
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:10,838
That's a misprint.

199
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:16,344
It's not 'departures', it's...

200
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:19,614
'the departed'.

201
00:22:19,614 --> 00:22:21,582
The departed?!

202
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:26,413
'NK' stands for [nokan], 'casketing'.

203
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:31,125
Anyway, fate brought you here.

204
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:35,392
Give it a try. Quit
if you don't like it.

205
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,034
Today's pay.

206
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:39,968
No, I couldn't...

207
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:40,769
It's fine.

208
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,463
No, no...

209
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:04,051
I'm back.

210
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,183
Hi.

211
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:08,829
Here.

212
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:09,964
What's that?

213
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:12,661
You said you wanted sukiyaki.

214
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:15,703
Yonezawa beef?!

215
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:16,872
Grade A.

216
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:19,840
That's expensive!

217
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,742
I got an advance.

218
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:23,836
You got the job?

219
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,512
Sort of.

220
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:28,413
So we're celebrating!

221
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,753
So what's the job? A tour guide?

222
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:34,118
No...

223
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:35,916
Sales?

224
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:40,354
What?

225
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,230
It's not a travel agent.

226
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,161
So what is it?

227
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:49,770
Ceremonies.

228
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,467
Like weddings?

229
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:56,337
Maybe you can play cello for them.

230
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:00,505
I'll get the sukiyaki ready.

231
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:02,709
OK.

232
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,028
I won't be too late.

233
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:25,970
'Bye.

234
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,691
'Morning.

235
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,537
Here I am.

236
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,173
Use the boss's desk till yours comes.

237
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:10,182
Your business cards
are done. No misprints.

238
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:32,101
They're just coffins.

239
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,174
They're the first I've seen.

240
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:36,044
The first?

241
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:39,413
My grandparents died
before I can remember.

242
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:43,884
I was abroad when my mom
died, so I missed her funeral.

243
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:45,319
And your dad?

244
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:48,049
He left us when I was six.

245
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,528
That must have been hard for your mom.

246
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:10,778
Can someone who's never seen a corpse

247
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,747
actually do this job?

248
00:26:12,747 --> 00:26:14,907
You'll get used to it.

249
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:19,675
To corpses?

250
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:26,884
It's slow now in the summer,
but when the seasons change...

251
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:28,855
I'll help.

252
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:32,800
...it's one job after another.

253
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,269
Who hires us?

254
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:35,326
Undertakers.

255
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:38,231
Undertakers?

256
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:43,545
It used to be that families
prepared the bodies.

257
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:46,881
Then undertakers took it on...

258
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:50,984
and places like ours started up.

259
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,421
It's a niche market.

260
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,089
They're heavy.

261
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,657
There's different types.

262
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:01,695
50,000.

263
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:02,497
100,000.

264
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,964
300,000.

265
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:05,500
They're that different?

266
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,637
That's plywood, this one has
gold fittings and carved sides.

267
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:14,843
And this one's pure hinoki cypress.

268
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,144
So it's the wood and the fittings...

269
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:21,982
Yep. They burn the same
way, into the same ashes.

270
00:27:21,982 --> 00:27:25,586
Your last purchase, and
someone else chooses it.

271
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,316
It's ironic.

272
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,227
NK Agent...

273
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,260
Yes, he's here.

274
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:42,057
The Minatoza? He'll be right there.

275
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:45,973
The boss?

276
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:47,066
A job.

277
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:50,837
A job?

278
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,523
(Minatoza Theater)

279
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,025
NK Agent?

280
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,226
Yes.

281
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:39,453
He's here.

282
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,019
Oh, good.

283
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:50,238
This is my new assistant, uh...

284
00:28:50,238 --> 00:28:50,904
'Kobayashi'.

285
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:54,275
Kobayashi. He'll be our model today.

286
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,798
Model?

287
00:28:57,744 --> 00:29:02,383
We'll start shooting as
soon as you get changed.

288
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:05,619
Costume and make-up's over here.

289
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,779
Make-up?

290
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:11,192
Sir...

291
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:12,594
It's fine.

292
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:14,528
Let's start.

293
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:22,160
(Casketing Procedure)

294
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:32,141
The model's ready!

295
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:45,058
Good.

296
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:48,462
Where will this be shown?

297
00:29:48,462 --> 00:29:50,131
It's fine.

298
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:54,534
It's just for the
trade. No one'll see it.

299
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:07,403
The first step in casketing
is washing of the body.

300
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:14,489
This washes away the weariness,
pain, and cares of this world...

301
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:20,553
and represents the first bath
for one newborn in the next.

302
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:27,035
In olden times, a
wash-cloth was used for this,

303
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:30,003
but now, for reasons of hygiene,

304
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:33,940
a sterilized cloth is used

305
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:36,973
to wipe...

306
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:41,778
the body.

307
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:49,356
To preserve dignity, take great care

308
00:30:49,356 --> 00:30:53,461
that family members do not see

309
00:30:53,461 --> 00:30:56,896
the bare skin of the deceased.

310
00:31:05,673 --> 00:31:08,009
Once the body is dressed,

311
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:12,113
the face is shaved
before make-up is applied.

312
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:18,452
Especially with men, facial
hair will be more apparent

313
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:22,222
due to tissue contraction
and drying of the skin

314
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:25,056
so great care must be taken.

315
00:31:28,695 --> 00:31:33,134
Necrotic skin is extremely fragile.

316
00:31:33,134 --> 00:31:37,833
Even the pressure of
a finger can break it.

317
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:43,877
For this reason, we must proceed...

318
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:47,048
with very great care...

319
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:51,885
Ow! Ow!

320
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:59,426
Ow!

321
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:00,894
He's bleeding!

322
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:03,686
Ow!

323
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:06,867
It's fine.

324
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:08,893
It's just a scratch.

325
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,740
Hi.

326
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:24,782
What?

327
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:27,585
Your face...

328
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,326
The boss wanted me shaved.

329
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,384
You shaved at work?

330
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,628
But you only ever use an electric razor.

331
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:43,671
The boss said to.

332
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,406
It's just a scratch.

333
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:48,241
That's weird.

334
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:52,337
Yeah, it's a weird place.

335
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:02,478
Suddenly, my first case.

336
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,756
What should I do?

337
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,329
Today...

338
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:18,172
just watch.

339
00:33:18,172 --> 00:33:19,638
All right.

340
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:22,974
But it's one of those.

341
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,236
You picked a bad one.

342
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:29,746
What do you mean?

343
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:34,788
You'll see.

344
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,983
Don't scare me!

345
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,602
Here we are.

346
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:49,470
Ah, good.

347
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,164
Where's the body?

348
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:54,375
Old lady, lived alone.

349
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,109
Dead two weeks.

350
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:59,180
She's in pretty bad shape.

351
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,613
See you later.

352
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,607
Who's that?

353
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:10,184
The undertaker. Our employer.

354
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:15,291
Let's get to work.

355
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:22,427
It stinks!

356
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:47,186
Come on.

357
00:34:55,503 --> 00:34:56,969
Give me a hand.

358
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,121
Get her legs.

359
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,056
Her legs!

360
00:35:22,063 --> 00:35:23,324
Right.

361
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:32,306
You said just to watch.

362
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:35,764
Gently, gently...

363
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:40,643
Hold her tighter!

364
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:16,746
Take the day off.

365
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:25,623
That was a bit much for your first job.

366
00:36:58,324 --> 00:37:00,894
Did you eat something weird?

367
00:37:00,894 --> 00:37:01,628
No.

368
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:03,130
Something stinks.

369
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,498
Your scarf!

370
00:37:04,498 --> 00:37:06,467
It does not!

371
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:08,094
No?

372
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,074
- Hey...
- What?

373
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:15,735
That guy in the suit...

374
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,213
Next stop, Minami-Ginza.

00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:24,115
(Tsurunoyu Public Bath)

376
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:30,414
It's still here!

377
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:51,405
Just leave it there.

378
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,552
300 yen.

379
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:00,121
Thanks.

380
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:01,782
Towel's 100 yen.

381
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:41,489
You'll get a good price now!

382
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,931
I'm not quitting!

383
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,333
Go away!

384
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,503
It's for your own good, Ma!

385
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:52,139
Get back to your city hall.

386
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:55,376
I'm not that old yet.

387
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,077
Am I, Shiori?

388
00:38:58,077 --> 00:39:01,181
Can I come again for the big bath?

389
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:03,016
Of course!

390
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:08,818
I'll keep this bath-house
going just for you!

391
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:11,525
Daigo?

392
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:13,092
Yamashita...

393
00:39:13,092 --> 00:39:15,929
Why didn't you tell me you're back?

394
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:19,422
Sorry. It's been a bit crazy.

395
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:25,338
Well! If it's not the
Kobayashi boy Daigo!

396
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:27,007
It's been a while.

397
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:31,478
That it has!

398
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:35,315
That's quite the job you found yourself!

399
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:38,552
Huh? Uh, yeah...

400
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,855
What's that thing he plays?

401
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:43,224
The cello. A great big violin.

402
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:45,458
That's it, a cello!

403
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,827
That gentleman's really something.

404
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:51,331
He plays the cello in Tokyo!

405
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:53,094
Wow!

406
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,173
I wish my son had talent!

407
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:02,039
Ma!

408
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:05,646
This isn't a good time.
We'll have a drink.

409
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:07,213
OK.

410
00:40:07,213 --> 00:40:10,550
Bring the wife along.
You're married, aren't you?

411
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,518
Yes.

412
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:14,221
When this fool's not here.

413
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:16,222
And who gave birth to this fool?

414
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:19,326
Anyway, I'm not selling!

415
00:40:19,326 --> 00:40:22,318
There!

416
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:23,931
Mate?

417
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,365
Mate.

418
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:27,266
I win.

419
00:40:56,096 --> 00:40:57,757
Anything wrong?

420
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:02,898
Let's eat.

421
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:11,110
Mrs Fujii next door gave us this.

422
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:16,742
Fresh-killed this morning.
You could eat it raw.

423
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:30,226
Not quite yet...

424
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:39,804
Are you OK?

425
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:49,748
Are you OK?

426
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,219
What?

427
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,141
What's the matter?

428
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:36,427
What's wrong with you?

429
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:43,637
Hey!

430
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:45,467
No, Daigo, don't!

431
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:53,105
Not here!

432
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:01,077
Daigo?

433
00:43:10,097 --> 00:43:12,132
Hey...

434
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,963
Mika!

435
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:41,893
Was this a trial I was being put through

436
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:47,826
for not looking after my mother?

437
00:43:49,603 --> 00:43:51,764
Where was I going?

438
00:43:56,577 --> 00:44:02,344
I suddenly wanted to play the cello.

439
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:09,789
I just wanted to play the
cello and let memory rewind.

440
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,489
It's tiny!

441
00:48:58,043 --> 00:48:59,806
Salmon?

442
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,240
Oh... yes.

443
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:11,148
There, by those rocks.

444
00:49:13,726 --> 00:49:16,559
Go! Go!

445
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:25,501
Sad, isn't it. Coming
all this way just to die.

446
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:29,469
It doesn't seem worth it.

447
00:49:31,978 --> 00:49:38,177
They want to come home.
Back to where they were born.

448
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:14,945
Let's go eat.

449
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:21,289
The boss says to.

450
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,168
Why...

451
00:50:28,168 --> 00:50:30,465
did you take this road?

452
00:50:33,706 --> 00:50:35,842
Fate.

453
00:50:35,842 --> 00:50:38,072
Yeah, right!

454
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:43,043
You were born to do this.

455
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,148
That's fine for you to say!

456
00:50:57,697 --> 00:51:01,929
I'm very, very sorry!

457
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:11,501
He's mad!

458
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:14,847
Mr Sasaki, please!

459
00:51:14,847 --> 00:51:15,974
I'm sorry.

460
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,880
You're late!

461
00:51:21,054 --> 00:51:22,489
Five minutes late!

462
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:24,056
I'm very sorry.

463
00:51:24,056 --> 00:51:27,494
You make your living on the dead.

464
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:29,085
Stop it!

465
00:51:29,195 --> 00:51:30,594
Move it!

466
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:35,626
I apologize.

467
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:47,826
May I have your wife's
favorite lipstick?

468
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:54,228
Huh?

469
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:16,579
One grown cold, restored
to beauty for all eternity.

470
00:55:17,824 --> 00:55:23,630
This was done with a
calmness, a precision

471
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:27,565
and above all, a gentle affection.

472
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:33,398
At the final parting,
sending the dead on their way

473
00:55:33,972 --> 00:55:40,969
everything done
peacefully, and beautifully.

474
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:49,882
Thank you.

475
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,835
I will now affix the lid.

476
00:56:01,835 --> 00:56:03,530
Naomi!

477
00:56:17,784 --> 00:56:19,547
Naomi...

478
00:56:38,003 --> 00:56:39,800
Naomi!

479
00:56:58,992 --> 00:57:01,755
Excuse me!

480
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:06,099
I'm sorry about what I said.

481
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:08,498
No. We were late.

482
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:12,528
Please have this.

483
00:57:13,405 --> 00:57:14,929
Thank you.

484
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:19,112
She'd...

485
00:57:19,112 --> 00:57:22,342
never looked so beautiful.

486
00:57:25,284 --> 00:57:28,742
Thank you very much.

487
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:10,117
Nothing.

488
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:45,586
Come in.

489
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,766
Good evening.

490
00:58:51,336 --> 00:58:52,804
Good evening.

491
00:58:56,175 --> 00:58:57,275
Don't tell me...

492
00:58:57,275 --> 00:58:59,402
Yes. My wife.

493
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:03,010
How do you do.

494
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,619
Isn't she a dear!

495
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:08,985
You're too kind.

496
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:14,693
Go into the bath and get warm.

497
00:59:14,693 --> 00:59:17,423
Thank you.

498
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,793
'Evening.

499
00:59:25,704 --> 00:59:27,764
Oh, hello.

500
00:59:29,409 --> 00:59:31,610
You always come here?

501
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,101
For 50 years.

502
00:59:36,382 --> 00:59:41,186
I see... well...

503
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:44,190
It's nice the water's so hot.

504
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:48,693
She pumps up groundwater
and heats it with wood.

505
00:59:48,693 --> 00:59:51,329
That softens it.

506
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:55,635
It's hot, but it doesn't make you itch.

507
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,536
I see...

508
00:59:57,536 --> 01:00:01,097
Best in the land!

509
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,248
Good night, Tsuyako.

510
01:00:10,248 --> 01:00:12,443
Thank you.

511
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:19,257
Shall I help you?

512
01:00:19,257 --> 01:00:23,251
It's bad luck to put a customer to work.

513
01:00:33,072 --> 01:00:35,307
You do it all yourself?

514
01:00:35,307 --> 01:00:39,744
Yes, for years. Since I lost my husband.

515
01:00:39,744 --> 01:00:41,981
My civil-servant son wants me

516
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:44,550
to sell the place for condominiums.

517
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:48,153
But what would my customers do?

518
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:50,690
So while I'm still healthy...

519
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,284
You still have a long time.

520
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,960
Look after him.

521
01:00:59,231 --> 01:01:01,996
Daigo's a dear boy.

522
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:05,829
He takes it all on himself.

523
01:01:06,472 --> 01:01:08,541
When his folks split up,

524
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:11,873
he'd never cry in front of his mom.

525
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:18,184
But he would when he
was alone in that bath.

526
01:01:18,184 --> 01:01:23,588
The poor little thing,
his shoulders shaking...

527
01:01:25,123 --> 01:01:29,652
So that's how he is.
Please understand him.

528
01:01:31,998 --> 01:01:33,795
I will.

529
01:01:39,472 --> 01:01:41,405
How was the water?

530
01:01:42,307 --> 01:01:44,639
So-so.

531
01:01:46,445 --> 01:01:49,175
The kerchief suits you.

532
01:01:55,588 --> 01:01:58,056
It's all white!

533
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:00,760
The cold's set in.

534
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,527
Here.

535
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:03,222
Thanks.

536
01:02:03,628 --> 01:02:06,028
Let's have a drink.

537
01:02:06,898 --> 01:02:09,135
I know a fine place.

538
01:02:09,135 --> 01:02:11,137
Let's go!

539
01:02:11,137 --> 01:02:12,338
Let's be off.

540
01:02:12,338 --> 01:02:13,206
OK?

541
01:02:13,206 --> 01:02:15,007
OK.

542
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:16,338
We're off!

543
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:35,728
That's good!

544
01:02:35,728 --> 01:02:37,855
We haven't done this in ages.

545
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:42,800
It's like an old song.

546
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,576
Your mom liked this?

547
01:02:58,451 --> 01:03:00,282
They were all dad's.

548
01:03:01,954 --> 01:03:06,947
Right, this was your
dad's coffee shop...

549
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:13,693
Don't remind me. I don't
even remember his face.

550
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:17,969
Would you like to see him?

551
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:19,130
No.

552
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:27,679
But if I did...

553
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,271
If you did...

554
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,346
I'd hit him.

555
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,067
Dad liked this piece.

556
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,938
I bet...

557
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:40,420
your mom stayed in love with your dad.

558
01:04:44,195 --> 01:04:45,719
No.

559
01:04:46,364 --> 01:04:49,731
Then she'd have thrown his records out.

560
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:55,099
Not kept them so nice.

561
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:24,400
Go ahead.

562
01:05:25,536 --> 01:05:27,405
Right now.

563
01:05:27,405 --> 01:05:29,773
Right now?

564
01:05:29,773 --> 01:05:33,574
Someone hanged himself in a hotel.

565
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:37,114
Where's the boss?

566
01:05:37,114 --> 01:05:41,786
He just left on another call.

567
01:05:41,786 --> 01:05:44,619
Can you handle it alone?

568
01:05:45,556 --> 01:05:46,818
All right.

569
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,204
Off you go.

570
01:06:33,204 --> 01:06:34,637
See you.

571
01:06:53,824 --> 01:06:54,791
Good morning.

572
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,260
Good job last night.

573
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:04,168
The police were impressed.
'He's so young,' they said.

574
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:06,202
It was all a blur.

575
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:07,568
Oh?

576
01:07:09,273 --> 01:07:11,706
Isn't it cold!

577
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:16,338
Here.

578
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:17,981
Thank you.

579
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:20,951
Your eyes are red. Didn't you sleep?

580
01:07:21,784 --> 01:07:24,253
The job grows on you, doesn't it.

581
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,726
How did you get into this business?

582
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:37,427
Thanks.

583
01:07:38,536 --> 01:07:41,871
Things happened when I was young.

584
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:45,068
I had to leave my home town.

585
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:47,766
Obihiro.

586
01:07:49,179 --> 01:07:52,148
I had a bunch of jobs

587
01:07:53,016 --> 01:07:56,315
and ended up in a little bar here.

588
01:07:58,856 --> 01:08:01,791
But the owner...

589
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:05,659
took a stroke and died.

590
01:08:08,565 --> 01:08:11,762
Then the boss came.

591
01:08:13,304 --> 01:08:17,536
I'd never seen casketing before.

592
01:08:18,775 --> 01:08:22,779
I thought if I died,

593
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:25,771
I'd want him to put me in my coffin.

594
01:08:26,817 --> 01:08:32,483
There's no one quite like him, is there.

595
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:37,792
So here I am.

596
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:43,457
It's funny how fate works.

597
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:47,030
You never know where you'll end up.

598
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:49,829
That's right.

599
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:52,502
This tea's good.

600
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:01,377
Hi, Yamashita.

601
01:09:05,288 --> 01:09:06,654
A friend?

602
01:09:07,358 --> 01:09:09,225
Hello!

603
01:09:09,225 --> 01:09:10,954
Ignore him.

604
01:09:11,996 --> 01:09:13,229
Stop it!

605
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:15,561
Go on ahead.

606
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:25,297
People are talking.

607
01:09:26,076 --> 01:09:27,475
About what?

608
01:09:29,078 --> 01:09:33,412
Get yourself a proper job!

609
01:09:38,354 --> 01:09:40,823
Let's go.

610
01:09:54,938 --> 01:09:56,734
I'm home.

611
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:02,341
Huh?

612
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,381
Mika?

613
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:17,015
Mika?

614
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:21,759
What's wrong?

615
01:10:26,103 --> 01:10:31,675
This is done in such a way
that the family does not see.

616
01:10:31,675 --> 01:10:35,475
The anus must sometimes be blocked.

617
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:38,912
The cotton wool is rolled

618
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:44,654
and pressed deep into the anus.

619
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:47,623
This prevents seepage.

620
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:55,329
What's all that?

621
01:10:58,301 --> 01:10:59,802
You looked in my desk...

622
01:10:59,802 --> 01:11:01,963
Don't change the subject.

623
01:11:03,606 --> 01:11:06,844
I just got this acting job...

624
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:10,871
I checked what the company does.

625
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:17,713
So?

626
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:25,162
Why didn't you say?

627
01:11:25,162 --> 01:11:26,462
You'd say no.

628
01:11:26,462 --> 01:11:28,198
Of course!

629
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:33,396
Aren't you ashamed
having a job like that?

630
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:40,737
What's to be ashamed
of? Touching dead people?

631
01:11:42,145 --> 01:11:45,149
Just get a normal job.

632
01:11:45,149 --> 01:11:47,014
'Normal'?

633
01:11:48,318 --> 01:11:53,118
Everyone dies. I'll
die, and so will you.

634
01:11:54,358 --> 01:11:55,591
Death is normal.

635
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:59,688
Spare me the word games!
I want you to quit.

636
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,761
Please.

637
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,277
I haven't said anything so far, have I.

638
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:18,506
When you wanted to quit the cello

639
01:12:19,216 --> 01:12:21,309
and move back up here...

640
01:12:22,653 --> 01:12:24,951
I just smiled.

641
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:33,195
The fact is, I was
all broken up over it.

642
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:38,192
But...

643
01:12:40,002 --> 01:12:42,631
I love you.

644
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,506
So...

645
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:51,711
just this once...

646
01:12:53,382 --> 01:12:56,819
listen to me.

647
01:13:05,929 --> 01:13:09,456
And if I don't?

648
01:13:17,673 --> 01:13:20,801
Will this be a career?

649
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:39,296
I'm going home. Come
see me when you quit.

650
01:13:39,296 --> 01:13:40,363
Mika!

651
01:13:40,363 --> 01:13:44,425
Don't touch me! You're unclean!

652
01:14:31,814 --> 01:14:33,305
No.

653
01:14:35,185 --> 01:14:36,243
I'm sorry?

654
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:41,417
That's not my daughter.

655
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:46,256
The color's wrong.

656
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:50,033
It's all wrong!

657
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:51,761
That's Miyuki!

658
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,667
What are you doing?!

659
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,636
It's all wrong!

660
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,408
Do it again.

661
01:15:04,648 --> 01:15:05,739
Certainly.

662
01:15:06,783 --> 01:15:09,752
What's the point now?

663
01:15:10,953 --> 01:15:16,551
You didn't raise her right.
That's why this happened!

664
01:15:20,764 --> 01:15:23,100
Don't talk like that.

665
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,868
What?!

666
01:15:24,868 --> 01:15:29,605
You didn't pay her
much attention, either.

667
01:15:29,605 --> 01:15:36,813
Who are you to talk?! You
killed her on your bike!

668
01:15:36,813 --> 01:15:38,515
Have you no shame?!

669
01:15:38,515 --> 01:15:39,983
Stop it!

670
01:15:39,983 --> 01:15:42,280
Stop it!

671
01:15:43,587 --> 01:15:44,712
All of you!

672
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,018
Get out.

673
01:15:49,493 --> 01:15:52,655
It's your fault Miyuki's dead.

674
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:59,970
Can you make up for that?

675
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,403
Well?

676
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:07,742
Work all your lives like him
at a job no one else would do?

677
01:16:08,878 --> 01:16:10,608
Well?

678
01:16:11,648 --> 01:16:12,944
I'm sorry.

679
01:16:15,685 --> 01:16:17,481
I'm sorry!

680
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:24,025
The boss'll be disappointed.

681
01:16:26,762 --> 01:16:28,730
He likes you.

682
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:31,400
He does?

683
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:35,704
Yes! You're the first one
he's ever made full-time!

684
01:16:35,704 --> 01:16:38,207
He sure hired me fast enough...

685
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:43,202
The man goes on instinct. He
knew as soon as he saw you.

686
01:16:45,981 --> 01:16:48,314
Even still...

687
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:53,512
Well, if you're going to quit,
can you tell him yourself?

688
01:16:54,157 --> 01:16:55,783
He's upstairs.

689
01:17:22,918 --> 01:17:24,443
Excuse me...

690
01:17:27,524 --> 01:17:28,922
Come in.

691
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,163
Are you eating?

692
01:17:49,746 --> 01:17:52,840
Your wife's still away...

693
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:55,011
Yes.

694
01:17:56,953 --> 01:18:01,287
Eat. I'm probably a
better cook than you.

695
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:09,927
Dig in.

696
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:17,064
What's that?

697
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:22,310
Puffer roe, grilled
with salt. It's good.

698
01:18:45,502 --> 01:18:48,171
My wife.

699
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:52,971
She died on me nine years ago.

700
01:18:58,948 --> 01:19:06,445
One of you always goes first,
but it's hard being left behind.

701
01:19:13,029 --> 01:19:17,398
I made her beautiful and sent her off.

702
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:26,703
She was my first.

703
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,875
Then I started this business.

704
01:19:36,453 --> 01:19:38,318
Even this...

705
01:19:46,429 --> 01:19:48,396
is a corpse.

706
01:19:55,171 --> 01:19:58,970
The living eat the dead.

707
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,770
Unless they're plants.

708
01:20:09,819 --> 01:20:12,685
Unless you want to die, you eat.

709
01:20:13,622 --> 01:20:16,887
And if you eat, eat well.

710
01:20:34,844 --> 01:20:37,146
Good, huh?

711
01:20:37,146 --> 01:20:38,948
Yes, it is.

712
01:20:38,948 --> 01:20:43,748
So good I hate myself.

713
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:06,376
It's nearly two months since
I moved home from Tokyo.

714
01:21:06,376 --> 01:21:11,143
It's been an awkward time.

715
01:21:15,018 --> 01:21:20,081
Can I really do this job?

716
01:21:26,796 --> 01:21:28,627
Want to do it?

717
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:33,462
All right.

718
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:45,037
Lay the head down first, please.

719
01:22:57,686 --> 01:22:59,119
Tomeo!

720
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:13,529
We'll take our leave.

721
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:20,207
Thank you.

722
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:28,408
Once he went like he did,
we did nothing but fight.

723
01:23:29,685 --> 01:23:32,849
After that I wasn't seeing him.

724
01:23:33,756 --> 01:23:37,623
But when I saw his smile, I remembered.

725
01:23:38,661 --> 01:23:42,791
'He's my son.

726
01:23:43,632 --> 01:23:50,368
'He may dress as a girl,
but he's still my son.'

727
01:23:56,011 --> 01:24:00,141
Thank you very much!

728
01:24:27,076 --> 01:24:28,838
Mmm!

729
01:24:47,764 --> 01:24:49,458
Is it good?

730
01:24:52,068 --> 01:24:53,534
I hate myself.

731
01:24:59,676 --> 01:25:01,644
You brought your cello?

732
01:25:02,645 --> 01:25:05,180
I want to hear it!

733
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:06,408
Just a bit.

734
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:14,244
I've never heard one live.

735
01:25:15,123 --> 01:25:17,694
You were in an orchestra?

736
01:25:17,694 --> 01:25:19,328
But it went broke.

737
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:21,319
When did you start playing?

738
01:25:22,131 --> 01:25:23,498
In kindergarten.

739
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:25,400
That long ago?

740
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:31,474
This is a child's instrument.
My dad made me take lessons.

741
01:25:31,474 --> 01:25:33,141
Good for him!

742
01:25:33,141 --> 01:25:35,310
He was a louse.

743
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:40,048
He had a coffee shop, and
he took off with a waitress.

744
01:25:40,048 --> 01:25:42,318
A real bastard.

745
01:25:42,318 --> 01:25:44,686
Where is he now?

746
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:47,554
Dead, probably.

747
01:25:52,161 --> 01:25:55,153
So... what'll it be?

748
01:25:56,032 --> 01:26:00,127
Well, since it's Christmas...

749
01:26:04,539 --> 01:26:08,645
No problems of religious affiliation?

750
01:26:08,645 --> 01:26:10,479
It's fine.

751
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:12,948
Buddhist, Christians, Islam, Hindu,

752
01:26:12,948 --> 01:26:14,974
we handle anything.

753
01:26:18,354 --> 01:26:21,914
All right, for a holy night...

754
01:27:53,716 --> 01:27:58,585
Hello, NK Agent. Thank you for calling.

755
01:27:59,622 --> 01:28:03,391
Tomorrow? And the name of the deceased?

756
01:28:03,391 --> 01:28:06,762
We will now prepare the
deceased for her departure.

757
01:28:06,762 --> 01:28:10,065
Slip them over the toes...

758
01:28:10,065 --> 01:28:11,293
Um...

759
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:17,331
Grandma wanted to wear socks like ours.

760
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:20,475
Certainly.

761
01:28:28,317 --> 01:28:31,354
Grandma... bye-bye.

762
01:28:31,354 --> 01:28:35,051
Thank you for everything.

763
01:28:40,896 --> 01:28:43,365
...we pray in the name

764
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:45,890
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

765
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:34,006
He's getting old.

766
01:30:53,362 --> 01:30:55,331
Papa...

767
01:30:55,331 --> 01:30:56,957
Thank you!

768
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,192
Mika!

769
01:32:02,965 --> 01:32:05,762
Don't you ever clean?

770
01:32:06,635 --> 01:32:08,003
Sometimes.

771
01:32:08,003 --> 01:32:11,905
Not even once.

772
01:32:12,707 --> 01:32:14,403
Twice.

773
01:32:16,645 --> 01:32:18,943
That's not 'sometimes'.

774
01:32:23,085 --> 01:32:26,612
I guess you need me.

775
01:32:32,127 --> 01:32:34,630
And I've got news.

776
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:35,823
What?

777
01:32:39,835 --> 01:32:41,859
I'm pregnant.

778
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:48,701
I'm going to be a father?

779
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:03,180
So get yourself together, OK?

780
01:33:05,694 --> 01:33:10,859
Will you be able to
tell a child what you do?

781
01:33:13,335 --> 01:33:17,605
The other kids will laugh.

782
01:33:17,605 --> 01:33:22,100
I don't care about the
money. Let's be happy.

783
01:33:34,722 --> 01:33:36,324
Hello?

784
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:38,452
Hi.

785
01:33:38,993 --> 01:33:40,518
Right now?

786
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:43,720
What?

787
01:33:45,967 --> 01:33:49,164
I'll be right there.

788
01:33:53,676 --> 01:33:57,703
Are you going to work now?

789
01:33:59,215 --> 01:34:03,810
The lady who runs the
bath... she's dead.

790
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:34,606
My wife Mika.

791
01:34:43,893 --> 01:34:46,918
She was carrying firewood.

792
01:34:48,029 --> 01:34:50,555
She dropped dead.

793
01:34:52,268 --> 01:34:55,503
Working right till the end...

794
01:34:55,503 --> 01:35:01,465
The town won't be the
same without this bath.

795
01:38:03,524 --> 01:38:10,726
If you would all wipe her
face, and take your farewells.

796
01:38:55,411 --> 01:38:56,969
Ma!

797
01:39:28,543 --> 01:39:30,944
Mother!

798
01:40:39,014 --> 01:40:40,503
Shiori...

799
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:45,743
Grandma's leaving us.

800
01:40:47,288 --> 01:40:48,984
Mother!

801
01:41:00,502 --> 01:41:03,436
Thank you for everything.

802
01:41:16,184 --> 01:41:18,175
You work here?

803
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:29,854
If you would place
your hands together...

804
01:41:42,711 --> 01:41:46,511
I will now close the casket.

805
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:03,720
Thank you.

806
01:42:05,033 --> 01:42:07,331
We'll meet again.

807
01:43:01,122 --> 01:43:04,922
May I watch?

808
01:43:09,797 --> 01:43:11,458
Thank you.

809
01:43:17,405 --> 01:43:24,311
People probably have a
premonition of what's coming.

810
01:43:26,914 --> 01:43:32,979
Last year we did Christmas Eve together.

811
01:43:35,056 --> 01:43:39,220
Just like a young couple, at our age!

812
01:43:39,828 --> 01:43:45,130
But she insisted...

813
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:52,073
so we bought a little
cake, and lit some candles

814
01:43:52,073 --> 01:43:54,667
and celebrated together.

815
01:43:57,078 --> 01:44:01,850
Then all of a sudden

816
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:06,787
she asks me to help her
heat the public bath.

817
01:44:09,423 --> 01:44:13,792
Now I know why.

818
01:44:15,029 --> 01:44:20,127
I'm good at fire.

819
01:44:28,844 --> 01:44:31,846
Working here all these years,

820
01:44:31,846 --> 01:44:42,051
I've often thought that
maybe death is like a gateway.

821
01:44:43,725 --> 01:44:48,560
Dying doesn't mean the end.

822
01:44:49,898 --> 01:44:55,859
You go through it and
onto the next thing.

823
01:44:56,904 --> 01:45:00,773
It's a gate.

824
01:45:02,577 --> 01:45:06,911
And as the gatekeeper

825
01:45:08,115 --> 01:45:11,846
I've sent so many on their way.

826
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:17,917
Telling them...

827
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:22,086
'Off you go.

828
01:45:22,631 --> 01:45:24,929
'We'll meet again.'

829
01:45:50,958 --> 01:45:52,984
Ma!

830
01:45:54,628 --> 01:45:56,264
Ma!

831
01:45:56,264 --> 01:45:59,563
I'm sorry!

832
01:46:00,969 --> 01:46:05,405
I'm sorry!

833
01:46:08,909 --> 01:46:12,811
I'm sorry!

834
01:46:14,448 --> 01:46:16,382
Ma!

835
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:25,181
I'm sorry!

836
01:46:55,523 --> 01:46:57,582
What are you doing?

837
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,083
This one.

838
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,398
Here.

839
01:47:14,909 --> 01:47:16,240
What?

840
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,048
A stone letter.

841
01:47:21,048 --> 01:47:22,676
'Stone letter'?

842
01:47:24,051 --> 01:47:29,524
Long ago, before writing,
you'd send someone a stone...

843
01:47:29,524 --> 01:47:33,789
that suited the way you were feeling.

844
01:47:34,595 --> 01:47:40,368
From its weight and touch,
they'd know how you felt.

845
01:47:40,368 --> 01:47:43,203
From a smooth stone

846
01:47:43,203 --> 01:47:46,341
they might get that you were happy

847
01:47:46,341 --> 01:47:48,208
or from a rough one

848
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:51,109
that you were worried about them.

849
01:48:06,394 --> 01:48:08,122
Thank you.

850
01:48:08,829 --> 01:48:10,797
What did you feel?

851
01:48:12,167 --> 01:48:13,725
Not telling.

852
01:48:17,404 --> 01:48:21,363
That's a lovely story. Who told you?

853
01:48:23,545 --> 01:48:25,069
My dad.

854
01:48:28,416 --> 01:48:32,753
You mean... that big rock?

855
01:48:32,753 --> 01:48:35,381
Yep. I got it from him.

856
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,162
I didn't know that.

857
01:48:41,162 --> 01:48:44,565
He said he'd send me one every year,

858
01:48:44,565 --> 01:48:47,202
but that's all I ever got.

859
01:48:47,202 --> 01:48:49,170
That jerk!

860
01:49:15,997 --> 01:49:19,864
Will you play for the baby
every day till it's born?

861
01:49:35,516 --> 01:49:37,814
What a nice day!

862
01:49:51,899 --> 01:49:53,265
Hello.

863
01:49:54,868 --> 01:49:57,404
Is this the Kobayashi residence?

864
01:49:57,404 --> 01:49:58,372
Yes.

865
01:49:58,739 --> 01:50:00,832
'Kazuko Kobayashi'?

866
01:50:04,078 --> 01:50:06,309
Doesn't she live here?

867
01:50:07,614 --> 01:50:13,154
My mother-in-law
died two years ago.

868
01:50:13,154 --> 01:50:14,677
What?!

869
01:50:15,622 --> 01:50:17,292
Is that so?

870
01:50:17,292 --> 01:50:18,493
May I see that?

871
01:50:18,493 --> 01:50:20,323
No, don't...

872
01:50:25,632 --> 01:50:30,661
(Name of Deceased Kobayashi, Hideki)

873
01:50:39,413 --> 01:50:41,416
I'm back.

874
01:50:41,416 --> 01:50:43,685
You forgot your cell phone.

875
01:50:43,685 --> 01:50:44,412
Huh?

876
01:50:45,787 --> 01:50:48,085
It's at home... sorry.

877
01:50:51,826 --> 01:50:53,828
Your father's dead.

878
01:50:53,828 --> 01:50:55,226
Mine?

879
01:50:55,896 --> 01:50:57,557
Yes.

880
01:51:00,502 --> 01:51:02,970
What do you mean?

881
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:07,900
So I called the fishing port.

882
01:51:09,444 --> 01:51:13,175
Our address was in his things.

883
01:51:15,449 --> 01:51:18,145
But who cares now?

884
01:51:19,287 --> 01:51:24,747
I haven't seen him in 30 years.
His girlfriend can tend to him.

885
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:28,551
They said he was single.

886
01:51:32,667 --> 01:51:35,328
They're cremating him tomorrow.

887
01:51:35,802 --> 01:51:39,533
His body's at the
Fishermen's Co-op there.

888
01:51:47,649 --> 01:51:55,590
He's not on our family register.
Tell them I can't sign for him.

889
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:57,023
Daigo!

890
01:52:00,761 --> 01:52:02,630
Go.

891
01:52:02,630 --> 01:52:04,426
No, it's fine.

892
01:52:04,832 --> 01:52:07,323
Please!

893
01:52:15,609 --> 01:52:19,101
I left...

894
01:52:19,613 --> 01:52:22,980
a son in Obihiro.

895
01:52:24,786 --> 01:52:26,344
He was six.

896
01:52:30,658 --> 01:52:33,252
I met someone.

897
01:52:34,194 --> 01:52:39,689
'Mommy! Mommy! ' my son was crying.

898
01:52:41,836 --> 01:52:46,932
I pushed his little hands
away and went running out.

899
01:52:57,150 --> 01:52:59,744
And since then?

900
01:53:01,689 --> 01:53:04,715
I'd love to see him, but I can't.

901
01:53:07,362 --> 01:53:08,521
Why not?

902
01:53:10,265 --> 01:53:12,859
You could go there.

903
01:53:25,313 --> 01:53:29,043
Are parents who dump their kids...

904
01:53:31,719 --> 01:53:33,481
always like that?!

905
01:53:48,403 --> 01:53:53,238
Please! You have to see
him this one last time.

906
01:54:09,724 --> 01:54:10,850
Daigo...

907
01:54:52,199 --> 01:54:53,564
Sir...

908
01:55:10,417 --> 01:55:12,010
Wait.

909
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:18,018
Take one.

910
01:55:24,198 --> 01:55:26,529
It's fine.

911
01:55:48,588 --> 01:55:51,752
I came in and he was dead.

912
01:55:53,127 --> 01:55:54,957
It was a real shock.

913
01:55:56,029 --> 01:56:01,262
He just turned up in
town one day, all alone.

914
01:56:02,103 --> 01:56:06,368
He worked so hard helping
out at the harbor...

915
01:56:07,274 --> 01:56:11,813
that we let him live in
the watchman's cottage.

916
01:56:11,813 --> 01:56:13,302
I see...

917
01:56:17,585 --> 01:56:20,952
He was real quiet, hardly said a word.

918
01:56:23,356 --> 01:56:29,556
I'm glad someone from his family came.

919
01:56:33,935 --> 01:56:37,131
The undertaker's on his way.

920
01:57:01,028 --> 01:57:05,692
So that's your father...

921
01:57:10,104 --> 01:57:12,800
I hate to say it

922
01:57:13,975 --> 01:57:16,306
but I don't remember...

923
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:20,378
his face.

924
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:28,484
I wouldn't know him to see him.

925
01:57:36,396 --> 01:57:40,355
(Hideki Kobayashi)

926
01:57:47,742 --> 01:57:52,440
So what was his life for, anyway?

927
01:57:55,048 --> 01:58:01,318
Living 70-some years and
leaving one box of stuff?

928
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:06,516
In here.

929
01:58:08,462 --> 01:58:10,363
All right?

930
01:58:10,363 --> 01:58:12,264
'Scuse us.

931
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:14,533
Excuse us.

932
01:58:19,907 --> 01:58:21,966
Can we get started?

933
01:58:39,793 --> 01:58:43,024
Let's get him loaded.

934
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:45,365
Um...

935
01:58:45,365 --> 01:58:46,492
Yes?

936
01:58:47,268 --> 01:58:49,270
Could I do that?

937
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:52,038
No, no, we'll do it.

938
01:58:52,038 --> 01:58:56,042
Offer him some water when we get him in.

939
01:58:56,042 --> 01:58:57,840
One, two...

940
01:59:00,814 --> 01:59:02,543
What the?!

941
01:59:04,585 --> 01:59:08,748
My husband is a professional.

942
02:04:17,197 --> 02:04:19,529
