00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,440
THE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU

2
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,360
Come to dinner.

3
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,080
Come on, Mirandolina, eat that.

4
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,160
You don't like it?

5
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
Go on, eat...
That's all I have.

6
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,840
So missy, I've got a headache.

7
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,040
For about 4 days now
I have a headache and I throw up

8
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,080
but I don't think it's from the stomach.

9
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,080
No...

10
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,200
Aspirin, algocalmin,
extraveral and distonocalm.

11
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,440
No, I can't really, I've just
told you I've got a headache.

12
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, yeah, I drink,
like any other man.

13
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,520
I had a little drink today, too...

14
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,440
Not quite so, missy,
it's not like I'd drink any crap.

15
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,200
Going on 63...

16
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,680
2 Fetesti street, F4 building.

17
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, 2nd floor, flat 17.

18
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:29,200
Lazarescu Dante Remus.

19
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,080
Yes, I'm home.

20
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,480
Thank you and I wish you good night.

21
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,560
<i>In the sea
there are but predatory fish.</i>

22
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,040
<i>You can use polenta for small fish.</i>

23
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,520
<i>Here the big fish eats the small one.</i>

24
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,040
<i>They're all on meat,
polenta doesn't really work in the sea.</i>

25
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,400
<i>It is the wrong kind of bait.</i>

26
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,160
<i>"Well", he said,
"I'm here for the salty air".</i>

27
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,320
<i>The air works ok but if you don't
catch anything, know what I mean.</i>

28
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,400
<i>If you don't get votes...
We didn't get any clear message.</i>

29
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,640
<i>Once again, no message.</i>

30
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
<i>Cause, look,
Ciuhandu an honorable character,</i>

31
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,680
<i>flawless speech, serious.</i>

32
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,320
<i>You'd expect him to rally
the people from Timisoara</i>

33
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,320
<i>and get at least 90% of the votes.</i>

34
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,840
<i>Timisoara turned out rather poor.</i>

35
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Hello, missy, it's me again.

36
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,680
Hello, yes, the Ambulance.

37
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,800
It's me again, Lazarescu.

38
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,640
Then tell the colleague I spoke with
I had ulcer surgery 14 years ago

39
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,200
and I also have leg ulcer
but no big deal.

40
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,340
I've been thinking this headache
might be from the stomach.

41
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,400
I've been thinking this headache
might be from the stomach.

42
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Lazarescu.
Fetesti 2.

43
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
Ok, I got that.

44
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,320
I don't think it's serious but
I rather get a specialist's opinion.

45
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,800
Thank you
and I'll be waiting for you.

46
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,960
My surgery is hurting, cat face.

47
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,280
You don't care, you bloody animal.

48
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,800
Compote.

49
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
How you're doing Nusu?

50
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:30,120
And you, the little one.
Where have you been wandering all day?

51
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,840
You dogcat,
sit here nicely dogcat.

52
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,160
Go to fuck.

53
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,440
Just fucking close.

54
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,520
Where are you going kitten?

55
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
Madam de Pompadour.

56
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,680
Incoerenza.

57
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:52,840
...five-four-five.

58
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
Hello, is this
the Muscalu residence? Virgil?

59
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,840
Hi Virgil, how you're doing?
Is Eva there?

60
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,480
Hold on man, I haven't forgotten.
Why do you think I've called?

61
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,280
You, my sister, whatever.

62
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,240
Hello, Virgil, Virgil.

63
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,160
I've sent the money by post today
and you gonna get it tomorrow.

64
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,800
Right, then next time I'll get
my pension I'll just send it all to you.

65
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,600
That's better, isn't it?

66
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,760
So, say,
can you put Eva on the phone?

67
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,640
Well I said I'll send it by 1st,
and I did.

68
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,400
Now can I speak with Eva?
Please!

69
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,800
I'll wait, of course,
I'm not gonna run.

70
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,440
Hey sis, how are you?

71
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,120
That's just what I wanted
to talk with you about.

72
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,120
Why didn't you tell me
you spoke with Bianca?

73
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Sure, you told me after I asked you.
You know very well I'm right.

74
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,720
If she only calls you...

75
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,560
I know damn well
that she calls you more often.

76
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,760
Listen, I don't feel that well
with my ulcer.

77
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,640
What's with you all,
talking about this drinking?

78
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
You don't get ulcer from alcohol.

79
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,680
I'm sorry, but I drink
at my own expense.

80
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,480
Do you hear me Eva,
I drink at my own expense.

81
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,400
You get ulcer from helico bacteria.

82
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,120
Well, see,
you're learning new things.

83
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,560
No Eva, I have no idea.

84
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,520
I have this surgery for 14 years and
I haven't got a clue. Luckily you do.

85
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,600
Good thing you, intellectuals,
know better than the doctors.

86
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Yeah, alright. But I'm asking you
nicely to stop lecturing me.

87
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,680
Do you hear me Eva?
Stop lecturing and nagging me.

88
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,280
No, you wouldn't like it either.

89
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,360
I don't know.

90
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,080
I don't know, but maybe
you don't want to speak with me anymore.

91
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,760
I noticed that only Virgil
answers the phone lately.

92
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,600
Ok, we'll do it the way you want.

93
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,920
Thank you.

94
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,720
And thank your sweet husband
for the money,

95
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,000
Fine, and leave me with my ulcer

96
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,320
and keep on talking to Bianca,
gossiping about my drinking.

97
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
Ok you, but in the end I drink
at my own expense.

98
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,440
Do you hear me Eva?
I drink at my own expense.

99
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,600
Goodbye!

100
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,600
Cheerio!

101
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,680
Gracefully yours!

102
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,440
Hello, yes.

103
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,440
- My respects, ma'am.
- Yes, what is it?

104
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,560
<i>Well done, you left with the mitts.</i>

105
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,560
Just a second.

106
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,600
Where on the balcony should I put it?
Cheers Romica!

107
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,840
- Where should I take it?
- Take it to the balcony.

108
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,520
Take it to the balcony and put it down,
on the tiles, by the plant.

109
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,480
- Good evening.
- Evening dear.

110
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,600
<i>Smaranda, tie your shoelaces, please.</i>

111
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,760
What's wrong,
aren't you feeling very well?

112
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,640
I beg your pardon Mrs. Mihaela,
so, I've called the ambulance,

113
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,360
but until it arrives could you give me,
I mean lend me a Distonocalm?

114
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,920
I don't know, I'll have a look,
but I don't think we got any.

115
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,680
But if you've been drinking
your headache is from the alcohol.

116
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,680
You drank, 'cause you smell.

117
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,600
Lady, please be so kind
and have a look. I'll pay for them.

118
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,120
C'mon now, let's be serious.
It's not about the money.

119
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,440
I got this headache at the temple
before having the drink.

120
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm afraid we don't have
strong painkillers

121
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,480
cause we don't buy such things.

122
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,560
I値l go and look for a Distonocalm.

123
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,280
What's up Romica? The stomach again
or it's moved on the pancreas?

124
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,400
Stop drinking Romica.

125
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,840
Let go of the fucking bottle.

126
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,560
Stop drinking or you're going down.

127
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,040
I threw up 4 times today,
from the aspirin.

128
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,920
I don't think
I can stand it any longer, Sandu.

129
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,160
What do you want me to bring you?

130
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,920
A pill of Metoclopramide
or some cabbage juice?

131
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,960
I've called the ambulance
and I thought of taking a pill.

132
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,280
Ambulance on a Saturday?
You think they would bother?

133
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,800
Screw them.

134
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,880
They would rip you off
since they raised the medicines prices.

135
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,680
<i>What you need is rest, buddy,
sohlaffen and cabbage juice.</i>

136
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,720
Don't be tense,
it won't go away if you fight it.

137
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,560
- It hurts, Sandu.
- Don't be stubborn.

138
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,640
Like I said, I didn't find Distonocalm
but I brought you Diclofenac.

139
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,280
But I have Diclofenac.

140
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,440
Well, I don't know what to say,

141
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,480
- Let me give you one just now.
- Don't rush to give him one.

142
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,160
It isn't good for ulcer.
Check this out.

143
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,720
- We only buy homeopathics for ourselves.
- So, do you need this?

144
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,680
I'm not sure, I wanted a Distonocalm.

145
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,240
And you give him Diclofenac when
the man's been puking since morning.

146
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,000
I didn't know. I'll go
and get Metrocropmide right away.

147
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,840
He should have said it's nausea.

148
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,800
When I'm hung over, I just rub
my arms and I'm back to normal.

149
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,560
What's she doing?

150
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,960
<i>Oh, fuck!
Miki!</i>

151
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,600
What?

152
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,920
<i>What the hell are you doing,
trying to set us on fire?</i>

153
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,040
<i>Wait, don't turn it off.
Turn it down and leave it.</i>

154
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,040
<i>Come on, it didn稚 get burned.</i>

155
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,880
<i>Nice of you to sort this one out.
Another one sorted by you!</i>

156
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
Look at my burn. Fucking pan!

157
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,720
Are you gonna get those pills?

158
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,520
So, Romica, note the following aspect.

159
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,200
the nausea is caused by the drink
and it's not good for your stomach.

160
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,920
you don't drink the right way,
you're mixing the drinks.

161
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,400
Stop mixing the drinks.

162
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,600
Gee, but you stink. What the hell
have you drunk? Rat poison?

163
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,640
Are you giving me that, or what?

164
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,080
These are not good for you,
with your ulcer...

165
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,880
Only after you eat.

166
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,080
- How are you doing, boy?
- Good evening.

167
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,440
Robert, tell your dad I need that
drilling machine if he's finished with it.

168
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,640
Tell him to bring it down,
cause I need the fucking thing.

169
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,760
- OK, I値l tell him.
- Don't forget.

170
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,160
Great, I have to ask
for my own things!

171
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,000
So, Romica, one for now

172
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,800
and the other one for tomorrow
morning, with the coffee.

173
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,440
But first, take a hot bath, eat
something, and then you take the pill.

174
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,320
But get in the tub, and make sure
it's hot, otherwise it's useless.

175
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Come on, up a daisy.
You have to move, to sweat the alcohol.

176
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,120
Listen, Sandu, I was feeling well,
and now I'm feeling ill.

177
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
Let's take you to bed.

178
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,080
I had this stomach ache from my ulcer,
and now I have a headache too.

179
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,720
Now I have a headache
and a stomach ache.

180
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,520
Easy buddy,
let me get you inside, to lie down.

181
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,840
Wait, easy now.

182
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,120
- I can manage.
- Sure.

183
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,960
<i>Once again, the lack of concentration
leads to death on the Romanian roads.</i>

184
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,440
<i>While driving on the national road 1,
a heavy truck driver fell asleep,</i>

185
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,160
<i>and left his lane going over
to the other side of the road.</i>

186
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,640
<i>He then hit a bus full of tourists,
just outside Saftica village.</i>

187
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,840
<i>This collision has triggered
a chain crash.</i>

188
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,400
<i>Up to now there are 7 recorded deaths
and 29 people in serious condition.</i>

189
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,160
Were you watching this,
or is it better off?

190
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,600
No.

191
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,360
Listen, how long does it take for
a money order to get to Targu Mures?

192
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,480
- I don't know... a few days.
- It's impossible.

193
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,840
At the post office, they told me
it will be there tomorrow.

194
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
No way. Tomorrow is Sunday.

195
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,360
True.

196
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,200
I think you should lie down and sleep.

197
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
I can't sleep.
I don't feel like sleeping

198
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,880
What is she doing with that pill,
inventing it?

199
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,040
Oh dear,
the smell of cat hair in here.

200
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,800
How is it Mr. engineer,
still not asleep?

201
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,320
Go on, give me your glasses.

202
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,520
Yes, very well,
so he won't break them.

203
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,760
Can you get us a glass of water now?

204
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,080
Look how dirty it is,
and they're all the same.

205
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,240
- Should I bring a clean one from us?
- And what else, Miki?

206
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,120
Just go on and pour some water in it,
so we can give him that pill.

207
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
My oh my, you should be sent
to fetch the Death.

208
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,360
You know what they say:

209
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,200
"Mascara doesn't help you
if you don't know how to speak".

210
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,560
"Doesn't help
if you have no manners. "

211
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,120
I think the pain is from the aspirin.

212
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,640
Do you like quince jelly?

213
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,200
I feel kind of droopy.

214
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,320
Aren't you better lying down?

215
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,640
After a good sleep,
you値l be as good as new.

216
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,000
Move over just a bit.

217
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,160
- Come on here and see your "nothing".
- What do you mean?

218
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,400
You said my finger is alright.

219
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,640
Have a closer look, to see better.

220
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,480
See, it's swollen already,
don't pretend you can't see.

221
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,520
Yes, it seems a bit swollen.

222
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,160
Come on, get up.
You should finish what you start.

223
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,960
You just don't leave
the pan and go away

224
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,040
cause, look, I ruined my fingers
and the stuff got burned.

225
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,960
It's not burned, I've tasted it.

226
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,360
Come on, get up, this is for nausea.
Put your tongue out.

227
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,200
But he can't take Diclofenac
on an empty stomach.

228
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,360
- He should eat before taking it.
- What do you think you're doing?

229
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,760
Leave us already with your kindness.
Leave him alone to swallow his pill.

230
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,600
You won't feel the effect right away,

231
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,560
but don't worry, in about 20 minutes
it's gonna go away.

232
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,040
Here, take this glass to the kitchen

233
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,880
and go check on that pot,
so we won't get anymore surprises.

234
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,960
Don't worry, I turned down the heat.

235
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,840
I don't know why aren't you
getting rid of these cats?

236
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,360
- Why don't you get rid of Miki?
- What do you mean?

237
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,080
- Why don't you get rid of your wife?
- Why, is it the same thing?

238
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,120
I don't know, is it the same thing?

239
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,400
These cats, they're gonna kill you
with their hair and their fleas.

240
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,880
Mark my words.
We'll see who was right in the end.

241
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,280
How nice and cozy you must feel
now that you found your fool.

242
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,240
They sleep all day
and leave hair everywhere.

243
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,080
Look how it stinks in here.

244
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,720
Should I bring him a bit of moussaka?
There's nothing in his fridge.

245
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,320
- No Mrs. Mihaela, please don't.
- It's very tasty.

246
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,680
- I'm not eating.
- I made it with pork not with beef.

247
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,160
What is it Miki, what do you want?

248
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,880
Weren't you saying
he should take that pill?

249
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,560
And he has nothing to eat.
Cooked, I mean.

250
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,640
So?

251
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,680
I thought of bringing some moussaka,

252
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,320
so he won't take the pill
on an empty stomach.

253
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,160
- Miki, will you go watch that jelly?
- Alright.

254
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,200
See what I get if I let her talk?

255
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,080
And these newspapers...

256
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,320
Why don't you bin them and clean up.
All this paper just gathers dust.

257
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,920
Romica, this is not good.

258
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,080
I think we should call the ambulance,
'cause look you threw up blood vines.

259
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,680
Hold on.

260
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,800
<i>Come on quick.</i>

261
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,800
Look. Exactly like mine
when I had that Malory-Weiss disease.

262
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,080
Yeah, but yours had more blood in it.
And it had bits from those sausages.

263
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,720
- This looks more watery.
- It's secretion from my stomach.

264
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,920
You stained your slippers.
I'll go wash them.

265
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,200
What is it?

266
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,000
- I say we call for the ambulance.
- He's already called the ambulance.

267
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,160
You called it, haven't you?

268
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,480
I know that, but don't you know
it takes them forever to get here?

269
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,160
- Romica, where's that phone?
- It's in the kitchen.

270
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,240
Don't worry, Malory-Weiss
sounds worse than it really is.

271
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,800
- It's the ulcer Mrs. Mihaela.
- What are you saying?

272
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,880
It's from the ulcer.

273
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,600
Sure, Sandu had an endoscopy
and he's been cauterized.

274
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,640
<i>Yes, he's my next door neighbor.</i>

275
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,760
<i>About 60, actually over 60,
cause he's older than me.</i>

276
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,440
<i>So, he has a headache
and he keeps throwing up blood.</i>

277
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,120
<i>Yes, that's right, he drinks a bit.
I keep telling him not to...</i>

278
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,200
They should be here any minute.
They're on their way. The ambulance.

279
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,080
Come on, take a hike,
you slept enough.

280
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,800
Go and see who's ringing.

281
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,800
There's no need to be afraid
of Malory-Weiss, it's no big deal.

282
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,400
They will cauterize it
through an endoscopy.

283
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,760
But you know how it is, you had
endoscopy for your ulcer, didn't you?

284
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,760
The pain is moving about.
The ulcer.

285
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,440
It's Mr. Gelu, he brought
your drilling machine.

286
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,360
How you're doing Romica,
lost the compass?

287
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,400
- Don't laugh, it's not funny at all.
- He threw up blood.

288
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,840
What does this mean?
Is it serious?

289
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,080
What does it mean,
what does it mean... it just means.

290
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,480
- Are we talking hospital here?
- No, we're talking carnival.

291
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,600
Yes it's serious,
we called the Ambulance.

292
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,640
- Let's check if it has all the bits.
- Great, thanks for the trust.

293
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,000
I thought I could forget about it.

294
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,080
I thought
it's in the flea market already.

295
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,240
Take it and put it on my desk.

296
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,840
Then you stay here with Mr. Lazarescu.
I have to pour the jelly into jars, OK?

297
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,480
Say, are we still on
for the booze trip?

298
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,600
I spoke with the guy, and he'd be
waiting for us next Saturday.

299
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,160
We leave Saturday morning
and we'll be back by evening.

300
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,480
What about the double-glazing?
You're still getting them?

301
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,080
Winter is close.

302
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,480
Don't think so.
Maybe next year, in the spring.

303
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,200
So tell me, what's it gonna be?

304
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,400
Let me pass,
I have to go to the bathroom.

305
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,920
Can you handle it?

306
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,640
Look at him going. Call the ambulance,
tell them not to bother,

307
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,280
Lazarescu
is "mensana in corpore sana".

308
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,600
I told the guy to save some white
and some red. Grasa and Cabernet.

309
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,280
I don't know what to say,
I'm kind of short with the money.

310
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,040
It's 100 kilos. 50 and 50.

311
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,960
I don't know, I spent a lot on potatoes
and pickles. I'm almost skint.

312
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,200
Well, why don't you ask your son?

313
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,160
He doesn't have either,
they have their own problems.

314
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,200
Doinita has been on maternity leave
for a month now.

315
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,760
He wants to change his job.
They have no money.

316
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,400
You mother fucking pervert
now you really pissed me off!

317
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,480
Wait 'till I get my hands on you.

318
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,800
Where are you? Come over here.

319
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,400
I'll shut you up in an instant.

320
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,120
Get in here.

321
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,200
I've never seen as much filth
as in this man's flat.

322
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,520
Look at the dirt on those papers.

323
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,000
What would you expect
from normal folk

324
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
if an intellectual
lives with his cats?

325
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,120
I could lend you some money
till after Christmas.

326
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,840
<i>Sandu I</i>

327
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,000
Listen to that one screaming.

328
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,240
And his daughter didn't give a fuck.
and left for America.

329
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,600
- Canada.
- What?

330
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
Bianca went to Canada.

331
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,600
America, Canada, screw the bitch that
leaves her old man alone.

332
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,000
God forgive me.

333
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,600
I think they're here.

334
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,520
- Good evening madam.
- Good evening. Mr. Lazarescu?

335
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,480
No, I'm the next door neighbor,
I'm the one who called you, Sterian.

336
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,640
- Good evening.
- Hello.

337
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,200
No, it's not him,
yours is in the bathroom.

338
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,840
Come on Romica, hurry up,
the lady from the ambulance is here.

339
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,200
Have a sit.

340
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,040
Well then, should I go on my own?

341
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,240
Let me solve this man's problem, first.

342
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,680
- Then come up when you're done.
- Alright, see you.

343
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,440
Come on, the ambulance is here.

344
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,040
- Good evening.
- Good-bye.

345
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,760
Gee, how did you get in there, man?

346
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,280
- Come on up, easy.
- Easy, easy,

347
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,640
- Can you use your legs?
- It's OK, nothing happened.

348
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,720
- But can you stand up, can you walk?
- I've called for you.

349
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,640
Are you hurt?
When you fell, did you hurt yourself?

350
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,200
Good evening ma'am!
Sandu help me out, I can't use my legs.

351
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,600
- Come on up, nice and easy.
- Show the lady you're OK,

352
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,000
My legs are OK miss.

353
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,440
It's my belly that hurts.
My stomach and my white hair.

354
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,840
We'll see what's wrong
in an instant.

355
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,560
You had a drink, didn't you?

356
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,080
Well yes,
I've drunk about a meter of spirits.

357
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,480
- I see. And what is it that you drank?
- Mastropol.

358
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,080
- What did you say its name was?
- Mas-tro-pol.

359
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,480
It's a drink made by us
from double strength alcohol,

360
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,680
burned sugar and a sachet of vanilla.
But there are no chemicals in it.

361
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,520
Mastropol

362
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Now I would ask you to stay still.

363
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
Calm and breathe normally.

364
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,440
- Not like this, relax your chest.
- I know, I was just testing you.

365
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,800
Yeah? You wanted to see
if I know my job.

366
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,080
You're laughing...

367
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,960
10 over 6... rather small.

368
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,600
- See, this is Mastropol.
- And you drank all of this?

369
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,160
How much of this Mastrapol
have you drunk?

370
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,680
You have, cause you see,
you can't really use your legs.

371
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,160
My surgery hurts,
that's why I've called you,

372
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,320
What surgery?

373
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,920
I have a perforated duodenal
ulcer surgery, nurse.

374
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,760
- Perforated ulcer.
- Yes.

375
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll give you some vitamins and glucose
and you're gonna feel better.

376
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,640
- Lazarescu Dante Remus.
- Lazarescu Dante Remus.

377
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,200
- 63 years old.
- 63 next month, November the 19th.

378
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,680
I don't know much about this,
but he threw up blood,

379
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,840
and I thought
it might be from the stomach.

380
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,960
Of course, having health problems and
drinking, sure leads to throwing up.

381
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,280
I got Malory-Weiss
from drinking last year,

382
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,720
and they cauterized it by endoscope.

383
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,640
That's different.
Probably you had an accident.

384
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,280
- No, I threw up from the effort.
- I have a stomach ache miss.

385
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,360
My surgery hurts and I've been
throwing up since this morning.

386
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,600
You threw up and your stomach hurts?
Then I'll give you an antacid.

387
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,360
Tomorrow, after you'll feel better,
I mean the day after tomorrow, Monday,

388
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,280
go see the doctor
that performed the surgery.

389
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,760
I've been operated 14 years ago by
dr. Olteanu Vladimir, at the Municipal.

390
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,520
Right, Municipal Hospital.
Now it's called Universitar.

391
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,480
Just go see him.

392
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,320
- My head hurts at the temples.
- Does it hurt really bad?

393
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,480
- It hurts since morning.
- This morning.

394
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,800
Then I'll give you a painkiller, too.

395
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,040
You had this done this before,
hadn't you?

396
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,240
Yes.

397
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,880
Easy...

398
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,680
It's not gonna hurt.

399
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,240
- Look, they're here. Good evening.
- Good evening, ma'am.

400
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,200
I brought him some moussaka from us.

401
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,160
What do you say,
should I put it in the fridge

402
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,280
or should I give him
a little right now?

403
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,440
Mr. Lazarescu,
would you care to have some?

404
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,520
Please leave him alone now.

405
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,520
She is my wife.

406
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,800
Hold on tight, like this. Press.

407
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,640
I gave you this injection
because you drank.

408
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,960
- I'll throw those away.
- Yes, thank you.

409
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,040
You were saying
your stomach is aching.

410
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,840
- Are you having bloody stools?
- I have runny stools.

411
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,760
Almost like water.

412
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,160
- Ouch, it hurts.
- Here?

413
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,000
Ouch, yes.

414
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,800
- Ouch, ouch.
- Does it hurt here?

415
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,240
Can't you see I had surgery?
Don't you want to see certain things?

416
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,280
- OK, OK, I got that.
- Calm down.

417
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,920
I apologize

418
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,880
Have you noticed any blood traces?
Or if the stool is black?

419
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,400
It's not melena miss, don't insist.
I only have diarrhea. And I have cramps.

420
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,520
You're saying it's not melena.
Do you eat normally?

421
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,240
I eat, yes.
Cold cuts and cheese.

422
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,880
Have you noticed losing weight
over the last month or week?

423
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,400
- About two holes in my belt.
- How did you say?

424
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,560
Yes, I lost weight,
about 2 holes in my belt.

425
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,280
Yes, I see.

426
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,000
- Is there someone else living with you?
- No, he lives alone.

427
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,480
I live with three cats in a building
with neighbors that don't love animals.

428
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,200
How could we love them
if they have fleas?

429
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,640
You'll have to come with me
to be seen by a specialist.

430
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,240
I'm gonna take your temperature,
and then we'll go.

431
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,520
Have you ever been seen
by a colon specialist?

432
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,640
There's nothing wrong with my colon.

433
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,680
OK.

434
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,120
I'm gonna have a cigarette
in the kitchen. Is smoking allowed?

435
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,280
Yes, it is. Smoking, drinking,
all the sins.

436
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,360
- Would you come with me?
- Sure.

437
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,040
Don't worry, it will go away.

438
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,920
No shit,
this is an astronaut's temperature.

439
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,880
I know he has a sister in Targu Mures

440
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,520
and a daughter, Bianca,
but she's emigrated to America.

441
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,440
- And the wife?
- No, his wife died about 10 years ago.

442
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,680
- I see.
- 8 years.

443
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,840
Just a second.

444
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,840
I brought him some moussaka.

445
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,840
And could you come with us?
It would be easier if he's accompanied.

446
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I don't know, if you'd ask me
I would bother and come.

447
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,640
But Sandu won't agree.
Sure, he is our neighbor.

448
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,800
You'd help me with the admittance.

449
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,320
Just between us women:

450
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,560
I'm not happy with the friendship
between Lazarescu and my husband.

451
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,880
He got Sandu into drinking.

452
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,160
Before Lazarescus moved here,
Sandu didn't touch alcohol.

453
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,240
Lazarescu taught him to drink
like they do in Hungary.

454
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,680
But Lazarescu
is not a Hungarian name.

455
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,600
No, he is Romanian.
But his wife, Erji, was Hungarian.

456
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,040
The arrogant type.

457
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,520
It wasn't us that put the bottle
in his hand

458
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,080
and look at the filth he lives in
with these cats that soil the stairway.

459
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,840
We live in the city, after all.

460
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,800
- That's true.
- Of course I am right.

461
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,040
And there's another one,
Dinescu, on the 4th floor.

462
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,040
That one has a son that plays
the violin. He's been driving us crazy.

463
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,560
At some point somebody has to take care
of these cats and throw them away.

464
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,720
So your husband wouldn't go either.

465
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,600
That'll be just great.
Of course he wouldn't.

466
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,560
But I don't know, you should ask him.

467
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,520
Please don't get me wrong.
We have a drink now and then

468
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,760
but only at home,
where nobody can see us.

469
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,800
And when you need a bit of help
he wouldn't give you a dime.

470
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,240
And it's not that he wouldn't want to
but he doesn't have a thing.

471
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,880
But what's wrong with him?
Is it serious?

472
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,640
I'm only a nurse, I can't say for sure,
but it could be serious.

473
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,200
Looks like a colon tumor,
but maybe I'm wrong.

474
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,480
That's right.
His wife died of cancer too.

475
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,240
It's not really necessary
to come with us,

476
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,600
but it would have been
easier for me.

477
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,920
In any case,
maybe you could call his sister,

478
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,320
to come and see him in the hospital.

479
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,200
What is it about?

480
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,600
She was asking if we could go
with her to the hospital,

481
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,640
for Lazarescu's admittance.

482
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,600
- Just one of you.
- I said you wouldn't go.

483
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,280
Usually it's easier for us
at the admittance

484
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,680
if the patient comes attended.

485
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,760
- Is it that serious?
- Yes, he has cancer.

486
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,200
I didn't say that. But they'll
keep him at the hospital, for sure.

487
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,200
He needs to have full tests done.
I only said he might have cancer.

488
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,720
You mean from the ulcer?

489
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,920
No, I reckon it's the colon
but it's better to see a doctor.

490
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,320
- Say, Miki, should I go with the lady?
- I don't know.

491
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,520
If they find something and keep him
there, will you walk home?

492
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,560
Didn't I say that I'll call his sister?
Really now, I thought we agreed.

493
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,440
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

494
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,880
Just a second.

495
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,920
Thanks for leaving me alone
on a Saturday night.

496
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,880
- How is it?
- 36 over 6, over 7.

497
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,320
I have to get him to the hospital.

498
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,520
We have to go to the hospital
Mr. Lazarescu.

499
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,120
- Can you walk to the ambulance?
- Course I can.

500
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,920
But first I'd like to call
my sister in Targu Mures.

501
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,040
I'll do it, if you give me the number.

502
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,440
- Yes?
- Yes.

503
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,640
0265.

504
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,840
- Area code
- Yes.

505
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,760
- 0265,..
- Say again.

506
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,440
- 263,
- 545.

507
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,480
Thanks.
Sure I can.

508
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,200
- Can you help me take him to the car?
- Sure.

509
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,360
Take a pajama with you.
And some slippers.

510
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,040
Then he needs a bag or something.

511
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,680
<i>Hello, Mrs. Eva?
Miki Sterian speaking.</i>

512
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,640
- Try to stand up. Need help?
- No, no.

513
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,440
- Is this one Ok?
- Of course.

514
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,080
- Are you putting this on?
- Yes.

515
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,280
<i>They don't know, he needs a biopsy.</i>

516
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,760
Don't push yourself. I値l help you.

517
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,280
<i>I called to let you know they're taking
him to the hospital right now.</i>

518
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,960
<i>The ambulance.</i>

519
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,000
Mrs. Eva...

520
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,880
Hi, yes.

521
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,280
They are taking me to the hospital.
Don't worry, it's not serious.

522
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,440
Come on, you're not going
to travel alone by night.

523
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,160
- Can I speak with her for a moment?
- Hold on, let me put someone else on.

524
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,560
Hello, good evening lady.

525
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,000
I am the paramedic.
My name is Mioara Avram.

526
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,560
Yes, the ER at St. Spiridon,
if you know where it is.

527
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,200
I think it is.

528
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,680
Yes I think you should come.

529
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,960
- If you get here tomorrow, it's Ok.
- You're sitting in that puke.

530
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,800
And if he won't be at the hospital,
he will be home. Yes, yes, thank you.

531
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,880
Good evening.

532
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,960
- What did she say, is she coming?
- Yes, she is. She'll be here tomorrow.

533
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,600
- So it's settled.
- Of course it's settled.

534
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,600
If the woman said she'll be here,
she値l be here.

535
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,280
Come on, easy, don't rush.

536
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,800
Come on Romica,
the lady is waiting for you.

537
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,680
It's stuck,
Here. There you are.

538
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,680
- Ready.
- Sandu, would you lock the door?

539
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,440
- I will, where's the key?
- There, on the fridge.

540
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,160
Let me do it.

541
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,440
- Where could those cats be?
- I took them to the bedroom.

542
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,920
They're gonna ruin my flowers,
they'll make a mess.

543
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,240
- Watch the stairs!
- Which lock?

544
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,080
- The lower one.
- Pay attention, please.

545
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,280
- Lean on me.
- Easy, there's no rush.

546
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,960
Listen Sandu, if they値l keep me at
the hospital, feed my animals, will you?

547
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,040
- Mirandolina, and Nusu and Fritz.
- I will, no problem.

548
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,240
- Allow me. Let me help you.
- There's no need, I can manage.

549
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,120
Let me, please.

550
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,840
- Bones, fish, they're not demanding.
- Don't worry Romica, I'll feed them.

551
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,080
Easy, up.

552
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,720
- But only if they keep me at the hospital.
- Alright.

553
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,320
Yes, what is it?

554
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,960
My husband is bringing him downstairs
so that you'll take him to the hospital.

555
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,960
I'll call you later,
I've got things to do.

556
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,280
Come on already mom, I'm not Geanina
Yes, I got that, bye.

557
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,080
Where is Mrs. Mioara?

558
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,200
She's coming downstairs
with my husband.

559
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:46,160
It's OK, leave us, we can manage.
Easy now Romica, we're here.

560
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,640
- I can't fit into this, madam.
- Come on. What did you expect, a Mazda?

561
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,760
Come on please, get inside.

562
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,000
We have new vans also,
but they're just for emergencies.

563
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,960
And the ulcer is not an emergency?
Answer me this, and then I'll get in.

564
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,920
Do you believe
the ulcer is no emergency?

565
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,600
Take your hands off!
Are you blind? Sandu!

566
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,880
Stop fooling around Romica!
Did you expect a helicopter?

567
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,720
Stop that, young man! Nurse!

568
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,360
Come on please, it's late
we need to hurry to the hospital.

569
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,680
Don't put me on that stretcher,
Listen son, I'll sit here.

570
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,840
Yes, sit in this.

571
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,600
- I don't wanna lie on the stretcher.
- I'll help you to the seat.

572
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,920
Come, easy, easy.
There you go.

573
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,120
You don't need to be so rough.

574
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,240
Going to the hospital is not easy,
we all get old.

575
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,360
I just told him to sit there quietly.

576
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,440
Watch that leg.

577
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:51,120
I forgot to give you the bag.
Here are your pajama and the slippers.

578
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,640
- What am I doing here Sandu?
- Don't worry, Mr. engineer.

579
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,680
They won't keep you in the hospital.
Be good there.

580
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,480
<i>C'mon dear, I'm freezing here.</i>

581
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,200
To the ER at St Spiridon.

582
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,880
- If you stay there, stay put.
- I'm sitting here nicely.

583
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,200
It's not nice to push people
like that. It's not, you know.

584
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,280
Wouldn't you sit a bit further?
Your breath kind of stinks.

585
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,880
I understand you're doing your duty
but not that tough.

586
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,040
We're only
a bunch of miserable people, Mr.

587
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,680
Let him drive, sit there nicely.

588
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,200
How are you feeling?

589
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,200
You know how much
I love those cats of mine?

590
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,240
My heart shrinks,
now that I left them home.

591
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,000
Of course I understand.

592
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,280
- Are you still feeling noxious?
- I feel a kind of sadness, miss.

593
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,920
Course I understand,

594
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,400
my sister has a teckel
and she feels the same way you do.

595
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,240
Excuse me miss,
do you have a cigarette?

596
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,640
Sit there nicely.
We'll get to the hospital right away.

597
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,960
- You can't smoke in here.
- I would like to smoke a cigarette.

598
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,040
You can't smoke in the car,
did you hear?

599
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,640
We'll get to the hospital right away.

600
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,040
Look, I'm not smoking either,
and I actually smoke.

601
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,480
I smoke for about 30 years now.

602
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,160
What did my sister say,
when is she coming?

603
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,240
She said she値l be in Bucharest
tomorrow morning by 6 am.

604
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:27,120
Sorry ma'am, but you don't realize
how hard it is to raise a child.

605
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,200
Do you have children?

606
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,720
I only have one child. A girl, Bianca.
Married in Toronto, Canada.

607
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,760
How interesting.

608
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,920
Torino's in Italy, pops.

609
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,760
- The cold got into me.
- Yeah, it's cold.

610
00:56:55,160 --> 00:57:02,160
My sister has none. We were two.
A boy and a sister.

611
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,960
Actually, it's the other way around,
cause she's the elder. I'm the youngster.

612
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,200
I have a sister too,
younger than me.

613
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,880
And you, Leo?
You are two brothers, right?

614
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,920
Two. Me and Relu, from Germany.

615
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,880
Sorry ma'am,
but I have a terrible headache

616
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,600
and I would lie down a bit, over here.
Is it possible?

617
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,840
- What do you say, your head aches?
- Do you think it's from the ulcer?

618
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,960
This headache, I mean.
And I haven't eaten anything, either.

619
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,640
It is psychosomatic Mr. Lazarescu.

620
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,800
Relax, you're not in pain.
I gave you 2 painkillers.

621
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,840
Listen son, may I lie down a little
on this seat, in the back?

622
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,440
- Do you mind?
- You mean on the stretcher?

623
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,160
- Yes.
- Of course, lie down. Stop the car.

624
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,840
Be patient Mr. Lazarescu,
take it easy.

625
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,880
Mr. Lazarescu, we're here now.
Come on, easy, get up.

626
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,760
- Come on pops, give me your hand.
- Watch out.

627
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,880
Can you walk,
or should we use the stretcher?

628
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,400
- Should I bring a wheelchair?
- Give me the bag.

629
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,080
Come on, go get that wheelchair already.

630
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,560
What, does your leg hurt?

631
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,320
- My right kidney hurts.
- Give me your ID card, please.

632
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,880
Come on, help me take him out.

633
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,400
- Come on.
- Easy, easy now.

634
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,920
The leg.
Hold on.

635
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,760
Can you let us pass, please?

636
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,720
Ok miss, drop your panties.

637
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,040
Here you are.

638
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,360
Abdominal colic and cephalgia.

639
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,160
I'd rather think he has a colon tumor.
I palpated his abdomen, and it's hard.

640
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,120
- No joking?
- What should I do with him, doctor?

641
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,360
Put him in my lap.
Take him over there.

642
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,920
Excuse me, doctor...

643
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,040
Why did they bring him here?
Why not to Fundeni Hospital?

644
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,360
Why didn't you take him to Fundeni?

645
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,880
He should be diagnosed by a specialist
I am not qualified to diagnose.

646
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,280
Well I see you were. Didn't you say
something about his colon?

647
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,560
Get undress, please.
Come on, check his blood pressure

648
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,960
Help the gentleman undress.

649
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,560
Is your belly still sore?
Is it sore right now?

650
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,400
Yes.

651
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,680
Flex your leg.
And the other one. Like that.

652
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,520
The belt, head to the left.

653
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,520
Does it hurt here?

654
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,320
It doesn't hurt there. To be honest,
it's my head that's sore now.

655
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,840
Exhale.

656
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,760
You've drunk a fair bit.

657
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,240
<i>Raluca,
write the lady a prescription.</i>

658
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,800
- Doctor, could it be from my colitis?
- I thought I was the doctor here.

659
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,800
Hey, hey, what's this?
Behave, or you'll get me angry.

660
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,120
Take your prescription and go home.

661
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,280
Doctor,
what should we do with this one?

662
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,160
Keep him or send him
to Panduri Hospital?

663
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,920
- Did you give him Papaverine?
- Yes.

664
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,760
- And the ultrasound?
- I'll do it now.

665
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,000
- Get out of my way! How is it?
- He's been drinking.

666
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,320
Ah! This, we don't like.

667
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,800
Have you celebrated something?

668
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,440
Or do you drink
just for the sake of it?

669
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,200
- Is it you that brought him?
- Yes.

670
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,240
Why here and not to Fundeni Hospital?

671
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,840
Say pops,
has a colon specialist seen you?

672
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,720
Doctor,
I had ulcer surgery, 14 years ago.

673
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,480
And why do you drink,
if you had ulcer?

674
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,440
Look at the zipper he got,
but he doesn't care.

675
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,720
- Do you smoke?
- Yes!

676
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,160
Good, keep it up!

677
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,120
Nothing.
Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

678
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,920
I have problems with my stomach,
I have ulcer.

679
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,440
No pops,
you have problems with your head.

680
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,680
- Maybe it's his colon.
- Ouch.

681
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,800
It hurts, doesn't it?
Have you seen the size of his liver?

682
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,240
One day your liver will burst
from the drink. You hear?

683
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,320
And since when do you diagnose?

684
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,720
Do you have a secret method
I'm not aware of?

685
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,360
Are you using bio-energy?
Can you see the Holy-Spirit?

686
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,480
Cat got your tongue?

687
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,000
- I only said it could be the colon.
- Great, now teach us our trade.

688
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,840
Why did you bring him here?
The hallway is full of his kind.

689
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,840
This is how we got in this shit,
by minding other people's business.

690
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:02,520
- Doctor, my head hurts.
- Then why do you drink?

691
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,240
Stop drinking
if you don't want to hurt.

692
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,920
- It's been hurting since this morning.
- Then don't drink in the evening.

693
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,640
- Please don't talk to me like that.
- Be quiet.

694
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,600
- I don't think I've heard you right.
- Please, be quiet.

695
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,800
Have you no shame?
Whom do you think you're talking to?

696
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,280
I'll blow you to bits
along with your ulcer.

697
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
You pour the drink down your throat,

698
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,600
and then you come to me,
to get you fixed.

699
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,040
A whole team looks after your ass
and operates your ulcer

700
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,280
and you go home and get wrecked.

701
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,080
Did I cause you this?
This ulcer, did I cause it?

702
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,560
The hospitals are full
of people like you

703
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,320
that soak their brains in alcohol
and batter their wives and kids.

704
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,760
Close that door, will you?
Do you take this for a disco?

705
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,280
What are you doing here?
Why are you barging in?

706
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,480
- Please be still, the exam isn't over.
- Stop talking so much.

707
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,240
- I have never beaten my child.
- Alright, but don't get dressed.

708
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,000
Why don't you stay here?
What now, do I have to send for you?

709
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,400
What's all this fuss about?

710
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,000
If you don't keep quiet
I'll throw you all out.

711
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,680
How long does it take you
for a prescription?

712
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,880
- Don't get me started on you, too.
- Sign here.

713
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,360
I'm sorry, you were busy.

714
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,200
Look what you've brought here.

715
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,080
Why did you get dressed? Are you cold?
Lie down over there, I'm not over.

716
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,200
And you're mocking
the other patients as well

717
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,120
those with serious problems,
like that one.

718
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,600
Silvia, give him glucose.
Did you give him anything?

719
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,320
- I gave him the same, plus a painkiller.
- Put an analgesic and some vitamins too.

720
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,200
Make space. Move over.

721
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,960
- What is it?
- Two seriously injured.

722
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,480
Patient, 20 years, craniocerebral
injury. Blood pressure 14 over 9.

723
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,920
Take a look, doctor.

724
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,440
Silvia, call for dr. Kelemen
and dr. Tutui. And quick.

725
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,080
What's your name?
Can you speak?

726
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,000
- How is he?
- Left anisocoria.

727
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,200
Call the tomograph.

728
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,920
- Where did this tragedy happen?
- You mean those? At Saftica.

729
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,080
I think there are at least 20 dead.

730
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,880
- I have to go. Good evening, madam.
- Bye.

731
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,280
Move.

732
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,320
How are you feeling?
Does your head still hurt?

733
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,040
Stay still, don't move.

734
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,480
- Doctor, my head hurts.
- Very well, it means you have one.

735
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,640
Did you take a good look at those
who came? Those are emergencies.

736
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,160
- Doctor, would you come for a minute?
- Wait a second, dear.

737
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,240
Did you throw up blood?
Do you have melena?

738
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,400
- No, I have diarrhea.
- I didn't ask you that.

739
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,400
Raise your hands.

740
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,040
Bullshit, you're ok. Stop drinking.

741
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,200
You don't give a shit about the others.
And I'm supposed to take care of you.

742
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,560
Where's that record?
Give it to me.

743
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,280
It's your duty,
that's why you're paid.

744
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:15,160
What? My duty? Did I put
the bottle in your hand, you pig?

745
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,640
Did I take you drinking?

746
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,200
- Who told you that we are well paid?
- Why did they bring you on the stretcher?

747
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,760
Why, if you can use your own legs?
Stand up and walk if you can.

748
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,920
I don't need your help.
I can make it alone.

749
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,920
- Look at him.
- Easy, Mr. Lazarescu.

750
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,480
And you were lecturing us.
See what alcohol made of you?

751
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,240
- Are you hurt, Mr. Lazarescu?
- Girl, call someone to take him away.

752
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,640
Costica!

753
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,320
You'd better get dressed.

754
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,880
- Get him out of my sight.
- Doctor?

755
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,200
There's nothing wrong
on the ultrasound.

756
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,320
Some kidney sand,
but within normal values.

757
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,880
- Did you write his prescription?
- Yes,

758
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,440
Then send him home,
what are you waiting for?

759
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,280
His liver
is as big as the Parliament House,

760
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,400
you should take him
to Fundeni Hospital.

761
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,560
I don't think it's hepatitis.

762
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,520
No, you better take him to Floreasca
Hospital or Universitar Hospital.

763
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,040
He needs a liver CT scan.

764
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,360
I would have kept him here,
but you see how crowded it is.

765
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,000
Hurry up with the chair.

766
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,960
Easy.

767
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,720
- You need help?
- No, it's ok. Easy.

768
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,880
Are you comfortable?
Stay there.

769
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,320
Watch your head,
I'm closing the stall.

770
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,600
So?

771
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,240
So we took out those two,
but they are working hard over there.

772
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,240
I don't think there's anyone else left
to rescue in that wreckage.

773
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,360
And they've blocked the road, too.

774
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,000
Didn't you say
they crashed at the exit for Snagov?

775
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,640
No bro, it happened
on the bridge at Saftica.

776
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,080
It had no reason
to make a right for Snagov.

777
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,840
They broke the side barriers, too.

778
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:54,040
Half of our cars are there.
And there were kids in there.

779
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,200
- Good evening Mrs. Mioara.
- Hi Misu.

780
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,280
They knocked me dead
with their lectures.

781
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,600
And our tipsy grandpa
can't keep his mouth shut.

782
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,440
- What about the accident?
- Well what about it?

783
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,480
They were heading for Brasov, and
they crashed on the bridge, at Saftica.

784
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,440
Probably a blow up on a front tire.
I think they had more than 100 km/hour.

785
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,360
Poor souls, they were going on holiday.

786
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,760
I don't know.
I guess half of them are dead.

787
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,000
We were the third on the scene,
and we got the last ones alive.

788
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,680
- See how life is?
- What about yours?

789
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:30,760
I don't know, cirrhosis suspicion.
At least that's what dr. Ardelean said.

790
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,720
Isn't he the one involved
in the medicines scandal?

791
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,040
No, that one's name is Aldea, I say.
Sandu Aldea.

792
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,840
I thought his name was Ardelean.

793
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,920
- We're going to Universitar Hospital.
- To do what? The place is swamped.

794
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,240
Most of the casualties went there.

795
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,480
We're going for a CT scan.
Move over.

796
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,880
If you were there to hear the folks
moaning under that bus...

797
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,040
Be still, Mr. Lazarescu.

798
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,640
We're taking you to Universitar
to run full tests.

799
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,360
Let's go.

800
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,040
- Bye, Misu.
- Good bye, ma'am. Take it easy.

801
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,840
Listen, be careful with Leo,
he's a stud.

802
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,840
My gall hurts,
and I have no pills on me.

803
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:24,120
- Did you try marigold tea?
- Slow down, please slow down.

804
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,120
What happened, Mr. Lazarescu?

805
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,240
Don't take me home girl,
I feel really bad.

806
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,200
My name is Mioara, Mr. Lazarescu.
And his name is Leonard.

807
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:42,320
Yeah, beautiful... Listen, somebody
take me to the hospital, I'm sick.

808
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,560
Relax, we're on our way
to the hospital.

809
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,520
- Mrs. Mioara.
- Yes?

810
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:53,000
I feel my head splitting from the pain.
Please take me to the hospital.

811
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,680
We're heading there, I've told you.

812
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,240
Come on Mr. Lazarescu,
don't be a baby.

813
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,000
My sister will be
nice to you, when she'll come.

814
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,040
Never mind your sister, ok?

815
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,000
Look, pops we're almost there.

816
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,720
In 5 minutes we'll be there.
Look, we are near the Parliament House.

817
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,400
I am sorry I caused you trouble
at the hospital.

818
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,840
What do you say?

819
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,840
I am sorry I caused trouble
with the doctors.

820
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,600
Forget about it, we're used to it.

821
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:33,160
But, at Universitar,
try to be more careful.

822
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,400
They might be less patient.

823
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,840
Yes, you're right,
I lost my temper, I'm sorry.

824
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,200
I know, but you realize that you've
drunk and they might send you home.

825
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:50,160
That's true, but isn't the doctor's
duty to take care of the patient?

826
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,040
Yeah?
And what is the patient's duty?

827
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,760
I mean, I'm driving you
with the Ambulance,

828
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,880
but shouldn't you behave?

829
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,120
See? He's quiet now.

830
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:14,200
Pull over, pull over. He threw up.

831
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,840
Wait, we're in the middle
of the junction.

832
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,160
What have you done here?
Give me the napkins.

833
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,200
See, if you don't stay still?
Look what you've done here.

834
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:48,120
Hold it to your mouth.
Ok. Drive on.

835
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,200
Is it ok?

836
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,640
Excuse me, nurse,
do you have children?

837
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,920
- What did you say?
- Do you have children?

838
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,440
Oh, God, you like to chat.
Yes I have a son and a daughter.

839
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,840
The girl is 18, and the boy 27.
What else?

840
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,720
- Big, you have big kids.
- Yes,

841
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:39,680
- Excuse me, nurse, but how old are you?
- I'm not that young anymore. I'm 55.

842
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,520
- 55?
- Yes 55, in September.

843
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,840
In September? Just like Virgil,
my brother in law,

844
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,480
only that he is 68.
When in September?

845
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:57,880
- Dear me, On 1st September.
- He is on 21st or 27th.

846
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,760
Come on pops, we reached the hotel.

847
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,120
For Trauma Center? From the accident?
Are you from the accident in Saftica?

848
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,360
- We're with another case.
- We've been sent for some tests.

849
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,280
So, if you're not from the accident,
go somewhere else, we're crowded.

850
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,800
We've been sent from St. Spiridon
for tests.

851
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,040
Listen, woman, there's no one
to take care of you. Understand?

852
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,760
Really.

853
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,800
Have I told you to take him out?
Put him back and move away.

854
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,360
Why are you following me?

855
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,040
You have a customer.

856
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,960
- What do we do?
- We'll wait and see.

857
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,440
Trauma is full.

858
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,480
There's no room at the 1st,
no room at the 2nd,

859
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,360
no room at mom's, no room at dad's.
Please go away.

860
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,760
We're not staying, we're on our way
to Fundeni Hospital.

861
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,680
Then go to Fundeni.
Am I not clear enough?

862
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,200
We're not for Trauma,
we need to do a CT scan.

863
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,360
What CT scan lady?
Give me that record.

864
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,720
What am I supposed to do now?

865
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,560
You, come here.

866
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:51,840
Take this one to General Care.
Come on Mr. Driver, time flies.

867
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,560
Out with him, quick.

868
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,280
Move this car quickly, will you?
And please clean the puke.

869
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,200
Now blame it on me.

870
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,000
Slowly.

871
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,880
Hold on pops, don't wiggle.

872
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,000
Move away.

873
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,960
Could you let us pass? Thanks.

874
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,600
Easy.

875
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,800
<i>- Wait outside, please.
- For a hemogram.</i>

876
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,440
I'll wait here, in the hall.

877
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,720
Leo.

878
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,960
- Why don't you go in?
- She told me to wait.

879
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,400
You may go in, lady,
I see you have an emergency.

880
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,200
- I say we let the lady first.
- Of course, madam, go in.

881
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,600
Come in.

882
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:36,400
- How do you feel, Mr. Remus?
- My head hurts, my temples...

883
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,080
And the booze, why did you drink it?
Get him inside.

884
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,560
- Can you walk, just two steps?
- I try.

885
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:12,160
Sit here.

886
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,880
I'll be here, by the benches.

887
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,640
Look at me.

888
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,640
I don't like what I see.

889
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,520
- I throw up morning.
- What? You throw up in the morning?

890
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,680
No, since morning.

891
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,760
We'll see in an instant.

892
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,120
But first,
we'll take some blood for tests.

893
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,680
Help him undress.
Please sit.

894
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,320
Did you sign in
the one from the Ambulance?

895
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,040
Then come and get the hemogram,
proteins and transaminases.

896
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,680
- And put him a venous catheter.
- He needs a CT scan, doctor.

897
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:56,920
The vest, too.

898
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,400
Are you coming?

899
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,120
And look,
you have an ulcer surgery.

900
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,440
May I?

901
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,760
I'll use also this arm.

902
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,120
Ah, this drink.
You never have enough of it!

903
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,280
Why do you drink
if you have an ulcer surgery?

904
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,040
Did you take him enough blood?
I want a ionogram, too.

905
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,160
Come on, flex your legs.

906
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,160
- What? The right one is slower?
- Yes.

907
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,000
Head aside.

908
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,240
- Nothing here.
- Doesn't affect me drinking.

909
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,240
- What did you say?
- Sometimes doesn't affect.

910
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,680
I don't understand.
Who is not affecting you?

911
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,840
I palpated him at home,
and his abdomen was hard.

912
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,000
I thought it's the colon.

913
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,520
It's not the colon, it's the liver.

914
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,720
Look at his color,
the liver is the problem.

915
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,120
- Did you throw up with blood?
- No ma'am.

916
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,040
- It hurts here, doesn't it?
- Don't get close.

917
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,200
What about black stool?
You know, melena.

918
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,600
- I say a things you don't want to get.
- No kidding.

919
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,520
Do you have melena?
Yes or no?

920
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,000
No.

921
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,000
It's not the stomach.

922
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,880
I told my head hurts.

923
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,440
Would you hold your temper with me?
Please.

924
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,920
I don't know about the CT scan.
You got here at the wrong time.

925
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,720
Instead of waiting here to free up,
you better go to Filaret Hospital.

926
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,800
- Tell her the head hurts. Say.
- What? Your head hurts?

927
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,600
Actually we went to pick him up
thinking it's meningitis.

928
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,720
I don't think so. Look at the light.

929
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,040
- Does it bother you?
- No.

930
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,560
You're not bothered.
Where exactly is the pain?

931
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,520
- Here, the temples
- Here?

932
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,360
- Yes.
- Here too?

933
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,920
Yes.

934
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,760
Raise your hands.

935
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,600
- How mean you are, all women.
- Really?

936
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:57,840
Stay still,
look at me and don't move.

937
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,560
Squeeze my hands.
Harder.

938
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,120
- The right hand, that's all you can?
- Yes.

939
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,640
You can put his clothes on.

940
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,440
Please, call Popescu, from Neurology.
Quick.

941
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,240
I'll take care of you in a second.

942
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,640
<i>Give me Popescu.</i>

943
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,640
<i>Doctor? Phone!</i>

944
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,360
Hello, Dragos?
Can you come over, please?

945
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,880
Yes, it's urgent. A 62 years old man.

946
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,200
Come on, get serious. I can't speak.

947
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,120
I just can't.

948
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,560
Maybe. If you bring me roses.
I値l be waiting.

949
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,320
Let me see.

950
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,520
- Should I put his coat on?
- No.

951
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,680
Lie down over there. A neurologist
is coming to see you.

952
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,600
Let's start with the EKG, Mrs. Sandu.

953
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,560
First, you have
left ventricular hypertrophy

954
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,240
meaning your blood pressure is high.

955
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,160
It's not serious, but you should be
careful with the effort.

956
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,520
Tell her, doctor, cause
she doesn't want to listen to me.

957
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,040
And you also have a beginning
of calcification on your aorta.

958
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,880
I値l take you on our way out,
but first you need to be examined.

959
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,520
I will prescribe you a treatment,
and I'd like you to follow it.

960
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,920
You should also check
with your own physician.

961
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,320
no more salt, fat, effort,
coffee and alcohol.

962
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:23,240
You're done with those.
You go on diet and rest.

963
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,480
We booked a spa holiday.
Would that be Ok for her?

964
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,160
We booked a spa holiday.
Would that be Ok for her?

965
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,160
Of course.
Rest doesn't mean no activity.

966
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:35,520
We celebrate 40 years of marriage,
and we wanted to go in a special place.

967
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,120
Congratulations.

968
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,080
So, where's the accused?

969
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,320
Did you bring me roses?

970
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,480
I couldn't find,
but I brought you an apple.

971
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,840
Thanks. Over here.

972
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,280
This is instead
of "je t'aime moi non plus".

973
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,280
Here he is. His head hurts and
he's starting to get a right paresis.

974
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,200
He's also sort of dysarthric,
but he drank.

975
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,400
CT scan in about three hours,
cause it's full.

976
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,840
By the way, Trauma Center
turned into slaughterhouse.

977
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,960
His liver is swollen and aching
and he definitely needs a CT scan.

978
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,240
I agree, but in about 3 hours.

979
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,120
- Tell me your name, please.
- Lazarescu Dante Remus.

980
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,560
- Lazarescu Dan?
- Lazarescu Dante Remus.

981
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,200
What is it Mr. Lazarescu,
what's wrong?

982
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:34,160
- My head hurts the morning, today.
- Your head hurts in the morning?

983
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:39,480
- Did you hurt yourself?
- I found him fallen in the tub.

984
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:43,960
- Didn't hurt, I slipped the bathroom.
- You didn't hurt?

985
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,560
Say after me:

986
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,320
Thirty three storks on the roof
of Kogalniceanu's house.

987
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,040
Thirty three storks on the roof...

988
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:05,040
- Say, orange!
- Orange.

989
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,840
- Do you feel the same thing here?
- Yes.

990
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,080
I would ask you to follow my finger.
With your sight...

991
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,200
Down.

992
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,560
- Do you see clear or double?
- Clear.

993
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,080
Relax your eye lid.

994
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,320
<i>Good night,
and I say you should take a cab.</i>

995
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,080
Now, bring your left forefinger
to the top of your nose, like I do.

996
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,360
And now, the right forefinger.

997
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,080
Squeeze my hands, please.

998
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,960
Raise your hands.
Close your eyes.

999
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,800
Now open your eyes.

1000
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,960
I will ask you to raise your knees.
Both of them at the same time.

1001
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,800
Now!

1002
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,280
Come on, stand up, make a few steps.

1003
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:25,400
- I don't think he can.
- Come on Mr. Remus, you can do it.

1004
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,680
All right. Lie down.

1005
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,960
Tell me,
what did you do this morning?

1006
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,040
I woke up 6.

1007
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,400
- I woke up a headache.
- You woke up with a headache.

1008
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,600
- Did you drink anything?
- I took Distonocalm.

1009
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,320
Saturday morning I was back.

1010
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:15,840
- In market to switch the seeds.
- To switch the seeds? What seeds?

1011
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:24,680
Instead of pansies he gave me turf.
And I went to get money back.

1012
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:31,520
It was the man with moustaches.

1013
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:37,000
- Yeah? What is this?
- You mean...

1014
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,280
- I mean what is this, what is its name?
- You asking me, aren't you?

1015
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,600
What is the name
of the object on my wrist?

1016
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,400
If you know, why do you ask?
It's the time.

1017
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,840
- What is this?
- A writer.

1018
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,760
You said
you found him in the bathroom.

1019
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:09,480
Yes. When I got there, his neighbor
was pulling him out of the bathtub.

1020
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:22,440
Well, I don't know what to do.
I definitely need a head CT scan.

1021
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:27,760
It might be a hematoma, but
it might be something else, too.

1022
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:34,600
We were sent from St Spiridon
for blood tests and a CT scan.

1023
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,120
Well, they've sent you for nothing,
the tomograph is full.

1024
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,720
No way to get a CT scan
for the next three hours.

1025
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,640
And even if you get one,
the Neurosurgery is also full.

1026
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,080
I mean, work around the clock,
like a power plant.

1027
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,360
You might have something in your head
that needs to be operated.

1028
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,000
A blood clot we have to remove.

1029
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:03,080
Did you understand what I said?
Did you?

1030
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,840
Lazarescu's hemogram.
The transaminases will take a while.

1031
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,400
Thanks.

1032
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:17,920
That's it. He needs a CT scan,
to know what we're talking about.

1033
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,520
And I'm afraid it can't wait.

1034
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,080
She should take him
to Filaret Hospital.

1035
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,440
They have both
CT scanner and Neurosurgery.

1036
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,240
Check this out.

1037
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:37,120
Look at. the potassium value,
and glycemia.

1038
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,600
That's it. Take him to Filaret.

1039
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,400
Stop fooling around.

1040
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,640
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

1041
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:05,200
Dragos, I'll call the tomograph.
It's only a few minutes, after all.

1042
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,600
Ok.

1043
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,000
Wait another minute.
I'll check the tomograph.

1044
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,640
- I'm not coward, madam.
- What do you say?

1045
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,160
I is not afraid of surgery.

1046
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,120
This surgery is very simple.
It's like appendicitis.

1047
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:28,840
I did ulcer surgery, and not afraid.

1048
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:34,960
You had ulcer surgery?
Then it's even simpler.

1049
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:39,640
<i>- Gina Filip from General Care.
- The bombs got the house store.</i>

1050
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,040
The bombs?
Take out your tongue, please.

1051
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,240
You were in the war?

1052
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:57,600
In '44 Americans bombed Bucharest,
Ploiesti and Brazi. We were in Brazi.

1053
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:04,240
Me and Evelina succeeded.

1054
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,160
Put him on.
Hello dr. Johnny.

1055
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:12,360
Come on, won't you make an effort?
We need a quick scan.

1056
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,320
And after those?

1057
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,720
Cranial and hepatic.

1058
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,360
And if I'd say he's the uncle of
my mother in law, will you help me?

1059
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,040
I do it for Gina.

1060
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,240
It looks like a hematoma
but it might be a neoplasm as well.

1061
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,960
You're the man. Thanks

1062
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,440
- Breslasu.
- Come on, he's a good fellow.

1063
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,720
So it's settled.
Now run to the tomograph,

1064
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:49,680
and tell dr. Breslasu you were sent
by me. That is, Dragos Popescu.

1065
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,880
Mr. patient is asleep.

1066
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,360
What are you doing Mrs. Bubulina?
What are you waiting for?

1067
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:07,080
I need a Colebil, my gall hurts.
Do you have any?

1068
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,000
Boys, come on, I have a job for you.

1069
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,320
<i>Doctor? Phone call for you.</i>

1070
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,120
Yes, I'll be right there.

1071
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,320
I'm gonna leave you, "mi amor".
Duty calls.

1072
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,920
Aren't you going to the tomograph,
with the lady?

1073
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,600
- No, I have an emergency.
- Yes, but anyway.,.

1074
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,840
If I have an emergency,
it means I don't have time.

1075
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,240
- Do you know where the CT is?
- But aren't you keeping him here?

1076
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:56,880
I don't think so. If he has a hematoma,
you have to take him to Filaret.

1077
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,160
Here, both operating rooms are. busy
with the accident from Saftica.

1078
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,760
Maybe they got free.

1079
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,440
Don't push your luck, OK?

1080
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,640
- I have to go, good bye,
- Your stamp.

1081
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,080
My stamp and my pen.

1082
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,600
Get moving, and be careful not to loose
the paramedic on your way.

1083
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,760
Good morning.

1084
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,520
- November 19th, a Scorpio?
- Yes, like my brother.

1085
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,360
Hurry up. No need to wait for the rest
of the tests. It's irrelevant.

1086
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,960
CT is on the 4th floor,
the boys will lead the way.

1087
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,440
Who's next? Come in.

1088
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,280
Goodbye.

1089
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,040
- Where are you going? Stay still.
- I can't get up.

1090
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,480
That's what I'm saying.

1091
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,240
Do you know where you are?

1092
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,520
We're going to make a scan, to see if
there's something wrong with your head.

1093
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,840
There's a certain something
about you, lady.

1094
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,400
Ok, stay put and be quiet.

1095
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,120
- Do you still need me?
- No, you go.

1096
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,760
Is she coming with Virgil?

1097
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:42,880
- Say it again.
- Is she coming with Virgil?

1098
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:50,200
- Beats me. Who's Virgil?
- Virgil Muscalu.

1099
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:55,080
I don't know Mr. Lazarescu,
I don't understand what you're saying.

1100
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:01,720
- Eva second husband.
- Second husband? I don't get it.

1101
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,440
With the express train?

1102
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,080
Oh Lord, what did I do wrong?

1103
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:13,840
If you keep on speaking
I will tie your tongue.

1104
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,800
- Mariana.
- What are you doing, girl?

1105
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,760
Kiss, kiss.

1106
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:24,000
Are you on duty or you came
to see me in action?

1107
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,800
I'm so lucky you're here.

1108
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,560
Won't you help me to put in a patient?
I'm walking with him since 10.

1109
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:31,840
Just a second.

1110
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:38,560
- But weren't you working at the MRI?
- No, I've always worked here.

1111
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,600
Please don't move.

1112
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:46,000
- Say, what's the story?
- I brought him for a CT scan.

1113
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,960
- Dr. Dragos Popescu spoke with your dr.
- So? I'll go tell him.

1114
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:53,160
Take this too.

1115
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,440
It's gonna be alright.

1116
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,080
- We'll see on the CT scan.
- I have my wife in there...

1117
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:07,040
Mariana!

1118
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,360
Be quiet girl.

1119
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,200
Listen, did you get
the invitation from Doina?

1120
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,040
How does it seem, the wedding party
at the Intercontinental Hotel?

1121
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,920
- Expensive. I can't afford it, really.
- But you believe her daughter's luck?

1122
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,120
You know her son in law's father
is a social-democrat senator.

1123
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,920
- Big deal, what a catch.
- Admit it, it's not bad.

1124
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,560
Now you need to do your hair,
don't you?

1125
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,640
Never mind the hair,
my dress isn't ready yet.

1126
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,360
Look at the dark circles I've got
for two weeks now.

1127
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:38,400
- See if you catch some big fish there.
- Shut your mouth, I'm a married woman.

1128
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,200
What about your son,
when is he going to get married?

1129
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,920
I don't know,
It's his family, his life.

1130
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,520
If he likes living in concubinage,
it's his business.

1131
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:51,040
Well, as long as they love each other
it's like being married.

1132
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:56,720
But I can't see my grand daughter
as often as I'd like to.

1133
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:00,240
You have no idea what a disparity
I have with her mom.

1134
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:03,600
You do look great, babe.
Tell me, what do you do?

1135
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:08,120
What do I do... I'm on a dairy diet,
if you know what I mean.

1136
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,440
Didn't you say
you're a married woman?

1137
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,080
Hold your tongue,
my man is the "milkman".

1138
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:17,640
Nothing to do with you, then.
I thought you were a feminist.

1139
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,440
- Can you open us miss?
- In a second, Hold on.

1140
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,120
Come on, boys.

1141
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:53,680
You have to trust it will be alright.

1142
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:56,280
Come inside.

1143
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,640
Good evening.

1144
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,600
So you're the uncle
of Dragos's mother in law?

1145
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,520
- Does he have any tests done?
- Yes, here you are.

1146
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:21,080
But sir has raised a glass tonight.
We sure did, we raised some Sauvignon.

1147
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:27,320
- What did you say your name was?
- Lazarescu Dante Remus.

1148
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:32,480
- Once again, please, and from the heart.
- Lazarescu Dante Remus.

1149
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,320
Give me the form,
to get him registered.

1150
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,280
You have a big name, uncle Lazarescu.

1151
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:47,840
We're gonna take a picture of you, now.
Does it make you happy?

1152
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:55,720
So, pops, something's broken here
and there's something here as well.

1153
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,040
The tests say so, you see?

1154
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:01,640
It will be quick,
we're skipping the contrast

1155
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,120
and we'll have a picture of
the liver and one of the loft.

1156
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:07,400
Hold this.

1157
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:13,200
- Say, Mr. Dante, does it hurt now?
- My belly swelled my back.

1158
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:16,600
- How did you say? What did he say?
- His stomach aches.

1159
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,880
We picked him up with nausea.
He was saying that his head hurts.

1160
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,800
The neighbor that found him
said he vomited blood.

1161
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,640
Maybe there were tomato peelings.

1162
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,880
- No, he said he vomited vines of blood.
- Define vines of blood.

1163
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,000
I don't know, that's what he said.

1164
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,400
- Let's put him on the slide,
- Yes, doctor.

1165
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:47,120
Easy pops, don't worry,
nothing bad will happen.

1166
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:59,160
Any metal on you? The necklace stays.
Any coins in your pockets?

1167
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,840
We'll lose the belt a little, yes?

1168
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:07,440
- Can you help me to get him admitted?
- Wait a second, to finish the scan.

1169
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,040
Allow me.

1170
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:21,720
I need something from you.
Don't move or the picture will blur.

1171
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:26,520
If you get any idea you'd like to share
just speak in the microphone.

1172
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,400
- Give me those.
- Which ones?

1173
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,840
- This one.
- I'm cold.

1174
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,200
And what do you want me to do?

1175
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,680
Run around the spot a little,
to warm up.

1176
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,880
It says here you gave him glucose.
Did you?

1177
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,680
Yeah, The man was weak and confused.
I gave him an analgesic too.

1178
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:51,440
- And if it's a CVA?
- But they did the same at St. Spiridon.

1179
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,640
Well, that changes everything.
Let's give him 4 more.

1180
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:58,080
- Doctor, he wet himself,
- I need toilet.

1181
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,440
- Great pops, to your health.
- I need toilet miss.

1182
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,120
Don't stress yourself,
or you might crap yourself as well.

1183
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,160
I want you to give me...

1184
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:12,520
Pops, right now you pissed yourself,
we'll take the picture

1185
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,680
and afterwards we'll get changed.

1186
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,440
- I want pajama.
- Never mind the pajama.

1187
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:20,960
First the picture
and then the pajama, OK?

1188
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:25,120
- I want the pajama.
- Pops, pay attention,

1189
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,560
We'll go to the toilet,
but first we need to get the picture.

1190
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:34,880
Nurse, I want to wash, I'm...

1191
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,920
Do you have something to give him,
'cause I don't.

1192
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:40,200
- Yes dr. I have his pajama.
- I want to toilet, I want to wash.

1193
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:46,800
Come over here and help the lady
change him and all.

1194
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:49,720
I want toilet...

1195
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:59,080
- Easy.
- Easy, easy.

1196
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:02,600
- The legs,
- What did you do pops, wet yourself?

1197
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,720
The legs hurt... easy.

1198
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,680
- What's that on your legs?
- Why don't you tell you have varicose?

1199
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:13,520
Did you plan on making us a surprise?

1200
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:17,120
Slow. Easy.
Let me get those wet pants off.

1201
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:22,440
Don't be s o ashamed,
you're not the first one.

1202
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,600
Easy, easy with the leg.

1203
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,840
Lift your leg. Careful.

1204
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,320
Sorry.

1205
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:47,320
Stop moaning like an old woman.

1206
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,160
- That's it, get him up.
- Wait boys. Just a second doctor.

1207
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,080
- Ah, these hands. Ready.
- Up.

1208
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:03,960
Mind your head, easy.

1209
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,920
Upper, easy, like that.
Easy, easy.

1210
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,880
Ready, doctor.

1211
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,880
Ready pops, satisfied?
See, it's done,

1212
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:21,560
You peed, they've changed you,
and they've put your pajama on.

1213
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,520
It won't be long.

1214
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,800
And if you feel anything else
coming on, please, hold yourself.

1215
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,400
Come on, Mariana.

1216
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:37,200
- You're losing your papers.
- It's not mine. It's Mr. Lazarescu's.

1217
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,440
Ok, keep your eyes closed
and stay still.

1218
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:59,240
It was somewhere over here,
but I don't find it...

1219
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,680
There it is.

1220
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:06,680
The bigger one, if you please.

1221
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,280
You got yourself a bunch of rags.

1222
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:22,120
Mariana, love,
bring me another frapuccino.

1223
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,880
- And bring one for the lady from 911.
- You're very kind.

1224
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,520
- No sugar?
- No sugar,

1225
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:33,960
What are you saying?
Mr. Lazarescu?

1226
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:40,200
If we move, we spoil the photo.
Don't breathe now.

1227
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,520
We'll start the launch.
Steady now!

1228
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,600
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

1229
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,920
We begin with the head
and we stop at Stalingrad.

1230
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,000
Here's your coffee, doctor,

1231
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,200
We're clear about the head.

1232
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,880
If he takes anti-clotting drugs
for the varicose, Heparin, Sintrom...

1233
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:23,560
.. he's dead.
Not dead. Dead and buried.

1234
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,040
And we're back.

1235
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:30,240
Mariana go and position the gentleman
for the abdominal scan please.

1236
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,760
We're done with the head.

1237
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:42,520
We値l take a picture of your abdomen
and we're finished.

1238
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,120
Did you hear what I said?

1239
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,080
Mister?

1240
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:56,960
Hey, mister?

1241
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:00,240
Gee, you scared me. He fell asleep.

1242
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:04,320
Come on, help me raise him.
We're getting up a bit.

1243
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:12,640
Is it ok?
We'll be ready right away.

1244
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:26,120
Ok, we lay down slowly.

1245
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,720
Slowly. Enough.

1246
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,960
We keep our hands behind our head.

1247
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,080
You hold him, he's feeble.

1248
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,360
We will tie them a bit.

1249
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:02,280
We close our eyes.

1250
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,080
And it turns out
the good doctor was right.

1251
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,760
This neoplasm
is Discovery channel stuff.

1252
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:32,240
It deserves a snapshot, doesn't it?
Smile please.

1253
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:37,040
I've also thought he has a cancer.

1254
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,960
I'd say you better stop playing
the doctor, better watch that glucose.

1255
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,600
I was joking.

1256
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:59,240
The way our Mr. Lazarescu looks
you could have injected him compote.

1257
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,840
He's departing, poor pops.

1258
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:17,080
The film will take a little while.
Mariana, get him out.

1259
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,560
Yes.

1260
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,280
- Lady?
- Yes, doctor.

1261
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:39,480
You wait for the films and you take him
to Neurosurgery, to drill his head.

1262
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,640
- Ok.
- Ok?

1263
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,840
Yes, doctor, I understand.
To Neurosurgery.

1264
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,720
Mariana, there's a client waiting here.
Mariana!

1265
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,280
<i>Yes, I'll be right there.</i>

1266
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,640
You take him straight to Floreasca,
Bagdasar, you choose

1267
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:10,000
and get him into the operating room
to have him instantly operated.

1268
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:13,560
- What is it?
- Didn't they give you a note downstairs?

1269
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:16,800
- Yes, for Filaret Hospital.
- Very well, take him to Filaret.

1270
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,680
- From the accident?
- What?

1271
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,520
The gentleman,
is he from the bus accident?

1272
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,760
I don't know, they sent me from ER.

1273
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:32,960
- That's it. He needs immediate surgery.
- Couldn't you keep him in here, doctor?

1274
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:36,720
If you gave him a pajama,
can't you give him a bed too?

1275
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:41,080
- Yes doctor, can't we help her?
- Look at them. They got me surrounded.

1276
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:45,000
Where to put him?
Don't you know surgery is full?

1277
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:48,240
The Neurosurgery is full to the brink.
You'll take this one to Filaret,

1278
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:51,800
quickly operate his hematoma, so that
he can die at home, from cancer.

1279
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,880
Please doc!

1280
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:59,440
Don't be a piglet! You think
I wouldn't keep him, if I could?

1281
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,680
Didn't you hear it's an emergency?
He needs surgery right now.

1282
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,720
Where do we take him, doctor?

1283
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:19,160
Tell him it's a subdural hematoma
with intracranial pressure.

1284
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:23,320
- You owe me for this.
- If it works.

1285
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:27,040
If it works? You owe me, period,
How long?

1286
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:33,160
And the other one?
I got it, thanks.

1287
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:39,840
Bad luck, nurse. Both rooms are busy,
and will stay like this until 10 am.

1288
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,680
Go and position him for a cervical.

1289
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:50,440
If you want, I can take him
straight to the crematorium.

1290
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,480
He keeps saying he's cold, anyway.

1291
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,760
Neurosurgery is full.
Enough, time out.

1292
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:02,560
Come on, give me this to sign, stamp,
everything in order.

1293
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:07,440
I've been running around with him
the whole night.

1294
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,800
You exaggerate a bit,
the night is still young.

1295
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,200
I thought it might get solved
if you'd speak at Neurosurgery.

1296
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:18,160
Well it didn't.

1297
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,280
You should start going
or he might die on the way.

1298
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,760
Nice meeting you.
Careful not to spoil them.

1299
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,880
I'm sorry, bye.
Good luck.

1300
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:30,440
This way Mioara.

1301
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,360
Sit there quietly.
That's why you feel ill.

1302
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,240
If you think you'll throw up,
let me know.

1303
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,200
Once, we used to chat about your grief.

1304
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,120
You, son of a bitch!

1305
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,240
What's he saying?

1306
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,240
I don't understand.

1307
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:05,200
medication - 500.000

1308
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:10,320
consult, another 500,
CT scan - 2 millions.

1309
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:15,040
Admittance, bed, meals - more money.
What do you think?

1310
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:18,320
- I'm thirsty.
- You're dodging the question.

1311
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:26,200
There's the vehicle too.
Fuel, service, spares and all.

1312
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,840
- And we earn less than nothing.
- I'm thirsty folks.

1313
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,160
My gall again.

1314
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:40,840
Imagine the bus driver. What misfortune.
In the end there are only 11 dead.

1315
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:47,760
- Hold on, I have some water. Still water.
- It's ok. Pass it here.

1316
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:09,000
Have you never thought about marrying?
Do you like being single?

1317
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:13,640
Don't even mention it, I've got
my divorce a year and a half ago.

1318
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:18,320
- You don't say. Were you married?
- Yes and I have a two year old daughter.

1319
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,880
I can't believe it.

1320
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:26,880
You're such a messed up generation.
You already got a divorce,

1321
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:33,880
my son already has a kid and he's not
married his wife yet. Really now!

1322
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:40,480
- We're just getting by.
- My son has a daughter too. Mihaela.

1323
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:43,800
I call her Mica.

1324
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:50,520
- Who would've said you were married?
- You see.

1325
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:54,600
- What is your daughter's name?
- Geanina.

1326
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:58,320
Geanina. What a beautiful name.

1327
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:09,200
She's beautiful too. The little thing.
She's got brown eyes like me.

1328
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:17,560
I hope you don't mind, but it's not
good you divorced your ex-wife.

1329
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,520
For the child, I mean.

1330
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:52,600
- Good evening.
- Good evening was 8 hours ago.

1331
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,920
I brought a patient from Universitar.

1332
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:58,960
- Bring him in.
- Come on.

1333
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,720
You know what I forgot to tell you?

1334
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,960
Hold on, she'll be right back.

1335
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:15,360
<i>Be calm, we'll be done in a second.</i>

1336
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:22,720
What's wrong with him?

1337
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:26,200
- For neurosurgery, a subdural hematoma.
- Give me the record.

1338
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,840
Didn't you notice he wet himself?

1339
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:36,960
He just did it, on the way here.
We've been running around since 10.

1340
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:44,920
- You wet yourself. So, what happened?
- Have... pan... belly between us.

1341
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,240
I don't understand you.
Corina, are you finished there?

1342
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:53,160
- Check his blood pressure.
- Right away.

1343
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,640
<i>You wet yourself.</i>

1344
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:12,920
Come on, easy.

1345
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:23,520
- You have cold handle.
- I have a cold handle?

1346
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:27,000
We're coming from Universitar.

1347
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,160
It's mobbed over there, from
the car crash. They sent us here.

1348
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,280
He's been throwing up
and he has a headache.

1349
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,720
Wouldn't have been better
to keep him there?

1350
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:40,280
I don't think they could.
They only have one neurosurgery room.

1351
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:49,400
- They have two.
- I only know of one.

1352
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,600
They should have sent you to Bagdasar,
which is meant for neurosurgery.

1353
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,960
That's right.
You should have known this.

1354
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:02,040
He needed operated right away.

1355
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:11,960
Mr. Lazarescu, can you hear me?
Do you know where you are?

1356
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:13,840
Look at me.

1357
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:17,000
Follow this pen.

1358
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,280
Yes.

1359
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,680
Look how messy you are.
When did he start being confused?

1360
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,840
This is the 3rd hospital already.

1361
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:39,200
At St. Spiridon they told me he's drunk
and he needs a CT scan...

1362
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,480
.. and from Universitar
they've sent us here.

1363
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,680
- Where do you live?
- Maroshva... Mures...

1364
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:50,400
- You live in Bucharest.
- The lady from emergency...

1365
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,520
We can't establish a dialogue.

1366
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:57,440
He also has liver neoplasm.
He needs surgery right away.

1367
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:02,000
- Does it bother you if I have a look?
- But the results are in there and...

1368
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:06,480
Because if it bothers you
I will ask you to let me do my job

1369
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,520
and go wait outside.

1370
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:12,600
I apologize, but it's 20 past 3,

1371
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:16,080
we're an ambulance service,
there are other patients...

1372
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:20,160
The pulse is 110.
Why the surprise? Are you new?

1373
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:22,920
Don't you know, sometimes
in a hospital, you have to wait?

1374
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:25,720
- No, I don't know.
- Nurse, go tie the bathroom.

1375
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:28,840
I've been working in this
for 16 years, if it matters.

1376
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:31,920
- Should I dress him up?
- Yes.

1377
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:40,400
What cancer are we talking about?
Does he have a biopsy test?

1378
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,520
Abnormal structures.
Do you know what this is?

1379
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:50,040
Are you familiar with the terminology?

1380
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:53,000
The biopsy will tell
if it's cancer or not.

1381
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:57,240
Thanks miss resident. Teach me
some medicine. We have all night.

1382
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:59,680
<i>The backs are scratchy.</i>

1383
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:03,200
Good Lord, the tests are clear.
Check his record.

1384
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:10,320
Let me explain how we stand.
It's 3 am and we're tired too.

1385
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,440
You do your job, we'll do ours.
And don't you patronize me.

1386
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,200
May I pass?

1387
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:22,160
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes, we're well.

1388
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:24,160
- Who's with you?
- His brother in law.

1389
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:26,720
Your brother in law
can take you home then.

1390
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:29,800
- Miss, can we hurry up a bit, please?
- Don't you have anything else to do?

1391
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:32,880
Think.
Have you filed his data?

1392
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:37,040
Look, the nurse is waiting for you,
to file him.

1393
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,800
- I see you want to satisfy your ego.
- Is the prescription ready?

1394
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,960
How can you talk to me like this?
I have a kid your age.

1395
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:48,200
Spare me the lecture, will you?
You all think you know better.

1396
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,280
Does anybody have a Nokia charger?

1397
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,760
What's with this smell?
Open a window or something.

1398
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:59,640
- Miss Corina, open the window.
- It's stuck, doctor.

1399
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,320
- And it doesn't bother you?
- It does, but what can I do?

1400
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:06,040
- What's with this one?
- He has an SDH.

1401
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:13,080
He's the one who smells. Couldn't they
clean him up at Universitar?

1402
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:16,360
He did it in the car, on our way here.

1403
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:21,160
The way he looks,
he needs urgent surgery.

1404
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:30,440
Up we go, slowly,
there's no hurry.

1405
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:35,680
Laura what kind of cell phone
do you have?

1406
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,560
- Like this one?
- Yes.

1407
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:41,240
Can I have the battery for a minute?

1408
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,560
My wife is traveling with the boy
and I have to wake her up

1409
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:47,080
so she won't forget
to get off the train.

1410
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,000
- You can use this.
- No, just the battery.

1411
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:52,000
- It's alright, really.
- OK, I'll make a quick call.

1412
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:57,440
- And the paramedic gave us a lecture.
- I only said he needs surgery.

1413
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:00,600
And who decides that?
You or a specialist?

1414
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:03,120
- The doctor from Universitar...
- So, a specialist...

1415
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,160
Yes, dr. Breslasu...

1416
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:10,440
- And what is dr. Breslasu?
- A specialist.

1417
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:22,640
His id card.

1418
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:29,080
- No coverage. Can I try again later?
- Sure.

1419
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,000
- Who's with him?
- Me.

1420
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:35,320
No, lady, has he someone?
Wife, sister, mistress?

1421
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:38,200
He has a sister
coming from Targu Mures.

1422
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:41,400
So he hasn't.
Pay some attention.

1423
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,600
Like this.

1424
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:48,160
I'll come here
so you can follow me better.

1425
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,920
My name is Mirica
and I'm the neurosurgeon on duty.

1426
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:54,040
Let me explain you where we stand.
According to the CT scan,

1427
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:57,280
there are reasons to believe
you have a subdural hematoma.

1428
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,840
This causes the head aches
and the vomiting.

1429
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:04,160
- My head aches from the ulcer.
- Yes, it aches, but from the hematoma.

1430
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:08,440
It is normal to be so, although
the vomiting could be from the liver.

1431
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:12,760
- I have a headache and belly sir.
- Hold it.

1432
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:16,680
Your stance is good,
but stop moving and talking

1433
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,440
I don't understand
what you're saying,

1434
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:23,760
You're not in a coma,
you're not lethargic.

1435
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:27,560
You feel a bit sleepy. Me too.
It's 3.35 am.

1436
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:31,280
- Do you have any relatives?
- I have ulcer.

1437
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:35,160
He has a sister, I told you.
He requires immediate surgery.

1438
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:38,560
He has dysarthria.
Dr. Breslasu told me this.

1439
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:43,280
And look, he also has a hemi paresis.

1440
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:50,800
Unbelievable, isn't it?
I thought the doctor was exaggerating

1441
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:53,760
but you really
don't show us any respect.

1442
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:57,600
I'm sorry, but I only said
that we need to hurry up.

1443
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:00,680
- We've been on the road since 10 pm.
- You don't say!

1444
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:05,200
You should start by learning your place
and letting us do our job.

1445
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:10,560
But you told me to get out, miss.
We're all medical staff in here.

1446
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:15,960
No, we are medical staff
of different qualification, nurse.

1447
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:20,040
You don't go teaching me, a doctor,
the procedures.

1448
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:23,720
Doing that is called insolence.
And from this very moment,

1449
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:27,120
if you want to stay
I will ask you to keep your mouth shut.

1450
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:30,920
- Or else, you can wait in the hallway.
- Stamp my record and I'll go.

1451
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:35,240
- What did you say?
- If you stamp it I will go.

1452
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,280
I thought it's the doctor
who decides that too.

1453
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:41,960
I'll have to repeat myself:

1454
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:46,400
nurse, you can either shut up
and let me do my work

1455
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:49,400
or exit, down the hallway.

1456
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:54,760
So, you have a subdural hematoma
that requires surgery.

1457
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:57,120
Please bring a disclaimer.

1458
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,760
Fill it in, please.

1459
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,360
We have to operate this hematoma,
but to do this, I need you to sign

1460
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:07,040
that you agree
to undertake all the risks.

1461
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:15,000
- Now, you know what a hematoma is?
- Yes, I have a cruise.

1462
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:18,520
- What?
- A bruise.

1463
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:24,120
Right. It's a broken vessel that bleeds
between dura mater and the arachnoid.

1464
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:27,440
It creates a pressure, to be more
specific, it pushes on the brain.

1465
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:30,680
And this is where we intervene.
If we don't, it's lethal.

1466
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:36,000
- Doctor, watch the trolley.
- Yes,

1467
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:38,280
Pay attention.

1468
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:42,800
The surgery is not without hazards and
it is my duty to inform you about them.

1469
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:46,240
There are some colleagues that do it
differently, but I don't think it's fair.

1470
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:48,760
The patient must be fully informed.

1471
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:53,640
Yes, it's a problem of mortality.

1472
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:57,960
Oh, be serious.
Can you die from appendicitis?

1473
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,440
It's just like appendicitis.

1474
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:04,600
There is a risk of paralyzing. It's true.
Loosing control of the limbs.

1475
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:09,600
I don't want paralysis, to hand,
in here.

1476
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:13,080
You don't want to paralyze.
Who says you will?

1477
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:18,720
Can you hear me? There is a risk.
Because of it the patient has to sign.

1478
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:24,280
- Have to go to...
- No. Pay attention.

1479
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:27,480
You got drunk. You smell of booze.

1480
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:30,200
You fell, hit your head
and you got a hematoma.

1481
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:33,920
We will take it out
but for this, I need you to sign.

1482
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,520
Say again, I didn't get you.

1483
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:43,680
Have to go to Christmas...
with girl Bianca.

1484
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:47,600
Rest assured,
we won't get to Christmas.

1485
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:50,000
Look, we're going
to the operating room.

1486
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,600
But before, I need your signature.

1487
02:09:54,800 --> 02:10:00,160
- Eva with her husband comes.
- Pay a bit of attention.

1488
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:04,440
Pay attention.
She will take care of you.

1489
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:07,160
You have to sign a paper.
Give me the form please.

1490
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:11,520
Sign this, so I can operate you.
Place it on something.

1491
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:16,920
Do you understand me?
You have to sign a paper.

1492
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:22,600
Mr. Lazarescu.
This is a disclaimer. You see?

1493
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:28,800
I've filled in your name,
Now you have to sign that you agree.

1494
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:36,080
Come on, I'll help you. Take this pen
and sign, so that he can operate you.

1495
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:43,280
- I can't paralyze.,.
- You won't, sign here.

1496
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:48,880
- Sign here Mr. Lazarescu.
- ... Evelina on New Year's Eve.

1497
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:51,640
Mr. Lazarescu, do you sign?

1498
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:03,680
What do we do, doc?

1499
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:06,600
So, what's it gonna be? Will you
sign so I can operate you, or not?

1500
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:10,040
Doc, he's in no condition to sign.
He can't even hold the pen.

1501
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:14,440
Should we break the law, nurse?
Look at her, she wants me in jail.

1502
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:18,920
If I operate without the signature
and he dies on the table

1503
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:21,120
I'll go straight to jail, madam.

1504
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:24,440
Come on, sign and we'll admit you
to the hospital, we'll clean you,

1505
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:27,080
operate you and tomorrow
you'll be brand new.

1506
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:30,160
- No.
- No what?

1507
02:11:31,240 --> 02:11:35,760
Want medicine in my home,
at drugstore,

1508
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:41,880
You're aphasic and you have dysarthria.
I don't know what you are saying.

1509
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:50,200
- Do you want to go home?
- Will you come to my home?

1510
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:02,480
Calm down, we're not gonna force you.
If you don't want to sign don't do it.

1511
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:08,640
Have you recorded his admittance?
Good.

1512
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:15,520
the patient refuses the surgery.

1513
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:19,160
It's the patient that has to sign,
not you.

1514
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:21,200
Didn't you see he doesn't want to?

1515
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:24,320
- On my record, I mean.
- No kidding.

1516
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:30,120
And if he signs, but he's mentally
unable, then the signature is useless.

1517
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:33,880
Better admit you don't want
to operate him and I'll take him away.

1518
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:37,240
- Take him where?
- To Bagdasar Hospital.

1519
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,880
Or back to Universitar,
I guess they're not swamped anymore.

1520
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:45,320
Sorry, but I think I can tell
when a patient is confused or not.

1521
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:50,920
<i>Now you're quarrelling
with the doc too.</i>

1522
02:12:56,760 --> 02:13:03,720
Or you know what? Get him in the car,
drive for about an hour,

1523
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:06,920
get him in a coma
and then bring him for surgery.

1524
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:09,280
No need for signatures
or relatives, anymore.

1525
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:13,240
Right now he didn't sign,
so I can't operate him.

1526
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:19,080
As you're so good at Law and Medicine,
find him the proper hospital.

1527
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:23,280
He didn't sign me the paper so I have
no obligation or responsibility.

1528
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:26,320
Or go to Bagdasar and find a doctor...

1529
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:33,720
.. that will operate
without a disclaimer.

1530
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:36,720
But if he dies in the car
it will be your responsibility.

1531
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:38,840
Don't want.

1532
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:47,640
- What do you not want?
- Don't want.

1533
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:50,320
Nurse, get him out of here.

1534
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:54,000
When you decide what you want
from us I'll be here, on duty.

1535
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:59,160
Call for an orderly, to get him out.
Why are you staring at me?

1536
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:01,160
Get him in the car
and take him to Bagdasar.

1537
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:02,960
Good bye, have a nice trip.

1538
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:07,880
Come on Mr. Lazarescu.
We're going to Bagdasar.

1539
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:31,800
I'll go downstairs, to get a croissant.

1540
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:36,040
Would you like anything?

1541
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:17,520
- It doesn't smell that bad anymore.
- I didn't get that.

1542
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,880
- What did you say?
- I said I didn't get that.

1543
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:25,480
The smell is not so bad anymore.

1544
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:47,280
Can you let us pass?

1545
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:53,560
Hold on. I'll go with the record.

1546
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:07,640
Good morning!

1547
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:14,880
- I've brought a patient.
- Speak with the chef nurse.

1548
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:19,960
The record.

1549
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:37,040
He soiled himself.
We came all the way from Filaret.

1550
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:39,960
Can we bring him in?

1551
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:56,000
- How are you?
- How are we?

1552
02:16:56,560 --> 02:17:02,760
Busy, with all that fuss from
the bus accident, but now it's over.

1553
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:10,040
What did you feed him
that makes him stink so bad?

1554
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:14,000
- Is he drunk too?
- Oh, the poor soul, he soiled himself.

1555
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:16,360
Yes he needs cleaning.

1556
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:20,720
- Dr. Zamfir has to see him first.
- What are you saying there?

1557
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,720
Let me see that.

1558
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,360
He has a subdural hematoma
and has to be operated.

1559
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:35,320
Just a second.

1560
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,360
Here are the CT scans, doctor,

1561
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:47,800
What's that a clot, boss?

1562
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:51,280
Yes, Mrs. Marioara.
A bleeding on the brain.

1563
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:58,040
- It's not that serious, is it?
- It's not, but it could be.

1564
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:06,440
This one is pretty serious.

1565
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:16,480
But it's this shade on the liver
that is more serious.

1566
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:19,760
And I'm afraid nobody can fix this,

1567
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:31,200
What is your name?

1568
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:38,520
Please repeat?

1569
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,880
All right.

1570
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:51,960
Lazarescu Dante Remus.
I didn't get that.

1571
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:56,520
Why didn't they keep him at Filaret?

1572
02:18:57,080 --> 02:19:01,040
He did not want to sign.
He didn't want to be operated.

1573
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:04,520
But I think it's written in the record.

1574
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:10,760
Yes, I saw that, but I don't think that
Mr. Lazarescu Dante Remus understood.

1575
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:14,240
I repeat, understood
what was being asked of him.

1576
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:18,560
Don't tell me he reached this state
on the way over here.

1577
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:21,080
Which is 10 minutes
at this time of night.

1578
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:23,880
It took us longer ma'am.

1579
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:27,520
With getting him out of the hospital
and into the car and then into here

1580
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:31,360
and the road by the river,
it took us about half an hour.

1581
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:35,240
- I see. And you're the driver
- Yes,

1582
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:39,680
Nice to meet you.
Have a seat over there and have a rest.

1583
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:42,200
No thanks, I'll stay here.

1584
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:46,280
- Are we sending him to Neuro?
- Yes, of course.

1585
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:48,600
- Have you recorded his data?
- Yes.

1586
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:51,840
- Anyone with him?
- Yes, a sister.

1587
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:58,600
She's coming from Targu Mures tomorrow.
I mean today, at 6 a. m.

1588
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,200
It means he has no one.

1589
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:05,160
I don稚 understand why
they haven't kept him at Filaret.

1590
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:09,480
Did you show them the results,
or you kept them for yourselves?

1591
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,240
Of course I showed them,
but the patient didn't agree.

1592
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:18,200
Don't worry, nobody will ask
for his agreement anymore.

1593
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:21,640
Write him down with Glasgow 8
and call the Surgery.

1594
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:27,440
- How come it痴 so quiet?
- The shift is almost finished.

1595
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:34,200
We had our daily serving of junkies,
drunks, traumatized, don't you worry.

1596
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:38,000
Hold on.

1597
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:44,200
Yes, hello.
Put Anghel on. Anghel.

1598
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:56,640
We had those from the bus crash
as well. Tough day.

1599
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,880
Are you finished with the lady
so she can leave?

1600
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:01,840
Yes.

1601
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:06,040
Mrs. Marioara, call those boys
to take him and get him to pre-op room.

1602
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:11,640
Doctor, I'm sending you an SDH.
He comes from Filaret.

1603
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:14,640
- Is he with someone?
- He has a sister.

1604
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:17,800
He has a sister that will arrive
from Targu Mures, around 6 a. m.

1605
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:20,880
He has a sister that will arrive
from Targu Mures.

1606
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:25,560
Yes, it's pretty bad.
I wrote him down as unconscious.

1607
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:28,960
Right away.

1608
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:34,600
62 years. I don't know if he's
an alcoholic, but I know he does drink.

1609
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:39,320
Left temporal.
Now, of course.

1610
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:42,680
If I don't send him now,
I won't send him at all.

1611
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:51,240
- Can I have this stamped?
- I can't find the stamp.

1612
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:53,440
Here it is.

1613
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:00,840
- Thank you.
- Take him to pre-op.

1614
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:05,720
Mrs. Marioara, take-him,
clean him and shave him for surgery.

1615
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:11,440
When she's ready, take him
and teleport him to dr. Anghel.

1616
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,640
Are we clear?
Come on, quick.

1617
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,480
Thank you, good evening.

1618
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:30,600
Wait!

1619
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:35,040
Look how dizzy y I am.
Take these and drop them to Anghel's.

1620
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:39,440
Where are you going?
You're done.

1621
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:41,960
They left with our stretcher ma'am.

1622
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:45,120
We'll leave him in the pre-op room,
take our stretcher and go.

1623
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:47,800
Don't we have any stretchers?

1624
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:51,240
Ours are upstairs
and one is in the operating room.

1625
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:54,720
- Just to get him upstairs.
- It won't take long.

1626
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:57,520
We'll take him upstairs
and get down right away.

1627
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,920
Don't forget the papers.

1628
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:23,920
Let me pass.

1629
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:28,800
Here you are.

1630
02:23:30,280 --> 02:23:33,800
They will operate you, to cure you.
Stay still, don't move.

1631
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:38,440
Put him there.

1632
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:44,720
Watch his head.

1633
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:55,040
These are Mr. Lazarescu's clothes.

1634
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:04,440
I'll get the cover off and we'll go.

1635
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:14,400
Mrs. Marioara, you cut his hair and
shave his head. And fast, if possible.

1636
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:21,480
God, what day we had
with that bus accident.

1637
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,160
- Can you manage?
- Yes.

1638
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,120
These people, driving
with no care for the others.

1639
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:38,400
- Yes, you're right.
- I'll be outside, having a smoke.

1640
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:47,480
Out of 14,
only 3 are in better condition.

1641
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:50,640
Good Lord!

1642
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:59,720
It was like in the war,
Like the '77 earthquake.

1643
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,720
Has the driver survived?

1644
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:06,880
I don't know lad.
How could I know which was the driver?

1645
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:14,240
Two more days like this and
they can put me in hospital too.

1646
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:18,440
Come on Mrs. Mioara, I'm done.

1647
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:22,880
Alright, good evening.

1648
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:29,080
Watch his legs, he has varicose.

1649
02:25:33,880 --> 02:25:35,360
My respects.

1650
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:05,880
What did you do pops?
Look at your legs.

1651
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:56,400
Easy.

1652
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:12,080
Get him a cover.

1653
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:32,000
Give me the alcohol.

1654
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:22,040
There you are, handsome.

1655
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:35,200
<i>He's ready, Virgil!</i>

1656
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:39,240
<i>Virgil!
Come and take him to Anghel!</i>

1657
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,840
<i>I can't stay with him here
any longer.</i>
