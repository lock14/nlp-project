1
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,342
Jane! Jane! It's Momma.

2
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,112
Look at me!

3
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:02,814
J-Jane. Jane.

4
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:04,215
No! No!

5
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,554
Oh, thank God.

6
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,557
D'you have another nightmare,
honey?

7
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:17,995
Let's get you
into a nice hot bath, huh?

8
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:20,129
Can I do it later? Please?

9
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,901
All right.
But you have to get ready

10
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:26,571
for your father.
It's his weekend with you.

11
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,972
I know. I know.

12
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:35,546
What's this?

13
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:37,547
I found it in the attic.

14
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,585
Honey, you know
the attic's off-limits.

15
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:41,986
Sorry.

16
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,421
Just don't do it again, okay?

17
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,344
I know how you feel.

18
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,897
November 1848.

19
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,936
I hoped that no one
would ever find cause

20
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:07,438
to open this letter.
If you have,

21
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,106
I must assume
that unexplained...

22
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,044
or even supernatural events

23
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,778
have begun to occur.

24
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,950
The story of the Bell witch

25
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:22,418
had always been considered
to be a tall tale.

26
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,521
This is not so.

27
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:28,523
Please, read this journal
with great care...

28
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,794
...for its contents
may save your life.

29
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:34,497
Now where are you gonna go?

30
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:39,135
- Just one kiss.
- No, Joshua.

31
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,409
Leave that young lady alone.

32
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:53,015
Did he try to kiss you again?

33
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,893
Isn't there something
you should be doing, Miss Bell?

34
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:05,529
Oh, I'm sorry, Mother.
I was thinking about something else...

35
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,266
Probably about torturing poor Joshua.

36
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,335
You really should be nicer to him,
Betsy.

37
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:14,205
A woman must keep a man
on his toes at all times.

38
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,907
Isn't that what you taught me?

39
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:18,175
I taught you no such thing,
Betsy Bell.

40
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,543
I'm gonna make Joshua

41
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:20,845
love me forever.

42
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:24,313
Well, then you better
stop mistreating him.

43
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,283
You think I was too hard on him?

44
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:29,953
Just a little bit.

45
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:36,894
- What would I do without you?
- Oh, you'd just shrivel up

46
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,696
and blow away.
Now, don't forget your schoolwork.

47
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:40,097
I won't!

48
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,839
Good evening, sir.

49
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,308
My hat, thank you.

50
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:03,654
...then James Johnson grabbed it,
swallowed a swig of it,

51
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,622
wiped his mouth,

52
00:06:04,623 --> 00:06:07,890
then he took hold of the wheel
at the axle

53
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:12,496
and in an instant, that carriage
was up and and out of that snowbank

54
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,166
as if 10 men had had a hold of it.
Ten! Ten!

55
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,100
Speak of the devil!

56
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,066
I thought you'd gotten lost!

57
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:19,470
I'm not stewed

58
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:21,539
that I can't find
the fob next door.

59
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,108
I was telling them about you
and that carriage last winter.

60
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,442
- Ha-ha! I did...
- Not yet!

61
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:27,111
...that carriage!

62
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:29,747
With the help
of a good swig of horse liniment.

63
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:30,815
Who has the drink?

64
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:34,083
You're three sheets to the wind
already.

65
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:40,958
- I'm so sorry, Professor Powell.
- It's all right.

66
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,626
They're just having fun.

67
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:44,027
Theny!

68
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,765
Is there not a... tradition
connected to mistletoe,

69
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,934
- Professor Powell?
- Well...

70
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,335
Yes, but...

71
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:56,507
Elizabeth Bell,
it's not appropriate

72
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:59,677
for a student to place a teacher
in such a compromising situation.

73
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:02,179
- You know better than that, precious.
- Well...

74
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,614
it is Christmas, Father.

75
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:06,851
And I am simply attempting
to learn the traditions.

76
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:10,187
Who better to learn from
than one's teacher?

77
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,289
My prize pupil always seems

78
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,725
to have a ready answer
for everything, John.

79
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,593
Would you settle
for a dance, Betsy?

80
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:23,332
Oh, John,
let them have their dance.

81
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:25,503
May I steal this Bell
for a dance?

82
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,237
I promise not to step on your toes.

83
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:54,731
John!

84
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:20,484
John...

85
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:25,019
- I heard noises on the roof.
- It's coming from the attic.

86
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:27,091
Squirrels?

87
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:28,959
No, it's too loud for squirrels.

88
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,861
It's the third time I've heard it

89
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,830
- in as many nights.
- I hadn't heard it.

90
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:34,498
You sleep so sound,

91
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,035
you don't even feel me
get out of bed.

92
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,436
Yes, I do.

93
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,539
Listen.

94
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,909
- It stopped.
- Yeah.

95
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:49,012
What was it?

96
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:52,816
Probably that witch trying to wear
me out before tomorrow's trial.

97
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:55,350
Oh, bite your tongue, John Bell!

98
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:22,479
- Man's a lyin' pig!
- Miss Batts!

99
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,814
Stole my land!

100
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:24,848
Miss Batts,

101
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,249
we have heard

102
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,351
your side of the story.

103
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,055
Please allow John Bell
to finish his.

104
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:34,592
So, we offered her the use
of our slave, Samuel,

105
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,326
and the loan of $100

106
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:39,430
in exchange for our use
of that small piece of her land

107
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,298
- that abuts our own.
- At 20% interest!

108
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,699
We shook on it!

109
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,435
- Oh!
- Spit and shook,

110
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,770
I gave you two harvests to pay

111
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,406
and you didn't pay for it,
so you forfeited the land.

112
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,607
It was a fair price for it.

113
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,611
Twenty-percent interest?

114
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,081
Well...

115
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:02,019
it seemed like a reasonable charge
under the circumstances,

116
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,820
given her reputation.

117
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,261
John Bell,

118
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:13,163
you broke church law.

119
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:15,498
Twenty-percent interest...

120
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
...under church canon...

121
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,136
...is usury.

122
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,404
Miss Batts's land
will be returned to her.

123
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,943
What about my timber?
He took it off my land and sold it!

124
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:27,311
You would not have allowed

125
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:31,081
the cutting of the wood
had you not received that money

126
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:32,916
and the use of the slave.

127
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,485
But he broke church law.

128
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,287
You have the $100 and Samuel.

129
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:39,288
The profit on the land
is John Bell's.

130
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:41,958
His loss,

131
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,394
the loss of his good name...

132
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,230
...is punishment enough.

133
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,634
That's not fair!

134
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:03,514
That's their punishment for you,

135
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,248
John Bell.

136
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:06,450
Just wait until you see mine.

137
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:08,652
Witchery can't touch me, woman.

138
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,320
Treasure your land,

139
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:12,255
health and happy family

140
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:13,957
while you can.

141
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,659
For I swear,

142
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,763
dreadful darkness
will fall upon you.

143
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,164
You...

144
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:24,266
...and your precious daughter too.

145
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:39,516
Kate Batts...

146
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:44,288
...well, she was feared
by everyone in the village.

147
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,422
They were all convinced
she was a witch.

148
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:51,592
So the Bells took her cursing them
very seriously.

149
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:54,164
At the time,

150
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:57,999
I didn't believe in curses,
ghosts or spirits.

151
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:00,704
I do now.

152
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,670
John.

153
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,072
Father, you all right?

154
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,341
Yeah.

155
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:15,245
- We got it, Father.
- The wolf?

156
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:16,646
Wolf?

157
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:18,448
We shot a deer.

158
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:21,784
Come see it, Father.

159
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,631
Father!

160
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,800
I heard it.

161
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:38,468
Back there.

162
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:17,572
Keep your eyes peeled,
it's black as night.

163
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,761
Momma! Momma! Momma!

164
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,563
Oh, let me hold you.

165
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:03,680
Betsy, what was that crash?

166
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,282
Mother, there's
something in my room!

167
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:07,616
There's something in my room!

168
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,554
Oh, the wind blew the window open.
I'll close it.

169
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:12,055
No! There's something in here.

170
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,456
It got inside.

171
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,463
Well, there doesn't seem
to be anything in here now, Betsy.

172
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:21,431
It was probably just mice, darling.

173
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:23,499
I don't think so, Mother.

174
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:27,070
Let's go find your brothers.

175
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:28,471
Come along.

176
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:40,749
Let's go find that big, scary mouse!
Yeah!

177
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:54,931
Everyone all right?

178
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:56,332
We're fine.

179
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,334
Let's get back to bed.

180
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:05,842
You could have killed us.

181
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:08,477
Yeah, it was young John.

182
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,616
- He shot a musket into the house.
- It discharged accidentally.

183
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:14,785
He shot a musket
into the house, John!

184
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:16,519
We were taken aback.

185
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:27,462
I can't get Kate Batts
out of my head.

186
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,534
What's done is done!

187
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:33,637
The church has had its say
and that's that,

188
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:36,171
so just put it out of your mind!

189
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:24,152
Now, class,
who were the couriers

190
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:29,025
ordered to ride to Concord
to warn that the British were coming?

191
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:30,694
- Yes, Theny.
- Paul Revere,

192
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:33,563
- Samuel Prescott and William Dawes.
- Right, Theny.

193
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:35,766
And did they succeed, Betsy?

194
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,167
Betsy?

195
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:42,572
All right, class,
let's leave this for a moment.

196
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:45,041
It's time for your physical exercise
anyway. Fifteen minutes now!

197
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,842
Fifteen minutes only.

198
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:57,087
You all right, Betsy?

199
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:58,488
I'm tired.

200
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:02,890
Our house makes...
strange noises at night.

201
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:05,728
It's hard to sleep.

202
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:39,895
Pass it to me, quick!

203
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:04,513
- Betsy!
- Betsy? You hurt?

204
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,685
- W...where'd she go?
- Who?

205
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:11,021
The girl who was swinging with me.

206
00:22:11,022 --> 00:22:13,489
You were swinging alone, Betsy.

207
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:24,333
- Did you see a girl?
- No.

208
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:17,707
- Betsy! I'm here, darling.
- Momma! Momma!!!

209
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,376
- Momma! Momma!
- It's me! Betsy!

210
00:25:20,377 --> 00:25:22,612
- Momma!!!!!!!!!!!
- Betsy, Momma's here!

211
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:23,980
- Momma!
- Betsy!

212
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,381
Betsy! Betsy.

213
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,287
- It touched me.
- Where?!

214
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:33,723
- Who touched you?
- I don't know.

215
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:35,124
I couldn't see.

216
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:37,393
It was just a bad dream, darling.

217
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:39,061
But it was so real.

218
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:44,433
It's all right, John.

219
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:46,435
She's had a bad dream.

220
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:51,372
Let's just get you back to sleep.

221
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,576
It was just a dream.

222
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,294
It wasn't a dream.

223
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:14,430
- There was someone on the roof.
- What?

224
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:18,401
I think maybe Kate Batts
sent one of her slaves to torment us.

225
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:19,936
- When I find him...
- John!

226
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:23,339
...I'll whip him
to within an inch of his life!

227
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,807
- My God.
- What?

228
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:26,475
John, look at this.

229
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,343
That sonofabitch!

230
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,446
John!

231
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:31,614
John!!

232
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:33,015
John... Wait.

233
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:36,786
John!

234
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:39,454
Stop. We don't know
who did this!

235
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:42,125
- I know who did this!
- You don't!

236
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:45,495
- Listen to me!
- Batts is not gonna hurt my daughter.

237
00:26:45,496 --> 00:26:47,696
Oh, go on, then! Be a fool!

238
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:39,849
What are the two foundations
of any civilized community?

239
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,852
- Church and...
- Church and education, that's what.

240
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:46,222
And this man pioneered them both
for our community,

241
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:48,858
with his money and with his hands.

242
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,361
He built the church
and the church condemns him.

243
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:53,495
Usury. I broke church law.

244
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:56,032
- But, Father...
- Moral turpitude.

245
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,833
Moral turpitude, pah!

246
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:00,403
He charged a rate of interest

247
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:03,439
that was just a little higher
than church canon.

248
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,877
But what the elder didn't realize
was who he was dealing with!

249
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:09,278
Shhh, James.

250
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,647
The boys are finally asleep.

251
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:14,115
Th-that's good. Bless their...

252
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:16,252
Now, a few chapters...

253
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,054
from the Bible

254
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:21,522
will take care
of this house's troubles.

255
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:23,125
Quietly, James.

256
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,563
"Hannah prayed and said,

257
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:31,299
"'My heart exalts in the Lord...

258
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:34,737
"My mouth is enlarged
over mine enemies... '

259
00:28:34,738 --> 00:28:38,338
"'Who am I?
An untamed spirit that spoke to him

260
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,242
"and Jesus answered,

261
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:42,612
"'Be silent

262
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:44,613
"and come out of there.'

263
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,283
"The spirit gave a loud cry

264
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:49,985
and departed."

265
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:52,321
Please...

266
00:28:52,423 --> 00:28:53,823
all join hands.

267
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:59,994
As one,
we shall speak this prayer

268
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:01,664
three times.

269
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:05,499
Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ,

270
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,436
be silent

271
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:09,804
and leave this house forever.

272
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:13,908
Demon,
in the name of Jesus Christ,

273
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:16,011
be silent

274
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:18,780
and leave this house forever.

275
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:20,883
Demon, in the name

276
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,085
of Jesus Christ,

277
00:29:23,454 --> 00:29:26,356
be silent
and leave this house forever.

278
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:29,090
Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ,

279
00:29:29,193 --> 00:29:32,260
be silent
and leave this house forever.

280
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,639
Almost 12:00

281
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,508
and all is well.

282
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,876
I believe your home is safe.

283
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:50,747
I'm sure Kate Batts
is at the root

284
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,215
- of these disturbances.
- Yeah.

285
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:00,523
A few nights ago,

286
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:01,991
I saw something.

287
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:03,425
A man, I think.

288
00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:06,160
Moving about the property.

289
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,264
Who was he?

290
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,767
Couldn't make out for sure.

291
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:13,936
Was probably the professor.
He's the only one who lives nearby.

292
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,339
You don't think Richard
has his eye on Betsy, do you?

293
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,340
He's her teacher,
for goodness sake.

294
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:22,512
Hallelujah, Lucy.

295
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,046
God has answered.

296
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,449
It's midnight
and your house is quiet.

297
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,319
Thank you, James.

298
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,053
- I beat him, Lucy.
- Oh, did you?

299
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:37,293
- Oh, good night, all.
- Good night, dear.

300
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,362
- Good night.
- Now, I wasn't looking, John.

301
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:42,231
I was talking to your wife.
That game don't count.

302
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:43,800
Don't you blame that on me!

303
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,868
I'll set for another one.

304
00:30:46,203 --> 00:30:47,970
Ain't gonna play
if you're gonna cheat.

305
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,305
I never cheat.

306
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,706
My move.

307
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:32,948
Dad! Daddy!

308
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:40,723
Open the door!

309
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:50,332
Betsy!

310
00:31:51,268 --> 00:31:52,668
Open the door!

311
00:31:58,108 --> 00:31:59,508
Help me!

312
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:02,143
Help me! Help!

313
00:32:04,114 --> 00:32:06,381
In the name of Jesus Christ,

314
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,551
cease this at once!

315
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:11,185
It's all right.

316
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:41,243
Demon, ghost, entity...

317
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:42,778
call it what you will,

318
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,214
- it is not natural.
- James, James,

319
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:48,618
listen to yourself.
You're not being realistic.

320
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:51,053
There must be a rational explanation.

321
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:52,421
Listen, Richard,

322
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:54,622
I have documented evidence.

323
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:57,860
It's the testimony
of Joan Jordan

324
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,395
at the witch trial

325
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:02,196
of Olive Barthram,
Suffolk Assizes,

326
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:03,832
of 1599.

327
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,300
First,

328
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,202
scraping on the walls.

329
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:08,738
Then, knocking.

330
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,439
After that, shuffling.

331
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,773
And then, it clapped the maid

332
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:14,910
on the cheek...

333
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:16,578
half-a-score times.

334
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,482
Do you not think

335
00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:21,884
it is far more likely

336
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:24,387
that Kate Batts,
unhappy with the ruling,

337
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:28,521
has sent her slaves to exact
a pound of flesh from you?

338
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,959
Well, that's what I thought,

339
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:33,794
but this was not the work of slaves.

340
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:36,931
Lord, no!
She was dangling there!

341
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Two feet off the ground!

342
00:34:41,738 --> 00:34:42,738
All right.

343
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,141
The incidents
always happen at night

344
00:34:45,142 --> 00:34:47,943
and always in Betsy's room.
Correct?

345
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:51,344
- That's right, Professor.
- So it was dark.

346
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,451
Well, it would've been quite easy
for you not to have seen

347
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:58,087
- someone holding her.
- She was suspended in midair

348
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:00,456
- by something not of this Earth!
- John!

349
00:35:00,457 --> 00:35:04,560
Now, the only logical explanation
is that someone was holding her.

350
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,961
There was nobody in that room.

351
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:09,465
And what about the door?

352
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:11,901
The strength of three of us
couldn't budge it.

353
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,302
Well...

354
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:17,637
the rain that night
could've cause the door to swell.

355
00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:19,041
It could've.

356
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,442
And the slaps?

357
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:22,977
How did we imagine them?

358
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:25,112
Now, that's a boy's trick.

359
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,851
Dried peas
blown through a hollow reed.

360
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:30,019
A pea shooter?

361
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,420
- Huh!
- No pea shooter

362
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,855
could smack her face

363
00:35:32,856 --> 00:35:34,090
that violently.

364
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,492
Did you actually see
someone slapping her?

365
00:35:36,493 --> 00:35:38,760
No, I saw her being slapped.

366
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:41,931
But you did not see
someone slapping her?

367
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,433
- No, that's the point.
- So it stands to reason

368
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:48,034
you may also not have seen
someone holding her.

369
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,206
Now, whatever happened,

370
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,945
it's very clear
that confusion was about that room.

371
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,813
Professor, we did not all imagine
the same thing.

372
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:02,818
There was something unholy
in that room.

373
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:04,519
John...

374
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,357
...when the school week is over,

375
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:11,825
I will come and spend the night
at your house

376
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:15,728
and I will prove to you
that this is nothing more

377
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:18,866
than someone
trying to frighten you.

378
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:41,689
All right, time's up, class.

379
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,092
Leave your slates
on my desk, please.

380
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:49,331
Betsy.

381
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,732
Hurry up.

382
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:53,569
We gotta get to the river
before it gets dark.

383
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,170
Not today, Joshua.

384
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:57,740
We've been planning this for weeks.

385
00:36:57,741 --> 00:36:59,874
I just don't feel like it.

386
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,577
- Come on, Betsy.
- I said no!

387
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:05,347
Leave me alone!

388
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:24,698
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

389
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:53,895
This will pass, Betsy.

390
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:29,731
Why?

391
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,567
Why?

392
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,079
Give that back!

393
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,530
Remember what?

394
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,261
No!

395
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,662
No.

396
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:17,966
No, no!

397
00:41:24,874 --> 00:41:26,274
No! Don't!

398
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:30,344
Lucy, what's happening?

399
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:34,516
What's happening?

400
00:41:34,517 --> 00:41:36,752
- Richard, you should not be watching.
- Somebody wake her!

401
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:38,153
- Oh!
- John!

402
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:57,171
Open your eyes, John.

403
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:01,543
He'll be all right in the head
come morning, Miss Bell.

404
00:42:01,544 --> 00:42:03,045
And the poultice?

405
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:06,246
He keep them roots
on his head a while.

406
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:09,818
Well...

407
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:15,221
Betsy appears to suffer
from violent nightmares.

408
00:42:16,192 --> 00:42:17,493
Did you see my sister?

409
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:19,228
- Of course.
- You think what my daughter...

410
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:20,596
- just went through...
- Bear with me...

411
00:42:20,597 --> 00:42:23,298
- for a minute here...
- The covers were pulled off her bed!

412
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:24,666
That was no nightmare.

413
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,870
Nightmares may appear
to be more than they are.

414
00:42:27,871 --> 00:42:28,971
People often imagine

415
00:42:28,972 --> 00:42:31,073
- they've seen...
- We didn't imagine any of this!

416
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:33,274
You were there, you saw it!

417
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:37,310
- It was not natural!
- There's something evil here.

418
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,183
This is blasphemy!

419
00:42:45,922 --> 00:42:47,322
Who's there?

420
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,924
Show yourself!

421
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:50,592
Betsy, is that you?

422
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,494
Destroy them, O Lord!

423
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:55,228
Let them fall by their own counsel!

424
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:56,998
Quiet, James!

425
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:59,533
Destroy them! Destroy them!

426
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:03,470
- Cast them out!
- Can you see anyone?

427
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,475
- A multitude of their...
- Who is that?

428
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:09,444
O Lord,
they have rebelled against thee!

429
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:12,178
- Cast them out!
- Stop that, James!

430
00:43:12,615 --> 00:43:14,882
The foolish shall not stand!

431
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:17,351
They shall not stand

432
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:18,987
in thy sight!

433
00:43:19,122 --> 00:43:21,322
Cast them out! Cast them...

434
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,230
Stop it!!

435
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:34,068
Damn you to hell!!

436
00:43:42,045 --> 00:43:45,681
Are you familiar
with that which Mr. Johnson reads?

437
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:48,383
Of course it understands
the words of the Lord.

438
00:43:48,384 --> 00:43:50,184
That's why it's gone.

439
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:03,962
Was the reading
from the Gospel According to Matthew?

440
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:06,934
Was that a yes...

441
00:44:07,403 --> 00:44:08,803
or a no?

442
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,338
Shhh!

443
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:14,174
The Gospel According to Mark?

444
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,380
Is it a Psalm of David?

445
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:29,557
Why are you here?

446
00:44:32,195 --> 00:44:34,528
Have the Bells disturbed you?

447
00:44:51,547 --> 00:44:55,080
Are we all having nightmares now,
Professor?

448
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:40,321
My mess. I'll clean it.

449
00:46:57,673 --> 00:46:59,674
Anky, could you answer
the door, please?

450
00:46:59,675 --> 00:47:01,075
Yes, ma'am.

451
00:47:05,348 --> 00:47:07,081
- Hi, Anky.
- Zach.

452
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,849
What you doing here?

453
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:10,952
Miss Batts told me

454
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:15,753
to bring this bag to the Bells.
She say she found it on her land.

455
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:18,359
- Bye, Anky.
- Bye, Zach.

456
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,565
Who was it, Anky?

457
00:47:23,566 --> 00:47:25,133
It was Zach, ma'am.

458
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,335
- Who works for Kate Batts?
- Yes ma'am.

459
00:47:27,336 --> 00:47:30,205
She give him this bag
to give to you.

460
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:32,707
I don't want anything of hers
brought into this house.

461
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:35,410
She say it belong
to the Bell family.

462
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:36,811
No, Mom.

463
00:47:53,729 --> 00:47:56,131
- This is Betsy's.
- Yes, Miss Lucy.

464
00:47:56,132 --> 00:47:58,200
And that be Mr. Bell's shirt.

465
00:47:58,201 --> 00:48:03,468
- They's been missing for over a year.
- Why would she have their clothes?

466
00:48:09,745 --> 00:48:11,313
What is it, Chloe?

467
00:48:11,314 --> 00:48:12,847
What do you know?

468
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,117
Tell me what you know.

469
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:20,689
You heard about Miss Kate
being a witch and all.

470
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,157
Well, Miss Lucy,

471
00:48:22,758 --> 00:48:25,760
when witches get a critter's
blood on folks' clothes,

472
00:48:25,761 --> 00:48:27,161
why, that mean

473
00:48:27,597 --> 00:48:29,264
the person gonna...

474
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,135
Gonna what, Chloe?

475
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,070
Gonna what?

476
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:37,538
Gonna...

477
00:48:38,274 --> 00:48:40,074
Gonna die, Miss Lucy!

478
00:48:40,743 --> 00:48:42,143
Gonna die!

479
00:48:44,013 --> 00:48:45,413
I'll burn it!!

480
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,215
No, Miss Lucy!!

481
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,083
That'll make it worse.

482
00:48:49,452 --> 00:48:51,919
They're gonna let the devil in!

483
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,934
Hey, come on, come on!

484
00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:08,769
Hey, give it back!

485
00:49:47,677 --> 00:49:49,077
Stop! Wait!

486
00:49:49,712 --> 00:49:51,112
Please, stop!

487
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,068
You're having a nightmare!

488
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:29,677
It's all right.

489
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:31,345
It's all right.

490
00:51:32,615 --> 00:51:34,015
It's all right.

491
00:51:39,622 --> 00:51:41,022
What happened?

492
00:51:42,124 --> 00:51:43,657
I don't remember.

493
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,493
I never remember.

494
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,964
- Should I wake your parents?
- No!

495
00:51:49,965 --> 00:51:52,965
Please.
Please just stay here with me.

496
00:51:54,303 --> 00:51:55,836
Of course, Betsy.

497
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:02,042
Let's get you covered up.

498
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:34,242
John!

499
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:38,113
- I'll kill her. I'll kill her!
- No, John.

500
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:40,482
When they hang you for her murder,
what happens to us?

501
00:52:40,483 --> 00:52:42,016
You won't be any worse off

502
00:52:42,017 --> 00:52:43,785
than you are already...

503
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,353
John, I want to have you,
John Bell!

504
00:52:45,354 --> 00:52:49,087
But sacrificing my life
could end this torment!

505
00:52:55,097 --> 00:52:57,232
We'll find another way, John.

506
00:52:57,233 --> 00:52:59,166
We'll find another way.

507
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:03,671
Theny?

508
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,940
Yes, Betsy?

509
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,241
Do you believe in the Lord?

510
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:09,911
Of course I do.

511
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:11,612
Don't you?

512
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:16,951
I used to.

513
00:53:17,286 --> 00:53:18,686
Oh, Betsy.

514
00:53:20,556 --> 00:53:21,956
I'm so afraid.

515
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:23,758
Don't be.

516
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:25,292
I'm here with ya.

517
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,929
Good night, Betsy.

518
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,565
Good night.

519
00:53:31,634 --> 00:53:33,034
Betsy...

520
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:36,337
Did you hear that?

521
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:45,513
Betsy...

522
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:46,914
Betsy...

523
00:54:13,008 --> 00:54:15,341
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...

524
00:54:16,979 --> 00:54:19,312
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...

525
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,084
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy!

526
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:34,561
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy!

527
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:37,298
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy!

528
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:38,699
Let me out!

529
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,301
Let me out!

530
00:54:41,136 --> 00:54:42,536
Let me out!

531
00:54:42,972 --> 00:54:46,439
- Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy!
- Let me out!

532
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:49,142
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy!

533
00:54:50,312 --> 00:54:51,712
Betsy...

534
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:07,428
How long has she been this way?

535
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,830
Uh, maybe 30 minutes,

536
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:11,031
No, more than that.

537
00:55:14,837 --> 00:55:16,237
Theny?

538
00:55:17,172 --> 00:55:18,873
Can you tell us what happened?

539
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:20,741
It's all right, Theny.

540
00:55:27,182 --> 00:55:29,083
She was having a nightmare.

541
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:30,484
She was...

542
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:32,453
fighting with someone.

543
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,854
She started...

544
00:55:34,056 --> 00:55:35,523
hitting herself.

545
00:55:36,058 --> 00:55:38,125
I woke her up and then...

546
00:55:40,362 --> 00:55:41,762
...then this...

547
00:55:42,364 --> 00:55:43,764
voice...

548
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:47,768
Betsy! Betsy, you're all right.

549
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,709
Shhh...

550
00:55:58,047 --> 00:55:59,447
Shhh...

551
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,520
Betsy! Betsy! Come on!

552
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:09,823
Come here, come here!
Shhh! Shhh!

553
00:56:09,892 --> 00:56:11,492
Shhh! Here, look at me.

554
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,227
Look at me, look at me!

555
00:56:13,228 --> 00:56:14,628
Shhh, shhh.

556
00:56:43,926 --> 00:56:45,126
Betsy...

557
00:56:45,127 --> 00:56:46,694
- Did you hear it?
- Shhh...

558
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,095
Bad

559
00:56:59,608 --> 00:57:01,008
John Jr...

560
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:03,177
Theny...

561
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:05,079
Lucy...

562
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:07,014
John Bell...

563
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:10,350
Tell me the truth...

564
00:57:11,286 --> 00:57:14,619
- What is it, Lord?
- Cease this at once!!!

565
00:57:20,462 --> 00:57:22,262
You're gonna die...

566
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,132
- Make him pay.
- No, no, no...

567
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,240
- Who are you?
- She'll sadden one

568
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:38,143
- who was once happy...
- Go to hell, Kate Batts!

569
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:47,121
- Precious! Oh!
- Oh!

570
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,163
No! Betsy, no!

571
00:57:56,565 --> 00:57:57,965
Betsy! No! No!

572
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:04,004
- Betsy!
- No!

573
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:05,739
Stop! No!

574
00:58:24,193 --> 00:58:25,593
It spoke.

575
00:58:26,028 --> 00:58:27,428
It had a voice.

576
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:30,998
But what did it want?

577
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:35,034
Why was it making Betsy suffer so?

578
00:58:35,204 --> 00:58:38,071
What did she do
to make it so angry?

579
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,607
The black wolf?

580
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,208
The young girl,

581
00:58:41,543 --> 00:58:43,410
visible only to Betsy;

582
00:58:43,879 --> 00:58:46,114
the spirit
which none of us could see.

583
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:50,715
How did they relate to each other?
Were they one and the same?

584
00:58:51,386 --> 00:58:53,254
The attacks on Betsy got worse.

585
00:58:53,255 --> 00:58:54,822
It spoke more and more.

586
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:57,090
I tried to get it to tell us

587
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:58,793
why it had come.

588
00:58:59,294 --> 00:59:02,263
My questions
were answered with silence.

589
00:59:02,264 --> 00:59:04,197
Why wouldn't it answer?

590
00:59:25,587 --> 00:59:26,987
In my life...

591
00:59:27,823 --> 00:59:30,423
I've done far more good than not.

592
00:59:32,494 --> 00:59:33,894
Even saints...

593
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:36,496
commit sins of some sort.

594
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,602
How can you allow...

595
00:59:43,338 --> 00:59:44,572
my family...

596
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:46,706
to be punished like this?!

597
00:59:47,676 --> 00:59:49,543
It's the way of Satan!

598
00:59:55,951 --> 00:59:58,151
I've offered you my life...

599
00:59:58,287 --> 00:59:59,687
in recompense.

600
01:00:02,124 --> 01:00:04,057
Why do you not take it?

601
01:00:05,794 --> 01:00:07,194
I beg you.

602
01:00:07,696 --> 01:00:09,163
I beg you, Lord.

603
01:00:10,299 --> 01:00:12,099
Rid us of this curse.

604
01:00:13,302 --> 01:00:14,702
Take my life.

605
01:00:29,651 --> 01:00:32,318
The Lord has forsaken me, Richard.

606
01:00:38,327 --> 01:00:40,527
That which attacks Betsy...

607
01:00:40,696 --> 01:00:42,429
attacks you as well.

608
01:00:51,673 --> 01:00:54,006
"Someone who was once happy."

609
01:00:55,711 --> 01:00:58,311
To whom do you think that refers?

610
01:00:59,848 --> 01:01:01,248
Kate Batts.

611
01:01:03,185 --> 01:01:05,252
Everything points to her.

612
01:01:05,354 --> 01:01:08,889
Well, look, if she is the cause,
than why not just return the profit

613
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,557
- and the timber to her?
- I tried.

614
01:01:12,194 --> 01:01:13,594
Two months ago.

615
01:01:14,696 --> 01:01:16,696
I sent Chloe to see her.

616
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:19,099
Money in hand.

617
01:01:22,037 --> 01:01:23,570
She sent it back.

618
01:01:25,707 --> 01:01:27,575
Then she does mean
to torment you.

619
01:01:27,576 --> 01:01:28,976
Until I die.

620
01:01:34,883 --> 01:01:36,283
This...

621
01:01:37,052 --> 01:01:38,452
entity...

622
01:01:39,221 --> 01:01:41,656
...do you believe
it can read your mind?

623
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:43,057
No, I do not.

624
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:45,893
No.

625
01:01:45,894 --> 01:01:48,027
But I do believe it can...

626
01:01:48,063 --> 01:01:49,730
hear our conversations.

627
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:51,899
That's how it knows
our every move.

628
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,167
But it is only present
on this property.

629
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:05,913
Yah! Yah!

630
01:02:06,948 --> 01:02:09,148
You know,
the fog is awfully thick.

631
01:02:09,217 --> 01:02:10,785
We made good time.

632
01:02:10,786 --> 01:02:13,519
We should be out of the woods soon.

633
01:03:15,016 --> 01:03:16,416
Whoa!

634
01:03:43,345 --> 01:03:44,745
Betsy!

635
01:03:46,014 --> 01:03:47,414
Betsy!

636
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,752
Betsy! Can you hear me?

637
01:04:32,394 --> 01:04:33,794
Whoa! Whoa!

638
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:36,363
Whoa!

639
01:04:40,101 --> 01:04:41,568
- Go!
- Come on!

640
01:05:11,933 --> 01:05:13,666
It's getting closer!

641
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:34,621
It's gone.

642
01:05:34,856 --> 01:05:36,256
Gone where?

643
01:06:06,154 --> 01:06:07,554
Mother?

644
01:06:08,156 --> 01:06:10,156
I'm right here, darling.

645
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:14,828
I had the most terrible nightmare.

646
01:06:16,164 --> 01:06:18,231
You were sending me away.

647
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,133
Oh, I would never send you away.

648
01:06:22,003 --> 01:06:23,103
Mother?

649
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,504
Yes, darling?

650
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:26,273
Am I gonna die?

651
01:06:27,842 --> 01:06:29,242
No.

652
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,077
You're not gonna die.

653
01:06:33,848 --> 01:06:35,515
Now, you just rest.

654
01:06:37,852 --> 01:06:39,252
Just rest.

655
01:06:43,758 --> 01:06:45,291
If this entity...

656
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:50,096
...can hear us at all times...

657
01:06:50,532 --> 01:06:52,665
...and is in all places...

658
01:06:56,204 --> 01:06:57,538
Then...

659
01:06:57,539 --> 01:06:59,472
there's no escaping it.

660
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,881
You care for her,
don't you, Richard?

661
01:07:07,882 --> 01:07:12,082
More than the normal concern
of a teacher for a student.

662
01:07:19,227 --> 01:07:20,894
Why would you say that?

663
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:23,028
I've seen you look at her.

664
01:07:28,103 --> 01:07:29,503
It is true,

665
01:07:30,238 --> 01:07:32,771
there is no one for a day's ride

666
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:35,641
as comely as your daughter, Lucy.

667
01:07:36,911 --> 01:07:38,412
I would not presume to...

668
01:07:38,413 --> 01:07:39,946
Maybe you should.

669
01:07:51,092 --> 01:07:53,093
I'm almost 20 years her senior.

670
01:07:53,094 --> 01:07:55,627
The same is true of John and me.

671
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:04,238
Can she love me?

672
01:08:07,776 --> 01:08:09,176
She will.

673
01:08:13,148 --> 01:08:16,216
I'm so afraid for her.
Richard, please, marry her.

674
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:19,284
Your faith in me
is flattering, Lucy.

675
01:08:21,289 --> 01:08:22,689
Please.

676
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:25,092
But I could not,

677
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,926
with good conscience,

678
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:30,062
marry Betsy
merely to be her protector.

679
01:08:33,702 --> 01:08:35,102
I'm sorry.

680
01:08:38,473 --> 01:08:39,873
I'm sorry.

681
01:08:48,316 --> 01:08:49,849
After that night,

682
01:08:50,652 --> 01:08:52,252
something changed.

683
01:08:52,987 --> 01:08:56,187
The attacks on Betsy
became less violent.

684
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,760
The entity now took out its rage
on John,

685
01:09:01,563 --> 01:09:03,931
while leaving Betsy
in an almost lifeless state.

686
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:05,332
John...

687
01:09:07,168 --> 01:09:08,568
John...

688
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:10,437
I'll kill you John...

689
01:09:12,173 --> 01:09:13,373
John...

690
01:09:13,374 --> 01:09:15,041
John... Help her...

691
01:09:16,511 --> 01:09:18,044
Help her, John...

692
01:09:19,514 --> 01:09:21,749
- She's so young... John...
- No!...no!

693
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,051
- No!
- Help her... She's so young...

694
01:09:24,052 --> 01:09:25,886
- Help her...
- Precious.

695
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,620
- Help her...
- Oh!

696
01:09:33,061 --> 01:09:34,861
You're gonna die...

697
01:09:45,373 --> 01:09:47,973
You're gonna die, John...
Yes...

698
01:09:51,579 --> 01:09:52,979
Precious...

699
01:09:54,082 --> 01:09:56,016
- Your precious...
- Precious...

700
01:09:56,017 --> 01:09:57,417
Once sad...

701
01:09:58,553 --> 01:10:01,955
The entity
wouldn't let anyone try to help Betsy

702
01:10:01,956 --> 01:10:04,423
when she was under its control.

703
01:10:06,127 --> 01:10:07,660
I felt powerless.

704
01:10:10,965 --> 01:10:12,765
John wouldn't listen.

705
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:14,301
He fought it.

706
01:10:14,402 --> 01:10:17,335
And in return,
he was made to suffer.

707
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,259
You know...

708
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:41,261
the truth...

709
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:46,433
See?

710
01:10:58,847 --> 01:11:00,247
Open the door!

711
01:11:00,849 --> 01:11:02,249
Betsy!

712
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:10,690
Betsy.

713
01:11:44,826 --> 01:11:46,226
Momma...

714
01:11:46,828 --> 01:11:48,228
Help me.

715
01:11:54,702 --> 01:11:56,102
Betsy?

716
01:13:23,424 --> 01:13:24,824
Kate Batts!

717
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,733
Call back your Furies.

718
01:13:35,837 --> 01:13:37,304
Spare my family.

719
01:13:39,774 --> 01:13:41,174
Take it.

720
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:50,849
Exact your pound of flesh.

721
01:13:55,957 --> 01:13:57,357
I beg you.

722
01:13:59,027 --> 01:14:00,427
End your curse.

723
01:14:01,496 --> 01:14:02,896
Please.

724
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,069
I put no curse on you,

725
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:10,470
or your family.

726
01:14:11,539 --> 01:14:13,272
You cursed yourself,

727
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:15,241
John Bell.

728
01:15:56,577 --> 01:15:57,977
Betsy...

729
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,480
Betsy...

730
01:16:00,815 --> 01:16:02,215
Help me...

731
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:05,952
Betsy...

732
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:07,353
Help me...

733
01:16:08,422 --> 01:16:09,822
Remember...

734
01:17:32,506 --> 01:17:33,906
Precious.

735
01:17:42,683 --> 01:17:44,083
Momma!

736
01:19:32,293 --> 01:19:34,960
My mom always was a heavy sleeper.

737
01:19:42,803 --> 01:19:44,870
I was born from the union

738
01:19:46,107 --> 01:19:47,807
of evil and innocence.

739
01:19:47,808 --> 01:19:49,608
Part of her soul died

740
01:19:50,044 --> 01:19:52,711
the night John took her innocence.

741
01:20:01,655 --> 01:20:03,055
Avenge me.

742
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:09,793
Make him pay
for what he has done to us.

743
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,308
- Take it.
- Thank you.

744
01:21:57,271 --> 01:21:59,038
Well, you sleep so sound,

745
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:02,039
you don't even feel me
get out of bed.

746
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:05,811
This is Betsy's?

747
01:22:08,849 --> 01:22:10,249
My mess.

748
01:22:10,284 --> 01:22:11,684
I'll clean it.

749
01:23:14,848 --> 01:23:16,381
After that night,

750
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:19,252
Betsy never heard
from the entity again.

751
01:23:19,253 --> 01:23:20,653
Mom?

752
01:23:22,189 --> 01:23:23,656
Mom! Dad's here.

753
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,524
I'm leaving.

754
01:23:26,527 --> 01:23:27,927
Okay.

755
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:43,442
I love you.

756
01:23:43,577 --> 01:23:45,844
I love you too.
Bye, Mom.

757
01:23:55,556 --> 01:23:56,956
Help her!

758
01:24:09,737 --> 01:24:11,137
David?

759
01:24:12,072 --> 01:24:13,472
David?

760
01:24:13,741 --> 01:24:15,141
David!
