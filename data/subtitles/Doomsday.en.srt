1
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:39,232
<i>Like so many epidemics before,</i>

2
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:44,033
<i>the loss of so many lives began
with a single microscopic organism.</i>

3
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:57,033
<i>It's human nature to seek even
the smallest comfort in reason</i>

4
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:00,932
<i>or logic for events
as catastrophic as these.</i>

5
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:04,332
<i>But a virus doesn't
choose a time or place.</i>

6
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,332
<i>It doesn't hate or even care.</i>

7
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,033
<i>It just happens.</i>

8
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,932
<i>Go back to your homes!</i>

9
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:37,932
<i>The Reaper virus spread among
the population of Glasgow</i>

10
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,832
<i>like a common cold.</i>

11
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,432
<i>There was no stopping it.</i>

12
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:45,031
<i>- No cure.
- No vaccine.</i>

13
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:52,632
<i>It claimed the lives of thousands in the
first week. This is the end of the world!</i>

14
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:57,432
<i>In an attempt to quell the outbreak,
martial law was implemented.</i>

15
00:01:57,432 --> 00:02:01,531
<i>Roadblocks set up. Come on, darling.
Curfews enforced. We have to walk now.</i>

16
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,031
<i>The airports, seaports
and borders were closed.</i>

17
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:08,231
<i>Scotland was placed
under quarantine.</i>

18
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:13,632
<i>The people were ordered to stay in their
homes, to avoid travel, avoid contact,</i>

19
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:18,132
<i>to sit it out and wait
for help that did not come.</i>

20
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:34,430
Stay back!

21
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,631
You got to let us through!

22
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:45,631
Get out of the way! Move! Move!
Get out of the way! Walk on, will you?

23
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:54,230
Hey, you! You! I am talking at you!
Get down on the floor now! Everybody, down!

24
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,831
Don't shoot!

25
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:04,531
<i>You fucker!</i>

26
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,629
Fall back! Fall back!

27
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,229
Get out of the way!

28
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,729
Please let us go!

29
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,829
Onward!

30
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,829
Are you all right?

31
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,530
You bastard!

32
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,129
Look at me, darling.
Look at...

33
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,829
Go! Go! Go!

34
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:17,928
Hold the line!

35
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:25,629
Gas!

36
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:02,528
- Easy, girl.
- Come here.

37
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:08,728
Help me!

38
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:22,127
Please! Take us with you!
Get back!

39
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,627
We're too heavy!
We have to get off now!

40
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:26,627
Step away from the helicopter!
Give her a chance!

41
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:30,326
No, wait!
What are you doing?

42
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:33,726
Get back in the helicopter! Now!
Take the girl!

43
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,927
We have to go now!

44
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:40,726
Hold tight, sweetheart!
Everything's going to be okay! Come on!

45
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,726
Stay back!

46
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,026
Take this!

47
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,726
So she will know!

48
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:55,026
Hold on tight, sweetheart!

49
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:58,627
Eden!

50
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:17,225
<i>The wall stood 30 feet high,
clad in steel armor plating.</i>

51
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:21,326
<i>It followed the line of the ancient
Roman frontier, 2,000 years before,</i>

52
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:26,125
<i>spanning 18 miles, east coast
to west, cutting Britain in half.</i>

53
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:32,526
<i>Coastal waters were mined and patrolled.
The skies were declared a no-fly zone,</i>

54
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:37,526
<i>and orders were given to shoot down any
aircraft in violation of the quarantine.</i>

55
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:43,326
<i>The idea was simple.
Nobody came out, and nobody went in.</i>

56
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:47,925
<i>They needn't have worried
about the second part.</i>

57
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:59,425
<i>Those abandoned within the
quarantine zone were left to die.</i>

58
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,225
<i>Social order decayed
along with the corpses.</i>

59
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:07,324
<i>The streets ran with blood as
the people fought to stay alive.</i>

60
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:13,125
<i>The bodies burned in their thousands.
Looting, rape and murder became rife.</i>

61
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,024
<i>Fire spread as the cities were
plundered, and the last to die</i>

62
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:21,524
<i>became primal savages,
feeding on dogs, rats</i>

63
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,524
<i>and finally, on each other.</i>

64
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:32,524
<i>As the weeks turned to months,
the funeral pyres faded and died.</i>

65
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:35,824
<i>In time, all the lights burned out,</i>

66
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:42,824
<i>consigning the country north of the wall
first to memory and eventually to history.</i>

67
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:48,524
<i>But just as the government had
turned its back on the hot zone,</i>

68
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:52,124
<i>so the rest of the world
turned its back on Britain.</i>

69
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:55,923
<i>With hundreds of thousands
unemployed, homeless and destitute,</i>

70
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:59,024
<i>the situation has reached breaking point.</i>

71
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:01,723
<i>It now remains only a matter of time</i>

72
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:05,324
<i>before the laws of nature
seek to redress the balance.</i>

73
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,423
<i>- Targets are in play.
- Start recording.</i>

74
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:51,623
Sinclair, Richter is the biggest slave trader
in the city. I want him alive. Your call.

75
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:19,322
Me and my boat, marooned on
this fucking island 25 years.

76
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:23,322
It's a full-time job,
trying to prevent it falling apart.

77
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:25,822
Come. Mind your head.

78
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:32,621
Best I could find.
Straight from the ghetto. Cheap. Clean.

79
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:45,821
Happy?

80
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,721
<i>Very.</i>

81
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:52,421
Shh.

82
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,020
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

83
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,520
You prick!

84
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,120
Get the case.

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,620
Drop the gun!

86
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,419
Fucking nancy-boy!
Where's your partner? Tell me!

87
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,419
I am getting off this boat alive.
You go to hell.

88
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:46,720
Get back! Don't you come any closer, or I will
blow his fucking brains all over this boat!

89
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,519
Sinclair, whatever you do, don't shoot.
What the hell are you doing? Sinclair!

90
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,419
She's fucking nuts!
Tell her to back off!

91
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,419
I am ordering you not to shoot, Sinclair!
Richter, you have got one way out of this!

92
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:01,720
Put the gun down, or she will kill you!
You haven't got a chance!

93
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,519
I will kill him, I swear!
Sinclair, do not shoot! Do not....

94
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:10,918
Shit.

95
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:52,717
I will never get used to that.

96
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:57,317
I don't suppose you got a cigarette?

97
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:01,918
When are you going to buy your own?
Do you know how much these things cost?

98
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:04,317
Why do you think I smoke yours?

99
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,618
Michaelson was a good man.

100
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:09,618
Not the greatest
copper on the beat, but....

101
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:14,918
...a good man.

102
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,217
What happened in there?

103
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:22,618
See for yourself.

104
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,618
Whatever happened to a good cause?

105
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,517
Can't remember what she looked like.

106
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:42,116
All I have is a name on an envelope and
an address of a place I can never go to.

107
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:47,017
I have watched you fight your way
through the ranks, tooth and nail.

108
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,716
And it's made you so
full of piss and vinegar.

109
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:51,216
You carry on the way you're going,

110
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:54,917
you're going to wind up one
seriously fucked-up individual.

111
00:12:54,917 --> 00:13:01,116
Now, do me a favor.
Please, go home. Get some rest.

112
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,615
Okay, let's do it!

113
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:00,014
Get back!

114
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:02,615
Get back!

115
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:12,815
- Thank you, Captain, that will be all. Sir.
- Canaris. Prime Minister. How long? 2 hours ago.

116
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:18,815
Well? DDS were carrying out a routine drugs
raid when they found the infected victims.

117
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:25,215
- It's the Reaper virus.
- Oh, my God. It's back.

118
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:35,514
Bloody Hell, George.
What's got your knickers in a twist?

119
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:39,414
National emergency, I am afraid.
Briefing for the PM in 5 minutes.

120
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:42,115
Let's keep this informal and to the point.

121
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,813
We all know what's at stake,
why you're here.

122
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:46,514
Jane.

123
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:50,213
In 2023, when the rising tidal waters
were threatening to flood London,

124
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,614
we extended the Thames flood barrier.

125
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:54,813
Like a castle moat, this system of canals

126
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,614
encircles the entire capital
north of the river.

127
00:14:57,614 --> 00:15:00,514
Our immediate plan is to flood the canals

128
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:04,913
blockade all bridges, tube lines
and rail links, in and out of the city.

129
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:07,214
You want to put 12 million
people under lock and key?

130
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:11,313
Containment is our absolute priority.
We must implement martial law now.

131
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:12,653
Keep the people off the streets

132
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:15,214
while we secure the blockade
and set up medical stations.

133
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,913
- Only then can we begin the evacuation.
- Do it.

134
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:22,514
It's all very well packing people into
their homes like so many million sardines,

135
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:25,114
but you drop a killer virus into that mix

136
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:28,113
and this town is going to go
tits-up in no short order.

137
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:31,812
Once you start stacking bodies
in the streets, there will be panic,

138
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:36,812
public disorder, looting, rape, murder,
and that's just for starters.

139
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,212
The death toll will be unimaginable

140
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:43,712
and by that time, there will be absolutely
fuck-all we can do about it.

141
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:47,413
You have to think of the
millions that we will be saving.

142
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,113
Are you talking about people?
Or pound notes?

143
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:55,712
Chief Nelson, would you join me in my office?

144
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:01,812
If this is a bollocking, make it quick.

145
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:04,312
I have got a job to do, I need
to be out there on the streets.

146
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:05,513
Michael.

147
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:07,913
What we're about to show you
is highly confidential

148
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,312
and potentially volatile material.

149
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:11,611
When the wall went up....

150
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:15,611
The government at that time, naturally, wanted
to know what was happening on the other side.

151
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:18,111
So they re-tasked one of
their military satellites

152
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,412
to provide coverage of
Edinburgh and Glasgow.

153
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:24,312
For the past 30 years,
it's carried on taking pictures,

154
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:29,412
sending down what you'd expect.
Empty cities, deserted streets.

155
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:33,312
That is, until 3 years ago,
when these turned up.

156
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:41,912
People.

157
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:43,511
On the streets of Glasgow.

158
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:46,111
- Survivors?
- What else could it be?

159
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:50,111
And if there are survivors,
there must surely be a cure.

160
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:54,711
What we have to do is get our hands on it.
We already have a team standing by.

161
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,510
All we need is somebody to lead them.

162
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,010
Someone to take them in, find the cure

163
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:04,009
and deliver it into our hands before
it's too late to turn the tide.

164
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:06,611
You don't know how many survivors there are.

165
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:10,010
And the team might not find them in time.
They might not find them at all.

166
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,711
And they could still be contagious.
That's what the team's going to find out.

167
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:20,010
You have known for 3 fucking years that they
were up there, but you swept it under the carpet.

168
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,010
Scotland's dead have long
since been laid to rest.

169
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,010
Yesterday, if I turned up on the
6:00 news with a survivor in tow,

170
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,010
they'd have strung me up from
the nearest lamp-post by the balls.

171
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,711
But if, in 48 hours, I arrive
with a survivor and a cure,

172
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:36,111
sure they won't give a flying
fuck about the survivor,

173
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:39,109
but they will be lining up to
kiss my arse for that cure.

174
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:42,609
In politics, survival is timing,
and ours is running out.

175
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,309
We have 48 hours.

176
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,109
I need your best man on this, right away.

177
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,309
All right.

178
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,809
I know someone who might just fit the bill.

179
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:18,809
Get in the car, it's pissing down.

180
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,308
- How long have they known?
- Long enough.

181
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:34,409
- But that doesn't matter now.
- Matters to me.

182
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,509
There are survivors out there.

183
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:39,409
This is not some personal
quest I am sending you on.

184
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,108
- Focus on your mission.
- Who's behind it? Hatcher?

185
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:48,009
Hatcher's got the swagger and the smiles,
but it's Canaris who pulls the strings.

186
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:52,808
He's the power behind the throne. And he is
not someone you want to pick a fight with.

187
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,709
- Who, me?
- I am serious.

188
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:59,709
If the truth got out,
it would bring Hatcher, the government,

189
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,209
the whole fucking system down.

190
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:06,008
And there's no way Canaris
is ever going to let that happen.

191
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:09,407
Once you're over that wall,
there's no rules

192
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:12,008
- No back-up.
- Better that way.

193
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:35,508
Look after this for me, would you?

194
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,707
Don't suppose you got a cigarette?

195
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:53,007
There's no smoking on the helicopter,
and I don't smoke. Fair enough.

196
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:55,106
Dr. Marcus Kane,

197
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,606
he was leading the research into the
virus when the gates were closed.

198
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:00,707
He was trapped inside the hot zone.

199
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:04,807
His lab was located inside the
quarantine compound in Glasgow.

200
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:08,906
If anybody was capable of
developing a cure, it was him.

201
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:12,807
I suggest you start at the lab.
Pick up the trail from there.

202
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:17,707
You will rendezvous with the
rest of the team at the wall,

203
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,507
then you will proceed north
in 2 armored transports.

204
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:24,207
Why not fly in?
Scotland is still a no-fly zone.

205
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:27,807
Hatcher needs to keep this
as low profile as possible.

206
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:31,806
So if we don't make it out,
no one will know we went in.

207
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:34,205
You have got 46 hours.

208
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:41,306
If you don't make it back, the city of London
and everybody in it will be left to die.

209
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:46,006
If it's there, I will find it.

210
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:51,306
You will need this. It's a GPS locator beacon.
It will tell us exactly where you are.

211
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:55,806
We will have a gun ship standing
by to extract your team.

212
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,806
So much for low profile.

213
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:03,605
Once you have the cure, it won't matter.

214
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:11,806
What happens if I don't find anything up there?
Then you needn't bother coming back.

215
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:34,105
<i>For your own safety, return to your homes.
East London is under martial law.</i>

216
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,005
What the hell are we going to do, Canaris?

217
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:52,805
Just calm down and listen.

218
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:54,305
Even if, by some miracle,

219
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:57,503
Sinclair finds what she's looking
for and makes it back in time,

220
00:21:57,503 --> 00:22:00,804
the fact remains, this is
our fault, we made it happen.

221
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:04,403
Too many people crammed into ghettos
so tight they can barely move.

222
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:08,203
We created the perfect breeding
ground for a virus to take place.

223
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,604
And the more we save now,

224
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:14,003
the more chance there is of the
same thing happening all over again.

225
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:19,002
Now, we have an opportunity
to buy ourselves breathing room.

226
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:23,903
- What exactly are you suggesting?
- We're at war, Prime Minister.

227
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:26,804
It's basic combat triage.

228
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:29,903
Leave the dying to die.

229
00:22:30,203 --> 00:22:31,903
With the whole world watching?

230
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:37,403
With a lie this big, we can get
away with anything we want.

231
00:22:57,802 --> 00:23:03,303
- Major Sinclair! Good flight? Fine.
- Sergeant Norton. Welcome to no-man's land.

232
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:08,202
Why call it that? There's not another living
soul for miles south of that wall, except us.

233
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:09,403
What about the sentries?

234
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:12,502
No, the whole system was fully
automated about 20 years ago.

235
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:16,403
Nowadays they only expend
their ammo on the local wildlife.

236
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:24,602
A team arrived 2 hours ago.
They're prepping their gear inside.

237
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:27,902
Ask them to get suited up, Sergeant.
We're against the clock on this one.

238
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:29,201
Yes, sir!

239
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,801
- Has the team been briefed?
- I have given them their assignments,

240
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:36,102
objectives and the file on Dr. Kane.

241
00:23:36,102 --> 00:23:41,501
Major Sinclair. Chandler.
Armor division. I will be your driver today.

242
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:46,301
Yeah, they may be ugly, but
they move like shit off a shovel.

243
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,701
Twin V12 engines, 2-inch armor plate,

244
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:52,102
and they will take anything from
30mm rounds to chemical weapons.

245
00:23:52,102 --> 00:23:54,801
Just the ticket for a night on the town.
Where'd they find these things?

246
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,801
They patrolled the hot
zone, just north of the wall.

247
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:59,801
When the system was automated,
most of them were sold off for scrap.

248
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:01,201
These are the last 2 in service.

249
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:05,801
Major, meet Corporal Read. Tank driver.
Major. Carry on, Corporal.

250
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:10,500
- Riflemen. Miller, Carpenter.
- Major. Major. What have we got here?

251
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Bio suits. Combat model.
High impact flexi-polymer.

252
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,800
Gives us total freedom of
movement and 24-hour protection.

253
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Just what a girl needs.

254
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:22,901
Prototype, silicon foam grenade.

255
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:26,300
- This is frontline equipment.
- A going-away present from Canaris.

256
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,201
Are we expecting trouble?

257
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:34,201
- Is there a problem?
- No. No problem at all, Major.

258
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,500
Good.

259
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,500
This is our cargo,
Doctors Talbot and Stirling.

260
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,099
You were part of the task
force set up to study the virus?

261
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,700
That's right.
How do you do, Major?

262
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,799
I took over in '24.
Stirling joined me in '31.

263
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,000
Until Hatcher, in his infinite wisdom,

264
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,900
decided to pull the plug on the
whole program 3 years ago.

265
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,400
Tried everything, of course.
Just couldn't crack it.

266
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,299
I do hope this trip of yours
is worth the risk, Major.

267
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,700
Apparently, someone thinks so.

268
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,000
All right, listen up!

269
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,200
I want everyone suited,
booted and strapped. Back here in 10.

270
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,699
Open the gate!

271
00:26:27,597 --> 00:26:31,998
<i>Sentry guns deactivated.
All right, Chandler. Take us in.</i>

272
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:53,296
- Shit! Chandler, what was that?
- Chandler, why have you stopped?

273
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:57,296
<i>- I think we hit something. Major. Say again?
- I think you'd better have a look at this.</i>

274
00:27:58,096 --> 00:28:03,096
All right, Miller. Suit up and check it out.
Chandler, send up a flare.

275
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:23,395
<i>Hey, Chandler, what's black
and white and spread all over?</i>

276
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:27,796
<i>I can't see any damage to the APC,
but your cow is a complete write-off.</i>

277
00:28:27,796 --> 00:28:30,194
- Moo.
- All right, get back inside.

278
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:46,994
You know that Dr. Kane was
the best man in his field.

279
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:51,595
His papers on virus research were required
reading when I was in medical school.

280
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:55,394
Basically, he taught me everything I know
but I never actually met the man.

281
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:58,595
This file's been closed for 25 years.

282
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:02,434
The government tried to suppress any
information getting out of the hot zone.

283
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:07,095
Didn't want people to know how
bad things had got up there.

284
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:11,394
<i>I don't think we can stay here much longer.</i>

285
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:17,594
Morality has abandoned these people. The killing...
Seems he dug in with a bunch of stranded soldiers,

286
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:19,493
fortified the hospital as best they could,

287
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:23,693
kept up regular reports on the
army frequency using their coms set

288
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:25,693
till the power went out permanently.

289
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:29,193
<i>The fires have spread,
the power supply is dwindling,</i>

290
00:29:29,193 --> 00:29:32,693
<i>and our food and water
are running out fast.</i>

291
00:29:33,294 --> 00:29:37,993
<i>At night we can hear
the distant cries of pain and anguish.</i>

292
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:43,693
<i>They have begun to feed off each other.
It's medieval out there.</i>

293
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:46,294
<i>Ammunition is low.</i>

294
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:50,193
<i>The barricades won't hold out much longer.</i>

295
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,794
<i>Our time has run out.</i>

296
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:56,992
<i>This is Dr. Marcus Kane signing off.</i>

297
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:05,393
What do the numbers mean?

298
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:08,093
It's the number of people in
each house that needed saving.

299
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:11,792
They were told to stay in their homes,
that help would come.

300
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:21,791
<i>Clear.</i>

301
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,790
Stirling, what do you know about line of fire?
I am a lab hound, not a combat surgeon.

302
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,891
That's all we need.

303
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:40,191
Line of fire is the air between
the target and the weapon

304
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:42,691
through which the bullet
travels very fast.

305
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:44,790
It's also the last place you
want to be in a fire fight.

306
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,590
If anything happens, you get behind me quick.
Understood?

307
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,590
You wouldn't want me to blow your
brains out is what I understood.

308
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:21,990
Stand back.

309
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:56,489
All right, check your corners.

310
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:32,188
We're clear.

311
00:33:57,887 --> 00:34:01,288
<i>Read, Fresno, we're on the
fifth floor, we're going in.</i>

312
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:04,087
Copy that, everything quiet here.

313
00:34:06,887 --> 00:34:09,188
I think the TV's buggered.

314
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,987
- Talbot, Stirling.
- You're up.

315
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:42,887
How the hell are we supposed
to find anything in this mess?

316
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:47,387
Just keep looking. It would help
if we knew what we were looking for.

317
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:49,987
Some evidence of Kane's work.

318
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,387
I will know when I see it.

319
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:54,987
Thanks.
That helps a bunch.

320
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:56,686
Shut it, Carpenter.

321
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:29,786
Major! Major!
We got a live one!

322
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:32,786
<i>Chandler, did not copy! Say again!
There's a fucking girl here!</i>

323
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:35,885
Outside on the street!
Whatever you do, do not touch her!

324
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:37,885
Chandler, keep her in sight,
but do not approach her.

325
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:42,186
Repeat, do not approach her.
Chandler! What are you doing?

326
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:46,784
You heard Sinclair! Get back inside! Now!
She needs help, Read, look at her! Chandler, no!

327
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:50,184
Fresno, get your short,
hairy ass back in the vehicle. Fuck.

328
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:55,284
Hey, hey. It's okay.
It's going to be okay. Whoa!

329
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:58,585
- Chandler! Do you copy?
- Yeah, she's alive, Major, but only just.

330
00:35:58,585 --> 00:36:02,005
Major, she must be isolated so we can examine her.
All right, let's get her inside.

331
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:06,985
- Major, this lab looks untouched.
- Take a look. We're right behind you.

332
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:14,085
- Talbot, get down now!
- Christ!

333
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:23,284
Shit!

334
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:46,994
- Read, emergency Evac! Now!
- Copy that!

335
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:56,384
I have reached Stirling. I need my torch!
I need my torch! Major! Checking the back door!

336
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,784
Shit!
Chandler get back in the fucking APC now!

337
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:10,882
Okay, I am moving!

338
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,182
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

339
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:31,282
We're rolling!

340
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:55,481
We're not getting out that way!

341
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:03,282
Jesus Christ!
Burn, you fuckers!

342
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,382
<i>Fuck....</i>

343
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:13,181
- Chandler, you're on fire!
- Don't I fucking know it!

344
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:17,581
Major, we are under attack!
I repeat, we are under attack!

345
00:38:45,081 --> 00:38:46,280
Bastards!

346
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,579
APC 1 is down!

347
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,079
Shit!

348
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,480
Repeat, APC 1 is down!
We have lost Chandler!

349
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,679
- Fuck!
- Get to the elevator, sub level 1.

350
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,639
- Get in there.
- It won't work, there's no power!

351
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,780
Get the fuck in! Move! Move!
Sergeant! Cover fire! Copy!

352
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,478
Miller, foam grenade.
Whatever this plan is... make it snappy! Shotgun!

353
00:40:03,478 --> 00:40:07,878
Major, what are we doing in here?
Going down! Pull it now!

354
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:37,579
Major, you are completely insane!

355
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,278
- Fuck!
- Check your corners! Check your corners!

356
00:40:49,677 --> 00:40:53,077
Move! Move! Move!
Miller, get that fucking hatch open!

357
00:40:59,378 --> 00:41:00,677
Oh, shit!

358
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:05,077
Get in!
We have got to go now!

359
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:19,478
Move it, Read!
Go! Go! Go!

360
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,646
Is anybody injured? Is everybody okay?
I am okay. I am fine.

361
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,876
What the fuck happened back there?

362
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:41,376
Read's got multiple impact warnings.

363
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:48,177
- Read!
- Stop, stop the car!

364
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:50,277
- Read!
- Look out!

365
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:12,376
- Stirling, you still with us? I am okay.
- I am okay. Well, I think I am not!

366
00:42:14,005 --> 00:42:15,675
What about Read?
She's dead!

367
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:19,996
- Fuck this shit, man! Fuck it!
- All right, grab what you can and bail out!

368
00:43:04,074 --> 00:43:07,175
- Miller, cover Norton!
- Covering fire!

369
00:43:07,574 --> 00:43:10,875
- Wait, wait, wait, tourniquet.
- I am doing it! I am doing it!

370
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:13,275
- Norton, alleyway!
- Copy!

371
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:19,974
- Stirling, go with him! He needs my help!
- Get over here! Go! Move it!

372
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:24,474
- Miller! Get behind me!
- Get Talbot! Fuck! Major, go!

373
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,175
Major, fucking go!

374
00:43:35,275 --> 00:43:37,275
Come on, then, you fuckers!

375
00:43:44,173 --> 00:43:45,574
<i>Fuck....</i>

376
00:43:47,273 --> 00:43:48,574
I am out!

377
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:54,873
- Get your hands off me!
- Talbot! We can't leave him.

378
00:43:54,873 --> 00:43:58,273
Go! Go! Go!
Move it!

379
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:00,974
Savages!

380
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:28,273
<i>This one's for Sol.</i>

381
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:11,972
Shit, man.

382
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:18,871
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

383
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:21,271
I got a bit carried away.

384
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:23,871
But if you keep going on like this...

385
00:45:29,472 --> 00:45:32,472
- See?
- There I go again.

386
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:36,871
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

387
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:40,371
But you are making me so fucking mad!

388
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,771
Just talk to me.

389
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:50,871
Who are you? What the fuck is the matter
with you, eh? Enjoy pain, is that it, eh?

390
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:54,471
Because you are fucking asking for it!

391
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:15,570
Norton to Sinclair,
Norton to Sinclair, do you copy? Over.

392
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,670
Norton to Sinclair,
Norton to Sinclair, come in.

393
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,371
Sooner or later, you're going to have to
consider the possibility that they're dead.

394
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:26,271
I am sorry. I am sorry to be blunt, but...

395
00:46:26,271 --> 00:46:29,170
We still have a job to do,
with or without Major Sinclair.

396
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,871
Yeah, and right now, my job is you.

397
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:37,469
If anything happens to you now,
Dr. Stirling, we're fucked.

398
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:58,000
Let's try again, eh. Who are you?
And where have you come from?

399
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,670
Now, I know that Kane
didn't send you, so who did?

400
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:05,570
Where'd you get all the fancy gear from, eh?
The tanks. The guns.

401
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:08,670
Talk to me!

402
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,269
Did you say Kane?

403
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:15,769
You need me to speak a little louder?
Is that it?

404
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,369
Well, how's this?

405
00:47:22,068 --> 00:47:23,369
Fuck you!

406
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:32,768
We came over the wall.

407
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:42,869
I fucking knew it. I fucking knew it!
I knew he was fucking lying! Who was lying? Kane!

408
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:48,168
You see, the bastard told us
there was nothing out there.

409
00:47:48,668 --> 00:47:52,268
No hope of salvation.
But I knew.

410
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:56,469
I knew that one day someone
would come and prove him wrong.

411
00:47:57,009 --> 00:48:01,467
If Kane's alive, I need to find him.

412
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:07,467
Shh. Save your breath.
You're with us now.

413
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,568
And you're alive only
as long as we need you!

414
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:17,367
Well, you see, if you did come over that wall,
then you must have planned on getting back.

415
00:48:18,168 --> 00:48:21,068
We have tried before and failed.

416
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:24,007
I have seen too many of my
friends rush those gates,

417
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:30,768
but before they could even get close,
they were turned to fire... and fell as ash.

418
00:48:32,068 --> 00:48:38,867
But with you here to lead us through,
we are going to go all the way.

419
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:43,467
Oh, lady, I could eat you right up.

420
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:54,367
You should forget
about that bastard Kane!

421
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:56,266
He's history.

422
00:48:56,266 --> 00:49:02,166
But you, you are our
passport to the promised land.

423
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:06,867
I think you're going to
be sorely disappointed.

424
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:08,666
I will be the judge of that.

425
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:13,766
Can you hear that?

426
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:17,067
The hounds are hungry!

427
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:21,467
It's feeding time at the fucking zoo!

428
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:33,565
We need this one alive.
Make sure she stays that way.

429
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,666
Nice watch.

430
00:50:10,864 --> 00:50:13,664
Sol. I heard what you said.
I need to speak with you!

431
00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:20,864
- You will get your turn! Sol!
- The wind of change is blowing a hurricane!

432
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:22,965
<i>Give them hell!</i>

433
00:50:24,364 --> 00:50:26,864
- No, no!
- No, no! No, no!

434
00:51:00,364 --> 00:51:04,664
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!
Here he is, the head chef,</i>

435
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:08,463
<i>the big cheese,
the sunshine of your lives!</i>

436
00:51:08,463 --> 00:51:10,664
<i>It's Sol....</i>

437
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:46,262
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

438
00:52:50,362 --> 00:52:54,362
<i>I have a rare treat in store for you!</i>

439
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:03,461
<i>Medium fucking rare!</i>

440
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,161
<i>Kane thought he could tell us what to do,</i>

441
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:13,661
<i>and we told Kane,</i>

442
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:17,760
<i>"Fuck you!"
Fuck you!</i>

443
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,260
<i>This is our city!</i>

444
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:33,360
<i>Whoever they send here,
we're going to catch them!</i>

445
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,760
<i>We're going to cook them!</i>

446
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,061
<i>And we're going to eat them.....</i>

447
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:46,960
<i>Eat them, man!</i>

448
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,159
<i>Here we go.....</i>

449
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:04,659
- No! No!
- No! No, no....

450
00:55:09,858 --> 00:55:12,259
- Burn him!
- Burn him!

451
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:17,057
- Please! Please!
- No! No!

452
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:23,358
<i>Get off!</i>

453
00:55:37,757 --> 00:55:39,458
<i>You bitch!</i>

454
00:56:59,856 --> 00:57:00,856
Yes!

455
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:31,355
If you're hungry,
why not try a piece of your friend?

456
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:35,655
<i>Hey...</i>

457
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,855
What do I have to do to get a drink?

458
00:57:46,855 --> 00:57:50,954
Put the key in the lock,
and turn it very slowly.

459
00:58:05,755 --> 00:58:08,255
That wasn't so painful, was it?

460
00:58:28,353 --> 00:58:31,554
Wait!
Get me out of here, and I can help you.

461
00:58:32,253 --> 00:58:36,054
You can help me? Why?
What are you offering?

462
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,353
I heard you speaking to Sol.

463
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:41,653
You said you came through the wall.

464
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,753
No, no, no. Please.
Don't leave me here! He will kill me.

465
00:58:46,003 --> 00:58:50,653
You have to do better than that,
I am afraid. I can help you find Kane.

466
00:58:55,853 --> 00:58:59,853
- You know where Kane is?
- I should. He's my father.

467
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:03,552
If I find out you're lying,

468
00:59:03,853 --> 00:59:06,253
you will wish that I'd left you here.

469
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:10,253
Follow me, and you keep
your bloody voice down.

470
00:59:12,753 --> 00:59:13,603
<i>Look out!</i>

471
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:03,251
You can let go now.

472
01:00:04,152 --> 01:00:05,251
Move it!

473
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:17,052
<i>Come in, Sergeant!
Sinclair, this is Norton. Where are you?</i>

474
01:00:17,052 --> 01:00:19,951
On the move!
Meet us at the station on Queen Street!

475
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,050
Station on Queen Street, copy.

476
01:00:24,451 --> 01:00:25,751
Come on.

477
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:36,851
<i>Find her....</i>

478
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:42,351
Come on!

479
01:00:44,851 --> 01:00:46,851
Joshua, it's okay!

480
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:51,550
- You can trust her.
- She looks dangerous. She is.

481
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:56,251
Norton, do you copy?
Come in.

482
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:00,751
It looks clear.

483
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,750
- Go!
- Go! Go!

484
01:01:12,349 --> 01:01:18,250
When I grab you, I am going to rip your
fucking head off! Run, you little fucker!

485
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,150
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

486
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,750
Leg it!

487
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:30,349
Come on!

488
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,150
This way!

489
01:01:39,849 --> 01:01:41,750
Fucking move it!

490
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:53,048
- Fire up the engine!
- Norton, if you can hear me, platform 4!

491
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:55,949
Are you coming or not?

492
01:01:57,048 --> 01:01:58,449
Come on!

493
01:02:01,248 --> 01:02:03,349
- Come on!
- Move it!

494
01:02:09,849 --> 01:02:13,349
<i>- Get on!
- You fucker....</i>

495
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:18,349
Come on, Stirling!

496
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:19,748
No!

497
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:28,009
<i>Come on!</i>

498
01:02:39,447 --> 01:02:41,347
Stirling, get down!

499
01:02:47,148 --> 01:02:48,547
Come on!

500
01:02:52,447 --> 01:02:53,847
Come on!

501
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:56,847
Move it!

502
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:06,047
- Come on!
- Run, Major! Faster!

503
01:03:08,347 --> 01:03:09,347
Come on!

504
01:03:14,746 --> 01:03:15,996
<i>No....</i>

505
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:40,547
Where are you taking us?

506
01:03:41,146 --> 01:03:43,047
Somewhere safe for the moment.

507
01:03:43,047 --> 01:03:46,146
Sorry to piss in your chips,
but we haven't got time to play safe.

508
01:03:46,146 --> 01:03:48,847
You said you'd take us to Kane,
and I need to see him now.

509
01:03:48,847 --> 01:03:53,146
I said I would help you find him.
I can't take you to him. Why not?

510
01:03:53,847 --> 01:03:55,646
Because he will kill me.

511
01:03:55,646 --> 01:03:58,445
And if he finds out where
you're from, he will kill you too.

512
01:03:58,445 --> 01:04:02,005
Ever since Sol left, he's become
suspicious of everyone, even me.

513
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:06,246
His people are too afraid to defy him,
and those who dare are tortured or killed.

514
01:04:07,646 --> 01:04:09,905
You're living proof of a
world beyond that wall.

515
01:04:09,905 --> 01:04:12,005
All our lives he told us
there was nothing out there.

516
01:04:12,005 --> 01:04:15,346
You being here makes him a liar.
What were you doing in the city?

517
01:04:15,346 --> 01:04:20,545
- I went to find my brother. Sol.
- That maniac is your brother?

518
01:04:20,545 --> 01:04:24,346
- That is one fucked up family, man.
- They're at war.

519
01:04:25,746 --> 01:04:27,846
And we're caught right in the middle.

520
01:05:22,344 --> 01:05:23,445
What is this place?

521
01:05:23,445 --> 01:05:27,443
- A shortcut through the mountain.
- We use it all the time.

522
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:46,704
Looks like an old military
facility or something.

523
01:05:46,704 --> 01:05:51,543
Whatever it was, they left in a hurry.
Didn't even bother to lock the doors.

524
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:26,943
Jesus, what have they got
in here, the Lost Ark?

525
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,842
Don't know, mate, but those
blast doors are 12 inches thick.

526
01:06:30,842 --> 01:06:34,742
Whatever it is, somebody
somewhere wanted it kept safe.

527
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:20,141
Somebody's coming.

528
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:22,342
<i>Telamon.</i>

529
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:24,242
Run.

530
01:07:24,842 --> 01:07:28,242
- Wait, who or what is Telamon?
- He's Kane's executioner.

531
01:07:28,242 --> 01:07:30,141
Come on. Come on.

532
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:37,221
Come on. You can go, I am staying.
Give me your sidearm, and get out of sight.

533
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:39,240
You really don't give a fuck, do you?

534
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,641
I think your plan's shit,
but I guess I will stand with you.

535
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,840
There's something you don't see everyday.

536
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,340
- No! No! Joshua!
- No! No! No!

537
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:26,539
Come on!
Come on! Move!

538
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:41,239
Sergeant, put down your weapon.

539
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:46,239
We need to get to Kane the quickest way possible,
and this is it. Yeah, all right. Fuck it.

540
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:54,039
I hope you know what you're doing.

541
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:57,438
Wayward daughter returns.

542
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:04,537
You brought some friends.
Came over the wall. We want to see Kane.

543
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:46,537
I knew they'd be watching the cities.

544
01:10:46,537 --> 01:10:50,636
That's why we chose this place.
Out of sight, out of mind.

545
01:10:51,537 --> 01:10:54,537
I suppose it was only a matter of time

546
01:10:54,537 --> 01:10:57,837
before they sent someone
to answer to the question,

547
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:01,936
"Why are you alive
when you should be dead?"

548
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:06,936
- That's what you want to know, isn't it?
- Ow! Answer him!

549
01:11:08,436 --> 01:11:10,836
Something along those lines.

550
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,336
Leave us.

551
01:11:25,136 --> 01:11:31,735
The answer is easy. In the land of
the infected, the immune man is king.

552
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:35,536
So if this is just a power trip,
why stay hidden?

553
01:11:36,336 --> 01:11:37,836
Why not show yourselves?

554
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:42,515
You think we chose to cast off the
apparel of our former existence?

555
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:47,235
No, no, no. We didn't choose anything.
We were delivered.

556
01:11:50,136 --> 01:11:52,536
These walls around you,

557
01:11:52,836 --> 01:11:54,335
they were built to last.

558
01:11:54,335 --> 01:11:59,935
And so shall we. What we have built
here from the ashes is pure blood,

559
01:11:59,935 --> 01:12:03,034
uninfected by the outside world...

560
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:05,435
...until now.

561
01:12:06,335 --> 01:12:08,234
Have you found the cure?

562
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:13,534
Even now you still cling to hope, huh?

563
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:17,135
If I were you, I would
abandon any such thoughts.

564
01:12:17,435 --> 01:12:23,835
- There's always hope.
- But there is no cure. There never was.

565
01:12:23,835 --> 01:12:27,935
We had prevailed here,
not because of science,

566
01:12:27,935 --> 01:12:32,234
but through natural selection.
Survival of the fittest.

567
01:12:34,835 --> 01:12:39,934
We have earned the right to live here.
Purged of the likes of you.

568
01:12:41,234 --> 01:12:45,333
Take them away.
Don't you even want to know why we're here?

569
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:52,634
That you're here at all is sin enough.
It's the Reaper virus. It's back.

570
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:57,634
And if he touches me one more time,
I will kill him where he stands, I swear.

571
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:12,234
How dare they send you
here to ask for my help?

572
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:14,533
They started this fire.

573
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:16,533
They can burn in it!

574
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:49,033
<i>Place your right hand on the screen.</i>

575
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:55,132
<i>Now look into the retinal scanner.</i>

576
01:14:00,932 --> 01:14:02,733
We're losing our city.

577
01:14:04,032 --> 01:14:05,832
I better get up there.

578
01:14:06,231 --> 01:14:09,431
It's time to get you out, Prime Minister.

579
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:24,631
<i>Sub level 6.</i>

580
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:50,831
How the hell did this man...

581
01:14:58,131 --> 01:15:03,331
Isolate him. Put him in his office, and do it now.
Move, sir. I don't understand how I...

582
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:09,730
- Keep your distance! Canaris, I...
- Canaris! Back away! Canaris!

583
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,030
Good shot.

584
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:18,631
I was trying to save him!

585
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:35,130
You brought impurity into our world.
You must be cleansed. Do it.

586
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,130
- Please, Father.
- Please.

587
01:15:41,529 --> 01:15:44,930
- Father, please!
- No!

588
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:51,079
- Daddy....
- No... Daddy...

589
01:15:51,529 --> 01:15:52,930
<i>Daddy...</i>

590
01:15:55,829 --> 01:15:57,130
<i>No....</i>

591
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,729
You, turn around.

592
01:16:20,328 --> 01:16:21,828
Tie her hands.

593
01:16:29,529 --> 01:16:33,328
Sinclair, what did they call you
before they called you Major?

594
01:16:33,328 --> 01:16:38,529
Eden. Well, Eden, I still
think this is a shit plan.

595
01:17:01,728 --> 01:17:03,828
So, tell me.

596
01:17:05,427 --> 01:17:08,028
What's it like out there now?

597
01:17:08,828 --> 01:17:12,127
What do you care?
I am curious.

598
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:16,427
Same shit, different era.

599
01:17:16,427 --> 01:17:21,127
So we did the right thing, then, eh,
by keeping ourselves to ourselves.

600
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:24,728
Don't you mean turning your back?
You used to be a doctor.

601
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:29,627
At what point did you stop caring?
I used to be an idealist, too.

602
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:34,828
That night that they closed the gates.

603
01:17:36,427 --> 01:17:41,226
That night, I lost everything.

604
01:17:41,226 --> 01:17:43,527
My wife, my family.

605
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:49,627
- You don't know the pain.
- You chose to stay hidden.

606
01:17:50,827 --> 01:17:55,827
Your wife and family could still be out there.
You ever stop to think about their pain?

607
01:17:55,827 --> 01:18:00,827
I haven't slept one night in 25 years
without reliving that moment.

608
01:18:01,327 --> 01:18:05,226
Who the hell are you to talk to me about pain?
What do you know?

609
01:18:06,426 --> 01:18:08,627
What did you ever lose?

610
01:19:10,824 --> 01:19:12,125
Bollocks!

611
01:20:27,224 --> 01:20:30,524
Daddy wants to see you.
Step away!

612
01:20:36,023 --> 01:20:38,622
Don't fuck about, mate.
I am not in the mood.

613
01:20:38,622 --> 01:20:41,023
Stirling, get the keys!

614
01:20:48,622 --> 01:20:49,922
Back off.

615
01:21:19,322 --> 01:21:22,221
Out of the way, you dozy twat!

616
01:21:23,021 --> 01:21:24,122
In there.

617
01:21:25,002 --> 01:21:26,622
Doctor, not now.

618
01:21:29,122 --> 01:21:34,122
Grenades. Lovely. That will do nicely.
Come on, Doctor!

619
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,720
I will tell you what I have lost.

620
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,621
I have lost my bloody mind.

621
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,619
Execute the prisoners!
Now!

622
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:09,569
Man the defenses!
We're under attack!

623
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:30,519
That's it.

624
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:42,719
- Nice.
- Yeah? Cool. Come, come, come.

625
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,019
Where are they?
Where are they?

626
01:23:49,618 --> 01:23:50,819
Fuckers!

627
01:23:58,118 --> 01:24:01,918
- You, finish her off.
- Shit.

628
01:24:18,217 --> 01:24:21,018
Cally!
Come on! We have no time!

629
01:24:28,118 --> 01:24:30,417
Come on. Watch out.
Come on.

630
01:24:34,318 --> 01:24:35,917
Get to the horses!

631
01:24:51,217 --> 01:24:52,717
- Move it!
- Move it!

632
01:24:58,006 --> 01:25:03,516
- Come on! Grab the torches! Here you go.
- Sergeant, jam the door. Go on!

633
01:25:14,016 --> 01:25:17,417
Sergeant, check and see if
there's a backup generator.

634
01:25:24,016 --> 01:25:26,417
We're going to need something, and fast.

635
01:25:39,115 --> 01:25:40,815
Take your pick.

636
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,315
Let's try that box.

637
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:59,416
No! Well, what are you looking at?
Break that fucker down!

638
01:26:06,815 --> 01:26:10,416
- Whoa.
- Nice color. I will take it.

639
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:14,315
- I will get those blasting doors open.
- Stirling, Cally, fill her up.

640
01:26:14,615 --> 01:26:16,515
- Where you going?
- I am going to find a phone.

641
01:26:17,115 --> 01:26:20,615
Help me with it.
Hurry up, you lazy twats!

642
01:26:51,314 --> 01:26:52,614
<i>Come on!</i>

643
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:00,215
Perfect.

644
01:27:09,113 --> 01:27:11,713
- Get in the back!
- What does it do?

645
01:27:12,514 --> 01:27:14,314
I will show you what it does.

646
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:11,912
Nelson. We got the package.
We're on our way.

647
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,810
Well, you'd better get here quick.

648
01:29:17,711 --> 01:29:20,810
Canaris is in charge now.
Hatcher's dead.

649
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:24,411
Put him on.

650
01:29:25,911 --> 01:29:27,310
It's for you.

651
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:33,310
Yes?

652
01:29:33,711 --> 01:29:37,011
You still want your prize?
Then follow this signal.

653
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:46,110
Trace the source. Send the coordinates
directly to me. Okay, that's it.

654
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:50,110
Let's go.
Hold the fort while I am away.

655
01:29:50,110 --> 01:29:54,110
This is as far as you go.
We will handle it from here.

656
01:30:17,909 --> 01:30:20,310
Un-bloody-believable!

657
01:30:22,109 --> 01:30:27,609
Fuck, yeah! Put your foot down!
I am tired of running from these bastards. Hold on!

658
01:30:32,409 --> 01:30:33,409
Yeah!

659
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,109
Step on it!

660
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:45,408
<i>Fucker!</i>

661
01:31:09,109 --> 01:31:11,509
<i>- Shit!
- Jesus....</i>

662
01:31:37,007 --> 01:31:38,807
Too fucking close.

663
01:31:38,807 --> 01:31:40,207
You think?

664
01:32:00,108 --> 01:32:02,108
Hold on, we're going for a ride.

665
01:32:02,807 --> 01:32:04,507
Are you out of your fucking mind?

666
01:32:41,506 --> 01:32:43,106
Fuck!

667
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:51,407
Here they come.

668
01:32:52,106 --> 01:32:53,805
Come on!

669
01:33:27,605 --> 01:33:28,756
<i>No....</i>

670
01:33:39,204 --> 01:33:41,005
- No!
- No! No....

671
01:33:48,904 --> 01:33:50,704
- No...
- No....

672
01:33:55,604 --> 01:33:56,805
Please.

673
01:33:58,104 --> 01:34:01,305
Please stop!
You will kill us.

674
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:04,305
Cally!

675
01:34:06,805 --> 01:34:09,805
Get off of her, you bitch!

676
01:35:03,403 --> 01:35:04,502
Cally!

677
01:35:20,603 --> 01:35:21,802
<i>Okay.</i>

678
01:35:26,703 --> 01:35:30,302
- You like pain?
- Yeah. Have some of this!

679
01:36:04,202 --> 01:36:06,202
Put your foot down!

680
01:36:19,902 --> 01:36:20,902
No.

681
01:36:22,502 --> 01:36:25,902
Cally!
Cally! Cally! Cally!

682
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:34,801
- No!
- Oh, shit. No! Stop!

683
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,501
You dirty fuckers!

684
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:46,600
Fuck!

685
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:22,949
<i>Shit....</i>

686
01:38:05,798 --> 01:38:07,899
What the fuck's going on, Sinclair?

687
01:38:09,998 --> 01:38:11,578
They want my cure.

688
01:38:35,198 --> 01:38:36,798
Major Sinclair.

689
01:38:38,298 --> 01:38:40,497
You had me worried for a while.

690
01:38:41,398 --> 01:38:42,898
Do you have it?

691
01:38:44,198 --> 01:38:45,597
I have got it.

692
01:38:46,997 --> 01:38:48,198
Where's the medical team?

693
01:38:48,198 --> 01:38:51,997
Let's not make this difficult.
You have done a good job.

694
01:38:51,997 --> 01:38:55,597
We will take it from here.
Stirling, bring her out.

695
01:39:04,198 --> 01:39:07,398
You have to forgive Stirling.
He's very involved with his work.

696
01:39:07,398 --> 01:39:09,698
Okay. Let's go.

697
01:39:09,698 --> 01:39:11,698
We understand the need for sacrifice.

698
01:39:11,698 --> 01:39:16,597
The longer we leave it, the better
shape we will be in once the dust settles.

699
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:22,097
Once the virus has eaten away the
dead flesh, then we will make our move.

700
01:39:22,097 --> 01:39:25,697
- Just a question of timing.
- Making you the hero of the hour.

701
01:39:25,697 --> 01:39:31,296
You said you had the cure. Where is it?
She's the cure. The survivors are immune.

702
01:39:31,296 --> 01:39:34,497
We can use her blood to make a vaccine.

703
01:39:35,497 --> 01:39:37,896
- Hand her over.
- She's not going anywhere without me.

704
01:39:37,896 --> 01:39:40,896
- Captain.
- Get behind me.

705
01:39:41,697 --> 01:39:43,596
Hand her over now.

706
01:39:44,296 --> 01:39:45,796
Go with them.

707
01:39:47,006 --> 01:39:48,596
I don't trust him.

708
01:39:49,997 --> 01:39:54,497
- There's no choice. So that's it?
- I have got nothing left to bargain with.

709
01:39:55,497 --> 01:39:57,096
I have done my job.

710
01:39:59,296 --> 01:40:03,596
Now it's your turn.
A lot of good people died for this!

711
01:40:04,697 --> 01:40:06,596
Is that all it was to you?

712
01:40:07,595 --> 01:40:08,695
A job?

713
01:40:11,895 --> 01:40:13,395
That's right.

714
01:40:15,496 --> 01:40:17,395
Now, take her and go.

715
01:40:30,195 --> 01:40:33,296
- Rough ride?
- Rough enough.

716
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:36,996
Don't suppose
you have got a cigarette?

717
01:40:36,996 --> 01:40:41,395
Come with me.
I will get you all the cigarettes you want.

718
01:40:44,595 --> 01:40:48,595
Pity.
I could have used someone like you.

719
01:41:57,293 --> 01:41:58,993
She's so beautiful.

720
01:42:10,493 --> 01:42:11,793
You okay?

721
01:42:18,393 --> 01:42:19,792
Never better.

722
01:42:21,393 --> 01:42:23,193
How'd you find me?

723
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:26,493
I used to be a policeman once.

724
01:42:31,592 --> 01:42:34,893
I don't need it anymore.
Really?

725
01:42:37,592 --> 01:42:41,292
Did Canaris get what he wanted?
He did.

726
01:42:44,193 --> 01:42:47,993
I have a feeling he will be
holding onto it for awhile. Shit.

727
01:42:50,792 --> 01:42:52,292
Don't worry.

728
01:42:52,893 --> 01:42:55,193
He gave me something in return.

729
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:01,091
All the evidence you will
need to bring Canaris down.

730
01:43:01,492 --> 01:43:05,391
He will come after you.
Well, then he will know where to find me.

731
01:43:08,792 --> 01:43:10,091
<i>Come on.</i>

732
01:43:28,002 --> 01:43:31,492
- Just do me one favor.
- Drive careful.

733
01:43:32,891 --> 01:43:34,091
Be lucky.

734
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:57,390
<i>The longer we leave it, the better shape
we will be in once the dust settles.</i>

735
01:43:57,390 --> 01:44:02,990
<i>Once the virus has eaten away the
dead flesh, then we will make our move.</i>

736
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:05,591
<i>Making you the hero of the hour.</i>

737
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,689
If you're hungry,

738
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:54,090
try a piece of your friend.
