1
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:08,311
<i>After I killed them,
I dropped the gun in the Thames,</i>

2
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:11,578
<i>washed the residue off me hands
in the bathroom of a Burger King,</i>

3
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:14,292
<i>and walked home
to await instructions.</i>

4
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:18,530
<i>Shortly thereafter,
the instructions came through.</i>

5
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,353
<i>'Get the fuck out of London,
youse dumb fucks.</i>

6
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:24,031
<i>'Get to Bruges:'</i>

7
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:28,510
<i>I didn't even know
where Bruges fucking was.</i>

8
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:34,140
<i>It's in Belgium.</i>

9
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:38,831
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

10
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,270
<i>Bruges is
not a shithole.</i>

11
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,367
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

12
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,436
<i>Ray, we've only just
got off the fucking train.</i>

13
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,409
<i>Could we reserve judgment on Bruges
until we've seen the fucking place?</i>

14
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,051
<i>I know it's gonna be
a shithole.</i>

15
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:17,781
Shithole.

16
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:27,544
I think you have a couple of rooms
booked under Cranham and Blakely?

17
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:30,824
Yes. No, we have one room booked.

18
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,933
One twin room.
Booked for two weeks.

19
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,167
Two weeks!

20
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:37,951
Do you have another room?

21
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:39,585
No, I'm afraid we're fully booked.

22
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:42,608
With Christmas,
everywhere is fully booked.

23
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,691
Okay.

24
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:51,633
It's very pretty.

25
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,229
I'm not being funny,
we can't stay here.

26
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,201
We've got to stay here
until he rings.

27
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,635
Well, what if he doesn't
ring for two weeks?

28
00:02:56,735 --> 00:02:58,336
Then we stay here for two weeks.

29
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:02,206
For two weeks? In fucking Bruges?
In a room like this?

30
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:03,919
With you? No way!

31
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:06,710
Ray, I really don't like to say this.

32
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,147
You really don't like to say what?

33
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:10,961
Well. You know?

34
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,366
Fucking bring that up.

35
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:54,052
Do you think this is good?

36
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,151
Do I think what's good?

37
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:59,435
You know, going round in a boat,
looking at stuff.

38
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:02,007
Yes, I do.

39
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,604
It's called 'sightseeing.'

40
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,048
Oh, look at that.

41
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,917
It's a former hospital.
From the 1100s.

42
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:29,285
Bruges is the most
well-preserved medieval town

43
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:31,766
in the whole of
Belgium, apparently.

44
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:56,053
Coming up?
What's up there?

45
00:04:57,158 --> 00:04:58,774
The view.

46
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:02,612
The view of what? The view of down here?
I can see that from down here.

47
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,016
Ray, you're about
the worst tourist in the whole world.

48
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:10,485
Ken, I grew up in Dublin.
I love Dublin.

49
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:14,220
If I'd grown up on a farm and was
retarded, Bruges might impress me.

50
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,432
But I didn't, so it doesn't.

51
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:31,167
Trying to get rid of me coins.

52
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:34,302
3, 3.50, 4,

53
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:39,874
4.10, 4.20, 4.30,
4.40, 4.50, 4.60,

54
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,178
4.70,

55
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,788
4.80,

56
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,997
4.90.

57
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:51,519
Will you take 4.90?

58
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,505
Entry is 5 euro.

59
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:57,158
Come on, man,
it's only 10 cents.

60
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,608
Entry is 5 euro.

61
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:11,372
Happy in your work?

62
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,480
Very happy.

63
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,312
I like it here.

64
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,598
Been to the top of the tower?

65
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:24,163
Yeah. Yeah, it's rubbish.

66
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:27,312
It is? The guidebook says
it's a 'must-see'.

67
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,869
Well, you lot ain't going up there.

68
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,538
Pardon me? Why?

69
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:36,545
I mean, it's all windy stairs.
I'm not being funny.

70
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,120
What exactly are you
trying to say?

71
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:41,846
What exactly
am I trying to say?

72
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:44,319
Youse are a bunch
of fucking elephants!

73
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,894
Right, you.

74
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:55,168
Come on, leave it, fatty.

75
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:08,122
You know, you're just
the rudest man. The rudest man!

76
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,689
What's all that about?

77
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:14,077
They're not going up there.

78
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:17,581
Hey, guys, I wouldn't go up there.
It's really narrow.

79
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:19,689
Screw you, motherfucker!

80
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,867
Americans, isn't it?

81
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:32,793
Now, this is more like it.
Proper holidays.

82
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,392
One gay beer
for my gay friend,

83
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:37,129
and one normal beer for me,
because I am normal.

84
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,734
This is the life.

85
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:42,412
We're not staying here getting pissed.

86
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,671
We are quietly sightseeing,
like he says,

87
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,404
and awaiting his call
to see what we do next.

88
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,408
This is my vote
on what we should do.

89
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:52,086
We give it another day,
two days, max.

90
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:54,980
Then we check the papers again,
and if there's still nothing in them,

91
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,316
we phone him and say, 'Harry,
thank you for the trip to Bruges,

92
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:00,818
'it's been very nice, all the
old buildings and that,

93
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,619
'but we're coming back to London now,
and hide out in a proper country,

94
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,955
'where it isn't all just
fucking chocolates.'

95
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:09,532
My vote would be
we quietly sightsee, like he says,

96
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:13,043
and await his call
to see what we do next.

97
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:18,812
You don't even know
we're here hiding out.

98
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,970
What are you talking about?

99
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,337
You don't even know
we're not here on a job.

100
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,437
- What, on a job?
- Yeah.

101
00:09:26,537 --> 00:09:28,038
- Here in Bruges?
- Yeah.

102
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:30,525
- Here in Bruges, on a job?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:32,943
Why? What did he actually say?

104
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:34,447
He didn't actually say anything.

105
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:37,418
- Then why do you think it might be?
- I don't think anything.

106
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:40,453
But it's a bit fucking
over-elaborate, isn't it?

107
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:43,051
- 'Go take him to hide out.'
- 'Go take him to hide out where?'

108
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,040
'Go take him to hide out
in fucking Bruges.'

109
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:49,604
You can hide out in Croydon.

110
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:51,936
Hmm.

111
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,514
Or Coventry.

112
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:57,874
Hmm.

113
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:02,179
It is a bit over-elaborate.

114
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,279
Hmm.

115
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,909
But we haven't got any guns.

116
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,292
Harry can get guns anywhere.

117
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:34,709
He's not gonna ring tonight.

118
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,515
He's not gonna ring tonight.

119
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:46,606
Let's go out.

120
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,613
- Go out where?
- The pub.

121
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:49,720
No!

122
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:10,030
Let's go out and have a look
at some of the...

123
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,764
All the old medieval
buildings and that.

124
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:16,411
Because I bet they look even
better at night, all lit up.

125
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:21,981
Yes!

126
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:34,447
That there is called
the Gruuthuse Museum.

127
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:36,584
They all have funny names,
don't they?

128
00:11:36,683 --> 00:11:38,162
Yes, Flemish.

129
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:42,158
In here it says, 'The Belgians
twice sheltered fugitive English Kings

130
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:45,129
'from being murdered, 1471 and 1651.'

131
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:47,529
I used to hate history,
didn't you?

132
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:49,999
It's all just a load of stuff
that's already happened.

133
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,000
What are they doing over there?

134
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,711
They're filming something.
They're filming midgets!

135
00:11:56,254 --> 00:11:57,380
Ray!

136
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:04,586
So, on this scene, you're supposed
to walk like a little, tiny mouse, yeah?

137
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,865
Okay? Great.

138
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,418
Ray, come on, let's go.

139
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,336
My arse, 'Let's go.'
They're filming midgets.

140
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,956
Oh, my God!
Look at that girl.

141
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:23,556
She's gorgeous!

142
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:24,826
Ray, we're going right now.

143
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,392
Fuck off, are we!

144
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:30,313
This is the best bit of Bruges
so far. You and your buildings.

145
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:55,999
Hello.

146
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,336
Do you speak English?
No.

147
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:05,361
Yes, you do.
Everybody does.

148
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:08,063
What are you filming midgets for?

149
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,517
It's a Dutch movie.
It's a dream sequence.

150
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:14,937
<i>It's a pastiche of Nicholas Roeg's
Don't Look Now.</i>

151
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:16,990
Not a pastiche, but a...

152
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:21,585
A 'homage' is too strong.
A 'nod of the head'?

153
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:26,294
Wow, your English is very good.

154
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,665
A lot of midgets
tend to kill themselves.

155
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,438
A disproportionate amount.

156
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,001
<i>Herve Villechaize,
off of Fantasy Island.</i>

157
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:46,099
<i>I think somebody
off The Time Bandits.</i>

158
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:49,447
I suppose they must
get really sad about, like,

159
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,537
being really little and that.

160
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:55,203
People looking at them
and laughing at them.

161
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:58,556
Calling them names.
You know, 'shortarse.'

162
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:04,288
There's another famous
midget I'm missing, but I can't remember.

163
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:08,264
It's not the R2-D2 man.
No, he's still going.

164
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:14,267
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself.
Your dream sequence will be fucked.

165
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:17,455
He doesn't like being called a midget.
He prefers 'dwarf.'

166
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:19,927
Well, this is exactly my point!

167
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:23,128
People go around calling you a midget
when you want to be called a dwarf.

168
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:26,048
Of course you're
gonna blow your head off!

169
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,514
- My name's Ray. What's yours?
- Chloe.

170
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,672
How did you get past
the security man?

171
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:38,076
Getting past security men,
it's sort of my job.

172
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,113
You're a shoplifter?

173
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,243
No, not a shoplifter.

174
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:43,298
It's a good joke, though.

175
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,427
No.

176
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:48,986
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

177
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:06,379
Fuck.

178
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:21,193
How fucking cool.

179
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,057
Mr. Blakely?

180
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:37,841
- Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.
- No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

181
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:42,614
You have a message.

182
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:48,981
Shit!

183
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:53,040
<i>Number one, why aren't you
in when I fucking told you to be in?</i>

184
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,241
<i>Number two, why doesn't this hotel
have phones with fucking voicemail</i>

185
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:59,080
<i>and not I have to leave messages
with the fucking receptionist?</i>

186
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:02,049
<i>Number three, you better fucking be in
tomorrow night when I fucking call again</i>

187
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:06,264
<i>or there'll be fucking Hell to pay,
I'm fucking telling you, Harry.</i>

188
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,989
Would you turn
the fucking light off!

189
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,586
Sorry, Ken.

190
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:49,801
Keep the fucking noise down!

191
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,740
Someone's in a mood.

192
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:10,271
You'll never guess what.

193
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,441
Will you shut your fucking mouth,
please, and go to sleep?

194
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,190
Oh, sorry.

195
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,692
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out.

196
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,259
Altogether,

197
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,810
I had

198
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:36,047
five pints of beer
and six bottles.

199
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:41,835
No. Six pints of beer
and seven bottles.

200
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,548
And you know what?
I'm not even pissed!

201
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:52,656
You'll never guess what, Ken.

202
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:56,445
- Ken, you'll never guess what.
- What?

203
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:57,647
Got a date for tomorrow night.

204
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:58,815
I'm very happy for you.

205
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:00,016
With a girl.

206
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:01,365
Can you turn
the light off, please?

207
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:04,323
Only been in Bruges one day, got a date
with a girl in the film business,

208
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,465
the Belgian film business.

209
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,268
They're doing a film about a midget.

210
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:29,752
Miss?

211
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:31,756
Marie?

212
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:39,435
Sorry about the message last night.
The man who left it is a bit of a...

213
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:42,895
Well, he's a bit of a...

214
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:44,599
Cock?

215
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,801
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

216
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,308
Morning.

217
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:03,580
Harry called last night.

218
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:05,749
We missed him.

219
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:11,029
Jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?

220
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:15,290
We're staying in tonight.
Whatever happens.

221
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:17,096
Hmm.

222
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:19,768
Except...

223
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,637
Hmm.
Hmm.

224
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:25,388
Except 'hmm' what?

225
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:30,229
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

226
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:31,541
Uh-huh.

227
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:35,766
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

228
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,270
I thought you didn't like Bruges.

229
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:39,137
I don't like Bruges,
it's a shithole.

230
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:43,008
But I did already say I had a date
with a Belgian lady

231
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:47,153
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already say about before.

232
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:54,349
Just don't get into
any fucking trouble.

233
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:56,561
We're keeping a low profile.

234
00:19:57,171 --> 00:20:00,887
And this morning,
and this afternoon,

235
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:03,325
we are doing what I want to do.

236
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:05,173
- Got it?
- Of course.

237
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:07,931
Which, I presume,
will involve culture.

238
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,730
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

239
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,377
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the
balance shall tip in the favor of culture.

240
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:21,240
Like a big, fat, fucking retarded,
fucking black girl

241
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,020
on a seesaw, opposite

242
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,027
a dwarf.

243
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,679
Ray, did we
or did we not agree

244
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,244
that if I let you
go on your date tonight,

245
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:11,285
we'd do the things
I wanted to do today?

246
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:13,219
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

247
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:15,851
And that we'd do them without you
throwing a fucking moody,

248
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:18,289
like some 5-year-old who's dropped
all his sweets?

249
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,342
I didn't agree to that.

250
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:23,304
I'll cheer up.
I'll cheer up.

251
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:26,682
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

252
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,930
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

253
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,601
And that phial, do you know what
it's said to contain?

254
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:35,234
No, what's it
said to contain?

255
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:39,270
It's said to contain some drops of
Jesus Christ's blood.

256
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:43,076
Yeah, that's how this church got
its name. Basilica of the Holy Blood.

257
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,512
Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:47,464
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

259
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:51,615
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid.

260
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:54,353
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood.

261
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:56,566
At various times of great

262
00:21:58,175 --> 00:21:59,390
stress.

263
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,759
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

264
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:05,929
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue
and touch it, which is what you do.

265
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You coming?

266
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,209
Do I have to?

267
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:14,673
- Do you have to?
- Of course you don't have to.

268
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:18,609
It's Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it?
Of course you don't fucking have to!

269
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,218
Of course you don't
fucking have to!

270
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,125
You little fucking cunt.

271
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:42,057
<i>Murder, Father.</i>

272
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,731
<i>Why did you
murder someone, Raymond?</i>

273
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:49,364
For money, Father.

274
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:51,137
For money?

275
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:54,160
You murdered someone for money?

276
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:55,231
Yes, Father.

277
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:58,576
Not out of anger, not out of nothing.
For money.

278
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:03,843
Who did you murder
for money, Raymond?

279
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,018
You, Father.

280
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:09,237
I'm sorry?

281
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:12,019
I said you, Father.
What, are you deaf?

282
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,426
Harry Waters says hello.

283
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:33,307
The little boy.

284
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:21,982
I quite like this one.

285
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:26,323
All the rest were rubbish by spastics,
but this one's quite good.

286
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:28,433
What's that all about, then?

287
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:33,441
- It's Judgment Day, you know?
- Oh, yeah.

288
00:26:36,484 --> 00:26:38,964
What's that then?

289
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:42,146
Well, it's, you know,
the final day on Earth.

290
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:47,917
When mankind will be judged for all
the crimes they've committed and that.

291
00:26:49,496 --> 00:26:52,915
And see who gets into Heaven and
who gets into Hell and all that?

292
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:54,045
Yeah.

293
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:55,914
And what's the other place?

294
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,215
Purgatory.

295
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,550
Purgatory?

296
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,719
Purgatory's kind of like
the in-betweeny one.

297
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:06,799
You weren't really shit, but you
weren't all that great, either.

298
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:08,969
Like Tottenham.

299
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:12,365
Do you believe
in all that stuff, Ken?

300
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,928
About Tottenham?

301
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:16,382
The Last Judgment
and the afterlife.

302
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:22,346
Guilt and sins and

303
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:26,622
Hell and all that?

304
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:30,285
Um...

305
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,689
Well...

306
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:44,366
I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

307
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:48,192
The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

308
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,529
So, like, I believe in trying
to lead a good life.

309
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,265
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

310
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:58,068
I don't try and help her carry her
shopping, I don't go that far,

311
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:02,338
but I'll certainly hold the door open for her and that,
and let her go out before me.

312
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,539
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried to
help her carry her shopping,

313
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,545
she'd probably think you were
just trying to nick her shopping.

314
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:09,445
Exactly. This is the world
we live in today.

315
00:28:09,546 --> 00:28:12,864
At the same time as trying to lead
a good life,

316
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:18,568
I have to reconcile myself with the
fact that, yes, I have killed people.

317
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:23,066
Not many people. Most of them were
not very nice people.

318
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:25,758
Apart from one person.

319
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,229
Who's that?

320
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:29,730
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother.

321
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,262
He was just trying to protect
his brother. Like you or I would.

322
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,635
He was just a lollipop man.

323
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:39,169
He came at me with a bottle.
What are you gonna do?

324
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:40,641
I shot him down.

325
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,713
Hmm.

326
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:46,211
In my book, though, sorry,
someone comes at you with a bottle,

327
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:48,845
that is a deadly weapon,
he's gotta take the consequences.

328
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,316
I know that in my heart.

329
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:52,683
I also know that he was just trying
to protect his brother, you know?

330
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:55,118
I know. But a bottle,
that can kill you.

331
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:56,384
It's a case of
it's you or him.

332
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,356
If he'd come at you with his
bare hands, that'd be different.

333
00:28:58,457 --> 00:28:59,452
That wouldn't
have been fair.

334
00:28:59,552 --> 00:29:01,892
Well, technically, your bare hands
can kill somebody, too.

335
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,760
They can be deadly weapons, too.
I mean, what if he knew karate, say?

336
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,060
You said he was
a lollipop man.

337
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,963
He was a lollipop man.

338
00:29:08,064 --> 00:29:10,298
What's a lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

339
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:11,396
I'm just saying.

340
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:14,032
- How old was he?
- About 50.

341
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,538
What's a 50-year-old lollipop man
doing knowing fucking karate?

342
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,973
What was he,
a Chinese lollipop man?

343
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:22,151
Jesus, Ken, I'm trying to
talk about...

344
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,451
I know what you're
trying to talk about.

345
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:35,820
I killed a little boy.
You keep bringing up fucking lollipop men!

346
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:37,655
You didn't mean
to kill a little boy.

347
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:39,709
I know I didn't mean to.

348
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:45,259
But because of the choices I made and
the course that I put into action,

349
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,597
a little boy
isn't here anymore.

350
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:49,913
And he'll never be here again.

351
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,513
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium.

352
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,773
Well, he'll never be here in Belgium,
either, will he?

353
00:30:00,874 --> 00:30:04,145
I mean, he might have wanted
to come here when he got older.

354
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:05,857
I don't know why.

355
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:09,627
And that's all because of me.

356
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,818
He's dead because of me.

357
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,337
And I'm trying to...

358
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:19,270
I'm trying to get me head
around it, but I can't.

359
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,241
I will always have
killed that little boy.

360
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:27,615
That ain't ever
going away. Ever.

361
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:30,314
Unless...

362
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:33,279
Maybe I go away.

363
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:40,286
Don't even think like that.

364
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:37,366
You look good.

365
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:43,717
What's it matter anyway?

366
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:10,585
So, what do you do, Raymond?

367
00:32:10,684 --> 00:32:13,574
I shoot people for money.

368
00:32:16,444 --> 00:32:18,161
What kinds of people?

369
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,530
Priests. Children.
You know, the usual.

370
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,630
Is there a lot of money to be made
in that line of business?

371
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,731
There is in priests.
There isn't in children.

372
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:27,068
So what is it you do, Chloe?

373
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:30,248
I sell cocaine and heroin
to Belgian film crews.

374
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:31,917
Do you?

375
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,258
Do I look like I do?

376
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,410
You do, actually.

377
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:45,335
Do I look like
I shoot people?

378
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:47,628
No.

379
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,030
Just children.

380
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:52,837
Mmm-hmm.

381
00:32:58,615 --> 00:33:01,965
I saw your midget today.
Little prick didn't even say hello.

382
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:03,901
Well, he's on a lot of ketamine.

383
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,419
What's that?

384
00:33:07,123 --> 00:33:08,507
Horse tranquilizer.

385
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:10,170
A horse tranquilizer?

386
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:12,710
- Where'd he get that?
- I sold it to him.

387
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:15,886
You can't sell horse tranquilizers
to a midget!

388
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,415
This movie, I think it's gonna be
a very good one.

389
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:23,885
There's never been a classic movie
made in Bruges until now.

390
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,585
Of course there hasn't,
it's a shithole.

391
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:26,920
Bruges is my hometown, Ray.

392
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:28,186
Well, it's still a shithole.

393
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:29,287
It's not a shithole.

394
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:31,887
What? Even midgets have to
take drugs to stick it.

395
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:33,239
Okay.

396
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,896
So, you've insulted my hometown.

397
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,367
You're doing very well, Raymond.

398
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:43,871
Why don't you tell me some
Belgian jokes while you're at it?

399
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:45,535
I don't know any Belgian jokes.

400
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:48,907
And if I did, I think I'd have
the good sense not to...

401
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:53,474
Hey, hang on. Is Belgium where there
were all those child abuse murders lately?

402
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,791
Then I do know a Belgian joke.

403
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,191
What's Belgium famous for?

404
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:02,051
Chocolates and child abuse.

405
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:05,730
And they only invented the chocolates
to get to the kids.

406
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,103
What?

407
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,007
One of the girls they murdered was
a friend of mine.

408
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:23,414
I'm sorry, Chloe.

409
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:35,978
One of the girls they murdered
wasn't a friend of mine.

410
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:38,782
I just wanted to
make you feel bad.

411
00:34:38,882 --> 00:34:41,199
And it worked.
Quite well.

412
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,117
Fucking unbelievable.

413
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,148
What's fucking unbelievable?

414
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,099
Are you talking to me?

415
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,887
He pauses, even though he
should just hit the cunt.

416
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:25,324
And he repeats.

417
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:29,795
Yes, I am talking to you.
What's fucking unbelievable?

418
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,197
Well, I'll tell you what's
fucking unbelievable, shall I?

419
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,931
Blowing cigarette smoke straight into
myself and my girlfriend's face.

420
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,233
That's fucking unbelievable!

421
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:39,467
- This is the smoking section.
- I don't care if it's the smoking section.

422
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:41,905
All right?
She directed it right in my face, man.

423
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,909
I don't wanna
die just because of your fucking arrogance. Uh-huh.

424
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,945
Isn't that what the
Vietnamese used to say?

425
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,213
Vietnamese? What are you
talking about, the Vietnamese?

426
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:53,014
That statement makes
no fucking sense at all.

427
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:54,949
- Yes it does.
- The Vietnamese!

428
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,684
Well, saying it over and over ain't
gonna make any more sense out of it.

429
00:35:57,784 --> 00:36:00,621
How does the Vietnamese
have any relevance whatsoever

430
00:36:00,722 --> 00:36:03,219
to myself and my girlfriend
having to breathe

431
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,956
your friend's cigarette smoke?

432
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,103
Tell me how saying...

433
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,773
That's for John Lennon,
you Yankee fucking cunt!

434
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:13,547
A bottle? No, don't bother.

435
00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:29,057
We're leaving.

436
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:32,530
I don't hit women!
I would never hit a woman, Chloe!

437
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,481
I'd hit a woman who was trying to
hit me with a bottle!

438
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,286
That's different.
That's self-defense, isn't it?

439
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:40,757
Or a woman who could do karate.

440
00:36:40,856 --> 00:36:44,525
I'd never hit a woman generally, Chloe.
Don't think that.

441
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,340
God, you're pretty.

442
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:49,764
I have to make a call.

443
00:36:49,864 --> 00:36:50,873
Oh, no.

444
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:56,045
You've gone off me, now, haven't you?
Just because I hit that fucking cow.

445
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:23,440
<i>Hello?
Where the fuck were you yesterday?</i>

446
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:27,128
We just popped out for some dinner,
Harry. We only popped out for half an hour.

447
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:28,693
<i>Yeah? What'd you have?</i>

448
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:30,565
<i>- For dinner?
- Yeah.</i>

449
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:31,797
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

450
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:32,931
<i>Was it nice?</i>

451
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:34,903
Yeah, it was all right.
I don't know. It was Pizza Hut.

452
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,467
The same as in England.

453
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:40,286
<i>Well, that's globalization,
isn't it? Is Ray there with you?</i>

454
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,911
He's in the toilet.

455
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,177
<i>- Can he hear?
- No.</i>

456
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:46,945
<i>What's he doing?</i>

457
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:50,181
<i>- What do you mean?
- Is he doing a wee or a poo?</i>

458
00:37:50,282 --> 00:37:51,882
I don't know, Harry,
the door's closed.

459
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:56,201
<i>Send him out on an errand for half
an hour, but don't make it sound suspicious.</i>

460
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:04,873
Ray? Why don't you go out down
to the pub for half an hour?

461
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,367
Yeah, yeah, I know I said you couldn't,

462
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:12,181
but might as well enjoy ourselves, eh?

463
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:17,418
No, I don't know if they've got
bowling anywhere. Could have a look.

464
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,047
Yeah, see you.

465
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:32,418
Yeah. He's gone.

466
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,753
<i>What'd you say to him?</i>

467
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:37,259
I said, 'Why don't you go have a drink,
you say you've been cooped up?'

468
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,389
<i>- What did he say?
- Said, yeah, he would.</i>

469
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:41,990
And he might go have a look to see
if there's a bowling alley around.

470
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,693
<i>Was he just having a wee?</i>

471
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:45,597
Yeah, I think so.
I assume so.

472
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:46,730
<i>Sure he didn't mind?</i>

473
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,364
No, he was glad to get out.

474
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:49,565
<i>He's definitely gone?</i>

475
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,070
Yeah, yeah, he slammed the door.

476
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,418
<i>That don't mean he's gone.
Go check outside the door.</i>

477
00:39:11,271 --> 00:39:13,088
Harry, he's definitely gone.

478
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:15,353
<i>You realize there are no
bowling alleys in Bruges?</i>

479
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,922
I realize that, Harry.
The boy wanted to have a look anyway.

480
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:20,360
<i>What are they gonna have,
a medieval fucking bowling alley?</i>

481
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,728
As I say, I think he was just glad
to get out and about.

482
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:25,795
<i>So, is he having a nice time,
seeing all the canals and that?</i>

483
00:39:25,894 --> 00:39:28,032
<i>I had a lovely time
when I was there.</i>

484
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,632
<i>All the canals and the
old buildings and that.</i>

485
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:31,800
When were you here?

486
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,722
<i>When I was seven.
Last happy holiday I fucking had.</i>

487
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:38,842
<i>- Have you been on a canal trip, yet?
- Yeah.</i>

488
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:41,110
<i>Have you been down, like,
all the old cobbled streets and that?</i>

489
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,244
Yeah.

490
00:39:42,344 --> 00:39:44,514
<i>It's like a fairytale,
isn't it, that place? Yeah.</i>

491
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:46,518
<i>With the churches and that.
They're Gothic. Yeah.</i>

492
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:48,150
<i>- Is it Gothic?
- Yeah.</i>

493
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,784
<i>So he's having
a really nice time?</i>

494
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:53,690
Well, I'm having
a really nice time.

495
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,539
I'm not sure if it's
really his cup of tea.

496
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,405
<i>What?</i>

497
00:40:00,914 --> 00:40:02,893
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

498
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:04,597
<i>What do you mean,
'It's not really his thing'?</i>

499
00:40:04,697 --> 00:40:06,800
<i>What's that supposed to mean,
'It's not really his thing'?</i>

500
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,202
<i>What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?</i>

501
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:09,300
Nothing, Harry.

502
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,469
<i>It's a fairytale
fucking town, isn't it?</i>

503
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:14,306
<i>How can a fairytale town not be
somebody's fucking thing?</i>

504
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:17,507
<i>How can all those canals and bridges
and cobbled streets and those churches,</i>

505
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:19,844
<i>all that beautiful
fucking fairytale stuff,</i>

506
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,815
<i>how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

507
00:40:21,914 --> 00:40:23,215
What I think I meant to say was

508
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:25,083
<i>- Is the swan still there?
- Yeah, the swan's...</i>

509
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:28,284
<i>How can fucking swans not fucking
be somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

510
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:29,485
<i>How can that be?</i>

511
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:30,686
What I think I meant to say was,

512
00:40:30,786 --> 00:40:33,922
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

513
00:40:34,023 --> 00:40:37,992
You know, there's that big, dual
carriageway when you get off the train?

514
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:40,329
It mightn't have been here when you
were here last, Harry.

515
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:43,367
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

516
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:47,304
and he saw the canals and the bridges and,
you know, the swans and that,

517
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,306
well, he just
fucking loved it then.

518
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,905
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town.

519
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:57,610
It was just that initial, dual carriageway
thing sort of put him off for a second.

520
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,378
<i>Don't know if I remember
a dual carriageway.</i>

521
00:40:59,478 --> 00:41:00,780
<i>Must be recent.</i>

522
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,215
<i>Hasn't spoilt it, has it?</i>

523
00:41:02,315 --> 00:41:05,565
No, no, no, it's just that
initial thing.

524
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,733
And you know what?

525
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:13,090
As we were walking
through the streets,

526
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:18,340
there was this sort of freezing fog
hanging over everything,

527
00:41:18,782 --> 00:41:22,565
and it made it look almost like
a fairytale or something.

528
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:24,164
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

529
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:25,800
<i>What'd he say?</i>

530
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,903
He said, 'Ken, I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream.'

531
00:41:31,003 --> 00:41:33,342
<i>Yeah? He said that?</i>

532
00:41:33,443 --> 00:41:34,440
Yeah.

533
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:37,077
<i>Meaning, like,
in a good dream?</i>

534
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:40,016
Yeah. Of course,
like in a good dream.

535
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:43,485
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad
he likes it there.</i>

536
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,521
<i>I'm glad we were able
to give him something.</i>

537
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:49,438
<i>Something good and happy. Because he
wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

538
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:51,969
Huh?

539
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,610
<i>He wasn't a bad kid,
was he?</i>

540
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:58,728
<i>Listen, take down this address.
Raamstraat 17.</i>

541
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:01,876
<i>That's 'Raam,' like 'Ram,'
but with an extra 'a'</i>

542
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,932
Raamstraat 17.

543
00:42:04,032 --> 00:42:05,612
<i>You got that?</i>

544
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,407
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

545
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:11,708
<i>Good. There'll be a man there tomorrow
morning at 9:00, his name's Yuri.</i>

546
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,476
<i>- Yuri.
- He'll give you the gun.</i>

547
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:15,447
<i>Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's</i>

548
00:42:15,547 --> 00:42:18,364
<i>about 3:00 or 4:00 tomorrow,
after it's done.</i>

549
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,994
After what's done?

550
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:23,465
<i>Are you being thick?</i>

551
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:26,855
<i>- No.
- Listen, I like Ray.</i>

552
00:42:26,954 --> 00:42:29,326
<i>He was a good bloke, but when it
all comes down to it, you know,</i>

553
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:32,490
<i>he blew the head off a little
fucking kid. And you brought him in, Ken.</i>

554
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:36,036
<i>So if the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?</i>

555
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:42,612
<i>Ken?</i>

556
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:46,139
<i>If the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?</i>

557
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:48,204
It stops with me, Harry.
That's an easy one.

558
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,420
<i>Look, don't get shirty, Ken.</i>

559
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:56,248
<i>Listen, I'm just glad that I was able
to do something for the boy before he went.</i>

560
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:57,947
Do what for the boy?

561
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:00,467
<i>You know, have him
get to see Bruges.</i>

562
00:43:01,304 --> 00:43:04,467
<i>I'd like to go to see
Bruges again before I die.</i>

563
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,768
<i>What was it he said again about
Yeah, 'It's like a dream'</i>

564
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:13,809
'I know I'm awake, but I feel like
I'm in a dream.'

565
00:43:16,282 --> 00:43:17,375
<i>Yeah.</i>

566
00:43:19,253 --> 00:43:21,550
<i>Give me a call
when he's dead.</i>

567
00:43:45,643 --> 00:43:49,028
That's my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole.

568
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:50,327
Eirik, what are you doing?

569
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,163
Where are you from, fucker?

570
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,715
Ireland, originally.

571
00:43:54,516 --> 00:43:56,766
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium

572
00:43:56,865 --> 00:43:58,601
and fuck another man's girl?

573
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:00,503
Look, I didn't know she had
a boyfriend, all right?

574
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:03,541
And I haven't fucked her, anyway.
Ask her. I'd only put me hand on it.

575
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,592
Eirik, put the gun down!

576
00:44:06,793 --> 00:44:09,213
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

577
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,842
Don't start being silly.

578
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:12,693
Get down on your

579
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,181
Exactly at what point was it that
all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

580
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:18,416
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,

581
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:20,753
you just went around beating up
Pakistani 12-year-olds.

582
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:24,137
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

583
00:44:25,677 --> 00:44:26,858
That's not gonna help you, man.

584
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,708
Ray, there's only
blanks in that gun.

585
00:44:36,286 --> 00:44:38,070
Eirik, don't!

586
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,436
Now who's the fucking bum-boy?

587
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:41,751
You, you fucking bum-boy!

588
00:44:43,927 --> 00:44:45,742
Chloe, what exactly
is going on here?

589
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:47,976
I can't see!
I can't see!

590
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:52,449
Of course you can't fucking see! I just shot
a blank in your fucking eyes!

591
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:57,454
- Is this fella your boyfriend?
- No. I mean, he used to be.

592
00:44:57,554 --> 00:44:58,686
Well, what's he doing here?

593
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:02,192
We... We rob tourists, sometimes.

594
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,210
I fucking knew it was too good
to be true!

595
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,327
I knew you'd have never
shagged me, normally.

596
00:45:07,427 --> 00:45:09,628
No! That's not true, I...

597
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:13,067
I called it off tonight.
I told him not to come tonight.

598
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,266
Why did you come tonight?

599
00:45:14,364 --> 00:45:16,034
Chloe, I can't see,
I swear it!

600
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:18,601
Stop whingeing
like a big gay baby.

601
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:20,235
I haven't had a shag in months!

602
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:25,306
I can't see out of this eye, Chloe!
I have to go to the hospital!

603
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:27,110
I'll drive you.

604
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,945
Great! Now the whole
night's ruined!

605
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:30,280
No!

606
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,313
You can stay if you want. I just
don't know how long I'll be.

607
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:37,255
I just knew someone like you
would never like someone like me.

608
00:45:37,355 --> 00:45:40,088
- I just knew.
- What do you mean, someone like me?

609
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:42,143
You know, someone nice.

610
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:51,507
Call me. Please.

611
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:58,052
Chloe!

612
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:39,014
Cha-ching!

613
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:10,268
Have you got some
sort of problem?

614
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,804
No, no problem.

615
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:14,617
Four beers in 20 minutes.
No problem.

616
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:17,820
Fuck off.

617
00:47:25,934 --> 00:47:28,048
Beer and a red wine.

618
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,601
I'll be back.

619
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:33,956
How's the movie going?

620
00:47:34,056 --> 00:47:38,192
It's a jumped-up Eurotrash piece of
rip-off fucking bullshit.

621
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,211
Like, in a bad way?

622
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:45,398
Your girlfriend's
very pretty.

623
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:49,284
She ain't my girlfriend.
She's a prostitute I just picked up.

624
00:47:51,356 --> 00:47:53,836
Didn't know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges.

625
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,309
You just have to look
in the right places.

626
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:58,054
Brothels are good.

627
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:02,577
Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

628
00:48:02,677 --> 00:48:04,030
Thank you.

629
00:48:08,505 --> 00:48:10,266
You from the States?

630
00:48:11,106 --> 00:48:12,233
Yeah.

631
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:14,059
But don't hold it against me.

632
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,507
I'll try not to.

633
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,070
Just try not to say
anything too loud or crass.

634
00:48:37,797 --> 00:48:40,146
Hey-ho. Drowning
your sorrows, huh?

635
00:48:40,246 --> 00:48:43,949
What sorrows?
You know, being a sad, old, ugly little man.

636
00:48:44,048 --> 00:48:45,215
One gay beer, please.

637
00:48:45,315 --> 00:48:46,416
How'd your date go?

638
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:48,721
My date involved two instances of
extreme violence.

639
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,820
One instance of her hand on my cock
and my finger up her thing,

640
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,793
which lasted all too briefly.
Isn't that always the way?

641
00:48:53,893 --> 00:48:57,262
One instance of me stealing five grams of
her very-high-quality cocaine,

642
00:48:57,362 --> 00:48:59,494
and one instance of me
blinding a poofy little skinhead.

643
00:48:59,594 --> 00:49:02,764
So, all in all, my evening
pretty much balanced out fine.

644
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:04,943
You got five grams of coke?

645
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:07,402
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

646
00:49:07,503 --> 00:49:08,771
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

647
00:49:08,871 --> 00:49:10,070
as if I'm about to
have a heart attack.

648
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,340
So if I collapse any minute now,
please remember to tell the doctors

649
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,041
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

650
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:15,545
Give us a gram, then.

651
00:49:15,644 --> 00:49:17,581
I thought you were laying off,
because it makes you depressed?

652
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:21,063
You know what? Right now,
I don't really give a fuck.

653
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:52,373
Why didn't you wave hello to me
today when I waved hello to you today?

654
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:55,007
I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today.

655
00:49:55,108 --> 00:49:59,998
I wasn't waving hello to anybody,
except maybe to a horse.

656
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:02,885
Huh? What are you
talking about?

657
00:50:02,985 --> 00:50:05,028
Just horseshit.

658
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,755
You from America?

659
00:50:07,855 --> 00:50:10,387
Yeah. But don't
hold it against me.

660
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:13,394
Well, that's for me
to decide, isn't it?

661
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:14,896
Are you from America, too?

662
00:50:14,996 --> 00:50:16,492
No, I'm from Amsterdam.

663
00:50:16,592 --> 00:50:17,965
Amsterdam.

664
00:50:18,065 --> 00:50:20,867
Amsterdam is just a load of bloody
prostitutes, isn't it?

665
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,931
Yes. That's why I came to Bruges.

666
00:50:23,032 --> 00:50:26,284
I thought I'd get
a better price for my pussy here.

667
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,047
Huh?

668
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:32,320
You two are weird.

669
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,557
Would you like some cocaine?

670
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:41,898
I've also got some
acid and some ecstasy.

671
00:50:52,746 --> 00:50:55,226
Herve Villechaize, I know, did.

672
00:50:55,326 --> 00:50:58,079
<i>The dwarf off, I think,
The Time Bandits, did.</i>

673
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:00,978
Lots of midgets:

674
00:51:01,554 --> 00:51:04,079
Dwarves, top themselves.

675
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,286
Hmm. Shitloads.

676
00:51:09,128 --> 00:51:10,492
Would you ever think about it?

677
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:11,918
Huh?

678
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:15,614
Would you ever think about killing
yourself because you're a midget?

679
00:51:15,715 --> 00:51:18,748
Fuck, man!
What kind of question is that?

680
00:51:18,847 --> 00:51:20,393
We're just chatting,
aren't we?

681
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:30,190
See, Ken, this is the kind of hotel
Harry should have put us in.

682
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:32,713
A five-star,
with prostitutes in.

683
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:37,978
You know, sometimes, I think Harry
doesn't even give a shit about us at all.

684
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:41,420
Has he still not called?

685
00:51:43,224 --> 00:51:44,838
No. Still hasn't called.

686
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,516
No news is good news, eh?

687
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,889
Hmm.

688
00:51:58,103 --> 00:51:59,432
Who's she?

689
00:52:01,306 --> 00:52:03,432
There's gonna be a war, man.

690
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:05,625
I can see it.

691
00:52:05,724 --> 00:52:09,690
There's gonna be a war between the
blacks and between the whites.

692
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:12,231
You ain't even gonna need
a uniform no more.

693
00:52:12,331 --> 00:52:14,963
This ain't gonna be a war
where you pick your side.

694
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:16,467
Your side's already
picked for you.

695
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:19,565
And I know whose side I'm fighting on.
I'm fighting with the blacks.

696
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:21,302
The whites are gonna get
their heads kicked in!

697
00:52:21,402 --> 00:52:23,606
You don't decide
this shit, man.

698
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:25,576
Well, who are the half-castes
gonna fight with?

699
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,309
The blacks, man.
That's obvious.

700
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:30,829
But what about the Pakistanis?

701
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,527
The blacks.
What about...

702
00:52:35,536 --> 00:52:37,059
Think of a hard one.

703
00:52:38,038 --> 00:52:40,085
What about the Vietnamese?

704
00:52:40,184 --> 00:52:41,623
The blacks!

705
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:46,269
Well, I'm definitely fighting with
the blacks if they've got the Vietnamese.

706
00:52:50,382 --> 00:52:51,780
So, hang on.

707
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:54,431
Would all of the white midgets in
the world be fighting

708
00:52:54,532 --> 00:52:55,936
against all the black
midgets in the world?

709
00:52:56,036 --> 00:52:57,782
Yeah.

710
00:52:58,489 --> 00:53:00,614
That would make a good film!

711
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,224
You don't know how much shit I've had
to take off of black midgets, man.

712
00:53:06,762 --> 00:53:08,059
That's...

713
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:11,380
Undeniably true.

714
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:12,934
See, Jimmy,

715
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:16,096
my wife was black.

716
00:53:17,704 --> 00:53:19,728
And I loved her very much.

717
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,835
And in 1976, she was murdered
by a white man.

718
00:53:27,547 --> 00:53:31,710
So, where the fuck am I supposed
to stand in all this blood and carnage?

719
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:35,650
Did they get the guy who did it?

720
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,168
A friend of mine got him.

721
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:39,280
Harry Waters got him.

722
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:45,693
So tell me, Jim, whose side do I fight
on in this wonderful war?

723
00:53:48,766 --> 00:53:51,826
I think you need to
weigh up all your options

724
00:53:52,936 --> 00:53:55,460
and let your conscience decide, Ken.

725
00:54:04,713 --> 00:54:08,809
Two manky hookers
and a racist dwarf.

726
00:54:09,351 --> 00:54:10,496
I think I'm heading home.

727
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:13,018
Yeah. I think I'll come with you.

728
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:17,835
What's...
Back off, shorty!

729
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:19,807
You don't know karate.

730
00:54:19,907 --> 00:54:20,869
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

731
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,755
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

732
00:54:23,061 --> 00:54:24,391
Short arse!

733
00:55:50,905 --> 00:55:52,085
Meeting Yuri.

734
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,264
Yes, I'm Yuri.

735
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:25,628
Mr. Waters said
that might be necessary.

736
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:32,329
There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

737
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:35,436
You use this word,
'alcoves'?

738
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:38,460
'Alcoves'? Yes. Sometimes.

739
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:42,710
There are not many people around
in these alcoves in Christmastime.

740
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:46,583
If I were to murder a man,
I would murder him here.

741
00:56:49,356 --> 00:56:52,275
Are you sure this is
the right word, 'alcoves'?

742
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:56,007
'Alcoves,' yes.
It's kind of like 'nooks and crannies.'

743
00:56:56,108 --> 00:57:00,177
'Nooks and crannies,' yes.
Perhaps this would be more accurate.

744
00:57:00,277 --> 00:57:03,666
'Nooks and crannies,'
rather than 'alcoves.' Yeah.

745
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:14,427
You are going to do it, aren't you?
Mr. Waters will be very disappointed...

746
00:57:14,527 --> 00:57:17,103
Of course I'm going to fucking do it.

747
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:20,204
It's what I do.

748
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:29,751
Your friend was behaving
rather oddly this morning.

749
00:57:37,231 --> 00:57:38,744
Oddly? How?

750
00:57:38,844 --> 00:57:42,961
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

751
00:57:43,802 --> 00:57:47,188
I said I didn't mind as long as
it's healthy, of course.

752
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:51,606
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

753
00:57:53,112 --> 00:57:58,014
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

754
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:02,909
Would you give it back to him
when you see him?

755
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:07,668
I don't want to appear ungrateful, but it
seemed like all the money he had.

756
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:11,748
- Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park.

757
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:12,710
Sorry, Ray.

758
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:15,978
I'm sorry.

759
00:59:46,677 --> 00:59:47,858
Ray, don't!

760
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:50,525
Fucking hell!
Where the fuck did you come from?

761
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:53,594
- I was behind the thing.
- What the fuck are you doing, Ray?

762
00:59:53,693 --> 00:59:55,161
What the fuck are you doing?

763
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,295
Nothing.

764
00:59:58,519 --> 00:59:59,918
Oh, my God!

765
01:00:01,956 --> 01:00:04,516
- You were gonna kill me.
- No, I wasn't.

766
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:07,186
You were gonna kill yourself!

767
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:11,246
I'm allowed to.

768
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:12,344
No, you're not!

769
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:13,557
What?

770
01:00:14,132 --> 01:00:17,067
I'm not allowed to and you are?
How's that fair?

771
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:27,405
Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

772
01:00:30,614 --> 01:00:32,795
I wasn't gonna go
through with it, Ray.

773
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:36,943
You fucking looked like you were
gonna go fucking through with it.

774
01:00:38,989 --> 01:00:40,670
Where'd you get that gun?

775
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:42,335
A friend of Harry's.

776
01:00:42,436 --> 01:00:43,755
Fuck, man.

777
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:47,885
Let me see it.

778
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,389
Silencer, too.

779
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:57,027
Nice.

780
01:01:02,608 --> 01:01:04,905
Mine's a bloody girl's gun.

781
01:01:14,052 --> 01:01:16,541
I'm keeping it.
Pardon me?

782
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:21,070
Give me me gun back.
You're not getting it back.

783
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,271
You're a suicide case.

784
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:25,074
And you were trying to shoot me
in the fucking head.

785
01:01:25,175 --> 01:01:26,708
You're not getting
that gun back.

786
01:01:26,807 --> 01:01:29,612
A great day this has
turned out to be.

787
01:01:29,713 --> 01:01:32,666
I'm suicidal,
me mate tries to kill me,

788
01:01:32,768 --> 01:01:36,362
me gun gets nicked
and we're still in fucking Bruges.

789
01:01:37,672 --> 01:01:41,958
Listen, I'm gonna give you some money
and put you on a train somewhere.

790
01:01:42,057 --> 01:01:43,393
Back to England?

791
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:46,492
You can't go back to England, Ray.
You'd be a dead man!

792
01:01:46,592 --> 01:01:48,628
I want to be a dead man.

793
01:01:48,728 --> 01:01:50,376
Have you been missing something?

794
01:01:52,085 --> 01:01:54,382
You don't want to be
a dead man, Ray.

795
01:01:57,222 --> 01:01:59,086
I killed a little boy!

796
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,398
Then save the next little boy.

797
01:02:16,871 --> 01:02:18,896
Just go away somewhere,

798
01:02:19,641 --> 01:02:23,077
get out of this business
and try to do something good.

799
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:26,670
You're not gonna
help anybody dead.

800
01:02:27,248 --> 01:02:29,840
You're not gonna
bring that boy back.

801
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:34,284
But you might save the next one.

802
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:38,018
What am I gonna be, a doctor?

803
01:02:38,726 --> 01:02:40,282
You need exams.

804
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:43,722
Do anything, Ray.
Do anything.

805
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:01,266
What a wanker!

806
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,271
He said this whole trip,

807
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,750
this whole being in Bruges thing,

808
01:03:10,518 --> 01:03:14,318
was just to give you one last,
joyful memory before you died.

809
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:17,155
In Bruges?

810
01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:24,592
The Bahamas, maybe.

811
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:28,295
Why fucking Bruges?

812
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:30,902
I suppose it's cheaper.

813
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,202
The rest of the acid
and the ecstasy.

814
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,577
Can I have me gun back, please?

815
01:03:48,586 --> 01:03:50,554
What am I gonna do, Ken?

816
01:03:51,655 --> 01:03:54,318
- What am I gonna do?
- Just keep moving.

817
01:03:55,425 --> 01:03:57,342
Keep on moving.

818
01:03:57,443 --> 01:03:59,485
Try not to think about it.

819
01:04:00,762 --> 01:04:02,179
Learn a new language, maybe?

820
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,244
Sure, I can hardly do English.

821
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:05,547
That's one thing
I like about Europe, though.

822
01:04:05,648 --> 01:04:07,715
You don't have to learn
any of their languages.

823
01:04:07,815 --> 01:04:10,485
Just forget about home for a while.

824
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:14,018
See how the land lies
in six years, seven years.

825
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:16,302
Seven years is not that long.

826
01:04:16,976 --> 01:04:19,057
It's longer than that boy got.

827
01:04:19,157 --> 01:04:21,635
Me first fucking job.

828
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:25,313
Great hitman I turned out to be.

829
01:04:29,155 --> 01:04:32,088
Some people just aren't
cut out for it, Ray.

830
01:04:32,724 --> 01:04:33,952
Are you?

831
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:42,755
When are you
going back to England?

832
01:04:43,534 --> 01:04:45,581
I'll head back in a couple
of hours or something.

833
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:49,297
Harry's not gonna be mad at you,
is he? For letting me go?

834
01:04:49,938 --> 01:04:50,952
I'll sort out Harry.

835
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:54,224
Just tell him I'll have probably
killed meself in a fortnight, anyway.

836
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:56,300
You won't, will you, Ray?

837
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,146
Harry? It's Ken.

838
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:19,820
Listen to this noise.

839
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:24,416
Do you know what that is?

840
01:05:24,516 --> 01:05:28,389
Yeah, I know you know it's a train.
Do you know what train?

841
01:05:28,489 --> 01:05:31,858
Well, it's a train that Ray just
got on, and he's alive and he's well,

842
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:34,327
and he doesn't know where he's going
and neither do I.

843
01:05:34,427 --> 01:05:37,228
So if you need to do your worst,
do your worst.

844
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:40,530
You've got the address of the hotel.
I'll be here waiting.

845
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:43,664
Because I've got to quite
like Bruges, now.

846
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:45,744
It's like a fucking
fairytale or something.

847
01:06:15,413 --> 01:06:16,606
Harry.

848
01:06:17,414 --> 01:06:18,574
Harry!

849
01:06:19,115 --> 01:06:20,195
What?

850
01:06:20,295 --> 01:06:22,331
It's an inanimate fucking object.

851
01:06:22,431 --> 01:06:24,909
You're an inanimate fucking object!

852
01:06:35,097 --> 01:06:37,847
Now, you lot be good for your mummy
and Imamoto, okay?

853
01:06:37,947 --> 01:06:39,911
'Cause Daddy's got to
go away for a few days.

854
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:40,980
Where are you going?

855
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:42,648
I've got to go to Bruges.

856
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,317
Bruges? Where's that?

857
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:45,463
It's in Belgium.

858
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,226
Why would anybody
have to go to Belgium?

859
01:06:49,326 --> 01:06:51,992
'Cause I've got to
sort something out.

860
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,496
Is it something
to do with the phone?

861
01:06:54,596 --> 01:06:56,342
It's something to do with Ken.

862
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,880
It's a matter of honor.

863
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:03,815
Well, it ain't gonna
be dangerous, is it?

864
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:10,041
Well, of course it's gonna be dangerous
if it's a matter of fucking honor!

865
01:07:10,141 --> 01:07:11,606
You are bringing the fellas with you?

866
01:07:11,706 --> 01:07:14,561
Tell me you're bringing
the fellas with you.

867
01:07:15,063 --> 01:07:16,326
Harry.

868
01:07:16,965 --> 01:07:19,782
I'm sorry for calling you
an inanimate object.

869
01:07:19,882 --> 01:07:21,266
I was upset.

870
01:09:01,122 --> 01:09:03,591
You're Irish?
Yes.

871
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,720
What is your name?

872
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,988
Derek Perlurrl.

873
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:16,596
You hit the Canadian.

874
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,121
You hit the Canadian.

875
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:23,163
I 'heet' the Canadian?
I don't know what you're talking about.

876
01:09:25,877 --> 01:09:28,403
That's him!
That's the motherfucker.

877
01:09:34,685 --> 01:09:36,779
You hit the Canadian, yeah?

878
01:09:37,788 --> 01:09:39,948
Canadian? Shit.

879
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:49,430
- We're taking you back to Bruges.
- Brilliant.

880
01:10:17,055 --> 01:10:18,283
Aye aye.

881
01:10:19,356 --> 01:10:21,449
Take your pick, Mr. Waters.

882
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:26,680
An Uzi?

883
01:10:26,779 --> 01:10:29,614
I'm not from South Central
Los fucking Angeles.

884
01:10:29,715 --> 01:10:33,417
I didn't come here to shoot 20 black
10-year-olds in a fucking drive-by.

885
01:10:33,516 --> 01:10:36,233
I want a normal gun
for a normal person.

886
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:50,166
I knew he wouldn't kill the guy.

887
01:10:50,265 --> 01:10:54,413
I could see it in his eyes when I was
telling him about the alcoves.

888
01:10:55,622 --> 01:10:57,203
- About the what?
- The alcoves.

889
01:10:57,302 --> 01:11:00,054
The alcoves in the
Koningin Astrid Park.

890
01:11:02,694 --> 01:11:04,911
Oh, I also have some dumdums.

891
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:08,444
You use this word,'dumdums'?
The bullets that make the head explode?

892
01:11:08,545 --> 01:11:09,882
Dumdums, yeah.

893
01:11:09,983 --> 01:11:12,561
Would you like some
of these dumdums?

894
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,832
I know I shouldn't,

895
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:17,837
but I will.

896
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,311
Motherfucker.

897
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:26,627
Is he talking to me?

898
01:11:26,728 --> 01:11:28,863
No, Eirik's on your side,
Mr. Waters.

899
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:30,963
Your young friend
blinded him last night.

900
01:11:31,064 --> 01:11:32,099
Ray did?

901
01:11:32,198 --> 01:11:35,485
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me.

902
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:39,109
And the gun
was full of blanks,

903
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,819
and he shot the blank
into my eye.

904
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:46,490
And now, I cannot see from this eye
ever again, the doctors say.

905
01:11:47,201 --> 01:11:50,518
Well, to be honest, it sounds like
it was all your fault.

906
01:11:50,618 --> 01:11:51,615
What?

907
01:11:51,716 --> 01:11:54,488
I mean, basically, if you're robbing
a man and you're only carrying blanks,

908
01:11:54,587 --> 01:11:56,490
and you allow your gun
to be taken off you,

909
01:11:56,591 --> 01:11:58,791
and you allow yourself to be shot
in the eye with a blank,

910
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:02,425
for which I assume the person has to get
quite close to you, then,

911
01:12:02,524 --> 01:12:05,764
yeah, really, it's all your fault
for being such a poof.

912
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:08,769
So why don't you stop whingeing
and cheer the fuck up?

913
01:12:08,868 --> 01:12:11,412
Eirik, I really wouldn't respond.

914
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,740
I thought you wanted the guy dead?

915
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:21,943
I do want the guy dead.
I want him fucking crucified.

916
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:25,314
But it don't change the fact
that he stitched you up like a blind, little gay boy.

917
01:12:25,414 --> 01:12:26,423
Does it?

918
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:30,359
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

919
01:13:36,863 --> 01:13:37,954
Well?

920
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:42,015
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

921
01:13:42,115 --> 01:13:44,091
He's a walking dead man.

922
01:13:44,936 --> 01:13:46,917
Keeps going on
about Hell and purgatory:

923
01:13:47,016 --> 01:13:49,389
When I phoned you
yesterday, did I ask you,

924
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:53,021
'Ken, will you do me a favor and
become Ray's psychiatrist, please?'

925
01:13:53,122 --> 01:13:57,591
No. What I think I asked you was,
'Could you go blow his fucking head off for me?'

926
01:13:57,692 --> 01:13:59,659
'He's suicidal'?

927
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,229
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

928
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:05,501
We don't all keep
going on about it!

929
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,939
Has he killed himself yet?
No. So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?

930
01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:12,408
He put a loaded gun to his head this morning.
I stopped him.

931
01:14:12,509 --> 01:14:15,016
He...What?
This gets fucking worse!

932
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:17,009
We were down in the park...

933
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:21,043
Let me get this right.
You were down in the park?

934
01:14:21,144 --> 01:14:23,247
What's that got to do
with fucking anything?

935
01:14:23,347 --> 01:14:26,188
Let me get this right. Not only
have you refused to kill the boy,

936
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:28,453
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

937
01:14:28,554 --> 01:14:29,787
which would have
solved my problem,

938
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,122
which would have
solved your problem,

939
01:14:31,222 --> 01:14:33,094
which sounds like
it would've solved the boy's problem.

940
01:14:33,194 --> 01:14:34,792
It wouldn't have
solved his problem.

941
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:38,828
Ken, if I had killed a little kid,
accidentally or otherwise,

942
01:14:38,927 --> 01:14:40,131
I wouldn't have thought twice.

943
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,730
I'd have killed myself on the
fucking spot. On the fucking spot.

944
01:14:42,831 --> 01:14:45,469
I'd have stuck the gun in me mouth
on the fucking spot!

945
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:49,171
That's you, Harry.
The boy has the capacity to change.

946
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:51,710
The boy has the capacity to do
something decent with his life.

947
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:55,229
Excuse me, Ken.
I have the capacity to change.

948
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:59,557
Yeah, you do. You've the capacity
to get fucking worse!

949
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:02,648
Yeah, now I'm
getting down to it!

950
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:04,621
Harry, let's face it.

951
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,387
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

952
01:15:07,488 --> 01:15:08,891
but you're a cunt.

953
01:15:08,992 --> 01:15:11,792
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt.

954
01:15:11,893 --> 01:15:15,595
And the only thing that's gonna change is you're gonna
become an even bigger cunt.

955
01:15:15,694 --> 01:15:17,159
Maybe have some
more cunt kids.

956
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,329
Leave my kids fucking out of it.
What have they done?

957
01:15:19,429 --> 01:15:21,835
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

958
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:24,168
I retract that bit about
your cunt fucking kids.

959
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:27,939
Insulting my fucking kids!
That's going overboard, mate!

960
01:15:28,038 --> 01:15:30,015
I retracted it, didn't I?

961
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,243
Still leaves you being a cunt.

962
01:15:34,342 --> 01:15:36,890
Yeah, I fucking got that.

963
01:15:55,448 --> 01:15:57,076
Where's Ray now?

964
01:15:58,385 --> 01:16:01,033
Oh, right about now,
Ray is in one or other

965
01:16:01,132 --> 01:16:06,682
of the one million towns in
mainland Europe it's possible to be in, other than here.

966
01:16:20,603 --> 01:16:23,021
I'll get all the money back to you soon as I
get through to me friend.

967
01:16:23,122 --> 01:16:24,685
It's not a problem,
Raymond.

968
01:16:24,786 --> 01:16:27,422
And I'll get all your acid and
your ecstasy back to you, too.

969
01:16:27,523 --> 01:16:29,023
English humor!

970
01:16:29,122 --> 01:16:31,841
I'm assuming you've
got your gun on you.

971
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:37,002
That Yuri bloke's
a funny fella, isn't he?

972
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:38,246
He does yoga.

973
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:40,835
'The alcoves.'

974
01:16:40,935 --> 01:16:43,253
Was he going on
to you about the alcoves?

975
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:47,458
'The alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.'

976
01:16:55,868 --> 01:16:59,347
Harry, I know you gotta do
what you gotta do.

977
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,287
It's a bit crowded
round here, you know?

978
01:17:01,386 --> 01:17:02,654
Well, I'm not gonna
have a shootout

979
01:17:02,755 --> 01:17:05,230
in the middle of a thousand
fucking Belgians, am I?

980
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:10,859
Not to mention the other
nationalities, just on their holidays.

981
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:11,936
Hmm.

982
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:15,533
To see the swans and the Gothic
and all the fairytale stuff, eh?

983
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:18,970
- Are you trying to fucking wind me up?
- No, Harry.

984
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:21,439
On top of calling me a cunt
and calling me kids cunts.

985
01:17:21,538 --> 01:17:24,475
I might just have to
fucking shoot you right here.

986
01:17:24,576 --> 01:17:25,787
Christ!

987
01:17:29,131 --> 01:17:31,189
Let's go up the bell tower.

988
01:17:32,265 --> 01:17:34,448
Be quiet up there
this time of evening.

989
01:17:34,547 --> 01:17:36,195
Let's go up there.

990
01:17:54,985 --> 01:17:57,613
Yeah. Canadians.

991
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:01,604
I feel a bit bad. They didn't kill
John Lennon, did they?

992
01:18:01,704 --> 01:18:04,143
Anyway, supposed to turn up
to court here in two days.

993
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:05,239
Are you going to turn up?

994
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,341
Don't know.

995
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,658
What have I got to
stay for really?

996
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,728
The most beautiful woman

997
01:18:15,435 --> 01:18:17,063
you've ever seen

998
01:18:18,405 --> 01:18:20,497
in all of your stupid life.

999
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:32,967
The tower is closed this evening.

1000
01:18:33,068 --> 01:18:35,234
No way. It's supposed
to be open till 7:00.

1001
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,402
The tower is usually
open until 7:00.

1002
01:18:37,502 --> 01:18:40,206
Yesterday an American
had a heart attack up the tower.

1003
01:18:40,305 --> 01:18:41,676
Today the tower is closed.

1004
01:18:41,775 --> 01:18:45,752
Here, cranky, here's 100 for you.
We're only gonna be 20 minutes.

1005
01:18:50,967 --> 01:18:57,052
The tower is closed this evening.

1006
01:18:57,153 --> 01:18:59,470
Understand, Englishman?

1007
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:40,755
Jimmy, I've been wanting to say

1008
01:19:40,854 --> 01:19:44,095
I'm really sorry for
karate-chopping you the other night.

1009
01:19:44,194 --> 01:19:46,532
That was way out of order.

1010
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:51,233
You know, Ray, I'd find it easier
to believe and forgive you, somehow,

1011
01:19:51,332 --> 01:19:56,404
if the two of you weren't
laughing straight in my fucking face!

1012
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,457
It's for the goddamn movie, man.

1013
01:20:05,099 --> 01:20:07,123
It is a nice town, Harry.

1014
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:10,759
I'm glad I got to see it.

1015
01:20:14,972 --> 01:20:19,090
I didn't mean to be taking the
piss out of it being a fairytale place.

1016
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:21,006
It is a fairytale place.

1017
01:20:21,746 --> 01:20:23,440
- It really is.
- Hmm.

1018
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,328
It's just a shame
it's in Belgium, really.

1019
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:28,768
But then you figure if it wasn't
in Belgium, if it was somewhere good,

1020
01:20:28,868 --> 01:20:32,981
there'd be too many people coming to
see it. It would spoil the whole thing.

1021
01:20:35,024 --> 01:20:37,255
Well, I'm glad I got to see it

1022
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:40,585
before I died.

1023
01:20:47,737 --> 01:20:49,465
What are you doing?

1024
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,889
What are you fucking doing?

1025
01:20:51,988 --> 01:20:53,804
I'm not fighting anymore, Harry.

1026
01:20:54,742 --> 01:20:57,939
All right, then I'm blowing
your fucking head off.

1027
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:03,270
Don't come over all Gandhi.
What are you fucking doing?

1028
01:21:05,284 --> 01:21:06,932
Ken, stop messing about, please.

1029
01:21:07,033 --> 01:21:09,067
Pick up your gun. I know I'm going
to beat you anyway

1030
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:11,782
'cause you're a spaz, but...
Harry,

1031
01:21:13,324 --> 01:21:15,349
I'm totally in your debt.

1032
01:21:18,296 --> 01:21:21,422
The things that have
gone between us in the past,

1033
01:21:22,131 --> 01:21:23,914
I love you unreservedly
for all that.

1034
01:21:24,015 --> 01:21:25,159
What?

1035
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:27,864
For your integrity.

1036
01:21:28,838 --> 01:21:30,395
For your honor.

1037
01:21:31,306 --> 01:21:32,706
I love you.

1038
01:21:35,144 --> 01:21:37,510
The boy had to be let go.

1039
01:21:39,913 --> 01:21:42,314
The boy had to be given a chance.

1040
01:21:42,817 --> 01:21:48,266
And if to do that, I had to say,
'Fuck you, and fuck what I owe you,

1041
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:53,087
'and fuck everything that's gone on
between us,' then that's what I had to do.

1042
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,550
But I'm not fighting you.

1043
01:21:57,095 --> 01:21:59,176
And I accept, totally,
everything you've got to do.

1044
01:21:59,277 --> 01:22:01,095
I accept it. Totally.

1045
01:22:04,935 --> 01:22:06,198
Oh, yeah?

1046
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:09,596
Yeah.

1047
01:22:14,644 --> 01:22:19,239
Well, you say all that fucking stuff,
I can't fucking shoot you now, can I?

1048
01:22:20,615 --> 01:22:23,095
It's entirely up to you, Harry.

1049
01:22:23,195 --> 01:22:25,176
It's entirely your call.

1050
01:22:26,755 --> 01:22:29,587
All I'm saying is
I'm not fighting.

1051
01:22:36,997 --> 01:22:38,578
Oh, you fucking cunt!

1052
01:22:38,677 --> 01:22:39,880
Look, I'm not gonna
do nothing to you

1053
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:43,765
just 'cause you're standing about
like Robert fucking Powell.

1054
01:22:44,604 --> 01:22:46,286
- Like who?
- Like Robert fucking Powell

1055
01:22:46,386 --> 01:22:48,189
<i>out of Jesus of
fucking Nazareth!</i>

1056
01:22:48,289 --> 01:22:49,434
My fucking leg!

1057
01:22:50,009 --> 01:22:53,957
The psycho dwarf turns out to just be
a loveable little schoolboy,

1058
01:22:54,056 --> 01:22:56,559
and it's all some kind of
Boschian nightmare.

1059
01:22:56,658 --> 01:22:58,127
Kiss my ass!

1060
01:22:58,226 --> 01:23:02,378
I guess at least there weren't any
black people involved, eh, Jimmy?

1061
01:23:03,654 --> 01:23:05,019
I wasn't...

1062
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:07,881
I wasn't talking about...

1063
01:23:09,059 --> 01:23:12,073
There's gonna be a war between
all the blacks and all the whites.

1064
01:23:12,172 --> 01:23:13,944
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

1065
01:23:14,043 --> 01:23:16,176
which would actually
be really good.

1066
01:23:16,277 --> 01:23:18,012
That's just cocaine.

1067
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:20,516
He didn't even want
the Vietnamese on his side!

1068
01:23:20,617 --> 01:23:22,728
That's just cocaine.

1069
01:23:23,703 --> 01:23:27,387
Listen, we're filming down
by the pointy building tonight.

1070
01:23:27,488 --> 01:23:29,963
It might actually be good for once.

1071
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:33,391
You guys should come along.

1072
01:23:33,492 --> 01:23:38,212
We...I think we're just gonna have
a quiet one tonight, Jimmy.

1073
01:23:40,217 --> 01:23:41,878
That's how it is!

1074
01:23:43,889 --> 01:23:45,480
In another life.

1075
01:23:52,296 --> 01:23:54,387
They're great,
aren't they?

1076
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:12,034
You didn't. You didn't!

1077
01:25:00,755 --> 01:25:03,246
Mr. Waters? Mr. Waters?

1078
01:25:05,725 --> 01:25:08,216
- Who's that?
- It's Eirik.

1079
01:25:09,695 --> 01:25:11,630
- The blind boy?
- Yeah.

1080
01:25:13,132 --> 01:25:14,292
Yes.

1081
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,449
What do you fucking want?

1082
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:19,048
The guy you're looking for,

1083
01:25:19,149 --> 01:25:22,230
the guy Ray, he's downstairs
at the bar.

1084
01:25:58,538 --> 01:26:00,095
I'm sorry, Ken.

1085
01:26:01,274 --> 01:26:04,835
But you can't kill a kid
and expect to get away with it.

1086
01:26:06,813 --> 01:26:08,337
You just can't.

1087
01:26:23,693 --> 01:26:26,309
- Where?
- To the left when you come out.

1088
01:26:26,408 --> 01:26:28,193
The bar to the left.

1089
01:29:44,868 --> 01:29:46,117
Ken!

1090
01:29:48,838 --> 01:29:50,771
Ken! Ken!

1091
01:29:52,775 --> 01:29:54,265
Harry's here.

1092
01:29:56,478 --> 01:29:57,569
What?

1093
01:29:59,046 --> 01:30:00,239
Take

1094
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:03,177
my gun.

1095
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:17,688
Ken?

1096
01:30:18,797 --> 01:30:20,320
Where's my gun?

1097
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,891
Where's my gun?

1098
01:30:26,871 --> 01:30:30,033
I'm gonna die now, I think.

1099
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,408
Oh, Ken!

1100
01:30:35,378 --> 01:30:36,538
Jesus!

1101
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:45,707
Mr. Blakely said you had left.

1102
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:47,041
I need the key
to the room right now.

1103
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:48,650
Quickly, now!

1104
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:51,710
And you gotta go home right now.
It's very, very dangerous here.

1105
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:53,287
- All right? Go home! Right now!
- Okay.

1106
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:42,220
No, I won't let you
up there! Put that gun away, right now!

1107
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,988
Lady, get out of
my fucking way, please.

1108
01:33:44,088 --> 01:33:47,170
No, I won't. I won't
get out of your way.

1109
01:33:48,046 --> 01:33:49,524
You'll have to go through me.

1110
01:33:49,623 --> 01:33:52,430
Well, obviously, I'm not gonna through you,
am I, with a baby and that?

1111
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:53,529
I'm a nice person.

1112
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,345
But could you just get out
of the fucking way, please?

1113
01:34:01,689 --> 01:34:02,850
Marie!

1114
01:34:03,826 --> 01:34:06,143
Just let him come up, it's okay.

1115
01:34:06,243 --> 01:34:09,511
Harry, swear not to start
shooting until she's left the hotel.

1116
01:34:09,612 --> 01:34:12,983
I swear not to start shooting till she's
left the hotel. I totally swear.

1117
01:34:13,082 --> 01:34:15,518
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1118
01:34:15,618 --> 01:34:17,751
This is my hotel.

1119
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:19,600
So you can fuck off!

1120
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,117
- I suppose you've got a gun up there?
- Yeah.

1121
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,037
Then what are we gonna do?
We can't stand here all night.

1122
01:34:39,137 --> 01:34:42,171
Why don't you both put your
guns down and go home?

1123
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:45,319
Don't be stupid.
This is the shootout.

1124
01:34:46,997 --> 01:34:50,078
- Harry, I've got an idea.
- What?

1125
01:34:50,177 --> 01:34:52,381
My room faces onto the canal, right?

1126
01:34:52,481 --> 01:34:55,149
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

1127
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,318
see if I can swim to the other side
and escape.

1128
01:34:57,417 --> 01:34:59,621
Right. If you go outside
and round the corner,

1129
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,057
you can shoot at me from there
and try and get me.

1130
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:04,595
That way, we leave this lady and her
baby out of the whole, entire thing.

1131
01:35:04,694 --> 01:35:06,996
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1132
01:35:07,095 --> 01:35:08,863
I don't want to run out there,
come back in 10 minutes

1133
01:35:08,963 --> 01:35:10,494
and find you fucking
hiding in a cupboard.

1134
01:35:10,595 --> 01:35:11,865
I completely promise, Harry.

1135
01:35:11,966 --> 01:35:14,269
I'm not gonna risk having another
little kid die, am I?

1136
01:35:14,368 --> 01:35:18,503
So, hang on, I go outside,
then I go which way, right or left?

1137
01:35:18,604 --> 01:35:20,039
You go right, don't you?

1138
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:23,104
You can see it from the doorway!
It's a big fucking canal!

1139
01:35:23,204 --> 01:35:26,146
All right. Jesus!
I've only just got here, haven't I?

1140
01:35:26,247 --> 01:35:29,047
Okay. On a count of
'one, two, three, go,' okay?

1141
01:35:29,148 --> 01:35:30,292
Okay.

1142
01:35:36,206 --> 01:35:37,488
What? Who says it?

1143
01:35:37,588 --> 01:35:38,957
Oh, you say it.

1144
01:35:39,057 --> 01:35:40,958
You guys are crazy.

1145
01:35:41,059 --> 01:35:42,426
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1146
01:35:42,527 --> 01:35:44,024
- Set?
- Set.

1147
01:35:44,123 --> 01:35:45,909
One, two, three, go!

1148
01:35:59,992 --> 01:36:01,458
Keep driving!

1149
01:36:08,501 --> 01:36:10,865
No way. You're way
too far away.

1150
01:38:13,576 --> 01:38:15,358
The little boy.

1151
01:38:15,457 --> 01:38:16,501
That's right, Ray.

1152
01:38:17,645 --> 01:38:19,203
The little boy.

1153
01:39:25,003 --> 01:39:25,993
Oh.

1154
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:29,432
I see.

1155
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:37,707
No, Harry.

1156
01:39:38,716 --> 01:39:40,238
He's not...

1157
01:39:42,886 --> 01:39:45,514
You've got to stick
to your principles.

1158
01:40:11,411 --> 01:40:13,159
<i>There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London</i>

1159
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:17,146
<i>with a bunch of presents underneath
it that'll never be opened.</i>

1160
01:40:17,783 --> 01:40:21,764
<i>And I thought, 'If I survive all this,
I'll go to that house,</i>

1161
01:40:21,863 --> 01:40:23,601
<i>'apologize to
the mother there,</i>

1162
01:40:23,702 --> 01:40:27,108
<i>'and accept whatever
punishment she chose for me...'</i>

1163
01:40:27,207 --> 01:40:30,557
<i>Prison, death,
it didn't matter.</i>

1164
01:40:31,895 --> 01:40:35,180
<i>Because at least in prison
and at least in death, you know,</i>

1165
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,631
<i>I wouldn't be
in fucking Bruges.</i>

1166
01:40:40,101 --> 01:40:44,162
<i>But then, like a flash,
it came to me, and I realized,</i>

1167
01:40:46,475 --> 01:40:49,103
<i>'Fuck, man, maybe
that's what Hell is.</i>

1168
01:40:50,712 --> 01:40:54,011
<i>'The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!'</i>

1169
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:01,717
<i>And I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

1170
01:41:04,323 --> 01:41:06,917
<i>I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>
