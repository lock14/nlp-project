1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,040
<i>You look at that river</i>

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,840
<i>gently flowing by.</i>

3
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,240
<i>You notice the leaves</i>

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,280
<i>rustling with the wind.</i>

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,520
<i>You hear the birds.</i>

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,880
<i>You hear the tree frogs.</i>

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,200
<i>In the distance, you hear a cow.</i>

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,520
<i>You feel the grass.</i>

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,560
<i>The mud gives a little bit
on the river bank.</i>

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,120
<i>It's quiet. It's peaceful.</i>

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,480
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,360
<i>it's a gear shift inside you.</i>

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
<i>And it's like taking a deep breath
and going,</i>

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,600
<i>"Oh, yeah, I forgot about this."</i>

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
This is the first picture of the Earth
from space

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,200
that any of us ever saw.

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,080
It was taken on Christmas Eve, 1968

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,800
during the Apollo 8 Mission.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,400
...within relatively comfortable
boundaries.

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,440
But we are filling up that thin shell
of atmosphere with pollution.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Al Gore.</i>

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,400
I am Al Gore.

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,760
I used to be the next president
of the United States Of America.

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,880
I don't find that particularly funny.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
<i>I've been trying to tell this story
for a long time,</i>

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,880
<i>and I feel as if I've failed to get
the message across.</i>

27
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,080
<i>I was in politics for a long time
and I'm proud of my service.</i>

28
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,160
<i>You gotta be kidding me.
This is a national disaster.</i>

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,400
<i>Get every doggone Greyhound bus line
in the country,</i>

30
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,320
<i>and get their... moving to
New Orleans.</i>

31
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,080
<i>That's them thinking small, man,</i>

32
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,240
<i>and this is a major, major, major deal.</i>

33
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,760
<i>What do you need right now?</i>

34
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
<i>There are good people,</i>

35
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>who are in politics in both parties</i>

36
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,080
<i>who hold this at arm's length</i>

37
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,360
<i>because if they acknowledge it
and recognize it,</i>

38
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,720
<i>then the moral imperative to make
big changes</i>

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,240
<i>is inescapable.</i>

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,720
<i>...unless you fix the biggest damn crisis
in the history of this country.</i>

41
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,760
...scouted out landing spots
and they lost radio contact

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,720
when they went around
the dark side of the moon.

43
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,240
And there was inevitably
some suspense.

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,040
Then when they came back
in radio contact,

45
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,760
they looked up

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,280
and they snapped this picture,
and it became known as Earth Rise.

47
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,400
And that one picture exploded

48
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,120
in the consciousness of humankind.

49
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
It lead to dramatic changes.

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,000
Within 18 months of this picture,

51
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,600
the modern environmental movement
had begun.

52
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,640
The next picture was taken on the last
of the Apollo missions,

53
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,200
Apollo 17.

54
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,040
This one was taken
on December 11, 1972,

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,160
and it is the most commonly published
photograph in all of history.

56
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,520
And it's the only picture of the Earth
from space that we have

57
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,960
where the sun was directly
behind the spacecraft

58
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,800
so that the Earth is fully lit up
and not partly in darkness.

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,320
The next image I'm gonna show you
has almost never been seen.

60
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,800
<i>It was taken by a spacecraft
called The Galileo</i>

61
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,240
that went out to explore
the solar system.

62
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,040
And as it was leaving Earth's gravity,
it turned its cameras around

63
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,280
and took a time lapse picture
of one day's worth of rotation,

64
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,840
here compressed into 24 seconds.

65
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
Isn't that beautiful?

66
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,520
This image is a magical image in a way.

67
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,080
It was made by a friend of mine,
Tom Van Sant.

68
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,920
He took 3,000 separate
satellite pictures

69
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,320
taken over a three-year period,
digitally stitched together.

70
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,920
And he chose images
that would give a cloud-free view

71
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,520
of every square inch
of the Earth's surface.

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,560
All of the land masses
accurately portrayed.

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,520
When that's all spread out,
it becomes an iconic image.

74
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,440
I show this because I wanna tell you
a story about two teachers I had.

75
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
One that I didn't like that much,
the other who is a real hero to me.

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,160
I had a grade school teacher
who taught geography

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,320
by pulling a map of the world down
in front of the blackboard.

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,160
I had a classmate in the sixth grade
who raised his hand

79
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,880
and he pointed to the outline
of the east coast of South America

80
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,880
and he pointed
to the west coast of Africa

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,080
and he asked,
"Did they ever fit together?"

82
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,920
and he asked,
"Did they ever fit together?"

83
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,640
And the teacher said,

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,560
"Of course not. That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard."

85
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,280
That student went on to become
a drug addict and a ne'er-do-well.

86
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,560
The teacher went on to become
science advisor

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,160
in the current administration.

88
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,160
But, you know,
the teacher was actually reflecting

89
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,000
the conclusion of the scientific
establishment of that time.

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,760
Continents are so big,
obviously they don't move.

91
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,800
But, actually, as we now know,
they did move.

92
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,840
They moved apart from one another.

93
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,920
But at one time they did,
in fact, fit together.

94
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,400
But that assumption was a problem.

95
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,200
It reflected the well-known wisdom

96
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,880
that what gets us into trouble
is not what we don't know,

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,720
it's what we know for sure
that just ain't so.

98
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,080
This is actually an important point,
believe it or not,

99
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,000
because there is another
such assumption

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,000
that a lot of people have in their minds
right now about global warming

101
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,880
that just ain't so.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,520
The assumption is something like this.
The Earth is so big

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,960
we can't possibly have
any lasting harmful impact

104
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,800
on the Earth's environment.

105
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,800
And maybe that was true at one time,
but it's not anymore.

106
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,280
And one of the reasons
it's not true anymore

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,240
is that the most vulnerable part
of the Earth's ecological system

108
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
is the atmosphere.

109
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,080
Vulnerable because it's so thin.

110
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,360
My friend, the late Carl Sagan,
used to say,

111
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,760
"If you had a big globe
with a coat of varnish on it,

112
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,760
"the thickness of that varnish
relative to that globe

113
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,960
"is pretty much the same

114
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,320
"as the thickness
of the Earth's atmosphere

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,000
"compared to the Earth itself."

116
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,400
And it's thin enough

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,000
that we are capable
of changing its composition.

118
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,800
That brings up the basic science
of global warming.

119
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,480
And I'm not gonna spend a lot of time
on this because you know it well.

120
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,040
The sun's radiation comes in
in the form of light waves

121
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,480
and that heats up the Earth.

122
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,080
And then some of the radiation
that is absorbed and warms the Earth

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,640
is reradiated back into space

124
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,440
in the form of infrared radiation.

125
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,360
And some of the outgoing
infrared radiation is trapped

126
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,440
by this layer of atmosphere
and held inside the atmosphere.

127
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,120
And that's a good thing because
it keeps the temperature of the Earth

128
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,040
within certain boundaries,

129
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,960
keeps it relatively constant and livable.

130
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,000
But the problem is this thin layer
of atmosphere is being thickened

131
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,640
by all of the global warming pollution
that's being put up there.

132
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,400
And what that does is
it thickens this layer of atmosphere,

133
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,640
more of the outgoing infrared is trapped.

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,080
And so the atmosphere heats up
worldwide. That's global warming.

135
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,760
Now, that's the traditional explanation.

136
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,200
Here's what I think is
a better explanation.

137
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,560
You're probably wondering
why your ice cream went away.

138
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,360
Well, Susie, the culprit isn't foreigners.

139
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,400
It's global warming.

140
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,600
- Global...
- Yeah.

141
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,560
<i>Meet Mr. Sunbeam.</i>

142
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,720
<i>He comes all the way from the sun
to visit Earth.</i>

143
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,400
Hello, Earth.
Just popping in to brighten your day.

144
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,200
And now I'll be on my way.

145
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,400
Not so fast, Sunbeam.

146
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,120
We're greenhouse gases.
You ain't going nowhere.

147
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,400
Oh, God, it hurts.

148
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,360
<i>Pretty soon, Earth is chock-full
of Sunbeams.</i>

149
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,280
<i>Their rotting corpses heating
our atmosphere.</i>

150
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,600
How do we get rid
of the greenhouse grasses?

151
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,240
Fortunately, our handsomest politicians

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,000
came up with a cheap, last-minute way
to combat global warming.

153
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
<i>Ever since 2063,</i>

154
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,360
<i>we simply drop a giant ice cube
into the ocean every now and then.</i>

155
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,560
Just like Daddy puts in his drink
every morning.

156
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
And then he gets mad.

157
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,080
<i>Of course, since the greenhouse gases
are still building up,</i>

158
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,000
<i>it takes more and more ice each time.</i>

159
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,880
Thus, solving the problem
once and for all.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,320
- But...
- Once and for all!

161
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,080
This is the image that started me

162
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,640
in my interest in this issue.

163
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,960
And I saw it
when I was a college student

164
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,720
because I had a professor
named Roger Revelle

165
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,280
who was the first person to propose
measuring carbon dioxide

166
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,960
in the Earth's atmosphere.

167
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,560
<i>He saw where the story was going</i>

168
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,800
<i>after the first few chapters.</i>

169
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,480
<i>After the first few years of data,</i>

170
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,480
<i>he intuited what it meant</i>

171
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,600
<i>for what was yet to come.</i>

172
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,440
<i>They designed the experiment in 1957.</i>

173
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,320
<i>He hired Charles David Keeling</i>

174
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,120
<i>who was very faithful and precise</i>

175
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,120
<i>in making these measurements
for decades.</i>

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,080
<i>They started sending
these weather balloons up every day</i>

177
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,800
<i>and they chose the middle of the Pacific</i>

178
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,200
<i>because it was the area
that was most remote.</i>

179
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,880
<i>And he was a very hard-nosed scientist.</i>

180
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,600
<i>He really emphasized the hard data.</i>

181
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,240
<i>It was a wonderful time for me</i>

182
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,440
<i>because, like a lot of young people,</i>

183
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,200
<i>I came into contact
with intellectual ferment,</i>

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,400
<i>ideas that I'd never considered</i>

185
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,880
<i>in my wildest dreams before.</i>

186
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,400
<i>And he showed our class</i>

187
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,200
<i>the results of his measurements
after only a few years.</i>

188
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,120
<i>It was startling to me.</i>

189
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
<i>Now he was startled</i>

190
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,760
<i>and made it clear to our class</i>

191
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,640
<i>what he felt the significance of it was.</i>

192
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,920
<i>And I just soaked it up like a sponge.</i>

193
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,360
<i>He drew the connections</i>

194
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,240
<i>between the larger changes
in our civilization</i>

195
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,280
<i>and this pattern that was now visible</i>

196
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,880
<i>in the atmosphere of the entire planet.</i>

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,400
<i>And then he projected into the future
where this was headed</i>

198
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,600
<i>unless we made some adjustments.</i>

199
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,640
<i>And it was just as clear as day.</i>

200
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,640
After the first seven, eight, nine years,

201
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,880
you could see the pattern
that was developing.

202
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,840
But I asked a question.

203
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,880
Why is it that it goes up and down
once each year?

204
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,280
And he explained that if you look
at the land mass of the Earth,

205
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,840
very little of it is south of the equator.

206
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,040
The vast majority of it is
north of the equator,

207
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
and most of the vegetation is
north of the equator.

208
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,480
And so, when the Northern Hemisphere
is tilted toward the sun,

209
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,080
as it is in our spring and summer,

210
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,680
the leaves come out
and they breathe in carbon dioxide,

211
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,080
and the amount in the atmosphere
goes down.

212
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,400
But when the Northern Hemisphere is
tilted away from the sun,

213
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,680
as it is in our fall and winter,

214
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,880
the leaves fall
and exhale carbon dioxide,

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,200
and the amount in the atmosphere
goes back up again.

216
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,080
And so, it's as if the entire Earth

217
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
once each year breathes in and out.

218
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,680
So we started measuring
carbon dioxide in 1958.

219
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,720
And you can see

220
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,840
that by the middle '60s,
when he showed my class this image,

221
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,200
it was already clear that it was going up.

222
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,960
I respected him and learned from him
so much, I followed this.

223
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,320
And when I went to the Congress
in the middle 1970s,

224
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,400
I helped to organize the first hearings
on global warming

225
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,880
and asked my professor to come
and be the leadoff witness.

226
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,920
And I thought that would have
such a big impact,

227
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,200
we'd be on the way to solving
this problem, but it didn't work that way.

228
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,960
But I kept having hearings.
And in 1984 I went to the Senate

229
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,080
and really dug deeply into this issue

230
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
with science roundtables and the like.

231
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I wrote a book about it,
ran for President in 1988,

232
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,840
partly to try to gain some visibility
for that issue.

233
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,080
And in 1992 went to the White House.
We passed a version of a carbon tax

234
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,400
and some other measures
to try to address this.

235
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,240
Went to Kyoto in 1997
to help get a treaty

236
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,280
that's so controversial,
in the US at least.

237
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,280
In 2000,

238
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,240
my opponent pledged to regulate CO2
and then...

239
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,760
That was not a pledge that was kept.

240
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,240
But the point of this is

241
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,880
all this time you can see

242
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,640
what I have seen all these years.

243
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,760
It just keeps going up. It is relentless.

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,520
And now we're beginning to see
the impact in the real world.

245
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,240
This is Mount Kilimanjaro
more than 30 years ago

246
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,640
and more recently.

247
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,680
And a friend of mine just came back
from Kilimanjaro

248
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,480
with a picture he took
a couple of months ago.

249
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,520
Another friend, Lonnie Thompson,
studies glaciers.

250
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,080
Here's Lonnie with a last sliver
of one of the once mighty glaciers.

251
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,720
Within the decade there will be
no more snows of Kilimanjaro.

252
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,440
This is happening
in Glacier National Park.

253
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,200
I climbed to the top of this in 1998
with one of my daughters.

254
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,120
Within 15 years, this will be the park
formerly known as Glacier.

255
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,320
Here is what's been happening
year by year to the Columbia Glacier.

256
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,280
It just retreats every single year.

257
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,600
And it's a shame
'cause these glaciers are so beautiful.

258
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,920
But those who go up to see them,

259
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,280
here's what they're seeing every day,
now.

260
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
In the Himalayas
there's a particular problem

261
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,240
because 40% of all the people
in the world

262
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,760
get their drinking water
from rivers and spring systems

263
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,440
that are fed more than half
by the melt water

264
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,080
coming off the glaciers.

265
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,640
And within this next half century
those 40% of the people on Earth

266
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,480
are gonna face a very serious shortage

267
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,800
because of this melting.

268
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Italy, the Italian Alps.

269
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,400
Same sight today.

270
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,600
An old postcard from Switzerland.

271
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,640
Throughout the Alps,
we're seeing the same story.

272
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,800
It's also true in South America.

273
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,480
This is Peru 15 years ago.

274
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,840
And the same glacier today.

275
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,880
This is Argentina 20 years ago.
Same glacier today.

276
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,760
Seventy-five years ago in Patagonia
on the tip of South America.

277
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,880
This vast expanse of ice is now gone.

278
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,560
There's a message in this.

279
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:46,960
There's a message in this.

280
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,440
It is worldwide.

281
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,520
And the ice has stories to tell us.

282
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,960
My friend, Lonnie Thompson,
digs core drills in the ice.

283
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,440
They dig down

284
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,640
and they bring the core drills back up
and they look at the ice

285
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,320
and they study it.

286
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,320
When the snow falls,
it traps little bubbles of atmosphere

287
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
and they can go in and measure

288
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,080
how much CO2 was in the atmosphere
the year that that snow fell.

289
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,600
What's even more interesting, I think, is

290
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,360
they can measure
the different isotopes of oxygen

291
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,600
and figure out
a very precise thermometer

292
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,000
and tell you what the temperature was

293
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,480
the year that that bubble was trapped
in the snow as it fell.

294
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,160
When I was in Antarctica,
I saw cores like this.

295
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,520
And a guy looked at it. He said,

296
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,000
"Right here is where the US Congress
passed the Clean Air Act."

297
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,360
And I couldn't believe it.

298
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,400
But you can see the difference
with the naked eye.

299
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,280
Just a couple of years
after that law was passed,

300
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,520
it's very clearly distinguishable.

301
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,560
They can count back year by year

302
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,320
the same way a forester reads
tree rings.

303
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,400
And you can see each annual layer
from the melting and re-freezing,

304
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,720
so they can go back in a lot of these
mountain glaciers 1,000 years.

305
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,200
And they constructed a thermometer
of the temperature.

306
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,160
The blue is cold and the red is warm.

307
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,320
Now, I show this
for a couple of reasons.

308
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,120
Number one, the so-called skeptics
will sometimes say,

309
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,600
"Oh, this whole thing,
this is a cyclical phenomenon.

310
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,560
"There was a medieval warming period,
after all."

311
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,880
Well, yeah, there was.
There it is, right there.

312
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,080
There are two others.

313
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,560
But compared to what's going on now,

314
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,560
there's just no comparison.

315
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,040
So if you look at 1,000 years'
worth of temperature

316
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,480
and compare it to 1,000 years of CO2,

317
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,440
you can see how closely
they fit together.

318
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,800
Now, 1,000 years of CO2
in the mountain glaciers,

319
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,840
that's one thing.

320
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,520
But in Antarctica,
they can go back 650,000 years.

321
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,440
This incidentally is the first time

322
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,960
anybody outside of a small group
of scientists has seen this image.

323
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,840
This is the present day era,

324
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,160
and that's the last ice age.

325
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,480
Then it goes up. We're going back
in time now 650,000 years.

326
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,680
That's the period of warming
between the last two ice ages.

327
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,800
That's the second
and third ice age back.

328
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,640
Fourth, fifth, sixth

329
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,120
and seventh ice age back.

330
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,480
Now, an important point.

331
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,360
In all of this time, 650,000 years,

332
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,720
the CO2 level has never gone above

333
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,520
300 parts per million.

334
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,880
Now, as I said,
they can also measure temperature.

335
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,680
Here's what the temperature
has been on our Earth.

336
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,040
Now, one thing that kind of jumps out
at you is...

337
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,040
Well, let me put it this way.
If my classmate from the sixth grade

338
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,680
that talked about Africa
and South America were here,

339
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,640
he would say,
"Did they ever fit together?"

340
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,680
"Most ridiculous thing I've ever heard."

341
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,240
But they did, of course.

342
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,560
And the relationship is
actually very complicated.

343
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,200
But there is one relationship
that is far more powerful

344
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,120
than all the others and it is this.

345
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,480
When there is more carbon dioxide,
the temperature gets warmer

346
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,880
because it traps more heat
from the sun inside.

347
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,000
In the parts of the United States
that contain the modern cities

348
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,000
of Cleveland, Detroit, New York,
in the northern tier,

349
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,920
this is the difference between a nice day

350
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,800
and having a mile of ice over your head.

351
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,720
Keep that in mind
when you look at this fact.

352
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,240
Carbon dioxide,

353
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,200
having never gone above
300 parts per million,

354
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,760
here is where CO2 is now.

355
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,680
Way above where it's ever been

356
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,200
as far back as this record will measure.

357
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,360
Now, if you'll bear with me,
I wanna really emphasize this point.

358
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,400
The crew here

359
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,080
has tried to teach me
how to use this contraption here.

360
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
So, if I don't kill myself, I'll...

361
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,640
It's already right here.

362
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,640
Look how far above
the natural cycle this is,

363
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,440
and we've done that.

364
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,120
But, ladies and gentlemen,
in the next 50 years,

365
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
really, in less than 50 years,

366
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,880
it's gonna continue to go up.

367
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,480
When some of these children
who are here are my age,

368
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,360
here is what it's going to be
in less than 50 years.

369
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,400
You've heard of off the charts.

370
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,640
Within less than 50 years, it'll be here.

371
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,120
There's not a single fact
or date or number

372
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,480
that's been used to make this up
that's in any controversy.

373
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,760
The so-called skeptics look at this
and they say,

374
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,240
"So? That seems perfectly okay."

375
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,880
"So? That seems perfectly okay."

376
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,240
Well,

377
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,920
again, if on the temperature side,

378
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,000
if this much on the cold side is
a mile of ice over our heads,

379
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,280
what would that much
on the warm side be?

380
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,400
Ultimately this is really not
a political issue

381
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,920
so much as a moral issue.

382
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,560
If we allow that to happen,

383
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,680
it is deeply unethical.

384
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,200
<i>I had such faith
in our democratic system,</i>

385
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,040
<i>our self-government.</i>

386
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,800
<i>I actually thought and believed</i>

387
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,720
<i>that the story would be compelling
enough to cause a real sea change</i>

388
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,080
<i>in the way the Congress reacted
to that issue.</i>

389
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,720
<i>I thought they would be startled, too.</i>

390
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,160
<i>And they weren't.</i>

391
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,280
<i>The struggles,</i>

392
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,200
<i>the victories that aren't really victories,
the defeats that aren't really defeats.</i>

393
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,040
<i>They can serve to magnify
the significance</i>

394
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,720
<i>of some trivial step forward,</i>

395
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,720
<i>exaggerate the seeming importance</i>

396
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,960
<i>of some massive setback.</i>

397
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,400
<i>April 3, 1989.</i>

398
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,520
<i>My son pulled loose from my hand</i>

399
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,760
<i>and chased his friend across the street.</i>

400
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,080
<i>He was six years old.</i>

401
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,440
<i>The machine was breathing for him.</i>

402
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,880
<i>We were possibly going to lose him.</i>

403
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,200
<i>He finally took a breath.</i>

404
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,080
<i>We stayed in the hospital for a month.</i>

405
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,360
<i>It was almost as if</i>

406
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,520
<i>you could look at that calendar
and just go...</i>

407
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,560
<i>And everything just flew off.</i>

408
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,040
<i>Seemed trivial, insignificant.</i>

409
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,600
<i>He was so brave. He was such...</i>

410
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,040
<i>He was such a brave guy.</i>

411
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
<i>It just turned my whole world
upside down</i>

412
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,560
<i>and then shook it
until everything fell out.</i>

413
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,800
<i>My way of being in the world,
it just changed everything for me.</i>

414
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
<i>How should I spend my time
on this Earth?</i>

415
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,080
<i>I really dug in,</i>

416
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
<i>trying to learn about it
much more deeply.</i>

417
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,560
<i>I went to Antarctica.</i>

418
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,240
<i>Went to the South Pole, the North Pole,
the Amazon.</i>

419
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,600
<i>Went to places where scientists
could help me understand</i>

420
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,120
<i>parts of the issue that</i>

421
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,320
<i>I didn't really understand in depth.</i>

422
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,680
<i>The possibility of losing
what was most precious to me.</i>

423
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,800
<i>I gained an ability</i>

424
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,640
<i>that maybe I didn't have before.</i>

425
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,520
<i>But when I felt it,</i>

426
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,560
<i>I felt that we could really lose it,</i>

427
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,960
<i>that what we take for granted
might not be here for our children.</i>

428
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,240
These are actual measurements
of atmospheric temperatures

429
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,000
since our Civil War.

430
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,640
In any given year,
it might look like it's going down,

431
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,360
but the overall trend is extremely clear.

432
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,160
And in recent years,

433
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,680
it's uninterrupted and it is intensifying.

434
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,560
In fact, if you look at the 10 hottest
years ever measured

435
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,560
in this atmospheric record,

436
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,320
they've all occurred in the last 14 years.

437
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,160
And the hottest of all was 2005.

438
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,200
We have already seen
some of the heat waves

439
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,400
that are similar
to what scientists are saying

440
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,040
are gonna be a lot more common.

441
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,560
Couple of years ago in Europe
they had that massive heat wave

442
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,080
that killed 35,000 people.

443
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,880
India didn't get as much attention,

444
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,480
but the same year
the temperature there went

445
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,600
to 122 degrees Fahrenheit.

446
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,000
This past summer
in the American West,

447
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,800
<i>there were a lot of cities that broke
all-time records for high temperatures</i>

448
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,520
<i>and number of consecutive days
with a 100-degree temperature or more.</i>

449
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,320
<i>Two hundred cities and towns
in the west set all-time records.</i>

450
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,640
<i>And in the east there were a lot of cities
that did the same thing.</i>

451
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,600
Including, incidentally, New Orleans.

452
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,800
So the temperature increases are
taking place all over the world,

453
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,840
including in the oceans.

454
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,160
This is the natural range of variability
for temperature in the oceans.

455
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,880
You know, people say,
"Oh, it's just natural.

456
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,240
"It goes up and down,
so don't worry about it."

457
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
This is the range that would be
expected over the last 60 years,

458
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,160
but the scientists who specialize in
global warming have computer models

459
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,760
that long ago predicted
this range of temperature increase.

460
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,960
Now I'm gonna show you,
recently released,

461
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,120
the actual ocean temperatures.

462
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,200
And, of course, when the oceans get
warmer, that causes stronger storms.

463
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,160
We have seen
in the last couple of years

464
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,000
a lot of big hurricanes.

465
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,240
Hurricane Jeanne and Frances
and Ivan were among them.

466
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,400
And the same year that we had
that string of big hurricanes,

467
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,000
we also set an all-time record
for tornadoes in the United States.

468
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,120
Japan again didn't get
as much attention in our news media,

469
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,960
but they set an all-time record
for typhoons.

470
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,280
Previous record was seven.

471
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,000
Here are all 10 of the ones
they had in 2004.

472
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,640
The science textbooks have had
to be rewritten

473
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,080
because they say that it's impossible to
have a hurricane in the South Atlantic.

474
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,920
But the same year the first one ever
hit Brazil.

475
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Summer of 2005 has been
one for the books.

476
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,480
The first one was Emily
that socked into Yucatán.

477
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,400
Then Hurricane Dennis came along
and it did a lot of damage,

478
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,280
including to the oil industry.

479
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,640
This is the largest oil platform
in the world after Dennis went through.

480
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,360
This one was driven into the bridge
at Mobile.

481
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,520
And then, of course, came Katrina.

482
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,520
It's worth remembering that when
it hit Florida, it was a Category One.

483
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,480
But it killed a lot of people and caused
billions of dollars' worth of damage.

484
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
And then what happened?

485
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,720
Before it hit New Orleans,

486
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,800
it went over warmer waters.

487
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,600
As the water temperature increases,

488
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,320
the wind velocity increases

489
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,280
and the moisture content increases.

490
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,680
And you'll see Hurricane Katrina
form over Florida.

491
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,040
And then as it comes into the gulf
over that warm water,

492
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,800
it picks up that energy and gets
stronger and stronger and stronger.

493
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,720
Look at that hurricane's eye.

494
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,080
And, of course,
the consequences were so horrendous,

495
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,800
there are no words to describe it.

496
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,240
<i>Yeah, we're getting reports and calls
that are just breaking my heart.</i>

497
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,520
<i>From people saying, "I've been
in my attic. I can't take it anymore.</i>

498
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,600
<i>"The water is up to my neck.
I don't think I can hold out."</i>

499
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,200
<i>And that's happening as we speak.</i>

500
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,200
<i>We told everybody the importance
of the 17th Street Canal issue.</i>

501
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,960
<i>We said,
"Please, please, take care of this.</i>

502
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,280
<i>"We don't care what you do.
Figure it out."</i>

503
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,880
<i>Something new for America.</i>

504
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,800
<i>But how in God's name
could that happen here?</i>

505
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,000
There had been warnings
that hurricanes would get stronger.

506
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,680
There were warnings
that this hurricane,

507
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,720
days before it hit,
would breach the levees,

508
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,560
would cause the kind of damage
that it ultimately did cause.

509
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
And one question
we as a people need to decide

510
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,760
is how we react when we hear warnings

511
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,520
from the leading scientists in the world.

512
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,120
There was another storm in the 1930s
of a different kind.

513
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,600
A horrible, unprecedented storm
in continental Europe,

514
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,800
and Winston Churchill warned
the people of England

515
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,840
that it was different from anything
that had ever happened before

516
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,200
and they had to get ready for it.

517
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,960
And a lot of people did not want
to believe it.

518
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,840
And he got real impatient
with all the dithering.

519
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And he said this,

520
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,040
<i>Making mistakes in generations
and centuries past</i>

521
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,320
<i>would have consequences
that we could overcome.</i>

522
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,760
<i>We don't have that luxury anymore.</i>

523
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,760
<i>We didn't ask for it,</i>

524
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,360
<i>but here it is.</i>

525
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,600
<i>Al Gore is the winner
of the national popular vote.</i>

526
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,880
<i>But the state of Florida, whomever
wins there wins the White House.</i>

527
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,720
<i>We call Florida, in the Al Gore column...</i>

528
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,440
<i>Bulletin: Florida pulled back
into the undecided column.</i>

529
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,400
<i>George Bush is the president elect
of the United States. He is...</i>

530
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,680
<i>Florida goes Bush.
The presidency is Bush. That's it.</i>

531
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,400
<i>And at 2:18 this morning, we project...</i>

532
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,480
<i>All right, we're officially saying
that Florida is too close to call.</i>

533
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,120
<i>While I strongly disagree
with the court's decision,</i>

534
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,440
<i>I accept it.</i>

535
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,280
<i>I accept the finality of this outcome.</i>

536
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,000
<i>...do solemnly swear...</i>

537
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,240
<i>I, George Walker Bush,
do solemnly swear...</i>

538
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,880
<i>...that I will faithfully execute
the Office of President...</i>

539
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,240
<i>Well, that was a hard blow, but...</i>

540
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,840
<i>What do you do? You...</i>

541
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,120
<i>You make the best of it.</i>

542
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,360
<i>It brought into clear focus</i>

543
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,640
<i>the mission that I had been pursuing</i>

544
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
<i>for all these years, and</i>

545
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,600
<i>I started giving the slide show again.</i>

546
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,280
<i>One often unnoticed effect
of global warming</i>

547
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
is it causes more precipitation,

548
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,680
but more of it coming
in one-time big storm events.

549
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,560
Because the evaporation off the oceans
puts all the moisture up there,

550
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,920
when storm conditions trigger
the downpour, more of it falls down.

551
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,000
when storm conditions trigger
the downpour, more of it falls down.

552
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,360
The insurance industry has
actually noticed this.

553
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,040
Their recovered losses are going up.

554
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,320
You see the damage
from these severe weather events?

555
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,400
And 2005 is not even on this yet.

556
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,000
When it does, it'll be off that chart.

557
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,560
Europe has just had a year very similar
to the one we've had

558
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,600
where they say
nature's been going crazy.

559
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,360
All kinds of unusual catastrophes,

560
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,840
like a nature hike
through the Book of Revelations.

561
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,880
Flooding in Asia.

562
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Mumbai, India this past July.

563
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,960
Thirty-seven inches of rain in 24 hours.

564
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,320
By far, the largest downpour

565
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,080
that any city in India has ever received.

566
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,200
Lot of flooding in China, also.

567
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,760
Global warming, paradoxically,
causes not only more flooding,

568
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,120
but also more drought.

569
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,560
This neighboring province
right next door

570
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,840
had a severe drought at the same time
these areas were flooding.

571
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,480
One of the reasons for this
has to do with the fact

572
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,240
that global warming not only increases
precipitation worldwide,

573
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,400
but it also relocates the precipitation.

574
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,280
And focus most of all
on this part of Africa

575
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,680
just on the edge of the Sahara.

576
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,040
Unbelievable tragedies have been
unfolding there,

577
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,640
and there are a lot of reasons for it.

578
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,760
But Darfur and Niger are
among those tragedies.

579
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,640
And one of the factors
that has been compounding them

580
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,800
is the lack of rainfall
and the increasing drought.

581
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,520
This is Lake Chad, once one
of the largest lakes in the world.

582
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,800
It has dried up over the last
few decades to almost nothing,

583
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,640
vastly complicating the other problems
that they also have.

584
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,840
The second reason

585
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
why this is a paradox.

586
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,760
Global warming creates
more evaporation off the oceans

587
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,320
to seed the clouds,

588
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,480
but it sucks moisture out of the soil.

589
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,840
Soil evaporation increases dramatically

590
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,760
with higher temperatures.

591
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,080
And that has consequences
for us in the United States, as well.

592
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,520
So this is the Carthage exit.

593
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,920
When I was 14 years old,
I totaled the family car

594
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,840
right there.

595
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,600
Went off that shoulder, turned it over.

596
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,520
And see this Black Angus bull?

597
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,200
We raised Black Angus.

598
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,440
<i>My father was named
Breeder of the Month.</i>

599
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,400
<i>He grew up on a farm.</i>

600
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,920
<i>All through his career in the Senate</i>

601
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,880
<i>he continued to come back here
and raise cattle.</i>

602
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,400
<i>Learning it from your dad on the land,</i>

603
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,120
<i>that's really something special.</i>

604
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,200
<i>My childhood upbringing was
a little unusual in the sense that</i>

605
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,080
<i>I spent eight months of each year
in Washington DC</i>

606
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,120
<i>in a small little hotel apartment.</i>

607
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,320
<i>And then the other four months were
spent here on this big, beautiful farm.</i>

608
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,800
<i>I had a dog here.</i>

609
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,480
<i>I had a pony here.</i>

610
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,240
<i>I could shoot my rifle here.</i>

611
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,720
<i>I could go swimming in the river here.</i>

612
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,520
<i>Go out and lay down in the grass.</i>

613
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,200
<i>As a kid, it took me a while</i>

614
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,080
<i>to learn the difference
between fun and work.</i>

615
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,920
<i>The places where people live
were chosen</i>

616
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,800
<i>because of the climate pattern</i>

617
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,800
<i>that has been pretty much the same
on Earth</i>

618
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,400
<i>since the end of the last ice age
11,000 years ago.</i>

619
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,560
<i>Here, on this farm,
the patterns are changing.</i>

620
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,440
<i>And it seems gradual
in the course of a human lifetime</i>

621
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,600
<i>but in the course of time,
as defined by this river,</i>

622
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,000
<i>it's happening very, very quickly.</i>

623
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,040
<i>Two canaries in the coal mine.</i>

624
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,720
First one is in the Arctic.

625
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,960
This, of course, is the Arctic Ocean,
the floating ice cap.

626
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,520
Greenland, on its side there.

627
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,400
I say canary in the coal mine

628
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,440
because the Arctic is
one of the two regions of the world

629
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,160
that is experiencing faster impacts

630
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,600
from global warming.

631
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:25,640
from global warming.

632
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,800
This is the largest ice shelf
in the Arctic,

633
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,720
the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf.

634
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,640
It just cracked in half three years ago.

635
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,680
The scientists were astonished.

636
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,680
These are called drunken trees
just going every which way.

637
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,080
This is not caused by wind damage
or alcohol consumption.

638
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,480
These trees put their roots down
in the permafrost,

639
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,920
and the permafrost is thawing.

640
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,840
And so they just go
every which way now.

641
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,000
This building was built
on the permafrost

642
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,760
and has collapsed
as the permafrost thaws.

643
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,960
This woman's house has had
to be abandoned.

644
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,360
The pipeline is suffering
a great deal of structural damage.

645
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,160
And incidentally, the oil that they want
to produce in that protected area

646
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,760
in Northern Alaska,
which I hope they don't,

647
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,280
they have to depend on trucks
to go in and out of there.

648
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,320
And the trucks go over
the frozen ground.

649
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,000
This shows the number of days
that the tundra in Alaska is

650
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,880
frozen enough to drive on it.

651
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,360
Thirty-five years ago, 225 days a year.

652
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Now it's below 75 days a year

653
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,240
because the spring comes earlier
and the fall comes later

654
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,000
and the temperatures
just keep on going up.

655
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,240
I went up to the North Pole.

656
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,480
I went under that ice cap
in a nuclear submarine

657
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,600
that surfaced through the ice like this.

658
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,120
Since they started patrolling in 1957,

659
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,520
they have gone under the ice

660
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,400
and measured
with their radar looking upwards

661
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,000
to measure how thick it is

662
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
because they can only surface in areas

663
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,920
where it's three and a half feet thick
or less.

664
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,840
So they have kept a meticulous record

665
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,560
and they wouldn't release it
because it was national security.

666
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,880
I went up there in order to persuade
them to release it, and they did.

667
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,280
And here's what that record shows.

668
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,800
Starting in 1970,
there was a precipitous drop-off

669
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,760
in the amount and extent and thickness
of the Arctic ice cap.

670
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,720
It has diminished by 40% in 40 years.

671
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,600
And there are now
two major studies showing

672
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,120
that within the next 50 to 70 years,

673
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,760
in summertime
it will be completely gone.

674
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,840
Now, you might say,
"Why is that a problem?"

675
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,600
And "How could the Arctic ice cap
actually melt so quickly?"

676
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,600
When the sun's rays hit the ice,

677
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,920
more than 90% of it bounces off
right back into space like a mirror.

678
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,840
But when it hits the open ocean,
more than 90% of it is absorbed.

679
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,880
And so, as the surrounding water
gets warmer,

680
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,760
it speeds up the melting of the ice.

681
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,000
Right now, the Arctic ice cap acts
like a giant mirror.

682
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,080
All the sun's rays bounce off,
more than 90%.

683
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,040
It keeps the Earth cooler.

684
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,800
But as it melts

685
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,320
and the open ocean receives
that sun's energy instead,

686
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,440
more than 90% is absorbed.

687
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,040
So there is
a faster buildup of heat here,

688
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,920
at the North Pole, in the Arctic Ocean,

689
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,440
and the Arctic generally
than anywhere else on the planet.

690
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,200
<i>That's not good for creatures like
polar bears who depend on the ice.</i>

691
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,440
<i>A new scientific study shows that</i>

692
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,040
<i>for the first time they're finding
polar bears that have actually drowned,</i>

693
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,440
<i>swimming long distances,
up to 60 miles, to find the ice.</i>

694
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,400
<i>And they didn't find that before.</i>

695
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,720
<i>But what does it mean to us?</i>

696
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>To look at a vast expanse of open water</i>

697
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,520
<i>at the top of our world
that used to be covered by ice.</i>

698
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,960
We ought to care a lot

699
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,480
because it has planetary effects.

700
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,440
The Earth's climate is like a big engine
for redistributing heat

701
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,480
from the equator to the poles.

702
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,200
And it does that by means
of ocean currents and wind currents.

703
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,800
They tell us, the scientists do, that the
Earth's climate is a nonlinear system.

704
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,840
Just a fancy way they have of saying

705
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,280
that the changes are not
all just gradual.

706
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,120
Some of them come suddenly,
in big jumps.

707
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,840
On a worldwide basis,
the annual average temperature is

708
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,680
about 58 degrees Fahrenheit.

709
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,160
If we have an increase of five degrees,

710
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,120
which is on the low end
of the projections,

711
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,360
look at how that translates globally.

712
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,840
That means an increase of only
one degree at the equator,

713
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,800
but more than 12 degrees at the pole.

714
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And so all those wind
and ocean current patterns

715
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,560
that have formed since the last ice age
and have been relatively stable,

716
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,400
they're all up in the air and they change.

717
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,040
And one of the ones
they're most worried about,

718
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,840
where they've spent a lot of time
studying the problem,

719
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,800
is in the North Atlantic

720
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,880
where the Gulf Stream comes up
and meets the cold winds

721
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,120
coming off the Arctic over Greenland.

722
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,680
And that evaporates so that the heat
out of the Gulf Stream

723
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,760
and the steam is carried over
to Western Europe

724
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,440
by the prevailing winds
and the Earth's rotation.

725
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,240
But isn't it interesting that
the whole ocean current system

726
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,720
is all linked together in this loop?

727
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,040
They call it the ocean conveyor.

728
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,560
And the red are
the warm surface currents.

729
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,760
The Gulf Stream is
the best known of them.

730
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,800
But the blue represent the cold currents

731
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,320
running in the opposite direction,

732
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,520
and we don't see them at all because
they run along the bottom of the ocean.

733
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,040
Up in the North Atlantic,
after that heat is pulled out,

734
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,760
what's left behind is
colder water and saltier water

735
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,840
because the salt doesn't go anywhere.

736
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,600
And so that makes it
denser and heavier.

737
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,840
And so that cold, dense,
heavy water sinks

738
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,760
at the rate of five billion
gallons per second.

739
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,840
And then that pulls that current
back south.

740
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,600
At the end of the last ice age,

741
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,120
as the last glacier was receding
from North America,

742
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,880
as the last glacier was receding
from North America,

743
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,400
the ice melted
and a giant pool of fresh water

744
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,120
formed in North America.

745
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,040
And the Great Lakes are the remnants
of that huge lake.

746
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,760
An ice dam on the eastern border
formed and one day it broke.

747
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,520
And all that fresh water
came rushing out,

748
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,800
ripping open the St. Lawrence there,

749
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,560
and it diluted the salty, dense,
cold water,

750
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,200
made it fresher and lighter,
so it stopped sinking.

751
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,240
And that pump shut off.

752
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,080
And the heat transfer stopped.

753
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,360
And Europe went back into an ice age
for another 900 to 1,000 years.

754
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,520
And the change from conditions
like we have here today

755
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,600
to an ice age

756
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,320
took place in perhaps
as little as 10 years' time.

757
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,080
So that's a sudden jump.

758
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,080
Now, of course that's
not gonna happen again

759
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,240
because the glaciers of North America
are not there, and...

760
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,960
Is there any other big chunk of ice
anywhere near there?

761
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,920
Oh, yeah.

762
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
We'll come back to that one.

763
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,200
<i>It's extremely frustrating to me</i>

764
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,160
<i>to communicate over and over again,
as clearly as I can.</i>

765
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,400
<i>And we are still, by far,</i>

766
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,040
<i>the worst contributor to the problem.</i>

767
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,120
<i>And I look around</i>

768
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,760
<i>and look for really meaningful signs</i>

769
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,720
<i>that we're about to really change.</i>

770
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,800
<i>I don't see it right now.</i>

771
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,640
<i>A number of very reputable scientists
have said that one factor of air pollution</i>

772
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,160
<i>is oxides of nitrogen
from decaying vegetation.</i>

773
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,560
<i>This is what causes the haze that gave
the big Smoky Mountains their name.</i>

774
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,680
Thank you very much, okay.

775
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,720
<i>This guy is so far off
in the environmental extreme,</i>

776
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,680
<i>we'll be up to our neck in owls
and out of work for every American.</i>

777
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,520
<i>This guy is crazy.</i>

778
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,480
<i>Even if humans were causing
global warming, and we are not,</i>

779
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,880
<i>this could be maybe the greatest hoax
ever perpetrated</i>

780
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,440
<i>on the American people.</i>

781
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,440
<i>We're dealing with something
that's highly emotional.</i>

782
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,360
<i>If an issue is not</i>

783
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,080
<i>on the tips
of their constituents' tongues,</i>

784
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,400
<i>it's easy for them to ignore it.</i>

785
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,080
<i>To say, "Well, we'll deal
with that tomorrow."</i>

786
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,280
So the same phenomena of changing
all these patterns

787
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,880
is also affecting the seasons.

788
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,400
Here is a study from the Netherlands.

789
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,880
The peak arrival date for migratory birds

790
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,680
25 years ago was April 25th,

791
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,520
and their chicks hatched
on June the 3rd.

792
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,040
Just at the time when the caterpillars
were coming out.

793
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,600
Nature's plan.

794
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,600
But 20 years of warming later,

795
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,320
the caterpillars peaked
two weeks earlier,

796
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,240
and the chicks tried to catch up with it,
but they couldn't.

797
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,560
And so, they're in trouble.

798
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,600
And there are millions
of ecological niches

799
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,040
that are affected by global warming
in just this way.

800
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,400
This is the number of days with frost
in Southern Switzerland

801
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,000
over the last 100 years.

802
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,360
It has gone down rapidly.
But now watch this.

803
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,440
This is the number
of invasive exotic species

804
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,400
that have rushed in to fill the new
ecological niches that are opening up.

805
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,920
That's happening here
in the United States, too.

806
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,520
You've heard
of the pine beetle problem?

807
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,040
Those pine beetles used to be killed
by the cold winters,

808
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,440
but there are fewer days of frost,

809
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,280
and so the pine trees are
being devastated.

810
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:41,120
This is part of 14 million acres
of spruce trees in Alaska

811
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,200
that have been killed by bark beetles.
The exact same phenomenon.

812
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,720
There are cities that were founded

813
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,480
because they were just above
the mosquito line.

814
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,080
Nairobi is one, Harare is another.
There are plenty of others.

815
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,280
Now the mosquitoes, with warming,
are climbing to higher altitudes.

816
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,720
There are a lot of vectors for infectious
diseases that are worrisome to us

817
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
that are also expanding their range.

818
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,720
Not only mosquitoes,
but all of these others as well.

819
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,600
And we've had 30 so-called
new diseases

820
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,880
that have emerged
just in the last quarter century.

821
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,800
And a lot of them, like SARS, have
caused tremendous problems.

822
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,680
The resistant forms of tuberculosis.
There are others.

823
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,080
And there's been a re-emergence
of some diseases

824
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,280
that were once under control.

825
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,120
The avian flu, of course,
quite a serious matter, as you know.

826
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,880
West Nile Virus.

827
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,080
It came to the eastern shore
of Maryland in 1999.

828
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,400
Two years later,
it was across the Mississippi.

829
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,120
And two years after that,
it had spread across the continent.

830
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,640
But these are very troubling signs.

831
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,000
Coral reefs all over the world,

832
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,360
because of global warming
and other factors,

833
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,400
are bleaching and they end up like this.

834
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,440
And all the fish species
that depend on the coral reefs

835
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,960
are also in jeopardy as a result.

836
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,160
Overall, species loss is now occurring

837
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,880
at a rate 1,000 times greater
than the natural background rate.

838
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,360
This brings me to the second canary
in the coal mine.

839
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,680
Antarctica.

840
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,680
The largest mass of ice on the planet
by far.

841
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,720
A friend of mine said in 1978,

842
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,320
"If you see the breakup of ice shelves
along the Antarctic peninsula,

843
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,800
"watch out

844
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,040
"because that should be seen
as an alarm bell for global warming."

845
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,240
And actually, if you look
at the peninsula up close,

846
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,560
every place where you see
one of these green blotches here

847
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,160
is an ice shelf larger
than the state of Rhode Island

848
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,800
that has broken up
just in the last 15 to 20 years.

849
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,840
I want to focus on just one of them.

850
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,400
It's called Larsen B.

851
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,840
I want you to look
at these black pools here.

852
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,760
It makes it seem almost
as if we're looking through the ice

853
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,600
to the ocean beneath.
But that's an illusion.

854
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,160
This is melting water
that forms in pools,

855
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,840
and if you were flying over it
in a helicopter,

856
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,360
you'd see it's 700 feet tall.

857
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,000
They are so majestic, so massive.

858
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,720
In the distance are the mountains
and just before the mountains

859
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,760
is the shelf of the continent, there.

860
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,760
This is floating ice,

861
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,880
and there's land-based ice
on the down slope of those mountains.

862
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,880
From here to the mountains
is about 20 to 25 miles.

863
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,360
Now they thought this would be
stable for at least 100 years,

864
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,000
even with global warming.

865
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,200
The scientists who study
these ice shelves

866
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,240
were absolutely astonished

867
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,120
when they were looking
at these images.

868
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,000
Starting on January 31, 2002

869
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,720
in a period of 35 days

870
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,840
this ice shelf completely disappeared.

871
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,880
They could not figure out how
in the world this happened so rapidly.

872
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,920
And they went back to try to figure out
where they'd gone wrong.

873
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,160
And that's when they focused
on those pools of melting water.

874
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,840
But even before they could figure out
what had happened there,

875
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,280
something else started going wrong.

876
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,800
When the floating sea-based ice
cracked up,

877
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,600
it no longer held back
the ice on the land,

878
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,080
and the land-based ice
then started falling into the ocean.

879
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,280
It was like letting the cork
out of a bottle.

880
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,960
And there's a difference between
floating ice and land-based ice.

881
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,680
That's like the difference between
an ice cube floating in a glass of water,

882
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,240
which when it melts doesn't raise
the level of water in the glass,

883
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,080
and a cube that's sitting atop
a stack of ice cubes

884
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,600
which melts and flows over the edge.

885
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,360
That's why the citizens
of these Pacific nations

886
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,840
have all had to evacuate
to New Zealand.

887
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,440
But I want to focus on West Antarctica

888
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,200
because it illustrates two factors about
land-based ice and sea-based ice.

889
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,600
It's a little of both.
It's propped up on tops of islands,

890
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,560
but the ocean comes up underneath it.

891
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,600
So as the ocean gets warmer,
it has an impact on it.

892
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,480
If this were to go,

893
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,240
sea level worldwide
would go up 20 feet.

894
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,200
They've measured disturbing changes
on the underside of this ice sheet.

895
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,000
It's considered relatively
more stable, however,

896
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,640
than another big body of ice
that's roughly the same size.

897
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,480
Greenland would also raise sea level
almost 20 feet

898
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,880
if it went.

899
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,480
A friend of mine just brought back
some pictures

900
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,280
of what's going on on Greenland
right now.

901
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,280
Dramatic changes.
These are the same kinds of pools

902
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,760
that formed here,
on this ice shelf in Antarctica.

903
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
And the scientists thought

904
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,640
that when that water seeped back
into the ice, it would just refreeze.

905
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,000
But they found out
that actually what happens

906
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,440
is that it just keeps on going.
It tunnels to the bottom

907
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,040
and makes the ice like Swiss cheese,

908
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,600
sort of like termites.

909
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,520
This shows what happens
to the crevasses,

910
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:00,000
and when lakes form,
they create what are called moulins.

911
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,960
The water goes down to the bottom

912
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,480
and it lubricates
where the ice meets the bedrock.

913
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,880
See these people here for scale.

914
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,160
This is not on the edge of Greenland,
this is in the middle of the ice mass.

915
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,360
This is a massive rushing torrent

916
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,560
of fresh melt water

917
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,960
tunneling straight down
through the Greenland ice

918
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,760
to the bedrock below.

919
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,560
Now, to some extent,
there has always been seasonal melting

920
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,720
and moulins have formed in the past,
but not like now.

921
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,160
In 1992, they measured
this amount of melting in Greenland.

922
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,000
Ten years later, this is what happened.

923
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,760
And here is the melting from 2005.

924
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,080
Tony Blair's scientific advisor
has said that

925
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,920
because of what's happening
in Greenland right now,

926
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,720
the maps of the world will have
to be redrawn.

927
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,600
If Greenland broke up and melted,

928
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,080
or if half of Greenland
and half of West Antarctica

929
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,720
broke up and melted,

930
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,040
this is what would happen
to the sea level in Florida.

931
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,720
This is what would happen
to San Francisco Bay.

932
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,120
A lot of people live in these areas.

933
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,760
The Netherlands,
one of the low countries.

934
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,600
Absolutely devastating.

935
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,520
The area around Beijing that's home
to tens of millions of people.

936
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,680
Even worse, in the area
around Shanghai,

937
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,880
there are 40 million people.

938
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,080
Worse still, Calcutta,
and to the east, Bangladesh,

939
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,880
the area covered includes
60 million people.

940
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,680
Think of the impact of a couple
hundred thousand refugees

941
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,680
when they're displaced
by an environmental event.

942
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,160
And then imagine the impact
of a hundred million or more.

943
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,960
Here's Manhattan.

944
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,440
This is the World Trade Center
memorial site.

945
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,880
And after the horrible events of 9/11,

946
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,400
we said, "Never again."

947
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:11,440
we said, "Never again."

948
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,880
But this is what would happen
to Manhattan.

949
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,120
They can measure this precisely,

950
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,080
just as the scientists could
predict precisely

951
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,040
how much water would breach
the levees in New Orleans.

952
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,640
The area where the World Trade Center
Memorial is to be located

953
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,760
would be underwater.

954
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,640
Is it possible that we should prepare
against other threats besides terrorists?

955
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,760
Maybe we should be concerned
about other problems as well.

956
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,040
<i>1.3 billion people.</i>

957
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,080
<i>An economy that's surging.</i>

958
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,200
<i>More and more energy needs.</i>

959
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,120
<i>Massive coal reserves.</i>

960
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,360
The coal belt in Northern China,

961
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,360
- Inner Mongolia.
- Right.

962
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,280
Then there's Shaanxi province.

963
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,080
- And also biggest coal mine here.
- Up here.

964
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,240
- Yeah.
- Now, is that an open pit mine?

965
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

966
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,600
<i>Every time I've visited China,</i>

967
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,440
<i>I've learned from their scientists.
They're right on the cutting edge.</i>

968
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,160
Give me some sense of the numbers of

969
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,080
new coal fire generating plants.

970
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,920
Well, I have to say
that the number is enormous

971
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,760
because it's so profitable.

972
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,560
<i>This issue is really the same for China
as it is for the US.</i>

973
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:51,080
<i>We are both using old technologies
that are dirty and polluting.</i>

974
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,640
<i>...more flooding and more drought</i>

975
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,120
<i>and stronger storms is going up,</i>

976
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,680
<i>and global warming is implicated
in the pattern.</i>

977
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,560
<i>And if you were to give some
suggestions to everybody here</i>

978
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,600
<i>about, like, what we can do
for the situation now.</i>

979
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,000
<i>Separating the truth from the fiction</i>

980
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,800
<i>and the accurate connections
from the misunderstandings</i>

981
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,440
<i>is part of what you learn here.</i>

982
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,960
<i>But when the warnings are accurate
and based on sound science,</i>

983
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,000
<i>then we as human beings,
whatever country we live in,</i>

984
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,240
<i>have to find a way to make sure</i>

985
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,000
<i>that the warnings are heard
and responded to.</i>

986
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,600
<i>We both have a hard time
shaking loose the familiar patterns</i>

987
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,600
<i>that we've relied on in the past.</i>

988
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,640
<i>We both face completely
unacceptable consequences.</i>

989
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,280
And there are three factors
that are causing this collision,

990
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,160
and the first is population.

991
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,720
When my generation, the baby boom
generation, was born after World War II,

992
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,520
the population had just crossed
the two billion mark.

993
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,480
Now, I'm in my 50s,

994
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,920
and it's already gone
to almost six and a half billion.

995
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:26,400
And if I reach the demographic
expectation for the baby boomers,

996
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,440
it'll go over nine billion.

997
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:33,600
So if it takes 10,000 generations
to reach two billion

998
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,680
and then in one human lifetime, ours,

999
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,400
it goes from two billion to nine billion,

1000
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,040
something profoundly different's
going on right now.

1001
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,680
We're putting more pressure
on the Earth.

1002
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,680
Most of it's in the poorer nations
of the world.

1003
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,400
This puts pressure on food demand.

1004
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,640
It puts pressure on water demand.

1005
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,000
It puts pressure on vulnerable
natural resources,

1006
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,520
and this pressure's one of the reasons

1007
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,520
why we have seen all the devastation
of the forest,

1008
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,600
not only tropical, but elsewhere.

1009
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,640
It is a political issue.

1010
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,040
This is the border between Haiti
and the Dominican Republic.

1011
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,120
One set of policies here,
another set of policies here.

1012
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,440
Much of it comes not only
because of cutting, but also burning.

1013
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,040
Almost 30% of all the CO2 that goes up
each year into the atmosphere

1014
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,520
comes from forest burning.

1015
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,680
This is a time-lapse picture of the Earth
at night over a six-month period

1016
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,960
showing the lights of the cities in white

1017
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,440
and the burning forests
and brush fires in red.

1018
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,640
The yellow areas are the gas flares,
like these in Siberia.

1019
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,840
And that brings me to the second factor

1020
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,600
that has transformed our relationship
to the Earth.

1021
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,800
The scientific and technological
revolution is a great blessing

1022
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,600
in that it has given us
tremendous benefits

1023
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,720
in areas like medicine
and communications.

1024
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,680
But this new power that we have
also brings a responsibility

1025
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,240
to think about its consequences.

1026
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,680
Here's a formula to think about.

1027
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,440
Old habits plus old technology
have predictable consequences.

1028
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,080
Old habits that are hard to change
plus new technology

1029
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,160
can have dramatically
altered consequences.

1030
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,320
Warfare with spears
and bows and arrows

1031
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,440
and rifles and machine guns,
that's one thing.

1032
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,720
But then a new technology came.

1033
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,760
We have to think differently about war

1034
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,400
because the new technologies
so completely transformed

1035
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,080
the consequences of that old habit

1036
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,400
that we can't just mindlessly continue
the patterns of the past.

1037
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,840
In the same way, we have always
exploited the Earth for sustenance.

1038
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,040
For most of our existence,
we used relatively simple tools.

1039
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,560
The plow, the tractor.

1040
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,840
But even tools like shovels
are different now.

1041
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,880
Shovel used to be this.

1042
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,080
Shovels have gotten bigger.

1043
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,000
And every year, they get more powerful.

1044
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,640
So our ability to have an effect,
in this case on the surface of the Earth,

1045
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,440
is utterly transformed.

1046
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,920
You can say the same thing
about irrigation, which is a great thing.

1047
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:19,240
But when we divert rivers
without considering the consequences,

1048
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,160
then sometimes rivers no longer
reach the sea.

1049
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,240
There were two rivers in Central Asia

1050
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,840
that were used
by the former Soviet Union

1051
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,440
for irrigating cotton fields unwisely.

1052
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,520
The Aral Sea was fed by them.

1053
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,280
It used to be the fourth largest
inland sea in the world.

1054
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,400
When I went there,
I saw this strange sight

1055
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,480
of an enormous fishing fleet
resting in the sand.

1056
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,640
This is the canal that the fishing
industry desperately tried to build

1057
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,720
to get to the receding shoreline.

1058
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,680
Making mistakes in our dealings
with nature can have

1059
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,440
bigger consequences now

1060
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,320
because our technologies are often
bigger than the human scale.

1061
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,200
When you put them all together,
they've made us a force of nature.

1062
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,880
And this is also a political issue.

1063
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,440
This is a computer map of the world

1064
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,880
that distorts to show the relative
contributions to global warming.

1065
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,920
In our country, we are responsible
for more than all of South America,

1066
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,400
all of Africa, all of the Middle East,

1067
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,400
all of Asia, all combined.

1068
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,440
The per capita average in Africa, India,
China, Japan, EU, Russia.

1069
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,640
There's where we are.
Way, way above everyone else.

1070
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,440
If you take population into account,
it's a little bit different.

1071
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,480
China's playing a bigger role,
so is Europe.

1072
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,200
But we are still by all odds
the largest contributor.

1073
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,840
And so it is up to us to look
at how we think about it,

1074
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,480
because our way of thinking
is the third and final factor

1075
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,080
that transforms our relationship
to the Earth.

1076
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,440
If a frog jumps into
a pot of boiling water,

1077
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,800
it jumps right out again
because it senses the danger.

1078
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,040
But the very same frog,

1079
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,360
if it jumps into a pot of lukewarm water

1080
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,720
that is slowly brought to a boil,

1081
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,840
will just sit there and it won't move.

1082
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,160
It'll just sit there, even as the
temperature continues to go up and up.

1083
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,720
It'll stay there, until...
Until it's rescued.

1084
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,920
It's important to rescue the frog.

1085
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,080
But the point is this.

1086
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,160
Our collective nervous system is like
that frog's nervous system.

1087
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,480
It takes a sudden jolt sometimes
before we become aware of a danger.

1088
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,640
If it seems gradual,
even if it really is happening quickly,

1089
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,120
we're capable of just sitting there
and not responding.

1090
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:41,840
And not reacting.

1091
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,440
<i>I don't remember a time
when I was a kid</i>

1092
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,440
<i>when summertime didn't mean
working with tobacco.</i>

1093
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,880
<i>It was just... I used to love it.
It was during that period</i>

1094
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,600
<i>when working with the guys on the farm</i>

1095
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,480
<i>seemed like fun to me.</i>

1096
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:10,280
Starting in 1964,
with the Surgeon General's report,

1097
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,160
the evidence was laid out
on the connection

1098
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,240
between smoking cigarettes
and lung cancer.

1099
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,360
<i>We kept growing tobacco.</i>

1100
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,360
<i>Nancy was almost 10 years
older than me,</i>

1101
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,000
<i>and there were only the two of us.</i>

1102
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,160
<i>She was my protector</i>

1103
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,680
<i>and my friend at the same time.</i>

1104
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
<i>She started smoking
when she was a teenager</i>

1105
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,920
<i>and never stopped.</i>

1106
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,600
<i>She died of lung cancer.</i>

1107
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,080
<i>That's one of the ways
you don't want to die.</i>

1108
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,320
<i>The idea that we had been</i>

1109
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,280
<i>part of that economic pattern</i>

1110
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,120
<i>that produced the cigarettes,</i>

1111
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,080
<i>that produced the cancer,</i>

1112
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,760
<i>it was so...</i>

1113
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,920
<i>It was so painful on so many levels.</i>

1114
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:29,360
<i>My father, he had grown tobacco
all his life. He stopped.</i>

1115
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,080
<i>Whatever explanation</i>

1116
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,200
<i>had seemed to make sense in the past,
just didn't cut it anymore.</i>

1117
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,320
<i>He stopped it.</i>

1118
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,000
<i>It's just human nature to take time
to connect the dots. I know that.</i>

1119
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,880
<i>But I also know that there can be
a day of reckoning</i>

1120
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,840
<i>when you wish you had connected
the dots more quickly.</i>

1121
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,120
There are three misconceptions in
particular that bedevil our thinking.

1122
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,960
First, isn't there a disagreement
among scientists

1123
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,400
about whether the problem
is real or not?

1124
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,640
Actually, not really.

1125
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,560
There was a massive study
of every scientific article

1126
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:31,120
in a peer-reviewed journal written
on global warming for the last 10 years.

1127
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:35,560
And they took a big sample of 10%,
928 articles.

1128
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,120
And you know the number of those that
disagreed with the scientific consensus

1129
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,600
that we're causing global warming
and that it's a serious problem?

1130
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,560
Out of the 928, zero.

1131
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,320
The misconception that there's
disagreement about the science

1132
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,680
has been deliberately created
by a relatively small group of people.

1133
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,440
One of their internal memos leaked.

1134
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,400
And here's what it said,
according to the press.

1135
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,080
Their objective is to reposition
global warming

1136
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,080
as theory rather than fact.

1137
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,440
This has happened before.

1138
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,760
After the Surgeon General's report.

1139
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,760
One of their memos leaked
40 years ago. Here's what they said.

1140
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,360
"Doubt is our product,

1141
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,520
"since it is the best means of creating
a controversy in the public's mind."

1142
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,880
But have they succeeded?

1143
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,840
You'll remember that there were
928 peer-reviewed articles.

1144
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,800
Zero percent
disagreed with the consensus.

1145
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,280
There was another study of all
the articles in the popular press.

1146
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,000
Over the last 14 years,
they looked at a sample of 636.

1147
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,720
More than half of them said,

1148
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,120
"Well, we're not sure. It could be
a problem, may not be a problem."

1149
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,920
So no wonder people are confused.

1150
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,120
Hey.

1151
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,400
What did you find out?

1152
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,320
Working for who?

1153
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,600
Chief of Staff?

1154
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,680
I'm gonna...

1155
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,960
That's the White House
environment office.

1156
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,920
American Petroleum Institute. It's fair
to say that's the oil and gas lobby.

1157
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,560
Is that fair?

1158
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,320
Totally fair.

1159
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,480
Do a little bit more and see
who his clients were.

1160
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,840
<i>So he was defending
the Exxon Valdez thing.</i>

1161
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,160
Uh, very. Thank you.

1162
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,520
<i>Scientists have
an independent obligation</i>

1163
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,480
<i>to respect and present the truth
as they see it.</i>

1164
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:52,360
<i>Why do you directly contradict yourself</i>

1165
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,040
<i>in the testimony you're giving
about this scientific question?</i>

1166
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,640
<i>The last paragraph in that section
was not a paragraph which I wrote.</i>

1167
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,560
<i>That was added to my testimony.</i>

1168
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,080
<i>If they force you to change
a scientific conclusion,</i>

1169
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,120
<i>it's a form of science fraud by them.</i>

1170
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,360
<i>You know, in the Soviet Union,
ordering scientists</i>

1171
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:16,120
<i>to change their studies to conform
with the ideology...</i>

1172
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,200
<i>I've seen scientists</i>

1173
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,720
<i>who were persecuted,</i>

1174
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,240
<i>ridiculed,</i>

1175
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,720
<i>deprived of jobs, income,</i>

1176
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,920
<i>simply because the facts
they discovered</i>

1177
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,080
<i>led them to an inconvenient truth</i>

1178
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,840
<i>that they insisted on telling.</i>

1179
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,280
<i>He worked for
the American Petroleum Institute.</i>

1180
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,640
And in January of 2001,

1181
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,320
he was put by the president in charge
of environmental policy.

1182
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,560
He received a memo from the EPA

1183
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,200
that warned about global warming

1184
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,640
and he edited. He has no
scientific training whatsoever.

1185
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,240
But he took it upon himself
to overrule the scientist.

1186
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,400
I said, "I want to see
what this guy's handwriting looks like."

1187
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,120
This is the memo from the EPA.
These are his actual pen strokes.

1188
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,920
He says, "No, you can't say this.
This is just speculation."

1189
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,760
This was embarrassing
to the White House,

1190
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,360
so this fellow resigned a few days later.

1191
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,240
And the day after he resigned,
he went to work for Exxon Mobil.

1192
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,600
You know, more than 100 years ago,
Upton Sinclair wrote this.

1193
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,480
That it's difficult to get a man
to understand something

1194
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:48,040
if his salary depends upon
his not understanding it.

1195
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,440
The second misconception.

1196
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,880
Do we have to choose between
the economy and the environment?

1197
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,440
This is a big one.

1198
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,560
Lot of people say we do.

1199
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,760
I was trying to convince
the previous administration,

1200
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,720
the first Bush administration,
to go to the Earth Summit.

1201
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,800
And they organized
a big White House conference

1202
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,680
to say, "Oh, we're on top of this."

1203
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,520
And one of these view graphs
caught my attention.

1204
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,400
And I want to talk to you about it
for a minute.

1205
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,920
Now here is the choice
that we have to make

1206
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,640
according to this group.

1207
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,160
We have here a scales that balances
two different things.

1208
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,800
On one side, we have gold bars.

1209
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,360
Don't they look good?

1210
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,640
I'd just like to have
some of those gold bars.

1211
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:46,040
On the other side of the scales,
the entire planet.

1212
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,040
I think this is a false choice
for two reasons.

1213
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,840
Number one, if we don't have a planet...

1214
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,920
The other reason is that
if we do the right thing,

1215
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,080
then we're gonna create a lot of wealth

1216
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,480
- and we're gonna create a lot of jobs.
- Yes.

1217
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,640
Because doing the right thing
moves us forward.

1218
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:30,440
<i>I've probably given this slide show
1,000 times.</i>

1219
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,400
<i>I would say, at least 1,000 times.</i>

1220
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,800
<i>Nashville to Knoxville
to Aspen and Sundance.</i>

1221
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:47,000
<i>Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Portland, Minneapolis.</i>

1222
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,200
<i>Boston, New Haven, London, Brussels,
Stockholm, Helsinki,</i>

1223
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,400
<i>Vienna, Munich, Italy and Spain</i>

1224
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,280
<i>and China, South Korea, Japan.</i>

1225
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,520
Thank you.

1226
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,520
<i>I guess the thing I've spent more time
on than anything else in this slide show</i>

1227
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,000
<i>is trying to identify</i>

1228
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,480
<i>all those things in people's minds</i>

1229
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,240
<i>that serve as obstacles
to them understanding this.</i>

1230
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,400
<i>And whenever I feel like
I've identified an obstacle,</i>

1231
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,840
<i>I try to take it apart, roll it away.
Move it.</i>

1232
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,080
<i>Demolish it, blow it up.</i>

1233
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,160
<i>I set myself a goal.</i>

1234
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,800
<i>Communicate this real clearly.</i>

1235
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,560
<i>The only way I know to do it</i>

1236
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,240
<i>is city by city,</i>

1237
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,360
<i>person by person,</i>

1238
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,000
<i>family by family.</i>

1239
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,120
- Bye-bye. Thank you again.
- Bye.

1240
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,160
<i>And I have faith that pretty soon</i>

1241
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,720
<i>enough minds are changed</i>

1242
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,640
<i>that we cross a threshold.</i>

1243
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,880
<i>Let me give you an example</i>

1244
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,040
of the wrong way to balance
the economy and the environment.

1245
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,520
One part of this issue
involves automobiles.

1246
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,080
Japan has mileage standards up here.

1247
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,440
Europe plans to pass Japan.

1248
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,080
Our allies in Australia and Canada
are leaving us behind.

1249
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,080
Here is where we are.

1250
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,640
Now there's a reason for it.

1251
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,400
They say that we can't protect
the environment too much

1252
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,560
without threatening the economy
and threatening the automakers.

1253
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,920
Because automakers in China might
come in and just steal all our markets.

1254
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,560
Well, here is where China's
auto mileage standards are now.

1255
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:02,920
Way above ours.

1256
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,520
We can't sell our cars in China today

1257
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,560
because we don't meet
the Chinese environmental standards.

1258
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,640
California has taken an initiative

1259
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:17,800
to have higher-mileage cars
sold in California.

1260
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,000
Now the auto companies
have sued California

1261
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,480
to prevent this law from taking effect

1262
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,480
because, as they point out,
11 years from now

1263
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,560
this would mean that California
would have to have cars for sale

1264
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,400
that are as efficient 11 years from now

1265
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,200
as China's are today.

1266
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,600
Clearly too onerous a provision
to comply with.

1267
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,560
And is this helping
our companies succeed?

1268
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,800
Well, actually, if you look at
who's doing well in the world,

1269
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,200
it's the companies that are building
more-efficient cars.

1270
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,360
And our companies are in deep trouble.

1271
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,360
Final misconception.

1272
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,200
If we accept that this problem is real,

1273
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,760
maybe it's just too big
to do anything about.

1274
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,960
And, you know, there are a lot of people
who go straight from denial

1275
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,600
to despair

1276
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,560
without pausing
on the intermediate step

1277
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,640
of actually doing something
about the problem.

1278
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,480
And that's what I'd like to finish with.
The fact that we already know

1279
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:19,120
everything we need to know
to effectively address this problem.

1280
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,920
We've got to do a lot of things,
not just one.

1281
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,000
If we use more efficient

1282
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,080
electricity appliances,

1283
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,760
we can save this much off
of the global warming pollution

1284
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,760
that would otherwise be
put into the atmosphere.

1285
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,840
If we use other end-use efficiency,
this much.

1286
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,320
If we have higher mileage cars,
this much.

1287
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,440
And all these begin to add up.
Other transport efficiency,

1288
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,400
renewable technology,

1289
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,520
carbon capture and sequestration.

1290
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,800
A big solution that you're gonna
be hearing a lot more about.

1291
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,560
They all add up,

1292
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:55,920
and pretty soon we are below
our 1970 emissions.

1293
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,120
We have everything we need,

1294
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,160
save perhaps political will.

1295
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:06,600
But you know what? In America,
political will is a renewable resource.

1296
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,160
We have the ability to do this.

1297
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,160
<i>Each one of us is
a cause of global warming,</i>

1298
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,880
<i>but each of us can make choices
to change that.</i>

1299
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,120
<i>With the things we buy, the electricity
we use, the cars we drive,</i>

1300
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:27,120
<i>we can make choices to bring
our individual carbon emissions to zero.</i>

1301
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:30,200
The solutions are in our hands.

1302
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,480
We just have to have the determination
to make them happen.

1303
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,160
Are we gonna be left behind
as the rest of the world moves forward?

1304
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,680
All of these nations have ratified Kyoto.

1305
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:45,520
There are only two advanced nations
in the world that have not ratified Kyoto,

1306
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,400
and we are one of them.
The other is Australia.

1307
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,840
Luckily, several states
are taking the initiative.

1308
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,840
The nine northeastern states
have banded together

1309
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,840
on reducing CO2.

1310
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,240
California and Oregon are taking
the initiative.

1311
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,960
Pennsylvania's exercising leadership
on solar power and wind power.

1312
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:09,640
And US cities are
stepping up to the plate.

1313
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,680
One after the other, we have seen

1314
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,240
all of these cities pledge
to take on global warming.

1315
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,120
So what about the rest of us?

1316
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:28,600
Ultimately this question
comes down to this.

1317
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:30,960
Are we capable

1318
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,520
of rising above ourselves
and above histoy?

1319
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,840
Well, the record indicates
that we do have that capacity.

1320
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,440
<i>We established freedom
and self-determination</i>

1321
01:21:41,519 --> 01:21:44,600
<i>in the United States and in France
and then all over the world.</i>

1322
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,280
<i>The same year Lincoln freed America's
slaves, Russia freed its serfs.</i>

1323
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:52,760
<i>Women earned the right to vote, first
in New Zealand, then in Scandinavia</i>

1324
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,400
<i>and it spread from there.</i>

1325
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,760
<i>The entire world defeated fascism</i>

1326
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,920
<i>in both Europe and the Pacific,
simultaneously.</i>

1327
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,400
<i>The moral force for non-violence</i>

1328
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,320
<i>triggered a revolution
that spread to other countries.</i>

1329
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,240
<i>The world supported
Nelson Mandela's victoy</i>

1330
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:10,800
<i>in tearing down the apartheid system.</i>

1331
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,520
<i>Scientists and doctors
from many nations worked together</i>

1332
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,040
<i>to conquer fearsome diseases
like smallpox and polio.</i>

1333
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:22,600
<i>And the two superpowers finally ended
their deadly nuclear arms race.</i>

1334
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,440
<i>We landed on the Moon.</i>

1335
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:27,960
<i>The vey example of what's possible
when we are at our best.</i>

1336
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:30,920
<i>We worked together
to bring down communism.</i>

1337
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:34,719
<i>We have even solved
a global environmental crisis before,</i>

1338
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:37,479
<i>the hole in the stratospheric
ozone layer.</i>

1339
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:40,039
<i>This was said to be
an impossible problem to solve</i>

1340
01:22:40,119 --> 01:22:42,639
<i>because it's
a global environmental challenge</i>

1341
01:22:42,759 --> 01:22:46,439
requiring cooperation
from every nation in the world.

1342
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:48,559
But we took it on.

1343
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:51,879
And the United States took the lead
in phasing out the chemicals

1344
01:22:51,959 --> 01:22:53,759
that caused that problem.

1345
01:22:53,839 --> 01:22:58,439
So now we have to use our political
processes in our democracy,

1346
01:22:58,519 --> 01:23:01,679
and then decide to act together
to solve those problems.

1347
01:23:01,839 --> 01:23:04,839
But we have to have
a different perspective on this one.

1348
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,159
It's different from any problem
we have ever faced before.

1349
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:15,159
<i>You remember that home movie
of the Earth spinning in space?</i>

1350
01:23:16,359 --> 01:23:20,399
<i>One of those spacecraft continuing
on out into the universe,</i>

1351
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:24,479
<i>when it got four billion miles
out in space,</i>

1352
01:23:24,559 --> 01:23:28,119
Carl Sagan said,
"Let's take another picture of the Earth."

1353
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:31,359
You see that pale blue dot?

1354
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:33,359
That's us.

1355
01:23:33,959 --> 01:23:37,279
Everything that has ever happened
in all of human history

1356
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:39,999
has happened on that pixel.

1357
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,039
All the triumphs and all the tragedies.

1358
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,879
All the wars, all the famines.

1359
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:48,319
All the major advances.

1360
01:23:49,839 --> 01:23:51,439
It's our only home.

1361
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:56,559
And that is what is at stake.

1362
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:01,079
Our ability to live

1363
01:24:01,519 --> 01:24:03,039
on planet Earth,

1364
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:06,319
to have a future as a civilization.

1365
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:13,279
<i>I believe this is a moral issue.</i>

1366
01:24:13,999 --> 01:24:16,879
<i>It is your time to seize this issue.</i>

1367
01:24:16,999 --> 01:24:20,999
<i>It is our time to rise again,
to secure our future.</i>

1368
01:24:31,799 --> 01:24:35,919
<i>There's nothing that unusual
about what I'm doing with this.</i>

1369
01:24:37,519 --> 01:24:41,119
<i>What is unusual is that
I had the privilege to be shown it</i>

1370
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:42,759
<i>as a young man.</i>

1371
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:46,799
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Al Gore.</i>

1372
01:24:47,519 --> 01:24:51,559
<i>It's almost as if a window was opened
through which</i>

1373
01:24:51,799 --> 01:24:55,479
<i>the future was very clearly visible.</i>

1374
01:24:56,879 --> 01:24:58,759
<i>"See that?" he said, "See that?</i>

1375
01:25:00,919 --> 01:25:04,359
<i>"That's the future in which you are
going to live your life."</i>

1376
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:28,599
<i>Future generations</i>

1377
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:32,319
<i>may well have occasion
to ask themselves,</i>

1378
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,239
<i>"What were our parents thinking?</i>

1379
01:25:35,319 --> 01:25:39,559
<i>"Why didn't they wake up
when they had a chance?"</i>

1380
01:25:43,719 --> 01:25:47,919
<i>We have to hear that question
from them, now.</i>
