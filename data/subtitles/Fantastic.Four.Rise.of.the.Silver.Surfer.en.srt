00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:32,003
<i>Last night, the FAA was forced to ground
all aircraft, leaving thousands stranded...</i>

3
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,011
<i>...when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages...</i>

4
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:39,015
<i>...crippled the western United States.
But the big story today...</i>

5
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,052
<i>...the much-anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple...</i>

6
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,750
<i>...Reed Richards and Susan Storm
will take place this Saturday.</i>

7
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,426
Unbelievable. Bizarre anomalies...

8
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,932
...are occurring all over the world,
defying every law of physics...

9
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,629
...and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked.

10
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:04,607
What did you pick? The blue ones
with them little flowers? l like them.

11
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,444
Excuse me, would you mind?

12
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,707
-lt's happening again, isn't it?
-Yeah, sure.

13
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:13,215
No. We're not postponing
anything, not this time.

14
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,720
This will be the wedding you dreamed of.
l won't let anything get in the way.

15
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:23,059
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

16
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,291
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

17
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,460
Which is really pathetic,
when you think about it.

18
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,970
Dr. Richards, l'm very sorry,
but we're overbooked.

19
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,632
-We do have seats available in coach.
-Okay, here we go.

20
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,175
-Smile!
-Awesome!

21
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,869
Look, Mom!

22
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,811
-Let me get one more.
-That should be fine.

23
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,587
That's my seat.

24
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,321
Sorry.

25
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,262
Excuse me.

26
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:22,185
What if we get an endorsement
from an airline? Get us a private jet?

27
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,119
l think we have enough
endorsement deals.

28
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:31,161
That's funny. Seriously, Reed, it could
help subsidize your little inventions.

29
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,663
-No, thanks.
-Excuse me.

30
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,795
-Consider it. Talk to you later.
-Where are you going?

31
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,968
l don't fly coach.

32
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,581
l hope it rains.

33
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,155
<i>The snowfall came with no warning...</i>

34
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,023
<i>...and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow.</i>

35
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,030
<i>In Japan, some suggest
the solidification of the bay...</i>

36
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,566
<i>...was due to underwater
volcanic activity...</i>

37
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,432
...though no such activity
has been reported in the area.

38
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,867
<i>Scientists have ruled out
global warming...</i>

39
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,205
<i>...as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe.</i>

40
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,212
<i>With scientists unable
to explain the events...</i>

41
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,715
<i>...some are wondering
if the hand of God is at work.</i>

42
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,377
<i>In other news, Reed Richards
and Susan Storm's wedding...</i>

43
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,250
<i>...has Manhattan all abuzz.</i>

44
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,190
<i>The guest list includes
many of New York's power elite.</i>

45
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,196
Hey, honey.

46
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,925
The city's charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed...

47
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:46,299
...during that armored-car robbery.
l only remember two cars getting thrown.

48
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,101
Reed.

49
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,606
All right. l'm putting it away.

50
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,306
You were saying?

51
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,883
l have a fitting in half an hour.
The musicians after that.

52
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:04,716
l haven't picked out the place settings
or the flowers. There's too much to do.

53
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,918
Don't worry about it. Between
the two of us, we'll get it all done.

54
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,323
And what were you doing
when l walked in?

55
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,260
-lnputting my to-do list.
-Really?

56
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,829
-Scout's honor.
-Hey, guys.

57
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,631
New uniforms showed up.
What do you think?

58
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,241
l think there's no way
we're wearing that.

59
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,311
What do you have against capitalism?

60
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,277
What's this?

61
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,443
-Just a little hobby of mine.
-Yeah?

62
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,488
Would it make a good toy,
or is it something science-y?

63
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,316
A little of both.

64
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,758
l'm both impressed
and disgusted at that.

65
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,093
Yeah. Sue says l'm addicted to it.

66
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,102
l wonder why she'd say that.

67
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,662
Hey, Johnny.

68
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:59,770
Keep it quiet, but l've cross-referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances.

69
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:04,282
They're caused by cosmic radiation, not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers.

70
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,317
Wow, that's really boring.

71
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,548
Listen, l have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about.

72
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,685
Yeah, of course.

73
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,987
Your bachelor party.

74
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,653
No. Seriously, Johnny.

75
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,858
John. Focus-testing showed Johnny
skewed a little young.

76
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,762
Seriously, Johnny, no bachelor party.
lt's just not my kind of thing.

77
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:33,578
Then do it for Ben. lt means a lot
to the big guy. You'll break his heart.

78
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,747
He does have some
sort of rocklike heart.

79
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,883
l have too much to do
before the wedding.

80
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,315
l think Sue might have
a problem with it.

81
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,047
You know what Sue
would have a problem with?

82
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,885
lf somebody told her
you were investigating...

83
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,357
...global disturbances
and cosmic radiation...

84
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:55,525
...instead of focusing on the wedding,
like you promised.

85
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,536
-A bachelor party could be fun.
-Yes!

86
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,704
But no exotic dancers.

87
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,163
-This is it?
-l don't know anybody here.

88
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,232
l would have invited your friends,
but you don't have any.

89
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,233
Hey!

90
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,231
Johnny, we had a deal.

91
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,103
They're not exotic dancers.

92
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,101
They're just hot.

93
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:19,579
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?
That's so awesome.

94
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,747
Wow, you're really cute.

95
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,154
l'll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you've got.

96
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,919
No problem.

97
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,272
Good evening,
and welcome to the Baxter....

98
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,018
Could l help you?
No, you can't use that elev--

99
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,184
Ms. Storm will be with your shortly.

100
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,693
Hello?

101
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,326
Thanks, Roberta.

102
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,632
May l help you?

103
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,832
-We're here to see Dr. Richards.
-He's not here. Can l help you?

104
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,137
Yes. You can take me
to see Dr. Richards.

105
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,042
Okay.

106
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,022
Sorry.

107
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:39,387
When the universe began, it was
no bigger than a marble. Then, bang!

108
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,261
lt exploded.
And in a trillionth of a second...

109
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,665
...it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know.

110
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,198
Wow, you're really smart.

111
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,673
Thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

112
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,006
l love this song. Wanna dance?

113
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,579
-No, l don't.
-Yes, you do.

114
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,683
-Honestly.
-Come on, you'll be great.

115
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,479
l don't want to embarrass you guys.

116
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,864
Just loosen up. Have some fun.

117
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,262
That's it.

118
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,300
Yeah.

119
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,097
That's it.

120
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,314
-Guy really knows how to loosen up.
-You're not kidding.

121
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,278
There he is.

122
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,914
Yes.

123
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,976
Unfortunately.

124
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,355
For him.

125
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,457
Shall we?

126
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,428
l think it might be clobbering time.

127
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,830
Sue. What are you...?

128
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,110
General Hager.

129
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,145
Let's talk somewhere private.

130
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,850
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

131
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:43,449
l was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to....

132
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,182
This was Johnny's idea.
l just went along.

133
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,355
How does Reed know the general?

134
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,830
A few years back, the guy was pushing
a new missile-defense system.

135
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,834
Reed testified that the
technology wouldn't work.

136
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,700
l'm here on direct orders from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

137
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:06,140
Personally, l don't like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian.

138
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,713
Especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much.

139
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,743
Always a pleasure
to see you too, general.

140
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,386
What can l do for you?

141
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,580
As you may know, there've
been unusual occurrences.

142
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,921
Officially, we've downplayed their
significance, but we're concerned...

143
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:28,031
...these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security.

144
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,567
These were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago.

145
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,838
-What is it?
-We hoped Dr. Richards could tell us.

146
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:42,180
l'm afraid l've never
seen anything like it. Ben?

147
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,847
l would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

148
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,714
lt's giving off its own energy.

149
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,713
Take a look at this.

150
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,055
These have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world.

151
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,527
Field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters.

152
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,362
To find out what this is about, we need
a way to locate and intercept that object.

153
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,473
A sensor could be tied into
the Baxter Building's satellite grid.

154
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,200
We can pinpoint the location
of the object.

155
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:16,872
-Good. You'll build the sensor for us--
-l'm afraid l can't.

156
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,213
What?

157
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,812
l'm getting married this Saturday.
l just don't have the time.

158
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:30,623
Richards, your country
needs your help.

159
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,157
Call Professor Jeff Wagner.

160
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,268
He's head of the
Physics Department at Brown.

161
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,994
l expected more, Richards.

162
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,301
Even from you.

163
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,457
John Storm,
Fantastic Four lncorporated.

164
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,917
-Ever done any modeling?
-Not interested.

165
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,427
-You got an amazing complexion.
-Not interested.

166
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:11,597
Wow, and you just walked away.

167
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,102
l was definitely still talking.

168
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:18,004
l can't believe you just turned down
a science project.

169
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,779
They can build a sensor without me.

170
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,507
The most important thing right now
is our wedding.

171
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,651
No postponements. No interruptions.

172
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,343
Thank you.

173
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,717
And, look, about what you saw
back at the bar....

174
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,883
Don't worry about it. l know you.

175
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,826
l'm glad you had fun.

176
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,063
Thank you.

177
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,331
Besides...

178
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,836
...it was nothing compared to what
l did at my bachelorette party.

179
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,199
Talk about wild.

180
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,068
Wild?

181
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,052
Come on.

182
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,690
Hey, what are you doing up here?

183
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,525
Nothing. Just needed some air.

184
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:47,220
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

185
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,300
l'm guessing Susie
doesn't know anything about it.

186
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,596
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

187
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,830
That is, they would be if l had any.

188
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,770
Look, don't tell Johnny.

189
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,715
-Don't tell Johnny what?
-Great.

190
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,146
-Are you building that thing?
-No.

191
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,411
lf Sue finds out, you'll get
an invisible kick in the nuts.

192
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,421
-Hey, hey. We're keeping this quiet.
-l know.

193
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,149
Don't worry.

194
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,953
lt's the wedding of the century.
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

195
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,429
<i>...Mr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman...</i>

196
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,499
<i>...will try again to tie the knot today
in a ceremony in New York.</i>

197
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,817
-Look at these parasites.
-l know, it's unbelievable.

198
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,476
Have they no shame?

199
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,248
Hey! Hey, listen! Listen, everybody!

200
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,523
This is a very special day for my sister,
probably the most important of her life.

201
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,691
So l just want to say to you guys,
please respect our privacy.

202
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,734
Come on, Johnny.

203
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:02,495
Just kidding. We're auctioning off
the exclusive wedding photos...

204
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:07,008
...to the highest bidder, so go online
and place your bids. Thank you.

205
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,509
Johnny, are you planning--?

206
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,308
So, what's it take to date
the Human Torch?

207
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,715
-Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.
-Thank you.

208
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,099
-Are you all right?
-How are you?

209
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,570
lnvitation, sir?

210
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,506
l should be on that list.

211
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,509
-Name?
-Stan Lee.

212
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,147
Yeah, nice try, buddy.

213
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,374
-No, really. l'm Stan Lee.
-Nice try.

214
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,455
This isn't how l imagined it.

215
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,881
lt never is.

216
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,758
No, Alicia, it just doesn't feel right.

217
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,095
Sweetie...

218
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,497
...l think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding-day jitters.

219
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,404
lt's more than that.
ls my life always gonna be a circus?

220
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,740
Do we really want to raise kids
in all this?

221
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,905
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

222
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,208
Ben and l aren't normal...

223
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,480
...but we don't let it
get in the way of us being happy.

224
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,614
Do you love Reed?

225
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,192
More than l've ever loved anyone.

226
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,697
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

227
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,099
Thank you.

228
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,010
Okay.

229
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,783
-Oh, great.
-What?

230
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,146
l've got a zit.

231
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,619
-Can't you put makeup on it?
-No, no, l got it.

232
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,885
Crisis averted.

233
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,961
Now all l have to do is concentrate
on the area for the next eight hours.

234
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,429
Reed, come on. You're gonna miss
your own wedding.

235
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,435
Just a minute.

236
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,237
Almost done.

237
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,475
General, l'm putting
the sensor online now.

238
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,317
There. lf there's a surge in cosmic
radiation anywhere, you'll know.

239
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,657
<i>Let's hope so. We've gotten
reports of two more craters.</i>

240
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,525
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

241
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,167
All right. Just linking it to my PDA.

242
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,560
-Reed.
-And that's it.

243
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,802
Good, that's great.
Now shave and put on your tux.

244
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,443
You're getting married
and you look like a bum.

245
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,602
Absolutely.

246
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,772
What?

247
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,310
l'm getting married.

248
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,156
Oh, jeez.

249
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,388
l'm getting married.

250
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,834
l heard of getting cold feet....

251
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,672
Okay.

252
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,906
Hey, Johnny.

253
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,343
Does that amaze anyone else?
How did she know it was me?

254
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,679
To be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

255
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,750
-You're late.
-Let's not make today about me.

256
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,515
lt's Reed and Sue's big day.

257
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,353
Let's give them the attention
for a change.

258
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,757
Don't do that.

259
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,429
-Okay, you're perfect.
-You're perfect.

260
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,671
l'll see you upstairs.

261
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,171
Bye, Johnny.

262
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,909
So seems like you and Alicia are
doing well. Annoyingly so, in fact.

263
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,242
Yeah, l'm a lucky guy.

264
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,248
Yeah, you are.

265
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,887
Question for you, though:

266
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,784
How do you guys...?

267
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,157
-None of your business!
-Okay, l'm just concerned.

268
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,662
l'd hate to find out
she was killed in a rock slide.

269
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,960
l'll show you a rock slide!

270
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,217
What are you?

271
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,735
Thank you.

272
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,469
Johnny?

273
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,102
You shouldn't tease him so much.

274
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,903
lt was a joke.

275
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:10,013
l don't know, l think it bothers you
to see him really happy and in love.

276
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,308
l think you're jealous.

277
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,284
You think l'm jealous?
Have you seen the women l've dated?

278
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,218
No.

279
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,160
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

280
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,626
Hey. lt's the bride of stretchy man.

281
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,633
-Don't start.
-Don't listen to him. You look gorgeous.

282
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,464
We'll see you out there, sweetie.

283
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,971
-Come on. We're on.
-Okay. Okay.

284
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,479
You don't look completely
ridiculous in that dress.

285
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:48,347
ls that obnoxious-brother talk
for ''You look kind of nice''?

286
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,951
You look beautiful.

287
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,053
Thank you.

288
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,308
Dad would be proud.

289
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,638
Yeah.

290
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,534
Reed, shut your cell phone off.

291
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,938
Actually, this is a--

292
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,251
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to....

293
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,652
Sue and Reed,
congratulations on your wedding!

294
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,786
Where was l? Oh, yeah.

295
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:43,128
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today to join this couple...

296
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,065
...Reed Richards and Susan Storm,
together...

297
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,733
...in the bond of holy...

298
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,008
...matrimony.

299
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,446
l can't believe you
brought that to our wedding.

300
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,586
l know, but there's a good reason.

301
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,313
-We have to do this quickly.
-That's romantic.

302
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,452
-Should l continue?
-Yes, please.

303
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:13,320
-There are many kinds of love.
-Could you skip to the end, please?

304
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,489
-Reed.
-Excuse me?

305
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,272
-What happened?
-What's going on?

306
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,419
We've lost power!
We're going down! We're going down!

307
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:44,986
lt's too late.

308
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,962
-Pull up!
-l'm trying! l'm trying!

309
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,348
Ben!

310
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,704
-Johnny.
-This is Dolce.

311
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,738
Flame on!

312
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,886
Man, he's fast.

313
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,873
That is cool.

314
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,816
-Hey, taxi!
-Oh, man!

315
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,740
Showoff.

316
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,299
Time to end this.

317
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,443
Can we talk?

318
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,156
Okay, you win.

319
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,626
Flame on! Come on!

320
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,863
Flame on!

321
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,254
Hey.

322
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,173
Your herald summons you.

323
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,144
Another world awaits.

324
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,950
Let it be done quickly.

325
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,253
lt looked like a man, but completely
covered in silver, and it flew this, like...

326
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,090
...surfboard-type thing.
l know that sounds crazy.

327
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,256
Oh, no, not at all.

328
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:46,369
Did you follow the shiny man to
Lollipop Land or the Rainbow Junction?

329
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,938
-l know what l saw.
-Thank you. lt's all right, Johnny.

330
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:54,769
Whatever this thing is, it has the ability
to convert matter and energy.

331
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,777
So it caused the anomalies?

332
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,883
lt seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself...

333
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:04,454
...randomly affecting matter.
Evidently, this entity, this...

334
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,458
...Silver Surfer...

335
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,559
...didn't want to be detected.
lt destroyed the sensor.

336
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,995
-lt knew it was being monitored?
-And traced it back here.

337
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,101
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

338
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,339
Are you feeling okay?

339
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,409
Yeah. l just.... l gotta walk this off.

340
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,841
We must destroy it
before it attacks again.

341
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,352
Richards, find me
another way to track it.

342
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,756
Sue, l am so sorry.

343
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,296
l didn't tell you, because l
didn't want you to worry.

344
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,333
l'm not mad you built the sensor.
You did the right thing.

345
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,764
Oh, great.

346
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,301
l wasn't finished.

347
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,438
Okay. Sorry. Please continue.

348
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,878
This proves what l've been saying.

349
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,881
Could you drop the force field?

350
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,452
We can't even-- Sorry.

351
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,383
Even our wedding
turns into World War lll.

352
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,654
l know. But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

353
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,731
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

354
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,766
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

355
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,340
l'm gonna go check on Johnny.

356
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,213
Johnny?

357
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,298
Hey, are you all right, pal?

358
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,098
Are you all right?

359
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,365
Johnny?

360
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,168
Johnny, are you okay?

361
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:09,837
l don't know. l've been feeling really
strange since my run-in with surfer boy.

362
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,608
Maybe we should get you checked out.

363
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,350
-Why did you do that?
-l didn't do anything!

364
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,682
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

365
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,622
Oh, my God, Sue! Just--

366
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,193
Just hang on! l'll get you, okay?

367
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,761
Flame on!

368
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,267
Hey, watch it.

369
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,704
Reed!

370
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,138
Reed! Reed!

371
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,038
-Help!
-Sue?

372
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,736
l'm on fire!

373
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,077
-Sue! What's going on?
-l'm on fire!

374
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,241
-You're on fire!
-You think?

375
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,910
-Hold on!
-Pull me in!

376
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,617
Hey, it's the Human Torch!

377
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,249
Johnny!

378
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,794
-l'm not Johnny!
-Sue, how did this happen?

379
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,762
l touched Johnny, and then this.

380
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,334
-Where is Johnny?
-Here.

381
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,630
Try it again.

382
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,838
-Nice.
-There you go.

383
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,172
Hey, get out of there.

384
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,472
Sue, your clothes.

385
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,785
Why does this always happen to me?

386
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,513
All of Sue's results are normal.

387
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,453
But Johnny's....

388
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,819
Johnny's are what?

389
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:34,530
Your encounter with the Surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux.

390
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,935
ls that bad?

391
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,769
lt caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

392
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,534
-l'd like to run more tests and--
-Want a volunteer?

393
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,109
-No, no, hey!
-No, no, no!

394
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,974
No, no, hey! This is serious!

395
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,706
l just wanted to give him a hug.

396
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,111
We don't know the extent
of his condition.

397
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,877
lt could be progressive.

398
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,987
-lt could be fun.
-No, Ben!

399
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,816
Ben!

400
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,688
Hey. Hey, it's me! l'm back!

401
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,635
Oh, my God!

402
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,165
Come on!
We just said this is serious!

403
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,832
Oh, yeah, serious.

404
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,975
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

405
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,413
-Hey, not bad.
-lncredible.

406
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,181
-You better be able to fix this!
-l'm right on it.

407
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,383
-Ben, stop it!
-l see why you like that.

408
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,390
Oh, no, no, no.

409
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,366
Crap.

410
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,697
That's not funny. What am l
supposed to do in the meantime?

411
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,533
Just try to keep
your distance from us.

412
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:56,374
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal!

413
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,021
<i>My inside sources tell me
unlucky bride-to-be Sue Storm...</i>

414
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,957
<i>...turned invisible
and is staying that way...</i>

415
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,927
<i>...after yesterday's
embarrassing fiasco.</i>

416
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,865
<i>Next, the Invisible Woman's
greatest fashion blunders...</i>

417
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,733
<i>...and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist Reed Richards.</i>

418
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,442
Why do you keep watching this?
Just ignore it.

419
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,805
l can't ignore it, Reed.
There's no getting away from it!

420
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,108
-l believe there is.
-How?

421
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,312
See? No answer.

422
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,719
Yes, there is.

423
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,886
What if, after this crisis is over...

424
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,896
-...we leave it all behind?
-What are you talking about?

425
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,400
We move out of the Baxter Building.

426
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,062
l'll take a teaching position
somewhere.

427
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,071
Get back to my research.

428
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:02,906
The two of us will live our lives
and raise a family, like normal people.

429
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,980
You would do that?

430
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,982
Nothing is more important to me
than our future together.

431
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,751
Oh, thank you.

432
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,122
What about Ben and Johnny?

433
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,424
They'll understand.

434
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:26,161
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

435
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,271
Let's not mention it to them yet.

436
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:33,308
Johnny's got enough to worry about
as it is, with his power problems.

437
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,867
You've been busy, my friend.

438
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,905
Your talents are impressive.

439
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,005
Can you understand what l'm saying?

440
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:47,412
Together, we could be unstoppable.

441
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,718
Anything would be ours for the taking.

442
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,017
All that you know is at an end.

443
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,020
What do you mean by that?

444
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,096
Wait! l said, wait!

445
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:29,284
They're breaking up the team.
Reed and Sue, l overheard them.

446
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,190
They want a nice, normal,
boring-ass life.

447
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,455
-No more Fantastic Four.
-Well...

448
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,964
...what do we do?
Keep going, just the two of us?

449
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,568
And call ourselves what?
The Dynamic Duo?

450
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,803
When were they gonna tell us?

451
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,339
They'll tell you when they're ready.

452
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,340
lt's their decision, not yours.

453
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,605
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

454
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,613
Guys.

455
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,283
We've got a serious problem.

456
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:01,023
l cross-referenced the Surfer's radiation
through every astronomical database.

457
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:04,661
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

458
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,855
-He's been to all these planets?
-And now they're lifeless.

459
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,328
Barren. Some even shattered.

460
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,335
Everywhere the Surfer goes,
eight days later, the planet dies.

461
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,606
How are we gonna stop him?

462
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,041
We don't even know where he is.

463
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,881
What about the craters?

464
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,890
They appear in a numerical sequence.

465
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:37,389
The last crater was formed
in Greenland...

466
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,956
...so the next in the sequence
should be...

467
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,031
...latitude 51 degrees,
30 minutes north...

468
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,661
...longitude zero degrees,
seven minutes west.

469
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,376
When he surfaces, move the fight
away from the crowd.

470
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,647
He's too fast to contain.
When l see silver, l'm hitting him!

471
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,884
You can't do that. We stick to the plan
and work as a team.

472
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,652
Oh, we're a team now?
News to me.

473
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,662
-What are you talking about?
-You know what.

474
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,094
We were gonna tell you.

475
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,895
-When? When you moved our stuff out?
-Johnny, this isn't a good time.

476
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,903
Kid's got a point, Reed.
You should have told us.

477
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,405
That's enough!
We'll talk about this later.

478
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,170
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

479
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,513
lt's a whirlpool!

480
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,013
Oh, my God.

481
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,953
What is that?

482
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,214
Get out! Get out!

483
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,063
Don't let go!

484
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,148
-Move!
-Come on! Go!

485
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,930
No, Johnny!

486
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,418
Guys? What are you doing?

487
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,462
Ben! Lift it higher!

488
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,192
l'll try.

489
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,525
Sue!

490
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,508
Stay back,
before you get somebody killed.

491
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,741
Oh, my God.

492
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,268
What the hell was that?

493
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:44,737
We'll make adjustments.
Next time, we'll be ready.

494
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,502
Next time? There's no next time.

495
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,946
You can't handle this alone.
l'm bringing in help.

496
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:56,143
Bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger.

497
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,810
No more than you already have.

498
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:04,753
Victor?

499
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,623
What's the matter?
Afraid of ghosts?

500
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,431
-Look out!
-Don't move!

501
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,164
Since you're a ghost,
you won't mind if l break your neck.

502
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,240
-Let him go.
-You know who that is?

503
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,842
Victor von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

504
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:28,909
Ben, let him go.

505
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:33,953
How is this possible?

506
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,183
How are you still alive?

507
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,959
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

508
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,795
Von Doom's made contact with the
alien. He's got valuable information.

509
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,305
lnformation that might just
help save the planet.

510
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,637
Now let's be clear about this...

511
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,705
...shall we? l hate you.

512
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:58,974
All of you.

513
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:04,650
But the world's at stake and we
need to work together to survive.

514
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:09,486
General, we know firsthand, you trust
Victor and you're gonna regret it.

515
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:14,097
So far, the only one l've regretted
trusting here is you, Richards.

516
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,232
Reed, don't agree to this.

517
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,107
Let's see what he's got.

518
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:28,836
l made a detailed recording
of our little encounter.

519
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,505
<i>All that you know is at an end.</i>

520
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,346
Well?

521
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,047
l like the part where
he knocks you on your ass.

522
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:46,527
Look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me.

523
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,500
There? See what happened?

524
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:57,569
The energy was channeled through him,
but it originated from his board.

525
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:02,144
lf we can separate him from the board,
we can cut off his power completely.

526
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,940
-That's what we have to do.
-How?

527
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:08,083
lf l knew that,
l wouldn't need you people, would l?

528
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,754
You two should
get started right away.

529
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,423
l'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

530
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,266
l'll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up.

531
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,937
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

532
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:39,810
You got me. Things were simpler
when l could just whale on the guy.

533
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,848
What's he doing? A fire.

534
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,487
Look at that.

535
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,786
l'll pay for that.

536
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:54,958
l'll tell you, Ben, l'm starting
to feel like a complete screw-up.

537
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,930
Hey, hey, you're not
a complete screw-up.

538
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,659
Thank you.

539
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:03,772
Look, kid, it's out of our hands.
lt's up to the eggheads now.

540
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:08,574
You think Reed's right about
the whole end-of-the-world thing?

541
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,509
He's never been wrong
about this kind of thing before.

542
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,750
You know, l'm not exactly
a deep kind of guy.

543
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,479
Really?

544
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,150
But if Reed's right, and this is it...

545
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:27,090
...how do you want
to spend your last few minutes?

546
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:30,489
Part of me would like
to go out fighting.

547
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,701
But the truth is...

548
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,034
...l'd like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding Alicia.

549
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,770
That sounds pretty good.

550
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:46,382
l mean, not the ''holding Alicia'' thing.
She's your girlfriend, not mine.

551
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:49,608
Want nothing to do with her.
Not to say she's not attractive.

552
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:53,222
She's very attractive.
She's so attractive.

553
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,622
Even with the-- l can't think of
a guy that wouldn't want to--

554
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,891
What l meant...

555
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,692
...was that it's nice
to have somebody.

556
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:09,067
Well, you got me, pal.

557
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,153
How's it going?

558
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,154
l can't find a link.

559
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,856
-lt'll be all right.
-No, it won't!

560
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,725
The whole world's
counting on me, and l just....

561
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,492
Reed, you're gonna find the answer.

562
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,259
-You always do.
-Thanks, Sue.

563
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,233
-You just need to relax.
-Yeah, right.

564
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:45,205
You do. Reed, you need to relax.

565
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,036
Take a deep breath.

566
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,576
Slower.

567
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,840
There you go.

568
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,308
Come on. Again.

569
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:02,550
See? l can already
feel your pulse slowing down.

570
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,386
-Do you remember that time--?
-A pulse.

571
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,028
A tachyon pulse.

572
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,729
l love you.

573
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,905
l'm glad l could help.

574
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,952
<i>So exactly how does this thing work?</i>

575
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,223
When we activate the field,
it'll separate him from his board...

576
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,459
-...making him powerless.
-Like a fish in a net.

577
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,593
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

578
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,463
-ln theory, anyway.
-How long until it's operational?

579
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,674
-Three hours.
-Three hours.

580
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,744
l can only go so fast,
since l'm working by myself.

581
00:51:56,913 --> 00:52:00,610
-What do you need to make this happen?
-There are a couple of things.

582
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,685
Do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing?

583
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,128
What are you doing?

584
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,997
-Don't you knock?
-You're supposed to be helping Reed.

585
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,531
Tell him not to worry.

586
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:25,300
l'll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him.

587
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:33,349
-Anything else?
-How'd you do it?

588
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,649
How did you come back?

589
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,185
lt scares you, doesn't it?

590
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,652
The things l can do.

591
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,293
Did you know l could create
a force field inside someone's body...

592
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,435
...and expand it until they explode?

593
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,967
Give it your best shot.

594
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,136
Just get back to the lab.

595
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,846
Mr. Storm?

596
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,548
We're heading to intercept the Surfer
in 1 0 minutes, with or without you.

597
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:20,390
Were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

598
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,199
That was a joke. l was joking.

599
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,364
Why are you so down on me?
You don't even know me.

600
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,008
l know you very well.
l read your personality profile.

601
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,014
Confident. Reckless. lrresponsible.

602
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,480
Self-obsessed,
bordering on narcissism.

603
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,451
Okay, so you do know me.

604
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,988
All l've seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed.

605
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,517
Okay.

606
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:53,756
l've been a little off my game lately.

607
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,095
This is not a game.

608
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,613
-Sir, he's in position north of here.
-Good.

609
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,717
-General, give us a one-mile perimeter.
-Forget it, Richards.

610
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:19,150
You had your shot and you blew it.
This is a military operation now.

611
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,587
Jam the signal, get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

612
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,922
-You don't understand.
-No, you don't understand.

613
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,894
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks.

614
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,034
l'm the quarterback.
You're on my team.

615
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,728
Got it?

616
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:39,764
But l guess you never played football
in high school, did you, Richards?

617
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,310
No, you're right, l didn't.

618
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,180
l stayed in and studied,
like a good little nerd.

619
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,778
And fifteen years later...

620
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,820
...l'm one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century.

621
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,251
l'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

622
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,653
And the jock who played quarterback
in high school...

623
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,790
...is right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

624
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,996
And l say he's not gonna
get a damn thing...

625
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,831
...unless he does exactly
what l tell him to...

626
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,941
...and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect.

627
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,819
Give him what he wants.

628
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,980
l am so hot for you right now.

629
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,786
-Me too.

630
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:45,340
This is it.

631
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:50,338
You have your coordinates. Set up
your posts and rendezvous back here.

632
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,722
First squad, move out!

633
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:41,223
Hey. You scared me there, Smokey.
Look at you. You're cute.

634
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,600
Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo Boo.

635
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,232
Overgrown furball.

636
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,639
<i>-What's our status?
-Yeah. I'm good to go.</i>

637
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,908
-Same here.
-Almost there.

638
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:13,586
Guys?

639
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,796
<i>-We have a problem.
-What's wrong?</i>

640
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,228
He's here.

641
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,996
<i>Get out of there, right now!</i>

642
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,326
Why are you destroying our planet?

643
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,222
l have no choice.

644
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,367
-Sue!
-Wait!

645
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,733
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

646
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,340
There's always a choice.

647
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,335
Not always.

648
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,138
Why are you trying to destroy us?

649
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,146
l am not the Destroyer.

650
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,850
Come on, Richards.
Jam the damn signal.

651
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,651
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

652
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,359
<i>-Fire one over the top.
-Roger, out.</i>

653
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,070
-Open fire.
-Open fire.

654
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,337
Open fire! Repeat, open fire!

655
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,047
Fall back! Fall back!

656
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,087
-Let me just--
-No, wait!

657
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,495
Reed.

658
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,191
Come on, Sue.

659
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,734
All right, it's up.

660
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,998
Reed.

661
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:06,300
Got him.

662
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:35,434
Not so tough now, are you?

663
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,980
Victor! Stay back!

664
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,347
You're the quarterback.

665
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,369
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

666
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,304
-Perimeter secure!
-Move him out.

667
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,880
-Open the gate!
-Get him to the debriefing room.

668
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:34,956
-We had an agreement.
-Calm down.

669
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,826
The enemy has been captured.

670
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,968
-Where is he?
-Contained.

671
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,263
General?

672
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:43,903
Mr. Sherman.

673
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,874
lf you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

674
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:52,310
-l want to be there for the questioning.
-Not gonna happen.

675
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:56,009
Make sure our guests remain here,
comfortably.

676
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,413
Yes, sir.

677
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,722
General, what about the board?

678
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:05,553
lt's in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal.

679
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,737
There are certain things
l'm not permitted to do...

680
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:28,576
...because they're considered
human-rights violations.

681
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,948
Fortunately, you're not human.

682
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,022
Are we prisoners?

683
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,528
How did that happen?

684
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,725
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

685
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:48,200
l can't imagine what
they're doing to him.

686
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,397
-l say he gets what he deserves.
-How can you say that?

687
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,405
l'm just saying maybe
the general's right about this.

688
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,671
The guy was about to destroy
the planet. He said so himself.

689
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:02,511
lt doesn't make sense. He protected me
from the missile. Why would he do that?

690
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,516
Maybe he thinks you're cute.

691
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,622
There's more going on.
He said he wasn't the Destroyer.

692
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,382
Maybe he lied?

693
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,265
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

694
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,024
But under the radar.

695
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,303
ls there any way
we could get some DVDs...

696
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,374
...or popcorn or something?

697
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,205
-l'll call it in.
-Great.

698
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,279
Thank you. Semper fi.

699
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:35,144
That's the Marine Corps.
We're the Army.

700
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:38,014
Right, l know it's the Army.

701

<i>Captain Raye. Access granted.</i>

702
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,935
General.

703
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,843
Von Doom wants to speak with you.

704
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,484
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

705
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:13,349
Mr. Sherman, let's take a break.

706
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,205
l know you are there.

707
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,145
What's your name?

708
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:51,383
Come on, you must have a name.

709
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,786
l'm Susan.

710
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:03,529
You said you weren't the one trying
to destroy our world. Then who is?

711
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,197
-The one l serve.
-Who do you serve?

712
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:13,805
l'm trying to help you, but to do that,
you have to tell me the truth.

713
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,544
Please.

714
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:30,624
lt is known by many names.
My people called it...

715
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,558
...Galactus...

716
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:35,499
...the Devourer of Worlds.

717
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,541
lt must feed on energy to survive.

718
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,205
Both thermal...

719
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,340
...and organic.

720
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,039
How can you serve this thing?

721
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,707
Because l must.

722
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:54,448
Doesn't it bother you, all the worlds and
innocent people you've helped destroy?

723
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:58,887
My service spares my world...

724
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,254
...and the one l love.

725
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,926
Why did you try to protect me?

726
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:08,901
Because...

727
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:13,600
...you remind me of her.

728
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,885
Could you stop the Destroyer
if you wanted to?

729
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,926
lt is not l who draws the Destroyer here.
lt is the beacon.

730
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,821
What's the beacon?

731
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,125
The source of my power.

732
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,325
Your board?

733
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:47,669
Take joy in the last few hours
you have left...

734
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,073
...for he is nearly here.

735
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:10,590
Well? l helped deliver
the alien to you, as promised.

736
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:13,868
Now it's time to keep
your end of the bargain.

737
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,295
You can do your tests on the board...

738
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:22,175
...but under armed guard
and in my presence only.

739
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:24,745
Absolutely.

740
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:34,323
<i>General Hager. Access granted.</i>

741
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,911
The board draws it here.

742
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,049
How do you fight something
that eats planets?

743
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:04,084
We have to get to the board
and lead it away from here.

744
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,187
Well, do you think the general
will go for that?

745
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,983
He'll have no choice.

746
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,526
Thank you, general.

747
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:15,728
But l'm afraid...

748
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:17,859
...the truth is...

749
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,101
...sometimes Reed is right.

750
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,330
What--?

751
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:40,913
Hey, you. Come here.

752
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,381
Let me ask you something.

753
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,113
Nice.

754
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,919
Crap.

755
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,493
Ben!

756
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,465
Okay, that one hurt.

757
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,772
-Where's Reed?
-Back here.

758
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:22,848
My bad.

759
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,857
Reed.

760
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:40,008
Victor. We've gotta get it back.

761
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,872
We need to get the Surfer.
He understands its power.

762
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:47,243
Even if we break him out of this place,
how are we gonna catch up to Victor?

763
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,974
Leave that to me.

764
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,879
-Halt!
-Stay where you are!

765
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:28,517
Pal, this is the luckiest day
of your life.

766
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:35,059
What the hell is going on?
Where is General Hager?

767
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,390
He's dead.

768
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,293
And if we don't get him out of here,
we'll all be.

769
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,127
Frankie...

770
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:47,301
...the world is literally at stake here.
You have to trust us.

771
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,405
Please.

772
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,480
We need to get to the roof.
lt should be here by now.

773
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:58,745
What should be here?

774
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,954
Holy crap!

775
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:11,724
Reed.

776
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,733
This is by far the coolest thing
you have ever done.

777
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,913
-Hemi?
-Of course.

778
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:30,179
Okay, Ben, you get inside.
Johnny, you fly behind us.

779
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,753
-You gotta let me fly this.
-l'm the best pilot. l should drive.

780
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,981
-Guys.
-You're lucky if it can carry you.

781
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,353
-l can fly circles around you.
-Guys!

782
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:41,688
-Reed.
-Shut up! And move it!

783
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:43,661
l'm driving.

784
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:48,331
Flame on!

785
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,338
Okay. We're now officially enemies
of the United States of America.

786
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,311
Victor is out there somewhere
with unlimited power.

787
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,112
And we've got a giant
intergalactic force...

788
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:10,020
...that's about to destroy our planet in
less than 24 hours. Did l miss anything?

789
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:14,454
l've locked on Victor's energy trail.
He's headed over Southeast China.

790
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,188
Hang on.

791
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:22,133
Norrin Radd.

792
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:28,201
-What?
-l was once called Norrin Radd.

793
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,505
Norrin, we'll need your help
to save our world.

794
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,982
Do you understand?

795
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:40,721
What the hell was that?

796
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:46,923
Victor, the board is drawing the
Destroyer here. You have to give it up.

797
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,889
You know, l've never
been the giving type, Reed.

798
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,896
Hold on!

799
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,210
We're sitting ducks!

800
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,008
We're gonna have to split up!

801
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:10,583
-What?
-This ought to be fun!

802
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:42,447
He's really pissing me off!

803
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,984
Surf's up, metalhead!

804
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:58,256
Victor, only the Surfer can stop the
Destroyer. But he needs his board.

805
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:01,334
-Come and get it, Richards.
-Victor.

806
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,440
Let's all go for a spin!

807
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,677
Norrin!

808
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:52,981
Catch.

809
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,166
Sue!

810
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:15,399
Oh, my God.

811
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,169
Sue. Sue.

812
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,643
-Oh, God.
-Johnny, don't touch her!

813
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,747
Oh, God. Oh, God.

814
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:27,012
You need to find a way
to get the board.

815
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:29,690
-Sue, l....
-Okay.

816
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,295
He is here.

817
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:48,874
Reed?

818
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,069
Reed.

819
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:56,544
Victor's gotta have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

820
01:15:56,718 --> 01:16:00,176
We take it out,
we can separate him from his board.

821
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,617
He's too strong for me.

822
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,791
l could whale on him if l get close...

823
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,860
...but he could see me coming
from a mile away.

824
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,428
lt would take all of us.

825
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:13,066
Or maybe just one of us.

826
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,398
We don't know
what it could do to you.

827
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:23,202
Let's not make this about me.

828
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,598
To quote a friend of mine...

829
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:48,900
...it's clobbering time.

830
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,829
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

831
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:50,962
Not without me.

832
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,798
You've gotta go.

833
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:03,826
Treasure each moment with her.

834
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,090
And tell her she was right.

835
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:10,269
We do have a choice.

836
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,022
Thought you could use a hand.

837
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,169
Oh, my God.

838
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,433
Why isn't it working?

839
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,036
We were too late.

840
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,879
l will no longer serve.

841
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:36,950
This is the end for us both.

842
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,773
Hi.

843
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,969
Hi.

844
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,541
What did l miss?

845
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:20,456
Hey! Hey!

846
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:23,688
-He did it.
-Great job, kid.

847
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,794
Hey, wait. l'm not changing.

848
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:30,536
Hey, that's right.

849
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:32,536
Great.

850
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:36,508
Okay, now you're making
me uncomfortable.

851
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:58,229
So l guess this is it.

852
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,066
We all go our separate ways.

853
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,093
No.

854
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:05,499
-No?
-No.

855
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,106
-No?
-lf not for the team...

856
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,900
...the whole world would be gone.

857
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:13,446
We can't run away from our
responsibilities. This is who we are.

858
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:16,709
-That's what l've been saying.
-What about having a normal life?

859
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,080
-A family?
-Who says you have to be normal...

860
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,051
...to have a family?

861
