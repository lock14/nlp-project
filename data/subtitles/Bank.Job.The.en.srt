00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

2
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:45,124
Another "Terry Leather
Low Mileage" done.

3
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:47,565
Good you're glad, but have you all
sorted out for your wedding tomorrow?

4
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:48,808
Yeah, of course, Terry.

5
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,985
New suit, two buttons,
9 inch fun flaps.

6
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,205
<i>Nice.
Ingrid will like that.</i>

7
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,517
So, you're getting
married tomorrow, Ingrid?

8
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,449
I hope so.

9
00:01:58,549 --> 00:01:59,546
Go on, get off now.

10
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:02,463
Go make yoursef more beautiful
than you already are.

11
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,670
If that's possible.

12
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,870
Terry.

13
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,372
Promise you won't get Eddie
too legless tonight, will you?

14
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:10,575
At his stag do?

15
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:12,675
We're just going round the pub,
couple of pints and a sing song.

16
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,175
Oh, fuck...

17
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:31,678
Fuck it, what are you
trying to do to me, eh?

18
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,285
I've got Jessul's money.

19
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,162
The problem is,
it's tied up in these cars,

20
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:38,167
and you wankers want to
trash the lot of 'em.

21
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,340
Mr. Jessul doesn't care about
your inventory.

22
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,163
Mr. Jessul wants to know
that he's getting paid.

23
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,778
Any day, I swear, Perky.

24
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,298
What did you call me?

25
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:48,157
I called you Perky, Perky!

26
00:02:48,263 --> 00:02:50,531
Everyone calls you Perky,
and him Pinkey.

27
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,363
- Pinkey and Perky?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,291
They're fucking cartoon pigs
on the telly,

29
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,584
what, people call us
that behind our backs?

30
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:58,403
Well, theyre not gonna say it to your face,
aren't they?

31
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:01,199
Well, you just bloody did!

32
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:05,673
Yeah well, you got me rattled.
I'm very intimidated.

33
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:15,041
Don't make us come back again.

34
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:25,423
Not every customer is
a satisfied customer.

35
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,317
What are you doing round
here, my dear Martine?

36
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,487
What are you doing tonight?

37
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,188
Tonight?
Tonight is Eddie's stag do.

38
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:33,622
Taking him out for a drink.
Why?

39
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:35,891
I've got a proposition for you, Terry.

40
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,991
A proposition?

41
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,187
Can you meet me at the Player's Club
before you see the boys?

42
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,691
And I'll fill you in on the details.

43
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,046
Make it 9 o'clock.

44
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:49,205
- Morning, Gale.
- Good morning, Tim.

45
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:51,981
Top floor?
Summoned by the gods?

46
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:52,940
Something like that.

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,759
Got up for your new
mistress this weekend?

48
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:58,993
I don't know what you're talking about,
I'm a married man.

49
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,908
What do you think,
am I presentable?

50
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,687
Not sure about the tie, darling.

51
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,610
What's this?
"Peace and Love"?

52
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,719
Too much of that nonsense
and we're both out of a job.

53
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:16,055
Michael Abdul Malik.
Calls himself Michael X,

54
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,932
in homage to Malcolm X,
his American counterpart.

55
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:22,252
The Pinko press would
have us believe this Michael X

56
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:24,912
is a crusading champion
of the poor and oppressed.

57
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:27,607
And the black Robin Hood
of Notting Hill.

58
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:31,062
The richer, whiter and more famous,
the more they fall over him

59
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:33,305
The truth is, he's a slum landlord,
a drug dealer

60
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:35,869
and a vicious pimp who should have
been in prison years ago.

61
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:42,379
Are you not charging outrageous rents
to my brothers and sisters, Mr. Brown?

62
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,588
I'm charging the same as your
slum-lord friend Lew Vogel.

63
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:48,562
Ten quids a week is too
much for these shitholes.

64
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:50,742
You know,

65
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,738
I always wanted to meet
a white man by the name of Brown.

66
00:04:55,823 --> 00:05:00,086
You know what this is?
It's a slave collar.

67
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:02,673
And a white man made my mothers
and fathers wear this

68
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,273
to bend them to his will.

69
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:10,283
Can I bend you to my will,
Mr. Brown?

70
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,563
You sure got a faithful
dog now, Michael.

71
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:17,720
Michael, I don't think we
should get our hopes up here.

72
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,284
Kidnappning, extortion,

73
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:21,548
assault on this man Brown here,

74
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,863
as well as your previous problems
with the law, I mean...

75
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:25,963
You could be looking
at 10 to 20 years.

76
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:30,858
I don't think so. I am smarter
and better protected than whitey thinks.

77
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,252
<i>All rise.</i>

78
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:38,539
<i>It seems Michael X has managed
to keep himself out of jail</i>

79
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,952
<i>by threatening to release</i>

80
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:44,063
damning photographs of a
certain... royal personage.

81
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:50,869
Until we get our hands on these snaps,
the police can't move.

82
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:52,506
The public prosecutor won't move...

83
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:54,305
and the home office
doesn't want to know.

84
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,893
Has anyone actually
seen these photographs?

85
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:59,983
Yes, but at the minute
I'm not at liberty...

86
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,829
to say who that person is.

87
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:04,339
We've had Michael X under surveillance
for quite a while.

88
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,091
He keeps a safe deposit
box at the Lloyd's Bank...

89
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:06,659
in Marylebone.

90
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,563
We believe that's where
the photos are located.

91
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,648
Seems straightforward enough.

92
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:14,890
I'll send a team into this bank

93
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,849
and take whatever he's got
in this safe deposit box.

94
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,426
That would have to be sanctioned
at the highest level,

95
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:21,410
and that's not going to happen.

96
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,498
Do you see our problem?

97
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,499
There can be no connection to 5 or 6.

98
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,066
So you want me to come up with something

99
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,519
to avoid getting accountability for anyone.

100
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,565
We'd welcome suggestions, Tim.

101
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:37,421
And if it all goes pear-shaped,
I assume it's my arse on the line?

102
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:41,775
You're young and ambitions, Tim.
A chance to make a name for yourself.

103
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,752
Thank you, Sir.

104
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:52,429
Excuse me there, miss.
Can I have a word?

105
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,326
Yes.

106
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:56,563
- Where have you been?
- Morocco.

107
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,718
- I'll have to check your underwear.
- Be my guest.

108
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,760
- We found what we're looking for.
- Found what?

109
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,128
What were you looking for?

110
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,601
Oh Tim, thank God!

111
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,892
I'm in a spot of bother.

112
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:18,268
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing much. You?

113
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:20,479
I was in Morocco recently.

114
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:23,730
- Business or pleasure?
- Bit of both.

115
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,095
Drinks are on me.

116
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:32,505
So, we're gonna sit here all night,
making small-talk?

117
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:36,622
I know you, Terry,
and I know your mates.

118
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:38,963
You've always been looking for
the big score,

119
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,063
the one that makes sense of everything.

120
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:45,847
- I have it for you.
- What?

121
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:50,984
- A bank.
- A bank... as in robber?

122
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:54,897
What would you know about a bank?

123
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:57,573
I've been seeing this guy
who runs his own business.

124
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:58,965
Security systems.

125
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:03,104
Next month, they're installing
new alarms in a bank at Marylebone.

126
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,423
Seems like the trains have been...

127
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:05,884
setting off the trembler
alarms in the vault

128
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,777
and they've had to turn them off.

129
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:10,425
So for a week or so,
they won't have any.

130
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:14,488
Now why would he tell you all this?

131
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:16,990
We were having a laugh about it.

132
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:20,585
Imagine if half the villains in
in London knew about this, he said.

133
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:23,122
And I thought, I know half
the villains in London.

134
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,959
I grew up with some of them.

135
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:28,457
Look, me and my mates might have 
been involved in the odd bit of

136
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:29,849
skullduggery.

137
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:30,797
Can you see us tooled up,

138
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,464
taking on a bank like
the James gang?

139
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:35,302
This isn't about waving a
waterpistol at a cashier's head.

140
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,149
This is about getting into the basement
where the deposit boxes are.

141
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:42,692
Hidden, secret wealth.
Money and jewels, they're safe to steal,

142
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:45,164
- 'cause people won't report it.
- Oh, no no no.

143
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,613
You can't talk about this here.

144
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,506
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Terry.

145
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:52,663
We can't pass it up.

146
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:57,563
I didn't expect this
from you tonight, Martine.

147
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,346
What did you expect?

148
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:08,363
I'll have to think about it.

149
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,054
You better get off to your stag party.

150
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:13,402
Thanks for the drink.

151
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,563
Eddie tells me his brother invited you
to the wedding.

152
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:23,934
- Are you going?
- I'll see you there.

153
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:35,128
Can I get a Campari and Soda, no ice?
- Yes, sir.

154
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:41,571
Thank you.

155
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,763
Well, Tim sweety,
what do you think?

156
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,148
- Is he offering?
- Maybe.

157
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:49,008
Cheers, gorgeous.

158
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:11,504
- So you coming in?
- I don't know, it's late.

159
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:14,284
Do you need to run home
like a good little boy?

160
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:16,421
I guess I've got time.

161
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:36,206
- What exactly do you do?
- Bit of this, bit of that.

162
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:37,883
How did you and Hakim meet?

163
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:40,655
I met Hakim in Los Angeles
last spring.

164
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,950
He was rasing money for a black
Montessori school

165
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:44,415
and writing his life's story.

166
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:46,529
And what an extraordinary
life it has been.

167
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:51,173
The book is called "From the Dead Level,
Malcolm X and Me."

168
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,800
I've read the manuscript.
Hakim is a poet.

169
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,925
The voice of the black soul.

170
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,449
A friend is throwing a thing next week

171
00:10:57,549 --> 00:10:59,451
to celebrate the launch of
Brother Hakim's book,

172
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,477
and you are all invited.

173
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,191
Hakim, tell us more about your book.

174
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:09,532
It's about being born black
in America.

175
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:13,253
Can any of you imagine what it is like
to be born a black man in this world?

176
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:17,945
Can any of you white women
imagine what it would be like

177
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,139
to bring a black baby into this world?

178
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,655
Good evening, sir.

179
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,464
What, you freakhead? Why are we
even having this conversation?

180
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:04,400
We're not-

181
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,708
Here's your beer.

182
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:11,507
<i>We are not bankrobbers.</i>

183
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,963
Maybe that's why we
could get away with it.

184
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:15,951
It's a bit daunting, isn't it?

185
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:17,479
You know what scares me more?

186
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,986
Living and dying with
nothing to show for it.

187
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:23,649
You know how old Mozart was
when he composed his first minuet?

188
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,635
- No.
- Five. Five! A fucking minuet!

189
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,648
And how would you know that fact, Terry?

190
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:31,807
Because it's tattooed on
that stripper's arse, Kevin.

191
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:34,117
What the fuck's it matter how I know?

192
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:36,095
It's a fact and you're
missing the point, Kev.

193
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:37,231
What I'm trying to say is,

194
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,707
we stop fucking about and stop...

195
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:40,430
picking the shit from
under our fingernails.

196
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:43,229
Shtum, lads.
Coppers at 12 o'clock.

197
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,129
Damn...

198
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,404
What are you two doing here,
personally?

199
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:02,624
I thought you were way past
being a bagman, Jerry.

200
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:06,671
Your associate Sonia Bern has raised
prices at that knocking shop of hers.

201
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:09,637
- £120 quid up from a £100.
- And your point?

202
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:12,419
A rising tide lifts all ships, mate.

203
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:14,845
I think we are owed some money.

204
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:17,617
- Cause even Sonia's can be raided.
- Yeah, you would do that, wouldn't you?

205
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:19,728
You'd kill the goose that
lays you golden eggs.

206
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:21,413
Wouldn't that be dumb, would it?

207
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:23,542
But then again,
everyone knows coppers are dumb.

208
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:27,054
Now you can do one thing for me.

209
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:33,305
You stop your collegues from
having their boys night out in my clubs.

210
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:41,337
They're loud, they're lewd
and they expect free oral sex.

211
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:46,988
You know what, that's disgusting.
Ya know, most of them have families.

212
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:48,778
We'll pass the word along.

213
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,211
Lew, you tell your
greedy little bobbies...

214
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,059
to find their
perks elsewhere.

215
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,686
No one is going to bother me.

216
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:10,982
My patrons could have a lot of these
old coppers put out to pasture.

217
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:13,156
Well, I'd say, spread the wealth around
and keep the peace.

218
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:15,377
Five quid a week extra.

219
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:18,333
- It's all it's worth.
- I'll pass it on.

220
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:32,858
- Drysdale.
- Urquhart.

221
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:39,163
Lord Drysdale, can I offer you a drink
before your session?

222
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:42,924
Very kind of you, Sonia.

223
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:48,006
- Good to see you.
- As well, Urquhart, as well.

224
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:54,906
Good girl.

225
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,748
Tighter!
Yes, that's a good girl.

226
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:05,794
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

227
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:21,594
Louder.

228
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:23,594
Louder!

229
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:25,294
Come on.

230
00:15:32,494 --> 00:15:34,494
<i>We want a kiss,
what's wrong with you?</i>

231
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:38,094
- I just can't.
- Come on...

232
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:40,594
<i>Give her a snogging, babe.</i>

233
00:15:58,343 --> 00:15:59,152
Hello.

234
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:00,839
Saw you in a magazine the other day.

235
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,646
The Campari ad on the beach.
Nice.

236
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,856
Must have been an old one,
I'm not modeling any more.

237
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:09,051
I don't know why.
You're still a knockout.

238
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,613
- What are you doing these days, Dave?
- Me?

239
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:14,786
A bit of film work.
Extra, you know.

240
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:16,820
And you, Kevin?
You're still snapping, I see.

241
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,606
The wedding photos?

242
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,244
No no, these are just
photos for the family.

243
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,530
Fashion is my game.
Fashion and passports.

244
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,512
- And the odd snap of a wayward husband.
- Thank you, Dave.

245
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,353
So, what's the verdict, boys?

246
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,163
We're interested.

247
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:31,027
First thing we should do
is take a look at the place,

248
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:32,127
suss it out.

249
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:34,450
- Maybe open a box of our own.
- I've already done that.

250
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,306
We can go and have a look tomorrow.

251
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:39,500
Tomorrow it is.

252
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:42,449
Heads up, lads.

253
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:45,369
- She's adorable, your little one.
- She is off.

254
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,484
And what a gorgeous flower girl
your eldest made.

255
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,006
Thanks. Catherine.

256
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:51,887
I do envy you.

257
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:53,359
- Kev, you want to dance?
- Yeah, come on.

258
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:54,730
It was lovely to see you all.

259
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,236
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

260
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,336
- All right, mate.
- All right.

261
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:03,579
She envies me...
She's being sarcastic?

262
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,702
I suppose what she meant was,
money can't by what we have.

263
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,088
Didn't you use to go out with her?

264
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:11,767
No love, that was Kevin.

265
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,173
He had this big thing for her.

266
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:16,938
- And you didn't?
- No.

267
00:17:17,743 --> 00:17:19,902
Not like me and you,
love at first sight.

268
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,002
Oh yeah...

269
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:25,339
I remember that night, you were
with your mate Audrey at that disco.

270
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,233
I saw this gorgeous little bum
in a pencil skirt

271
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:30,739
and I thought:
"Oh, I've gotta have that."

272
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,054
But that Audrey she already had a bloke,
so I pulled you.

273
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:34,405
Cheeky sod.

274
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:39,987
Daddy, daddy, come and dance with me.
Come on, dad.

275
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:58,687
Hands off me.

276
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,183
Good morning.

277
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:25,683
I'd like to access my
safe deposit box, please.

278
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:28,859
- Martine Love. L-O-V-E.
- Certainly, madam.

279
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:47,656
- You're an actor, right?
- That's right.

280
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:49,585
I did a couple of films
for you, Mr. Vogel.

281
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,606
Yeah, right.

282
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,632
So what are these films you're in?

283
00:18:58,732 --> 00:18:59,854
Forget about it.

284
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:01,100
Go on.

285
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:04,994
Technically, it's what you'd call...

286
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,524
pornography.

287
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:08,851
- You're joking?
- No.

288
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:10,615
So you've been going around town with a

289
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,690
12 inch mutton dagger
hanging down your pants?

290
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,628
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

291
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:49,328
Nice.

292
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,028
Fake.

293
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,643
For the posh party at the weekend.

294
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:10,319
This is the one.
The lease is available.

295
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,886
Finally.

296
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,396
- How do I look? Good?
- Not your best, Dave.

297
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,930
Here we go.

298
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:29,301
So how come you've got the inside
dope on this place, Martine?

299
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,738
She knows this bloke,
runs a security company.

300
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,227
Bloke? Is it serious?
Are you getting married?

301
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:37,439
He is married.
All the best ones are.

302
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,639
Here we go.

303
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:41,722
Marylebone Road and Baker Street,
on the corner here is the bank,

304
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:45,317
next door is the Chicken Inn,
and at 189, Le Sac.

305
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:47,143
In the back here is an underground
car park

306
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:49,748
with direct access to
the shops' basements.

307
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:51,792
We can pull in here from
Glentworth Street...

308
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:52,589
into the car park

309
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:55,336
for dropoffs and pickups
without being seen from the street.

310
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,374
We'll dig a tunnel from the basement
of the shop

311
00:20:57,474 --> 00:21:00,635
under the Chicken Inn and pop up
in the safe deposit vault.

312
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:02,490
I've got a question.

313
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,195
What do us lot know
about digging tunnels?

314
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:05,697
Nothing.

315
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,492
But I know a man who does.

316
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:11,155
- So what do you reckon, Bambas?
- What do I reckon?

317
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:15,212
I reckon I know you guys,
but I don't know her.

318
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:17,216
Don't worry about Martine,
she's solid.

319
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,162
We go way back.

320
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,814
Terry, you have been up to
some mischief in your time

321
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:23,809
but this, this is serious shit,
my friend.

322
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,686
Don't you think it's a little
out of your league?

323
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:29,004
Maybe it's time we stepped up
to the first division.

324
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:35,333
There's going to be reinforced concrete
under the vault.

325
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:38,739
We're going to need a thermic lance,
a jackhammer, a generator,

326
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,622
lights, ropes, cables, the works.

327
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:42,930
It's about 40 feet of digging
before we're under the bank.

328
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,216
We can hire some Micks from
Camden Town to do the digging

329
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,607
That's brilliant, Dave.

330
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:49,173
Why don't we just pay their
national ensurance contributions?

331
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,800
And then you have to get dirt on
your Tommy Nutter suit.

332
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:54,270
- This way, Michael. One more shot.
- This way.

333
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,770
Thank you, that was great.

334
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:02,010
- What are your plans?
- I am returning to Trinidad...

335
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,238
to liberate my brothers and sisters

336
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:07,335
from the enslavement of
the British colonialists.

337
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:10,489
What about the charges you are facing?
How can you leave England?

338
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,641
They are liars and cowards.

339
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:15,097
If they had anything against me
but their fear of me,

340
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:17,162
I'd be tried and jailed.

341
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:18,719
See you later, Bambas.

342
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:20,458
But we gonna need a front man
on this,

343
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,141
someone who can sign the lease on
the shop and looks the business.

344
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:26,004
I know someone, Guy Singer.
Calls himself "The Major".

345
00:22:26,104 --> 00:22:27,904
But that's a lot of bollocks,

346
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:31,571
He has got this white posh accent
if anyone comes nosing about.

347
00:22:34,543 --> 00:22:36,352
A bit tight under the
arms, dont you think?

348
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:38,614
Traditional fit, sir.

349
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:40,706
One can't raise ones
arms above one's head.

350
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:43,554
It tends to inhibit any
impulsive acts of surrender.

351
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:49,011
I'll be right back, sir.

352
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:51,417
What on earth are you doing here?

353
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,868
Got a bit of business for you, Guy.
You'll be tempted.

354
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:05,665
Sit down, luv.

355
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:07,968
What do you think you're doing?

356
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:09,712
Taking the E
for a test drive.

357
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,460
Tell your boss, he can
have his inventory back

358
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,995
when he settles Mr. Jessul's debt.

359
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:15,025
And it'd better be soon

360
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,298
or we'll be back to tap
through his kneecaps.

361
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:23,519
If I was you two,
I was looking for another job.

362
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:30,650
Lovely.

363
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,538
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

364
00:23:35,183 --> 00:23:39,144
So, come on then, what don't I know?
Romantic dinner on a Monday night?

365
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:47,178
Look honey,

366
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,499
I'm going to be working some strange
hours over the next week or two, so...

367
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,053
don't ask me what I'm doing,
because I don't want to lie to you.

368
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:57,209
What are you doing?

369
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:00,003
Look...

370
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:04,802
I know I've caused us a few problems
but those cars aren't selling

371
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:08,852
All I was trying to do
is get ahead of the game.

372
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:11,179
- This thing's gonna put us there.
- OK.

373
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:12,311
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

374
00:24:12,903 --> 00:24:15,093
And a better place.

375
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:17,332
It's for all of us.

376
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,058
For you and the kids.

377
00:24:21,158 --> 00:24:23,432
And how afraid do I have to be, Terry?

378
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:33,423
It'd be the best smart thing if you
wanted to stay with your aunt,

379
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:37,052
in case things to custard.

380
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:49,177
So, we are settled. 25% to run
my girls till I return from Trinidad.

381
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:52,167
It's all right,
you don't have to worry.

382
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:55,630
I'll look after your little flock
of birds like they were my own.

383
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:58,900
As long as you remember
they are not your own.

384
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,207
Lew, while I'm back in Trinidad,

385
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:02,219
I can arrange for shipment of some
high grade gunja.

386
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:03,849
Not interested.

387
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:05,609
You want my opinion?

388
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:07,361
I think drugs are responsible for...

389
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,247
the moral decay of
this countries' young.

390
00:25:09,347 --> 00:25:11,961
Smut, smut and more smut.

391
00:25:12,063 --> 00:25:13,783
That's my special area of interest.

392
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:14,844
You should think about it.

393
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:16,639
With these goodies you can make
a lot of dough,

394
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,233
especially the police in your pocket.

395
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:20,131
I am paying enough bung as it is,

396
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:21,991
but probably not as much
as you're donating

397
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:24,663
to be permitted to leave our
fair shores.

398
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:29,237
Not a shilling! I have something
so special, I don't need to pay anyone.

399
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:31,291
And what would that be, Michael?

400
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:33,182
Sorry, Lew.

401
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:34,690
Well.

402
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,819
Whatever it is, you crafty bugger,
I hope you're keeping it safe.

403
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,306
Yes, as safe as it can be.
In the place that you recommended.

404
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:45,839
- You're late.
- Sorry.

405
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:49,536
This is the Major.
Major Guy Singer.

406
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:51,326
Final member of our team.

407
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,568
I don't know this man.
Who are you?

408
00:25:53,668 --> 00:25:55,175
None of your business.

409
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:57,647
No secrets around here.
The Major is a con artist.

410
00:25:57,748 --> 00:25:59,517
Usually elderly widows.

411
00:25:59,623 --> 00:26:01,024
There's no need to bring that up.

412
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,402
Now he's the official
new owner of Le Sac.

413
00:26:03,552 --> 00:26:05,809
Handbags and leather accesories
for the discerning lady.

414
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:07,509
Nice.

415
00:26:07,723 --> 00:26:10,323
I told the district planner's
office about the remodelling.

416
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:14,330
They gave me the specs for the
sewage, drainage, gas and power lines.

417
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,206
We'll have to go deep
to miss that lot.

418
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:18,600
What's this for?

419
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:22,684
That is the thermic lance.
It cuts through concrete and metal.

420
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:26,823
We're doing this, right?
I mean, we're bloody going for it.

421
00:26:26,924 --> 00:26:28,268
Let's see what this thing can do.

422
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:30,821
Good idea, Kev.
Give us a demonstration, Bambas.

423
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,729
Ok, hold this.
Hold it. Here.

424
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,334
Kevin, go stand over there
by the oxygen.

425
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:36,934
Here we go.

426
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,259
Turn it off!

427
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,189
Off! Off! Off!

428
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:57,389
Not good.

429
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:59,232
They know what they're doing,
these people, do they?

430
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,935
Absolutely.
Professional criminals.

431
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:03,605
What's the worst case scenario?

432
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,285
They get caught and go to jail.

433
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:06,735
No possible connection to us.

434
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:08,814
What about this model you're screwing?

435
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:10,852
What promises have you made
to keep her in line?

436
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:12,769
None that can't be broken.

437
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,309
Look, she's our only tie
to the bank operation.

438
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:16,628
If things do go belly up

439
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:19,329
it'll only take one
cut to sever the knot.

440
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,536
What's Gale Benson up to?

441
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:24,406
I believe she's working her way
into Michael X's inner sanctum.

442
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:27,936
Could you sign that book, please?
I've got them finally together.

443
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:29,401
Daddy!

444
00:27:31,623 --> 00:27:33,899
I am so glad you decided to come.

445
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:37,661
This is my father, Sir Leonard Plugge.

446
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,127
Always happy to meet Gale's new friends.

447
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:41,208
Her new name is Hale Kimga.

448
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:44,177
It's an anagram
of the letters of our names:

449
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:45,901
Hakim and Gale.

450
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:49,402
- And your name is?
- Hakim. Hakim Jamal.

451
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,502
Right.

452
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:53,002
Excuse me...

453
00:27:58,383 --> 00:28:00,988
Hello, gorgeous.

454
00:28:01,103 --> 00:28:02,292
So, where's the author?

455
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:04,442
He's over there,
signing his masterpiece.

456
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,452
Why don't you both drop by
the house this weekend

457
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,402
and introduce Mr. Jamal to mother?

458
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:09,957
Sorry daddy, can't do that.

459
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:12,547
We're popping on
to the islands for a while.

460
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:17,060
- Let me get you a drink.
- Good luck with your book.

461
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:23,214
- So you've read this book of his?
- You must be joking.

462
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,804
Right.
You're probably undercover,

463
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:29,350
spying on Black Power's insidious
threat to the British way of life.

464
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,544
That's very funny.

465
00:28:30,894 --> 00:28:33,490
Tell me, is our little enterprise
still shipshape?

466
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,126
We're currently on schedule, Tim.

467
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:38,097
We're taking over the shop
on Friday afternoon.

468
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:40,586
I know if this stuffs up
I'm in poo poo land.

469
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:48,633
We have a blue Transit van
that's just pulled up.

470
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:50,655
"Clacy Builders" on the side.

471
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:53,291
And we have one man entering the shop.

472
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:07,182
Construction crew, for Le Sac.

473
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:20,051
I've got a question.

474
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,301
What do we do with all the dirt
we're gonna dig out of the hole?

475
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:23,753
That's all been worked out, Dave.

476
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:27,418
We'll dig another hole over there
and put in in that. Over.

477
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:31,371
If we're to get the job done
before the bank opens on Monday morning,

478
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:32,489
we better get a wriggle on.

479
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:33,847
Want to do the honours, Martine?

480
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:38,930
This is it,
here we go.

481
00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:40,703
Watch your nails, Martine.

482
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:41,803
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:44,703
Let's get this store to rock.

484
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:09,277
- Some racket there Alf?
- Bloody hell! What's going on?

485
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,460
Dave, come on, mate.

486
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:38,451
Dave, you need a break.
I'll take over.

487
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:40,217
Cheers, Major.

488
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:43,909
Heads up!

489
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:53,122
- Where's Dave?
- No idea.

490
00:31:57,463 --> 00:31:59,006
Where did you get to?

491
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:00,817
Just checking the door was locked.

492
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:03,751
Of course it's locked, Dave.
I locked it.

493
00:32:08,903 --> 00:32:11,345
Hang on.
What we got here?

494
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,061
A copper.

495
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:17,184
Christ, he's not going in there, is he?

496
00:32:19,263 --> 00:32:21,666
- I'll go.
- Shit! Dave, Dave, get back.

497
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:23,456
- I only wanted-
- Stop! Hold it down!

498
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:24,794
Someone is knocking.
Someone is at the door.

499
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:26,894
Stop, Stop! There's somebody
at the door of the shop.

500
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:29,101
Bambas!

501
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:31,201
Bambas!
Hold on!

502
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:34,141
There's somebody at the door.

503
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:40,697
- Look, I don't mind going.
- It's my job.

504
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:50,433
Coppers.

505
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,033
It's the Old Bill.

506
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:02,489
Good evening.
You're working late?

507
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,772
Around the clock, officer.
Expanding our storage.

508
00:33:05,872 --> 00:33:07,316
Trying to complete renovations
for the grand.....

509
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:08,777
If you don't mind, sir.

510
00:33:11,943 --> 00:33:13,424
Excuse me?

511
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:17,786
You using a jackhammer down there?

512
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:20,166
Yeah. You had some
complaints, officer?

513
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:22,063
Yeah, from some of your neighbours.

514
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:26,742
We'll try to keep it down, alright?

515
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:28,642
Right.

516
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:36,007
I wonder how they
talked their way out of that one.

517
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:38,016
Tim, Quinn here.

518
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,254
We just had a copper
going into the shop.

519
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,473
<i>Not sure why, but he's gone now.</i>

520
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:48,069
All clear.

521
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:50,981
We need a lookout,
someone on a roof somewhere.

522
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:53,846
- We've got the walkie-talkies.
- What about Eddie?

523
00:33:53,947 --> 00:33:55,289
He's a good lad,
we can trust him.

524
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,049
No. Look, we're not cutting
anyone else in.

525
00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:58,553
We won't cut him in on the loot.

526
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,141
We'll give him the car lot.

527
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:02,664
Hopefully I won't need
that headache anymore.

528
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:05,588
- My God, not again.
- Get up there, Major.

529
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:06,918
Cover that up!

530
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:15,217
It's not the coppers.

531
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,589
- Yes, can I help you?
- Delivery for Dave Shilling.

532
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:26,663
- And what is it?
- Chicken and chips.

533
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:28,826
I see...

534
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:37,229
- Takeaway for Mr. Shilling.
- Thanks.

535
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,458
- You can't be serious.
- I was starving.

536
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:57,530
Radio is in the bag,
binoculars as well.

537
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,448
There's a bedsit on the
top floor of this building,

538
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:01,172
paid for the week.

539
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:02,609
The  ladder will
get you to the roof.

540
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,614
You're in from Liverpool,
looking for work.

541
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:05,954
I don't have a Liverpool accent.

542
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,788
Then don't talk to anyone, Eddie.

543
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:50,725
I'm up on the roof, and...

544
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:52,335
I've got a good view

545
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:53,811
<i>of all directions, over.</i>

546
00:35:54,183 --> 00:35:58,040
Are you in position, Nightjar?
Command HQ here. Acknowledge.

547
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:01,300
Yeah, I'm in position.
I can see the front of the bank,

548
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,368
Marylebone Road,

549
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:05,890
Baker Street, I can see
everything really well.

550
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,686
<i>All clear on the Western front, Guy.
Over.</i>

551
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:11,928
<i>- No names, Eddie.
- Sorry, Dave.</i>

552
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:15,218
Hey you delinquent.
What have I told you?

553
00:36:15,368 --> 00:36:16,693
<i>No idle chitchat.</i>

554
00:36:17,193 --> 00:36:19,193
Sorry, T-
Over.

555
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:20,693
Fuckin' hell...

556
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,196
Wakey wakey, gentlemen.

557
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:29,251
I'll keep an eye on
the shop from here on.

558
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:31,134
You two go down to Glentworth Street.

559
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:32,659
Guard the parking garage exit.

560
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,010
Okay.

561
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,646
Nightjar here, there's some fellow
looking through the window.

562
00:36:57,903 --> 00:36:59,246
<i>Hang on.</i>

563
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,062
Wait, hang on. He's going.
He's going.

564
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:05,062
Yeah, he's gone.
Over.

565
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:10,282
Roger, Nightjar.
Over and out.

566
00:37:10,783 --> 00:37:13,218
I want to go to the pub,
grab some more smokes.

567
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:15,189
Do you want anything?

568
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:17,848
A pack of Seniors.

569
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:19,468
There you go, sir.

570
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,534
Two packets of Rothmans,

571
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:23,789
Two Senior Service and 8 bags of crisps.

572
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:24,597
Okay.

573
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:27,357
Hello, gorgeous.
Are we still on track?

574
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,341
We had a scare last night.
The cops came round.

575
00:37:30,441 --> 00:37:32,573
Can't you pull rank and make
sure it doesn't happen again?

576
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:35,888
No, we can't show our hand.
We're invisible, remember?

577
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:38,803
- I wish I was.
- How about your friend Terry?

578
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:41,124
Where is he planning to
carve up the proceeds?

579
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,754
Shit.

580
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:50,048
- A pint of ale, chief.
- What's wrong?

581
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:52,155
I needed to take a break.

582
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:54,289
Who's that you've been talking to?

583
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:57,150
I wasn't.
He was trying to chat me up.

584
00:37:57,823 --> 00:37:59,317
Does happen, you know.

585
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:02,050
<i>- Right.
- There you are.</i>

586
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,548
<i>- Cheers. Keep the change.
- Thank you.</i>

587
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:07,982
Now, what are you doing here?
Are you following me?

588
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:10,006
No.

589
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:14,552
- I just wanted a pint.
- Then enjoy it.

590
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:44,665
- Hello, Gale.
- Where have you been?

591
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:47,216
You're rather impressed with our
friend Hakim, aren't you?

592
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:50,614
I know rule #1:
"Don't get emotionally involved"

593
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:53,595
That doesn't mean I can't
enjoy my work.

594
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:55,390
You certainly do.

595
00:38:56,583 --> 00:39:00,035
What does your father think of your
consorting with these radicals anyway?

596
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:01,460
We are not amused.

597
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,190
Of course, if he knew
what I was really up to,

598
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,690
he would have a heart attack.

599
00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:09,370
Here you are.
Credit cards and cash.

600
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:12,319
If he does have copies of the
photos and negatives there,

601
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:13,211
they will be hidden.

602
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:14,895
Find them.
Destroy them.

603
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:16,808
And then get out.

604
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:18,811
Michael X thinks he's safe,
tucked away in Trinidad.

605
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:21,004
That will all change if
we're successful here.

606
00:39:21,823 --> 00:39:24,059
Just remember, Gale:
He's a nasty piece of work.

607
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:29,121
He's a crazy dope-smoking lunatic
pimp extortionist, that's what he is.

608
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:34,084
Everything okay, Nightjar?
Anything I need to know?

609
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,200
Yeah, everything's all right, mate.

610
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,699
Listen, what if I want to go
for a pee up here?

611
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:42,370
<i>I don't know.
Use your imagination.</i>

612
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,793
<i>Stay off the radio unless you
see any Old Bill, all right?</i>

613
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:49,334
<i>Yeah, all right. If I see any
Old Bill, I'll let you know.</i>

614
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,934
<i>I'll speak to you in a bit.
Over.</i>

615
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:00,334
Hey Bambas.

616
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,966
What's all this brickwork?

617
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:05,557
I don't know,
it wasn't on the plans.

618
00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:06,657
Fuck!

619
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:09,957
<i>Terry?
Fucking hell!</i>

620
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:13,157
<i>Terry!
Bambas!</i>

621
00:40:13,263 --> 00:40:14,735
Terry, talk to me!

622
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:18,085
Terry!

623
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:19,935
Oh fuck..

624
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,270
<i>Terry, talk to me!</i>

625
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:28,857
<i>- Are you all right?
- I think so, yeah.</i>

626
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,168
What happened?

627
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:32,879
<i>The floor just caved in.</i>

628
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:35,257
Bloody hell, Terry.
Don't do that to me.

629
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:36,563
- I thought you was a goner.
- Yeah.

630
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:38,806
Give us a light, Dave.

631
00:40:40,663 --> 00:40:42,350
What's down there?

632
00:40:43,543 --> 00:40:46,432
<i>- It's a pile of skeletons.
- You're joking.</i>

633
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:50,633
<i>Let's hope they're not the last gang
who tried to take this bank.</i>

634
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:57,411
Latin.
Roughly translated:

635
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:59,739
Lamb of God,
forgive us our sins.

636
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,781
- How do you know Latin?
- Catholic school.

637
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:05,207
The Bleeding Heart sisters
of eternal misery.

638
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:07,416
Interesting date.
1665.

639
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:09,039
You all know what year
that was, don't you?

640
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:10,900
The last time West Ham
won the cup?

641
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,256
It was the great plague of London.

642
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:15,457
This must be a
burial chamber.

643
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:17,387
A crypt where they dumped the bodies.

644
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:19,622
Well, if these poor
bastards had the plague,

645
00:41:19,722 --> 00:41:21,172
they could be infectious.

646
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:22,769
I don't think so, Dave.

647
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:25,174
This crypt goes all
the way under the bank.

648
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,806
It'll put us in the vault quicker.

649
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:30,543
And how we'll gonna do that?

650
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:47,726
Concrete.

651
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:49,944
Floor of the vault.

652
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:52,180
Time to get paid for all our work.

653
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,024
Right.

654
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,934
If we hit the restaurant by mistake,
we'll be knee-deep in fried chicken.

655
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:58,734
I'll be happy if we don't
hit the sewage.

656
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,403
When are you guys
going to hit the vault?

657
00:42:47,553 --> 00:42:49,272
<i>I'm freezing my tits off up here.
Over.</i>

658
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:52,119
<i>In the army, soldiers would pull on</i>

659
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,696
<i>their puds to keep their blood flowing.
Over</i>

660
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,572
What regiment were you in,
the Royal Corps of Wankers?

661
00:42:58,383 --> 00:42:59,160
Over.

662
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,324
<i>Yes, we welcome new members.
Roger, over and out.</i>

663
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:05,733
<i>Emergency operator.
Which service do you require?</i>

664
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,931
<i>- The police, please.
- Putting you through.</i>

665
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:10,318
<i>Police here.
Can I help you?</i>

666
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:11,892
Yes.
I'm a HAM radio operator

667
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:14,869
and I think I may be overhearing
a robbery in progress.

668
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:31,156
We're in!
Dave, get the ladder.

669
00:44:05,723 --> 00:44:08,686
We're gonna move into the vault
after we take a break.

670
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,114
We need to let the fumes clear out.

671
00:44:11,264 --> 00:44:13,146
You're having a laugh, ain't you?
Let's go in now.

672
00:44:13,246 --> 00:44:17,379
Dave. Nothing's going nowhere.
I can hardly breathe in there.

673
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:21,501
- Nightjar, are you there? Over.
- Nightjar here, over.

674
00:44:21,602 --> 00:44:23,232
<i>We're in.
Over.</i>

675
00:44:24,743 --> 00:44:26,051
What, in the actual vault?

676
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:27,692
Yes, in the actual vault. Over.

677
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:31,053
Great, great.
That's great news. Over.

678
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:33,561
We're taking a break.
We're knackered.

679
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,883
<i>I need to get some sleep.</i>

680
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:37,145
<i>Getting some shut-eye while
the fumes clear out. Over.</i>

681
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:41,523
<i>Lucky you. My eyes are like
organ stops. Over.</i>

682
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:44,119
<i>We can smell the money now.
Over.</i>

683
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:46,925
Look, money may be your god,
but it ain't mine, all right?

684
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:50,505
I want a warm bath and a cuppa tea.
Over.

685
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,347
You'll get your cup of tea.
Just your odd time.

686
00:44:53,463 --> 00:44:56,529
<i>Lucky you.
My eyes are like organ stops.</i>

687
00:44:56,629 --> 00:44:58,885
<i>We can smell the money now.</i>

688
00:44:58,985 --> 00:45:00,845
I rang 4 other police
stations before you,

689
00:45:00,995 --> 00:45:02,411
but nobody took me sriously.

690
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:04,616
....said it was probably a hoax.

691
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:06,603
How strong was the signal, Mr. Addey?

692
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,738
I'd say they were within
a 10 mile radius.

693
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:11,747
There must be a ton of
banks in that area.

694
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:13,743
And when was the last time
you picked them up?

695
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:16,164
They've been quiet for about an hour.

696
00:45:16,264 --> 00:45:18,566
What about releasing the tapes
to the radio and TV?

697
00:45:18,863 --> 00:45:20,360
Maybe somebody can recognize the voices?

698
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,077
No, no.

699
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:23,855
If they hear themselves,
they'll stop transmitting.

700
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:25,456
No, we should keep listening.

701
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,447
Maybe they'll reveal where they are.

702
00:45:27,743 --> 00:45:30,016
Alfie, you stay here with Mr. Addey.
I am going back to the station.

703
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:32,462
You call me if you hear anything.

704
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:32,452
<i>Hi.</i>

705
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,618
You scared the piss out of me.

706
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:44,157
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

707
00:46:45,943 --> 00:46:48,445
Yeah, I'm a bit jangly
myself..

708
00:46:48,545 --> 00:46:52,460
I just had to come and have a look.
Our future is in those boxes.

709
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:59,945
So, what are you going to do
with your share?

710
00:47:00,045 --> 00:47:03,495
Vanish.
Martine Love will cease to exist.

711
00:47:07,103 --> 00:47:09,786
Why, do you think if you
vanish you'll become someone else?

712
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:12,579
At least no one will know
who I was.

713
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:17,987
Why did you pick Kevin and me?
You could have found better thieves.

714
00:47:19,063 --> 00:47:20,999
For old times' sake.

715
00:47:23,103 --> 00:47:25,003
Must be old times
you spent with Kevin,

716
00:47:25,663 --> 00:47:26,948
not me.

717
00:47:27,063 --> 00:47:30,460
Kevin has it in his mind that
we had this passionate affair.

718
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:31,997
The truth is, it came down

719
00:47:32,147 --> 00:47:34,661
to 4 chinese meals and
a roll in the hay.

720
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:38,890
And that was a long time ago.

721
00:48:19,703 --> 00:48:20,621
All right,

722
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:22,221
let's make some money.

723
00:48:41,023 --> 00:48:42,406
Look at this!

724
00:48:44,183 --> 00:48:45,770
Look at all this cash.

725
00:48:47,063 --> 00:48:48,015
Fantastic!

726
00:48:48,115 --> 00:48:49,515
Guys? Gold bars.

727
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:51,315
Diamonds. Diamonds!

728
00:49:01,103 --> 00:49:02,695
Guys, what's going on?

729
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:05,875
How would your wife fancy a tiara?

730
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:09,219
Too bloody right.

731
00:49:10,723 --> 00:49:11,962
<i>Get the gas.
The gas.</i>

732
00:49:12,063 --> 00:49:13,669
<i>Look at it.
Hold it.</i>

733
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:15,769
- Emerald.
- It's like winning the Pools.

734
00:49:29,283 --> 00:49:31,650
Dave.
Give us a hand with this one.

735
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:35,991
- What's so special about this box?
- It's my lucky number.

736
00:49:42,663 --> 00:49:44,533
All yours, me lovely.

737
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,633
- There you are.
- Cheers.

738
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:11,024
Holy shit.
You know who that is?

739
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,966
It's Princess Margaret.

740
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:15,920
Terry, anything for the
widows and auctions funds?

741
00:50:17,023 --> 00:50:20,649
- Will that do?
- God bless you, you're very generous.

742
00:50:20,749 --> 00:50:22,615
Look, we have to have
some sort of system.

743
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:24,512
You don't know what you are throwing
or what you are keeping.

744
00:50:24,623 --> 00:50:25,907
Yeah, but we know what money looks like.

745
00:50:26,008 --> 00:50:28,138
We're not throwing that away, are we?

746
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:38,959
How long does it take
to rob a bank?

747
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:43,267
<i>We're just about to end
this job now, yeah?</i>

748
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:44,179
Not yet.

749
00:50:45,183 --> 00:50:46,748
Have a look at this.

750
00:51:02,263 --> 00:51:04,087
No, nothing.

751
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:05,235
Still nothing.

752
00:51:05,335 --> 00:51:06,614
Sergeant, what we need is something

753
00:51:06,714 --> 00:51:08,335
that will motivate the
robbers to go on air,

754
00:51:08,743 --> 00:51:11,359
<i>- give away their location.
- Right..</i>

755
00:51:11,823 --> 00:51:13,359
Bait to lure the fish.

756
00:51:17,023 --> 00:51:19,217
No, they are not there,
not transmitting.

757
00:51:19,317 --> 00:51:20,679
They are not there, sir.

758
00:51:20,783 --> 00:51:24,469
Move to the next bank,
 Sierra Lima 2.

759
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:33,791
We still get nothing, Sarge.

760
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:37,727
Ok, unit Sierra Lima 2, move to the
next location.

761
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,679
My God, the stuff that
some people collect...

762
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,243
What have you got there, Terry?

763
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:46,848
- '47.
- '47?

764
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,919
Sounds like a good year to me.

765
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:52,990
Will you pass it round?

766
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,948
Come on, Terry.
Give us some.

767
00:51:55,748 --> 00:51:56,748
Got it.

768
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:07,452
Catch!

769
00:52:07,552 --> 00:52:08,914
Oi! Yeah...

770
00:52:09,465 --> 00:52:10,553
Here, Major.

771
00:52:10,662 --> 00:52:11,317
Get it down.

772
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:12,611
<i>Listen fellows, they are onto you.</i>

773
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:15,590
<i>Listen, they're onto you.
- Fuck.</i>

774
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,338
Coppers are on your doorstep.

775
00:52:23,003 --> 00:52:24,387
Speak to me, Nightjar.

776
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:25,990
<i>Coppers right on your doorstep.</i>

777
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,106
Listen. Hang on, hang on...
they're not going in,

778
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:30,343
<i>but they are not going away.
Wait, wait.</i>

779
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:32,845
Sergeant, we just heard
the thieves' lookout

780
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,272
say that there are police
outside the bank right now.

781
00:52:35,372 --> 00:52:37,457
- Which bank?
- I haven't got a clue.

782
00:52:37,564 --> 00:52:39,678
We've got patrols outside half
the banks in the West End.

783
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:42,564
Keep listening, we need to
pinpoint exactly where they are.

784
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:45,615
<i>Wait. Hang on.</i>

785
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:53,754
Guys, a black car just pulled up
with some bloke.

786
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,481
He's going up to the front door
with the cops.

787
00:52:59,525 --> 00:53:01,744
Guys, he is unlocking the front door.

788
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:05,726
They are going in.
Shit! Over.

789
00:53:06,806 --> 00:53:09,743
Oh no.
Shit.

790
00:53:11,086 --> 00:53:13,398
- Where is the vault?
- Downstairs.

791
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:19,926
Follow me.

792
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:41,798
Looks fine.

793
00:53:42,298 --> 00:53:44,299
<i>Are you sure everything is all right?
Yes, yes, it is.</i>

794
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:47,554
- I want to look inside.
- Tell the timelock.

795
00:53:47,654 --> 00:53:49,961
Can't be opened until
tomorrow morning.

796
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,971
Well, it isn't my bank
that's being robbed.

797
00:53:59,272 --> 00:54:01,273
Sorry for calling you
on a Sunday morning, sir.

798
00:54:01,873 --> 00:54:03,874
- Not a problem...
- Thank you.

799
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:08,926
Fellows, I think they are going away.

800
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:17,094
They are gone.

801
00:54:25,572 --> 00:54:28,079
We should get out of here.
They could be coming back.

802
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:30,132
Yeah, right.
We need to let Eddie know.

803
00:54:30,953 --> 00:54:32,032
Nightjar?

804
00:54:34,493 --> 00:54:36,295
<i>Nightjar?</i>

805
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:37,735
No!

806
00:54:37,853 --> 00:54:39,759
Fuck!

807
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,004
Shit.
Fuck.

808
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:43,856
Shit. Shit.

809
00:54:45,013 --> 00:54:46,433
Are you there, Nightjar?

810
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:51,660
The ambulance reports it's outside
the Lloyd's bank on Baker Street.

811
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,415
Nightjar, can you hear me?

812
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:57,392
<i>You gone to sleep, Nightjar?</i>

813
00:54:59,592 --> 00:55:01,593
Fucking hell...

814
00:55:06,815 --> 00:55:08,189
Nightjar, are you there?

815
00:55:08,295 --> 00:55:10,642
Look, if he's not picking up,
something is wrong.

816
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:11,929
You're right.

817
00:55:12,029 --> 00:55:13,305
So, grab all the cash and the jewels

818
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:14,413
and get the fuck out of here.

819
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:15,486
What about our gear?

820
00:55:15,636 --> 00:55:16,964
We cant leave anything
that might incriminate us.

821
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:17,973
We come back for it if we can.

822
00:55:18,073 --> 00:55:19,010
What about all the other boxes?

823
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:21,465
Doesn't matter, Dave.
Put everything in a bag and lets go!

824
00:55:21,577 --> 00:55:23,436
All right, let's move it.
Come on!

825
00:55:27,176 --> 00:55:29,792
- There's nothing here, Sarge.
- Are you sure?

826
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:32,054
There's no mention of the ambulance.

827
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:34,493
Nothing.
Move on, Sierra Lima 2.

828
00:55:47,538 --> 00:55:48,647
- Let's go!
- Finally.

829
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:49,856
Come on, let's go.

830
00:55:51,819 --> 00:55:54,202
The van is leaving.
We will follow them. Over.

831
00:55:54,302 --> 00:55:56,335
Stop them as soon as possible.

832
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,828
Open the door!

833
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,340
- What have I done, guv'nor?
- Open the back door, come on.

834
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,245
Some fella paid me 50 quid
to pick up his van

835
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:17,130
and drop it at Heathrow airport.

836
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,374
Jesus Christ...

837
00:56:22,581 --> 00:56:24,412
- Wher's the van?
- Change of plan.

838
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:25,997
Precautionary measure.

839
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:28,471
I've organised alternative transport.

840
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:30,985
- Why?
- None of us have met your boyfriend.

841
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:33,430
He's all go to include
you on the back of the job.

842
00:56:34,022 --> 00:56:36,041
Could've set us up.

843
00:56:40,702 --> 00:56:42,087
We bloody well pulled it off.

844
00:56:42,187 --> 00:56:44,209
Done with military
precision, hey, major?

845
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:45,541
Now that I am fiscally secure,

846
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:47,342
I think I'll promote
myself to "Colonel".

847
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:50,410
<i>You know what I am going to do?</i>

848
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,930
I'm going to buy my mom a new house.
Something with a garden.

849
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,832
I thought you would be off
to Copenhagen, Dave?

850
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:58,716
- Why would I go to Copenhagen?
- Heavy cock, sure hunt.

851
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:00,466
You know what I'll do?
I'll chop off one more

852
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,941
and then I got one like
your little pinkey.

853
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:30,699
How did you find this place
then, Terry?

854
00:57:31,786 --> 00:57:32,733
A bloke and I used to run a...

855
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,213
chop shop here.

856
00:57:34,313 --> 00:57:35,716
He's in the nick now.

857
00:57:35,826 --> 00:57:38,175
How could you lose control
of the operation?

858
00:57:38,946 --> 00:57:40,467
I thought you were
on top of this thing.

859
00:57:40,617 --> 00:57:41,676
Sir, it worked.

860
00:57:41,786 --> 00:57:43,262
They did the job.
They robbed the vault.

861
00:57:43,362 --> 00:57:45,937
And we have no idea
where the fuck they are.

862
00:57:46,827 --> 00:57:48,892
You know, an ugly thought
has just occured.

863
00:57:48,992 --> 00:57:51,445
Lots of money in that vault,
juwelry, bonds.

864
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:54,331
You and your sweetie haven't
cooked up something between you, I hope.

865
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,296
- You think I'd betray you?
- There are precedents.

866
00:57:56,396 --> 00:57:58,986
Two of our former colleagues
now live in bloody Moscow.

867
00:57:59,086 --> 00:58:00,717
Let's hope they don't have
another bidder.

868
00:58:00,828 --> 00:58:02,984
She won't cross us.
She knows what we're capable of.

869
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:05,586
How does she even know
who the hell we are?

870
00:58:05,688 --> 00:58:08,476
I'm sure she will contact me
when she comes to her senses.

871
00:58:08,748 --> 00:58:11,133
Going anywhere else would be
a death sentence.

872
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:13,166
You better hope she does, Everett.

873
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:15,649
Or it may be yours.

874
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,601
Here you go, Bambas.
That's your lot.

875
00:58:30,471 --> 00:58:34,067
"Never washed after our
magic moment. Snookie."

876
00:58:40,071 --> 00:58:43,030
Hey, Dave.
Look at this.

877
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:48,856
I've seen this bloke on the TV.
The old perv.

878
00:58:48,956 --> 00:58:52,177
I have seen this face before.
He's an M.P..

879
00:58:52,277 --> 00:58:55,317
Lord... whatshisname, you know.
Always wears those poncey bow ties.

880
00:58:55,417 --> 00:58:57,279
Well, on that picture he's not.

881
00:58:58,072 --> 00:58:59,806
I believe this is one
of your old movies, Dave.

882
00:59:00,312 --> 00:59:01,809
Piss off, Kev.

883
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:03,539
Timely suggestion.

884
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:06,681
I believe I'll take my share
and be on my way,

885
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:09,225
before the bank opens in the morning

886
00:59:09,376 --> 00:59:10,601
and the shit hits the
proverbial fan.

887
00:59:10,773 --> 00:59:11,547
I'm with you, Guy.

888
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:12,928
I don't have to remind you:

889
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:15,983
Keep a low profile.
No buying Aston Martins, Bambas.

890
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:19,293
The only thing I'm buying is a
one-way ticket back to Cyprus.

891
00:59:19,394 --> 00:59:21,758
- I'm never coming back.
- We should have a reunion.

892
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:26,010
- 20 years, the Savoy Grill.
- Yeah, right, maybe for you, Guy.

893
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:28,996
I still wouldn't let us lot in.

894
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,587
- Bambas.
- Goodbye my friend.

895
00:59:31,837 --> 00:59:33,404
Take care of yourself, mate.

896
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,104
Major.

897
00:59:39,996 --> 00:59:41,580
Be lucky.

898
00:59:41,775 --> 00:59:42,995
Bambas.

899
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:45,396
Goodbye, old chap.

900
00:59:51,777 --> 00:59:53,552
Okay, what's going on?
You two have been staring

901
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,353
daggers at each other
since we left the bank

902
00:59:56,117 --> 00:59:58,575
What is it?
Lover's tiff?

903
01:00:04,957 --> 01:00:07,110
I think Martine has got
something to tell us.

904
01:00:11,718 --> 01:00:13,977
Hang about.
That's Princess Margaret.

905
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,478
Fuck me...

906
01:00:19,518 --> 01:00:20,748
Where do these come from?

907
01:00:20,848 --> 01:00:23,475
You knew the exact
box this stuff was in, Martine.

908
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,917
You'd better come clean and tell us
what this is really about.

909
01:00:29,479 --> 01:00:33,424
About a month ago I got busted at
Heathrow on a drug charge.

910
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:36,330
This guy I know said he would fix it
to keep me out of jail,

911
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,602
if I do him a favour.

912
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:40,149
He knew I knew some villains.

913
01:00:40,249 --> 01:00:42,957
He wanted to set up a robbery
to get these.

914
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,809
Fucking hell!

915
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,910
That would be the bloke
you met in the Player's Club.

916
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,377
Same guy you said was trying
to pick you up in The Globe, right?

917
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,079
- Yeah.
- Well, so who is he?

918
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:54,348
He's a guy I met at the Sombrero Club.

919
01:00:54,448 --> 01:00:56,748
He works for some shady outfit
in Whitehall.

920
01:00:56,848 --> 01:00:59,638
- Oh no, no. You mean MI fucking 5?
- Or 6?

921
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:02,279
We could get seriously
nicked here, Martine!

922
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:03,480
No, we couldn't.

923
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,822
All Tim wants is the contents
of box 118.

924
01:01:05,922 --> 01:01:08,994
The deal with him is,
we get to keep everything else.

925
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:11,532
And you believe that?

926
01:01:11,642 --> 01:01:14,188
You put your trust in some prick
we've never even met.

927
01:01:14,288 --> 01:01:15,489
You lied to us, Martine!

928
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,252
We were sitting ducks
right from ther start.

929
01:01:17,522 --> 01:01:18,556
Thank you very much.

930
01:01:18,656 --> 01:01:21,083
You think it's a coincidence
that you get busted for drugs

931
01:01:21,364 --> 01:01:23,491
and your Tim just happens to have
a plan to rob a bank?

932
01:01:24,103 --> 01:01:25,265
This can work out.

933
01:01:25,365 --> 01:01:27,520
We give him the photos and
everything else in that box

934
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,471
and we get to keep the rest
and we're free and clear.

935
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:31,327
These people are regular cozzers
, Martine.

936
01:01:31,427 --> 01:01:32,510
They are above that.

937
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:33,800
They do things coppers can't.

938
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:37,622
They think we've seen these photos,
we're expendable as dog shit.

939
01:01:37,804 --> 01:01:39,162
You know what?

940
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,713
I've seen our shots
and I  know...

941
01:01:40,813 --> 01:01:43,414
we're either dog shit
or about to be dog shit.

942
01:01:43,685 --> 01:01:44,878
I'm out of here.

943
01:01:45,004 --> 01:01:48,561
I'm not waiting for a load of spooks
and coppers to come cracking my head.

944
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:49,789
I'm splitting like Guy and Bambas.

945
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:51,429
It would be better if we
stuck together, Dave.

946
01:01:51,529 --> 01:01:55,078
And why, Tel?, 'cause we've been so
truthful with each other so far?

947
01:01:56,086 --> 01:01:59,214
- Dave, come on...
- No, I'm going home, Kev. See me mom.

948
01:01:59,326 --> 01:02:02,408
And then I'm going far away, as far
as I can get away from you.

949
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:11,191
We'd better get out of here, too.
In case Guy and Bambas get picked up.

950
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:12,947
Let's split the lot of this.

951
01:02:13,047 --> 01:02:15,839
There may be someone else in this shit
to cause us some more grief.

952
01:02:20,607 --> 01:02:23,383
- One of those, mate.
- Here you go.

953
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:25,916
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

954
01:02:33,248 --> 01:02:36,268
- They overheard our radio chat.
- Fuckin' hell...

955
01:02:40,209 --> 01:02:43,463
"Police last night were trying to home in
on a £300.000 bank raid."

956
01:02:43,569 --> 01:02:45,192
They still don't know
what bank it was.

957
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:47,685
- 300 grand?
- It's a bit more than that...

958
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:49,035
More like 3 million.

959
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:22,947
- Hello?
- Martine Love.

960
01:03:23,052 --> 01:03:26,198
Thank God.
Put her through and then run a trace.

961
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:27,614
<i>It's me.</i>

962
01:03:27,793 --> 01:03:29,518
What happened?
Where the hell are you?

963
01:03:29,618 --> 01:03:30,193
London.

964
01:03:30,293 --> 01:03:31,794
I know, of course.
I mean, where?

965
01:03:31,894 --> 01:03:32,718
I know what you mean.

966
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:33,884
Martine, we have to meet.

967
01:03:33,984 --> 01:03:36,248
I agree.
Why don't you come over to my place?

968
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:37,849
I'll make you a cocktail,

969
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:40,198
and we'll have a roll in the hay
for old times' sake.

970
01:03:40,298 --> 01:03:43,593
Oh, right. You would have
been there, haven't you?

971
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,973
Probably have your men
keeping lookout for me now.

972
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,161
You're not in a position
to play games, Martine.

973
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:50,399
No threats please, Tim.

974
01:03:50,499 --> 01:03:53,306
Why didn't you tell me what
it was I was set up to get you?

975
01:03:53,494 --> 01:03:54,859
For your own good.

976
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:56,501
I care about your safety, Martine.

977
01:03:56,694 --> 01:03:58,150
Right.

978
01:03:59,575 --> 01:04:02,401
I suppose I give you what you
want and we go our separate ways.

979
01:04:02,501 --> 01:04:03,901
That's what I promised.

980
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:06,469
Ok, today. Tottenham Court Road Tube.

981
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:09,640
Northern isle, northbound platform.
10:30 sharp.

982
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,802
Tottenham Court Road, 10:30.
Good.

983
01:04:12,902 --> 01:04:17,288
"London vaults checked after radio HAM
tunes in to a crime."

984
01:04:17,536 --> 01:04:20,448
Christ, what a fiasco!

985
01:04:20,736 --> 01:04:22,541
And now the particular
bank has been identified,

986
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:24,304
the story will be all over the news.

987
01:04:24,405 --> 01:04:26,150
We've heard it already is.

988
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,962
If we don't get onto the case quickly

989
01:04:30,062 --> 01:04:31,484
the police will have nabbed
these robbers,

990
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:33,585
and God knows what will happen to
our photographs.

991
01:04:34,285 --> 01:04:36,322
Philip, get over to the bank.

992
01:04:36,423 --> 01:04:38,511
Take control of the situation.

993
01:04:39,097 --> 01:04:43,512
Gentlemen. I've just had
a conversation with one Martine Love.

994
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:45,013
Where is she?

995
01:04:45,113 --> 01:04:47,562
Call was traced to a public phone box
in Earl's Court.

996
01:04:47,662 --> 01:04:49,484
Good news is,
she's arranged a meet.

997
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:50,622
That is good news.

998
01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:52,232
- I'll be better off going alone.
- Yeah.

999
01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:55,645
Tim has agreed to meet.

1000
01:04:55,745 --> 01:04:58,959
It's all over the news.
They found the location of the bank.

1001
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:01,397
So what?

1002
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,794
Keep the change.

1003
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,179
I'm sorry, ma'am,
you can't go in.

1004
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:12,185
There's been a robbery.

1005
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:14,452
We know there's been a robbery,
that's why we're all here.

1006
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:29,957
<i>Everybody that works here.
I need everybody. Speak to him.</i>

1007
01:05:30,782 --> 01:05:32,329
Gerald?

1008
01:05:32,822 --> 01:05:35,009
You work in robbery now then?

1009
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:36,750
You're a long way off your patch.

1010
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,345
Regional crime squad now.

1011
01:05:38,445 --> 01:05:40,570
Just went by to see
what all the fuss is about.

1012
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,619
Pretty cheeky, that radio bit.

1013
01:05:43,103 --> 01:05:46,100
These walkie-talkie robbers
certainly caught your lot on the hop.

1014
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,768
Makes us all look stupid.

1015
01:05:47,868 --> 01:05:48,662
Yeah, well...

1016
01:05:48,912 --> 01:05:51,111
You're pretty chummy with all
the villains around town.

1017
01:05:51,504 --> 01:05:53,690
You got any idea who
could have done this?

1018
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,555
None of my informants.

1019
01:05:57,103 --> 01:05:58,893
We have been waiting here
quite some time,

1020
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:01,169
and so far you people have
told us absolutely nothing.

1021
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:03,167
If you would like to give us an
itemized list

1022
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:05,487
of the content of your boxes,
we may be able to ascertain...

1023
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:06,911
- Are you mad?
- ...what's missing.

1024
01:06:07,011 --> 01:06:08,471
The whole point in having
a safe deposit box

1025
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:11,612
is so that people like you
don't know what's in it!

1026
01:06:13,065 --> 01:06:15,332
I want to speak to a Roy Given.

1027
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:16,471
Yeah, that's me.

1028
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:18,603
This robbery is now a matter of
national security.

1029
01:06:18,753 --> 01:06:20,033
I want everybody out.

1030
01:06:20,133 --> 01:06:21,592
This is a police investigation.

1031
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:24,547
Not anymore.
Call your superiors.

1032
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:27,896
Who the bloody hell does he think he is?

1033
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:32,095
Spooks. MI-5 or 6,
I can never tell the difference.

1034
01:06:32,386 --> 01:06:33,581
They all got the same tailor

1035
01:06:33,681 --> 01:06:35,777
and they all went to
the same bloody school.

1036
01:06:36,266 --> 01:06:37,642
Let's get some copies of the...

1037
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:39,577
walkie-talkie tapes
out to the news boys.

1038
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:42,877
Maybe the public can help
identify the villains.

1039
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:47,057
So tell me... Which of the boxes
were ransacked?

1040
01:06:47,347 --> 01:06:50,747
The lot.
100s through to 400s.

1041
01:06:53,068 --> 01:06:55,815
Oh, well we're in a crapper, Jerry.
Both of us.

1042
01:06:55,915 --> 01:06:57,873
Both?
Now, why is it my problem?

1043
01:06:57,973 --> 01:07:00,563
Accounts have to be balanced
records kept.

1044
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:03,575
And I wouldn't likely keep the books
around here, now would I?

1045
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:06,124
Spell it out, Lew.
Be more specific.

1046
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:08,622
I have a ledger,

1047
01:07:09,509 --> 01:07:10,898
a record of every payment

1048
01:07:11,148 --> 01:07:12,899
I've ever made to you
and your colleagues.

1049
01:07:12,999 --> 01:07:15,264
It was in my safety deposit box,

1050
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:17,054
and I think we can safely assume...

1051
01:07:17,154 --> 01:07:19,017
it's now in the possession
of the robbers.

1052
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:20,838
Jesus wept.

1053
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:22,006
And I think you'll agree

1054
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:24,741
we have to find those villains
before your honest colleagues do.

1055
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,185
For fuck's sake.

1056
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:34,657
Who is this?

1057
01:07:34,757 --> 01:07:36,213
<i>Lew Vogel.</i>

1058
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:38,020
Hold on.
Get up.

1059
01:07:38,311 --> 01:07:39,950
Come on, wake up.

1060
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,125
What do you want, Lew?

1061
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:48,139
<i>I'm afraid I've got some
potentially bad news for you, Michael.</i>

1062
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:51,501
Your safety deposit box at
the Baker Street bank...

1063
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,136
what's its number?

1064
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,417
Why do you ask?

1065
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:56,662
<i>Well, because some thieves broke into
the bank vault and robbed it.</i>

1066
01:07:58,153 --> 01:08:00,008
So if your box is in the
100 to 400 numbers,

1067
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:01,901
I'm afraid all your stuff
will be gone.

1068
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:03,456
<i>Mine too, unhappily.</i>

1069
01:08:03,556 --> 01:08:05,176
What? How can this happen in London?

1070
01:08:05,276 --> 01:08:06,879
<i>Well, I promise you it has happened.</i>

1071
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:09,408
I promise you these thieves will be
found and dealt with.

1072
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,398
<i>You can rely on it.
I'll keep you informed.</i>

1073
01:08:12,498 --> 01:08:13,793
Thank you.

1074
01:09:17,798 --> 01:09:20,103
No-one touches me, follows me
or Martine takes your stuff...

1075
01:09:20,204 --> 01:09:23,077
right to Fleet Street, understood?

1076
01:09:28,639 --> 01:09:30,865
You want box 118, Tim.

1077
01:09:30,965 --> 01:09:33,547
You have no idea of the danger
you and your chums are in, do you?

1078
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:35,605
Is that right?
And what would that be?

1079
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:38,095
You've opened Pandora's box,
you dumb prick, that's why.

1080
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,858
I know what's at stake.

1081
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,643
And I know how expendable we are.

1082
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:42,896
Some change in the deal.

1083
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:44,518
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah...

1084
01:09:44,618 --> 01:09:48,385
You'll get all your nasty pictures,
but here's the twist:

1085
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:51,988
We'll get indemnity, fresh passports,
safe passage out of the country.

1086
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:53,378
For the whole team.

1087
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,887
And an officially signed document

1088
01:09:55,037 --> 01:09:57,478
guaranteeing we won't be prosecuted
and we won't be pursued.

1089
01:09:57,642 --> 01:09:59,429
You can't be serious?

1090
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,296
You can bet your bollocks I'm serious.

1091
01:10:01,402 --> 01:10:03,724
I want it signed and delivered
by a public figure

1092
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,542
of substantial authority.

1093
01:10:05,642 --> 01:10:06,908
How about the Prime Minister?

1094
01:10:07,008 --> 01:10:09,277
Yeah, he'll do, if you
can drag him off his yacht.

1095
01:10:09,763 --> 01:10:11,434
You mess with us, Tim...

1096
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:15,718
We can drip-feed pictures like this
to the press.

1097
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:22,421
We've got a stack of 'em.

1098
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:24,957
Oh, do you?

1099
01:10:27,203 --> 01:10:29,871
You've got until 4pm to confirm
that we have a deal.

1100
01:10:30,164 --> 01:10:31,662
We'll be in touch.

1101
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:37,920
Some photographs.

1102
01:10:38,404 --> 01:10:39,958
Well done, Tim!

1103
01:10:52,806 --> 01:10:54,153
Do you have any more?

1104
01:10:54,253 --> 01:10:57,886
Apparently there is a whole rogues gallery
stored in one of those boxes.

1105
01:11:05,046 --> 01:11:07,214
If Lord Drysdale is up to his usual
hanky-panky,

1106
01:11:07,314 --> 01:11:08,714
that's his problem.

1107
01:11:09,415 --> 01:11:12,473
This operation is about recovering
the photos from Michael X.

1108
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:14,676
Might it not be prudent
to get the committee

1109
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:15,954
to consider issuing a "D notice"?

1110
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:19,120
To protect everyone potentially

1111
01:11:19,228 --> 01:11:21,209
embarrassed by this
criminal activity.

1112
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:23,759
...Which we instigated.

1113
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,061
<i>Very nice.
Very nice indeed.</i>

1114
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:35,236
When I came out there were a
couple of lads taking some photos.

1115
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:36,740
Buddies of him.

1116
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:40,604
He was standing right outside the bank
just a few days before it was robbed.

1117
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:43,679
I thought at the time
he looked a bit shifty.

1118
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:49,202
Christ, is that thing real?

1119
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:51,277
I've got it.

1120
01:11:51,428 --> 01:11:53,900
Dave Shilling.
That's his name.

1121
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:56,993
Tata, mom.

1122
01:11:57,094 --> 01:11:59,046
Look after yourself, son.

1123
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:02,489
Go, get yourself inside.
You'll catch your death.

1124
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:10,476
- Dave Shilling?
- Yeah?

1125
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,406
I wonder if we could have a word.

1126
01:12:13,392 --> 01:12:16,108
- About what?
- About a bank.

1127
01:12:22,652 --> 01:12:24,185
I want to tell you something,
Mr. Shilling,

1128
01:12:24,285 --> 01:12:25,686
because it will save time.

1129
01:12:26,686 --> 01:12:27,687
You see,

1130
01:12:28,613 --> 01:12:30,650
I have a very jaundiced
view of life.

1131
01:12:31,733 --> 01:12:34,840
From what I see, most of it
is corrupt, venal and vile.

1132
01:12:35,933 --> 01:12:37,537
And I am just saying this
so that you know

1133
01:12:37,638 --> 01:12:39,579
that I don't have a
better nature to appeal to,

1134
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,719
or a compassionate streak.
I mean, you do understand, don't you?

1135
01:12:42,819 --> 01:12:44,400
I think so, Mr. Vogel.

1136
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,769
Good.

1137
01:12:49,135 --> 01:12:50,921
I have a kidney stone,

1138
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:54,324
I dont  seem to be able
to pass. I'm on painkillers.

1139
01:12:54,975 --> 01:12:57,171
I could use a couple of those myself.

1140
01:13:03,496 --> 01:13:05,251
You stole from me

1141
01:13:06,602 --> 01:13:08,495
and from friends of mine.

1142
01:13:10,696 --> 01:13:13,411
- Where is my stuff?
- I don't know.

1143
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:16,476
Look, I don't know anything about
any bank robbery. Honest.

1144
01:13:16,576 --> 01:13:19,174
You're still an unconvincing actor,
Mr. Shilling.

1145
01:13:27,938 --> 01:13:30,618
I would love to say
this is not going to hurt,

1146
01:13:30,918 --> 01:13:32,213
but it is.

1147
01:13:42,138 --> 01:13:43,920
What are you going to do?

1148
01:13:44,038 --> 01:13:46,028
Please, no!
No.

1149
01:13:47,058 --> 01:13:49,385
Stop. Please.

1150
01:13:49,485 --> 01:13:50,283
No.

1151
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:00,370
- Well, they were here.
- What are you gonna do?

1152
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:04,799
Why is the door open?

1153
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:11,886
Who are you?

1154
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:13,799
I could ask the same thing.

1155
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:16,006
You better run along, eh?

1156
01:14:17,131 --> 01:14:18,316
Get yourselves a
cup of tea or something.

1157
01:14:28,742 --> 01:14:30,482
We are looking for Terry Leather.

1158
01:14:30,582 --> 01:14:32,014
Terry said he would not
be coming in this week.

1159
01:14:32,114 --> 01:14:33,741
He is supposed to call in.

1160
01:14:34,902 --> 01:14:37,973
- So you would be Eddie, right?
- Uh, yeah?

1161
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:39,323
Well, you're coming with me!

1162
01:14:39,424 --> 01:14:40,400
What are you doing?
Leave him alone!

1163
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:42,292
What are you going
to do with my Eddie?

1164
01:14:42,393 --> 01:14:43,759
- Just relax.
- Leave her alone!

1165
01:14:43,863 --> 01:14:45,650
We want to talk to him
about a bank robbery.

1166
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:46,380
<i>Don't you touch her!</i>

1167
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:48,131
If you want to see your Eddie
or his mate Dave again,

1168
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:50,162
make sure Terry Leather
calls that number.

1169
01:14:51,323 --> 01:14:53,293
Walkie-talkie gang
takes it all.

1170
01:14:53,393 --> 01:14:54,794
Read all about it.

1171
01:14:55,694 --> 01:14:57,795
Walkie-talkie gang
takes it all...

1172
01:14:58,264 --> 01:15:01,292
<i>- That's great news. Over.
- We're taking a break.</i>

1173
01:15:01,392 --> 01:15:02,678
<i>We need to get some sleep.</i>

1174
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:05,223
<i>Getting a shut-eye. I want
the fumes cleared out. Over.</i>

1175
01:15:05,923 --> 01:15:07,924
<i>Lucky you.
My eyes are like...</i>

1176
01:15:08,065 --> 01:15:10,455
Mommy? Daddy is on the radio.

1177
01:15:10,555 --> 01:15:11,903
Don't be so silly, darling.

1178
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:13,441
He is!

1179
01:15:14,025 --> 01:15:15,334
Is he?

1180
01:15:15,435 --> 01:15:17,757
<i>I want a warm bath and a cup of tea.
Over.</i>

1181
01:15:17,865 --> 01:15:21,330
<i>You'll get your cup of tea.
Just your odd time. Over.</i>

1182
01:15:21,431 --> 01:15:22,862
See?
It is daddy.

1183
01:15:22,962 --> 01:15:25,229
<i>Authorities have released this
recording of the walkie-talkie</i>

1184
01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:28,030
<i>communications between the robbers
of Lloyd´s Bank in Marylebone</i>

1185
01:15:28,186 --> 01:15:29,758
<i>in the hopes that their voices</i>

1186
01:15:29,908 --> 01:15:31,681
<i>may be identified by members
of the public...</i>

1187
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:33,371
Hello?

1188
01:15:34,021 --> 01:15:35,325
Wendy?

1189
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:37,839
We heard you on the radio, Terry.
You are famous, you know?

1190
01:15:37,947 --> 01:15:40,981
You robbed that bank, didn't you?
The one on the news.

1191
01:15:41,082 --> 01:15:44,470
Oh God, you could go to jail for years
for something like that, Terry.

1192
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:45,550
I couldn't stand it.

1193
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:46,934
No one is going to jail.

1194
01:15:47,035 --> 01:15:48,460
I've got everyone under control.

1195
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,178
Just stay put.
Keep the kids inside.

1196
01:15:52,768 --> 01:15:54,603
I love you, Wendy.

1197
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:57,002
I gotta go.

1198
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,226
You be careful, Terry.

1199
01:15:59,327 --> 01:16:00,611
<i>What's the matter, mom?</i>

1200
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:02,738
Nothing, darling.

1201
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:10,373
- Terry, they took Eddie.
- Oh God. Who?

1202
01:16:10,473 --> 01:16:14,020
They didn't have fleece on.
I don't know, they could have been cops.

1203
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,873
They left a phone number for you.

1204
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,072
They said, if I want to see
Dave or Eddie again,

1205
01:16:18,222 --> 01:16:19,378
then you'll have to call.

1206
01:16:19,478 --> 01:16:21,144
Listen to me, I swear to you
we'll get them back.

1207
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,732
Don't you worry, darling.

1208
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,756
Have you got a pen?

1209
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:26,131
Yeah.

1210
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,215
<i>- 0-1-9-4-6.
- Hold on, say it again.</i>

1211
01:16:29,391 --> 01:16:33,066
<i>0-1-9-4-6.
- Yeah.</i>

1212
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:38,811
Michael?
It's Lew Vogel. Yes.

1213
01:16:38,911 --> 01:16:40,792
Well, we've identified the villains.

1214
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:43,288
<i>Believe it or not, they're
amateurs. Part-timers.</i>

1215
01:16:43,412 --> 01:16:46,673
They were put up to the job by
a woman named Martine Love.

1216
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,310
- Ring a bell?
- Never heard of her.

1217
01:16:48,411 --> 01:16:49,978
Well, we paid a visit to her flat,

1218
01:16:50,078 --> 01:16:52,209
and some chaps from MI-5
were already there.

1219
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:55,049
Pulled rank on my
tame copper.

1220
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:58,220
Why do you suppose these
people would be interested

1221
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:00,174
in the robbery of a minor
neighbourhood bank, Michael?

1222
01:17:00,274 --> 01:17:02,934
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

1223
01:17:03,034 --> 01:17:06,287
And I'm guessing that
your box is number 118?

1224
01:17:06,874 --> 01:17:09,938
<i>I think what these robbers were
really after were photographs.</i>

1225
01:17:10,614 --> 01:17:12,501
Photographs of a certain Royal Princess.

1226
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:13,975
How do you know that?

1227
01:17:14,474 --> 01:17:16,725
Because on this point,
I believe my captive.

1228
01:17:16,994 --> 01:17:19,730
No man could withstand the pain
we inflicted on him.

1229
01:17:20,295 --> 01:17:22,211
So don't take me for a fool, Michael!

1230
01:17:22,335 --> 01:17:23,627
You've instigated this calamity

1231
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:25,755
by storing your blackmail
materials in this bank.

1232
01:17:26,135 --> 01:17:27,049
Which you recommended.

1233
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,109
I will not be lectured by the
porn king of Soho.

1234
01:17:29,475 --> 01:17:30,662
Get my pictures back,

1235
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,190
or you will never see a black man
on the streets of London

1236
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:35,615
without wondering if he's been sent
to kill you!

1237
01:17:56,657 --> 01:17:58,004
What are you doing?

1238
01:17:58,104 --> 01:18:01,294
Oh, hello Michael. Hakim was
looking for a copy of his book.

1239
01:18:03,117 --> 01:18:04,870
I know what you've been looking for.

1240
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,465
You won't find it.

1241
01:18:06,565 --> 01:18:08,604
What are you talking about?

1242
01:18:10,139 --> 01:18:12,141
<i>Hakim, I found your book.</i>

1243
01:18:13,099 --> 01:18:14,518
You don't understand.

1244
01:18:14,968 --> 01:18:17,285
My box and those of my friends

1245
01:18:17,386 --> 01:18:19,274
may have been rifled.

1246
01:18:19,659 --> 01:18:21,045
Surely you can pull some strings.

1247
01:18:21,195 --> 01:18:22,886
You're a minister in the
government, for God's sake!

1248
01:18:23,059 --> 01:18:25,672
Sonia, I really don't think
I am able to help here.

1249
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,761
Perhaps you don't fully comprehend.

1250
01:18:27,862 --> 01:18:31,970
I have photographs,
compromising photographs,

1251
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,994
live films of you,

1252
01:18:34,094 --> 01:18:36,544
Miles Urquhart, all my regulars,

1253
01:18:36,644 --> 01:18:39,428
in this safe deposit box.

1254
01:18:39,921 --> 01:18:42,410
You all know each other if
that's any consolation.

1255
01:18:42,881 --> 01:18:45,232
You've got photographs of me?

1256
01:18:45,332 --> 01:18:47,827
You conniving cunt!

1257
01:18:51,402 --> 01:18:52,764
You be a big boy.

1258
01:18:53,314 --> 01:18:55,163
Now is the time to talk
to your White Hall chums,

1259
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:56,228
don't you think?

1260
01:18:58,622 --> 01:19:00,941
That's him.
Sure that's him.

1261
01:19:02,482 --> 01:19:05,243
Guy Arthur Singer,
con man and petty criminal.

1262
01:19:05,722 --> 01:19:07,789
Did a stretch in the "Scrubs"
a few years back.

1263
01:19:07,889 --> 01:19:10,641
I thought he was a wanker.
Spoke with some poncey accent.

1264
01:19:11,843 --> 01:19:13,866
Thank you, sir, very much.

1265
01:19:20,303 --> 01:19:22,431
- Hello?
- Who am I talking to?

1266
01:19:22,531 --> 01:19:26,627
Terry Leather, Kevin Swain,
Martine Love, Eddie Burton.

1267
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:29,136
Yeah, Mr. Shilling was kind
enough to speak with me about this.

1268
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:30,955
You put Dave on the phone.

1269
01:19:31,084 --> 01:19:32,498
Now, I would, but...

1270
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:35,196
he seems a bit indisposed
at the moment.

1271
01:19:35,744 --> 01:19:37,042
<i>What do you want?</i>

1272
01:19:37,145 --> 01:19:39,062
Just a couple of things
from what you've stolen.

1273
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:41,601
A ledger with a dark red cover.

1274
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:42,831
And some photos

1275
01:19:43,026 --> 01:19:45,476
that I'm sure the MI-5
is interested in.

1276
01:19:45,946 --> 01:19:47,591
The "Royal portfolio".

1277
01:19:48,726 --> 01:19:50,764
All we got is money and jewels.

1278
01:19:50,865 --> 01:19:52,571
Then I suggest you look again.

1279
01:19:53,366 --> 01:19:54,510
Speak to your friends.

1280
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:57,229
- Hello, who is this?
- Eddie, it's Terry.

1281
01:19:57,329 --> 01:19:58,116
Terry...

1282
01:19:58,666 --> 01:19:59,985
Terry, fucking hell.

1283
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:02,405
Dave's all messed up,

1284
01:20:02,527 --> 01:20:04,494
and they're going to do the same
to me, you got to help.

1285
01:20:05,007 --> 01:20:06,150
Listen to me, Eddie.

1286
01:20:07,301 --> 01:20:08,728
I don't have what he wants.

1287
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:12,188
No? No, you've got to have what
they want, you've got to.

1288
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:14,489
You've got to help.

1289
01:20:14,589 --> 01:20:17,268
Eddie, what am I supposed to do?
You tell him, we don't have it!

1290
01:20:17,668 --> 01:20:19,541
- No, Terry. Terry, you gotta-
- Eddie,

1291
01:20:19,691 --> 01:20:22,078
Tell him I don't have
his fucking ledger!

1292
01:20:22,368 --> 01:20:24,274
<i>You tell that cunt now!</i>

1293
01:20:25,648 --> 01:20:27,478
He doesn't have it...

1294
01:20:28,328 --> 01:20:29,347
Right.

1295
01:20:31,448 --> 01:20:32,231
Wait...

1296
01:20:32,331 --> 01:20:33,449
No! No!

1297
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,625
No! They shot Dave!

1298
01:20:36,909 --> 01:20:38,514
- Eddie?
- Dave is dead.

1299
01:20:38,614 --> 01:20:40,615
- Eddie!
- They shot him, Terry...

1300
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:46,123
I'll give you one hour
to find what I want,

1301
01:20:46,223 --> 01:20:48,013
<i>or I'll kill this man.</i>

1302
01:21:05,931 --> 01:21:07,525
This is it.

1303
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:10,084
Lew Vogel.

1304
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:12,595
That's what this bastard is.

1305
01:21:14,952 --> 01:21:18,437
"Payments made to Soho and
West End division officers"

1306
01:21:20,612 --> 01:21:25,216
There are weekly payouts.
50 quid here, 20 there.

1307
01:21:26,613 --> 01:21:28,989
Probably every bad copper in London.

1308
01:21:30,373 --> 01:21:31,996
Nothing like this was
supposed to happen.

1309
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:33,356
No one was supposed to get hurt.

1310
01:21:33,507 --> 01:21:34,809
It's not your fault,
right?

1311
01:21:34,909 --> 01:21:36,879
We still got our own exit to think about,
and Eddie.

1312
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:40,148
If we give the photos to Vogel,
all bets are off with Tim.

1313
01:21:40,254 --> 01:21:42,859
If we deliver it to Tim,
it's Eddie's neck

1314
01:21:42,959 --> 01:21:44,656
and Vogel is still after us.

1315
01:21:44,757 --> 01:21:46,467
Either way we are fucked.

1316
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:52,647
Miles, we've got a problem,

1317
01:21:52,748 --> 01:21:54,088
a serious problem.

1318
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:55,924
Something Sonia Bern
kept in the bank

1319
01:21:56,074 --> 01:21:57,771
that was robbed
over the weekend.

1320
01:21:58,056 --> 01:22:00,169
She is concerned that her
safe deposit box

1321
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:01,689
may have been plundered.

1322
01:22:01,796 --> 01:22:04,607
I'm afraid her fears
are well justified.

1323
01:22:05,816 --> 01:22:07,204
Oh my God.

1324
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:11,077
I really thought Sonia was a
woman of more discreet character.

1325
01:22:12,236 --> 01:22:15,485
So...
The genie is out of the bottle then.

1326
01:22:15,777 --> 01:22:18,062
- For both of us, ey?
- Not quite yet.

1327
01:22:18,276 --> 01:22:20,697
My operatives tell me
that the thieves

1328
01:22:20,847 --> 01:22:24,011
are using the photographs
as a bargaining chip.

1329
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:26,676
- Then give them what they want.
- Already in motion.

1330
01:22:26,877 --> 01:22:28,291
And the committee having
done the works

1331
01:22:28,441 --> 01:22:30,794
to issue a "D-notice"
on the whole business.

1332
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:34,781
To muffle the press.
Put a lid on it.

1333
01:23:12,861 --> 01:23:15,079
Big pity, wouldn't it?

1334
01:23:15,181 --> 01:23:18,652
Well, if your mates abandoned you
over a few photographs.

1335
01:23:25,154 --> 01:23:26,154
Hello.

1336
01:23:26,342 --> 01:23:30,403
You listen to me, Mr."Vogel" or
whatever your fucking name is.

1337
01:23:30,503 --> 01:23:32,663
You go ahead and kill him,
see if we give a shit.

1338
01:23:32,942 --> 01:23:34,372
We got our loot.

1339
01:23:34,472 --> 01:23:36,077
Your ledgers and your photos,

1340
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,612
you can pick 'em up
from Scotland Yard.

1341
01:23:37,713 --> 01:23:38,676
We're sending them over.

1342
01:23:39,126 --> 01:23:40,143
Don't do that.

1343
01:23:40,743 --> 01:23:42,889
Well, if you want your book
of payoffs back,

1344
01:23:43,183 --> 01:23:46,631
be at Paddington Station in
person tomorrow 11 am, platform 1.

1345
01:23:46,924 --> 01:23:50,180
There's a newsstand near
the statue of the soldier.

1346
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,498
Have Eddie with you,
hale and hearty.

1347
01:23:52,884 --> 01:23:54,949
This is your one and
only chance, Vogel.

1348
01:23:55,049 --> 01:23:56,847
Don't blow it.

1349
01:24:13,866 --> 01:24:16,355
Don't answer it!
Catherine!

1350
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:18,296
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1351
01:24:18,546 --> 01:24:20,006
Come here.

1352
01:24:22,146 --> 01:24:23,992
Here.
Look, I got you a present.

1353
01:24:24,567 --> 01:24:27,543
- You been good for mommy?
- Yeah.

1354
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:33,422
I need to talk to mommy about something,

1355
01:24:33,572 --> 01:24:34,976
so give us a minute, okay?

1356
01:24:35,076 --> 01:24:37,077
- Go on.
- Good girls.

1357
01:24:47,628 --> 01:24:50,324
So.. you want to tell me
what's been going on?

1358
01:24:51,188 --> 01:24:54,602
- Some blokes worked over Dave.
- How bad?

1359
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:57,243
He's dead.

1360
01:24:58,029 --> 01:25:00,056
Oh my God Almighty, Terry.

1361
01:25:00,156 --> 01:25:01,912
What have you done to us?

1362
01:25:02,029 --> 01:25:05,750
Wendy, I promise,
I'm gonna work this out.

1363
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,520
And when I do,
we're going to leave England.

1364
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,395
and it's all going
to change for us.

1365
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,869
But if anything goes wrong, use this.

1366
01:25:13,219 --> 01:25:15,973
There is plenty of cash.
Pounds, francs, dollars.

1367
01:25:16,371 --> 01:25:17,619
You're going to leave the country,

1368
01:25:17,769 --> 01:25:19,275
start a new life for you and the girls.

1369
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:22,576
You can do this if you have to,
Wendy. Promise me.

1370
01:25:22,676 --> 01:25:24,306
Is that from the robbery, is it?

1371
01:25:26,357 --> 01:25:27,661
My share, yeah.

1372
01:25:27,811 --> 01:25:30,241
The papers said there was a woman
in the vault.

1373
01:25:30,652 --> 01:25:32,740
Martine, so was she involved?

1374
01:25:32,931 --> 01:25:34,778
Yeah. She brought us the job
in the first place.

1375
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:36,711
Oh, and did you sleep
with her, Terry?

1376
01:25:45,032 --> 01:25:48,605
I did know that from day one.
It was the way she looked.

1377
01:25:48,713 --> 01:25:50,777
The first day we met
I said to my friend Audrey, I said:

1378
01:25:50,877 --> 01:25:54,889
"I am gonna marry him.
And I am gonna have his kids."

1379
01:25:55,053 --> 01:25:59,956
And I have stuck by you.... I 
stuck by you no matter what!

1380
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:01,757
You bastard!!

1381
01:26:05,558 --> 01:26:06,559
Fuck...

1382
01:26:14,354 --> 01:26:15,651
You can throw me over.

1383
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:18,995
I deserve it.

1384
01:26:20,515 --> 01:26:22,222
I brought you more
grief than happiness,

1385
01:26:23,315 --> 01:26:26,263
but I love you.
And the kids.

1386
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:31,511
So the reason I did this was to get
us out of this life once and for all.

1387
01:26:32,036 --> 01:26:33,619
<i>Mommy, open the door.</i>

1388
01:26:37,496 --> 01:26:38,303
<i>Mommy, mommy!</i>

1389
01:26:38,453 --> 01:26:40,625
- We have the rest of our lives,
- Go play in your room!

1390
01:26:43,637 --> 01:26:45,992
...if you'll still have me.

1391
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:11,470
She takes a good picture, eh, Tim?

1392
01:27:11,678 --> 01:27:13,358
Lord Mountbatten has graciously
agreed to represent

1393
01:27:13,508 --> 01:27:15,186
the interest of the crown
in this matter.

1394
01:27:15,287 --> 01:27:17,982
- Is he high enough up the tree?
- Lord Mountbatten.

1395
01:27:18,082 --> 01:27:19,996
I always wanted to meet that bugger.

1396
01:27:20,096 --> 01:27:21,924
Yes. I am not sure he will be
very pleased to meet you, too.

1397
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:25,146
He has to be under the main clock
Paddington Station, 11 am, or no deal.

1398
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,355
11 am, on the knock,

1399
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:28,156
and with your new
passports and documents.

1400
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,372
He's gonna hand them over
as soon as he sees the photos.

1401
01:27:30,881 --> 01:27:32,115
There's another problem.

1402
01:27:32,215 --> 01:27:34,005
This robbery's pissed off
some local villains.

1403
01:27:34,301 --> 01:27:36,130
The guts come with the glory, eh?

1404
01:27:36,521 --> 01:27:38,101
One of our mates has been killed.

1405
01:27:38,201 --> 01:27:40,502
That's hardly surprising considering
the roster of reprobates

1406
01:27:40,652 --> 01:27:42,597
that are the banks'
deposit box customers.

1407
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:44,330
Listen, Terry.
Our committment is for...

1408
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,429
the recovery of the
royal...portraits only.

1409
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:50,048
The proceeds and the piss-offs
are both yours to deal with.

1410
01:27:54,142 --> 01:27:56,139
11 am, Paddington Station.

1411
01:28:08,443 --> 01:28:09,369
Gale.

1412
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,504
Michael wants to see you
in the garden.

1413
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:14,279
- What for?
- I don't know.

1414
01:28:19,784 --> 01:28:22,142
Gale, come.
Come and look at this.

1415
01:28:22,742 --> 01:28:23,742
Come.

1416
01:28:25,724 --> 01:28:28,721
- I want to show you something.
- What's this for?

1417
01:28:31,165 --> 01:28:32,550
It's for you.

1418
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,702
What have I done to deserve this?
What have I done?

1419
01:28:34,802 --> 01:28:36,874
You're a spy, sent to steal
from me.

1420
01:28:37,365 --> 01:28:40,785
And nobody steals from Michael X.
No-one!

1421
01:28:44,705 --> 01:28:46,889
See if it mentions the copper in charge.

1422
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:50,548
Here it is.

1423
01:28:50,698 --> 01:28:52,459
"Heading the case is
Detective Sergeant

1424
01:28:52,559 --> 01:28:54,598
"Roy Given of Marylebone Lane
police station."

1425
01:28:56,126 --> 01:28:58,155
Roy Given?

1426
01:28:58,255 --> 01:29:00,151
No Roy Given menioned.

1427
01:29:00,927 --> 01:29:02,508
Let's hope that means
he's straight.

1428
01:29:02,608 --> 01:29:05,218
And that he'd be interested in the
names of some bent coppers.

1429
01:29:05,318 --> 01:29:07,163
Yeah, a bit of a long shot.

1430
01:29:09,868 --> 01:29:10,943
Fuck it...

1431
01:29:11,093 --> 01:29:12,778
- Nothing in that one?
- No.

1432
01:29:15,128 --> 01:29:18,487
What, we don't rate a mention.
Strike you as strange?

1433
01:29:18,609 --> 01:29:19,987
It's kind of scary actually.

1434
01:29:20,168 --> 01:29:22,452
If that news could disappear,
so could we.

1435
01:29:23,552 --> 01:29:25,353
<i>Next stop: Edgware Road.</i>

1436
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:26,795
Well...

1437
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:28,214
Here's to us.

1438
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,472
See you, mate.

1439
01:29:33,149 --> 01:29:35,357
Look after yourself.
Take care.

1440
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,092
Good luck, Kev.

1441
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:50,458
So where are you headed?
If everything goes to plan?

1442
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:54,913
I'll tell you,
if you're coming with me.

1443
01:30:12,012 --> 01:30:14,404
Good morning.
I'm looking for a Mr. Roy Given.

1444
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:15,995
It's very important.

1445
01:30:16,145 --> 01:30:17,778
- Roy Given?
- Yeah.

1446
01:30:19,353 --> 01:30:21,270
Can I ask
what it's concerning?

1447
01:30:21,372 --> 01:30:23,409
No, I prefer to tell him myself.

1448
01:30:23,593 --> 01:30:25,104
Look, all I'm saying is,
if you're interested

1449
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:26,745
in the rest of
this book of payoffs,

1450
01:30:26,845 --> 01:30:28,500
the author's gonna be
at Paddington Station

1451
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,190
11 am, platform one.

1452
01:30:30,293 --> 01:30:32,988
And how exactly did this come
into your possession?

1453
01:30:33,388 --> 01:30:36,490
<i>Next stop: Paddington Station.
Change here for the Bakerloo line.</i>

1454
01:30:36,874 --> 01:30:39,323
Let's hope now he turns up
fashionably late.

1455
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:56,637
- There's your friend, Tim.
- Good luck.

1456
01:31:09,236 --> 01:31:10,830
It's good to see you in one piece.

1457
01:31:11,237 --> 01:31:14,009
You were worried for your own arse,
Tim, not for mine.

1458
01:31:22,798 --> 01:31:24,058
You're a prick, Tim.

1459
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:26,128
You set this whole thing up
from the start, didn't you?

1460
01:31:26,228 --> 01:31:28,215
Come on, you get to be
rich, free and clear.

1461
01:31:28,315 --> 01:31:29,815
Isn't that what you wanted?

1462
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:54,972
- You stay here with the car.
- Right.

1463
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,355
Bloody kidney stone.
It's gotta go out soon.

1464
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:46,824
I haven't had this much excitement
since the war.

1465
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:48,538
We're a little late, My Lord.

1466
01:32:59,025 --> 01:33:00,356
So where is your mate?

1467
01:33:00,457 --> 01:33:02,791
There, sir, that one at the newsstand.

1468
01:33:08,385 --> 01:33:11,655
Wait. I've seen those two cowboys
before at the girl's flat.

1469
01:33:11,755 --> 01:33:13,522
- It's a trap, they're MI-5.
- Terry.

1470
01:33:13,822 --> 01:33:14,822
<i>Terry.</i>

1471
01:33:24,326 --> 01:33:25,822
- Lord Mountbatten?
- Yes?

1472
01:33:25,922 --> 01:33:28,515
You know the arrangements
and you agree to our new identities

1473
01:33:28,615 --> 01:33:30,060
and immunity from
prosecution?

1474
01:33:30,247 --> 01:33:32,623
You have my word that the crown
will honour this committment.

1475
01:33:33,027 --> 01:33:35,537
Your documentation and
guarantees

1476
01:33:38,168 --> 01:33:40,462
If I were you, I'd keep
them in a very safe place.

1477
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:42,997
Yeah, well, you bet it won't
be a safe deposit box.

1478
01:33:51,549 --> 01:33:55,235
She is a scallywag.
Thank you.

1479
01:34:00,036 --> 01:34:01,037
Martine.

1480
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:03,607
It wasn't all business for me.

1481
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:10,404
- What happened, where's the book?
- Just open the door.

1482
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:12,083
- No!
Get in there.

1483
01:34:12,183 --> 01:34:13,684
Stay there,
or you're dead meat!

1484
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:19,805
Where are you going, old man, eh?

1485
01:34:19,905 --> 01:34:20,905
No!

1486
01:34:22,951 --> 01:34:24,861
- This one's for Dave.
- No...

1487
01:34:25,471 --> 01:34:26,722
You fucker!

1488
01:34:29,051 --> 01:34:31,464
Not so fucking smug now, are ya?

1489
01:34:37,366 --> 01:34:38,866
Oi, you punk!

1490
01:35:15,154 --> 01:35:17,347
- Eddie, get out.
- That's the one that killed Dave.

1491
01:35:17,447 --> 01:35:18,648
Get your hands off me!

1492
01:35:19,555 --> 01:35:21,386
Arrest them,
they are bank robbers.

1493
01:35:22,076 --> 01:35:23,840
- Fuck!
- This bloke killed our friend!

1494
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,341
- Shit.
- No, no, listen...

1495
01:35:35,636 --> 01:35:37,868
So, are we seriously
arseholed now, Terry?

1496
01:35:37,968 --> 01:35:40,551
Well, at least we're not dead
like poor old Dave.

1497
01:35:43,157 --> 01:35:46,036
Get up, you filthy bastard.

1498
01:35:46,136 --> 01:35:48,265
You're under arrest.
Take him away.

1499
01:35:48,365 --> 01:35:49,766
<i>All right. Come on, you.</i>

1500
01:35:50,577 --> 01:35:51,760
<i>Get in the car.</i>

1501
01:35:57,862 --> 01:35:59,262
It's all right, mate.

1502
01:36:07,159 --> 01:36:08,708
I wonder if that's Roy Given?

1503
01:36:12,219 --> 01:36:13,368
Who's he?

1504
01:36:14,139 --> 01:36:16,245
I was hoping he was a straight copper.

1505
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:19,209
We've got a nice
collar here, Roy.

1506
01:36:19,309 --> 01:36:21,678
You know, these two are part of
the Baker Street bank robbery gang.

1507
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,996
- Place this man under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

1508
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,410
What are you talking about?
They're part of the Baker Street Firm.

1509
01:36:26,511 --> 01:36:27,442
I don't know about that.

1510
01:36:27,542 --> 01:36:29,722
But I know all about you,
you corrupt bastard.

1511
01:36:29,822 --> 01:36:31,823
Cuff him.
The one over by the wall as well.

1512
01:36:32,223 --> 01:36:33,537
But they're the robbers!

1513
01:36:35,521 --> 01:36:36,755
No robbers in here.

1514
01:36:36,855 --> 01:36:37,855
<i>Watch your head.</i>

1515
01:36:38,981 --> 01:36:39,532
Now...

1516
01:36:40,082 --> 01:36:43,016
I believe you've a certain
Mr. Vogel's book of shame.

1517
01:36:43,702 --> 01:36:46,115
Well, if you let me out,
I'll go get it for you.

1518
01:36:49,402 --> 01:36:50,961
That belongs to me.

1519
01:36:57,443 --> 01:36:58,738
Here's your book.

1520
01:36:58,838 --> 01:37:00,839
Terry. We were thinking,
a smart fella like you

1521
01:37:00,939 --> 01:37:03,671
might have kept mementos
of the event, just in case.

1522
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:06,254
Case what?
Things didn't turn out so nicely?

1523
01:37:06,363 --> 01:37:08,170
If they should ever see the light of day

1524
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,119
don't think we can't find you.

1525
01:37:16,644 --> 01:37:19,136
Out.
Go on, piss off.

1526
01:37:20,064 --> 01:37:21,460
Aren't you gone?

1527
01:37:21,965 --> 01:37:24,617
- How did that happen?
- Fucked if I know, just keep walking.

1528
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:35,920
Michael, Michael!

1529
01:37:40,526 --> 01:37:43,347
What's going on?
What do you want in my place?

1530
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:44,555
What do you want?

1531
01:37:44,655 --> 01:37:46,637
- We are placing you under arrest.
- What am I charged with?

1532
01:37:46,737 --> 01:37:50,105
Conspiracy to import drugs into
the United Kingdom, will that do?

1533
01:37:50,206 --> 01:37:51,807
But you could still help yourself.

1534
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:55,643
There's a British national staying
with you, a certain Gale Benson.

1535
01:37:55,767 --> 01:37:57,403
She was here, but she's gone on.

1536
01:38:01,805 --> 01:38:03,806
<i>- All right.
- Get in the back!</i>

1537
01:38:13,568 --> 01:38:14,992
Over here, sir.

1538
01:38:33,169 --> 01:38:34,337
Burn the house down.

1539
01:38:34,437 --> 01:38:36,375
I want nothing of this place
left standing.

1540
01:38:55,052 --> 01:38:56,626
- Were you friends of Dave?
- Oh yeah.

1541
01:38:56,776 --> 01:38:57,236
- Really?

1542
01:38:57,336 --> 01:38:59,497
We knew him in a professional capacity.

1543
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:02,469
He was one of our favourites.

1544
01:39:03,069 --> 01:39:04,070
See you later.

1545
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:07,371
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1546
01:39:08,072 --> 01:39:09,817
So where are you off to, Kevin?

1547
01:39:09,917 --> 01:39:11,281
Anywhere you want to go.

1548
01:39:12,352 --> 01:39:14,476
Sorry, I'm doing a solo
from now on.

1549
01:39:14,852 --> 01:39:15,845
Yeah, well.

1550
01:39:15,945 --> 01:39:17,178
It was worth a try.

1551
01:39:17,933 --> 01:39:19,431
Do you want another one?

1552
01:39:19,581 --> 01:39:21,878
Yeah, go on.
One for the road.

1553
01:39:22,978 --> 01:39:24,979
Tummy.

1554
01:39:26,734 --> 01:39:28,489
I just wish Dave could have
seen all this.

1555
01:39:28,594 --> 01:39:30,385
Yeah...
Here's to Dave.

1556
01:39:30,886 --> 01:39:32,086
To Dave.

1557
01:39:39,054 --> 01:39:40,569
What do you want, Martine?

1558
01:39:41,555 --> 01:39:43,614
I'm sorry I've caused you
this upset, Wendy.

1559
01:39:43,975 --> 01:39:45,850
Well, apparently we're rich.

1560
01:39:48,195 --> 01:39:51,656
I know the business is finished,
but are the cars really ours?

1561
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:55,415
Yeah.

1562
01:39:57,716 --> 01:39:59,216
They are all yours.

1563
01:40:00,797 --> 01:40:02,435
Jessul has been paid off.

1564
01:40:03,577 --> 01:40:04,917
I won't lie to you...

1565
01:40:05,767 --> 01:40:07,263
I would have gone with him,

1566
01:40:07,363 --> 01:40:09,758
and I would have shut
you out of my mind,

1567
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:12,939
but he didn't want to know.

1568
01:40:18,097 --> 01:40:19,488
I'm sorry.

1569
01:40:21,778 --> 01:40:24,979
- Your wife is talking to Martine.
- I know, Kev.

1570
01:40:25,379 --> 01:40:26,479
I know...

1571
01:40:29,618 --> 01:40:30,824
Good luck.

1572
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:47,302
It was always you, Terry.

1573
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:16,262
Daddy!

1574
01:41:16,362 --> 01:41:17,112
Hey!

1575
01:41:17,712 --> 01:41:19,313
Oh my God, Terry,
that's a big one.

1576
01:41:19,462 --> 01:41:21,466
Last a few chips though,
innit?

1577
01:41:21,566 --> 01:41:23,666
<i>- Don't, mom!</i>

1578
01:41:31,943 --> 01:41:33,973
- Fish fingers tonight, eh?
- What a pretty boy...

1579
01:41:34,305 --> 01:41:40,762
