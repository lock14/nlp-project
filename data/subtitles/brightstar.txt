1
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,108
It's mine.

2
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:33,275
-Get down.
-You're not allowed!

3
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:34,733
-Good day, Mr. Phipps.
-You're not allowed!

4
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:35,983
Get down.

5
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,441
You'll have no supper if you keep that up.

6
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,775
-Hello, Joy.
-Hello.

7
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,816
-Is all well?
-Very good. Thank you.

8
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,108
-Hello.
-Hello.

9
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,150
-Good morning, Joy.
-Hello.

10
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:55,025
-Sorry.
-Welcome.

11
00:02:57,025 --> 00:02:58,358
Where is Mr. Keats?

12
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:00,316
I'm afraid he is not joining us.

13
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,816
He's in Mr. Brown's half of the house.

14
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,691
Hello.

15
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:06,525
Hello.

16
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,025
The very well stitched Little Miss Brawne
in all her detail.

17
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,525
Good morning.

18
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:19,775
What is this? What have I done?
How have I offended?

19
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,316
I don't shake hands with the enemy.

20
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:26,358
An enemy? What have I done to you?

21
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:31,191
You do nothing to me or for me,
and that's how I'd prefer to keep it.

22
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:33,983
What?

23
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:37,650
Your offense is to my fashion, Mr. Brown.

24
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:38,691
Oh, dear.

25
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:41,275
To which I'm "so helplessly slavish."

26
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,316
I have been ill-quoted.

27
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:46,816
"Her obsession
with flounce and cross-stitch"?

28
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,150
Cross-stitch? Miss Brawne,

29
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:52,650
-I don't even know what that means.
-For goodness' sake. Baiting, baiting.

30
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,150
I feel the same about your poems,
Mr. Brown.

31
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,066
I know nothing of what they mean.

32
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,691
They puff smoke, dissolve,
leaving nothing but irritation.

33
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:06,358
Fanny, take this tea to Mr. Keats.
He is in very poor spirits.

34
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:09,858
Mr. Keats is composing
and does not want disturbing.

35
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,650
It's my finding in the business of disturbing,
you're the expert.

36
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,691
Fanny, why not speak to one of us
you hold in higher favor?

37
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:18,025
I'm praising him!

38
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,108
-Fanny.
-Please, Fanny.

39
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:23,525
I'm wanting to know what you shall say
about Mr. Keats.

40
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,316
I've been waiting two weeks
that I may enjoy your opinion.

41
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,816
I cannot look upon him without smiling.

42
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:33,983
And he is quick with his thoughts,
though now they are mostly sad.

43
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,733
His brother Tom's not at all better.

44
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,233
Very diminished.

45
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,941
Mr. Keats nurses him alone.
It's difficult work.

46
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:41,983
Mr. Keats nurses him alone.
It's difficult work.

47
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:46,108
-Is there no other family member?
-No. The parents are both dead.

48
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:51,275
There is only a much younger sister
and a brother who lives in America.

49
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,816
Come in.

50
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,900
You like jokes, Mr. Keats?

51
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:12,566
I like jokes.

52
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:16,191
Mr. Brown, I warn you,
does not like my jokes.

53
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,816
He complains I care for nothing but fashion.

54
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:27,066
Would you like biscuits?

55
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:30,983
You've come to spy.

56
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:33,816
Spy?

57
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:39,483
How will you describe me? My character?

58
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:43,024
I am not the least interested
in your character.

59
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:51,774
My jacket, then? Or my pantaloons?

60
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:58,441
You need a new jacket,
that's what I would say.

61
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,899
Is that all?

62
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,858
It should be of velvet, blue velvet.

63
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:11,358
Tell me, Miss Brawne,
how can you be so sure?

64
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:15,316
Well, all I wear,
I've sewn and designed myself.

65
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:18,358
I'm often told
I am clever to exception about design.

66
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:23,024
I originated the pleats on my dress,
which are charming...

67
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,941
Has she annoyed you sufficiently?
She has done brilliant well with me.

68
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,691
Men's room, out.

69
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:36,024
Poets got to do a bit of writing.

70
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,191
My stitching has more merit and admirers
than your two scribblings put together.

71
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:44,066
Goodbye, minxstress.

72
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,566
And I can make money from it.

73
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:20,066
Yes?

74
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,816
Have you got John Keats' poem book...

75
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:27,274
<i>-Endymion?
-Endymion, yes.</i>

76
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,941
Yes, I've not heard much good about it.

77
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,024
I've not sold one and took 20.

78
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:38,774
My sister has met the author,
and she wants to read it for herself

79
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:41,024
to see if he is an idiot or not.

80
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:07,566
Unwrap it.

81
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,108
Read it.

82
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:37,774
"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever
Its loveliness increases. It will never

83
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:43,108
"Pass into nothingness, but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep

84
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,649
"Full of sweet dreams, and health
and quiet breathing"

85
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:48,691
-Stop.
-"Therefore, on..."

86
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,607
"Yes, in spite of all

87
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,941
"Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits"

88
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,899
I'd love to speak with Mr. Keats.

89
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:06,232
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever
Its loveliness increases. It will never

90
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,066
"Pass into nothingness"

91
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,482
<i>You've read Endymion.</i>

92
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:13,441
I wanted to adore it.

93
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:18,399
-But you hated it?
-I can't say.

94
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:23,482
Are you frightened to speak truthfully?

95
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:26,857
-Never.
-Well, tell me then.

96
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,941
No. I'm not clever with poetry.

97
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:33,899
Well, neither, it seems, am I.

98
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:39,732
-Still I have some hope for myself.
-I think hope useful.

99
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:45,816
-But...
-Hope and results are different.

100
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,566
One doesn't necessarily create the other.

101
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,774
Would practice help?

102
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:56,232
It might.
I wasn't always able to stitch so well.

103
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:02,524
This is the first frock
in all of Woolwich or Hampstead

104
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,691
to have a triple-pleated mushroom collar.

105
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,107
Isn't that an identical one behind you?

106
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,524
My card's completely full.

107
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:29,941
But you don't dance, Mr. Keats.
I love to dance.

108
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,107
I don't feel like dancing.

109
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,899
Is your brother still ill?

110
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:39,274
He's no better.

111
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:43,232
My father was ill
for as long as I can remember.

112
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:47,274
He died when I was still very young.

113
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,691
Excuse me.

114
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:51,982
Miss Brawne, may I?

115
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:02,107
Mama!

116
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:08,691
Fanny has cut my ribbon,
and she never asked.

117
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,607
What are you doing, Fanny?

118
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,065
Trying to bring some comfort
to a dying man.

119
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,482
What dying man?
Where are you taking them?

120
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:23,274
I cannot offer poor Mr. Keats' brother
anything that's not perfect.

121
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:43,190
It's me. Miss Brawne.

122
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,524
I have something to deliver to Mr. Keats.

123
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:49,482
Leave it at the door.

124
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:53,565
-Is he not there?
-We're working, Miss Brawne.

125
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,649
I have something for your brother, Mr. Keats.

126
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:00,982
Invite her in. Brown!

127
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:13,232
You disgusting ape.

128
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:18,149
Be careful as you enter the ape's cage.

129
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,274
Sit next to me, Miss Brawne.

130
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:25,940
My prospects in the world feel very faint.

131
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:31,774
This room is so poorly cared for.

132
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,607
Please try one.

133
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:39,149
I'm anxious they'll cause him to choke.

134
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:47,274
No! Try another and I swear I shall bite you.

135
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,524
Take care. She has sharp teeth.

136
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,982
She has sunk her fangs into my poor poem
and shook it apart.

137
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,149
<i>I am very sorry I couldn't love
your Endymion completely, Mr. Keats.</i>

138
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:00,482
Perhaps I did not say,

139
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,524
but I thought the beginning of your poem
something very perfect.

140
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,940
But don't leave us. You can see for yourself,
nothing is happening.

141
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:15,482
All we do is lie about the room all day,
begging for inspiration.

142
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:18,232
Please, tell me what I should do.

143
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:25,065
Miss Brawne,
we monkeys just want a little company.

144
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:34,649
Well, I gave him the biscuits.

145
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:38,565
Mr. Brown kept...

146
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,690
If we've finished tiffing,
come and say hello to Tom.

147
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,107
It might cheer him.

148
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,857
We'll have to ask Mama.

149
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:49,524
-No, we don't, Toots.
-Yes, we do.

150
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,149
Isn't that so, Samuel?

151
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:53,315
We have to stick together.

152
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm going. You'll have to come with me.

153
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,357
Would you like to go by the pond
or through the woods?

154
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:09,107
I've explored all these paths, which are more
in number than your eyelashes.

155
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,065
My eyelashes?

156
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:22,940
You know, it amazes me
you can sit opposite Mr. Brown all day.

157
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:27,774
I've never heard him say one thing of wit.
Not one.

158
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,357
-You favor wit?
-I rate it the highest.

159
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:36,815
-You like the fashionables?
-Yes, I do.

160
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,982
Men who say things that make you start
without making you feel?

161
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,690
Things that are amusing.

162
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:48,773
I know these dandies.

163
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:54,148
They have a mannerism in their very eating
and drinking, their handling of a decanter.

164
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:58,565
You are making an attack on me?

165
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:03,107
No, I am defending
Mr. Brown's generous, good heart.

166
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:05,648
By attacking myself.

167
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:12,065
Forgive me.

168
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:15,357
I've been too long at my brother's sickbed.

169
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:20,982
Can we not still appreciate clever humor?

170
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:37,148
Thank God! He's been calling out for you.

171
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,023
Come in.

172
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:43,107
John.

173
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:45,232
-I didn't... I didn't...
-Tom.

174
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:47,148
-What?
-Tom, get back into bed.

175
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:51,398
-I don't know. I was having this dream.
-It's all right. I'm here now.

176
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:54,440
-I'm here.
-Where have you been, John?

177
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:57,898
-I just... I was worried.
-Calm now. Calm.

178
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,898
It's all right. I'm here.

179
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,648
It's so hot in this bed.

180
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,148
I was so scared for a while.

181
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,232
-Calm down.
-I just panicked.

182
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,815
I want to go. I want to leave. It smells.

183
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,982
Or I'll cut your hair in the night.

184
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:25,398
-Good evening, John.
-Young man, how are you?

185
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:27,107
Good evening.

186
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:29,273
Well, Keats,
I hope you've not forgotten your bassoon.

187
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,315
Of course not. It's in my waistcoat pocket.

188
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,482
-Hello, Mr. Keats.
-Hello, Minx.

189
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:34,940
How's Tom?

190
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:36,982
Gentlemen of the orchestra,
just through here.

191
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:38,982
Ladies, straight ahead, please. Thank you.

192
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,107
Hurry on, gentlemen.

193
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:42,398
Is he showing any signs of improvement?

194
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,898
Don't ask me of Tom, Minx.

195
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,857
The only good I can do
is say how I love him.

196
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:49,690
Hurry on, gentlemen.

197
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:55,107
Shall we open the claret?

198
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:06,607
<i>Someone submitted anonymously
to The Examiner a most exquisite sonnet</i>

199
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:11,357
composed on the subject of whether
Love itself could be the 10th muse. Severn!

200
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:12,440
-Come on.
-En garde!

201
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,648
Right.

202
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,482
That's my sword, you brute.

203
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,148
Love the 10th muse?

204
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:24,232
It's full of the most perfect allusions
and really beautifully realized.

205
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,523
I thought at first it might be one of yours.

206
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,357
<i>We were just telling Mrs. Brawne
of John Keats' review in Blackwood's.</i>

207
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:34,148
Was it so very bad?

208
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:40,273
"No man could have profaned and vulgarized

209
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,440
"every association in the manner which has
been adopted by this 'son of promise."'

210
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:50,940
Did they not admire the opening?
It was perfect. Even I could know that.

211
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:55,398
-Do you Like poetry, Miss Brawne?
-No.

212
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,232
Poems are a strain to work out.

213
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,398
John, we are talking, or are about to talk,

214
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:04,773
<i>of your defense
of Mr. Keats' poem Endymion.</i>

215
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,982
Yes.

216
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,565
"I have clung
To nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen

217
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:15,648
"Or felt but a great dream! O I have been

218
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,606
"Presumptuous against Love
against the sky

219
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:22,440
"Against all elements, against the tie
Of mortals each to each"

220
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:24,815
The rhythm is beautiful and unique.

221
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:27,565
There are rhymes, but not on the beat.
They're quiet, but binding.

222
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,690
And the repetitions set you up to fly.

223
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:34,440
"I have clung
To nothing, lov’d a nothing, nothing seen"

224
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,148
And here you come out
"Or felt but a great dream!"

225
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:38,315
It's beautiful.

226
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,606
Well, there are immaturities,
but there are also immensities,

227
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:42,481
and that is what they didn't say.

228
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,815
It was said. You said it, Brother.

229
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:46,273
Thank you.

230
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:47,815
Very bravely.

231
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,606
Ladies, the Hampstead Heathens
are about to begin.

232
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:56,356
-Reynolds?
-I thought I'd been expelled.

233
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,981
No. I think not. You're very much needed.

234
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:26,315
Mr. Keats is dead.

235
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:37,898
Mr. Keats is dead. So young.

236
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,606
Is it Tom?

237
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:34,273
I woke with the strange sensation
of someone holding my hand.

238
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:37,315
I opened my eyes, and there was John.

239
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,440
I knew immediately what had happened,
and then he said,

240
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:47,314
"Tom died at 8:00, quietly and without pain."

241
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:55,189
Of course, he can't go on living there,

242
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:59,189
so I have invited Mr. Keats
to come and stay with me.

243
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:03,273
Well, we do have a Long schedule of visits.

244
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:05,148
I don't want to interfere with your city plans,

245
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:07,064
but you are most welcome
to have dinner with us.

246
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:09,189
-Minx? Are you unwell?
-We have provided and set the table.

247
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:10,648
No, no, no, not at all.

248
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,856
-I've never seen you so quiet.
-I would appreciate it.

249
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:15,523
We do have some city business.

250
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,106
She sewed it all night Long.

251
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:34,231
It's a pillow slip.

252
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:39,231
Then I will rest Tom's head upon it.

253
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:51,148
Keats, the Reynolds are expecting us.

254
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:54,189
I'll catch you up. Thank you.

255
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:59,314
Invite me again, alone.

256
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,731
Come for Christmas.

257
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:12,439
Yes, please do join us, Mr. Keats, please.

258
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:16,939
But Marianne Reynolds invited us
for Christmas. Remember?

259
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:19,606
You were there when she said it.
They're having musicians.

260
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:21,273
I am sorry to spoil things.

261
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:24,148
Not at all. Wherever Mr. Keats is happy,
we're happy for him.

262
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:27,148
-Thank you, Mrs. Brawne.
-But why can't he be happy with us?

263
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:30,606
Perhaps Mr. Brown wants
Mr. Keats all to himself.

264
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:35,689
I am merely remembering to Mr. Keats
a previous engagement.

265
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:39,023
Miss Brawne, I thought we were conversing.

266
00:24:57,148 --> 00:25:00,148
"Dear Mrs. Brawne.
May I yet join you for Christmas?

267
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:03,273
"I have not the health
nor the heart to be anywhere

268
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:06,689
"but with a family such as your own.
John Keats."

269
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:21,273
Thank you.

270
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:47,106
I was wondering this morning
if you're sleeping in my bed.

271
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,773
Pardon?

272
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:53,439
You see, I believe you are.

273
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:55,773
We rented Mr. Brown's half of the house
this summer

274
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,189
while you were journeying in Scotland.

275
00:25:58,314 --> 00:26:00,023
Which room do you sleep in?

276
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:03,064
The one overlooking the back garden.

277
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:05,023
That was my bed.

278
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:10,106
For proof, pull it from the wall

279
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:13,022
and by the pillow, you will find a figure
I drew with pin holes.

280
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:14,772
Is the figure you?

281
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:17,439
It's a fairy princess.

282
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:23,564
-Should I be feeding her?
-She refuses to eat.

283
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:30,064
Would you teach me poetry?

284
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:36,231
I'd... I'd Like to understand it.

285
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:39,981
I don't know how to begin.

286
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:41,897
<i>And it's three to the right.</i>

287
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:44,314
Two, three. Three to the left.

288
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,064
Two, three.

289
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:56,814
And down. And keep it going.

290
00:26:57,814 --> 00:27:00,314
So that's the English drawing room.

291
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:04,439
And this is something
that I saw in Scotland.

292
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:12,439
They kick,

293
00:27:15,772 --> 00:27:17,939
and they jump,

294
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:21,356
and they twirl it,

295
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:26,522
and they sweat it,
and they tattooed the floor Like mad!

296
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:35,856
What about a poem?

297
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:39,731
-Yes. Please, Mr. Keats.
-A short one.

298
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:48,689
"When I have fears that I may cease to be

299
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:54,606
"Before my pen has glean'd
my teeming brain

300
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:59,897
"Before high-piled books, in charact'ry

301
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:04,356
"Hold Like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain

302
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:09,939
"When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face

303
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:15,106
"Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance"

304
00:28:25,314 --> 00:28:28,356
-I do apologize. I've gone blank.
-You're tired.

305
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:30,106
Should you Like some sweet?

306
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:31,897
Shall we have coffee and sweet?

307
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:18,731
Come through to our side.

308
00:29:38,897 --> 00:29:40,439
I've come for my poetry class.

309
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,939
Your poetry class?

310
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:50,480
Poetry classes!
Keats, are we teaching poetry today?

311
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:56,772
I hope I don't disturb.

312
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,814
Take a seat.

313
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:03,064
Have a look at that.

314
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:08,189
A poet is not at all poetical.

315
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,939
He is the most un-poetical thing
in existence.

316
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,647
He has no identity.

317
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:20,814
He is continually filling some other body,
the sun, the moon.

318
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,939
I cannot restrain my credibility longer.

319
00:30:25,647 --> 00:30:29,522
Miss Brawne,
is this really you or are you acting?

320
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:33,647
-It's really me.
-Is it?

321
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:36,105
Charles, I have a pupil.

322
00:30:37,147 --> 00:30:39,647
-Desist or depart.
-Apologies.

323
00:30:55,064 --> 00:30:58,980
My modest hope is that the cost
of the lesson will not be the poet.

324
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:03,105
The cost of the lesson is that Mr. Keats
will forthwith discuss poetry with me.

325
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:05,480
You don't mean to read the poems?

326
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,772
Until I know all the poets and poems
in the world,

327
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:10,147
since I've nothing to do,
as you so many times have noted.

328
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:12,105
I bow to your ambition.

329
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:24,772
Now he's gone, I shall find it easier to talk.

330
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,355
Can you say something
of the craft of poetry?

331
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,439
Poetic craft is a carcass, a sham.

332
00:31:49,147 --> 00:31:51,314
If poetry does not come as naturally
as leaves to a tree,

333
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,439
then it had better not come at all.

334
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:02,605
I am mistaken.

335
00:32:05,605 --> 00:32:07,105
I am not sure I can teach you.

336
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,480
Was I too rude? I... I can apologize.

337
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:15,689
I'm not sure I have
the right feelings towards women.

338
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,480
I'm suspicious of my feelings.

339
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:24,855
Do you not Like me?

340
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,897
I'm attracted to you without knowing why.

341
00:32:34,314 --> 00:32:36,814
All women confuse me, even my mother.

342
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,355
I yearn to be ruined by shrews
and saved by angels,

343
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,105
and in reality,
I've only ever really loved my sister.

344
00:32:51,189 --> 00:32:54,022
I'm annoyed by my sister
as often as I Love her.

345
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,689
I still don't know how to work out a poem.

346
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,605
A poem needs understanding
through the senses.

347
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:08,689
The point of diving in a lake

348
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,563
is not immediately to swim to the shore

349
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:18,730
but to be in the Lake,
to luxuriate in the sensation of water.

350
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:23,438
You do not work the lake out.

351
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:27,147
It is an experience beyond thought.

352
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:33,730
Poetry soothes and emboldens
the soul to accept mystery.

353
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:36,980
I Love mystery.

354
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:43,855
I found your fairy princess
on the wall in my room.

355
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:46,438
And you could make her out?

356
00:33:46,563 --> 00:33:48,188
She wears a butterfly frock.

357
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:52,897
Shall we continue?

358
00:34:07,772 --> 00:34:09,813
Mr. Keats is very brilliant.

359
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,147
I'm not sure he really likes me.

360
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:23,938
He prefers Toots and Samuel, even our cat,
who he is always petting to death.

361
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:27,938
Mr. Keats knows he cannot Like you.

362
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,313
He has no Living and no income.

363
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:54,980
Mr. Keats isn't here.

364
00:34:56,313 --> 00:35:00,188
He said to tell you he had a sore throat
and thought it best to stay on in Chichester.

365
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:02,522
Samuel, hello.

366
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,813
You don't believe me. Come in.

367
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,105
Come in.

368
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,730
There, no Keats.

369
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,063
Tell us, what Chaucer did you read?

370
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:20,147
All of it.

371
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:25,688
<i>Also, Mr. Spenser,
Mr. Milton, and The Odyssey.</i>

372
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,105
That's a lot to read in one week.

373
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,272
<i>What did you think of The Odyssey?</i>

374
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,605
Thank you.

375
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:41,063
I am yet partway through it,
but I have read all Mr. Keats has written.

376
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:43,022
Have you?

377
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:53,272
"Out went the taper as she hurried in

378
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,855
"Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died

379
00:35:59,688 --> 00:36:03,230
"She clos'd the door, she panted, all akin

380
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:06,813
"To spirits of the air, and visions wide"

381
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:10,897
<i>And... And what, Miss Brawne,
did you make of Paradise Lost?</i>

382
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,063
-I... I liked it.
-Did you?

383
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:20,772
You didn't find Milton's rhymes
a little pouncing?

384
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,313
No.

385
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,438
-Did you not?
-Not very.

386
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:39,022
Is it the material of her dress that makes
Miss Brawne's eyes so amber-Like?

387
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,938
Yes, they are golden.

388
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:47,771
-Amber almost.
-Yes, yes.

389
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:49,105
What color are yours, Mr. Brown?

390
00:36:49,271 --> 00:36:50,188
Mine?

391
00:36:58,063 --> 00:37:01,230
-Suitcase brown.
-Fanny!

392
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:09,813
Did you see Mr. Brown? He was amazed.

393
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,521
Well, all those authors in just one week
is a bit incredible.

394
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:15,771
I know.

395
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,646
But he sees I'm serious.
And I will read them.

396
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,188
Fanny, it's a letter.

397
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:38,230
I think it's a valentine.

398
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:05,355
"Darling Valentine, I am not sure
if you should have a kiss

399
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,230
"for your amber enchantress eyes
or a whipping.

400
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:16,605
"Yours, the Suitcase."

401
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:39,396
Fanny,

402
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,813
Mr. Keats is behaving very oddly.

403
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:48,938
Should I invite him inside?

404
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:05,313
-Mr. Brown sent you a Valentine?
-I think it was a joke.

405
00:39:07,313 --> 00:39:11,730
Keats! Keats! John, wait.

406
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,521
-John.
-I was away but 10 days, Brown,

407
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:27,646
with you encouraging me
to stay on and get well.

408
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:28,980
-John, easy.
-Now,

409
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:31,438
you write Miss Brawne a valentine card.
Are you lovers?

410
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:32,771
-John.
-Is that the truth?

411
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:35,105
-Easy.
-You sent a card, Charles!

412
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,938
You have the income to marry,
where I have not.

413
00:39:37,063 --> 00:39:38,230
Did you accept him, Miss Brawne?

414
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:41,438
John, I sent that valentine...

415
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:44,355
It was only a jest.

416
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:47,730
For whom? I'm not laughing.
Miss Brawne is not Laughing!

417
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:52,396
John, I wrote the valentine to amuse Fanny,
who makes a religion of flirting.

418
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,646
John, she's what?
A poetry scholar one week

419
00:39:53,813 --> 00:39:57,146
-and, what, a military expert the next?
-You disgust me.

420
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,396
It is a game. It is a game to her.
She collects suitors. John... John...

421
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:06,313
There is a holiness to the heart's affections.
Know you nothing of that?

422
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:20,563
Believe me, it's not pride!

423
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,646
You're in Love with Mr. Brown?

424
00:40:51,313 --> 00:40:53,104
Why don't you speak?

425
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:59,604
She can't speak because she only knows
how to flirt and sew.

426
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:04,104
Isn't that right?

427
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:13,438
Yes, and read all Milton,
whose rhymes do not pounce, Miss Brawne,

428
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:15,563
because there are none!

429
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:18,104
John, there are one or two of her kind

430
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:20,938
in every fashionable drawing room
of this city,

431
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,438
gasping over skirt lengths.

432
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:30,729
I'm sorry.
We can have a poetry Lesson tomorrow.

433
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:33,854
No! I want to dance and flirt,

434
00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:38,188
talk of flounces and ribbons
till I find my old happiness and humor.

435
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:55,979
What if the dwarf were to die in Act 2?

436
00:41:57,229 --> 00:41:59,354
And then we could introduce
the princess sooner.

437
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:00,979
The princess.

438
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:04,188
Perhaps Act 3 could begin with a tempest.

439
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:09,396
What else do you think?

440
00:42:30,438 --> 00:42:32,313
We're going to live next door.

441
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:35,979
The Dilkes are moving to Westminster,
and we get six months half rent!

442
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:39,104
So we'll be in the same house.
We can all play football.

443
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:42,188
It's a great economy for Mama.

444
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,688
But only if you Like.

445
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:49,104
Have we broken for the day, Keats?

446
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:53,604
Keats!

447
00:42:59,146 --> 00:43:00,521
-Throw the rope up.
-Excuse me, miss.

448
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:05,688
There should be another one of them.

449
00:43:09,813 --> 00:43:13,021
But if the princess has already abandoned
the dwarf,

450
00:43:13,146 --> 00:43:15,521
I mean, cannot we keep his Love speech?

451
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:19,563
We have to change it.
Find another place for it.

452
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:23,104
-We could give the Love speech to...
-Look out!

453
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,188
Sorry, right in the face.

454
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,313
Brown? Brown!

455
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:37,188
Oh, no!

456
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:41,604
-What was that, Toots?
-Oh, no!

457
00:43:53,187 --> 00:43:56,937
If Mr. Keats and myself
are strolling in a meadow,

458
00:43:57,604 --> 00:44:02,146
lounging on a sofa or staring into a wall,
do not presume we're not working.

459
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:06,521
Doing nothing is the musing of the poet.

460
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:11,604
Are these musings what we common people
know as thoughts?

461
00:44:11,937 --> 00:44:16,146
Thoughts, yes, but of a weightier nature.

462
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:18,271
Sinking thoughts?

463
00:44:18,479 --> 00:44:23,562
Not really, Miss Brawne. Musing,
making one's mind available to inspiration.

464
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:25,937
Mr. Brown?

465
00:44:26,312 --> 00:44:27,771
As in amusing?

466
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:32,979
Mr. Brown, our thoughts are all very simple,

467
00:44:33,146 --> 00:44:35,271
so you never need worry
about interrupting us.

468
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:38,604
And we should be happy
if you would join us for dinner on any day.

469
00:45:01,104 --> 00:45:02,604
Can I choose which bed?

470
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:38,229
Mr. Keats.

471
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:31,187
They're sniffing all the flowers in the garden
to try and find the best scent.

472
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:34,812
Mr. Keats is being a bee.

473
00:46:40,896 --> 00:46:42,146
Thank you.

474
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:46,437
Fanny!

475
00:46:47,396 --> 00:46:48,562
Come in.

476
00:46:49,062 --> 00:46:50,604
I need your help.

477
00:47:14,854 --> 00:47:17,895
Lie to me.
Tell me you did not dance last night.

478
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:21,312
I did not sit down a single tune.

479
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:25,895
You can see the truth in my slippers,
completely scuffed.

480
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:27,979
I don't know how I could have prevented it.

481
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:31,062
I don't want to sit and wait under the trees
while you talk.

482
00:47:31,187 --> 00:47:33,854
-I want to go and play on the swing.
-All right.

483
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:39,479
-Lovely.
-I'm not! Don't go lower. Go higher. Higher.

484
00:47:39,604 --> 00:47:40,854
No. A bit Lower.

485
00:48:05,979 --> 00:48:08,104
I had such a dream last night.

486
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,187
I was floating above the trees

487
00:48:12,812 --> 00:48:15,979
with my lips connected
to those of a beautiful figure

488
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:19,354
for what seemed Like an age.

489
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:23,770
Flowery treetops sprang up beneath us,

490
00:48:23,979 --> 00:48:27,770
and we rested on them
with the lightness of a cloud.

491
00:48:36,145 --> 00:48:37,770
Who was the figure?

492
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:55,437
I must have had my eyes closed,
because I can't remember.

493
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:00,604
And yet, you remember the treetops.

494
00:49:01,312 --> 00:49:03,270
Not so well as I remember the Lips.

495
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:11,979
Whose lips? Were they my lips?

496
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:54,979
Fanny?

497
00:50:07,895 --> 00:50:08,854
Fanny?

498
00:50:15,104 --> 00:50:16,437
Fanny?

499
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:21,270
Fanny!

500
00:51:28,437 --> 00:51:31,520
<i>Mr. Brown bet I couldn't find
the nightingale's nest.</i>

501
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:34,270
<i>There is no nest and no bet.</i>

502
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,145
That one over there.

503
00:51:40,312 --> 00:51:42,478
You couldn’t have seen it in a tree.
They don't nest in trees.

504
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:45,103
I know what I saw. It was a nightingale.

505
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:09,895
"Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest

506
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,645
"In sort of wakeful swoon, perplexed she lay"

507
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:18,228
See, here, there are tears.

508
00:52:22,145 --> 00:52:24,770
You're so far ahead of me and above me.

509
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:32,937
Brown, I'm amazed.

510
00:52:35,728 --> 00:52:42,270
Your writing is the finest thing in my life.

511
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:53,812
You wrote this, Little hand, did you do it?

512
00:53:04,062 --> 00:53:05,978
As one who truly loves you,

513
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:09,145
I must warn you kindly
of a trap that you are walking into, John.

514
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:14,020
If you are going to speak of Miss Brawne,
we have never agreed and cannot agree.

515
00:53:14,145 --> 00:53:18,437
For one or two of your "slippery blisses,"
you'll lose your freedom permanently.

516
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:22,228
You will be slaving at medicine
15 hours a day and for what?

517
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:25,270
To keep Mrs. Keats in French ribbon.

518
00:53:28,353 --> 00:53:31,103
I cherish your talent. I truly do.

519
00:53:31,228 --> 00:53:34,645
Then allow me my happiness,
for I am writing again.

520
00:54:03,437 --> 00:54:06,853
<i>"My heart aches,
and a drowsy numbness pains</i>

521
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:10,437
<i>"My sense, as though of hemlock
I had drunk</i>

522
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:14,186
<i>"Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains</i>

523
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:17,311
<i>"One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk</i>

524
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:25,603
<i>"'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot
But being too happy in thine happiness</i>

525
00:54:26,228 --> 00:54:29,311
<i>"That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees</i>

526
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:34,020

"In such an ecstasy!"

538
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,311
What?

539
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:48,353
Have you told Miss Brawne
of our summer holiday, or shall I?

540
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:53,770
Not as yet.

541
00:55:58,228 --> 00:56:02,770
Mr. Brown is doing his summer rental,
so we both have to Leave.

542
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:09,811
We're meeting up on the Isle of Wight
for some undisturbed writing and carousing.

543
00:56:26,311 --> 00:56:28,061
Mrs. Brawne, may I speak to Fanny, please?

544
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:30,853
No, I will not speak to him.

545
00:56:31,478 --> 00:56:33,686
Fanny, I was going to tell you.

546
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:44,311
Fanny, I have no money.

547
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,645
In fact, I am in debt.

548
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:54,561
I must earn. I must write and make a Living.

549
00:56:56,561 --> 00:56:57,936
If I fail, though I hate to think on it,

550
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:01,853
then I must make way so another may marry
and adore you as I wish to.

551
00:57:01,978 --> 00:57:08,145
No! I will not be adored ever again
by you or by anyone!

552
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:13,936
I hate you!

553
00:57:37,228 --> 00:57:38,228
Anything?

554
00:57:38,395 --> 00:57:39,770
No. Nothing.

555
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:47,019
Nothing.

556
00:57:53,478 --> 00:57:56,644
Fanny, will you check my stitch?
It's an open-work seam.

557
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:57,728
God.

558
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:00,936
No, Toots. I don't care a damn for stitches!

559
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:25,769
-No letter?
-Not today.

560
00:58:33,686 --> 00:58:34,894
Am I in Love?

561
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:40,228
Is this Love?

562
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:48,103
I shall never tease about it again.

563
00:58:53,019 --> 00:58:55,561
So sore I believe one could die of it.

564
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:34,061
<i>"My dearest lady,</i>

565
00:59:35,728 --> 00:59:37,978

00:59:51,811 --> 00:59:54,769

did not weigh so upon me.</i>

571
00:59:57,186 --> 01:00:01,019

not very cruel to have so entrammelled me,</i>

572
01:00:01,936 --> 01:00:04,228

573
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:10,394

my devotion to so fair a form.</i>

a fairer word than fair.</i>

<i>"Three such days with you
I could fill with more delight</i>

577
01:00:28,644 --> 01:00:31,353

578
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:38,061
I Love you.

579
01:00:40,728 --> 01:00:42,311
I Love you, Toots.

"Bedewed with pleasures."

602
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:43,352
-There's no air.
-No, Mama, they Love the heat.

603
01:02:43,477 --> 01:02:45,602
We're going to lose them.

604
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:50,727
Listen, "I Love you more in that I believe
you've Liked me for my own sake.

"I have met with women whom I really think
would Like to be married to a poem,

01:03:00,561 --> 01:03:03,769
Mama, don't be cross.

608
01:03:11,144 --> 01:03:13,769
When I don't hear from him,
it's as if I've died,

609
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:17,269
as if the air is sucked out from my lungs

610
01:03:17,436 --> 01:03:20,436
and I am Left desolate,
but when I receive a Letter,

611
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:24,769
I know our world is real.
It's the one I care for.

612
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:30,352
Watch the butterfly.

613
01:03:31,352 --> 01:03:32,769
Well, move it.

614
01:03:47,644 --> 01:03:50,727
-Fanny wants a knife.
-What for?

615
01:03:51,352 --> 01:03:52,894
To kill herself.

616
01:03:57,769 --> 01:03:59,102
It's all over.

617
01:04:01,144 --> 01:04:04,144
I have such a short letter after all this time.

618
01:04:05,352 --> 01:04:06,602
No, Topper!

619
01:04:13,186 --> 01:04:16,311
Saying he was in London, in London,

620
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,477
and couldn’t bring himself to visit
for fear it would burn him up!

621
01:04:20,811 --> 01:04:24,227
He's made no fortune and is ashamed of it.

622
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:28,936
If only he knew how Little I, even you,
care for that now.

623
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:47,560
You missed that one.

624
01:04:48,977 --> 01:04:51,394
-Hello.
-Hello.

625
01:05:02,852 --> 01:05:07,102
Mama asked me to welcome you home
and introduce you to Miss O'Donoghue,

626
01:05:07,227 --> 01:05:10,144
our new maid who may also do for you.

627
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:13,102
Please, sir, call me Abigail or Abby.

628
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,894
Very well. Be sure you do not enter
if the door is closed.

629
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,227
Yes, sir.

630
01:05:27,352 --> 01:05:30,602
Mr. Keats is not coming back.
He has gone to Live in London.

631
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,769
Please tell Mr. Keats that we Brawnes
have kept safe all his things.

632
01:05:49,977 --> 01:05:53,144
Mr. Brown has said that
I could learn to read still.

633
01:05:53,727 --> 01:05:56,435
I said to him, "Sure, what would I read?"

634
01:05:57,144 --> 01:06:02,394
And he said, "Abigail, even the Bible
is not so dull as you might believe."

635
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:07,602
And that in the Songs of Solomon,
there are some bits so juicy,

636
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:10,269
they'd make even a churchman blush.

637
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,310
And he said that when I get down
to the reading myself,

638
01:06:14,477 --> 01:06:17,769
I'll see he tells not one word of a lie.

639
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:35,144
Hello, Toots.

640
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:51,144
Hello, Mr. Keats.

641
01:06:52,894 --> 01:06:54,560
Hello, Miss Brawne.

642
01:07:00,852 --> 01:07:04,560
Mother? We found it.
Fanny had the key, Like I thought.

643
01:07:21,394 --> 01:07:23,185
What do you need for London?

644
01:07:56,644 --> 01:07:58,435
Your vest has no lining.

645
01:08:04,144 --> 01:08:05,602
And your coat

646
01:08:13,977 --> 01:08:15,727
has a small hole.

647
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,518
I could mend it so you wouldn’t see it.

648
01:08:22,518 --> 01:08:26,268
<i>"My sweet girl,
I am living today in yesterday.</i>

649
01:08:27,477 --> 01:08:30,268
<i>"I was in a complete fascination all day.</i>

650
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,268
<i>"I feel myself at your mercy.</i>

651
01:08:33,435 --> 01:08:35,393
<i>"Write me ever so few lines and tell me</i>

652
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,935
<i>"you will never forever be less kind to me
than yesterday.</i>

653
01:08:39,935 --> 01:08:41,727
<i>"You dazzled me.</i>

654
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:45,143
<i>"There is nothing in the world
so bright and delicate.</i>

655
01:08:46,977 --> 01:08:48,768
<i>"You have absorbed me.</i>

656
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:52,852
<i>"I have a sensation at the present moment
as if I was dissolving. "</i>

657
01:09:10,935 --> 01:09:14,852
Fanny, Mrs. Dilke is telling me that

658
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:18,977
Mr. Keats is proposing
to move in next door again,

659
01:09:19,143 --> 01:09:21,810
and she wants to know
if I have any objections.

660
01:09:21,977 --> 01:09:23,685
Of course you don't.

661
01:09:25,643 --> 01:09:28,435
Mr. Brown is Mr. Keats' best friend.
Why would we object?

662
01:09:30,518 --> 01:09:34,060
Fanny, Mr. Dilke and I are worried

663
01:09:34,185 --> 01:09:38,393
that such close connection
may prove restrictive for you.

664
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:39,810
No.

665
01:09:41,102 --> 01:09:44,560
Mr. Keats can't afford to marry.

666
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:48,102
His situation is really quite hopeless,

667
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:51,643
and if he is next door,
how will you meet anyone else?

668
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,810
How will you go to dances?

669
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,810
But you are engaged?

670
01:09:56,977 --> 01:09:59,060
It's his mother's ring.
It's not an engagement ring.

671
01:09:59,185 --> 01:10:01,143
You were not to wear it.

672
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,227
I wear it on the finger next door.

673
01:10:03,352 --> 01:10:04,393
Do not even discuss it.

674
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,518
You taught me to Love. You never said
only the rich, only a thimbleful.

675
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,935
Attachment is such a difficult thing to undo.

676
01:12:00,518 --> 01:12:03,435
"Pillowed upon
my fair love's ripening breast

677
01:12:06,435 --> 01:12:09,435
"To feel forever its soft swell and fall

678
01:12:11,726 --> 01:12:14,518
"Awake forever in a sweet unrest

679
01:12:16,768 --> 01:12:21,060
"Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath"

680
01:12:27,018 --> 01:12:28,393
That's new.

681
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,226
From which poem?

682
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:36,685
Yours.

683
01:12:47,601 --> 01:12:49,226
"Bright star,

684
01:12:51,643 --> 01:12:54,101
"would I were steadfast as thou art

685
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:59,643
"Not in lone splendor hung aloft the night"

686
01:13:06,726 --> 01:13:08,435
Why do you say "not"?

687
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:11,935
"Not in lone splendor"?

688
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:19,143
You fear I am not steadfast because
I oblige Mama by going to a dance?

689
01:13:22,643 --> 01:13:24,435
Don't tease, Fanny.

690
01:13:26,643 --> 01:13:28,351
Why are you Laughing?

691
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,685
I shall tell her I am unwell.

692
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,351
No, go.

693
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:40,976
Go.

694
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:45,435
Go.

695
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,560
Good Irish Abigail,

696
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:54,768
who never did fail to make a scone
as good as a swan.

697
01:14:01,226 --> 01:14:03,060
Would you Like some jam with that, sir?

698
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:04,435
Please.

699
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:11,601
Delicious.

700
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:22,893
Fanny! Come in. It's turned cold.

701
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:25,976
Mr. Keats has gone to London with no coat.

702
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:03,435
John, have you had wine?

703
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:08,101
I was severely chilled.

704
01:15:10,143 --> 01:15:13,351
I was on the outside of the coach,

705
01:15:16,851 --> 01:15:18,268
but now I don't feel it.

706
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:20,268
Abigail!

707
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:25,101
Abigail! Get up, dress yourself.
We need a doctor.

708
01:15:30,184 --> 01:15:32,559
Abigail, bring the water.

709
01:15:32,976 --> 01:15:35,018
I need a basin and a towel.

710
01:15:36,351 --> 01:15:37,559
And glasses, I need glasses.

711
01:15:37,684 --> 01:15:40,393
-Let me help. I can...
-Stand back, stand back.

712
01:16:08,184 --> 01:16:12,726
Keats has already asked to see Miss Brawne,

713
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:16,101
but I've managed him
and said that she had gone into town.

714
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:17,851
But I have not.

715
01:16:17,976 --> 01:16:21,309
I am speaking of keeping Mr. Keats calm.

716
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,934
This is a deception I will not join.

717
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:26,518
No, no, it is not a deception.

718
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:31,768
I am simply determined
to preserve the Life of my friend.

719
01:16:32,268 --> 01:16:34,351
You would have it that
I kill Mr. Keats with affection.

720
01:16:34,476 --> 01:16:36,768
-Fanny!
-Perhaps you will.

721
01:16:37,476 --> 01:16:41,393
Apparently, there is nothing I can do to
persuade you of the gravity of the situation,

722
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:45,184
but Keats is in my care
and all visits will follow my regime

723
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:46,601
or they will not happen at all.

724
01:16:46,726 --> 01:16:51,101
Please, we Brawnes will do whatever we can
to restore Mr. Keats to health.

725
01:17:07,768 --> 01:17:09,768
I was wondering where you were.

726
01:17:10,809 --> 01:17:14,059
I have been waiting
to be with you the whole day.

727
01:17:17,518 --> 01:17:19,268
Last night there was a...

728
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:27,934
There was a great rush of blood,

729
01:17:29,976 --> 01:17:33,143
such that I thought that I would suffocate.

730
01:17:36,309 --> 01:17:40,643
And I said to Mr. Brown,
"This is unfortunate."

731
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:45,268
My thoughts were of you.

732
01:18:14,476 --> 01:18:19,934
<i>"My sweet creature, when I send this round,
I shall be in the front parlor,</i>

733
01:18:20,643 --> 01:18:24,101
<i>"watching to see you show yourself
for a minute in the garden.</i>

734
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:31,934
<i>"When I look back upon the ecstasies
in which I have passed some days</i>

735
01:18:32,059 --> 01:18:34,101
<i>"and the miseries in their turn,</i>

736
01:18:34,268 --> 01:18:38,642
<i>"I wonder the more at the beauty
which has kept up the spell so fervently.</i>

737
01:18:39,559 --> 01:18:43,642
<i>"How horrid was the chance of slipping
into the ground instead of into your arms.</i>

738
01:18:45,476 --> 01:18:47,684
<i>"The difference is amazing, love. "</i>

739
01:18:53,892 --> 01:18:57,351
-Go on! Go on, now!
-No, Brown. Brown. Brown.

740
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,059
I get anxious if I don't see her.

741
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:08,892
Why not bed her?

742
01:19:09,601 --> 01:19:11,601
She'd do whatever you wished.

743
01:19:11,809 --> 01:19:13,476
It might relieve your condition.

744
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:29,059
<i>"Do not take the trouble of writing much.</i>

745
01:19:29,226 --> 01:19:33,476
<i>"Merely send me my good night
to put under my pillow. John Keats. "</i>

746
01:20:19,309 --> 01:20:22,017
<i>"Let me no longer detain you
from going to town.</i>

747
01:20:22,809 --> 01:20:25,642
<i>"There may be no end
to this imprisoning of you.</i>

748
01:20:27,476 --> 01:20:30,684
<i>"Perhaps you had better not come
before tomorrow evening.</i>

749
01:20:30,809 --> 01:20:36,351
<i>"You know our situation. I am recommended
not even to read poetry, much less write it.</i>

750
01:20:37,976 --> 01:20:40,101
<i>"I wish I had even a little hope.</i>

751
01:20:41,976 --> 01:20:43,809
<i>"I cannot say forget me,</i>

752
01:20:44,934 --> 01:20:48,517
<i>"but I would mention that
there are impossibilities in the world. "</i>

753
01:21:33,351 --> 01:21:38,017
John, why do you say "impossibilities"?

754
01:21:39,059 --> 01:21:42,601
I have coughed blood again.

755
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:52,351
I fear the disease has the upper hand

756
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:56,101
and I will not recover.

757
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:58,559
I can't Leave you.

758
01:22:01,434 --> 01:22:04,559
I have such clear hope
for your new book of poems.

759
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,767
John, they are more beautiful than
any I have read of Mr. Coleridge,

760
01:22:09,892 --> 01:22:13,100
Mr. Wordsworth, even Lord Byron.

761
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:20,350
"O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms

762
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:24,392
"Alone and palely loitering?

763
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:32,767
"The sedge has wither'd from the Lake
And no birds sing"

764
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:38,517
"I met a lady in the meads

765
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,767
"Full beautiful, a faery's child

766
01:22:45,892 --> 01:22:50,184
"Her hair was Long, her foot was light

767
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,225
"And her eyes were wild

768
01:22:56,267 --> 01:22:58,725
"I set her on my pacing steed

769
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,850
"And nothing else saw all day Long

770
01:23:05,142 --> 01:23:10,434
"For sidelong would she bend and sing
A faery's song"

771
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,934
"She found me roots of relish sweet

772
01:23:15,767 --> 01:23:18,725
"And honey wild, and manna dew

773
01:23:21,184 --> 01:23:26,309
"And sure in language strange she said
'I Love thee true"'

774
01:23:27,392 --> 01:23:29,767
"She took me to her elfin grot"

775
01:23:29,892 --> 01:23:34,100
"And there she wept, and sigh'd full sore"

776
01:23:34,892 --> 01:23:39,767
"And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four

777
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:44,267
"And there she lulled me asleep

778
01:23:45,684 --> 01:23:48,767
"And there I dream'd, ah! woe betide!

779
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:52,559
"The latest dream I ever dream'd

780
01:23:56,725 --> 01:23:58,517
"On the cold hill side"

781
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:08,475
Abigail?

782
01:24:13,475 --> 01:24:17,142
Here it is.
Mr. Brown said to give it to you tomorrow,

783
01:24:17,309 --> 01:24:18,892
but I'll not wait.

784
01:24:21,142 --> 01:24:23,100
He is the most cruel,

785
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,809
dead-hearted man in this entire world.

786
01:24:30,017 --> 01:24:31,434
Oh, my God!

787
01:24:33,059 --> 01:24:36,725
Oh, my God, I wish I were dead.

788
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:40,517
I am boiling with fury.

789
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:43,017
John, you must not convulse again.

790
01:24:44,142 --> 01:24:48,975
Abigail is with child,
but to whom, out of fear or shame,

791
01:24:49,142 --> 01:24:50,517
she would not say.

792
01:24:51,559 --> 01:24:55,559
We, Brown, must find out who it is,
and when we have his name,

793
01:24:55,684 --> 01:24:59,100
then butcher or baker,
he shall face up to his indecency.

794
01:25:01,767 --> 01:25:04,642
-Will you call her?
-It's not necessary.

795
01:25:07,934 --> 01:25:10,767
She has me believe I'm the father.

796
01:25:12,059 --> 01:25:15,559
My God, I had no notion of a Love affair.

797
01:25:20,184 --> 01:25:23,684
There was none,
or I must have slept through it.

798
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,934
With what ease you help yourself.

799
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,642
I have agreed to pay for the child.

800
01:25:33,517 --> 01:25:38,433
And the worst thing is
I can't keep this place.

801
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,392
I have to start my summer rental early.

802
01:25:43,558 --> 01:25:47,933
And I feel wretched turning you out
while you are so unwell,

803
01:25:49,142 --> 01:25:51,267
but, John, I can't do anything else.

804
01:25:52,017 --> 01:25:53,392
I'm overloaded with debt.

805
01:25:53,517 --> 01:25:55,225
Don't concern yourself.

806
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,933
-I shall manage.
-Stupid. Stupid.

807
01:26:10,517 --> 01:26:13,350
In what stumbling ways a new soul is begun.

808
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:16,642
I'd very much value your opinion, Mr. Keats,

809
01:26:16,808 --> 01:26:20,433
<i>on a new painting of mine,
The Cave of Despair. I was...</i>

810
01:26:20,558 --> 01:26:23,142
If you are suggesting he won't survive
another winter in England,

811
01:26:23,308 --> 01:26:24,642
then we must do something.

812
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:27,308
Gentlemen, I think we should hear
Dr. Bree on the issue of climate

813
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:28,642
for Keats' health.

814
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:31,683
Well, a move to a gentler climate
is essential.

815
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,808
I would recommend Italy.

816
01:26:33,975 --> 01:26:35,933
-Rome?
-Rome is good.

817
01:26:36,808 --> 01:26:40,267
-Does he want to go to Rome?
-Well, he has to go.

818
01:26:40,392 --> 01:26:43,100
He won't Live through another winter
in England.

819
01:26:47,975 --> 01:26:49,475
How do you feel about Italy, John?

820
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,100
I do think there is an issue of finance.

821
01:26:56,225 --> 01:26:59,683
Could we not, between us,
start a fund or a collection?

822
01:27:00,808 --> 01:27:02,225
It seems possible.

823
01:27:05,225 --> 01:27:08,767
Of course, he'll need a traveling companion.
Brown, you’ll go?

824
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:10,475
Absolutely, absolutely.

825
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,350
Someone must go.
I'm not sure I shall be able.

826
01:27:14,475 --> 01:27:17,100
-Is that a "no"?
-Miss. Miss.

827
01:27:28,267 --> 01:27:31,642
I can help find a room for the summer,
John, if you want.

828
01:27:34,433 --> 01:27:37,017
Sammy, walk behind.

829
01:27:40,725 --> 01:27:42,683
I want to go to Italy with you.

830
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,808
We can marry, and I'll go with you.

831
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,475
My friends talk of going to Italy,
but I have so Little money.

832
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,433
Spare a penny, sir?

833
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,058
I can barely afford
these Kentish Town rooms.

834
01:27:54,975 --> 01:27:56,392
Farewell me here.

835
01:27:56,517 --> 01:27:57,475
Why?

836
01:28:00,058 --> 01:28:01,642
We don't do linen.

837
01:28:08,767 --> 01:28:11,725
All right, I'm coming!

838
01:28:29,808 --> 01:28:31,392
Mr. Hunt can't have meant this room.

839
01:28:38,308 --> 01:28:40,225
I told you not to come.

840
01:28:42,933 --> 01:28:44,058
Go now.

841
01:28:48,392 --> 01:28:49,308
Go.

842
01:28:53,975 --> 01:28:55,350
Please start.

843
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,767
-Please start.
-Where's Fanny?

844
01:28:59,933 --> 01:29:00,850
Thank you.

845
01:29:02,225 --> 01:29:03,725
She's not eating.

846
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:19,891
Are you all right?

847
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:26,433
How Long has Mr. Keats been away?

848
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,891
Five weeks.

849
01:29:29,641 --> 01:29:31,683
Perhaps it is for the best.

850
01:29:33,308 --> 01:29:34,391
Whose best?

851
01:29:36,141 --> 01:29:41,016
I thought it might be a relief to be separated
when the circumstances are so difficult.

852
01:29:41,933 --> 01:29:46,183
You all wish I would give up, but I can't.

853
01:29:47,766 --> 01:29:49,850
Even if I wanted to, I cannot.

854
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:36,266
John!

855
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,100
Keep away from me if you do not Love me,

856
01:30:40,225 --> 01:30:43,100
if you have not a crystal conscience
this past month.

857
01:30:43,891 --> 01:30:45,391
Oh, my Love.

858
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:55,558
I thought my heart was breaking.

859
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,558
Mama! Mama!

860
01:31:02,933 --> 01:31:04,266
Mr. Keats?

861
01:31:04,766 --> 01:31:06,766
Toots, the door.

862
01:31:13,475 --> 01:31:14,891
Take care.

863
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:21,891
John. John?

864
01:31:27,308 --> 01:31:28,600
Thank you.

865
01:31:31,516 --> 01:31:33,933
-Was there any blood?
-No.

866
01:31:36,183 --> 01:31:37,933
Is he staying here?

867
01:31:39,266 --> 01:31:41,308
Yes, yes. Tonight.

868
01:31:43,391 --> 01:31:45,850
Well, I need to examine the patient.

869
01:31:57,766 --> 01:32:01,433
May he stay tomorrow?
Till he Leaves for Italy?

870
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,266
But you are not even officially engaged.

871
01:32:05,016 --> 01:32:06,558
Can't we be?

872
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:10,641
There is no end to this.

873
01:32:11,266 --> 01:32:14,016
Next, you’ll want to marry
then travel to Rome.

874
01:32:14,808 --> 01:32:17,433
I should never have moved into this house.

875
01:32:17,558 --> 01:32:18,558
I have let this happen.

876
01:32:18,683 --> 01:32:20,183
Just until Italy.

877
01:32:22,766 --> 01:32:26,308
You are already the source
of so much gossip.

878
01:32:26,475 --> 01:32:28,600
Well then, Let us be engaged.

879
01:33:09,641 --> 01:33:10,724
Toots.

880
01:33:21,558 --> 01:33:22,974
Have you been eating rosebuds again?

881
01:33:26,308 --> 01:33:28,308
So where do your cheeks get their blush?

882
01:33:35,141 --> 01:33:39,433
<i>I confirmed your ship,
the Maria Crowther, sailing for Naples.</i>

883
01:33:39,933 --> 01:33:40,933
When does she Leave?

884
01:33:41,099 --> 01:33:42,391
-In 10 days.
-So soon?

885
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:43,558
Autumn is coming.

886
01:33:43,724 --> 01:33:47,183
I'm afraid if you delay
there'll be less and less reason to hope.

887
01:33:48,099 --> 01:33:49,933
Then there's no putting it off.

888
01:33:51,891 --> 01:33:53,974
I must march against the battery.

889
01:33:54,099 --> 01:33:55,933
Allow me to pour you another, Mr. Severn.

890
01:33:56,058 --> 01:33:57,891
Really? Well, perhaps I might just tip it back.

891
01:33:58,016 --> 01:34:00,266
-Is his passage fully paid for?
-Yes, yes.

892
01:34:00,433 --> 01:34:02,016
Everything's taken care of.

893
01:34:05,058 --> 01:34:07,308
What if something should happen
to Mr. Keats

894
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:12,599
or even to you, in a foreign country?

895
01:34:13,849 --> 01:34:15,474
How would you survive?

896
01:34:17,099 --> 01:34:20,349
It shouldn’t be Severn. He barely knows him.

897
01:34:21,099 --> 01:34:22,933
Where is that fool Mr. Brown
when he is needed?

898
01:34:23,058 --> 01:34:25,016
And why hasn't he written?

899
01:34:26,683 --> 01:34:29,933
I found a goose for Mr. Keats' Last dinner.

900
01:34:33,474 --> 01:34:35,016
Don't say "Last."

901
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:47,016
...two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. And one, two, three.

902
01:34:47,183 --> 01:34:49,474
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

903
01:34:49,599 --> 01:34:52,558
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

904
01:34:58,599 --> 01:34:59,724
Toots?

905
01:35:03,474 --> 01:35:04,683
Mr. Keats?

906
01:35:04,808 --> 01:35:06,474
One, two, three...

907
01:35:10,849 --> 01:35:13,266
-She's gone.
-What happened there?

908
01:35:21,933 --> 01:35:26,683
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

909
01:35:26,808 --> 01:35:28,141
Very good.

910
01:35:32,974 --> 01:35:36,433
And don't come back.
There's no autumn around here.

911
01:35:37,183 --> 01:35:38,349
Careful.

912
01:35:41,058 --> 01:35:42,599
Are you all right?

913
01:35:45,474 --> 01:35:46,933
Shall we sit down?

914
01:36:46,599 --> 01:36:48,641
Mrs. Brawne, that's for you.

915
01:36:50,599 --> 01:36:52,182
It's beautiful.

916
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:55,141
My dear, mad boy.

917
01:36:56,099 --> 01:36:57,641
Is it successful?

918
01:36:58,141 --> 01:37:01,557
There were two very positive reviews,
by friends,

919
01:37:02,932 --> 01:37:06,849
and six mainly positive and four hostile.

920
01:37:09,724 --> 01:37:11,266
I don't know, is that successful?

921
01:37:11,432 --> 01:37:13,849
Yes, extremely so.

922
01:37:15,182 --> 01:37:16,599
So they're selling well?

923
01:37:22,349 --> 01:37:24,891
Come back. Live with us.

924
01:37:25,766 --> 01:37:27,266
Marry our Fanny.

925
01:37:44,141 --> 01:37:45,432
I Love you.

926
01:37:53,682 --> 01:37:55,849
We should say our goodbyes now.

927
01:38:12,766 --> 01:38:14,224
Shall we awake

928
01:38:19,807 --> 01:38:21,932
and find all this is a dream?

929
01:38:26,474 --> 01:38:27,557
There must be another Life.

930
01:38:27,724 --> 01:38:30,932
We can't be created
for this kind of suffering.

931
01:38:42,807 --> 01:38:46,724
I doubt that we will see each other again
on this earth.

932
01:38:53,057 --> 01:38:55,432
Then why are you leaving?

933
01:38:57,391 --> 01:38:58,891
Why must you go?

934
01:39:00,266 --> 01:39:02,682
Because my friends have paid my way.

935
01:39:04,266 --> 01:39:06,349
It is a hopeless hope,
but how can I refuse them?

936
01:39:06,474 --> 01:39:08,182
Say you are too ill.

937
01:39:10,182 --> 01:39:13,099
We have woven a web, you and I,

938
01:39:15,016 --> 01:39:17,057
attached to this world

939
01:39:18,182 --> 01:39:20,932
but a separate world of our own invention.

940
01:39:21,766 --> 01:39:23,974
We must cut the threads, Fanny.

941
01:39:24,682 --> 01:39:25,766
No.

942
01:39:27,016 --> 01:39:28,224
No.

943
01:39:31,057 --> 01:39:32,849
I can't.

944
01:39:35,099 --> 01:39:36,432
I never will.

945
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,474
You know I would do anything.

946
01:39:55,932 --> 01:39:57,599
I have a conscience.

947
01:40:14,682 --> 01:40:18,557
-Let's pretend I will return in spring.
-You will return.

948
01:40:30,765 --> 01:40:32,807
We will Live in the country.

949
01:40:36,349 --> 01:40:37,765
Close to Mama.

950
01:40:39,765 --> 01:40:43,099
And our bedroom will Look out
onto a Little apple orchard

951
01:40:44,265 --> 01:40:46,765
and, beyond that, a mountain in a mist.

952
01:40:48,724 --> 01:40:52,890
We can make a garden
where every sort of wildflower grows.

953
01:40:55,265 --> 01:40:59,182
And we will go to bed
while the sun is still high.

954
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:05,724
And when it becomes dark,
the moon will shine through the shutters.

955
01:41:13,224 --> 01:41:17,224
And I will hold you close
and kiss your breasts,

956
01:41:19,599 --> 01:41:22,932
your arms, your waist.

957
01:41:27,557 --> 01:41:28,890
Everywhere.

958
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:42,557
Touch has a memory.

959
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,224
I know it.

960
01:42:17,765 --> 01:42:19,099
Not a word.

961
01:43:01,515 --> 01:43:04,849
Mama, Mr. Brown's baby has red hair.

962
01:43:05,015 --> 01:43:06,515
Hello!

963
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,890
You beautiful boy.

964
01:43:10,973 --> 01:43:14,015
Hello. Well done. Well done.

965
01:43:14,598 --> 01:43:15,932
Hello.

966
01:43:16,515 --> 01:43:18,473
It is so nice to meet you.

967
01:43:22,848 --> 01:43:24,765
You've seen the baby?

968
01:43:26,765 --> 01:43:29,057
Looks Like Abigail.

969
01:43:35,265 --> 01:43:37,057
John's reached Naples.

970
01:43:38,723 --> 01:43:40,682
They quarantined his ship.

971
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:46,890
He wrote that he made more puns
out of desperation in two weeks

972
01:43:47,015 --> 01:43:49,640
than he had in any year of his Life.

973
01:43:52,973 --> 01:43:56,182
I should have Liked to have been there
to have heard them.

974
01:43:56,765 --> 01:44:00,348
You could have, had you gone.

975
01:44:09,432 --> 01:44:11,182
It's not that simple,

976
01:44:11,348 --> 01:44:15,390
with a baby and my funds reduced.

977
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:22,557
And then there is this issue
of the snow and the Alps.

978
01:44:22,973 --> 01:44:24,640
And lack of will.

979
01:44:33,057 --> 01:44:34,765
Shall I say it aloud?

980
01:44:35,765 --> 01:44:37,182
Will that satisfy you?

981
01:44:41,432 --> 01:44:42,765
Shall I say it?

982
01:44:43,973 --> 01:44:45,932
I have failed John Keats.

983
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,557
I failed John Keats.

984
01:44:50,182 --> 01:44:53,307
I failed John Keats!

985
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:56,557
I failed him! I failed him!

986
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:04,432
I did not know until now how tightly
he'd wound himself around my heart.

987
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:17,640
It's for you, Mama. It's from Italy.

988
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,848
It's from Mr. Keats.

989
01:45:37,598 --> 01:45:39,807
He says, "It looks Like a dream."

990
01:47:01,265 --> 01:47:02,598
Start again.

991
01:47:37,265 --> 01:47:38,681
It's cold out.

992
01:47:41,973 --> 01:47:42,931
How are you all?

993
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:46,181
We're all quite well enough,
but how is Mr. Keats?

994
01:47:46,806 --> 01:47:51,598
Mrs. Brawne, it is as unbearable to me

995
01:47:53,598 --> 01:47:55,598
as I know it is to you.

996
01:47:58,015 --> 01:47:59,681
Mr. Keats has died.

997
01:48:02,265 --> 01:48:04,973
I received an account from Severn,

998
01:48:05,931 --> 01:48:09,765
and I've copied it for you, Miss Brawne.

999
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:13,890
Shall I just read it?

1000
01:48:26,556 --> 01:48:30,015
"Friday, the 23rd of February.

1001
01:48:31,431 --> 01:48:34,765
<i>"At four in the afternoon, Keats called me,</i>

1002
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:39,306
<i>"'Severn, Severn, lift me up for I am dying.</i>

1003
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,098
<i>"'I shall die easy.</i>

1004
01:48:43,515 --> 01:48:46,890
<i>"'Don't be frightened.
Thank God it has come. '</i>

1005
01:48:48,598 --> 01:48:53,765
<i>"At one point, a cold, heavy sweat broke out
over his whole body, and he whispered,</i>

1006
01:48:55,390 --> 01:48:59,056
<i>"'Don't breathe on me. It comes like ice. '</i>

1007
01:49:00,765 --> 01:49:02,265
<i>"Keats died imperceptibly. "</i>

1008
01:49:02,473 --> 01:49:03,806
No more.

1009
01:49:29,723 --> 01:49:31,431
Oh, God.

1010
01:49:34,223 --> 01:49:37,556
Oh, God. John!

1011
01:49:42,598 --> 01:49:43,723
Mama!

1012
01:49:51,765 --> 01:49:53,098
Mama!

1013
01:49:54,473 --> 01:49:57,515
I... I can't breathe.

1014
01:49:59,806 --> 01:50:01,098
Mama!

1015
01:50:14,139 --> 01:50:15,848
Mama!

1016
01:51:22,889 --> 01:51:26,098
Sammy! Samuel!

1017
01:51:51,973 --> 01:51:53,973
"Bright star,

1018
01:51:55,431 --> 01:51:59,223
"would I were steadfast as thou art

1019
01:52:01,764 --> 01:52:05,973
"Not in lone splendor hung aloft the night

"And watching, with eternal lids apart

"Or gazing on the new soft fallen masque

01:52:40,139 --> 01:52:46,556
