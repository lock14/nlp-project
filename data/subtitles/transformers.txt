l think everybody likes the idea



of taking something that
you're familiar with



and turning it into something that
you're not as familiar with,



like a 1 8- wheeler semi
into Optimus Prime,



and so that was the beginning.



l joined Hasbro in 2000,



and the company was in
some degree of difficulty.



So we were focusing back
on our core brands



and Transformers was
one of those brands



that we began to really
rethink about.



And how do we reignite this
brand or future generations?



l was aware of the TV show.
l used to watch it with the kids,



and l thought, ''This is
a movie waiting to come out



''and be dusted off, and to be
reinvented as a live- action experience.



l'm going to end your hunger
once and for all!



We were initially really resistant to
the idea of doing it,



because it's something that
we had cared about as kids



and that's always kind of a...



lt's on the one hand, really exciting
to take that challenge



and, on the other hand, you go,
''l don't want to screw this up.



The first thing that l sat down
with the writers was an idea



to make this a story
about a boy and his car,



because that's something
everybody can relate to.



Bumblebee, head for the underground
parking entrance.



Transformers were always
about robots in disguise



and ''more than meets the eye.



And that ''more than meets the eye'' could
mean more than just the robots.



''More than meets the eye'' could mean
something about the human characters.



But there were very few humans that
we could draw from,



so it meant coming up with characters
that didn't exist before.



ln the original cartoon
there was a mechanic character



who was kind of the basis for Sam.



We looked to movies like E. T. for
the way that Elliott became the audience



and how we were experiencing
the wonder and the magic



of E. T. coming to Earth.



Our first draft, actually,
was just focused on the kids.



That's awesome!



Steven Spielberg called me right
when l was finishing The lsland,



and he said,
''Like to do Transformers?



and l'm like, ''Okay. All right,
l'll think about it,



hung up. ''l'm not doing that movie.



That's what l said to myself.
''l'm not doing a toy movie.



l thought about it, and
l went to Hasbro in Rhode lsland,



and they put me through
Transformers school.



This is the classic G1 Optimus Prime,



very much like it was made in the '80s.
He had a very simple transformation.



Very easy to get from vehicle to robot.



We did the full pitch.
Robots are not all equal.



They're alive,
they're sentient men.



They have feelings,
they have allegiances.



You know, there's back- story,
there's a conflict.



You know, that they are
fleshed- out characters,



and that we've had so many eras,



and there's so much potential
that they could pull from



to make whatever kind of movie
they wanted to make.



Something in Transformers just struck me
when l was sitting there.



l said to myself, ''lf you can make
this really real and edgy.



And l saw a couple of images
that were towards the direction



they would like to take this, and
l'm like, ''That's really interesting.



So, l think, right then and there
l was kind of sold on



trying to make this idea work.



Michael Bay was born to
direct Transformers.



He was the perfect fit for
this concept.



l hired a team of probably
about 25 artists,



different people from
different kinds of expertise



and we were starting to design robots.



There was apparently a script,
l hear it was way too kiddie.



No one wanted me to read it 'cause
they thought l would quit



right then and there.



Michael has incredible instincts
about what will please an audience,



and so as we were
developing the script,



we would run ideas by him.



We'd say,
''What do you think about this?



l knew l wanted to make it
very credible and serious,



and l told these guys l wanted to
broaden it out and make it



so that it had
a little more global impact.



Much like Close Encounters
of the Third Kind,



Richard Dreyfuss's story is
clearly the centrepiece



as Shia LaBeouf's story is
the centrepiece of our movie.



But then we have two other groups
of humans that we follow quite closely.



l kept putting in things of different
action stuff that l saw,



and what we'd do is that we'd
sit down, we'd bat it around,



and they see what l'm
really liking and not liking.



Once he got into the rhythm of it,



he started imagining
these incredible sequences



and a lot of what we ended up
doing action- wise was very collaborative.



He is the sickest action director
on the planet.



That is something that he is.



He's not Elia Kazan,



and Mike'll tell you that.



Oh, that's funny. Wasn't that funny?



Robots there with
a missile coming right down



that street down there.



lt's gonna hit that truck right there,
the robots are holding it up.



- Okay, roll cameras!
- Roll them out! Okay, speed!



- Ready?
- Ready?



- And...
- And...



Four, three, two, one!



Michael staged huge,
logistically complicated scenes



of massive destruction and explosions
and even when l was watching



those dailies without
the actual Transformers there,



it was just eye candy.



ln this movie, Michael is the star,



and Michael is so much fun.



We line everything up with the football.
Ready and hike!



And three, two, one, bam!



- Does that work?
- Yeah.



That's perfect.



Three, two, one, and bam!



Action!



l think ''Bayhem's'' a good word
if you're working with Michael.



l mean, we have to be prepared
to go in any direction.



Fifteen over.



Cut!



Might show up and say,
''Today, l want to flip a car.



You have to be three steps
ahead of Michael.



Smells good.



You hear on the walkie
when l'm walking in, ''Bay's coming in.



''He's coming in hot,
he's coming in hot.



Here we go, ready?



You know it's all wired 'cause
l'm ready to go.



When l come in to the set,
l want to start shooting.



Come on, on cameras! Let's go!



He's got a tireless kind of energy,



and l understood that that's
how he gets into it,



and then he's into it just like
an actor getting into character.



Jim, lift him up again.
Do it again, do it again!



Keep rolling. Ready?



Oh, God! Oh, God!



Oh, God!
Please don't kill me! Please!



Keep moving up, moving up,
moving up, moving up!



Okay, okay, okay!



Jim, lift him up again.
Do it again, do it again!



Keep rolling. Ready?



Mike needs people
who can accommodate his needs,



and you need to be able to adapt.



You can't be the guy
who's got the script notes



and the ledger and...''No, l can't do
that 'cause in the next scene l...



You can't be that guy.
Michael will eat you alive.



This ain't gonna...



lt ain't gonna...Trust me,
l saw it. l'd sit under it.



''Trust me, l said.



- Ready?
- Three, two, one, action!



Cut!



What he is, is he's very honest.



He's very blunt, he's very direct,



- he's very opinionated.
- Give me a shot, Dave.



And he has an amazing
visual sense of film.



Yeah!



He likes to use the megaphone
once in a while.



Ready and rolling cameras!



Three...Two...One...



Stay there!



Behind the car! No, you're going the
wrong way! The other way, other way!



God, he doesn't pay attention to
what we're shooting.



The thing about it is,
it's never personal.



- Yeah, buddy.
- Really?



Here, Randy.



Watch.



l've worked with a crew,
many of the same people,



for 1 0, 1 5 years.



So they know my style,
they know my pace.



- Hey, Mike!
- Michael!



You guys pulled that well.



l was, like, over here distracted.



There's a lot of success
attached to what Michael does



and a lot of careers have prospered
by being part of the films with him,



so he attracts a lot of actors.



How do you know
you're getting a good shot?



l've been doing
this for a long time.



One of my producers,
lan Bryce, said to me,



''You should get this kid Shia.''



And l said,
''l thought he was older.''



So he came in and he actually
looked like a 1 6- year- old.



- Now, tell me what happened.
- No, no,



you said you'd pick me up,
no questions asked.



l know that was the deal.



Pop, remember how Great- gramps



pretty much flew over
the cuckoo's nest?



Do you think it could have been passed
on to me like a mutant Witwicky gene?



First, l was like,
''Wow, l'm making a Transformers movie.''



lt's insane, you know.



They're gonna mess that up completely.
Screw that up so bad.



But when l first sat there with Mike,
it was never the discussion of,



''Let's talk about the robots.''



The first thing
he wanted to talk about was,



''How do we make this real?''



''How do we make these characters
come across as honest?''



Gentlemen.



Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the Hershey squirts.



How can l help you?



My son here is looking to
buy his first car.



What l like about Shia is
he's the everyday dude



but he's great at improve
and he's got a great comic wit.



Nice, right? lt fits me.



Shia's one of the funniest people,
just naturally.



lt's hard to get through
scenes with him sometimes



because he's so good at improv



and he gets funnier and funnier
as he goes.



l just didn't recognise you.



Yeah, well, l mean,
that's understandable.



You know, l just got back from fat camp.
l lost, like, 80 pounds.



Oh, you know what?
Good for you.



- Yeah.
- That's good for you.



- Yeah, yeah, l learned a lot.
- lt makes you a stronger person.



- Yeah, physically and mentally.
- Yeah.



- And so...
- Did you make friends?



Yeah, l mean some of them died
'cause diabetes is really chronic there,



but l mean, like, there's three or four
that l kept in contact with



and they're really good people.



You know, 'cause fat people
aren't bad people,



and that's one of the main things
they teach you there.



lt's hard for me to try to not laugh
'cause l get in trouble



'cause we won't ever
make it through a scene.



l just put the light in.



Most importantly, l think
he can keep up with Bay.



Bay is constantly
evolving the characters,



is constantly throwing
something different at you.



My first scene actually
was with the dogs.



lt was like, ''Welcome to Michael Bay's set.
Release the hounds.''



You need to stay hidden
until l tell you, okay?



Yes, yes.



The trainer is worried about your ass.



But we are insured.
DreamWorks, through Paramount.



You know, it's your first day.
''Hey, welcome.''



And the whole crew's like,
''Hey, nice to meet you,''



and ''Action,'' and you're running.



Dogs sort of get smart
after a while.



And instead of stopping at camera,
the dogs kept chasing Shia.



Don't chase him!
Don't chase him!



Fortunately, Shia ran past me
about 30 miles an hour,



and l was able to grab the long
chain that was attached to the dog.



Thank God, Shia's a fast runner,
all right?



Because that thing wasn't stopping.



lt was gonna clamp down on
that poor kid's ankle, l'm telling you.



That would have been
the end of me in this film.



lt would have been the first day.



No, no, no, no!



Bay talked about
how hot Mikaela was gonna be.



We talked about finding, literally,



the most gorgeous 1 8- year- old there is
out there, which l think we did.



- l think we did.
- l think we did.



And action.



Oh, God, if Trent could just
see me right now.



Yeah. Wait, what?
lf Trent could...



Trent. Yeah, if Trent could see
me right now. This is crazy.



We interviewed a lot of different
young women for this,



and Megan, l don't know,
l just liked her look,



l liked that no one really
knew about her.



l think Shia helped her out.



l think that energy between them,
l think it kind of works.



l hope l didn't get you stranded
or anything like that.



No, it's fine.



So, l was wondering
if l could ride you home.



l mean, listen,
l was headed this way,



l figured, you know,
l'd ask if you want a ride or not.



- l'm just putting it out there.
- All right, let's go again.



Yeah, don't say, ''lt's fine.''
Just kind of a nod.



The only thing Mike asked me when l was
reading with him and auditioning,



he just asked me if l could run.
He's like, ''Can you run?''



l was like,
''Yeah, l think so.''



And the other thing
he asked me,



he goes, ''Do you have
a nice stomach?''



And l said, ''Well,
in my opinion, yes, l do.''



So l figured l'm gonna be running,
hopefully not naked,



but l'll be running in
a belly shirt maybe.



Go!



Megan did good.
With all the running and jumping



and car skidding and
everything else going on,



l think Megan
really hung in there.



And drop!



Just from filming, l've put on, like,
almost 1 0 pounds of muscle.



Hey, guys, give me
a 30 pad right here.



Coming at 'em.



All right, we're off,
and roll camera.



All right, here we go.
Look back...Here we go.



And cut! That's good.



That's good.
Let's go to lunch.



- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.



- We needed a leading man.
- Yeah.



We needed a leading man.
There were lots of great actors out there,



but a leading man is
very different from just a good actor,



and Josh encompasses that.



l'm thinking l might win
an Academy Award for this role.



No, l don't want
a premium package!



Come on! Go on!
Fall back!



''Best Screaming in a Movie.''



Lennox!



- Oh, water, thank you.
- Give me chocolate.



''You got chocolate?''
Say, ''Give me chocolate.''



You got chocolate?



l liked him as a person 'cause he was,
like, very American, kind of no BS,



kind of just a nice guy.



Colonel Moore offered me the opportunity
to go up in a T- 38 today.



A lot of these military guys
were very much like Josh,



so l thought
it worked really well.



Yeah, l'm with the top dog.



You'll be fine.



l had to go through about
four or five hours of training



and, you know,
they basically tell you,



''Okay, this is what's gonna happen
if you have to eject from a seat.''



l had to change shorts
after l left training.



l get to fly in a T- 38 today



- Not too snug, but not too loose.
- Okay.



Pull them tight.



And that snap rolls
from bottom to top.



Take a breath and
hold it, please.



- There you go.
- And that's how it sits.



l am happy if l get a chance to show



what we in the Air Force can do



and what great airmen we have.



lt was one of the most exciting things
l've ever done,



and he let me actually
fly it a little bit.



He was, like, ''Okay, turn to 1 0 degrees,
and we'll go down to 1 ,500 feet.''



l didn't throw up once.



Starneisha, Taneisha and Keisha.



You all laughing at
my daughters' names?



Yeah.



Damn, get me home.



All right, cut. All right.
All right, good.



Tyrese, he paid me to be
in this picture, so l took his money.



Michael Bay keeps everybody on edge,



so we can all stay sharp
and on top of our game.



'Cause he's on top of his game.



And, you know, if you don't step up,
you get left by the wayside.



Ready? Action!



Hello? Do you hear me?



You hear me now?



Hello? Hello? Hello?



Hello? Hello?



No, l got no bar! l got no bar!



l had a little situation right
before l started filming.



l just got sick, really sick,



and l ended up missing, like,
the first three days of filming.



So to get back on the set



after all of the warnings and precautions
my doctor hit me with



and to be in Alamogordo
was just crazy.



Hundred and twenty- some degrees,
white sand bouncing the sun.



Bam, can't even look at the sand
'cause it was so bright.



Just hot. Hot for
no damn reason at all.



- Cut. All done?
- Mark it.



- ls that good?
- Good.



l've always wanted to
work with John Turturro



and l'm really glad l did.



And l was intimidated
the first day of working with him



and l got on
with him very well.



Rolling!



Ready? And action.



Your son's the great- grandson of
Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?



lt's Witwicky.



- Witwicky?
- Witwicky.



May l enter the premises, sir?



Don't laugh!



l've definitely been enjoying myself.



l feel like l've been able to
be a little creative and imaginative.



Sometimes you don't
get a chance in a really big film.



Get that thing to stop, huh?



Looking at us. Looking at us.



Get that thing to stop!



l love working with Turturro.
He's a funny guy.



And he does phenomenal impressions
of people in the business.



And he knows everyone.



He does a Scorsese imitation
that'll just bring the house down.



''Every film he ever made was
flashing through my mind.



''Silver Chalice,
The Hustler, this, this or this.



''So, l'm out of my mind.
He's Paul Newman,'' he goes.



''How am l going to direct him?''



She did it! She did it!



She's the one you want!
She's the criminal, okay?



Okay, look, l'll wear a wire.
l'll turn state's evidence.



- l'll do whatever you need me to do.
- What? Glen!



Hey! No, no, look, l'm not going
to jail for you or for anybody!



Michael will come in
and tell us what he likes



and what he wants
conveyed and that.



Let's just try to
have some fun with it.



Come on, come on, focus, Glen!



Then the thing's going to whiz by.
Ready? And...



What was that?



Oh, l got a family history
of heart trouble.



He gives us the freedom,
and we have fun.



And Steven Spielberg was on set



and said that he had
been watching dailies.



Hello.



''Who wrote that?'' l did.



l did, Steven.



You know. l didn't even
charge you for it.



l'm gonna charge you
on the next one though.



- l'm Sam Witwicky.
- Maggie. Hi.



- Did you say ''Witwicky''?
- Yeah.



Both girls needed to
be drop- dead gorgeous.



And there's gorgeous
with the right persona, too.



ln this film, l wear, like,
six- inch stilettos.



And l have been
running away from aliens,



keeping up with John Turturro,
Jon Voight, Anthony, the whole gang.



ln heels, l might add.



l challenge Michael Bay to
direct for one hour in those things.



Point it away
from her just a little.



- Rotate the gun.
- Rotate the gun.



There you go.



Just, like, not too far.



Okay, ready?



l'm kind of a pacifist,
you know.



Like, l don't really like
the whole action- movie- gun thing,



l'm kind of very anti- weapon.



But, God, it was fun.



- l'm a signals analyst!
- Then send a signal then!



Come on, you punk!



l love Jon Voight
'cause he's a great actor



and he's a great guy
to hang around with.



And he's just a passionate guy.
l like working with passionate people.



- Okay, so l'm gonna do this here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.



l'm gonna come in here, and
then l'm gonna come in here.



- Then l'll jump in and...
- Sure.



l'm a little old to be playing
this kind of game with the kids,



but l love the physicality.



There you go, and action!



- Get down!
- Down! Down!



l do a roll and tuck,
with a gun in my hand



and, it's funny, everybody says,
''Did you see what Jon did?''



And l say, ''Hey, fellows, l'm not gone yet,
l'm still in the game here.''



Take that moment
and make it a moment!



NBE One chamber now!



Jon Voight's fast!



He outran me and he was in,
like, penny loafer shoes.



l don't know how he did that.



l'm doing this documentary
about Jon Voight.



There he is in all his glory.



There's the creature
in his natural habitat.



The man's a legend.



Do a little wave, Jon?
A little wave?



- Little wave.
- Little wave for the camera?



Would you be so kind?



Both Johns.



You talk to both of them and...
Geniuses, you know?



The guys know how to do this.



Cut, cut, cut. Thank you.



l've had a good relationship
with the US military for many years,



and l was dead set on
getting the military to cooperate.



We went through basic training
for three days



at Fort lrwin just outside of Barstow.



Good morning, gentlemen!



You have a set call
with the Army.



Sweet.



ls everybody happy?



We took the guys out to
the .50 calibre machine gun range,



and some of the guys, l don't think,
had ever even seen a weapon fire,



and certainly had never fired one.



We were fortunate enough
to let them observe the firing



and we put them through
a safety course.



Your round will get into place,
you let it forward,



and one shot at a time.



Gotcha.



- Put the first link in like that.
- Right.



Close the feature.



Yeah, pull it to the rear,
then let go.



Let it go.
And then do it again.



All right, you're ready to rock
and roll right now.



- Good shot.
- Nice.



All right.



ln Vietnam,
Carlos Hathcock once made a kill



from just under two miles away
with one of these.



He had a scope mounted on top.
He was a Marine Corps sniper.



Just under two miles,
he made a shot.



- Two miles away?
- Two miles away? Dead on.



The bullet will travel a maximum
effective range of about 7,000...



- 200.
- 7,200 yards.



They used to shoot down aeroplanes
with these in World War ll.



Check this out.



This is my first one.
Two, three, four and then five.



- All right.
- l got better.



Of course,
they were fed in the field.



They got to eat the MREs
and they got real food, too,



but they got a little taste of
what the military's all about.



- Heat up.
- Gourmet.



MRE is a meal ready to eat.



- The entree is the main meal.
- l can't tell which one's the main meal.



- Probably the one in the cardboard box.
- Okay.



We're cooking and this is the MREs,
which are surprisingly hot.



What the colonel explained to me is
that it's basically like Drano.



But you don't eat the Drano.



And then if you get the opportunity to
ever do this, it smells like garlic farts.



The chemical reaction
smells like garlic farts.



And at first when l walked over there,
l thought it was Tyrese.



So l'm really glad it's not



'cause we're gonna be working together
for a long time.



lt's all right.



l'll trade you my jalapeno cheese
for your crackers and jelly.



Now, that's a good deal.
l'll take that deal.



Look at this, Chicken Cavatelli.



Tastes like Spago.



- What we call PPE...
- Yeah.



PPE is our
Personal Protective Equipment.



This right here is called lBA,
the lndividual Body Armour.



This is the standard weapon
that we use right here.



lt's called a standard M4.



We're gonna be going over
a formation you use



before you enter a room.



So could we play any Rolling Stones?
Paint it Black?



We don't have any music in here.



We went to
a mock lraqi village.



A unit was getting ready
to deploy to lraq,



and we spent the afternoon with them
seeing what they do to prepare.



They teach you how to stack
and go into a room



and clear the whole room.



Gotta get into some of this.



You know, that's what...say.



You're looking out this way,
you're looking out this way.



And until they start to move,
since you're the last man of the stack,



you turn around. All right. Contact.



You want to meet them, all right?



That way everybody knows
they're all touched up.



Here.



All right, hold on. Stop.



When you're coming in,
just like this, all right?



- You're trying to jump.
- Did l do this?



- Yeah, you did it. You did a little hop.
- l did, didn't l?



All right?
You come in. Clear.



l did a little hop.



Does that feel
more smooth for you, guys?



- Yeah, it does.
- Better.



- All right, l mean, 'cause that...
- Felt sexy.



Bullets travel down the wall
six to eight inches, all right?



lf a bullet hits right here
and it's travelling down the wall,



due to the spiral of the round,



it will travel down
that wall six to eight inches.



So you wanna keep your ass off
the wall six to eight inches, all right?



Mother...l wish you would! Try me!



All right, you scan the windows here,
you scan the door.



Windows, door, windows, door.



Scan. Scan.



Freeze!



Nobody move!



- Status! One up!
- Two up!



Three up!



- Four up!
- All clear!



We worked our ass off,



and sometimes between breaks,
we would go, ''Where's Tyrese?''



He was in the van.
Air- conditioning.



Hurry up!



Everybody is leaving you!



People are dying!



You are killing them!



You really walked away with a respect



for the amount of preparation



that goes into being
a soldier in the military.



Right over here.



Great. Awesome.



Today is gonna be all about
an insertion into this village, okay?



l get involved in the training phase
of the actors



and making sure those guys at least
are comfortable- looking.



Move!



SAW gunner,
you are no good to us back here!



You must be up front!



We wound up recruiting
a bunch of active- duty SEALs.



So, they're current
in their tactical capabilities.



- See how my weapon is up here...
- Yeah.



...in front of my face?
lt's what we call ''the bubble.'' Okay?



l'm gonna have control of my weapon.
l can see my magazine well.



- Okay?
- Yeah.



My weapon up here like this.
l can still track my targets, whatever.



lt also acts as a bit of
a shield, too, you know.



Shut up.



Michael really wants to
bring as much military realism



into the movie as possible.



A big part of that is to use
military people to play military people.



Yeah.



The entire crew got speaking roles.



Michael liked them and wanted
to change the scene on the spot.



We approved it, and
they got speaking roles out of it.



Okay, let's send the AA- 1 0s.
Danger close situation,



and make sure there's friendlies
in the area within one kilometre.



Checking Switch One- One to
Hawk One- One to strike.



The extras that we used from
Holloman Air Base were off- duty,



and they were paid extra's salaries.



The United States Air Force
and Marines and Army. Everybody.



l love you all dearly.
l'm so proud of what you're doing for us.



lt's unbelievable. Okay?
Both here and over there.



So just keep it up



'cause you're well- loved
and you gotta know that.



Typically, an extra would not
have any experience with a weapon.



These guys are very
experienced with weapons.



Mark.



Cut that! Cut that!



l think l'm gonna open you up more.
Just go to your right.



Go to your right,
right over there.



Probably had, like, 200 military



and about 50 stunt people
running and scattering,



firing and being chased by
tumbling vehicles that were on cables.



Ultimately, zero is
our key sweet spot. Zero.



When l give you a ''five, four,''
my guys will start firing and moving.



Right, l got you.



Five, four, three...



Four, three...



That was good.



Good job, guys!



Even though
it wasn't a real explosion,



it certainly created the effect.



And, trust me, as a professional



who knows all about
blowing things up for real,



we appreciate anything like this.



l like shooting stuff real on set.



lt seems to be a dying art.



We put actors in situations
where we know it's so safe,



but it looks very dangerous.



We're good?



Okay.



Weapon is hot! Full loads.



Everybody, here we go now!



Take two. Fire in the hole.



Guys, lock it up,
clear it out!



Ready and let's roll camera.



Rolling!



Ready?
And three, two, one, action!



Action!



lt was good.
l think we can do better.



We try to put the audience
inside the action,



and the closer we get to it and
the more movies we've done together,



the more that we capture
that for the audience.



l told Shia, ''You know,
you better get in shape for this.''



l was at 1 30
when l got the role,



and it wasn't like
l pulled a Christian Bale



and completely transformed,
but l put on 25 pounds of muscle



and then slimmed down
throughout the filming.



So, it's not reassuring that
they put bulletproof safety on the camera



when you're gonna
be right in front of it.



And right there also,
you see?



Stop right there!



They make sure
they protect the cameras,



but actors, expendable.



We had this scene
where he's facing off against Megatron.



ls it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?



And the producer, lan Bryce,
he knows how l like physical stuff,



and he says, ''So we're gonna
do that blue screen, right?''



l said, ''No,
we're doing that real.''



He said, ''Really? Really?'' l said, ''Yeah,
we're gonna put him out there.''



They can build Optimus Prime,
they can blow up the Pentagon,



but they can't find a way to
keep Shia off the ledge.



Right, Michael Bay?



All right, ready?



Yeah, well, since we locate.



l gotta tell you,
it's scary going out there,



'cause you literally have no safety net



and you just have these silly wires
hanging on your hip.



And, mind you, l would never
do this myself ever, okay?



You're locked in,
you can't fall. See that?



You're bolted to a steel l- beam
and another pole.



What l could is l could fall
and scrape off the side,



then you'd have to pull me up.
That could happen.



l'm not gonna die, obviously,
but l could get scraped.



You know, this is Fear Factor.
That's all it is. lt's Fear Factor.



lt's Fear Factor.



People don't die on Fear Factor.



lt's another episode of Fear Factor.



They do more hairier stuff
on Fear Factor than this.



- You're right, you're right,
you're right.
- All right, let's do it.



Oh, mother...



Got it?



Jenny, bring him around this way, too.



Come way out towards the other way,
towards us, towards us.



Get the crane. The crane.
Ready? Roll camera.



Ready? And action shot.
Wide movements.



You're not gonna get it!



You're never gonna get this AllSpark,
you know that!



l'm never gonna
give you the AllSpark!



l feel like a fruitcake saying that,
Mike. lt's a...line.



Now you can see the robot in the sight.
Get the robot in the background.



Oh, no, no, no, no.



Okay.



- Mike?
- Yeah?



Are these just close- ups?



No, they're wide.
We see your face.



We see your face
and we're showing that it's you.



And we're showing
that it's not a platform.



lf it was just close- ups,
we could do that anywhere.



That's lame.



Oh, no, no, no, no.



Okay.



- l'm done, Mike. My voice is going.
- Okay, that's good.



- Shia's good. He's a good kid.
- He's great, got a lot of heart.



Are you gonna back up?



90% of the actors in this business



could not do what we did on this film.
They just wouldn't do it, you know?



There's action stars who don't get up
on the roof and do what we do.



Oh, no, no, no, no.



Now!



Transformers!



l fight giant robots.



- Way high, way too high.
- Okay, a little high.



...deep breath of this toxic smoke.
l'll be right there.



The location department on this movie
has really excelled.



l'm gonna say, ''And fire.'' Okay, guys?
You can hear me, right?



And it required pretty extraordinary sized
things, whether it's White Sands...



Fire!



Orange smoke, orange smoke,
orange smoke!



...or the Hoover Dam...



We're gonna shoot something quick,
then we're gonna go to lunch,



and then
we are going to go downstairs.



...or downtown L.A.



We finally saw what a 32- foot robot
looked against a two- storey house.



Suddenly, you realise you've gotta
find places that are enormous



to make these things
feel part of the environment.



Look, l escaped!



We can't leave the trucks on the road.
That's what l'm led to believe.



- What?
- On the side of the road.



- Make room.
- Because...



Behind the dunes,
so we can't see him,



there's gonna be a mini base camp
down there.



Yeah, we're working on that
right now



just to find out how we can
make it firm enough.



lt's a work in progress.



Every day is a rollercoaster
for me.



l don't know if it's the same
for every department,



but, you know, l find myself
on the verge of tears one minute



and then hysterical laughter the next.



llt, a new guy l worked with. l thought l was
gonna give the guy a heart attack.



- l have a question.
- Yeah?



He says,
''l can't get the observatory.



''lt hasn't been shot in five years.''
And l said, ''lt's a big movie.



''You can do it. Go to the Mayor's office.
You can do it.''



This is the path. See right in there?
This is where he's running,



and the Black Hawk's gonna come right up
on that edge there.



Leaving...Can we leave the helicopter
running there?



- Like at Playa?
- Yeah, it should be okay.



''l can't get the bridge with
four helicopters underneath.''



l said, ''You could do it.
Go to the Mayor's office.



''lt's a big movie. We're keeping
this film down in California.''



We structured the budget in order to
keep it in the United States,



which is not to say that the movie
couldn't be made elsewhere.



lt's just, l think, easier
and more comfortable



for Michael to have, you know,
a crew around that he's used to.



- Hey, Dave!
- Yeah.



l think we'll let them fire this way
so you can whip...You guys, hand- held,



you're gonna be kind of like
in here,



lift it like...You know
what l'm saying?



l actually cut my fee so that l can
shoot here with my crew



that knows how to shoot fast
and is good on the fly.



As soon as the plane
hits the ground



and it stops, we should
pull the vehicles forward.



Michael likes to go hard and fast.
He has the shock and awe approach



to scouting,
which is supposed to be...



Oh, no, that's not Michael,
that's a Stealth Bomber.



- Morning, Michael.
- Hi, Jack.



So, Holloman Air Force Base is
an extremely secure base



with a great deal of secret
goings on.



Yeah, yeah, l mean, this morning,
you know, we had a guy with an M1 6



protecting the AWACS
because even though they know



that they're here for us,
they're still very protective of their aircraft.



Slow- mo three to one, okay?



lf the American military is called on,
they will fight



enemies abroad or even alien robots,
if need be.



You don't want scrub brush by it,
you know,



tumbleweed, whatever, okay?



l can show you how to
get some better shots.



What's that little...



Driving into the centre of White Sands,
which is 300 miles...



lt's not literally sand, it's a crystal.
To see that for miles and miles...



There's no other place like that
on Earth.



White Sands missile range was created
for the atomic missile tests in the '40s,



and we had to make sure
that there was no chance



of somebody literally
stepping on a landmine.



So we had to engage the services
of a unexploded ordnance company



to mine- sweep to a depth of four feet



so that we could
build our Bedouin village



and then, ironically, blow it up.



When we got here
and laid out the buildings,



we realised that
the dunes were moving.



So the valley was actually
significantly smaller, up to 30 feet,



because of the wind.



Very hot. We had days,
1 1 5, 1 1 8 degrees.



That's the max so far.
lt could get hotter.



That's compounded by the fact that



the sand there is really just white quartz
that's washed off



of the surrounding mountains
and it just reflected like glass.



God! Hot!



l'm from Puerto Rico,
so when l was told,



''Careful, New Mexico is pretty hot''...



Oh, yeah!



...l go, ''l'm from Puerto Rico.
How hot can it get?''



lt's hot. Almost had heat stroke yesterday.
That's kind of wild.



lt was hard,
'cause they had a lot of gear.



Go! Go! Go! Go!



And running and yelling and shooting.



'Cause on my sets it's like...



Especially if you're doing military stuff,
it's tough.



l'm not, like, a very cushy
director in terms of



if we're here, we're here,
'cause l shoot really fast.



Men did huge work here,



bigger than anything l ever seen Hollywood
ever do or ever will.



Look at these cranes up here.



We're heading from the top of
Hoover Dam down into the turbine area



where it's very, very cool.



When you see it
you have no idea how big it is.



Hoover Dam is just massive.



We had to do some sort
of remedial work



because a film that shot there last year
didn't endear themselves



to the Hoover Dam by buzzing the dam.



lt's a grave situation, gentlemen.
Thank you for being with us.



Cut. Good. Do it again.



- That's okay, leave it.
- Ready?



Shoot it like that, huh, Mitch?



Off camera!



They really weren't into it at all,
especially, you know,



given Michael's penchant
for blowing things up.



So we, you know, worked out
with the Hoover Dam.



We'd get certain hours
early in the morning



where we could be up
on the top of the dam.



- Got to use the cam roller.
- Okay.



Okay, here we go.



Okay, we're going down to time it.
Take those ramps down with us.



- Push. Push.
- Come on, you and me right here.



And then as soon as the crowds came,
around 1 0:00,



we had to then go
inside or down below.



So we just scheduled our way around it,
and it actually worked out fine.



- Both of you guys go on this side.
- Give me 20.



- Where's John?
- You're not puking, are you?



The scale of the Hoover Dam was
a tall order.



There's not many places
you could do that



because everything there is so gigantic.



l think we became very familiar
with the architecture,



which allowed us to
build a set that tied in to it.



And action!



What is this?



When l looked at this Megatron hangar,
this illustration,



l'm like,
''That's the vibe of the movie right there.''



And it's amazing if one or two illustrations
can just set the vibe.



We used the Playa hangars where
Howard Hughes built the Spruce Goose,



and it's this great wood structure.
lt's kind of narrow,



but it's very tall ceilings.



You're able to build a lot of different sets
so you can go back and forth,



you know, in this kind of huge space,
but it's kind of separated,



and it's a great place to film.



Basically, we were sort of using
the structure as it was



and then embellishing
and sort of making it look



like a vintage facility again
in a subterranean setting



under Hoover Dam where Megatron
was frozen in ice.



Even though Megatron had bee
encapsulated in this space



for many, many years,
he's still being maintained,



so it was a little bit of, like,



new technology
mixed with old technology,



very much like Hoover Dam is.



When you go in, there are things
that have never changed in there.



The first time l walked onto the
Megatron set, l said, ''Wow.''



- Megatron.
- l had my son with me that day.



When he saw Megatron up there,
his jaw just dropped.



l was so impressed with it



that on my weekends
l would sneak onto the set



with my friends just to see it.



You know, he was 30, 35 feet
and he was only half built.



Like, l'd bring three or four friends,
and be like,



''You're never gonna believe
what they just built.''



l never do that. l mean,
l never do that.



This baby is the first we found!



And good, cut!



You want just to lay
that so you can watch?



- No, no, no, no. Right.
- Okay.



So l just do it
but just louder and more off the cuff.



''This baby is the first we found.''
Boom and get out of here.



Okay, ready.
Here we go, guys.



Ready and five, four, three, two...



The day that l saw that set,
l suddenly went,



''Oh, Lord,
this film is gonna be everywhere.''



That was the first day
that it dawned on me



that l was shooting
a really big American film.



l had to shoot in Los Angeles.



Now, Los Angeles,
they'd give us four blocks one Saturday,



they'd give us three blocks
this Sunday,



they'd give us those other four
next weekend from there.



And then we shot
at Universal backlot,



and then l shot in Detroit,



and l had to all make it feel
like it's one place.



So you had to keep the scene
in your head.



l mean, you just had to
wrap your head around it.



Downtown L.A. is a venue
for this kind of action stuff.



We'll go on five, four, three,
two, one. Blow up.



Go hot, please.



Go hot. Here we go!



He's right up by this building right here.



Ready, and he's right on top of you.
Go in three, two, one, action!



Here we go. Here we go.



Piece of crap.



Ready and roll cameras.



- Rolling.
- Hey, Rick, fire in the hole.



Let's go, guys.



Don't move too soon. Ready?
And three, two, one and action.



Not yet.



Up, up, up.



Hey, can you take
that light right out there



and light that thing up there?



The toughest bit was flying
the helicopters under the bridges,



for lots of reasons, not least of
which is the Homeland Security thing.



lf you fly helicopters under 500 feet,



then the FAA makes you jump
through a lot of hoops



because of the, you know,
the potential for crashing into neighbours.



What are you doing?



We are...We're getting pissed on
for the next three days.



You know, the helicopters flying low
kick up all the water from the L.A. River.



Nobody knows exactly
where that water is coming from.



You see all this water
right here on the floor?



lt's all man piss, okay?



And what happens is a science thing.



When you put helicopters
over a puddle of man piss,



man piss gets
all over your man body.



Please, stop!



So we all had goggles
and face masks on



so you don't breathe it or taste it.



Just piss all on my face,
on all my features,



piss on my arms, piss all over
my own piss. lt's just nasty.



- Right, Beaver?
- Oh, yeah.



lt's been a location- heavy movie.
lt's been a great challenge,



and it's funny how, you know,
the rose- tinted glasses effect applies.



l remember, l've been on
other shows where l finished,



l thought, ''God!
Thank God that's over.''



But as time goes by, you sort of



somehow mentally edit out the bad bits
and you remember the times



when there were bombers flying over
your head or just being out



in the sand dunes late in the afternoon
in the beautiful, sort of, evening light.



Well, the appeal of this movie,



you know, goes back to
my children's childhoods.



Because they would ask for
these things on their birthdays



and l would get them Transformer toys
and then we would play on the floor.



And l remember my own experience
with Transformer toys,



how much fun it was for me. And
so this was a shared experience.



Transformers really gets its start in
Japan with Takara.



And it was a series of robot toys
that transformed



and that's all they really were.



A couple of Hasbro executives
went to Japan and saw this great idea



and thought that
there was something there.



And decided that this would be
a really cool concept if we could



wrap a story around it.



ln Japan there was no good guy, bad guy.
They didn't have home planet,



they didn't have personalities or stories.
So that came from those meetings



in Hasbro. And the characters
that are weapons, or gear,



let's make them the bad guys.
All the rolling characters,



let's make them the good guys.



The name Autobots, Decepticons,
came out of that.



After that, we started with
the animation company.



Transformers came out in '84.



And we weren't quite into girls yet,
l don't think.



So it was get home from school,
Transformers, glass of milk, brownie,



whatever, you know, your snack...
l don't know what your snack was.



Not a glass of milk and a brownie.



But we saw it right
when it came out.



Many millions of years ago,
on the planet Cybertron, life existed.



But not life as we know it today.
lntelligent robots that could think



and feel inhabited the cities.



They were called Autobots
and Decepticons.



At the time,
there had been new legislation



that kind of opened up
toy- related animation.



Decepticon rule, forever!



So it was one of the first shows that
what you saw as a toy was in the show.



Transformers has a passionate fan base.



- Who is the biggest Transformer fan?
- Me.



- Transformers...
- More than meets...



...the eye



A lot of people remember
Transformers from the '80s



which was when it was in its heyday,
but it's actually been around ever since.



And since 1 984,



Transformers has generated
over $3 billion in retail sales



and that's, you know, one of
the top franchises in history.



l have more than 1 ,000 Transformer
at my house, fan since l was a kid.



l think it's just the mythos,
l think that's what really got me into it



after l was a kid
watching the cartoon.



Strong characters and just
a very cool toy line to support it.



l'm a pretty big fan. l got my first toy
when l was two years old.



The first Transformer toy, l still have it.



About 75% of all adult men had had



a major Transformers experience
in their lives.



And that's true almost the world over.



So we've got this great group of people



who all grew up with the brand and
are now working



on the creation of Transformers, the movie.



lf it meant something to you as a kid



and you had an emotional
response to it,



that's valuable and that needs to be
heard, period.



So we kind of come at it
from that place.



l was a fan,



l mean, from...My childhood was Yogi Bear
and the Transformers movie.



lt's over, Prime.



Was l die- hard, like ''G1 all the way,''
and...like these people



on Ain't lt Cool News? No.
Do l have a Transformers tattoo



on my body, somewhere? Probably not.
Was l a fan? Extremely.



l did a lot of research, a lot of studying on it
in the past year and a half.



So that would make me definitely
a Transformer head geek somehow.



From the very beginning,
we knew we had fans following this.



From the first time that
a piece of art got out to the fact



that Michael Bay's computer was hacked
and the script got up online.



So, l must say, so in fear of
one of you guys stealing



my computer to find out
the real robot names.



l decided that it'd be better to tell you,
this week or next week,



the true names. Okay?



Because l like my computer.
lt's got a lot of other secret...on it as well.



You could keep nothing secret
on this movie.



And the designs started getting out
on the lnternet. And people were saying,



''Oh, Michael Bay, you wrecked my childhood.
Damn you, Michael Bay.''



Like most Transformers fans,



when l first saw the designs
in the movie,



l was, like, ''What?
They changed everything!



''lt's completely different.
What's going on here?''



l think a lot of the fans
hated me for it at first.



After l read some of the posts that said
they wanted to protest out of my office.



They actually picked the wrong office
because l had moved.



They didn't know my real address, so...
And then the few little talk- backs



where they said they want to hunt me
down and kill me.



l had, you know, l had a couple of those.
But generally, you know, l would take



some of the constructive
criticism of stuff they saw.



l actually changed Megatron's face
when they opposed to it that much.



lt was very important to
get our teaser out there.



That was, like, more of a badass teaser
to show that it's real, not a cartoon.



That teaser on Yahoo was
the most downloaded teaser ever.



That's crazy. So all of a sudden
they see the head piece.



They're all like ''Oh, wow...okay.
That's starting to look really cool.''



You have to totally respect
what's been created and you can't deviate.



And l knew, if l were to put these
characters in the real world,



they'd have to fit in the real world



and they'd have to be
much more intricate.



We had kind of come to terms
with the fact



that we respectfully acknowledged
what had come before.



But, you know, there was a lot of logic
that l had a problem with.



On Cybertron, l mean,
they all walked around



like, with truck parts,
you know, transform.



And that just doesn't fly
when you're trying to



at least make it credible for someone
who's never seen Transformers.



So, on Cybertron, they have to have, well,
l created all of them



having this endoskeleton, this underskin.



Their technology, that is
beyond our understanding,



based on kind of a
nano- molecular process, you know.



Each molecule, each cell,
is a machine unto itself.



So when they come to Earth,
they come in these weird pods.



lt's the endoskeleton wrapped up.
They land, they unfurl.



And the notion is that
when they arrive here,



in order to truly just to exist
on this planet in disguise,



that they have the capacity to
basically find a vehicle



and replicate that vehicle
based on their mass.



Alex and l decided we were going to try to
avoid mass shifting, as we call it



in the fandom. When Optimus Prime
transforms from a truck into a robot,



you want it to feel like
the same- sized truck



is pulling into that same- sized robot.
And that there's no cheating going on.



Hasbro helped us select
some of the robots.



And clearly we wanted that
core cast of characters



that people had known and loved.
And that's why we kept talking



about it as a G1 - inspired story.



G1 is a fan term for generation one.
So when people think back fondly



on the '80s nostalgia,
gen one is what comes to mind.



The characters that we knew had to be
in the movie without a doubt were,



on the Autobot side,
Optimus, Bumblebee...



- Jazz.
- Jazz and lronhide.



And on the Decepticon side
it had to be Megatron, Starscream.



And we knew we had to have someone
kind of related to Soundwave.



Frenzy's in there as kind of
a representative of that.



l actually wanted more robots
than we had,



but it just ultimately got too expensive.



Actually, a few characters that
we had contemplated



that we'd design product for.



We had a character here, Arcee,



who is one of the only female robots
in the Transformers lore.



And she actually almost made it
into the movie but for some reason,



they couldn't quite get the plotline correct.



So maybe we'll see her
in future movies to come.



Hasbro wanted to see
what we came up with.



You know, they kind of left us completely
alone for a long time.



They were really kind of, you know,
let me do my thing.



You know, and where l veered off,



like with Optimus
we had to make the ears



just a little bit bigger to get a little
more of the samurai look.



lf you think about
where Transformers came from,



the robot culture of Japan
is in part based on



the tradition of samurai armour.



We had some serious,
l guess, Transformer...



Just total head geeks that have been,
you know,



know the lore backwards and forwards
that we would vet this stuff through.



Early on, the art department was
working on for Optimus,



you can see that
he was a lot more blue.



And even the vehicle parts
were kind of disappearing,



particularly the tyres were uncoiling.



And those were just things that were
gonna become issues



for us to make product of.



One of the things that
Transformers is not, is morphing.



They are transforming.
So pieces have to go somewhere.



On the product side, with real plastic,
my team has physics to contend with.



That did present kind of
a design challenge



that we threw back to
the production team.



And they realised that and l think we got to
a happy place for everybody.



Autobots, transform. Roll out.



Peter Cullen did the original voice
and still has a great voice.



And then this one,
give it a little bit more of a...You know.



- ''Take it easy, lronhide.''
- Okay.



When Peter Cullen was announced
as the voice of Optimus



l thought it was fantastic.
l thought it was awesome.



And l thought it was the most
unexpected nod to the fans.



And l think it showed a respect for how
much that voice defined the character.



They deserve to choose for themselves.



Then you will die with them!



When l was looking
at faces, l said,



l want Megatron to have an attitude
like a Hugo Weaving.



You still fight for the weak.



Frank Welker, l kept putting his voice,
cartoon voice to our gigantic Megatron



and it just didn't fit.



You fool, Starscream.
You fool, Starscream.



You fail me yet again, Starscream.



- Okay.
- Thanks a lot, you did a great job.



- Thank you, Michael.
- l appreciate you doing this.



That was a pleasure. Enjoy yourself.



- Thanks.
- Thank you.



The life- scale Bumblebee
was only meant to be



just kind of a see it for pieces,
you know.



lt really can't hold up to the detail
of going up close.



What they'll do is they make that robot
in the computer.



Then they give us that computer file
and we'll make that part.



This piece is called the Bumblebee.
lt supposedly transforms



from a 2008 Camaro into this robot here.



How it's gonna do that,
l have no idea.



There's 1 50 single parts on that robot.



The whole robot was
sculptured out of foam.



We took moulds off of them,
made fibreglass parts.



And when it stands up,
it's actually about 1 8 feet tall.



That's too far, huh?



- Too far?
- So we'll cut.



Put this away and get it done.



A clincher will probably hold that.



This thing cost $75,000 to paint.



He required a special four- layer paint
'cause it matches the car.



Me and Bumblebee are starting to
get to be real close.



When we got near the robot
it was just like, ''No way!''



And you start walking,
you're getting closer and closer



and you start seeing the body



and the torso and the head
and it's just nuts. lt was nuts. Silence.



The robot can't move on camera,
but we can position it in any position



that Michael needs them and
so it's a really good guide for them.



l'll bring you your
Bumblebee airbags for movie.



- A camera, marker.
- Scene one.



- And action.
- Action!



No, no, no. Stop, stop!



My favourite Transformer is Bumblebee.



Always been Bumblebee.



My favourite Transformer now,
l think, is Starscream.



Megatron is dead.



The humans have taken it.



l think lronhide
is probably my favourite.



Stand back.



You feeling lucky?



l like Optimus Prime.



What do we got here?
What is it?



We got a truck.



What character?



This is Optimus Prime here, baby.



Good- looking truck.



As a kid growing up, l was into fixing
my own cars and taking them apart.



So from cars and just being
an automotive head,



Transformers, it just struck me
as something fun to work on.



Watch out, get out of the way,
l'm rolling cameras.



Ready and ammo guy, go.
Ready and seven, Tammy.



Michael Bay does know his cars.



He's pretty particular about
the cars he wants.



He knows a lot more
about cars than l do.



Not too fast.



We started last September, October,
having meetings with Michael,



trying to figure out what the Autobots
would be, what vehicles we would use.



And we downloaded every picture
of every car that was available.



We started addressing
the major car companies.



When you're making
a movie for 1 45 million,



which sounds like a lot of money,
it was tough to fit this movie in that box.



And you couldn't afford to do
this movie without a sponsorship,



and nobody can come up
with what GM has.



For us, it is about the sexiness
of their cars.



l went to GM and l got into
their Skunkworks there.



lt's a place,
l can't tell you where it is



but that's where they make
their stealthy concept cars.



But l saw this car, and they didn't know
what kind of car it was going to be.



But now it's a Camaro.
And what l liked about it,



it kind of had a retro look,
it was a muscle car



and just, right then and there
l knew it was Bumblebee.



Bumblebee was, in the '80s,
a Volkswagen Bug.



And his role has always been
the younger of the Autobots.



We knew that he was originally
a Volkswagen and a Beetle.



But it was not really
an option for Michael



because it wasn't badass enough.



l just was never going to use
the Volkswagen Bug for Bumblebee.



lt just wasn't going to be in my cars.
lt reminded me of Herbie The Love Bug.



But we do make
nod to it in the movie



because if you notice, in the parking lot,
the Camaro's parked next to a Bug.



This is a classic engine
right here.



l sold a car the other day...



Oh, my God.



Bumblebee, we said,
''As long as he's yellow



''let's find some cues that will hearken
back to what people remember,



''but let's not have that
be as far as you can go.''



l think the old Camaro
was really cool



and, you know,
it's a nice beater car.



The quintessential Camaro is the '69.



There's been a million of them
hot- rodded.



So l wanted to find the cheesiest version of
the Camaro that'd be perfect



for this kid's first car.
He didn't have any money.



He would never go out
and be able to afford a '69.



This is a Camaro, a 1 977 Camaro.
Nobody wanted them,



nobody needs them,
they're hard to find.



This one was pulled out
of Palmdale,



the other two were pulled out
of Oklahoma.



We're gonna redo them, repaint them,
new engines, everything redone,



so that Kenny Bates can drive the heck out
of them through his stunts.



So this was the perfect dichotomy for
the new Camaro when he re- scans.



Why does he transform back into
this piece- of- crap Camaro?



That Camaro is really spectacular.



l wish they would bring it out
earlier than they are.



There were only two Camaros
that were hand- built by GM.



To fix that car is a big deal.
lf you smash a fender,



you just don't get another Bumblebee fender
'cause there aren't any.



All the parts were individually made.



lt's a three- stage paint.



lf you get a ding in the door
you have to paint the whole door.



Pretty trick door latch.



No indent, no recessed area.
Everything's slick.



l mean, it's a $500,000 car.



So it's not like,
''Hey, have...Go around the...'' You know.



Didn't happen like that.



lt's, ''Wipe your feet off
before you get into the car.''



''Keep your hands
on the steering wheel.''



You push down at a certain rate.



You want me to go faster?



l'm just nervous about the car.
l can go faster if you want.



You are not a stunt driver, okay?



This is where we were parked,
originally.



- You can say everything you want.
- Michael, oh, my goodness gracious!



- Let's go, come on.
- All right, right here, in the centre.



lf l crash into the wall, it's not my fault,
because l'm an actor.



lt should be like this,
the transformation, one, two, three. Okay?



Hey, guys, transforming on three.
l'm gonna go, ''One, two, three.'' Okay?



- Ready?
- Yeah, Michael.



Ready.



Three, two, one, go!



Jazz is a character
that was always a sports car.



Now he's not a Porsche 91 1 any more,
he's a Pontiac Solstice,



but he's still a cool sport car.



We had a little company
do some aftermarket.



We made a hard top for it.
We put the little ground effects, fairings.



We put a little spoiler on the back
and some louvers on the hood.



And we kind of just jazzed it up
a little bit.



Ratchet, in the '80s,
was an ambulance.



But it was more of
a van- shaped ambulance.



lt was more of a Japanese version
of what an ambulance is.



Ratchet was the H2- based ambulance
which doesn't exist.



So we designed and
built it from scratch.



We started with a stock GM H2 Hummer
which we gutted



and took all of the existing components
from the rear apart.



And then we're building the cages
that will be sheeted



to look as the search- and- rescue
vehicle should.



Also applying all of the roll bars,
roll cages,



the heavy- duty bumpers to give it
that beefy look,



wheel and tyre packages,
and the accessories



that will fall in line with
a search- and- rescue vehicle.



lronhide was this big 4500 Series GMC.



They're brand new, they just came out,
and they gave us three of them.



We got them from the factory, black.
l made that tailgate



that had that Autobot logo embossed
into it, added the stacks,



and all the running board, and
modified the bumpers and stuff.



That truck, unless you're standing
next to it, you have no idea.



lt's so big, it's crazy. lt's like
the biggest thing you ever saw.



There's Optimus.



l saw a picture of a truck and
it was lowered and it was blue



and it had flames on it. And l'm like,
''That's Optimus Prime.''



With Optimus, literally, we got
every car book, every car picture,



l mean,
it was just all over the walls.



We looked at the cartoon,
thank you very much.



And then we just started pulling
references of different big rigs.



Because this is what we were always...
Everybody in this department



was conceptualising
how Optimus is masked,



what he came out of.
This is the main dude.



- We should go look at it.
- Okay.



lnstead of buying a new truck
that's a $1 50,000 truck,



we bought some older trucks,
and they were pretty beat up



and they were pretty ugly- looking.



l mean, this is like a redo.



- You know what l mean, lan?
- Yeah.



How are they ever going to
make this thing look like that?



l said, ''Just trust me. This is the truck
that should be Optimus Prime.



''Not a new truck. This is the one.''



So we're gonna completely
strip it, paint it, flame job.



New fenders, new sleeper,
new bumpers, lights...



And when it comes out,
it will be beautiful.



There's been some debate about
some of the changes that were made.



The flames on the side of the car
and the fact that it's a long- nosed



- instead of a flat- nosed truck.
- l like the flames.



And what the flames did
when he was transformed,



it kind of looked like ribs
and to me it looked cool.



One of the things l've learnt is red
doesn't photograph well



for the feature films, the light being
what it is, and it's a nightmare.



Michael Bay was nice enough to
explain that to me.



So we made this compromise
where we wanted a red chest,



and we did that by the flames, so that
we could still retain the essence



of Optimus being a red truck
while still making it easy to shoot.



Just a much more aggressive- looking truck,
it's more Duel,



more of an homage to Steven,
looks better on a wide angle



when it extends back. lt's just more
of a badass- looking thing



than a flat- fronted trash truck.



And again, it goes back to that thing of
when you actually see it,



and you see what's required of
the transformations



and the level of detail,
we weren't going to be able to have



as exciting a transformation with
the flat nose.



Okay guys, let's stop admiring
the truck. Let's shoot, shall we?



Let's set up for this,
please, back to one, Jerry.



This movie, l had more cooperation from GM
than any movie l've ever made.



They promised us they'd give us
the flood- damaged cars,



the non- saleable cars,
the cars that Michael Bay



needs to wreck every day
on a daily basis for his food chain.



...four, three, two, one.



We burnt, crashed,



flipped...



Three, two, one, fire!



...probably close to 200 cars.



We had 30 or 40 cars sent to
the shop



and stripped the engines
and transmissions out



and put the pick points on them and
the plates on them for us to flip and throw.



And we'd do that all on the day
wherever X marks the spot.



We have this catapult
and we'd just run a cable off,



hook it up to the car and then with
the use of high- pressure nitrogen



we can fire...
lt's the same way,



a plane is launched from
an aircraft carrier.



We do the exact same thing,
only on a smaller scale.



And it's all portable.
We'll take that anywhere on the set



Michael wants to go
and we'll launch cars.



lt's screaming everywhere,
it's screaming. Ready,



and roll cameras.



Ready and three,



two, one, action!



Screaming!



Don't go in the building!



Thank you very much.



No one does car chases
better than Michael.



l mean, they're incredible.
They're at Mach three



and you feel like you're right
in the middle of them.



One of my shooting styles is
using this little go- cart thing.



Where it goes very fast,
like 1 00 miles an hour



and it's a very small vibrating camera
that's real low to the ground.



Looks like a suicide vehicle.



And we use that for anything from running
down the street to chasing cars.



lt's a very powerful tool for getting in
and around and close to the action.



We use it quite a bit.



- l'm scared.
- Fun, huh?



- All right, let's not clip it, now.
- Thank you.



Play that back again.



lt's pretty crazy being in the go- cart
because you're responding quick.



And any mistake and you could
be in a lot of trouble.



Five, four,



three, two, one.



l'll tell you, l'm never gonna be doing
another highway chase again,



because l've now done highway chases
till the cows come home.



l want it to transform right
under the on ramp. All right?



So the next on ramp is where
we're gonna start the transformation.



- Okay.
- The highway chase is huge.



l mean, we have tumbling cars,
we have crashing cars,



we've got cars upside down
hitting cars, we've got scraping cars.



But this one will top most of
the ones l've ever done.



Because now, you've got robots
transforming at 80 miles an hour



on a freeway, and l don't know
how you can top anything like that.



- All right, let's go and try one, shall we?
- Yeah.



We tried to put the audience
inside the action.



So they're actually eating cars,
they're actually in the crash.



Come on, let's go.
Bay Buster follow me. Watch out.



We used the Bay Buster,
that crazy triangle car



that can actually
take direct hits from cars.



The Bay Buster is a pickup truck
with the cage on the outside of it.



They mount anywhere
from 2 to 4 cameras on the front.



And if we have flipping cars or cars
being thrown off the top of car carriers,



we normally drive the Bay Buster
right into them.



That's great for the audience.
That's part of that ''eat the action''



that the audience gets to see,
that's not CGl.



lt's like most directors would have
chose when we ripped that bus,



which is an extremely dangerous stunt,
l mean really dangerous.



Most would have just done it



either miniature or CG.
And it just wouldn't look as good.



The bus sequence is something
that we've never done before.



And l really had to push to
get that to happen.



That bus, we have six exploding bolts
holding the cab together in the centre,



at the centre of the bus, and
then we have big cables underneath



pulling it together, holding it together.
We cut the cables, we blow the bolts,



and the actual bus cracks in half
like an egg in two pieces.



There's a stunt driver
who drives the front away.



Because it's going to drop down
on another set of wheels



so he can still control it.
And then the back half



has those same cannons in it
that we're gonna fire at 1 ,1 00 PSl,



three cannons and the back half of
the bus is gonna flip away.



- Wow.
- lt's gonna be really cool.



We're gonna pop the cable,
which is the first cable pulling it.



Then there's another cable
wrapped around him,



and it's gonna take about three seconds
for that bus to pull like that.



And then we blow the thing.



Once we pop the cable
it's all automatic.



Richard, you have
the bomb in your hand?



l have the button on the floor, yes.



- Okay, so Richard...
- Who else will be there?



Releasing the first cable when the bus
comes out from under the bridge



and gets into the sun.



Come on, Dan, let's start
your vehicle and have it started,



'cause we're moving into position,
right now.



Move those cars forward,
gang, please.



So we put Richard Epper in the bus
and l drove the Bay Bomber



and chased it with four cameras
on the front end.



But no one really knew
what the bus was gonna do.



Hey, Kenny, how'd it go, man?



l think it went pretty good.
Cut in half, right, Nick?



- Yeah, l know.
- You've got half the bus here



and half of it is over there.



l think it worked out really well.



And l think it's because Effects did
an excellent job



on prepping that bus for us.
So it's like, those guys are the guys



that made us look good
on that one.



The main thing is, my good friend
Richard Epper is safe



and that's all l think about
going down there.



ln the end, it's just a movie.



But it's a Michael Bay movie
and that's what we do.



You get the bang for the buck
when you're with Michael.



Actually, no one was hurt on this movie.
We've had a really spotless track record



for such a long time.



And knock on wood, because,
by the way,



it's just a dangerous business.



What we do,
what they're doing is dangerous.



Which one of those do you
think was a Decepticon?



Maybe one, maybe none.



Decepticons are actually very fun
'cause they're just wicked.



lt seemed to serve the story
better to have military vehicles



being the real theme of
the Decepticons as opposed to



too many tape decks,
or a gun, or things that were



clever and great in the cartoon



but a little bit unfocused
for our purposes.



Michael has a pretty
good relationship with the DOD,



and so it was kind of interesting
that we were using...



All the military in this movie
in the robot form are bad guys.



l'll be honest. l had to sort of pitch
this to my chain of command



in that there's
Air Force aircraft as bad guys.



All right, ready?
And the first two, go!



Go, go, go!



Because of Michael's relationships
in the past and, you know,



Armageddon and other films he's done,



the thought was that ideally we'd get
the help of the Armed Forces in the end.



You see, the Air Force cameraman,
l keep trying to tell him...



Turn, turn, let me show it to you.
We're trying to change the style.



See, he's a little rigid.
Everything is like this.



He looks like that, walks
like that. lt's rigid.



Look, now we got a little
MTV style going.



See, by lunch he's got
a little MTV style going.



And he loves the military.
He knows how to portray the military



to make us look good and
so it seemed like a win- win.



And people love bad guys.
The fact is, l mean,



what's cooler than Darth Vader?



l've always been, like, some of
the first to shoot military hardware.



And in Armageddon, l was
the first to shoot the B- 2 bomber.



Then this movie was the F- 22s,



which are the new $1 30 million,
amazing stealth fighters.



Starscream was an F- 1 5 Air Force jet
back in the early cartoon days.



And back then,
the F- 1 5 in the '80s



was the quickest and the fastest
and the baddest thing around.



Well, fast- forward 25 years,
the F- 22 is now that aircraft.



- Rolling. Ready?
- And roll cameras. Roll cameras.



Ready and action.



There you go. Look at that.
Let's do that again.



Reset. Very good work,
everybody. Reset.



Let's do that one more time.



What the Air Force
has done in this



show is shown us
all of the good toys.



Brandy new stuff that really hasn't
even been put into the field yet.



ls there any hand signals that
the crew guys in the front give?



Anything you give at all?
Any hand signals?



Yeah.



All right. l want to do
some hand signals.



We're gonna come right by you.
Guys, go back to the crew.



What kind of signals
do you guys give?



That aircraft is just...
lt's just phenomenal what it can do.



There's war games they play
where they'll send,



you know, three or four of
those things out against 20 or so



current F- 1 5, F- 1 6s, and
it's not even a contest.



Target lD.



And they can fire at enemies that
are beyond the curvature of the Earth.



They can track and fire on things
that are 270 miles away.



So they can...Those guys are dead
before they're even within



visual contact of that plane.



So it's just very fitting that Starscream,
who is the Air Commander



and second- in- command,
takes that form of, literally,



the baddest weapon system
in the world right now.



We have Blackout,
which is a MH- 53 helicopter.



lt's a gigantic troop transport.
lt's a mean- looking helicopter.



Just looks bad ass, you know.
The Cobras are kind of slight.



You know, yeah,
they carry a lot of firepower,



but as far as just looking
big and menacing,



the Sea Stallion was,
like, the logical choice.



Yeah, l got my fire suit on,
baby. l'm directing.



Ready! And...



- Seven, six, five, four...
- Seven, six, five, four...



l can't think of anything remotely
this huge that the Air Force



has been involved with,
not only in, you know, screen time,



but just the amount of
aircraft and people



and shooting on bases and
everything that we've done.



What we're gonna wanna do is,
we wanna stack you guys up,



so, with a long lens,
it'll make you look very close.



You know what l'm saying?
We'll put you kind of like this



to each other. A little over
there and add a little bit.



We're stacked up with the sun.



All right?



- Coming over the tower.
- ...three, zero, zero.



The tower is actually
a good place to come.



Air Boss, Osprey 1 , sir.



Do you want aeroplane mode
or conversion mode on this?



Left. Correction, right. Right. To me.



Come on. Right, right, right.
To me. Right, right.



- Oh, yeah, baby.
- That is the golden glow.



Lower, lower, lower.



- Bring them down lower.
- Send them away. Turn them around.



- Turn them around.
- Bring them down. Another pass.



Another pass. Take it around.



All right, we don't know
where you are, so...



l was also the first to
use the Ospreys,



which are for extracting soldiers.
lt's kind of like a helicopter plane.



lt's like these gigantic helicopter blades.
Looks very dangerous, if you ask me.



And they actually rotate down
and become gigantic propellers



and go forward and go
about 300- something miles an hour.



- Move back, please.
- That was awesome.



Warthogs were a very
interesting kind of plane



'cause it's kind of eerie,
'cause they get very low



and they've just
got this whine to it.



- Are they coming, Josh?
- They are.



Good.



Okay, come higher up.
Come higher up.



Right now, right now, guys.



And it's got a lethal cannon on it.
You know, it's a creepy plane.



lf you're on the ground,
you don't want to be there



if it's shooting at you.



The military gave us
the use of the Spooky,



which is a C- 1 30,
specially equipped.



lt's got, like, 1 8 guns.



lt's the thing they use to
shoot Taliban in Afghanistan.



lt's a vicious old plane,
but it's very lethal.



The 49th Fighter Wing at
Holloman is the home



of the stealth fighter,
the F- 1 1 7 Nighthawk.



Well, they scrambled the stealth fighter.
Like 50 of them staged there,



so we had them all rolling around,
and it was crazy.



lt's still a very sensitive aircraft,
the technology



that is involved with it
is still very top secret.



l don't want you
filming from that angle, please.



We had to just, basically,
make sure that



certain protocols were kept in mind.



That you couldn't film it
that way,



you couldn't get close to it
this way.



And once again,
their production bent over backwards



to make sure that
they followed all the rules.



Our tax dollars happily at work.



One of the things that
a lot of people don't understand



that all military support is
on a cost basis.



This cost the taxpayer
absolutely nothing.



The movie pays for



any costs of the aircraft
and personnel



that cannot otherwise be
used in training missions.



lf a helicopter is flying and it costs
X number of dollars per hour to fly



that helicopter,
the production company reimburses it.



The technology that
the government allowed us to be around



and some of the tools
they allowed us to use,



you wouldn't be able to get
anywhere else in the world.



These are target practise tanks.



What they do is, this one is
a mock- up of a fake foreign tank,



so that targeting systems
could pick out friend or foe



when they shoot them
in the missile test range.



At Holloman they have
what is known as a tank graveyard.



And there's probably 1 ,000 tanks and
self- propelled artillery pieces



and stuff like that.



And the first time l took Michael in there,
he was like a kid at Christmas.



lt was like, ''Can l have that?
Can l have that?



''Can l burn that?
Can l blow that up?''



Absolutely, anything you want.



Set! Fire!



- Anything?
- Yeah, it was all right.



- Peace?
- Peace.



- Violent.
- Yeah.



The tank was something that had already
been modified by another show.



Somebody owned it,
all right, so we modified it



and came up with
a cool paint job.



lt was a cool,
kind of non- radar detectible



paint job that was based on some
camo that we saw on this



futuristic battleship image.



We found on the lnternet



this minesweeper that the military uses,
they send to lraq.



lt's very cool.
lt's called a Buffalo.



But we call it Bonecrusher.



How fast does that Bonecrusher go,
by the way?



- Fifty.
- lt must take forever to get there, right?



The image that they used to promote
this vehicle had this shot



of this arm extended and
this big multi- tined fork



foreground in the shot. And
we finally get the data on this machine



and it turns out that this fork



is, like, 1 4- inches wide.



And they totally cheated
the whole thing in Photoshop.



This giant thing coming at you,
you know,



that looks like it
could lift up a bus,



is, like, this big.



We were, like, what the...You know,
so we basically made this appliance



that goes over the existing one



that more replicates
the version of the machine



that we had been reacting to.



Originally,
the police car was an Autobot.



lt seemed like to keep it
with our theme of...



All the Decepticons seem to take on
the disguises of authoritarian vehicles,



military jet, tank, police car.



lt seemed like a good change.



So Barricade's in there as a police car.



Slide the headlight forward and
then bring the other arm over.



Overtake the headlight.



- The idea being to start...
- Spin its little eye a little.



Barricade is a really fun character.
He's wicked and mean.



Okay! All right!
Okay! Stop, stop, stop, stop.



l'm sorry. Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay!
All right! Okay! Look! Look! Look!



Stop! Stop!



One of the first thoughts we had, of course,
was to include Soundwave



in the Decepticons.



And in our first draft,
we actually did have Soundwave.



We started to realise that we were
not really servicing that character



in a way that was gonna
make us or fans happy.



So we said, ''
Rather than doing it wrong,



''let's actually create a character
who is a distant cousin of Soundwave's.''



And that's how Frenzy was born.



Frenzy, which is a boom box



that transforms into this wicked little,
three- foot- tall, vicious- looking robot.



This was something that l invented.



We did an animated Frenzy.



We wanted to see...l did facial studies
on how its eye stalks moved



and how his mouth moved and
how his mask came out



of this little boom box, you know,
so we did some exploration with that.



We started
with the computer- designed puppet



and we had to go back
and retrofit



and make those things that
look mechanical in design



actually be mechanical.



Take it apart and kind
of work backwards.



What they'll do with
the full- sized mechanical version of this



is that when you bring it to
the set under the lighting conditions



it's also gonna help out
with the CGl guys,



so they could see how
an actual, real item would react



in that environment.



One, two, three.



Mostly, it's something to
interact with the actors,



'cause they would have to be
fighting against nothing.



lt's from the Robot Spring Collection.
lt's real nice.



lt's a new scarf
DreamWorks bought me.



l just put it on
when l get cold outside.



That's all that this is.



l am Megatron.



There's more
where that came from.



Megatron
was represented as a pistol,



a very realistic- looking pistol



that, in Japan,
actually shot little pellets.



That mechanism
didn't work in the U.S.,



but that worked well for a villain
in the '80s.



For us, A,
we didn't want anyone shrinking,



particularly the bad guy.
We realised that for him to do that



would be the equivalent of Darth Vader
turning into his own lightsaber



and having someone else
swing him around.



lt's a movie. You have to update.



To keep it in the '80s would
be great for the 25 of you on the lnternet.



But for the world, it's like,
you cannot have Megatron as a gun.



Join them in extinction!



Megatron transforms into kind of
an alien plane.



And because he's the most arrogant
and vain of the whole thing



and because he doesn't have to
really hide,



he's one of the only Decepticons
who actually goes from his protoform



right into his alien jet protoform.



What came up was just
designing this kind of alien craft.



lt would hearken to
what is happening on Cybertron.



So this was a way to show
how truly foreign these guys are.



l want these robots to look
like they fit in the real world



and look like
it's photo- real right now.



The only thing that looks a little winky
is that thing. lt just looks like a...



Too thin?



Yeah, it just looks
like surgery equipment.



All right, cool.



Okay, guys, that's about all
the time. lt's 1 2:00.



lt's time to go.
Time to go. Time to go.



- One more thing, right here.
- l got a lot more...to do.



You can't abuse me. You're abusing me.
That's abusing my time.



- That was the plan.
- You're taking advantage.



ln terms of our effects,
we had lndustrial Light and Magic



that were heading up Transformers,
and we had Digital Domain,



which is an effects company
that l recently purchased.



Both companies did the work
for this movie.



lt's a bad dream.



lLM did three quarters, and
Digital Domain did the last quarter.



For us in the visual effects world,
having giant robots to animate



had a lot of really great potential.
Something to really look forward to.



They assembled
a great team up there.



l heard we were the show that
everyone wanted to be on because...



There were just tons
of Transformer geeks,



so it was like a mob session
to get onto the show.



l thought l was a huge fan. But
some of the people l've met here



since we got the project just
blow me away.



You know, compared to some people
out there, my collection is nothing.



There's people who have 1 0 times
what l have.



l'd estimate l have
about six or seven hundred, l think.



Working on this movie has been this
great full- circle experience for me,



going from playing
with the toys as a kid



to getting to be a part
of the movie version.



Once we were awarded the job,



we started developing what the robots
really will look like,



what are all the pieces
gonna look like,



and we start having modelers,
here at our place,



start modeling those things,



because it takes a good four,
five, six months to build one robot.



Michael wanted a level of realism that
required us to go much, much, further



with the complexity of the robots.



For instance, l've got a little
Transformer that's on my desk.



He has 51 pieces in him.



Our Optimus in the movie has 1 0,1 08 parts
that all have to be hand- made.



lt's in the computer, but it gives you
some idea of the level of complexity.



They take photographs
of real automotive parts



and they kind of scale things in.



All the Decepticons and Autobots, together,
were about 60,000 pieces



that all had to move.



lf the frame has
three robots in it,



it takes 38 hours to
render one frame of film.



Nowadays l'm doing
less and less storyboards.



Animatics are just
becoming a better tool.



lt is basically a Saturday- morning
cartoon of the movie.



From that, they'll show
us what's gonna happen.



You can work out some
very complicated camera moves.



Especially when you're working with
a height difference of 28 feet, 40 feet.



So you automatically start embracing
ideas of animation and physics,



and trying to incorporate that
in your little mini- movies.



lt's a different process of filmmaking.



This is the first film with Michael Bay
that l've actually worked on



where the animatics carry
as much weight as the script.



Watch out!



Michael is a genius
at making these movies,



and he knows when
it's gonna be live,



and he knows when it's gonna
be visual effects.



He likes to split it up, where it's
partially visual and a lot of live action.



Action!



A lot of directors
don't like to go that way



because it's easier to
go the visual- effects route.



The great thing about Michael is
he tries to get so much in camera.



Five, four, three...



Because what we like to do
is take our visual effects



and really supplement
what's possible to film.



But the more real stuff that
he has in each shot,



the more believable it's gonna be.



And ready in three,
two, one, jump.



The big challenge with Transformers



is that we were working a lot
with robots that weren't really there.



The robot's got 1 5- foot- long feet,
you know, and 8 feet wide.



So you have these huge things that you
have to tell the camera people about,



tell the set people about.



''You can't have it that close.
He's filling this whole volume.''



You know, you try telling that to
the guys when they arrive on set,



and it's like, ''What?''



At first, everybody kind of in shock.
''What? He's that big?''



But we had simple tools on set.



We have our blueprint,
the animatic.



We have our cheat sheets,
all the sizes of the robots.



They would bring these poles in,
and everything else is acting



and working around this pole
that will soon be a robot.



We're literally using window- washer
poles to act with, you know?



And it's a tough thing.



You gotta be in love
with the pole.



That's been the stretch for me.
lt's a different form of acting.



- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio.



1 30 digital channels of non- stop,
commercial- free music,



news and entertainment.



So you talk through the radio,
then, right?



And a mighty voice will send a message
summoning forth visitors from heaven.



We all became immediate
fans of Shia LaBeouf,



because our robots are worth nothing



if the actors don't interact
with them properly.



Every day, all day long, my dialogue
was with the A- camera operator.



Okay, roll on them. Go to profile.



And our dialogue is with Michael
all the time, ''Let's plan this,''



and you work out
what the move will be.



- Yeah, you're right where Shia was.
- So you're backing up,



and we're gonna go,
''Three, two, one,'' you're going,



and the thing is that you're
backing up like this on the ground



because you're seeing it kind
of go up in front you, all right?



lt was a learning curve, l must say.
And he got much better at it.



The surprising thing with the crew is
how quickly they learn.



l'm trying to help them
imagine the unimaginable.



Pretty soon everybody starts
to believe that they're there.



And then you guys are gonna
crawl back that way, 'cause...



We wanna get out of the way.



Yeah, you don't wanna get squished.



Michael was very insistent about
the robots being energetic



and being able to do
all these acrobatic stunts.



We wanted to have fighters



and guys that could manoeuvre in ways
that you'd never seen before.



We went into this development phase



of showing how agile
we could make the robots



and still convey a sense of weight.



And we found that the closer things got to
camera, the faster they could move.



But when you see the entire robot
at a further distance,



we had to really slow things
down to help sell their weight.



l used real stunt fighters.
We'd do fight choreography



with Kenny's guys,
that were great fighters,



a different type of ninja- type move.



What we did was
create a fighting style



that represented the characters
of each robot.



We would video these fights,
not mo- cap,



and it would help the animators
get their movements down



and how we wanted to
execute certain fighting scenes.



More than anyone,
the animators are so involved



in bringing these characters to life.



And the nice thing is, you know,
Michael is open to feedback.



l'd give them a lot of freedom.



''So what do you think? What do you
think Optimus would do?''



And they all know Transformers,
you know, forward and backwards,



and, you know,
you'll see things in the movie



that reference the old cartoon,
because they were such big fans of it.



Come on, Decepticon punk!



We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.



We had to get into Michael's head
about who these characters were.



And believe it or not,



it's very hard to animate any type
of emotion from a robot



if you don't have things that move.



Michael stressed to us
how important it was



to get the performance
to read in the eyes.



The majority of the performance
is sold in the eyes.



The more we added,
it just made it more real



and felt like
there's a soul in there.



My name is Optimus Prime.



We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.



We have a lot of
transforming robots.



l think originally
we started with 1 5 transformations.



We have over 40 now
in the film.



ln the original cartoon, you could
have robots kind of transform midair



and you really wouldn't
care about laws of physics.



This was almost too easy!



Every single transformation
in this movie is done



as if these transformations
were actually taking place



in real space and in real time.



There's not too many people
in the world



that could've figured this out.
You know, it takes a real genius



to be able to disassemble
these things



and put them back together
in a different shape.



Yeah, we didn't want to have
metal actually change shape.



We wanted to find a place
for it on the vehicle,



and find a place for it that
corresponded with the robot.



We would really play to camera, like
have all the important pieces show up,



move, rotate and go back,



while we were shuffling a bunch
of cards behind the scenes.



ln the Optimus transformation,
this is the camera move.



And what we would do on set
is we would put a pole



representing Optimus's height.
And that's what we start with.



The next thing we do is we match
the camera move on the computer.



So this is what Optimus would look like
if he were just standing in the shot,



on the ground.



So this is the transformation take.



So it's all happening right
in front of camera,



in front of the audience's eyes.
And you can see the detail.



We go to the final rendered take,



you know, there's cast, car parts,
there's engine pieces, there's gears,



there's headlights, the trailer hitch,
his tyres...



They could do whatever they
wanted to each individual part.



Friends of mine that are not in this business
are always kind of nonplussed



when l tell them that we have to,
in a computer,



completely recreate every single situation
that we're shooting in.



What that means is our match- mover,
he's got to be able to come back here,



and completely reconstruct
that in the computer,



because the computer doesn't know
where anything is.



We have spatial marks
out on this area,



and Duncan, of course,
measures each one.



Later on, we know exactly
where these spots were,



'cause we have to rebuild it
wherever he makes contact



with either the ground
or the objects around.



So when you see these guys stand
on things and sit on things,



and bang against things,



even the buildings that are,
you know, 1 0 story's tall,



all have to be mapped
and measured on set.



There's a lot involved in making
these vehicles and robots look real.



We would go out and
take pictures of the tyre tread.



The treads on our Optimus



are the same as the treads
on the real truck, you know.



And the detail,
down to the smallest bolt,



or the engine block, all that stuff,
we were very meticulous.



You want to see a car driving down
the road, and see it transform,



and watch it and say,
''Well, those are real car parts.''



And to me, that's always the most fun
and the most challenging thing,



is, ''Can we make this stuff look real?''



We did huge packages of,
like, texture reference.



An abrasion reference for even
the robots internally.



'Cause we didn't want them
to be so squeaky- clean



that they were uninteresting.



So on his hand,
the surface was perfectly smooth,



and then we add in these scratches
and nicks and dings.



The hardest part about this film
is we don't have real robots,



we have real cars.



And the real cars, they're buffing.



You look at a real car that's just been
washed and polished and shined up,



and it almost looks like a CG car.



So the hard part was trying to
find a balance of dirt and ageing



to add to the robots that didn't
make it look implausible



that they could've come
from this very clean car.



So all the car paints,
l have multiple layers.



They have a colourful layer,
which is right here,



you see yellow reflections in here,



but there's also a clear coat on top of
it, which is supposed to protect it,



but it also gives you a really
white reflection,



so you always see a colorful
reflection next to a white reflection.



Probably two years ago
we couldn't do this movie



because of lighting
and ray tracing,



which is a way
you light things.



We've spent a lot of time
getting the lighting right.



lt's very complicated to
get all the specularity.



'Cause l'm a lighting buff,
you know,



and especially shooting
so many car commercials,



l would give dissertations at lLM



of, like, ''Okay, if you see a car,
it's gonna have a hot spot,



''it's got flat here,
it's got more hot spots,



''it's got a long highlight there...''



And it's very confusing
when you look at it.



lt's not like just one
soft light on the car.



So they had to really invent how to
light these things so complicated



to make them look like
they're moving



and it's like reflecting
car parts in a real world.



And so we're always
trying to add that in,



and we're trying to give
that sort of look to our robots,



and adding glints, and
what he calls pings,



you know, where you
highlight certain areas.



These tiny little lights that are
being reflected in the surfaces



is what he's after.



That was so interesting for us



that l think most of us lighting
people became road hazards,



because we were driving
around looking at other cars.



The robots are shiny.



They have glass. They have metal.
They have painted surfaces.



The entire environment
has to reflect.



So every single shot has
an environment recorded for it



that gets now projected
onto the robot.



Otherwise it will look
phoney- baloney.



We apply everything
that we've gathered from set,



which is really high- resolution
environments,



and everything is being
reflected in the car panels.



And obviously these robots
are moving around a lot.



So we're getting a lot of
reflective play on the surfaces,



since there are major,
major light sources in here,



from the headlights,
there's the overhead balloon,



there are the eyeballs in there,
which have to be glowing,



the blinking lights, we have the blinker
right here, and then the face,



and his mouth talking is being
reflected in the hood of the car.



And that is what really
sells it at the end.



That's sort of the icing
on the cake for us.



Go, fire!



Our job, and our task,
to create the illusion



that everything was
just shot on the same day,



and that these robots,
who aren't even real, were there.



lLM is known for its really
fabulous level of compositing.



And these guys just look at
the shot as artists, all day long,



judging whether or not that thing
looks like it's really in there.



We start with a background plate,
obviously, the shot in production,



and then we take computer- generated
elements and we add them to the shot.



Michael is the type of guy that wants
to shoot things messy, which l love,



'cause you shoot the explosions,



or all the debris or anything,
on set.



lt makes it harder for us,
but it's real.



Let's say the bomb goes off
next to the robot.



We have to model the robot,



but then we have topull out
that debris out of the plate



and put him in there behind it,



'cause he's got to
fit into the background,



but behind that debris
that might be gone.



lt's very much a process
for the compositor



to get in there and make everything
feel real again.



And that's what those guys do.



They attack the shot and take it
to the point where it's finished.



Fire!



We shot a plate of
the real helicopter.



But in this case it ended up being
easier just to remove that helicopter.



This is what the background plate was.



We essentially removed
the real helicopter,



and then replaced
it with our own.



So here the compositor has
actually added in the helicopter,



layered the soldiers
back over the top,



added in some bullet hits



for when the soldiers actually
fire and hit Blackout,



and then enhanced muzzle
flashes in some cases



to try to just bring out
the visual excitement of the scene.



And then in the background here,



where we had, you know,
previously a blank tarmac,



we've added more soldiers
and just more firing



as a texture of excitement,



just to make it look like they're hitting
them with everything they've got.



My God.



Everyone is just amazed at
what they've done with the robots,



in terms of just how real it looks,
how complicated it is.



When you finally achieve a look
where it really looks real,



that's it. That's
the biggest excitement of the day.



There are definitely days when
we go in and we review the shots,



and one comes up and you just think,
''Whoa! That's incredible.



''lt looks like a real Transformer.''



That takes a high degree of artistry
and technical support



to make these things look that way.



There's this Decepticon called
Skorponok that's tracking them,



and he's tracking them under the sand.



lt's Jaws,
but it's in the desert.



And we were actually looking through
one of the books of all the characters,



and we kind of went through,
''Hey, there's a scorpion in the desert.''



And Skorponok is perfect, too,



because he's also sort of different
than the other Decepticons.



He doesn't particularly turn into
a vehicle, or whatever.



His form is very much about
the environment.



The scorpion is great for the desert,



and it's sort of a good shout out to
the fans of, like, Beast Wars.



And some of the incarnations
of Transformers



that are a little bit more animal- based
than vehicle- based.



ln pre- production,
they built all these animatics



so they know anything
that has a lot of actiony stuff



or there's Transformers
coming through,



or, you know, you're being chased
by one, or whatever it is.



They have these animatics built,



the computerised sort of animation of
the scene, before they even shoot it.



Skorponok was one of the ones that
we, in the department,



animated completely in 3D, you know,
like, l wanted to have



the notion of these components from
the Sea Stallion helicopter,



which is basically
what he is birthed from.



So he has these kind of Sea Stallion
helicopter components to him



and the turbines for his hands.



And l wanted to see how
these things could turn



and how he could dig in and then shoot
the sand out the exhaust.



All those things that
we developed in the department,



'cause we thought it was just
a bitching- looking scorpion.



lt's more like these, but there was some
that it didn't look...



They were taller than that.



These are his target practice?



Right now we're at
Holloman Air Force Base



in Alamogordo, New Mexico.



This is actually
a very active military base



because they do a lot of support work
for the war effort in lraq right now.



Since it's a missile range,



everywhere you go there's a chance
of live ordnance.



We go to this fence on the scout
and it says, ''Don't walk in,



''live ordnance could be possible,
unexploded bombs, blah, blah, blah.''



And l'm like, ''Okay.''



So we step over the fence,
and it was weird walking.



And l kept walking, you know,
but looking down...



So we actually had
a minesweeper clear,



when we shot there,
for a good five acres.



You see a little bit of go...



And then the two mandibles...
Kenny, move over this way.



Put it where he tells you.



But the idea that they bust through and
then have the wire pull them away.



You know?



Probably, no matter what,
you want them on either side...



- Yeah.
- Let's...You know, it would be nice,



whatever he does...
Whatever he does,



it should be small and build,
like a crescendo.



We are in Holloman missile range.
Don't pick up anything with a red tip...



- Yeah.
- ...or that looks like a bomb.



l'm gonna light this town up, baby.



Ready!



ln New Mexico
we all had a really good time.



We blew up hundreds and hundreds of
pounds of black powder



and thousands of feet of primer cord.



See, that is right where
l told you about wetting it down.



The chunk. You seen the chunks
in there, Michael?



We had primer cord, which can take down
a tree or destroy a car.



lt's a little, like,
rope- like explosive.



l had them lay out
like 200 of these strands



so that they can fire it on
a millisecond thing where it's like...



lt makes it look kind of
like a wave coming at you.



They put the high explosives on,
then they put just carpet on top of it.



And then they put sand
on top of the carpet.



And when this was ignited
in a sequential order,



the carpet just lifted up and
it bounced the sand high enough



and it gave Michael the exact look
that he wanted.



Heads up!



Cut.



- How was that, Dave?
- Cut! Cut!



- Huh?
- Good.



- Were you still on it when it was falling?
- Yes, sir.



There were a lot of bombs,
a lot of explosions, a lot of strafe hits.



There were people flying through the air.
We had guys on ratchets.



Now!



So what happens in this shot, besides me
squinting like crazy, is Skorponok



is running through the ground.



Of course, l'm not the smartest ranger,
so l'm...



l'm looking around, he's right behind me...



Right through the chest. And then...
Takes me back and eats me.



Apparently Decepticons eat children.



Ta- da.



That was good.



The idea is we're trying to time the sand



so the burst- out happens with Skorponok.



We're imagining where his entrance point
would be in the sand.



At some point we might change our actor
into a CG replicate of this guy



to be able to manipulate him.



That was cool.



That was cool.



All right, let's go to the tail, please.



And action.



Go. Follow it.



Michael wanted a Skorponok's tail
slithering through the sand.



We just made a whole track right
out of plywood,



which actually had a groove in it.



They put a lightweight plastic down



and then you put a razor blade in front of it



and as the scorpion is going through it,
it just cuts that path.



Get anything, anybody?



You know, some. A little piece.



All right, guys, l'm gonna show you
an animatic of what we're doing.



lt's a pretty cool shot.



lt's a trailer shot we're doing right now.



Hey, watch this.



lt's the one where he jumps out.
So l need you to run...



He's right on you.
You know what l'm saying?



So you got to have
that on your faces, all right?



All right.



Trailer shot, see? Trailer shot.



Which camera am
l running towards, Mike?



You're running towards
that umbrella, guys.



That umbrella's where
we're running, all right?



The actors, they had to run, and
l'm like, ''Tyrese, don't trip.



'''Cause that's a real explosive.
lf it goes off, you better run.''



All right, y'all. This is it,
Jack, the trailer. Full throttle.



l mean, this is more heroic.



Action!



That fear on their face
was them being real.



What the...is that?



l said, ''Just remember at one point to
look back and look up.''



- Were you still screaming?
- Oh, yeah. You better believe it.



That was great.



l think l broke my back.



- Did you get anything?
- That's how we do it, baby.



ln each of the shots
that we set up



we have to have a representative
size for Skorponok.



We want to mark where this is,
where the trench is?



This is an lLM sphere.



lt's a lighting reference for
every environment that we're in.



lt helps the artists back at lLM



to correctly place all
the reference lights and shadows



and kind of match everything and
make it look like it sits back in the plate.



Three, two, one, action!



You can see in the plate,



we had really good elements to
start with, in this case.



And anybody that works in CG knows



that sand is one of those things
that you just...



The minute you hear that,
you start to think...



You know, the particle work that's
involved with sand can really drag out.



You can see in this plate right here,
as these primer cord elements go off,



we get this nice plume of sand here.



And what we've done is taken that
same thing, left it in the plate,



and added our robot inside there
and sort of buried him in depth.



And as he comes forward,
we reveal more and more of him.



Run! Run!



Oh, what is that?



You know, it's not a bad job.
