1
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:37,796
I need to speak with him.

2
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:44,349
- <i>Excuse me. Do you remember me?</i>
- Can I help you?</i>

3
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:47,930
I bought some tickets
from you last September.

4
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:50,391
On the 12th.

5
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:52,769
Clifton.

6
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,563
I was with my daughter.

7
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,691
She was abducted downstairs,
on the lower level.

8
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,443
<i>She was 6 at the time.</i>

9
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:08,662
<i>She has red hair
and she came up to about here.</i>

10
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:13,453
She's wearing jeans and a...

11
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:16,456
a purple jacket and...

12
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,088
she has a dark blue backpack.

13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,752
And the jacket has a hood.

14
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,139
<i>No, I haven't seen her.</i>

15
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:27,723
<i>I'm sorry.
We sell hundreds of tickets a day.</i>

16
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:33,388
I just thought she might
have shown up.

17
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:37,602
Or someone
might have seen her.

18
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,107
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

19
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:51,029
Excuse me, sir.

20
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,161
- Have you seen this girl?
- No.

21
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:55,957
She's my daughter.
She's 7 years old, she--

22
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,413
Excuse me.

23
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,133
I'm looking for my daughter.

24
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:03,302
This is her picture.
She was abducted last September.

25
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:07,390
She's wearing jeans,
and a purple coat.

26
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:11,853
- It has a hood.
- <i>I'm sorry, I haven't seen her.</i></i>

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,262
Excuse me.

28
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,190
Have you seen this girl?

29
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:18,352
Please,
this is my daughter.

30
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:20,983
Can you help me, please?

31
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,071
Please, I need your help...

32
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,794
She wanted some candy.

33
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:53,931
Someone took her right here.

34
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,597
God, they took her right
in front of me!

35
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,606
How long was it?

36
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:06,153
It couldn't be that long!

37
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,201
How long did we talk?

38
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,567
10 minutes.

39
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:12,530
10 minutes.
10 minutes, no way.

40
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:14,746
Think! How long?
How long?

41
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:17,800
"Hi, we're at the station,
we're gonna get on the bus".

42
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,289
40 seconds.

43
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,712
"Yes, I'll bring her back by 6 o'clock".

44
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:23,960
"I know, I know".

45
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,258
"No, I won't bring her back late".

46
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,548
A minute and a half.
Maybe two.

47
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:31,966
"Yeah, I'll make sure
she does her homework".

48
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:36,769
We talked about her homework.
3 and a half minutes.

49
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,439
4 minutes tops.
4 minutes.

50
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,694
"You wanna speak with her?
Yeah, hang on".

51
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,571
Yeah, 4 minutes.

52
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,282
4 minutes, that's all.

53
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:51,618
4 minutes,
look around.

54
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:54,449
There must be something.

55
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,135
How did they get her out of here?

56
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,869
<i>4:30 to Carlstadt.</i>

57
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,620
She wouldn't have gone with anyone.

58
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:03,021
<i>Get tickets ready.</i>

59
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,258
Where did they go?

60
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:20,182
They've got on that bus.

61
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:24,359
They left on another bus.

62
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:28,545
Go, go.

63
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:31,546
Go, just go.

64
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,501
<i>No cash accepted.</i>

65
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,250
No cash accepted.

66
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,171
It's too late.

67
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,171
It's too late.

68
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:56,767
Get on the bus, just go.

69
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:59,068
Don't look around.

70
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:01,513
Just go.

71
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,482
Can I pass, please?

72
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,282
There it is!

73
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:05,703
Was it purple?

74
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:09,584
Get off. Now.
Get off.

75
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,380
Can you stop the bus!

76
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:13,884
Can you stop the bus!
I have to get off.

77
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,349
Can you stop the bus?

78
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,344
- You got to sit down!
- Stop the fucking bus!

79
00:06:56,473 --> 00:06:58,466
Sophie!

80
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:02,470
Where are you, Sophie?

81
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:12,771
Where are you?

82
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,119
Sophie, where are you?

83
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:03,240
You did it.

84
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,618
It was your fault.

85
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,081
You let her go.

86
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,475
You stink!

87
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,987
It's OK.
Everything's OK.

88
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,447
Everything's gonna be OK.

89
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,972
Hey, I can't get in my room.
There's a lock on the handle.

90
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,768
- What number?
- 301.

91
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:39,231
You owe a day on the room.
$40.

92
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,988
I'll take it for another week.

93
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,357
<i>320 plus tax.
It's 364.80.</i>

94
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:51,745
How much?

95
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,455
<i>364 dollars and 80 cents.</i>

96
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:57,837
Well, I haven't got enough.

97
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,627
Can you cash a check?

98
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:13,521
It's a federal check.

99
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,518
- You're on disability?
- Yes.

100
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:24,653
<i>It's 5% service charge.</i>

101
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,730
<i>I'll need to see some ID.</i>

102
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,082
I got to get some sleep.

103
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:06,044
Get some rest.

104
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,005
Lie down.

105
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,602
It'll pass.

106
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:29,947
It'll pass. Lay down.
Get some sleep.

107
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,118
Get some rest.

108
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:49,726
Excuse me.

109
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:54,572
I wanna get this for my daughter.
She's about the same size as your girl.

110
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,902
- <i>How old is she?</i>
- 7.</i>

111
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,546
- <i>Angie?</i>
- Do you think it'll fit?</i>

112
00:14:58,623 --> 00:14:59,867
<i>Angela, come here.</i>

113
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, I think so.
It's her size.

114
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,127
How about this?

115
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,301
<i>Oh, this is too big.
Yes, this size is 12.</i>

116
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,845
<i>She's her size?</i>

117
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,056
<i>She takes the size 8.</i>

118
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:21,057
Thanks.

119
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:36,033
You have to be presentable
when you get her back.

120
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,366
You're her father.

121
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,497
You need to set a good example.

122
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,646
Hi! Is this Ray?

123
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,436
It's William.

124
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,531
William Keane.

125
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,071
Is Ann there?

126
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:21,995
Hey, hang on!
Hang on a second!

127
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:23,612
Is she there?

128
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:27,662
Look, I just wanna talk to her.

129
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:33,542
Well, when will she be back?

130
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:42,011
Will you tell her I called
and I'll try again?

131
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:47,262
Thanks.

132
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:18,052
A vodka.

133
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,013
Keep going.

134
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,534
Another.

135
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,092
Hey, how do I hear the music?
Can I hear the music!

136
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,630
Louder.
Can you make it louder?

137
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,514
I can barely hear it!

138
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:38,527
<i>It's loud enough.</i>

139
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:41,150
Come on, man! I paid for it!
Turn it up!

140
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:47,703
You turn up the music!

141
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:49,993
If you don't like it,
get the fuck out!

142
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,919
Will you turn up the music?

143
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:32,757
<i>Get off the chair.</i>

144
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,117
<i>Get off the the fucking chair!</i>

145
00:21:55,373 --> 00:21:56,369
What's up?

146
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,000
I need some coke.

147
00:21:58,793 --> 00:21:59,623
<i>How many?</i>

148
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,034
Two.

149
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,042
I see you.

150
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:46,537
I see all of you.

151
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,907
4:26.

152
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:25,957
It's a sign.

153
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:32,251
4:30 to Carlstadt.
He took her on the 4:30.

154
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,385
He's here.
He's right here.

155
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,236
4:28.

156
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:20,766
OK, just wait.

157
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,606
<i>Tell me why</i>

158
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:37,908
<i>the stars do shine</i>

159
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:43,197
<i>Tell me why
the ivy twines</i>

160
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:49,168
<i>Tell me why
the skies are blue</i>

161
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:54,674
<i>And I will tell you
just why I love you</i>

162
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:02,183
<i>Because God made
the stars to shine</i>

163
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:07,846
<i>Because God made
the ivy twine</i>

164
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:13,863
<i>Because God made
the sky so blue</i>

165
00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:19,612
<i>Because God made you</i>

166
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:23,367
<i>that's why I love you...</i>

167
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:30,707
What time is it?

168
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:34,008
There's still a minute.
One more minute.

169
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,007
He's here.

170
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:46,176
I can feel it.

171
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:50,931
He's coming.

172
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:55,569
Look at the gate,
keep looking at the gate.

173
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,363
Just look at the gate.

174
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:58,813
Watch the gate.

175
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,626
It's not him.

176
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:10,287
It's still too early.

177
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:13,035
It's still too early.
Just wait.

178
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,424
He's gonna come.

179
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,636
He's here.

180
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,805
I know it.

181
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:39,636
Think!
Think!

182
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,829
4:30 to Carlstadt, gate 8.

183
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:53,178
They took the 4:30, gate 8.
Why isn't he using it?

184
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:55,264
Why isn't he using the gate?

185
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:13,814
Because he knows you're watching.

186
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:19,356
Oh my God, he knows who you are.

187
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:22,778
He's seen you.

188
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,079
He's looking at you right now.

189
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:36,003
Where is he?
He's looking at you right now.

190
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,321
Move! Move!
You got to move! Move!

191
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:53,263
Wait! You have to go after him.
You have to turn the tables.

192
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,100
He's not coming after you.

193
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:56,686
You have to get him.

194
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:02,776
He's here. He's right here.

195
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:17,577
Come on!

196
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:28,969
He knows you know.

197
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,892
Wait.

198
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:35,440
He's going to leave.

199
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:37,398
He's on his way out.

200
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,436
Hurry, you have to go.

201
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:41,643
Now!

202
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:52,076
Look.

203
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:16,981
There he is.

204
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:18,513
That's him.

205
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:30,490
That's him.

206
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:33,990
Just keep going.
Go, go.

207
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,046
Where is she?
What did you do to her?

208
00:29:55,104 --> 00:29:56,681
Where is she?

209
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:14,368
Someone get the cops!

210
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:26,282
Walk, walk.

211
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:28,332
Stay calm.

212
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,008
Nobody's looking at you.

213
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:39,844
Breathe.

214
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:47,251
Your boss,
what did he say?

215
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,341
He says until Wednesday morning.

216
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,885
<i>This Wednesday?</i>

217
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:53,162
<i>There's no way,
I won't have it by then.</i>

218
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,888
<i>What can I do?
It's out of my hands.</i>

219
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:56,551
<i>It's out of your hands?</i>

220
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:58,468
<i>So what's gonna happen?</i>

221
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:01,225
<i>Oh, so long as it's not
your problem, right?</i>

222
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:03,685
<i>What should I tell her, huh?
She's 7.</i>

223
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,752
<i>Tell her whatever you want.
You're her mother.</i>

224
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:08,879
That's right, I am her mother.
Fucking asshole!

225
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,560
Fuck you!

226
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,370
<i>What's gonna happen on Wednesday?</i>

227
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:26,252
<i>I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

228
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:29,040
- <i>Kira, give me the bag.</i>
- It's all right, I got it.</i>

229
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:30,710
<i>Kira, give me the bag!</i>

230
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:32,833
Hold on.

231
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:41,759
<i>Could you please pick up your feet?
Thank you.</i>

232
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,324
<i>Who is it?</i>

233
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,206
Hi, my name is William Keane,
I'm staying down the hall.

234
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:08,998
- Can I help you?
- Who is it?

235
00:33:09,172 --> 00:33:10,964
Kira, get ready for bed! Now.

236
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,296
Now!

237
00:33:13,385 --> 00:33:16,390
What do you want? -I overheard
your conversation in the lobby.

238
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:17,791
<i>Yeah, is there a problem?</i>

239
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:20,172
No, no,
there's no problem.

240
00:33:20,351 --> 00:33:24,514
I just wanted to give you something
to help you out, <i>and your little girl.</i></i>

241
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:27,261
No, no... that's not necessary.
Thanks.

242
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:30,810
<i>It's a $100. It'll help you
pay for the next couple of nights.</i>

243
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:33,063
No, we're fine.
Really.

244
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:36,736
OK.
It's not what you think, it's--

245
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:39,318
Yeah, I know you don't know me...

246
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:42,451
But look... Please,
I want you to have it.

247
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:43,737
<i>Why?</i>

248
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:45,744
I just want to help out.

249
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:47,578
That's all you want?

250
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,163
<i>Yeah, that's all.</i>

251
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:54,633
<i>Look, I've been in
your position before...</i>

252
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:57,090
and I know what is like and, um...

253
00:33:58,556 --> 00:34:00,513
Please, please take it.

254
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,522
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

255
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,895
It's William.

256
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:14,645
- And what's your name?
- <i>Lynn.</i></i>

257
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,858
It's really nice of you.
Thank you.

258
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:21,276
Well, maybe I'll see you
around... some time.

259
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:24,324
<i>OK, see you around.
It's really late, I got to go.</i>

260
00:35:00,826 --> 00:35:02,569
You're so fucking hot!

261
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:25,590
It's taken!

262
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:39,359
Hang on,
just hang on.

263
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:40,865
I want one more.

264
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:44,566
- Come here.
- <i>Just hang on a second!</i></i>

265
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:49,618
One for you.

266
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:21,447
God, you're so beautiful.

267
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:24,280
Really?
Think I am?

268
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,669
I wanna be inside of you.

269
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,338
It's my shoe.

270
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:05,369
God, you're so good!

271
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,912
Be careful!

272
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:10,949
I'm not using anything.

273
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,258
Is it good?

274
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:25,501
Keep going.

275
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:30,202
Yeah, that's it.

276
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:51,502
Go on.

277
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:02,603
Come on!

278
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,207
What are you doing?

279
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,821
Did you just come inside me?
What the fuck, did you hear me!

280
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,322
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

281
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:16,023
<i>Fuck!</i>

282
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:19,392
<i>Get the fuck out of here!</i>

283
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,145
<i>Fucking asshole!</i>

284
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:38,785
Hey, I'm looking for work.
Are you the manager?

285
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:40,076
Over there.

286
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:44,381
Where? In the garage?
Thanks.

287
00:38:58,105 --> 00:38:59,481
Hey, is the manager in?

288
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:00,431
What do you want?

289
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,019
I'm looking for a job.

290
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:03,682
Omar!

291
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:10,946
- Can I help you?
- Hey, you've got any work?

292
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:13,119
I don't have anything right now.

293
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:16,283
Any part-time?
Pump-gas, whatever...

294
00:39:16,665 --> 00:39:18,789
Sorry, I don't have anything.

295
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:35,638
Hey, I'm looking for a job.
Do you need any help?

296
00:41:38,141 --> 00:41:39,516
Is this a bad time?

297
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:41,435
No, not at all.

298
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:44,556
Have you eaten yet?
I got a bunch of take-out.

299
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,854
Do you wanna join me
and my daughter?

300
00:41:46,883 --> 00:41:48,432
Sure. When?

301
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:50,520
Whenever you're ready.
There's no rush.

302
00:41:50,695 --> 00:41:51,608
OK. Give me a minute.

303
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:55,536
- OK. 314.
- OK, great.

304
00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:14,422
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

305
00:42:20,057 --> 00:42:23,565
- Come in. Do you want a beer?
- Sure.

306
00:42:25,397 --> 00:42:27,603
<i>Kira, can you say hi to William?</i>

307
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:33,541
- <i>Here you go.</i>
- Thanks.</i>

308
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,401
<i>Have a seat.</i>

309
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:49,788
Do you like Cuban food?

310
00:42:50,046 --> 00:42:53,753
- It's chicken, rice and beans.
- <i>Sure. Great.</i></i>

311
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:02,973
<i>What are you doing?
Your homework?</i>

312
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:09,558
You're learning how to tell time?

313
00:43:11,651 --> 00:43:13,810
<i>Kira, go wash your hands,
we're gonna eat.</i>

314
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:16,735
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- <i>No, thanks.</i></i>

315
00:43:16,906 --> 00:43:18,752
- Are you sure?
- <i>Yeah.</i></i>

316
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:22,317
- <i>Kira?</i>
- I'm going.</i>

317
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,619
How long have you been here?

318
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,962
<i>Here in the hotel?</i>

319
00:43:32,797 --> 00:43:34,256
<i>8 or 9 days.</i>

320
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:36,633
Since...

321
00:43:37,677 --> 00:43:39,338
the Sunday before last.

322
00:43:40,305 --> 00:43:43,721
Just came from Clifton to try
and find some work in the city.

323
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:45,006
<i>What do you do?</i>

324
00:43:45,185 --> 00:43:46,299
I'm a painter.

325
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,312
Houses,
I paint houses.

326
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,477
I do some <i>construction sometimes,
and that stuff.</i></i>

327
00:43:53,943 --> 00:43:55,058
Have you had any luck?

328
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:57,988
<i>Not yet, but you know,
I got some leads.</i>

329
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:02,191
It takes time,
something will show up.

330
00:44:06,092 --> 00:44:08,592
<i>Kira, here.</i>

331
00:44:10,168 --> 00:44:12,043
Give this to William.

332
00:44:14,172 --> 00:44:15,251
Go on.

333
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:22,952
Thank you.

334
00:44:45,537 --> 00:44:47,114
Thanks for having me.

335
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:49,530
You're welcome.

336
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:04,573
- <i>She's sleeping?</i>
- Yeah.</i>

337
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:12,002
- <i>Do you want another beer?</i>
- Sure.</i>

338
00:45:37,974 --> 00:45:39,474
Thanks.

339
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:42,489
- Cheers.
- <i>Cheers.</i></i>

340
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:50,551
It's nice of you to help us out.

341
00:45:51,228 --> 00:45:53,101
I'm gonna pay you back
as soon as I can.

342
00:45:53,271 --> 00:45:54,517
<i>You don't have to.</i>

343
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,267
No, I want to.

344
00:46:04,074 --> 00:46:05,782
Where's Kira's father?

345
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:10,079
<i>He's up in Albany.</i>

346
00:46:10,455 --> 00:46:14,369
<i>He got a job in a new water
treatment plant they opened.</i>

347
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:19,373
We're just waiting for him
to find us a place

348
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:21,539
and then we're gonna go join him.

349
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:26,727
<i>When do you think
you're gonna go?</i>

350
00:46:28,765 --> 00:46:31,090
I've been here
7 weeks already.

351
00:46:32,894 --> 00:46:36,393
I need to go up there and work things out
one way or the other.

352
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,938
<i>What about you?
Do you have any family?</i>

353
00:46:42,863 --> 00:46:44,273
No.
Not really.

354
00:46:45,073 --> 00:46:47,232
I have a brother in San Diego.

355
00:46:48,368 --> 00:46:51,137
But, you know,
we don't really keep in touch.

356
00:46:51,205 --> 00:46:54,822
He's 15 years older than me, and he
left home when I was very young.

357
00:46:58,003 --> 00:46:59,544
He sells insurance.

358
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:04,174
<i>Have you ever married?</i>

359
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:12,547
Yeah...
Once.

360
00:47:16,062 --> 00:47:17,474
It didn't work out.

361
00:47:21,694 --> 00:47:23,022
I'm sorry.

362
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:44,084
Do you wanna dance?

363
00:47:46,926 --> 00:47:48,042
Now?

364
00:49:24,817 --> 00:49:27,568
You should go.
I have to be up early for work.

365
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,982
I didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable.

366
00:49:34,026 --> 00:49:36,402
<i>No, you didn't.
It's just a long day.</i>

367
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:39,778
- <i>I'm tired. Can we leave it at that?</i>
- Sure.</i>

368
00:49:44,836 --> 00:49:46,664
- <i>Thanks for dinner.</i>
- You're welcome.</i>

369
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:51,365
Good night.

370
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:02,134
Good night.

371
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:10,695
Ron, is Eric there?

372
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:12,608
Do you know where he is?

373
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:16,367
This is his wife.
Do you know if he's at work?

374
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:20,989
<i>Tell him I'll call back at 6.</i>

375
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:22,695
<i>Tonight.</i>

376
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,535
<i>Will you make sure
he gets the message?</i>

377
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:28,505
<i>Tell him I have to speak to him.
It's urgent.</i>

378
00:50:28,922 --> 00:50:30,630
<i>Tell him I have to speak to him.</i>

379
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:34,293
At 6. Tonight.

380
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:38,131
Tell him Kira misses him.

381
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:40,298
Kira!

382
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,799
Thanks.

383
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,614
MISSING NEW JERSEY GIRL
REUNITED WITH FAMILY

384
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:35,160
Her father says her street smart's got
her through.

385
00:54:38,296 --> 00:54:41,214
She shouldn't talk to strangers.
She got distracted.

386
00:54:41,383 --> 00:54:45,167
She's not the kind of girl
to go off like that.

387
00:54:45,346 --> 00:54:47,574
She shouldn't have done that.
They got her back.

388
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,010
They found her.

389
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:53,477
They got their girl back.

390
00:54:53,646 --> 00:54:56,896
After time, they got her back.

391
00:54:58,484 --> 00:55:00,358
They got her back.

392
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:08,858
"Thank you, all the volunteers and friends
who helped looking for my little girl".

393
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:12,243
Mother said: "Thank you".

394
00:55:12,414 --> 00:55:16,079
"Thank you to everybody for
helping me find my little girl".

395
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:18,919
She came back.

396
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:21,127
They got their girl back.

397
00:55:42,736 --> 00:55:44,860
- Who is it?
- <i>It's Lynn.</i></i>

398
00:55:50,536 --> 00:55:52,196
I woke you up.
I'll come back.

399
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:55,389
What time is it? -It's nearly 11.
I'll come back another time.

400
00:55:55,457 --> 00:55:57,285
No, no, it's OK.
Come in.

401
00:55:57,386 --> 00:55:59,086
- Yeah?
- Sure.

402
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:05,213
Here.
Sit down.

403
00:56:05,384 --> 00:56:08,718
<i>No, I have to go back.
I left Kira sleeping on her own.</i>

404
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:12,683
<i>Listen, I need to ask you a favor.</i>

405
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:15,805
<i>I was wondering if you could pick
Kira from</i> school tomorrow.</i>

406
00:56:15,978 --> 00:56:18,682
And take care of her,
just from 4 to 7.

407
00:56:18,856 --> 00:56:22,853
There's some things I have to do.
But I'll be back here by 7 at the latest.

408
00:56:23,778 --> 00:56:25,020
<i>Yeah, OK.</i>

409
00:56:26,613 --> 00:56:29,283
<i>If it's a problem, I'll understand.</i>

410
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:32,035
No, no.
It's not a problem.

411
00:56:32,203 --> 00:56:33,531
I'd like to.

412
00:56:34,232 --> 00:56:35,532
Thanks.

413
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:39,955
The school's on Hudson,
just off High Point Avenue.

414
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:43,662
You take the 88 bus here
in tunnel A to the 23rd street,

415
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,548
then you change for the 85.

416
00:56:45,717 --> 00:56:47,424
<i>Just ask the driver to let you off.</i>

417
00:56:47,593 --> 00:56:50,962
<i>The stop's just 3 blocks from the school.
Kira knows.</i>

418
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:53,509
At 4 o'clock?

419
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:54,963
<i>Yeah. Is it clear?</i>

420
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:56,656
Yeah. It's fine.

421
00:56:56,936 --> 00:56:59,308
If there's an emergency
or anything else,

422
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,971
just leave a message
at the front desk,

423
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:03,692
and I'll just keep checking in.

424
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:12,234
Here's the key to our room.

425
00:57:13,703 --> 00:57:15,529
I can't thank you enough.

426
00:57:16,497 --> 00:57:19,830
We'll have fun,
we'll have a good time.

427
00:57:19,852 --> 00:57:23,161
<i>Thanks.
I should be getting back.</i>

428
00:57:23,337 --> 00:57:25,710
Do you wanna stay for a few minutes?

429
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:29,801
I can't.

430
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:31,886
I gotta go.

431
00:57:35,474 --> 00:57:36,637
<i>Good night.</i>

432
00:57:37,938 --> 00:57:39,038
<i>Thank you.</i>

433
00:58:16,348 --> 00:58:17,724
Sorry I'm late.

434
00:58:18,226 --> 00:58:20,221
How are you doing?

435
00:58:21,271 --> 00:58:22,599
Are you ready?

436
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:28,019
Your mom talked to you, right?
So you know that I'm picking you up.

437
00:58:30,321 --> 00:58:31,400
What?

438
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:32,651
Nothing.

439
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:36,552
OK, here we go.

440
00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:49,667
Put it in here.

441
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:09,394
How was at school?

442
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,730
It was OK.

443
00:59:13,573 --> 00:59:17,939
Your mom told me you've only been
going here a couple of weeks.

444
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:20,323
Do you like it?

445
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,160
It's OK.

446
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,575
<i>Have you made any friends yet?</i>

447
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:30,253
I made friends with
this girl named Alyssa.

448
00:59:30,631 --> 00:59:32,624
She was nice at first.

449
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,837
But now she's become
a kind of mean.

450
00:59:36,012 --> 00:59:38,837
So I don't really like her
<i>any more.</i></i>

451
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:40,349
What happened?

452
00:59:41,517 --> 00:59:45,467
She kept saying that I was stupid,
and then she said she was only kidding.

453
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:48,433
But she kept doing this,
she's not really sorry.

454
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:51,395
Do you believe her when she
says you're stupid?

455
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:53,066
Sometimes.

456
00:59:53,238 --> 00:59:54,648
<i>Well, don't.</i>

457
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:57,814
You're very smart, I can tell.

458
00:59:58,201 --> 01:00:01,617
Don't listen to people when
they're mean or put you down.

459
01:00:02,122 --> 01:00:03,865
Try to ignore 'em.

460
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:06,208
<i>Can you do that?</i>

461
01:00:08,086 --> 01:00:09,544
Yeah, I'll try.

462
01:00:09,545 --> 01:00:10,745
Good.

463
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:15,381
Those people aren't your friends.

464
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:41,576
Are you gonna be my mommy's
new boyfriend?

465
01:00:45,582 --> 01:00:46,910
I don't know.

466
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,323
Do you want me to?

467
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,295
<i>I don't know.</i>

468
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:55,999
Do you miss your father?

469
01:00:56,926 --> 01:00:58,301
I guess so.

470
01:00:58,928 --> 01:01:01,134
<i>When was the last time
you spoke to him?</i>

471
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:04,724
I don't know,
a while ago.

472
01:01:05,268 --> 01:01:06,975
Can I have an ice-cream?

473
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:08,722
When you're finished.

474
01:01:08,897 --> 01:01:10,272
<i>I finished.</i>

475
01:01:12,275 --> 01:01:14,516
Eat your food. Here.

476
01:01:15,946 --> 01:01:18,862
We'll buy you an ice-cream
when you're done. Deal?

477
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,194
What do you say?

478
01:01:22,368 --> 01:01:23,399
Deal.

479
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:42,087
I have to go to the bathroom.

480
01:01:43,223 --> 01:01:46,176
I'll be right back.
Will you be all right by yourself?

481
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,352
- Yeah.
- <i>Are you sure?</i></i>

482
01:01:49,812 --> 01:01:52,185
It'll just be a couple
of minutes. OK?

483
01:03:00,049 --> 01:03:02,291
How many seconds
in a minute?

484
01:03:02,552 --> 01:03:03,797
Sixty.

485
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:08,507
How many minutes
in an hour?

486
01:03:08,683 --> 01:03:10,059
Sixty.

487
01:03:16,149 --> 01:03:19,352
And how many minutes
is this one hour fifteen?

488
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:21,733
You have 60 minutes in an hour.

489
01:03:21,904 --> 01:03:24,656
<i>60 minutes in an hour, so...</i>

490
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:44,510
I don't know.

491
01:03:45,345 --> 01:03:47,670
60 plus 10 is what?

492
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:49,965
<i>60 plus 10...</i>

493
01:03:51,351 --> 01:03:52,975
<i>70?</i>

494
01:03:54,562 --> 01:03:56,021
Add 5.

495
01:03:57,899 --> 01:03:58,765
75?

496
01:03:58,942 --> 01:04:01,140
Good.
There you go.

497
01:04:01,152 --> 01:04:02,481
Put it down.

498
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:12,948
Make sure
you do a good job.

499
01:04:13,122 --> 01:04:14,403
<i>I am.</i>

500
01:04:22,507 --> 01:04:25,259
<i>Look at my veins.</i>
Look here, can you see them?</i>

501
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:27,426
They're water veins.

502
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,301
Look at this one.
It's a really big one.

503
01:04:31,808 --> 01:04:35,556
Here. Let's put some conditioner.
Give me your hand.

504
01:04:38,857 --> 01:04:41,857
Here.
There you go.

505
01:04:45,697 --> 01:04:47,488
Make sure you get the back.

506
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:54,777
You got enough?

507
01:04:54,956 --> 01:04:56,119
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

508
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:07,927
You got a message.

509
01:05:15,768 --> 01:05:18,438
- Hey, when did she call?
- <i>A half an hour ago.</i></i>

510
01:05:18,605 --> 01:05:21,974
- She didn't leave a number.
- <i>Just what I wrote there.</i></i>

511
01:05:32,493 --> 01:05:33,905
<i>What is it?</i>

512
01:05:34,955 --> 01:05:36,497
<i>It's from your mom.</i>

513
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:41,199
Ah, she can't come back
until tomorrow.

514
01:05:41,377 --> 01:05:42,941
<i>Why not?</i>

515
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:44,748
She doesn't say.

516
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,414
She just says she needs
more time.

517
01:06:08,071 --> 01:06:11,155
- Is mommy coming back?
- Of course she is.

518
01:06:13,243 --> 01:06:14,867
How do you know?

519
01:06:15,703 --> 01:06:17,744
Because she loves you.

520
01:06:18,665 --> 01:06:21,951
And you know how you love her
and you wanna be with her?

521
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,420
Well, she feels the same way
about you.

522
01:06:30,302 --> 01:06:31,677
Don't worry.

523
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:35,428
Here. It's time to go to sleep.

524
01:06:35,932 --> 01:06:36,963
Get in the bed.

525
01:06:37,267 --> 01:06:38,677
Right now?

526
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:42,061
Did you brushed your teeth?

527
01:06:48,662 --> 01:06:50,262
There.

528
01:06:52,616 --> 01:06:54,240
Are you comfy?

529
01:06:57,162 --> 01:06:58,442
What is it?

530
01:06:58,788 --> 01:07:02,471
I miss my daddy.
Why did he have to go?

531
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:06,125
<i>I don't know.
Sometimes, things don't work out.</i>

532
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:14,631
Things will be better soon.
Try to get some sleep.

533
01:07:14,805 --> 01:07:17,093
- <i>I can't.</i>
- Yes, you can.</i>

534
01:07:17,135 --> 01:07:21,894
Come on.
Here. Close your eyes.

535
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:26,814
Try to sleep.

536
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:30,898
I'm sitting right here beside you.

537
01:07:40,164 --> 01:07:43,164
Go to sleep.
Close your eyes.

538
01:07:57,848 --> 01:08:01,631
Hey, come on. Close your eyes.
Roll over on your side.

539
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:03,803
Try to get some sleep.

540
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,582
- Good night.
- Good night.

541
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,572
Are you excited?

542
01:08:58,074 --> 01:08:59,355
Yeah, me too.

543
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:02,359
I haven't scated
in a long time.

544
01:09:07,459 --> 01:09:08,870
Are you nervous?

545
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,419
A little bit.

546
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:14,247
You just hang on to me, OK?

547
01:09:28,605 --> 01:09:30,100
Are you having fun?

548
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:31,472
A lot.

549
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:34,561
I think you're a natural.

550
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:45,235
False!

551
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:56,018
- You've done this before, right?
- No.

552
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,664
I can tell
you've done this before.

553
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:01,335
You're too good.
Is this for the first time?

554
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,397
Want to try your own?

555
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:20,441
That's good.
You're on your own.

556
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:21,861
I'm doing it!

557
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:23,777
You're doing it!
It's true, you are.

558
01:10:36,507 --> 01:10:37,787
Roll.

559
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:40,170
A little harder.

560
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,383
Good, good. 10!
10 is good.

561
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:54,143
<i>Like bowling,</i>
remember?</i>

562
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:55,596
<i>Roll it up.</i>

563
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,575
- OK, keep playing.
- <i>OK.</i></i>

564
01:11:32,438 --> 01:11:33,552
What?

565
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:44,611
What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.

566
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:48,574
Don't look at me!

567
01:12:15,273 --> 01:12:16,683
Stop it.

568
01:12:17,973 --> 01:12:19,383
Please.

569
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,071
Are you OK?

570
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,369
I'm not feeling well.

571
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:34,660
It's OK.

572
01:12:39,713 --> 01:12:40,993
I'm sorry.

573
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:05,981
Are you gonna be OK?

574
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:13,318
I think so.

575
01:13:13,747 --> 01:13:15,289
I'll be fine.

576
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:50,528
Come on, give me your arm, sweetie.

577
01:14:12,472 --> 01:14:14,015
Lie down.

578
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:42,413
Sorry I couldn't get back
last night.

579
01:14:46,257 --> 01:14:47,371
Where were you?

580
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,459
How long she'd been sleeping?

581
01:14:49,635 --> 01:14:50,750
About an hour or so.

582
01:14:50,928 --> 01:14:52,886
<i>Did everything go OK?</i>

583
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:55,798
Yeah, everything's fine.

584
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:08,235
Mommy, you're back.

585
01:15:08,529 --> 01:15:10,107
Go back to sleep.

586
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:13,980
Where were you?

587
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,485
<i>I went to see Kira's father.</i>

588
01:15:16,662 --> 01:15:19,236
<i>You want some water?</i>
I'm gonna get some.</i>

589
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:27,161
You didn't have
to do the dishes.

590
01:15:37,808 --> 01:15:39,800
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

591
01:15:41,229 --> 01:15:42,853
What's going on?

592
01:15:43,314 --> 01:15:45,887
We're gonna move.
Eric found us a place.

593
01:15:46,067 --> 01:15:47,347
When are you going?

594
01:15:47,526 --> 01:15:51,654
<i>Soon as I get my paycheck.
Sunday, Monday at the latest.</i>

595
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:58,528
I'll pay you back as much as I can and
I'll send you the rest in a couple of weeks.

596
01:16:01,707 --> 01:16:04,115
Thanks for taking
care of Kira.

597
01:16:06,754 --> 01:16:08,462
So that's it?

598
01:16:54,928 --> 01:16:57,548
I'd like to see you
before you leave.

599
01:16:57,721 --> 01:17:00,343
<i>Come by tomorrow, after school.</i>

600
01:18:01,452 --> 01:18:03,907
My name is William Keane.

601
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:06,404
Keane.

602
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,585
K-E-A-N-E.

603
01:18:13,423 --> 01:18:16,127
I was born February 6, 1970,

604
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:20,927
at Yonkers General Hospital,
Yonkers, New York.

605
01:18:24,308 --> 01:18:27,144
My father's name
is Henry Keane.

606
01:18:29,063 --> 01:18:32,230
My mother was born Mary Conlan.

607
01:18:33,401 --> 01:18:34,894
She's dead.

608
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:38,485
I have one brother,

609
01:18:38,656 --> 01:18:41,408
a half-brother, Robert Keane.

610
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:50,495
I was married to Ann Etkin
on August 16th, 1996,

611
01:18:51,085 --> 01:18:53,576
and divorced 2 years later,

612
01:18:53,755 --> 01:18:56,874
August 17th, 1998.

613
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:05,464
We had one child.

614
01:19:06,559 --> 01:19:07,804
A girl.

615
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:26,800
You've got to get out of here!

616
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:29,196
There's nothing good here.

617
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:48,974
Hey, Kira!
Come here!

618
01:19:56,067 --> 01:19:57,940
What are you doing here?

619
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:01,894
I came to get you.
You're leaving, you're going up to Albany.

620
01:20:02,072 --> 01:20:04,315
- <i>Right now?</i>
- Yeah, right now.</i>

621
01:20:04,492 --> 01:20:06,069
Really? Where's Mommy?

622
01:20:06,243 --> 01:20:09,161
Mommy had to go by work
and get her paycheck.

623
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:12,082
She's gonna meet us
at the station.

624
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:15,574
So let's go and try
to find a cab, huh?

625
01:20:16,754 --> 01:20:18,912
I'm taking you.
Where are your things?

626
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:21,332
Over there.
I'll go get 'em.

627
01:20:21,509 --> 01:20:23,667
I'll meet you over at the front entrance.

628
01:20:23,844 --> 01:20:24,876
You hear me?

629
01:20:42,614 --> 01:20:44,072
Keep the change.

630
01:20:52,608 --> 01:20:55,620
Here, put this on.

631
01:20:59,506 --> 01:21:01,712
Here, take my hand.

632
01:21:01,883 --> 01:21:04,800
I want you to stay right beside me.
Do you understand?

633
01:21:22,362 --> 01:21:23,737
Ticket counters...

634
01:21:25,824 --> 01:21:27,781
Are you excited?

635
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:38,202
Stand right here.

636
01:21:39,629 --> 01:21:44,090
We're gonna take a bus to Clifton. We got
to change, take the second one to Albany.

637
01:21:44,676 --> 01:21:47,131
They don't have a bus that goes
all the way through.

638
01:21:56,688 --> 01:21:58,727
One adult and a child to Clifton.

639
01:21:58,898 --> 01:22:01,520
- <i>One way or round trip?</i>
- One way.</i>

640
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:04,689
<i>5.20.</i>

641
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,358
Out of 20.

642
01:22:08,783 --> 01:22:10,361
Did you get one for mommy?

643
01:22:10,535 --> 01:22:13,469
- She already has her ticket.
- When did she get it?

644
01:22:13,538 --> 01:22:17,999
Kira, let me handle this, OK? Don't worry,
your mom's gonna have her ticket.

645
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:21,375
<i>14.80 to change.</i>

646
01:22:24,476 --> 01:22:26,476
- Thanks.
- <i>You're welcome.</i></i>

647
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:27,968
The bus leaves at 4:45?

648
01:22:28,136 --> 01:22:30,128
<i>Yeah.
4:45, gate 21.</i>

649
01:22:31,139 --> 01:22:33,381
Your mom and I agreed to get
our own ticket

650
01:22:33,558 --> 01:22:36,049
in case she got here before us.

651
01:22:36,228 --> 01:22:38,835
That way we don't have too many tickets.

652
01:22:41,774 --> 01:22:43,932
I wasn't forgetting your mom.

653
01:22:52,326 --> 01:22:55,328
We still have some time.
You wanna go look around?

654
01:22:55,496 --> 01:22:58,269
- Yeah, you mean look at the stores?
- Sure.

655
01:22:58,341 --> 01:23:00,386
- Really?
- Yeah, c'mon, c'mon.

656
01:23:09,343 --> 01:23:11,835
I like that one,
can you see it?

657
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:13,254
Which one?

658
01:23:13,431 --> 01:23:16,681
<i>The one with brown eyes
and the Dalmatian.</i>

659
01:23:16,851 --> 01:23:18,594
They're both cute.

660
01:24:16,411 --> 01:24:17,905
We gotta go.

661
01:24:18,246 --> 01:24:20,820
We should go, come on.
We got to get going.

662
01:24:23,376 --> 01:24:26,035
It's just over here,
this way.

663
01:24:31,384 --> 01:24:33,626
You're a good girl,
you know that?

664
01:24:33,804 --> 01:24:36,648
- I am?
- Yeah.

665
01:24:41,936 --> 01:24:43,728
Wait here.
Wait, wait.

666
01:24:44,105 --> 01:24:45,932
Is my mom here?

667
01:24:56,284 --> 01:24:57,909
I don't see her.

668
01:25:11,507 --> 01:25:13,963
Wanna get a candy bar for the ride?

669
01:25:14,135 --> 01:25:16,044
Here, get two.

670
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,217
Two?

671
01:25:17,431 --> 01:25:20,217
I'm gonna call your mom
to see if she's left.

672
01:25:20,391 --> 01:25:23,143
Come back here
when you're done. OK?

673
01:25:25,188 --> 01:25:26,980
<i>Right back here,
gate 21.</i>

674
01:25:27,149 --> 01:25:28,477
I know.

675
01:26:43,099 --> 01:26:45,442
I'm sorry, Sophs.

676
01:26:49,231 --> 01:26:51,306
I'm so sorry.

677
01:27:23,766 --> 01:27:26,359
- <i>Are you OK?</i>
- Yeah.</i>

678
01:27:27,685 --> 01:27:29,394
Here, come here.

679
01:27:34,651 --> 01:27:36,524
Is my mommy coming?

680
01:27:39,364 --> 01:27:41,523
No, she hasn't left yet.

681
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,988
<i>4:45 to Clifton.</i>

682
01:27:44,619 --> 01:27:46,612
Have your tickets out please.

683
01:28:01,052 --> 01:28:02,843
Let's go and sit down.

684
01:28:21,532 --> 01:28:24,615
We're gonna go back and meet
your mom at the restaurant.

685
01:28:24,785 --> 01:28:28,583
- We are?
- <i>Yeah.</i></i>

686
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:34,410
Why are you crying?

687
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:37,201
<i>Don't cry.</i>

688
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:49,308
It's OK.

689
01:28:49,559 --> 01:28:50,935
I love you.

690
01:28:57,484 --> 01:28:59,275
I love you too.
