00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:47,828
My Lord

3
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,831
How dare you...
can't you see I am busy?

4
00:32:51,843 --> 00:32:54,835
The devine staff of legend...

5
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:57,838
It was seen in the Middle Kingdom...

6
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:58,838
Impossible.

7
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:03,844
The villagers are beginning to
whisper of prophecy...

8
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:08,849
Mortals are always whispering of prophecy.

9
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:11,852
It's their opium.

10
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:19,860
What other offending news
do you have for me?

11
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:23,864
That is all, My Lord.

12
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:35,876
Summon the Witch...
The one born of wolves.

13
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:47,888
Where were we?

14
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:19,399
He's not even Chinese.

15
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,402
We are all the same inside,
Aren't we Monk?

16
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:23,402
Heaven help us.

17
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:27,407
What, you find it a sin?

18
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:30,410
Yes, it is sinful not to share.

19
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:32,411
Cheers!

20
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:28,468
An old man and a boy,
They had tea here, Yes?

21
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:31,471
A Soldier Monk rides with them
Who else?

22
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:34,474
I do not know
who you speak of...

23
00:43:51,502 --> 00:43:53,493
Men are such liars.

24
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:08,507
Sparrow...

25
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,509
Sparrow...

26
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:14,514
...where do you nest?

27
00:51:24,955 --> 00:51:25,944
It is them.

28
00:51:25,956 --> 00:51:27,947
They're headed towards the desert.

29
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:31,951
They are between me and the River of Sand.

30
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:34,954
Isn't it just like King Monkey...

31
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:38,958
...summoning a boy to do a man's job?

32
