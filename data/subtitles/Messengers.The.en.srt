1
00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:04,857
<i>In the beginning,</i>
<i>a star fell from heaven</i>

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,256
<i>and changed us.</i>

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,099
<i>Made us angels and
gave us a new destiny:</i>

4
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:12,830
<i>to stop the Apocalypse</i>

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,746
<i>and the Devil himself.</i>

6
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,483
<i>We must pass God's test</i>

7
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>and prove humanity</i>
<i>is still worth saving.</i>

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,092
<i>For we are the Messengers.</i>

9
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,704
<i>Previously on</i> The Messengers...

10
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:29,504
I've collaborated

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,271
with the Horsemen in the past.

12
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:33,432
<i>War, Pestilence, Famine,</i>

13
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,453
<i>and Rose is the Horseman of Death.</i>

14
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:38,158
- So, why are you telling us this just now?
- The Apocalypse

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,835
is good for the Horsemen,
but very bad for you and me.

16
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:43,411
They want to break all the
seals and bring about the Rapture

17
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:46,680
and the end of humanity. I don't.

18
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:48,116
I'd be bored to death.

19
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:50,189
How are we supposed to
know who the Antichrist is?

20
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:51,828
The Antichrist will lead
you to the Lake of Fire.

21
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,328
What to see my drawing?

22
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,063
That's the Lake of Fire.

23
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:56,064
My God.

24
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:58,067
Michael. Michael.

25
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,036
He's alive.

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,039
<i>How am I even</i>

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,039
supposed to be sure

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,206
that you have my son?

29
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,406
- Mom!
- Sweetie. Give me back my daughter.

30
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:05,608
You lost the right to call her that

31
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,548
when you dragged her
halfway across the country.

32
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:08,984
Stay away from her!

33
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,052
<i>They're probably gonna use</i>

34
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:11,120
<i>the Genesis element</i>
<i>as some sort</i>

35
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:12,221
<i>of weapon to break the Fifth Seal.</i>

36
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:14,825
This element in the right
hands... our hands...

37
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:16,897
it could be a force for good, I know it.

38
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,665
<i>When I was distilling it,</i>

39
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:21,334
<i>I felt this rush of positive energy.</i>

40
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:24,337
<i>Just being near it healed</i>
<i>a wound that was on my wrist.</i>

41
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,942
<i>It's the perfect weapon.</i>

42
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:27,814
<i>Rest assured,</i>

43
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:29,817
the Fifth Seal will bring death

44
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,388
like the world has never seen before.

45
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:56,894
<i>After all this time,</i>

46
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,997
after all we've been through.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,867
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

48
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:03,403
We're almost done.

49
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,171
I always hated the city.

50
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:07,578
Then it'll be nice to wipe one off the map.

51
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:11,183
We have three more seals
to break before the Rapture.

52
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:14,057
We cannot fail the prophecy.

53
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,860
Who said anything about failing?

54
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:21,733
Never underestimate the Messengers.

55
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,401
All right, we know the
Horsemen have already

56
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:26,569
broken the first four seals.

57
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,772
From this point forward,

58
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,710
they'll be working together
to break all the rest.

59
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:30,776
And the Fifth Seal

60
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:32,110
will be the worst one yet.

61
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:33,780
According to prophecy, it will be some kind

62
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,283
of violent act that will
begin a terrible period

63
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:36,418
of fear and tribulation.

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,586
Anybody care to translate for the new guy?

65
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,254
Secretary Richards,

66
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:43,127
the Horseman of War. We know she turned

67
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,629
the Genesis element into a deadly weapon.

68
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,998
And Mark Plowman,

69
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,401
the Horseman of Famine,

70
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:50,009
is gonna use his drones to deliver it.

71
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,344
Leland Schiller's the
Horseman of Pestilence.

72
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:52,447
And I bet he's gonna use

73
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:54,382
his hacking skills to make sure no one

74
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:55,985
can find out what he's up to.

75
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:56,986
And then there's Death.

76
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,090
The Horseman in charge of 'em all.

77
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:02,193
Okay, the thing is, now that
she's united with the others,

78
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:03,562
how do we even stop them?

79
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,264
It's not like we can kill a Horseman.

80
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:07,401
Remember who said that?

81
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:10,338
Rose. It's probably just
another one of her lies.

82
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:11,842
But we know from Eliza that

83
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,075
the Horsemen have definitely been stopped

84
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:14,510
from breaking their seals in the past.

85
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:15,643
So, what are we trying to stop?

86
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:17,242
You ask me,

87
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,177
based on what I know
about Plowman's drones,

88
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,377
they'll use the same technology

89
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,712
to launch an attack.

90
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,747
Instead of seeding the
clouds with Smart Rain,

91
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,549
they could release the Genesis element.

92
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,649
And pretty soon,

93
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:27,649
it'll be raining hellfire.

94
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:29,049
And everything it touches will

95
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,251
turn to dust, just like my vision.

96
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,954
How many drones are there?

97
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:33,557
According to my research, seven.

98
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:36,257
That's a hell of a lot of hellfire.

99
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,456
If we can figure out
where these drones are,

100
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,692
I might be able to get close enough

101
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:39,795
to neutralize the element...

102
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:40,963
you know, turn it from red to blue.

103
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,299
Maybe we'll even get a shot

104
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,100
at destroying the drones
altogether if we're lucky.

105
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:47,336
We're gonna need a lot more than luck.

106
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,942
You do this on purpose, don't you?

107
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:04,487
Mom! Mom!

108
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,535
The target is Houston.

109
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,807
So, they're gonna wipe out an entire city

110
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,610
and break the Fifth
Seal while they're at it.

111
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:23,978
It's because we're here. They want us dead.

112
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,779
I saw the airport... a radar screen,

113
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,314
seven objects moving across the sky.

114
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,781
- Drones.
- I saw someplace

115
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:31,716
called the Sunbowl Motel
burning to the ground.

116
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,084
Michael was there.

117
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,454
That's here in Houston.

118
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:39,189
He was calling out for you.

119
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:40,622
What? What? He's here?

120
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:42,322
There is something else.

121
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,463
I saw every last one of us dying.

122
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:53,148
1x13 - <i>Houston, We Have a Problem</i>

123
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,329
Tell me what I want to hear, Leland.

124
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:19,531
I'm only

125
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,201
one firewall away from being able

126
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:22,735
to remotely erase any object

127
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:25,035
we don't want air traffic control to see.

128
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:29,136
No one will know our drones are
in the sky until it's too late.

129
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:30,672
That's my boy.

130
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:32,872
Now, hurry up and come join us.

131
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,706
You don't want to miss out on all the fun.

132
00:05:34,707 --> 00:05:37,009
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

133
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:45,247
You ready to go?

134
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,581
Yeah.

135
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:49,052
Erin and I... we both really appreciate

136
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:50,620
you getting Amy out of town.

137
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:52,622
No big.

138
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:55,058
Where are you going?

139
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,461
We're gonna follow Joshua's
vision to the airport.

140
00:05:58,463 --> 00:05:59,965
We have to figure out a way

141
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:01,735
to stop these Horsemen
once and for all, Nadia.

142
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,637
I know.

143
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,271
But could you do me a big favor?

144
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:08,973
What's that?

145
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:12,545
Try not to die.

146
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:14,545
Oh, don't worry.

147
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:16,947
I always come back.

148
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,329
I love you, Dad.

149
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,269
I love you, too, sweet girl.

150
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,550
Want to know the best part
about getting your ribs broken?

151
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:43,584
Apparently, if you're a nice guy,

152
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:46,153
the hospital throws in a
six-pack and some pec implants

153
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:46,766
free of charge.

154
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:47,947
Alan...

155
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,389
I need your help.

156
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,624
What's wrong, V?

157
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,326
I need to get out of town. The Horsemen

158
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,896
are about to use the Genesis element

159
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,132
to launch an attack on Houston.

160
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,600
Well... if you're staying, I'm staying.

161
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:01,735
No.

162
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:04,403
Not if you care about me.

163
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:09,108
Look, I need you to...

164
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,507
I need you to go get Michael for me.

165
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,507
What? You...

166
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:14,709
You know where he is?

167
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:17,014
Yeah, I think so.
Joshua had another vision.

168
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:19,550
He's at a motel across town.

169
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,987
I'm just afraid that if I go get him

170
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,889
instead of trying to stop the Horsemen...

171
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:28,192
millions of people are
going to lose their lives,

172
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,762
and I'm gonna lose my little boy for good.

173
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,101
You really are an angel, you know that?

174
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:39,139
: Just promise
me you'll get Michael out of town?

175
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,808
Just tell me where he is.

176
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,110
All right.

177
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:45,778
There's one more stop I
need you to make on the way.

178
00:07:57,387 --> 00:08:00,057
<i>How could you just let him go?</i>

179
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,728
Because he's not our son, and you know it.

180
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,764
It's bad enough the Devil
turned us into kidnappers,

181
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:08,466
but now we're-we're killers.

182
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,701
I held the bag over that woman's head, Kay.

183
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't need to be reminded.

184
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:14,336
Baby, listen to me.

185
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:17,838
Now, you know there is no end

186
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:20,406
to what the Devil will try to make us do.

187
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:24,081
He will never stop coming after us.

188
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:26,050
I can't live like that anymore.

189
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:27,651
What do you want me to do?

190
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:29,254
Kay, I've been all over Houston, damn it.

191
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,322
Every single address listing
I can find for Vera Buckley.

192
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:32,924
I can't find her anywhere.

193
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:35,963
Keep looking. If we're gonna
burn in hell, at least we can

194
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,931
go on our own terms.

195
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:41,302
We have to give Brian
back to his real mother.

196
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:53,744
Would you knock it off?

197
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:55,446
You're gonna get me killed.

198
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,815
You worry too much, Ronnie.

199
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:01,955
Just do what I told you to.

200
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,825
What did these people

201
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,192
do to you, anyway?

202
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:10,663
Outlived their usefulness.

203
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:16,501
Don't make the same mistake.

204
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,907
You promise me,

205
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:21,107
if I light this place up

206
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,710
and kill the Fairburns and their kid,

207
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:26,183
I'll get Erin and Amy back.

208
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:29,354
I swear to God.

209
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,961
Look, it doesn't matter who I am.

210
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:39,395
All I'm telling you is,
someone may be trying

211
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,130
to hack air traffic control
at Texas Metro Airport.

212
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,133
Check all your systems.

213
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,168
This is not a joke!

214
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:04,923
<i>If you want to save the
world from the Devil's dominion,</i>

215
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:09,330
you must kill the Antichrist.

216
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,193
Joshua.

217
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:38,861
Look. It's you and me.

218
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:43,735
I see that.

219
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:48,174
What are those?

220
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:49,677
Those are flying spiders,

221
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,711
but you're keeping me safe from them.

222
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,724
You always keep me safe.

223
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,158
Hey, sweetie.

224
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,360
Ready for a little adventure with Nadia?

225
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:05,995
Yeah.

226
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,899
Bye, Joshua.

227
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,236
Bye.

228
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,131
So let me get this straight:

229
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:37,604
the preacher has a vision
and you all just... follow it.

230
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:39,942
Along with the other
signs that God shows us.

231
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:42,644
Allah, for Muslims, I guess.

232
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:44,379
Sure, why not?

233
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:45,615
I mean, Koa's a Buddhist.

234
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:49,019
I'm Catholic, Joshua's evangelical.

235
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,053
Erin's Jewish, Peter's Presbyterian,

236
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:52,456
and Vera, well...

237
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:55,296
Vera believes we came from monkeys.

238
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,264
It's like my old man used to say...

239
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,831
we're all on our way to Disneyland,

240
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:02,364
we're just taking different
roads to get there.

241
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:04,932
Covered every back room and
security center in the entire

242
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,264
place. No sign of Schiller.

243
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:10,600
At least I didn't have
to take my shoes off.

244
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:12,504
You put the word out anyway?

245
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,871
Yeah. After Joshua's anonymous call,

246
00:12:14,874 --> 00:12:16,272
they were already on high alert.

247
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,005
Then I told them Schiller was on the FBI's

248
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:20,844
Most Wanted list. Might
be targeting the airport.

249
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:22,546
After what he did at Nero Health,

250
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:24,279
- I hope they take it seriously.
- They did a full

251
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:27,416
security sweep. If he's in this
airport, no one's found him.

252
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:28,783
Then where could he be?

253
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:30,219
<i>Maybe we can find</i>

254
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:33,456
Leland somewhere in the terminal.

255
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:35,328
Do you think Joshua's vision is true?

256
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:36,796
Are we really gonna die?

257
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,063
Scientifically speaking,
we're all gonna die someday.

258
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:43,105
But not today. We have too much work to do.

259
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:45,941
Sucks having to save the world.

260
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:49,243
Maybe when we get
done, you can take out Nadia.

261
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:51,447
And you can finally find your son.

262
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:55,389
I'll look around on this
level, you cover the next.

263
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:57,591
Cool.

264
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,205
Meow.

265
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,841
Vera Buckley, please
proceed to the nearest

266
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,375
white courtesy phone.

267
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,014
Vera Buckley to the white courtesy phone.

268
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:20,250
Who would be calling...?

269
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:21,784
Michael?

270
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:23,988
<i>Michael!</i>

271
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,261
I'm so sorry.

272
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:31,463
Don't be. There's nothing
you could have done.

273
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,332
Take my word for it.

274
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,168
Why did you take him from
me in the first place?

275
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:37,402
What makes him so special to you?

276
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:41,474
Did you ever think why
you named him Michael?

277
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:44,139
Is it a family name?

278
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:45,606
Has it always been a favorite

279
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:48,177
or did it just come to you?

280
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,677
You see, Vera, every

281
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:55,851
generation of Messengers has
a Michael somewhere among them.

282
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:59,352
Your son is an archangel.

283
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:01,688
What's that supposed to mean?

284
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:02,822
What do I look like,

285
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,658
a theology professor? Read a Bible.

286
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,658
In the meantime, know this:

287
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:09,865
- you're not getting him back.
- He belongs to me.

288
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:10,764
I know how you feel.

289
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,032
No, you can't imagine how I feel.

290
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,600
Believe me, I do.

291
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,937
'Cause now I have a child of my own.

292
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,405
That's right.

293
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:22,878
For the very first time in my long,

294
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,081
miserable life,

295
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,754
the Antichrist has finally arrived.

296
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:32,154
A messiah of my very own.

297
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:34,626
Someone I can watch over.

298
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:36,130
Just like God

299
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:38,201
watches over you.

300
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,409
What is that?

301
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:47,812
The GPS coordinates for
the Horsemen's launch site.

302
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:49,977
I strongly suggest you
get the hell out of here

303
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,948
and stop those drones,
Vera, because if you don't...

304
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:56,086
you're gonna have a whole
lot of blood on your hands.

305
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:23,036
Okay, Professor.

306
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,407
You want the good news or the bad news?

307
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:30,243
Let's get the bad out of the way.

308
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:31,678
You're not going home.

309
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,951
Vera asked me to come get you,

310
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:36,453
so you're gonna have to leave
your car here; I'm driving.

311
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,692
Okay, then...

312
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:42,328
where are we going, and-and
why didn't she call me herself?

313
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,932
Well, hopefully, that's the good news.

314
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,634
It's about Michael.

315
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:52,673
Car's loaded and ready to go.

316
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:54,072
Thank you.

317
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:55,875
Did you put your crayons in your backpack?

318
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,210
Yup. I expect

319
00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:59,581
a lot of drawings when you come back, okay?

320
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:01,149
Why can't you come?

321
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:03,452
I really want to.

322
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:06,318
I just... I have something
important that I need to do.

323
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:07,552
Angel stuff?

324
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:11,256
Yeah. Angel stuff.

325
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:16,562
I love you so much and I'm
gonna see you soon, okay?

326
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:19,830
- Love you, too, Mom.
- Okay, come here.

327
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:26,240
Be good for Nadia, okay?

328
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:33,890
- You're gonna go join the others?
- Yeah.

329
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:38,057
Well, we'll call you when we get to Tulsa.

330
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:40,260
My mom said we could stay
there as long as we need.

331
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:41,965
Thanks, Nadia.

332
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:43,735
You're a godsend.

333
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,739
Coming from you,

334
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,441
that's pretty high praise.

335
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,677
Thanks.

336
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,623
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:03,664
How touching.

338
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,567
But you know what they say:

339
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:08,840
the family that cries
together dies together.

340
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:20,422
They sure circled
the wagons on this one.

341
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,990
But I can definitely

342
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,759
see why. I'm counting

343
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,426
all seven drones.

344
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,295
And at least 20 mercenaries.

345
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,231
They probably don't even
know what they're defending.

346
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:34,035
How do we get past them
to disable the drones?

347
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,868
Maybe you can shape-shift
into one of the guards.

348
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:37,936
Get me down close enough to
where I can spirit-walk in

349
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:39,404
to figure out how they're
launching those things.

350
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:42,609
Yeah. Then we can have you blow the

351
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,244
power so the drones can't take off.

352
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:45,712
Great idea.

353
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:50,054
But I'm gonna have to pass.

354
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:57,733
Hang on.

355
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,674
Excuse me.

356
00:18:03,676 --> 00:18:04,976
Coming through!

357
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:06,910
Damn it, Alan, where's the fire?

358
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:09,045
Right here if we don't
get the hell out of this town.

359
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,048
- You said this was about Michael.
- It is.

360
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,617
Seeing as how Vera's his mother,

361
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,022
and she wants us both alive
long enough to find him.

362
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,359
What's that supposed to mean?

363
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,464
Well, your ex has got a whole
lot on her plate right now.

364
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:22,066
Believe me, I'm still trying to
wrap my head around half of it.

365
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,903
But I can tell you this much.

366
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,207
I think you guys are this
close to finding your kid.

367
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:27,807
How do you know?

368
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,208
'Cause I was with her in Albuquerque

369
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,442
a couple of days ago,

370
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,143
when we found the home
of Michael's kidnappers.

371
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,176
It was obviously left in a hurry.

372
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,677
That means they're on the run,

373
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,814
and sooner or later, they're gonna slip up.

374
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,115
You must be pretty important to Vera

375
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:42,885
if she's got you involved in all this.

376
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,624
Tell you the God's honest truth,

377
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,990
I think I'm in love with her.

378
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:59,132
Are you kidding me?

379
00:18:59,134 --> 00:18:59,979
Now?!

380
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,778
Welcome to Houston.

381
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:04,134
I always said I'd probably die in traffic.

382
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:08,439
Be careful what you wish for.

383
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:24,284
Zahir Zakaria.

384
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:25,821
Good to see you.

385
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:29,996
What? One dry desert wasteland
wasn't enough for you?

386
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:31,663
Do you know how many innocent people

387
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:33,131
you and your brother killed

388
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,965
with your so-called Smart Rain in Mali?

389
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,166
Good people.

390
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:38,536
<i>My</i> people.

391
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:40,605
I know.

392
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:42,307
And I felt bad about it, I did,

393
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:45,211
but honestly, it's small potatoes now.

394
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:46,612
Yeah.

395
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:50,381
My eyes have been opened
to a far greater purpose.

396
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:52,249
So have mine.

397
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,354
Look out!

398
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,332
I'm going to kill that son of a bitch!

399
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,700
Zahir, no!

400
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,537
Go, we got him! Go.

401
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,539
You okay?

402
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,374
- Leave me.
- Sorry.

403
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,711
We leave no Messenger behind. Come on.

404
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:44,938
You thinking what I'm thinking?

405
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,210
Hell, yes.

406
00:20:58,054 --> 00:21:00,789
Leland, the Messengers are here.

407
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,160
Just keep them

408
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:04,261
away from the drones and
out of this command tent,

409
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,262
and we won't have any problems.

410
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,396
And tell Rose

411
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:08,664
that we're good to go.

412
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,665
Go where?

413
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,767
Back home to your mother?

414
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,767
Remember me?

415
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:20,336
I should have done this a long time ago.

416
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:23,103
Yeah.

417
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:25,205
I suppose you should have.

418
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:29,546
Stay close.

419
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:34,951
Freeze!

420
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:36,619
Sorry, boys.

421
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:38,922
That's the end of the road.

422
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:54,874
Step away from the drones, Vera.

423
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:57,377
Don't worry about us.

424
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:04,986
I'm-I'm sorry. I can't.

425
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:06,487
Of course not.

426
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,153
Aren't you an angel?

427
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:10,788
Move it. Let's go.

428
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:13,090
Everybody down!

429
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:14,460
On your knees!

430
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:16,594
It's so nice to see you all again.

431
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:19,061
It's a shame we don't
have time to catch up,

432
00:22:19,064 --> 00:22:20,931
but... we've got a Fifth Seal

433
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,263
to break.

434
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:23,365
If I could just interject

435
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:25,464
for a moment. I know

436
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,433
how God works.

437
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:28,601
He loves to give humans

438
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:30,201
all the tools they need

439
00:22:30,202 --> 00:22:32,567
for their salvation and destruction.

440
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:34,202
That's clearly what he did

441
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:35,838
with the meteor he cast me down in.

442
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,106
I'll be the first to admit,
the whole Genesis element,

443
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,106
I didn't see it coming.

444
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:43,609
But you're just like me in that respect.

445
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,910
If you think God's gonna
reward you for blindly following

446
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:49,613
the prophecy and launching those weapons,

447
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:53,117
you're about to fail
the biggest test of all.

448
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,653
You dare speak to me of failure?

449
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,672
It's like I've always said,

450
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,138
we're stronger than you.

451
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:24,277
Go for launch.

452
00:23:49,902 --> 00:23:52,402
Rose.

453
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:54,805
Please don't do this.

454
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:58,573
See?

455
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:01,640
That's the problem with mankind.

456
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:04,776
You always think everything's
being done <i>to</i> you.

457
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:08,178
You never hold yourselves accountable.

458
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,246
My son's been taken.

459
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:13,717
My husband's abusive.

460
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,217
My father was murdered.

461
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,421
My parents abandoned me.

462
00:24:20,722 --> 00:24:22,756
My brother was killed.

463
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:26,290
My village was destroyed.

464
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:30,026
My daddy screwed my whore of a wife.

465
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,060
You're all weak.

466
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:35,261
You always have been.

467
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:38,932
And that is why it is
finally time for you to die.

468
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:40,601
Humanity deserves

469
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:42,739
everything that's coming to it.

470
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:45,640
They've reached

471
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:47,607
the cloud barrier.

472
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:51,078
Then release the Genesis element.

473
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,997
We're almost there.

474
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,420
Come on, come on, come on.

475
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,992
Why are people leaving their cars?

476
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:33,499
They're just trying
to stretch their legs.

477
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,902
I have never seen anything like this.

478
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:38,337
Neither have I.

479
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,019
Look, Professor, we gotta get out of here.

480
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,978
It's too late.

481
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:07,342
Looks like there's a fire up ahead.

482
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,575
Brother, you have no idea.

483
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:17,951
Where's my mom?

484
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,720
I... I don't know, sweetie.

485
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:22,892
But... don't worry,
we're just gonna stay put.

486
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:28,928
You're wrong about us.

487
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:33,599
We're not weak.

488
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:39,740
And we fought to stop you at every turn.

489
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:44,611
And we don't live in the past anymore.

490
00:26:44,613 --> 00:26:46,279
So if the future's too late to save,

491
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:48,849
let me tell you this much right now.

492
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,652
It was all worth it.

493
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:56,855
My faith has been restored.

494
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:00,657
In God.

495
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:05,460
In myself.

496
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:09,529
And in every last one of these people.

497
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:14,336
Now...

498
00:27:14,337 --> 00:27:16,005
if it's the last thing we do,

499
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:17,875
we're gonna pray.

500
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,315
Really? We're just gonna pray?

501
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,017
No.

502
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,419
Listen to me.

503
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:26,520
We can still do this.

504
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:28,258
How? The drones have already launched.

505
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:30,960
There's a generator by the command tent.

506
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:32,594
If we can get Zahir
close enough to kill it,

507
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:33,596
we would stop the drones

508
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:35,266
from doing their job.

509
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:37,188
But there's about 50 guns
between here and there.

510
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:41,202
We have to be a human shield.

511
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,807
It's the only way.

512
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:51,907
For ourselves,

513
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,242
for each other

514
00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:56,743
and for everyone we love.

515
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:59,346
You really think that God is watching us?

516
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,250
I know He is.

517
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,720
Then I'm in.

518
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:12,989
Me, too.

519
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,557
Yes.

520
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:15,557
Let's do it.

521
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:18,926
I can't think of a better reason to die.

522
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:24,965
Fire!

523
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,794
I knew you were watching.

524
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:36,298
Does this mean we're not going to Tulsa?

525
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,298
Yeah.

526
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:47,773
Thank you.

527
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,552
Oh, God.

528
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,262
I'm so sorry for...

529
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:04,463
for everything I've done.

530
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,755
What do I do now, V?

531
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:28,960
Please tell me you did it.

532
00:31:32,865 --> 00:31:36,036
Alan?

533
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:40,442
I can feel my legs.

534
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:43,650
I can walk.

535
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:53,296
My God.

536
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:42,982
We did it.

537
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:45,386
Thank God.

538
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:47,057
We finally beat the Horsemen.

539
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:25,230
It's over.

540
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:26,932
No.

541
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:29,432
It's just beginning.

542
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:56,096
Alan. Alan, te-te-tell me you're okay.

543
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:07,835
_

544
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,434
_

545
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:22,476
Leo?

546
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,679
Wait. How...

547
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:27,447
It's a miracle.

548
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,954
But that's not all.

549
00:34:30,956 --> 00:34:32,858
Vera...

550
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,726
there's someone you need to meet.

551
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:46,302
I'll be right back.

552
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,411
Hi, sweetie.

553
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,481
Look,

554
00:34:57,483 --> 00:35:01,318
I know you don't know me,

555
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,956
but I promise I know you.

556
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:09,360
: I've been looking for you

557
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:13,030
for a very long time.

558
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:26,407
Slow down, silly.

559
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:28,476
Don't drink it all in one sip.

560
00:35:30,014 --> 00:35:31,481
Want to play on the patio?

561
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:32,849
Is that okay?

562
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:35,184
Of course you can. Now go have fun.

563
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:38,887
How's he doing?

564
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:41,657
Remarkably well

565
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:44,331
for a kid who's been through what he has.

566
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,036
We've been, uh, seeing a therapist.

567
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:50,204
It's gonna be a journey.

568
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,072
It'll take some time.

569
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:55,476
Probably a few more Shirley Temples.

570
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,211
And how about you?

571
00:35:58,213 --> 00:36:00,211
To be honest...

572
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:03,918
I'm happier than I've ever been.

573
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,523
You know, I can see in the reflection

574
00:36:11,525 --> 00:36:12,960
that you're staring at me.

575
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,827
You're just gonna keep doing it?

576
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:18,998
If you're lucky.

577
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:27,003
What about cell phones?

578
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:30,005
Bet you don't even need a charger, do you?

579
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,476
No way. That is so cool.

580
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:37,380
No matter how many times

581
00:36:37,382 --> 00:36:38,782
I read it, I just don't believe it.

582
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,451
Well, all that matters now
is that he turned himself in,

583
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:42,686
and we're done.

584
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:45,422
Maybe now you can move on.

585
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:47,760
Where?

586
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,396
Colorado.

587
00:36:49,398 --> 00:36:51,565
: What?

588
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,134
That's...

589
00:36:53,135 --> 00:36:56,137
Look, I know it's not Alaska,
but it's still beautiful.

590
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:59,338
And now that my record's clear,

591
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,777
there's a DEA branch in
Denver that I can transfer to.

592
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:06,244
You and Amy can come with me.

593
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:07,780
Nadia, too, if she wants.

594
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:11,588
We can find a house, you can
go back to work... if you want.

595
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,653
We can start a whole new life together.

596
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,628
Does that sound good?

597
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,981
No... No.

598
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:25,135
It sounds great.

599
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:34,539
Dude, you're stripes.

600
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,742
What are you talking about? I'm solids.

601
00:37:36,744 --> 00:37:39,179
Plus, you scratched.
Give me the damn cue ball.

602
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:41,516
You want to come get the damn cue ball?

603
00:37:41,518 --> 00:37:44,117
You do realize I can walk now, right?

604
00:37:45,155 --> 00:37:46,353
We can remedy that.

605
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:47,655
Fine. Keep the cue ball.

606
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:49,956
I'm really proud of everyone.

607
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,860
We gave it everything we had
and made the ultimate sacrifice

608
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,028
to stop another seal from breaking.

609
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,331
- Yeah, we kicked ass.
- You're right we did.

610
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:03,333
Guess the question is: what do we do next?

611
00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:05,603
Think I'm just gonna
focus on being a mother.

612
00:38:05,606 --> 00:38:08,974
Yeah... well, I'm not
telling you you shouldn't.

613
00:38:10,177 --> 00:38:11,943
God knows you've earned it, Vera.

614
00:38:11,945 --> 00:38:13,510
But?

615
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:16,246
But we still have our gifts.

616
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:18,782
So, what? Aren't they
supposed to just fade away?

617
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:21,518
Eliza said we won't lose them
till we were truly finished.

618
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,516
But the thing is...

619
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:27,353
is we're the seventh group of Messengers.

620
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:30,204
And I just can't shake this
feeling we still got work to do.

621
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:33,226
Look I...

622
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,630
I know you and I aren't very fond of him.

623
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:41,670
But when I was at the airport,

624
00:38:41,672 --> 00:38:44,472
the Devil told me something
I haven't been able to forget.

625
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:46,742
What did he say?

626
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,751
That Michael's an archangel.

627
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,356
I'm not saying that I believe him.

628
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:57,226
I don't, I don't even
know what that means...

629
00:38:57,228 --> 00:38:58,760
An archangel...

630
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:01,530
is a powerful warrior of God.

631
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:06,268
Maybe we still have our gifts
'cause we need to protect him.

632
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:09,034
Protect him from what?

633
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:10,769
The Antichrist.

634
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:17,677
The Antichrist is a
human cloaked in darkness

635
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,512
who can do things the Devil can't.

636
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:20,748
Like what exactly?

637
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,385
Destroy an archangel.

638
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:25,487
Now, look.

639
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,338
I might be wrong about this.

640
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:30,023
I sure as hell hope that I am.

641
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:37,197
But I think Amy is the Antichrist.

642
00:39:38,298 --> 00:39:39,831
What?

643
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,197
She showed me the Lake of Fire.

644
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,233
Now, that is written in prophecy...

645
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:45,434
This is crazy!

646
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:47,135
They're not demons.

647
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:50,239
They're not warriors.

648
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:52,074
They're kids.

649
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,152
High one!

650
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:03,519
So, I'm sorry.

651
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:07,894
But the prophecy has to be wrong.

652
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:16,472
Yeah.

653
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:19,974
Yeah, you're right.

654
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:22,679
God's been good to us.

655
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:25,351
Why would he stop now?

656
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:46,503
Here you go, my child.

657
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:48,438
Thank you, Father.
