1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,006
I think the biggest misconception about Break Dancers, or B-boys...

2
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:24,800
with people out here in the world is that,

3
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,222
They're not dancing.

4
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:29,823
That everything they're doing is just happening at the moment

5
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:33,424
and they don't know what they're doing
they're just doing it, they're just going crazy.

6
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:39,325
Breaking is a legitimate dance, as legitimate as any other dance that has existed.

7
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:42,926
Planet B-Boy

8
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,528
Break Dance does have a history
And a lot of heroes that no one is ever going to know

9
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:59,529
If you look at the socio-economic
situation in New York in the late 60s and early 70s

10
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:02,530
you could see how
something like Hip Hop could spawn itself

11
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:05,431
because there wasn't that much happening at all.

12
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:10,432
So, there's all this energy in a young person,
and then these elements of expression are around

13
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:12,133
and you want to draw to them.

14
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,133
Hip Hop is not Rap.

15
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:18,934
Hip Hop is a culture, that consists of 4 elements.

16
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:20,335
It's B- Boying,

17
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,336
DJ ing,

18
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:23,737
Mc ing,

19
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:25,338
and Graffiti writing.

20
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,539
What it did was that it gave an option,

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,740
in which each individual
chose on how to express themselves.

22
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,741
And that is the truest form of what Hip Hop is.

23
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:38,742
With Hip Hop
the rules were being made on the spot.

24
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:42,043
We can call a move whatever we want to call it on the spot.

25
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:46,644
Or an individual thats empowering
that's something that, wow, you definitely want to be a part of that.

26
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:50,745
B-Boy comes from the terminology, Beat-Boy.

27
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:54,346
Because we danced to a specific beat, to a record.

28
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:59,047
It's a gesture of a fight, without actually touching someone.

29
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:02,448
But with the same intensity of a battle of a gang.

30
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,149
The battle is what the B-Boy is about, he lives for that battle.

31
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,450
There's nothing else.

32
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:12,651
Other influences in B-Boying, Kung-Fu movies,

33
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:15,952
gymnastics,

34
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:21,753
and then the music with James Brown,
and certain steps that he did.

35
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:27,454
It was a mesh, to create
one specific dance.

36
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:31,955
The USA B-Boys, like in the early years,

37
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:33,556
were our heroes in Europe.

38
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:38,457
We tried to grab every little bit
of Rock Steady Crew, New York City Breakers

39
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:41,558
And they were our great heroes.

40
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,259
If I could describe Kenny in one sentence,

41
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,260
He's the last true B-Boy of his generation.

42
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:56,562
A lot of dances stay exactly the way they are.
They're not allowed to evolve, or use anything else.

43
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:59,563
Breaking its just unique,
the way that it's all put together.

44
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:01,064
It's like the ultimate dance.

45
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:03,165
Because you can take from everywhere.

46
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,566
But you just have to put,
B-Boy flava on whatever you took from.

47
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,567
In the late 70s, Bboying
basically branched out.

48
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:14,268
And that's what caught the media's attention.

49
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:27,068
The Culture of Hip Hop, visually,
was brought out to the masses, out to the world

50
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,069
Because of the movie Flashdance.

51
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,770
Because of Break Dancing.
Not because of a Rap record.

52
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,771
In Germany, Break Dancing came first.

53
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:38,072
And then of course with Break Dancing
came the music,

54
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:41,773
But, nobody was really interested in Rap Music at the time.

55
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:44,774
Everybody sees it and it becomes
really big.

56
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,975
And especially with young people,
they are going to try it right when they see it.

57
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:51,976
There was that famous scene

58
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:55,177
Showing backspin
and backsliding.

59
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:57,578
Moves I'd never seen before.

60
00:03:57,578 --> 00:04:02,279
It struck me like I'd been
hit over the head.

61
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,280
We only went to the movie, not to see
Jennifer Beals, not to see that love story

62
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,594
Everybody just went into the movies

63
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:11,600
to see Rock Steady dancing on the street.

64
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,541
When I saw that guy
spinning...

65
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,542
It was like destiny saying
"This is for you."

66
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:24,579
"You are the movement of life."

67
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:28,144
It is very personal and emotional
for me.

68
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:35,445
In the 80s what happened was,
it got exploited.

69
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:39,546
It was just... a quick fad.

70
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,700
These guys here,
they don't know what it's really about.

71
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,901
They don't understand that all of us
that we are much better than what these guys are doing,

72
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,572
and that they don't have a clue.

73
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:50,573
It was ugly
it got really bad.

74
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:55,774
And that was the end of it, you know,
to where they said, you know, we've sucked everything we can out of it

75
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:58,675
these last two years
and then we're done.

76
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:06,676
Germany 1990

77
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:11,477
<i> Something really interesting is happening in Hanover.</i>

78
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,358
<i>It's the first international Break Dance competition.</i>

79
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,059
<i>And we have the founder in the studio today.</i>

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,160
<i>Tell me, how did you come up with this idea?</i>

81
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:24,561
I started "Battle of the Year" in 1990,

82
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:26,062
because at that time
it was dead.

83
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:30,563
I wanted to show the public that,
wow, Break Dance is still here.

84
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,464
It's changed a lot,
that to us, Break Dancing was more than just a fashion.

85
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:36,565
So in the early years
it was really, really small.

86
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:39,666
The audience was only 500-800 people.

87
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:45,067
But the longer we did it,
the more popular it got within the Break Dance community,

88
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:48,468
then more and more nations
joined the "Battle of the Year".

89
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:51,369
If it wasn't for
"Battle of the Year",

90
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,470
B-Boy in Europe
definitely wouldn't have been what it is today.

91
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:01,471
The aim was also to show,
it's a culture on a really high level,

92
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:08,872
They have love for what they are doing, they invest energy and time
seven days a week to practice...

93
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:12,373
For me it was always so hard,

94
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,974
to see how hard those kids worked on their skills,

95
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,375
But finally it always ends up,
that's it.

96
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:21,676
And this is so stupid, in my opinion,
so I thought, ok,

97
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:24,477
I have to do something,
I have to show the way to perform in theaters for example,

98
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:25,778
or to show,

99
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:31,078
how to perform on comercials
like exhibitions, to make their living.

100
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,979
The "Battle of the Year" is an annual event,
and each year, in the beginning of the summer

101
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,860
there are "Battle of the Year" eliminations
that take place in 18 countries throughout the world.

102
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:50,961
Each country gets to send just one team
to Germany, to the world finals at the end of the year.

103
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,962
<i>Japan Eliminations</i>

104
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:04,863
Each of the countries
where we have "BOTY" eliminations,

105
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:09,064
the top crews come together
and in the first round, they put on a show in front of the judges.

106
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:14,665
For a good show
the criterias to judge on are like...

107
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:17,056
theme and music, choreography itself how its built up,

108
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:22,057
if the crews are dancing syncronized
and also the stage presence.

109
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,459
Considering the aspect of choreography,

110
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:30,560
The Japanese dancers, they always had
better ideas than any other B-boy country in the world,

111
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,461
they are always very innovative.

112
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:42,062
<i>French Eliminations</i>

113
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,563
The general reputation of
French B-boys,

114
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:47,164
is that they are really good dancers,

115
00:07:47,164 --> 00:07:51,865
Their expression is really positive
and at the same time agressive

116
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:54,666
and these are basically all aspects
forming a perfect B-Boy.

117
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:58,467
The French, they were doing some really intracate,

118
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:00,068
daring dancing.

119
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,469
<i>USA Eliminations</i>

120
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,920
So the top 4 crews from the first rounds
are qualified for the 2nd round.

121
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,691
Which is the "Battle" round .

122
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:28,902
So in a Battle, you have two crews on stage,
one on the left side, one on the other side.

123
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:30,903
And then the dancers are coming out,
dancing against each other

124
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,804
like attacking the other dancers from the other side.

125
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:39,405
So it is also possible, that
the whole crew

126
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:44,206
or let's say 2-3 dancers of one crew
are coming out with the choreography,

127
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,037
or you can call it "Commando",

128
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:49,438
attacking the whole other crew,
then has to react the same way.

129
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,939
So it happens in an exchange.

130
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,740
He's giving me something, that I
can relate to, and I have to answer

131
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,241
with something that he can relate to
so we can continue this battle.

132
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,542
So we can continue this exchange.

133
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,843
The dancers more or less have to improvise
with the music,

134
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:10,004
which is played spontaneously by the DJs.

135
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:14,445
And the judges are looking, closely
at how the dancers work this out with the music.

136
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,306
The battle is what, the American B-boy
is about.

137
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,707
You eat, sleep,
and think about a battle.

138
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:26,708
The USA B-boys, they are mostly known for having
a lot of good individual skills for battleing.

139
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,409
You have really, really complete
unique characters in the USA B-Boy scene.

140

<i>South Korea Eliminations</i>

141
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:02,011
Korea is a B-boy phenomenon country,

142
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:05,012
because they developed their skills
in such a short time.

143
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:09,013
What Germany or France did in 15 years,

144
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,014
they in a way,
managed this in 5 years.

145
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:13,015
They came out of no where,

146
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:16,916
bringing the level of powermoves
on a completely new level.

147
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,917
Doing powermoves, no one
has seen before,

148
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,918
They got so popular in
Europe and all over the world.

149
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,919
On a technical level,
there is nobody that could touch the Koreans. Nobody.

00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:52,129
The best feeling you have ever felt,
times that by 2.

339
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:54,430
That's kind of the feeling we get.

340
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:04,131
<i>DO-KNOCK
KNUCKLEHEAD ZOO USA</i>

341
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:06,932
I love to just go out there,
and dance

342
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:10,333
and just having cats
like, "wow, you're amazing, bro".

343
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:19,834
Las Vegas is a good training ground
no matter what you do.

344
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:23,735
Everything is so readily available
at 24 hours a day.

345
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:29,336
Like, Vegas has culture,
but it's entertainment culture.

346
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:31,537
It's a different culture, to probably
any other city in the world.

347
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:36,638
- It's culture is, that there is no culture.
- Exactly.

348
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,939
I'm down with Bboying because of the battle.

349
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,040
And business, to me, I treat the same exact way.

350
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,041
It's a battle, you're actually battleing people

351
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,042
For what you believe in.

352
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:51,603
With Hip-Hop the Mcs have been doing it,
the Djs have been doing it...

353
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:55,104
And even different aspects, the Graffiti artists up coming now are doing it.

354
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:59,835
Now it's time for the Bboys to take steps to control
our own future,

355
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:01,236
instead of, letting someone else do it for us.

356
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:04,537
Omarion, Justin Timberlake, Usher.

357
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:07,838
Always had a B-Boy
right there teaching them.

358
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,839
And they never get respect,
and they never give a name.

359
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,840
The mainstream dancers look down on
Bboying because,

360
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,741
it's such a new dance.

361
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:22,811
They go out there and they're doing all this choreography,
took them several years to learn, they all look the same.

362
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:26,312
Then we can come out there with our own technique,

363
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:29,113
and do something that's just amazing, and people go crazy.

364
00:26:29,113 --> 00:26:31,224
There is no limit,
you can do whatever you want.

365
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:35,125
As long as you're dancing
and you got that Bboy attitude, it's all good.

366
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:42,306
Winning the BOTY,
is really about respect.

367
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:47,707
When you come back and people say -
I heard those guys are the best in the world.

368
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,308
I wanna see them.

369
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:59,509
Before I do a battle, before I do a competition
or something like that, he tells me to

370
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:01,210
"Just go out there and rip that shit"

371
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,211
CHRIS' PARENTS

372
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:05,712
- That's the way he says it.
- That's the way I say it.

373
00:27:07,513 --> 00:27:10,713
Number one is seeing my son succeeding,
and he's made me very proud.

374
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:11,934
He's done it on his own,

375
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:15,935
him and his friends have put together
a crew that's just awesome.

376
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:27,036
The majority of us
were freinds before we even started dancing.

377
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:30,337
It's not like a team where we
recruited a bunch of different members

378
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:32,738
it's like, family, you know.

379
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,839
Pretty much everybody in the crew
is Latino.

380
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,140
It wasn't like it was planned out or anything,
it was more like

381
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,841
we were just homies
and we happened to also be Spanish you know.

382
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,542
Ricky is Bboy diva.

383
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:46,143
You know what I mean, he loves that attention
Ricky's out there like he's modeling.

384
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:04,614
Do-Knock is an entertainer.

385
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:06,315
Oh, this guy is hype!

386
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:19,516
What Mikey brings to the dance floor
is just smoothness

387
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:22,417
Mikey gets the ladies,
Mikey has never had a problem with that.

388
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,918
And he's a really good person, bottom line, Mikey has a good heart.

389
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:32,519
Fonzie's dance style is very explosive.

390
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,620
Fonzie is definetly a character.

391
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:38,521
Either you love him, or you hate him.

392
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:42,322
I'm half Venezuelan and half black.

393
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:44,723
Spanish, is more like where I get the cool flava

394
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,224
the black is where I get a lot of the explosiveness,
why I just fly through the air

395
00:28:48,224 --> 00:28:50,525
But I can keep it nice and cool and controled.

396
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:57,626
Battle of the Year is what I train for all my life.

397
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:01,127
When you know you are going

398
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:04,928
that's when everybody backs up and
looks at it from the outside

399
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:07,929
and they're like... Wow!

400
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,530
And then you kind of put it into perspective, and you're like -
"We're, representing the USA".

401
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:16,831
It started out in the Bronx.
It's an American culture right here.

402
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:19,232
We gotta bring it back to the USA.

403
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,333
I mean we created this thing, you know what I mean?

404
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,634
Everybody grabbed a hold of it
but we are the creators.

405
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:28,515
The last time the USA won
it was 1998

406
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,916
Man, that was a long time ago,
that was almost 10 yrs ago man.

407
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:53,617
<i>The 38th Parallel
The line that divides South and North Korea</i>

408
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:57,518
Korea right now, we're basically
still at war.

409
00:29:57,518 --> 00:30:00,119
Right over there, right over those mountain tops,

410
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,220
We got our Korean brothers in the North,

411
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:06,921
that have about 3000 missles,
pointed at us right now.

412
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:17,122
So every Korean man in the last 50 years
have had to go to the army for a minimum of 2 years.

413
00:30:17,122 --> 00:30:21,523
You have no choice in that matter,
the only choice you have is to go to jail.

414
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:26,124
That's a bitter hard truth, that you have to swollow
at a really, really young age, you know.

415
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:39,525
Dancing is not allowed in the army. Period.

416
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:46,726
So we're willing to go to the extreme
before we get drafted.

417
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:54,427
You lose everything you worked for
when you go to the army.

418
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,328
Like any professional athlete...

419
00:30:57,229 --> 00:30:59,329
if you take a break, you lose all your skills.

420
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,930
<i>GAMBLERZ REHEARSAL</i>

421
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:21,931
So the Gamblerz are the defending champions
from last year.

422
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:28,532
Gamblerz represent mainly the style of dancing
or B-Boying

423
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,133
everybody expects from a Korean crew.

424
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:35,034
Like powerful dancing
very acrobatic styles, clean executions

425
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:37,435
This is what makes Korean dancers.

426
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:44,136
Gamblerz, they would not be satisfied with doing moves,
that everybody could do.

427
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:48,937
They want to technically to be so sofisticated,
and so advanced

428
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:53,438
that it would at least take a regular B-boy
2-3 years to do.

429
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,039
B-boy Darkness is hardcore.
He's just powerful you know, he's a beast.

430
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,540
Laser has spent 5 or 6 years...

431
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,741
solely spinning on his head.

432
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:12,942
That's how he became the best
headspinner in the world.

433
00:32:13,943 --> 00:32:15,743
He can't do other moves that well.

434
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:18,544
Yo, they are just really good at that
one thing

435
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:23,145
Right now Korea is just spawning
new super-hero killers.

436
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:27,546
They're just inspiring a lot of people
to go rediculously crazy.

437
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:38,447
We start practice at midnight...

438
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:41,548
and go home by 5:30 or 6am.

439
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:46,999
unless we have a performance the
next day, which means we don't sleep!

440
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,190
Get up!

441
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:56,291
We decided there will be no days
off before BOTY.

442
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:03,492
<i>WAL JANG BUDDHIST TEMPLE</i>

443
00:33:08,293 --> 00:33:10,993
I'm a B-boy whose been in many battles..

444
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:13,094
but I believe this is the first time in history..

445
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:15,795
a battle has been hosted by a Buddhist temple!

446
00:33:21,606 --> 00:33:23,296
After the Gamblerz became World Champions...

447
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:25,597
the way people treated us totally changed.

448
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:33,098
I'm embarrassed to admit it
but our fees went up a lot.

449
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,299
We're booked for more events...

450
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,600
and gained media exposure.

451
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:44,601
<i>Commercial Starring B-Boy Bruce Lee</i>

452
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:52,892
Our biggest challenge...

453
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:55,903
is to win the Championship two years in a row.

454
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:58,904
No team has done it before...

455
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,505
so we want to make history.

456
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:09,506
So since the Gamblerz get a free pass
as defending champions,

457
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:14,207
The second crew from Korea
was qualified through BOTY Korea Elimination,

458
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:18,008
will represent their country together with Gamblerz at BOTY.

459
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:25,789
LAST FOR ONE they represent
part of the new generation of Korean Bboying culture.

460
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,490
They still have the good powermoves,

461
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:32,091
but they are one of the first crews,
showing on an international levelì,

462
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:35,892
that Korea has more to offer than just
power and dancing machines.

463
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:42,993
I've been addicted to this dance for so long.

464
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,994
It feels like a shadow following me wherever I go.

465
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:52,495
We're proud to represent Korea...

466
00:34:53,296 --> 00:34:55,896
to be the face of Korea.

467
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,397
Last For One, the whole crew is
from down south

468
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:05,998
They only come up for certain events, you know every now and then,
so they really haven't had a chance to get really looked at

469
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:06,999
<i>JEONJU
South Korea</i>

470
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:08,600
They just kind of get dissed on,
if you're from out of Seoul.

471
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,201
They look at you as if you were,
a country bumpkin, you know.

472
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:16,802
Not much happens in Jeonju, compared to Seoul.

473
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:22,503
Older people, even my own mom,
have no idea what B-boying is..

474
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:28,304
They think it's just
a bunch of guys spinning around...

475
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:30,705
like we're cleaning the floor or something.

476
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:32,406
<i>B-Boy Joe's Father</i>

477
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:38,207
The truth is many parents
in Korea still don't get it.

478
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:41,208
Is it tap dance or something?

479
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:44,609
It's hard for us to understand.

480
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,910
In a capitalist society...

481
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:51,911
you can't do anything without money.

482
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:54,312
I would have preferred for him to become...

483
00:35:54,913 --> 00:35:58,113
a professor or a doctor.

484
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:02,014
so he could contribute to society...

485
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:05,915
while securing a stable future.

00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,816
<i>Mr. Byun

487
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:11,717
Older members have to enter the army...

488
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:14,618
so they see this as their last chance.

489
00:36:14,618 --> 00:36:18,019
They are giving their all this time around...

490
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,220
because winning BOTY
is their ultimate dream.

491
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:24,521
Preparing for the competition...

492
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:27,922
we left home to train in Seoul.

493
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,623
Our whole crew is from the countryside...

494
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:36,424
so before we moved up to Seoul,

495
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,625
we said, "Lets be unified as ONE in spirit"...

496
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,326
"and dance together until the very end".

497
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:44,927
So we're LAST FOR ONE.

498
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:47,928
Korean B-boys seem very powerful...

499
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:53,329
but within the structure of Korean society...

500
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,330
they are actually weak.

501
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:57,931

as the only way...

502
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:00,532
to experience joy in their lives...

503
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:03,533
so they desperately just want to dance.

504
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:11,134
Last For One, they're very like
Happy-Go-Lucky family type kids

505
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:13,035
They really know how to work with each other.

506
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:16,436
They've only been up in Seoul for a couple of months,
and they're trying to make something happen.

507
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:26,737
We have to win this year!

508
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:35,638
Right now I'm not dancing to make money...

509
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:38,039
I want to make money to dance.

510
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,940
Since Last For One just
moved here from the countryside...

511
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:00,741
there's not a lot of work.

512
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:09,042
The team as a whole is in a very difficult situation.

513
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,003
It's gonna stink like an ol' bachelor pad.

514
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,204
At least break out the Febreeze!

515
00:38:19,204 --> 00:38:21,005
Their accomodations are very bad.

516
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:23,906
We couldn't get one big house for all of them...

517
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:25,907
so we rented two small studios
with four members in one...

518
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:27,808
and six in the other.

519
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:30,809
They are all poor...

520
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,310
and a few are from families
that would be considered...

521
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:36,311
to be in extreme poverty.

522
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:40,012
As a father...

523
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:44,913
I'm not on a path to earn
money like a businessman.

524
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:50,314
My job is to establish our national identity
by promoting the Korean flag.

525
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:55,515
I distribute and hang flags
in people's homes for free.

526
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:59,416
Since I'm in social work...

527
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:04,217
I don't have the financial means
to support his dream.

528
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:06,718
He didn't have a mother growing up...

529
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,719
and as a single father...

530
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,120
I couldn't always prepare his
meals or buy him clothes.

531
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:13,921
That frustrates me.

532
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:15,522
I want to help him.

533
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,723
I want to talk and drink with him, too.

534
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,724
I promised myself I would..

535
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:24,725
...but I haven't followed through yet.

536
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,126
<i>Braunschweig, Germany</i>

537
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,027
Braunschweig is not really a big city.

538
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:44,728
Once a year really, they have international jams,
that's during the BOTY

539
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:52,669
We have 19 crews from all over the world.

540
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:56,370
And the town was so kind to offer us
a high school.

541
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,371
Is this a school?

542
00:39:58,072 --> 00:39:59,372
It's an elementary school.

543
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,673
We're in the 4th grade guys!
Welcome to school!

544
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:07,274
It's a school....

545
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:09,975
This is awesome!

546
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:12,876
Works for me.

547
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,377
Each crew gets a bathroom,

548
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:18,278
we had to buy mattresses, linens everything,
make it good for them

549
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:20,779
because we didn't want them sleeping on the floor.

550
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,880
The gave us one mattress,
one blanket, one pillow

551
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:27,581
and told us to sleep on this.

552
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:29,199
It's no Holiday Inn.

553
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,200
There are only four showers. Four!

554
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,801
You didn't say there are only FOUR showers?!

555
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:37,502
I gotta go down there to take a shower?

556
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:38,703
-On my mother's life!

557
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,504
Is that the shower?
For reals?

558
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,905
I need to go buy some swimming trunks.

559
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:46,506
Wow, graffiti everywhere

560
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:48,107
-I'm hungry

561
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:49,208
<i>That's the cafeteria.</i>

562
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,209
I want sushi!

563
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:56,110
<i>And that's the gym for practicing.
I hope there will be a positive atmosphere in the school.</i>

564
00:40:59,011 --> 00:41:00,111
Wow!

565
00:41:01,112 --> 00:41:01,812
Shocking!

566
00:41:07,213 --> 00:41:08,413
I don't like this.

567
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:11,014
Is this grape tea?

568
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:12,315
What the hell is this?

569
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:15,016
It's rather delicious.

570
00:41:15,717 --> 00:41:17,917
I don't understand why you guys can't eat this.

571
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:30,418
I was shocked.

572
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:32,919
They told me to drink this.

573
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,320
It's chocolate sauce. You eat it with a spoon.

574
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:52,821
How do you say "tastes good" in English?

575
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:07,922
Yo, don't eat too much kimchi.

576
00:42:08,723 --> 00:42:10,323
Let's try to make it last, ok?

577
00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:13,524
I can't stand the thought of
not having anymore kimchi.

578
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:17,225
Oh, my back!

579
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:21,426
Hip-hop is so big in Cape Town now

580
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:24,827
Because it's bringing so many people together,
so many cultures and religion

581
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:28,728
You can see Ubuntu is a mix of
many different people.

582
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:33,329
And no matter if you're black, white or colored
we are still going to do this, it brings us all together.

583
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,830
It's my first experience out of the
USA.

584
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,231
I've been craving this for so long,
just to come out overseas.

585
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:54,332
That really inspires me to be around all these people
especially when I'm doing something that I love.

586
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:06,234
Hey, the American guys are practicing.

587
00:43:07,435 --> 00:43:08,835
The American guys are practicing!

588
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,136
Hey, they're good at basketball!

589
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,537
You're crazy.

590
00:43:19,537 --> 00:43:21,438
Don't forget I'm black.

591
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:22,999
Being American doesn't matter.

592
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,700
They don't know.

593
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:27,501
The French think they are just
as badass as we are.

594
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:31,802
Bottom line, just as bad as us.

595
00:43:31,802 --> 00:43:33,803
So when you get those same mentalities
in a circle, you'll get a heated battle.

596
00:43:34,004 --> 00:43:37,704
The American mentality
doesn't make it easy because...

597
00:43:37,704 --> 00:43:40,205
Americans are number one everywhere.

598
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:43,906
-That's a self-imposed position!

599
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:46,017
I remember we went to France,

600
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:50,008
and we had a USA flag.
And we got booed! The crowd went "Boo!".

601
00:43:50,008 --> 00:43:52,009
We didn't vote for Bush!
Calm down people!

602
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:55,309
I'm not sticking around to stare at them.

603
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,710
Most of the crews don't talk to other crews the days before.

604
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:04,911
You can feel a big tension.

605
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:19,212
The guys in red are Japanese. In red and black.

606
00:44:20,013 --> 00:44:21,013
In red and black...

607
00:44:22,214 --> 00:44:23,314
The damn Japanese!

608
00:44:23,314 --> 00:44:25,515
What kind of show will they come up with?

609
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:29,516
We greet each other and
ask how things are going.

610
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:31,217
We also eat together at the dining hall.

611
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:36,218
But during rehearsal we are more weary.

612
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:47,219
We don't speak the same language.

613
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,220
but we communicate with our eyes.

614
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:58,421
I'm warmed up. It's war time now.

615
00:44:58,722 --> 00:45:00,222
Check out these steps!

616
00:45:03,423 --> 00:45:05,323
Looks like they have a sponsor.

617
00:45:05,323 --> 00:45:07,124
Maybe not, their sneakers aren't nice.

618
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:13,025
When Korea and Japan face off in soccer...

619
00:45:13,025 --> 00:45:14,996
people get really into it.

620
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:18,897
If we go to the finals...

621
00:45:19,898 --> 00:45:22,398
I want to battle Japan!

622
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,899
If I could choose our opponent for the final battle...

623
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,990
it would be Korea.

624
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:33,491
They are amazing...

625
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,992
but their dance doesn't touch my heart.

626
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:40,593
You can't fuck with history, you know?

627
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:42,694
No disrespect to the Japanese B-Boys,

628
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:46,995
or Japanese youth,
because they're hella cool, I have a lot of Japanese friends,

629
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:51,196
yo we got history.
We may forgive, but we never forget.

630
00:45:51,897 --> 00:45:53,797
We don't have to beat them.
But we can't lose.

631
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:56,198
We cannot lose.

632
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:02,709
Damn, that was nice.

633
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,610
It's hard to tell, yeah,
because no one is doing anything full out.

634
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:22,012
We're not nervous.

635
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:27,993
I was nervous in 2002,
but not at all this year.

636
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:33,394
The first time we came to BOTY...

637
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:37,995
my father told me, "I'm very
proud you're representing Japan."

638
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:42,396
It was the first time he ever
complimented my dancing.

639
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:45,497
I cried my eyes out...

640
00:46:46,198 --> 00:46:48,298
and I will remember it forever.

641
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:51,999
I think that was the last time
we talked to each other.

642
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,300
Day of Battle of the Year

643
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:11,301
K-H-Z.

644
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:14,302
You'll see that on stage.

645
00:47:21,002 --> 00:47:22,002
Stay focused.

646
00:47:32,503 --> 00:47:34,203
Bro, how's my hair?

647
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,704
We're positive. We have faith.

648
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:01,305
Here we are!

649
00:48:16,606 --> 00:48:21,306
The BOTY for the last 5 years
took place in the Volkswagen Hall.

650
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:24,507
We are the biggest Bboy event worldwide.

651
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,708
We will have like 8,500 people at the venue.

652
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,709
Very, very international audience.

653
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:34,210
We have people traveling from Japan, Korea, from the USA

654
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,711
Go Ichigeki!

655
00:48:42,012 --> 00:48:46,212
In a way, of course Im proud
that today the Bboy world is watching

656
00:48:46,212 --> 00:48:49,003
Bboys on a big stage
not the Rap artists.

657
00:48:50,304 --> 00:48:52,304
The stage looks perfect.

658
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,705
We're performing here again!

659
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:02,206
I'm going on the stage
I've admired since childhood...

660
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:05,107
which is really special for me.

661
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:10,908
It's like I've bet my youth on this one shot.

662
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:22,209
<i>Crazy Grandma
66 years old - Sweden</i>

663
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,810
This man is gonna do it tonight!
It's Mike Murder!

664
00:50:08,011 --> 00:50:09,811
<i>TRIX
Host</i>

665
00:50:11,212 --> 00:50:14,812
<i>We're finally here,
Everybody's here.</i>

666
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,613
<i>Battle of the Year!</i>

667
00:50:21,213 --> 00:50:26,213
<i>19 crews,
all qualified to be here today!</i>

668
00:50:26,213 --> 00:50:30,714
<i> One day to find out,
who is the best in the world!</i>

669
00:50:33,015 --> 00:50:36,315
<i>The first crew from Thailand!</i>

670
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:42,216
At the BOTY, we have two rounds.

671
00:50:42,216 --> 00:50:47,217
In the first round all the crews have to show 
a coreography in front of the judges and the audience.

672
00:50:47,217 --> 00:50:49,218
Each show, 6 minutes.

673
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:52,219
It's important to have, like
stage presence.

674
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,520
Theme and music.

675
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:02,321
The dance synchronized.

676
00:51:04,622 --> 00:51:10,822
And then you will have a ranking of all crews
and the top four crews of the ranking, go further, into the battles.

677
00:51:10,822 --> 00:51:13,024
Hey man, Gamblerz is up next, right?

678
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:21,005
Everyone's checking out the Koreans...

679
00:51:21,005 --> 00:51:23,996
because we weren't players
until a few years ago...

680
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,697
when we came out and beat everyone.

681
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:29,998
I want to beat the Gamblerz, honestly.

682
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:34,499
They got this hype around them, and
I just want to come and...

683
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,500
The Gamblerz aren't a problem for us...

684
00:51:38,201 --> 00:51:41,001
because we both have technique
AND dance skills.

685
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:42,702
Nobody scares us.

686
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:48,403
Shit, we've done this for two years.
Nothing to worry about.

687
00:51:48,403 --> 00:51:51,404
We won Battle of the Year last year...

688
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:54,705
but we're not done and content.

689
00:51:55,106 --> 00:51:58,706
We'll battle like it's our last time.

690
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,507
We will win to make Korea legendary.

691
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:04,008
Ladies and gentlemen...

692
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:10,509
the defending champions of
BOTY...

693
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,010
from Korea...

694
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:19,611
Gamblerz.

695
00:53:10,612 --> 00:53:12,412
"The History of Korea" is our concept...

696
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:14,613
We are split into two...

697
00:53:14,814 --> 00:53:16,714
symbolizing North and South Korea.

698
00:53:17,115 --> 00:53:19,715
South Korea is expressed
through the style moves...

699
00:53:20,016 --> 00:53:22,016
while the powermoves represent North Korea.

700
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:24,917
They wage a war then reconcile...

701
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,418
and try to live in peace.

702
00:53:27,418 --> 00:53:30,119
Eventually they are reunified.

703
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,220
You know, I thought they could have been
a little more on point,

704
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,821
but when you are doing moves that difficult,
you can't always be 100%.

705
00:54:24,422 --> 00:54:29,522
Precise,
so, I'm mad confident and our show is just a different feel.

706
00:54:29,522 --> 00:54:33,623
So, it's just a matter of how the people will react to it
and how the judges see it.

707
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:36,624
Hopefully they'll want something different this year
instead of a bunch of amazing shit.

708
00:54:37,225 --> 00:54:39,025
How was it after the headspin?

709
00:54:39,326 --> 00:54:41,526
-It fucking exploded!

710
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:16,727
I'm a very competitive person.

711
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:20,728
I admit that I like to see him at his best.

712
00:55:23,229 --> 00:55:24,629
He likes to win for his team.

713
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:27,330
They are compelled to
come together in order to win...

714
00:55:28,131 --> 00:55:30,231
and can't win alone in Hip Hop.

715
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:33,832
We realized that Hip Hop
was completely different.

716
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:36,233
They took him under their wing...

717
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:37,734
like their little brother.

718
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,135
We became more comfortable with it.

719
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,736
Now I won't pass judgement
on someone I don't know.

720
00:55:43,737 --> 00:55:46,437
It's not easy but you learn
to get to know people first.

721
00:55:51,538 --> 00:55:54,538
We'll be France's ambassadors
of its Hip Hop culture today...

722
00:55:57,139 --> 00:55:59,639
and we will do our best to represent.

723
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,440
The last four French crews at BOTY...

724
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:05,641
have all reached the finals.

725
00:56:06,142 --> 00:56:08,002
So that's the challenge we will undertake...

726
00:56:08,303 --> 00:56:09,703
to reach the finals, Allah willing.

727
00:56:10,504 --> 00:56:11,404
It's you, you, you!

728
00:56:11,404 --> 00:56:12,705
Everything with your heart!

729
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:13,806
You're gonna make it!

730
00:56:57,907 --> 00:57:01,507
In our show we'll try to wake up the audience...

731
00:57:01,507 --> 00:57:05,008
and feature our musicality, that's for sure

732
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:09,009
To show that France knows how to dance.

733
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:22,410
That's it!

734
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,311
You should have seen Storm's face...

735
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,612
and the other judges.

736
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:30,413
They were in a trance.

737
00:58:31,814 --> 00:58:33,414
Kevin's the one who inspires us.

738
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:06,215
I called my dad from the airport and said...

739
00:59:06,215 --> 00:59:08,416
"I'm going to Germany now."

740
00:59:08,617 --> 00:59:11,517
He said "Take care of yourself
and I'll see you later."

741
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:16,318
I remember coming home
one night after rehearsal...

742
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:21,009
and hearing my father crying...

743
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,420
in the room next door.

744
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:29,221
The next day I saw my father set his own table...

745
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:32,522
eat his meal and wash the dishes alone.

746
00:59:33,023 --> 00:59:35,003
My heart just broke.

747
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:40,004
I got drunk one day and fell asleep.

748
00:59:40,505 --> 00:59:42,205
When I woke up...

749
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:44,706
I found an envelope next to my head.

750
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,707
There was a $100 with a note inside that said...

751
00:59:48,008 --> 00:59:50,508
"Father, I'm offering you 
money for the first time.

752
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:52,109
Please use it as your pocket money.

753
00:59:52,109 --> 00:59:54,210
Men should not cry."

754
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:57,711
I was so moved,
I felt tears running down my face.

755
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,312
What I do makes him worry.

756
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:05,913
But when I succeed in my work

757
01:00:06,714 --> 01:00:08,514
I want to say to him...

758
01:00:09,215 --> 01:00:11,315
"Dad, I am doing what I want to do"

759
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:13,416
"and making a living."

760
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:16,717
I want to start all over with him.

761
01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:20,018
Get ready!

762
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:22,319
We're up next.

763
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,820
Make sure to take three
deep breaths before we go on.

764
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:36,321
It's OK if you make a mistake.
Everybody does.

765
01:00:38,022 --> 01:00:39,622
1, 2, 3 lets go!

766
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:24,623
Our crew has a coreography...

767
01:01:25,424 --> 01:01:28,224
that combines the music
and technique of the dance...

768
01:01:28,224 --> 01:01:31,325
adding our own style and
showcasing our teamwork.

769
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:34,026
In Germany, we're gonna show
what the dance is all about.

770
01:02:17,007 --> 01:02:19,227
We Gamblerz pursue bigger action moves..

771
01:02:19,728 --> 01:02:22,128
or moves that are more technical.

772
01:02:23,129 --> 01:02:25,429
They'll take moves that aren't so difficult...

773
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,230
and package them well.

774
01:03:05,831 --> 01:03:07,631
Good Job.

775
01:03:08,432 --> 01:03:10,032
I messed up here.

776
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:11,533
Right?

777
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:12,634
No, it's good.

778
01:03:12,634 --> 01:03:13,935
Everyone had great expressions.

779
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:15,136
I kept smiling.

780
01:03:15,437 --> 01:03:16,437
I did too.

781
01:03:17,038 --> 01:03:18,438
Here, I kept fucking smiling.

782
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,639
Fucking great job.

783
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:50,440
When you see that prize 
in front of you, and you see what's at stake

784
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,521
and what's possible,
it brings you together, it's like a certain bond

785
01:03:54,521 --> 01:03:56,522
You all have your eyes set on the same prize.

786
01:03:56,922 --> 01:04:00,522
And the only way you are gonna get it,
is if you work together.

787
01:04:06,123 --> 01:04:10,423
Do it 'till the fucking day I die, dog.
Everybody remember that.

788
01:04:12,524 --> 01:04:16,124
When I look at BOTY,
I think about, you know, the aspects of why I started B-Boying.

789
01:04:16,124 --> 01:04:21,215
You were in some little gym,
battling for a $100, you know, or something like a trophy.

790
01:04:21,215 --> 01:04:25,416
All that stuff, were just building blocks
as far as to getting to this point of our lives,

791
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:27,717
this is surreal,
now we're all here in Germany

792
01:04:27,717 --> 01:04:30,718
doing the same thing we did,
back then.

793
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,219
The theme of our show is Knucklehead ZOO.

794
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:56,040
That's all the influence from all the casinos, all the lights, our city,
where we live. We're from the city of entertainment

795
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,441
We'll bring white tigers to the scene.

796
01:06:45,742 --> 01:06:49,042
<i>I want him to be strong mentally.</i>

797
01:06:50,243 --> 01:06:53,843
I think my brother is incredible...

798
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,544
and I'm proud of him.

799
01:07:01,745 --> 01:07:05,345
I want him to express his love of dancing...

800
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:07,946
without thinking of winning.

801
01:07:09,047 --> 01:07:11,047
Without greed.

802
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:16,348
If he thinks about winning
it will show in his dance.

803
01:07:18,149 --> 01:07:21,649
I never imagined how much my mom...

804
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:26,650
related to my dancing and understood me.

805
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:31,451
I'm really fired up now for Germany.

806
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:35,252
I feel their love.

807
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:42,653
Nothing is stronger than my family's bond!

808
01:07:55,454 --> 01:07:57,654
The best part about BOTY...

809
01:07:57,654 --> 01:07:59,755
is that regardless of the outcome...

810
01:07:59,755 --> 01:08:02,356
we can put our true selves out there.

811
01:08:02,356 --> 01:08:04,457
It's the best stage for that.

812
01:08:05,658 --> 01:08:07,958
It's gonna be so much fun!

813
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:09,559
It'll be great!

814
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,260
To get in front of all these people
and do a show...

815
01:08:15,001 --> 01:08:16,961
it's going to be fun!

816
01:08:17,362 --> 01:08:20,162
We're a little nervous, but not out of fear...

817
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,563
it's more out of excitement!

818
01:08:52,164 --> 01:08:54,864
The set-up is that the whole
crew forms two turntables...

819
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:57,165
and each produces a song.

820
01:08:59,766 --> 01:09:01,666
We create music through our dance.

821
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,866
Ichigeki is a threat,
just because of their energy.

822
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:35,867
When they're out there,
you can see their passion for the dance that they have.

823
01:10:48,068 --> 01:10:48,968
Well done!

824
01:10:49,469 --> 01:10:50,669
It was unbelievable!

825
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:52,870
Truly unbelievable!

826
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:54,671
Wow, amazing!

827
01:10:57,372 --> 01:10:59,372
I was completely absorbed in it.

828
01:10:59,773 --> 01:11:01,073
It felt good.

829
01:11:01,073 --> 01:11:03,774
I think I brought the 10,000 audience...

830
01:11:03,975 --> 01:11:05,575
into my world.

831
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:08,476
I had the best time dancing with you...

832
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:11,077
and we're not done yet.

833
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:13,378
The Japanese...

834
01:11:13,378 --> 01:11:14,479
They were radical.

835
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:17,580
They must have climbed mountains
to put that show together.

836
01:11:18,081 --> 01:11:22,481
This coreography too, is not just about
which dance forms you do or which dance steps.

837
01:11:22,481 --> 01:11:26,682
You should not forget
that there are other parts like,

838
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,873
using drama, you know like, how you use those,
where's the climax

839
01:11:30,274 --> 01:11:33,274
<i>The top 4 crews from the first round
are qualified for battles.</i>

840
01:11:34,376 --> 01:11:38,076
The highlight of every BOTY
is the final battle at the end.

841
01:11:38,967 --> 01:11:43,150
So, we will have one battle for third place
and we have one battle for first place.

842
01:11:44,052 --> 01:11:46,052
Yeah, judges making 
a decision.

843
01:11:46,853 --> 01:11:49,053
I think we'll battle against france.

844
01:11:49,754 --> 01:11:52,254
Whether it's first or second,
or third or fourth, I don't know.

845
01:11:52,455 --> 01:11:54,555
Now let's focus on our combinations...

846
01:11:54,555 --> 01:11:57,556
and assume we've made it
to one of the two battles.

847
01:11:58,157 --> 01:12:00,557
Come on, no one is telling us anything.

848
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:03,058
Being selected for the third place battle...

849
01:12:03,459 --> 01:12:04,859
means absolutely nothing.

850
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,160
We have to be selected for the 1st place battle...

851
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:12,161
to have any chance at winning the BOTY.

852
01:12:12,462 --> 01:12:15,262
<i>Let's go, let's go
battle for third place.</i>

853
01:12:16,263 --> 01:12:17,463
<i>Is between...</i>

854
01:12:18,564 --> 01:12:20,464
<Gamblerz>

855
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:24,365
Let's go!

856
01:12:24,365 --> 01:12:26,266
- It's embarassing.

857
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:31,967
and <Phase-T>

858
01:12:33,168 --> 01:12:35,268
Hey guys, we battle for 3rd place.

859
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:36,269
For real?

860
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,270
Yeah, 3rd place.

861
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,371
- Motherfuckers.

862
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:39,672
It's ok guys, it's fine.

863
01:12:39,873 --> 01:12:40,873
You battle against Gamblerz.

864
01:12:40,873 --> 01:12:41,474
- Gamblerz?

865
01:12:41,474 --> 01:12:44,975
Gamblerz are third, so France and Gamblerz.

866
01:12:45,476 --> 01:12:48,276
For the next 30 minutes
stretch, just in case.

867
01:12:52,777 --> 01:12:55,977
<i>France is in the house! Phase-T!</i>

868
01:12:57,578 --> 01:13:00,278
<i>Korea is in the house! Gamblerz!</i>

869
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:03,579
<i>Battle for third place!</i>

870
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,980
Right now the Koreans are percieved...

871
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,781
to be better than the French.

872
01:13:10,982 --> 01:13:12,882
So when we face the Koreans...

873
01:13:13,183 --> 01:13:14,283
it's a real battle!

874
01:13:14,283 --> 01:13:17,084
We're not friends anymore
You're our worst enemy...

875
01:13:17,084 --> 01:13:20,385
as if you burned down our house or car.

876
01:13:22,186 --> 01:13:25,286
We want to show the Europeans...

877
01:13:26,087 --> 01:13:29,787
that Korea is still a force in Bboying.

878
01:13:30,688 --> 01:13:33,488
That's the message we want to send.

879
01:13:34,689 --> 01:13:37,189
Hip Hop can be peace, love and unity.

880
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:38,990
But during the battle...

881
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:40,991
Peace and love, no! Fuck you, no peace and love! FIGHT!

882
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:15,392
A Bboy crew can be like a soccer team...

883
01:14:15,593 --> 01:14:17,393
where each player has a specific role.

884
01:14:17,594 --> 01:14:20,194
There's a dancer who is good with powermoves.

885
01:14:20,395 --> 01:14:22,495
There's a dancer who focuses on style.

886
01:14:23,896 --> 01:14:26,196
If you see any offensive player coming...

887
01:14:26,697 --> 01:14:30,897
you need a strong defender to stop him.

888
01:14:31,098 --> 01:14:33,598
It's the same with dancing.

889
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:36,999
If we see the opponent is better at powermoves...

890
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,700
we have to create something to stop him.

891
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:49,901
It's the guy against you who provokes you...

892
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:52,802
and gives you rage to do even better.

893
01:16:27,703 --> 01:16:30,303
<i>30 seconds, you got 30 seconds</i>

894
01:17:25,704 --> 01:17:27,204
Hasn't the ranking come out yet?

895
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:31,405
<i>We come to the battle.</i>

896
01:17:33,006 --> 01:17:35,206
<i>1st place...</i>

897
01:17:35,206 --> 01:17:36,507
<i>The 1st crew...</i>

898
01:17:40,608 --> 01:17:41,568
Ichigeki

899
01:17:45,309 --> 01:17:46,409
Really?!

900
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:52,310
<i>And the next crew is...</i>

901
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:55,311
Last For One.

902
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,012
What are your feelings about Last For One?

903
01:18:07,213 --> 01:18:09,613
Dok Do island is ours!

904
01:18:18,314 --> 01:18:21,314
What makes BOTY different
from all the other competitions,

905
01:18:21,515 --> 01:18:25,515
is that it really shows, whether you are
a group or not.

906
01:18:27,316 --> 01:18:30,816
This time I want to win
as a result of enjoying ourselves.

907
01:18:31,317 --> 01:18:33,617
I want to have a great time dancing.

908
01:18:33,617 --> 01:18:36,018
while competing to win.

909
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:38,919
We should have brought our
white tiger.

910
01:18:38,919 --> 01:18:41,420
We should have called up Seigfreid

911
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:43,021
Should have brought out the animals.

912
01:18:43,021 --> 01:18:44,922
We just didn't throw enough dynamics in the show.

913
01:18:44,922 --> 01:18:47,823
And we have the dynamics to throw
in the show, which fucking sucks.

914
01:18:54,824 --> 01:18:56,804
Our biggest concern is the future.

915
01:18:56,804 --> 01:18:58,505
If we win BOTY...

916
01:18:58,505 --> 01:19:01,406
we expect great things to come.

917
01:19:01,607 --> 01:19:04,307
That's why we are working so hard.

918
01:19:04,508 --> 01:19:06,908
To have a better quality of life.

919
01:19:51,609 --> 01:19:54,909
For me the art of Bboying,
clearly is, individuality

920
01:19:55,110 --> 01:20:00,110
It's how a Bboy takes that music
and adapts to it.

921
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:02,411
The music is basically that.

922
01:20:03,312 --> 01:20:06,912
Blood, pumping through your veins.
And it's allowing you to release yourself.

923
01:20:31,813 --> 01:20:33,613
Bboying is different than any
other dance.

924
01:20:34,214 --> 01:20:37,614
Because individual
interprets things differently.

925
01:20:37,614 --> 01:20:42,515
There is no specific format
for individuality.

926
01:20:43,216 --> 01:20:46,916
It's a self interpretation,
on how they want to express what they're feeling.

927
01:20:46,916 --> 01:20:52,117
Through the music they're hearing.
This is where the spirituality comes from.

928
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:49,618
Before leaving Japan, I visited my father's grave.

929
01:21:50,119 --> 01:21:52,819
I shared all my emotions with him.

930
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,420
I told him I would enjoy every moment here.

931
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:01,621
I feel like he is looking after me.

932
01:22:19,322 --> 01:22:21,622
Ichigeki is precious to me.

933
01:22:22,223 --> 01:22:23,623
When my father passed away...

934
01:22:23,824 --> 01:22:28,324
they were sad as if my father were their father.

935
01:23:34,025 --> 01:23:40,325
In Korea, they say a man who brags
about his own son is a fool.

936
01:23:41,226 --> 01:23:45,726
In the end, we don't take wealth with us when
we die, but we do go with our honor.

937
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:50,027
My son is taking a lonely path like his father.

938
01:23:50,027 --> 01:23:53,528
It's a contribution to the development of Korea.

939
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:57,329
I'm proud of my son.

940
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:02,130
I feel like I'm following in my father's footsteps...

941
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:04,831
in pursuit of honor.

942
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:09,232
I want to win for my father.

943
01:26:05,933 --> 01:26:09,333
The prize money we give away,
for BOTY

944
01:26:09,834 --> 01:26:12,004
is all together 2 500 euro.
Which is around 3,000 dollars.

945
01:26:14,835 --> 01:26:18,835
But, we split this amount of money into
1st place, 2nd place, third place and best show case.

946
01:26:19,336 --> 01:26:24,736
So you can see that more or less
the prize money is absolutely not important for the crews to join BOTY.

947
01:26:24,736 --> 01:26:27,637
Our philosophy is to promote
Bboying culture

948
01:26:27,838 --> 01:26:33,338
and hopefully, they will have a lot of opportunities
after they appear on stage at BOTY

949
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:35,669
If you make it at BOTY,

950
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:40,170
Then you can definetly make it with your show
in the normal world

951
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:42,331
and you can make a living off of it.

952
01:26:42,532 --> 01:26:44,532
<i>The judges have made their decision...</i>

953
01:26:44,733 --> 01:26:45,833
<i>"Best show"</i>

954
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:50,434
The first award is given away
for the crew with the best show and coreography.

955
01:26:50,835 --> 01:26:52,435
<i>"Best show" goes to...</i>

956
01:26:55,436 --> 01:26:56,396
<i>Ichigeki</i>

957
01:27:01,837 --> 01:27:05,137
The show case that Ichigeki
did, that was amazing.

958
01:27:05,538 --> 01:27:08,438
They scored so high,
that was crazy.

959
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:15,639
And then we have two more awards,
one for the winner of the battle for 3rd place.

960
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:24,640
<i>Applause for....
GAMBLERZ.</i>

961
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:37,841
And finally the big one for the winner of the battle for first place.

962
01:27:42,542 --> 01:27:45,742
<i>Give it up for 1st place...</i>

963
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:49,583
<i>Last For One</i>

964
01:28:15,343 --> 01:28:18,843
Last for One they seemed more like
the open guys,

965
01:28:19,144 --> 01:28:22,844
that want to party with you,
and they learn through joking around.

966
01:28:23,445 --> 01:28:28,745
And it showed in the battle, and in the show already, 
like some of the gimicks they were pulling out.

967
01:28:32,046 --> 01:28:36,246
Honestly, we're happy
We represented. We gave the best we could.

968
01:28:36,547 --> 01:28:41,747
We made a great impression
People loved us and that's what we wanted.

969
01:28:43,048 --> 01:28:44,248
I had so much fun!

970
01:28:44,248 --> 01:28:45,849
I was able to show my own dance.

971
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:48,850
I was able to stand on stage with these guys...

972
01:28:49,751 --> 01:28:51,251
and receive the Best Show award.

973
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:52,252
I had a blast.

974
01:28:52,653 --> 01:28:54,953
I'm sure my father is watching me from up there.

975
01:29:03,054 --> 01:29:05,554
I miss my dad.

976
01:29:06,755 --> 01:29:11,755
I don't usually call him after a battle
I could wait to get back to Korea...

977
01:29:12,656 --> 01:29:15,356
but I think I will call him today.

978
01:29:19,357 --> 01:29:21,957
Hello? Dad, It's me.

979
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:24,258
I'm in Germany.

980
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:27,159
Dad, we won the competition.

981
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,160
Yeah, we won.

982
01:29:33,561 --> 01:29:36,861
Listen dad, it's crazy over here right now...

983
01:29:37,262 --> 01:29:40,262
so just go back to sleep.

984
01:29:40,563 --> 01:29:41,663
Bye.

985
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:50,764
Good Morning.

986
01:29:51,565 --> 01:29:52,565
You're drinking now?

987
01:29:52,766 --> 01:29:54,366
I drank two already.

988
01:30:00,267 --> 01:30:03,367
In the first 10 years of BOTY
my aim was to get more and more crews,

989
01:30:03,367 --> 01:30:07,868
from more and more countries,
to get more and more spectators together to see it...

990
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:11,369
But then, more or less
I reached everything

991
01:30:11,369 --> 01:30:15,270
we had like 10, 000 people in the audience already,
and we had crews from all over the world.

992
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:19,771
- You want a beer?
- Yeah man, lets go drink some beer, this is the time right?

993
01:30:21,572 --> 01:30:25,372
And then in the last years I
learned what makes for me,

994
01:30:25,372 --> 01:30:27,173
the BOTY, is the little things.

995
01:30:27,774 --> 01:30:31,674
Happening the week before or
the days after,

996
01:30:31,975 --> 01:30:37,575
like people staying together before BOTY, eating together
and practicing together,

997
01:30:37,575 --> 01:30:40,077
exchanging a little bit more hopefully than just
talking about dancing.

998
01:30:43,008 --> 01:30:45,678
Once these rival crews,
once they stop dancing

999
01:30:45,678 --> 01:30:51,679
then they will find out, it wasn't really about competeing, 
it was really more about being together and jam in one place.

1000
01:30:52,381 --> 01:30:55,681
The sucess in Hip Hop worldwide is that,

1001
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:59,482
no matter what language you speak,
you can communicate with Hip Hop culture.

1002
01:30:59,482 --> 01:31:01,983
It's a serious way to unify,
youth.

1003
01:31:02,384 --> 01:31:04,984
The admiration they have for each one another

1004
01:31:04,984 --> 01:31:09,285
Is the admiration for the dance itself.

1005
01:31:09,786 --> 01:31:11,086
And that is the biggest key.

1006
01:31:13,587 --> 01:31:15,987
Looks like you'll be busy
when you get back to Korea.

1007
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:19,488
I'm excited to think we'll be busy.

1008
01:31:19,889 --> 01:31:23,089
We should be, now that we're winners!

1009
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:24,790
We're gonna get busy!

1010
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:26,791
There's so much more we want to accomplish.

1011
01:31:27,392 --> 01:31:30,692
One year later.

1012
01:32:23,397 --> 01:32:26,397
I used to worry as his father.

1013
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:28,498
Now I can only watch him.

1014
01:32:28,498 --> 01:32:30,199
And I watch him proudly.

1015
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,600
My wish for him is to shine even more brightly.

1016
01:32:45,002 --> 01:32:49,302
Once our dance has found its place in society...

1017
01:32:49,803 --> 01:32:52,603
it will help us make a living out of it.

1018
01:32:53,004 --> 01:32:56,404
To make a living with what we love...

1019
01:32:57,105 --> 01:32:59,505
is the dream of all dancers.

1020
01:33:08,006 --> 01:33:16,406
Phase-T went on to win several Bboy championships
across Europe. They continue to teach Bboying through
 the outreach program in the community of Chelles.

1021
01:33:18,607 --> 01:33:26,807
The Gamblerz continue to compete and
perform year-round in Asia, Europe and the USA

1022
01:33:29,008 --> 01:33:36,808
Knucklehead Zoo have gone on to peform for the
troops in the Middle East and several NBA shows
They also continue to work the circuit in Las Vegas.

1023
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:55,609
The members of Ichigeki retired the crew to focus
on life outside of dance, but they vowed to remain
Bboys forever. Many considered their final show
one of the best ever performed at BOTY

1024
01:33:55,910 --> 01:34:04,610
PEACE, UNITY, LOVE AND HAVING FUN! HIP HOP LIVES! PEACE!

1026
01:36:14,729 --> 01:36:16,759
So, the first part that people are gonna try

1027
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:18,104
Is just this, draw, turn the hips...

1028
01:36:21,883 --> 01:36:23,883
My  name is Buddah, I'm from Ottawa, Canada

1029
01:36:24,562 --> 01:36:26,562
I started the Canadian Floor Masters, 
23 years ago

1030
01:36:29,142 --> 01:36:30,552
And danced consistently from the early 80s

1031
01:36:32,019 --> 01:36:35,019
But I also am a social worker, I went to school
and I did a Masters in Social Work

1032
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:38,750
And I combined those two things together

1033
01:36:39,578 --> 01:36:43,578
To try and come up with a package that
speaks to young people, and youth at-risk communities

1034
01:36:45,839 --> 01:36:46,839
and aboriginal communities in the far north of Canada

1035
01:36:48,146 --> 01:36:52,146
Whether its the South Bronx, or whether it's a poor community
in the Artic in Canada

1036
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
There's some similiarity in the conditions, that young people
may not feel they have a voice

1037
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:07,447
and we sort of give them these categories, of art,
of music, of dance, of fashion, of attitude

1038
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:11,039
of ways of expressing yourself, in a way that
they can have pride

1039
01:37:12,772 --> 01:37:13,772
In their culture, and bring in their own elements

1040
01:37:16,064 --> 01:37:19,064
and explore ways that they can,
sort of reclaim a voice

1041
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:22,101
They've got to get some self-confidence,
and believe that they have value and that their life is important

1042
01:37:26,593 --> 01:37:27,843
And to me that's the starting point

1043
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:53,157
This is what we want we wanted to accomplish this week
