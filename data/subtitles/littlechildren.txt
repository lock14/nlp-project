00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,270
Want to take a walk with me?

3
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,280
...continue to protest the presence
of a convicted sex offender

4
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,790
in their neighborhood.
Michelle Betler reports.

5
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,520
Thanks, Rick. I'm standing here
on Woodward Court,

6
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,260
the quiet residential
street

7
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,460
that has become
the focus of controversy

8
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,730
ever since 48-year-old
Ronald James McGorvey returned here

9
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,560
after serving a two-year
prison sentence

10
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,630
for indecent exposure
to a minor.

11
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,700
In the past few days
an organization

12
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,870
known as the Committee
of Concerned Parents

13
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,040
began distributing these notices
throughout the community

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,310
warning neighbors
of what they call a quote,

15
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,340
"Dangerous predator
in our midst."

16
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,870
I don't really like having
him that close to my family.

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,550
I think it's outrageous.
This block has too many children

18
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,560
for a sex offender to, uh, be
moving in the neighborhood.

19
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,460
I-- I don't think
it's a good idea.

20
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,930
Makes me very nervous.
Makes me a little enraged.

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Um, I'd have a problem
if I see him on the street.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,230
It's like having an
alcoholic work in a bar.

23
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,640
They don't mix.
They shouldn't be together.

24
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,830
The conditions of his parole
expressly forbid McGorvey

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,000
to be within 100 yards
of any playground,

26
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,670
school or recreation area
where children normally gather.

27
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,740
These conditions seem
to be of little comfort

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,410
to the many parents whose
children play and go to school

29
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,250
in this formerly
tranquil community,

30
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,690
and who in the coming days and weeks
will be hoping for the best

31
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,560
but preparing for the worst.
Rick, back to you.

32
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,400
My husband and I had an
actual spiritual experience.

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,670
We did this intense
spa treatment--

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,370
- Oh, come on.
- No, listen to me.

35
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,780
It was on our vacation in Cabo
and there were eight other couples

36
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,980
and this Mayan woman.

37
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,110
A goddess,
just a goddess.

38
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,590
- She had--
- She's due in September.

39
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,180
She thinks she's gonna
take three months off,

40
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,850
then it's Christmas, then she'll be back
to work the first of the year.

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,450
Please.

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,460
Six months from now she'll be right here
on this bench with us.

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,400
My friend Beth said
that the way she did it

44
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,770
was to just take him with her every time
she went to the bathroom.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,860
- I find that strange.
- Yeah, that's what I said to Beth.

46
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,340
It's Oedipal.

47
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,310
What's the rush?

48
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,440
Although I will say, when I was trying
to potty-train Christian,

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,280
I opened the diaper
and it was huge!

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,080
Like a grown man.

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,750
Smiling politely to mask a
familiar feeling of desperation

52
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,690
Sarah reminded herself to think
like an anthropologist.

53
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,750
She was a researcher studying the
behavior of typical suburban women.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,350
They weren't organic?

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,390
She was not a typical
suburban woman herself.

56
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,660
Troy, stop that!

57
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,170
Paul and I were having
sex the other night

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,330
and I drifted off
right in the middle of it.

59
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,200
It happens.

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,370
Yeah, I guess.
But when I woke up and apologized

61
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,240
he said he hadn't
even noticed.

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,010
You know what
you should do?

63
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,710
Set aside a specific
block of time for it.

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,550
That's what Louis and I do--
every Tuesday night at 9:00.

65
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,610
"Whether you want to or not"
Sarah thought,

66
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,020
her eyes straying over
to the play area.

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,320
Even at such a tiny
playground as this

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Lucy didn't interact much
with the other children.

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,090
Sarah didn't really know why
they even bothered coming here,

70
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,190
except that she'd
probably go crazy

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,970
trapped in the house
all day

72
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,170
with this unknowable
little person.

73
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,210
Morning snack time
was 10:30 on the dot...

74
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,480
Snack time!

75
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,180
...a regimen established
and maintained by Mary Ann,

76
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,920
who believed that rigid
adherence to a timetable

77
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,860
was not only the key
to a healthy marriage,

78
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,950
but to effective
parenting as well.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,590
- I'll take this one!
- I want that one!

80
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,960
- Can I do it?
- Yeah. Ready?

81
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,540
Mommy...

82
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,570
where's my snack?

83
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,980
I'm sorry, honey,
Mommy can't find it.

84
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,280
- I forgot the rice cakes.
- Poor thing.

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,370
- I'm sure it's in here somewhere.
- Second time this week.

86
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,320
Well, who's going to keep
track of everything?

87
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,620
- Bad mommy. Bad mommy.
- Just calm down, please.

88
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,420
No calm down!
I want my snack!

89
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,830
All right, you know what?
It's--

90
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,730
it's just not here, okay?
See for yourself.

91
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,760
Wait!

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,740
Troy, honey,
give Lucy your goldfish.

93
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,540
No!

94
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,340
Troy Jonathan,
give me those goldfish!

95
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,840
But, Mama, they're mine.

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,400
No back talk.
You can share with your sister.

97
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,680
Troy has goldfish for you.
Go sit down.

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,840
That's much more than 10.

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,350
- That's great.
- Look how big I made my lawn.

100
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,880
Thank you, Mary Ann,
you're a life saver.

101
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,260
It's nothing.
I just hate to see her suffer like that.

102
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,490
Maybe you should make
a checklist and tape it to the door

103
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,020
so it's the last thing you
see before leaving the house.

104
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,190
That's what I do.

105
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, thank you. That's-- that's
a really helpful suggestion.

106
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,170
You're welcome.

107
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,400
Drink your juice.

108
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,280
Are you the plane again?

109
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,610
Look.

110
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,120
Now you have to act like me.

111
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,550
The prom king.

112
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,150
Oh my God,
he's back.

113
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,990
Sarah followed
the other women's gazes

114
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,420
over to the entrance
of the playground,

115
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,690
eager to finally get a glimpse
of the prom king,

116
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,250
the handsome and mysterious
young father

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,490
who had been a regular
at the Walker Street playground

118
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,200
for several weeks
this past spring

119
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,300
before abruptly
dropping out of sight.

120
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,070
I don't need a rest.
I need an airplane ride.

121
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,140
His departure had left a gaping
hole in the emotional lives

122
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,610
of Cheryl, Theresa
and Mary Ann.

123
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,740
Barely a day went by without one
of them speculating wistfully

124
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,350
about the reason for his absence
and the likelihood of his return.

125
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,520
Here I come.
There's no room for two of us, diesel.

126
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,000
You've done it again.

127
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,660
I hate steam engines.

128
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,630
When I come back I will
pinch you with my pinchers.

129
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,230
Yeah?
Well, when I come back

130
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,970
I'm gonna ram you
with my rammer.

131
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,910
- Ready?
- No, you won't.

132
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,850
Every time you win,
diesel!

133
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,780
I know.

134
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,520
- Hello!
- Mommy's home.

135
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,490
The jester's cap was something
that truly disturbed Brad.

136
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,820
All day long the boy ate,
played and napped in it.

137
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,860
But the moment his mother stepped in
the house he had no more use for it.

138
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,300
As if the entire day
up to that point

139
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,270
had been a pointless
and somewhat useless charade.

140
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,430
You got some sun
today, didn't you?

141
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,200
Did Daddy forget
the sunscreen again?

142
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,710
What are you doing?

143
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,210
That's his full name.
What's your favorite thing about him?

144
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,740
Um...

145
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,150
I like to come over
to his house.

146
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,620
Hmm.

147
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,090
I think I'm gonna finally break down
and get a cellphone.

148
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,290
- Really?
- Mmm.

149
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,770
Why?

150
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,230
I have no way of reaching you
when I'm out with Aaron.

151
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,600
You're done,
right?

152
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,970
You've got one.

153
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,950
Don't you think it's
strange that I don't?

154
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,850
Yeah, I do.
You just never wanted one before.

155
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,180
Yeah, I know.

156
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,780
There's a family plan.
We can talk for free.

157
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,490
Okay.

158
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,120
Let's just see where we are
at the end of the month.

159
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah?

160
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
Are your hands okay?

161
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,550
As was her custom each week
night after dinner,

162
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,890
the boy's mother sent Brad
down to the municipal library

163
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,020
to study for the bar exam.

164
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,390
But he never quite made it through
the door of the building.

165
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,660
Brad had been watching
the skateboarders for weeks now,

166
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,230
sometimes for as long
as an hour at a stretch.

167
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,430
But he never received the slightest
acknowledgement from any of them.

168
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,000
He'd been the same age as these
boys when his mother died.

169
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,140
- You do that!
- No way!

170
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,280
- Nice.
- Hey, that was nice, dude!

171
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,080
"I must have been like this,"
Brad sometimes thought.

172
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,320
"I must have been
one of them."

173
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,190
Awful.

174
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,460
He should be castrated.

175
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,230
Quick and clean,
just chop it off.

176
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,530
Then you wouldn't have to worry
about notifying the neighbors.

177
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,440
You know what else
you should do?

178
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,530
Nail his penis above the entrance
to the elementary school.

179
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,270
You know, as a warning
to other perverts.

180
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,110
You think
this is funny?

181
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,710
I just can't believe you want to
castrate a man for indecent exposure.

182
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,580
My brother used
to expose himself when--

183
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,050
when we were teenagers.
He'd do it in my bedroom,

184
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,650
he'd do it in the dining room,
he'd do it in the back seat of a car.

185
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,130
He'd always figure out a way to do it so
that nobody could see him except me.

186
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,360
Didn't you
tell anyone?

187
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,370
No, I didn't want
to get him in trouble.

188
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,300
Maybe he should
be castrated.

189
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,000
It's not the same thing.
He wasn't doing it to strangers.

190
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,800
Oh my God, there he is.

191
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,470
After all this time,
two days in a row.

192
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,000
Where's the fire?

193
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,710
Maybe he needed a vacation.

194
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,180
From what?

195
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,380
From being
the prom king.

196
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,820
It's a dirty job,
but someone's gotta do it.

197
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,690
- Close it?
- Close it.

198
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,990
Close the gate.
There you go.

199
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,590
- It's open.
- It's all right.

200
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,760
- Somebody else will close it.
- Are we practicing?

201
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,700
Are we playing
up on the swings?

202
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,800
Swing time!

203
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,580
What's he do for a living?

204
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,350
We've never actually
spoken to him.

205
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,750
Really?

206
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,190
We don't even
know his name.

207
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,350
I thought you guys said
he was a regular here.

208
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,630
- It was awkward.
- He made us nervous.

209
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,860
You had to think about what you
were gonna wear in the morning.

210
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,560
You know, put on makeup.
It was exhausting.

211
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,210
Mommy, push me!

212
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,910
Okay.
I'll be right there.

213
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,460
Wait!

214
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,720
Five bucks if you get
his phone number.

215
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,030
How old is she?

216
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,560
Lucy,

217
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,470
tell the nice boy
how old you are.

218
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,940
I'm three.

219
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,280
My grandma
lives in New Jersey.

220
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,370
She doesn't have
a swim pool.

221
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,980
Do you like to swim?

222
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,350
I don't like sharks.
They eat you up.

223
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,380
Don't listen to him.

224
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,790
We go to the town pool
almost every day.

225
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,390
- I'm Brad, by the way.
- Sarah.

226
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,760
You guys come
here a lot?

227
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,430
No, just the last
few weeks.

228
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,700
I usually go to the one
over on Harris,

229
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,040
with the big wood things,
you know, and the slide across.

230
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,770
Yeah, we actually rent a house
right around the corner

231
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,280
from there on Ashforth.

232
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,300
That ice cream truck never leaves.
Such a nightmare.

233
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,010
Yeah, tell me about it.

234
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,810
You know, you're the first person
here who's ever talked to me.

235
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,950
You make 'em nervous.

236
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,590
Oh, right.

237
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,960
I guess they don't see too many fathers
here during the weekdays.

238
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,500
You don't have to be polite.
Go ahead and ask.

239
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,400
What?

240
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,640
You know, what the person who wears the
pants in the family does for a living.

241
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh. All right,
what does your wife do?

242
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,510
- She makes documentaries.
- Oh, wow.

243
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,450
- Like Michael Moore?
- Uh, like PBS.

244
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,080
Oh.

245
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,150
Well, I think it's
admirable you're here.

246
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,020
There's no reason fathers
can't be primary caregivers.

247
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,260
I finished law school
two years ago,

248
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,790
but I can't seem to pass the bar exam.
Failed it twice now.

249
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,570
Maybe you just don't
want to be a lawyer.

250
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,140
I'll take the test
one more time.

251
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,840
If I mess up now

252
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,040
I'll just have to find something else
to do with my life.

253
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,640
- Right, buddy?
- Right.

254
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,950
Sarah was shocked by how Brad
delivered this confession,

255
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,720
with no apparent sense of being in the
least bit embarrassed by his failure.

256
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,420
Most men weren't like this.

257
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,400
Her husband Richard
certainly wasn't.

258
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,130
She wondered if Brad was
always this forthcoming.

259
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,030
If anything,
he seemed a little lonely,

260
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,630
all too ready to open his heart at
the slightest sign of interest,

261
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,230
like a lot of young
mothers she knew.

262
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,900
I couldn't help noticing
your stroller.

263
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,210
Do you have
another child?

264
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,080
No, just Aaron.
Got that at a yard sale.

265
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,550
Extra seat comes in handy
for the bear, though.

266
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,720
Lucy refuses to go
in a stroller or a car seat.

267
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,160
We have to walk everywhere. It takes us
half an hour to go three blocks,

268
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,920
unless I carry her.

269
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,690
- Daddy, I'm finished.
- Are you sure? We just got here.

270
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,290
I'm finished right now.

271
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay. All right,
here we go.

272
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,100
Ready?
One, two, three.

273
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,900
- Oops.
- Oh, hold on for a second.

274
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,270
- There, thank you.
- Are you okay?

275
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,180
No problem.

276
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,340
It was then while watching Brad
kneel down at his son's feet

277
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,180
that Sarah found herself gripped by
an unexpected pang of sadness.

278
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,250
"Don't go," she thought.

279
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,990
"Don't leave me here
with the others."

280
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,860
- It was nice talking to you.
- Same here.

281
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,100
Wait! Um...

282
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,070
Come here. Just...

283
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,200
come here.

284
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,330
You see those women
over there?

285
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,470
Just, yeah, don't--
don't look.

286
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,410
You know what
they call you?

287
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,810
What?

288
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,150
The prom king.

289
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,850
Oh God, really?

290
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,380
Yeah, they mean it
as a compliment.

291
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,860
You're a big character
in their fantasy lives.

292
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,380
Wow.

293
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,730
Um, so one of them bet me $5
I couldn't get your phone number.

294
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,530
Five bucks, huh?

295
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,470
Yeah.

296
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,900
Could we split
it 50-50?

297
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,000
It could be
arranged.

298
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,510
It doesn't have to be
your real number.

299
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,170
Oh, well, you know, in that case, sure.
You got a pen?

300
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,480
Great. Oh shit, no I--
um, no I don't.

301
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,450
- Uh...
- Well...

302
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,540
No wait, just--
wait.

303
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,880
You know what'd
really be funny?

304
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,950
If you gave me a hug.

305
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,320
- You think?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,790
- Yeah.
- All right, come here.

307
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,360
Oh my God.

308
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,200
Do you want to really
freak them out?

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,670
Yeah.

310
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,700
Who's gonna talk in there?

311
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,870
- Oh my God!
- Troy!

312
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,470
- Lucy!
- Isabelle!

313
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,280
Isabelle! Come here, Isabelle.
Okay, we have to go.

314
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,180
- Isabelle!
- Troy!

315
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,310
- I think that worked.
- Yeah, I think so.

316
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,020
- Um, well, it was nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

317
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,550
It's okay, yeah.
We're gonna go.

318
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,720
- It's all right.
- Lucy?

319
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,660
We're gonna go home.

320
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,170
Okay, here we go,
good girl.

321
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,030
Good girl.

322
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,900
I'm sure your daughter
found that very educational.

323
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,410
His name is Brad.
He's a lawyer

324
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,140
and he's really very nice.

325
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,210
For the past few days
Sarah hadn't been able

326
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,880
to concentrate on anything
but the prom king

327
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,980
and the curious thing
that had happened

328
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,960
between them
on the playground.

329
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,050
She didn't feel
shame or guilt,

330
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,620
only a sense of profound
disorientation,

331
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,900
as if she had been
kidnapped by aliens

332
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,300
then released unharmed
a few hours later.

333
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,220
As he had so often
in recent days,

334
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,060
Brad mentally reenacted
the kiss by the swing set.

335
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,560
He still couldn't believe
it had really happened.

336
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,330
And with all those women
and children watching.

337
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,660
Troy! Troy!

338
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,760
Aaron had been particularly
curious about what he'd seen.

339
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,600
Why you hugging
that lady?

340
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,870
Well, that's what
I'm trying to show you with Bozo.

341
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,670
Sometimes it's a game that adults play
to show that they're friends.

342
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,040
You say, "Hi,
I'm your friend."

343
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,480
Aaron was skeptical.

344
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,210
They returned to the playground
the following morning,

345
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,080
but no one was there.

346
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,750
Sarah hadn't shown up
at the town pool either,

347
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,880
though Brad remembered telling
her that he and Aaron

348
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,420
could be found there
most afternoons.

349
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,550
It didn't seem to matter
that Sarah wasn't his type,

350
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,660
wasn't even that pretty--
at least not compared to Kathy,

351
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,300
who had long legs
and lustrous hair

352
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,570
and perfect breasts.

353
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,170
Sarah was short, boyish,

354
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,150
and had eyebrows that were thicker
than Brad thought necessary.

355
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,250
But even so, she'd walked
into his arms that day

356
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,520
as if she were fulfilling
a secret wish

357
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,390
he hadn't remembered
making.

358
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,420
Hey, pervert!

359
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,490
Yeah, you,
you pervert!

360
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,060
You like little
boys, do you?

361
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,690
- Larry?
- Yes, it's fucking Larry!

362
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,530
Jesus, man, don't
even joke about that.

363
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,370
What are you doing?
Are you busy?

364
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,740
Uh, actually I'm
supposed to be studying.

365
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,140
Taking the bar exam
next month.

366
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,510
I thought you
did that last year.

367
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,380
Yeah.
See how well I did?

368
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,720
I got a better idea.
Get in.

369
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,550
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on.

370
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,630
Do you mind holding these?
Try to keep them nice.

371
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,530
Oh, uh...

372
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,700
are you, uh, part
of the committee?

373
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,110
I am the committee.

374
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,470
Wow.

375
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,450
That's-- that's
quite a commitment.

376
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,110
Yeah.

377
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,410
Aren't you full time
on the force already?

378
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah, I'm-- I'm taking
a little time off.

379
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,590
You know what
they should do to this bastard?

380
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,100
Just castrate him.
You know, pfft!

381
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,800
Get it over with,
right?

382
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah.

383
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,250
You look good.

384
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,450
You've been, uh,
working out?

385
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,080
Uh, just push-ups,
crunches...

386
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,720
a little light running.

387
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,460
The guys are
gonna love this.

388
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
What guys?

389
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,370
Wow, this is something.

390
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,400
Yeah, it's pretty,
but doesn't have a lot of give.

391
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,880
It's like
playing on cement.

392
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,810
Hey, hold on
a second.

393
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,110
Duane, I've really gotta talk
to you about the committee.

394
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,380
I mean, it would mean a lot to have
your support on this thing.

395
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,680
I told you already, Larry, none of us
are gonna get involved in that shit.

396
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,210
We're here to play ball. If that's your
thing, fine, but leave us out of it.

397
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,450
Okay okay, fine.
I get it, I get it, I get it. Guys!

398
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,520
Bring it in!

399
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Come on, come on,
hustle up!

400
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,330
I want you all to meet
our new quarterback.

401
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,340
- Quarterback?
- Guy better not be a pussy.

402
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,900
He played in college.

403
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,930
Uh, I'm a little
behind the curve.

404
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,840
Who are you guys?

405
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,710
- We're the Guardians!
- We're cops.

406
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,680
Welcome to the Tri-County
touch football night league.

407
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,620
Let's just work on some
simple pass patterns.

408
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,820
Brad waited for his
good sense to kick in.

409
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,950
There were lots of excuses
available to him.

410
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,660
But it felt so good to be standing here
beneath the bright lights.

411
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,190
And he was filled
with a feeling similar to the one

412
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,400
he'd had right
before kissing Sarah,

413
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,430
like his world had
cracked open

414
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,840
to reveal a thrilling
new possibility.

415
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,270
Okay, just let me
warm up a little.

416
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,470
All right! Let's go!

417
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,140
Set, hut!

418
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,390
What the fuck?

419
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,150
That's a late hit!

420
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,130
This ain't
Pop Warner, ace.

421
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,740
You fucking faggot.
You call yourself a quarterback?

422
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,840
Oh, this isn't me.

423
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,780
What are you doing?

424
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,450
What is that?
What's that for?

425
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,020
I want the scumbag
to know I'm keeping an eye on him.

426
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,830
Oh, shit.
Oh, uh...

427
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,860
I don't think we want
to be here, Larry.

428
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,900
It's not a question
of want.

429
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,810
Joanie thinks I'm
obsessed with this creep.

430
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,110
She thinks if I had a job, I wouldn't
be driving past his house

431
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,550
five, six times a day.
But you know what?

432
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,820
I kinda think
this is my job.

433
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,160
There's a roll of duct tape
in the glove compartment.

434
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,630
Would you grab it for me?

435
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,540
Honey?

436
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,340
Hi!

437
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,040
Where were you?

438
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,120
Oh my God.
What happened?

439
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,650
I-- I-- I joined
this group.

440
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,850
The Committee
for Concerned Parents.

441
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,890
We're distributing flyers about
that creep on Woodward Court.

442
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,560
These guys play a little
touch football after.

443
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,830
This late?

444
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,800
Uh, it's a night league.

445
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,500
So it's gonna be
a regular thing?

446
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,270
No no no no,
just once a week,

447
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,440
after I'm done
studying at the library.

448
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,210
Is that okay?

449
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,180
Uh, who are the guys?

450
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,310
You remember
Larry Hedges?

451
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,350
The guy from the Sprinkler
Park with the twins?

452
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,620
It's his organization.

453
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,720
I thought you
didn't like him.

454
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,560
He's okay.

455
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,860
This committee makes a
lot of sense. I mean it's--

456
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,130
it's pretty scary having
a weirdo like that

457
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,400
living right
by the playground.

458
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,770
Mmm.
I know.

459
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,750
I hate to even
think about it.

460
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,320
Guess you'd better
take a shower.

461
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,250
Brad showered quickly,
sensing a rare opportunity

462
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,380
to have sex with his wife.

463
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,550
"This is just what I need,"
he thought.

464
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,760
"Something to take
my mind off that kiss."

465
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,960
Please don't.

466
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,730
Come on, Kathy, we've
been through this before.

467
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,360
He needs to start
sleeping by himself.

468
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,270
I know.
He looks so comfy.

469
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,030
Well, he'll be just
as comfy in his own bed.

470
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,470
I just miss
him so much.

471
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm getting a little tired waking up
with his foot in my face.

472
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,270
It's a perfect foot.

473
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,050
Look at him.
Just look at him.

474
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,820
He's a handsome devil.

475
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,290
Mmm, he's perfect.

476
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,430
Good night.

477
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,770
Number 2 Hillcrest

478
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,940
was an impressive
piece of real estate.

479
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,180
Even so,
Sarah was ambivalent

480
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,450
about the house
she occupied.

481
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,680
She wasn't involved
with its purchase or design.

482
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,660
The place was a hand-me-down of sorts
from Richard's mother.

483
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,290
And the furnishings
were leftovers from his first marriage.

484
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,260
By the time
Sarah arrived here

485
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,860
Richard wasn't all that
interested in redecorating.

486
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,960
And so she decided
to leave it as it was,

487
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,870
with the exception of a single room
that she staked out for her own

488
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,880
and gradually began
to populate it

489
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,140
with the remnants
of her former self.

490
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,950
From the moment
Lucy was born

491
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,950
Sarah had refused to hire
someone for child care.

492
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,350
Read me a story?

493
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,160
In a minute,
okay?

494
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,790
- Can I sit on your lap?
- I said in a minute!

495
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,990
Go finish your
program, go.

496
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,060
She wasn't exactly sure
why she had taken this stance.

497
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,370
The truth was she spent
most afternoons marking time,

498
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,140
waiting desperately for the moment
when her husband returned from work

499
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,970
and she could finally
have a moment to herself.

500
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,170
But even this was not
something she could rely on.

501
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,770
You're ready to roll?

502
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,750
Could you wait
a few minutes?

503
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,220
I'm sorry, Richard's barricaded
in the upstairs office

504
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,150
- finishing some stuff for work.
- No problem.

505
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,320
I've got a little surprise
for someone anyway.

506
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,760
She's a terror at night.
I couldn't get her to nap again.

507
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,850
- Oh, the poor thing.
- Poor mom is more like it.

508
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,960
Hello.

509
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,930
Is there a cute little
girl in the house?

510
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,600
Oh, my goodness!

511
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,400
What--

512
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,880
what have I found?

513
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,540
- A beanie.
- Oh, a beanie.

514
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,070
Jean, you didn't
need to to that.

515
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,980
Oh, this little dog needed
a girl to take care of him.

516
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,820
And I know a little girl
who needed a dog.

517
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,890
Let me see.

518
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,650
Sarah was beginning
to get angry.

519
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,250
Her evening fitness walk
was the one thing

520
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,530
she looked forward to all day,
and Richard knew this.

521
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,600
But if there was one thing
life had taught Richard,

522
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,570
it was that it was
ridiculous

523
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,730
to be at war
with your own desires.

524
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,370
He could easily imagine what people
would say if they could see him now--

525
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,310
Exactly the same thing they'd
say if someone had told them

526
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,910
that Ray from next door
was a transvestite,

527
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,750
or that Ted from work

528
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,450
had anonymous gay sex
at highway rest stops.

529
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,820
"But we want what we want,"
Richard thought,

530
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,920
"and there's not much
we can do about it."

531
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,430
He had stumbled
on the site 11 months ago

532
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,400
while doing research
for a consulting firm.

533
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,100
His office door
was wide open.

534
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,230
But he clicked
on the link anyway.

535
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,550
He was deeply engrossed
in his discovery

536
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,110
when Ted knocked
on his door.

537
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,950
I'm taking lunch orders.
You want something?

538
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,960
Casually, but with great haste

539
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,020
Richard banished Slutty Kay
from his screen...

540
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,260
Uh, yeah, I'll have
a chicken Caesar.

541
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,700
...and reentered the flow
of an ordinary day.

542
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,570
It wasn't until
several months later

543
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,970
that Richard gave the slightest thought
to the site he had stumbled upon.

544
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,580
Do you need me
for anything else?

545
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,580
Uh, no no, you
can head home.

546
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,280
I'm just gonna catch up
on some e-mail.

547
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,340
Well, don't stay too late.
Your dinner will get cold.

548
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,730
Lately Slutty Kay
had become a problem.

549
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,790
He thought about her
far too often,

550
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,170
and spent hours studying

551
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,300
the thousands of photographs
available to him.

552
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,210
Some of Kay's practices
struck him as bizarre,

553
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,180
even off-putting.

554
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,700
She had a thing
about kitchen utensils,

555
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,080
spatulas, and dressing up
like a little girl

556
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,810
and playing with balloons.

557
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,750
But who was
Richard to judge?

558
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,080
Oh, that's it.

559
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,860
Though as close as Richard
sometimes felt to Slutty Kay,

560
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,160
as much as he believed
that he knew her,

561
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,930
he could never get past
the uncomfortable fact

562
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,130
that she existed for him
solely as a digital image.

563
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,620
The panties were an attempt
to solve this problem.

564
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,680
Maybe a sniff or two
would hurry things along,

565
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,320
so he could get back
downstairs to his real life,

566
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,350
where his wife
was waiting for him

567
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,590
her impatience increasing
by the minute.

568
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,600
What are you doing?

569
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,450
Are you almost finished there? 'Cause
I'd really like to go for my walk?

570
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,490
- You could have knocked.
- I did!

571
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,760
We need to talk.

572
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,540
You're awfully quiet
this evening.

573
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,840
- Everything okay?
- What?

574
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,180
Yeah.

575
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,350
You'll have to walk
without me tomorrow night.

576
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,860
I've got a book
group meeting.

577
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,920
Okay.

578
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,260
You're sure everything's
all right?

579
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,090
Yeah, sorry.

580
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,590
I guess I'm just
a little tired.

581
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,360
So what are
you reading?

582
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,230
"Crime and
Punishment."

583
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,500
Wow. That's pretty
highbrow for a book group.

584
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,270
Well, we have some
very stimulating discussions.

585
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,910
You should come next month.
We're doing "Madame Bovary."

586
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,080
You could be
my little sister.

587
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,680
Little sister?

588
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,380
We're trying to get younger
women involved.

589
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,290
We call them
our little sisters.

590
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,190
I don't know, Jean.

591
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,820
I read "Madame Bovary"
in grad school.

592
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,360
It's a pretty
misogynist text.

593
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,530
Well, that's an
interesting perspective.

594
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,370
- You should come.
- Let me think about it.

595
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,400
Oh, would you
excuse me, Jean?

596
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,880
Someone's at my door.
I'll call you, okay?

597
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,780
Hi!

598
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,810
Hi!

599
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,950
Wow, God,

600
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,460
this is a surprise.

601
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,520
I haven't seen
you since--

602
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,120
I-- I hope you don't mind. Your husband
said you'd be back any minute.

603
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,760
Oh, no,
not at all.

604
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,130
It's good
to see you.

605
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,970
God, um, can I get you
some tea or something?

606
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,440
I can only stay a minute.
I just came to warn you.

607
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,140
- You know that guy, the pervert?
- Uh-huh.

608
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,740
He's been riding his
bike near the playground

609
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,310
- checking out the kids.
- Oh, God.

610
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,010
Oh, God,
do the police know?

611
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,040
Nothing they can do.
He's not breaking any laws.

612
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,450
I guess they're just waiting
for him to kill someone.

613
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,750
I just thought
you should know.

614
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,390
Thanks, that's
nice of you.

615
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,730
Let me get
you some tea.

616
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,500
I'm sorry.
I-- I don't think it's a good idea.

617
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,340
I didn't mean
to kiss him.

618
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,610
I don't even know
how it happened.

619
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,180
I'd better go.
Mike's gonna worry.

620
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,160
You wanna talk?

621
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,020
I'm tired.

622
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,150
Hello.

623
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,590
Hey.

624
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,250
No, he's still
sleeping.

625
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,530
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm going
through it right now.

626
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,300
No, I guess I
don't need them.

627
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,940
Okay.

628
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,640
All right, bye.

629
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,010
H-hi.

630
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,350
H-hello?

631
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,650
Yes, I'd like
to place an order.

632
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,020
Pierce, Sarah,
Mrs.

633
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,180
Um...

634
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,530
it's the red bathing suit
on page 29.

635
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,830
The hide-your-tummy
halter neck.

636
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,460
Uh, I'm size...

637
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,710
10, eight?
I mean, I think.

638
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,840
E-eight.

639
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,550
You want to go
in the pool?

640
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,220
You do?

641
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,690
One, two.

642
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,560
Daddy, can I go
in the pool now?

643
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,540
In a minute, okay?

644
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,740
Okay.

645
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,650
There you go.

646
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,520
Mommy, I have
to go pee-pee.

647
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,860
Just go in the pool.

648
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,290
Huh-uh, I want
to go to the bathroom.

649
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,260
Really?

650
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,200
Okay, come on.

651
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,460
Okay, ready?

652
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,630
There.

653
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,730
Swing down.

654
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,740
Hey, I'm drumming it.

655
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,010
Oh.

656
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,980
Wow.

657
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,580
- It's you.
- Yeah, hey.

658
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,380
- Hi!
- Okay.

659
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,260
I hope you don't mind.
Lucy has sensitive skin.

660
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,960
She's better off
in the shade.

661
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,730
Oh no,
not at all.

662
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,990
It's nice
to see you again.

663
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,060
Yeah, you too.

664
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,110
I'm sorry,
would you get my back?

665
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,270
Um...
okay, sure.

666
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,680
Thanks.

667
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,270
Right.

668
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,340
# Who is knocking
on the door? #

669
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,910
- Thanks a lot.
- # Knocking on the door #

670
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,050
# Knocking on the door #

671
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,820
- # Who is knocking on the door? #
- It's okay, just...

672
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,320
# A way, hey hey. #

673
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,490
Lucy, say hi to the little boy
from the playground.

674
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,400
Hi.

675
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,700
You remember him?

676
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,960
The pool became a ritual.

677
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,700
I was trying to think.
I just didn't know the way.

678
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,540
- Oh oh, okay.
- I'm here, I'm here.

679
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,270
We have the creature
and we have flower.

680
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,510
Right.

681
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,040
Day after day they sat
together in the shade

682
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,080
getting to know
each other.

683
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,020
This needs mustard.

684
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,320
- Mustard?
- Yeah.

685
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,260
Having little choice
in the matter,

686
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,130
Aaron and Lucy formed
a fragile friendship.

687
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,390
Aw, that's perfect.

688
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,370
Sometimes Brad and Sarah
traded offspring.

689
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,570
Mama said, "What Papa
told you was right.

690
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,670
It's not a good idea
to talk to strangers."

691
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,680
It was the most fun
Sarah had had in years.

692
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,260
But there was always
that longing to touch,

693
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,830
to be touched by Brad.

694
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,400
And, as badly as
she wanted this,

695
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,900
she wanted just as badly
to hold on to the innocent public life

696
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,470
they'd made for themselves
out in the open.

697
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,150
So she accepted
the trade--

698
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,280
the melancholy
handshake at 4:00

699
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,420
in exchange for this
little patch of grass,

700
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,090
some sunscreen
and companionship.

701
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,620
One more happy day
at the pool.

702
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,070
Okay, no pasta
for dinner, okay?

703
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,470
We eat way too much
pasta around here.

704
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,530
I thought you
liked my pasta.

705
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,140
No, I do.
That's the problem.

706
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,150
Pretty soon I can sell advertising
space on my ass.

707
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,910
No, that's okay.
I've got to go.

708
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,920
I've got
a 9:00 at Taps.

709
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,010
I thought you were
already editing.

710
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,960
Yeah, so did I.
It was just--

711
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,520
there's something in this
family's story that really got to me.

712
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,430
The father was...

713
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,400
K-I-L-L-E-D

714
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,840
in a, um,
mortar attack,

715
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,770
and, um, left behind
a little boy.

716
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,870
I was talking to the mother the other
day on the phone,

717
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,680
and she was saying she didn't know what
she was going to do next Christmas.

718
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,010
Jeez, I bet.

719
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,580
No, it wasn't like that.
It was more...

720
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,590
she was wondering, should she keep
this tradition with her son

721
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,320
that began with
the boy's father.

722
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,160
And she was saying
he had this knack

723
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,930
for requesting
odd Christmas gifts--

724
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,900
scuba gear one year

725
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,560
and rappelling gear
the next.

726
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,600
She said he wasn't
afraid to try anything.

727
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,270
Trying new things
made him feel...

728
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:40,300
more alive.

729
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,580
I've got to go.
See you later.

730
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,590
Patch one of your best
and then we'll patch both of them.

731
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,560
Okay?

732
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,740
Hey, I got something.

733
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,600
Hot enough for you?

734
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,270
Yeah.

735
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,410
Yeah, it's so humid.

736
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,940
I've got football
practice tonight.

737
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,950
Be like playing
in a sauna.

738
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,320
Watch out for
that Italian guy.

739
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,950
What's his name?

740
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,390
Corrente?

741
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:33,160
Yeah.

742
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,630
Remember what
happened to your knee last week?

743
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,160
You should be
careful, Brad.

744
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,670
I'll be careful.

745
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,300
Promise?

746
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,410
Yeah.
Yeah, I promise.

747
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,020
Weatherman said
scattered showers.

748
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,050
I don't see
scattered showers.

749
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,000
Mom, could I please
have some money for a snack?

750
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,630
No, sweetheart.
You guys just had a snack. No.

751
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,140
Oh, okay.

752
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,140
All they want is sugar.

753
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,970
Constantly.

754
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,850
Oh, no.

755
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,560
It's him.

756
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,690
Oh, Jesus.

757
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,310
Oh my God,
it's him.

758
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,980
He's in the pool.

759
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,140
Oh my God!

760
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,280
Jacob, get out
of the pool now!

761
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,350
Oh my God.
That's him.

762
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,350
- Get away from that man.
- Why is everybody running to the pool?

763
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,390
Brooke?
Jake?

764
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,160
Dale, you'd better
get over here.

765
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,700
Get out of the pool!

766
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,380
Where's your sister?

767
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,760
Why'd we have to get out, Mom?

768
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,590
I'm scared.

769
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,030
- What did he do?
- What's going on?

770
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,250
I'm scared.

771
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,430
Um, why the
police is here?

772
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:32,200
Um, there's a man over there who
doesn't have a ticket to get in,

773
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,200
so they're asking
him to go home.

774
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,300
Mr. McGorvey.
Mr. McGorvey.

775
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,240
It'd be wise for you to get
out of the pool at this time.

776
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,480
Did that man
go near you?

777
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,210
You're sure he
didn't touch you?

778
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,890
Step out of
the pool, sir.

779
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,280
I was only trying
to cool off.

780
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,750
All right,
let's go.

781
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,320
You can go back in the pool.

782
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:07,950
Bear with us, please. You
know what that sounds means.

783
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,450
Let's go. Out of the pool.
We're closing her up. Let's go.

784
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,490
Exit the pool and vacate
the grounds immediately.

785
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,500
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow.

786
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,060
You're going to carry her?
Come on, put her in the stroller.

787
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,300
No, she won't do the stroller.

788
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,670
- Really?
- No, she will not do this.

789
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,010
Lucy, would you like to go
in the stroller?

790
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,710
Can I interest you in a stroller?
It appears she'd like a stroller.

791
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,150
It's out of
your way.

792
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,420
No, it's fine.
You don't mind, do you, Aaron?

793
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,820
Run!

794
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,930
You'd better come inside.
You can't walk home in this.

795
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,970
Oh!

796
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,940
- You can put him down in Lucy's room.
- Okay.

797
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,660
This is amazing.

798
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,390
She never naps.

799
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,690
Well, he'll be
out for the next two hours.

800
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:18,390
We'll have to get him out
of that nightgown, though,

801
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,530
before he wakes up
or he'll never forgive me.

802
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,810
Nice place.

803
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,580
- You think so?
- Yeah.

804
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,480
Well, Richard does
all right for himself.

805
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,540
What's he do, again?

806
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:42,180
Lies. Um, please have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

807
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,890
Better not,
I might ruin your furniture.

808
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,830
I'll put these things in the dryer
and get us some towels.

809
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,560
Okay.

810
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,280
Oh, God!

811
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,630
Oh, God!

812
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,670
Do you feel bad
about this?

813
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,230
No, I don't.

814
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,170
I do.

815
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,970
I feel really bad.

816
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,600
Okay.

817
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,740
Son?

818
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,350
Son?

819
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,150
Be well.

820
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,960
May knew it wasn't natural

821
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,870
for a grown man
to be living with his mother.

822
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,890
No hobbies,
no diversions.

823
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,870
It was like he was
still in prison.

824
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,880
What he needed
was a girlfriend,

825
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,610
and May intended to
help him find one.

826
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,880
There are four whole columns
of lonely women here,

827
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,410
and only a handful of men.
The odds are on our side.

828
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,920
Why wouldn't one of
these women want

829
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,620
to meet a nice
person like you?

830
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,150
I'm not
a nice person.

831
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,630
You did a bad thing.

832
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,030
But that doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

833
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,430
I have a psychosexual
disorder.

834
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,930
You're better now.

835
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,940
They wouldn't have let
you out if you weren't.

836
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,340
They let me out
because they had to.

837
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,930
Well, maybe
if you found

838
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,270
a girlfriend closer
to your own age

839
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,180
you wouldn't have
the bad urges so often.

840
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,810
I don't want a girlfriend
my own age, Mommy.

841
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,480
I wish I did.

842
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,480
What are you going
to do when I'm gone?

843
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,010
Who's going to
take care of you?

844
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,220
What's the matter,
Mommy?

845
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:21,200
Are you sick
or something?

846
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,700
I'm an old woman.
I'm not going to live forever,

847
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,830
Who's going to cook
for you?

848
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,600
Who's going
to wash the dishes?

849
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,170
I can wash
the dishes,

850
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,110
You've never washed
a dish in your life.

851
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,880
I could do it if I had to.
I'm not a retard.

852
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,440
No, you're not.

853
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:41,620
You're a miracle,
Ronnie.

854
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,390
We're all miracles.

855
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,160
You know why?

856
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,390
Because as humans,

857
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,340
everyday we go
about our business,

858
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,000
and all that time

859
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,010
we know, we all know

860
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,310
that the things
we love,

861
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:08,010
the people we love...

862
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:13,820
at any time, it can
all be taken away.

863
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:20,690
We live knowing that

864
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,790
and we keep
going anyway.

865
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,800
Animals don't do that.

866
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,370
Now I'm not asking you
to get married, Ronnie.

867
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:44,480
I'm just saying put an ad in the paper,
see what happens.

868
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,920
Fine. I'll do it if
it will make you happy.

869
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,450
But just one date.
All right?

870
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,560
You have a nice smile,
why don't we start with that?

871
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,830
What else?

872
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,230
You always eat what I put in front
of you. You never complain.

873
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,110
What else?

874
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,940
You're trying to
get back in shape.

875
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,780
You exercise.

876
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,930
Wait right there,
young man.

877
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,360
If you're going out
for some exercise,

878
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,090
you can post this now.

879
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,360
Hmm.

880
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,390
Mmm.

881
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,610
Come on.

882
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,270
Let's do it again.

883
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,180
All right.

884
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:25,050
God, it's hot
as hell up here.

885
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:27,280
What's wrong with
the laundry room?

886
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,490
No mattress.

887
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:33,760
Come on.
Lie down.

888
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,580
You're nervous,
aren't you?

889
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:52,480
What?
What do you mean?

890
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,380
The game.

891
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,940
Don't worry.
You'll be great tonight.

892
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,620
I don't know.
I haven't played in 10 years.

893
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,420
It used to be
my whole life.

894
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,260
Then when I stopped,
I just...

895
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,530
stopped. I didn't
even miss it.

896
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,640
Now that I'm playing
again, I...

897
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:21,400
feel I--

898
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,840
I don't know.

899
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,870
You feel alive.

900
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,350
Yeah.

901
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:32,010
That's good.

902
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,020
That's how you're
supposed to feel.

903
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,590
You're right.

904
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:40,920
I guess it's just
been awhile.

905
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,870
Yeah.

906
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,370
Shake.

907
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,030
- Call it.
- Heads.

908
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,770
Heads it is.

909
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,610
Ready?

910
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,080
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom. Did I wake you?

911
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,030
Oh, no honey.
Is everything okay?

912
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,890
Yeah, I'm fine.

913
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,490
You don't
sound fine.

914
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,020
No, there's nothing wrong.
I just wanted to say hi.

915
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,470
Well, hi.

916
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,970
Hi.

917
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,470
So how's my
little guy?

918
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,800
He's great.
He's sleeping right here next to me.

919
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,500
He's such
a cutie.

920
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,510
So where's Brad?

921
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,710
Brad's out.

922
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:41,480
Oh, I'm surprised
the library stays open this late.

923
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,250
Well, he's not
at the library.

924
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,880
He's playing football
with some buddies.

925
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,750
Oh, honey. Do you remember when
your father took up golf?

926
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:50,380
He's not
like dad.

927
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,890
Honey, they're
all the same.

928
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,160
Well, he's not.

929
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,260
You work so hard.

930
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,600
Now listen...

931
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,130
I could keep an eye
on the boys when you're at work;

932
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,660
make sure they're
staying out of trouble.

933
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,110
- Do you want me to come up for a visit?
- No no, Mom, don't come.

934
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,610
Well, honey, I worry
about you kids.

935
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,980
Now what are you going to do if he
fails the test again?

936
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,480
He's not going
to fail the test.

937
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,310
Oh, honey,
that's what you said last time.

938
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,080
Now how are you
doing for money?

939
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,680
We're fine.

940
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,920
I'm going to send you a little
extra this month.

941
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,580
- Mom...
- Honey, it's no burden.

942
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:26,960
- Mom... Mom, please.
- I'm happy to help.

943
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,760
Aw, shit.

944
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,070
Although the Guardians
lost by 26 points,

945
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:46,080
Brad felt oddly exhilarated in the bar
after the game.

946
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:51,210
He could feel a new respect
in the way the cops looked at him.

947
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:54,420
- What you drinking, buddy?
- He wasn't on probation anymore.

948
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,680
He was a member
of the team.

949
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,420
Ice and Advil.

950
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,820
If all else fails, you can always see
the team physician,

951
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,190
Dr. Daniels.
All his friends call him Jack.

952
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,460
- To the good doctor.
- Hear, hear.

953
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,560
- Larry? Here, you go Larry.
- Oh, thanks.

954
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,700
Let me just
grab a chair.

955
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,550
Oh, we just gave you a shot.
We just gave you a shot.

956
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:33,720
I had no business being
on that field tonight.

957
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,060
I let you down.

958
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,660
I let the whole
team down.

959
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,500
I'm slow and
I'm fat.

960
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,470
I let that guy
piss all over me.

961
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,200
Come on. That guy was offsides
the whole night.

962
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,440
Joanie left me.

963
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,470
Took the kids and went
to her mother's.

964
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,410
Jesus, Larry,
that's a tough break.

965
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,320
Oh, I deserved it.

966
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,380
Me and my big mouth.

967
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,550
I called her
a fucking whore,

968
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:05,580
right in front
of the kids.

969
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,830
Why did you do that?

970
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,860
Huh,
I don't know.

971
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,700
I was in a bad mood
or something.

972
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,730
Now I'm fucked.

973
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,110
Hey, did you hear
about the pervert?

974
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,140
He went swimming
at the town pool.

975
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:30,650
- What?
- Yeah.

976
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,310
- Who told you that?
- Nobody. I saw it myself.

977
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,480
- The town pool?
- Yeah, during the heatwave.

978
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,050
- The town pool?
- Yep.

979
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,890
Th-that place is
crawling with kids.

980
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,590
I mean, my boys
go there.

981
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,100
Yeah, well, you know what,
it was just that one time.

982
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:45,460
Um, he-- he won't be back.
The cops came.

983
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,400
Cops? What cops?
Anyone from the team?

984
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,990
Uh, no.

985
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,370
You sure?

986
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,840
- Anyone from the team show up there?
- No no.

987
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,540
- Yes or no!
- I'm saying no.

988
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,810
- No, nobody...
- Jesus Christ,

989
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,970
that little fucking weasel.

990
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,450
Larry, slow down.

991
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,810
Slow down, Larry!

992
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,450
- What now?
- Good evening, Mrs. McGorvey.

993
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:14,590
We were wondering
if Ronnie was home.

994
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,860
You leave him alone.

995
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,590
We just want a little
moment of his time. Just a little chat.

996
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:19,530
This is my house.
I pay the mortgage,

997
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,430
and I say who is
and isn't--

998
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,100
Yoo-hoo, Ronnie!

999
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:26,040
- Get your perverted ass down here now.
- I'm calling the police.

1000
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,340
I hear they're well-disposed
to child molesters.

1001
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,040
It's okay, Mommy.
Can I help you, gentlemen?

1002
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,670
Ronnie, you go
on upstairs.

1003
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:34,240
Larry, let him go. I think he gets
the point. We can go home now.

1004
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,250
You listen to me, you
little piece of shit.

1005
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,480
You stay the fuck away
from the town pool.

1006
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,510
- You hear me?
- You're a bully!

1007
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,120
My Ronnie would
never do what he did.

1008
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,400
That poor child
at the mall--

1009
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,970
what you did to him.

1010
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:20,420
Larry?

1011
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,890
Larry?

1012
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:29,270
Why did she
say that?

1013
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,930
Oh, don't pretend you
don't know about me.

1014
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,440
Everybody knows.
Everybody!

1015
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:36,640
Look, h-honestly,
I-- I don't know anything.

1016
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,410
I remember hearing
something...

1017
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:43,320
a few years ago
when we first moved here, but--

1018
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,320
something about
a-- a shooting

1019
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,510
at the mall.

1020
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,180
That's-- that's it.
That's all.

1021
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:53,560
I didn't even
know you then.

1022
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,120
I'm sorry.

1023
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,390
Sorry.

1024
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,530
It's okay.

1025
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:17,140
Dispatch said there
was a shooter loose at the mall.

1026
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,420
It was 10 minutes
from the end of my shift.

1027
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:22,010
10 minutes and there would have
been someone else.

1028
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,860
I can still see that
boy's face staring up at me.

1029
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:32,490
Yeah, but--
but it was an accident.

1030
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:34,560
You were trying
to stop a guy,

1031
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,000
and the-- the boy
g-got caught

1032
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,600
in the crossfire,
right?

1033
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,440
No, I panicked.

1034
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,410
There was no shooter.

1035
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,410
Just the boy.

1036
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:48,610
Antoine Harris
was his name.

1037
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,550
He was big for his age,
only 13 years old.

1038
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,420
He was a good kid.
Thought it was a joke,

1039
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,390
waving around an air gun
at his friend

1040
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,120
in the Big 5.

1041
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,130
They were acting out some scene
from some movie they liked.

1042
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,190
Shop girl saw it
from across the way,

1043
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:06,760
called 911.

1044
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,740
Jesus, that's terrible.

1045
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,360
That...

1046
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,970
well, you didn't know.

1047
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,030
It could have
been real.

1048
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,140
But it wasn't.

1049
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:27,650
His parents...

1050
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,250
uh, his parents--

1051
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,090
I had to...

1052
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,950
I was diagnosed with post-traumatic
stress syndrome

1053
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:58,110
by three different
psychiatrists.

1054
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:00,950
That's why I retired.

1055
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,790
I couldn't do
the job anymore.

1056
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,030
- So why don't you do something else?
- Like what?

1057
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:15,040
Drive a forklift
at Costco?

1058
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,170
Maybe you could
go back to school.

1059
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:22,270
I loved my job.

1060
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,570
I don't wanna do
anything else.

1061
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,820
You ever think about the term
"homeland security"?

1062
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,590
I mean,
really think about it?

1063
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,710
The day that
you found out

1064
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:56,180
that your father had
been killed in Iraq,

1065
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,240
do you remember
that day?

1066
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,840
Can you talk
about that?

1067
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,010
You feel comfortable
talking about that?

1068
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,320
After the men came

1069
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,950
to tell my mom,

1070
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:15,360
I cried,

1071
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,920
but she didn't.

1072
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:21,590
She just went up
to her room

1073
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,540
and grabbed the pillows
off the bed,

1074
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:28,570
cut the tops off of them
with a pair scissors.

1075
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:34,210
There were feathers
all over the place.

1076
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,740
That must have really
frightened you.

1077
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:42,550
No, she was trying
to find the crown.

1078
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,250
The crown?

1079
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,260
The crown you leave
in your pillow

1080
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,760
when you've slept on it
for a long time.

1081
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:54,530
My--

1082
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,230
my father had
two crowns.

1083
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,640
Stop there.

1084
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:03,870
- You hungry?
- No.

1085
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:05,710
Mind if I get
some lunch?

1086
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,580
No, go ahead.

1087
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,160
Brad?

1088
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:35,660
Honey, you there?

1089
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:39,340
Pick up.
I know you're there.

1090
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,910
It's Aaron's nap time.

1091
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,780
Okay, I guess you guys
are out somewhere.

1092
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,290
Um...

1093
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,950
I love you both.

1094
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:55,090
Bye.

1095
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:45,240
I certainly did.

1096
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,580
Here we go.

1097
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,240
I don't know, Jean.
I don't think I'm up for this.

1098
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,080
Well, now don't
be silly.

1099
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,250
- It'll be fun.
- Really?

1100
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,520
You're not the only
little sister here tonight.

1101
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,120
- Oh, that's good.
- Oh!

1102
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,220
Hi, would you
like a glass?

1103
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:06,930
Did anybody like this book?
Because I really just hated it.

1104
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,800
It's so depressing.

1105
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,930
She cheats on her husband
with two different guys,

1106
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:13,630
wastes all his money,
then kills herself with rat poison?

1107
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,770
Do I really need
to read this?

1108
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:19,400
Well, there is a lot
of good descriptive writing.

1109
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,410
It's supposed
to be depressing.

1110
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,380
It's a tragedy.

1111
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,850
Madame Bovary was undone
by a tragic flaw.

1112
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,820
What's her flaw?

1113
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,820
Blindness.
She didn't see

1114
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,990
that the men were
just using her.

1115
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,620
She just wants
a little romance in her life.

1116
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:39,330
- You can't blame her for that.
- It's about women's choices.

1117
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:42,060
Back then, a woman
didn't have a lot of choices.

1118
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,300
You could be a nun
or a wife.

1119
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,970
- That's all there was.
- Or a prostitute.

1120
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,130
She had a choice.

1121
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,840
She had a choice not
to cheat on her husband.

1122
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,650
I found it refreshing
to read about a woman

1123
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,550
reclaiming her sexuality.

1124
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:59,850
Is that a nice way
of saying she's a slut?

1125
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,520
Madame Bovary's
not a slut.

1126
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,490
She's one of the great
characters in Western literature.

1127
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:10,050
I was a little puzzled
by some of the sexual references.

1128
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,790
Look,
like this one.

1129
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:14,360
Um...

1130
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,000
"He abandoned
every last shred

1131
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,010
of restraint
and consideration.

1132
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,530
He turned her
into something compliant,

1133
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:25,100
something corrupt."

1134
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,380
Does anyone know
what that means?

1135
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,180
It means
she's a slut.

1136
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,190
Is he tying her up

1137
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,320
or something?

1138
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,880
Anal sex.

1139
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:42,190
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1140
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:45,890
Did everyone get that
but me?

1141
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,830
Let's set that aside
for now.

1142
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,840
I'm really eager
to hear what

1143
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:53,740
our other little sister
has to say.

1144
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,400
I'm not sure if you know this,
but Sarah has a Ph.D

1145
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,340
in English lit.

1146
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,510
Just a masters.

1147
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,520
I never wrote
my dissertation.

1148
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:06,710
Well, you still have
a lot more expertise

1149
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,050
than the rest of us.

1150
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,590
I think I understand
your feelings about this book.

1151
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:20,230
I used to have some
problems with it myself.

1152
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:22,240
When I read it
in grad school,

1153
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,260
Madame Bovary just
seemed like a fool.

1154
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:27,640
She marries
the wrong man,

1155
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,300
makes one foolish mistake
after another.

1156
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:35,080
But when I read it this time,
I just fell in love with her.

1157
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,780
She's trapped.

1158
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,720
She has a choice. She can either
accept a life of misery

1159
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,320
or she can struggle
against it.

1160
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,620
And she chooses
to struggle.

1161
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,960
Some struggle--
hop into bed

1162
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,960
with every guy
who says hello.

1163
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,560
Well, she fails in the end, but there's
something beautiful

1164
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:58,060
and even heroic
in her rebellion.

1165
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:00,570
My professors would
kill me for even thinking this,

1166
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,800
but...

1167
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,330
in her own
strange way,

1168
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,350
Emma Bovary
is a feminist.

1169
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,320
Oh, that's nice.

1170
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:12,180
So now cheating on your husband
makes you a feminist?

1171
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,850
No no no.

1172
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:18,480
It's not the cheating.
It's the hunger.

1173
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,930
The hunger
for an alternative,

1174
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,330
and the refusal to accept
a life of unhappiness.

1175
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:34,870
Maybe I didn't
understand the book.

1176
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,010
She just looks
so pathetic.

1177
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,650
Is she pretty?

1178
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:45,950
Who?

1179
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,480
Your wife.

1180
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,490
Degrading yourself
for nothing.

1181
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:55,190
It's a simple question.

1182
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,600
She's pretty, okay?
Do we have to talk about this now?

1183
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:03,330
I mean, did she really think a man like
that was gonna run away with her?

1184
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,940
Possibly.

1185
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:13,380
How pretty is she?

1186
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,680
A knockout.

1187
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,220
Beauty's overrated,
Sarah.

1188
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,430
Brad had meant this
to be comforting.

1189
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,200
But at 3:00 in the morning, it had
precisely the opposite effect.

1190
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:43,470
He had a beautiful wife,

1191
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:47,240
a knockout, and she was sleeping
beside him right now.

1192
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,980
Only someone who took
his own beauty for granted

1193
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,710
would have been able
to say something so stupid

1194
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,880
and with a straight face.

1195
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:22,580
Weekends were difficult
for Sarah.

1196
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,240
48-hour prison stretches

1197
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,190
separating one happy blur
of weekdays

1198
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,310
from the rest.

1199
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,660
I'm going to the ocean.

1200
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,390
- You are?
- I'm going to the ocean.

1201
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:39,730
Is he doing
his ocean dance?

1202
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,430
Sarah sometimes let herself
be carried away by fantasies

1203
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:51,240
of a future very different from the life
she was living now,

1204
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,580
in which she and Brad were
free to love each other

1205
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:55,450
in broad daylight;

1206
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,180
where they had no one
to answer to

1207
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,580
but each other.

1208
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:03,390
It could happen,
she thought. It had to,

1209
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,910
because she wasn't sure she
could keep living like this

1210
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,450
for very much longer.

1211
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,660
Open your mouth again.

1212
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,610
No, I don't want to.

1213
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,580
May your mouth
be open.

1214
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,600
May your mouth.

1215
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,140
This is coming
into your mouth.

1216
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,850
Open your mouth,
little fishy.

1217
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:35,250
Hungry, hungry.

1218
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,490
Little fishy
is not hungry?

1219
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,460
You okay?

1220
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,370
Yeah, fine.

1221
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,630
- How about you?
- Great.

1222
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,440
So how was
your weekend?

1223
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,010
You really wanna know?
It sucked.

1224
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,050
How was yours?

1225
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,220
Terrible.

1226
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:13,620
- Really?
- Yeah.

1227
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:18,100
Yeah, we went to the beach
and all Kathy and I did

1228
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:20,860
was argue
the whole time.

1229
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:24,300
Oh, you did?

1230
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:28,740
Yeah, it was our
annual argument

1231
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:31,740
over taking
the bar exam,

1232
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,840
like our whole life
depends on it.

1233
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,310
Get it over with.
You'll feel better.

1234
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,510
It's this whole thing.

1235
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,020
Gotta take a train
on Wednesday.

1236
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:43,960
It's a two-day ordeal.

1237
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:46,360
I'm not even
gonna pass.

1238
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:48,860
- You'll be fine.
- No.

1239
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,850
No, I won't.

1240
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:55,300
I haven't cracked
a book all summer.

1241
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:07,210
I missed you.

1242
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,980
I missed you, too.

1243
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,750
Don't-- don't do it.

1244
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,050
- What?
- The test.

1245
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:23,820
- Oh.
- Blow it off.

1246
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:26,360
We should go somewhere,

1247
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,390
just for a night,
you know?

1248
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,230
Richard's out
of town till Friday,

1249
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:32,400
and I'm sure I can get
a sitter for Lucy.

1250
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,680
No, I can't do that.

1251
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:41,310
I gotta take the test.

1252
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:54,790
That's good.

1253
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:57,350
- Looks good?
- Yeah.

1254
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,390
Well, I have a good
feeling about this whole thing.

1255
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:02,400
In fact, I think I'm gonna go buy
a bottle of champagne

1256
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,770
and put it in the fridge,
and we can open it to celebrate

1257
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:07,370
when we get
the good news.

1258
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:10,430
Don't get your hopes up.

1259
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,450
We've been
through this before.

1260
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,470
Huh-uh. This time's
gonna be different.

1261
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,570
I can feel it.

1262
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,520
Can you believe it?
This is our first date.

1263
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:54,780
Like a date, you know,
without the kids, I mean.

1264
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:58,050
How was Lucy?
Did she cry or anything?

1265
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:00,250
No, are you kidding?

1266
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:03,060
With Jean there, she
just about shoved me out the door.

1267
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:11,470
I thought we could make something
really beautiful.

1268
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:14,670
I have so
many things here.

1269
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:17,370
We could make...

1270
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:19,740
a picture frame.

1271
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,270
Or a jewelry box.

1272
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:30,380
Or a hat.

1273
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,520
Something for my mommy.

1274
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,550
Okay.

1275
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,800
- Stop it, stop it.
- No, Ronnie.

1276
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,460
Ron-- Ron-- Ronnie,
just hold on.

1277
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,670
Now there.

1278
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:51,170
You look handsome.
She won't be disappointed.

1279
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:54,240
Wait'll she hears
about my criminal record.

1280
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,580
I don't think you need
to get into that just yet.

1281
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,850
Why don't you stick
to small talk?

1282
01:25:58,890 --> 01:26:01,850
What if someone
recognizes me?

1283
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:05,350
That's highly unlikely.
I made the dinner reservation

1284
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,860
at a restaurant over
in Haverhill.

1285
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,770
Sheila.

1286
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:31,510
- Sheila.
- Yeah.

1287
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:37,460
Something wrong
with the food?

1288
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:41,320
No, it's fine.

1289
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,260
Back at the house you
mentioned you were on medication.

1290
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:51,190
- What kind?
- All kinds.

1291
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,230
Mostly psychotropic.

1292
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:59,780
So you had some kind
of a breakdown?

1293
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:03,580
Mm-hmm, my junior year
in college.

1294
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,680
You were that young?

1295
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:09,810
What happened?

1296
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:12,550
I don't really know.

1297
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:15,760
Well, nervous breakdowns
don't just come out of nowhere.

1298
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,400
Something must have
caused it.

1299
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:22,060
I guess.

1300
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,070
But I was fine before
I left for college.

1301
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:29,040
I don't know.
Maybe it was the stress

1302
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,910
of being on my own.

1303
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:33,710
Maybe it's a chemical
imbalance in my brain.

1304
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,010
Every psychiatrist I go to
has a different opinion.

1305
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:40,210
This one guy, Dr. Faris,

1306
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:44,050
he said I must have been
sexually abused as a child.

1307
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:45,610
When I told him
I wasn't,

1308
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,250
he said I must be
repressing the memory.

1309
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,100
Right, um, so what
happened after that?

1310
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:54,000
Did you drop out
of school?

1311
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:56,870
Not right away.

1312
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,060
My mother wanted me
to go

1313
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:01,160
to the campus
counseling center.

1314
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:03,730
And they wanted
the problem fixed, like I could just

1315
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:06,710
snap my fingers and everything
would be okay again.

1316
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:09,180
Yeah, I know
all about that.

1317
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:12,710
You do?

1318
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:16,240
Yes, I do.

1319
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,090
So they said
I could leave school

1320
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,830
and get married and have lots of kids
like my sisters,

1321
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,990
and I can't take care
of kids.

1322
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:30,400
I can't even take care
of myself

1323
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,600
most of the time.
Besides, who's gonna marry me?

1324
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:37,080
You're not so bad.

1325
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:39,140
What?

1326
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:42,910
You're--
you're not so bad.

1327
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,190
I haven't had
a real boyfriend in six years,

1328
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:54,250
not since my second
breakdown.

1329
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:57,060
I had this thing happen
on a Greyhound bus.

1330
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,230
- I was--
- Do you want me to wrap that up?

1331
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:03,000
Oh, no, thank you.

1332
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,870
No, wrap it up, please.
I'll take it home.

1333
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,530
Folks gonna want dessert?

1334
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:11,670
What do you say, Sheila?
You wanna share something sweet?

1335
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,150
Let's make a little stop.

1336
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:20,980
Take the next left.

1337
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,160
Turn off the lights.

1338
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,860
I had
a nice time tonight.

1339
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:49,440
The last guy
I went out with,

1340
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,310
you know what he did?

1341
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:54,220
He ditched me.

1342
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:57,280
He got up to go
to the men's room,

1343
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,350
never came back.

1344
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,690
Stuck me with the check.

1345
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:07,200
Never said goodbye.

1346
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:10,290
Never called
to apologize.

1347
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:13,860
He wasn't my type anyway.
He was a big-shot CPA.

1348
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:17,400
Super normal guy.
Didn't want to be dating some psycho.

1349
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,350
But you seem like
a nice person.

1350
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:58,980
Better not tell on me.

1351
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,250
You hear me?

1352
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:10,690
You better not tell,
or I'll fucking get you.

1353
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,290
Hold on, Mom.
Hold on, Dad.

1354
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:17,960
You should park the car
on the escalator, and back...

1355
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,400
- So?
- What?

1356
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:24,390
- Up, down and then up.
- Test, dummy. How'd it go?

1357
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,430
It was all right.

1358
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,630
You didn't call home
last night.

1359
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,300
I was worried.

1360
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:34,440
Go on the escalator.

1361
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,510
Guess I could really use
that cellphone.

1362
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,720
Go on the escalator.

1363
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:14,250
- Well, look who's back.
- Oh, hi.

1364
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:16,620
Hi, Jean.

1365
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,620
Thanks.

1366
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,590
You're a lifesaver.

1367
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:22,600
So how was
your old roommate?

1368
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:23,990
Oh, great.

1369
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:26,930
Yeah, thanks for doing this
on such short notice.

1370
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:30,330
Let me give you something
for your time.

1371
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:32,670
That's not necessary.

1372
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:36,070
No, really.
I insist.

1373
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:39,040
Please don't.

1374
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,880
Okay.

1375
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,210
Uh, any calls?

1376
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:47,840
Nope,
it was very quiet.

1377
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:51,350
She's asleep on your bed.
It was a very busy day.

1378
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:53,220
That's great.

1379
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:56,320
Um, Jean,
is everything okay?

1380
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,320
Yeah, she's
a wonderful child.

1381
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,580
Mommy.

1382
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,590
Mommy!

1383
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:39,360
Yeah.

1384
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:41,810
Are you coming?

1385
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,010
- I have something.
- What?

1386
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:51,180
I have something
for you.

1387
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:57,750
Just give me
a second here, okay?

1388
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,550
Brad.

1389
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,530
Brad.

1390
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:37,620
Hmm.

1391
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:42,390
Aaron's been telling me
about his new friend Lucy.

1392
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,000
She sounds like
a sweet little girl.

1393
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:49,530
What's her mother like?

1394
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:57,250
Nice enough, I guess.

1395
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,680
I can't even
remember her name.

1396
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:05,620
Isn't it Sarah?

1397
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:09,690
Sarah?

1398
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:12,100
Yeah, Sarah,

1399
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:13,760
from the pool.

1400
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:17,070
Her daughter's name
is Lucy.

1401
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,500
Oh, Lucy's mom.
Yeah, I forgot. That's right.

1402
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:22,300
Her name is Sarah.

1403
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:25,540
Hmm.

1404
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,740
Yeah, it might be
really nice for Aaron

1405
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:30,980
if they came over
for dinner.

1406
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:37,050
Okay.

1407
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:02,570
So you're
in advertising?

1408
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:05,450
No, that's-- that's
a common misconception.

1409
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,480
I'm not in advertising.
I'm in branding.

1410
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,610
And that's very different.

1411
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,780
Richard's pretty high up
in the company.

1412
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,790
Yeah yeah,
I have these clients

1413
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:15,590
and they'll come to me
when they have,

1414
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:17,890
you know, a new product
they wanna sell.

1415
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:21,330
Like, um, these guys,
they were in a couple weeks ago.

1416
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:24,430
They're trying to open this chain
of Chinese restaurants, right?

1417
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:27,910
They're talking to me
and I-- I look down at the table

1418
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,270
and I realize that none
of these guys were Chinese.

1419
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:33,240
Where were they from?

1420
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,370
They're a bunch of fat cats
from Tennessee.

1421
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:38,110
They think they can start a chain
of Chinese restaurants good enough

1422
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,120
to fool the average
American boob.

1423
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:42,180
Oh, God.

1424
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:44,820
Mmm!

1425
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:46,790
- This is delicious.
- Isn't it?

1426
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:49,420
Brad's a fantastic cook.

1427
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:52,800
So you guys see these
fliers with the guy's face

1428
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,660
plastered all over
our village?

1429
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:57,290
Lots of Sturm und Drang
in our quiet little town, huh?

1430
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,000
Yeah, it's crazy.

1431
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,600
What I want to know is why they let
a creep like that out of prison.

1432
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,470
Some of the people
going after him are just as crazy.

1433
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:07,480
- What do you mean?
- Well, just today I heard that

1434
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:09,670
some nut's been spray-painting
the poor guy's house,

1435
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:12,950
lighting fires on his porch.
God knows what else.

1436
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:14,950
- Do they know who's doing it?
- Huh-uh.

1437
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:16,960
They think
it's some ex-cop.

1438
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:19,050
You know, that guy
who killed that kid at the mall.

1439
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:20,850
Yeah, I don't think
it's him.

1440
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:23,620
You're biased.
You're friends with the guy.

1441
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:26,690
Brad's on that Committee
of Concerned Parents

1442
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:28,360
with him.

1443
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,230
I didn't know
you were on that.

1444
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:32,760
I play on his
football team.

1445
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:36,040
He asked me to distribute
some fliers.

1446
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,130
He's on your team.

1447
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:41,110
You never told me that.

1448
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,810
Yeah.

1449
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:48,780
You know what's weird?
I've never even seen this McGorvey guy.

1450
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:51,090
- We did.
- No, we didn't.

1451
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,110
Not you.
Me and Brad.

1452
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,220
That day at the pool,
remember?

1453
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:59,490
Yeah, I-I
totally forgot.

1454
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:04,800
- Well, what happened?
- Sexual tension is an elusive thing,

1455
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,170
but Kathy had
pretty good radar for it.

1456
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:10,800
It was like someone had
turned a knob a hair to the right,

1457
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,400
and the radio station
clicked in so loud and clear

1458
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:16,210
it almost
knocked her over.

1459
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:18,680
Once she became aware
of the connection between them,

1460
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,850
it seemed impossible that
she'd missed it before.

1461
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:24,520
On a hunch,
Kathy dropped her fork

1462
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,750
in the hopes that
while retrieving it

1463
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:30,160
she would catch Sarah
and Brad playing footsie,

1464
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,560
- but she was mistaken.
- Asked him to leave, and he left.

1465
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,860
But you know what?
He didn't look scary, right? I mean--

1466
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:38,730
No, it-- it wasn't that big
of a deal, you know.

1467
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:41,470
- No, he's like a regular guy, you know?
- Yeah, I mean--

1468
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:43,530
Kathy, are you okay?

1469
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:45,480
Uh, yeah.

1470
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:48,640
Just a sec.

1471
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,340
Brad had convinced
himself

1472
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:52,850
the dinner party
had gone well.

1473
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:56,410
That he and Sarah had managed
to put Kathy's suspicions to rest,

1474
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,650
at least temporarily.

1475
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:00,890
She certainly hadn't
accused him of anything,

1476
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:02,890
or behaved in a way
that made him think

1477
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:04,950
she'd noticed
anything untoward.

1478
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:13,690
I'm really glad
they came over.

1479
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:22,380
- Good night.
- Good night.

1480
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,140
Two days later, however,

1481
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:26,480
his mother-in-law showed up
for a surprise visit...

1482
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,450
- Thank you, John.
- ...of ominously indeterminate length.

1483
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,290
And from that moment on,
she accompanied Brad

1484
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,090
and Aaron everywhere:

1485
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:35,990
To the playground;

1486
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,960
- We need some butter.
- To the supermarket;

1487
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,490
And to the town pool.

1488
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:44,200
Hi, Aaron.

1489
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:47,540
Hi, Lucy.

1490
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:51,740
The worst of it
was the pool.

1491
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:54,470
Nevertheless,
after threatening all week

1492
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:57,780
to go the football game,
Brad's mother-in-law decided against it

1493
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,790
at the last minute.

1494
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:01,880
- So are you coming?
- Well, I'd like to,

1495
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,890
but I'm a little tired.

1496
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,260
You sure?
You're welcome to.

1497
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:08,260
No, go ahead.
You and Aaron

1498
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:10,560
sure kept me hopping
this afternoon.

1499
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,690
Looks like
you're on your own.

1500
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:15,700
Oh, that's my ride.

1501
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:18,460
- What time are you gonna be home?
- I don't know.

1502
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,230
Pretty late, though.

1503
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:23,240
Be careful and stay
out of trouble.

1504
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,880
Winds whisper
of high hopes,

1505
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,050
victory is in the skies.

1506
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:44,460
One joins with many
on the summer's green field.

1507
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,660
At 0 and 5, the Guardians
were the basement dwellers

1508
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,530
of the Tri-County
Touch Football Night League.

1509
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:54,440
The Controllers, a team of young
hotshots from the financial district

1510
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:57,370
were 4 and 1
with an explosive offense

1511
01:41:57,410 --> 01:42:00,670
that regularly racked up
40 to 50 points a game.

1512
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:02,840
But from
the opening kickoff,

1513
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,370
this ragtag group
of law enforcement officers

1514
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,610
decided to crunch
their own numbers.

1515
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,620
But the Controllers
scored first

1516
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,690
after recovering
a Bart Williams fumble

1517
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:20,630
deep in Guardians' territory near
the end of the second quarter.

1518
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,460
The Guardians evened things up early
in the second half...

1519
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,540
moving methodically
downfield

1520
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,810
on an 80-yard
touchdown drive.

1521
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:43,080
The Controllers regained the lead
with a fourth quarter field goal.

1522
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:46,750
With less than a minute
to go, trailing by three,

1523
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:48,820
the Guardians faced
the extinction of their hopes.

1524
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:51,390
- Down!
- It was their last chance--

1525
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:53,900
4th and 5
on their own 35.

1526
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:56,730
Set!

1527
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:59,500
Hut, hut!

1528
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:35,400
Yeah yeah yeah!

1529
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:40,840
Yeah yeah!

1530
01:43:42,110 --> 01:43:44,780
Yeah!

1531
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,440
Oh my God!

1532
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:50,480
Yeah!

1533
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:03,530
Brad, Brad!

1534
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,260
What do you want?

1535
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:09,970
Everyone is waiting for us at the bar.
Are-- are-- are you coming?

1536
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:12,200
Why don't you go on ahead?
I'll catch up later.

1537
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,870
You're gonna come, right?
I mean, we gotta celebrate.

1538
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:16,610
Yeah yeah yeah,
I'll be there.

1539
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:19,640
- You promise?
- Jesus, Larry, I just told you.

1540
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:23,020
- Well, you got a ride?
- Yeah.

1541
01:44:24,690 --> 01:44:27,160
Okay.

1542
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:29,290
I'll have a cold one
waiting for you.

1543
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:35,400
Larry, you have
to go home now.

1544
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,770
Just give me five more minutes.
He promised he was coming.

1545
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,640
I don't care what he promised,
I want to lock up.

1546
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,800
Now get your butt
out of here!

1547
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:45,500
Now!

1548
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:56,150
When I looked up there
and saw you it was just...

1549
01:44:56,190 --> 01:45:00,520
wow... wow.

1550
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,860
Thank God you came.

1551
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:07,160
I don't want
to go home.

1552
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,600
I want to stay
right here forever.

1553
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,470
No, I do.
For the first time in my life

1554
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,230
I feel like anything is possible.
Like I can do anything, you know?

1555
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:22,110
What are we doing?

1556
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:25,780
What do you mean?

1557
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,840
It's not real, Brad.

1558
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:30,650
What?

1559
01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:33,590
This. It's wrong
and it's weird.

1560
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:35,350
How long are we
gonna sneak around together?

1561
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:37,450
How long can that last?
I can't do this anymore.

1562
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,900
No, no don't
say that.

1563
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:42,590
As long as I know that
we're gonna have this--

1564
01:45:42,630 --> 01:45:44,070
Have what?

1565
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:47,130
What is this?

1566
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:49,370
Look...

1567
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:52,210
if that dinner at your house
was any indication,

1568
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:55,180
you seem pretty happy
with your wife.

1569
01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:56,840
You know, you have
a perfect life

1570
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,870
- and I don't wanna to be the--
- Okay, stop stop stop.

1571
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:04,150
Run away with me.

1572
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:06,050
What?

1573
01:46:08,430 --> 01:46:10,590
You don't mean that.

1574
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:15,360
You believe in me.

1575
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,840
Come on.

1576
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:20,960
We'll go away,
figure this thing out.

1577
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:24,240
It's not weird.

1578
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:27,250
The kids are comfortable
with each other.

1579
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,410
I know there's more
to it than that, but...

1580
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:33,080
let's do this.

1581
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:36,490
Please.
Please, Sarah.

1582
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:41,760
Oh my God.

1583
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:45,290
You really mean
it, don't you?

1584
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:47,860
Yes.

1585
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,430
Okay.

1586
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:56,130
Okay. Okay.
Yes!

1587
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,970
Yes!
Okay, yes.

1588
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:05,940
Fucking Brad, I'm so
sick of hearing about Brad.

1589
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:08,610
I'm fucking over it.

1590
01:47:08,650 --> 01:47:11,950
I don't even like him.
He's a loser.

1591
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:13,620
"Brad made
the fucking touchdown."

1592
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,630
Yeah, you know why
he hasn't the balls to show up here?

1593
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:18,860
'Cause I fucking made the block.
It's bullshit.

1594
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:21,800
That's why he's not even here,
he's fucking embarrassed to see me.

1595
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:26,430
I don't even like anybody
in this fucking town.

1596
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:41,520
Wake up, wake up!

1597
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:44,610
Wake up, Woodward Court!

1598
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,250
Okay, I'm awake.

1599
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:50,820
Open your eyes! Get your goddamn heads
out of the sand!

1600
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:53,230
My heads?
My goddamn heads?

1601
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:55,320
Don't you people
love your children?

1602
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:58,500
Don't you want
to protect them from evil?

1603
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:01,670
Woodward Court,
there's a pervert in your midst!

1604
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:04,370
There's a goddamn
pervert in your midst!

1605
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:07,440
Open your eyes!
Protect the children!

1606
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,470
Save the children!

1607
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,250
Wake up
and see the grass!

1608
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,450
- Just stay inside, Ronnie.
- Save the children!

1609
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:16,250
Open your goddamn eyes!

1610
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:19,190
Wake up and save
your children!

1611
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:23,090
You dirty son of a bitch!
Get off my lawn!

1612
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:26,190
Who the hell do you think you are,
Mr. High and Mighty?

1613
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:30,570
No perverts
in Woodward Court!

1614
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,300
You think you're God?
Far from it!

1615
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,700
I don't think I'm God!
I never said I was!

1616
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:36,540
You murderer, you
killed the boy.

1617
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:39,310
I didn't murder anyone. Now why don't
you go back inside, put some clothes on?

1618
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:41,470
You shot him through the neck.
I read it in the paper.

1619
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:44,350
- No perverts in--
- You son of a bitch. Give me that.

1620
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:46,720
Hey hey!

1621
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:47,980
Give me that!
You're--

1622
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:49,890
- You need to go home.
- The police are coming.

1623
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,290
I mean, you're
scaring my kids.

1624
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:53,590
Your kids need
to be frightened!

1625
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:55,390
They live across
the street from a pervert!

1626
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,260
Ow! Oh!

1627
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:02,290
Oh my God, Mrs. McGorvey.
Are you okay?

1628
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:07,370
May. May!

1629
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:09,740
May-- I think we should
call an ambulance.

1630
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:12,070
Karen, call an
ambulance, right now!

1631
01:49:12,110 --> 01:49:14,340
- I'm doing it!
- Oh, fuck.

1632
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:19,110
- May!
- This is all I need.

1633
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:29,720
Excuse me, Mr. McGorvey,
we need to ask you some questions.

1634
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:09,160
$14.35.

1635
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:24,380
The Fed continuing its
campaign against inflation

1636
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:28,110
by raising short-term interest rates
for the 10th time yesterday.

1637
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:31,680
Usually there is a correlation between
inflation and gold prices.

1638
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:34,620
Let's take you over
to our stocks desk...

1639
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:39,060
Cafe con leche?

1640
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:40,790
Thank you.

1641
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:51,580
Kim Bryson, please call
the operator.

1642
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:55,610
Madre.

1643
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:02,790
Me too.
She's resting.

1644
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:48,760
Get down, knock it off!

1645
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,670
Quiet.

1646
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:53,640
Bring him around.

1647
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:04,110
It's all yours.

1648
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:54,960
Mr. McGorvey.

1649
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:59,900
Mr. McGorvey.

1650
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:02,300
I'm afraid we
have some bad news.

1651
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,640
Do you have a mortuary
to make arrangements for you?

1652
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:13,720
It's not a problem. The hospital has
a list that I can provide you with.

1653
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,880
Here's what's
going to happen:

1654
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:18,550
Your mother's body
will remain in her bed

1655
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:20,250
for up to three hours.

1656
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:22,490
Three hours is typical.

1657
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:26,220
But if there's a request for more time,
depending on our occupancy,

1658
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:28,430
that's usually
not a problem.

1659
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:32,200
If there's anyone
you need to call--

1660
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,540
family, friends--

1661
01:53:34,570 --> 01:53:37,060
they're welcome to full
bedside visitation privileges

1662
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:39,010
before the body is taken
downstairs

1663
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,910
to be prepped
for transport.

1664
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:44,880
Do you have any questions
that come to mind?

1665
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,450
Anything I can
help you with?

1666
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:56,590
- No.
- Okay.

1667
01:53:56,630 --> 01:53:59,600
I'd like to remind you to take your
mother's personal belongings with you

1668
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:01,860
before you leave
the hospital today.

1669
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,390
And all I need from you now

1670
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,530
is to sign this release-
of-remains form.

1671
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:17,090
Aaron.

1672
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:22,150
Hey hey, buddy.

1673
01:58:22,190 --> 01:58:26,220
Can you wake up?

1674
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:33,600
Could you take your
hat off for me?

1675
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:36,400
Just for a second.

1676
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:44,540
Are you mad
at me, Daddy?

1677
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:48,850
No.
No no no, not at all.

1678
01:58:48,890 --> 01:58:52,880
I just want you to know

1679
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:55,830
that I love you very much,

1680
01:58:55,860 --> 01:59:00,560
and I would never do
anything to hurt you, okay?

1681
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:03,260
Okay.

1682
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:12,670
Now you can go
back to sleep.

1683
02:00:12,270 --> 02:00:15,900
Lucy, come on.

1684
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:18,880
Let's go.

1685
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:21,710
I will not go
in the car seat!

1686
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:26,880
- You have to go in the car--
- I will not go in the car seat!

1687
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,150
Yes, you will!

1688
02:00:28,190 --> 02:00:29,410
- You will go in the car seat.
- No, I won't!

1689
02:00:29,450 --> 02:00:31,010
Yes, you will.
Go in the car seat.

1690
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:34,960
I will not go
in the car seat!

1691
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:36,550
Okay, just...

1692
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,120
you don't have to
go in the car seat.

1693
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:43,600
You can just go here.
No, actually...

1694
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,190
go on the floor.
Okay.

1695
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:47,670
Okay, go down on the floor.
You have to stay down, okay?

1696
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:50,330
Mommy is gonna get arrested.
Just stay down, okay?

1697
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,540
Okay.

1698
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:14,030
Mommy, I want to go home.

1699
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:16,730
Yeah, in a minute,

1700
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:18,740
as soon as Brad gets here.

1701
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:35,180
Hello?

1702
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:41,420
Ronnie?

1703
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:10,880
Oh my God.

1704
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:29,300
- Are you all right?
- Yeah! Let's do it. Let's go!

1705
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:34,500
Hey, dude!

1706
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:37,880
What's the hurry?

1707
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:44,590
Yeah! Oh!

1708
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:48,390
- This is so sick.
- Damn.

1709
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:50,220
- Nice.
- Oh, man.

1710
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:52,860
Yeah, man.

1711
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:54,460
- How about you take a run?
- What?

1712
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:56,930
Yeah, give it a shot.
See what happens.

1713
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:59,900
You guys are crazy,
I can't do that.

1714
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:03,500
It's not about that,
it's about skating.

1715
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,140
Whoo!

1716
02:03:17,190 --> 02:03:20,820
Come on.
Come on.

1717
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:15,440
Do you need help?

1718
02:04:25,290 --> 02:04:28,420
She's g-- gone.

1719
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:31,120
She's gone.

1720
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:35,500
Who?
Who's gone?

1721
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:38,760
Mommy.
Mommy's gone.

1722
02:04:42,610 --> 02:04:44,910
I...

1723
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:47,880
I'm sorry.

1724
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:49,940
She loved me.

1725
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:55,910
She's the only one.

1726
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:01,690
Mommy died.

1727
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:06,390
Mommy died.

1728
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:16,840
Lucy?

1729
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:23,870
Lucy! Lucy!

1730
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:29,320
Lucy!

1731
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:37,190
Lucy! Lucy!

1732
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:45,930
Lucy!

1733
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:58,340
Get in the car seat!
Get in the car seat!

1734
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:25,070
It's okay, Mommy.

1735
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,710
Lucy.

1736
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:41,180
I'm sorry.

1737
02:06:41,230 --> 02:06:43,720
I'm so sorry.

1738
02:06:49,430 --> 02:06:52,700
Would you like
to go home?

1739
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,970
Yeah?

1740
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:15,520
Brad.

1741
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:18,490
Brad, can you hear me?

1742
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:22,690
D-- don't move.
The ambulance is on its way.

1743
02:07:22,730 --> 02:07:25,670
Jesus.

1744
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:27,930
What happened to me?

1745
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:30,810
These kids say you've been
out cold for the last five minutes.

1746
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:34,170
- You almost had it.
- Dude, you were awesome.

1747
02:07:34,210 --> 02:07:38,080
- That shit was gnarly, son.
- Back up, back up! Give him some space.

1748
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:41,140
You just hold still, all right?
Hold still.

1749
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:47,050
Hey, bro!

1750
02:07:47,090 --> 02:07:49,920
Here, this fell
out of your pocket.

1751
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:54,230
I don't need it anymore.

1752
02:07:54,270 --> 02:07:56,960
- Hey, Duane.
- Hm?

1753
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,940
Could you call my wife?

1754
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:01,870
You got it, buddy.

1755
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:04,070
Here we go.

1756
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:27,400
I'm so sorry, Ronnie.

1757
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:32,170
I really am.

1758
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:41,370
I never wanted anything
like this to happen.

1759
02:08:55,890 --> 02:08:57,950
Are-- are you--
are you okay?

1760
02:09:08,570 --> 02:09:12,530
- Oh, no!
- Gonna be good now.

1761
02:09:12,580 --> 02:09:15,510
Oh my God!

1762
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:22,710
Hold on, Ronnie.

1763
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:25,650
You hold on.

1764
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:28,490
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1765
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:31,120
You hold on there,
okay, buddy?

1766
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:36,100
In his wildest dreams

1767
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:40,070
Larry would never have imagined
he'd once again be in this position,

1768
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:43,470
where precious
minutes count.

1769
02:09:43,510 --> 02:09:46,370
Tonight he could
save a life.

1770
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:49,040
He knew Ronnie had done
some bad things in the past,

1771
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:53,880
but so had Larry.

1772
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,610
You couldn't
change the past.

1773
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:03,180
But the future could
be a different story.

1774
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:14,460
And it had
to start somewhere.

1775
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,142
