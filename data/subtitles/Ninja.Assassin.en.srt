1
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,448
Fuck.

2
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,087
Fuck.

3
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:07,915
Fucking fuck!

4
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,757
Watch it, old man.

5
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,974
What the fuck? You're doing it wrong!

6
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,698
Needle is doing
what the needle does.

7
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,933
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

8
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,275
The irezumi does not hide
the skin.

9
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:31,838
The tattoo reveals
the nature of the man..

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,091
and illuminates the 4 noble
professions in The Book of 5 Rings:

11
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:40,247
The warrior, the artist,
the merchant and the farmer.

12
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,884
If there is a conflict
between the needle and the skin..

13
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:45,686
between the mark and the man..

14
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:50,201
then perhaps the path you have chosen
is not the path for which you're suited.

15
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:53,293
What did you just say, old man?

16
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:54,737
Huh?

17
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,564
I know you didn't just disrespect me,
did you?

18
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:59,533
You that fucking stupid?

19
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:03,287
You disrespect me and I will tattoo
the ceiling with your fucking brains.

20
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,656
No disrespect.

21
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:11,378
You're lucky.

22
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:15,598
I can't kill you
until you finish this thing. Bang.

23
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:17,951
Give me that mirror.

24
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:20,153
Let's see how it's looking.

25
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,855
Not bad, not bad.

26
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,957
Hey, boss.
This just came for you.

27
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,709
- What is it?
- A letter.

28
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,579
So open it, dumb-ass.

29
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,569
What?

30
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,219
- What is it?
- It looks like sand.

31
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,908
Yep. Sand.

32
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,252
- Black sand.
- No.

33
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,557
You know what this is?

34
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,625
You wanna let us in on the joke?

35
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:56,370
Years ago I watched a man
open an envelope like that one.

36
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:58,692
There were many with him.

37
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:02,811
And they laughed as you laugh now.

38
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:06,600
And then it came from the shadows..

39
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:10,286
and their laughter
was drowned in blood.

40
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:15,181
What came out of the shadows?

41
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:17,185
I cannot say the word.

42
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:19,197
What word?

43
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,384
That night..

44
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:27,254
one of their blades struck here.

45
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:30,290
I should have died
but for an accident of birth.

46
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:35,512
My heart is here, on the other side.

47
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,866
The fuck is that?

48
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:42,585
It looks like a ninja, boss.

49
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,006
A ninja?

50
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:49,317
Are you kidding me? That's the word
you're afraid to say? Ninja?

51
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:53,215
Ninja, ninja, ninja.
Yeah, you old fuck.

52
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,163
Yeah, you had me going.

53
00:03:56,164 --> 00:04:00,756
- Ninja. That's some good shit.
- Ninja.

54
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:26,125
Wanna fuck with me, huh?

55
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,891
Wanna fuck with me?

56
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:18,542
Look, you don't have to do this.

57
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:22,036
Whatever they're paying you,
I will double it.

58
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,684
I will triple it.

59
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:25,350
You hear me?

60
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,173
I will pay you whatever you want.

61
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:29,843
You cannot bargain with it,
you cannot reason with it..

62
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:33,113
because it is not a human being.

63
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:36,149
It is a demon sent straight from hell.

64
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,951
You shut your face, old man!

65
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:40,237
I will blow your fuck..

66
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,411
For 57 years, I have told your story.

67
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:10,201
No one ever believed me,
but you are real, aren't you?

68
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:31,052
Is all that for the Delgata case?

69
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:33,985
This is Delgata.

70
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,476
- And the rest?
- Evidence.

71
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:38,245
For?

72
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:40,281
Oh, no, not again, Mika, please.

73
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,983
What is the problem?
You have trusted my research before.

74
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:46,120
Here's a question. Which of these
does not belong in this sentence:

75
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,374
Laptop, space shuttle,
nanotechnology, ninja.

76
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:54,175
All I'm asking for is an hour.
That's all.

77
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:59,009
Why do I think I'm gonna regret this?

78
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,701
Remember the Eulmi Incident?

79
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:03,771
Korean queen, late 1800s,
killed by one of these ninja clans.

80
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,805
Ozunu, I think.

81
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:09,643
Now, I have been going through
the original transcripts of the trial..

82
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:11,187
of Kunitomo Shigeaki.

83
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:16,016
The prosecutor questioned Shigeaki
about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.

84
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:19,519
Shigeaki answered that he didn't know
what the prosecutor was talking about.

85
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,454
The question
was never brought up again.

86
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:24,057
But what pinged for me was the amount.

87
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:27,327
The exact same amount rumored
to have been paid to the Ozunu Clan..

88
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:30,865
for the yakuza massacre that happened
last week in Osaka.

89
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:33,033
So you wonder,
in this ever-changing world..

90
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,269
if the cost of a man's life
remains the same.

91
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:39,273
Exactly. I mean, I figure these clans
are like, what, a thousand years old?

92
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,988
They probably don't change.

93
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,012
So I started looking at
international wire transfers..

94
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:49,716
targeting banks in the regions
of several high-profile assassinations.

95
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:52,298
And bingo.
Russian Prime Minister Zhukov.

96
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,387
The day before the assassination..

97
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:59,492
1,555,999 dollars and 90 cents..

98
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:02,403
was transferred
from the Bank of Shanghai.

99
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:06,112
That is the exact market equivalent
of 100 pounds of gold.

100
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:11,372
- Okay, you got me, this is interesting.
- The clans are real, Ryan.

101
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:14,708
They steal children
and turn them into assassins.

102
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,244
Look, Mika, no one's denying
the historical facts..

103
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,812
but this thing doesn't make sense
in a modern world.

104
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:23,449
They're real. You can call them spooks
or assassins or whatever you want..

105
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:27,855
if it makes you feel better, but they are
out there and they are killing people.

106
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:30,334
And nobody is doing a damn thing
to stop them.

107
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,945
Hi. Excuse me.

108
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,509
Would you mind?

109
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:45,183
If it's not too much trouble,
could you help me with this?

110
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,965
What clan are you from?

111
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,059
What are you doing in Berlin?

112
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,811
I don't understand.

113
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:32,065
What is going on?

114
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,769
You found something?

115
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,405
I was digging around trying to see what
I could come up with and I found this.

116
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:55,241
A report. A friend of mine in Moscow
tipped me to it.

117
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,144
It was written during the Cold War..

118
00:09:57,144 --> 00:10:00,980
by a high-ranking KGB agent
named Alexi Sabatin.

119
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:04,384
He raises the possibility that
a number of political assassinations..

120
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:07,254
were conducted by an ancient
but sophisticated network..

121
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:10,096
he calls the Nine Clans.

122
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,061
- Mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas.
- What happened to him?

123
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:17,143
Same thing that's gonna happen to me
if I hang around with you.

124
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:20,707
Kicked out of the service
for mental instability.

125
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,418
You believe it now, don't you?

126
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:26,350
Ninjas.

127
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:29,658
- You gotta be joking.
- Well, then why are you doing all this?

128
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:31,477
I don't know.

129
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:34,380
But I can guarantee you
it has nothing to do with the fact..

130
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:37,929
that you're the most attractive
researcher I have ever worked with.

131
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:51,164
Oh, Mr. Nan.

132
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:52,566
Good, you are back.

133
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:56,318
We had a heating problem,
and I had to go into your apartment.

134
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:00,541
- Is it all right?
- It's all fixed.

135
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:03,043
You keep it very dark and spare in there.

136
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:06,659
And forgive me, but I couldn't help
noticing your suitcases.

137
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:11,851
I told you,
my father was a very sick man.

138
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:13,653
Do you have to leave Berlin soon?

139
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:16,590
Not yet, but I am expecting a phone call.

140
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,826
I'm sorry to hear that.

141
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:23,307
One day, death will come for us all.

142
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,827
Wherever you are..

143
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,331
wherever you may go..

144
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:54,961
you must never forget who you are..

145
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:57,941
how you came to be.

146
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:00,511
You are Ozunu.

147
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:03,386
You are part of me..

148
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,005
as I am part of you.

149
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:09,576
This is the truth of your lives..

150
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:13,364
and it will remain true after death.

151
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,424
This is my new son.

152
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:21,663
I have given him the name Raizo.

153
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:24,591
Welcome him as your brother.

154
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:27,308
Welcome, Raizo.

155
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,918
The body must obey the will.

156
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,885
Hunger and thirst..

157
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:57,402
even the blood in your veins,
are the body's weakness.

158
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,745
Master them..

159
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:11,181
and you master the self.

160
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:21,148
This is the power of the Ozunu Clan.

161
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,128
This is the way of the ninja.

162
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,006
Eat tonight and you work
twice as hard tomorrow.

163
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,227
What is the lesson?

164
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,035
Look at your brother.

165
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:03,499
Life is combat.

166
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:06,510
You know this truth.

167
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:09,495
Abandoned by your parents..

168
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:13,339
without a home,
without people to care for you..

169
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,769
you should have died.

170
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:18,020
But instead you fought.

171
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:22,775
As you did here today,
you fought and you won.

172
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:28,447
In combat, you face the enemy
without doubt, without pity or remorse.

173
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:32,360
To survive, you must learn
to fear nothing at all.

174
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:02,828
Pain breeds weakness.

175
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,606
Remember, suffering exists..

176
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:13,573
only because weakness exists.

177
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,780
You must hate all weakness.

178
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:39,068
Hate it in others,
but most of all, hate it in yourself.

179
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,733
- Mrs. Sabatin?
- Yeah.

180
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:37,419
I'm Mika Coretti with Europol.
We spoke on the phone.

181
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:42,675
You said you read
my husband's report, yes?

182
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:44,051
Yes.

183
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:49,015
I understand the report caused some
problems for him within the KGB.

184
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:52,318
The report caused problems
for Alexi's career..

185
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,289
the way Moses caused problems
for the Pharaoh. Very unpleasant.

186
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,592
What happened?

187
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,926
About two years ago..

188
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:03,563
after the assassination of Zhukov..

189
00:18:03,564 --> 00:18:07,134
the report drew attention.

190
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:09,035
After that..

191
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:10,718
everything was different.

192
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:16,710
Alexi hired men to change all the locks
and put in more of them.

193
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:19,679
Locks on the windows,
locks on the doors, locks on the locks.

194
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,281
He put in cameras and motion sensors..

195
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:26,034
and lights. Everywhere, lights.

196
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:29,270
"There can be no shadows", he said.

197
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:32,067
"No shadows".

198
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:36,462
Then one day, a man came to the door.

199
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,909
They talked in Alexi's study
for some time, and then..

200
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,845
the young man left.

201
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,638
My husband was a soldier.

202
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,607
Member of Russian intelligence.

203
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:51,086
He was not a man to frighten easily.

204
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:56,449
But when I came to the door,
in his eyes I saw fear.

205
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,152
And then he stood up..

206
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:03,490
he kissed me and told me
that he loved me very much.

207
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:07,638
He said..

208
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,479
I should always remember that.

209
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,001
Do you know what they talked about?

210
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:20,119
No. He said it was safer that way.

211
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:23,086
Can I ask how he died?

212
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,781
The lights went out.

213
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:38,807
You are the first person who has
taken my husband's work seriously.

214
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:44,541
It would be good to know
that he did not die without cause.

215
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:56,653
He would want you to have this.

216
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,181
Who are you?

217
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,115
Hiyah!

218
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:52,365
Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?

219
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:54,900
You think this is pain.

220
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,737
You are mistaken.

221
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,076
That is true pain.

222
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:19,084
Here is your test, Raizo.

223
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:20,895
Survive the night.

224
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:23,950
Very good, Raizo.

225
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:26,191
Very good.

226
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:40,093
Boy, you're like a dog with a bone
on that computer, aren't you?

227
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:41,502
Excuse me?

228
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,695
Agent Zabranski..

229
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:45,832
Internal Affairs.

230
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:48,674
Need to ask you a couple of questions.

231
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,703
- You're Mika Coretti, yeah?
- Mm..hm.

232
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:54,207
Forensic researcher.

233
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,923
You work a lot with Agent Maslow,
that right?

234
00:24:56,924 --> 00:24:59,077
A few cases, yeah.

235
00:24:59,078 --> 00:25:02,015
You have something
of a social relationship.

236
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:05,857
- Excuse me?
- You had lunch with him on the 13th..

237
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:07,999
and again on the 18th.

238
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,497
How do you know that?

239
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:13,092
- Isn't it true?
- I'm not sure.

240
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:17,596
We do have lunch together sometimes,
but that's usually when we're working.

241
00:25:17,597 --> 00:25:21,267
Has Agent Maslow seemed different
to you lately in any way?

242
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:25,003
I mean, has he said or done anything
that struck you as unusual?

243
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:25,964
No. Why?

244
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:30,089
Has Agent Maslow done something?

245
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,612
Just routine.

246
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:35,548
The agency cares about
its field operatives.

247
00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:39,285
We monitor for signs
of stress, fatigue..

248
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:40,968
mental exhaustion.

249
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:44,471
Agent Maslow has a serious caseload.

250
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:50,676
That much work
can wear on a man, hm?

251
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,106
Zabranski came to my office.

252
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:58,136
Yeah,
I got a surprise visit too.

253
00:25:58,137 --> 00:26:00,923
He made it real clear, Ryan.
They're watching us.

254
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,878
I don't get the full picture quite yet,
but I know a warning when I see one.

255
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,949
- But why?
- Why? It's obvious.

256
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,019
If this little fantasy of yours
has any chance of being real..

257
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:16,955
then these clans are gonna have
some pretty major juice protecting them.

258
00:26:16,957 --> 00:26:18,958
So, what are you gonna do?

259
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:23,096
We are gonna tiptoe very carefully
from here on in, you understand?

260
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:25,882
You do nothing without
checking with me first.

261
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:28,969
- Got it?
- Got it.

262
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:56,528
A 14th-century scroll refers to
one of the oldest of the Nine Clans..

263
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:58,905
as the Clan of Black Sand.

264
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:04,636
The Islamic explorer Ibn Battuta
journeyed with a group of orphans..

265
00:27:04,637 --> 00:27:07,539
that were being taken
to a remote shido..

266
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,291
hidden among snowcapped mountains.

267
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,546
Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner..

268
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:16,548
followed by a display of martial skill.

269
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:21,065
The combatants were children,
neither beyond the age of 10.

270
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,459
His hosts explained that a man's life
must be made meaningless..

271
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,760
compared to the life of the clan.

272
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:31,230
Own the meaning of a man's life..

273
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,981
and you own his heart.

274
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:09,234
You shouldn't do that. It's against
the rules. If they catch you..

275
00:28:09,236 --> 00:28:12,282
- Then they catch me.
- They will put you in the box.

276
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:17,386
I believe the heart of the tree
knows which way it needs to grow.

277
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:22,656
- Trees don't have hearts.
- Everything has a heart.

278
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:26,036
I don't.

279
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,729
Really?

280
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:29,632
Let me see.

281
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:35,328
Hello?

282
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,200
It's saying hello back..

283
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:45,214
and that it's happy to meet me,
but it misses you.

284
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,214
- Liar.
- I'm not lying.

285
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,854
Listen to mine.

286
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:43,496
For an entire year, you shall live
without one of your senses..

287
00:29:43,497 --> 00:29:47,647
beginning with the sense
you rely on the most.

288
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:10,190
You must see with more
than your eyes.

289
00:32:32,232 --> 00:32:34,700
Cut him, Kiriko.

290
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:37,816
All failure must be sown into the flesh.

291
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:41,056
Cut him.

292
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,102
You know the law.

293
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,514
I told you.

294
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:21,887
I tried to warn you.

295
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:23,476
Yes.

296
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:27,262
You did.

297
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:29,358
Why, Kiriko?

298
00:34:30,684 --> 00:34:31,684
Why?

299
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,934
Why am I in here..

300
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:41,710
or why are you out there?

301
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,295
Kiriko!

302
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:40,668
Why are you doing this?

303
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:43,230
I have to.

304
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:47,800
You know the law.
He will cut your heart from your chest.

305
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:49,579
No.

306
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:52,942
He can never touch my heart.

307
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,998
Come with me.

308
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:18,298
Where? What is out there?

309
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,599
Life.

310
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,916
My life is here.

311
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:32,530
Shh.

312
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:34,365
Fucking Christ, Ryan.

313
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:39,086
I'm sorry I couldn't talk earlier, Mika.
They're watching me. Get in.

314
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,880
Where have you been?
I have been calling your office.

315
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:50,893
Now I know how Sabatin must have felt.

316
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,184
What's happened?

317
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:55,186
Right now I have got
Internal Affairs, Homeland Security..

318
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:58,289
the CIA and for all I know
the Martian military in my office..

319
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,041
tearing the place apart.

320
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,061
What are we gonna do?

321
00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:04,429
You are gonna pack your bags,
go on holiday.

322
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:05,630
No way.

323
00:38:05,632 --> 00:38:08,000
Don't argue.
I trusted you, you gotta trust me.

324
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:10,601
I'm sorry, I can't let you lose
your job because of me.

325
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:13,871
I'm not talking about losing my job.
Take this.

326
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:17,318
It's clean, untraceable, no serial number.

327
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:20,311
- Ryan?
- Yeah, I know.

328
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:24,615
I have investigated world bank organizations,
drug cartels, arms dealers.

329
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:27,367
I have never faced this kind of heat.

330
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:30,668
For ninjas. It's fucking unbelievable.

331
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:35,905
Excuse me.

332
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:39,331
- Hey.
- Hi.

333
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:41,650
So, what's going on?

334
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:47,005
Power's out. Us, the building behind us,
and that one across the street.

335
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:50,155
It seems like every few months,
boom, the light's out.

336
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:53,552
Okay.

337
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:55,588
Thanks.

338
00:40:40,153 --> 00:40:40,903
Ah!

339
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:15,487
- More will come.
- What?

340
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:17,523
They won't stop until you're dead.

341
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:19,672
Oh, God.

342
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,793
A gun won't help you.

343
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:24,061
Well,
I don't have a lot of options, okay?

344
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:25,530
I once took a Tae Bo class..

345
00:41:25,532 --> 00:41:28,634
but that is the extent
of my kung-fu abilities, all right?

346
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:32,443
I can help you, but you have to trust me.

347
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:39,057
Okay.

348
00:41:54,894 --> 00:41:56,336
Do you know me?

349
00:41:58,632 --> 00:41:59,632
How?

350
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:06,672
Security camera in New York
recorded you fighting one of them.

351
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:08,115
You know about them?

352
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,849
A little.

353
00:42:11,077 --> 00:42:13,621
Well, there are these clans.

354
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:18,150
And, apparently, they have been
supplying assassins to governments..

355
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,661
or anyone who has
100 pounds of gold..

356
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,695
for the last thousand years.

357
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,070
His name was Jin.

358
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:29,795
Wait, you knew him?

359
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:33,233
- He was not born an assassin.
- You're from his clan.

360
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:37,179
- They why did you stop him?
- They're coming.

361
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:38,737
Who?

362
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:51,056
It was him,
the traitor, Raizo. Murderer.

363
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,420
- Fresh kill.
- He's with the girl.

364
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,887
Still close.

365
00:42:56,889 --> 00:42:59,673
Very close.

366
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,382
Run, little brother, run.

367
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:11,902
Weakness compels strength.

368
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:14,606
Betrayal begets blood.

369
00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:17,208
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

370
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,378
Ah!

371
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:49,440
We have been betrayed.

372
00:43:49,442 --> 00:43:53,978
A child of mine, my daughter,
betrayed us.

373
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:59,358
She refused my gifts, rejected our clan.

374
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:04,329
Her shame can only be purged
with blood.

375
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:05,329
You.

376
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,777
You, my son, who returned her
shall have this honor.

377
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:45,882
Ah!

378
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:04,123
- Where are we going?
- Doesn't matter.

379
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:07,385
You think they're following us?

380
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:09,153
I know they're following us.

381
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:11,905
I don't see anything back there.

382
00:45:11,905 --> 00:45:13,891
They have our scent.

383
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:16,327
Following our scent? Like dogs?

384
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:19,342
No. Like wolves.

385
00:45:22,235 --> 00:45:23,985
My name's Mika, by the way.

386
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:30,018
Raizo is the name I was given.

387
00:45:30,643 --> 00:45:32,222
So you're an orphan?

388
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:39,864
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna try
and fill in some of the blanks here.

389
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:45,090
So you must have been taken by the
Ozunu Clan, trained to be an assassin..

390
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,927
but something happened and you
decided to opt out of the program.

391
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,730
Now, I don't imagine
that went over so well.

392
00:45:51,731 --> 00:45:54,599
Since they're after me
for just peeking through the keyhole..

393
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,835
they must be after you
in, like, a major way.

394
00:45:56,835 --> 00:46:00,237
But you're also after them,
which is why you're in Berlin.

395
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:03,141
Because Sabatin is one of the few people
pursuing the clans..

396
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:05,427
which is why they took him out.

397
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:09,458
But here's a question I can't answer.

398
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,628
Why did you save me?

399
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:27,498
Your entire life
has brought you to this moment.

400
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,614
Do not fail yourself.

401
00:46:30,903 --> 00:46:33,313
Do not fail your family.

402
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:38,291
He's wearing a gold watch.

403
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:40,989
Bring it to me.

404
00:47:19,686 --> 00:47:21,833
That kind of tickled.

405
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:32,539
It's gonna take more than a knitting needle
to fuck me up, boy!

406
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:10,820
Ah!

407
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:09,927
Keep it.

408
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:11,630
It will remind you that..

409
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:15,918
every moment of your life
is a gift I have given you.

410
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:21,954
You have made me proud, my son.

411
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:25,876
Now the time has come
for you to prove..

412
00:49:25,878 --> 00:49:28,753
you are true Ozunu.

413
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:37,835
She tried to run from us..

414
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:40,766
from our family.

415
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:48,215
Takeshi caught her
and returned her to us.

416
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,777
Weakness compels strength.

417
00:49:52,778 --> 00:49:55,282
Betrayal begets blood.

418
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:09,668
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

419
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:25,557
Hiyah!

420
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,621
Kill him!

421
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:34,204
You need protection.

422
00:51:34,206 --> 00:51:39,391
No. I want Ozunu,
and I need your help to get him.

423
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:43,289
Exit here.

424
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,525
- You are a size 36?
- What?

425
00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:56,606
No, size 34.

426
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,684
If you leave while I'm gone..

427
00:52:03,684 --> 00:52:05,869
they will hunt you and kill you.

428
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:08,086
Do you understand?

429
00:52:26,827 --> 00:52:28,201
Get undressed.

430
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:31,913
Shower, but do not use soap.
Do you smoke?

431
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,514
Put your clothes in here.

432
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:40,918
These jeans are a little tight.

433
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:44,251
You said 34.

434
00:52:44,945 --> 00:52:50,699
Yeah, well, it's German sizes.
They must run a little small, I guess.

435
00:52:55,387 --> 00:52:58,501
This is for our scent. Right?

436
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:01,271
Let's go.

437
00:53:05,565 --> 00:53:06,963
- Yeah?
- Ryan, it's me.

438
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:10,733
- Mika, I have been calling you for hours.
- I know, I'm in a bit of trouble.

439
00:53:10,735 --> 00:53:12,702
You miss jury service, you're in trouble.

440
00:53:12,704 --> 00:53:14,905
You're in the deepest shit
you have ever been in.

441
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:16,840
At least I'm not down here by myself.

442
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,143
Sabatin's guy from the tape?
Is he with you?

443
00:53:19,143 --> 00:53:20,811
He's on our side, Ryan.

444
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:23,527
He wants Ozunu,
but he needs the agency's help.

445
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:26,215
- Be careful, Mika.
- I trust him.

446
00:53:26,217 --> 00:53:30,487
All right, look, I can't make any promises,
but if he cooperates, I will do what I can.

447
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:32,704
- Can you meet us?
- Where?

448
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:34,806
How about the usual?

449
00:53:41,766 --> 00:53:43,641
There he is.

450
00:53:45,438 --> 00:53:48,621
Now, it's all right. He's a good guy.

451
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:52,108
- Mika, are you okay?
- Yeah.

452
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,121
Thanks to him.

453
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:57,146
- Why have you done this?
- Done what?

454
00:53:57,148 --> 00:53:58,864
People will die.

455
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,228
- Now!
- No!

456
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,331
Don't move!

457
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,103
This is wrong! No! No!

458
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:12,942
Charlie 2, do you read me?

459
00:54:13,898 --> 00:54:15,407
Move him!

460
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:18,268
What the fuck are you doing?

461
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:20,315
Following orders.

462
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,757
- Prisoner is secure, sir.
- Right.

463
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:28,525
Sure doesn't look like
a killing machine to me, sir.

464
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:30,958
Looks like he belongs in a boy band.

465
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:36,469
He couldn't have heard that. Could he?

466
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:39,523
- Sir?
- Ryan? This is wrong.

467
00:54:39,523 --> 00:54:41,525
I mean, it can't be legal.

468
00:54:41,525 --> 00:54:45,061
What is this place?
Your own private Guantanamo?

469
00:54:45,063 --> 00:54:48,998
It's an old GDR safe house.
Jamison wants this off the grid.

470
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,768
You're making a huge mistake.

471
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:53,603
I don't think so.

472
00:54:53,605 --> 00:54:57,474
I got reports from London, Washington
and Osaka, all tagging your boy.

473
00:54:57,474 --> 00:55:00,110
The only problem we have
is where to extradite him first.

474
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,478
Two weeks ago,
there's no such thing as ninja..

475
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,083
and now every city in the world
has a warrant for one?

476
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,418
- He is not the enemy.
- He's a killer, Mika.

477
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,753
Weren't you telling me
it was our job to stop him?

478
00:55:10,755 --> 00:55:13,990
- You're not even listening.
- You're not saying anything worth hearing.

479
00:55:13,992 --> 00:55:17,869
Wanna do the insubordination tango?
Let's go. But not in front of the children.

480
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,867
Boys, get out.

481
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:26,244
Come on, let's go!

482
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:29,239
Damn it, I am just trying to..

483
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,742
Shut up and listen to me.
We don't have much time.

484
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:33,911
Now I don't know
what we have stumbled into..

485
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:36,346
but somebody's pulling
some major strings inside.

486
00:55:36,347 --> 00:55:40,996
They want him dead.
He's been fighting them for years.

487
00:55:40,998 --> 00:55:43,219
I believe you.

488
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:45,956
I have been in this business too long
not to smell a setup..

489
00:55:45,956 --> 00:55:48,525
but we have to be very careful
how we handle this..

490
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:52,003
and I cannot risk
you going AWOL on me again.

491
00:55:52,005 --> 00:55:53,813
Now, if you get into trouble..

492
00:55:55,067 --> 00:55:56,833
you switch this on..

493
00:55:56,835 --> 00:56:00,211
and no matter where you are,
I will find you.

494
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:23,536
Hey.

495
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:29,041
You looked thirsty.

496
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:00,706
I'm sorry,
I didn't know about any of this.

497
00:57:01,132 --> 00:57:04,110
- I know.
- You do?

498
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:07,750
The only time you lied to me
was when you told me your size.

499
00:57:10,108 --> 00:57:12,722
How did you know that?

500
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,353
Your heart. It is special.

501
00:57:22,521 --> 00:57:26,306
Maslow's on our side.
He's gonna try to help you.

502
00:57:26,306 --> 00:57:28,833
It's too late.

503
00:57:30,028 --> 00:57:31,260
No one goes here.

504
00:57:31,262 --> 00:57:33,362
Ryan? Ryan, can I talk to you?

505
00:57:33,364 --> 00:57:35,706
Do we have to do this again, Coretti?

506
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:38,141
I just..

507
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:41,170
I have reason to believe a group
of ninja may be on their way.

508
00:57:41,172 --> 00:57:45,253
I think these gentlemen can handle a few
wackjobs wearing pajamas, am I right?

509
00:57:45,744 --> 00:57:48,277
- You see?
- Yeah, but the situation we discussed..

510
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:49,478
I'm working on that.

511
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,681
- You have to give me time.
- We don't have time.

512
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:54,851
- They're not here now, are they?
- They will be here soon.

513
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:56,228
How soon?

514
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:01,298
Raizo.

515
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,009
- Mika! Go with her, secure the prisoner.
- Go, go, go.

516
00:58:06,297 --> 00:58:08,764
Team 2,
we're on our way down to the holding cell.

517
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:09,932
What's your 20?

518
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:12,981
We're just now entering section four.

519
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:35,525
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

520
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:37,760
- Good way to get killed.
- I need that cell open.

521
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:40,329
- We're moving the prisoner.
- Those are not my orders.

522
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:42,581
- Mika! Get out of here!
- Not without you!

523
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:45,576
Then we all die together.

524
00:59:04,088 --> 00:59:06,202
Open fire! Multiple targets!

525
00:59:19,538 --> 00:59:21,905
- Open that gate.
- I can't do that.

526
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:24,516
Go to infrared, boys.

527
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:27,284
They're already in the room.

528
00:59:34,786 --> 00:59:36,331
Open fire!

529
00:59:37,222 --> 00:59:39,766
We're under attack! Unknown number!

530
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:51,518
Shit.

531
01:00:00,545 --> 01:00:02,512
Oh, Mika, Mika.

532
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:03,853
Shh.

533
01:00:05,717 --> 01:00:07,501
I like you more and more.

534
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:11,034
Okay, all right.

535
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:16,041
Shit.

536
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:22,876
- Mika, hurry.
- Okay.

537
01:00:25,137 --> 01:00:27,103
Mika, I don't wanna sound critical..

538
01:00:27,105 --> 01:00:29,719
Look, I'm doing the best I can here.

539
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,655
- We don't have much time!
- Shit!

540
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,034
Let's go.

541
01:00:57,835 --> 01:00:59,210
Oh, God.

542
01:01:00,338 --> 01:01:03,054
We are heavily
engaged with the enemy, I repeat..

543
01:01:07,445 --> 01:01:08,820
Wait here.

544
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:46,528
Let's go.

545
01:01:50,255 --> 01:01:52,003
We got two men over on the side!

546
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,193
Get down, get down!

547
01:01:56,193 --> 01:01:58,172
Look out!

548
01:02:19,617 --> 01:02:22,197
The car's upstairs. Go.

549
01:02:23,387 --> 01:02:26,672
- Go now.
- Okay.

550
01:02:30,394 --> 01:02:32,061
Murderer.

551
01:02:32,063 --> 01:02:34,998
Traitor. So long, brother.

552
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:40,637
Vengeance, betrayal
begets blood, brother. Murderer.

553
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:45,076
Death. Kill. Murderer.
Kill him. Just. Vengeance.

554
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,487
Little brother.

555
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:55,981
Come on, Raizo.

556
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:06,717
Raizo, where are you?

557
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:15,264
Shit.

558
01:06:17,856 --> 01:06:18,606
Ah!

559
01:06:23,628 --> 01:06:25,309
Fuck!

560
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:29,516
Shit. Oh, my God. Okay.

561
01:06:32,036 --> 01:06:33,751
Okay.

562
01:06:38,143 --> 01:06:40,289
Oh, my God!

563
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,731
Come on!

564
01:07:58,556 --> 01:08:00,601
Watch it! Help!

565
01:08:37,496 --> 01:08:38,246
Ah!

566
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:01,431
Goodbye, little brother.

567
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:04,966
Get in!

568
01:09:18,136 --> 01:09:19,953
I can't believe I found you.

569
01:09:20,305 --> 01:09:22,384
I was waiting for you.

570
01:09:31,048 --> 01:09:33,867
- Ugh!
- Oh, God.

571
01:09:34,219 --> 01:09:37,002
I have to get you to a hospital.

572
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:39,372
No. Not a hospital.

573
01:09:40,457 --> 01:09:43,072
Just keep moving.

574
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,631
- Mika, where are you?
- He told me to keep moving.

575
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:50,966
- Is he still alive?
- After a fashion.

576
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,703
Jesus Christ.
Listen, I'm gonna bring you in.

577
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:56,838
- No, not this time.
- There are too many people involved.

578
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,057
- It's just a matter of time.
- I don't think we have much time.

579
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:02,594
Mika.

580
01:10:02,595 --> 01:10:04,154
Shit.

581
01:10:48,893 --> 01:10:51,643
I know you can't hear me..

582
01:10:51,962 --> 01:10:55,542
so I'm sure this doesn't matter..

583
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:58,211
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

584
01:11:00,572 --> 01:11:03,913
I'm just a forensic researcher.

585
01:11:05,409 --> 01:11:10,162
It's like a fancy way of saying
I'm a librarian.

586
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:15,635
By myself, I can't do anything
to help you.

587
01:11:19,323 --> 01:11:22,666
I wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

588
01:11:34,338 --> 01:11:37,487
And I hope you can forgive me
for this.

589
01:11:38,243 --> 01:11:40,409
- Agent Maslow! The tracking device.
- Yeah?

590
01:11:40,411 --> 01:11:43,524
- You got a lock?
- Triangulating her position now.

591
01:11:43,525 --> 01:11:45,765
Alright, I want the
International Task Force mobilized..

592
01:11:45,766 --> 01:11:47,867
and ready to go in 5 minutes.

593
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,832
At last.

594
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,467
Kill him.

595
01:12:05,469 --> 01:12:06,836
Slit his throat.

596
01:12:06,837 --> 01:12:08,171
No.

597
01:12:08,171 --> 01:12:11,822
Our father should have the honor.

598
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:15,311
- Take him to Father.
- Bring him to Father.

599
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:33,911
- Clear.
- Clear.

600
01:12:43,274 --> 01:12:45,887
They took him 10 minutes ago.

601
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:48,957
He's gone.

602
01:13:16,673 --> 01:13:19,890
You are Ozunu.

603
01:13:21,045 --> 01:13:25,764
You are part of me,
as I am part of you.

604
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:30,268
This is the truth of your lives.

605
01:13:31,421 --> 01:13:36,208
And it will remain true after death.

606
01:14:24,576 --> 01:14:25,655
My child.

607
01:14:28,412 --> 01:14:31,856
It is good to see you again.

608
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,203
Do you know there was a time..

609
01:14:41,091 --> 01:14:43,993
when I looked at you..

610
01:14:43,993 --> 01:14:46,279
I felt such pride.

611
01:14:48,265 --> 01:14:52,746
No child ever showed more promise.

612
01:14:54,204 --> 01:14:57,640
You are the son I was waiting for..

613
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,960
the one to take my place.

614
01:15:03,981 --> 01:15:09,597
And now, do you know
what you have done?

615
01:15:09,599 --> 01:15:14,023
How you have shamed my family?

616
01:15:14,024 --> 01:15:17,242
How you have hurt me?

617
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:23,682
Why do you think I did it?

618
01:15:28,573 --> 01:15:30,652
Get this thing..

619
01:15:31,341 --> 01:15:33,056
out of my sight.

620
01:15:44,087 --> 01:15:48,738
Tonight we avenge
our brothers and sisters.

621
01:15:50,528 --> 01:15:54,336
Tonight we avenge our honor.

622
01:15:56,801 --> 01:16:03,112
Let this death be remembered
for a thousand years.

623
01:16:13,518 --> 01:16:16,359
Weakness compels strength.

624
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:25,161
Betrayal begets blood.

625
01:16:25,162 --> 01:16:25,912
Ah!

626
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:35,179
You are getting weak..

627
01:16:35,806 --> 01:16:37,818
old man.

628
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:39,193
Ah!

629
01:16:55,259 --> 01:16:56,632
Father!

630
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:15,386
Move it!

631
01:17:33,064 --> 01:17:34,438
Shit!

632
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:42,083
- What took you?
- You knew I'd come?

633
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:45,373
Just because I was asleep
doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.

634
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,659
And I forgive you.

635
01:17:48,845 --> 01:17:50,753
Mika!

636
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,594
Come, this way.

637
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:19,007
You swore to me
you'd stay inside the APC.

638
01:18:19,009 --> 01:18:22,055
- I thought we were too late.
- First team is ready, sir!

639
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:24,796
- Hit it!
- Go!

640
01:18:32,023 --> 01:18:33,396
Stay here.

641
01:18:48,706 --> 01:18:50,079
You two, with me!

642
01:19:14,398 --> 01:19:16,431
Come, little brother.

643
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:19,479
Let us play like old times.

644
01:19:30,046 --> 01:19:30,796
Ah!

645
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:39,640
Ah!

646
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,029
Ah!

647
01:20:06,117 --> 01:20:07,490
My turn.

648
01:20:07,918 --> 01:20:10,100
Watch the roof!

649
01:21:05,609 --> 01:21:07,518
Do you still think about her?

650
01:21:08,912 --> 01:21:12,198
Do you remember the sound she made
when I stuck her?

651
01:21:13,751 --> 01:21:14,501
Ah!

652
01:21:34,872 --> 01:21:35,872
Ugh!

653
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,430
Ah!

654
01:21:46,182 --> 01:21:46,932
Ah!

655
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:54,489
Watch the roof!

656
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:59,039
3 o'clock! I need a solid
perimeter on the left, now!

657
01:22:18,015 --> 01:22:20,662
You remember..

658
01:22:21,051 --> 01:22:22,891
all I taught you.

659
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:43,449
You are still Ozunu.

660
01:22:52,216 --> 01:22:57,298
Come. Beg your father for forgiveness.

661
01:23:06,863 --> 01:23:07,613
Ah!

662
01:23:24,782 --> 01:23:26,599
Your heart is weak.

663
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:53,497
Raizo!

664
01:24:28,578 --> 01:24:32,762
All this loss, this waste..

665
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:38,234
because you put yourself
before your family.

666
01:24:39,923 --> 01:24:42,935
This is not my family.

667
01:24:45,462 --> 01:24:48,280
You are not my father.

668
01:24:48,631 --> 01:24:51,600
And the breath I take after I kill you..

669
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,216
will be the first breath of my life.

670
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:05,125
Ah!

671
01:26:19,088 --> 01:26:22,690
- Mika, run!
- Where is he?

672
01:26:22,692 --> 01:26:24,259
Where is he?

673
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,338
Get away!

674
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:28,337
Mika!

675
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:29,916
No!

676
01:26:36,206 --> 01:26:38,524
Most children are disappointments..

677
01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:42,487
not worth the effort to raise.

678
01:27:23,287 --> 01:27:24,037
Ah!

679
01:27:59,323 --> 01:28:01,230
Mika.

680
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:29,917
Jesus Christ, what happened?

681
01:28:29,918 --> 01:28:31,930
She saved my life.

682
01:28:34,557 --> 01:28:35,966
Medic!

683
01:28:37,493 --> 01:28:39,402
Medic!

684
01:28:44,435 --> 01:28:46,912
She will be all right.

685
01:28:47,704 --> 01:28:49,783
Her heart is special.

686
01:28:51,507 --> 01:28:53,826
I need a medic here now!

687
01:29:00,717 --> 01:29:03,467
- Is she gonna be all right?
- I don't understand.

688
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,755
She's got a hole
right through her heart, but..

689
01:29:06,756 --> 01:29:09,439
My heart is over here.

690
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:08,867
Come with me.

691
01:30:45,699 --> 01:30:48,199
